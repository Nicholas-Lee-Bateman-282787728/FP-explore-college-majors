1036701,5,6305472408,"It's about time that a company focused its attention on Ub Iwerks.  The Cartoons That Time Forgot, are literally just that, cartoons that have not seen the light of day from the time they were made.  Ub Iwerks got his start working for Walt Disney, and animated the earliest Mickey Mouse cartoons as well as some of the early Silly Symphonies.
These cartoons clearly show some influences from the Disney studios, some characters look amazingly Mickey Mouseish, and many have the same charm of the Disney shorts.  These cartoons are a good introduction to some cartoon characters that never quite caught on, like Flip the Frog and Willie Whopper (who?).
If you are a vintage animation lover, then this DVD belongs in your library!",1087948800,18,729,4.862903225806452
1036702,3,6305472408,"This collection is a real treat for those who treasure vintage, hand-drawn animation, especially those who know that there was cinematic life beyond the Disney and Warner Bros. studios. While there are far too many rather mediocre ""Flip The Frog"" cartoons included, the real find are the hilarious ""Willie Whopper"" cartoons, winningly voiced by seven year old child star Jane Withers. Anyone who loved Frank Marsales' smoking jazz soundtracks for early Warner Bros. shorts will adore the rip-roarin' theme of this little-known series.
Unfortunately, the reason these cartoons are ""forgotten"" is that the vast majority of them feature racist images which we, thankfully, no longer have to be subjected to as a part of popular culture. While a cartoon historian can accept them as a common aspect of this genre, most people will probably find them offensive enough to wish to avoid this series of releases altogether. Not recommended for children or those who prefer not to be reminded of how ignorant and hurtful Hollywood could be.",1081296000,20,1031,5.179640718562874

1036704,4,6305472408,"This is a nice little collection. With the neglect of classic cartoons by the networks (CN) these days, these DVD collections are a real treat for anyone looking to see some theatrical  classics. The quility is nice for when these cartoons were originally produced and was nicely put together. Image unlike Winstar's Public Domian collections didn't mess with the sound of the originals which is another reason this collection is great.

1036705,4,6305472408,"My title may seem disrespectful to ""the Master"" but it is a fact that Walt Disney admitted in later years that he couldn't draw worth a lick.........
Walt's genius lay in knowing talent (which is why Ub Iwerks was so pivotal as the creator and original animator of Mickey Mouse) in comic inspiration, and in constantly upgrading his studios product.
The cartoons on this DVD show what comes of techincal skill without the last two attributes....they are good for their time (compare them with Mickey 1928-1930!) but they never evolve. The Iwerks vision is intriguing to the modern eye, bizarre and eccentric at times and one can see why the studio bosses of the time wouldn't back it; the technical quality of these cartoons is adequate but the story treatments can be strange and not always child - friendly.
If you like animation, you should buy both volumes of this DVD set. If you are looking for an electronic babysitter for the kids, go buy some modern pap that won't offend anyone or strain the intellect too much. These cartoons are for the serious student.",1059091200,19,1065,4.762162162162162
1036706,2,6305472408,"After reading all the glowing reviews here, I ordered Vol. 1 expecting quite a treat.  I am a huge fan of classic animation, especially from the Fleischer Bros. Studio.  I consider their Superman series (avoid the WinStar set) to be one of the greatest creative feats of American popular culture.
  After watching half of this DVD I've come to the conclusion that I never need to see any of these cartoons again.  Perhaps they are interesting from a historical viewpoint, but they are not as entertaining as the product of the other major studios.  Maybe I should watch the whole DVD, in case the second half is markedly superior to the first 16 cartoons, but I doubt it.
  If you do buy this set, don't be surprised when you come to the realization that they are nowhere near as good as the majority of reviews here imply.  See if you can rent it first for a test drive, before spending ... on an item you'll probably watch just once.",1045180800,2,935,4.485207100591716
1036707,5,6305472408,"This is a collection of cartoons from the Ub Iwerks studio, created in 1930 soon after Iwerks left Disney, only for it to close in 1936, a couple of years after the loss of his MGM contract.
Iwerks's first cartoon creation was Flip the Frog. Flip was basically a Mickey Mouse-type character, a happy, dancing character with little personality. It came as no suprise when Flip was scrapped a few years later, but his cartoons are not really that bad, because all of his cartoons had musical scores written by the great Carl Stalling (who later enjoyed huge success with ""Looney Tunes""), which helps to make the Flip cartoons quite enjoyable.
Iwerks next venture was Willie Whopper, a boy who would tell tall tales, such as how he can fly a plane, or saving his girlfriend from outlaws. He wasn't very successful either, and the series was perhaps the weakest of Iwerks's cartoons.
The last Iwerks cartoon series was the underrated ""ComiColor"" series. These cartoons were based on nursery rhymes and childern tales, with a lot of musical and dancing numbers, which seems to suggest that Iwerks was creating something a bit different rather than creating a carbon copy of Walt Disney's ""Silly Symphonies"", in which some studios tried to imitate. These were made in two-colour Cinecolor (as Walt Disney had the exclusive rights to use the 3-colour Technicolor process at the time), and were released independently due to MGM refusal to distribute them. The ComiColor series was not very successful too, which resulted in the closure of Iwerks's studio.
This DVD contains a whopping 32 cartoons on this DVD, from Iwerk's first cartoon ""Fiddlesticks"" (Flip the Frog in 2-colour Technicolor)to his last ComiColor cartoon ""Happy Days"".
The quality of these cartoons are generally better than any other Public Domain home video, with the ComiColor cartoons retaining their original titles. Some of the Flip the Frog cartoons have their original titles recreated, and the cartoons themselves are of near-pristine quality. Sadly, the Willie Whopper cartoons have seen better days, with most of his cartoons having a noisy picture and sound quality.
However, 32 ultra-rare cartoons in one DVD represents good value for money, and should not be ignored by fans of classic animation.",1043712000,67,2269,5.085790884718499
1036708,1,6305472408,"There is a good reason why ""time forgot"" these cartoons - they are boring.  Working for Disney does't qualify somebody as a genius, but mentioning the Master's name sells even these second class cartoons.  Maybe they were not so bad for their time, but I was expecting much more.",1043280000,4,279,4.673469387755102
1036709,5,6305472408,"This cartoon compendium showcases the works of two-time Oscar Winning animator and multiplane animation camera innovator Ub Iwerks.  The cartoons contained on both Collections 1&2 represent his output from his own studio work after leaving Disney's studio (having been his collaborator / animator on the first Mickey Mouse cartoons and many more) and before short stays at Columbia, Warner Bros., and finally returning to work at Walt Disney Productions.  Sadly his stint as a solo cartoon maker would end after only six years due to losing MGM's major studio backing in 1934 for refusal to make cartoons more mainstream and with happy endings like Disney and other studios at the time.  He continued on for two more years into 1936 before shutting down. The cartoons here are from Iwerks' magical solo period from 1931 to 1936.  Iwerks DVD Collection 1 contains the 32 cartoons previously released as three separate videos by the same company: All Singing! All Dancing! vol. 1, Willie Whopper's Fantastic Adventures and Other Tall Tales vol. 2, and Free-Form Fairy Tales vol. 3.  The All Singing! All Dancing! cartoons feature Iwerks' first star Flip the Frog, a send up of vaudeville singer/dancers.  Willie Whopper is essentially a boy version of Fatty Arbuckle crossed with Baron Von Munchausen.  Many of the cartoons contain scores from legendary Warner Bros. and Disney composer Carl Stalling, who was a pioneer in composing/adapting music that could be well synchronized to animation.  Later on, Iwerks would do groundbreaking animation for such films as ""101 Dalmatians""(1961), Hitchcock's ""The Birds""(1963), and ""Mary Poppins""(1964).  However, this collection is not solely for cartoon historians but a fun treat for viewers of all ages.  The titles on the DVD are as follows: All Singing! All Dancing! 1. Fiddlesticks(color), 2. The Soup Song(b&w), 3. The Little Red Hen(color), 4. The Village Smitty(b&w), 5. Mary's Little Lamb(color), 6. The Village Barber(b&w), 7. Old Mother Hubbard(color), 8. Humpty Dumpty(color), 9. The Brementown Musicians(color), 10. Summertime(color), 11. The Music Lesson(b&w), 12. Puddle Pranks(b&w), Willie Whopper's Fantastic Adventures And Other Tall Tales 13. The Good Scout(b&w), 14.

1036949,4,6305472408,"After watching a ton of Disney Treasure sets, this collection of Ub Iwerks early cartoons may not be of the same quality as his efforts with Disney, but they are certainly worth the time of any animation history buff. At a bargain price, this set features 32 cartoons and for the most part they look very good, with most of the wear being at the beginning of each short during titles and the first 30 seconds or so of the shorts. Have they been remastered? .....probably not, but besides a little wear here and there, they are presented uncut and look pretty clear and not washed out. About a third of the cartoons are black & white and the rest are color.

The set has a pretty basic menu, but my only gripe is the menu could have used a little work to make it a little more user friendly. You can play all the cartoons or look at the scene selection for individual titles, but once you start the cartoon from any point, it will play all from that point. Meaning you have to stop after each cartoon and go to the menu if you want to skip around and see selected shorts. It's not a huge deal, but it could have been easily fixed with a few adjustments.

Is it worth buying, absolutely! it has 32 rare shorts that may never look any better or be released again. At a tad under $10.00(or cheaper if you look around), you get a nice collection of cartoons from a man who was a pioneer in animation. The shorts are not the best he produced, but I enjoyed these cartoons very much. .....hopefully volume 2 corrected the menu problems. I'll let you know... :-)",1298678400,2,1554,4.300341296928328

1036952,3,6305472408,"I'm a huge fan of classic animation from the 30's, so I'm delighted to have this large collection at such a great price.  But I do think people who prefer the laughs of Warner Bros. or the polish of Disney shorts will be disappointed.  Flip the Frog and Willie Whopper aren't exactly household names, and it's not hard to see why.  The cartoons, though well-made, lack much personality and the action is too often repetitive.

The picture and sound quality varies from fair to good, with many of the ComicColor 'toons looking a bit washed out.  Flip, in basic black & white, at least looks better than the color cartoons in this collection.

Still, for the price, it's worth having if you're into this sort of thing.",1148774400,10,716,4.5984251968503935
1036953,4,6305472408,"Many of the other commentators of Volume 1 and Volume 2 have very nicely described the contents of these two collections.  I'd like to just say that I found these cartoons to be very essential for anyone interested in the history of animation.

Flip the Frog comes across as another Mickey Mouse, Willie Whopper is somewhat interesting, while the Comicolor series is somewhat similar to Silly Symphonies.  I'm not surprised at this since Ub worked at Disney, and is responsible for the early animation of Mickey Mouse and several Silly Symphonies.

I found the liner notes helpful in explaining the social context of these cartoons.  Many are poking fun at the Hollywood stars of the day (Disney and Warner also have several of their own similar cartoons), others have relevant commentary about various conditions in our country at the time, and others are just interesting trips into the supernatural.  Keep in mind that all these things have been pursued by Disney, Warner Brothers, etc., so there is nothing unusual here.  There are plenty of sight gags and the usual exaggerations that early cartoons are especially known for.

Also, I think it would be fair to say that the characters and stories as a whole tend not to progressively develop over the short life of Ub's studio.  If you treat all the cartoons simply as individual accomplishments, then it's not a big deal, but as a whole they don't really change much.  This isn't necessarily a problem, just an observation.

It's kind of interesting to me that I always felt I was almost watching Disney cartoons, but at the same time there are definitely other edgier influences at work here.  The fact that Ub's staff of animators largely came from the Fleischer studio, and included Betty Boop's creator, made the difference. Because of this, innuendo abounds in several of Flip's cartoons, produced from 1930-1933 (pre-Code era).  One cartoon, ""The Milkman"" ends with Flip and the kid singing ""Hail, Hail, the gang's all here"", and the horse responds by singing ""What the hell do we care?"".  The second time around, as the horse startes to sing the same response, Flip bashes him over the head with a milk bottle to stop him from using the ""naughty"" word.  Holy cow!!! Can you imagine Disney doing this?  In ""The Office Boy"", the sexual innuendos hit a high, especially with the secretary.  I was laughing for being taken by surprise.  I didn't expect this sort of content.  Well, get ready for an interesting time.  By the way, unless I'm mistaken, it seemed like Volume 2 was the one for the edgier cartoons.  Willie Whopper's cartoons are not too bad, really.  They are tall tales told by a kid.  Lastly, the Comi-Color cartoons, though fairly delightful, never measure up to the quality of Disney's Silly symphonies.  I'd have to say that they are probably the highest quality cartoons Ub produced.

Both DVD cases say that these cartoons are ""now viewed for the first time on DVD in unfaded, pristine prints from the orginal negatives"".  I must protest!  Many of these cartoons don't look or sound pristine at all, but are in many cases faded and dirty, with sound to match.  It depends on the cartoons.  Most of the Flip cartoons aren't so bad, the Willie Whopper ones are the worst of these two collections, and The Comi-Color cartoons all seem to have a softness about them (video and audio).  I'd say that perhaps this is the best we can get our hands on, but, really, to say ""unfaded, pristine prints"" is just flat-out not the case.  Overall, most of them are quite watchable, but just keep these observations in mind.  I give both collections four stars due to the technical issues.",1130889600,38,3653,4.7952
