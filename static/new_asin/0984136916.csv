7795260,3,0984136916,"I have two anecdotes that I must mention related to my two cents on  this doc.  First, I was in the Bay Area when the documentaries of its communities were aired in 1999 on PBS.  The announcer said something like, ""We'll talk about the great Castro and the great Chinatown and the great Mission, and the tragic tale of the Fillmore.""  Also, I went to a meeting for black, gay men in the East Bay and said, ""I wanted to know about the black, gay scene here.""  As quick as a flash, the moderator said, ""There is no black, gay scene in the Bay Area!  Either everyone died or moved away!""
That's the tone in this documentary: the Black presence in SF is a thing of the past and not likely to come back.  The work was actually multiracial: it said that the Fillmore was originally a Japanese-American community that was gutted due to interment.  Almost as soon as they speak of Blacks moving in, they discuss their being pushed aside due to urban renewal policies.  I was really ready to be sick when I learned that many of the Blacks from the Fillmore were tragic victims of the massacre in Guyana under the infamous Jim Jones.
This doc must have had the blessing of the City as its mayor-at-the-time, who was African American, was in it.  Ossie Davis is the narrator and if you miss that late brothah, that's another reason to cry a tear.
One expert said San Francisco is the only major city in the US whose Black population is going down in percentage and pure numbers.  I'm an African American and I NEVER encourage Black folk to move out West!  The Bay Area seemed like it had lots and lots of people from oppressed groups EXCEPT blacks.  If you is chocolate, please think Chicago, NYC, Atlanta, or DC before SF EVEN enters yo' head!  This documentary is testament to that.
Shockingly, this work never suggested that the Fillmore Blacks moved to Oakland.  Oakland is known for its Black presence and I didn't quite understand why or how there was no connection between the two localities.",1294185600,8,1988,4.4986072423398324
