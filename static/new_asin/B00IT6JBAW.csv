6292566,5,B00IT6JBAW,"In a short amount of time, this movie was able to get across something that we should all remember so that we can get along with others in this world. I'm not going to say what that something is. You'll have to rent or purchase the video.

I enjoyed the story line, the life lesson and the acting in this film. This is a fine film. I would recommend it. I would just say that since the film is unrated, the parent or guardian will have to decide if two words that are in the dialog are acceptable for their children to hear. The words are not extremely offensive in nature.",1399420800,,573,4.162162162162162
6292567,5,B00IT6JBAW,"This short film encapsulates the essence of a much longer movie in a short period of time. It has mystery, intrigue and an element of satirical surprise at the end. It teaches a valid life lesson in a way that you will never forget!  Through only two actors, the message is brought across with great insight and clarity.",1399248000,,320,4.517241379310345

8645265,4,B00IT6JBAW,"I enjoy watching short films... and the majority of them are obviously amateurish with bad acting and/or directing. Not so with this one.... it held my attention and even though you saw where it was going from the start it still possesses a charm that makes one think about how we all have perceptions about what we see in others.
The acting by the two leads was very good... and as stated, that's something you don't come across very often in these low budget shorts. I was pleasantly surprised... and it certainly left me smiling.
Kudos to all involved on a well conceived and executed film!",1402012800,,593,4.60377358490566
8645266,5,B00IT6JBAW,This short made me think about looking at people differently when I see them on the streets. I will share this with my friends. Great job!!!,1401148800,,140,4.423076923076923
8645267,5,B00IT6JBAW,"I was the winner of a drawing done by the writer/producer of this film,
and received a copy of the DVD of Perceptions.
I had never seen a movie short like this before,
but I have to say I was quite impressed. The writing/script was
very well-written and the story unfolded beautifully.
The characters were totally believable,
as was the whole premise of the film.
This left me wanting to see more with these characters.
I could so see them doing a full-length movie of Perceptions
starring these two very talented actors.

I can highly recommend you view this short film.  WELL worth your time.  :)",1401148800,,598,4.622641509433962
8645268,5,B00IT6JBAW,"Royce Henry,  captured your heart in this short movie, playing the role of a ""Psychiatrist"" but portraying a homeless man.
This was to make a point.  Good Movie that I would recommend.",1400803200,,184,4.71875
8645269,4,B00IT6JBAW,The film had a simple yet profound message: Don't judge a book by its cover!  Royce Henry did a great job portraying a wise professional who was trying to make a point to a young woman. Definitely a good life lesson.,1400630400,,216,4.2682926829268295
8645270,5,B00IT6JBAW,Great short film! Perceptions is well done and thought-provoking. Royce Henry did a great job. His character portrayal was excellent.,1400630400,,133,5.7
8645271,4,B00IT6JBAW,"Great story with an interesting twist.  I can see it used in a psychology class or a church group.  Acting is fantastic!  My only criticism is that the interaction is a little unreal.  Alicia is NOT uptight, even at first, and normally she would be.  She showed no fear, even in the beginning.  She smiled.  She was friendly.  If I were director I would have her being especially reticent and fearful at first and gradually warm up.  But this flaw doesn't take away from the value of this film as an educational tool.",1400112000,,517,4.473118279569892
