1822766,4,B00007M5K1,"The music and the singing in this video deserve five stars but the story and the acting combined with the minimal direction deserve a poor rating.

It is particularly a triumph of singing for Leo Nucci and La Scola is also at his best.  The soprano, who I was unfamiliar with, was also good - a big, interesting, and pleasant-enough voice.  She wasn't quite as accurate as the men, particularly at the beginning where she had some small problems at the top, but she seemed to warm up, or else I just got used to her.  Either way, she was more than acceptable.

The story, on the other hand is incomplete and it does make it very boring particularly in the first act where all the main characters are mourning the fate of the younger Foscar, but no one ever makes it plain what really has happened.  The young man complains about his lot, his innocence, and the sadness of it all - then his wife does the same; then his father follows up with the same sentiments; and finally the wife joins the father in a duet with pretty much the same theme.  It becomes maddening that you can't match these heightened emotions up to any real events.

After the first Act, things continue somewhat the same, but you do start to get a little more information as to the exact situation.  But then, the cardboard-figure acting is maddening, as the characters sing of embracing and clasping one to another's breast but they will not even approach one another and place a hand on the other guy's shoulder!  They just stand apart from one another on the stage and sing these things.  Nucci shows sincere emotion in the face, and he particularly is touching in the third act, but the lack of acting in this thing is generally stunning.

It's a great audio recording which you will likely enjoy repeatedly, so I highly recommend it for Verdi-lovers who are hungry for some more great Verdi sung excellently, but don't expect to be watching it much more than once.",1196035200,2,1940,4.527220630372493
1822767,4,B00007M5K1,Anyone who invests in the TDK DVD of 'I Due Foscari is in for a real treat. When the camera is not fixed on the stages it roams around the theatre giving the viewers a chance to admire the theatres sumptuous decor. Leo Nucci as Doge Foscari is simply magnificent presenting an admirable portrayal of a heartbroken father. If he is less successful at portraying the majesty of the doge he cannot be blamed. It is very hard to be majestic when you have curtain material for your dogal robes. Alexandrina Pendatchanska as Lucrezia Contarini has the dramatic power of Maria Callas but is mercifully free of that lady's wobble. Vincenzo La Scola as Jacopo sings magnificently and easily outacts Alberto Cupido(of the La Scala performance)Nello Santi adopts some annoying cuts but conducts what's left of the opera well. In fact the cuts have cost this performance the fifth star I would otherwise have given it,1118275200,15,905,4.8076923076923075
1822768,5,B00007M5K1,"Verdi's I Due Foscari has, in my opinion, been unjustly neglected over the years. True, the story is extremely gloomy but the music is superb, foreshadowing the many glories to come while avoiding the bombast that often appears in Verdi's earlier works such as Nabucco and Attila. The baritone part is particluarly rewarding but all three principals have the chance to make their mark.
The performance on this DVD comes from the Teatro San Carlo in Naples and features the excellent baritone Leo Nucci as the elderly Doge of Venice, Francesco Foscari. Nucci is one of those rare artists who throws himself completely into his roles. His Rigoletto at the Metropolitan in New York was absolutely amazing. As the father who must exile his own son, there is no chance for bluster or bombast just quietly expressed grief and terrible sadness. The Doge's openening solo is spun with beautiful tone and his final denunciation of the Council of Ten quite rightly draws a huge ovation from the audience. There are no typically grand operatic gestures here and Nucci's dignity and restraint are perfectly suited to the old man's plight.
As the Doge's unfortunate son, Vincenzo La Scola sings with a lovely sense of line and would shame some of the so-called supertenors in that he actually sings quietly from time to time. This is probably just as well as a steady beat enters the voice when La Scola tries to beef up his tone. His acting is also restrained as befits the situation.
Alexandrina Pendatchanska is the least successful of the three leads but this has more to do with her character. The wife of the soon-to-be-exiled tenor spends the entire opera really, really, really angry and it's hard to gain sympathy when you're always cranky. Her voice is large and has that nice Slavic ping but she too displays a heavy beat when the voice is forced. Her acting is also affected by the part as she seems to spend the whole evening looked extremely annoyed. Verdi could have done better with the role.
The stage direction is pretty dull. The director has the chorus in two lines, with the Council of Ten in a little box half way up the backstage wall so there isn't much interaction with the leads. One gets the impression that the three principal singers were also left to their own devices, Nucci and La Scola delight with some beautiful little moments and expressions, while the
soprano just glares at the audience. A more sumptuous, old style production,such as the one mounted at La Scala this year would have been a better vehicle for the baritone and tenor.
The veteran conductor Nello Santi leads the orchestra with very good results. There is one occasion where the chorus and orchestra get out of step but otherwise, Santi has the show running smoothly. You'd expect nothing less from a professional of his calibre.
The sound and picture quality are superb and the direction for DVD is excellent.
A few minor quibbles aside,this is a masterful performance and one hopes that the Met will stage this opera for Nucci in the near future. In a perfect world, he could be joined by La Scola and either Renee Fleming or Maria Guleghina. Santi could conduct and the production should be designed by Del Monaco in the vein of the Met's excellent Simon Boccanegra.
For anyone who would enjoy a wonderful night at the opera featuring some truly wonderful singing from one of the finest baritones on the stage today, I highly recommend this DVD.",1068681600,25,3438,4.77013422818792
1822769,3,B00007M5K1,"If you are new to Verdi, I would stay away from this one.  Go for one of the DVD releases of RIGOLETTO, IL TROVATORE, or UN BALLO IN MASCHERA.  This one has some fine music and singing, but lacks the dramatic punch and intensity of those works.  Like Verdi himself did, I found it a bit on the dull side.  But those who already know Verdi's core operas will want to take a look at this lesser-known work.
The principal singers are certainly superb.  Pendatchanska is one of those formidable Slavic sopranos you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley.
The production, which seems to have been made for Italian television, has one annoying flaw.  Although the sound is generally good, the microphones are so sensitive that they pick up a lot of extraneous noise, including a whispering line prompter who is clearly audible in many scenes.",1063324800,12,835,4.608108108108108
1822770,4,B00007M5K1,"Of all of Verdi's ""unknown"" operas, I Due Foscari is probably the least known. Its fate was not helped by Verdi's opinion that it was so dark and gloomy that it was rather boring. Yes, the opera is very dark but it is not, to me, boring providing that there has been assembled three excellent singers to sing the lead roles as has been done in this performance. It is my favorite of Verdi's ""unknown"" operas. I was reminded of that fact upon viewing this wonderful performance of the work that was taped at the theater of San Carlo and was led by Nello Santi who gives one the feeling that Verdi ""runs in his blood"". I first became acquainted with I Due Foscari on a Philips recording in the 1980s that features Jose Carreras and Katia Ricciarelli--both in their vocal prime. This new performance of the opera is as good, if not better, than that performance. Three exceptional singers have been assembled--Vincenzo LaScola, Leo Nucci and that fabulous spinto-soprano Alexandrina Pendatchanska all able to meet every vocal challenge that Verdi throws at them.
The director, of this production, does not ""invent"" action for the singers to perform because, in actuality, there is not very much action in the opera--tenor, baritone die, soprano begs for help from father-in-law, etc) Just beautiful music (some of the most beautiful orchestra music Verdi ever wrote--listen to the beginning of Act II). The director simply allows the singers to, more or less, ""stand and deliver"" and these singers DO deliver!! (By the way, this production has some of the loveliest scenery and makes us of the some of the most beautiful colors that I have ever seen in any opera production--gorgeous!)
Vincenzo LaScola, as Jacopo Foscari, is really an under-rated and under-appreciated tenor! His singing in this opera is awe-inspiring. He delivers some of the most beautiful mezza-voce that I have ever heard. There is also power, feeling and great vocal control in everything that he sings in this performance.
Leo Nucci, as Francesco Foscari, has been singing for what now seems like forever. I think that he is rather taken for granted as an artist; however, he gives an overwhelming performance in this opera--vocally and dramatically. His final scene, rightfully, brings the house down.
Alexandrina Pendatchanska has to be one of the most exciting sopranos around these days! Although this opera demands less of her dramatically than her knock-out performance as Elizabeth in the DVD of Donizetti's Roberto Devereux, she is, nevertheless, vocally stunning, as Lucrezia Contarini (Jacopo's wife) in this performance. She is simply fabulous--why she is not singing the Verdi spinto-soprano roles in the large opera houses, I don't know. Hopefully, she is building her career slowly; after all, she is still very young!
Do yourself a favor and become acquainted with one of Verdi's lesser-known, but beautiful operas, by buying this DVD. If you love Verdi, as I do, you will love it!",1046131200,36,2967,5.020283975659229
7978366,4,B00007M5K1,"Domingo, Meli, and Agresta did a wonderful job in singing and generating the emotion of a great performance. The costumes were very good, but there were some oddities in the staging. The torture portrayals were more graphic than necessary. It was completely disrespectful to the Christians to see the Eucharist disrespected. No priest would pour the wine from the chalice down someone's throat if they did not wish to receive the sacrament. This is typical of the modern secularist who despises and mocks Christianity. The overall presentation of the opera did portray a complex story with clarity.",1510272000,2,598,5.175257731958763

7978369,4,B00007M5K1,"OK, when I saw a new Verdi video with three of my very favorite artists--actually, three of the greatest artists in the world (what a cliche that is, but in this case, it's true:  Domingo, Meli, and Pappano!) ... I thought, how can I go wrong?  Well, I didn't go terribly wrong, but I still have to point out the production.  People might want to know.

A few notes, first about the music.  This is early Verdi.  I like early Verdi.  In fact, I love early Verdi.  But the cognoscenti, the self-appointed Czars of musical taste, love to knock early Verdi.  They use as their justification Verdi's own statements, as later in life he was dismissive of his early works, those composed before about Rigoletto (1851).  Verdi referred to them as his ""galley years"".  I say, if Verdi had died after writing I due Foscari (1844), he would still have been regarded as one of Italy's greatest composers.  And by the way, before we start talking about libretto quality, has anyone bothered looking at the libretto of Rigoletto, or Il Trovatore??

No, I am not about to throw out Beethoven's Septet, although the composer expressed dissatisfaction with it later in life.  Nor am I about to congratulate Brahms and others, who literally did mitigate their home heating bills by relegating many earlier manuscripts to the fireplace.  Yes, I WOULD like to know what they burned!  (If you want to burn a truly pointless opera, how about Cosi Fan Tutte?  Oh, now there's blasphemy!)  Therefore no, I do not respect Verdi's opinion to that extent, to ignore his earlier works.  (That is, if it actually WAS his opinion.)

And to those of you who supposedly do respect his opinion, to knock his earlier operas, WHY then do you not respect his opinion enough to at least stage them as he intended?  Which is the higher form of respect??

Now about this particular recording.  This was taped in October 2014, when Domingo was a youthful 73.  Boy, he looks older than that, but he sure can sing.  I am also not one of those who dismisses Domingo singing baritone.  I say, it's great, go for it.  No, he doesn't sound exactly like Leonard Warren, so what?  He's still the greatest singer in the world.  Now at 75, next month he's singing Macbeth in L.A., and I'm going 400 miles to hear him.  (I do hope the Macbeth production is a good one.  I think he has the standing to avoid lousy productions.  Especially since he's the General Manager down there, it had better be good.  I will report on it HERE :)  [Update--in the comments.]  [2nd update--said Domingo Macbeth is now available on its own new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blu-ray-release/dp/B071DPRT3P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blu-ray release</a>, amazing!]

Now about I Due Foscari, and Meli and Pappano.  They are also in the very top tier of their professions.  Now that Domingo is no longer singing tenor, Meli is the greatest in the world.  He's only 36.  I predict in twenty years, Meli's name will be a household word.  He and Pappano also have the professional clout to choose only the best productions.  Toscanini refused to work with inferior productions, so did Karajan.  I hope Domingo, Meli, and Pappano will not only perform well, they will also use their influence to help educate the next generation in classical opera.  Certainly the next generation is not going to tune into my little Amazon reviews to determine right from wrong ... :)

Now some more good news.  The technical aspects of the Blu-ray are excellent.  The picture is bright where it needs to be, which is a great thing because most of the background is dark.  Also the sound is crystal clear.  I have seen or heard several unsatisfactory Blu-rays and this is NOT one of them.  Even the subtitles are a little easier than average Blu-ray style to read, thank you God.  And there is no sound-synchronization problem.

And now the bad news, which is not necessarily a deal-breaker, but does require lopping off one star from perfection.  This is a mild-Eurotrash production.  The costumes are OK.  They could be transported into a traditional production and not be considered terribly out-of-place (a bit weak, but not terrible).  The set design, however, is from a mild Klingon dungeon or something.  There are catwalks, there is a big high-def screen that shows images occasionally, and the prison cell is an iron cage that hangs down on a chain and swings around occasionally.  Maybe others like that stuff, I don't care for it.  I think if you want to write a new opera, you can specify what inanities you want on stage.  Otherwise they should reflect a little more closely what the composer had available.

I hope there will be other reviews, and I can't understand that this DVD has been out several months already and mine is the first review.  I think people may be shy about laying out money on any new Verdi operas since they have been burned by the ""Tutto Verdi"" set, which is MOSTLY Euro-traumatized stagings far worse than this.  (Strangely though, the ""Tutto Verdi"" Foscari setting is MORE traditional than this one, go figure!)

7978370,5,B00007M5K1,"The DVD is a fortunate preservation of the wonderful performances of I due Foscari from the Royal Opera House, led by Maestro Placido Domingo as Francesco Foscari, the Doge of Venice. Maestro Domingo demonstrated once again his sovereign way with the Verdi style, combining beautiful tonal quality and masterful acting. The rest of the cast were also very strong. Tenor Francesco Meli and soprano Maria Agresta rose to the occasion, meeting the vocal challenges of the their respective role successfully. Maestro Antonio Papanno and Chorus Master Renato Balsadonna were also indispensable and must be commended.

7978373,5,B00007M5K1,"Vicenzo La Scola passed away suddenly last month at the early age of 53!
He was barely 40 years old at the time of this performance. A tenor somewhat in the 'old school', he and 'father' Foscari Leo Nucci paired up effectively in this rather gloomy work from the earlier phase of Verdi's compositional career. The story plot isn't 'entertaining' one jot: it is serious tragedy with a historical background that many audiences of operas these days may not even care for.
Lord Byron originally set the history in a story plot, whereupon Verdi composed this based on Byron's story.
The opera is rather short - there are only three principals, one tenor, one baritone (being the 'two' Foscaris), and another 'Foscari' in the daughter-in-law, wife of the younger Foscari, so actually it is 'Il Trio Foscari'.
Veteran conductor Nello Santi led a group of outstanding soloists in this performance.
Nucci is rather advanced in age already by 2000, and this late 19th c. setting production serves him quite well visually. Vocally he is great - with all the power and pathos and expressiveness required of this difficult Verdian role. Visually he has that aged and tragic appearance that befits the highly tragic character of Francesco Foscari, Doge of Venice.
Vincenzo La Scola as the son Jacopo is a very competent tenor, with a slightly wide vibrato. He acts and sings convincingly as the 'sacrificed son' Jacopo Foscari for the family feud. The late 19th c. setting has hints of the modern Mafia taste.
As the wife of Jacopo, young Bulgarian soprano Alexandrina Pendatchanska wasn't even 30 at the time of this performance. She is noble and beautiful, a mixture of Cecilia Barotli and Angela Gheorghiu in terms of looks, and vocally not one single jot less capable than either.
Being such a young singer, the first appearance has her in a less than perfect vocal condition, but she progressed significantly in the various later scenes, duets and solo arias. The duet with Jacopo is sweet and touching, while the duet with Francesco powerfully moving.
The direction is a tad too stolid and serious in a plot as gloomy as this. At times the singers suffer considerably owing to this stage direction, with all the expressiveness to be done in singing and not in action. This is not easy in a work such as this.
Even so, the incompetent director was insufficient to ruin a muscially brilliant performance.",1306713600,3,2395,4.872549019607843
7978374,2,B00007M5K1,"This 2000 Neapolitan production isn't in any way superior to the 1988 Milanese under Gavazzeni (where are the gondoliers, and why does Jacopo - in the subtitles - refer to his 'sons' when his second son is a girl?). That Nucci (Francesco) and La Scola (Jacopo) are let down by the strangulated voice of Pendatchanska (Lucrezia) isn't as irritating as the disastrous cuts made to the score. Did Santi think that today's audiences are as tolerant about cuts as they were in the past, or that they wouldn't notice what has been edited out simply because it's a rare work? Not only second verses but also snippets (in fact, gems) here and there are disposed of as if it were an overlong Wagner opera (its total duration when given complete is just under two hours). FOSCARI being my favourite early Verdi opera, I couldn't enjoy this performance: I felt cheated and robbed of many lovely phrases (what a sacrilege to cut two thirds of the finale of the love duet). Despite Roark-Strummer's uneven Lucrezia, I'll stick to the Gavazzeni DVD (recently re-released on the budget label Brilliant): mercifully (though it's still annoying and even weird), only the second verse of Jacopo's Act 1 cabaletta and three short phrases from the end of the Act 2 love duet are cut. Two stars for Nucci and La Scola, and three Boos! to whoever sanctioned those cuts, be it producer, director, or conductor (I suspect the last).",1260316800,3,1408,4.774590163934426
7978375,5,B00007M5K1,"This performance of Verdi's ""I due Foscari"" is fantastic. It has the benefit of excellent singer/actors (Leo Nucci, Vincenzo LaScola, Alexandrina Pendatchanska), a great conductor (Nello Santi), masterfully created stage decore, and an intelligent director (Werner Duggelin).

The emotionally-charged atmosphere grabs the interest and doesn't release it until the last note.

Doge Foscari's psychological struggle between love and duty is masterfully portrayed in a hauntingly true manner by Leo Nucci, who, as always, doesn't merely play a role but rather becomes that character. The Doge's suppressed tenderness toward his son has a much stronger impact than would any open embrace, and his emotional turmoil is evident in every movement. His powerful, sonorous voice pours forth like lava, sounding in turn tender and warm or dismissive and cold as the action demands.

The Bulgarian soprano Alexandrina Pendatchanska has a beautiful voice with strong highs and lows and an acting ability which makes Lucrezia Contarini seem real.

Vincenzo La Scola's ringing tenor voice serves him very well for all the intricate arias and is a pleasure to listen to. He, also, is a good actor, and portrayed Jacopo Foscari very realistically.

The rest of the cast is well chosen as well, and they sing and act well.

The recording is of excellent quality, both audio and video. I enjoyed it tremendously and highly recommend that you buy it.",1256256000,5,1431,5.3097345132743365
