1388428,1,B0000524F3,"I had high expectations for this film before release, but now I expect to sell my copy and return to the far superior 1991 film ""Young Catherine"" starring Julia Ormond (particularly the unedited 180+ minute version).  THAT film was well acted, well cast, well scripted, and convincing in the details.  This piece of hackneyed,  romance novel-level  schlock isn't worth the time it takes to watch.  If it was any more cardboard, it would be on the grocery shelves holding cornflakes.

Zeta-Jones can't do anything with the lines she's given, and I expect the chief reason guys might enjoy this is to watch Catherine happily hop from bed to bed with a succession of hard-to-distinguish lovers (generally in pursuit of some political gain).  But even this grows joyless very quickly.  CZJ's boy toys are so drab, listless, and ugly that one wonders what the producers were thinking.  Even the bodice-buster elements in ""Young Catherine"" at least featured a more attractive male lead.

The so-called battle scenes are pathetic: a tiny handful of extras milling about in confusion.  The Turks are beaten several times in inexplicable affairs (all fought in the woods, no less) that last about thirty seconds each.  A subplot involving a rebellious Cossack chieftain (capably played by John Rys-Davies -- the Welsh are taking over Mother Russia!)  should have added drama but instead only adds to the confusion regarding Catherine's true motivations.  Earlier in the movie, when she's casually seizing power (coups were never so clean and easy as presented here), she announces her desire to free Russia's serfs; by movie's end, she is blithely executing her enemies in defence of the status quo.  No explanations for this apparent sea-change are given.  And we're supposed to find this character sympathetic?  It's typical of this film's  confused treatment of  real history and people.  There's no depth of characterization or feel for the intrigues and struggles of the times.  And several scenes have been shamelessly stolen from other movies such as ""Young Catherine"" and ""Waterloo"".

It's a lazy, unengaging movie that offers little.  Seek out the witty, intelligent, and lavish ""Young Catherine"" (which was actually filmed IN Russia) instead if you want to see a genuinely entertaining historical drama.",983836800,69,2304,5.201086956521739
1388429,3,B0000524F3,"Do you ever remember seeing a 6 part series about Peter the Great about 10 years ago - you know, the one with an aged Laurence Olivier playing the King of England? Well I thoughtthat was great. I think this is trying to be the same but failing miserably! I feel that this film was once a mini series that has been whittled down to be made into a film - er sorry ""movie"" for the non-Brits reading this review. It shows. The beginning is not so good. There is a tarty performance by Zeta Jones who just wants ""the love of a real man"". Oh please! I'm going to throw up! But to give the movie its due, it does pick up and get more interesting as political inytrigue ensues. Ian Richardson is playing his usual role as a shady poilitician, Omar Sherrif is there as an ageing sex symbol, Brian Blessed is playing a fat bloke with a beard - nothing original there either but what the hell Henry out of nieghbours is in it for I don't know. He is the worst actor in this movie! Zeta Jones is definitely very sexy, though. But that has nothing to do withthe merits of the movie. Conclusion.

SEARCH TITTLE ""Katharina die Groe (Grosse)""

It is a 2 DVD collection with both English and German language.
NOW FOR THE BAD NEWS GIVING IT ONLY 3 STARS FROM ME(not for the film, but for AMAZON.DE): The cost of the actual DVD is less than $15 US, but AMAZON.DE will only ship via AmazonGlobal Express-Zustellung to the US, which brings the actual price up to over $40!
LUCKY FOR ME, I have a nephiew in the service stationed in Germany. Shipped it to him (free shipping), and he is sending it to me). THE OTHER PROBLEM is the microsoft Bing translator will not auto translate once you get into the purchase pages, so you have to manually cut/paiste from AMAZON to the BING transulator!
p.s. Anyone buying JUST for the Zeta-Jones sex scene, save your money & use Bing video. You can find the full uncut scene there (about 5 min)!

REVIEW TRANSLATED FROM AMAZON.DE (http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0001YIE26/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1):
 The two-piece, 1995 turned film is somewhat casually about Russian history. This changes nothing, that the intrigue and infighting in a European manufacturer shear House are impressively represented by the actors and actresses. The same applies to the splendour and misery, which stood side by side at that time. A documentary film was never intended. The lead plays the then largely unknown guys actress Catherine Zeta-Jones, and thus achieved a career breakthrough. Famous actors such as for example, Omar Sharif (doctor-Schiwago) play supporting roles. We have basically to do it with a successful historical drama.
On the main disc, you will find the two parts (struggle for the throne; Between duty and passion) with either English or German sound. Subtitles are not found. The second disc contains a roughly 30-minute making-of film, which offers some interesting insights into the shooting with some brief comments from actresses and actors, Director, a living German counts and relative of Empress, and other people. More Extras is not available. This is somewhat a pity, would have it but worth it, to record a historic context to the person of Catherine on the obviously not filled special disc.",1372636800,,2198,5.168539325842697
1388488,2,B0000524F3,This movie is very poor unfortunately. It is low budget and the acting leaves a lot to be desired. I would not recommend it.,1362441600,,124,4.208333333333333
1388489,2,B0000524F3,"This was not so great.

Pros:
The political intrigues were interesting.
The clothing and sets were well done.

Cons:
The McGann brothers look so much alike that I couldn't tell that they were two different people until halfway through the movie. That was really confusing.

For a movie about Catherine ""the Great,"" it didn't show anything about what made her great. The movie didn't portray the magnitude of the accomplishments she had and didn't show some of the most important ones.

The writing seemed soap opera level. The characters had no depth at all. The movie started when Catherine was 15, then you start to see that she develops some political savvy. However, she seems to remain at the level of a novice throughout.

I had high expectations. The film did not deliver.",1360195200,,779,4.827067669172933

1388491,1,B0000524F3,"This was one of the worst I've ever seen. Gross historical inaccuracies, little or none of it shot on location, dialog that would make a soap opera look good. Absolutely horrible. If you're a Zeta-Jones fan, you'll be wondering why on earth she agreed to make this film. The whole thing is disjointed and jumps around so much, it's difficult to follow, even when you know what actually happened, like I do. Skip it!",1323648000,5,415,4.621621621621622
1388512,1,B0000524F3,How disappointing to watch this absolute farcical reconstruction of this great monarch's life. Very poorly acted by a cast of wooden puppets. Catherine Zeta Jones is awful with as much emotion as a stone. Wish I hadn't bothered,1320105600,,227,5.0
1388513,1,B0000524F3,"Once again A&E have cut out a lot of the movie. Originally it is supposed to be 180 minutes but they cut it down to 80 minutes which just ruined the movie because it didn't really show the abitious side of Catherine. I do not know why A&E keep doing this. First it happened to Charles: power and passion now this. I advice everyone not to purchase this produce unless you want to waste your money. Rating this movie 1/5 is a compliment, it is not even worthy to give it 1 after all this cut off. IF you are a history buff, wait till the version that is not by A&E. That one is far better and shows the true side of Catherine. I hope this helps future buyers.",1309910400,12,658,4.069230769230769

1388515,2,B0000524F3,"Who wouldn't enjoy watching the lovely Catherine Zeta-Jones demonstrate her art but the film itself fell flat by my standards--not rich enough in its portrayal of the Czarina's political prowess, her relationship with her predecessor and the horrible Duke she married, or the landscape of that period in history--too bad really.",1296259200,,328,5.450980392156863

1388518,1,B0000524F3,"Catherine the Great is one of the most colossal and legendary figures of Russian and Western history.  And this movie does her absolutely no favors, not to mention the gross historical liberties taken to push this disjointed aznd rotten ""fairy tale"" along.

True, the costuming and interior shots are lush and generally well done.  But the acting and wooden script can be most charitably characterized as ""horrible.""  Zeta-Jones turns in a wooden performance as a kind of Russian ""barbie doll"" that does her subject no credit, and the young actor playing Potemkin falls into the same trap.  He is less intellectual powerhouse than moody and wishy-washy to the point of just being plain annoying.  And John Rhys-Davies, in my opinion, rather just walked around looking embarassed. Further, the historical Catherine never met Pugachev, and was far less a bed-hopper than the script portrays, altough Zeta-Jones manages here and there to capture a glimmer of Catherine's powerful intellect as well as her sometime intellectual pretentiousness.  And the main focus and contribution of Catherine's amazing life - her reformist zeal, legislative genius, but ultimate failure of Enlightenment vision - is barely touched on at all.  All in all, it's a crashing, sophomoric bore.  And with a subject that interesting, that's unforgiveable.

A very bad movie on too many levels to adequately detail here.  Avoid.",1249257600,10,1402,5.27027027027027

I am glad we still have the old version on Video and if anyone has that version (ie THE COMPLETE Mini Series) with NO great missing Chunks, I would be keen to buy it.

I liked Catherine Zeta Jones and most of the acting although I did notice some that was very obviously ""pretend"" fighting.

1388558,1,B0000524F3,"""He loves me. He loves me. He really loves me,"" is just one example of this melodrama's inferior dialogue. This may be A&E, but it's no Andrew Davies production. Regardless of the presence of some very good names in the cast, the acting is incredibly superficial. ""Catherine the Great"" is merely a spectacle to dazzle its viewers with Zeta-Jones' beauty and a series of ornate sets and costumes. There is no time or depth committed to relationships between characters or important events. Battle scenes show comical swordfighting choreography . This film is an insult to fans of historical period dramas. I'm about ready to sell this one back. Not recommended.",1127260800,15,660,5.009090909090909
1388559,2,B0000524F3,"What a waste of money and talent! To begin with, Catherine Zeta-Jones should never have been cast as Catherine. She may be pretty and nice to watch in the campy sex-scenes but that's it. She couldn't handle this complex and GREAT character but reduces her to a slutty bitch in corsets. (Pardon my language) Maybe it's the script, the actress or the director but with the leading lady of this movie being so horribly miscast the entire movie goes downhill. The script is campy and not based on the real facts, romping between the sheets seems to be the single focus here. If you want to see Catherine played by a beautiful woman who CAN act, get ""Young Catherine"" with the wonderful Julia Ormond instead.",1113696000,5,703,4.632

1388561,3,B0000524F3,"Okay, I probably liked watching CZJ more that I would have the real CTG, but surely there must be actresses who could have played the role better.  It's a shame we couldn't peel (sorry, I couldn't resist) a few decades off of Diana Rigg, or CZJ's co-star Jeanne Moreau, or better still, Francesca Annis. Get ""Lillie"" and watch Annis and a much better supporting cast (and direction and production) put CTG to shame (and they did it a quarter-century earlier) in a MUCH better costume show about a young woman who starts as an unsophisticated teen and conquers a man's world, royalty and all.  Annis is a lot more believable as she charms, beguiles, teases, scorns, tolerates, manipulates, and sometimes frostily discards kings, princes, artists, ministers, captains of commerce, seemingly whatever men she chooses -- all this without being a princess, czarina, or empress.  The boss ladies in ""I Claudius"" and Lindsay Duncan in ""Traffik"" likewise showed how it should be done.  The fake duchess in ""Hornblower"" and the perfect cast of ""Pride and Prejudice"" show that A & E can find great actresses now.  Why didn't they do it here?  For instance, the actress who played CTG's lady-in-waiting could probably have done a lot more with the lead role.

The one star performance is by Jeanne Moreau as the aging / dying Empress Elizabeth.  Too bad she's gone before the movie's half over.  Ian Richardson is satisfactorily sly and slimy, but Omar Sharif helps prove that actors, like wines, do not all age well (sorry to say that about a fellow bridge freak).  The role of Potemkin could have been so much greater than the hardly believable boy-toy play it got.

This movie is worth watching because it depicts highly significant times and events often ignored in the US as we focus on our late colonial and early revolutionary events occurring about the same time.  Also, for the guys, sure, CZJ is definitive delicious brunette yumminess (but Sophia was better), and we get lotsa good cleavage shots, but in a skin flick, I want more skin.",1004832000,9,2036,4.835734870317003
