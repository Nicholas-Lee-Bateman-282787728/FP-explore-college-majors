8587409,5,B00CXWV81I,"Great video, very simple instruction ..This method has helped me greatly. Not only has it helped with ball striking and my overall golf game ,it has really helped with back issues. Give this simple an honest chance and effort and I believe that you will be rewarded, I have much more confidence in my ball striking and am having a lot more fun now that I feel more capable.",1428710400,,373,4.420289855072464

8587412,1,B00CXWV81I,Very disappointed. Ballard talks about the triangle and Rocco Mediate hits balls and tells you how easy it is. No real instruction.,1411603200,,131,5.0
8587413,1,B00CXWV81I,"Great ideas here but not one thing different than can be found on You Tube.  No exercises, no drills - Just Rocco and Jimmy Ballard talking.  Very disappointing",1405814400,2,160,4.678571428571429
8587414,5,B00CXWV81I,"Mr Ballard is the best golf instructor ever, PERIOD ! His track record is proof of it. The presentation on this video is sole and straightforward. Enjoy a legend !",1402876800,,163,4.466666666666667
8587415,5,B00CXWV81I,"The DVD is only about 40 minutes long. I usually prefer 90 minutes at least, but that's because most golf DVDs have a lot of fluff. This DVD has none. It's basically a conversation between Rocco Mediate and Jimmy Ballard on the golf swing. Great information.",1402444800,,258,4.630434782608695
8587416,5,B00CXWV81I,"The concept seemed simple and when I went to the golf course, my contact and distance improved.  This dvd is a keeper.",1373414400,3,118,4.363636363636363
8587417,5,B00CXWV81I,"I first was introduced to Jimmy Ballard's ""Connection"" back in the 80's.  I had his book as well as hisvideo tape.  I was alot younger then with little patience.  There were no instructors in my area who taught his method, and I kind of slipped away from it.  But, I was forever coming ascross tips and articles in the golf magazines that articulated what Jimmy had said.  Recently, I pulled out that old video.  I was grateful that I still happened to have a working VHS player still around in the garage.  I started watching it again.  Then I went to Amazon and found this DVD.  It all came back to me with the clarity that I had not experienced before.  In 3 weeks I started swinging and hitting balls better than ever.  Rocco Mediate and Jimmy nailed it for me.  I have played golf for almost 50 yrs.  I am enjoying it now better than I ever have before.  An old dog can learn old tricks with the right instruction",1372723200,6,918,4.292397660818714
