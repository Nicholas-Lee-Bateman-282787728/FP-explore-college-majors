7912144,4,B00000JGD6,"Okay, I've seen this movie several times and have always liked it, but I also think I understand why others might not. Some key points:

1.) It's NOT a thriller. No high suspense, jump scares or grisly gore (some coarse language and mob violence, but pretty tame by today's standards).

2.) It is much more a romance, one-sided and slow-to-build, between a small-time nobody stuck in a bad situation (Johnny), and the quietly beautiful bartender who witnesses a deadly mob shakedown (Tracy). He falls for her, she's wary, and then he *has* to kidnap her and lock her up in an abandoned loft, in order to save her life. Naturally she's upset, and subverts/manipulates most of his affections. Great stuff.

3.) Time and style: it is set in modern times (Toronto subbing for Brooklyn, circa 1999), but the music is all 40's swing, as is the dancing in an early scene at Tracy's bar.

4.) Anyone expecting any graphic (sex/nudity/violence/whatever) will be disappointed. There are love scenes, but most are part of a boring sub-plot about Johnny being forced to date the mob boss's whiny god-daughter; the few good Tracy scenes are brief, and tastefully done.

5.) Naomi Campbell as Tracy, playing (almost) against type. Yes, she's strong-willed, resentful, and manipulative, but also shy, innocent, and quietly brilliant. It's a fun cat-and-mouse game watching the two of them learn to trust one another, and happily she's just beautiful to watch.

6.) The plot. It does falter a bit at the end (the cops couldn't match Johnny's prints?) but, as I've said before, this feels much more like an old-time noir, set in the present day. (Perhaps ""Key Largo"" meets ""The Bodyguard""? That's just a poor/vague suggestion, others can probably do better.)

So, that's my take on this unusual and under-appreciated film. Not A-list caliber, but definitely worthy of a rental, at the very least. And the songs are great.",1441152000,,1904,4.9498432601880875
7912145,3,B00000JGD6,"Synopsis: Just imagine if you will going out to an unassuming night spot for a drink or two and discovering Naomi Campbell is your bartender, be still my heart! Well, that's kind of what happens to Johnny, a hired thug for a despicable loan shark who enters the bar with a couple of his cronies looking for a poor unfortunate soul behind on his loan payments. However when Johnny spots the exotic Tracy (Naomi Campbell) he nearly forgets about why he's there and sets up a late date with her after hours. Unfortunately as Tracy waits alone in the early morning hours for Johnny to pick her up at the bar entrance Johnny's partners murder the man they were looking for right in front of her.

Since Tracy is the only witness to the crime she is now targeted for death and as you might have guessed Johnny is assigned the task of ""taking care of her"". With no other options available, Johnny kidnaps Tracy and locks her up in a deserted warehouse trying to buy time until a better idea surfaces. Will Johnny be able to save the lovely Tracy and himself or is he only prolonging the inevitable? Wouldn't you try to say her, I mean come on it's Naomi Campbell?

Critique: Believe it or not the '99 film 'Prisoner of Love'  is better than you would've guessed. First and foremost of note is being able to watch the ebony lioness Naomi Campbell move sleekly back and forth in front of the camera. Absolutely beautiful! While she is not known for her acting skill the parameters of her role are geared perfectly for her natural abilities; an alluring glance, an occasional hint of a smile and intermittent pouts here and there. Then of course there's that raging, explosive temper she exhibits as she tries to escape from her captive. Throwing furniture around the room and screaming is a form of method acting I understand Naomi is quite familiar with. Her dedication to the art has borne some fruit after all.

Outside of the presence of Naomi there's not too much to offer the audience here. The story works for a while but you're ready for the finale long before it finally arrives. I also found the soundtrack to be somewhat disconcerting. The music is a compilation of mellow jazz from the beatnik era and tunes you might find in a 50's senior lounge. Very strange musical selections in my opinion.",1224547200,6,2297,4.567961165048544
7912146,2,B00000JGD6,"This film is definitely not what you'd call good. It's like a cheap porno flick without the sex.
Johnny ( Eric Thal ) is a hitman who's never made a hit.  On his way with his mob buddies to "" whack "" someone he meets up with a beautiful bartender ( the luscious Naomi Campbell ) in a jazz club and falls instantly in love with her. The two set a date but complications arise in their relationship when Johnny stands up Tracy ( Campbell ) to complete the hit he was supposed to do in the first place. Tracy witnesses the murder. When his Uncle Walt orders Johnny to kill Tracy he decides to lock her up in a dingy warehouse until the heat cools down.  All the while Tracy is begging for freedom while Johnny goes off performing unsuccessful mob duties.  Of course, as suspected good wins over bad and Johnny comes out as the good guy after all. He and Tracy reunite at the end of the film and proclaim their love.
This film is slighty entertaining but nothing to watch unless you observed the chemistry between Thal and Campbell and could fully appreciate it. They have excellent chemistry but for a romance movie there is no romance. Tracy and Johnny spend their scenes whining about the mob instead of brewing an interesting love story.  By the middle of the film you'll get sick of that warehouse and end up not caring if Tracy gets out or not. This may not be the worse film in the world but it's certainly not good. And you'll spend most of it wondering why you decided to watch it in the first place.  But who knows?  You may like it.",1086220800,6,1539,4.289655172413793
