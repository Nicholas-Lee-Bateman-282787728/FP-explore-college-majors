6028104,5,B00FRDYQKU,"I grew up watching Audie in about all his westerns and enjoyed them all. Not only was Audie a war hero but a western hero also. Audie was one of those who gave it his best it seemed to me like. You also have to like westerns to enjoy this movie, as for me it is hard to enjoy a western made today. Back in the 50's & 60's I tried to watch all the westerns available on black & white TV. Now you can buy about all of them that you missed out on because of only 3 channels.",1401753600,2,471,3.72
6028105,4,B00FRDYQKU,Audie Murphy was not only the most decorated hero of World War II (see To Hell & Back starring Audie Murphy as himself) but the King of the B-Western. Just try to buy bullett for a badman.,1398729600,,188,4.108108108108108

6028108,5,B00FRDYQKU,I just finished watching the movie Ride a Crooked Trail and I have to admit the movie is very enjoyable to watch. The dvd quality is excellent and I would recommend the movie to anyone who enjoys a good action packed western. The confilcts which occur in the movie can really speak for themselves when people are at a crossroads with decisions they need to make in life. A truly entertaining film.,1376611200,2,397,4.527777777777778

6028111,4,B00FRDYQKU,"Ya gotta love an Audie Murphy movie!  I love Audie Murphy movies.  My top three cowboy heros; John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart and Audie Murphy.  Ya just can't get any better.

This flick is another good cowboy movie that Audie did.  It doesn't matter what the plot is...Audie did the acting in his own great way and got the bad guy, won the girl and saved the day.  Ya just can't get much better.  Cookie cutters in this case... are not important.  It's  Audie.  Ya gotta love the guy and this movie.  Go buy it.  It will make you feel good.",1353110400,5,535,4.24
6028112,4,B00FRDYQKU,"the opening credits and theme song are banal - but then it opens upon a chase scene - before settling into a town run by - get this - Walter Matthau - that's how you can tell you're in for a offbeat treat

i saw this film as a kid - and i still remember the scene where the wounded Matthau walks off - with Murphy asking ""Why doesn't he fall down""

the script is jokey - but with a lot of fresh twists - the story breaks a new trail - one that Audie had never been down before

this has perhaps Audie's best supporting cast - and that helps make this one of Murphy's best westerns - besides Matthau - there's gorgeous Gia Scala making the most of the 2-dimensional role of Murphy's faux wife - slimey Henry Silva as the baddie - and pretty Joanna Moore in a small role of a dance hall girl - seeing her and Gia face off is as good as any gunfight

fun and interesting - this is not a B western - it's a B+ one",1349308800,9,909,3.870967741935484

6028127,5,B00FRDYQKU,"People today don't remember how good Audie Murphy was in his many Western films.  Audie is cool, calm, and collected facing down the bad guys; likeable as a somewhat bad guy coming around to do good.  Join us on the trail as find out how good it is to go back to the old West.  You will enjoy the journey.",1417478400,,305,4.05

6028130,1,B00FRDYQKU,"I take responsibility on myself for not reading the whole specs on the package, but WHY does Amazon offer Region 2 DVD's  without a clear warning that it is not a Region 1 DVD. I just thought that Non USA meant that it wasn't manufactured here.
I didn't notice a problem until I put it in the player. Now I have an open package that I can't return. I went back into my wish list and found several more of the non USA and deleted them from the list.
Word of warning, make sure you read all the specs.

8618240,4,B00FRDYQKU,"This is an enjoyable easy to watch 1950s type western. Audie Murphy plays a criminal who is pursued by a famed marshal. His horse is shot. He hid by a cliff. When the marshal follows him, the marshal falls to his death. Audie takes his horse and rides into town. The local judge discovers the marshal's badge in his saddle bag and thinks that Audie is the marshal. Audie does not reveal the truth. The judge makes Audie the town sheriff.
A woman he knew previously shows up and he is able to persuade her to act as his wife. Then, a gang leader, who is the boyfriend of this woman, shows up who plans to rob the bank. The film raises the questions: Will Audie give up his past? Will the judge accept him as sheriff when he learns the truth about Audie? Will Audie stop the bank robbery and, if so, how? Will he win the woman who was friends with the bank robber and marry her?",1519257600,,876,4.189349112426036
