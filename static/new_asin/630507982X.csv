puts on the shoes and starts back in on the kung fu is when I had to stop to write this, because it was just too much. The plot could be (better)composed by a mentally disabled dog, and the acting would also likely be better if they were all canines. I can't imagine any type of alternate universe where this could be compared to the Matrix as one viewer suggested. In any event, if you are really, really desperate for something to watch, or are just a glutton for punishment, I'd still suggest watching something else.",1364169600,,711,4.313432835820896

I payed 30 bucks on amazon for a copy.  Wish it was a tad more clearer before paying 30 bucks for a Chinese copy of this disc.  This is not the uk version as pictured on this site -- I can tell ya that much.  The movie itself is merely, I assume, a copy of the UK DVD so I'm not too angry about this purchase.  It's what's inside that counts...I'm still annoyed that I payed 30 bucks for a Chinese copy of the UK version of Steve Wang's DRIVE (pictured on this amazon page) complete with typos on the box: ""SPECIAL 116 MINUTE UNCUT VESION""

962276,4,630507982X,"At first, I was going to launch into this brilliant diatribe about how some action movies are like porn: Most of the movie is just filler between action scenes, so you keep your finger on the fast-forward button to get to the good stuff. But a funny thing happened on the way to the review: I found that instead of fast-forwarding, I kept rewinding to see stuff again. Although ""Drive"" is an American movie, it deserves special recognition for capturing the spirit and the lightning-fast action of a true HK martial-arts film. As such, it stands head and shoulders above the steaming pile of cheesy American ""martial-arts"" straight-to-video junk.

There is at least one porn parallel, however: As with porn, the plot is not important. In a nutshell, Toby Wong (Dacascos) escapes the company that ""enhanced"" him with a ""bio-engine,"" which gives him a not particularly logical excuse for his superhuman skills. He takes Malik (Hardison) hostage and forces him to drive from San Francisco to Los Angeles so Toby can sell the bio-engine to a rival company. On the way, they fight and get shot at. A lot. Works for me.

Mark Dacascos was simply amazing in the role--as a martial artist, that is. I like the guy, I think he has charisma, but as an actor he just doesn't command the screen. As a fighter, however, he rocks the house (probably the only reason, besides Kelly Hu, to see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cradle-2-the-Grave/dp/B00009Q98I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cradle 2 the Grave</a>). Kadeem Hardison is again relegated to sidekick status (as he would be later in the made-for-TV ""Red Skies""), but it seems to be where he shines. His interaction with Dacascos, and particularly his ad-libs, were the best reason to not hit the fast-forward button. John Pyper-Ferguson continues (not disappointingly) to play his ""Briscoe County, Jr."" character, and Brittany Murphy, at her bubbly, crazy best, pops up just in time to take part in an extended garage fight scene that puts to shame every fight scene in every American-made martial-arts film ever. And I'm not just saying that because I'm drunk. With power. Would you believe that it was a Japanese stunt team (and not HK) that pulled this off?

Steve Wang (""The Guyver"") directs with a sure hand. The cinematography is notable, with interesting angles, lots of camera movement and near-perfect editing. The indoor lighting could have been better, though--as it stands, the bar scenes look a little too straight-to-video, with too many reds and blues. I do have to wonder about the (original) cover picture, though: At no time in the movie does Dacascos wear jeans, and at no time does Hardison wear an afro and a mustache (instead, he sports his trademark dreadlocks and 5-day beard). Really, a movie this good deserves a better box cover. Well, I guess it's better than renting a bad movie with a good box.",1329609600,,2908,5.066805845511483

962323,5,630507982X,"Do not call yourself a fan of Mark Dacascos if you have not seen this movie. The man who brought capoeira to Hollywood, portrayed both video game and comic book heroes, and battled zombies and a mythological monster or two didn't really come out of his martial shell until he teamed up with director Steve Wang (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Guyver-2/dp/B0002A2VNM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Guyver 2</a>) and ex-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Different-World/dp/B0009HBPEO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Different World</a>&nbsp;star Kadeem Hardison, and until you see him in full action mode here, you haven't seen anything yet. His proficiency in martial arts - merely glimpsed in films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Samurai/dp/B000AYEL3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Samurai</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crying-Freeman/dp/B000L5K3QU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crying Freeman</a>&nbsp;- come full scale in ""Drive"", making it the cumulative action package as far as Dacascos' career is concerned and definitely one of the better non-Hong Kong kung fu flicks I have seen.

The story: Toby Wong (Dacascos) is a super soldier prototype on the run from his creators. Hounded by hitmen, he's forced to take struggling song-writer Malik Brody (Hardison) captive and, with his help, try to escape across America. Little does he know that if the guns-for-hire fail, his malicious creator (James Shigeta,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard/dp/B000O77SRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard</a>) has a secret weapon he will employ to retrieve his loose creation...

By all means, ""Drive"" is a dumb action movie: kung fu and explosions take precedence over drama, the script is so loose that I ended up with the impression that the open-ended climax wasn't intentional but that the filmmakers simply realized they had to end the movie at some time and this was as good a place as any. Nevertheless, the film is very aware of its genre and doesn't bother trying to appear very intelligent or overly important - it's merely fun for fun's sake, and great fun at that. The action isn't watered down with unnecessary editing or CGI, the storyline's pace is free-spirited rather than sloppy, and the characters are colorful despite not being especially defined - particularly demonstrated by the Tarantino-esque bounty hunter John Pyper-Ferguson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Dawn/dp/B000BRBA92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Dawn</a>) and the delightfully insane Brittany Murphy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/8-Mile/dp/B00005JLQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">8 Mile</a>).

Indeed, though he's obligated to fill the 'funny black guy' stereotype, Kadeem Hardison proves himself a legitimate comedy actor and saves Mark Dacascos thematically as much as much as Dacascos saves him within the plot. In this sense, the two are a great duo: Hardison talks the talk while Dacascos beats the snot out of people in ways that rival Jackie Chan and Jet Li. There are six fights within the movie, two of which exceed five minutes in length and all of which are fast-paced and filled with plenty of jumping kicks, sweeps, weapons, and utilization of the environment to make the brawls more interesting. The action content culminates with a one-two encounter in a club wherein Dacascos takes on attackers on motorcycles before squaring off against an advanced soldier model (Masaya Kato,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brother/dp/B00005RYKV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brother</a>) in a fight that most definitely influenced the battles of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B000P0J0AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>. Despite the frequent presence of an obvious stunt double, Mark still shines by taking full advantage of being given carte blanche to show off his abilities. These fights are eye-openers.

Shot for under $3 million, ""Drive"" is an excellent example of how very good direct-to-video cinema can be when an effort is made. Other than a single obvious green screen explosion, there are absolutely no indications that this movie was made cheaply. I can honestly say that this may very well be the single best film Mark has ever starred in, and both devotees and kung fu fans in general ought not be without this movie under any circumstances. Yes, I know it may cost more than the average DVD, but don't let this deter you - it's 100% worth it.",1245715200,2,4783,6.563291139240507
962324,4,630507982X,"I never thought a film with simply the title of ""Drive"" would have such good martial arts action.  Yes, Mark Dacascos stars in Drive, but the choreography and intensity of the fights is unlike anything I have evr seen him do before.  Only The Strong is maybe the closest Mark gets with the Capoeira fighitng style in that movie.  In Drive, it is obvious that wires are used quite a bit, but the results are Matrix-like effects that outdo alot of the compeition such as Romeo Must Die and The One.  Mark's fighting is also combined with stunts in Drive, sometimes even resembling Jackie Chan.

The story is basically a no-brainer, where the main charcater (Toby Wong - Mark Dacascos) is always on the run from the bad guys.  Once involved with a corporation in Hong Kong, Toby has fled to America carrying a high-tech piece of equipment in his chest that makes him nearly invulnerable.  The corporation wants it back, sending a fleet of men after Toby, including another super-unit, played by Masayo Kato.  While I am not familiar with him as a martial artist, his skills were quite impressive as well.

Other main characters include Malik Brody played by Kadeem Hardison, who provides the comic relief throughout the film accompanied with some agression of his own.  Surprisingly, some of the humor was actually funny, for I don't expect B-action movies to make me laugh very much.  Brittany Murphy plays ""Delieverance"", another person who gets tangled up in Toby's mess in the film.  Her charcater is just silly, weird, and ditsy - running around laughing with a gun in her hand like its a game.  Oh well.

Its the action that makes this movie most memorable, and makes it one of Mark Dacasco's absolute best.  Long and plenty of action scenes fill the movie, right down to the exciting final fight that is just beautiful, set in a night club.  Mark Dacascos fans will love this, and a fan of wonderful choreogprahy will love it even more.",1181865600,,1940,4.695266272189349
962325,4,630507982X,"I love this movie, AWESOME choreographed fight scenes that are very well filmed, great humor, and how can you say no to a love crazed Brittany Murphy and great martial arts! :)",1177113600,,176,4.53125
962326,4,630507982X,"The plot of this movie allows the underrated actor, Dacascos, to truly show off what a major talent he his.  All the different body twists and turns in the movies.  He must have been particularly exhausted.  I can only imagine how many times he had to repeat those scenes.  And then a lot of his moves corresponded like a robot.  And I'd hear people rave about ""the first green ranger's"" moves, Jason David Frank, and granted he's superb at karate, but after seeing this, Dacascos is unbelieveable.  Someone on imdb even was gutsy enough to say that he was better than Jet Lee!

It's ashame this movie didn't hit mainstream even though the storyline is a bit off sometimes.  The plot is meant to be weird to keep the story interesting, but when Brittany Murphy and Hardison come in to play, it is just totally off the wall.  It's so random that its supposed to be funny, but to some it will come off as just plain stupid and just put together so fast to place another character in.  Other characters who you think might be dead might not quite be, and they randomly show up.  It happens in lots of movies.  So it's not particularly eye catching to me.

The disco they were at and some of the other locales really melded in with the story well.

People keep saying how Dacascos should be in karate movies, but maybe a movie more like a Terminator would show another side of his acting.  His moves in this movie show that he could probably make a Terminator 4 do better thatn T3 and maybe even T1 (not T2 cause that just caught on to ""the mainstream"" like it was the thing to watch of all time).  Part of this karate thing is obviously his moves, but even within his physical features.  On the cover, he looks like say maybe Cole Hauser a bit or something like that, but then when you see the movie, it looks like he has Asian roots as well a bit.  With other Japanese characters in the movie, that only helps invigorate the karate phenomenon you see come out of watching this movie.

You'd think the movie is an action movie by looking at the cover, and it is, but it is an off kilter comedy in disguise as well.",1145059200,3,2111,4.325699745547074
962327,5,630507982X,"I first came across this movie one night, flipping through the movie channels late into the AM. I recognized Mark Dacascos from Only the Strong (which I loved), and kept watching.

And I could not turn away.

Mark Dacascos is a phenomenal martial artist, and this is one of very few movies that really just allowed him to go all out, and use all his skills. Only the Strong is another one. Movies like Kickboxer 5, Cradle to the Grave, and others only show off a tiny, tiny bit of what this guy is capable of. If you want to see the true extent of his talent - watch THIS movie.

The fight scenes are amazing, the choreography is unbelievable, and the story isn't bad. I love this movie.

962409,5,630507982X,"This movie is a Tour De Force for Mark Dacascos. You get to see him show everything that he has only shown glimpses of before. If you think Bruce Lee is fast, you haven't seen anything yet. Jet Li wishes he could be this acrobatic. Considering this is Mark's first attempt at a full fledged Hong Kong style action film, he is truly amazing not only in the fact that he pulls it off so well, but that he pulls it off better than the people who have been doing it for much longer. Even the most seasoned martial arts fan will find themselves saying wow more than once.
The story centers around Mark's character, Toby Wong, escaping China and coming to America to have a biological uprgrade surgically planted in his chest remeoved. It increases the power of the person it's in. One shouldn't expect anything enlightening from the script, it's meant to be a vehicle (pun, semi intended) for showing off martial arts action. But there is a scene in the director's cut where Mark  shows his acting range. It involved Toby discussing his relationship with his girlfriend, which I won't reveal so as to not ruin things. It also succeeds in being incredibly funny, with Mark playing the straight man to Kadeem Hardison's character. The rest of the cast get's in some good lines too and if you're not a snob who expects all your movies to have subtitles and deal with subject matter that would be deemed garbage if it was the same product made in Hollywood minus the captions, then this is a movie for you.
I highly recommend seeking out the versions that are uncut or have the deleted scenes and interviews. There's some extra action, but most of it involves showing the backstory on the characters as well as additionl humorous scenes. The only thing that bothers me is that the music that was in the cut version is more intersting to me. There's not much info available on the recent re-release of this movie and it appears to not have any extras. Look for the cover that show's Mark and Kadeem in a full body shot if you want the special edition.",1077494400,9,2041,4.5162162162162165

DRIVE is action packed from the beginning, in reality one big long kickfest.  But Mark Dacascos is awesome to watch and his silent, grim countenance melts at times into a boyish grin; his work with Kadeem Hardison is fun to watch, and Brittany Murphy's Deliverance is one of the funniest femme fatales to grace the screen.  Alternately goofy and attempting to be sexually alluring, Murphy is a doll and buoys the movie significantly.

962413,5,630507982X,"Mark Dacascos is getting some acknowlegdement with The Brotherhood of the Wolf being released in US theatres, but Drive is by far his best film. Drive is probably the closest thing to the Matrix considering the science fiction, martial arts, and action aspect. I still feel Matrix was overall a better movie, but the martial art display of Mark Dacascos in Drive totally outshines anything Keanu ever did. Mark plays Toby Wong who is running from a powerful Red China corporation because he is carrying a special big-tech bio-weapon prototype inside his chest, which they want back. The device greatly improves his physical performance, speed and reactions and is worth millions of dollars. Kadeem Harrison who plays Malik Brody gets caught in the middle of all this and ends up being on the run with Toby. The interactions between these two are very reminincent of Rush Hour. For once, Kadeem is not that annoying and provides some good humour and Mark acts like a total foreigner. They head towards LA to find buyers that will pay 5 million dollars for the device, which Toby and Malik will split. Bunch of baddies are sent after them, and what you get is martial arts galore. Mark is in total top form here and shows probably his best stuff. This movie started off kind of pg-13ish, but the rated R violence started to show after awhile and it is such a guilty pleasure. This film is probably the first or one of the very few Hong Kong style movie that was filmed in America that was filmed right. Which version to get? The only version of Drive you should get is the Region 2 PAL version. This version is by the Hong Kong Legends distributors and is remastered (audio and video) and most importantly it is uncut. The American version, if you can find it, has approx. 16 minutes of footage taken out. What footage, I have no clue, but who wants a cut film especially if its 16 minutes of probably action footage? All I can say is that this is an awesome movie to own, and it should get more recognition. It was the winner of Minami Toshiko (critics) award at the Yubari International Fantastic Adventure Film Festival and also Winner of Best International Film Award at the 3rd Annual Fant-Asia Festival in Montreal etching out Jackie Chan's Drunken Master 2 that year. Of course, I still think Drunken Master 2 is better, but it gives you an idea how great Drive is as well. Go check it out!!! Other great Mark Dacascos films are Crying Freeman (awesome), Brotherhood of the Wolf, and Only the Strong...hope this and my other HK movie reviews are helpful...laters",1019692800,33,2567,4.656387665198238

Dacascos shows that in this movie he can move just as fast as the other martial arts heavyweights which is now paying off with his role in Brotherhood of the Wolf. He is very acrobatic combining alot of moves from alot of different styles. Though the not so good plot of this movie only takes up maybe 20% of this movie, believe me the other 80% of fighting is off the hook.

962415,5,630507982X,"I give this movie 5 stars not because it should win movie of the year, but this is one of the best Martial Arts movies I have seen. Kadeem Hardison adds some comdeic spots to the movie. Brittany Murphy is fun to watch also, as long as you don't take this movie too seriously. But the highlight of this movie is the Martial Arts. Imagine Matrix with a real martial artist doing the fight scences and fight-scenes are everywhere in this movie! The fight scenes are fast, well-choreographed, slick and well-executed! This movie has some of the coolest fight scenes I have EVER seen, and I've seen A LOT! So, take this movie for what it is, a Martial Arts movie with plenty of fight scenes and a plot that isn't great but not horrible either. If this was a big budget movie, and the same plot with Mark Dacascos (or Jet Li if it helps you to imagine it being brought to the Big Screen) and more special effects and same fight scences, you can bet if would have gotten the same buzz The Matrix did.
Did I mention the Martial Arts scenes in this movie are unbelievable!?",1010707200,,1064,4.351758793969849
962416,4,630507982X,"How often do you find yourself buying an HBO original movie. Definitely one of Dacasco's better movies, he constantly delivers a little something that my friend and I like to call A.S.O.P (A Steady Onslaught of Punches). Teamed up with Kadeem Hardison, who adds that extra oomph of humor, this is one of my favorite action movies. Don't look for anything original in the storyline. Man works for agency, man leaves agency, agency wants man dead, man runs, recruits and fights. But, it's a pretty good ride. I wasn't too thrilled with the sound quality of the DVD, though. It was recorded pretty low, so it sounds a little muffled, but it won't take too much away from the whole experience.",1006214400,,689,4.702479338842975

His exceptional fighting skills steal the show, but it has so much more. Mark plays a shy, chinese spy on the run. Kadeem Hardison is kidnapped by Mark while on the run. Their adventures together will keep you laughing 'til the very end. The fight scenes will amaze you. Take this film home for a test DRIVE and enjoy an evening of fun and action.",993254400,,463,4.523809523809524
962538,4,630507982X,"For American Martial-Arts fans, this version is probably the only way to go. Mark Dacascos is awesome as renegade Toby Wong, a man with a ""bio-engine"" attached to his heart. His improved physical capabilities give a good excuse for many exciting martial arts sequences that are as close to Jackie Chan as you will get in a western movie. Kadeem Hardison (""Dwayne Wayne"") lends support as the comic sidekick, and does a good job. Brittany Murphy (Clueless) is pretty much wasted in her role as a wacky teen, but runs with her material as far as it will carry her (and damn, is she hot while she does that!). John-Pyper Ferguson should be happy he didn't sustain permanent damage to his jaw for chewing the scenery so much, but it fits in with the film.
The real stars of this movie (apart from Dacascos, who is an impressive martial artist) are director Steve Wang, who has a firm grasp on the proceedings, and action director Koichi Sakamoto, who stages several hand-to-hand coflicts. Required viewing!!!!",989884800,3,1005,4.781609195402299
962539,5,630507982X,"Drive is some dank stuff. The fighting scenes in this movie are so radical dude. I have never seen such original fighting scenes and moves as in this film. I love how the characters react in the most totally unrealistic ways to far out situations. Like Kadeem Hardison trying to bite off a dead hand from a machine gun! The plot and acting, are of course top quality B movie standards. That probably couldn't get too much worse, but that's not important. The movie is really entertaining and I highly recommend it. Now if I could only find the soundtrack!  ""Where's the party at?! ho' ho'!!!""",985046400,,592,4.584905660377358

I was very entertained by the action but I wasn't impressed by his acting. He's much better in this movie. There's a ton of action and Dacascos Martial Arts moves are as visualy appealing as anyone in the movies. I thought this film was better then Jackie Chan's ""Rush Hour"". The chemistry between Mark Dacascos and Kadeem Hardison is excellent. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes Martial Arts action films, it's a good one.",980035200,2,543,4.787234042553192

Mark shows he can act, Kardeem isn't annoying (for once), and John Pyper rules, Hey get this film!",973641600,,320,4.262295081967213
962542,3,630507982X,"I got this movie thinking it would be a regular martial arts action movie. I was disappointed in Mark from the movie Double Dragon because I knew he has skills (Mark was great in ""Only the Strong""). I saw the movie and was blown away. Mark pulls out all the stops in this film. He uses technical and artistic blocks and punches really fast that you would have to watch it in slow motion to see the form. Each fight scene is well choreographed and the stunts were neat and a bit flashy. Imagine a Jackie Chan movie, then remove the goofy stuff and you get this. Plot is so-so, but who truly cares when it comes to these movies? Comedy wise, it was as entertaining as Ninja Turtles was, only with more profanity and some blood. Toby (Mark) is a Hong Kong agent and a prototype of some mechanism inside his upper body that helps him to be an incredible fighting machine. He wants out and hitches a ride on a boat to America. He is caught and gets away (this is where the movie begins). The 'bad guys' are after him and Toby runs into his sidekick (Kadeem Hardison - some guy I think I saw on the Cosby show once, funny attitude) and they try to get to LA to sell the mechanism, but they need to stay alive in the process. If this plot does not sound interesting enough, then the martial arts will make up for it.
This movie came out before the Matrix. In the movie some of the stunts towards the end use wire works in the action, but not ridiculously too much (a few weird scenes but they were short). The fight scenes start off well in the beginning and continue to get bigger and bigger towards the end. In the Matrix, Keanu annoyed me here and there. Mark proves to you that he should have been ""the one"".
If you care more about plot, then go for the Matrix. If want to see an actor who should have been Neo, see this movie.",965865600,3,1824,4.184659090909091

962607,5,630507982X,"As a fan of Martial Arts I must give this movie an "" A+"". Even the plot was quite okay, or do you expect super-emotional, drama acting in a movie like this? I guess not. The way I see it, the movie is made for  "" martial"" fun and entertainment. I knew that Mark Dacascos had a  lot of talent as he has shown in "" Only the Strong"" and  ""  Crying Freeman"". But Drive has totally convinced me that he is even  better than van Damme and Seagal. The choreographing of the fights are  similar to another  "" Super action hero""  from Hong Kong ( You  know who I'm talking about?  ). He has super-flashy dancing moves like you  have never seen before. In my opinion he should have a role in a Jackie  Chan movie. But besides Dacascos, Kadeem Hardisson has also done a good by  entertaining us with his motormouth.( Because I'm a german citizen I've  just seen the German dubbed version.
