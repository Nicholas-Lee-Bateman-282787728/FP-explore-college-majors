5009188,5,B006OFDPNO,"Thsi is a wonderful christmas DVD that gives us a nice nostalgic blast from the past. Some great christmas msuic led by a family of wonderful singers. Fans of FRED WARING, LIVING VOICES, RAY CONNIFF, VOICES OF WALTER SCHUMANN, and especially LAWRENCE WELK, will find much to enjoy here. Some nice soloists from the KING FAMILY step out here, too. You also get a nice backing orchestra here.

Great christmas songs like THE CHRISTMAS WALTZ and I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS along with some nice medleys make this a great christmas mood setter that is wonderful not only for your own entertaining but also as something to put on in the background when entertaining guests at your home for during the holidays.

While still worthy of 5 stars, the only thing that sometimes gets in the way of the beautiful music (and this is all IMO), is that they have family members still around today speaking about the times of these christmas recordings that were part of the KING FAMILY christmas specials on TV back int he 1960's and 1970's and this is fine in itself between songs, but too often they cut into a song so you don't get the whole song (that is, they interrupt the song). Sometimes you get the whole song afterwards, sometimes you don't. It kinda bothers me a bit when you're enjoying the song then they simply cut into it with family members suddenly speaking about that time. That said, you easily still get enough songs in their entirety to enjoy this DVD and as you can see, many others have also given this a 5 star rating.

I really do very highly recommend this for some christmas cheer. It really is entertaining! And get the CHRISTMAS WITH THE KING FAMILY cd when (if) you get this. They're both awesome!",1292630400,10,1711,4.584967320261438
5009189,5,B006OFDPNO,I remember the King family christmas show from my childhood.  It was great to be able to view it again on the dvd.,1266105600,2,114,3.9565217391304346
5009190,5,B006OFDPNO,"This DVD is extemely well done with great behind the scenes interviews scattered throughout and your chance to watch an entire, uninterrupted Christmas special. Wish all their Christmas specials were on this DVD instead of just one - perhaps at a later date?  In fact, would like to see ALL their specials on a DVD boxed set one day as well as all of their albums on CD. Watching this reminds you just how good the 4 King sisters were. This DVD is a great tribute to the King family.  This DVD was far better than expected and will be a part of our annual holiday viewing.",1262822400,6,572,4.336448598130841

5009192,5,B006OFDPNO,"I grew up watching the King Family every hear...My favorite moment was when one of the King Mom's (can't remember her name) son came home from the military while she was singing ""I'll Be Home For Christmas""  I teared up when I watched it. I thought it was going to be the ""actual shows""....however....there were the current members of the King Family (Including Tina Cole who still looks great) that were hosting the show....looking back on all their shows....It was great memories for me....",1260057600,3,492,4.857142857142857
5009193,5,B006OFDPNO,This show is a hoot. I can still remember the King Family Specials as if it were yesterday. This collection of clips is wonderful and the rememberances from the family members today especially the young ones is priceless. There is also a complete show on this disc that reminds us all of a simpler time. If you love and remember the King Family as I do buy this DVD!,1259280000,11,366,4.318840579710145
5009194,5,B006OFDPNO,"I loved the shows back in the sixties and it was really nice to see them again. I only hope this will motivate them to release their other shows as well. The scenery, the warmth emitted from the family members to each other and of course the most pleasant singing you don't see or hear anymore! It was nice to see the cousins and kids all grown up and of course very special to see the 2 remaining King Sisters together. I loved watching them perform as a child and was very glad to see them now. If you want to be transported back to a more innocent and sweet time where families showed each other respect and kindness just take a little time to view this dvd.",1258070400,16,661,4.171875

5009211,5,B006OFDPNO,"Just like I remember. I bought this for my 80+ year old mother so we could enjoy Christmas the way we used to. My father passed many years ago and it is still difficult around holiday time. Mom doesn't remember a lot and is not interested in much, except music. This was a wonderful gift, and really lifted her spirits. She even sang along.",1404432000,,340,4.328125
5009212,4,B006OFDPNO,"The first time I heard about King Family was an LP album, that a friend gave me...I fall in love with 'The Little Drummer Boy"" and
other musics....It was a glad surprise to find that the album was available in CD format, and even in DVD...the1967 tv show.
It's happy, it's full of great music. Of course...the children...not always 'in tune"". But, in total, I recomend this product.",1400803200,2,382,4.632352941176471

5009214,5,B006OFDPNO,This brings back special memories as a child. My family and I would watch the King family specials whenever they were on t.v.  I loved it. It's good to see it again. I would highly recommend it.,1391385600,,194,4.243243243243243
5009215,1,B006OFDPNO,"The copy I received was so bad, I could hardly see it.  It looked like it was a recording someone had taken off the TV.  I wanted to see this because I loved the shows when I was a kid, but not bad enough to put up with the bad recording.",1391385600,2,238,3.6470588235294117

5009217,3,B006OFDPNO,"It was okay for an old Christmas show but not a very good representation of my memories of Christmas shows from the early 1970's. Watch it for nostalgia sake only. Also not very good video quality either.  If you look close one of the daughters is Katy from ""My Three Sons"".",1388448000,,274,4.372549019607843

5009222,4,B006OFDPNO,If you were around in the late 1960s and saw any of the King Family Christmas specials you'll most likely enjoy this dvd.  A lot of background info as well as the telecasts.,1377129600,,173,4.242424242424242

5009229,5,B006OFDPNO,Gave this to my 83 year old Mom for Christmas. She loved it! It brought back memories of watching the King Family as I was growing up.

5009232,5,B006OFDPNO,"This DVD is like a time machine back to my childhood.  All warm and fuzzy and innocent with a whole lot of family love and talent shared.  My own favorite is Alyce King Clarke. A beautiful woman with a beautiful voice.  Being able to watch her rendition of ""I'll Be Home for Christmas"" while being surprised by her son, Ric, home from the army again is a special treat and a real heart tugger. Very enjoyable.

For those who have commented on ""too much talk and interviews"" etc -- they must not have checked out the bonus section to see that the 1967 Christmas Show is available to watch in it's entirety -- without any interruptions.",1325203200,10,634,4.439655172413793
5009233,5,B006OFDPNO,"Watched it over and over again!  It brought back fabulous memories.  Some of the video quality was mediocre, but I think that was probably the process in 40 years ago!

5009234,5,B006OFDPNO,What a great way to remember the Christmases of my childhood (60's-70's)!  My family always looked forward to the Christmas variety specials and the King Family never disappointed.  The lush costumes and beautiful voices are a delight to experience again after all these years.  It was also fun to see the family members reminiscing about their days together performing on the road and filming their television specials.  I highly recommend to anyone who enjoyed this type of programming back in the day.,1293494400,6,504,5.109756097560975
8501871,5,B006OFDPNO,"Loved everything about this DVD and the family.  Wish they were still on, but know this is not possible.  Makes a person feel the love of family and all our past family memories.  Wish they would have released more for everyone to enjoy.  More bio's would be great also, as the family continues to grow and change.

8501877,3,B006OFDPNO,"This DVD actually has 2 parts. The original concept is a documentary about the King family, their singing history and the making of their Christmas television shows. While the documentary is interesting it seems to gloss over information that might have actually been interesting and filled with very brief performance clips from their show. The second portion (which I believe as indicated as ""extra"" material) is the actual 1967 Christmas show in its entirety. I suggest that you watch the full show prior to the documentary to avoid being disappointed by the haphazard editing that, in the documentary, doesn't present the entertainment portion in the best manner possible. This DVD is truly representative of the ""family style"" variety shows of the 50s, 60s and into the 70s .... If you are familiar with, and liked variety shows from those years, you will most likely enjoy this DVD. Production quality overall (transfer to DVD) is pretty decent with sound tracking just a bit off at times (possibly from the original lip-syncing) but nothing really distracting. If you can get this DVD for a couple bucks (new or used) you probably won't be disappointed with your purchase.",1484611200,,1179,5.051282051282051
