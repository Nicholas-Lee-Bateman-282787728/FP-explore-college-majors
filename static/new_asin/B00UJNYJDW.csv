7046652,4,B00UJNYJDW,"The Sheamus vs. Dolph Ziggler match was a back and forth match with a lot of great nearfalls for both guys. The crowd was into it. I liked that they got more time than they did at Extreme Rules. The WWE Tag Titles 2/3 Falls Match: The New Days Kofi Kingston & Big E (w/Xavier Woods) vs. Cesaro & Tyson Kidd (w/Natalya) was a fantastic match for the time they were given with a creative finish to boot. The Bray Wyatt vs. Ryback match while the last couple of minute were really well done, but there were some dead spots in the match and you could tell the crowd really wasn't into it. The United States Title I Quit Match: John Cena vs. Rusev (w/Lana) while the effort was there, but it was too long. The Naomi & Tamina vs. The Bella Twins tag team match was not great but pretty good. The King Barrett vs. Neville match wasn't nearly as good as some of their others especially with a countout finish, but they did the post match stuff to make the fans happy. The WWE World Heavyweight Championship: Seth Rollins vs. Randy Orton vs. Dean Ambrose vs. Roman Reigns was a lot of fun. Match of the night at four stars out of five. The right guy won too. It was a pretty hectic match with four guys in the ring, plus three guys outside the ring and so much interference throughout the match. The crowd became unglued when there was that Shield reunion during the match. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1432166400,3,1395,4.228464419475656

8707117,5,B00UJNYJDW,"I thought this was a good event with the exception of a couple of matches...

1. Sheamus vs. Dolph Ziggler  well we get a regular match this time from these two with no stipulations this match was good but I thought the one at Extreme Rules was better!  They go back and forth with each wrestler getting their respective offenses in theres some great acting going on as they do a spot where Ziggler knocks Sheamus down in the corner and forces him to kiss his backside - Sheamus plays sick and goes outside and grabs some water to spit out!  The timing was a little off in this one though especially in the spot where Sheamus misses his Brogue Kick, then bends over and WAITS for Ziggler to hit his Famouser move!  Ziggler winds up doing a straight headbut to Sheamus, looked like he bladed himself quickly afterwards, and what do you know, BLOOD!  Too little too late for me since they should have had lots of blood at the Orton/Rollins cage match at Extreme Rules but NO, not a dribble or drop!  Anyway  after Ziggler hurt himself with the headbut Sheamus capitalizes and eventually hits his Brogue Kick for the win!  I think Sheamus is the best heel in WWE right now!  (7/10).

2. Tyson Kidd & Cesaro vs. The New Day (Tag-Title Match  2/3 falls)  This match was absolutely FLAWLESS  the crowd chanted THIS IS AWESOME several times and rightfully so!!  These are the best two teams in WWE and they worked PERFECTLY together in this match! There were so many cool and exciting spots I couldn't even count them all and I felt like a kid again being on the edge of my seat through the whole match!  The New Days heel gimmick is really taking off  likewise Kidd/Cesaro are coming across great as faces!  This makes for a rivalry a-la Midnight Express vs. Rock N Roll Express from the 1980s  it felt like that too!  Cesaro gets his swing in with a Kidd dropkick attached on Kingston and they take the first fall.  Xavier tells the referee he wants Freebird Rules which I thought was super-cool for a young guy like him to remember the greatest 3-Man tag-team in history!  Anyway  The New Day gets their finisher in and takes the 2nd fall.  Big E does a monster spear through the ropes on Cesaro who takes a while to recover, allowing New Day to capitalize on Kidd.  Cesaro finally comes back and puts a big Mid-South Rasslin WHOOPIN on Kingston, whipping him back and forth in the corners and hitting him with absolute SURGICAL uppercuts!!  With so much great and classic stuff going on its hard to keep track of all of it!  Well it ends with Kidd/Cesaro having the upper hand and Xavier doing some twin magic, running in and getting the roll up win on Cesaro with the referee not looking and thinking it was Kingston!  Classic ending!!!  I haven't seen a tag-team match this good since the RVD/Sabu tag matches from ECW, circa 1998!  This match and these two teams are putting my faith back into the WWE!!  Please do yourself a favor and watch this match  you won't be disappointed!!  Best match of the year so far  I actually don't think wrestling can get any better than this!!  (11/10)

3. Ryback vs. Bray Wyatt  well what do you know, another great match!  This is a definite slobberknocker with lots of hard hitting!  Wyatt has one of the hardest-hitting clotheslines Ive ever seen!  I liked the spot where Ryback was on the floor and Wyatt did an Italian-Stallion  reverse splash on him from the apron!  Then Ryback returns the favor when he hits a splash from the top rope to the canvas on Wyatt!  The ending comes when Wyatt takes one of the turnbuckle pads off and Ryback crashes into it  Wyatt capitalizes with a Sister Abigail for the win!  Cool stuff!!  (8/10)

4. Cena vs. Rusev (I Quit match for the US Title)  anybody with any sense knows whos gonna win this match just from the stipulaton  Cena doesnt quit, I don't think hell ever say I Quit in a match unless he turns heel!  The guys catchphrase is Never Give Up  so I knew immediately that Cena would win!  That being said this wasn't a bad match  much better than what they did at Extreme Rules!  They do the old crashing into the pyro box with sparks flying everywhere when Cena does the AA on Rusev on the ramp!  Rusev played like he was burned but no burn marks were anywhere to be seen!  Anyway  they go back and forth in a physical match until Rusev gets his camel clutch on Cena  Cena does the Hulk-Hogan counter, lifting Rusev into the turnbuckle  He finally gets Rusev into the STF with the rope that Rusev loosened off the corner earlier  He says I Quit in Bulgarian but the referee doesnt understand it Lana comes in (my heart skips a beat seeing her in that white outfit) and says I Quit for Rusev!  So Rusev blames Lana again for his loss - good match though!  (8/10)

5. The Bella Twins vs. Naomi & Tamina Snuka  well here come the beautiful Bella Twins, teaming together this time!!  I wish Brie would gain some weight so shed look more like her sister Nikki!  Anyway this match was kinda blah with nothing much going on  I think it was just done to put Naomi over  and I must say Im very impressed with Naomis in-ring ability!!  Shes really growing into a big star, and she finally dumped the glimmer/glammer glasses and shoes and is fitting more into her new character! I like Tamina Snuka too  I know her dad must be super-proud of her but I wish she would have done more in this match!  Anyway, the timing was off in a few places  the only two spots I liked were Naomi using her behind-bump (shades of Ice-Man King Parsons) and Nikki using her Lex Luger forearm smash which Ive been missing!!  Well the ending comes when Nikki goes to the top rope, gets distracted with Brie and Tamina fighting on the outside, Naomi pulls her down and gets the three-count!  Glad to see Naomi getting a win but sad to see it at the Bellas expense!  (4/10).

6. King Barrett vs. Neville  I didn't care much for this match mostly due how it ends! This is a tough guy going against a high-flyer, I must say Neville had great agility similar to Rey Mysterio or Juventud Guerrera, but I think Barrett is more experienced and a better wrestler overall!  Well Neville got some offense in early  then Barrett took over half-way through and hit some cool moves!  It ends when Barrett gets out of the ring and decides to not come back in!  So Neville wins by count-out.  THEN Barrett comes back in and attacks Neville and I have no idea why!!  He couldve got back in and BEAT Neville before he was counted out!!  Ridiculous ending!  (5/10)

7. Rollins/Orton/Reigns/Ambrose (Fatal 4-Way for the WWE Title)  I thought this match was pretty good even though it had too much interference from Kane!  We get to see The Shield team together again in a spot where they powerbomb Orton through the announce table!  We got to see a little of Reigns/Ambrose going one on one which I thought was cool  they actually carried the match there for a little while.  Kane was heck-bent on Rollins winning so he interfered all he could until he was put through a table himself!  After more chaos Rollins hits Orton with a pedigree for the win!  (8/10)  Shouldnt be much longer now till Rollins turns face Im thinking ahead of time to a possible Rollins vs. Triple H match at WM 32!  LOL!!

This is a good event overall - I'm giving it 5 stars just due to the tag-title match being so good!!  Highly recommended!!",1439769600,,7354,4.428571428571429

8707121,4,B00UJNYJDW,"This is my first review so its a bit rough. Here we go:

Sheamus vs. Dolph Ziggler

Yknow as a big fan of these 2 theres something about their matches that just doesnt click with me. I don't know what it is. I think its the booking. Yeah, its the booking. The way their matches have been laid out just doesnt seem right. Dolph did bleed the hard way from a head-butt so theres that. Solid opener though.

** 1/2

2-out-of-3 Falls Match for the Tag-team Championships: The New Day (ch.) vs. Cesaro & Tyson Kidd w/Natalya

After winning the titles last month T.N.D. have been on quite a roll. Who knew that being too damn positive can be annoying?! The chemistry between these teams is incredible. There were a few botches though. Cesaro couldn't get Big E up for power bomb and there was a miscue when Big E & Kofi went for their double-team finisher but everything else worked. Id like to rate this match higher but I don't think they were given enough time (a little over 12 minutes)  to really show what they could do. A 20-minute match with these competitors would be incredible. The match was fun though and the ending got a chuckle out of me.

*** 1/4

Bray Wyatt vs. Ryback

The New Face of Fear (who failed to defeat the previous one) was looking toI really cant remember why he went after Ryback. Ever since W.W.E. decided to pretend that Bray didn't lose to The Undertaker at Mania his promos have lost some of their magic. However for a guy whos being booked like crap battling a guy who I barely care about Ididnt hate this match. It was a nice hoss battle. I will hand it to Ryback for taking a certain bump. That must have hurt like hell.

***

I Quit Match for the U.S. Championship: Rusev w/Lana vs. John Cena (ch.)

Show of hands, who thinks that Rusev is going to come out the victor of this one?

No one?

Yeah. Even though the outcome of this match was never in doubt I enjoyed this match. They battled all over the arena and used all sorts of instruments to inflict pain on each other. Stairs, pyro, guard rails, you name it they probably used it. I will say this about Cena; more often than not Johnny-boy rises to the occasion in big matches and Rusev looked like a big deal. I cant wait to see how Vince screws up his future!

*** 1/2

The Bellas vs. Naomi & Tamina

The Bellas are supposed to be faces because reasons. Naomis heel turn was garbage and Tamina still sucks. Sorry, Ill try not to be so negative. Lets see, uh, there weren't any big botches and Tamina did next to nothing so thats a plus. Bleh.

**

Fatal 4-way for the W.W.E. Championship: Randy Orton vs. Dean Ambrose vs. Roman Reigns vs. Seth Rollins (ch.)

Someone would have to screw up royally to put on a bad 4-way. Fortunately that didn't happen tonight. Despite the interference from J&J Security and Kane the match had a nice flow to it. There were instances were 2 of the combatants would lye outside while the other 2 fought in the ring but thats par for the course in these type of matches. There were some good moments. Kane & Seth getting closer than theyd probably ever wanted to, a temporary reunion and a friendly wager made for a very enjoyable main event.

*** 1/2

So that was W.W.E. Payback. Id highly recommend it.",1433030400,,3224,4.347245409015025
8707122,3,B00UJNYJDW,"Dolph Ziggler vs. Sheamus - Sheamus attempted to again demoralize Dolph only for him to response by going right him aggressively sending him over the top & coming off the apron & top rope onto him which showed it's effects on Sheamus in the early moments causing Sheamus to attempt to take away Dolph's speed in varous ways while Dolph was able to use Sheamus' own momentum against him & hit some impactful moves of his own including was so impactful that everyone saw the result while also delivering something that Sheamus had coming to him in a very good opening match.

2 Out Of 3 Falls Match: Tag Team Champions New Day vs. Cesaro & Tyson Kidd - Kofi Kingston & Big E represented The New Day as we had a battle of power early on with Big E & Cesaro along with double team combinations before one team was able to single out one of their opponents keeping them in their half of the ring while isolating their other opponent from his corner to make the tag as the intensity was turned up with each fall delivering some impactful offense such as a running uppercut that you thought killed his opponent while having some entertaining moments such as Woods trying to invoke the ""Freebird Rule"" in the middle of the match in another solid match between both teams.

Ryback vs. Bray Wyatt - Ryback showed his power advantage early on while Wyatt relied on using his own body as a weapon including one move delivered with such impact that you clearly saw Ryback in pain afterwords & throughout the rest of the match as both men traded momentum with each taking advantage of an opening left by their opponent along with blocking & countering the other's offense in a match that was good for what it was considering how Ryback was fighting through obvious pain.

""I Quit"" Match: United States Champion John Cena vs. Rusev - For those trivia fans, this is Cena's fifth ""I Quit"" match with the lesser known fact being that all but one of those matches also took place during the annual PPV that occurs during the month of May.  Rusev was dominate early pounding Cena down & easily breaking any momentum Cena attempted to gain but kept allowing the fans reaction towards Lana distract him allowing Cena to fight back as both men took advantage of the ringside environment along with brawling throughout the crowd to the stage area itself with each man throwing the other into or through whatever possible including taking a piece of the ring apart juts to punish their opponent as the match got so physical that one man would have lost the match under the condition they were in during any other match except this one causing the match to continue resulting in not only a great brawl but their best encounter of their feud.

Bella Twins vs. Naomi & Tamina - The Bellas started out working over their opponents both individually & using double teaming causing Naomi & Tamina to use some illegal tactics to regain the advantage singling out one Bella to work over in what was your typical solid tag team match but nothing special.

Neville vs. King Barrett - Neville caught Barrett off guard right out the gate with his aerial offense causing Barrett to heavily focus on a part of the body to slow him down with strikes & grounded offense as they traded momentum with Neville being able to counter offense while Barrett kept catching him in a match that wasn't much different than their previous encounters but my least favorite of their series.

WWE Champion Seth Rollins vs. Roman Reigns vs. Dean Ambrose vs. Randy Orton - The special stipulation for this match was that Kane would be fired from The Authority if Seth Rollins didn't retain his championship.  This match started off with a bang as you saw a series of back to back dives outside of the ring in the opening minute as the match was non-stop action with various highlights such as different unlikely alliances being formed between the competitors including a reunion a year in the making, the ringside environment coming into play on different occasions, series of hitting their signature moves & countering others, and the biggest story of the match being what was the most important to Kane in a great & physical main event filled from everyone involved.

Preshow matches include R-Truth vs. Stardust and the ""reunion"" of the Mega Powers with Curtis ""#Axelmania"" Axel & Damien ""Macho Mandow"" Sandow vs. The Ascension.  This was a solid show with some good action & some standout matches (""I Quit"" & Fatal Four Way) so in the end, it's worth watching a replay on the network & for a rental/steam at best.",1432339200,3,4559,4.645161290322581
