8079209,2,B000ARXFNW,"Given the lost heritage of Irish Abbey ales, whiskey, and mead, once common landscape elements, I wish this DVD were better. If the Belgians preserved their Abbey brewery recipes against all odds, the literate Irish must also have historic recipes of these earthly delights. It would be great if along with their other charity work,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/U-2/dp/B000001FS3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">U-2</a>&nbsp;funded research and revival of these ancient Irish traditions.

Lower your expectations with this DVD and you'll be alright, it's like Ma and Pa took a tour and made home movies for the folks back home. A few facts are thrown together; you'll learn a little about the mild ways of Irish Whiskey, it's three distillations for a softer bite, rather than the Scottish two. Another interesting thing is that several small independent companies have defied the French conglomerates to reintroduce authentic peat-smoked Irish whiskey. But I enjoy the bite of a Scottish peat-blast, like the single-malt Islay Laphroaig. Have a sip to increase your tolerance of corny blarney and repeated shots of an irritated gal driving a slow horse pulling a silly wagon on tiny wheels, while flutes belt out an Irish Spring kinda ditty. These folks meant well compiling this DVD, but I expected higher quality filming and more history.",1307059200,,1382,5.6124401913875595
8079210,5,B000ARXFNW,"As an Irish Whiskey Fan I have taken great delight in gathering a few close friends, setting out a dozen carefully selected bottles of Irish Whiskey, and watching this DVD while enjoying a pleasant journey down The Irish Whiskey Trail.  The DVD is educational, entertaining, and sets a very calming mood for the enjoyment of coal-fired, closed-kiln, triple-distilled whiskey.  BTW, if you have to journey down The Irish Whiskey Trail with only one bottle, make it RedBreast.",1246320000,2,474,5.142857142857143
