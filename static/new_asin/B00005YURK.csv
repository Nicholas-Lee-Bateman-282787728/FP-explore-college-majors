7957091,5,B00005YURK,"It was a highlight in my life to have been in the same company where Erik Bruhn was a principal dancer in the late fifties and early sixties.  It's a pity that there are too few videos or filmed performances of his work.  The arrival on the scene of Rudolf Nureyev in 1964 attracted a tremendous amount of media attention. One hardly heard of any other male danceur.  It was a shame as the public lost out on learning more about Bruhn and his singular gifts.  Being able to acquire this video,  Erik Bruhn:  I'm the Same Only More, thrilled me!  His opinions and thoughts are so wise and thought out that it is easy to see why he rose to such prominance in his art ( without the media's help ).  Of course, his physical appearance alone drew one into his performance!  This video gives us a peek of a variety of roles he danced.  I wish it had more complete solos or pas de deux, but we see him in rehearsals at different periods of his performance days.  Balletomanes HAVE to add this video to their collection to experience one of the world's GREATEST danceur nobles!",1337904000,,1069,4.348484848484849

It covers many aspects of his life, from pictures of his childhood to his last associations.  Don't pass this one up!",1108684800,4,287,5.195652173913044
