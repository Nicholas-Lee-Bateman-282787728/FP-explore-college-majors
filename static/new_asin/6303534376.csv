710716,2,6303534376,"Too much style and not enough substance.  As an intermediate/advanced level Ashtanga student, I can safely say that Mr. Kest has a huge ego problem as the video puts way too much attention on him and his bad boy  good looks with gauzey shots and hard body close ups and not enough time on  the actual work, I was very dissapointed.  Also the tape runs 36 minutes  long, not the advertised 54 minutes, a rip off.",917913600,3,411,4.355263157894737
710783,5,6303534376,"Bryan Kest's program is both challenging, interesting, and esthetically pleasing.
I've never had the patience to put up with a tape before, but I've been regularly doing this for a couple weeks now.  I sweat as much as I ever have in any workout, and feel great after.  Bryan allows for the less flexible in just about every pose (though there's one point in the tape when he says ""this is an easy pose!"" and I'm forced to throw my tv a dirty look as I struggle to stay balanced).
I'm a complete beginner, at an average lazy college student's level of fitness.  This was challenging to get through the first time, and I did quit halfway through on my second try, but since then I've noticed constant improvement.  There's endless room for growth here, as you can take the poses as deep as you want to.
The tape itself is nicely filmed, Bryan's cute, and though the rest of the class is disgustingly fit and attractive, they're not distracting and are helpful to look at when working out what's best for you. The background music isn't something I'd listen to every day, but it seems to absolutely disappear in my mind when I go through the tape.  It fits the workout very well.
Bryan himself is a little funny to listen to, as he tells us things like ""be where you're at, because that's where you are!"", but I found it actually to be quite entertaining.  My roommate has walked in on me when I've had the tape on and thinks he's a nut, so not everyone will like his personality, but I found him a very refreshing change.
I'd recommend this tape (and have, in fact, recommended this tape to several friends) - as long as you have the determination to get through the thing and do it regularly I think it could be helpful to anyone regardless of their beginning level of fitness.",1037577600,8,1777,4.435582822085889
710784,5,6303534376,"Thow I attend Kripalu style yoga classes regurlarly, I bought the three series video ""Brian Kest's Power Yoga""  to extend my practice and get ""something more"" out of it. I was not dissappointed at all. After trying on the first video I inmmediatedly got the other two for later on. I consider myself a late begginner/pre-intermediate level student and I'm already using the second video in the series. I appreciate that the poses are held a bit longer than in other power yoga videos and that the flow of movement is kept, but without leaving you out of breath at the end. I wouldn't recommend this series for someone new to yoga. You should have some previous knowledge of the poses so as not to spend time turning your head up to look at the tv. screen, instead concentrate on what Mr. Kest is saying and it would be much easier to follow thru the whole class. I've quite a collection of yoga videos and this series is my favorite. Be sure you're going to sweat and that your muscles will burn at the end of the session.",1019692800,8,1022,4.4361702127659575
710785,4,6303534376,"Although I wish Kest would spend less time during the class talking about his philsophy... ""Be where you are, that is exactly where you should be"" (if I heard it one more time I was going to shut the video off).  This is an excellent beginning Power Yoga tape.
It gave good instructions for modifications between beginner and more advanced poses.  Not too difficult but challenging enough.. this is a good tape for someone who has been practicing yoga for a few months and has decent flexibility.
Glad I purchased...",1019520000,2,516,4.722222222222222
710786,5,6303534376,"Most people think of the stereotypical yoga teacher as someone with a calm, soothing voice spouting all sorts of New Age wisdom as you twist yourself into impossible asanas and contemplate your third eye. Well, Bryan Kest is not that sort of teacher -- I couldn't do this video at first without giggling a little at this guy telling me to ""get into the sweetness of the pose"" in this tough, New Jersey-ish ""dude"" voice. That said, this is an EXCELLENT video for a beginning-to-intermediate practitioner who has had some yoga experience. It is an excellent workout and uses a wide variety of stretches to challenge your body and your mind. There isn't much detailed instruction in these videos -- not many breakdowns of positions or explanations of movements, which is why I wouldn't recommend it to a rank beginner. It is much more like attending a class as opposed to an instruction video. In terms of production values, it is beautifully photographed and lit, and the wide variety of (admittedly very attractive) people featured in the video give a good sense of how to adapt poses to suit your own body's needs. And the background music is both pleasant and non-obstrusive. If you can adapt to Bryan Kest's mannerisms and voice, this is an awesome tape. In all honesty, I find him really positive, encouraging and rather entertaining, and it's refreshing to see a teacher who isn't into showing off his or her superior flexibility for all to see and admire.",1014422400,45,1460,4.7976190476190474
710787,2,6303534376,"I found Bryan Kest to be very annoying -- he never shuts up and has a very annoying voice. Some of the poses are tough, and it is a decent workout, but I couldn't get past his jabbering throughout the entire video. I had to give this one away. I much prefer Rodney Yee's videos.",1001462400,11,278,4.072727272727272
710788,5,6303534376,"I approached yoga with the same trepidition I did my first half marathon:why the hell am I doing this? After 5 kids and yeras of running and dance, I have the flexibility of granite. Becoming a human pretzel was not on my dance card. This tape,howvere,radically altered that perception. Kest,who sounds like my neighbor,but is from Detroit,calmly expains and cajoles you into each position. Some people have complained that he talks too much,though I find it reassuring{it IS a beginners tape,after all}. The poses though are not broken down quite as explicitly as I would have liked, though viewing the class{made up of hard bodies,which is daunting and not inspiring} I found following along quite simple. After 3 months of daily practice, I have found my body is quite a bit more flexible, and I can do the positions about 50%{I statred at about 10%,so there has been great improvement}. Kest doesnt seem interested in being anyone guru{which is nice,for a change}, and simply and calmly leads you through this tape. I have done this every day but one the last 3 months, and it is a good strenuous,vigorous workout that you can mine deeper each time. HIGHLY<HUGELY RECOMMENDED, especially for the yoga-phobes like myself. Very very good",996796800,34,1239,4.961538461538462
710789,5,6303534376,"I have been doing Yoga on and off for a couple of years now.  To be honest I haven't done a proper class for months and felt that I really needed a refresher. My local classes are held at inconvenient times, hence the purchase of this video. I especially liked the way Bryan Kest explained (very quickly) the breathing techniques, as to be honest, it's not HARD to breathe. Then he got straight into the required positions and began. After about 40 minutes or so I was literally dripping.  I have never used a fitness video at home that has made me sweat and push myself to my fullest extent as this one did. Honestly if your a beginnner then buy it.  If your advanced then still buy it, it's does wonderful long stretches that really push your muscles to their best. I felt absolutely rejuvenated and ready for the world afterwards.  Although the next day my hamstrings ached, but a good 'workout' ache, if you see what I mean.",996537600,,928,4.4411764705882355
710790,5,6303534376,"I have been doing exercises all my life. I found weightlifting very rewarding but time consuming and frustrating if you can't do it anymore but, after I started doing a lot of different kind of yoga classes I found the most amazing power yoga videos ever made. This workout video is great, The first two sessions are really tough but, after one week or two, you can really see the difference in your body and mind. The video is very well done. The instructor is gorgeous and the students are great! The workout will left your toned and relaxed at the same time. I really recomend this video because it is good no matter your level of fitness.",990576000,4,642,4.4491525423728815
710791,5,6303534376,"My husband and I are 47 years old and wanted to try Yoga for the first time. I read the reviews and decided to try this one. This is excellent and don't pay attention to the people that say it's too easy. They've obviously been doing Yoga for years and feel the need to use terms such as ""ashtanga"" to impress the reader. That isn't what Yoga is about - trying to impress people or be better than someone else at this or be a know it all with the terms. You go at your own rate and it's meditation and balance.  Brian's videos aren't so hard that you're discouraged right off the bat. It took us a couple weeks to feel comfortable with the first one so we ordered the second and alternate them. We have been doing them two to three times a week for about 5 months and haven't lost interest in the least. I haven't been this limber since I was in high school! It really is wonderful and believe me I'm very critical when it comes to trying something new like this. Start with his first video and when you feel good with that, go to the second. He's explains things so well and it's a great way to get in shape.",987465600,8,1109,4.110599078341014
710860,5,6303534376,"I love this video. I plan on getting two and three after I master one. This is for the mid-level person. If you are a beginner,I would suggest getting a beginner tape from Living Arts or one of those other tape series (Patricia Walden or Rodney Yee as instructor). A beginner tape will teach you alignment and it goes slowly through each pose. Then you can graduate to this. It shouldn't take you long if you are doing it everyday. In this Bryan Kest video they do Power yoga (Ashtanga)in which they do one pose after the other. I think his tapes are great because he does not alienate you or ask you to alienate your body. Modify, Modify, Modify!",986428800,4,647,4.4
710861,5,6303534376,"This was one of the first yoga videos I bought when there were very few out there. Now I have seen many more, and this one still is good practice.  One does need to know the basics and if you have gotten out of shape, doing the whole video at one setting will be challenging. But if you hold onto Brian's words,""If you get tired come out of the pose and rest. Then join us"" things flow okay. I personally don't care about the prettiness of the people or the clothes they wear or don't wear. Yoga is about developing the inside. Kest does a good job coordinating breathing with the postures and the postures are in anatomical alignment. With a little practice one can make it through the series each one becoming more challenging. Remember to modify the postures as necessary and that yoga isn't about competing with the video tape. I give this tape a high recomendation. Richard Freeman's tape is also excellant. It is a very differnt flavor.",980121600,6,942,4.508771929824562
710862,5,6303534376,"This is only my second yoga video after Rodney Yee's Power Yoga.  I was worried from reading the reviews that it might be too much for me, but it's not.  Although more of a challenge and longer, it is easy to follow.  And I like having Brian remind me that it's not about how it looks, but about how it feels...",978393600,3,311,4.065573770491803
710863,4,6303534376,"I had to keep rewinding the tape to keep up.  You cannot follow the rutine by merely listening, and while in some positions, there is no way to look at the tv.  Other videos make it easier to follow the workout without watching.  Also, this is not an easy video for beginners.  I would not recommend it as a first yoga video.",977097600,3,325,4.193548387096774
710864,4,6303534376,"I have been a 5-6 mile, 2-day-per week runner since I was 11 years old; that's 20 years now.  My knees are holding up but my back has been on-and-off hurting for at least 5 years.  Since I have been using this video, I feel a drastic improvement.  I was uneasy picking out a yoga tape, though I'd heard about the positive benefits of yoga: I was afraid that a yoga video might be new-age cheesy.  No cheesiness here; the emphasis of this tape is definitely on the workout itself.  I cannot say enough good things about incorporating something like this into a workout schedule.  I also lift weights once per week; but neither weights nor running has made me feel like this when the workout's over - balanced and rested.  The poses are challenging but definitely not disheartening; I was surprised to find that I could do all of them.  When I'm ready for it, I'll be buying tape #2.",975369600,19,881,4.428571428571429
710865,4,6303534376,"I have really loved doing this yoga tape!  I always feel like I get a great workout.  I do feel, however, that there is a little too much emphasis on ""down dog.""
I am definitely going to buy his other two videos in the series.
Highly recommended to anyone who loves yoga!",974764800,2,271,4.1923076923076925
710866,5,6303534376,"I go to Bryan's class about 2-3 times a week and have all 3 of his videos in this series for the days I don't feel like going to class (which truthfully, is not that often!) or for when I am travelling out of town.  Bryan's philosophy merged with the asanas of yoga offer the perfect mind-body-spirit workout for those who commit fully to the process.  It's not about wrapping your leg around your head, or how far you can extend any single body part--it's about breathing and staying calm throughout  incredibly physically challenging moments.  You WILL lose weight (and start to relinquish negative body image views and diet-obsessed thinking)  You WILL change the shape of your body (and look longer and leaner)  You WILL increase your ability to focus in everything you do.  But these are all side effects--because when doing the video, the only things that matter are each  moment you  experience --one by one.  ANYONE can benefit from these videos.  I took my out-of-shape, but naturally flexible 60 plus year old mother and nearing 70 year old -of-shape, not-at-all flexible father to class and they both liked it and found it useful. The key is that you do what Bryan instructs TO YOUR OWN DEGREE.  There is no doing it ""right"".  There's only what's right for you.  Bryan teaches you how to approach what that is, and as your body changes and grows, you will find more and more you can get out of each of these videos in the series.  Listen to what he says--besides that his voice is soothing and will help you focus, the messages of being loving and aware of your body as you practice are important for people who have been inundated with a no pain no gain, gym mentality approach to exercise for far too long.  My only complaint as a person who takes Bryan's classes and practices on an advanced level is that videos are a little short for me--but rather than stress over that (which would be very unyogalike) I just run each section twice!  I will never belong to a gym again.  I have found what I didn't even know I was looking for-- a non-competitive way to be physically active--since competitive sports never had any thrill for me as someone to whom winning and competing seem overrated.  I have also found a sweet, supportive instructor, now friend, who has helped me learn how to change and focus my life and body in ways I couldn't even have imagined until I began my practice in earnest.  I cannot encourage more strongly that you check this out and see what it  can do for you.",974592000,63,2497,4.553811659192825
710867,5,6303534376,"Bryan Kest is adorable.  As a power yoga beginner, I started the video and was trying my best to hold the poses.  As I was reaching the point that I could hold one of them no longer, he says, ""It's O.K. if you can't stay any longer. Just rest and jump back in.  You doing the exercises perfectly because you are doing your best.""  His instruction style is very accepting and motivating for any level.",972518400,9,400,4.293333333333333
710868,5,6303534376,"Brain Kest's videos genuine, effective,powerful. Kest has a real concern for his students including those who watch his videos. Those who snipe about him posing or being shirtless are simply missing the point. Its ok to have a beautiful, healthy body!
Kest teaching style is motivational, yet compassionate. He urges the user to modify the exercises to the user's body type rather than a precise replication of the asana urged by ""old school"" yoga teachers. Kest understands that most students (especially westerners) cant readily adapt their tight, rigid bodies to an Iyengar level of perfection. For them to do so would put them out of harmony with their body and possibly cause injury and needless duress. I bring this up as one reviewer ( a yoga techer) complained that some of the students in the video were not in perfect form.
  Anyway, his video vol 1, is best for those who have some exercise behind them, particularly some yoga. These tapes are based on Ashtanga yoga, the most physically difficult system of yoga. An out of shape beginner will find this tape very challenging.
For those stick with it they will experience a body transformation unlike any exercise program they have or will work with. Hang in there. Youll love the way you look and feel. Namaste A",971654400,220,1274,4.839449541284404
710869,5,6303534376,"I love these tapes. I have back and forth over the years and always come  back to this Power Yoga tape.  I feel very challenged and feel a great  accomplishment when I can do the difficult poses.  One thing I noticed is  that it is not a matter of doing the pose correct, in a sense it's that you  are in the moment breathing into the pose.  I practice mindfulness daily  and since I have been doing the tapes with mindfulness as Bryan Kest's  suggest, I find the poses to be easier than struggling through them waiting  for the pose to be over because it is too stressful.  I like the setting of  the class.  It looks real, unlike other videos with a fake background.  I  am glad I found these tapes.  I have all three, I interchange them daily.  Volume 1 2 and 3 are all powerful each building on the other challenging  you a little more with each one.  I highly suggest this tape.",968457600,12,883,4.210843373493976
710925,5,6303534376,"I can agree with prior reviewer's comments, this is a very intense, very gratifying yoga workout.  I'd never tried ""power"" yoga until this  tape.  I'd been doing Dixie Carter's ""Unworkout"" videos and had  been sweating from them, but once I added Mr. Kest's tape to my yoga  library, did I start to ""really"" sweat.
I watched the tape  through the first time, just to get an idea of what was to come when I  started.  A lot of the poses are pretty basic, but the level  and  intensity you do them, is what causes the  sweat gates to open.  I feel  this workout has made my overall yoga practice even better, and  the health  and flexibility benefits are absolutely there.
The poses I love are the  side bends, forward bending twists, and boat pose.  These are where I  really  feel everything working together to create the ultimate feeling of  satisfaction of a good practice and overall workout.  My muscles are more  developed, I've better posture, my waist is going down, and  I feel ready  to face the day after a good yoga workout.
I alternate this tape with the  Dixie Carter's tapes and Jane Fonda's yoga tape, and I take one day off a  week.  I recommend this tape to someone who wants to build the intensity  level of their yoga practice.",966211200,19,1247,4.495495495495495

I saw this video at the movie rental place,  tried it, and am now a yoga junkie.  The video is difficult, but that's  what I like. You won't get tired of the video quickly because there is  always room for improvement.  Mr. Kest suggests that we work at our level  and improve when we can and that is what I'm doing.

It follows that most yoga classes are almost exclusively women.  Being that women are  genetically engineered to move differently than men, taking a yoga class  with women can be very intimidating initially.  I bought this video and had  it on my shelf for over a year before actually doing it.  Let me tell you  this - Yoga IS for guys and Yoga is NOT for wimps.  Of all the yoga videos  I've seen in stores, this one equally focuses on both men and women, and  also on the different levels of each pose.  I started with volume 1  ""Energize"" and have worked with it for several months now and am  moving up to volume 2 ""Tone.""  This video is an excellent  introduction to yoga BY a GUY, FOR a GUY.  Don't mean any disrespect to  women at all, but this video is like the Lifetime network of Yoga videos  for men.  I can't speak more highly of it.

Brian Kest provides  that and more.  Not only does he reassure you of your progress, but he  gives you glimpses of what could happen as you become acclimated with his  brand of yoga.  He keeps you coming back for more, each time finding  something different about yourself and your potential.  I am twisting in  ways I never thought possible.

You only have one person to watch, & they  are more focused on the yoga than on camera angles so it is much easier to  learn.  Brian Kest- your ""be where you're at"" was a good idea,  but you blew it!",939945600,11,673,4.0534351145038165

I was very sore and thought I would never be able to advance  to Volume 3.  Within  months, I was able to do all three tapes.  I have become stronger, more  flexible,  and calmer, especially under stress.  He's a great instructor,  always making you feel OK about where you are.  The best exercise video's  available, in my opinion.",934675200,4,469,4.518072289156627

Yes!  Feel GREAT after this workout and all day long, sleep better too. I love his voice and this is just THE BEST Yoga workout. Great Seller!",1418601600,,287,3.982456140350877
7853362,1,6303534376,Power yoga was not my thing. It moved a bit too fast for me. I would not recommend it if you want to relax while stretching.,1377820800,,124,3.8076923076923075

7853364,5,6303534376,"I must admit that Yoga intimidated me a bit. I'm not the most flexible person in the world and while I enjoy quiet meditation and relaxation techniques, I am sometimes a bit too cynical for the hokey new age music and workouts filmed in meadows or rain forests with soft-spoken directions. I do however thoroughly enjoy this DVD and find it to be an excellent strengthening and energizing workout. I can see how it would be difficult to follow as stated in other reviews if you are a complete novice to Yoga. I had learned from a few other beginner tapes before finding Kest's DVD so the transitions to upward and downward dog, etc. can be a bit hard to manage if not familiar with proper transitions. I also liked that it included a few more complex poses than most beginner tapes. The modifications help to ease into these poses, allowing you to grow in your practice and move to the next level.  If you listen to his direction and focus on your own poses and not on trying to continually keep an eye on the TV, you'll find this to be an excellent and rewarding workout. I watched the tape through one time before joining in so that I could become familiar with the sequence and the poses I was going to be directed on. This allows me to only have to look up a handful of times and instead submerse myself in breathing and proper posing.",1257724800,,1339,4.399193548387097
7853365,5,6303534376,"i've been doing this tape for several years, to help get back in shape after pregnancy, and to invigorate and challenge myself periodically.  i think kest's approach helps remind me to be present in my practice with his supportive comments about feeling your body's response and accepting yourself.  as kest suggests, you can go to infinite depth in a pose, and he gives solid ideas on how to feel and go deeper in terms of both flexibility and increasing strength.  as a videographer, i actually appreciate the attention to presentation.",1155427200,,538,4.955555555555556
7853366,5,6303534376,"This was the first yoga dvd that I had ever purchased. I like it because he explains really well what you need to do and he doesn't push you into anything that you can't handle. I play volleyball and it helps me keep in shape, and relieve my stress from my day at school. And i highly suggest this Video.",1139961600,,304,4.083333333333333
7853367,5,6303534376,"This is a great workout for strength and flexibility.  It is somewhat challenging, but modifications are explained.  I do agree with some of the other reviewers that some of the things Bryan Kest says are cheesy.  None the less, the workout is invigorating and well worth the money.",1118620800,,282,4.833333333333333
7853368,5,6303534376,"I've been doing Yoga for about four years or so and use a wide variety of videos from various instructors (such as Swenson, Yee, Kripalu (Lundeen(Sudha)as well as Cope), Walden, MacGraw /Schiffman, among others). I like to mix my routine up from day to day to keep things fresh so I'm always looking for more tapes to work with. After reading almost all of the reviews of this and the other Kest videos I figured I'd give it a try and ordered the box set (which is a great deal if you think you'd want to get them all eventually!).

 I just recieved the tapes yesterday and have only done the first tape ""Energize"" so far and find it to be a wonderful addition to my yoga tape library (I'm really looking forward to doing the other tapes). Kest is a very easy instructor to follow and I liked his approach tremendously. He constantly stresses to work at your own level and to focus on the sensation and the breath and to keep your ego out of the practice. He has a very sincere attitude and isn't patronizing or ""rah rah"" (I find it silly when an instructor on a video says stuff like ""There you go, that's great!"" as if they can actually see you.....)

 I found the pacing to be really perfect. It creates a lot of heat in the body yet it didn't leave me feeling exhausted. In fact I felt energized, strong, flexible as well as peaceful after doing this tape!

 I find the David Swenson ""Short Forms"" tape to be really excellent if you want something that will give you a bit of a faster pace, especially in the pacing of the Sun Salutations. I've not done the other Kest tapes yet so either of those may provide that more aerobic aspect as well.

 I would agree that it's probably a good idea to have a beginning tape of some sort before you move into this tape so that you have a basic knowledge of the poses. Something like ""Yoga for Beginners"" by Patricia Walden, or the Kripalu ""Gentle"" tape by Caroline Lundeen (Sudha) etc. are two I would recommend just to get a basic feel for Yoga and get their bodies eased into the practice. The Walden tape is very good for learning the details of the poses while the Kripalu is a great practice tape to start with because it flows gently from pose to pose. I use the Kripalu Gentle tape regularly to alternate it with days that I do more of an Ashtanga/Power routine so it's one that won't become obsolete.

 Anyway, regarding the Kest ""Energize"" tape, I highly recommend it to someone who wants something challenging. It will help you with Strength, Flexibilty, Balance and Inner calmness/stress relief (both physically and mentally). I can see that this will be a tape that I use regularly!

7853369,2,6303534376,"This is my least favorite of all the yogo tapes I have seen and tried to do. I loved the regular yoga I had done, but wanted something a little more challenging to build more muscle. I bought this tape at a garage sale, and quickly learned why the owner didn't like it either. Basically the most annoying aspect was the teacher himself. In my opinion he talked too much, and didn't have a very soothing voice at all. The excersizes seemed alot more repetative than the other tapes I have done (and the classes I took)and  the background and music were mediocre at best.",1072483200,3,569,4.419047619047619
