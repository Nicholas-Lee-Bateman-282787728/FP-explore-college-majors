8304696,3,6303206557,"I am not a huge fan of this series although I do like most sci-fi & super-hero type stuff.  That being said, this is one of the better Power Ranger videos in my opinion.  I liked the plot (Zed casts a spell on Billy & Zack that causes them to see their fellow Rangers as Putties, which are bad guys for you parents.)  Of course, he throws in a monster for good measure.  But I think Bulk & Skull, the comic relief duo, are the real stars of this series.  So, if you like this series or your kids do, then I would recommend this video.  If not, then it's little more than silly putty (Pun intended).  At worst, it's a half hour of mindless fun.",1024790400,,643,4.055555555555555
