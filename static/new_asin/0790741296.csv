119548,5,0790741296,"I don't agree with most of the reviews of this.  I think this is a good adaptation, and is seriously over/under/adequately acted by a marvelous group of character actors.  Hugh O'Brian---cast because of his darkly handsome looks; Shirley Eaton for her blonde beauty; Daliah Lavi for those eyebrows; Marianne Hoppe and Mario Adorf were splendid in their housekeeping roles; Fabian appropriately as bad an actor as singer; and those wonderful British superstars Dennis Price, Stanley Holloway, Leo Genn and Wilfrid Hyde White hammy as they should be expected to be.  The jazzy score is totally out of kilter, but it lends a kind of retrospective jolt to the senses.
Now, let's imagine TEN LITTLE INDIANS 2004--better special effects, the musical score featuring Christina Aguilera, Clay Aiken, Pink and REM.  Director would be someone like Quentin Tarantino or Brian DePalma.  And think of the cast:
BEN AFFLECK - Lombard
JENNIFER LOPEZ - Vera
SEAN CONNERY - Blore
ROBBIE WILLIAMS - Marston
HALLE BERRY - Ilone
DUSTIN HOFFMAN - Dr. Armstrong
TYNE DALY - The Judge
F. LEE ERMEY - The General
BOB NEWHART & SUZANNE PLESHETTE - The Housekeepers.

The movie tells the basic story, but manages to be quite dull and eventually loses all focus as it spirals to an end.  The cast is bad overall; Dalilah Lavi is especially bad, and Fabian should never have been allowed to act.  Skip this one (and run in fear from the 1975 version with Oliver Reed and Elke Sommer), stick with the original from 1945 titled ""And Then There Were None.""",1051488000,6,509,4.382978723404255
119551,3,0790741296,"The 1930s Agatha Christie novel AND THEN THERE WERE NONE was a sensation: ten unconnected people are invited to an isolated resort only to discover  they have been lured by a hidden psychopath intent on bumping them off one by one in retribution for crimes they have committed in their pasts.  Nothing like it had been seen before, and Christie adapted the novel to the stage where it proved equally popular.  A 1945 film version of the stage adaptation by director Rene Clair was also extremely successful with both critics and the public.  But in the 1960s Christie sold the film rights to a number of her novels, and the result was string of low budget films starring Margaret Rutherford as Jane Marple.  Christie openly despised these films, but Rutherford's enjoyable comic performances made them very popular at the box office, and a remake of AND THEN THERE WERE NONE became inevitable.
Director George Pollock, who worked on Rutherford's Jane Marple films, was also responsible for AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, which was released under the work's American title TEN LITTLE INDIANS. But on this occasion Pollock bit off a great deal more than he could chew, for the plot of TEN LITTLE INDIANS cannot be reduced to a single comic turn; to be effective it requires an ensemble cast, and in spite of one or two worthy peformances Pollock's tampering with the story's details and dumbing-down of the plot renders the whole film extremely flat.  The only enjoyable performance in the film is by Wilfrid Hyde-White; the rest of the cast is either impossibly over the top (Daliah Lavi), tiresomely wooden (Shirley Eaton), or embarassingly bad (Fabian.)The direction, script, cinematography, and art direction range from the merely serviceable to the absolutely unimaginative, and the absolute best that can be said for the whole thing is that it achieves a fairly consistent mediocrity.
Even so, Christie's basic premise gives the film enough interest to keep you watching--and along the way something happens: the movie becomes entertaining in a cult-film sort of way.  Much of this is due to the film's extremely inept effort to cultivate a ""swinging sixties"" tone, which combines very oddly with its utter lack of inspiration and the very weird range of performances.  It all adds up to something faintly ridiculous, faintly ""hooty,"" and that alone makes the film the whole thing oddly enjoyable.  Even so, I wouldn't go out of my way for this particular film: you're better off catching this on the late-late show than actually buying it.  (And you should absolutely, positively avoid still later remakes, which are truly sorry.) Save your money for the 1945 Rene Clair version--which is, by the way, now available on DVD as well as videotape.",1015200000,34,2744,4.9846827133479215
119552,3,0790741296,"First off, I'm a huge Christie fan, and Ten Little Indians is my favorite of her stories.  This is a solid, enjoyable retelling of the story, though it lacks the top drawer quality of the 1939 original.  The entire 39 cast  was terrific.  This one has some great performances, some competent ones,  and some laughably bad ones. Standout in this cast are Wilfrid Hyde White  as the Judge, Stanley Holloway, Daliah Lavi, Shirley Eaton, and Hugh  O'Brian.  Equally bad are Fabian as the playboy, and the butler, can't  remember the actor's name.  The butler delivers some lines as though he's  sleepwalking, and overacts at other times.  I don't think I'm giving too  much away by saying that Fabian's performance is so over-the-top grating  that's its a relief when he's the first character to drop.
Other  interesting developments-though still tame by today's standards, this  version has considerably more sex and violence than the original, in which  most of the bodies were kept offstage.  In this one, most of the murders  occur on camera, including one in which a character plummets to their death  in a cable car, a spectacular development not in the book.  Indeed,  Christie's murders were usually very clean, a gun, a knife, poison.  Not  something as pure Hollywood as this.  The fact that this death also bears  no resemblance to the nursery rhyme, a key plot point in all versions of  the story, doesn't seem to bother the screenwriter at all.  Oh well.
One  other interesting change-the spinster character of the book and original  movie is changed here and in the other remakes to a glamorous actress.  Although Christie purists will probably be upset, I don't think it did any  harm, particularly since I enjoyed Daliah Lavi's performance.
All in  all, this production is flawed, but still entertaining and well worth  seeing, especially if your a Christie fan.  Not as good as the 39 version,  and much better than the God-awful 1975 and 1989 remakes.",962928000,60,1965,4.902140672782875

119560,2,0790741296,"I found this dvd at Amoeba Records for $3. The film versions of  Agatha Christie's novel can follow one of two directions:  The happy Hollywood ending or the ending faithful to the original novel.
 This 1974 version suffers from lackluster acting.  Oliver Reed sleepwalks through the film, ruining another movie (the most notable example being Tommy, where his casting is the only dead weight  in an otherwise exceptional film). Elke Sommer is another actor miscast in this film; since the whole storyline hinges on her performance, the film lacks any emotion (romance, suspense, humor) due her tepid acting and the lack of chemistry between her and Oliver Reed. It is a shame because I loved her in A Shot In The Dark.
The only two things of interest in this movie are the location (which I thought was Egypt but is in Iran at the world's oldest hotel) and the casting of two early James Bond villians as murder victims. These Bond villains had me thinking this film would have been vastly improved if all the cast members had been Bond villans (Donald Pleasance, Dr. No, Lotte Lenya, Bruce Glover, Charles Gray) with Sean Connery and Honor Blackman (or Ursula Undress) as the fim's central couple; although I do like Herbert Lom (ie: Inspector Dreyfus) and Stephane Audran (who I love in Claude Chabrol and Luis Bunuel films).",1505174400,,1328,4.807017543859649
119561,3,0790741296,"No version can beat the original 1945 ""And Then There Were None"" but this version is a good runner up. Oliver Reed, playing against type as the hero, heads up a good internation cast. No surprises here but competently done",1504137600,,222,4.575
119562,5,0790741296,"Rather than review the film in detail, I will alert you to the important points.

First, this blu-ray release has been painstakingly restored and is genuinely the best video we are likely to see for this film. The color is, for the most part, accurate and true to life, with very few moments in which color visibly shifts from one scene to the next in order to maintain skin tone or the color on the sofa, while allowing the other to drift. The sound is excellent for the age of the film and very good, as compared to a modern film, pretty much as good as it gets. This is one you watch for Oliver Reed and, if you are watching it for him, you won't be disappointed.

That being what it is, the second star of this film is the desert resort hotel. All fans of Ten Little Indians know the two versions, the happy version and the dark version. Regardless of your favorite, and I'm not saying which list this fell onto, the film set and, indeed, location setting is virtually always the same. In fact, the same house on the same island has been used to film this multiple times. This version, for no particular reason, takes place in a desert hotel, 200 miles from the nearest town. For that reason alone, it is worth seeing, again, if you are a fan of the story, because, simply  put, it is unique and feels, somehow, new.

The Blu-ray edition is likely the best we will get, but, beyond that, it is actually an excellent quality release. Overall, I was very impressed with the film transfer. The disc is only a BD-25 but the film did not appear to suffer from lack of a BD-50. As an aside, at proper volume, the echo scene is eerily effective.

Good luck in making your selection.",1503100800,4,1679,4.334394904458598

119565,3,0790741296,"Interesting viewing for those who want to compare the various versions of Christie's most famous novel/play.  On first viewing many years ago, I could not find much to recommend about this version, with its constant use of wide-angle shots, muffled sound (due, probably, to post-dubbing), and somewhat questionable acting--especially on the part of Elke Sommer.  But, after watching the Blu-Ray edition of the movie, I must confess that it is not all that bad, even though I would still rank it as inferior to the 1945, 1965, 1987 (Russian), and 2015 (BBC) versions.  And I began to appreciate what I suspect are the reasons for the director's (over)use of wide-angle shots.

The accompanying audio commentary is good for the first 30 minutes or so of the movie's 98-minute running time, as the two commentators discuss some of the differences between this and other filmed versions.  But the commentary then bogs down into extended, repetitive reflections on the life and career of the movie's director, Peter Collinson, and, if you closed your eyes at that point, you would be unlikely to figure out (or care about) which of Collinson's movies the commentators were  talking about.

In short, a should-have for Christie completists, but I would strongly recommend most of the other movie versions for those who wish to be introduced to this terrific whodunit.",1501372800,2,1361,5.076233183856503

119568,5,0790741296,"Umpteenth retelling of Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None."" This 1974 version involves ten unrelated people (mostly high society types) invited to a vacant, posh hotel isolated in the Iranian desert. One by one they meet grisly deaths at the hands of an unseen killer and in line with the nursery rhyme. They begin to suspect each other after their unseen host greets them only by a recording (voice of Orson Welles). Great plot, great acting by familiar faces of the era, and a terrific elegant but spooky hotel setting. I didn't read the book and haven't seen much of the other versions, but I really liked this one. But hey I also liked 2003's ""Identity"" starring John Cusack & Ray Liotta, so I'm no purist.

119591,4,0790741296,"Fans of this author will know that the original title to Agatha Christie's celebrated 1939 mystery was deemed too insulty in the states and so was changed to And Then There Were None and, later, alternatively, to Ten Little Indians. Down the decades, there'd been a grip of film and television adaptations, the best being the 1945 incarnation. This 1965 adaptation is pretty sharp, never mind that the venue was relocated from a remote island to a secluded Alpine mansion and that Malcolm Lockyer's brassy, upbeat score tends to jar the mood. I wish I'd seen this in its original theaterical release, if only for the notorious whodunit break. Near the end of the screening, the movie pauses to allow the theater audience 60 seconds to venture a guess as to whodunit even as clues are laid out on the screen. Some people thought it tacky. I kinda think it a neat stunt.

When I first saw it on the small screen, I wasn't that enthused with its first few minutes. During the opening, we regard the black and white photography and scenic winter scenes of our eight weekend guests being conveyed to their mountaintop retreat by way of a ski-lift cab and horse-drawn sleighs, and the entire time the score that's playing is more in keeping with a mod comedy, and that just threw me off. The eight guests meet the two peculiar domestics, and there's your ten. Unnervingly, it's an absent host that greets them during supper thru a tape recorder, with an uncredited Christopher Lee contributing the voice. It's a disquieting message that vows to make the invitees pay for their past sins. Not too long after, the first victim croaks. Observe the serving tray that makes its way 'round the guests. It's a distinctive looking tray, decorated with ten Indian figures. As each guest/servant is gruesomely bumped off, a figure is snapped off the tray. An ominous touch.

In a roster composed of veteran English actors, nubile Shirley Eaton, maligned by critics as the film's token sexpot, may actually have turned in the best performance. It's a nice cast, minus one Fabian who stinks up the joint. He does give us his piano-backed rendition of the gristly ""Ten Little Indians"" nursery rhyme before he exits. The film isn't subtle in projecting Eaton and Hugh O'Brian as the prohibitive protagonists and the story's love interest, but you are left guessing as to whether they, too, will bite it. Off the top of my head, I can cite the 1987 Russian version - Desyat negrityat - as one adaptation that sticks to Christie's original morbid ending. For those who haven't yet seen this 1965 version, hey, maybe this one'll also keep faith. If you can ignore the bouncy score, maybe you can sink into the story. It's a good story. It's one of Christie's most remarkable conundrums, up there in ingenuity and sensationalism with Murder on the Orient Express, Curtain, and Who Murdered Roger Ackroyd? The fatalities are executed in diverse and colorful fashion. And for those who require respite from a strictly cerebral whodunit, Hugh O'Brian channels his role from his TV show, The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, and leaps into bombastic fisticuffs with the creepy, brawny help (Mario Adorf). I'm sure Agatha Christie would've nursed a frown at this shocking breach of drawing room etiquette. But, mostly, the movie sticks to its genre tropes: spying thru keyholes, creeping up and down stairs, lights mysteriously going out, and that dwindling crowd of survivors giving each other the side-eye. There's no end of suspects. In fact, it can be said that they're all suspects, seeing as how they're all guilty of past transgressions. There's doubt cast even on our lead guy O'Brian whose initials on his character's luggage doesn't match his presented name. This may be the most murdery of Christie's murder mysteries in that I think it presents the highest body count. How you take the resolution of this pickle hinges on how much you're a stickler for staying true to the source material and how sympathetic you find certain actors. I will say that Fabian, obnoxious and atrocious in his scenes, doesn't deserve to make it out alive. I betcha Frankie Avalon would've survived longer.",1467676800,,4165,4.856540084388186

119630,3,0790741296,"Earlier this year, I realized that Agatha Christie's stand alone book published now as And Then There Were None was actually a precursor to the slasher films that became popular in the late 70's and 80's.  I haven't seen any movie versions of the story until now, when I watched the 1965 version that goes by a previous title, Ten Little Indians.

This version of the story takes place at a remote castle high up a snowy mountain.  8 strangers and a married pair of servants arrive and quickly compare notes to learn they have all been invited there by Mr. Owen.  That night, their unseen host's voice starts to come over a recording and accuses each of them of committing a previous murder.  And then, one by one, they begin to drop dead.  Is there someone else in the house, or is one of them the killer?  Will anyone survive?

Before I get into the movie itself, I want to spend a little more time explaining my premise comparing this to a slasher film.  Very true, any blood is kept to a minimum, and there really aren't any stalking scenes.  One or two give you a little suspense before the person dies, but that's all.  Those who hate horror films will still enjoy this since the emphasis is on the puzzle of who is killing these people.

However, we do see the killer's hands appear a few times and there are some killer point of view shots.  The power goes out for the final evening of the film, so everything is happening in candle light.  Some of the conventions of a slasher are in place here, while other are avoided.  (I'm being vague here not to spoil anything).  Heck, we see a woman in her underwear a couple of times, rather shocking for the 1960's.  Finally, there's a cat around to provide those classic misdirection sounds.  (I can't figure out why else a cat would be at this location.)

Am I stretching things?  Most likely.  But my mind couldn't help but make the comparisons as I was watching it.

Okay, now that we have that behind us, how does this work as a mystery movie?  First of all, this follows the ending of the play, not the ending of the book.  I have mixed emotions on both endings, so I'm not sure which I like better.  There are other changes, like character names and manners of death, but for the most part it works.

This is probably one of Christie's most devilish puzzles.  Now maybe it's because I know who the killer is, but I felt this one actually emphasized the clues a bit too much.  My roommate figured it out after watching about 10 minutes.  When I listened to the book on tape, I never would have figured it out without being told at the end.  Of course, the plot does have to cheat since it requires the killer to confess instead of anyone figuring it out, but that's a complaint I have with the story in general.

The movie was filmed in black and white, but I think it works well.  The scenes are still vibrant and it adds a mysterious and threatening air to the proceedings.

Aside from the women screaming and getting hysterical at various times, I found most of the acting to be believable.  Fabian is the biggest ham of the cast, but he isn't a big part of things, so it's easy to forgive the movie that.  Others in the cast include Hugh O'Brian, Shirley Eaton, Stanley Holloway, Wilfrid Hyde-White, and Dennis Price.

The DVD was released a few years back, and I've got to take a star off for it.  There is dust and grain almost the entire way through the film.  It's very noticeable.  The film is widescreen and it claims to be full surround, although I never noticed anything coming from my back speakers.  The only extra is the ""Whodunit Minute.""  Apparently, this was part of the film in the theaters where the movie paused right before the climax and asked you who you thought it was.  It then gave you ""clues,"" when in reality, it just showed you all the murders to date again.  I'm glad it's not part of the film here since I thought it was rather stupid, but those who remember it and like it will be glad to have it, I'm sure.

Whether you know the story or not, this version of Ten Little Indians is certainly an enjoyable way to get acquainted with the basic concept.  It's too bad the DVD doesn't live up to the film's potential.",1432339200,,4203,4.373385012919897

This film is black and white is interesting locked room mystery, loosely based on the classic Christie novel.

An internation cast fill the parts of the Christie classic, led by Hugh O'Brien as Hugh Lombard, Fabian as the singer, Wilfred Hyde-White as the Judge,Denis Prince as the Doctor and Shirley (the Golden Girl from Goldfinger) Eaton. The cast blends together nicely.

It has a mod feel to this 1965 version. However it still work as a film. It does seem dated, but director  George Polock knows how to move the cast through their paces , so the audience won't be bored.

If you are a Christie fan, this mod (NOT modern) version may seem like a 1960's throwback, but it works as a mystery...even through some of the actors seem overly woooden and scene chewers  like Leo Genn, Daliah Lavi and Eaton, who seem to be TOO wide eyed in the whole movie

On the whole, for 90 minutes, you will be entertained

119669,2,0790741296,"In 1945, Agatha Christie's brilliant suspense novel and subsequent stage play, ""And Then There Were None,"" was memorably adapted into a first-rate, Hollywood black comedy gem with Oscar winners Barry Fitzgerald and Walter Huston leading an elite ensemble cast.  Shockingly, its studio, 20th Century Fox, goofed by allowing the film to fall into the public domain.  Subsequently shoddy remakes (a 1950's TV adaptation, a 1965 big screen retread, and then yet another go-around in 1974) focused on transplanting the macabre island setting to an isolated Swiss Alps chateau and later then to the Iranian desert.  Standard formula filmmaking reduced this classic serial murder mystery to a mere backdrop for a bland assortment of aging ""all-stars"" simply going through the motions.  Even by changing the killer's various murder methods and adding preposterous gimmicks, it is still evident that the vital element of surprise was badly missing from all these remakes.  This 1989 South African version (again, based upon the stage play) ineptly proves no different.

Starring Frank Stallone (Sylvester's brother); Sarah Maur Thorp (resembling a young Nicole Kidman); Herbert Lom (who also appeared in the 1974 rehash); Brenda Vaccaro; and Donald Pleasance.  This time, Christie's story occurs with the mysterious Mr. Owen's guests trapped on a South African safari.  Outside of reasonable faithfulness to the original novel's characters, the only intriguing twist is the South African scenery, which is cool to see.  Hence, mercenary hero Phillip Lombard (Stallone) is conveniently on his own home turf playing Mr. Owen's deadly game.  Considering Hollywood's previous overkill (pardon the expression) with Christie's story, it is really no shocker that the hapless production team conjured up a low-budget, totally forgettable clich-fest. Co-leads Stallone and Maur Thorp offer decent efforts, but they were just clearly outmatched.  Of the supporting cast, reliable screen veterans Lom, Vaccaro, and Pleasance provide this film some credibility that is ultimately wasted by a crummy script.

Rating: 2/5 stars (for undemanding adult viewers only).

P.S. Updated as of January 2015: I'm now aware of additional remakes.  There is an obscure 1987 Russian version, which, I understand, is the first to faithfully recreate Christie's original book down to its last bleak details.  In late 2015, the BBC will finally offer its own TV rendition (presumably based upon the novel).  Hopefully, the BBC will finally rekindle the mystery magic of ""And Then There Were None,"" aka ""Ten Little Indians.""",1399680000,3,2586,5.508860759493671

The second film adaptation of Christies novel in 1965, relocates the setting from an island, to a remote mountain retreat, but events still play out in a similar fashion, as eight guests and two servants, listen to a tape recording by an unknown host, accusing them of having escaped justice for various crimes, for which they will now be punished for.  Then in a manner following the childrens nursery rhyme Ten Little Indians, members of the group are murdered one by one.

The snowy mountain setting, provides for some interesting variations, but the updated narrative still has much of the suspense and atmosphere of Christies original tale, as the terrified victims scramble to survive.  For those who have read the book or have seen the previous film, this version won't contain many major surprises, but it is still an entertaining watch.  Having previously worked on the Miss Marple films featuring Margaret Rutherford (), director George Pollock is intimately familiar with Christies style, and does a nice job.

The cast features some fairly well known stars, including Hugh OBrian (), Shirley Eaton (hot after her golden appearance in&nbsp;), Wilfrid Hyde-White, Daliah Lavi (), and pop singer Fabian Forte (,).

119688,5,0790741296,"This 1965 film is based on the most famous novel ever, written by Agatha Christie who is still the world's most popular novel writer.  It is best appreciated if you read the book first so that you can spot the differences between the movie and the book.

The main difference is that the movie takes place on a remote snowy mountain top instead of an island.  The vehicle to take the guests to the mountain top is easily recognizable as the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway which had recently been opened and was considered to be an engineering marvel.  Also the movie is set in 1965 when it was filmed instead of pre-war 1939.

The main characters are Hugh O'Brian (television's Wyatt Earp) and Shirley Eaton.  A couple of scenes showing her undressed are more than enough to make the movie worth seeing.  There are a number of English actors to give the movie a proper British feel.  The most out-of-place character is played by Fabian, the fifties rock singer, whom the director mercifully eliminates by making him the first victim.  A somewhat incongruous element arises with the younger actors looking like they came from 1965 while the older actors are right out of 1939.

The movie generally follows the book except for a couple of incidents which accommodate the different setting.  Near the end there is a hint that the movie may have a different ending but then it reverts to the original story.  Things switch again at the very end when a surprise ""Hollywood ending"" emerges which is one of the few times, or maybe the only time, that a Hollywood ending is more satisfying than the underlying book.",1384041600,,1603,4.685714285714286

Each of them is accused of being a murderer and Mr. Owens wastes no time in punishing them for their crimes according to the children's rhyme, ""Ten Little Indians.""

This version of Agatha Christie's novel is tedious and inferior to the 1945 movie in many ways.  It uses virtually the same script, but the actors, with a few exceptions, aren't as good.  Wilfred Hyde-White, Stanley Holloway, and Dennis Price are very good as the judge, the detective, and the doctor, but Hugh O'Brian and Shirley Eaton are a stiff and unsympathetic leading couple while Daliah Lavi and Fabian's acting skills are laughable.

A major drawback is the upbeat jazz soundtrack which is completely out of place in a moody mystery.  The setting is another weak point; the ""castle"" is a cheaply-built wooden house (with a stair banister that wobbles at one point) and the mountaintop isn't really as inaccessible as it should be.  Too many of the characters view the mounting death toll as a subject for derision rather than fear, so the movie lacks intensity and thrills.  Disappointing.",1293667200,10,1274,4.8341013824884795

Although this version's background story is the same as the first movie version (ten people invited to a stranded area by a mysterious stranger and murdered in accordance to the lines in a children`s poem), this one takes place in a mansion that's on an isolated snowy mountain.  This version is also the first adaptation of the novel to show the murders on screen.  (The mansion used in the movie was a famous one located in Rush, North County, Dublin in Ireland.  It no longer exists.)

Who are these ten invited guests?  They are:

1. Engineer Hugh Lombard (Hugh O'Brian)
2. Secretary Ann Clyde (Shirley Eaton)
3. Singer Mike Raven (Fabian)
4. General Sir John Mandrake (Leo Genn)
5. Detective William Blore (Stanley Holloway)
6. Judge Arthur Cannon (Wilfred Hyde-White)
7. Actress Ilona Berger (Daliah Lavi)
8. Dr. Edward Armstrong (Dennis Price)
9. Maid Elsa Grohmann (Marianne Hoppe)
10. Butler Joseph Grohmann (Mario Adorf)

(Note that the recorded voice of the mysterious stranger who invited these guests {who has the appropriate name of ""U.N. Owen""} is the voice of Christopher Lee.)

Purists may not like this adaptation as it was altered to fit the attitude of the ""swinging sixties.""  Examples include changing the character of the spinster into a glamorous actress and adding much more action to compliment the mystery such as a fight scene and even a bedroom scene.

As well, the ending was changed to a less pessimistic one, borrowing heavily from the upbeat finale Christie wrote for the stage version of this story.

All the actors do a good job in their roles but I felt that Hugh O'Brian, Shirley Eaton (the Bond girl painted gold in the movie ""Goldfinger""), Wilfred Hyde-White, and Stanley Holloway did very good jobs.  Some people don't like Fabian's character.  But he's supposed to be obnoxious.  Fabian does a good job of singing the lines of the above poem.

The DVD itself (the one released in 2006) has good audio.  The picture has occasional flaws but they are not distracting.  There are two extras, one being a ""whodunit intermission.""

Finally, the only real problem (there are some minor ones) I had with this movie was the jazzy background music that occasionally plays.  Although it sounds good, it did not seem to belong in a movie of this type.

In conclusion, this is an interesting adaptation of Agatha Christie's most famous novel!!

119729,4,0790741296,"Dudley Nichols based his screenplay on the 1939 story by Agatha Christie. Under George Pollock`s direction we have a story of ten strangers lured to a mountain castle. Actually, two of them are married to each other.

The only mode of transportation to the top of the mountain is a cable car.  Hanging on a thread takes on new meaning in this film.

You have a great cast-Mario Adorf, Shirley Eaton, Fabian, Leo Glenn, Stanley Holloway, Marianne Hoppe, Wilfrid Hyde-White, Daliah Lavi, Hugh O'Brian, and Dennis Price. The interaction between these characters is priceless, especially as the murders begin.

All of these characters are hiding something.  However, the truth will be revealed.

The mysterious Mr. Owen is like a ghost, haunting the conscience and bringing to light the past.  An uncredited Christopher Lee was the voice of Mr. Owen.  Good choice.

The beautiful Kenure House in Rush County, Dublin was a perfect choice for film.  It is sad that this marvel of architectural design which lasted for centuries was left to die and eventually be demolished in 1978 for safety reasons.

The film transfer was good.  This black/white offering has held up well since 1965.

It would be well to read the nursery rhyme, Ten Little Indians, before you watch this film. Like any good mystery, the ending is a delight-like a cup of honeyed Rooibos tea. In fact, have a cup as you watch this presentation.",1265587200,4,1406,4.881856540084388

  Before I start telling you why this is my favorite movie, you might be wondering why I chose this over the 1945 version. Here's why: I was viewing Youtube on my Wii, and I came across the 1945 version. I watched the beginning, and didn't like it that much. I then went online to see what the other versions were like, and the 1965 version sounded the best.

 This movie has suspense, action, and a great actress as Anne Clyde.

 This movie has good picture, but at some times it can become grainy and be speckled with dust. But for a DVD that is 6 dollars, what do you expect?",1262044800,2,1270,4.530701754385965

119744,4,0790741296,"The Bottom Line:

A capable adaptation of Christie's best-known novel, Ten Little Indians is not a definitive version of the story (there never will be as long as they refuse to use the original ending) but it's probably a little bit better than the 1945 film and is worth watching if you liked the book.",1239494400,,304,4.527272727272727
119745,4,0790741296,"Twenty years after Rene Clair's black comedy adaptation of Agatha Christie's masterful suspense story, ""And Then There Were None,"" it was inevitable that a remake using the story's American title would be forthcoming.  Director George Pollock, who had also recently helmed Margaret Rutherford's campy Ms. Marple film series, set forth to remake Clair's film (based upon Ms. Christie's stage play) for a new generation with decidedly different, perhaps cultish tastes.  Did he succeed?  To some extent, Pollock makes good on adding fun updates to the basic story, but he also missed the mark in other vital areas.

1. Casting the trio of Shirley Eaton as Ann (aka Vera Claythorne); Hugh O'Brian as Hugh (aka Phillip Lombard); and hip icon Fabian as Mike Raven (aka Anthony Marston) was obviously a nod to pop culture's sizeable demographic.  Eaton and O'Brian share some decent romantic chemistry as the film's leads despite occasionally wooden acting.  However, their performances are still far superior to Fabian's amateurish efforts.  His obnoxious pop star is hardly missed after an abrupt exit.

The veteran British actors (Wilfrid Hyde-White as Judge Cannon; Dennis Price as Dr. Armstrong; Stanley Holloway as private eye William H. Blore; and Leo Genn as General Mandrake) provide intelligent but mostly drab performances that often blend together.  The emotionally unstable house servants (portrayed by Marianne Hoppe and Mario Adorf) give excellent support to the star players.  As for Daliah Lavi, her entirely new character (a glamorous actress) just seems forcibly inserted into the macabre plot and is a mediocre substitute for the novel's self-righteous spinster, Emily Brent.
Overall Grade: B (a pretty solid cast, minus Fabian.)

2. The locale switch from a stormy, isolated British island to a lavish Swiss Alps chalet isn't necessarily an improvement from the original film, but at least the wintry exterior adapts well as U.N. Owen's sinister stage.
Overall Grade: B+ (great location shots during the opening credits!)

3. The logic police should have reviewed this script before filming commenced.  For instance, there are two Americans and three Germans here, which makes U.N. Owen's choice of prey outside of England seem rather implausible. Further, a secret relationship in post-war Berlin is established between Leo Genn's General Mandrake and Lavi's conceited actress.  The whole point of Christie's story is that eight of the British ""Indians"" are supposed to be complete strangers, so no one should have a motive.  Hence, this film has its share of unnecessary gaffes in basic logic.  Blame it on Hollywood, I suppose.
Overall Grade: C (a few too many plot contrivances.)

4. Pollock recycles much of the Clair film's dialogue, but here it lacks the charmingly playful sparks the original actors provided.  For instance, at times, Dennis Price (as Dr. Armstrong) so flatly delivers his lines that it sounds like he is just reciting words from the script.  Despite the mostly unremarkable new dialogue, Hugh O'Brian, however, still gets in a few good retorts such as telling off Stanley Holloway (as Blore) by angrily replying ""Drop dead!""  Pun intended, of course.
Overall Grade: B- (the dialogue still holds up well today.)

5. The film's black & white ambiance is certainly appropriate for a classic murder mystery, but the jazzy instrumental score is too jarringly upbeat for this storyline.
Overall Grade: C+ (the cheery opening music suggests a romantic comedy romp in the snow, which this movie definitely is not.)

6. Lastly, unlike standard Christie adaptations, Pollock opts for a more grandiose (albeit bloodless) approach. The result is a mixed bag.  For instance, two characters are shown graphically plunging to their deaths, and the effect is appropriately shocking.  Yet, in a different sequence, the ominous murderer walks into an unlocked bedroom (another logic gaffe) with poisonous syringe in hand, and the victim (after seeing the culprit) doesn't even call for help despite ample opportunity.  In other words, some murders are very believable here, while others rely far too much on convenient luck for the villain.

The film also features a lengthy, unnecessary fistfight between the heroic Lombard and the violently paranoid butler.  Despite some good stunt work between actors Hugh O'Brian and Mario Adorf, this obvious filler material is out-of-place for the story, let alone in any Agatha Christie work.
Overall Grade: C- (this probably isn't a movie for pre-teens.)
____________________________________________________________________

Pollock's competent remake lacks the original film's tongue-in-cheek charm, but, in all fairness, the 1945 film at least had the element of surprise.  With remakes, adding surprises only emphasize that they are just gimmicks, such as this film's campy ""whodunit? break"" just before the finale.  You simply have to see it to believe it; it's that abrupt.  Yet, I can't think of another movie that has ever tried this same gimmick (and probably with good reason).

Nonetheless, ""Ten Little Indians"" certainly remains entertaining enough to deserve rediscovery by today's mystery buffs.  If you purchase this DVD, please keep some reasonable expectations, and the movie will make a nice investment of your time on some wintry night with the lights out, a beverage, and a bowl of popcorn.

Final Grade: B- (suffice to say, it is far superior than the two subsequent remakes in 1975 and 1989.)",1221436800,9,5478,5.346153846153846
119746,5,0790741296,"I first saw this on television, and was thrilled when it came out on DVD.  The movie is a bit dated, but the mystery is great (it is based on Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None""), the acting fun and even the music suits the picture and classic feel.

I highly recommend this movie to people who love mysteries or classic movies.

A side note:  Christie converted the novel into a play and altered the ending - the play's ending, rather than the novel's, is used in this movie.",1212624000,2,485,4.355555555555555

119749,2,0790741296,"I bought this VHS tape because I've seen (I think) all the other film and TV adaptations of Christie's book and was interested to see how this turned out. While I don't know if I agree with an earlier reviewer who said it was ""bad, really really bad"" it certainly isn't good. Even if you did not judge this film against the earlier renditions of 10 Little Indians this would have to be tagged as a very below average film.

This adaptation has none of the suspense of the Russian version and none of the ""fun"" of the 1940s or 1965 version. The acting is ham handed and the unfolding of the mystery so masterfully done in the earlier versions (even the oddly cast 1974 version with Elke Sommers) here is awkward and almost laughable.

The concept of setting the story in Africa is somewhat intriguing but (as mentioned in previous reviews) you get no sense that Mr. Owen is driving the murders. They just sort of occur. There is no menace or reason behind the mayhem. And even though these people are supposedly cut off from the rest oof civilization there is no real sense of isolation conveyed throughout the movie. You get the impression that if they just got off their collective backside and started to walk they could make it out of there.

All in all this was a disappointing film. If you're interested in seeing Christie's story on screen I would recommend pretty much any of the other versions.",1190764800,6,1402,4.533596837944664
119750,3,0790741296,"As someone who enjoys Agatha Christie, it was interesting to finally catch up with one of the lesser known (or at least lesser discussed) movie versions of one of her works.  For what it's worth, here's what I thought of 1965's ""Ten Little Indians"" (beware some spoilers):

Selling points:  A fetching Shirley Eaton (fresh from ""Goldfinger""), good sets, somewhat dark and moody proceedings, and (generally) good acting by a bunch of old pros.

Liabilities:  Typical 60's ""mod"" music score totally at odds with the mood of impending doom that the images (especially during the opening credits) are trying to convey; a softening of Christie's edgy, memorable, original plot where EVERYBODY is dead by novel's end (gotta cobble together that happy ending for the ticker buyers); Fabian overacting a storm in his (thankfully) brief appearance; and the use of a marginal print of the film for the DVD (to be clear, the image is perfectly watchable but marred with frequent scratches, fading, and other annoyances).

Agatha Christie fans will likely get at least light enjoyment out of this, if for no other reason than to experience an adaptation of one of Dame Agatha's most famous novels.  Young people might also enjoy it, as they'll probably get into the whole scary thriller vibe where one person after another is mysteriously knocked off.

But, overall, this is an amiable time passer and nothing more.  It does make me want to seek out the 40's-era adaptation of the same story (titled ""And Then There Were None"", like many editions of the novel), because if this marginal film still manages to be fairly entertaining, I can imagine how good a well regarded adaptation of the story should be.

Extras include a bunch of trailers to other 60's-era Christie adaptations (which don't look all that great, either) and the ludicrous ""whodunit break"" that was originally inserted into prints of ""Ten Little Indians"" during its theatrical run.  During this one-minute interruption (complete with annoying, game show-style ""ticking clock"" imagery), audience members were encouraged to discuss their theories about who the murderer might be with ""the person sitting next to you in the theater"".  I imagine that probably went over like a lead brick.",1188950400,3,2241,5.092896174863388

True to the older films, the tension of the film is brought about by solid acting, instead of CGI or special effects.  The rising action is smooth as the guests of Mr. U. N. Owens arrive at a remote mansion and learn their host has not arrived.  Each of the characters get an opportunity to present a bit about themselves and then the man servant plays a record from Mr Owen explaining all the guests are there because they have gotten away with murder.

Central to the theme is a centerpiece holding small statues of Ten Little Indians.  One by one the little Indians get broken off their mounting and someone in the house has died.  Soon there are only two little Indians left and the climax of the film is at hand.  There are plenty of clues and red herrings for the armchair detective to grasp and form their own conclusions.  The falling action is quick and answers provided.

But if you don't mind a few ""hip"" changes, then you will have a lot of fun with this version.  It's a clever mix of classic British actors sprinkled with a few ""icons"" from the period.  The styles and fashions of the women in the film are very cool.  The location change to a Swiss chalet sitting atop a snow covered mountain adds to the isolation and ""chill"" of the situation.  And the performances of the cast are just what they should be for their character.  ""Over the top"" from some?  Yes!  ""Subtle and witty"" from others?  Yes!  ""Taking it all too serious"" from the rest?  Yes!  But it all adds up to the ""fun"" of this interpretation of the Christie story.  The black and white filming, the on-screen murders and the castle itself all contribute to the suspense factor of the film.  The ""jazz"" score helps to lighten up the proceedings and gives the film a good balance.

Positives:  The setting switch from a deserted island to a remote desert palace is a bit off-putting at first, but it works.

Most of the actors are pretty decent, and it was interesting to see actors who played two classic Bond villains here.  I particularly liked the energetic performance from Charles Aznavour at the outset of the film.

The atmosphere throughout the film was very good.

Negatives:

Oliver Reed was not a particularly good choice as the star High Lombard.  And neither was Elke Summer, who played Vera.

The sound was pretty awful, with a weird humming in the first third of the film that made it hard to hear the dialogue, which was especially problematic due to the lack of subtitles.

Too often they telegraph the murders, to the point where the avid watcher who has never read the book can at least eliminate certain suspects.

They also play a quasi-romance between Vera and Lombard, which doesn't really work in the context of the film, let alone the actors carrying their parts.

Also, one of the murders has the victim trying to escape, only to die of thirst due to a sabotaged survival kit.  The rest of the victims only assume that he was murdered by the broken doll and don't even consider him as a suspect, while a later victim who disappears is considered a suspect.
