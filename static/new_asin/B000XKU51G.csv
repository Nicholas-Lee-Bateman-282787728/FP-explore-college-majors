The steps are very well shown and explained on the video so much so that these complex and intricate Tango moves can be understood  and internalized by any viewer in a very short period of time. The beginners will discover a new path to express their passion and sensuality, and the experts will have a chance to refine and polish their Tango techniques to a brillance that will take everyone`s breath away...
Remember: studies show that people remember merely 20% of what they hear, and only 30% of what they see, and an overwhelming 70% what they hear and see. With this in mind, it is obvious why this Tango video can be such a powerful learning tool.
In short, a professional video production that can help guide all Tango lovers from the very basic footsteps to the impenetrable subtleties of self-expression in the Tango dance.",1195516800,2,944,4.7560975609756095
8524894,5,B000XKU51G,"Hi everyone,

My wife and I are only beginners at Argentinian Tango and need all the help we can get. Without some kind of visual aid it's hard to remember the moves and Alain and Cheryl's DVD is just the answer. It's very clear with simple, progressive, instructions for both the men and woman's parts. The solo violinist creates a beautiful and tasteful musical backdrop that is not distracting.

This one really works!
