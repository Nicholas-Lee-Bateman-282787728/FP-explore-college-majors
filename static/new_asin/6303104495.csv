568063,5,6303104495,"A great way to introduce yourself to the whole crazy world of Japanese animation, otherwise known as ""anime"". Here Project A-Ko makes fun of itself: lots of oversized robot warriors, explosive violence,  exaggerated action, alien invasion, and of course, those fun-loving girlies  with huge jewel-like eyes, multi-colored hair, and why not? ...the usual  cute sailor-style uniforms with the flaring pleated skirt and the perky red  ascot at the heaving young bosom!
 Here in the story, our young  heroine, A-Ko with the fiery red hair takes advantages of her superstrength  and her blonde friend C-Ko's persistent urging to make it to the school at  the very last moment one morning. This is where the great eye-popping anime  drama unfolds: a few certain characters like the filthy-rich B-Ko with her  strange hairdo and a gorilla-like spy from the outer space are increasingly  interested in the babbling infant like C-Ko despite her silly behavior and  bad cooking. Thus A-ko finds herself a reluctant protector to her best  friend and had to fight off a whole line of towering robots that the brainy  B-Ko had so rapidly invented. And in the meanwhile, a shady queen of the  alien warfare is hatching a sly scheme to GRAB the innocent young C-Ko and  make off with her for ... a very surprising reason.
 A very  rollicking trip so full of rib-tickling visual gags, white-knuckled action,  and plenty of subtle suggestions like B-Ko's obvious lesbian love for the  little C-Ko in the name of ""friendship"" as well as such naughty  shots of A-Ko's snow-white undies as she fights fiercely to kick some big  robot's behind and grip her poor fingernails onto the smooth surface of a  zooming jet as it flew kamikaze-type toward the monstrous alien spaceship!  You'll be giggling nonstop!",957744000,,1786,4.996598639455782

568065,5,6303104495,"This is one of the first and best Japanese amime movies I found, back in 1991... or something. I just LOVE B Ko, she is a stud!  This movie combines great fighting with a very Japanese plot. I think C Ko is the scariest  thing I have ever seen. KAWAIIIIIIIIIII!",954720000,,261,4.2
568066,5,6303104495,"Forget Akira, this sugar-high story of girls A, B, C and an alien invasion is the ultimate in anime fan entertainment. It's been available in the US for a comparatively long time; hence it has been surpassed in  name-recognition by more popular action series. Its sales were probably  boosted in the early 90s by the ominous CONTAINS NUDITY (for it was the era  when anime was still 'cartoons') branded on the cover; its harmless five  seconds are nothing in the tentacle era. Yet dedicated anime fans still  grin when Project A-ko is mentioned, for it is a wonderful and whimsical  foray into the real of animated satire and slapstick humor.
For this  reason, casual fans or newbies might be confused by Project A-ko. About the  only broad appeal the movie has lies with its high quality animation,  dynamic character designs, and wild machines. But while these contribute  greatly to the film, Project A-ko's true attraction is as a satire of the  anime of the 1980s.
Macross/Robotech, Captain Harlock, Fist of the North  Star, Yamato/StarBlazers, and many other series too numerous to mention are  targets in Project A-Ko; I notice some new reference every time I watch it.  For fans aware of the significance of these, A-Ko is side-splitting,  although one need not be informed to be entertained. The characters in  themselves are great: A-Ko, B-Ko, and C-ko were so named by creator Yuji  Moriyama, who was basing his story around three girls. He couldn't decide  what to name them, hence the names Girls A, B, and C. They are  stereotypical anime girls in many ways (A-Ko is always late to school, B-Ko  is a super-rich zaibatsu daughter with an evil laugh and an old score to  settle, and C-Ko is a nauseatingly cute brat with no attention span), but  are crazy enough to be some of the most memorable characters of the genre.
Finally, true weirdness is what really makes Project A-Ko a classic.  From Dirty Pair levels of destruction and cross-dressing alcoholic aliens  to deadly Pepsi cans and Colonel Sanders to B-Ko clad in a revealing  battlesuit (the infamous Agakiyama 23 M-Class) firing unlimited reserves of  mini-missiles at everything, Project A-Ko was rightly described as  ""The Holy Grail of Anime"" by Antarctic Press. Moriyama's  whimsical rollercoaster and satire of all Japanese things on acetate  belongs in any true anime fan's collection.
Then you too can wonder  exactly *why* B-Ko 'wants' C-Ko, and you too can meet A-Ko's father, which  explains a hell of a lot... ^^
(Skip the sequels and the dubbed  version, though, they are particular letdowns.)",929923200,5,2579,4.9393939393939394

7838517,2,6303104495,"Very disappointed in these 'sequels.' The original Project A-Ko I immensely enjoyed as one of the first Anime films I saw in the 90's and it's still fantastic. I was so excited to see the sequels, but what a let down.

First of all one of the big factors bringing this down are the voices. The original English cast was fantastic, but they have all been replaced for these three sequel OVAs. It really hurts it as it doesn't really feel like the same characters you loved.

The second aspect that boggles my mind is the production values in general. I'm led to believe that the theatrical release of the first film in Japan was ""wildly successful."" So then why did we not get a true theatrical sequel. The movie felt big and open, these three short OVA sequels feel small and more like sitcom episodes. If you expect to see more of the knock-down, drag-out fights between Ako and Bko that were animated so fantastically in the film, forget about it, there's none of that here.

It's hinted at the end of the film and in these sequels that Ako is the daughter of Superman and Wonder Woman, so she's a super hero coming into her own, already with a nemesis in the form of Bko. However, all of that is dropped for the low-budget sitcom feel of these sequel stories. Moreover, since these are very short, they each feel as though they are on fast forward, whereas the original film had a great structure and pace.

Do yourself a favor and just stick with the original movie.",1472774400,,1470,4.4535315985130115

7838520,1,6303104495,"I have noooo idea why people like it. The story is awful, the plot is boring and the characters are extremely shallow. It is not even funny!! It's about two teenage girls fighting for the affections of another little crybaby girl. What is so interesting about that? The events in the film have absolutely no connection and the plot is random.",1115251200,,342,4.622950819672131
7838521,3,6303104495,"All things considered this one is probably better than the first one.  I just had one problem, different voices.  Most of the voices on this one are probably best known for their roles in Ranma 1/2.  Venus Terzo (girl-type Ranma) really didn't make a good B-KO I thought.  C-KO, who's always been a bit annoying, is played by the actor who plays Shampoo on Ranma, which her high pitch voice adds to the annoyment.  But worst yet, the captain from the first A-KO, who I thought was a man, is really a woman.
Scott Mcneil did a good job playing him/her, except when he sings.  If you watch the Japanese version then everything's the same.  I would recommend checking it out if you're a big A-KO fan.",1068508800,,697,4.440944881889764
7838522,5,6303104495,"A-ko and C-ko are friends. Pretty close friends. At an all girls school. Yeah. And B-ko is jealous. Classic otaku goodness, giant robot style. See aliens that look like men.......The remaining three episodes in the series with lots of extras like, music videos, a bunch of trailers, A-kos deleted cheesecake shot, etc. This is 5 star material, hands down.",1015200000,,355,5.033898305084746
7838523,5,6303104495,"Man, I didn't know it at first, but on this disc are the 3 sequals to the original Project A-Ko masterpiece. I own Project A-KO on DVD, and was going to waste most of my money on buying the stupid VHS versions. If you have seen the first Project A-KO movie and want the best sound quality ever, order this. Most Animes on their dubbed version usually lose most of their sound quality as well, so just switch it over to Japanese format.",991958400,,435,4.253012048192771
7838524,5,6303104495,"This DVD contains three of the four project A-ko movies.  There are also two other movies nicknamed the ""Versus movies"" which do not really continue on in the plot.  This DVD contains the three sequels to the original Prokect A-ko movie.
I did not find the other movies as wonderful as the original but they are definately worth a look.
Plot of Daitokuji Group is the second installment in the series, named after B-ko's family, which involves the aliens asking for A-ko's and B-ko's help during their summer vacation.  However B-ko's rich father has other plans for the aliens.
Cinderella Rhapsody is the third movie.  A-ko's falls in love with K which upsets C-ko. A-ko gets a job so she can buy the perfect dress she spies in a window display. B-ko becomes obsessed with K as well. C-ko is very distraught by this lack of attention. K however likes C-ko.
Final is the last movie of the project A-ko series.  Miss Ayumi, the girl's teacher is lonely so she agrees to an arranged marriage. However Mr. Daitokuji (B-ko's father) is arranging the marriage.  Meanwhile a fleet of spaceships is arriving and there is a newly discovered pyramid in Egypt.  Quite Odd.
All the movies are really cute and have comical and excellent plots complimented with great music.  Be warned there are latent homosexual themes in the movies as well as minor nudity.  These three movies are like the first one in the fact that they are all knock-off's of other popular anime and Japanese movie series.  I highly recommend this DVD.",989280000,15,1511,4.732824427480916
