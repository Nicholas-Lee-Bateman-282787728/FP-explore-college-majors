5026454,5,B006WZIF7W,I must say that I am a die hard fan of the original Looney Tunes and I still find this show to be quite good for what it is.  That being said I was not happy with the original dvd release of this show with four episodes per disc.  This volume combines the first three discs at a much better price for what you are getting.  F.Y.I. walmart already has this in stock if you want to pick it up now.  I don't know how they pulled that of but I already have mine.,1332547200,12,458,3.8404255319148937
5026455,4,B006WZIF7W,"Don't get me wrong this is one of my favorite shows. It's been critized for it's rare use of slapstick and ""sitcom"" format but I see it as a different version that doesn't really have to follow norm with it's older counterpart series. The art looks amazing but it's a shame there is no bluray release in the foreseeable future. Sadly Warner Brothers has decided to milk the hell out of this show and release it the old ""Singles"" way with 4 episode dvds... like the title states, this could have been easily averted if they would have just released this product from the get go with 12 episodes for 18 bucks is well worth the money (even if we aren't getting a full season box yet). I'd certainly would give this a shot. It's a PG show so be weary when showing this to minors, just in case but really they should be fine :)

Hate the singles format but get this 3pack version instead which has the first three dvds!",1329350400,19,914,4.313953488372093

5026463,5,B006WZIF7W,"Full of sarcasm and the humor we've come to love and expect from Looney Toons. This is by far my family's favorite Looney Toons series. My only complaint is there is no set for the second season. Also, be sure you are buying the full set because season 1 is divided into 3 DVDs and each are sold separately.",1481068800,3,307,4.220338983050848

5026468,5,B006WZIF7W,"I love this so much! It may be a little unsettling at first, but it's a great show. Old friends in a new setting is fantastic!

What is going on here?",1440201600,3,306,3.796875
5026469,5,B006WZIF7W,"I grew up on the old school Looney Tunes.  When I happened to randomly catch this show on Cartoon Network I found it absolutely hilarious. Its like a cartoon version of Seinfeld. Watching it as a kid and now as an adult the situations that the characters are in completely makes sense based on the characters personalities growing up. Bugs and Daffy live together. Daffy is a freeloader. Yosemite Sam is their neighbor and works at the DMV, Wile E Coyote was in the waiting room for a therapist reading a book called ""what are you really chasing"". Its just great. I highly recommend it to fans of the old show and people who have never seen looney tunes before.",1436659200,2,661,4.508333333333334

5026478,1,B006WZIF7W,"I had THE WORST exprerience. I will never buy from them again. I ordered a dvd as a christmas present for my brother. I recieved a dvd, but it was the wrong one. I called Amazon right away. They told me the dvd was sent as a gift from the seller. I did not pay for it, nor did i need to and that i shoul dstill expect the package i was waiting for. I didn't care for the dvd so i gave it away as a christmas present. Then 2 months later still nothing. I contacted the seller and they said they sent the item and it was recieved. I told them repeatedly that I HAD NOT, but they said that i did, so therefore there was nothing they could do.
I told them about the dvd i recieved and what amazon had told me, and they told me to promptly return it for a refund, but they could not send me the dvd I ordered and I would have to re-order it on my own. I told them I no longer had it and gave it away because amazon assured me it was a gift.... In short, it was a nightmare!! And no, I never got the dvd i ordered.",1395619200,,1008,3.759433962264151

5026480,5,B006WZIF7W,"I love this show, and while the second season episodes flowed much better than the first season (I'm not a fan of the musical numbers in between storylines), I still had to have season 1 on dvd, even if it was broken up into separate releases.  This particular one has the first 12 episodes of season 1 and while it was a rough ride of introductions and seeing classic characters in different roles (the tazmanian devil as Bug's pet dog is a little odd, but still entertaining), but overall this show grows on you pretty quickly.",1383436800,,529,4.510416666666667
5026481,1,B006WZIF7W,"Oh my gosh, do I hate this show! It ruins the whole point of the classic cartoon! The original had fast paced slapstick comedy; that made me laugh so darn hard! But THIS?! This is the most boring, insulting spin- off you could make! The animation is boring, the episodes, are boring, the dialogue is slow, and the characters are, you guessed it- boring! That is definitely not what comes to mind when I think of Looney Tunes. I am NEVER going to buy this show! I prefer the original cartoons! The GOOD ones!",1380153600,2,507,4.404255319148936

5026487,4,B006WZIF7W,"The first several episodes of The Looney Tunes Show reeked of fear - nobody wanted to be the one who screwed up the WB classic cartoon franchise.  Every decision was the ""safe choice"".  Bugs was transformed from a lower class smartass to an overly comfortable bored snob who was more than a little pleased with himself.  While the original Bugs would happily harass a jerk who insulted him three times (""of course you know, dis means wawr!"") ""The Looney Tunes Show's"" take had the rabbit sulk because Daffy forgot his birthday.  The same was true of the other characters - blandness as far as the eye could see.

The show's salvation came through a minor character that nobody cared much about - Lola Bunny.  Originally created in the feature film ""Space Jam"", Lola was a cypher.  The bunny was limed to a quick wiggle of her ass, a self-satisfied smirk, followed by a rapid exit off the screen.  When Kristen Wiig took over the part, the character came alive, and the show followed suit.  She transformed Lola into a combination of Lauren Bacall and Gracie Allen by way of a San Fernando Valley coffee shop.  Her Lola is literally insane, and causes carnage wherever she goes.  Better still, the voice actors upped their game when they shared a scene with Kristen.  Eventually, the entire show followed her lead and the Looney Tunes Show got, well, looney.  .",1357257600,8,1360,4.687763713080169

5026490,3,B006WZIF7W,"When I heard Cartoon Network was making new episodes of the Looney Tunes, I was a little skeptical.  I knew we wouldn't have Elmer Fudd pointing a gun in anyone's face.  I also doubted we would have any of the dynamite or falling anvils that were prevalent in the 90's with Animaniacs or Tiny Toons.  However, I certainly wasn't expecting the sitcom format they came up with.  I also wasn't expecting a 22 minute episode with the same storyline (really would have preferred 5-15 minute shorts that are prevalent on Cartoon Network with Adventure Time and Regular Show Adult Swim).

Personally, I would have rated the show 1 star, 2 at very best.  However, as I read the other reviews, I realize that I'm probably not the target audience, having grown up on the classics; that's why I went middle of the road with 3 stars.  If you go into the show with no prior knowledge, you might be able to enjoy it, but I just can't.",1351382400,2,920,4.473053892215569
5026491,2,B006WZIF7W,"I have tried to watch this version of Looney Tunes, but it will never be as awesome as the Mel Blanc versions. The cartoon is crystal clear and beautiful - colors are vibrant in the animation, the actors do a pretty good job with the characters, but the stories are not as witty as the originals. The essence of these characters just seem to be missing from this new modern version. I am hopeful WB will distribute more of the originals in DVD format for the public.",1347926400,,466,4.367816091954023
