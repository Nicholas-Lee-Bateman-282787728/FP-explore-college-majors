5736285,1,B00CRVL5Z4,"This bundle does one thing very well. It effectively shows you just how terrible most of the Marvel movies were before the ""Avengers"" series began (Avengers series = IM1, IM2, Thor, Captain America, Hulk, Avengers).

X1 and X2 - these movies are ok. I loved them when they came out, but watching them now, in the post-Avengers era, is a bit of a chore. They're still decent though.

X3 - this movie is an abomination against comic book movies. I saw this in the theater the night before I got married. My wife should be thrilled that I was able to pull myself out of bed the next day after watching this movie.

Xmen First Class - Ok. This one I like. Fun, exciting.

Wolverine - I was wrong. THIS movie is an abomination against comic book movies. The story was terrible. The fighting and action was terrible. The guy who played Gambit...what kind of accent was he going for there? They ruined Deadpool! ARGH!!!

FF & FF2 - these movies are just bad. As in BAD. Jessica Alba as Sue Storm? Seriously? Chris Evans as the Human Torch was awesome which is why I'm glad they grabbed him to play Captain America. The rest of the movies are cheesy, silly, and just bad.

Daredevil & Elektra - Ben Affleck's career suffered because of Daredevil. He's only recently started to recover. Enough said. Elektra was made simply because of contractual obligations. It shows. Don't watch either of these.

So, let's count...out of 9 movies only 1 is worth watching over and over. 3 are worth watching if I throw in X1 and X2. You can get those 3 movies much cheaper seperately so don't bother with this bundle. Otherwise you might be tempted to actually watch X3, Wolverine, FF, FF2, Daredevil, or Elektra. Please, don't.",1374105600,96,1706,4.573770491803279

All of them are on Blu-Ray mind you. So why the heck would any sane person spend nearly 80 dollars more on this when they could buy them all separately for less? It's a total freaking rip off.

Never buy movie bundles like this because a majority of the time, You could get all the movies in the collection at a much cheaper price than you would this. Even then, Half of these movies flat out suck (Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Elektra). The only ones worth buying are the Xmen ones and even then it only cost 70 bucks to get it in a separate bundle.

Each DVD was also individually wrapped in their own plastic so it looks like you bought them individually after you open the outer layer of plastic.

When he opened the box(plastic disc holder) the disc inside was ""28 Days"", not X-Men. He looked at me and said  this must of been a ""used"" set that was repackaged incorrectly. I was embarrassed to say the least that he thought I would buy used blu-rays knowing how he is about stuff like that. Amazon replaced it immediately but what if he hadn't opened that movie until a month from now. I would not have got a replacement due to the length of time it would have taken him to discover it. I am very disappointed in Amazon and am now hesitant about ordering movies. I have not asked what he thinks of the movies because I want the whole episode to be forgotten. For Christmas he wants the Doctor Who: Series 1-7 Limited Edition Set for $299.99.

5736322,5,B00CRVL5Z4,"This is not intended to be a review of each movie but rather a review of the overall purchase. It is important to clarify that I purchased this set as a $59.99 Deal of the Day in July of 2013. At the specific price I feel this is a very good deal for hard core Marvel Universe fans to help fill out their movie collection. At a significantly higher price I probably wouldn't have made this purchase as some of theses movies probably aren't worth it. I may have been more inclined to purchase only some of them.

As far as the specific movies go you should judge them on your own. Most people consider some of these to be relative stinkers. I personally don't mind lesser movies and don't judge comic book movies too harshly. If you look at these as simply escapism for a rainy day then there is enjoyment value in all of these. But to each his own!

Note: I am writing this in Nov 2013 and the current list price is $85. That's not bad but still $25 more than I paid. If you hesitant on this you might want to put a watch on it and hope for another sale!",1384732800,8,1054,4.111650485436893

This is soley my opinion, but other than X-Men First Class none of these movies are that good. FF, DareDevil, and Elektra were horrible from the get go. The original X-Men trilogy was off to a good start but last stand ruined everything 1 & 2 did. Wolverine orginis was a decent ""auto pilot"" movie but was still nothing special in my opinion.

However, normally we are so busy that I do most of my movie watching on my tablet or phone at airports and during flights.

However, I bought the set at $179 and next day, the price was down to $139. Yes, I did contact Amazon and they did adjust the price avoiding having to return and re-buy.

however, some said that the bundle price was higher than if you bought them individually - that was not true even at $179 and definitely false at $139. Obviously, what should be the appropriate discount for a bundle compared to individual movies? well, I have seen producers mark down bundles from 20% to 70% so there is no right answer.

So be careful - if you see it for more than $139, just wait. But the movies themselves are classic hits (of course, you have to be in to this stuff)",1374451200,,772,4.429577464788732
5736360,3,B00CRVL5Z4,"As a comic fan who grew up in the 80s, the idea that there would one day be as many Marvel Comics movies as there are would have been inconceivable.

With this bundle, you get two fun Fantastic Four movies, a tolerable Daredevil/Elektra combo, and all of the X-Men movies released so far (July 2013).

At $60 for the group, there aren't really any complaints to be had. It's nine Marvel Comics movies, several of which include some pretty exhaustive special features, bundled nicely. They may not be as ""sexy"" per se as the as Disney/Avengers films, but so what? There's love in the creation of each of these -- even the goofy Origins: Wolverine movie.

I can't defend a $139 price, but should they ever come on sale for $60, by all means, go for it.

One more note: X-Men: First Class is among the very best of the Marvel films. It's well directed, well acted, set in a great era, and helps to round out the entirety of the X-Men franchise. I've got high hopes for Days of Future Past!",1374451200,14,986,4.4010989010989015
5736361,4,B00CRVL5Z4,"I am going to write a review on these movies, not the price as others seem to be worried about and reviewing. These are great summer popcorn flicks. Yes they are old and can be seen on tv most of the time, but you do not get crystal clear blu ray quality on TV. This is a great collection if you are late to he game in watching X Men or need to upgrade your standard definition DVD copies. All of he bonus features are also included in this collection. I've noticed some studios are only giving you the movie with no bonus features if you buy a second pressing, so the inclusion of bonus features is a plus for those that care about them.

I have enjoyed almost every movie in this collection, especially the X Men films. It is true that some of these are not masterpieces, but they all are enjoyable. If you can afford it, or it goes on sale again, pick this up.",1374364800,6,863,4.136904761904762
5736362,1,B00CRVL5Z4,"Three great Marvel films (First Class, X-Men, and X2) packaged with six of the worst films Marvel has to offer. With the outrageous price of $139, you have what's called a blatant ripoff. You could buy all of these separately for much less. Don't fall into this trap.",1374278400,16,267,4.583333333333333
5736363,1,B00CRVL5Z4,Most of the movies are old-enough that you could get them on Bluray for less than $10... Or bad enough that you don't want them.,1374192000,17,128,4.16
5736364,5,B00CRVL5Z4,"With this bundle, you get the full X-Men ""experience"" and more. Assuming you're a fan of the X-Men Trilogy and the follow ups (X Men series is about children who have mutated to have super special powers) the X-Men Trilogy consisting of X-Men, X-Men United and X-Men 3: The Last Stand; and the follow ups to the Trilogy -  X-Men Origins: Wolverine and X-Men: First Class. There are lot of xtras including an interactive documentary, special effects, costume/ makeup, marketing material such as trailers, TV spots and web Interstitials - all in digital dolby sound.

PLUS you also get the Fantastic Four and Fantastic Four 2 (With sexy Jessica Alba),  Daredevil and Elektra.

So if you are into humans who get super powers by mutation and use it to fight the evil, this collection is for you!",1374192000,3,791,4.751824817518248
5736365,4,B00CRVL5Z4,"While there are some movies in a series that aren't the best, most of these movies are worth owning.  At this price, you are basically getting three movies for free.  This is a great way to build your Blu Ray collection on the cheap.  Thanks Amazon!",1374105600,16,249,4.369565217391305
