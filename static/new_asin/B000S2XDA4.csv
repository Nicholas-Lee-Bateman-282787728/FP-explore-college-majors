2879421,5,B000S2XDA4,"I now own all of the series of Only Fools And Horses and in my opinion you could scour the world of all comedy series and it would beat them hands down, Friends, I love lucy, and every other great comedy tv series were in there own right out of the top draw, but, only fools and horses is after watching all of the greats the very very best of all time. If you can sit and watch it without absorbing these hilarious characters and falling over laughing then you must be dead from the neck down. 10 out of 10 and , quite Simply. The best of all time .",1234828800,3,550,3.963963963963964
2879422,5,B000S2XDA4,"If you like the most famous British series ""Only fools and horses"", but you do not yet have the ""Specials"", then buy them right away.

2879423,5,B000S2XDA4,"For those of us who really enjoy British humor, this is a wonderful series.  The shenanigans of these two brothers always provide a good laugh.  The writing and acting are superb.",1226361600,,179,4.741935483870968

2879426,5,B000S2XDA4,"If you are from london England and now living across the otherside of the pond, you will just love the christmas specials of only fools and horses.

2879428,1,B000S2XDA4,Discs 1 through 3 skip and stick and disc 4 won't play at all. My rating is because of this. I love all the other OFAH I have purchased.,1396483200,,136,3.7241379310344827
2879429,5,B000S2XDA4,I have watched these many times over and never get tired of the actors and storylines. This is one of the best if not the best British comedy series ever made.,1390694400,,159,4.161290322580645
2879430,1,B000S2XDA4,"The rating is not for the content, I love this show, the rating is for the manufacturing problems that plague this release. If you buy this set, make sure to sit down and watch it all immediately.

2879431,5,B000S2XDA4,"We could not stop laughing it was fantastic, it also brought the series to a conclusion really sad that they did not make any more. Oh well just have to start watching them all over again.",1382227200,,188,4.25
2879432,5,B000S2XDA4,"I needed to complete my collection of Only Fools and Horses.  This is sort of an English Sandford and Son, about two brothers living on the margin of society by buying and selling cheap merchandise.  The Specials lack some of the warm humor from the original series, but are still very good.",1367452800,,291,4.576923076923077
2879433,5,B000S2XDA4,"Perfect complement to the Season 1-7 box set, finishes the collection off (is in effect season 8 onward). Only thing missing between this and the Season 1-7 set is the Jolly Boys Outing episode.",1337731200,,194,4.735294117647059
2879434,3,B000S2XDA4,"My husband about cried when he opened this! He loves this show from when he was growing up. Unfortunately, when we got to the 4th disc it won't play.

2879435,5,B000S2XDA4,This is nice to have all the specials on one disc. As usual the comedy is of the highest standard and with the longer running times of the specials they really build a story full of laughs. Not to be missed!!!,1243036800,,209,4.121951219512195
2879436,5,B000S2XDA4,"Great series.  I've lived in the USA for almost 20 years and this brings back fond memories of Britain.  This is good, clean familly entertainment.",1235433600,,147,4.84

8204157,1,B000S2XDA4,"1 star not for the content, but for the quality of the discs.  Amazon has sent me 3 of these.  Each time the first 3 discs skipped and froze.  The fourth disc was corrupted and would only play the last episode.  We even ordered a new dvd player from Amazon in case the problem was with our older dvd players.  Of course Amazon is refunding our money.  They are really good about that.  They have advised that they will look into the problem.  I would not order this dvd set, unless you want to be dissapointed.  That being said.  What we could watch on the dvds was wonderful and very funny.  We liked it so much, we have ordered the dvd from BBC America at a much higher price.  I talked to them about the disc quality, and they have assured me that we will get dvds that play. I hope they are right, as we really wanted to keep this.

UPDATE.  I received the dvd from BBC America today.  The 4th disc does not play.  They are supposed to be contacting the supplier to get me a disc that plays.  Fingers crossed.

I have just been told by BBC America that they cannot get me a disc that will play.  They are refunding my money.",1407283200,,1128,4.138888888888889
