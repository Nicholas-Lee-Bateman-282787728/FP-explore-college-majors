6464109,5,B00L3OUO8K,"This is a great collection of movies. I mostly ordered it for Gran Torino, which I had seen before a couple times and loved. I had also previously seen and enjoyed Invictus and Trouble With the Curve, so I figured this was a great deal in getting at least 3 good movies all in one low-priced package. The big surprise for me was how much I enjoyed J. Edgar. I didn't have much interest in seeing it, but I figured what the heck, since it was included in the collection. Since watching it yesterday, I can't quit thinking about how good a movie it was. I'll definitely be watching it, and all these other movies, several more times. Clint Eastwood is a wonderful actor and director, and these films showcase that perfectly. Overall this collection is a fantastic purchase!",1435708800,7,771,4.553956834532374

6464112,5,B00L3OUO8K,"Clint Eastwood has been one of my favorite actors since I was very young, and always tried not to miss out on any of his new releases in the past. These 4 Film Favorites are just as good as a few of his big-hits I've watched over the years. Acting Performance in these films are Superb as usual, and just what I expected. This is a great price for these dramatic, entertaining stories. Very enjoyable & highly recommended!",1422316800,8,422,4.423076923076923
