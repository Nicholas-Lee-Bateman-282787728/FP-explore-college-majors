7359979,4,B01329A190,"This is an adorable Bubble Guppies DVD that features four episodes, the main one being ""The Puppy and the Ring."" They are episodes that have previously aired on television but it is nice to have on one DVD for whenever your child wants a Bubble Guppies fix! Great lessons for kids and adorable animation.

The Bubble Guppies: The Puppy and the Ring includes the following episodes:

The Puppy and the Ring  Bubbledom is in danger when the evil Night Wizard takes the Ring from the benevolent Sun King.  Join Molly and Gil as they race to return the Ring of the Sun to its rightful owner by sundown. It could be night-night for everyone until the end of time!
Sir Nonny the Nice!  Nonny is on a quest to become a real knight.  He has a shield and suit of armor, but does he have what it takes to win a knightly game of mini-golf?
Bubble-Cadabra!  The Bubble Guppies discover magic when they stand in for a missing magician and attempt the worlds greatest trickmaking an elephant disappear.
The Wizard of Oz-tralia!   After Molly and Gil meet Bobby, a nature show host from Australia, they can't wait to learn all about Australian animals.  From marsupials to the amazing platypus, the Guppies can't get enough of the creatures Down Under.",1435276800,7,1237,4.607305936073059

7360006,5,B01329A190,"Very cute addition to our Bubble Guppy collection.  The Puppy and the Ring is a fantasy romp about Bubble Puppy getting the ring of the sun king stuck around his neck like a collar.  The night wizard wants to get the ring for his own so the sun can't ever rise again.  All the guppies play cute roles; Molly and Gil are lemon slushie vendors, Deema and Oona are fairy like flutter guppies, Goby is a snow guppie who can turn into a polar bear and Nonny is the under guppie, a guppie who lives in a cave with bats.  It has some Lord of the Rings qualities to it, which makes it all the more enjoyable for me. ^-^

The other episodes included are Sir Nonny the Nice, Bubble-Cadabra and The Wizard of Oz-Tralia.  They are all fantasy/magic themed episodes and like most Bubble Guppie episodes are cute.  This dvd was well worth the purchase price and will probably get its money's worth by being watched over and over again.",1451260800,2,921,4.350877192982456
