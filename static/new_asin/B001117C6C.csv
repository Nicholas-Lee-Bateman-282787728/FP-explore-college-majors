I found myself playing some of the lectures multiple times, wanting to savor the experience. Treat yourself and take your time listening to some fine teaching. I look forward to repeating the course in a couple of years.",1402099200,,377,4.4
8239760,5,B001117C6C,"Based on the premise that history and societies have largely been shaped by great individuals, great events, and great ideas, J. Rufus Fears has chosen a nice diverse collection of ""great books"" which have ""made history"" and can ""change your life,"" and he presents the storylines and key themes of these great books with the passion and rhetorical force we might expect from the authors themselves, as though he's a true believer. In my opinion, this is exactly the way it should be done, since otherwise the books lose their potential to make their intended impact.

Some reviewers have made the mistake of thinking that this means that Fears is unscholarly and just pushing his own opinions, but that's clearly not the case. Taken collectively, these books contradict each other on many major points, and Fears is far too astute to be unaware of that. For example, according to these books:

(1) There is no god, one god, or many gods. God(s) may be remote from the world, or immanent in everything, including nature and each one of us. Similarly, we may inherently be ""connected"" with god(s), we may be able to connect through our own efforts, or the connection may be entirely at the discretion of god(s). God(s) may have human attributes (and thus be able to judge and reward/punish us, warranting our fear), may be truth itself (which means that searching for truth is holy), or may be mysterious and entirely beyond our comprehension.

(2) God(s) may never intervene in the world; may subtly steer our actions via omens and other signs; may have a unique plan for each of us (which we may not understand), and which we can choose to follow or not (what happens if we don't?); or may fatalistically entirely determine the course of our lives (in which case free will is an illusion and there is no basis for judging and rewarding/punishing us).

(3) We may have no afterlife whatsoever (and no soul), a dull ""shadowy"" afterlife (which isn't terrible, but not desirable either), a single eternal afterlife (which may be good or bad), or multiple afterlives (which may not even be in human form). And if we have multiple afterlives, the goal may be to escape them all by achieving some sort of blissful union with ultimate reality/God (a goal which strikes me as both vague and superficial).

(4) Absolute objective moral standards exist (eg, with regard to justice and responsibility) and we must choose whether to follow them. Or both good and evil (and love) dwell within each of us as part of human nature, so the moral imperative and struggle is internal to us. Or it's impossible to simply ""be moral"" since real situations nearly always put moral values in conflict and require tradeoffs.

(5) We should apply the golden rule and strive for social harmony, with our role shaped by our society. Or we should maintain some distance from society and avoid conformity, so that we can foster inner development and be true to ourselves.

(6) High social status (glory, honor, power, etc.) can enhance our lives, as can material things and bodily pleasures. Or all of these are detrimental because they lead us astray from what really matters ... inner development? mental tranquility? blissful union with ultimate realty? something else?

(7) War to preserve a great society is sometimes necessary and just, indeed worth giving your life for. Or war is something a ruler should engage in as necessary to maintain his or her own power, regardless of the cost to the masses. Or war is always a reflection of immaturity and evil, so we should always follow the path of nonviolence.

So, with all of these contradictions, are there any general lessons which can be distilled from the great books? I think so, and Fears finds them:

(1) The purpose of studying the great books is to gain wisdom: pragmatic knowledge which can fundamentally improve our lives. This is a lifelong pursuit which requires struggle, suffering, humility, practical education (including life experience), and contemplation. Though we may never attain complete wisdom, its pursuit is still worthwhile.

(2) To deal with life's difficulties, we must be courageous and persistent (otherwise life can break us). We must also emphasize controlling our minds and thoughts and suppressing detrimental desires and emotions (eg, through meditation), especially when we have limited control of our circumstances. However, sadly, extreme physical pain can reach a level beyond what anyone can bear.

(3) As a guide to how to spend our time, we should emphasize doing what we do best (self-actualization), which may change over the course of our lives and may differ greatly from other people. However, rather than going to extremes, we should also practice moderation. The same applies at the social level, where checks and balances are needed to prevent going to cultural and political extremes.

(4) Perhaps the ultimate goal of all of this (wisdom, courage, persistence, self-control, self-actualization, and moderation) is freedom: at least freedom of conscience and freedom from fear and suffering, if not also freedom in our circumstances.

Does any of this amount to an epiphany? Are these lessons profound enough to change your life? You'll have to judge that for yourself, but I certainly found this course very worthwhile, even if it only served to help crystallize views I had already formed over the years. And I'm doubtful that I'll make time to read any of the books covered in this course any time soon, but that's not a bad thing -- it means that the course has met most of my need, and thus done its job well!",1302307200,3,5590,4.920382165605096
