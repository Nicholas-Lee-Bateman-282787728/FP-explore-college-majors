8393406,3,B003B3OTJ6,"Despite some beautiful scenes of ""la corrida"", this ""60 Minute"" special missed something almost intangible but nonetheless all important.  It missed the pageantry, music, drama and noise.  It missed the very experience of the corrida.  It was a bit like watching two or three football players making a few good plays and then interviewing them about their personal and family experiences with football playing.  You'd almost completely lose the sense of a complete and exciting football game.  Still some of the passes are excellent and give the viewer a good idea as to how truly dangerous an enraged fighting bull is.",1405555200,,619,5.089108910891089
8393407,4,B003B3OTJ6,"If you like bullfighting, you'll like this.  If you don't like bullfighting, don't bother.  A very interesting and accurate piece.",1386547200,,130,5.45
8393408,5,B003B3OTJ6,"Detailed account of bullfighting pair of brothers, as well as where they rank compared to others; fair & balanced reporting.",1382486400,,124,5.25
8393409,5,B003B3OTJ6,"I use this video in my advanced Spanish Civilizations and Culture class (high school level).  MANY of my students said it made them think about bullfighting in a completely different way.  I am not pro-bullfighting, but I wanted my students to understand both sides of the argument, really understand what happens in a bullfight, the history of it, etc.,  and be able to have a healthy debate about it afterwards.  This is a very well-done, fascinating look into the world of bullfighting from a completely different perspective.  You don't have to agree with it-- it's cultural and educational.",1315267200,14,595,5.030612244897959
8393410,5,B003B3OTJ6,Terrific video of 60 Minutes coverage of the bullfight.  Highly recommended for those who can appreciate the ballet in blood that is the corrida.,1275091200,7,145,5.041666666666667
8393411,1,B003B3OTJ6,"I was appalled when i watched this episode of 60 minutes. I was so disturbed by it, that it brought me to tears; had to turn the channel halfway through. I can NOT believe an American show, coming from a ""civilized"" country such as ours, would not only air this nauseating and antiquated ""sport"", but glorify it as well! I was embarrassed for the producer, narrator, and for CBS in general. I will be sure to continue spreading the word to PLEASE write in to CBS, telling them this was unacceptable, and to boycott their channel as much as possible.",1268611200,5,549,4.5
