8275380,3,B000UPQZZ4,"I think I may be the only person in the world who's seen this movie (at least intentionally). Parts of it are sweet and endearing, parts of it are downright stupid. It sets you on a rollercoaster of perception, trying to figure out whether to think of it as a film that tells a nice tale using corniness as a medium, and straight up kung fu porn.

The worst part of it is the movie ends on a cliffhanger, but no sequel was ever made*! It's never resolved! And the sword that the movie is named after, you think you're going to see it in action, or at least under glass, but after the first 5 minutes of the film, you never see it again. 1/3 of the movie centers around this guy Gold Lion being kept hidden for his own safety and ALL these people dying because of it but you never freaking see him again after the first 5 minutes of the film either. I won't go into further detail. You may enjoy it, as I sorta kinda sorta did. ... partly. But if you do intend on trying to follow the story, keep a pen and pad handy to write down all the relationships and politics and crap. Tip, get something at LEAST as big as a legal pad.

* UPDATE
I'm sorry, there actually WAS a sequel.

Also a funny note. When I was last in LA, I picked up a DVD for $5 in a car wash that said ""Jet Li in Lord Of The Wu Tang"". Take a guess what film it ACTUALLY was. The opening credits and Dune-esque backstory piece were removed. In it's place, some random pictures of space, the words ""LORD OF THE WU TANG"" and then we cut to the little kid asking his mommy for candy. .. and NO Jet Li is NOT somehow magically in this one.",1265241600,,2382,5.494535519125683
