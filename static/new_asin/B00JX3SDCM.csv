8654538,1,B00JX3SDCM,"This looks like a homemade video.  Its unbelievable that Amazon even has this for sale as a video.  The sound quality is terrible,  it sounds like it was recorded on a cassette player from the 80s.  The video looks like some homemade paper dolls is moving around on the screen.  I can't even believe that Amazon charged me for this!

Amazon!  Where is your quality control?",1451088000,,373,4.5606060606060606

8654540,5,B00JX3SDCM,I only saw the first episode and I love the series. It has been a long time since someone produced a family historical animated film.  It has a well beginning. I can't wait to see the next episode. The animation is excellent.,1399852800,2,225,4.357142857142857
