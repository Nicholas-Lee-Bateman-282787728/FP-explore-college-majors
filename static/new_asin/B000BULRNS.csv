8092895,2,B000BULRNS,"I only gave two stars as the quality of the tape didn't meet the suggested standard, and the expense just wasn't worth it when weighed against the less than mediocre quality.  This criticism is directed to the process and quality of the tape received, not the movie content.",1372723200,3,274,4.708333333333333

8092897,5,B000BULRNS,"Touching, funny, romantic and great music all rolled into one great film.  I first saw this I believe on HBO in the 80's, as what they used to call I believe a ""sleeper hit"". I fell in love with it instantly.  I recorded it on tape and it's the only VHS tape I still have.  I've been checking for the DVD on and off for years hoping for it to come out to no avail.  If you ever see it listed on TV or find it on a DVD or VHS rack, treat it like the rare gem that it is.  Liz P.",1352246400,4,477,3.592233009708738
8092898,5,B000BULRNS,"The movie ""Melanie"" is a great movie. The movie reminds of simpler times when you can really enjoying a great
story. A story that has heart and soul and even brings a tear to the eye as well as joy! All of the actors are
great. Don Johnson plays such a broken guy who comes home from the war at first and then a cruel soon to be ex-husband. And Paul Sorvino plays a lawyer who helps Glynnis O'Connor fight for son.

8092899,5,B000BULRNS,"My mom and I love this movie...we first saw it in the 80's on cable I am sure.  I have searched for it for years, have been out bid on ebay.  But finally found and purchased it on Amazon.  We still love watching it now just like we did then.  The soundtrack is awesome.  Burton Cummings or (Rick) as we call him is fantastic both in the movie and on the soundtrack.  The tape is not the best but good enough considering the age of the video.  While I could find no actual soundtrack to purchase along with the movie..I did buy 2 Burton Cummings CD's so my mom and I would each have one to listen to..they have the songs from the movie on them.",1261958400,11,643,4.055555555555555
