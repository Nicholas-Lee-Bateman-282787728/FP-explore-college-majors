3902611,2,B002C18RPA,"Yah, not all film noir is created equal. And not all crime noir either. This one is kind of ho-hum ( I am being kind) about a late 19th century English composer who has this odd-ball habit of doing murderous things when he hears strange sounds in his head and steps away from being a skillful composer to turn into British pyscho (including some bizarre cinematic tricks to show this transformation , really bizarre). Of course, the old story is he can't remember (until it is too late) that he off-handedly put to flames a few victims after murdering them. Including one gold-digging songstress who played him the fool just once too often, and maybe we will cry few tears over. Naturally she had to go up in flames, since this film is supposed to take place in 19th century London, on Guy Fawkes Day, leaving all those Americans not familiar with the Gunpowder Plot, with early Stuart kingship history, and with no clue why that day is important to put a two-timing (maybe three) wench to the bonfire a little befuddled. Naturally those who live by the flame must die by the flame and so our composer (and perhaps this film) suffer that fate.",1351987200,,1143,4.580487804878048
3902612,5,B002C18RPA,"I'm going to dedicate this review to my Ammy buddy MKIA (Mr. Know it All) since I thought of him the whole time I was watching this.  This is totally up your ally buddy and you really should check this one out.  As far as the whole B-Grade (I say B-Grade, but it's more about the feel not the quality) horror movies go, this one is pretty top notch!

I'm reminded of a stunning foreign film entitled `The Human Beast' while watching `Hangover Square'.  There is an element of brutish mystery that links the two, although I feel compelled to point out that `The Human Beast' is a far better film overall.  What `Hangover Square' has that a lot of these older monster/horror films lack is an emotional core.  This is thanks to the fact that the main character (our killer, composer George Harvey Bone) is fleshed out beautifully as a man, a real man, with real emotions and problems and worries and a life not unlike many others.

He is relatable.

`Hangover Square' tells the story of a composer named George who suffers from blackouts where he commits horrendous acts (which include murder) only to wake up with no knowledge whatsoever.  Well, he has a vague idea.  Call it a hunch.  The real story is George's personal life, which winds up being pulled in two directions by two very different women; one of which has deep care for George, the other who only wants to use him.

The murderous blackouts are brought on by stress, and this man is truly stressed.

The film, at times, can be a tad dry, but overall it has a colossal impact, especially the ending.  The performance given by Laird Cregar is magnificent to put it bluntly.  He really sinks into the despair this man feels, the pain in the pit of his stomach as he seeks someone to truly appreciate and love him.  As he battles his own understanding of himself and his self worth you can see these layers of misery surrounding his face.

It's called stress.

With some truly chilling scenes and a spectacular finish (emotion!), `Hangover Square' was a triumph as far as I'm concerned.",1273708800,10,2043,4.550684931506849

8362732,5,B002C18RPA,"Bizarre, brooding and diabolical with a real cliffhanger of an ending; Laird Cregar, in his last role before his untimely death, plays a psychopath killer suffering from crippling bouts of amnesia. Poor Linda Darnell will not have a good time of it. But you will love this disc. Newly restored, Hangover Square has never looked this good on home video. A great movie and a solid Blu-ray. Wow and thank you!",1512864000,2,406,4.732394366197183
8362733,4,B002C18RPA,"Hangover Square is a thriller set in London at the turn of the 20th century. Laird Cregar (The Lodger) stars as George Harvey Bone, a classical music composer who suffers from blackouts. When he learns that a murder was committed during one of his blackouts, he starts to worry that he himself may be the murderer. Though a Scotland Yard report proves his innocence, Bones murderous streak reveals itself when a pub singer (Linda Darnell) with ulterior motives betrays him. Directed by John Brahm, the film co-stars George Sanders.

Made a year after The Lodger with the same star and director, Hangover Square was an attempt by the studio to duplicate the success of the earlier film. Once again, production design and costumes reflect the period, and Cregar is at his best as a tender soul driven to dastardly deeds during his blackouts. Thinner than he was in The Lodger, Cregar trimmed down and was hoping Hangover Square would show his acting range and make him eligible for leading man roles, which never came to pass (Cregar died two months before the release of Hangover Square). His penetrating eyes and intensity give his Bone a terrifying appearance when in murderous mode.

Though not as effective as The Lodger, Hangover Square is an intriguing companion film, sharing a great build-up of suspense, a fascinating central character, and featuring a series of murders. At only 77 minutes, it is a consistently riveting gothic mystery.

Bonus materials on the unrated Blu-ray release include audio commentary by screenwriter and film historian Steve Hoberman and actor Faye Marlowe; audio commentary by author and film historian Richard Schickel; the featurette The Tragic Mask: The Laird Cregar Story; trailer gallery; and a Hangover Square radio show performed by Vincent Price, Linda Darnell ad Faye Marlowe.",1511308800,5,1821,5.104026845637584

Determined to escape type-casting as a ""heavy"" in films,
Laird Cregar launched a crash diet in August 1944 when filming of ""Hangover Square"" began
By the end of filming three months later, he had lost 100 pounds.
Three weeks later he was dead of a heart attack at age thirty-one (December 9, 1944).
""Hangover Square"" opened on February 7, 1945. It was Cregar's biggest hit (and the only time he was top-billed).

The picture on this Blu-Ray is a great improvement over the old Twentieth Century Fox DVD.
No new bonus features, but all the old DVD bonus features from 2007 are carried over:
--- Two Audio Commentaries
--- English SDH subtitles
--- Laird Cregar mini-documentary (20 minutes)
--- Trailers for other Laird Cregar films.
--- ""Frigidaire Presents Hollywood Startime"": 1946 radio show starring Linda Darnell with Vincent Price in the Laird Cregar role (30 minutes)
So the improved picture is the only reason to upgrade to Blu-Ray, but I find it reason enough.

""Hangover Square"" was very close to being a remake of Laird Cregar's previous film ""The Lodger"" (1944).
Same villain (Laird Cregar), same hero (George Sanders), same director (John Brahm), same writer (Barr Lyndon).
Only the leading lady was different (Merle Oberon in ""The Lodger"", Linda Darnell in ""Hangover Square"").
Twentieth Century Fox even reused the set - in ""The Lodger"" it was Victorian London; in ""Hangover Square"" it was turn of the century Edwardian London.
""Hangover Square"" has the advantages of a larger budget and a great Bernard Hermann score.
Trivia:
Contrary to what a street sign in the film reads, there is no ""Hangover Square"" in London .
The closest match is ""Hanover Square"".

Director John Brahm's ""horror trilogy"" for Twentieth Century Fox was issued in a 3 DVD set back in 2007.
Now Kino Lorber has reissued each film on Blu-Ray:

1945: Hangover Square [Blu-ray]
""The Undying Monster"" (not starring Laird Cregar) is the only true horror film of the three.
""The Lodger"" and ""Hangover Square"" are thrillers, or maybe even lurid melodramas.
Nothing supernatural, but Laird Cregar could be a really scary lunatic.

8362736,5,B002C18RPA,"In only a half decade in films,  Laird Cregar had made his mark as one of the most effective character actors on screen. Shortly before his death in 1944,  he appeared at the 20th Century Fox New York City showcase theater, The Roxy, as part of the stage show (movie and vaudeville was still the bill  at all showcase outlets). I remember clearly seeing him there, although all I can precisely recall of the appearance was his doing a cartwheel, a quite unexpected feat from a man whose weight often approached the 300 pound level. As one can see in this film, his last, he is quite a bit thinner than in his preceding vehicles, such as the hit, 'The Lodger' or the very effective,' I Wake Up Screening'. He is said to have lost 100 pounds prior to its making. It was released a few months after his death of a heart attack at age 31.
It is a quiet, mostly underplayed movie, with one bravura sequence, marked by Cregar's excellent performance and the superior supporting work of George Sanders and Linda Darnell. The star is a symphonic composer plagued by blackouts in which he does things he does not remember (as we learn in the very first sequence of the film). He is loved by the Good Woman but himself falls into love with the Bad Woman (Darnell) who wants only to exploit his talents by having him write popular songs for her.  Sanders is a Scotland Yard detective to whom he goes because of his fear that he may be doing unfortunate things during the blackout.
It is not sensational nor a source of intense suspense. Yet the quality of the filming, absence of wasted time, superiority of playing by the lead and key character roles, makes it well worth seeing these 60 years after filming.",1415404800,10,1698,4.485436893203883

8362738,3,B002C18RPA,"""Hangover Square"" will seem very familiar for viewers of the 1944 horror thriller, ""The Lodger."" After director John Brahm and star Laird Cregar created one of the best ever versions of the Jack the Ripper story, they tried essentially to duplicate their earlier movie. The second time around, however, the results were decidedly mixed.

""Hangover Square"" was Cregar's first and last starring role before his tragic death shortly after filming completed. Cregar plays Geoge Bone, a composer in turn of the century England who blacks out when he hears discordant noises and winds up becoming a killer. Bone is unaware of what he has done, but events in his life lead him to commit murder again. The cause of his downfall is a beautiful lounge singer, Netta (Linda Darnell), who flirts with Bone so he will write songs for her.

The story line of ""Hangover Square"" isn't nearly as compelling as ""The Lodger,"" in large part because it's not about history's most infamous serial killer, but about a meek fictional composer who eventually snaps. There's even less of a mystery here than in ""The Lodger"" as well, since the police, in the person of consulting therapist George Sanders (who was a cop in ""The Lodger"" as well) catch on to Bone and the audience knows he's guilty from the first minute of the film.

Despite the rather flimsy plot, Cregar and Brahm are at the top of their game. Cregar is more restrained and less obviously creepy than he was in ""The Lodger,"" and he manages to make Bone more of a sad figure. Brahm is able to put together some stunning black & white camera sequences, most notably a scene in which Bone disposes of a victim by wrapping up the corpse and throwing it on a Guy Fawkes Night bonfire. Finally, the film boasts a haunting, powerful score by Bernard Herrmann, who composed an entire concerto for Bone to play at the film's climax. ""Hangover Square"" is worthwhile viewing for the sight and sound of it and for Cregar's performance, despite the story weakness.

The DVD boasts some solid extras, notably a featurette on Laird Cregar and two audio commentaries by film historians. One of the commentaries also features Faye Marlowe, a co-star in the movie, who was only 17 when the picture was made. Finally, there is a recording of a radio broadcast of ""Hangover Square"" with Vincent Price in Cregar's role and Linda Darnell.",1391990400,2,2357,4.769607843137255
