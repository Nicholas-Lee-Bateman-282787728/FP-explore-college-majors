The life on the island, the local tongue, and scenery all lead one to want more.  It seems some actors play themselves.  The beginning discussions with some older gentlemen, for an attuned ear, gives evidence that these men were not acting.  The norwegian accent is still fresh even though the film is from the 1980's.
The Weborg name is a common name in this area and I would assume that the main character once lived this experience.  I would like to know how much of this is true.
The acting is very obviously not high quality, but anyone familiar with this area of the country would probably find the strange pull to keep watching.  I would call this style of movie ""folk theatre"".",1364256000,,834,4.639455782312925
