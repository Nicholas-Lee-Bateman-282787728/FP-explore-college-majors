Dark Wolf and Perfect Creature were both really lousy movies and should have never been stuck in with The Howling.  I resent the dumping of crap into a three movie sale just to get rid of them.  If you purchase this three pack to get The Howling, plan on throwing the other two away, I did!",1455926400,,485,4.25
