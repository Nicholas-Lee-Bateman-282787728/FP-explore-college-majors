4831183,1,B005LZW944,cant beleive i waited this long for a movie that did not even last for 25 minutes. loved the first movie and now this comes out and my kids begged and pleaded for it and we even wanted to watch it but then it came and it was over before we even understood what happened. allot of money for this short short short movie so i have to say the kids are crying and we will not be investing in this movie animation anymore. very disappointed here.,1321574400,5,441,4.080459770114943

Plus the later wasn't really a story. Very disappointed. Wanted to watch another movie with Toothless, Hiccup and the rest of the Vikings.",1321401600,6,308,4.517857142857143
4831185,5,B005LZW944,"**WARNING: THIS IS SPOILER ~*~HEAVEN~*~!!!**

And it comes from a die-hard fan <3 who had SO much hopes pinned on this short <3 I'm also a writer, keep in mind!! :) and an artist [...]

so, after about a month or maybe a month and a half of drooling... and waiting (impatiently) it finally arrived.

And, thankfully the kids I babysit are into HtTYD, actually I owe it to them for being so HTTYD obsessed <3

Anyhoo, yeah, I saw it four times!! Lol!

Book of Dragons is good. Not what I expected but as a writer, VERY inspiring since I can get ideas for dragons for it from the future <3 *evil grin*

But... Gift of the Night Fury... oh! I don't really do romance stories. Oh sure I've watched the Jane Austen stories and really like the 2005 version of Pride and Prejudice, but normal romance... :puke: so I'm not used to watching a movie and having my heart... *flutter* from giddiness. And yes, i was so excited and happy and dreamy after watching Gift of the Night Fury that my heart *was* all fluttery :iconloveloveplz:

First of all, if I had fears that HTTYD2 could *possibly* be messed up, I have NO fears now. There is no way they'll ever mess it up. Let me explain:

:ahem: normally, shorts (Pixar or Dreamworks) are reserved for 'having fun' you do things in shorts that you don't do in the movie. It's area that's available for 'goofing off';'hot-rodding' and being 'corny'.

Yup. I am a Die-Hard-Hiccup-Fan and I did except some corniness from this short, but as a HTTYD Die Hard, I was eager to embrace it. I anticipated it with the rest of you, had my hopes up for it, and was fully prepared to take in the cornieness.

After all, Megamind's short 'The Button of Doom' was exactly that. OH yes, very fun, but exactly that. The Halloween shorts for Shrek and Monsters VS Aliens was like that. I've not seen either Shrek or Monsters VS Alines, but I over-heard the Halloween shorts when I was babysitting (hey, I see all these/hear kids movies while I'm working around the house) And those Halloween shorts were very much the norm. If you've seen Legend of the Bone Knapper, you know what I mean. Oh yes, it's a fantastic short, but definately doesn't have the magic of the movie. But it's HYSTERICAL

So, hey, I expected the norm for the HTTYD and was still giddy when I got to work and got to put it in to watch with Hawk and Wren :happybounce:

:omg: it actually had it's own emotional little mini-story. It counts as a real story... not just 'fluff'. Oh yes... it was... every bit as legit as the movie. It had magic!

Let me ~*~tell~*~ you all about it.

It's now winter at Berk... winter so cold it will frostbite your spleen and the Vikings are preparing to celebrate Snoggletog!! Oh yes! that magical season... ;) And of course, the village had even more to celebrate. The war is over... they have PETS!! Dragons!

And of course, what's HTTYD without Hiccup and Toothless begining every morning with Hiccup and Toothless going out for a little spin?

In the middle of their morning exercise, the Vikings back at home, preparing for Snoggletog, are disturbed and saddened when their dragons suddenly up and leave. And this flock of dragons intercept Hiccup and Toothless (knocking Hiccup's helmet off into the sea). Hiccup and Toothless head back home where he's surrounded by hysterical, upset, and sad Vikings-- all fraintic because their dragons are gone. Very hysterical 'what if the NEVER come back?!' :laughing: a few short months ago you would have been cheering *that* idea!

And Hiccup doesn't know what's happening. Only Toothless is remaining behind. As Tuffnut complains: 'your dragon can't go anywhere without you.' Meanwhile, Fishlegs is unusually happy. And Astrid, to bury their sadness is out to start new traditions, beginning (the next morning) with Yacknog... and yes, it really is THAT gross. Poor Snotlout :laughing:

Astrid, convinced Hiccup will like it, seeks him out at the forge, and gives him a cup of it while he explains why he was there all night: troubled by what Tuffnut said of Toothless' lack of freedom, he made a tail that can work so that Toothless can fly without Hiccup. Toothless will have more freedom to come and go as he pleases.

Next morning, Hiccup puts the new tailfin on the 'weirded out' Toothless-- it was hysterical cuz it reminded me so much of my cat Hermione (tears-- she's still sick :tears: so that also made it sad...) But when Toothless discovers that it let's him fly, he gets this frenzied, wild, scary look in his eye, turns round on Hiccup and then bolts to the sky right away.

Three days later finds Hiccup still without his dragon and his helmet. And Stoick wants him to find his lost helmet... but not without some encouragement. Oh yes, even Stoick has grown as a character. He now notices when Hiccup is troubled and calls him back and asks what is bothering him. He's grown. He cares... :thumbsup:

So while Hiccup is setting out (with a pair of oars on his shoulder) heading for a dingy to go find his helmet, he runs into Fishlegs who has an armload of fish in a basket... Fish looks guilty and Hiccup follows him ;)

Turns out, Fishlegs' dragon was locked up in a barn. Hiccup opens the door, Meatlug (the dragon) breaks loose and flies off with the bewildered Hiccup hanging on for dear life. Meanwhile, heartbroken Fish is calling out: 'WHAT ABOUT PRESENTS?!'

The other teens enter the barn, having seen the Gronckle and Hicucp leave...

Fishlegs: I just don't understand him!
Astrid: You don't understand HIM? You KIDNAPPED YOUR DRAGON! He flew away the instant he was loose!
Fishlegs: that makes it sound mean...
Ruffnut and Tuffnut *exploring hay*: hey guys--
Fishlegs: I'm actually 72% sure he wanted to stay
Tuffnut: YOU GUYS!
others: what?!
*they see what the twins found in the hay*
Fishlegs: barfed up stones/rocks/boulders!
Ruffnut: those aren't barfed up stones you idiot! Those are eggs!

OH yes... Meatlug is a girl... Poor Fishlegs :laughing:

And that's what Hiccup discovered, the Dragons all left to their nesting grounds. And Hiccup hasn't found any sign of Toothless, even though he has found every one else's dragons.

He brings back the adults and the *ahem* adoreable babies (oh they melt your heart :))

SO of course, Hiccup has saved the day again. Snogletog can be celebrated with dragons now... and BABY dragons to boot. Cuteness galore. WHY the DICKENS isn't there baby dragons around here?!

So, in the Hall, with everyone celebrating, we find Hiccup watching the others with their dragons and their baby dragons... and oh you feel so sorry for him. Toothless... gone!! :tears:

And the poor kid *DOES* tear up!! :icondragonweep: But Astrid is AMAZING-- she comes to Hiccup: 'Hiccup, I know it must be hard, seeing everyone with their dragons and you don't have yours. You did a wonderful thing, Hiccup, bringing everyone's dragons back.' She kisses him on the lips and then hugs him.

Hiccup is a very *SLIGHTLY* surprised at the hug, smiles because she's hugging him, and then sadness takes over. He hugs her tighter and whispers: 'Astrid, where did Toothless go?'
Astrid: 'I don't know...'

Oh yes... interuption! Door ajar! She looks up! And you know the rest. Toothless sticks in his devious looking face-- and Astrid, still hugging Hiccup pulls an even more devious look. She pulls back and says: 'oh wow! Sure glad I'm not you right now, Hiccup. You managed to bring back EVERYONE'S dragon except your own!'

Hiccup is rather irritated by the unfeeling statement, and while he's mumbling about it, Astrid grabs him, twists him around and shoves him forward. Toothless rushes forward and Hiccup runs up and HUGS him!! Oh gosh... was I in heaven. I melted! :iconloveloveplz: 'HE HUGGED HIM! THIS IS SO CUTE!! HE HUGGED HIM! HE HUGGED A DRAGON!! AAAHHHH!'

Hiccup pulls away: 'you bad BAD dragon! Don't you ever do that again! You scared me to death-- and... what is that in your mouth?'

:iconloveloveplz: and Toothless dumps a very very soggy wet helmet on Hiccup's head :iconblushplz:

Hiccup: 'oh, thanks... you found my helme-- YOU FOUND MY HELMET! THAT'S WHERE YOU WERE!' He smiles at Toothless, takes his face and says very sweetly and sincerely: 'Toothless, you're wonderful.'

And he hugs him again!! :iconloveloveplz: oooooooh!!

So, then there's the next morning, cuz it ain't over YET!! Hiccup gets up to ride Toothless, and there is Toothless... waiting, with saddle... and old tailfin. Fjord, I SO thought of you and your fanfic. You were SO right.

Toothless doesn't want his new tail and 'freedom'. He wants his mutual dependence/friendship/co-workmanship with Hiccup back. Hiccup was willing enough to ride Toothless with the new tailfin on, but, seeing that Hiccup doesn't get his subtle gestures about the saddle and Red Death Tailfin (I theorize it's red w/the white scull on it because Hiccup defeated (with Toothless) the Red Death... together) Toothless, looks at Hiccup, lifts up his tail and defiantly and deliberately destroys and flings the new tailfin off and away. Then he nudges the old saddle and tailfin again :heart: too precious. Too PRECIOUS for my HTTYD-LOVING-HEART!! :iconloveloveplz:

And it ends with a very beautiful touching scene. From the trailer, i thought it was a hot-rod scene. Nope. Will you believe it, it's sooo sentimental?

Hiccup: (narrates) Winter on Berk holds on with two hands, and doesn't let go. Our only guard against the cold are the ones we hold dear in our hearts/near our hearts (variation of that)...

Hiccup detaches the 'seat belt' that holds him to the saddle, disengages his prostetic foot from the stirrup and let's himself fall down head long paralell with Toothless in a smooth dive. Hiccup grins at Toothless, and Toothless smiles back and nudges Hiccup so that he spins around (slowly/gently-- it's a graceful lovely awesome movement) Hiccup sort of laughs in contented delight and then closes his eyes, smiling happily. That sweet friendship moment lasts a bit longer, then as Hiccup takes a hold of Toothless and places himself on the saddle once more as he begins narrorating:

'that winter I gave Toothless a pretty good gift' (Hiccup/Toothless pull up and Toothless' tail swipes the snow-clad trees bluring the screen in white) 'but he gave me an even better one'

Doesn't that just PROVE that HTTYD2 is going to be... AWESOME?! :) :iconloveloveplz: oh my!!

Animation was excelent!
There were some slightly new alterations of the soundtrack (heaven for me) not a lot, but it was heaven.
All in all... it was just... fantastic. I was surprised, delighted and... oooh! :D

Here's a clip of a soundtrack bit for Book of Dragons [...]

here's the *FIRST* flight in the movie clip Dreamworks itself put up on Youtube [...]

P.S. I also thought that Hiccup in his helmet and his flying gear was a nice touch. He has the best of both worlds-- he can respect and honour his father and still be best buds with Toothless-- to a point where Toothless 'rescues' the helmet for Hiccup. It was a great gesture. One that I'm sure that Dreamworks *VERY* much intended!! :happybounce:",1321315200,7,11075,4.785939139559287
4831186,1,B005LZW944,These movies are barely 20 minutes long. It should be listed in the description that this is just a short. Very disappointed in it and would not have bought it if I knew it was this short!,1321315200,14,188,4.108108108108108
4831187,4,B005LZW944,"I received this today and watched it just now. Watching both presentations, then the extras, I have came to my conclussion on this product.

Dragons: Gift of the Night Fury Review:

I'm not going to give away the story, only what I liked and what I didn't. First, I'm a huge fan of the movie, I actually enjoyed Legend of the Boneknapper Dragon (contrary to other reviews on here), and I think it's the most original family flick to come out in years. So when I heard that they were releasing two new features, I was excited, but can I say that now?

The Good:

The first movie I watched was Gift of the Night Fury and in the previews they made it look like that Dreamworks really pinched the penny on the animation, but looks are deceiving, and in all reality it actually wasn't bad. The story, though short, was enjoyable and had a lot of good comedy parts as well as some good action. I like it how they gave Fishlegs a bigger role than in the movie. Oh and yeah, I do got to admit, the baby dragons were cute...there I said it.

The Bad:

(Updated 11.17.11):

Too short! I know they have a budget though, but come on guys, two movies (one 22 minutes/one 18 minutes...correct me if I'm wrong), but it just feels a bit too short.

I rewatched it again and now I really don't mind Toothless appearance. I thought he looked weird, but after I watched it again, they were only a few parts where I thought he looked kind of odd, but I take back what I said. If anything, I didn't like how they had a lot less of Toothless, but it makes sense considering the ending.

Astrid was another problem. She didn't have the girl power like she did in the movie and seemed more like a very watered down version. She didn't have the attitude and seemed to me she was brainwashed by Disney. Yeah, she just acted way too happy for my taste. *Update* After watching this a few more times, meh, it's actually kind of cute in a way, but I still miss the girl power Astrid.

Final Rating: 4/5 Stars - I actually found myself laughing a lot more watching it the second time. There were some problems, but it's worth a rewatch.

-----

Book of Dragons:

The Good: It was basically profiling all the dragons that live among the people of Bourke which made it seem fun. The dragon ideas were creative and hopefully some of them will make an appearance in the sequel coming out in 2014.

The Bad: Although some parts were amusing in humor, they weren't laugh out loud funny. I really can't say more about it, because it was more of a movie profiling all the dragons that are known in Bourke and nothing else really.

3/5 Stars: It did what it was meant to do and that is tell you the different species of dragons. Nothing too special.

------

Extras:

This is probably the main reason why I gave it one less star was because I was dissapointed with the extras. They were okay: they had deleted scenes for Gift of the Night Fury, they had Gobber's Dragon Training, but other than that the rest wasn't really worth it, I guess. I'll be honest, I haven't checked them all out yet, but the rest seem more generated towards kids, and that's fine. But I think something on the sequel would be cool, maybe an interview with one of the directors or what have you talking about the upcoming sequel. An interview with the actors would've been great as well.

Dreamworks could of done better, but it wasn't all that bad I suppose. I'm going to rewatch it tonight and see if I can see something I didn't before, but for right now that's the first review out there on this.",1321315200,61,3537,4.331818181818182

Book of Dragons:
This one was released first, so I'll review it first. I'll start off by saying that it was exactly what I expected. They went more into detail on the dragons, explained which breeds were in which class, and showed how to train some of them. I was, however, disappointed with all of the clips from the movie and ""Legend of the Boneknapper Dragon"" though.

Gift of the Night Fury:
If you didn't think ""Book of Dragons"" was worth half the price, I sure hope you think this one was worth full price, because I do, and then some. This movie was just as good as the actual movie. Please buy this. Dreamworks deserves the money after the effort you can tell they put into it. If you have not seen it, skip to the next paragraphy right now; I am about to ask a question that involves spoilers. Is Toothless the only male dragon on Berk?

He checked out this movie and we renewed it until we had to return it to go back home in Virginia. He loved this movie so much, he watched it over and over again. He would excitedly call me in the room to show me things about each dragon. He memorized every dragon, what they could do, what they eat, and who road them. I immediately started searching for the movie to buy it for him for Easter 2012. The Easter Bunny brought him this gift pack. He has watched both of them over and over again. He also plays the video game online and received the PS3 game for Christmas. (the PS3 game is older and not as good as the one online). We now watch the TV series. My son waits anxiously every week to see if there will be a new episode. He loves this series and we enjoy watching it with him. It is so good to find something I can let him watch without worry!

4831237,5,B005LZW944,"Gift of the Night Fury, which picks up where 2010's How to Train Your Dragon left off, is excellent, in every way: animation, acting and story. The only thing wrong with the DreamWorks Dragons holiday special is that it was over too soon. I wanted more, more, more. Lucky for me a sequel to How to Train Your Dragon is set to release in 2014. In the meantime, Gift of the Night Fury gives you loads of entertainment for an inexpensive price, especially after your kids play it over and over, like mine do.

The only part of the story that rubbed me the wrong way was having Astrid become a party hostess. Throughout the movie How to Train Your Dragon her character is continually represented as the anti-girl, tough and manlike. Here she becomes the Disney princess of the dragon trainers. The running gags of the Yak Nog and the exploding eggs are funny, and give this main character more to do in a jam-packed story than other characters, but I would have liked to have seen something more in line with her rough-around-the-edges character.

That tiny criticism aside, Gift of the Night Fury went beyond my expectation for a franchise segment that's straight-to-DVD. The story is heartfelt, so much so that I always tear up at the end, just as the bagpipes swell to song.",1359590400,,1273,4.60352422907489

""Gift Of The Night Fury/Book Of Dragons""
(Dreamworks, 2012)
-------------------------------------------------------------
This 2-disc set contains two brief sequels to the Dreamworks animated film ""How To Train Your Dragon"" (one of the best kids films of the 21st Century!)

Disc One has sort of a Christmas story, using the same graphic style as the original film, with good voice work and decent animation - nothing as spectacular as the first movie, but enough to whet the appetite of fans who are eager to see more of these wonderful characters. The second disc has another short adventure done in a 2-D cartoon style, and introduces us to several new dragon species. Both films are pretty short (not sure why they didn't just put these on one disc, instead of padding it out to two...) and you'll definitely wish they were longer... Still, seeing Toothless & Company, however briefly, will be a thrill, and should keep you happy until Dragon 2 comes out. Not a great bargain, but still pretty fun.

But I think the story was very complete and thoroughly enjoyable, especially Astrid's reaction when she finds out that the ... well, I'll let you see that for yourself.  I also think Astrid stayed in her strong character.  There's just a little more romance blooming between her and Hiccup, which we knew would happen, right?  I wasn't too interested in the training secrets.  Seemed a bit redundant from How to Train Your Dragon.  But I did enjoy the Book of Dragons.

4831274,5,B005LZW944,"The quality of the shorts: 5 stars
The price: 3 stars
Overall: 5 stars (I'll explain where the extra star come from)

A general complaint is that the features are too short. I may be wrong but I think the complaints come from the price-length ratio. My personal opinion, if this set were $3-5 dollars cheaper or if it has a few more features and a few less ads, I think we would have seen less complaints and a better rating.

Back to the contents, I think Book of Dragons and other extras are some nice gadgets that add to the original movie but Gift of the Night Fury is the real nice feature in this set. Gift of the Night Fury is around 20 mins long (not counting the end credits), so comparing to the more common 5 mins shorts, it is still a rather long short. The short is well made, the graphics are as good as the original movie and the story is interesting. I watched the short for two times and was not bored at all. I am glad that they included the animators' corner, which I could see that they really made effort to make the short good.

OK, here is why I give an extra star. Originally, I was going to give a 4-star but I then realized that Gift of the Night Fury may have given some implications about How to Train Your Dragon 2. At the end of the original movie, we had a 2-minute glimpse of how Berk was like after all the changes took place. In this short, we have a more complete view of the life on Berk ""now"" and how the characters are interacting. I see it as a even further development from the Legend of the BoneKnapper Dragon. Of course, it contains no hint for the storyline of the next movie. Nevertheless, it shows what probably will be the world or setting for the next movie. Can the next movie has the same general theme as the first? Yes, but it seems it will be way more exciting to have the themes different for every sequel (Toy Story type of approach)...OK, I am off topic.

Overall, I would say it is a 5-star for those who really like How to Train Your Dragon and really care about the second movie. Even though it is slightly pricy but so far I like what I got.",1327190400,4,2100,4.152334152334152

Shipping went off without a hitch. And she and I watched it a couple weeks later when we were both home over Christmas break. It was adorable. Even though we have both seen the original movie multiple times (her ~5, me ~10), it was great to see another story in the world. It was a bit predictable at times and I felt Astrid was a little out of character, but otherwise I loved it, even though it was only 20-30 minutes long. The ending even brought a tear to my eye.

4831282,3,B005LZW944,"Gifts of the Night Fury was a cute holiday short. It was only about 22 minutes, but was worth a watch, although a bit overpriced. The story centers around the vikings celebrating a christmas-like holiday and the dragons mysteriously leaving. Discovering the whereabouts of the dragons and celebrating the holiday together was the focus. This was a cute, light-hearted story, although Toothless' rejection of his 'freedom' at the end of the story needed to be explained a bit more, since to me, accepting it, but still remaining friends made more sense.

The second DVD short was the 'book of dragon's and my family disliked this. It was basically about the dragons in the world of Toothless, the various types and contains some cheesy drawings and animation. We were bored and didn't like it.  In hindsight, I think I would've been happier if I had just bought Gifts of the Night Fury alone. The book of dragons felt like filler.

4831292,5,B005LZW944,"I just received this as a gift last week and have already watched it twice.
If you liked How To Train Your Dragon, then this is not to be missed. It is funny and touching and beautifully animated.
Seeing this on BluRay on a big screen was really incredible and really shows off how much talent and craft went into making this.
It feels like the same quality as the main movie, the only difference being it is about 22 minutes long... But that's why they call 'em shorts huh?

The story is really cool and does a nice job of expanding on some of the characters and showing how things have changed in Berk since the humans and Dragons got together.
And it kinda tugs at your emotions seeing how Hiccup and Toothless rely on each other.
I haven't watched the Book Of Dragons bit yet, so I can't comment on that, but I'm guessing it is awesome cool too. So see, I did comment on it, but really I am guessing.

Anyhow, this is a great piece for fans of the original. Oh and if you haven't seen the original, do it now! It was such an original and wonderful movie and I think not enough people know about it.",1323993600,,1102,4.193396226415095

4831298,5,B005LZW944,"I remember when I was dragged to the theater with my family to see How to Train Your Dragon. My sister and dad (20 and 45 respectively) took me (21) and I was anything but happy about it. The film looked god awful but much to my pleasant surprise it blindsided me, the original was amazing, one of the best animated films I've ever seen. After Legend of the Boneknapper I had very little hope for the sequel to Dreamworks animation's best animated film of their career, How to Train Your Dragon. I expected as much from this short but I thought I would check it out anyways just to see how far they dived down into the failure. Turns out, just as the original did, this short surprised me! It was excellent! If they keep this short's level of quality for each tv series episode it will be worth it to keep up with that as well!! 5/5, here is to renewed hope for the movie that should have won best animated film of the year!",1323302400,,924,4.2259887005649714

She plays the online game all the time and she loves it when she gets a new dragon.  This is a must buy for some one who has a dragon fan in their family.",1323302400,,442,3.932584269662921

And book of dragons has no new CGI-type animation, just some clips from the original, mostly much lower quality animation.  But they are enjoyable, entertaining, and harmless.  Gift of the night fury has no scary parts, so my nieces who liked parts of the original movie but were scared of red death really like it too.  If your kids aren't already HTTYD fans, there's a good chance they will like it but they may not want to watch it more than once unless the ""book of dragons"" gets them interested in the dragons.",1323216000,,616,4.415929203539823
4831301,5,B005LZW944,"As a huge fan of the ""How To Train Your Dragon"" movie, I was definitely looking forward to these two new shorts since I first heard about them earlier this year.  Despite the length (I don't know what other people were expecting, I actually had heard these were ""shorts,"" and was only expecting a half-hour episode like ""Legend of the Boneknapper), I thought ""Gift of the Night Fury"" was a fun and heartwarming new little tale from Dreamworks.

The Winter Holiday ""Snoggletog"" is upon the residents of Berk, and with the conflict between Dragons and Vikings long over, they begin making preparations to enjoy the holidays together.  What the Vikings don't expect is for their village dragons to take off in a migration with their wild relatives and leave them all behind.  Hiccup, worried about Toothless being unable to come and go like the other dragons can, fashions his friend a new tail that will allow him to fly on his own, but when Toothless also takes off, the holiday begins to look a lot bleaker for Berk...

WHAT I LIKED:

As a story, there were some sweet moments and wonderful character interactions in ""Gift of the Night Fury"" that I feel do a nice job of building from the movie.  With a heavy focus on the strong bond between Hiccup and Toothless, it's a story that, at its core, is about friendship and the kindness it brings, especially around the holidays.  Even characters like Astrid and Stoick, who had harsher sides to their personalities throughout the original movie, seem bitten by holiday cheer this time around (I could also be convinced that without the burden of war on their shoulders, they're just happier -- plus at the end of the HTTYD movie there is a whole warmer, kinder side that both of these characters show -- I can buy it).  Being a holiday story, it does border on being sappy, but I'm not about to be grinch-y about that.  Its tender moments really are what made this so enjoyable.

I also found myself quite impressed with the quality of the production, especially in the character animation.  Even without all of the rich textures and lighting that existed in the original movie, they didn't skimp where I felt it truly matters (""the meat in the sandwich,"" as Hiccup might say), which are the delightful expressions and acting during key moments.  The entire voice cast from the movie is also back, and it feels like they're just as happy to be back on Berk as we, the audience, are to watch them.  The stand-outs for me were the performances from Jay Baruchel (Hiccup) and America Ferrera (Astrid).

WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE SO MUCH:

As other reviewers have mentioned, this was a bit short.  I found myself wishing it was an hour, instead of the 22 minutes it is.  I was only expecting something the length of the previous ""Legend of the Boneknapper,"" but for others who weren't aware of the length, I could understand the disappointment...

But honestly, I was thrilled with ""Gift of the Night Fury,"" and there isn't much else that I didn't like about it.

BOOK OF DRAGONS:

I wasn't sure what to expect at all for ""Book of Dragons,"" but having read the Cressida Cowell books, I really did enjoy the whimsical story that was introduced in this 17-minute short.  It might be a little too juvenille for some fans, but I felt that it was really in the flavor of the original books.  But being an avid fan of the those, I definitely appreciated the lighter and more slapstick approach that ""Book of Dragons"" took.  Leaves me hoping that more of these dragons (and maybe even more of the dragons from Ms. Cowell's series) will be included in future Dragon stories.

FINAL THOUGHTS:

Be aware that both ""Gift of the Night Fury"" (at 22 minutes) and ""Book of Dragons"" (at 17 minutes) are each short features, NOT full-length features.  Knowing that, I think both shorts are wonderful stories that fans of the franchise should enjoy.  It's great to rejoin our friends on the island of Berk, just in time for the holidays.",1322956800,3,3956,4.6451149425287355
4831302,5,B005LZW944,"Not sure where the confusion comes in play -- these are movie shorts; not full-fledged movies; one could easily check out the time duration posted on the back of the DVD/BD.  The material adds to the universe; and I'm thankful for the releases.  ""The Gift"" has top notch production, just like the theatrical movie; it's set up like a 22 minute Christmas special, if one were to add in 7 minutes of commercials as network television, I could easily see this being played down the line on TV as a yearly holiday special, and I hope it does.  I thought ""Dragon"" in general was robbed of it's Oscar last year; and I'm just happy more material is being released.  There's a plethera of special features, and all combined easily makes up for a short animated movie in ways.  Well worth the $15 it is being sold for.",1322784000,15,809,4.476190476190476
4831303,1,B005LZW944,"My son has been anxiously awaiting this ""Thrilling next chapter"" to the movie, with ""2 adventures"". He was very disappointed to see how short the first adventure was, more disappointed at the second ""adventure"" that was not an adventure, and very disappointed at the deleted scenes where they said that they were ""cut for time"".

It seems obvious this was a made-for-TV special (at 30 minute holiday show?) that they decided to put on DVD with a couple of quick extras to earn more money. How disappointing for the whole family and a waste of my money.",1322352000,8,552,4.690721649484536
4831304,1,B005LZW944,"it's ok but not for this price. Rent it if possible. The second part, the Book of Dragons, is especially bad because it starts out with recaps of the film (no new animation there) and worse, it then shows the types of dragons in a simple, non CGI cartoon style. It's very primitive and nothing at all like the first movie.",1322265600,10,322,4.295081967213115

4831306,1,B005LZW944,"I loved the first movie, and was really excited to see a 2 disc release with new movies. And the blue ray was only $18.99!! Wow!
Well that should have tipped me off. Both movies are shorts, which, if listed that way would have been fine. I ended up not waiting to purchase through amazon,and bought mine at a store. (I also ended up purchasing the DVD instead of the blue ray for $14.99) So the 2 dvd's were cellophaned back to back so you couldn't read the run time, and no where on the front does it say ""a short film"" or a ""movie short"" so I believed I was buying 2 new full length movies.
I thought Book of Dragon's was only okay. The idea of reading or paging through the book that is in the first movie and explaining more about each dragon was neat, but executed all wrong. Had they had more with the regular charcters maybe walking you up to the dragons, and discussing them that would have been better? I don't know but neither my kids nor I really liked this one.
 The Gift of the Night Fury was really good. Personally I think they could have extended this and made it way longer. But even as a short, it's really good.
Together these ""movies"" are under 40 minutes. Really? They couldn't have fit one disc?  I wouldn't mind so much, except 15 bucks is too steep a price for this.
It's worth a watch, but I would wait for the price to go way down, before buying. Or at least be aware that you're spending $15 on less then an hours worth of movies.",1321920000,8,1457,4.181494661921708
4831307,5,B005LZW944,"I purchased this DVD as a gift for my niece because she and I are big fans of How To Train Your Dragon and Surf's Up, literally, there have been days where we watch the two DVDs all day on replay. Awesome movies, lots of action, incredible cartoons. We were looking forward to watching Gift of the Night Fury because of the action that part I packed. With that said, we purchased part I a week before it was available. (Notes on that: we got the lower price by preordering, and the order was shipped on Monday, even though it wasn't release 'til Tuesday, and we received it in the mail on Saturday.) We were excited. We sat watching in excitement, until we saw the credits roll up at 22 minutes.

In summary: I rate this item with five stars because of the price, shipping, and quality of the amazing cartoon. I rate this item with one star because it should be emphasized that this short film is only 22 minutes long. Yes, the extras are good, but still not the long movie that we were anticipating.",1321833600,3,1000,4.347593582887701
