4985924,4,B006GA7FWO,"Lets recreate the ""behind the scenes"" politicking first. The very fact that Deepika Padukone could make it as a heroine and that too by debuting in an SRK production points at her uncomparable politicking abilities. It is evident that she must have been arriving at the sets with scissors in hands to chop off as much footage of Chitrangada's that her ""netagiri"" and her beau's ""businessgi...ri"" could have afforded. Mudai laakh bura chahe to kya hota, wohi hota hai jo manzoor-e-glamour-khuda hota hai. Chitrangda has uncomparable sex appeal, class and mischeviousness which no scissors can chop off, ""hard luck Deepika - eh!!!!""
Coming to the movie. It is short and sweet. A few scenes are hilarious. Akshay is more of Tom the cat than he is Jerry and John is, well, John is always John. John is India's Keanu Reeves, someone who looks and acts the same no matter what character he is trying to enact.
The movie is good fun. The music is unique and foot tapping. Everyone (Deepika NOT included) looks very good, especially Chitrangada (ooooo la la). There is a smile on one's face from start to end. And for any movie to be able to do that for the over-stressed, over-frsutrated Indian audiences, is a big achievement. Watch it with good friends and family.",1329436800,2,1259,4.779816513761468
4985925,3,B006GA7FWO,"Desi Boyz is well and cohesively directed by debutante director Rohit Dhawan. It has cool cinematography,fine script and some good acting as its positives. Akshaya Kumar surprises here with a heart-felt performance as the single father of a kid and a devoted simple minded friend. Film in its subject matter resembles ""Oops"" 2003 by Deepak Tijori. Anupam Kher is funny and good support here and so is Sanjay Dutt. Deepika and John are just OK so and so. You can watch it once or just to kill time.

Akshaya's part has some similarities with Cary Grant in Penny Serenade.",1327968000,4,570,4.757575757575758
4985926,3,B006GA7FWO,"A fun Bollywood movie with some Romantic Comedy and some Family Drama and quite a bit of dancing. None of the dance numbers are spectacular, but are often creatively staged and costumed and (appropriately as the movie is set in London) include quite a diversity of looks among the dancers. The singing, however, is so heavily auto-tuned that the vocals might as well have been created with a synthesizer. The movie builds momentum slowly and certainly isn't one I would highly recommend, but it is a reasonable diversion and isn't one to avoid, either.",1326326400,2,552,4.882978723404255
4985927,4,B006GA7FWO,"This is a Fun movie for people who like a lot of music, sexy dancing, sexy bodies, and a little cheezy wheeling and dealing. However, there's a bit of drama in the midst of it because a fun-loving irresponsible sexy guy neglects to take a romantic relationship serious. Life goes sort of topsy-turvy on him, as well as on others involved. At that point the story leaves you unsure of what to expect, but you'll want to see it through to the end.",1400976000,3,445,4.373493975903615
4985928,5,B006GA7FWO,"Loved it, loved it, loved it..... great movie. One I will watch over and over again with the two hottest desi actors.",1398816000,,117,4.363636363636363
4985929,5,B006GA7FWO,"I had never heard of this film but I was on an 11-hour flight from Zurich so decided to check it out.  Funny,! Entertaining! Off-beat!
As soon as I got back home, I ordered the DVD.",1391558400,,181,4.027777777777778
4985930,4,B006GA7FWO,"Hot Indian men and women -- fast pasted Bromance where everything ends happily in the end. Boy meets girl, looses girl gets girl in the end! Good fun and singing and dancing to boot!",1375488000,2,182,4.382352941176471
4985931,1,B006GA7FWO,I thought this movie was going to be good because it has Akshay Kumar and John Abraham. No! I did not see the wow! factor in this at all. Two sexy men in a dull film. I ended up giving this movie to my mom because she is a huge Akshay and John fan. I was too until I watched this film. Hopefully when these two act together in a film in the future it won't suck like this film did. What a waste of my money and two hours of my like I will never get back.,1365984000,2,454,3.642857142857143
4985932,4,B006GA7FWO,"Honestly, my kids wanted this just for the music, after having watched the music video of the title track like a MILLION times.  I am a GREAT Akshay Kumar fan, but not a real fan of John Abraham, but I think they did a good job with the material that they had to work with.  GREAT MUSIC, by the way!",1358208000,2,299,3.966666666666667
4985933,4,B006GA7FWO,"Ahhh bollywood. A very entertaining movie with some very catchy songs. Not exactly the bollywood version of Magic Mike that I was expecting, but great none-the-less. It had English subtitles as promised, which was a huge relief. The only thing is I seemed to have trouble with the audio when I tried to play it in my Blueray player, but it worked fine on my laptop. Not sure what happened there.",1351728000,2,395,4.577464788732394
4985934,4,B006GA7FWO,"This movie is a great introduction to the world of ""Bollywood"".  It uses all of the cliches which makes Bollywood a strong contender to the ""crap"" coming out of Hollywood since it started being run by accountants and bankers.
Desi Boyz is absolutely hilarious, thoughtful, compassionate and an eye-blowing extravaganza.",1347148800,2,319,5.38
4985935,4,B006GA7FWO,"I love John Abraham so was very keen to watch yet another of his movies.

Desi Boyz is not your typical Hindi movie, there is a lot more risky subject matter than most.

Both the main actors were great, not amazing but they definitely loved showing off their bodies!

Some catchy songs and dances but very good overall.",1332892800,2,319,4.4655172413793105
4985936,5,B006GA7FWO,"I usually don't go for the show me the beef cake movies but this one not only goes for the beef cake it goes for the laughs and the heart.  This movie is a lot of fun period . Similar to the HEART of, but none of the content of the Full Monty. No nudity or embarrassing practice sessions. The dance scenes are energetic, fun and tastefully done. none of that pulling off the garter crap or cheap dollar bill in the thank God non-existent gstring. None of that . This movie is done with a light touch so you don't feel embarrassed for them doing a job they wouldn't normally choose for themselves.  This is very tongue in cheek style.  They just come across as making sure everyone is having a good time in playfully designed sets and costume fantasy , fireman, motorcycles etc., and you're invited for the fun and the very spectacular dancing. The writer/director makes sure we as the audience are included.

The story grows forward with the characters as they aren't as desperate anymore and the bills are being paid up to date , John Abrahams character Hunter decides to stop doing this , and tells Akshay( Rocco)But right before he can retire his fiance catches a Youtube video her friends are looking at and it's her fiance in living color  (actually fun one on youtube for real). Big fight and it spills onto Jerry who is told to get out and grow up.  When she walks away from him he is forced into conferring with her father on how to get her back. Very funny times ahead on that plot line.

 Next up the maturation of Jerry(rocco) . When he is thrown out and his nephew taken from his custody he launches a desperate plan to go back to college and finish his last semester and get his ""son"" out of foster care.  Living in a dorm and surrounded by dead head slackers he begins to grow up and is confronted by a girl who had a crush on him when he was there before . She has lost weight and become a professor. When he has trouble with her class she launches a sexy and funny campaign to help his heart and mind to succeed . LOVED this fun and very entertaining film. LOTS OF HOT GIRLS FOR THE GUYS TOO. Some extremely funny moments for the job seekers of the world who will feel a definite connection with Jerry (rocco) when he goes to interview now with a degree in hand but no experience. With friend ""Hunter"" at his side giving him wildly crazy, but effective advice he can't fail. Not to be missed.

 Wrapping it up... John Abraham you are tremendously improved (the courage it took to wear that snow hat lol) . To Akshay Kumar Thank you once again for making our days a little more tolerable , the load is always lighter to carry when you are laughing and smiling or being made to feel you are worth working for. Helps you to keep your eye on the true prizes of life ..friends and family.  Fans you might want to check out his other recent Dramadies ... ""House Full""  ""Patiala House"" ""Namastey London "". Akshay not only knows how to keep us laughing but to keep on loving life and trying even when the odds are stacked against you. Keep Smiling :D",1331251200,2,3058,4.315881326352531

8497452,4,B006GA7FWO,"Great songs, but the movie seems atypical for Bollywood sensibilities, glamorizing sex, drugs, stalking... Now I'm no prude, and at least the first is fine (the drug in question is Mary Jane), but I'm not sure what the message of the film was. Oh well, the leads are nice to look at at least.",1517011200,,292,4.425925925925926
