8496940,1,B001L5FXI2,I got totally sick of Richard Hoagland when he was on Art Bell. He was a straight up BS artist and a full-on con man.,1517529600,,117,3.72

8496942,3,B001L5FXI2,"Some of the info here is outdated, so that's hurts in credibility. Some of the details you've seen before in other documentarys. It comes down to: are the pyramids and faces what they seem, or is Nasa hiding the truth with no images, bad images, or just plain lying about them.

Way to much fuzzy math and geometry to fit the so called ""facts"".

The presentation takes place at the U.N. That alone should tell you there's a lot of nonsense going on.",1496275200,,449,4.397590361445783

8496944,5,B001L5FXI2,"This program made history when iy was originally released. How digitally restored this program remains an important part of UFO research history. The section devoted to Hyperdimensional Physics remains the best presentation to date on this important piece if the ET puzzle. Also, the section at the end that is devoted to the analysis of NASA Space Shuttle UFO video footage is also historical and remains an additional important piece of the evidence that proves disclosure is upon us.",1487980800,2,486,5.1645569620253164

8496948,2,B001L5FXI2,"Tetrahedron's at nearly 19.5 degrees north or south at points on several planets. What the heck is this guy talking about? Mr. Hoagland is using a long stretch of the imagination and some complicated mathematical hypothesis to try and find a connection between shapes seen from a blurry photo of Mars, and the location of energy upwelling points on other planets. Apparently he is suggesting that some former inhabitants of Mars were astrologists who devoted their time to leaving a puzzling message for future cosmic explorers to decipher.  Maybe it's the belief of cosmologists that their interplanetary predecessors were as complex and pretentious as they are, or maybe they were just as clever at selling their stories. Mr. Hoagland can still be heard pitching his books on the am radio band, accusing NASA of conspiring to keep humanity ignorant of some big government secret that would change everything. Well it's been over 20 years, and nothing much has changed. In fact we're all just as doomed as we've ever been, and possible evidence of life on other planets hasn't changed a thing. Some interesting pictures, and theories about what they might mean, but pretty darn boring too.",1430352000,3,1190,5.040609137055838
