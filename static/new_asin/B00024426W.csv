2060731,5,B00024426W,A very great Christmas story with wonderful music. I believe very few persons today remember this on TV many years ago. I recalled it being shown but had no idea the title or year. Was very happy to find this and very pleased with obtaining it. Highly recommend it.,1281916800,10,265,4.428571428571429
2060732,5,B00024426W,"This is a beautiful Christmas movie.  Jimmy Stewart is great as Mr. Krueger - he can really tug at your heartstrings!

This story really tells you what Christmas is REALLY all about - not Santa, presents, toys or Christmas Cookies, but of the birth of Jesus, and being good to one another.

I am so not a weeper, but this can get even my tears flowing!

PS - there is some great footage taken in Temple Square, where at Christmastime, it is all lit up and there are all types of special performances.",1277251200,3,500,4.344086021505376
2060733,5,B00024426W,"My Fiance introduced me to this movie about a year or two ago.  We tried to get it at that time, but we were sent another movie instead.  I'm glad to have found it on your sight at such a good price. It is a very good movie.  If you have never seen it, I would recommed it to all.",1261440000,8,280,3.6333333333333333
2060734,5,B00024426W,Jimmy Stewart's portrayal as Mr. Krueger is one of his best performances and comes late in his career. He touches you with this character as never before. You will take a new look at life: and love.,1244246400,13,198,4.378378378378378
2060735,5,B00024426W,"In this wonderful film Jimmy Stewart is Willy Kruger, a lonely and aging widower, who lives in a basement apartment with his cat George. After finishing his work for the day as the custodian for the building, he ventures out on Christmas Eve to buy a tree. Returning home, he falls asleep listening to an LP by The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, dreaming that he is conducting them in carols of the season. When he awakes, he finds some carollers outside his window and he beckons them to visit him offering hot chocolate but they leave after only one song. Willy then finds two tiny mittens left behind by Clarissa, the youngest of the carolling group, and he puts them on his Christmas tree. On their return for the mittens, Clarissa invites Willy to join them and her mum realizes that they really need a bass voice to fill-out their singing before finishing the evening with a turkey dinner.

Mr. Kruger's Christmas is a short movie that has captured superbly the spirit and true meaning of Christmas. Willy Kruger honors the tradition and his child-like excitement is contagious!  He takes us on an amazing  journey to Winter Wonderland where he drives a sleigh, helps decorating a giant Christmas tree and making a snowman,  and conducts a choir. And while arranging the figures of his nativity, he finds himself in the manger for the very first Christmas. This is very emotional moment and the choice of  ""What Child is This"" song for the scene couldn't be better!  Willy apologises for not bringing a present, only to realise that this isn't important.  He knees down  and thanks the infant Jesus for always being there for him and gives Jesus his love -the most  beautiful present of all!

Jimmy Stewart's  performance as Mr. Kruger is breathtaking!  His humility, his joy, his tears and his admiration of Jesus are genuine and deeply touching. He brings me to tears every time I watch the film.  His profound message couldn't be more timely, because we are loosing it. We've become too practical, too materialistic, too inconsiderate  and too ignorant, and we need to be reminded of the core values- love of country, love of family, love and taking care of the weak and helpless and most of all, love of God. And we need to be reminded  of the true meaning of Christmas. It is not about eating, drinking and countless parties. Christmas is sacred- it is all about Love!",1164844800,109,2373,4.711864406779661
2060736,5,B00024426W,"When you watch this,you realize what a treasure to the nation Jimmy Stewart was. If you don't love this short movie,you have no soul. Brings out the Christmas story and the human dimensions of our saviour's birth. A WORD OF CAUTION-the price of this product has plumented,the reason is the sponsoring church gave away a few hundred thousand last year. The sellers need to make clear which version they are selling. I just purused the listings and it is usually unclear if the FREE version is the one for sale. BUYER BEWARE!!!!If it is not the Jimmy Stewart cover-it is the free gift version. Big difference on several levels.",1147046400,36,625,4.743119266055046
2060737,4,B00024426W,"Mr. Krueger's Christmas is the story of a lonely widower, wonderfully portrayed by Jimmy Stewart, who finds comfort and peace through a group of carollers singing outside his basement apartment window.  His interaction with them places him in a fantasy sequence directing the world famous Mormon Tabernacle Choir.  Later, in a very poignant scene, he imagines himself in the stable on the very first Christmas and he expresses his gratitude for the events of that night.

The additional tracks contain wonderful Christmas music by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, a unique presentation of the Naitivity, and a well made, short dramatization of the beginnings of the LDS church.",1134432000,44,673,5.271028037383178
2060738,5,B00024426W,"Love this movie.  Very touching performance by Jimmy Stewart.  We watch it every year at Christmas.  Filmed near where I live fun to see the familiar sites. There's no one quite like Jimmy Stewart.  He is a custodian in a large building, a poor guy who is transport for a minute back to the time when Jesus was born.  No one can see him but the baby.  As I understand it that scene was only filled once because his performance was so genuine no other take was needed.  Worth it for just that scene.  The rest of the movie is wonderful as well.  It's not too long but packed full of the Christmas spirit.  Perfect movie to start the Christmas Season.",1511395200,,649,4.289256198347108
2060739,5,B00024426W,"It is a beautiful Christmas story that tells the real meaning of Christmas - LOVE, and of course no body can do that like Jimmy Stewart.  It also sheds some light on how the older folk  are left out of some of our Christmas traditions and reminds us to be more sensitive to their feelings.",1510012800,,289,4.236363636363636

2060756,5,B00024426W,"Jimmie Stewart has a scene talking to the Baby Jesus.  Mr. Stewart stumbles his way through in Jimmie Stewart style even as an older sort, a 'back in time' talk. Even for me, a poor excuse for a Christian is most eyes..... I suppose, but when you watch this you will be on-board.. Jimmie Stewart talking to The Baby Jesus?

2060758,2,B00024426W,Guess I should read the content better. I saw a clip of Jimmy Stewart on Youtube and wanted to see the rest of the movie. That Free Clip WAS THE MOVIE.,1484611200,2,151,3.903225806451613

2060767,1,B00024426W,"I was very disappointed. I had no idea that they had substituted original scenes for scenes with the Mormon church in them, and I never would have paid to have the story of Joseph Smith. I thought The Restoration meant the restoration of the original movie, not the story or JS. Actually, I wish I could get a refund.",1483747200,3,317,4.389830508474576

2060779,2,B00024426W,"I watched this for the first time this year. I'd never seen it before, but saw the clip of Jimmy Stewart and the Nativity, and decided to look it over. I found it on YouTube, and watched the entire movie. The Nativity scene was the best part of the movie. This movie is about a lonely man and his cat George. He befriends a little girl, Clarissa, who is caroling outside his apartment building. This movie is only 25 minutes long, and consists mostly of singing, and the imagination of Mr. Krueger. The Nativity scene of Mr. Krueger is the best part of the movie, the rest is sheer cheese. It was great for a once over, but I wouldn't care to see it again. It's sweet in its own way, with a little girl showing him some attention on a lonely night before Christmas. Love is everything, without it, we die.",1482192000,,805,4.302631578947368

2060781,5,B00024426W,This was kind of a disappointment. After what I had been led to believe. I guess the hype I heard caused me to think it was a full length movie. I think I paid $14 for it. I've seen them up to $70 something. The subject matter was very touching. If Mormons aren't supposed to believe in Jesus as the son of God why would they make this kind of a video. Apparently there are some serious misunderstandings about Mormonism.,1481241600,,421,4.275

2060784,5,B00024426W,This has been a favorite of mine since I first saw it on TV in the 1970's. Have been looking for it ever since. The story of course is wonderful but seeing Jimmy Stewart in it makes it extra special. He is living alone in a basement apt. when Carolers come by  and see him in the window. He invites  them in for cocoa and it goes from there. There is nothing like it nowdays,1476403200,2,374,3.973333333333333

I've shown it to no less than four others since it came, and each one had the same response.  This little gem is touching, extremely well made, unforgettable.  I'm told that during a certain scene ... you'll recognize it when you see shepherds ...

2060887,3,B00024426W,"Mr. Krueger's Christmas is what would have been the result if the Mormons had gotten ahold of the script to Umberto D before De Sica did.  Basically it the story of an elderly, apparently widowed man, forgotten by the rest of the busy world.  The trite ending is worthy of a movie produced by The Hallmark Channel.  I've watched this short movie several times and it disturbes me that deeper issues were apparently missed or not explored, but then this is a half hour feel good Christmas message movie.  However, I always wondered, where are this man's children, or didn't he have any?  There are a lot of elderly who are isolated from the rest of society, who spend their holidays alone.  They should have named the cat Pyewacket (Bell, Book and Candle), rather than George (perhaps an allusion to George Bailey, Stewart's character in It's a Wonderful Life).  It's an acceptable Christmas diversion, but seems to leave a lot of questions.",1418860800,,940,4.765432098765432

2061005,3,B00024426W,"Being a huge Jimmy Stewart fan, I was surprised to find this movie that I'd never heard of before. Upon watching it, I was very disappointed in the real lack of story. It was all very predictable. Mr. Stewart was wonderful in his portrayal, but given that Mr. Stewart was older there really wasn't much given to him to develop as a character for Mr. Krueger. Filming, costumes, music, etc. are all excellent as one would expect with a Morman produced video. I was surprised to see that the musical performances by the Morman Tabernacle Choir were all taken from other recordings, and I had already seen these songs in annual Christmas productions. So nothing new here. However, if you want a ""feel good"", charming - lots of cute kids, horse drawn sleighs, Utah snow and smiling people, you may enjoy this DVD.

The Restoration doesn't really have anything to do with Christmas, but rather is a dramatic depiction of Joseph Smith's spiritual search. The Nativity seems to have been filmed on a movie set with full costumes and animals and everyone speaks in a language that might be Aramaic or a form of Arabic. I don't really know. Both of these are visually strong short films.",1320969600,6,1178,4.690821256038648
2061006,5,B00024426W,"By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.com

James Stewart was probably the best and most accomplished actor in history (See his biography on Wikipedia!) Behind the great man, indeed what made him so good (in every sense), I believe (unknown to his fans) was a deep and abiding faith in Jesus Christ. Never did Stewart get to express his faith until 'Mr. Krueger's Christmas' at the end of his career. He stated that only one time was he ever offered a role that did not have sex, violence or profanity.

Julia Stewart (no relation to Jimmy Stewart), another 5 star reviewer, tells the story of 'Mr. Krueger's Christmas' so well that I'll not do that here. (If you love motion pictures, you should see all of Julia's film reviews! No one does it better.)

It was a life long dream of Jimmy Stewart to conduct the Mormon Tabernacle Choir which he does in a dream sequence in the film. It was not in the script but in the filming of that part when he finished conducting, Stewart stands weeping as the cameras kept rolling and the Choir gives him a standing ovation.

The Nativity manger scene (another dream sequence) where Stewart expresses his love for the baby Jesus, I believe was Stewart's personal witness of his faith in Jesus Christ. He was interviewed by Johnny Carson soon after the film was made. Stewart wanted to tell about the film but Carson kept leading him away by asking questions about other things.

There are additional parts of the DVD that are obviously intended as publicity (some would say propaganda) for the Mormon Church. If you don't have a problem with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, you don't have to watch the other parts. The film stands alone as a beautiful Christmas story and a fulfillment of Stewart's dream to conduct the choir plus giving him an opportunity in the manger scene to express his love for the Savior.

Included on the 25th Anniversary DVD is a 25 minute selection of Christmas Carols by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir (almost worth the price of the DVD). If the Mormon choir is a problem, you don't even need to buy the DVD. You can see on Youtube  the manger scene from the film which was Jimmy Stewart's last great performance.

See all of my Reviews. I write only about books, events, or motion pictures that have changed the course of history or unforgettable books or motion pictures that will totally change peoples lives.

The film is certainly a big let down and not like a normal classic Christmas movie. It was more like I watched a movie about people having weird dreams or hallucinations from the effects of drugs than a Christmas time movie.

You can also watch it on youtube or mormon.org for free. This is the original Mormon produced film, has not been changed as some people have stated. It is Christ based but not Mormon based. If you like Jimmy Stewart you will like this, just don't spend the money on a DVD, watch it online for free.",1514073600,,608,4.066666666666666
