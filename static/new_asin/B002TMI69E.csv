8380303,3,B002TMI69E,"It's A Film About Social Abuse Committed By A Mexican Chief Of Police And His Demented family. El Negro (Chief Of Police) uses his power for lust, Including Offering To Help Out A Widow's Who's Husband Who Was Killed On Duty, In Exchange For Sex On His Desk. His Teenage Son Is Able to Get away With Murder ( In This Case: Runs Over An Old Woman And Laughs About It). The Film Looks Old And Needs To Be Restored Or Remastered, Though That's Ever Going Happen. It's A Chessy Based On A True Story (Yes True Story) Film That Should Not Be Ignored Because Of The Chessy Acting. NOTE: If You Just Wanna See Full Frontal Nudity With Hot Busty Mexican Women This Is A Must-Get, Other Than That There Ain't Much Else To See Because The Action In This Film Is Sloppy ( Though Seen Lot Worse), So Sloppy It Makes Them Old Roger Corman Films Look Like Michael Bay Films.",1306800000,,860,4.282208588957055
