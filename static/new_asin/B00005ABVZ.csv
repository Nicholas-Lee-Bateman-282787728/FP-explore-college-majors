7935292,5,B00005ABVZ,I had seen this video while visiting relatives 4 years ago. Took this long to order it but now that I've got it.... :-),1412553600,,119,4.0
7935293,5,B00005ABVZ,"One of the very best ""Carmen""s I have ever seen, and I have seen, and heard a lot.  The staging just blew my mind, so very, very original, and Carmen looked and sounded like a Carmen should look and sound.  In itself, that's rather unique in the opera world.  I thought the whole production almost perfect, the only blotch coming from the various TVs around the stage (although not in any way impeding the viewing) so that the performers could see the conductor.  But to be fair, this is one of my favorite operas anyway.",1393372800,,521,4.4526315789473685
7935294,2,B00005ABVZ,"I won't dwell long on this one. I had much higher hopes for Ewing and was disappointed in her singing here (though her acting is passable). Gauci is alright, but of course Michaela does not make the opera (and feels like an obligatory appendix in the best of productions, despite some lovely music opportunities for her in the written score). I'm not even going to talk about the rest of the cast because others have done a fair job of it already. I daresay the orchestra was trying their best to sound good, but the sound quality (or microphone distribution?) was spotty, for the singers and everyone else as well.

One thing I will say is that at least this production was not horrendously modernized in the staging. This is small consolation, though.

The choreography was a bit confused and sometimes rather poor. Yes, there is plenty of it to see, but quantity does not make up for quality.

Most glaring of all was the lousy camera maneuvering. Unless this was intentionally meant to look like a ""backstage view"" dress rehearsal, it's downright amateurish sometimes, both in terms of camera placement and zoom editing. I could understand artsy angles (a-la many TV shows of the 1960s), but that's not the problem here. It's just bad camerawork. The bizarre round set did nothing to help this issue.

This luckily wasn't my first ""Carmen"" because I might have been permanently uninterested in Bizet if it was. I wholeheartedly recommend people to avoid this production. I know it costs more, but try the ""movie"" version with Placido Domingo, or perhaps the BBC Glyndbourne Festival staging with Anne Sophie von Otter. Like my title says, I bought this item for $3 in a thrift store, and boy am I glad I did or else I would be kicking myself for bothering to pay more than that.",1374451200,,1782,4.701923076923077
7935295,5,B00005ABVZ,"I kept checking this out of the library, so I finally just ordered my own copy.  This is a fabulous production of Carmen.  Maria Ewing is so spectacular...as a Mezzo AND as an actress.  First of all, she looks like a gypsy.  Her eyes are remarkable...you can see them bulge and glare, even on a long shot.  She is just so brazen and sensuous and sullen...and she does great little theatrical ""business"" gestures, like picking lint off her dress.  She's Carmen as a woman in charge.  Everybody else is fabulous, too.  The tempo is upbeat.  The theatre is in the round.  And there are lots of surprises!",1358726400,,601,4.5327102803738315
7935296,4,B00005ABVZ,"When looking for Carmen on DVD I read the reviews and picked this one because of the special staging ant the flamenco extra and I was not disappointed!
A grand-scale production with a large cast of 80,beautifully staged and with an extra 10 minutes flamenco dance.
Maria Ewing combines great singing with powerful acting. Her Carmen is vivid,sensual and full of passion.
The best Carmen I have seen.
If you want to ""hear"" the opera then you may find better versions on CD,but if you want to""see"" the opera, this is the DVD to buy!
I liked the staging,the choreography and the acting.
I give it only 4 stars because of the supporting casting which is good but no more.",1028592000,10,667,4.566666666666666
