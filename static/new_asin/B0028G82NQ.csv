3872683,2,B0028G82NQ,Much of the same accounts that are told over and over again.  I was expecting more on today's accomplished Italian-Americans but it ended circa LaGuardia.,1251158400,2,154,5.16
3872684,5,B0028G82NQ,"This is a strong, biting, informative documentary, essential viewing for Italian Americans as well as African AMericans and all people whose ancesters came to the new world in search of a better life.",1250726400,2,200,5.090909090909091
3872685,5,B0028G82NQ,"This important film excels in two ways: it is deeply moving and compelling, with excellent visuals and music; and it is well researched, avoiding easy sentiment and stereotypes. I learned a lot that was new to me, although all my grandparents emigrated from Italy and I have read a fair amount on the subject.

I would certainly recommend this film to anyone of Italian descent. But it is also of much broader interest, to anyone who wants to understand more of the human cost of immigration and the complexity of the earlier ""great waves"" of American immigration. Additionally, I think it is valuable to understand the suffering and racism experienced by many different groups of immigrants. For example, this film documents the fact that many lynching victims in the American South were Italian immigrants.

This film is compelling and visually varied, with excellent choices of music and documents, not at all dry.(In other words, the time flies.) Parents should screen it first before sharing it with children; this is not prettied up, though it is quite possible to skip the most disturbing scenes if you have pre-screened it. And there is a great deal that is delightful.

I saw this two years ago at an early screening at New York University's Casa Italiana. Interest was so great that the auditorium overflowed and a link had to be set up to allow viewing in a second room, also packed. As people left, I could hear them continuing their conversations about the film as they walked down the street. I'm delighted that it is now commercially available.

3872686,4,B0028G82NQ,"You don't see a whole of lot of documentation of Italians outside of New York or New Jersey, so I was happy to see this one. My own father and Grandparents settled in Marin County, California. They worked for the Railroad, Water Company, and even that rock quarry that was shown in scene from Dirty Harry. It is now a posh shopping center and the ferry launch to San Francisco.
I agree with other reviewers that a lot was left out, and more could have been included, but I guess that the Italian American experience is so vast and varied that it would indeed take a long running miniseries to showcase the scope and diversity of Italian American immigration and family background. Since Italy was regional for so long, with the many little kingdoms and separate governments, this country and its descendants are incredibly diverse, yet share so much in common regarding heart-felt emotions, love of food, family and music for example.
One thing is for sure: I miss my Grandparents and Great Aunts and Uncles. My kids will never hear their current relatives speak with that melodious sound of native Italian speakers conversing in English, or speaking passionately among themselves in Italian. They will never smell my grandmother's kitchen, or see her elaborate sewing room. They will never see the section in the basement where my Grandfather stored his homemade wine. Heck, they may never see a basement!
My kids not being 100 % Italian, unlike myself, may not even be interested in such things. They are now completely American. Ironically, something that their great Grandfathers and Grandmothers would have wanted, anyway.",1424822400,4,1627,4.9633699633699635

3872689,4,B0028G82NQ,"What should have been a 5 star rating, unfortunately fell short of the expectations of many. I was impressed with the first half of the documentary, as few historians have covered the history of Italians in the Mother Lode area during the Gold Rush Era. I liked the way Norelli tied them to the history of Italians in San Francisco. What was disappointing was the complete omission of the Italians of the Santa Clara Valley. Though now known as Silicon Valley, the Santa Clara Valley was once a thriving agricultural community, where fruits and vegetables that fed the United States was not only grown but processed at canneries. A large percentage of farmers, and cannery owners were owned and operated by Italian immigrants. A Norelli completed ignored the fact that Bank of America founder A.P. Giannini was born in San Jose. He also ignored the fact that Santa Clara was founded by two Italian Jesuit priests, John Nobility and Michael Accolti 1851. These are just a few of the historical facts that was totally ignored, and should not have been as the Italian immigrants contributed to what is known today as Silicon Valley. Also ignored were the immigrants who settled in the Merced, Fresno and Kern Counties, whose Italian American history goes back to the mid 1800s, where many immigrants were grape farmers, produced wine (not a word about the Gallo family) and olives. Also many worked for the railroad, which brought them to California, or worked as cattlemen. One area that he went into at great length was about Simon Rodia and the Watts Towers, which he seemed to be impressed with, but where too much time was spent. I wavered between 3 and 4 stars as I felt the complete story of the Italian immigrants in California was not told, but decided on 4 because the documentary was well done, and possibly the documentarian, who is not from California, was influenced by others.",1401840000,7,1888,4.812307692307693
3872690,4,B0028G82NQ,"There are several videos about the immigration of Italians to America, but this one focuses on the impact the Italians had on California.  It is filled with historical information that many of us were unaware of.  The viewing time is just under two hours but it seem a lot less.

I would recommend this over others I have purchased in the past.",1401753600,2,344,4.516129032258065
3872691,4,B0028G82NQ,I am sure my mother in law will enjoy this movie for a Christmas gift. I can't rate it because I didn't watch it.,1387670400,,113,3.75
3872692,3,B0028G82NQ,"Lots of great information as to the discrimination, lynchings of early Southern Italians, down to the their integration in politics and business. Could have had more focus on all the positive contributions, I'd like to have heard more of Frank Sinatra, Justice Scalia and modern times - - but it was good for its purpose.",1380758400,4,321,4.8545454545454545
3872693,5,B0028G82NQ,"Excellent documentary. A bit depressing, though. Wish there were more uplifting stories as Italians were instrumental in so many things (politics, business, industry, education) here in the U.S. Their story formed our story as a nation. I wish more had been focused on that, too.",1358812800,4,279,5.222222222222222
3872694,5,B0028G82NQ,"This is a must see...and must have DVD for your collection.  Especially for those of Italian heritage. Most of us grew-up knowing some of the history involving our Italian ancestors that came to this country and how they contributed to its growth.  However, ""Pane Amaro"" provides hitorical facts that most will find surprising.",1264809600,8,327,5.150943396226415
3872695,5,B0028G82NQ,I saw this movie at the Nevada Museum of Art a few months ago.  I was in the process of writing a story about the immigration of my family from Italy so the timing was perfect.  It is a great documentary which I bought and shared with my writing group last week.  Everyone enjoyed it very much.,1261785600,5,294,4.12280701754386

8356226,4,B0028G82NQ,I found this very interesting.  I learned a lot about my Italian heritage.  I would recommend this.,1457913600,,99,4.764705882352941

8356228,5,B0028G82NQ,Really a pleasure to watch. Incredible stories and brings home the value the Italians brought to California (and America in general beyond discovering it for Europeans).,1429488000,,169,5.538461538461538

8356231,5,B0028G82NQ,I was able to buy the DVD some time ago and it was an emotional experience. It was good to hear about the influence Italians had in making California what it is today. Without this film we wouldn't have been aware of the scope. (Hearing a bit of Zeneize in the Stockton portion was a treat.),1425772800,3,291,4.214285714285714
8356232,5,B0028G82NQ,"At a time when the issues of immigration are in the news everyday, this documentary reminded me that the issues faced by Italians coming to America in past decades are similar to  those of today's immigrants from diverse nations.  It's a truthful and thought provoking series on Italian Immigrants in California.  I learned  a great deal and I came away with a better understanding of what life must have been like for those of my grandparents generation who made the perilous journey from Sicily to California a century ago. I appreciated that the controversies were included, the heroes and the not so heroic too. The whole history, not just the Chamber of Commerce version.  A beautiful job.

 Italians made their mark in every part of California. In the early days they were the largest ethnic group in many counties, census after census. It would be lovely to see a sequel that would continue the tale of their ups and downs, a story that can't be fully contained in 104 minutes, 5 stars or not.",1425427200,2,1000,4.712643678160919
8356233,5,B0028G82NQ,"I had to write to the filmmakers to compliment them on an outstanding film. My husband Tony and I watched it and were quite moved by this factual and sensitive portrayal of the California Italian American experience. I am certain that this film will be treasured by the entire Italian American community.
