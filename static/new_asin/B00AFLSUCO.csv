8550970,5,B00AFLSUCO,"First my background. Years of kickboxing and wrestling but NO experience in stick fighting (A one hour intro at the Fairtex in SF many years does not count)
So I wanted (needed) some basics, a strong foundation if you may and was skeptical about a video being able to provide that. I was wrong. Full Contact Stick Fighting does that and then some. Mr. Stoops is a fantastic instructor. He provides easy-to-follow, yet detailed instructions, showing the footwork and explaining the ""why"" of this or that thrust. And, building a solid foundation, he adds complexity without overwhelming you. The video quality is also excellent (unlike some others i bought on Amazon:(
All in all a very very good buy.",1391644800,24,699,4.882352941176471
