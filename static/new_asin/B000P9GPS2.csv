8472903,1,B000P9GPS2,"I should have read the only other review. The DVD indeed only shows a series of female nudes, accompanied by music. No commentary whatsoever. Judging from the CD box and the DVD itself, this looks like some homemade DVD, rather than a professional production.",1246838400,,259,4.909090909090909
8472904,1,B000P9GPS2,"This dvd consists of blurry camera scans of poorly printed art books. If you are looking for an overview of the female nude in painting, your time would be better spent going to your local library and looking at the same books yourself, instead of an out of focus camera doing it for you to a corny soundtrack of cliched music. I had hoped to see sharp detailed views of the original paintings instead of this amateurish attempt. Not worth it.",1228694400,2,443,4.481481481481482
