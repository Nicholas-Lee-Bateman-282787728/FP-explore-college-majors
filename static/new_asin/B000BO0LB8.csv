2430700,5,B000BO0LB8,"Loose adaptation of the famous Zola novel that has been made into movies quite a few times before this version and after, as well as stage plays.  Simone Signoret, looking radiant, is in the title role and Raf Vallone is her lover Laurent.  The chemistry between the two stars is real and makes this movie worth watching.  Vallone speaks French with an accent and it was a wise decision by the director (the legendary Marcel Carne, who also made ""Children of Paradise"") not to dub him.  Signoret's patrician icy coolness became something of a trademark that set a tone beautiful French stars after her have followed, e.g.,  Catherine Deneuve and Carole Bouquet.  Beauty must be calm, says Baudelaire in a famous poem.  Indeed.

The Zola novel, of course, is much better.  If this movie gets people reading the book, so much the better.",1238198400,4,835,4.783216783216783
2430701,3,B000BO0LB8,"Therese Raquin was a novel written by a young Emile Zola prior to penning the monumental Rougon-Macquart series.  This film adaptation of the novel is a decent story in it's own right, but does not remotely convey the emotion or drama of the original story.  If you don't know who Zola was, he was one of the two greatest French writers, an icon in France, whose work seems largely (and sadly) forgotten in the US.  Therese Raquin (played by Simone Signoret) is a tale of a woman in an unhappy marriage to a man (Camille) we would today call a mama's boy.  The couple lives with their mother-in-law.  Camille is winey and subservient to his mother, but controlling to his wife and not much of a husband.  Therese silently dreams of escaping her unhappy plight, but without any financial resources of her own, has little opportunity.  Camille brings a friend home one night, a strong, confident truck driver who is smitten by Therese.  They begin a secret tryst, but Therese refuses to leave with her lover.  In a moment of passion and anger, Laurent throws Camille from  a train to his death.  Unfortunately there is a witness, and both Laurent and Therese must live with the murder hanging over their heads as they try to make a deal with the witness.

  This film starts out faithfully to Zola's original novel, but degenerates into a relatively standard film noir story of murder and blackmail.  The setting has been transformed from the pre-Sedan world of Zola to the post-WWII era.  The film is extremely well cast and well acted.  Raf Villone does a great job as the not-too-intelligent but love-starved working man.  This may also be one of Signoret's best performances as her underplayed acting as Therese fits the part to a tee.  The main drawback of this film is that the feel of Zola's tale has not been captured.  The original story is about obsession and madness, this is a pretty standard film noir story of murder and revenge.  Bottom line is that this is definitely worth watching (as a rental) if you like film noir, or simply for the performances of Signoret and Vallone, but if you are going to spend the money, my advice is buy the book, it's much better than this film.",1200787200,8,2190,4.636363636363637

Raf Valone is her virile lover, the complete opposite of the man to whom she is married. And most of all, let's not forget that Karma is a bitch.",1415318400,,313,4.147540983606557
8089672,5,B000BO0LB8,"Updated version of the Zola classic, with new twists and turns. Erotic and sinister all at once, like the novel.
Luminous Simone Signoret. Powerful Raf Vallone. From the master director Marcel Carne'.  Great actors in the ensemble.
A slice of sordid Parisian bourgeois life, unredeemable by passion, sad but elegantly served.",1410134400,,325,5.372549019607843
8089673,3,B000BO0LB8,Classic film that unfortunately feels too slow for today's short attention span. Low key variation on Postman always rings twice.,1396569600,,129,5.5
8089674,5,B000BO0LB8,This is but one of Marcel Carne's masterworks and his unforgettable gift to good cinema lovers. Miss Signoret performed like no one else--artistic precision and elegance. Vallone who played her lover was excellent and the actor playing the blackmailer was riveting and sexy. See this movie--an outstanding homage to the genius of Emile Zola.,1387843200,,341,5.333333333333333
8089675,5,B000BO0LB8,"I'm a big fan of Marcel Carne. He made six of the best films ever: Port of Shadows (38), Hotel du Nord (38), Le jour se  leve (39), Les visitors du sour (42) and my favorite film Children of Paradise (45) --- (Truffaut reportedly stated that he would have given up all of his films to have made Children of Paradise, understandable, though it was Carne who reported that he said.) --- and then there is Therese Raquin (also known as the Adulteress), a perfect film of a young woman entrapped in a loveless, lifeless marriage to a weakling cousin (several times removed we hope) dominated by her mother-in-law. There is the twists of adultery, murder, remorse and blackmail --- with a double twist of fate bringing it all to resolution. Simone Signoret and Raf Vallone are stunning as the couple brought together by circumstances updated from Emile Zola's 1867 novel.",1378080000,3,866,4.735099337748345
8089676,5,B000BO0LB8,This has a great story and Simone Signoret is wonderful as the unfaithful wife. I had seen at at the French Institute many years ago and I was delighted to rediscover it and see it again.,1353715200,2,187,4.222222222222222
8089677,4,B000BO0LB8,"This 1953 film by Marcel Carne (Children of Paradise) bears very little resemblance to Zola's 1867 novel on which it is based. They share most of the same set of characters. And both novel and film deal with an adulterous affair and the murder committed by the lovers. There the resemblance begins to come undone.
Simone Signoret gives a one-dimensional performance as Thrse. This may be the result of her (Thrse's, not Simone's) deadening upbringing, though in the novel at least her stolid temperament is roused to heights of passion when she meets Laurent, who has been transformed in the film version from a civil servant into an Italian truck driver, played by Raf Vallone. Again, Vallone seems capable of only a limited range of expression. Missing are the agonies experienced by the lovers following the murder, and Zola's lengthy dissection of them. What remains, then, is a stripped-down story, lacking great depth of character or profundity, but with enough intrigue and suspense to keep things moving until the unexpected ending.
However, it is unfair to compare, the film with Zola's novel. Carne's adaptation needs to be considered on its own merits. The treatment is excellent as one would expect from the director of Children of Paradise, once voted by French film critics as the best French film ever. Though Thrse Raquin comes nowhere near Carne's masterpiece, it is worth watching. Just don't expect a faithful adaptation of Zola's early work. Better to read the novel instead.",1278201600,6,1495,5.05668016194332
