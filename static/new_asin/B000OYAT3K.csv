8187830,4,B000OYAT3K,I have several of Kelly's videos.  Step is not her strongest format - but it's ok,1499904000,,81,4.0625
8187831,5,B000OYAT3K,All Kelly's videos are the best!  I wish she'd come out with a new one every month because I would buy each and every one!  Love this Step video.. good for cardio and toning.  Highly recommend.,1425254400,,193,4.305555555555555
8187832,2,B000OYAT3K,"I have 20 of Kelly's DVD's. I'd rate all but 2 of them 5 stars (or close.)  This one and Step-Boxing (2008 in the blue cover with the title running vertically down the right side) are the only ones I don't like.  They are long - not part of the 30 - Minutes series: this one 53 minutes, the other 70 minutes.  I find them boring, repetitive, harder and uninteresting. In general, Kelly's moves are inventive, new, different. That's what keeps me going. When they aren't, she still makes them fun and interesting, because of her upbeat and motivating style. She is definitely my #1 trainer. Gave up The Firm for Kelly, but these aren't creative. If you want step or step-boxing, I'd recommend either Step-Boxing (2007 in the orange cover with Kelly doing a kick), which is easier and good, and 30-Minutes Stepboxing  (2011 in the mustard-color cover - Kelly has ear phones on.)  I wish I'd known before buying the 2 above.",1407110400,5,921,4.591463414634147
8187833,4,B000OYAT3K,"I am an avid fitness buff, but haven't stepped in years. I came across a gym-quality step that was a bargain (from Amazon, actually) and bought it. I don't own step DVDs, so have been renting DVDs to find one I want to buy. This is the one. I first tried Kathy Kaehler, and the workout was really boring. I could keep up, but it seemed like it took forever. Then I tried Gay Gasper and Christi Taylor. Both had so much jumping and spinning I was literally getting dizzy trying to keep up. This Kelly Coffey-Meyer is my fourth.

The warm-up is actually a warm up, some side steps and quad pulls, enough to get moving, and it doesn't drag on. It quickly moves into the first routine which is with a vertical step. (Meaning the step isn't parallel to the TV but rather perpendicular to it...) There are some basic left, right moves and some familiar knee lifts and box steps. She does some jumping (both feet together jump from the floor up to the step), and some jumping on the step. The floor segments are very brief and relatively easy to follow. The second routine is with the step placed in the traditional way, and that routine is a little easier and also a little shorter. There are only a few times in either routine that there's any turning all the way around. I had a little trouble with the vertical step, in that I couldn't seem to mirror her movements. I was always ending up on the wrong end of the step or I had the wrong leg on the step. However, I've only done the workout twice, and I am glad that it will take a little time to learn it. (I am guessing that after 5 or 6 times I'll have it down fairly well.) It's not boring, and it's not so difficult that you have to be an aerobics instructor to follow it. I worked up a pretty decent sweat, which is always a good indicator to me that it's doing SOMETHING.

The only thing I would change about this would be the ability to mix it up a bit more (love the active rests idea), and I also would have liked some hand weights incorporated as I think they lend themselves to the step, but now that I've discovered this instructor, I see that she has plenty of other videos that do use hand weights. I like to have variety in my workouts and am glad to have found this series.",1307664000,5,2236,4.20979020979021
8187834,4,B000OYAT3K,The product was shipped fast and it is a great product love the video not to hard to follow if you have done step areobics before!,1243814400,2,130,4.038461538461538
8187835,5,B000OYAT3K,When I first played this DVD I was a step behind Kelly. But the more I worked on it I loved the challenge and the intensity. She makes me move! And I am there to work my heart and my muscles and she does a super job of getting me going. The workout seems to go quickly because I am watching the moves and it is fast paced. The core workout is very good.,1234310400,3,353,3.7837837837837838
8187836,2,B000OYAT3K,"Anyone who likes a very fast paced, highly choreographed routine should like this.  It is probably a good work out, if you can keep up.  The moves are changed to quickly.  You'll need to learn the routine before you can complete the workout.  Too much of a hassle for me.",1187827200,,271,4.36
