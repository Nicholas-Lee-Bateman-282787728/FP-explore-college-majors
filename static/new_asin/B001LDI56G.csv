3682839,5,B001LDI56G,"In Mr. Vanderveen's review, he complains that some of the conversations in ICE PEOPLE were staged, and that the filmmaker, Anne Aghion, had a particular point of view about those conversations. As a representative of the film, I would like to clarify that ICE PEOPLE is an experiential film--it's meant to give you the feeling of what it's really like to be working in science in the world's most remote and extreme environment. As such, it would have defeated the director's own intention, as well as that of the scientists, students and support staff who participated, to have staged any of the conversations between people appearing in this film. I'm sorry Mr. Vanderveen didn't enjoy the movie, but I wanted to make sure that the facts were correctly presented. (By the way, take a look at the ICE PEOPLE website for a slew of wonderful reviews from scientists, movie critics, students etc.)",1236211200,3,895,4.894736842105263
3682840,2,B001LDI56G,"Antarctica is a beautiful continent and one of the last few pristine places left on Earth.  The vast expanses of ice almost beg for any photographer to go there and convey the story of the continent to those who cannot experience it first-hand.

This movie follows a group of four geologists on their science trip to the continent.  The views are impressive indeed.  But, after ten minutes or so, it's like watching grass grow, or snow blow across the Minnesota Plains.  There is no explanation of what these geologists are doing in Antarctica (as an aside, the Dry Valleys, where these geologists are conducting their research, are not exactly representative of the continent - there's no ice there!).  We hear one of them talking about how scientists seek answers to questions.  That's fair enough, but having sat through the entire movie, I'm still not sure what the question was.  Sure, some general reference to ""Global Warming"" and its potential impacts, but how does finding a few fossil leaves fit into this?  And then we jump back and forth, it seems, from McMurdo to the remote Dry Valleys camp (note that nowhere in the movie is it mentioned that we're in the Dry Valleys), and to somewhere else.  Anyone who has not been there is by now likely to be lost.

And there's the students.  Two PhD scientists and two grad students participated in the trip.  We see the ""real"" scientists (mostly the younger one) dig enthusiastically and find the fossil leaves.  The grad students are relegated to walking around with what looked like GPS antennas - for what?  Maybe this is how this particular team operated, but it's hardly representative for US field programs where everyone, students and profs alike, have to pull their weight and contribute equally to the success of the field season.  Here, the students came across as excess baggage.

Ah, and the staged discussions are annoying, to say the least.  Maybe the team had some discussions about Science and Religion, but the few seconds in the movie were utterly unconvincing and came across as truly staged - including the senior prof scrubbing a pan while explaining his views on Science (true, of course) and Religion (the loser, of course).  And the Christian student seemed uncomfortable throughout the entire discussion.

None of the scientists, students, and support personnel are introduced throughout the movie.  At the end, there's a list of names ""in order of appearance"" - as if you can remember who came first after watching this for 77 minutes.

Maybe this is the way to present Science in Antarctica in a ""artistically correct"" way.  I found this movie utterly boring and I'm glad I didn't spend the few hundred bucks for the ""Educational"" version (allowing me to show this in class).  I certainly won't show this in class, or, for that matter, anywhere else.

You might want to consider the OSCAR-nominated ""Encounters at the End of the World"" instead.",1232928000,6,2926,4.886409736308316
8317828,2,B001LDI56G,"I watched this documentary as one of several I have seen in preparation for my own trip to Antarctica.  It is deadly dull and utterly inert.  I know it's supposed to be a poetic meditation, a mood piece, if you will, on the majesty of a very small, seldom seen part of Antarctica, the Dry Valleys, where there is no ice.  That is the one thing it has going for it, a chance to see the Dry Valleys, which I have not seen in any other documentary.  As such, the atypical landscape is interesting but lacks the grandeur of the icy rest of the continent. It should be noted that the photography is bright and crisp, and so is the sound.  The production values are high.  Which means we can fairly smell the grease in the unkempt scientists' hair when they are in close-up addressing the camera.

There is no script or narration, no beginning, it just starts.  We watch three men and a woman dig holes, sift dirt, stack gear, wander about, hold desultory conversations with long silent passages in between where we see nothing but tents standing in the wind or the ordinary stuff piled up inside them.  Poetic?  You decide.

The brief science discussions, when they happen, are on the high school level.  Scientists are extremely curious, we are told in the first discourse that a scientist shares on camera.  Really?  I didn't know.  There's talk between one of the profs and a grad student about science verses religion that is hardly groundbreaking.  From time to time (again in grungy close-up), they hold forth on their personal hygiene as they share a tent in the middle of nowhere.  TMI!

What are they trying to accomplish?  We're never told.  For that matter, who are they?  Anybody's guess, until their names are revealed, almost as an afterthought, in the end credits.  How long were they out there?  Who sent them?  What resulted from their findings?  Haven't a clue.  In a more personal vein, what do the two graduate students on the expedition intend to do with this training?  What are their hopes and dreams?  We never find out.  There is about 10 minutes' worth of actual content in this film, the most significant probably being the discovery of leaf fossils.  The rest is, ah, poetry,

Apparently the film is touted for its educational uses.  I can't imagine it holding students' interest.  Is it meant to discourage students from pursuing geology as a career when shown in schools?  We discover that research in the Antarctic is not glamorous, entails a lot of daily, monotonous grunt work, lacks creature comforts, appeals to people who enjoy the outdoors, and that individuals cooped up together in a tent day after day may have different opinions, run out of conversation, and must make an effort to get along.  Who knew?

Just setting up a camera on any old thing and letting it run is not compelling or evocative documentary film making.  I worked on my packing list for my trip while enduring this DOA film.

A YEAR IN THE ANTARCTIC is a far more lively and edifying look at what scientists and others do in the frozen south, as well as on the danger of global warming and the need to preserve the fragile polar environment.  In general it would be a far better choice for classroom use.",1450483200,,3208,4.620567375886525
8317829,3,B001LDI56G,"No grade inflation here: I liked this film, but caution that its portrait of Antarctica's Dry Valleys and the four geologists working there is not directed at adventure-seekers. Its pace is deliberate--one of the most intense sequences involves fossil leaf impressions--and the interviews sometimes drag a bit, but overall it effectively presents both the scientists at work and some seldom-filmed Antarctic geography.  Recommended!",1389657600,,432,5.857142857142857
8317830,2,B001LDI56G,"I sought out ""Ice People"" after having recently seen a couple of other similar-themed movies (more on that later), and was eagerly looking forward to seeing this.

""Ice People"" (2009 releae; 77 min.) brings a look at the life of a small group of scientists stationed in Antartica. Not that you would know strictly from watching the movie that this is Antarctica. Indeed, there is no introduction of any kind, no identification of the location or any other clue and it isn't until 30 min. into the documentary that one of the scientists actually utters the word Antarctica. If the goal of this documentary is to showcase the monotony of everyday life in Antartica, then it has succeeded at every level. At one point, one of the scientists comments: ""this is where we come together for breakfast and talk, of course there isn't much to talk about as we all do the same thing everyday and we spend all our time together"". We also witness the scientists digging into the grounds, I suppose for research. Not that you would know, as again there is no explanation, nor is there a narrator or voice-over to give the necessary background. Yes, at times the visual are great, but that happens only a few times in the movie.

In all, I can't help but feel very disappointed by this documentary, even more so when I compare it to those 2 other documentaries I saw not too long ago: first there is ""Chasing Ice"", a 5 star, MUST-SEE, documentary about the shocking changes in the ice mountains found on various spots around the word, with astonishing time-lapse photography that will have your jaw hit the floor. Then there is Werner Herzog's ""Encounters At the End of the World"", also on life in Antarctica, and while not a 5 star movie, still a mile or two better than ""Ice People"". I'd readily recommend either of them over ""Ice People"".",1370736000,,1827,4.635802469135802
8317831,4,B001LDI56G,"Beautifully shot documentary on the day-to-day life of a group of scientists in Antarctica. Very little in the way of narration, or an obvious organizing principal, this is more meditative, observational (and occasionally more meandering) than your usual documentary, But it somehow that style feels exactly right for the surrealistic majesty of the settings. Ms. Aghion is proving to be one of our more interesting and brave documentarians. (I'd urge those interested in documentaries to check out her series of 4 films about the aftermath of the genocide in Rwanda).",1343260800,,568,5.322222222222222
8317832,5,B001LDI56G,"This is a gorgeous movie. As soon as it starts, it brings you to an entire different world, that is mesmerizing, and really compelling. The pace of the movie really enables you to enter the world of these researchers, lost in the middle of nowhere, in the immensity of this iced world. I almost felt the cold under my skin!! You must watch it!",1335312000,,343,4.375
8317833,5,B001LDI56G,"The discovery by these geologists of evidence of a green Antarctica long ago begs the question, is that the normal Antarctica or is the frozen Antarctica the normal one? It points out the hubris of believing that current climatic conditions are just right and must not change. That we have perfection now and any change will be a disaster.

No one wants a dimunition of the quality of life on earth. People differ as to the long term effects, if any, and if effects occur whether they will be catastrophic. But the notion of no change being the utopian condition is silly. As this film points out, change has always occurred, even to the extraordinary extent of a green Antarctica.",1294963200,,681,4.675

8317835,5,B001LDI56G,I first watched this on Sundance Channel & knew I had to share this film with my friends that are science and exploration fans.  The documentary leaves you with mixed emotions on what it must be like to stay for months in one of the most remote locations on Earth.  It's an amazing journey with unexpected scientific discoveries.,1257552000,2,329,4.655172413793103
8317836,5,B001LDI56G,"This is an amazing look at the people who inhabit Antarctica today. These are modern day explorers venturing deep into the interior to conduct climate research, and also the men and women who keep McMurdo Base running.  An up close and intimate look at living and working in Antarctica. No penguins. Beautiful cinematography. Really amazing views that I have never scene before.

8317837,5,B001LDI56G,"This is a beautifully shot film, a must see in high-definition.  There is no over-dramatization or attempt to alter the reality of life of researchers in the world's toughest research facility--Antarctica.  The serendipitous discovery of the fossil by the small team of researchers captured in the film is a bonus (it later made big news, which indicated that the Polar region was much warmer than previously thought) If you appreciate the artistry of good film-making, this one is not to be missed.",1245715200,5,499,5.073170731707317
