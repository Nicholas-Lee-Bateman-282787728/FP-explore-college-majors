5579116,5,B00BCPOFQC,"First, great episodes!!! We have are slowing building up to our action pack moments on Enies Lobby!!!

If I have one major complaint about this DVD set it is that you only get eleven (11) episodes!.... It's a major let down and with such a high price.  Corp. business greed is really a sad thing....I really hope we go back to our thirteen (13) episodes. Not that even more than thirteen (13) episodes in the One Piece DVD would not be appreciated

But, One Piece will always be One Piece...and always worth watching.",1369267200,,517,4.537634408602151

5579118,5,B00BCPOFQC,"By now if you are looking at this product then I have to assume that the buyer or person reading this already knows about the exciting voyages of One Piece. Without too many spoilers, this DVD collection leaves nothing to be left out as you continue your exciting adventure in Water 7. This is a must buy for One Piece fans as the last episode on this DVD will make you wish there were more. For those of you who are new to One Piece or are looking for a present for someone who does enjoy this series, I shall give you a brief overview. One Piece is simply one of the better anime shows showing a more classic view on pirates versus the highly popular sci-fi pirate animes (although there is a ton of fantasy added to this show). Consider sitting down and watching it with people as Pirates of the Caribbean is not the only good pirate flick around.

Warning to all readers! Below will contain spoilers, if you wish to keep the contents of this DVDs adventures a secret then do not read below. If you do not care then have at it.

On a more specific note in this DVD collection Season 4, Voyage 5, Luffy and the gang pursue Robin and the mysterious group of CP9.  Now allied with the Franky Family and Galley-La, can the Straw Hat pirates rescue their friend from the grasp of CP9? Let the journey of the Enies Lobby arc begin!",1368921600,,1328,4.282868525896414
5579119,4,B00BCPOFQC,"With most of the Water Seven sub-plots resolved, Voyage Five continues with a brief story arc aboard the sea train in episodes 253-263.

Robin, Usopp and Franky have been captured by CP9 and Sanji has sneaked aboard the Puffing Tom to rescue them; meanwhile Luffy and the remaining Straw Hats discover a way to peruse their crew-mates, and find new allies in the Franky Family and Galley-La shipwrights. While the Puffing Tom group attempt to fight a train full of high ranking and exceptionally strong marines, their comrades race behind to catch up and join the fight. Despite the CP9 arc being a very emotionally intense arc (for a show like One Piece, at least), this Voyage provides some much appreciated comic relief. Even during a storyline like this, One Piece manages to seamlessly blend character drama, action and comedy. The Sanji vs Wanze fight could be taken dead seriously... if it weren't for the fact that Sanji's opponent uses ramen as his weapon of choice!
Usopp continues to be significantly developed as a character in this set, in a scene that both demonstrates his internal conflict between his own sense of inferiority but his desire to help his dear friends... and is also hands down one of, if not the, funniest scenes in the entire franchise. Usopp remains to be both the funniest, and for many the most identifiable, member of the Straw Hat Pirates. Franky too becomes more developed in these episodes, evolving from an anti-hero into a genuinely likeable character over the course of this Voyage. We also see more hints of Robin's past, but the revival of her backstory won't come for another few Voyages. The second team of characters get mostly action sequences this time, with admittedly not a great deal of plot advancement happening on their side after the first few episodes. We also get the an introduction to the single greatest super hero of all time. Ever.
However, this is the point where the pacing of the One Piece anim begins to slow right down, with extremely long recaps and practically entire repeated scenes (protip: cold openings are a great way to shamelessly recycle an entire scene). Episode 258 for example only has about 15 minutes of new material!

Video and audio are as per usual: 16:9 progressive video and either 5.1 English or 2.0 Japanese with English subtitles. The name ""Sogeking"" is used on the subtitles, whereas ""Sniper King"" is used in the dub, causing a naming inconsistency in automatic the sign-only subtitle for the dubbed version.
As for extras we get the usual:  a chatty and occasionally off-topic US cast commentary on episode 255 (ADR Director - Mike McFarland, Kokoro - Juli Erickson, Zambai - Doug Goodrich) and a more technical commentary on 263 (Mike McFarland, ADR engineer - Kenneth Thompson, Mix Engineer - Adrian Cook, Marketing Brand Manager - Josh Kocurek) which, in a nice change of pace, goes into details such as how the dub is recorded and marketed and how the 5.1 sound mix is created.
Plus there's 'One The Boat: Behind The Scenes Of One Piece' interviews with Chris Sabat (Zoro) [12:32] and Colleen Clickenbeard (Luffy) [13:26], hosted by Mike McFarland. These interviews contain very general comments but as a fan of the dub I do enjoy these interviews and I hope to see more of these extras on future releases. Plus, there's the usual marathon Play (which annoyingly does not skip recaps), textless opening and closing animations and trailers.

Voyage Five brings some comedy to the more drama based CP9 arc, and seamlessly bends this with it's fantastic action and truly engaging and unique ensemble of characters. Even if the pacing takes hit and this isn't the highlight of the CP9 saga, this is still a great collection of episodes from an expectational series.",1368835200,2,3759,4.887147335423197
5579120,5,B00BCPOFQC,"I have been a fan of the manga for almost 7 years now. This is easily my favorite anime as well and the reason i learned japanese. There has always been one mystery about the series that has perplexed me though. Where did sogeking come from, and where did ussopp disappear to?",1368489600,10,276,4.326923076923077

5579122,5,B00BCPOFQC,"This voyage concludes the intense Water 7 arc and marks the beginning of the EVEN MORE intense Enies Lobby arc.
As always, the voice work is top notch and Sonny Strait shines the most in this set.",1367280000,,196,4.324324324324325
5579123,4,B00BCPOFQC,"I know one guy who posts reviews here wants to wring my neck for my spoiler reviews, but I can't see what he can do to prevent me from doing so.

This voyage starts exactly where the last one left off.  Luffy and Zoro have been literally tossed halfway across Water 7 by Rob Lucci in his superpowered leopard form, with Luffy stuck between a couple of houses and Zoro stuck in a chimney.  Chopper has rescued Iceberg, Paulie, and Zoro's swords from the burning ruins of Iceberg's house.  Sanji is still following Robin's captors and is surprised to see Franky and Usopp captured as well.  And the winds from the Aqua Laguna grow ever stronger.  Luffy and Zoro manage to pull themselves loose (actually Zoro needs some help from Chopper) and they along with Nami meet with Kokoro (remember, the grinning old lady who drinks all the time) who unveils her high performance locomotive, the Rocketman (on the cover of the package and most likely a nod to the Elton John song) which will allow them to pursue the Sea Train with Robin on board.  As they get ready to pull away, they get some unexpected passengers.  The first group is the entire Franky Family along with a couple of huge beasts of burden named Sodom and Gomorrah (also on the package).  They, of course, know that Franky has been kidnapped and desperately want to get him back.  The second group are the three Galley La foremen (Paulie, Lulu, and Tilestone) who remain loyal to Iceberg and want revenge against CP9 for attacking their boss.  An alliance is forged these groups and Luffy and they begin their journey.

Meanwhile, Sanji has stowed away on the Sea Train and begins to fight his way past anyone who stands in his way.  His first opponent is a guy named Jerry who's at least 12 feet tall and has trouble manuevering inside a passenger car.  Sanji finds Franky and Usopp in the next car and frees them.  Usopp seems to run away but a masked man who calls himself the Sniper King arrives on the scene about a minute later.  Both Franky and Sanji know that the Sniper King is actually Usopp but they humor him by saying they don't know him.  Sanji proceeds to the next car to fight a fellow cook named Wanze who fights with noodles (seriously!).  Franky fights CP9's newest recruit, Nero, on top of the same car while Sniper King/Usopp sneaks ahead to the car Robin is in and tries to help her escape.  They nearly succeed in getting Robin to the rapidly approaching Rocketman, but Blueno (the CP9 guy who can create dimensional doors) takes both Robin and Franky back, leaving Luffy's alliance no choice but to follow CP9 to the heavily guarded island fortress, Enies Lobby.

Well, that about wraps up Season 4.  Stay tuned for the Enies Lobby arc that makes up most of Season 5 and is nearly 50 episodes of pure unadulturated action!",1364169600,2,2804,4.5568862275449105
5579124,4,B00BCPOFQC,Just a quick summary of what to expect with this purchase if you don't already know. The crew will be on this sea train for the majority of this box set and probably the next one as well but that doesnt mean the episodes aren't entertaining.
