7869568,5,6304399545,"Asuka moves into Misato's apartment and now must share cramped quarters with Shinji and Major Misato. Episode 9 shows the jealousy and antipathy Asuka holds for Shinji, just a baby in her eyes. The characters are all developed a bit more at this point. Episode 10 features the daring mission of recovering an Angel fetus inside a live volcano. This is a truly an exciting and enlightening video!",1011312000,,395,4.823529411764706
7869569,5,6304399545,"The series just gets better and better!  In episode 9, new EVA pilot Asuka has moved into Misato and Shinji's apartment, and things have gotten interesting.  A new Angel has managed to split itself into two, and Asuka and Shinji must learn to work together for a syncronized attack on the Angel!  But will they be able to stand each other long enough?  Then, in the 10th episode, an unborn Angel has been found deep inside a volcano, and Unit-02 has been sent in to retrieve the egg.  But it's not long before the egg begins to hatch!  These episodes bring viewers closer to Asuka, and also we see Shinji become a little more aggressive due to her arrival.  Great episodes!",982540800,,673,4.512396694214876
7869570,5,6304399545,"When I got this tape I didn't know what to expect but when I watched it, I was amazed. This tape is by far one of the best tapes in the series. It is perfect, the addition of Asuka makes the series even better then before. The battle scences were flawless and the character interaction is wonderful. Once again it blends humor,action,and science fiction perfectly. Its a great tape and must have for any Evangelion fan or any anime fan in general.",980640000,,447,4.463414634146342
7869571,5,6304399545,"When the Evas are forced to fight inside a volcano, what sort of  preventive measures are required? You'll find that out when you watch  volume 5, Magma Diver, because the pilots are faced with that situation.  Asuka in her bloated heat suit is a sight you won't want to miss. Much has  been said about the Evangelion series, but I'm just glad to be able to say  I've seen it.",962236800,,376,4.314285714285714
7869572,5,6304399545,"Episode 5 of the Evangelion is an exciting one. Nine, the first episode on the tape, has an expands Asuka's storyline.  In it Shinji and she must learn to battle in synch, so that they can beat the new angel which splits  in two.  We also get the first hints about Asuka's problems with her  mother.
  In episode 10 Asuka is sent on a mission to retrieve an Angel  egg from the inside of a volcanoe before it can hatch.  Unfortunately it  does start to hatch as she gets it, I won't spoil the ending, but both  episodes are pretty action-packed",961459200,2,544,4.297029702970297
7869573,5,6304399545,"With Asuka now attending the same school as Shinji and Rei things begin to get a lot more interesting. With the appearence of another Angel Shinji and Asuka are called back into action. Yet this angel possess the ability to  not only regenerate itself but to also clone itself. Now with commander  Ikari still gone Misato must lead a daring mission, the only thing worse  then fighting the Angel is haveing both Shinji and Asuka living in the same  apartment with her. In episode 10 Nerv detects the egg of an Angel deep  with in a volcano. The mission is for Asuka to take unit 2 into the valcano  and retrive the egg. Yet things turn ugly when the egg begin to hatch. This  volume has some of the best moments overall within the series. One example  would be seeing Asuka fall asleep next to Shinji and wisper in her sleep  ""Mother."" Another great scene in this volumee would be the final  combined assault by units 1 and 2 on the Angel in episode 9. The animation  is once again outstanding. The music is one of the best score I have heard  yet. The character interaction gives us more and more reason to both love  and hate the characters. Anime rarely gets any better than this.",960940800,2,1183,4.421296296296297
7869574,5,6304399545,"This is Great!  Of course... all of the Evangelion episodes are great.  In this ""Project Jet Alone"" goes awry as the giant robot attacks the city.  Misato then goes in to stop it.  Afterwards another Angel is  discovered, and the 2nd child in introduced, Asuka.  This is a great way to  bring in another character.",953510400,,314,4.6
7869575,4,6304399545,"In general Neon Genisis Evangelion has fullfilled most of my expactations. But compared to the Anime, the Manga contains more Drama and suspense. For instance, in the first  episode Shinji's reunion with his father has not  been as dramatic as in the Manga Version. But in exchange the gags shown,  were funnier, especially the development of Shinji and Asuka growing as a  team to defeat the invincible angel.",947116800,,410,4.985294117647059
