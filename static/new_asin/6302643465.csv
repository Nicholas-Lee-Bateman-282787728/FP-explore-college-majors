8226888,5,6302643465,"Wow.  Gun N' Roses have quickly become one of my favorite bands, if not the favorite.  I bought this video because I thought that it would be a cool thing to have even if it wasn't very good.  I'm pleasantly suprised that its a cool thing to own because its totally amazing.  Everything from Slash's amazing guitar playing to Axl's screeching voice.  If I had to find something wrong with it, I would have to say that absence of Izzy Stradlin, and the really short shorts that Axl wears.  That's it.  This video totally rocks, and so do Guns N' Roses.  I am really looking forward to experiencing Chinese Democracy.",995068800,,615,4.527272727272727
