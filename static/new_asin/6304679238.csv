904978,5,6304679238,IT IS A WONDERFUL FAMILY MOVIE AND IT KEEPS YOU INTERESTED IN WHATS TAKING PLACE.,1162512000,3,81,4.466666666666667
904979,3,6304679238,"I was hoping to show some Bart the Bear features publicly to local kids, and had to reject this movie due to potentially offensive material. Probably accurate to the times, but I know that some people would consider the use of the term 'Redskin' to be offensive, as well as little brother's comments that big brother, late returning home, might have been scalped. On the other hand, I think the film did make it clear that it was white Indian hunters who were doing most of the scalping.  The main Indian character is an old Sioux medicine man who speaks no English, but can communicate with the giant bear.  Less offensive, but still a bit of a stereotype.

Apart from that, the film was a fairly enjoyable wilderness picture, though not containing anything really exceptional apart from big ol' Bart. And it's nice that it didn't end with the kid having to hunt down the bear, as I first assumed when I read the film description.",1137542400,7,931,4.596385542168675
904980,5,6304679238,"This movie is in the same genre as the old Disney movies like Old Yeller, a movie the entire family can watch together.  Its about growing up.  Its hopeful, and can open up the doors for conversation, if just one person tries.  I've watched it with several family members who are not necessarily John Denver fans and they liked it.",1010966400,22,331,4.483333333333333
904981,3,6304679238,"If there's such a thing as a ""generic"" family-in-the-wilderness movie, this would be it. It's amiable, expertly done, with all the expected ingredients (yes, even a childbirth scene!). There's added interest, of course, in the fact that this was John Denver's last film (a fitting sendoff), and maybe the last project for narrator Bian Keith as well.",996883200,30,350,5.157894736842105
904982,3,6304679238,"""Walking Thunder"" is a well-meaning, occasionally entertaining movie about a New England family's efforts to survive in the West after their wagon is demolished by a huge grizzly.  The problem is that the movie, while clearly targeted at families, is at times disturbingly violent.  The scenery is beautiful (shot on location in Utah), the costumes are authentic, but the performances are wooden and everything about the movie screams low budget.  Many John Denver fans will purchase this movie for historical or sentimental value since it was his last film project.  However, he displays little of the charm that he displayed in his debut, ""Oh, God!""  If you watch this movie, watch it for the heartfelt performance of Klara Irene Miracle as Denver's long-suffering wife or the quiet dignity of Chief Ted Thin Elk.  The DVD features a host of extras;  unfortunately, they range from disappointing (the director's commentary sounds like it was recorded on a tapedeck) to embarrassing (the amateurish ""music video"" featuring the unknown ""Fresh""--does the world really need another boy band?).  The kids may enjoy this for one or two viewings;  after that, they will be requesting ""Pokemon"" again.",976665600,7,1195,5.214659685863874

905069,5,6304679238,This is another wonderful acting job that John Denver gave and no one would give him the credit that he should have had! The reason for that was he had a falling out with the one who had got him the movie Oh GOD! But he told John he was working on another movie and was NOT! So John fired him! It is very odd that after he fired this person he seemed to be black balled from acting. When he is great! Yes this looks like a b.movie but the mountains and where it was filmed was beautiful. Jessica Tandy said what she thought of his acting look it up.!Get this for a GREAT FAMILY movie!,1420675200,,584,4.0

905134,5,6304679238,"John Denver does a great job as a man whose leaving every thing he knows to live hopefully better is a great history lesson and a great movie that young boys and girls will watch in wonder.

905136,4,6304679238,"This film was made in late fall 1993, high in the mountains of Utah. I know this because I was there with Chief Ted Thin Elk, a full-blood Sicangu Brule Lakota from South Dakota. His first film was Thunderheart starring Val Kilmer.

This movie was made by a Mormon film studio. John Denver kept to himself, but had a private concert at the end of filming. He and Chief Thin Elk died the same year: 1997.  John was in his early 50's and Ted in his late 70's. The few times we shared the same car up to the site, John Denver was just how you think he would be.  Just a nice, average, regular guy.  He talked about his daughter Jesse and I talked about my daughter Jessie.  She was his whole world.

One of the 'Indian' actors turned out to be Japanese! We found this very amusing. However, it shouldn't have been as many American Indians originated in Asia. Many of the Lakota elders looked very much like the Tibetan actors in Kundun.

This was Ted's last film as he had recently suffered a heart attack before going to Utah to make the film. He made two films back-to-back that fall. We flew to Texas so he could film the final installment of North & South. He loved San Antonio, as did I. And we both fell in love with Utah and the beautiful mountains there.  South Dakota, where he was born and remained his entire life, is flat and grassy. Of course we spent time in the Black Hills (Paha Sapa) but they were a few hours drive from where we lived.

As film shoots go, this was a very casual, laid-back setting.  No egos, no diva fits. Everyone got along well. There was a rush to finish the film before the roads to and from the mountain (Mt. Timpanogos) were closed due to ice and snow. The day after we left the site and returned to Sandy, Utah, the snow and ice began. Perfect timing. While on the mountain, Moose, Deer, Beavers and other forest animals would wander near the set to take a look at what was going on.

In one scene, when Ted is praying in Lakota, the hills echoed with sounds of wolves howling! Everyone froze. The Park Ranger who was there said he had not heard these sounds in years.  They must have felt the Lakota prayers and answered in their own way.  This was filmed but I don't know if it made it to the final cut or not.  If so, when you hear the howling it is real.  It was a truly magical moment.  I took numerous photographs during the filming and have them on the walls of my NYC apartment.

I wish there were more family films like this.  I buy Shirley Temple movies for my grand daughter to watch. When she is older I will show her this one and tell her all about what happened behind-the-scenes that lovely fall in Utah.",1392422400,13,2658,4.240079365079365

905140,5,6304679238,"This movie was enjoyable. I like John Denver in anything where he gets the chance to be the ""hero"" type and show his tough side. It's an enjoyable family movie.

905211,5,6304679238,"I always enjoy watching this movie, no matter how often I see it, I really like it.  I like history, especially of the 1700-1800's.",1372896000,,131,4.458333333333333
905212,4,6304679238,"I enjoyed watching this movie, especially the beautiful nature scenes of mountains and forests, shot on location in Utah according to the credits, although the setting is supposed to be the Rockies. While John Denver is the most well-known star of the show, his performance is a bit wooden, but then that's understandable since he's primarily a singer and not an actor. He does a passable job of portraying the partriarch of a family stranded in the mountains by a broken wagon, courtesy of the rampages of a bear known as Walking Thunder, played so superbly by Bart the Bear, who virtually steals the show especially when he roars and swipes the air with his humongous paws. Other notable characters are the old Sioux medicine man and the friendly and helpful frontier man Abner Murdock, who saves the family's bacon more than once, and let's not forget the young boy Jacob McKay, whose transition into manhood is marked by several dramatic events in which he witnesses shootings and fights and childbirth, at the same time he learns the  important elements of survival in a harsh environment. Despite other reviews, I don't see any racial stereotyping in the portrayal of the Indian medicine man, and if there is, do not take offense in what he did in the movie, which was merely to commune with nature and heal as befit his calling.",1372636800,,1335,4.779220779220779

Shipping was super-fast with no damage to the video.

I would highly recommend this video for the young and old alike.

905216,5,6304679238,"This film was very nicely put together. Excellent acting, lovely scenery, good storyline, nice ending - all in all, a very decent family movie. There's a bit of violence when the bad gangs gang up on the good guys, but not too bad. The villains are not complete idiots, either. Always happy to see my old pal Bart the Bear. Has he gotten an Oscar yet?",1364169600,,351,4.333333333333333
905217,3,6304679238,"Walking Thunder is an okay movie.  It's family-friendly, with nothing really to complain about.  But it's also a little bland and forgettable, as much as I hate to say that. In fact, I saw this movie several years ago but forgot almost everything about it as far as plot details.  I'll admit that my only interest in it is because John Denver has a starring role, even if it wasn't his one of his best.

I couldn't believe it, though, when the opening credits started rolling and just about everyone who had anything to do with the film, including 'Bart the Bear' (the ursine actor who plays the part of ""Walking Thunder"", the grizzly bear in the movie"") was listed before JD!  Really?!

Again, this is an acceptable family film, but probably will mostly be of interest to fans of John Denver.",1354838400,,793,4.549295774647887

905219,2,6304679238,"I admit it: I bought the movie because of John Denver. I got to see him, so I guess I got my money's worth, even if poor John ends up looking a bit like the Simpsons' Ned Flanders, complete with mustache and glasses.

The film discription on the back of the box and quoted by Amazon had little to do with the actual movie. Young Jacob's family was NOT caught in a terrible blizzard - the axle on their covered wagon was broken by a grizzly bear. The only snow I saw was at a trader's camp, which, apparently was at a higher altitude than where the family built their new home, and there wasn't much snow at the camp. Jacob doesn't ""confront"" the grizzly, either, at least not in any way that is implied.

The movie itself was ok - nothing fantastic. It may be considered a ""coming of age"" type film, but certainly not in the same category as ""Old Yeller"" or ""The Yearling"".",1295395200,3,873,4.253012048192771

7875255,5,6304679238,"Very wholesome in the typical way of a 1980's film, and almost childishly unrealistic in places, but it has an earnestness that was very refreshing to watch at this time (Fall 2016).  We watched it as a family on this rainy Sunday afternoon and really did enjoy it.  I'm sure we'll watch it again from time to time.  John Denver was so well made up as the family man that he was hardly recognizable.  It seemed weird to see him so serious, and to not see that famous smile.  It shows his depth as an actor and not just a singer/song writer.  I especially loved the old Indian.  The mountain man didn't seem very authentic in the ""grizzled experienced mountain man"" sense, but he was likable, as were all the actors playing the family members.",1473552000,3,742,4.451851851851852
