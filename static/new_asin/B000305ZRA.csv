It reminds me of some others I've seen, especially in movies that aren't animes, where the main character only has a few clues as to where they come from and what their past is. This is partially one of THOSE movies - as is to be expected! But there's something more in Maiku and his ""sisters"" than meets the generalness of the plotline.

(By the way, that plot is:)
A guy name Maiku Kamishiro doesn't know his past but he has a clue: a photo. The photo is of two kids (brother and sister) in a pool in front of a house. He finds the house in the photo and moves there so it will be easier to find his twin and just when he gets settled in and living good, two different girls (Mina and Karen) show up claiming to be his twin sister. Since he has no clue which is really his real family, he lets them both live with him (not smart!) until things get sorted out and they can find out. He's got school and work and stuff to do - not let girls get in the way; especially since he may or may not be falling in love with one of them. It gets kinda crazy.

Filled with happy and sad, touching and embarassing moments, this is one anime that is surely going to keep you watching, if only to find out which of the annoying girls (personal opinion; not widespread!) is actually related to Maiku. You'll have fun finding out... I think.

If you liked Please Teacher (Onegai Sensei), then it's not very likely you'll enjoy Please Twins! I didn't really see the connection between the two, so if this is supposed to be a sequel, it fails! Meep. You may be looking for a fanserviced anime, in which case this one's good. It gets crazy, but it's worth a try!",1099353600,17,1694,4.158536585365853

8035484,5,B000305ZRA,"Maiku Kamishiro's past has always been somewhat of a mystery to him. The only clue he has to who is family might be is an old photograph showing two young children, a boy and a girl, playing in a small pool outside of a blue house. To find his family he moves to this blue house and beings working as a programmer.",1124841600,,314,4.080645161290323
8035485,5,B000305ZRA,"Today was the first day that I viewed please twins and I have got to say that it has a great story line. It starts with a boy named Maiku Kamishiro and how he is the main character in this crazy anime. Through out all of his life hes been left to an orphanage until one day he just decided to get out of there and start a life. Maiku has one place that he has always dreamed of getting away and now he has found a place of his own. The basic story was that he was left with a photo of himself and another child believing that there was another twin sister. Unfortunately he doesnt have any clues to whom the sister is until one day two girls named Miina Miyafuji and Karen Onodera show up. Both of them claim to be his long lost sister, but there seems to be a problem. Even though they both have the same eye color as Maiku there was only one other person in the photo. Both of the girls present Maiku with the same photo and all of them were in an orphanage until now. Maiku must now find a way unlock the secret and find out who the sister is and who the stranger is. This anime is definitly a must buy. It may not be a sequel to the series Please Teacher, but it has a good story line and I recommend this series to any fan that enjoys love, comedy, and relationship type movies. One more thing this is a 16+ anime and there is nudity in it.",1121731200,6,1345,3.9667896678966788
8035486,5,B000305ZRA,"This story starts with a teen named Maiku Kamishiro. Leading a hard and stressful life. One day 2 girls named Miina Miyafuji and Karen Onodera appear at the doorstep of Maiku's house. They both claimed to be Maiku's long lost sister, but there was a problem. They can only rely on a picture that they had, which showed Miaku and one of the girls at a young age. I thought the first part of this series was a great start!!!!!",1121731200,,424,4.3125
8035487,5,B000305ZRA,"Maiki Kamishio is an orphan, and only has a photograph of him and his twin sister as a clue to his family. One day, he sees a news report on TV and recognizes the town from the photograph. He visits that town, finding the house in the photo, which is now rundown, and decides to rent it and fix it up. Two months later, two girls show up on his doorstep, Miina and Karen, each with a copy of the very same photo. It seems that one of these girls is his twin sister, the other a stranger. He allows the two of them to move in.

Things get very interesting from there, that is to say, very hilarious, as both Miina and Karen start to have romantic feelings towards him. To make things even more interesting, there is an alien that visits them from time to time. And what about his teacher, is she an alien too? And his gay friend that is always coming on to him, the class president who is stalking him, and the clas vice-president who also has a crush on him...things get very interesting indeed",1106870400,3,994,4.204188481675392
8035488,5,B000305ZRA,"If you are someone who likes serious in-depth anime with a rigid story line and characters of immense background battling it out in robotic morphing suits....then this is by far not the anime for you.  But if you are the type of person that likes to kick back and watch something with a good storyline and cornball characters that you can either relate to, fall in love with, or just plain laugh at, then do yourself a favor and get every episode of Please Twins you can find.  I am the type of anime fan that likes things such as Azumanga Daioh, Love Hina, Excel Saga, Happy Lesson etc etc and I have to say that after watching the first DVD I was eagerly awaiting the second, and now the third.  Assuming that this was somehow connected with Please Teacher I went and purchased the entire series but have to say with all conviction that it is good, but the characters are not as easy to get immersed in as that of Please Twins.",1104796800,,929,4.327586206896552
8035489,5,B000305ZRA,"Maiku Kamishiro left the orphanage to move into the house he thinks he grew up in.  The house happens to be in a old photo of himself and his sister.

One day a couple of girls shows up, each with the same eye color and the same picture.  Miina Miyafuji believes she is that sister.  And so does Karen Onodera.

The four episodes are funny, yet touching, filled with new characters, fan service and old characters from Please Teacher!  With such voices as Sandy Fox, Sherry Lynn, Bridget Hoffman and Crispin Freeman I really felt I already knew many of the characters in the series.  Exctras include vocal clips, promo clips and, of course, previews.  100 minutes total, for 16 and up.

It was nice to see Tony Oliver as the ADR script writer and ADR director (being a voice actor means he should know what he is doing).",1104192000,,820,4.449664429530201
