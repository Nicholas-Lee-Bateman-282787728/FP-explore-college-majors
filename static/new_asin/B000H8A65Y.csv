2631050,5,B000H8A65Y,this is a very good movie but in some ways very decieving its about a doctor who they call the baby maker tells women who cant concieve a baby of there own that they pay him 20 dollars and that a unknown sperm donor would provide them fresh sperm. Little did they no the doctor was using his own sperm on all his patients some would concieve and some did not but he would also tell them they were pregnant even if they were not the woman that he does get pregnant find out later that all the woman that the doctor used his sperm on the kids all shared the lazy eye syndrome in which the doctor also had this movie is a must see of what did happen and could still be happening in the world today.,1341964800,2,695,4.0071942446043165

8137566,5,B000H8A65Y,"This movie was brilliantly cast and brilliantly acted.  The motivations of the women who desired the doctor's services were well presented.  The doctor's personality was disgustingly played down to his gleeful pocketing of the $20. bill provided for the fictitious anonymous sperm donor.  There is no room in this film for any sympathy for the doctor, but it is surprising how cold the female characters are portrayed.  I bought the DVD last year when there was a buzz about wealthy Americans paying poor surrogates in India to carry their children to term.  It was well worth the money and time to me.  I wish I had watched it sooner.

I am now against sperm donations, in vitro fertilization, surrogates, fertility treatments, and any other unnatural means of conception and birth.
