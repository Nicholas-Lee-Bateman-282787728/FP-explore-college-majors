8711348,1,B002QQ7MQG,"I decided to purchase this video based on the 5 reviews that were placed prior to mine.  All of them were 5 stars.  Wow!  This video must be great!  After wasting 53 minutes watching it, I can't help but think that the other 5 reviewers must be family of the filmmaker or on the staff of the studio ""CreateSpace"" that apparently released the video.  I don't want to be too personal in my criticism but I do feel somewhat duped by the reviews.  I lived in Alaska for 19 years and am very familiar with many of the places shown in the video so I do have the knowledge to form an opinion of how well they were covered.

Pros:
1. Alaska is very difficult to look bad on video and they did succeed in capturing it's beauty.

Cons:
1. The narration is lacking quite a bit.  It is obviously being read from a script.
2. Obviously made by an amateur. I am not saying that I could do any better but I am a semi-professional photographer so I would know to at least use a polarizer filter on the camera to cut down on the glare and increase contrast.
3. They did not cover any of the towns or cities.  As a former resident, I believe that the people and traditions of both the natives (American Indian/Eskimo) and non-natives are very interesting and worth seeing.  People don't just end up in Alaska like they might in Key West or California.  It takes a concerted effort by someone with a pioneering spirit to make it there and stay the duration which makes for some fascinating local customs.  In fact, not once did they even mention Anchorage, which is home to more than half of the states population and many interesting historical sites and museums.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that there is more to Alaska than just scenery and wildlife.
4. They mentioned getting within 20 feet of a brown bear on a tour but completely fail to mention that in reality, that is not a safe situation since bears are notoriously unpredictable.  Growing up, we'd hear stories almost every year about a tourist that got mauled by a bear because they got too close.
5. Not sure why they felt it necessary to spend 10-15 seconds focused on the gauges of the cockpit of the plane they were riding in or the captain of the tour boat they were on.
6. They discuss a few things that are really beautiful and/or interesting such as Mt. McKinley, the Homer Spit, etc. but don't go into any detail about how best to see them.
7. Not shot in HD or anything approaching it.

Summary.
All in all, I think the best way to sum up how I feel about this video is that it seems more like it was their ""Dream Trip to Alaska"" that they made a a home video of to show family and someone told them ""This video is great, you should try to sell it!"".  My wife and I really enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/America-s-Scenic-RV-Adventures-Alaska-RV-Adventure-of-a-Lifetime/dp/B003VJO3BO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">America's Scenic RV Adventures: Alaska, RV Adventure of a Lifetime</a>&nbsp;much more than this video.  It also was made by a non-professional filmmaker but the narration is much more natural and humorous.  Additionally, they covered in detail the towns and cities as well as how best to see some of the amazing sights in Alaska.",1367712000,,3251,4.642233856893543
8711349,5,B002QQ7MQG,I have been to Alaska (Kodiak & the interior) ten times. This video makes me want to back again! The inside passage this time.,1288396800,2,126,4.291666666666667
8711350,5,B002QQ7MQG,"This video is a delicious way to experience this gorgeous state from your own armchair. Fenno's impeccably clear, steady films bring out these scenes up close and personal. His colors and textures are vibrant, and his camera follows many different animals lovingly and precisely. I enjoyed everything from majestic, blue-colored glaciers to caribou annoyed by insects, to tiny, brand-new salmon eggs gleaming through a clear river. You can almost smell the clean air, and even feel the arrival of fall toward the end of the trip, as he and his wife return through yellowing leaves.
His narration is precise and informative, spoken from an obviously profound love and respect for these natural wonders. His summary gently offers a message of the importance of preserving our lands.",1266969600,2,780,5.198412698412699
8711351,5,B002QQ7MQG,"A trip to Alaska has been a dream of ours for a long time.  This video captures amazing images of wildlife and landscapes that reflect the inherent beauty of this unique part of the world.  It's become an inspiration for us to finally make our dream a reality.

  Also, I've just ordered another copy for a friend who's been to Alaska, but wasn't in a position to come away with the pictures she saw with her eyes and felt in her heart.  I think this video will do that for her and be the perfect memento of her trip.",1260489600,,517,4.171717171717172

The videography, music, and narration combine to make this a relaxing and educational viewing experience all wrapped up in one.  My family and I truly enjoyed watching this video together, and it definitely made us want to travel to Alaska at some point ourselves!  Thanks for sharing your trip and obvious love and respect for our natural wonders!",1260230400,,407,5.044776119402985
8711353,5,B002QQ7MQG,"Take advantage of a superbly produced Video and Narration!  If like us, you have never been to Alaska, you can enjoy it's grandeur through the Lens and Narration of Cliff Fenno in such a way that you will be convinced you are actually taking the trip with he and his wife.  The author obviously has a deep love and respect for the Wildlife and the Alaskan Wilderness that he so expertly captures on the video.  He narrates the Alaskan Scenic Wonders in such a personal, down to earth way that you cannot help but develop a great appreciation for what may well be the last of the North American Wilderness!  We believe this video can stimulate the interest and imagination of viewers of all ages.",1258675200,4,695,4.536
