7890881,5,6305512000,"O.k. To get right down to it I think this is the best movie ever! Their are some girls (rich girls) and they got a death threat so they have the police help them but they send them away thinkin' that the threat was a joke and they then have to fight the guys that are trying to kill them on their own when the guys start shooting at them and put bombs all over! Ok it may looklike a really sick Sexist movie but it's not they just dress that way there is no bad things like you know! Their is 1 swear word and 1 replacment for one! I am a big anime fan like DBZ, Pokemon, Sailormoon, Gundam Wing and anything else you can imagine. I like everything and this movie is no acception(even though it's only one movie they should have a sequel)*HINT HINT* Well, you should really get this movie if you love anime you will not be dissapointed. ( Just to tell ya, because amazon doesn't, that this movie is rated 12 and up -I kinda agree ) This movie is way better than 5 stars!",977788800,6,970,4.057291666666667
