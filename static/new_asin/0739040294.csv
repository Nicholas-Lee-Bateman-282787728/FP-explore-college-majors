7788302,2,0739040294,"To paraphrase an old joke, ""As far as video producers go, Carmine Appice is one of the best drummers I've ever seen.""

From strictly a video production point of view, this DVD is one of the most amateurish that I've ever bought. I realize that having a new video switcher is great, but honest to God, you don't have to use EVERY SINGLE ONE of the transitions. Put it this way... if this video only had star wipes, it would look quite a bit better. The audio during the live band segments was a lot more ""live"" than necessary, leading one to believe that Carmine also recently acquired a new reverb toy. Very disappointing to have his name associated with this, since he's a killer drummer. Love ya, Carmine... but stay behind the tubs, and away from the switcher, okay?

From a continuity/consistency point of view, this DVD is also a ""fail"". Some songs have a segment that shows Elliot playing these great solos in the context of a live band, and then letting you play along with the live band while Elliot plays rhythm. But not all. So what's the point of some but not all?

Okay, enough rant about the production. Elliot Easton is a terrific player, and has crafted some of the most memorable solos of the 70's and 80's. Would that this video went more into depth on them. All we get is Elliot playing the solo up to speed, and slowed down just a bit. I do like that he shares some of his thought process with us on some of the solos, but not all.

Another thing that's very interesting is that, to me, Elliot shines best when he's scripted out his solos in advance- y'know, studied for the test, done the math in advance. Every once in a while during the jam tunes, a little bit of that Easton magic shines through... but for the most part, I can see this level of playing at the open mic sessions at the local pub.

Please don't interpret this as me trashing Elliot, because I have such high respect for him as a player- but it's very revealing to see him out of his standard element. It makes me realize that we all have strengths and weaknesses in our individual styles (except for maybe Vai, Satch, and Morse... but they aren't from our planet anyway).

So in short (ooops, too late for that) I'd say ""pass"" on this one. Anybody wanna buy a used DVD?",1329955200,2,2258,4.364285714285714
7788303,1,0739040294,"He demonstrates very few songs, very few solos.  I was expecting him to show how to play solos to pretty much all the cars songs, but there are maybe 6, total, and only one that was a big hit (Best Friend's Girl).  Even there, he shows the solo, but doesn't show how to play the rockabilly rhythm figure.

I would avoid this DVD at all costs.  It was lazily done.  Not nearly enough effort put into it.  If they'd given half a damn, they could have shown how to play 30 or 40 solos.  They really half-assed this thing.  Avoid.",1323734400,4,526,4.19
7788304,2,0739040294,"This DVD goes through some pretty awesome solos, but unless your a fairly advanced player you'll find it difficult to understand. The PDF file that comes with it is useless just shows a few scales. No notation or tabulature is in included for the solos. I had high hopes to learn some of Elliots solos with this DVD. Again, I have nothing but the highest admiration for Elliot. But a useless DVD for the novice.",1179273600,6,411,4.493333333333333
