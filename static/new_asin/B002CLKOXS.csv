3906170,2,B002CLKOXS,"Ok I liked this romance film. I would not call it a comedy,more like a drama.
Anyway,I did not appreciate the preview on this DVD for the trashy, profanity-laced- ""Almost Heaven"" which even had the Lord's name in vain in the preview! I hope Hallmark has not ""sold out"" their standards.

 This film is nothing special. It definitely is not sugary sweet,and not really a passionate love here,but it's ok.",1260230400,13,402,4.728571428571429

3906176,5,B002CLKOXS,"Amen! Finally, a Christian movie that uses the Bible, says Jesus' Name many times, has a solid salvation message and reverence to Almighty God.
Well done and very moving! Need more Christian movies like this instead of these bubble gum, cotton candy and diet coke ""Christian films"". If you are going to make one do it right like this film!

A woman needs to be saved from a bad situation, so she goes out west as a mail order bride, pretending to be her friend. What she doesn't expect is to actually fall in love and be saved in the process. Overall, if you want a light hearted, make you feel good movie, you should watch this one.

3906230,1,B002CLKOXS,Worst Hallmark Movie I have ever seen! The characters say things and make comments that are very trashy and not consistent with the time period. The main female character has no morals and by the end of the movie the main male character just accepts her because he hasn't been with a woman in 3 years. There is no obvious change for the good in the characters and no lessons learned. I would not consider this family friendly,1446336000,7,425,4.461538461538462

3906276,1,B002CLKOXS,"I ordered this movie used and though the reviews weren't too good I decided to give it a try. It was horrible. There is no direction whatsoever, the characters aren't developed, the pacing is bad and the plot is nonexistent.

The acting is wooden which surprised me seeing how I expected more from Zuniga and Bancroft since they are decent actors. The best one in the movie was Greg Evidan. Daphne Zuniga was dry as a cracker and Cameron Bancroft was so bland he blended into the scenery.

One thing that's hard to believe is someone buying that Zuniga is a mail order bride. Usually they are very young and if Zuniga was trying to play anything under 45 then that's ridiculous. She didn't fit this part at all.

The romance. What romance? Bancroft and Zuniga have NO chemistry whatsoever. The scenes with them apart are boring but worse when these two get together. Nothing, nothing about this film was believable and the most interesting thing about this movie was the scenery.

I don't watch many Hallmark films but I can see why viewers didn't like this. If a movie is supposed to be a romance I'd at least expect some chemistry between the characters.

Skip this or learn the hard way yourself.",1349308800,12,1199,4.610328638497653
3906277,5,B002CLKOXS,"I really really liked this movie. I liked the characters, and I liked the content. The entire movie kept moving so I didn't get bored. The plot became evident almost immediately after getting into it. Interestingly enough, this was ""not"" the movie I thought I was getting, so I am really happy that I took a chance and watched it (more than once already). It was suspenseful and heartwarming at the same time. As the characters revealed themselves, I became even more interested to see what the outcome was going to be. It wasn't your typical western-type movie, and that's what made it even more intriguing. I loved the fact that you could almost sense beforehand, some of the actions that would occur, but you could not foresee all of them. That makes it a great and entertaining movie.",1343779200,13,788,4.676258992805756
3906278,2,B002CLKOXS,"3years is a long time.. This movie felt like 3 years long.

I found acting by the  lead actress to be lackluster and paled in comparison to the lead male who she is supposed to marry.  She seemed to be almost devoid of emotion(which for her occupation, in a way, seemed fitting.  Still, It all seemed a bit too modern for me to believe it is the time period of the old west.  The costumes and settings were the only thing reminiscient of the time period.

I haven't seen a Hallmark movie lately, but I seem to remember that this is kind of how they are, all the characters mostly reminiscient of others in their movies (lacking in much personality or substance).  although this one was more down-to-earth and not all lovey-dovey,  it was the same boring style.

Ha, one quote from the main character, ""I know that if I tried to live on principles, I would have died a long time ago,"" was totally unexpected, but true to the story and I'm sure applies to many ppl with life situations similar to hers.  This seems like the opposite of what most Hallmark movies stand for, but  basically sums up this one.

Every time a chance for engaging/emotional/substantial conversation comes up between the couple, the scene is cut short, rather annoying, and basically any connection to the characters has to be imagined.

Became monotonous and horribly predictable about halfway thru but I grudgingly--and painstakingly- finished it.

There is a great scene at the end and the overall message of not being hung up on money is positive--but it just drug on...",1317081600,24,1547,4.660516605166052
3906279,2,B002CLKOXS,"Let's see...profanity, including the Lord's name in vain is used throughout the movie.  The main character is very deceptive to everyone and should not be accepted.  Her catholic priest brother accepts money she gives to the church, knowing this money was not earned honestly.  He forgives her her sins, knowing she wasn't going to change her ways.  Then there is sex outside of marriage between the two main characters...

I was very disappointed in this Hallmark movie!  Most of their movies are very good and can be viewed by the whole family, but not this one!!!

Not only that, but there was no surprise.  I could see everything coming from a mile away....It all seemed to be two kids playing Cowboys and Indians or something...

THE CHARACTERS ARE NOT WELL DEVELOPED AND THE LOVE STORY FEELS FORCE. IT SEEMS US VIEWERS ARE JUST SUPPOSE TO TAKE THE FACT THEY FELL IN LOVE BECAUSE IT WAS THE POINT OF THE STORY, NO DEVELOPING EMOTIONS OR RELATIONS.

3906285,1,B002CLKOXS,"Really disappointed with Hallmark and for the talented actors that were in this movie.

First, of all there's several explicit scenes that aren't normal for Hallmark quality movies.

Second, the story line isn't that good...The movie was made in a great location it's too bad there wasn't more emphasis on the main character saving his land and developing the movie out from that part of the story rather than just mostly putting the focus on the bride and how she was a theif and on the run from her ex-boss that was looking for her.

Third, the language is a put off to me maybe it's tame for most movie watchers but again it's not what you come to expect if you've watched and loved Hallmark movies for years.",1265500800,30,712,4.503875968992248
3906286,2,B002CLKOXS,"I rarely give ""bad"" reviews, but this is one situation where I agree with the other reviews that this movie isn't a very good one. I, too, have enjoyed most of the Hallmark movies. This one, however, is an exception. My husband and I got through almost a half hour of it before turning it off. The plot was strange, and I, too, found myself not caring about the characters. The language, including the Lord's name in vain was also a turn-off, as was the personality of the main characters. Fortunately I just rented this DVD and didn't waste the money to buy it. If you want to watch a good movie, check out ""The Christmas Card"" or ""Clancy.""",1260230400,35,641,4.394957983193278

8364133,1,B002CLKOXS,"I thought I was safe with Hallmark movies. This one is very disappointing. It has too many bar scenes. Premarital sex, and a lot of gun-slinging. No virtue. I wouldnt give a star at all if that were possible.",1517011200,,208,4.358974358974359
