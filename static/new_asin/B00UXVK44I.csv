7071773,1,B00UXVK44I,"This series is fan service at its worst.  Don't be fooled by the good reviews, this is a cash grab.  I respect that most of the actors reprise their roles and do a splendid job, but the replacement actors stick out horribly;  this is especially true since the replaced actors were some of the more memorable in the game.  As others have pointed out this series is meant to be watched by fans of the game, but that doesn't excuse the many issues. The problem is the goal here is fan service so they try to jam as much in as they possibly can without a coherent plot.  You need the plot from the games to follow this even remotely and even armed with that I found myself puzzled.  Random stuff and fights happen far too fast and frequently, with the plot elements meant to bind these events together missing or removed in order to jam as many characters in it as possible.  It doesn't elaborate on parts of the plot, rather it rushes through them to get to everything.  It doesn't show different sides or angles really, there is no retelling of anything.  There is little to no character introduction for anyone and instead their appearances seem to just be so people can witness their favorite characters.  Complex characters have all of their dynamic elements stripped away due to the constraint of trying to cover so much in so little time which truly ruins the characters.  The problem I have with this all is if you look at this anime at face value, it has none.  If you did play the game then you couldn't possibly enjoy this because you'll be well aware of what is missing and left out in order to jam in all the characters, but if you're familiar with the game you can't enjoy it because it only touches on the characters and their plots rather than explaining any of them. What I'm left wondering is if terrible for those not familiar with the game and barely any better for those who are, than what is the point?

The part about all of this that is the most unfortunate is that this didn't have to be so bad.  If they'd made the series longer and slowed down the pace, than they might of been able to fit in everything they wanted to only in a proper way that allowed for enjoyment of the elements and characters.  Another option would of been to cut stuff out, remove some characters or plotlines in order to focus better on some.

The resulting show is unfortunately terrible and I can only assume that rather than try to make a piece of art that could of stood alone, they opted for the cash grab which is neither satisfying or worth anyone's time.  Avoid at all costs.",1438128000,8,2580,4.38655462184874
7071774,4,B00UXVK44I,"Ever since I first played Blazblue: Calamity Trigger back in 2009, I knew it was only a matter of time before this series gets an anime adaptation. Now finally after 6 years and multiple videogame sequels, we get just that with the U.S. release of Alter Memory. And for the most part, I was quite pleased.

First and foremost though, this anime is most definitely tailored towards the fan of the series. Newcomers who have never played Calamity Trigger and especially Continuum Shift will be confused for the most part in regards to understanding the plot and lore of the series. What is ars magus? Whats the backstory behind the NOL and Sector Seven? Why is there a talking bipedal cat? None of that is explained in Alter Memory. Fortunately, the two games I have mentioned do a great job of going over in detail the series' surprisingly deep lore and both can be bought dirt cheap now, provided you have a PS3 or Xbox 360.

Now what about people already familiar with the series? As I said, I enjoyed it and its about what I expected from an adaptation. The animation is solid but a few of the fight scenes do look a bit rough and sloppy. The voice work is excellent and having almost everyone reprise their roles for their respective characters is a huge plus, especially since they all done a stellar job in the videogames. All the characters make an appearance but some definitely get sidelined hard, which is understandable considering this series is only 12 episodes long. I should also mention that the first two episodes are devoted to Calamity Trigger while the rest covers Continuum Shift.

I was very disappointed by the lack of special features. A blooper reel would have been outstanding since I figured the voice actors had a lot of fun with this project. A behind the scenes video would have added a lot as well. This release is about as bare bones as it gets providing only the textless opening and closing songs and a couple trailers. Woo...

Underwhelming blu-ray release aside, if you're a fan of the series then by all means check it out. Blazblue as an anime has lots of potential that I'd like to see more of. Newcomers should be wary of this purchase and at least play through the first two games beforehand to get the most enjoyment out of this.",1437868800,2,2270,4.583743842364532

7071776,5,B00UXVK44I,"The Anime takes place and combined with the two video games of it .this is a great Anime those who haven't played the video game but it shows this in a whole different way there are some funny scenes in there I'm not going to explain the whole Thing and ruin it for people. The cast of the videogame are all going to be on the movie except for a couple of the characters. I hope the next season comes out or they're making another one soon the anime was great I hope this helps some people get into the anime, if they haven't heard of the videogame of it the video game is pretty good as well",1432080000,9,592,4.02542372881356

8708648,5,B00UXVK44I,"Great anime for Blazblue fans. Even though not like in depth like the game counterpart, this anime keeps things short and to the point of what Ragna the Bloodedge should do even he can be an idiot. XD",1495411200,,200,4.2894736842105265
8708649,5,B00UXVK44I,"- Synopsis: A story about Ragna the Bloodedge. Generally known as a villain that delivers death and destruction in his path; nobody knows what his real intentions are. Due to his unique powers, and his moniker: The Grim Reaper, he easily becomes the center of attention as everybody is hunting him down. As Ragna sets out on his long journey of revenge, whether he likes it or not, his actions will help determine the fate of the world that everyone lives in.

- Comments: This basically has the first episode take the place of Calamity Trigger's true ending route. The rest is an overview of Continuum Shift. So it is a bit rushed.

The aesthetics and soundtrack the series offers is great. Characters may be cliche at times (but there's so many animes so it's hard not to be), but they are still pretty cool. The Japanese and English dubs are great, though I prefer the English VAs since they are excellent. Just like in Persona 3 and 4, or Bleach or Naruto's English Dub. Plenty of well-known VAs.

Too bad some of the characters didn't really get much backstory in the anime. I'm sure those that haven't played the games probably are confused throughout. I don't blame you. Unless you know the true ending routes for the BlazBlue games: CT, CS, CP (Chrono Phantasma), and finally, CF (Central Fiction), you will be left in the dark. Welcome to Ragna's world.

As such, I recommend this anime more for players familiar with the BlazBlue universe, but if you are a new-comer or don't know anything about BlazBlue and this caught your interest, then hopefully you might try out the games, too. Still, it's not a bad option to relax and watch this anime or add it to your anime collection.

- Analysis: The BlazBlue universe is an immensely vast and convoluted one. To many people, ambiguity is a serious flaw. For animes or games like this, I would say it's actually a good thing. Sometimes, rather than having an answer, it's more fun using imagination to fill in the blanks (like in Steins;Gate or Chaos;Head). After all, predictability tends to be boring.

In other words, I think Mori intentionally made the series very cryptic. Like most of the characters' ages. Then again, I think it's so it doesn't distract many viewers since hearing or knowing their age can turn them off.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 12 episodes on 2 Blu-rays, and 12 on 2 DVDs with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-14 for violence and some fan-service.

8708654,1,B00UXVK44I,"The game was way much satisfying, but the anime was terrible though. From information dump to plot lines that sprayed on you from a barrel of a shotgun, and it was a no go. This one just tried to do so much and in the end failed to deliver. Art and dubbing were good, but not great. Fight scenes were at par at the most, but plot wise and execution of the dialogue was way too frustrating. To add to the disappointment, there was no conclusion and just makes you confused in the end to as to what happened through all of that, then resulted to just nothing. Plain nothing.",1440892800,2,572,4.209090909090909
