8565740,3,B00BC1UPNS,"This DVD gives you very little information, especially historical on the lighthouses it presents. Some are lovingly shown and others flash through too rapidly.

 The film is 60 minutes long and can be played with just background music and the cover says natural sounds, but usually the music overwhelms that. The other choice is narration, but that is very cursory.  Many times the lighthouse and their title goes by without a word during the narration.  The narrator tells the size and focus of the light but as for any background that is lacking for those who were hoping to learn more.

This is nice for atmosphere, and the pictures/film is lovely but in other respects the story of these lighthouses is sadly lacking.",1394323200,,721,4.829268292682927
8565741,5,B00BC1UPNS,"Great video. As stated in another review, there are two modes you can watch the video: First, with music in the background, and second, with narration.

Beautifully shot, there is a nice cross-selection of lighthouses from both the East and West Coast. The music really adds to the peaceful feeling one gets while watching, while not being overbearing. Also, another great feature is how it plays in a loop, so be careful, since you will be surprised how fast the time passes while watching as you find yourself in an ever-increasingly relaxed state.

IF, and I say IF there are two things that could use some improvement, it is this: First, according to the box, this video was shot in HD, but for the life of me all I can find this video is in the standard DVD format, not Blu-Ray. The box states that there IS a Blu-Ray version of this disk, but a quick Google search turned up NOTHING. So what gives??!? I REALLY would like to see this in Blu-Ray format!!

Finally, and again, minor issue here - some of the transitions between the lighthouses are really HARD cuts, very abrupt. There were two instances where a unique light house came up in a single shot for about 2 seconds, and then off to another. A little strange and disruptive to the overall tempo. But again, something I can overlook, if need be.

If you love lighthouses, beautiful scenery with a nice musical background, and need to peel off a few layers of stress, this might be the video for you.

Isn't that worth the price of a couple of Starbucks Lattes???",1390608000,,1525,4.530909090909091
