3622648,5,B001H29F2O,Great product.  Has a very great segment on the battle of the bulge.  I had never seen this before I ordered this dvd.,1347926400,,118,4.086956521739131
3622649,5,B001H29F2O,"This DVD purchased last year for a friend of the family.  He is 13 and Jim Cantore from the Weather Channel is his idol.

The DVD set arrived in perfect condition to us, and went over better than anything else he received.  He enjoyed watching the series on television, and then was able to watch it over and over (and over) again.

Excellent price and a quality item.

Perfect gift for your hard to buy for weather buff.",1346457600,,421,4.346153846153846

3622651,5,B001H29F2O,"Really like the way the stories were told. Great narrator. Surprising how dramatic changes in history developed because of weather. Sometimes your left with the question, was it just a coincidence or an a outside force.",1239753600,8,219,5.111111111111111
8307711,3,B001H29F2O,"These are neat, but I was expecting both seasons. It only showed a few between the 2 seasons. I didn't know ahead of time because there wasn't any information about the seasons on the description...not even on the case.",1505865600,,219,4.641025641025641
8307712,3,B001H29F2O,"Who picked these episodes?!  There were much better episodes than some of those included.  And two of them involved very little changes in history, while some of those omitted made significant changes in history.",1476662400,,212,5.205882352941177

8307715,3,B001H29F2O,"Would like to have seen included.. George Washington , the dust bowl ,  super outbreak,  The Hindenburg . There were several more good ones than some chosen.",1399507200,,157,4.777777777777778
8307716,4,B001H29F2O,"I like that these aren't all about one subject. There's a variety and I'm sure you've heard about all of them. Seeing the details about what happened and how weather played a part in it all was great. I just wish that after every deleted ""commercial"" slot, I didn't have to listen to a recap of what I just watched. But that seems to be the way all TV programs are today. Always worried about the nitwit that didn't bother to tune in from the beginning. See it, yes. Buy it, I'll leave that decision up to you. My favorite in natural disaster DVDs is still ""MAYDAY!""",1393286400,,566,4.299065420560748
8307717,5,B001H29F2O,I love watching the Weather Channel's shows about how the weather affects our lives.  Like the Storm of the Century and the Edmond Fitzgerald.  This set of videos had a lot of things I had not heard before.  It is great.,1392681600,,220,4.317073170731708
8307718,4,B001H29F2O,"The show itself is a five star show, however I mistakenly thought that this set contained all the episodes, but it only contains a select few.  It contains: Rescue from the South Pole, Battle of the Bulge, Challenger, Race to Nome, 1927 Mississippi Flood, Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers, Air Florida, Crash of Delta 191, Operation Eagle Claw and 4 bonus episodes of storm stories (Navy Typhoon, The Forgotten Hurricane, D Day Anniversary, Battlefield Iraq).  I'm disappointed that it contains only those select few and not some of my favorites including The Great Chicago Fire and The Dust Bowl.",1390176000,11,592,5.030612244897959
8307719,5,B001H29F2O,"I purchased this film for one reason, it contained the only known info about Operation Eagle Claw (Failed Iranian hostage rescue mission) on DVD I could find. Very informative with expert narration from the people involved and meteorologists. Nice to watch if there's nothing on TV or a rainy day.",1389052800,,297,4.96
8307720,5,B001H29F2O,"This program was fantastically presented; good visuals, solid storytelling, and a captivating experience overall. My family has already rewatched favorite episodes. I can't wait to find more like it!",1388620800,,199,5.896551724137931
