734222,5,6303922376,I have been looking for this movie for many years. I knew Kathryn Grayson was the singer but the movie name escaped me until I went through your list of movies on this singer. This has allowed me the option of looking up on past actors and actresses that I have grown up watching as a young child and also buying more movies of the past.,1352764800,,337,4.121212121212121
734223,1,6303922376,I was more than happy to order this movie (along with 3 others) as they have been long time favorites.  Unfortunately they negelected to let the buyer know that these movies are recorded so they will not play on a DVD/VCR Combo player.  They can be played on my PC or visit a friend and play them on a regular DVD player.,1308528000,,321,4.161290322580645
734224,4,6303922376,"SO THIS IS LOVE is really a semi-biography of Grace Moore, who was killed in a plane crash at the height of her career. It deals only with the earlier years of Miss Moore's life to show the determination and grace that led to her singing career, up until her New York City debut at the Metropolitan Opera House in ""La Boheme.""

It gives KATHRYN GRAYSON a chance to sing a variety of songs in coloratura style, but since the story does not cover Miss Moore's Hollywood career at all, many of her most well-known songs had to be omitted. Instead, we get a sprinkling of a few opera numbers and many other pop standards, all of them suitable for Grayson's voice. She's in fine form vocally and delivers all of the songs with her customary charm and grace.

MERV GRIFFIN, before his celebrity and TV fame, makes his second appearance in a movie as one of Miss Moore's admirers and gets to warble ""I Kiss Your Hand Madame"" while doing a nice job on the vocals. WALTER ABEL and ANN DORAN play Grayson's parents, not at all thrilled that she wants to leave her small town life for a fling at stardom in the big city.

Grayson has a role that is tailor-made for her own background as a singer. DOUGLAS DICK is rather colorless as another disappointed suitor who can't compete with her operatic ambitions, but FORTUNIO BONANOVA is excellent as a sympathetic voice coach who makes sure that she takes proper care of her throat condition before returning to him for his coaching. The story simply ends at the point of her first great success as Mimi in ""La Boheme"" at the Met.

Final verdict: Opera fans should enjoy this tribute to Miss Moore, and fans of Miss Grayson should appreciate the care taken to photograph her in beautiful close-ups while she takes aim at arias by Gounod and Puccini in good voice.",1275004800,8,1798,4.506134969325154
734225,3,6303922376,"I guess if you're a Grayson fan this movie is pretty good.  But I can't stand her quavery voice.  If you really want to know about Grace Moore, get HER movies....When You're in Love (with Cary Grant), New Moon with Tibbett, and The King Steps Out.  I have all of them and I consider these 3 the best.  There are clips from these on Youtube.

Moore spent 8 years on broadway before opera.  Her 'Minnie the Moocher' version shows her incredible ability with both genres.",1250640000,4,468,4.447058823529412
734226,4,6303922376,"So this is Love, which depicts the early career of Grace Moore, gives Kathryn Grayson an opportuity to demonstrate her skills for all types of music: arias, classics, showtunes, and popular. Her stunning beauty, glorious voice, and captivating charm in this and her many other films clearly established her as  the reigning diva of Hollywoood's golden era.  However, the script, as in most or Grayson's other movies, does not give her much of a chance to to use her considerable acting skills which she displayed with great success in her later  TV, theater, and operatic performances. Overall, I give this film 4 stars but Grayson rates 5 stars! Putting this film on DVD was long overdue!",1249776000,11,689,4.922413793103448

734228,4,6303922376,Although Grace Moore's true story is much more interesting than this movie the music alone would make me rent or buy this film. Grace was born in a small valley in the hills of Tennessee and became one of the most famous women in her time. It's too bad Columbia doesn't release all her films on video so that people can see and hear this true talent. This movie is famous for being the only film that had Merv Griffen as a romantic lead and featured the first open mouthed kiss on film (according to Griffen). There is also a great dance sequence in this film. Grace Moore was voted one of the 10 most beautiful women by Flo Zeigfeld and the lovely Kathryn Grayson does a superb job of showing Grace's beauty and determination at a time when women were not truly valued. I bought this movie and even gave one to a friend that loves musicals.,991699200,28,841,4.329113924050633

7856144,5,6303922376,Saw this movie in 1953 and thought Kathryn Grayson was a beautiful woman with a heavenly voice.  This was my introduction to her.  I have watched So This Is Love many times over the years.  It always brings back such nice memories.,1412553600,,231,4.4523809523809526

7856147,3,6303922376,I loved Kathryn Grayson in the part of Grace Moore (I have some of her films and she was very good). This was based on Moore's autobiography and it is filled with a lot of very funny times in her life. Seeing Merv Griffin as a young man was an eye opener. The music is great and well performed. Walter Abel as the father was really great in his scenes. If you like music from the first part of the 20th century you will like this.,1399680000,2,430,4.011627906976744
7856148,5,6303922376,"This is a film I first came across as a young boy, on Million Dollar Movie, where I could watch it repeatedly, for a week at a time.  I fell in love with Kathryn's beautiful operatic voice, and although I don't know Grace Moore and never saw anything of her performances (which I'm told are available on video), I hope the film does her justice in portraying her determination to become an opera star.
After only seeing the film on television, with time constraints and commercials, it was wonderful to see the film in its entiretly, in  a beautiful print.
My only criticism is how Kathryn is overly made up when she plays a high-school senior at graduation; she looks more like 30 with heavily made up eyes and lipstick.  Supporting roles are all perfect, but not enough credit goes to Rosemary DeCamp as Grace's supportive aunt.
The final scene at the Metropolitan Opera is where Kathryn really shines, performing as Mimi in La Boheme; it gives me goosebumps every time I hear her perform Mi Chiamano Mimi.
I highly recommend this opera lovers, and Kathryn Grayson fans.",1367452800,2,1072,4.691489361702128
