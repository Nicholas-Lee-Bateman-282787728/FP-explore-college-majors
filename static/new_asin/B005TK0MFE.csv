4891638,1,B005TK0MFE,"Just going to say ""I'm glad I only paid 6.00 for this dvd.""
and if I could return it after it was opened I would!",1326240000,7,113,3.56
4891639,4,B005TK0MFE,"Exotic looking Victor Webster has assumed the title role taking over in a mostly deadpan fashion. The Akkadian king has fallen from grace and is now on a quest from King Horus (Ron Perlman in a minor role) to go after his rival brother Talus (Billy Zane). Talus is on the march against Horus' ally in the eastern kingdom (India) in order to obtain the ""Book of the Dead.""

Webster is forced to work with the oafish Olaf (Bostin Christopher) from northern Germania. He has a wife Olga and 17 daughters. There are many stereotypes and if I started in on how this film is an anachronistic and  historical nightmare, I would be writing a tome after the first 10 minutes. The movie takes on the aspect of a ""B"" comedy by adapting modern sayings to its age. For instance, a prisoner gets his ear ripped off by Talus who then holds the ear to his mouth and says, ""Might you hear me now?""

The movie is dotted with this type of humor.

Dave Bautista plays Argomael the head of the Indian group. They also speak English but with an accent unlike the Akkadians, Egyptians (?), and the frequently belching Olaf. There is a fourth party in this...a person named ""Cobra."" Krystal Vee, a trained Thai kick boxer, plays the princess who must be rescued. Lex de Groot, who plays a messenger, is also listed as Billy Zane's stunt double, although I couldn't tell when he needed one.

There is a quest within a quest, an oriental harem, a blond Japanese warrior, and ninja style warriors complete with cg ninja action. Billy Zane was excellent as the bad guy. The movie works when it is a ""B"" comedy. The serious scenes highlight the bad script and acting. Some of the fight scenes had me scratching my head such as when fighters ""ride"" elephant tusks to propel them 2-3 feet in the air across the span of 5 feet. They had to slow-mo the scene to make it look effective. It might have been better deleted. The movie was intended for a younger audience. If you keep your expectations low, view the movie within its context, and simply want an enjoyable film without it being an epic or requiring a lot of thinking, then this would be a worthwhile teen rental.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Use of ""P"" word. Urination. Krystal Vee showing off leg and midriff. Good movie for Billy Zane fans.",1325980800,11,2270,4.4842615012106535
4891640,2,B005TK0MFE,"""Your mission is to defeat my brother.""  Mathayus's (Webster) kingdom has fallen and his wife has died.  He is now an assassin that is hired by King Horus (Perlman) to stop the rise of his brother and the army of ghost warriors.  I have to start off by saying that I didn't really like the original.  To me it was very cheesy and over the top and more of a comedy then an action movie.  After watching 2 & 3 the first one looks like an Oscar winner.  This review will be short because it was a struggle to make it through and I did end up falling asleep a few times and I think I missed some important stuff, but I didn't care enough to rewind it.  If you like the others you will like this one.  If you didn't then I would avoid it.  Overall, a movie for fans of the series only.  I give it a D+.",1325030400,9,797,3.925
4891641,2,B005TK0MFE,This DVD is in pre-order status and is priced like our fuel.  A DVD at $25.49 (blu-ray is $.50 cheaper) will certainly stop me from purchasing it.  May I suggest no one pre-order this movie until the studio (Universal) drops the price?  Avatar (20th Century Fox) got away with a blu-ray release in a bare bones edition which included NO special features.  A first for blu-ray that I have noticed.

4891711,1,B005TK0MFE,"ok first off, Why does Mathias the Scorpian King not remember that he was an AWESOME KING???????
in this movie he is just some mercenary for hire or whatever and he can barely tie up with a big fat guy who drinks all the time.....where as the first movie the Rock easily beat people 3 times bigger...
....
Then in the middle of the movie someone mentions that mathias is the actual Scorpian King and what does he have to say about it???? absolutely nothing, he walks away and never mentions it at all...so it is totally unclear if Mathias even remembers that he is the Scorpian King, it is as if his memory was wiped clean and he is starting over now or something which it totally stupid if that was their intention for this money.....
I can not see this as part of the scorpion king series of movies, it makes no sense to be...
.....
At least in the 2nd movie they had him when he was a kid so you can't really complain about to much about story's not adding up... but this one was horrible, not worth renting not worth spending more then $2 on...I watched it for free on Netflix and still hated it! doesn't get much worse then that....
it just looks like they did not even try to make this good, they just wrote down on paper the first things that came to their minds, left out ALOT of details people need to know to understand the movie.....
overall I can't believe I wasted my time trying to understand this confusing movie!!!",1402531200,,1430,4.3

But this sequel of said original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/prequel/dp/B00005JKYX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">prequel</a>&nbsp;has no redeeming value whatsoever.  I kept trying to find a reason to give it at least two stars: a few of the jokes worked, a few of the unintentionally funny bits were funnier than the jokes, but the movie kept exceeding each new low.

Victor Webster bores as the least exciting (or interesting) Mathayus.  (He spends a surprising amount of time for an action hero lying dazed upon his backside.)
Bostin Christopher (Olaf, an l too far IMHO) makes us groan as the least funny sidekick.
Krystal Vee (Silda) is given precious little to work with in making her the least interesting love interest.
Ron Perlman (Horus) grimaces through the entire movie looking like he wants to kill someone,... presumably his agent for getting him into this mess.
Only Billy Zane (Talus) seems to be truly enjoying himself,... but that could be the wine if he was drinking the real stuff.  (Actually, Zane is the only one completely at ease with parodying himself; the other poor suckers seem to have believed they were in a serious movie....  They were mistaken.)

The plot, and I use the term loosely here, has the good guys spending most of the movie KNOWINGLY fighting among themselves, which makes it so much easier for Talus to waltz in and take over.  Frankly, the movie doesn't get serious until a victorious Talus unleashes three undead warriors using the Book of the Dead King Ramusan had done such a pathetic job of protecting....

No, I lied; the movie doesn't really get serious then, either.  It is a measure of Director Roel Rein&eacute;'s incompetence that the climax, which involves Mathayus, Olaf, and Silda, all making their individual last stands against hopeless odds, is intercut so badly as to leave the viewer utterly confused about what is going on in each separate fight and largely uncaring about the outcomes.

Finally, a bunch of talented martial artists got to put something really embarrassing on their resumes; one hopes they were at least well paid.

Fearing it might be bad, I waited until it showed up in the last chance bargain bin clearance at a DVD rental price.

Obviously, I didn't wait long enough.",1370476800,,2931,6.406091370558376

The one plus is that they shot in Thailand, so they got the elephants cheap. Just how a the main character and his Germananic barbarian sidekick made from the desert to Thailand is kinda glossed over. Don't ask how the Roman soldiers , with the overly long swords, made it there either. Really, that is easier to buy into than the Forest Ninjas. Yes, I said Forest Ninjas. Really, by this point in the film, you've given up on any hope of good movie and are along for the ride. They don't explain why the Book of the Dead was in Thailand either.

4891771,2,B005TK0MFE,"I loved the Mummy movies, thought the original Scorpion King wasn't bad, this movie doesn't really live up to the previous movies. The basic idea is that he ends up being a hired mercenary for hire, which takes a suicide mission for a ton of gold if he succeeds. The movie ends up being predictable at the key moments, but the fighting is cool.

Whoever they hired to create the CG for this movie certainly tried, but ultimately failed as the CG is pretty bad. At the start you see a city where you can clearly make out the art background (You see dried chipped paint) which takes you right out of the movie. Another instance is where you see a prosthetic on someone that is so clearly fake which makes you think who was behind the scenes making these things.

Only the few key people in the story had ok acting (Ron Pearlman had good acting, which makes me wonder why he choose to work for this movie), but for the most part you felt like they were trying too hard to be the parts and not feel out the characters and become one with them. It's not enough to take you out of the movie (enough of that already), but still subpar for a movie that has ties to the Mummy.

The fighting was really only the cool parts in this movie. Most of it is pretty cheesy, but it's by no means hard to watch. I say only buy this movie if it ends up in the five dollar bin, and maybe think about it if it happens to be 10 dollars. I wouldn't want you wasting anything past ten dollars on this subpar movie.

(1.) There's actually a Hollywood props warehouse where all the studios store props, costumes, etc., to be reused over and over. Well, this film must have raided that warehouse. I saw costumes, swords, sets, gold chalices from every era and movie ever made. Yes, another Book of the Dead prop.
(2.) And, the costumes had that cheap, machine cut and patterned, faux leather look with lots of big brassy baubles that have no value other than to look shiny to Magpies that like to collect them for nesting. I wonder if the fashion design students that are hired have any historical or practical knowledge of the period/subject.
(3.) The script seemed like a melt between 21st century urban jargon and script writers that have watched too many early 20th century B movies about ancient Romans, Greeks, Mesopotamians, whatever with their pretend period language. My favorite line was ""Death to the invaders!"" How many movies have we heard that line from?
(4.) What can one say about the acting other than they must have had a week to fill, or it's the usual Willis over-the-hill just show up and regurgitate my stereotype acting.
(5.) Directing, and this is great, just one example. Around 13 minutes into the film our two heros attack a campsite of thieves; needless to say, lots of really bad fighting scenes. So, the bad guys get tossed into the campfire which happens to be heating a metal pot propped between two poles. The bad guys thrash around destroying the pot and fire and run off, also on fire. The very next scene we see our two conquering heros admiring how they pummeled the thieves and guess what is standing right next to them? The campfire, as if nothing had happened, with the pot miraculously standing undisturbed between the two poles.

8486337,1,B005TK0MFE,"(Note: I copied most of this from my review for Scorpion King 2)
I didn't buy this on Amazon but watched it on the Sci-Fi Channel. My Lord. This is a terrible, terrible movie. The first Scorpion King had the classic Mummy formula: swords and sorcery, vague Egyptian mythology and history, adventure, and sexy chicks in pointlessly revealing outfits who can fight but generally need an similarly clad big strong man to save them. The only difference is that in here, the special effects, the sets, and the prop work are so badly, badly, badly done that I literally wondered if there was any other point to this than Zane and Perlman needed some extra cash. Who the hell is Victor Webster, and how do you replace the Rick with Webster? Noticeable and massive, unrealistic change to the character's demeanor. The acting is horrendous - they don't even try to make the Egyptian characters seem real. The props are so cheap and so are the dark champion characters, the title of whom which I forget. Cobra's name is in English, ffs. She and the other woman are literally just here for action shots of sexy Asian women in revealing outfits, but their action scenes are terrible. Kimbo Slice's weapon can be covered in flames, but when the audience can see the holes in the club where the flames from from its so shoddy and unbelievable it's insulting. This movie also creates a massive plothole - in the first appearance of the Scorpion King, he wins his reputation through a seven-year war that brings him to the gates of Thebes. At this point he loses and is exiled to the Ahm Shere desert. He wanders for say a year? Then he makes his bargain with Anubis and returns to sack Thebes. However, this movie portrays him years AFTER the first Scorpion King standalone movie not making war on the known world. It unrealistically pads the timeline with years of ruling the Ramusan and Talus kingdoms (he could TECHNICALLY start his seven-year war after this movie) and doesn't explain why Mathayus wouldn't just stay in Asia as the Scorpion King with his Cobra Queen, Silda. Silda doesn't have any motive for conquering the known world and wouldn't support Mathayus with her army. It adds another 2-5 years of swimming in the eddies before returning to the plot again.

As a final note, Zane's acting is so overdone that it's actually insulting that he was paid for this movie at all.",1499385600,,2373,4.677033492822966
