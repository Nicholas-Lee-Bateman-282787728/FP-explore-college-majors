7904921,5,B000006QK6,"This 'Biography' feature on Baby Face Nelson, the most vicious and enigmatic of the 1930s midwest bank robbers, is informative and even thought-provoking.  Nelson (real name:  Les Gillis) was the son of  law-abiding Belgian immigrants in tough, working-class Chicago.  He started  running with street gangs and graduated to car theft and guns.  Nelson  hated authority and was known as a trigger-happy murderer more than an ace  bank robber, which he also was.  Ironically, he was also a devoted husband  and father of two small children before he was finally killed by the FBI at  the age of 26.  Tragically, he took three FBI agents and a few others with  him before he was through.  He got his nickname from people who couldn't  believe they were being robbed by a short guy with a 'cute face who was  light complected' and blond-haired.  In the end, his aggressive nature  caused him to actually confront the FBI instead of running, and he was  mortally wounded while calmly walking into a barrage of gunfire from two  agents whom he killed with a machinegun.
While this documentary  interviews two Nelson biographers, I could not find specific Nelson  biographies in Amazon, except for an out-of-print selection which Amazon is  trying to find.  Consequently, this 'Biography' piece is indispensable to  crime history buffs trying to understand what made Nelson tick.  It's  thought-provoking because we trace his development (or digression) from an  average urban family with a strict father whose suicide may have had an  impact.  Nelson the criminal loved his wife and kids but unlike, for  example, John Dillinger, seemed to have no conscience or compassion when it  came to others.  (We aren't told what his two children did or are doing as  adults.)  Interestingly, this video has a lot of rare pictures of Nelson  that appear totally different from his famous FBI mugshot.  Looking like an  All-American boy made him even more sinister.  The documentary is a real  find for those interested in one of the wildest outlaws of the wild 1930s.",944438400,,2051,4.988095238095238
