8732659,4,B0154WCG50,"When I bought this, I was hoping for a Blu-Ray of the Live in Japan 1984 concert.  This is a mixed format set.  The 1984 show is on DVD, and also includes 2 audio CD's of the show as well.  The Blu-Ray in the description applies to The Ritchie Blackmore Story.  The bio is a good enough show, but all things considered I would have rather had the concert in Bluray, and not the other way around.  Excellent show, although sometimes I wish ritchie would give the octave divider a rest.",1483056000,,484,4.274725274725275
8732660,5,B0154WCG50,If you want to learn everything about Ritchie this Dvd is for you. Its Ritchie's story. Wish he would get back with deep purple or do something with Rainbow but this concert will have to do.,1454457600,,190,4.305555555555555
8732661,4,B0154WCG50,"This exact issue is actually a Japan REGION 2 video . Although it says in the description, ""all regions"" it WILL NOT play in a regular US (Region 1 ) player. Therefore be advised that unless you have an all region player you will not be able to buy it for use in North America.  This is a regular Blu- ray copy and not the deluxe edition which comes with the book.  A great video - just be advised of the playback compatibility concerns.",1450828800,3,437,4.190476190476191
