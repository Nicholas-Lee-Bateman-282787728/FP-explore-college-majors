6104417,2,B00GRAGTY8,"This production by Bob Carruthers is an uneven effort at condensing a complex topic down into a 50 minute TV program.  It has some good points so I'll begin with them.  Bob shoots a bit of interesting footage of Wewelsburg Castle, a subject for which visuals are thin on the ground.  This is not a full tour or anything by any means, but any footage at all of this site is welcome.  And the first thirty minutes or so of this dvd are a decent summary of the contributions made to SS/Nazi occult ideology by Volkish philosophy, and important contributors such as; Madame Helena Blavatsky, Guido von List and Jorg Lanz von Liebenfels.  The role of eugenics is highlighted, but without any reference to the reality that eugenics was not unique to Germany, but in fact, started by British social thinkers and enthusiastically embraced right here in the U.S.  The Germans, in fact, felt that they were playing a game of ""catch up"" with other western nations.  If one believes Carruthers, one would think the Germans invented social policies that targeted the mentally and physically disabled, Jews, alcoholics, etc. for special discrimination...not at all the case.
So, much information is either missing, or misconstrued.  Nowhere in this dvd is there any mention of The Thule Society, no mention is made of the influence occult beliefs had on the thinking of prominent architects of Nazi ideology such as Alfred Rosenburg and many others.  Karl Maria Wiligut is mentioned only in passing.  No mention is made of the SS Ahnenerbe, nor anything about its expeditions to Tibet nor any of the many expeditions it sponsored all over Europe in search of Aryan origins.
Annoyingly, one inappropriate visual pops up more than once; Eliphas Levi's well known illustration of the, ""Sabbatic Goat"".  This is Levis', semi-famous picture of Baphomet; the stereotypical image of Satan.  Neither Levi, nor his illustration have anything what-so-ever to do with the SS or with Nazi occult philosophies. Neither one has any place in a serious discussion of the subject at hand.
Carruthers includes some nice present day footage of the Heidelburg Thingplatz.  It's a pretty site and interesting to see, but Carruthers chooses this point to digress into an entirely superficial critique of Pagan/Wiccan theological beliefs; again, an inappropriate commentary.  And from there (about 45 minutes into the program), things go downhill as Carruthers completely loses his focus and meanders into loose discussion about the final fate of the surviving Nazi leadership during the Nuremberg Trials.  This serves as his ""wrap-up"".
All in all, this is a disappointing effort.  It's almost a cheap shot at this point to harp on the low quality production values of much of the dvd; the over reliance on low quality, grainy, b&w stock footage or the unevenness of the audio track, or the one color shot of Heinrich Himmler and his henchmen that is used over and over at least six times.
I would recommend to anyone interested in this very interesting subject to pick up a copy of Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke's excellent book, ""The Occult Roots of Nazism"", or a copy of Heather Pringle's, ""The Master Plan"", or a copy of Christopher Hale's, ""Himmler's Crusade"", or even a copy of the four part dvd set, ""The Occult History of the Third Reich"".  All of these will give anyone who is interested a much better head start into learning about occult influences on the SS and the Nazi regime.",1397433600,,3448,4.958333333333333

6104420,4,B00GRAGTY8,Very interesting. I learned a lot although the title is somewhat misleading in that there is not much to do with the occult. It does touch on it from to time. It is an interesting informative account inside the evils that drove the Third Reich,1481068800,,243,4.4222222222222225

6104434,3,B00GRAGTY8,"The transformation of the SS from Hitlers elite guard to a mystical order. Good background on the origins of the reasoning as to why the Aryan race despised all other ""impurities"". Because they believed that pure Aryans possessed mystical powers and that those powers were lost due to interbreeding with inferior races over time. This documentary explains Himmler's efforts to create an Arthurian society within the SS to return purity, a plan gestating from his occult beliefs.

The documentary is hindered by a lack of diversity of scholar's and production values but is educational.",1461024000,,585,5.223404255319149

6104441,4,B00GRAGTY8,"A well-researched documentary about Himmler. While the beginning does discuss Himmler's SS occult/Aryan origins, it doesn't go into great detail. So while I wish they'd presented more of that angle -- since it is the title of the video -- at least it doesn't make wild accusations and suggest crazy ulterior motives. The Nazis were horrible enough without fabricating legends about them.",1451347200,2,387,5.258064516129032

6104451,3,B00GRAGTY8,It started out very good but the ending seemed as though the hurried up and threw in a bunch of unimportant information and then just ended it.  Over all it was pretty good but I really didn't like the way it ended.,1441411200,,215,4.119047619047619
6104452,2,B00GRAGTY8,"My complaint about this movie is that it one of those where the background music is high and the narrator's voice is low. This is not a good combination if you have sensitive hearing or live in an apartment building. ""The Occult History of the Third Reich"" (DVD set) was much better done and contained the same information. That set did a good job of putting Herr Hitler's ideas into historical perspective.",1440806400,6,407,4.666666666666667

6104456,4,B00GRAGTY8,"This docudrama corroborates most of the facts surrounding Himmler, but with one major exception:  Why did he shave his moustache or did a guard do it after his death, or did he in fact have a doppleganger stand in for him while he fled aboard a U-Boat out of Hamburg, which others have sworn included Hitler and Eva Braun.  A very deep and abiding question that only time will answer for sure!",1439164800,,393,4.444444444444445

I would never have known about this connection with the SS -  however for me it was all a bit rushed and was completely overshadowed by the music, the screeching trumpets and sirens or the repetative phrases of music were very distracting.",1437696000,2,387,5.03125

6104464,2,B00GRAGTY8,"Right or wrong, the information that was definitely presented from the winners perspective. I found it to be informative that the toxic ideas introduced to the leaders of the ""Nazi"" party were introduced by Jews. The film was compiled from a ""we beat you so you must really suck"" point of view. As is standard for a propaganda film. Rather than pointing out that the German society had been destroyed from the inside by the very people who claim to have been victimized by it. Don't get me wrong. I think it is a terrible crime when men murder one another. It should never happen.
Tell that to your ""elected leaders"" America. I choose not to be associated with any nation. Especially, one that condones murder for profit. As do most nations in this finance (Rothschild Zionist) controlled world. Welcome to the Fourth Reich! Have a nice day!",1436400000,,841,4.6891891891891895
6104465,1,B00GRAGTY8,There was not a lot of content just video of the trial after the war! I turned it off after 15 minutes.,1436400000,,103,3.727272727272727

8626368,4,B00GRAGTY8,"Anyone interested in the general cultural context of Nazism will enjoy this documentary. As another reviewer states, it is a bit uneven. The whole part about occultism somewhat minimizes its influence, reducing it to a counterfeit religion or belief, rather than going into all the depths of archeological investigation, ritual sacrifice, and spiritualist contact that the occult actually seems to have had. The reputed contact of Nazis with extraterrestrial entities is never even mentioned, nor is the putative post-war existence of bases at the poles. What's is there in the film is fine; there's just more to it. About the last third is devoted to the Nuremburg trials, and it becomes hard to see how they relate to occultism. So, yes, uneven: but interesting nonetheless. An error: Carruthers says that Speer was sentenced to life but was then paroled. Unless I am mistaken, Speer got 20 years, served them out at Spandau prison, and then was released in 1966.",1501027200,,965,5.0754716981132075

8626370,2,B00GRAGTY8,This is exceptionally repetitious and grinding. Example: in the first 5 minutes he tells you the castle is intended as a place where Himmler and his top 12 SS officers can meet about 5 times. There's very little information in it for you if you've done even basic research into the SS. I would advise you spend your time elsewhere.,1493424000,,331,4.533333333333333
8626371,5,B00GRAGTY8,"Excellent insight in the philosophy and beliefs that drove Hitler to make war against humans who he believed were inferior to them. Driven by an occultist and religious belief that they are the superior race they drove to make their strong belief to come true; just as the wars of others such as Iraq and Iran, the British that colonized other countries based upon their own beliefs so did the Germans. Another religious war.",1488240000,,425,4.756756756756757
8626372,5,B00GRAGTY8,"Excellent documentary with really high quality editing, narration, and rare footage. Also, the very eerie score near the end was outstanding. No weirdo conspiracy theory stuff; just accurate historical story-telling with hard facts.",1486425600,,232,6.0606060606060606

8626374,2,B00GRAGTY8,Some very interesting material in the first half; quickly lost interest when footage was repeated and subject matter deviated from what was promised in the title and wandered off to more general comments about the war,1485648000,,217,5.055555555555555
8626375,3,B00GRAGTY8,a bit boring -- most of the information given were previously known --- at least by me,1485475200,,86,4.117647058823529
