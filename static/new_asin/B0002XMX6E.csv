8034203,4,B0002XMX6E,"I was one of the lucky one who saw this series at Hastings back in the 1990's and bought everyone of the invaders on vhs.  Unfortunately, the tape series stops at this episode.  The Believers, is the turning point in the original series, ending season one.  This one is where there are those who start believing Mr.  Vincent's story of aliens.  A must see for those who kept up with the series.",1193097600,2,394,4.416666666666667
