5509482,5,B00ATK0452,"This French film depicting a birth mix-up is a beautiful story of the human spirit. No wars, no killings, just a look at how different cultures can live together peacefully. Totally engrossing with superb performances, especially by the two actors playing the two sons. I loved it. Highly recommended.",1365465600,,301,5.163265306122449
5509483,4,B00ATK0452,"Alternately ""schmaltzy"" and alternately realistic, this film  is a subtitled depiction of present-day Middle-East tensions personified by the use of an uncanny family drama. Very good acting and colorful footage of ethnic locales adds to the enjoyment level. There are, however, some elements of the story that seem to stretch rationale belief in their treatment of deep-seated political hatred and religious confrontation.  To avoid ""spoilers"", I won't elaborate. Also be advised that there is some English dialogue, and when it is spoken, the subtitles vanish.  Which is a disservice to the hearing impaired.",1364947200,10,610,5.537634408602151
5509484,4,B00ATK0452,"""The Other Son"" tells of Tel Aviv resident Joseph (Jules Sitruk) who, as he is preparing to join the Israeli army for his national service, discovers he is not his parents' biological son, and that he was accidentally switched at birth with Yacine (Mehdi Dehbi), the son of a Palestinian family from the West Bank.  At the time of the boys' birth, during the first Gulf War, a missile attack forced the hospital's evacuation, and in the confusion, they were sent home with the wrong parents.  Now, 18 years later, this revelation turns the lives of the two families upside down, forcing them to reassess their identities, their values, and their beliefs.

Writer/director Lorraine Levy and co-writer Nathalie Saugeon focus on how the young men and their families deal with the situation, with awkward visits among newfound relatives across the border and arguments within the families about years spent haboring an ""enemy.""  Performances are first-rate, particularly those of the two young leads, and the story is compelling.

The film is in French, with English subtitles. Bonus extras include making-of featurette, deleted scenes, and bloopers.",1364428800,12,1146,5.206521739130435
5509485,1,B00ATK0452,"I was hoping that since Emmanuelle Devos was in this movie it would be at least watchable.
I was wrong.
The premise of two boys, one Muslim the other Jewish, switched at birth seemed interesting.
But, in this case the reactions of the fathers, and the siblings was orchestrated melodrama.
If any of these characters faced this in real life they wouldn't have reacted as patently false as these characters.",1364083200,5,405,4.8
5509486,5,B00ATK0452,"Very thought provoking.  An issue that is very important to address in today's conflict's in the middle east.

the issues.",1362787200,2,225,4.357142857142857

5509488,5,B00ATK0452,"What an amazing movie!  The Other Son is a beautiful story that illustrates how love can unite two families.  It also shows that a person is more than just a nationality, religion, or set of beliefs.  Instead of choosing one over the other, you can embrace both and be the better person for it.",1494115200,,294,4.407407407407407

5509490,5,B00ATK0452,"Joseph (Jules Sitruk) at 18 attempts to enlist in the Israeli Air Force. No problem, a healthy kid who's dad is an Israeli career officer, right?  But his blood type matches neither parent. In short order it is revealed that he is the biological son of a Palestinian couple from the West Bank; and that that couple has raised the Israeli-born Yacine (Medhi Debhi) in his place. Their mothers, we learn, gave birth concurrently in a Haifa hospital, when a sudden missile attack caused the evacuation and subsequent return of the 2 babies, each to the wrong mother.  The storyline is complex, exploring the influence of nature versus nurture and identity in many contexts: 2 distinct cultures, that have, in addition, been at war; 2 religions; strong and intensely loving familial bonds that have been forged over 18 years, individual talents and interests that have influenced career goals, and on and on. The manner in which the members of each family connect, or don't, with their counterparts in the other family, and the ease or difficulty with which that occurs is fascinating. This is an exceptional film, beautifully co-written and directed by Lorraine Levy; expertly acted by all, particularly Sitruk and Dehbi and Emmanuelle Devos and Areen Omari (the mothers). The music by Dhafer Youssef is wonderfully atmospheric. All filmmaking disciplines are solid. This is one not to be missed.",1489363200,2,1393,5.052173913043478

5509494,5,B00ATK0452,"A deeply compelling, thoughtful, and balanced exploration of questions of identity and belonging, set in the context of one of the most fraught tribal tensions of our time. Even as it depicts the importance of family and tribe in forging our personal identity, the film reveals an even deeper and more fundamental element that shapes who we are and that (unlike tribalism) binds us all together:  love.  It's love that gives human beings the courage to transcend our typical ways of thinking about those we deem ""other"" and to enter into meaningful relationship with them.  Beautifully written, acted, and filmed, The Other Son is quickly becoming one of my favorite movies of all time.",1484265600,2,686,5.0

5509500,5,B00ATK0452,"This film was well-acted and gives the viewer plenty to ponder about not only the impact of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict but about the nuances of how we form our assumptions and social and political positions. The director does not seem to take sides in the conflict, except to promote the value of peace.  I found the conclusion potentially hopeful.  The filming was done in the West Bank and in Tel Aviv, and the contrast of environment and culture seems to me realistic (I lived there).",1479600000,,493,4.788235294117647

5509515,5,B00ATK0452,"This thoughtful, well acted film is about two male babies who were switched at birth in Tel Aviv. One was Arab and the other one was Jewish. Not until their late teens was the switch discovered. Then, the questions began. Is DNA or culture the most important factor?  What is hate?  What is love? Are the differences between Jews and Palestinians essentially unreconcilable?  Why is it easier for the mothers to adjust to the shock? This film has some eye-opening shots of the  physical and emotional walls separating Israel and the Palestinian settlements and the difficulty of border crossing for the Arabs. Any thinking person will have a learning experience watching this excellent film. I challenge you to come away from it without greater sensitivity to the issues. I would love to hear your reactions.",1465430400,7,808,4.962962962962963

Thank you Amazon Prime.

And now on to the film.  There are so many great films being made today that one is challenged to pay homage to them all.

However there are great films and then there are great films that somehow change us forever.  Such films that make us think and ask questions and reach deep down into the core of our hearts.  Others reviewers have already commented on the countless virtues of ""THE OTHER SON"" and why it towers over so many other wonderful films being made today by Directors and Screenplay writers of impeccable talent and never failing good taste and possessing exquisite sensitivity.

But somehow ""THE OTHER SON"" is more than just the sum of all the excellent parts.  As entertaining as it is from the first frame till the last it is yet somehow something more than another Award winning Film.  It grabs our Hearts, it opens our eyes, it makes us appreciate the folly and futility of hatred and prejudice and holding deep rooted grudges that get passed on from generation to generation.

""The Other Son"" challenges us to imagine the alternative paths and all ""the roads not taken"".

By the middle of the film I was already more than won over to one of the chief premises of the story.  That we not only should, but MUST somehow struggle, difficult as that can often be, to rise above the ""Fray"" of old animosities and the desire for revenge and decide we will choose a new route encompassing mutual understanding and yes even love for our fellow human beings, whoever they are and wherever there are.

In a world beset with violence and never ending bloodshed wherever one looks, ""THE OTHER SON"" is a timely reminder that in the end we are all each other's Brother and Sister, Son and Daughter only kept apart by a few degrees of Separation.

No amount of praise is adequate or sufficient to extol the magisterial virtues of this timely, precious and most unique film.

To all involved, including the Director, Screenwriter/s,  actors et al, I salute you on this remarkable achievement.  Well done.",1449360000,4,2287,4.607407407407408

This story gives a very honest portrayal of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.  I'm always on guard for biased presentation on this issue, and I did not detect any bias.  Neither group is 100% good or bad.  We are all just people with a mixture of good & evil.

You can see the contrast in the lives of the Jewish people living in modern Israel, and the challenges of the Palestinian families.  As someone who has been there and seen it firsthand, I found it to be an honest depiction of their situation.

It is easy to hate a group of people who you think are your enemies, but when you come face-to-face with a person, or a family that mirrors your own, you find that love can build a bridge.

It was thought-provoking, and I found it to be very moving.  I highly recommend it for anyone who is trying to understand more about this conflict.",1408233600,4,1029,4.335078534031414

The message is clear, but there is no real solution to the problem other than with friendly contacts, matters can be worked out. This French film with English subtitles presents its story in an almost stereotypical fashion. It shows Israeli life as being wonderful and Arab life as very poor. It also uses actors that look more like Americans for the Israelis and more Arab for the Arabs, even though in reality this is not always true.
The story is about two babies that are accidently switched in an Israeli hospital. One child is Israeli and the other Palestinian. One's biological parents lives in a nice almost rich home, the other in an almost slum area. Both are loved. Suddenly, without any warning, when the kids are teens, the facts are revealed.

5509618,4,B00ATK0452,"""The Other Son"" (2012 release from France; 105 min.) brings the story of 2 boys who are about to reach their 18th birthday. As the movie opens, we see Joseph, living in Tel Aviv, applying to enlist at an elite unit of the Israeli Air Force, requiring him to do various medicals tests. It isn't long before his parents learn that Joseph's blood type (A+) is not compatible with theirs (A-). After some investigating, it becomes clear that two babies were switched accidentally at birth. The other 18 year old is Yacine, whose family lives in Palestine's West Bank. Joseph is devastated when he finds out about the mix-up at birth. But what about Yacine in Palestine? And how will their families react? And their friends? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, kudos to writer-director Lorraine Lvy for bringing us this movie. The plot is entirely believable, and Levy treats the subject matter with dignity and respect. As you can well imagine, this is a delicate topic and if not done properly, you'll end up stepping on landmines. When the impact of it all hits Joseph, he wonders ""Am I still Jewish?"". Even more importantly, this movie shows again that, when you put politics aside for a moment, at the end of the day we are dealing with real human beings. Watch how the Jewish and Palestine mothers deal with the news that the sons they have raised are not their own...

Bottom line: this movie should be required viewing for anyone interested in the Israeli-Palestine conflict. No, ""The Other Son"" is NOT a political movie, but instead is a heartbreaking family drama with a political undercurrent. ""The Other Son"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1395014400,,1743,4.768211920529802

5509641,4,B00ATK0452,"Helmed by French director Lorraine Lvy, The Other Son (Le fils de l'autre) poses a universal question of ones identity in a very unique fashion. What if two babies  one Jewish and one Arabic  are accidentally switched at birth and raised by the wrong parents?

Emmanuelle Devos (Read My Lips) plays Orith, a French-born physician married to an Israeli army officer Alon (Pascal Elb) living in Tel Aviv. One day she learns from a doctor a strange thing about their 18-year-old son Joseph (Jules Sitruk).

Joseph has a blood type that indicates that he cannot be really their son. Later it is discovered that Joseph is son of the Arab couple Said (Khalifa Natour) and Leila (Areen Omari) living in the West Bank, and their son Yacine (Mehdi Dehbi) is Orith and Alons child.

Inevitably the plot is politically charged, though the director does her best trying not to make it so. The plot is more about the question of what constitutes one's identity, than about the present political situations, and the result is a well-acted and thoughtful drama, made with a sharply observant eye.

The film carefully depicts not only the experiences Joseph and Yachine are to go through; it is also about the psychological changes of their parents, siblings and even coworkers, and director Lorraine Lvy handles these delicate themes brilliantly.

Despite a few familiar plot devices, The Other Son works as a drama that is very touching. Some may (understandably) find it too optimistic, but the drama itself is strong nonetheless.",1385251200,,1517,4.948818897637795

5509653,5,B00ATK0452,"Even though two babies would have had proper hospital IDs and not been switched at birth, it's worth suspending disbelief to see this wonderful French fairy tale.  The ""Berlin Wall"" setting in Tel Aviv is so discouraging, worse than the Puerto Rican/White hostility in West Side Story. At first some members of the family are furious when the Israeli family's son reports for national service and they find out by genetic tests the Palestinian family raised the Jew and the Jewish family the Arab.  They repudiate the tests and vow to keep it secret.

Then we get to see how a father's heart is melted by his son's being musically talented.  We get to see how a mild-mannered boy might like to have a somewhat bellicose brother when walking on the beach at night.  We get to see how a teenager might like to have a pass to get to know his brother, and that includes access to the beach.  We get to see a teenager exempted from military service.  The mothers are thrilled from the start to have two sons.  It's a fairy tale because, as an example of good ole reality, Scott Peterson's sister genetically, but adopted and unaware of his existence, was just getting to know him when he murdered his wife Laci and son Connor (it's in her book, Blood Brother by Anne Bird, which most people would not want to read, but I was very interested after reading Laci Peterson's mother's book, For Laci, by Sharon Rocha, a heartbreaker if you like true crime.)  Anyway, if you have ever looked at the uniformed lines of soldiers and thought, ""They're really all Dave Barry, who despite getting into his 40s and 50s still looked like and acted like a teenager,"" you might like this parable of how the adults sending boys off to war are supposed to realize, ""They're all our children and we are besotted with them.

5509655,5,B00ATK0452,"While the world continues to struggle to understand the constant schism between Palestine and Israel and yet permutations of that unsettled hot fire whose coals continue to smolder between aggressive flares, along comes a film such as this one  - THE OTHER SON or Le fils de l'autre  - and provides some insights that at least for the moment offer a better understanding of a very long struggle. Based on an idea by Noam Fitoussi who wrote the screenplay with Director Lorraine L&eacute;vy and Nathalie Saugeon, this is a gentle film about resolution of conflict - at least on the family level. It is a French production filmed in the West Bank and Israel under the sensitive direction of Lorraine L&eacute;vy.

It's not uncommon for those who rightly resent being biologically categorized on government questionnaires, to defiantly write in `human' when asked to indicate their race. And the same holds true in its own compelling but curious way for the switched at birth DNA-driven identity crisis drama, The Other Son.

The relative stability of the two families in question - the Israeli Silbergs (Emmanuelle Devos and Pascal Elb&eacute;and) the Palestinian Al Bezaaz (Areen Omari, Khalifa Natourkin, and older son Mahmud Shalaby) in the West Bank - is shaken up when eighteen year old Joseph Silberg (Jules Sitruk) puts his musical aspirations on hold to report for mandatory military duty. But an army blood test confirms that he could not be the child of his parents, an odd stratagem, that a military on such permanent alert would be so thorough, especially since Joseph's father is a high ranking commander. But during a Gulf War missile attack near the Haifa hospital where Joseph was born, a Palestinian mother gave birth at the same time. And in the ensuing confusion, the babies must have been released to the wrong women. Joseph's distraught parents first waver, then seek out the Al Bezaaz family. And Yacine (Medhi Dehbi), their designated `other son' in question, who has returned home for a visit from his medical school studies in France. While alternately fearful and hopeful mixed emotions become entangled, compounded by a profound cultural divide along with two fathers into deeply disapproving denial. Yet it is the coming together of the three `brothers' that offers a ray of nope that in time this festering conundrum may be resolved.

The cast is splendid, especially Jules Sitruk and Medhi Dehbi whose humanity holds the story together. Highly recommended. In French, English, Arabic, and Hebrew with subtitles. Grady Harp, September 13",1379203200,13,2564,5.080760095011876

5509661,5,B00ATK0452,"It could have been trite - two babies swapped at birth, one Israeli, one Palestinian.  But if you accept the plot, it's stunning.  It's a sensitive exploration of how anyone would cope with the revelation that their much loved adult child is not actually related to them.  The mothers cope better than the fathers!

It makes you reflect on the nature of family relationships, genetics versus environment, and of course the Israeli/Palestinian issues.

I have seen it twice so far and look forward to seeing it again!",1375056000,,516,4.885057471264368
5509672,5,B00ATK0452,"I noticed that this movie was being shown at a Jewish Community Center in my neighborhood so I wanted to find out why.  I purchased the DVD and I am very glad I did.  Everyone should see this movie because of the insight it gives us in so many areas and on so many levels.  It is an excellent learning tool!  Seeing the love come through in very difficult circumstances was believable because I contend that the basic nature of humanity is to love if the prejudices, evil & hatred that exists on a global level are left out of relationships.",1374624000,,541,4.326732673267327
5509673,5,B00ATK0452,"Two babies born in an Israeli hospital are switched at birth; so the Palestinian baby is raised by Jewish Israelis, and the Jewish baby is raised by Palestinians.

5509677,4,B00ATK0452,"Don't be put off by the subject or the setting.  The Other Son overcomes a potentially hokey premise to deliver a beautifully restrained and ultimately very moving meditation on the Israeli-Palestinian conundrum.  It's well directed, astutely cast, extremely well acted - and deserves to be widely seen.  Tell a friend!",1370217600,,319,5.34

Great great movie about a Palestinian baby and a Jewish baby accidentally switched during a rocket raid when the nurses were scrambling to the bomb shelter. The fact is discovered 17 years later. Incredible portrait of parents, children, love, conflict, family and a glimpse of the war between Jews and Palestinians. Powerful, moving, disturbing and yet a real soul searcher about what the word ""son"" means to Mothers. P, Walnut Creek, CA",1367193600,16,491,5.074074074074074

8557564,5,B00ATK0452,I just saw what is one of my favorite movies of all time for the 2nd time. It was just as powerful the 2nd time as the first. My thoughts after seeing it were that it should be mandatory viewing for all people who experience hatred for another culture. Love conquers all and lets us know we are all fundamentally the same. It also reminded me that we need many more women in places of power in the world. We would have a much more loving a peaceful civilization if that were the case. I felt like each family gained another son. It was an incredible movie.,1519516800,,556,4.205607476635514

8557572,5,B00ATK0452,"Excellent.  I first bought the blu-ray version after having rented the DVD from my library.  There is a one tiny difference in one English subtitle in the DVD version and the blu-ray version.  I felt it was important enough that I then bought the DVD version too, which includes what I believe to be an important subtitle that is not included in the blu-ray version.  Stick with the DVD; it has the same Special Features as the blu-ray version too.",1496102400,,448,4.5625
