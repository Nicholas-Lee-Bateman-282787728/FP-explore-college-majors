5360886,4,B009Q6F5WC,"I guess this is becoming a habit with these Blu-Ray re-issues of Anime Classics. No production Gallery Stills, no Non-Credit Openings. The new fans of this series will never know what they've missed unless they happen to come across the old Geneon DVDs. My opinion is this: If you're going to do a re-issue, do it right. Include ALL of the original material (old anime trailers not withstanding of course, unless Blu-Rays are planned), but at least include all the other interesting extras that hard core fans would want. Here you just get the bare bones episodes at a very premium price upgrade. Sentai Filmworks isn't the only one guilty of this. Funimation also did the very same thing with their re-issue of the Tenchi Muyo Film Collection, which left a TON of extras not included. If you are lucky enough to own the original discs, you KNOW what I'm talking about.

Still, this is a series that really must be seen, and when seen, you'll want to own it. That said, the DVD set is a great value. If you can afford the extra cash for the Blu-Ray set, go for it, but my original Geneon DVDs look pretty good on my LG Blu-Ray player, and the (assumingly) remastered Sentai DVDs should be a great buy.",1366416000,5,1201,4.534562211981567

5360888,4,B009Q6F5WC,"When it comes to video games and its characters, I don't think I've seen a title derived from a video game, within the last decade, achieve so much attention than the ""Fate"" series from TYPE-MOON.  This series has captivated people from all over the world, merchandise continues to sell very well (considering its price for importing) and it's quite impressive to see how the fanbase continues to grow and are dedicated to ""Fate""!

My first introduction to the ""Fate/stay night"" was just hearing about the original anime TV series.  But it was the first PSP video game release (""Fate/unlimited codes"" on the PlayStation Network that actually got me hyped for this series and made me learn more about the characters.

The more I researched, the more I started to noticed that a lot of people online were excited about this video game and discussing the anime series and while I never really understood the commotion of the series, I figured there were so many fighting games in Japan with characters that people go crazy for.

But then the Sony PSP game came out on the PlayStation Network and the huge number of posts on Danny Choo's official website in regards to dolls or figures, may they be the release of Nendoroids from Good Smile! or FIGMA figures from Max Factory, suffice to say, I've seen the popularity for this ""Fate/stay night"" achieve critical mass not just in Japan but all over the world.

At Anime Expo 2011, I attended a press conference which featured the release of a ""Fate Extra"" and once again, I've seen fans going crazy.  In 2012, the Blu-ray and DVD of ""Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works"" was released by Sentai Filmworks and now in 2013, the first volume of the original 2006 anime series will be released in January 2013.

The TV series is directed by Yuji Yamaguchi (""Yami to Boshi to Hon no Tabibito"", ""Angel Links"", ""Fate/stay night""), screenplay by Takuya Sato (""Armored Troopers Votoms Case; Irvine"", ""Mission-E"", ""Ichigo Mashimaro""), music by Kenji Kawai (""Devilman"", ""Eyeshield 21, ""Eden of the East"", ""Dai-Guard"", ""Blue Seed""), character designs by Megumi Ishihara (""Moonlight Lady"", ""Kakyusei"") and art direction by Toshihisa Koyama ("".hack//Liminality"", ""Halo Legends"", ""Kiddy Grade"", ""Outlaw Star"").  Anime Production is by Studio DEEN.

What is ""Fate/stay night""?

""Fate/stay night"" is a Japanese visual novel developed by Type-Moon and was originally an adult game for the PC and then later released for the PlayStation 2.  The popularity of the video games led to a manga series which was serialized in Shonen Ace magazine and in 2007, a 24-episode anime series was released and a total of four video games.  In April 2012, the latest in the ""Fate"" anime series titled ""Fate/Zero"" (which is set 10 years before the events of ""Fate/stay night"") began airing in Japan and the second season is still airing on television.

In 2010, Studio Deen released the film ""Fate/stay night"" and in 2012, Sentai Filmworks released the animated film, ""Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works"" on Blu-ray and DVD.  The film was comprised of important scenes from the original TV series that is 24-episodes long (12 hours) but unfortunately, with an abridged film at 105-minutes long, you miss out on a lot of story.

So, ""Fate/stay night"" will now be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Sentai Filmworks.

VIDEO:

It's important for people to know that ""Fate/stay night"" is an older anime series.  Not old-school but I usually feel that with series that were released 2009 and later, they tend to be HD native and look better.  But for older series, they either are remastered at a higher bitrate and in the case of ""Fate/Stay night"", it's a 1080i High Definition (169) release.

Fortunately, the series does look good for its age.  Colors are robust and while TV series are expected to have softness, fortunately the series is not too soft but you will see some banding and artifacts (not a lot but they are there).

But for those who have wanted ""Fate/stay night"" to be released on Blu-ray, for this 2006 anime series, you should be pleased by its overall picture quality as it does look better than many series that were upconverted to Blu-ray.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Fate/stay night"" is presented in English and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0.  Typically, English soundtracks tend to have a more dynamic range as they are often fixed up for its US release.  In the case of this series, the Japanese audio actually has better dynamic range.  But both are well-acted and dialogue, music and sound effects are clear through the front channel.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Fate/stay night"" does not come with any special features.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Finally!  I can understand what the ""Fate/stay night"" storyline is all about!

Having played the video games and having seen the large dedicated fanbase for the ""Fate/stay night"" series in Japan, America and all over the world...I don't think I have seen a video game receive so much recognition by fans worldwide.  You just don't see people going crazy for ""Street Fighter"" or ""King of Fighters"" action figures but look online and there are fans that just go crazy for the video games and action figures.  And while I do feel that the character designs of the characters of ""Fate/stay night"" are quite cool to look at, I was drawn to it because of the character designs and for the fact that I am a fan of Japanese fighting video games.

And I am very  happy that Sentai Filmworks have released this animated series in the US.  Primarily to satisfy those who are big fans or are newer fans thanks to the video gae and the previous movie release.

While I do know that Japanese companies that sell the merchandise have done a fantastic job in making ""alter"" version and just continuing to give fans these wonderful looking versions of the characters and detailed outfits with the dolls and figures in Japan, here in America, more and more people are jumping on the ""Fate/stay night"" bandwagon.

As mentioned earlier, last summer I attended the ""Fate Extra"" reveal for the video game and the crowd went nuts when they saw the announcement of the game.  And similar to the video games, there is also innovation by trying to release the video games encompassing various genres instead of fighting video games.  From the adult PC game to the recent strategy tactic PSP game, fans are really enjoying the ""Fate/stay night"" series.  May it be the action figures, the dolls or the games, this is one series that fans all over the world are passionate about.

And therefore, I wouldn't be surprised if fans go after the Blu-ray or DVD release of ""Fate/stay night"".

I'm quite biased towards the characters already and to finally now the context of what the story is about and the war between the seven magi's, it's a rather enjoyable concept, not necessarily unique, but it's the characters that make this worthwhile.  There is non-stop action and while the animated series tends to focus more on Shiro and Rin, Saber and Archer fans will also enjoy this series.

A lot of action is featured throughout each episode and as mentioned earlier, unlike the movie which is 105 minutes of footage taken from the series, fans who saw the movie first, should be happy that they can see the series in its entirety on Blu-ray.

As for the Blu-ray release, it's a 2006 anime TV series, so it is an upconvert, but compared to other anime series upconverts, it does look good.  Colors are vibrant at times but there are hints of softness, artifacts and banding as well.  But it's expected for a series that is slightly older.  My only disappointment is the lack of any special features.

Exciting and action-packed, the first half of the series pretty much focuses on Shiro Emiya and Saber developing a relationship and taking on various challenges.  But things are definitely going to become much more difficult for the second half of the series.

Overall, ""Fate/stay night"" is an enjoyable action-packed anime series and one of the better series based off a video game.  If you love the video games or just craving for an action anime series, ""Fate/stay night - Collection 1 is recommended.",1364601600,,8171,4.859205776173285
5360889,4,B009Q6F5WC,"Just as the title states this is exactly what I was expecting. Overall I would say that I was pleased with my purchase, however I personally believe that charging over 40$ for 12 episodes is a bit much. That means that you will be spending another 40+ to complete this series. Yes I bought it but that is because I am a huge fan of the Fate franchise. If you are a casual anime fan I would think twice before shelling out that hard earned money.",1364428800,,445,4.186046511627907
5360890,5,B009Q6F5WC,"I have been a fate fan for a few years. This is series is very well thought out, action packed, and intelligent enough to keep almost anyone entertained and interested for years to come. This series has some problems, I will admit that. I.e. some of the continuity is lost because they try throwing in parts of the other story lines (there are 3) into the Stay Night story to make this series longer (not done as well as it could have been), another problem is the change of wardrobe for no apparent reason (You will know what I mean when you see it.), etc. I would still recommend this series to everyone.

Now to explain my review title. This series is AMAZING, BUT not worth 50$ for only half of it. The DVD version though is the COMPLETE series for about 35-40$ depending on where you are looking for it. This anime came out back in 2006. The quality difference is almost unnoticeable and it's cheaper.

My closing statement. This series is one everyone should watch. You won't regret it. But be realistic when buying it. Just because it says Blue-ray, doesn't mean that it is better then DVD. Thank you for reading and I hope this helped your decision.",1363910400,14,1157,4.478672985781991
5360891,1,B009Q6F5WC,"This is what is killing the anime industry, 50 bucks for half of a series that is already dubbed. So basically 100 bucks for what is a catalog title. This title is easy to find steaming, and many of the fans have the DVDs. If you want to argue that this set goes for 100+ on the resell market so did Black lagoon and that was only 35 bucks. I will wait for a 35-40 complete series myself as this is what all this title is worth.

The series itself is great series that get 4.5 stars.",1359504000,12,483,3.979381443298969
5360892,5,B009Q6F5WC,"Shirou lives alone after his adopted father passed away and left him with a huge house. Shirou has the ability to reconstruct objects with his magic. He stumbles across a classmate and a couple warriors in a battle after school. He soon becomes part of ""The Holy Grail War"". A battle fought every so often to obtain the Holy Grail. The winner gets to make a wish. He becomes the master of a legendary warrior spirit. Her name is Saber. Togther with their ally Rin and her servant, Archer, they will fight against ruthless enemies for their 1 most precious wish.

This anime is simply amazing. It has action and drama mixed together with mythology and magic. The modern day setting with legendary mythical heroes is really cool. I normally prefer anime dramas (Kanon, Clannad, Air, etc.) over action series, but this anime combines the 2 genres very well. The voice cast, animation, story, and soundtrack are all top notch. It's a very addicting series. There are many great, and memorable characters that keep you interested in the story and wanting to know more about them. There is also a dash of comedy thrown in there to lighten the mood. It's a very well rounded series with a lot to offer. I honestly think that no matter what genre of anime you're into, Fate Stay/Night will make you a happy camper.

I own this on DVD and Blu-ray. I have to say that the Blu-ray upgrade is excellent. It may seem kinda steep for a 13 episode box set, but it's worth it. If you buy the DVD's, you'll end up spending at least the same amount of money. Fate/Stay night is worthy of being called a legend. You don't want to pass this series up. I highly recommend it and I hope you enjoy it!",1358726400,11,1678,4.480392156862745
5360893,5,B009Q6F5WC,"I borrowed this series from a friend and loved it!  Once I knew I liked Fate I wanted to buy the complete set.  Problem is since they stopped making it, the few people that were selling it wanted over $200 easily for the set!  This series is great, but I don't think I'd would ever pay over $200 for a complete anime series unless if it was something that had over 100 episodes and would be crazy expensive to buy each season individually.  If I recall, this series had less than 25 episodes.  I have been patiently waiting and now they are releasing this on blu ray, hooray!  FYI, there are some bootlegs on ebay for sale, but it is better waiting for the real thing!

NOTE:  Now if only they would finish the manga!  I have up to volume 11 in the manga books but for some reason they quit :(

*The English manga, the Japanese manga finishes at volume 18, but not being able to read Japanese means I am left hoping that they finish it in English.",1357344000,3,947,4.211111111111111
8543702,5,B009Q6F5WC,"Fate Stay Night, I knew when this first came out over a decade ago that it would be huge and boy was I right. The original anime has aged some but so what?

8543704,4,B009Q6F5WC,"Visual novels and anime can seem quite similar, but this series is a perfect example of how they are different.  Add a star if you love the game, but others are going to spend an awful lot of this series going, ""What?"" because even 24 episodes is not time enough to fully understand what the heck is going on no matter how beautifully animated the fight scenes are.

Essentially seven magic users assisted by seven great heroes are battling it out for the Holy Grail which will grant the winning pair a couple of wishes, and this series depicts the ""Fate"" arc fairly well, though there are a number of things that are skipped or only scratched the surface of.

Note: The ""Fate"" arc, this set and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fate-Stay-Night-Collection-2-Blu-ray/dp/B00AO05AHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fate / Stay Night Collection 2 [Blu-ray</a>] are essentially the same thing as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fate-Stay-Night-TV-Complete-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B00LBU7K88/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fate / Stay Night TV: Complete Collection [Blu-ray</a>].

8543711,3,B009Q6F5WC,"I hate to give it 3 stars, but this particular FSN (BluRay collection) gives me a sour face every time I look at it, mainly due to the high price for a bare bones product.

Firstly, coming from just discovering the series, I watched it chronologically; Fate/Zero first (the prequel though it was released after FSN), then FSN. If you do the same as I did, you will be a bit dissappointed with it.
It's almost as if Fate/Zero was produced to to correct all the flaws found in it's sequel, which made it stand head & shoulders above FSN. I enjoyed FSN merely for the fact of character continuation, as Fate/Zero did a spectacular job across the board, leaving you wanting more.

If you're a fan, FSN will no doubt still be enjoyable, but no way can I recommend this BluRay to someone else.

I HIGHLY recommend watching at at least, and reading the manga adaptation. Hell, it'd be even better if you could play the visual novel, though it's unlikely that you could get your hands on it.

FSN is good (Fate/Zero much MUCH better), but just cant reccommend this at the price. Go to Youtube or Hulu.",1374537600,3,1093,4.45
