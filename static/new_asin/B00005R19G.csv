For the first time I was able to pour water over their heads in the bath without them crying - they wanted to do it 'like Kristen'. They also wanted to eat grapes and cereal for breakfast like Kristen.",1103241600,,284,4.181818181818182
7951426,4,B00005R19G,"I have 2 1/2 year old twin girls and it's hard to find
a video that they can agree on.  They love watching Kristen
and learn something from everything she does.
We watch this video together everyday!",1006905600,,199,4.378378378378378
7951427,5,B00005R19G,"My son is 3 and an only child.  We love the video because it gives him the chance to interact with another child.  I had an older sister, so I know the effect of having someone older to learn from.  After watching the video a few times, he wanted to dress all by himself and likes to brush his teeth.  He also likes to eat brocolli because Kristen does.",1005609600,,353,4.072463768115942
