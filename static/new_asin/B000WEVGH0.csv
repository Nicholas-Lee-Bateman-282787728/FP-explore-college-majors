2967454,3,B000WEVGH0,"Invasion was scary from the beginning. It took awhile before the first scary event happened and it was not bloody/gory/over the top. I was less scared after that but it grabbed hold and became a nail biter.

It is a very different sort of movie. The story takes place in real time - something that really happened was caught on camera and I was watching supposedly true events. Since it is slow it doesn't create a rush, but it does make you feel like something terrible is down the road. The main character it is all happening to is agonizingly anticipating rescue or death any minute.

I liked it a lot.",1198540800,,605,4.441441441441442
2967455,3,B000WEVGH0,"This is a very unique experimental film, more like a prototype. Classic horror/sci-fi story, completely original in how it gets told.  I read the review on the link below before watching it and I'm glad I did because this movie isn't for everybody.
[...]

I sure hope Pyun uses what he figured out from this film to make another one-shot movie.
Invasion needs to be viewed at night without interuption because the film watcher has a part to play.  Your imagination has to be intact. Invasion is not for passive film watchers expecting mainstream or blockbuster movies.

It's extremely low budget, but that's part of what makes it so entertaining. I hate it when 150 mil get splashed on the screen and it fails to entertain and I'm impressed when something as inventive and clever as this entertains for pennies on the dollar.

The story unfolds in front of a police car dash-cam and relies heavily on the sound (excellent) because often nothing happens in front of the camera, which makes the concept that much more believable.  A police officer  (Brick Bardo) is cruising through his usual nightly rounds on prom night. This night just happens to have meteor showers falling on his town. There is something inside the meteors that could potentially destroy the world. Officer Bardo just happens to meet a town resident who had the misfortune to encounter whatever was inside of one of the meteors. These and more happenstance occurrences take place in front of or near the dash cam.

I've watched enough of those 'cop' shows with police officers searching and busting criminals on the hoods of their cars, in front of their dash cams,  to be able to follow a film like this without becoming impatient and the view is a lot better on Invasion. I liked that my imagination could fill in some of the mystery. But I did wish, over and over, that more could happen in front of the camera.

Mr. Pyun, please do this again, only better next time.",1198540800,4,1940,4.696165191740413
2967456,1,B000WEVGH0,"Do not, I repeat, do not buy this movie. I paid twenty bucks for it (which appears to have been what was spent on the entire budget of the film) and it looks like it was made by high-schoolers. No, I take that back, by elementary students having their worst day ever. Horrible directing, acting (what little there is of it), and plot (been there, done that). Please, save your money...there are so many better movies. Seriously, anything else picked at random would be better. Take my word for it - throw a dart at your next selection.

To sum it up for anyone who wants to view it look at the cover picture that is it the entire boring movie never leaves this scene they just drive thru this forest and watch people turn to zombies. And to be honest the only way to enjoy this movie would be with several friends all high and having them lift the couch moving it back and forth while you watch it on a big screen it will make you feel like you are the driver of each vehicle. Honestly you have to be high to enjoy this flick after a few min I had to ff the I was at the end weird as hell.

The main character ""Cheryl"" inspires nothing but annoyance with her constant wailing, moaning, shreaking, crying, praying, and cursing.  There is one scientist sent to investigate the strange events and he presents nothing but poor science.  There is some life form which origin is from meteorites and first it's a bug, then a bacteria, then a viral agent, then a parasite.  It spreads from an infected host's mouth into a new host's ear canal, and it's implied that there is some collective intelligence or conciousness.  It then ""mutates.""

Even the opening and closing scenes show a small news crew that is planning on hiking into this small county in CA to get some answers.  She claims that this infection was contained by the Army with tactical nuclear strikes in the previous 48 hours.  How are any of you going to survive the radioactive fallout which can spread dozens of miles, and you are going to walk into the center of town?

Also the infected can only walk with ataxic, uncoordinated, slow movements.  The living uninfected are running away, and they are always caught.

2967691,2,B000WEVGH0,"I caught this on Prime Streaming for free. It's basically a two-character improv radio drama, with a dashboard cam for a screen saver.
The concept was intriguing, and I wanted to like it. But it's only worth 2 Stars, and I'm being kind here because I'm pretty sure this was a student project.

It's only 64 minutes long, and about 15 minutes of that is the end credits, because even though this film has literally a zero budget and was just shot with a Best Buy dash cam on a dirt road, every single living person the producer ever met, lived next to, or went to school with winds up with a credit at the end.

The film doesn't really have a plot, and so there can be no ending, it just runs out of time around :45 like the two actors improvising the scene looked up from their mic's at the director and said 'I can't think of anything else to say, can you? I think we've taken this as far as it can go, we're just repeating ourselves'. Which they were.

I don't see any signs of editing here, I think they just released it uncut.

Don't even think about buying this, or even paying to rent it. See it free on Streaming sometime when you can just leave it on as background noise for doing the laundry.

I'm feeling generous so I'll give it 2 Stars for the radio-drama concept, but I understand why others give it only 1 Star.

Hope this is helpful, and saves somebody some disappointed expectations. Happy trails, everybody.

I think the looooong credits are just to pad out the running time (because no one would buy a :45 minute 'feature film').
For a little under an hour, we see a night time rural dirt road illuminated by a car's headlights as the vehicle moves along around 10, 15 miles an hour. The entire film consists of the lead character having an endless cell phone 911 conversation with an endlessly patient cop at the rural sheriff's office.
The dialog seems almost entirely to be ad libbed and improvised without a written script, and then never edited. It shows.

The idea is that a teenage girl is out after her high school Prom with her boyfriend, driving around a rural dirt road in the local 10,000 acre State Park looking for someplace to park and make out.
But they pass a broken down pickup truck, the boyfriend gets out to help, the truck driver attacks boyfriend in zombie fashion, and Terrified Prom Queen drives alone around the State Park's dirt roads at 10 MPH for the rest of the hour, boo-hooing to an unbelievably patient Deputy (no, I mean unbelievable in the bad way).

Gradually we learn through the Deputy that meteorites have fallen nearby and 'The Military' (cue ominous evil music) have arrived and oh by the way the Deputy is watching the town turn Zombie all around him, but he remains on the phone with 'Crying Prom Chick'. Well, OK.

A really talented director/editor might pull that off successfully if you had a really smart, clever, 'Pontypool'-quality radio script for the actors to do. I mean, an Orson Welles quality radio-theater script.
Alas, Mr. Welles being long deceased was not available at the time of filming.

So instead, an actress who really does sound 18 does an hour's worth of High School Drama Improv Workshop-quality ad libbing with the only other character, the Deputy, who's voiced well enough by a much more competent actor but he still has no real script to work with and his co-star isn't up to much besides endless boo-hooing, so this improv-session really doesn't have much of any where to go.

The visuals are simply the dashboard cam and the dirt roads. We never see any meteorites, or Zombie townie hoards running amok, or 'The Military (cue evil music again)'.",1408752000,4,3636,4.551301684532925

2967710,3,B000WEVGH0,This is an interesting idea. Basically done in a 'blair witch' ripoff format. Alien invasion with a government conspiracy twist all caught on a dash cam. The main character though is a severely whiny high school girl. Screaming and cussing about everything. Would have been nice to have a actress portraying a little backbone. I would have enjoyed this a bit more if the character had been a bit stronger. Over all it is just someone driving back and forth for an hour on a deserted road. The general story was a cool idea but I would have fleshed it out a bit more and thrown in just a little action. All the action happens off camera you only get to hear it.

After being driven for a short period of time by an uninteresting police officer, the car is taken over by a hysterical teen girl. Literally the entire movie is driving back and forth on the same short dirt road at night. A GoPro and a flashlight could have created a better film.

People have pointed out that you need to use your imagination to really get into the film. While I agree that a well planned plot twist that leaves the viewer with a bit of ambiguity can make a film. What the film should not do, is make the viewer imagine it in its entirety. At this point all you have is a premise not a full fledged movie.

The other problem is that the film is short, just 65 minutes. The producers make up for that by including over 15 minutes of credits. I'm not sure if the actor's pets were credit because after a while I was zoning out.

2967714,4,B000WEVGH0,"I want to say upfront that I'm a sucker for found footage movies. While I usually come away from them dissatisfied (the nature of the found footage story pretty much guarantees the ending is going to be non-existent no matter how much awesomeness came before), I still can't help myself. There's something very intimate and honest about the format. Also, I'm always on the lookout for new and interesting ways to tell a story, and I think the found footage format is really open to those possibilities. With that in mind, I watched this movie, INVASION, that my aunt loaned me.

INVASION (aka INFECTION) is a 2005 movie from director Albert Pyun, a man who, I've read, is considered on par with Ed Wood, but who, in my opinion is responsible for some unheralded classics (THE SWORD AND THE SORCERER, the disastrous 1990 version of CAPTAIN AMERICA, 1991's DOLLMAN). The premise of the movie (written by Cynthia Curnan) is that an alien invasion has taken over a small, isolated town in the middle of the night. We see the action taking place solely through a police car's dash-mounted camera. That was all my aunt had to say, I was sold.

The story starts with Deputy Bardo riding out to where a meteor was reported to have fallen to the ground. Along the way he passes a man with a broken down truck, for whom he calls a tow truck. Then he passes a couple parked in the woods after that night's high school prom, whom he comments to himself he'll ""rouse"" on his way back. When he gets to the scene of the call, at first he has a hard time finding old man Jenkins, the local who called in the crash, but when he does find him, the man attacks the deputy and we see something black and snakelike wriggling into the deputy's ear. From there he goes back to the prom couple and attacks the boy, but the girl, Cheryl Cooper, gets away by hopping into the cop car and taking off.

Cheryl contacts Deputy Ben who, along with Dr. Franks, tries to figure out what's happening to their town. Cheryl, however, is trapped in the park where Deputy Bardo had found them. One end of the road through the park is a dead end, while all the roads out have been blocked, first by the now-infected tow truck driver, then by Deputy Bardo and Old Man Jenkins.

As Cheryl's desperation level gets higher and higher, things back in town are also getting worse. Deputy Ben and Dr. Franks split up to check out the town, but only one of them comes back and Cheryl starts getting conflicting stories about what she should do: stay in the car or hide in the woods. Considering the circumstances, neither idea sounds all that great.

INVASION is a very small, simple movie. With the only camera being mounted on the dash of the police cruiser, a good deal of what we hear plays into the tension and suspense. Jenny Dare Paulin plays Cheryl and she does a decent job. A little over-dramatic in a few spots, but considering for 90% of her screen time she's just a voice, she pulls it off ok.

INVASION is not without flaws, however. There are a couple of spots when Cheryl begins hallucinating that she sees multiple ghost-images of herself approaching from the woods. That would be fine, except we're seeing the action through a police cruiser's camera, and we see the hallucinations, too. Ghostly images of Cheryl in her prom dress, coming closer, then fading away to nothing. The camera shouldn't have seen that.

Also, since most of the action is just Cheryl driving down one dirt road after another, trying to find a way out of the park, the action lags quite a bit in several places. INVASION is a good movie and it's well-done, but it also opens itself up several times for you to check the clock. And while the movie officially runs 81 minutes, the story itself only runs about 68. There's a very very lengthy credit sequence at the end. Which means that, in 68 minutes, this story couldn't keep me interested enough even for an HOUR without making me want to see how much was left. That's not good.

Still, though, it was a good movie and I'd certainly watch it again. The plot is anything but original, but it's such a tried and true one that it still works, even though I've seen it a hundred times. And I don't care what people say about Albert Pyun, I like his movies, and INVASION is no exception. Hell, he even crafted a decent ending, which this type of movie has almost never been able to pull off before. INVASION was cheap, simple, and at times slightly blah, but overall I dug it.",1342483200,,4469,4.481572481572481
2967715,5,B000WEVGH0,So I just finished watching this on Netflix and I love the movie. Okay and with that said I can give you the rest of the truth and few tips for making this film watchable. So the first time I attempted to watch this I completely blew this off as another terrible low budget film. I have to admit that I am a horrible stickler for bad production values and acting but this film made up for it in atmosphere. Okay so the intro is horrible even unforgivable. After a couple of tries I managed it and got to the heart of the film and I was hooked. Yes there are a few weak points in the film but many of them can be easily over looked. Except for the intro and the ending since its the same green video. Special effects are weak but if you have a great imagination it might not be a big deal. Pacing might be a big deal but over all it adds to the film since this film's strongest point is the atmosphere it creates. As for the way the infected act they could be more menacing but I guess u can shrug it off as the monsters being too confident. Okay so if you are going to watch this film I suggest you watch it alone and at night maybe after 12a.m. The later the better since it will help with the atmosphere of the film. I might even suggest skipping the green vid intro and the green vid ending since these are the worst parts. I found myself going back to the intro to understand what I was watching. So this is up to you. Over all the film was not that bad the ending left a little more to be desired but over all they did a decent job.,1340668800,2,1537,3.9773462783171523

Second, A LOT of the time is dead time, with nothing happening; that amount of time could have been cut down, or better yet, additional material added. Third, I kept hoping that the foul-mouthed, self-centered bimbo was going to get it.",1311552000,2,607,4.96078431372549
2967718,3,B000WEVGH0,"INVASION is an experiment in SciFi and Horror that reintroduced the ""found-footage"" film years before CLOVERFIELD or REC. It is entirely unique in that it tells its story in a single, continuous shot that is taken from the dashboard camera of a police cruiser. Deputy Brick is dispatched to investigate a meteor landing. Upon arrival, it is learned that the meteor is host to a parasitic alien, which begins infecting anyone it comes in contact with deep within the remote state park. What is most interesting about this shooting style is that it forces the viewer into a first-person account of the events, while offering a variety perspectives as different characters enter the vehicle and assume the role of the narrator. INVASION'S greatest strength also becomes its greatest weakness, in that the static camera is strictly focused on the road the entire duration of the film while the characters exchange dialog over the radio. Conceptually, this is a brilliant move in securing the film's integrity, but the average viewer is not likely to be entertained by watching an hour of actionless driving on an empty road. It does manage to successfully create a large-scale invasion on a non-existent budget, however, and is an interesting watch for SciFi fans.

[...]

I sure hope Pyun uses what he figured out from this film to make another one-shot movie.
Invasion needs to be viewed at night without interuption because the film watcher has a part to play.  Your imagination has to be intact. Invasion is not for passive film watchers expecting mainstream or blockbuster movies.

It's extremely low budget, but that's part of what makes it so entertaining. I hate it when 150 mil get splashed on the screen and it fails to entertain and I'm impressed when something as inventive and clever as this entertains for pennies on the dollar.

The story unfolds in front of a police car dash-cam and relies heavily on the sound (excellent) because often nothing happens in front of the camera, which makes the concept that much more believable.  A police officer  (Brick Bardo) is cruising through his usual nightly rounds on prom night. This night just happens to have meteor showers falling on his town. There is something inside the meteors that could potentially destroy the world. Officer Bardo just happens to meet a town resident who had the misfortune to encounter whatever was inside of one of the meteors. These and more happenstance occurrences take place in front of or near the dash cam.

I've watched enough of those 'cop' shows with police officers searching and busting criminals on the hoods of their cars, in front of their dash cams,  to be able to follow a film like this without becoming impatient and the view is a lot better on Invasion. I liked that my imagination could fill in some of the mystery. But I did wish, over and over, that more could happen in front of the camera.

3202012,1,B000WEVGH0,OK so I was board and had a trial of Amazon prime and saw this movie have to say the tittle is the only good thing about it. To sum it up for anyone who wants to view it look at the cover picture that is it the entire boring movie never leaves this scene they just drive thru this forest and watch people turn to zombies. And to be honest the only way to enjoy this movie would be with several friends all high and having them lift the couch moving it back and forth while you watch it on a big screen it will make you feel like you are the driver of each vehicle. Honestly you have to be high to enjoy this flick after a few min I had to ff the I was at the end weird as hell.

3202124,1,B000WEVGH0,"After watching this I felt compelled to write a review to spare anybody else from this disaster.  The sequence of events are illogical.  The acting is poor.  The main character ""Cheryl"" inspires nothing but annoyance with her constant wailing, moaning, shreaking, crying, praying, and cursing.  There is one scientist sent to investigate the strange events and he presents nothing but poor science.  There is some life form which origin is from meteorites and first it's a bug, then a bacteria, then a viral agent, then a parasite.  It spreads from an infected host's mouth into a new host's ear canal, and it's implied that there is some collective intelligence or conciousness.  It then ""mutates.""

Even the opening and closing scenes show a small news crew that is planning on hiking into this small county in CA to get some answers.  She claims that this infection was contained by the Army with tactical nuclear strikes in the previous 48 hours.  How are any of you going to survive the radioactive fallout which can spread dozens of miles, and you are going to walk into the center of town?

Also the infected can only walk with ataxic, uncoordinated, slow movements.  The living uninfected are running away, and they are always caught.  I almost always love this found footage, home movie type genre because they feel so much more real than the Hollywood blockbuster type films, but do  yourself a favor, more than half the reviews are 1 star.

3202188,2,B000WEVGH0,"I caught this on Prime Streaming for free. It's basically a two-character improv radio drama, with a dashboard cam for a screen saver.
The concept was intriguing, and I wanted to like it. But it's only worth 2 Stars, and I'm being kind here because I'm pretty sure this was a student project.

It's only 64 minutes long, and about 15 minutes of that is the end credits, because even though this film has literally a zero budget and was just shot with a Best Buy dash cam on a dirt road, every single living person the producer ever met, lived next to, or went to school with winds up with a credit at the end.

The film doesn't really have a plot, and so there can be no ending, it just runs out of time around :45 like the two actors improvising the scene looked up from their mic's at the director and said 'I can't think of anything else to say, can you? I think we've taken this as far as it can go, we're just repeating ourselves'. Which they were.

I don't see any signs of editing here, I think they just released it uncut.

Don't even think about buying this, or even paying to rent it. See it free on Streaming sometime when you can just leave it on as background noise for doing the laundry.

I'm feeling generous so I'll give it 2 Stars for the radio-drama concept, but I understand why others give it only 1 Star.

Hope this is helpful, and saves somebody some disappointed expectations. Happy trails, everybody.

I think the looooong credits are just to pad out the running time (because no one would buy a :45 minute 'feature film').
For a little under an hour, we see a night time rural dirt road illuminated by a car's headlights as the vehicle moves along around 10, 15 miles an hour. The entire film consists of the lead character having an endless cell phone 911 conversation with an endlessly patient cop at the rural sheriff's office.
The dialog seems almost entirely to be ad libbed and improvised without a written script, and then never edited. It shows.

The idea is that a teenage girl is out after her high school Prom with her boyfriend, driving around a rural dirt road in the local 10,000 acre State Park looking for someplace to park and make out.
But they pass a broken down pickup truck, the boyfriend gets out to help, the truck driver attacks boyfriend in zombie fashion, and Terrified Prom Queen drives alone around the State Park's dirt roads at 10 MPH for the rest of the hour, boo-hooing to an unbelievably patient Deputy (no, I mean unbelievable in the bad way).

Gradually we learn through the Deputy that meteorites have fallen nearby and 'The Military' (cue ominous evil music) have arrived and oh by the way the Deputy is watching the town turn Zombie all around him, but he remains on the phone with 'Crying Prom Chick'. Well, OK.

A really talented director/editor might pull that off successfully if you had a really smart, clever, 'Pontypool'-quality radio script for the actors to do. I mean, an Orson Welles quality radio-theater script.
Alas, Mr. Welles being long deceased was not available at the time of filming.

So instead, an actress who really does sound 18 does an hour's worth of High School Drama Improv Workshop-quality ad libbing with the only other character, the Deputy, who's voiced well enough by a much more competent actor but he still has no real script to work with and his co-star isn't up to much besides endless boo-hooing, so this improv-session really doesn't have much of any where to go.

The visuals are simply the dashboard cam and the dirt roads. We never see any meteorites, or Zombie townie hoards running amok, or 'The Military (cue evil music again)'.",1408752000,4,3636,4.551301684532925

The police chief complaining that cellphones and hardlines were down while he was in a video display in the cop car was crap. When Jenkins walked around the truck to the cop was pretty funny. The victims seemingly let themselves get attacked. The almost full hour of the girl riding around in the cop car was excruciating and pointless. The police chief showing up in the end so quickly; I did not understand. If everybody got blown up in a nuclear blast; HOW THE F DID THE VIDEO SURVIVE!!! and in such great ""high definition"". The girl reappearing after the blast was very puzzling. Also, this movie had 16 minutes of credits for a cast of about six and crew of about 20.

Honestly, the ""hypnotic road"" was a good idea, but the movie should have had more thrills and surprises along the route. I guess all the folks that gave this three or more stars are into dirt roads.",1374537600,,1100,4.41871921182266

3202207,3,B000WEVGH0,This is an interesting idea. Basically done in a 'blair witch' ripoff format. Alien invasion with a government conspiracy twist all caught on a dash cam. The main character though is a severely whiny high school girl. Screaming and cussing about everything. Would have been nice to have a actress portraying a little backbone. I would have enjoyed this a bit more if the character had been a bit stronger. Over all it is just someone driving back and forth for an hour on a deserted road. The general story was a cool idea but I would have fleshed it out a bit more and thrown in just a little action. All the action happens off camera you only get to hear it. Shoot the story actually holds you enough to get to the end. It is really like an old 40's radio show. Worth the 'listen' don't really even need to watch.,1371945600,,815,4.333333333333333
3202208,1,B000WEVGH0,"As previously mentioned the credits take up a third of the film. Why you would want to be credited on this is beyond me. It starts with a neat idea, a ""bug"" brought down on meteorites infecting a small town. What you get instead is a cop car dash-cam being driven back and forth on the same one mile stretch of dirt road a seemingly infinite number of times. After being driven for a short period of time by an uninteresting police officer, the car is taken over by a hysterical teen girl. Literally the entire movie is driving back and forth on the same short dirt road at night. A GoPro and a flashlight could have created a better film.

People have pointed out that you need to use your imagination to really get into the film. While I agree that a well planned plot twist that leaves the viewer with a bit of ambiguity can make a film. What the film should not do, is make the viewer imagine it in its entirety. At this point all you have is a premise not a full fledged movie. I love bad horror movies and enjoy a lot of low budget works. Unfortunately, this was not one of them.",1371513600,,1085,4.1913875598086126

3202210,2,B000WEVGH0,"This is not a bad film. Interesting concept (alien invasion) presented through the eyes of a single character. It has a few good moments as well as some stupid ones. In spots the time frame is very compressed. The biggest problem I had is that the main character does some extremely stupid things every now and then and there is no explanation offered. The other problem is that the film is short, just 65 minutes. The producers make up for that by including over 15 minutes of credits. I'm not sure if the actor's pets were credit because after a while I was zoning out.

Watch at your own risk.",1368403200,2,596,4.418181818181818
3202211,4,B000WEVGH0,"I want to say upfront that I'm a sucker for found footage movies. While I usually come away from them dissatisfied (the nature of the found footage story pretty much guarantees the ending is going to be non-existent no matter how much awesomeness came before), I still can't help myself. There's something very intimate and honest about the format. Also, I'm always on the lookout for new and interesting ways to tell a story, and I think the found footage format is really open to those possibilities. With that in mind, I watched this movie, INVASION, that my aunt loaned me.

INVASION (aka INFECTION) is a 2005 movie from director Albert Pyun, a man who, I've read, is considered on par with Ed Wood, but who, in my opinion is responsible for some unheralded classics (THE SWORD AND THE SORCERER, the disastrous 1990 version of CAPTAIN AMERICA, 1991's DOLLMAN). The premise of the movie (written by Cynthia Curnan) is that an alien invasion has taken over a small, isolated town in the middle of the night. We see the action taking place solely through a police car's dash-mounted camera. That was all my aunt had to say, I was sold.

The story starts with Deputy Bardo riding out to where a meteor was reported to have fallen to the ground. Along the way he passes a man with a broken down truck, for whom he calls a tow truck. Then he passes a couple parked in the woods after that night's high school prom, whom he comments to himself he'll ""rouse"" on his way back. When he gets to the scene of the call, at first he has a hard time finding old man Jenkins, the local who called in the crash, but when he does find him, the man attacks the deputy and we see something black and snakelike wriggling into the deputy's ear. From there he goes back to the prom couple and attacks the boy, but the girl, Cheryl Cooper, gets away by hopping into the cop car and taking off.

Cheryl contacts Deputy Ben who, along with Dr. Franks, tries to figure out what's happening to their town. Cheryl, however, is trapped in the park where Deputy Bardo had found them. One end of the road through the park is a dead end, while all the roads out have been blocked, first by the now-infected tow truck driver, then by Deputy Bardo and Old Man Jenkins.

As Cheryl's desperation level gets higher and higher, things back in town are also getting worse. Deputy Ben and Dr. Franks split up to check out the town, but only one of them comes back and Cheryl starts getting conflicting stories about what she should do: stay in the car or hide in the woods. Considering the circumstances, neither idea sounds all that great.

INVASION is a very small, simple movie. With the only camera being mounted on the dash of the police cruiser, a good deal of what we hear plays into the tension and suspense. Jenny Dare Paulin plays Cheryl and she does a decent job. A little over-dramatic in a few spots, but considering for 90% of her screen time she's just a voice, she pulls it off ok.

INVASION is not without flaws, however. There are a couple of spots when Cheryl begins hallucinating that she sees multiple ghost-images of herself approaching from the woods. That would be fine, except we're seeing the action through a police cruiser's camera, and we see the hallucinations, too. Ghostly images of Cheryl in her prom dress, coming closer, then fading away to nothing. The camera shouldn't have seen that.

Also, since most of the action is just Cheryl driving down one dirt road after another, trying to find a way out of the park, the action lags quite a bit in several places. INVASION is a good movie and it's well-done, but it also opens itself up several times for you to check the clock. And while the movie officially runs 81 minutes, the story itself only runs about 68. There's a very very lengthy credit sequence at the end. Which means that, in 68 minutes, this story couldn't keep me interested enough even for an HOUR without making me want to see how much was left. That's not good.

Still, though, it was a good movie and I'd certainly watch it again. The plot is anything but original, but it's such a tried and true one that it still works, even though I've seen it a hundred times. And I don't care what people say about Albert Pyun, I like his movies, and INVASION is no exception. Hell, he even crafted a decent ending, which this type of movie has almost never been able to pull off before. INVASION was cheap, simple, and at times slightly blah, but overall I dug it.",1342483200,,4469,4.481572481572481
3202212,5,B000WEVGH0,So I just finished watching this on Netflix and I love the movie. Okay and with that said I can give you the rest of the truth and few tips for making this film watchable. So the first time I attempted to watch this I completely blew this off as another terrible low budget film. I have to admit that I am a horrible stickler for bad production values and acting but this film made up for it in atmosphere. Okay so the intro is horrible even unforgivable. After a couple of tries I managed it and got to the heart of the film and I was hooked. Yes there are a few weak points in the film but many of them can be easily over looked. Except for the intro and the ending since its the same green video. Special effects are weak but if you have a great imagination it might not be a big deal. Pacing might be a big deal but over all it adds to the film since this film's strongest point is the atmosphere it creates. As for the way the infected act they could be more menacing but I guess u can shrug it off as the monsters being too confident. Okay so if you are going to watch this film I suggest you watch it alone and at night maybe after 12a.m. The later the better since it will help with the atmosphere of the film. I might even suggest skipping the green vid intro and the green vid ending since these are the worst parts. I found myself going back to the intro to understand what I was watching. So this is up to you. Over all the film was not that bad the ending left a little more to be desired but over all they did a decent job.,1340668800,2,1537,3.9773462783171523

3202214,1,B000WEVGH0,"OK, if you take into consideration that it's a very low-budget sci-fi movie, then the film is pretty passable about a meteor shower containing organisms that turn people into puppets of alien parasites. Having taken the low budget into considertation, there are a number of shortcomings to the movie. First, it's a one hour film, followed by 20 minutes of credits---WTF? Second, A LOT of the time is dead time, with nothing happening; that amount of time could have been cut down, or better yet, additional material added. Third, I kept hoping that the foul-mouthed, self-centered bimbo was going to get it.",1311552000,2,607,4.96078431372549
3202215,3,B000WEVGH0,"INVASION is an experiment in SciFi and Horror that reintroduced the ""found-footage"" film years before CLOVERFIELD or REC. It is entirely unique in that it tells its story in a single, continuous shot that is taken from the dashboard camera of a police cruiser. Deputy Brick is dispatched to investigate a meteor landing. Upon arrival, it is learned that the meteor is host to a parasitic alien, which begins infecting anyone it comes in contact with deep within the remote state park. What is most interesting about this shooting style is that it forces the viewer into a first-person account of the events, while offering a variety perspectives as different characters enter the vehicle and assume the role of the narrator. INVASION'S greatest strength also becomes its greatest weakness, in that the static camera is strictly focused on the road the entire duration of the film while the characters exchange dialog over the radio. Conceptually, this is a brilliant move in securing the film's integrity, but the average viewer is not likely to be entertained by watching an hour of actionless driving on an empty road. It does manage to successfully create a large-scale invasion on a non-existent budget, however, and is an interesting watch for SciFi fans.
