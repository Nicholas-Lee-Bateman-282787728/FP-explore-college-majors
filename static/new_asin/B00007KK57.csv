1817705,4,B00007KK57,"I live a mile or two from Hollywood Forever and enjoy biking or roller blading through every month or so.  (Our toddlers loved climbing around the De Mille mausoleum, seen in the film).  This film really captures the feeling of being there, how it varies with time of day or special events.  The filmmakers have some of the fond bemusement and objectivity of Erroll Morris films like ""Gates of Heaven.""  Sometimes it seems a little too long, but many scenes and juxtapositions are really a pleasure to watch.",1193270400,,508,4.738636363636363
1817706,4,B00007KK57,"If you have ever read Evelyn Waugh's satirical novel The Loved One or seen the film adaptation of the novel you will find the documentary The Young and the Dead interesting.  It seems that Mr. Waugh's satirical view of the funeral and cemetery business in the US is now a reality.  This documentary, part of the HBO's America After Dark series, takes a look at the transformation of the run down Hollywood Memorial Cemetery into the Hollywood Forever facility.  Just when you think they could not come up with a new spin on the inevitable, the death industry comes up with a new gimmick.  At the hands of its owner, Tyler Cassity, this ongoing tribute to dying is a continual work in progress.  The film makers, Robert Pulcini and Shari Berman, do a great job of showing how much death is part of life in America.  Apparently Mr. Cassity's family is in the corporate cemetery business and own Hollywood Forever and other cemeteries in the Unites States.  What is endearing about this film and Tyler Cassity is that they care about the people, both living and dead, who make up day to day life at Hollywood forever.  But the whole time I watched this documentary I kept thinking of Rod Steiger as Mr. Joyboy in the movie version of The Loved One.  I thought the most interesting part of this film was when it focused on the cemetery's previous owner, Jules Roth.  The film's only failing was that there wasn't enough footage of the run down Hollywood Memorial Cemetery and I would like to have seen more information on the corporate cemetery business in the US.  As they say, ""Only in California.""  This one is worth seeing.",1124409600,3,1623,4.616724738675958
1817707,4,B00007KK57,"The plot (if there is one) involves a young man named Tyler Cassity and his attempt to transform an overgrown, sorry excuse for a cemetery into the now beautiful Hollywood Forever. Mr. Cassity moves in a crack group of media savy professionals as his management team and they merge business savy, public relations expertise, and a hefty tranfusion of $$$$ to turn this cemetery around and make it a viable financial venture. They brainstorm new ideas and implement them and you realize that this business is like any other except it is very well run and the management team appears to have a better grasp on the situation at hand then most large corporations these days. The whole story sounds remarkably hokey at times and is reminiscent of a Judy Garland/Mickey Rooney 'let's put on a show' flick on a certain level. However, this is all for real and in spite of
some too cutesy interviews and a couple of oddball participants, the viewer really starts buying into this cemetery of the future concept where memorials are stored in video kiosks and the cemetery becomes the backdrop for a variety of activities that include  not only funerals, but other activities such as concerts, parties, and picnics as well.
I'm not certain if I would have bought into this as readily if I had not visited Hollywood Forever before and after its transformation, but I was extremely impressed with the changes I saw. None of the concepts implemented seemed weird when you experience them firsthand.
The entire dvd was engrossing and contained all the essential elements: humor, pathos, romance, tragedy, comic relief, and even some subtle fun poking. The end result is that dying doesn't seem so bad if you're guaranteed a nice resting place at HF with the stars.",1051747200,8,1750,4.852842809364549
1817708,4,B00007KK57,"""The Young and the Dead"", part of the HBO series ""america undercover"", shows a twist to a side of life all of us have yet to deal with. Very reminiscent of the quirky ""Six Feet Under"" which would follow a year or so after,
Once in disrepair, forgotten, and ready for the scrap heap, Hollywood Memorial Park gets a wonderful chance at life again with the resurrection powers of Tyler Cassity, wunderkind of the funeral business. Bringing on a team of visionaries, they not only save the cemetery, but create new ways for loved ones to remember their dearly departed.
You get from watching this DVD the sense of honor and pride that the staff at the cemetery has at their missions in life. It honors the history of the place, while helping to bring it into the twenty-first century. Featuring people's stories brings to  life the video, especially the internment of Hattie McDaniel,who was denied a spot their fifty years ago because of the color of her skin.
I wouldn't recommend purchasing this DVD. It wouldn't be something I'd watch again and again. But I would recommend a viewing of this simple, kind documentary.",1048118400,5,1117,4.728205128205128

7977427,4,B00007KK57,"Beguiling documentary about the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, final resting place for many screen legends.  The film was made by the talented team of Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini, who went on to make the superb ""American Splendor"", and the underrated ""Cinema Verite"".

Bought out of bankruptsy by handsome, charming and thoughtful Tyler Cassity, we watch Tyler and his surprisingly young group of friends turn the aging, historic burial spot into a sort of surreal cemetery of the future, including video documentaries about those planning to be buried there, made before their deaths with their involvement, to be forever available on the internet, and at video kiosks in the cemetery proper.  As one of the entrepreneurial partners acknowledges, its sort of the ultimate play on Andy Warhols dictum that everyone will be famous for 15 minutes.  But in this variation, you're not alive anymore when it happens.

The film smoothly skates between tones  one minute satiric, the next surprisingly touching, walking a fine line of admitting how odd and eccentric many of its subjects are, without ever feeling cruel in its humor.

In the end, if not quite a great film (its too episodic and unfocused to build up much emotional power), its always entertaining, often funny and occasionally quite thought provoking.",1465344000,,1321,5.202830188679245

7977430,2,B00007KK57,"This film changed my look of disbelief into a frown.  Definitely considered turning it off.  It got boring after a while & I didn't want to Learn anymore about the new ""revamped"" (not ""renovated"") ""Hollywood Memorial Cemetery"".  Appears to have been purchased/revamped by Disney...RIP Walt.  You cannot only watch videos of your dear departed one's life, but I swear there're those little boxes w/short habitat descriptions in front of each cage...oops sorry...I mean grave.  Like the ones at the zoo you need the blue plastic elephant key to turn on...

If I sound irreverent to this place of eternal rest - I am.  One of the designers rollerblades round & about.  The movie star's graves are pointed out just as in a tour & we get see videos of them in their prime.  Is this a ""iCemetery""?  We also get to meet crazed/stuck in the past/big time fans.  There's even a picnic table for them to gather at every day.

""Forest Lawn"" cemetery is shown briefly.  Truly beautiful w/white statues & well kept grounds.  If I had my choice...",1410220800,,1033,4.698324022346369
