3535468,5,B001DOM8VQ,"After falling in love with ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout, Vol. 1"", I had to try volume 2.  Again, the Steben sisters have brought a thoughtful, helpful, and much needed exercise video to expecting mothers.

I am currently 19 weeks pregnant and have been traveling cross-country for work.  I find that, while I love the toning exercises of Vol 1, the Yoga of Vol 2 really helps to relax my spine.  It also helps draw my focus into my body which goes a long way to relieve the stress of work and travel.",1218758400,18,502,4.423913043478261
3535469,3,B001DOM8VQ,"I only use this DVD if I'm low on energy. It's not very challenging and I feel like the moves are unnecessarily modified at times. I don't ever feel ""loose"" after this workout, which is my favorite benefit of yoga. Certain sequences are tougher than others, but the bottom line is that I just don't enjoy this DVD. Plus, it's only about 35 min, which when it comes to Yoga, I don't think it's enough time to really loosen up and get in a good workout.",1375747200,,451,4.255813953488372
3535470,5,B001DOM8VQ,I was starting to have a lot of back pain before I started this video but once I started doing it my back pain disappeared!!!,1374192000,,125,4.04
3535471,4,B001DOM8VQ,"I am currently in my 35th week of pregnancy and would give it a 5 stars. But it will be about 3.5 for 2nd trimester.

Background : I have been practicing yoga regularly for the past few years and fairly athletic, goes to the gym 2-3 times a week. After my first trimester, I bought a few prenatal workout DVDs to keep me fit. I rotated all the DVDs around and found The Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 2 to help me feel relaxed and stretched, for a more low-key day. It wasn't too bad, but it is something I can do at most twice a week, else it gets very repetitive.

P.S. I found Shiva Rea's prenatal DVD too slow, and only used it once and gave up (the 3rd trimester lady is practically doing nothing).

Now that I am in my third trimester, with my joints loose, backaches and tense muscles. this workout is a life saver! It is almost like a self-massage - it stretches out all the right joints and muscles. Also, this workout seems to be more difficult now for me, and so the fairly fast-pace leaves me with a nice glow after. I find myself getting a good new sleep after doing this workout. I also believe I can continue to do this for the next few weeks and would recommend it.",1362787200,,1181,4.1938325991189425
3535472,2,B001DOM8VQ,"When you put this yoga DVD in, you better know what you're doing without looking and be ready to rush. The instruction is lacking and the split screen view for beginner and advanced makes for some tough viewing. I've been doing yoga for years, and this is one of the least energizing/relaxing videos I've done--and those are two things that should be a GIVEN for prenatal yoga!!

For a feel good parental workout I prefer the Prenantal/Postnatal Workout (from Element) and Summer Sanders Prenatal Workout.",1360368000,,505,4.9411764705882355
3535473,3,B001DOM8VQ,"I used to be a Yoga regular but haven't been in awhile.  I got this video based on the reviews.  It was ok.  It is actually fast paced so you don't get the stretching you would expect.  The moves were quite easy.  I wasn't prepared to hear her tell me to ""kegel"" and didn't think that is typically a yoga move, but I went with it!",1359590400,,330,3.9393939393939394
3535474,1,B001DOM8VQ,"I just bought this video after having used volume 1 for several weeks. I really love volume 1, but practice yoga daily and so I wanted to try this video as well.  I wish I had read the reviews before wasting my money. I didn't even make it 2 minutes in. She moves so fast you have no time to even properly achieve each position and there is no time for proper breath! I pulled a back muscle almost immediately trying to keep up with her and just turned the video off. Luckily I am experienced enough in proper yoga that I can use other videos I have and modify those as needed. I'm returning this video.

EDIT:
*Wow Amazon! So I returned this item, in which I paid $24.91 for.  And upon returning it, this was the email about my refund that I received:

  Item Refund: $24.91
  Item Tax Refund: $1.99
  Return Shipping Fee Refund Deduction: ($2.98)
  Restocking Fee Refund Deduction: ($12.46)

So REALLY Amazon? A $12.46 ""Restocking Free Refund Deduction""?? What exactly is that anyways? Besides a scam and a rip off? So out of spending almost $25.00 for a product I never used, I only received an $11.46 refund. *Shakes my head*  Nothing left in the world is honest, is there? I can't even properly get my money back for a terrible product. Maybe I'll begin reconsidering even using Amazon to shop anymore.",1339200000,13,1307,4.483050847457627
3535475,3,B001DOM8VQ,"You'll get a decent workout, but I would recommend something else for the first half of your pregnancy.  This wasn't my favorite workout or video while I was pregnant, but it was a nice deviation from walking.  Personally, if I had to do it again, I'd do regular yoga for the first half of pregnancy, then add this in towards the end when it's harder to move, but of course, I'm no doctor.",1338681600,,389,4.315068493150685
3535476,2,B001DOM8VQ,"I loved the Vol. 1 DVD, so I thought that I would love this one as well.  Not at all!  This DVD moved WAY too quickly, and it didn't feel like yoga at all.  I honestly put it on for less than 5 minutes before I said ""forget it,"" and stopped.  I'm in good shape, I generally like workout DVDs and have no problem following along, even when they move quickly, but this one wasn't even enjoyable.  Stick with volume 1!!",1333756800,,416,4.08641975308642
3535477,3,B001DOM8VQ,"While overall this video offers an OK workout, I had a couple problems with it:

1. The term ""yoga"" should be considered a loose interpretation of the true word. This DVD provides what I consider a stretching workout that just draws on yoga; it's not actual yoga as there is no overall flow, a very integral part of yoga.
2. If you aren't already familiar with yoga, you probably won't be able to smoothly transition between poses or achieve correct postures, as little instruction is provided to help you do either. Sara also does not describe the few yoga postures that she calls by name, so again, if you're new to yoga, this DVD might be hard to follow.
3. Part of the lack of flow is the lack of synchronism between the movements and the breath, another integral part of yoga.
4. Sara moves extremely fast, generally due to the lack of consideration of the breath. Although I'm very experienced with yoga, I got a little confused at some parts because she moved too quickly through heavily modified movements that were unfamiliar yoga poses/movements and because I couldn't help but try to align the movements and my breath. Whenever I did, I fell behind.
5. Even the instructional part of the DVD is rushed and lacking. It just isn't descriptive enough, especially for yoga beginners.
6. The DVD abruptly ends without explaining anything about savasana. Sara gets you into a modified savasana, but leaves you hanging immediately thereafter. Again, if you aren't very familiar with yoga, this could be really confusing and strange.

Volume 1 of this series is definitely a much better workout--both physically and descriptively--in my opinion. While this one is fine as a general light workout, it's not really yoga, and it's certainly not for women who are interested in prenatal yoga for beginners.",1316649600,2,1805,4.857142857142857
3535478,3,B001DOM8VQ,"I purchased this item because I love the Perfect Pregnancy Workout, Volume 1.  It's my favorite video.  However, this video is lacking.  It has no warm-up or cool-down.  It's very difficult to follow her instruction because there is hardly any instruction. I've been doing yoga for 10 years so I don't need a ton of instruction, but I found myself having to repeatedly stop to figure out what she wanted me to do.  The workout feels disjointed and awkward.  Stick to the Perfect Pregnancy, Volume 1.  I gave it a three because it is somewhat challenging, which can be hard to find in a prenatal video, so I will probably do it again.",1312416000,,633,4.548672566371682
3535479,3,B001DOM8VQ,"Wife used this for both her pregnancies so far... late on (circa 7-8 months) she was still doing the advanced and getting bored.  If you do yoga when you are not pregnant, this might not be the best alternative, if you struggle with yoga a few months into your pregnancy then this might be for you",1310428800,,297,4.303571428571429
3535480,2,B001DOM8VQ,"I did this video maybe five times. The things I liked were the plank work for core. The set is really nice and relaxing. However even though in another part of the video menu, she goes over the yoga sequence she will be following, Sara just rushes through these sequences leaving no time to stretch the muscles. The benefit of yoga is to lengthen the muscles by holding some poses. She does these salutations really quickly. I did this with nonpregnant friends and they weren't feeling it. She just rushes too quickly through it. One particular section she does this weird downward dog to back bend thing and where you lift a leg and arm. It just doesn't feel very stable or safe and she doesn't give you time to do the exercise safely. The video overall isn't bad but I found myself tending to do other videos.",1309132800,2,811,4.486486486486487
3535481,4,B001DOM8VQ,"I'm currently 18 weeks and I've been looking for a good yoga DVD to do while pregnant.  While I don't consider myself advanced at yoga, I did it at home or at the gym at least once a week before the pregnancy.  Overall I thought the DVD was ok and the only reason I'll continue to do it is because I haven't found one (yet!) that's better.

Pros:
o The length of the DVD is pretty good -- not too long and not too short.
o The instruction was easy to follow without needing to look at the screen.

Cons:
o The pace of the DVD is a little too fast for my yoga taste.
o The ""advanced"" moves are shown in a little tiny box in the corner while the instructor does the beginner moves on the main screen.  This would have been fine with me if I agreed with the definition of beginner and advanced, but my version of ""beginner"" yoga isn't doing a sun salutation while sitting in a chair.  (Come on, really??)  I would have preferred the DVD if the ""advanced"" moves were shown on the main screen and the beginner moves shown in the corner.",1307750400,3,1031,4.125
3535482,1,B001DOM8VQ,"She goes way too fast!  I have been doing beginner/moderate yoga for years, and my body yearned for it when I was pregnant!  I needed to stretch to relieve my muscles and get pressure off of my joints.  THIS WAS NOT THE VIDEO I NEEDED!!  She moves through the moves so quickly it's hard to even enjoy the stretch.  Plus it's really short, and not all that challenging.  I had high hopes since her sisters workout was SO good!  The only reason this even gets a star is because I was able to resell it on Amazon for $20.  I would not recommend this.  For good stretching yoga that relieves the body, I use Suzanne Deason Yoga Conditioning.  Some people don't like her because she's too easy--but it totally makes my body feel better.",1306454400,3,731,4.388059701492537
3535483,3,B001DOM8VQ,I'm in my first trimester and found this DVD to be too easy. I did yoga regularly up until a few months ago (change in exercise routine) and thought this would be a good addition to my trail running. I think I'll go back to my yoga class a few days a week. This just wasn't enough for me. Maybe in my third trimester I will think differently (first pregnancy) but right now I will keep this as a relaxing weekend workout.,1304726400,,421,4.146341463414634
3535484,5,B001DOM8VQ,"I tend to have problems with mid- and lower-back pain during pregnancy. It starts earlier and earlier with each successive pregnancy. So this time I am doing yoga in the hope that it will help with that. So far it definitely helps me to relax my neck & shoulder tension and my back feels great afterwards. I am planning to continue it throughout pregnancy to help with flexibility and stretching.  I would call myself an occasional yoga practicer pre-pregnancy, and I found the Advanced versions of the moves to be a good challenge for me. So I'm not sure how much someone who is already an advanced yoga practicer would get out of it.  It's only 30 minutes long, but I consider that an advantage since I am so busy that I find 30-45 minutes per day for exercise is perfect for me. I plan to get to know the moves well enough that I can hold some of my favorite poses for longer periods before bed at night to get even more out of it.  I have no trouble with my balance at this time (I'm at the end of my first trimester, but since this is my fifth child my baby bump is closer to what a first-time-mom's would be in mid-pregnancy!), but someone who is starting this video later in pregnancy may find they need to start with the beginner poses if they have trouble maintaining their balance.  A yoga-strap is a must for this video, as well as a chair and some cushions.  Overall, I highly recommend it for a beginner or someone with some experience with yoga but not necessarily advanced.",1304467200,,1488,4.3768115942028984
3535485,2,B001DOM8VQ,"I never write reviews but I feel compelled to review this one. I'm pregnant for the second time, in my 8th month, and have been doing this DVD for a few months now. I regularly practice yoga and did prenatal yoga throughout my first pregnancy as well, both at studios and on DVD. I needed an alternate to the Shiva Ray DVD, which was good but not advanced enough for me. So I bought this and the Vol. 1. Both are challenging to follow, with the screen switching between what advanced exercisers should do vs. beginners. Also, neither lets you know in advance what props you need, so I often find myself scrambling to find what I need.

For the yoga DVD, the instructor often gives the wrong direction, screwing up right with left. And while the video is fast-paced, I worry that it's too fast for those of us who need to be a little extra careful about overstretching, balancing, etc.

Perhaps my biggest concern is all the moves done on one's back toward the end of the video. Every OB/GYN, book and exercise instructions I've heard or read caution pregnant women to avoid being flat on their backs for any length of time after the first trimester. I think it's careless and perhaps dangerous to have pregnant women doing pelvic tilts/bridge and baby cradle.

Pregnancy is short and fitness is important. Don't waste your time or money on this DVD. There are better ones.",1302739200,2,1372,4.569105691056911
3535486,4,B001DOM8VQ,"I love yoga, so I was excited to see that the Perfect Pregnancy Workout had a video dedicated to yoga. I enjoy the workout and find it very relaxing and rejuvinating even though when you're done you feel like it definitely worked. It's a great pair to Volume 1 and lets you stretch out those muscles you used in the strength training dvd.",1301443200,,338,4.380952380952381
3535487,1,B001DOM8VQ,"I am 6 months pregnant and trying to do this yoga workout and the problem is this: The beginner position gets a full screen of the instructor doing the moves, but the advanced gets a tiny little square in the corner of the tv. I am not a beginner to yoga but it was difficult for me to follow. Also they kept going back and forth with fast shots and only showing the beginner in cycles of many different moves. Adding is the fact that my balance is already off bcs I am pregnant it was annoying to keep looking in the bottom corner of the tv, it kind of threw me off balance. Also she keeps saying left leg even in cycles when she is using her right leg. It's very difficult to hear her as it is, her voice is barely a whisper and it has an accent so this added to the constantly moving screen shots and tiny advanced square made it very difficult to follow. And the last thing I need when I am 6months pregnant is to be annoyed. I would not recommend this product.",1298851200,,965,4.08421052631579
3535488,5,B001DOM8VQ,"I am very happy with my purchase of Perfect Pregnancy yoga.  I've been doing yoga for about 1.5 years 1-2 times per week. I stopped going to my regular class at about 4 months.  Within a few weeks, I could begin to feel the aching in my lower back. I purchased this video and it really helps.  I do a mix of the beginner and advanced moves and I get a good workout.  They don't call out the positions by the yoga names so it took me a few times to get the sequence down but now I have no problems. I will definitely keep doing this video after the baby comes when I can't make it to class.

In other reviews, people complained about the video quality.  It's not as good as regular tv shows but takes nothing away from the actual workout.",1297814400,,737,4.083333333333333
3535489,5,B001DOM8VQ,"I never buy any exercise DVD's because honestly they would just collect dust, but being pregnant for the first time motivated me to keep an exercise routine. I decided to buy the Perfect Pregnancy Workout-Yoga (PPW) along with the Summer Sander's prenatal DVD and I found myself doing the PPW every week. I used the Summer Sander's DVD two times at the most and that was it. This yoga workout was excellent, it helped me relax and most importantly it alleviated my lower back pain. I did this exercise routine until the very end of my pregnancy and I believe it helped me cope with my labor- I wanted a natural birth with no pain meds(I also bought the Pink Kit birthing guide to achieve the natural birth I was hoping for). My son was born in September and currently I only have 10 lbs to lose to return to my normal weight (I gained about 28 lbs during my pregancy). In the end it all depends on what style of workout you prefer and for me this yoga workout was exactly what I needed, I like it so much that to this day I still use the DVD whenever I have the chance.",1288915200,2,1069,4.245098039215686
3535490,5,B001DOM8VQ,"This is such a great workout- much more challenging than most prenatal workouts. I think it'll even be good after I have the baby.

I highly recommend it to pregnant mamas who did strength and resistance training pre-pregnancy.",1274313600,,227,4.973684210526316
3535491,4,B001DOM8VQ,"Typically, I like to practice yoga for at least 1- 1 1/2 hrs. While I think that the routine itself was strong, I would have liked to have held the poses for longer--which engages the muscles longer. I feel that you do not get the benefits of the pose when you move this quickly, and likewise that you do not get the full benefits of yoga by having such a short practice. But I think that this routine would be suitable for people of varying levels of experience, but its not really for a hard core yogi.",1270425600,,504,4.206185567010309
3535492,2,B001DOM8VQ,Have been doing intensive yoga now for several years. Was looking for a more moderate version during my pregnancy. This yoga flow is nearly 2 hours long - way too long for me when I am tired! And very repetetive. I now just go to the last 20 minutes and complete some of the stretches good for pregnancy.,1269475200,,304,4.258620689655173
3535493,3,B001DOM8VQ,"I bought this DVD because I wanted a prenatal yoga workout that was more challenging that the Shiva Rea prenatal yoga workout, which felt too gentle. I also bought it because I love ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout Vol. 1"" by Sarah's sister Karyne.

It's not bad. It certainly is more active than Shiva Rea's, as I hoped. But I tend to compare both the yoga DVDs to classes I've taken in the past that were led by good instructors, and I just don't feel as stretched out and relaxed with these DVDs as I did with the yoga classes. But the instruction is pretty good and I would probably buy it again anyway.

On the other hand, I would highly recommend the Vol. 1 workout. I owe the shape I'm in and my energy level to that DVD. I even regained definition in my arms and legs that I had lost.",1268870400,8,790,4.225165562913907
3535494,4,B001DOM8VQ,"No worries there are no handstands or acrobatics in this video! Just a workout centered on stretching and Yogic moves. I did workout before pregnancy. This is my second pregnancy, during my first I did water aerobics and walked. This is not an option with a toddler at home in the winter. I have other prenatal yoga dvds and workout videos. Most of the Yoga dvds for pregnancy are to melodic and I feel like falling asleep half way through by the fourth time I do it. I read a lot of negative reviews about this video and almost didn't buy it. But I noticed that even in the critical reviews they said they would keep on doing the workout. This is the most controversial DVD I have ever bought, and I am glad I did get it. If you are doing your workouts using instructional videos you know that no matter how hard or fast it is by the 5th time you do it you will have it practically memorized, so I find her quickness in routine a plus. Once I have done this workout a few times I won't be board or fast forwarding through long pauses or explanations. Also there is an instructional section that goes over most of the sections people complained about in slow motion. I am not athletic, flexible, or even in shape, just healthy and I was able to do the advanced moves 80% of the time. Also I have done or seen  a version of  2 out of 3 of the exercises on this video. The new exercises where great and I am glad I did them. This is different from traditional Yoga videos so it is a good by to mix it up a little. The only exercise I will not do is the back bend but I just do the set up for it. The only people who might not want to try this video are those with some kind of chronic health problem, the obese, anyone with a truly at risk pregnancy, the lazy and unmotivated or those who are easily frustrated.

I am not very experienced in yoga but I am a pretty active and physically fit person.  This DVD seems just right for me.  It's challenging, relaxing, and fun.  I have tried a couple other prenatal yoga DVDs and found that they were too easy and focused too much on relaxation when I wanted somewhat of a workout.

It takes a few runs through the workout to get comfortable with some of the routines Sarah leads you through.  Every exercise has an advanced and beginner modification.  I'm still working on perfecting the swooping push-ups!  Those are great!

I'm in my eighth month and this is the exercise routine I do most frequently now, as fatigue has started to discourage me from more aerobic exercise.  Plus, the yoga really helps with some of my aches and pains.  I'd recommend this DVD for any stage of pregnancy.",1266105600,2,1057,5.462962962962963

The yoga is great because it's relaxing and stretches you out, but you're still active and actually working out.  Instead of just breathing which alot of yoga tapes are.  It has 2 levels which makes it more challenging.  It's fast pace and definately gets the job done.  It's more relaxing than the first video, and a little shorter, but still effective.  Also, makes a big difference in balance and flexability.  Plus, it helps you focus on breathing.  All very important for the big day!!!",1265068800,,561,4.606060606060606

Most of the video is spent warming up. The poses are rushed and poorly explained. It seemed right as it gets challenging the cool down portion of the video begins and the video is over. I'll keep using the video but I'll use it as warm up to a jog or walk. I would only recommend this if you are familiar with yoga and looking for a relaxing stretch to do for thirty minutes.",1257379200,2,585,4.27027027027027

There is none of the slow and gentle, peace and love inducing ethos of other pre natal yoga tapes in this one.  It is fast-flow movement the whole way through...nearly more dance than yoga.  If you are going for this work out it is most likely a good idea to all ready be in great shape and very flexible.  I thought that I was pretty healthy until I popped in this DVD.  I had to modify some of the poses, even at 15 weeks, because they just didn't seem safe (one-arm back bends).  The upside is that I was so sore afterward that my hubby took pity on me and booked me in for a fantastic pre-natal massage.  I am still doing the work out, but only after a warm up from another tape...this one is zero to sixty in about 2 seconds (no warm up), and I have to take it slow and substitute some of the moves.

3535501,5,B001DOM8VQ,"I have tried quite a few exercise routines during this, and my last pregnancy. I have always been disappointed by either the lack of pregnancy in the demonstrators, and therefore lack of understanding, or the lack of exercise.
The presenter, Sarah Steben, is definitely pregnant, and it shows not only on her body, but in the exercises she is proposing for you. Some of them are a little advanced, but all of them have beginner stances, so no matter what phase you're in, you can modify the workout for yourself.
The exercises help stretch muscles you never knew you had and I found that the next day, I was a little sore. Most of the exercises feel more like stretches than strength training, but it really gives you that boost, and you don't even know it!

I was relatively fit before and during my pregnancy and it was a challenge keeping up, however, I did some modified movements and I managed. The instruction and setting was fantastic..not to mention watching her do these moves at an advanced pace...wow! Again, this is not a DVD for a novice exerciser.",1246233600,3,562,4.91578947368421
3535503,4,B001DOM8VQ,"These work out videos are great, I have vol 1 and 2.  There are not a lot of extra features, but the workout is not boring and 70 minutes seems to fly by.  You might need to use the pause button a bit, as they both tend to move on to the next thing fairly quickly, and I have trouble keeping up.  It is definitely a workout, you will feel it, even if you follow the beginner level.",1238976000,2,381,3.858974358974359
3535504,3,B001DOM8VQ,Her accent and voice is very soft sometimes its hard to understand until you've listen to it a few times but I think its still a good workout. I've always worked out regularly so I do her advanced exercises.,1236556800,,207,4.333333333333333
3535505,2,B001DOM8VQ,"This DVD had good reviews, I wanted something that would stretch and relax and do some work too, however, I found this video to be very difficult to follow and I've practiced Yoga for years.  I am just beginning my second trimester with my first child.  I feel that the instructor moves way to quickly between positions, and it's constantly bouncing back and forth between modifications.  I couldn't keep up and was very disappointed. The moves and poses look wonderful, but she doesn't give you the chance to move thru them and keep up.  I found Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rae to be wonderful!",1235088000,3,592,4.663461538461538
3535506,2,B001DOM8VQ,"I really don't want to give a bad review, but unfortunately have to.

I am now 20 weeks into my pregnancy, and still work out regularly (jogging, swimming, pilates, yoga, dance...all of which I did previously). I bought this DVD in conjunction with The Perfect Pregnancy Workout 1. Considering the fitness experience of the instructor (former acrobat for Cirque) I hoped that it would be a challenging workout that adhered to the safety needs of a pregnant woman. I was disappointed.

While safety is definitely addressed (in the intro), the workout is lacking. Instruction during the workout is poor and the yoga moves lack flow and organization. Beginners would have trouble following the workout, while advanced exercises will fail to find this much of a workout.

Unfortunately, I would not recommend this dvd. If you are wanting to try out one of the Perfect Pregnancy series, Volume 1 is a better purchase.",1232928000,34,912,4.9868421052631575
3535507,2,B001DOM8VQ,"I've been doing yoga for about 5 years.  During my last pregnancy and now this one I've been using a ""regular"" yoga DVD and just modify when I start getting bigger.  That's worked well, but I wanted a shorter video for days I can't do a full hour.  It would have been more beneficial to save my money from this and just do half of my normal routine.

The good: The look of it is nice. The setting is pleasant and there is light pleasant music.  She's pleasing to watch. I think it might offer good relief at the very, very end of pregnancy when you can't do much else.

The bad: I was hoping to find a 30 min. workout that would work me.  The majority of this is ""warm-ups"" (not sun salutations that are a work out themselves).  It takes very little athletic ability to do even the ""advanced"" portions.  Also, there is very little to no flow between the moves.  She doesn't explain the movements well, so it's important to watch it once without doing the workout.  I'm sure that's not that big of a deal if you do this enough to commit it to memory.",1231718400,4,1049,4.221105527638191
3535508,5,B001DOM8VQ,"First, a little background of who I am. I am a fairly athletic woman at the end of my second trimester. I was totally unable to workout during my first trimester because I was so very sick. When my second trimester started I felt much better and started looking for some good pregnancy workout DVDs.

I bought four pregnancy yoga DVDs: ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout, vol. 2:Yoga"" with Sarah Steben, ""Prenatal Yoga Complete"" with Mary Pappas-Sandonas, ""Prenatal Yoga"" with Shiva Rea, and ""Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga"" with Jennifer Wolfe. Here's my comparison:

The Perfect Pregnancy Workout, vol. 2:Yoga:
Great workout! The one negative I found is also it's positive: it was *a bit* challenging to follow the first time through and I had to do it a few times before I really got it down, but I call this a positive because it has much more interesting moves and poses than the other DVDs. Even though I had to take some time to learn something new, I found it to be really worth it. After doing a few times I was finally able to let go of the pregnancy tension I've been holding in my calves, hamstrings and lower back! It's a very energizing take on yoga and when I was done I felt extremely relaxed and tingly.

Prenatal Yoga Complete:
How can I say this kindly? This was definitely NOT the DVD for me. I purchased it because it seemed like it was giving a lot of value for the money, with ""over 8 routines for each trimester"", but they didn't mention how boring those routines were. I know that Iyengar yoga is supposed to be slower-paced, but I literally fast-forwarded through long sections of the workouts without missing anything. My husband walked through while I was doing this and scoffed, ""is that supposed to be a workout?""

Prenatal Yoga:
This DVD is so popular and I can see some really great things about it: the set is beautiful, there's high production value and she gives a solid, beginner's workout. It is not my cup of tea because although there's a meditative feel to the DVD she NEVER STOPS TALKING. EVER. I also found it to be too gentle, but that's just my opinion.

Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga:
A pretty good, fast-paced workout. I enjoyed the moves, but I think that newbies would have a very hard time getting into some of the positions. For example, she does full sun salutations without accounting for the fact that many people lack the mobility to move their feet from downward dog to warrior without modification. She was also pretty chatty and the set was also uninspired, in a small room which reminded me of Jack LaLane circa 1976. I think I'm revealing my age here... Hmm.. I was very, very young then!

I hope this helps save you some money!",1231632000,132,2666,4.578616352201258
3535509,3,B001DOM8VQ,I loved volume one so I thought I should try volume 2.  It is ok but her descriptions are difficult to follow. I find myself having to look at the screen when I am in odd positions to see what she is doing next.  She using mostly basic yoga moves but she does not call them correctly.  I will do this workout throughout the pregnancy but not as much as volume 1.,1230249600,,362,4.0
3535510,1,B001DOM8VQ,"She goes way too fast on this DVD.  Not only does it make it difficult to follow her, but you don't get to enjoy the poses or the stretches.  It's difficult to understand her directions--so you have to watch her rather than listen.  You can't do the poses and watch her at the same time, making this DVD completely worthless.",1228003200,,325,4.383333333333334
3535511,2,B001DOM8VQ,"I bought this workout because of the great reviews for Vol. 1, but I was very disappointed.  The actual workout is only 17 minutes long.  The yoga poses are rushed.  There is no time to breath into the stretches.  There are many modified poses so that you can choose your level.  It is amazing what this woman can do with her pregnant body.  There are some unique poses that I haven't seen in other pregnancy yoga workouts.  But, I was disappointed with this purchase.  I do not want to have to pause every pose so that I can get a good stretch, and at least 30 minutes of a workout.  I don't recommend this yoga workout to anyone.  Save you money.",1226966400,8,648,4.2809917355371905
3535512,5,B001DOM8VQ,"This is a great DVD.  It moves quickly and has some original moves, so the first few times were a little difficult to follow.  But after 2 goes and one viewing of the instructional session, I fell in love with it! It gets straight down to business, flows really well and provides a good level of challenge.  I feel great afterwards.  It doesn't just churn out the same old moves - the originality really adds to the enjoyment.  I agree with others that the Steben sisters have great French accents and are not the least bit annoying.

It is an active workout, rather than a long slow stretch with earth mother diatribe.  If Shiva Rea drives you mad (like me!), this one is really worth a try.

This one is really worth a try.",1226188800,,725,4.358208955223881
3535513,2,B001DOM8VQ,I was looking for a more relaxed workout to ease my sore joints.  This DVD was way to much for my 3rd trimester body.  She moves so quickly that your body just can't adjust.  It left me lightheaded and disappointed that I couldn't keep up.  I prefer Shiva Rea's yoga DVD.,1224720000,2,271,4.254901960784314
3535514,4,B001DOM8VQ,"Yoga workout invigorating, but fast paced and a little difficult to follow at the beginning if you've never had a yoga class before, otherwise a great workout to refresh and revitalize",1223942400,,184,4.967741935483871
3535515,5,B001DOM8VQ,"I am often looking for a quick, but meaningful yoga workout to get myself going in the morning- and I was really thrilled with ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 2""  As someone who works out at least five days a week, I was worried that a pregnancy workout dvd might not give me enough, but I found it such a plus that this workout has both beginner and advanced levels clearly demonstrated!  It had a really nice flow, the poses, movement, and stretching kept my interest and got my blood flowing.  I think it would be suited for most at any stage of pregnancy, or even if you are not currently pregnant!",1221523200,2,606,4.392857142857143
3535516,5,B001DOM8VQ,"I truly enjoyed The Perfect Pregnancy Workout Vol. 2 for it's straightforward and well-rounded regimen and I am not even pregnant yet. It is both relaxing and energizing. Sarah Steben's inspired yoga program is something I can do before, during, and after pregnancy. Because it has two levels, beginning and advanced, it lets you develop up to another tier and it gives you flexibility in how hard you want to workout.

I do recommend going through the Instructional Section first which gives an over-through of the workout, the names of the poses, and helpful tips on how to do everything safely and correctly.

The tone of the DVD feels relaxed and real compared to so many other workout DVDs that feel like the participants are playing too much to the camera. And I appreciate not having DVD time taken up with meditation exercises, it simply gets down to business. Plus I really like the Zen garden setting with Sarah as the only participant. It feels like a one-on-one session with my own personal yoga instructor. Good stuff!",1219708800,2,1031,4.8192090395480225
3535517,5,B001DOM8VQ,"I've been doing yoga for 10 years, and during my first pregnancy I bought 6 different prenantal yoga dvds.  I didn't like any of them, for various reasons, some to easy, some to difficult, some not enjoyable, one was 25 minutes of mediatation, and ten minutes of actual yoga. I love the Perfect pregnancy workout #1, and was so excited to try this dvd, perhaps I'm a little biased and that's why I think this dvd is so great.  I look forward to it- I was having trouble getting out of bed some mornings, now I'm excited b/c I have something fun to do first thing!  The modified poses are great, and advanced poses are just difficult enough.  I also love the Steben sisters accents, seems to add to the dvd somehow.",1219622400,13,714,4.386363636363637
3535518,5,B001DOM8VQ,"I tried Perfect Pregnancy Volume 1 which is great for strength training.  I wanted to add a Pilates or Yoga routine to my regimen.  I tried another Yoga for pregnancy DVD and was less than thrilled.  It really wasn't challenging and I needed way too many props to do everything effectively.  Not to mention it didn't flow at all! (And by the way, I've been doing Yoga off and on for a few years, but I'm far away from being advanced!)
Perfect Pregnancy Volume 2 is great because it's only about a half hour long, the exercises are challenging yet do-able, flowed nicely from positions, and best of all...very little props! :) You only need a strap (which can be substituted for a belt or tie) and a couple of pillows.  The strap is used twice and one small pillow is used for floor exercises.  The two pillows together are used at the very end for a relaxing stretch.
I really like how both of these workouts give different versions for beginner/advanced, and the instruction is very easy to follow.  And best of all, I feel great after doing them!",1219449600,6,1048,4.484210526315789
8294402,5,B001DOM8VQ,"I started this DVD the last trimester of my pregnancy. It is easy to follow and do, with advanced options for a harder workout. It is fun as well. If you do only one workout/video, do this one. A pleasure to follow and watch as well.

8294403,1,B001DOM8VQ,"This is not yoga--it is some crazy form of stretching with fast transitions that worry me for injuy-risk! I was hopeful about this workout, but it is not for me!",1440892800,,161,4.4
8294404,4,B001DOM8VQ,"I just rented this dvd for a trial run. I'm at the start of my second trimester and pretty comfortable with yoga, although not advanced. I do like that there is a beginner version of each exercise, and the poses she is doing look safe. However- I'm surprised no has has mentioned how FAST the flow of the video is! I'm watching a run through of it before trying the sequences, and I've stopped the video a couple of times now to check and make sure I don't have the playback accidentally sped up or something! It's almost comical to me how quickly she explains and then performs the poses- like everything is a fast forward cartoon. Oh well- I can see how once a person has done this video multiple times it will cut down on becoming bored or tired of the routine, but while getting the hang of it, for now all I can do is mentally pinpoint the parts where I will be pausing the video to actually get into the position she is describing- and I think there is going to be a LOT of pausing. Besides that, all looks good- she has a beautiful, strong pregnancy body that is inspiring, and the outdoors setting is nice and not at all stuffy.",1429056000,,1136,4.263888888888889
8294405,2,B001DOM8VQ,"This DVD would have been much better if they had the beginner and advanced versions in separate takes. This way it is just confusing, and she always says the beginners first. So that if you want to do the advanced versions you only get a prompt later into the exercise. She's also usually showing the beginner modification, and sometimes you can see the advanced in a little box at the bottom. I find it very uncomfortable.
The exercises themselves are OK. If you are used to doing Yoga, like me, I think you would find them confusing because they are different.

I don't recommend this video.",1426291200,,593,4.59433962264151
8294406,4,B001DOM8VQ,"Overall a really good workout video. It is pretty fast paced, but once you've done it a few times you get into the flow. Wish she's spend more time on some stretches but that's what the pause bottom is for, and wish it was longer.",1422921600,,230,4.133333333333334
8294407,1,B001DOM8VQ,"there were so many good reviews along with some bad, so i thought id give it a try, since other pregnancy yoga dvds seemed to all say the workouts were too easy.  I am not a yogi by any means, but have practiced for years, been out of practice for a about 6 months, and am 6 months pregnant.  Its not that this is too hard or too easy its that its too fast paced, not allowing for proper yoga breath or to get a good stretch or burn.  I do love flow yoga so that is not the issue, each pose is only held for a second once obtained not allowing a proper flow at all, returned!",1421971200,,575,3.8559322033898304

8294409,1,B001DOM8VQ,"I couldn't even keep up with this to finish it the first time.  I suppose what I should have done is just watch it the first time around without trying to do the exercises with her at the same time which was impossible.  Half of the time, there weren't instructions being vocalized, you should just somehow be able to watch her while simultaneously being in downward facing dog...? I should leave the disclaimer though that I am not advanced in yoga, so perhaps someone who is wouldn't have had trouble like I did.  I just did not like the pace or direction of the workout - and with many other prenatal workouts in my collection that I love, I won't be trying it again.",1395792000,,670,4.387096774193548
8294410,4,B001DOM8VQ,"I enjoyed this because it is tougher than the Shiva Rea Prenatal Yoga, but still doable (I am definitely a beginner!).

I guess it all depends on what you are looking for....if you are a ""power yoga"" Rodney Yee kind of lady.....this is the video for you, as it is fast pace as most of Rodney Yee's later yoga videos. For myself, i enjoy yoga...the Divine Union...as what the name means....being with each move and with my breath and having a nice ease of transition to the next movement. So, i had to revert back to my Rodney Yee Yoga for beginners for now......i hope this helps...have a great day (^.^)",1390003200,,610,4.504504504504505
