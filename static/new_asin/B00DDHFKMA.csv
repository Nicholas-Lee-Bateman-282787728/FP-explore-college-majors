5792789,5,B00DDHFKMA,"I watched every season of Party Of Five on Amazon! I thoroughly enjoyed going back in time and reliving the moments of this show. Although I will say they had more trials than tribulations, however, it is definitely worth reliving! I enjoyed being entertained by the Salinger's after all of these years.",1372550400,,303,4.846153846153846
5792790,4,B00DDHFKMA,"I've always been a big fan for the show, especially when it shows how much they care for each other. However, I recently just realized that this show had quite a few unprotected sex which resulted in unplanned preganancy. I'm not sure if it actually delivered good messages during that period of time.",1369180800,,301,4.69811320754717

5792794,5,B00DDHFKMA,"This was probably my favorite season out of all six seasons. Season six is a little predictable and I was a little disappointed after season five, but over all still a great show that touches on some critical topics, especially for the 90's!",1361836800,6,241,4.627906976744186

5792802,2,B00DDHFKMA,"Although I have enjoyed watching this season, there was a fault with one of the discs which caused it not to operate in my dvd player. As a result, I missed two episodes as it would not read part of the disc and continually skipped. There were no visible scratches on the disc so I can only assume that there was a fault at the time of writing the disc. Otherwise, packaging was very satisfactory and arrived earlier than previous orders have. 2 stars is only for the fault with the disc, not the quality of the television show and is not a negative reflection on amazon. Very happy with the service I have received over the last 2 years from amazon.",1418947200,,650,4.336065573770492

5792820,4,B00DDHFKMA,"The 5th Season is filled with more adult issues likedomestic  abuse and single parenting.  The Salingers seem to never have it easy in life and this season shows Charlie and Bailey at odds against each other over the care of little brother Owen, which results into a legal battle.  Despite their differences, the family always manages to love each other, which remains to be the core of this show.",1391299200,,397,4.72463768115942

5792827,1,B00DDHFKMA,"Not only do they changed the original songs on the set, but these editors were even cheap to the point of burning the epis on DVD-Rs instead of normal DVDs... Sorry, but eventhough the image quality is flawless, it can't make up for the cheap material they used. Specially on a set which is only available online. And they have the nerve to call this legal. I say, look for TVrips, at least here you will have the real thing.",1387843200,6,425,4.325

5792831,5,B00DDHFKMA,"Although I had heard of Party of Five back when it was on during the mid 90s to early 2000s, I did not start watching it until a few years after it went off the air. What a pleasant surprise this outstanding show was. The issues that the Salinger clan (and their significant others) faced were a mix of sadness and happiness. Out of all the seasons, Season 5 is definitely one of my favorites. I loved Julia's storyline this season and Claudia seems to really grow up this season and it's fun to watch how much she has evolved since the beginning of the show! The ""court case"" with Charlie and Bailey was shocking to say the least -- I think I still haven't forgiven Bailey for that one. :-) I also think Owen's storyline was done well also. You would think that watching his ""issues"" would be uninteresting but I really liked the writing and how it all came together in the end. Overall though, seeing the clothes, hairstyles, etc from the 90s brings back some good nostalgia for me. I swear they don't make good family drama's like this one anymore. It amazes me that this show started almost 20 years ago (yup, 1994 was almost 20 years ago!) but it still holds up really well because the stories are simply timeless. Thank you Amazon for allowing me to own this wonderful series on DVD. Amazon YOU ROCK!!!",1382140800,3,1308,4.431535269709544
5792832,5,B00DDHFKMA,Love this family.  The way that they stick together through thick and thin os just awesome.  It's a great show,1380758400,,110,4.45
5792833,5,B00DDHFKMA,"This review is for the DVD set of Party of Five, Season 5.

The picture quality is superb, as is the sound. The DVDs themselves (i.e., the artwork ON the discs) look great, as does the artwork on the outside of the clam shell case; a classy job inside and out for made-on-demand discs.

True, no subtitles exist for the hearing-impaired, but this is a bare bones offering (once we're talking of made-on-demand DVDs)--and it really is professional and excellent in all respects, but for the lack of subtitles and extras.

A+. Recommend.

P.S. - The plots do seem thinner as the years go by, it just seems like they're reaching for everything that they threw up against the proverbial wall. But, the actors and actresses are still attractive and likable, and the stories believable, if slightly less so; the 45 minutes for each episode really flies by, and I watch at least two episodes at a time.

(This is exactly how I felt about Season Four.)",1380067200,,944,4.62874251497006
5792834,5,B00DDHFKMA,Really enjoy this show.  True to life with typical family issues.  Love the characters.  Will watch until the end !!,1379808000,,116,4.7

5792836,1,B00DDHFKMA,I am very disappointed to see season 4 and 5 does not contain any captioning or English subtitling. I am deaf and I always wanted to see this but now I cannot.,1378512000,12,159,4.0
5792837,5,B00DDHFKMA,"So glad this dvd was finally released. This season was a fantatsic season as you see each family member moving in their own direction. And of course the Salingers facing more issues of love, loss and transition. This was such an amazing quality TV show you can understand why it won a Golden Globe Award... Looking forward to season 6!!!",1377993600,,337,4.633333333333334

5792839,5,B00DDHFKMA,"I ordered it as soon as that was possible and I loved it as much as I did when I first saw it on TV all those years ago. And today I have received the message that season 6 will be available in October. Of course, the DVD does not contain any extras, but after waiting so many years for those last three seasons to be published, I hardly care about that anymore. By October the collection will be completed and we can stop signing online-petitions.",1377561600,5,448,4.22093023255814

The music used went well with the time period, the plot lines are relatable to present issues in life. The domestic violence angle was really fun to see unwind and come to a head... Very creepy characters in this season. Ned was a real creep haha... How the kids cope will help them or harm them.....",1487721600,,469,4.280898876404494
