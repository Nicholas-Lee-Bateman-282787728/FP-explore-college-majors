3432621,4,B0019CW628,"Hitler's Children is not the best film about Nazi Germany and its politics that I've seen but it's not bad either. The plot is actually rather interesting and it moves along very well; I was not bored although there is some overacting by some of the people with smaller roles in this picture. The cinematography and the choreography are well done and the musical score works to enhance the picture. The casting was good but they should have used a few more actors with authentic German accents.

At the beginning of the film we quickly meet the headmaster of The American Colony School located in Germany, Professor Nichols (Kent Smith). Nichols loves Germany and he doesn't immediately realize the incredible danger that will result from the rise of The Third Reich. On the other hand, Nichols isn't completely unaware of the growing problem; the American school is next door to a German school; and the two groups of kids are forever fighting during recess. Two of the students are American born and partly German Anna Miller (Bonita Granville) who loves America and German born and partly American Karl Bruner (Tim Holt) who embraces the Nazi party and its ideals. Karl and Anna develop a puppy love that matures into a true love; but this is not meant to be as Germany is changing quickly under The Third Reich. Karl becomes more and more distant as he is increasingly involved with the Nazi party; and Anna goes from being a student at the American school to being Professor Nichols' assistant.

One day, unfortunately, things change. Gestapo police show up suddenly at the American school and several students are rounded up by the Nazi police--including Anna, much to the shock and dismay of Professor Nichols. Nichols tries to get Anna free but it is of no use, even his dearest friend Franz Erhart (Lloyd Corrigan) cannot help; the Nazis have taken over all power. Karl, who has begun to rise in the Nazi ranks, gets Anna a position as a staff member instead of a laborer at a work camp after she is taken from Nichols' school; but soon Karl himself has quite a conflict of interest. Karl has never really stopped loving Anna; but when his superiors want him to severely punish Anna for not escaping the camp and not being ""a good German"" in general Karl must make a hard choice.

In addition, watch for a particularly good performance from a German Bishop (H.B. Warner) who defies Nazi orders; and Otto Kruger gives a fine performance as German Colonel Henkel.

Of course, the plot can still go anywhere from here. How do things between Karl and Anna work out--she is eventually sentenced to be whipped and then sterilized by the Nazis--can she escape? Can Karl still help Anna or will he abandon her? Will Professor Nichols, always at odds with the Nazis, be able to stay out of a concentration camp? No spoilers here--watch and find out!

Hitler's Children may be overacted at times and served with a side-dish of wartime propaganda, but it also clearly sends an anti-Nazi message and the acting by the principle actors is convincing. If you're interested in the history of Nazi Germany and its effect on people's lives, you would do well to add this film to your collection. In addition, fans of the actors in this film will want to get this. I hope they release it in Region One format very soon!",1252022400,11,3310,4.7
3432622,4,B0019CW628,"By the time that the United States had declared war against Germany in 1941, most Americans knew about as much of the horrors of National Socialism as today's generation does of Jong Kim Il's North Korea.  Americans then were aware that Nazism was an evil but mostly on an intellectual level.  In HITLER's CHILDREN, director Edward Dmytryk presents an admitted propaganda piece that acknowledges the existence of evil even while understating its extent.
Kent Smith is Professor Nichols, the principal of the American School, an educational institution teaching American values in Nazi Berlin in the 1930s.  His school accepts any student who wishes to learn what he can teach.  Among his students is Karl Bruner (Tim Holt) a youthful confirmed Nazi who attends a German school adjacent to this one. Bonita Granville is Anna Muller, a German-American girl who loathes Nazism but likes Karl. The early part of the film explores the cultural differences between democracy and totalitarianism.  Karl's Nazi education causes him to leave for several years during which time he joins the Gestapo.  His future as a Nazi seems bright.  When he reappears in the late 1930s, Anna has grown to be a lovely girl who now works at the school as a teacher.  One day, a squad of stormtroopers appears to close the school.  They take Anna and other ""undesirables"" away.  At this point HITLER's CHILDREN becomes more polemic than dramatic.  Events are introduced for their propaganda power.  Characters walk on and off screen as one-dimensional puppets.  Anna is pure and brave.  Karl is torn between his love for Anna and his love for National Socialism. Karl's Gestapo mentor, Colonel Henkel (Otto Kruger) is an Oxford-trained Nazi who enjoys playing sadistic games with people's lives.  Despite this heavy-handed use of propaganda, the film has a riveting effect.  Though director Dmytryk plays down the horrors of the concentration camps and the Final Solution (such horrors were not yet well-known in the West), the viewer can readily see that cruelty and sadism has replaced the Renaissance humanism that had marked western Europe.  Today, viewers who watch HITLER'S CHILDREN under the lens of history can see that the takeover by the state of the minds of the young can result in an endless series of butcheries that are rendered no less horrific by their being understated by a Hollywood that simply did not know any better.",1252022400,9,2414,5.055555555555555

8273454,5,B0019CW628,"This film does not graphically portray the atrocities of Hitler, but the anti-fascism message is clearly there. I found the film to be the best of Hollywood's obscure hidden treasures. This flm was released in 1943. What stands out, sadly, is a similarity to oppression of today, sometimes even in this country.",1472688000,4,311,5.0
8273455,3,B0019CW628,"Hitlers Children is a really important film dealing with a topic that isn t usually covered  the racial policies of the 3rd Reich. Unfortunately the film is done so poorly it detracts from the message. The acting is exaggerated, the photography is pedestrian, and the music tends to overwhelm the story. Produced in 1943, the war was in full gear, so the film was a big hit.

Because of the success of this film, director Edward Dmytryk (1908-1999) career took off. He became known for his film noir (Murder my Sweet, Farewell my Lovely). Dmytryk was nominated for an Oscar for Crossfire (1947) and won at Cannes. He was twice nominated for a DGA award  the Young Lions (1958) and The Caine Mutiny (1954). Among the 50+ films he directed were The Left Hand of God (1955), and The Carpetbaggers (1964). Dmytryk was part of the Hollywood 10, a group of blacklisted film makers imprisoned during the McCarthy era. Despite his skills, few are evident in this drama.

Tim Holt (1919-73) plays a Nazi youth. Holt spent most of his career in B westerns, but along the way he did have a few good roles, in The Magnificent Ambersons (1942) and Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948). Interestingly enough, Holt served in WW 2 and was a decorated bombardier.

Bonita Granville (1923-88) plays an American girl imprisoned in a camp for German girls. She was nominated for an Oscar for These Three (1936) and later played Nancy Drew. She appears a little silly as the young girl but improves her performance as she gets taken by the Germans.

1943 was an OK year in films  The top grossing films included This is the Army, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Song of Bernadette, Coney Island, and Stage Door Canteen. Other notables included The Ox Bow Incident. The big Oscar winner was Going My Way, and other winners included Gaslight and None But the Lonely Heart

War films were particularly popular  Action in the North Atlantic with Bogart and Raymond Massey, Air Force with John Garfield, Bataan with Robert Taylor and Lloyd Nolan, Bombadier with Pat OBrien and Randolph Scott, Corvette K-255 with Randolph Scott, Five Graves to Cairo with Franchet Tone and Anne Baxter, and Hangmen Also Die with Brian Donlevy and Walter Brennan. All of these films are better films, per se, but the topic in this film is far superior.",1470873600,3,2300,4.71571072319202

The movie has a French introduction, but the movie itself is in English.

If you are one of the few people that does not have a multi-region DVD player this movie alone is a good justification for the purchase.",1296345600,5,304,4.716981132075472
