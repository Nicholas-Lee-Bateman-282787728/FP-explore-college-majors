2327653,4,B0009WLVIO,"My husband and I remembered this show from the '60's as 'the coolest show' from Britain. So, when I saw it available on dvd, I had to get it. Of course things are never quite like you thought they were after 40 yrs. But, except for the episode about how they got their powers, the shows are still fun. My daughter was visiting when our set arrived, and so we started watching them. She was 'hooked' and wanted to watch several episodes in a row, as often as possible, since she had to leave in a couple of days. I guess this set would be great if you remember '60's TV. For the younger generation the show might be amusing, a 'period piece'.",1229731200,2,641,4.219512195121951
2327654,5,B0009WLVIO,"I watched this series when I was a ""tween"" and I was hoping that it would be available on DVD.  Those of you who have not seen it are in for a treat.  This was the first time that I seen Stuart Damon (Dr. Alan Quartermain, General Hospital) and enjoyed his acting.",1204934400,,264,4.0576923076923075
2327655,5,B0009WLVIO,"And they were ""very different"", yet very much ""the same"". As in, the same consistent quality, the same creative genius, and the same colorful ""FAB""-ness as two other ITC series in production at the same time, (the great season of '68), ""The Avengers"" and ""The Prisoner""! And each one of these short-lived T.V. series from that long gone period in space and time, and all the cast and crew members involved in their production, and the basic premise behind them, individually and as a whole, were ""very different"" and very special indeed. So, this set was a very special treat for me to discover and then experience for the very first time! Especially after my having endured several painful months of the B.C.S.W.'s, (""British Cult Series Withdrawals""), whilst I was left hopelessly jonesin' for one more fix! However, I feel all right now, as ""The Champions"" managed to hit the spot. And for all of this plus so much more, I thank you ITC! Cheery-bye. - S->",1201564800,2,958,4.74251497005988
2327656,5,B0009WLVIO,"The U.S. version, brought to us by A&E, has only 15 episodes on it.  Thanks to another reviewer, I found the Special Edition on the British Amazon site, and purchased it as well, and have been enjoying all the episodes, the special ""movie"" with two episodes blended together, and a reunion among the three main stars of the series, Stuart Damon, Alexandra Bastedo and William Gaunt--the first time in decades.

If you aren't sure of your DVD player's capabilities of playing a Region 2 DVD, though, you might want to stick with the American version.  On your computer, however, most DVD programs will allow you to change the region code up to 4 times, and that is how I've been watching mine, although I do have a region-free player as well.  The difference in price is nominal (about $15) and there are so many more perks with the Special Edition.",1182384000,8,848,4.633333333333334
2327657,5,B0009WLVIO,"This short lived yet popular series is still hyped up about in many countries.  Stuart Damon, Alexandra Bastedo and William Gaunt are 3 agents of a Swiss based think tank ""Nemesis"".  When their plane coming back from their mission in China (in the opening episode) is shot down, they are left for dead in Tibet, until they are taken by a mysterious old man to a strange room and are miraculously cured.  That's really an understatement, they are also endowed with physical and mental powers beyond comprehension for 1968 (when it aired).  Told to keep their powers and the existence of the old man a secret, they take care of the enemy agents and get back to home base, mission successful and go on from there, much to the chagrin of their supervisor played by Anthony Nicholls. Originally an ITC product in England, when released here, it only aired as a summer replacement series in 1968 and aired only 10 episodes of the 30 made.  Then in 1983, 2 episodes (which we never saw, 1 of which being the first) were sandwiched together into a feature length story called Legend of The Champions to try to again offer it to our continent (a tad late).  Since then it has never been around until 2004 when this set was released by A&E video here and another company there, but their company released both halves and a complete set which you can still get from ""Marketplace Clients"" on Amazon UK.  However in July of last year, another manufacturer in England reissued a more complete set which includes the 30 episodes, behind the scenes goodies and ""Legend"" as well.  I have just purchased a dvd player that can player overseas discs through this Amazon and my copy of the Complete Champions just shipped today.  My advice, get a multi region capable player and this recent vintage (the one on Amazon UK that is) set. As of when mine shipped, I paid roughly $53 after currency conversion (including shipping) which is what you will probably pay for this set (shown above) here.  Get the complete deal and enjoy it.",1174867200,18,2010,4.636619718309859
2327658,5,B0009WLVIO,"Yet another fine series from Britain's ITC stable, ""The Champions,"" despite the comic book premise, was an imaginative and fairly well done series extolling the exploits of three superhuman agents who received their extraordinary physical and mental powers from a lost tribe of people in Tibet. 30 episodes were made in all and the series made its debut in the USA in 1968.

The Champions, thematically, is in the same sci-fi/spy vein as 'The Avengers,"" but taken a little more seriously than the Emma Peel episodes produced around the same time(also available in a ""Megaset""), by the three leads: Stuart Damon, William Gaunt, and Alexandra Bastedo.

While this set thru A&E is decent, I recommend purchasing the Network DVD set available via AmazonUK and in Region 2 encoding. This is the set to buy replete with director and actor interviews, PDFs of publicity materials, a feature film, commentaries, trailers, and the actors' screentest footage, among several other outstanding extras.",1155254400,29,989,5.213836477987422
2327659,5,B0009WLVIO,"I watched the Champions when it aired on US TV more than twenty years ago. The quality of the show truly struck me. Here was a spy thriller with the twist that the agents had been endowed with more than human powers. There were no supervillains, but simply evil men. The plots had more incommon with Mission Impossible than the Wild Wild West. The super powers were low keyed and the episode usually focused on a single ability, such as being able to see in the dark or the ability to remain under water for six to nine minutes.",1151798400,11,528,4.343434343434343
2327660,5,B0009WLVIO,"This set represents the first 15 episodes of a 30-episode total of the series, THE CHAMPIONS.  Stuart Damon (fresh from being Prince Charming to Leslie Ann Warren's Cinderella, and who went on to soap opera fame), Alexandra Bastedo, and William Gaunt (you'll know this BBC actor when you see him) play agents of Nemesis, an international organization of trouble-shooters based in Geneva.  They are on a mission in Red China when their plane crashes in the Himalayas.  Rescued from death by an unknown & anonymous group of people, they are endowed with special powers of strength & psychic abilities that must be kept secret, even from their boss Tremayne.

The tone of the series is similar in nature to The Saint (Roger Moore's), Dr. Who, and The Avengers; this is not surprising considering that Dennis Spooner & Brian Clemens were driving forces in all four series.  (Terry Nation wrote several of the episodes.) The twist on this show is the increased abilities, with the emphasis on the psychic/paranormal skills, which makes it a cross between standard espionage and science-fiction.  Although the late 60's wardrobe, hair styles, and dialogue are a bit dated, the series is set in the Cold War. Nemesis is a top-secret agency that can only be called in by other agencies. NATO enters in to a lot of the plots; bad guys are trying to manipulate the world. The trio tackle that which cannot be done, and do the amazing - all to the bafflement of their boss who hasn't got a clue as to how they manage it all.

The show is good, clean, enjoyable fun.  Damon is Craig Sterling, the brash American with a ready smile. Gaunt is Richard Barrett, the sober Brit with dry humour. Bastedo is Sharon Macready, the lovely female operative who can take out any bad guy on her own without getting her hair mussed or appearing less than frail. They balance well, taking turns pulling each other out of dangerous situations.

If you have ever been a fan of Dr. Who, The Saint, The Avengers, The Protectors, or The Persuaders, you are in for a treat. I had seen two episodes (poor VHS copies) prior to the release of this 4 disc DVD set.  The quality of the transfers on these discs is outstanding. I only hope A&E sees fit to release the rest of the series - and SOON!

Update:  Okay, the full series - plus some great extras - is available in PAL format.  And very much worth it.  The episodes here are not in original airing order, but this set did 'tide us over' until the full set was available!",1127865600,60,2490,4.591422121896162
2327671,5,B0009WLVIO,"I have loved the Champions since... 1969!!! I was a little kid falling madly in love with science and science fiction: watching the Moon landings live with my parents, ""Star Trek"" (the original of course) and yes, ""The Champions""!!! They were so cool, had these amazing powers, and had been to the Himalayas (I wanted to go there sooo bad!!!) where a secret civilization gave them their special, incredible powers! Richard was my favourite.

I'd looked for Region 1 dvd's of ""The Champions"" for years, and finally, I now own them.  Well, the first set anyways.  The second set MUST come out as soon as possible, PLEASE.

Anyway, my purchase went very well, and again the arrival of this purchase was very quick I'm happy to say.  All went perfectly well, no glitches.
I'm once again very pleased with Amazon!

2327672,5,B0009WLVIO,"I remember this early ""super hero"" show from the 70s.  I had just recently returned home after doing my military duty in Great Britain.  Watching the ""Nemesis"" heroes tooling around London or through the countryside brings back warm feelings I have for that country.

The quality of the packaging is excellent. The discs themselves were also excellent. I am very pleased with this product. Another excellent Monty Berman production.",1285027200,,432,5.231884057971015
2327673,5,B0009WLVIO,"I loved the Champions when it came to the U.S. in the late 60's and it was a pleasure to see it for sale in the U.S.
The only problem was that it was just half the episodes and after such a long while, I guess that is it, no second half.
I did get the British set which includes lively commentary by the stars of the show ( William Gaunt is hilarous) and
an all region DVD player so I could see all the episodes.  Well worth the trouble.  Except for some clunky electronics, the show hold up surprisingly well. It is great to see Stuart Damon, William Gaunt, and Alexandra Bastedo in this series.",1284768000,,596,4.129310344827586

2327676,3,B0009WLVIO,"Never suspenseful, clever, funny or credible, ""The Champions"" mixes never fully developed characters with interesting English settings. The 60's styles, cars and settings are nearly on par with the Emma Peel Avengers episodes but the story lines and characters are inferior. Danger Man and The Avengers would be a far better choice.",1264809600,,332,5.403846153846154

Now I have the ones I'd seen and more!  I love this series!  Now I'm bragging to my friends!",1395446400,,270,4.134615384615385
8068468,5,B0009WLVIO,"The premise is simple: Three agents of NEMESIS, an international crime-fighting organization headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, are seriously injured in a plane crash in Tibet, after completing a spy assignment in Communist China.

On the verge of death, they are taken into a hidden mountain community where their wounds are treated and they recover their strength with amazing speed, only to discover that their rescuers have given them some very unique powers as ""gifts"" and although they are not invulnerable, they are able to do things (and sense things) beyond the abilities of normal human beings.  These new powers help them to do their jobs a bit easier.

This British-made TV series was only on for 30 episodes and this collection has the first 15 of them.

I was a teenager when it premiered in the late 1960s and it is terrific to once again watch them.  I'd certainly recommend buying it, if a set becomes available to you.",1362182400,,939,4.880503144654088
8068469,5,B0009WLVIO,"Loved this old series.  Somewhat dated, of course, after all these years (some parts hopelessly so), but still brings back lots of happy memories.  Sadly, I was the only person who ever watched this show; it died without even a whimper.",1343433600,,236,4.7317073170731705

I got the Spy collection and this series was on it! I have only
watched 3 episodes and I love it. Spy meets Star Trek series!
The show is very well written and acted. I would've loved this as
a kid. How come this never ran in syndication? or did it? I
highly recommend this series for true classic tv collectors.
One of the best series ever made. Can't wait to watch all.",1301443200,,497,3.98
8068471,4,B0009WLVIO,"Featuring characters with mysterious superpowers, The Champions (1968-69) is a bit different from most of ITC Entertainment's action/adventure series produced in the 60's.  With the scope of these powers unclearly defined, watching the series is something of a learning experience, as the characters develop their powers and display new abilities.

Craig Sterling (Stuart Damon), Sharron Macready (Alexandra Bastedo), and Richard Barrett (William Gaunt) are agents working for a law enforcement agency know as Nemesis.  On their first mission in Red China, the team infiltrates a military installation and steals a vital component.  Attempting to escape, the team's plane is damaged by enemy fire, and crash lands somewhere in the Tibetan Himalayas.  The survivors are visited by an unknown race of advanced beings, who heal their injuries, and endow them with superhuman abilities.  Aided by their new powers the trio complete their mission, taking on the mantle of ""The Champions of law, order and justice"".  Returning to their headquarters in Geneva, Commander Tremayne (Anthony Nicholls) the head of Nemesis, is most anxious to hear the details of how they managed to survive, but The Champions decide to keep what has occurred their secret.

During the early episodes the trio begin to learn more about the extraordinary abilities they possesses.  Besides increased strength, and heightened senses, The Champions can communicate telepathically.  Perhaps even more amazing, their remarkable recuperative abilities even allow them to cheat death.  Some of the talents come naturally, while others like telepathy, require some practice to refine.  With their superior strength and fighting skills, it takes a lot to get the better of  even one of them.

The adventures are set around the world, and usually involve intrigue and espionage.  The series has a science fiction component, mixed with cold war themes, as the operatives are often working undercover.  There is also a fantasy element as characters return from the dead, read each other thoughts, and know when a partner is in trouble.  Besides acting as a team, it's common for Richard to go solo, while Sharron and Craig team up.  Besides various locations in Europe, The Champions find themselves in exotic places like the arctic regions, a tropical island, onboard a submarine, the Australian outback, the Caribbean, and South America.

With a moral ideal at its core, The Champions isn't particularly hip, doesn't feature a parade of young beauties, and doesn't emphasize romance or humor, except for the running gag of keeping Tremayne in the dark.  Based in Geneva, the home of the Red Cross, the city's famous fountain the Jet d-Eau, is frequently featured in background shots.  Created by Monty Berman (producer of The Saint and The Baron) and Dennis Spooner (Man In A Suitcase, Department S), the program is a bit goofy and idealistic at times, but is mostly quite entertaining, and fun look back at an era when the threat of Communism loomed large.  The musical cues provided by Edwin Astley, sound exactly like the music he provided for The Saint for many years.

Stuart Damon and William Gaunt were already in their 30's, but Alexandra Bastedo carries herself with maturity far beyond her 22 years.  Damon, an American, later went on to star as Dr. Alan Quartermaine, in the soap General Hospital for over thirty years.  Gaunt continues to act, mostly in British television.  While Bastedo, an avid animal lover, runs an animal sanctuary in her home in England.  She also continues to act occasionally, with an appearance in Batman Begins (2007) being a recent example.

The Champions ran for just one season, producing 30 episodes.  A&E's Set One contains the first 15 episodes, and includes a photo gallery as a bonus feature.  The retail price of the set ($79.95) is quite high, and apparently DVD sales have not justified releasing the remaining episodes.  Although certainly welcome, a Region 1 release of the remaining 15 episodes seems doubtful.",1296345600,,4025,5.203416149068323
8068472,5,B0009WLVIO,"I remember watching this series as a summer replacement show and being totally enthralled.  It was a British spy show and I thought the characters were so cool.  They still look very 1968-mod and the hair styles are outlandishly dated.  But it is still fun to watch as a time capsule of that era.  They had the same pocket doors that were so futuristic on Star Trek, and the dots were certainly placed close together for the audience with such ""special effects"" as the main characters holding their fingertips to their foreheads when using their ESP with each other.  The tinkling windchime sound effect also tipped us off when other special powers were being used.  If you liked The Prisoner and/or The Avengers, I think you'd also enjoy this series.",1295913600,,751,4.7384615384615385

Incredible how other distributors such as Warner or international buenavista offered for sale series and movies in dvd format with audios and subtitles up to 8 different languages. Honestly I prefer to buy the titles from Warner, Buena Vista, Universal etc, and remember, although I do not live in the U.S., or my mother tongue it isn`t English, my money is as good as anybody, and I will spend it elsewhere.",1286755200,2,682,4.5528455284552845
