8174936,5,B0009RS0E2,I'm the first to admit that I like strange little old movies. I tend to shy away from the classics and seek out odd little genre films. This one certainly qualifies. It has lon chaney jr as a high school dude trying to win the big game in order to win the heart of a girl he likes. What makes it interesting is putting a classic horror movie actor into this role. It changes the whole dynamic of hte film and turns what could have been pedestrian into something wonderful.,1153785600,,472,4.2555555555555555
8174937,5,B0009RS0E2,"This is one of the strangest and sweetest movies I've seen in a while. It has Lon Cheny Jr - the guy who played The Wolfman - as a high school athelete with a crush on a girl. He also needs to win the big game (of course) while finding a way to romance his lady. There are many funny moments, but I watched it to see the big kiss at the end. It plays like many modern high school romances, but doesn't talk about sex and is much more family friendly than most.",1148428800,,460,3.904255319148936

I enjoyed it and I know that everybody who treasures his or her undergrad days will be entertained as well.""",1146528000,,276,4.54
