8697487,5,B00S75RI8M,"Sarah Starr has created a yoga program which allows anyone at any level to enjoy a very meditative yet challenging experience.  This DVD, in particular, is so beautifully filmed that you will want to move your chair outside into the nearest stream or river!  One can stretch/work very mildly, or really push harder to get a maximum yoga experience.  I would recommend this and ALL of Sarah Starr's Happy Yoga DVD's -- I personally alternate between the chair yoga and the regular/standing yoga sessions for a bit of variety.  Every one of her programs is filmed in a beautiful natural background - never in some sterile workout gym.  Her soothing voice leads you through these sessions, and they are over before you know it, leaving you wanting more and looking forward to the next time!  My stress level and anxiety have been reduced dramatically, and I have made this a part of my daily routine since June 2014 (4 years now!).  As a woman in her mid-fifties, I plan on making this a part of my life for the forseeable future.",1515456000,8,1027,4.640883977900552

8697493,5,B00S75RI8M,"I love this DVD.  Sarah's unique combination of gentle, approachable poses and stunning videography compel me to make time every morning to follow along with one of Sarah's videos.  (This particular DVD has me questioning how she was able to keep from floating down the river!)

Sarah teaches her students to understand the correct posture and breathing techniques for each of the poses.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1474848000,7,417,5.088235294117647
