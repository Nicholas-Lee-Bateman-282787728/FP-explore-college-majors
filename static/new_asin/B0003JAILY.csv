8035945,3,B0003JAILY,"What can be said about this unknown little flick. Its not the worst killer car flick that would go to either Road Rage (casper van dien) or the ungodly  awful Dark Of The Night. My biggest problem with this flick is that they used bits of every other Killer Car movie I can think of. Obviously Duel was the biggest inspiration/rip-off but they also try the ominous air horns of The Car and fail by a long shot. The script as well as ALL the actor are annoying as hell and it took me 3 tries to watch the whole thing cause I kept falling asleep. If your a big horror buff or collect killer car movies like I do then go for it. Watch it once and add it to the collection but if your looking for another classic keep searching I would recommend The Car,Christine,Duel,Wheels Of Terror,Death Car On The Freeway or even Trucks, hell even go for the legendary camp classic KILLDOZER. 2 Newer killer car flicks I WOULD recommend are Joy Ride (Paul Walker) which I was VERY surprised has been one of my fave movies in the last 10 years or the unknown TV gem Black Cadillac which was made on a shoe string budget and turned out really well.",1211846400,3,1131,4.26046511627907
