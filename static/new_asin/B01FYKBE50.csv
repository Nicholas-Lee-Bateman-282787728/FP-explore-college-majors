This series, 'Suspects' took me a couple of episodes to understand the concept. It takes place in East London, in a dingy old building next to a train station. This is reality television. Suspects is a police procedural that was set up for an hour case of the week television. What is the most amazing is that this series has no script. There is a summary of the case delivered by the director, and from then in it is all improvised. Each character develops their role, and delivers the kind of discussion a real police team would have. This takes a lot of intelligence, bravery and the ability to think on your feet. This is a real reality show.

Fay Ripley, plays DI Martha Bellamy, she keeps this ship afloat. She is an attractive woman, married and with a child. Damien Molony, plays DS Jack Weston. He is the most irritating character of the series. He really plays by the seat of his pants, breaking the law and any ethical morals he might have to garner clues and squeeze his suspects. He should have been kicked off the squad and out of the police long ago. The problem is, he is almost always right, and he has a quick mind. Clare-Hope Ashitey, plays the junior DC Charlie Steele. She is the most intelligent of the squad, high moral and ethical values. She follows Jack, but rightfully questions his decisions.

There are six episodes, one hour a piece, all following the same case, putting clues together, piece by piece. The other characters in the series may be actors you recognize, who also improvise all their lines. This is really fabulous, but takes awhile to fully understand what is going on.

8761842,5,B01FYKBE50,"Absolutely love this series. police procedural with a twist...some of the dialogue is ad libbed. very well acted, actors seem natural rather than reading a script. what i really, really love about this series, no intraoffice romance, no focusing on spouses, or kids, just straight forward catching the bad guys. always irritates me when home situations are a part of shows.",1480118400,,373,5.131147540983607
8761843,5,B01FYKBE50,"Really enjoyed these 2 series. The characters development is noticeable & the younger members of the team seem to have ""grown up"" a bit too. Excellent acting by all cast members ....hope there is a series 5!",1478736000,,207,4.621621621621622
8761844,4,B01FYKBE50,"This series focuses on three London detectives in a CID, or serious crimes, unit. However, it is a bit different from the usual police procedural fare.  First of all, there's the perspective: the viewer is really brought into the scene -- it's not as if we are just observing the action, it's as if we are almost THERE.  It's amazing how effectively they have managed that.  I think this is due in large part to the second difference in this series.  The actors ad-lib their lines.  There's a lot of swearing involved and a lot of ""political incorrectness"" which gives a real sense of gritty reality, but for those viewers who might be offended by this, consider this a heads-up.  The acting is very good, and the plots are involved, but there are a couple of problems, too.  First is the time constraint -- they manage to cram a great deal of investigation, action, and drama into each episode, but sometimes it seems as if they've simply run out of time and -- suddenly-- case solved! End of. The abruptness of the endings can be unsatisfactory for the viewer.  The biggest problem I have involves the procedure followed during the fictional investigations.  I don't pretend to know how real detectives work in the real world.  Yet, I am fervently hoping they do NOT subject every possible suspect to the degree of severity and emotional trauma that these detectives do -- and with regularity.  Sometimes, armed with only hunches or circumstantial evidence, they haul people in and subject them to sometimes shocking grillings. They make accusations and throw everything in their arsenal at each possible suspect (and even at witnesses who don't qualify as probable suspects) until something either ""sticks"" or someone breaks.  The problem is, It isn't always the guilty party that crumbles.  Innocent lives are seriously affected in the pursuit of justice.  That is pretty troubling. Especially when, after lives and relationships are shattered, the three detectives. exchanging bon mots, toddle off to the pub. Some episodes leave the viewer with a harsh taste in the mouth.  Do I still recommend this series?  Yes -- but with some reservations.",1477958400,,2149,4.927777777777778
8761845,5,B01FYKBE50,"Suspects, Series 3 and 4, Fay Ripley . This ground-breaking British television series uses a mockumentary style and improvised dialog to refresh the usual TV crime drama.  It is innovative, unscripted  and gritty, filmed with an eyewitness perspective and a low budget look that adds to the shows verisimilitude.  The British mystery is set in contemporary London, which co-stars, with its beautiful internationally known scenery and its rougher bits, giving viewers a frequent focus on its great life-bringing river, the Thames.

In series 3 and 4, detectives Martha Bellamy (Fay Ripley, COLD FEET), Jack Weston (Damien Molony, BEING HUMAN), and Charlie Steele (Clare-Hope As***ey, CHILDREN OF MEN) return to solve a series of all-new mysteries. An arson attack that leaves a teenager fighting for his life; a copycat murder that could be the work of a serial killer: the cop shop works  day and night to find the truth behind each crime. Mind you,  I did find it interesting how much easier modern conveniences have made detection in this tremendous modern city, especially as I just finished reading the crime novel SMOKE AND MIRRORS, which is set in 1951 Brighton: post-war shortages and rationing made crime solving possibly even more difficult than in Poirots day.  But these lucky cops have closed circuit television almost everywhere; DNA testing; cell phones and their towers; satnav or  GPS, whichever you call it, depending on which side of the Atlantic you live.  The cops have oyster cards, as they call them, mass transit bulk trip cards that they can track.  One suspects car even, conveniently, already has a tracking device on it.

The series is similar to the late, beloved PRIME SUSPECT: it focuses on the suspects in each crime; the detectives work to sort through them to find the actual perpetrator.  Much of the productions exposition also takes place in the interview room; critics smarter than I describe the interview room as the heart of any investigation. Mind you, the plots tend to be a little too politically correct/always fighting on the side of the angels for my taste, but the production is sufficiently down and dirty to balance that. Perhaps in keeping with its low-budget look, there aren't very many well-known guest stars: in fact, I clocked only one, Joe Absolom (DOC MARTIN.)  Never mind, the show doesnt draw its power from guest stars.

The box set, which I received for review purposes, contains two discs, eight episodes, running approximately 365 minutes. It has subtitles, thank goodness, for those of us not up on our Cockney slang. Beware, though, family viewers: it does contain violence, coarse language, nudity and sexual situations:  it is not recommended for children.  It would be a shame to miss though, with its strong acting, sense of place, tight plotting.  Its absorbing, vivid, cynical, with a sneaky Cockney sense of humor.  In this house, we consider it an eminently binge-watchable must-see.",1473552000,3,2956,5.084886128364389
