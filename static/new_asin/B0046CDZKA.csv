8417182,4,B0046CDZKA,"The Inbetweeners (2008-2010) is a raucous award winning British comedy, that follows the adventures of four 16 year old schoolmates, as they cope with situations and issues that are typically of interest to boys of that age, school, girls, cars, drinking alcohol, and sex.  While featuring a variety of crude and vulgar elements, the humor has a certain level of irony and sophistication, as thing rarely turn out well for these lads.  For those unfamiliar with British TV, ""series"" is the rough equivalent of ""season"" in American TV.  Series 1 (2008) contains 6 half hour episodes, which makes for a pretty quick watch.

Will McKenzie (Simon Bird) is typically the lead character, and usually provides some narration at different point in the episodes.  After his parent's divorce, Will's mother can no longer afford to send him to private school, so he winds up in Rudge Park Comprehensive, a public school, and falls in with a group of three close friends, Simon Cooper (Joe Thomas), Jay Cartwright (James Buckley) and Neil Sutherland (Blake Harrison).  The four quite distinct personalities, quickly bond, and begin to hang out together.

Crude, and often with a sexual component, the humor is something that you will probably either love or hate, as few topics seem to be ""off limits'.  Those not familiar with British slang, may miss some of the ""nuances"", but the general meaning of most of the humor should be understandable to Americans.

Drinking, meeting girls, and the pursuit of sex, is usually what most of the adventures are centered on.  Simon is hung up on Carli (Emily Head), a girl he has known since childhood, but who regards him only as a friend.  Jay is constantly talking and thinking about sex, but his forte seems to be limited to masturbation.  Will at least, is able to speak to girls, but unfortunately he often says the wrong things, and ends up ruining his chances.  The rather dull-witted Neil, is by far the most successful with women.

Not everything is seen through Will's eyes, but as the narrator, his thoughts influence the viewer's perceptions.  While often honest and quite perceptive, Will is often surprisingly dense, and displays incredibly poor judgment.  The boys don't always have each other's backs 100%, but they do manage to stick together through thick and thin.

The writing solidly defines the characters, and stays true to them.  The actors all are very talented, as although in their mid-20's, are very convincing as high school kids, dealing with juvenile level material, in a freshly outrageous way.  It takes skill to convincingly play dumb, or not too bright, and these guys do it marvelously.  The primary actors provide commentary tracks on several episodes, and these provide great insight into the actors, the program, and the warm camaraderie between the cast.

Vulgar and crass, but in a clever way, The Inbetweeners certainly isn't for everyone, but for those who can still remember what it was like to be 16, not be one of the ""cool"" kids, and awkward around girls, you may relate to the subject matter.  This is a Region 2 (PAL) release, so most will need a region-free player to view the disc.  You can often get a good deal at Amazon. UK, on Series One, Two, and Three, as well as the complete series set, so you may want to check there as well.",1370736000,,3314,4.847246891651865
