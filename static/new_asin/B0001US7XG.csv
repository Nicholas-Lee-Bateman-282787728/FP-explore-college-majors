8016376,5,B0001US7XG,"I first saw this on PBS in the 80s or early 90s...it is kind of a slow, yet engaging movie about relationships. I find it mesmerizing. I am glad it finally came out on DVD. The Brian Ferry music really helps make the movie.",1290470400,,223,4.090909090909091
8016377,5,B0001US7XG,"To be honest, my name is Jan Egleson and I directed this film. I just want to correct a misunderstanding  about the format on the DVD. The film begins 'full frame' and after a few shots becomes letter boxed. This is the correct aspect ratio; it is not a mistake. This was down to abide by technical requirements of PBS at the time. It was the first film to be broadcast in letter box format to the best of my knowledge. I have double checked the other technical aspects of the transfer and spoken with the distributor, First Look Media, and all is as it should be. I hope you enjoy the film. Thanks.",1252713600,23,599,4.254385964912281
8016378,5,B0001US7XG,"Please don't let the preceding review keep you from ""Big Time."" I took its advice, but after a year I was too curious, and bought a copy. I'm so glad i did. I was profoundly affected on seeing the movie when it was new, and similarly affected seeing it many years later. True, the picture may be cropped, the composition not fully honoring the creator's intent. But that doesn't effect the movie's content. Don't let some technical framing concerns keep you from this fascinating emotional experience.",1221350400,7,501,4.837209302325581
8016379,3,B0001US7XG,"I videotaped this movie from the PBS series American Playhouse in the early 90's and I watched this movie over and over just enthralled with the direction, cinematography and dialogue. The script has so many levels and the self-reference in this movie is just brilliant. And for Mia Sara fans, one scene refering to another movie will make them laugh. The soundtrack from Pat Metheny is absolutely haunting. Cinematography and editing wonderful. BUT...BUT this DVD transfer is completely third rate! The movie was shot in FULL SCREEN and they transferred it as widescren, cropping off a lot of the top and bottom frames. The frame rate is choppy and some of the motion stutters. It's grainy and the color isn't as sharp as it was meant to be. I'd get it for the content and NOT the presentation unfortunately.",1165017600,9,809,4.827338129496403
