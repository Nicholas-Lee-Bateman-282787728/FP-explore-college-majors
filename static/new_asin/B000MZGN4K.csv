2752250,1,B000MZGN4K,"As a relatively new beekeeper (3-4 years now) I have been trying to learn alot about these fascinating creatures.  This looked like a good documentary, plus it received many stars.  If you don't know anything about bees, this dvd might be alright.  After reading Beekeeping for Dummies and The Beekeeper's Handbook (Diana Sammataro/Alphonse Avitabile), this dvd is just about worthless, really.  There is a scene where a yellowjacket tried to steal away a bee or two and is attacked, stung to death by a ball of honey bees.  The narrator states that these guard bees lose their stinger, thereby sacrificing her life for the sake of the hive.  Yet we also see a virgin queen stinging another queen to death inside her cell.  Using that logic, if a queen stung her rival, then she too would die.  That is one glaring error hard to miss.  Unless I am drastically mistaken, honeybees can sting other insects without being ripped apart; it is mammals' skin that causes the stinging barb to become lodged and thereby kill the bee when she pulls away from the victim.
  Secondly, the videography is done very poorly.  Understandably the electronics available at filming time probably lacked the sophistication and small size that is available today.  (anyone remember those first cell phones??)  And the ""flights"" of the bees are absolutely horrible.  It is like they stuck a bee on an invisible string and moved it over a filmed background to simulate flight.  Additionally, the mating flight of the queen is done the same way.  It doesn't even look real.
  One scene shows rival queens ""tooting"" to locate each other.  During that scene the tooting becomes louder and more frequent, only later do you realize it transitions to the background music, not the tooting that queens do.  Once again the producers did a horrible job.
  The honey-loving bear is one of the last scenes on the dvd.  Very poorly done too.  There is footage of a bear coming across a stump with honeybees in it and tearing it apart, eating about half of it.  Yet there is no close-up footage of what is left of the colony.  The producer should have put in another scene or two of bears attacking colonies.  Furthermore the narrator states the bear is after honey primarily, and may eat protein-rich brood.  From most references I've read, the opposite is true.  Bears are after the protein-rich brood, and may eat honey if it is there.  In nature, protein is not always abundant and is prized above carbohydrates among mammals.
  Originally this was going to get 2 stars, but when considering content and quality of this dvd, plus the cost, 1 star is about all it is worth.  I would not buy this product again nor recommend it as an accurate reference.  It is a shame it has to take up space on my shelf.  There has to be better footage out there somewhere, maybe YouTube.
  Hope this has been helpful.",1248825600,36,2869,4.721212121212122

2752272,5,B000MZGN4K,"Not just a delightful, easy-to-understand introduction to the communal life of honey bees, but a fascinating revelation of the myriad of ""decisions"" that bees make  either in their daily routines or in response to unanticipated, often dire circumstances.

One cannot watch this video without sensing at its unspoken conclusion that the fundamental question of how? cannot be intellectually fulfilled by the routine, knee-jerk answer of evolution.

Take, for example, the incredible design of the hexagon-shaped comb. To their credit, mathematicians (with the support of biologists) have been successful in explaining WHY no other mathematical shape has the shortest sides and the lowest surface tension when expanding into spaces with opposing tension, thus fitting together without a hint of gaps.  But HOW did the bees conceive of such an ingenious engineering feat is by far the more imposing question. Since we know that for as long as perhaps 200 million years the honeybees have utilized the hexagon exclusively, then evolutions principle of natural selection simply is not applicable.

For the sake of no less than the pursuit of truth, let us consider for debate the real possibility of intelligent design as the guiding force behind our natural laws.",1433721600,,1259,5.370558375634518
2752273,5,B000MZGN4K,"This is the video that teachers request to use in classrooms. They think it's great and I agree.

The photography will amaze you. The closeups are so close, with cameras placed inside the hive. You'll feel like a bee walking around with the other bees inside the hive. Somehow they've rigged a camera to a bee and we go with her as she makes her foraging flights. These shots are astounding.

This video shows three different types of hives: A beeyard with about 24 hives, a swarm that has moved into a hollow apple tree and another swarm that takes up residence in a woods. We go inside the hive with a video camera and see the intimate details of workers as they are laid as eggs (see a queen lay the egg), grow and hatch as workers.

The life inside the hive is amazing to watch. It shows the 3 castes of bees, some bee biology and chores, wax construction, sharing of honey and attacks by invaders - moths, wasps and hornets.

The bees build queen cells and we see a queen hatch, then she goes on a mating flight - we actually see her mate mid air with a drone--all captured in closeup by the camera. She returns and we hear her piping and then fight to be the queen of the hive.

One queen leaves in a swarm and we watch while they select a new home for themselves and then build wild combs.

Next we're in a town where a large swarm has taken up residence. Beekeepers come in to help capture it but the queen flies off with her workers and they take up residence in the woods.

We'll see ants farming aphids and bees coming to take honeydew from the aphids, a bear who helps himself to a bee lunch with devastating results.

The video starts in spring and continues through summer, showing bees foraging flowers for nectar and pollen and covers the efforts and dangers of life as a field bee.

In fall there's the drone eviction (the boys can't stay for winter) and the beekeeper comes to take his share and extracts the honey.

This video is an absolute treasure. Teachers and children will enjoy it. Beekeepers will appreciate the closeups and scenes captured on video from inside the hive. All throughout the video little bits of biology and bee facts are shared. There's also a reference to a how we did it web site which reveals how the close up in flight video was done. I highly recommend this video.",1430352000,,2313,4.370629370629371

We are preparing to set up a backyard hive and we have purchased several DVDs on the subject of bees and honey - this beautiful film is about the life of bees NOT about how to keep them or making honey.
Watch this documentary if you care at all about the world you and your family lives in - it will give you an appreciation of how hard these little creatures work so unselfishly (they will give their life) for their home, family and our world.

I loaned it to a friend. She loved it but said her kids (8 and 6) complained and only got through half. Although I think even if you only get through half, there is still lots of learning to be had!

2752304,4,B000MZGN4K,"NOVA: Bees--Tales from the Hive (54 minutes) (2000) WGBH, Boston.

Teacher summary: Introduction shows worker bees defending the hive in a suicide act (as their stinger pulls out). Workers search for nectar; close-ups show them sucking nectar from flowers. Pollen collects on hairs and is then stored on pollen sacs on the legs. Back at the hive, the nectar is regurgitated, processed and within five days is packed into cells for storage as honey.  Other cells store pollen. Brief illustration of the importance of pollination to our crops and fruit trees. Waggle dance is briefly shown but this is not detailed enough to actually teach the orientation. Bees are followed on foraging. Lifespan is mentioned. Distinction between sterile female workers, male drones, and fertile queens is made. One slight error is narration that only chemical control (scent) keeps the workers from reproducing; not so.  Best footage I have seen of bee larval development and stages of metamorphosis.  The brood cells for sterile workers and drones are shown, along with emergence from cells. Worker care for emerging drones is shown. Video switches to overcrowding and the need to swarm.  The first queen to emerge from the enlarged queen cell, where the ""grub""[not the preferred term, ""grub"" is generally for beetle larvae] has been fed royal jelly and becomes queen.  The old queen has already used scents to stimulate many workers to swarm off with her. A new colony is formed in a hollow tree, using chemical marking. Video illustrates how the workers measure the new nest. Building of honeycomb is shown but wax secretion is not shown close-up. The geometry of the honeycomb is explained. Intruders include a mouse. The deaths-head hawk moth is shown invading the hive by mimicry of scent, avoiding raising the bee's alarm scent (the video avoids terms such as ""pheromone,"" etc.). The moth also mimics the queen's sounds.  Summer rains also pose a water danger to guard bees and allow a mouse to enter a nest. The bee-eater birds, unaffected by stinging, are shown in fabulous footage capturing bees in their beaks in mid-air. The European hornets emerge from their nest to attack and decimate a beehive. The bee's antennae and feet have senses of smell and taste. Focusing on the new hive left behind by a swarming queen, the new queen engages and stings younger sisters. A queen makes a mating flight and mates with distant drones and returns. In the case where the new queen swarms or is killed, virgin queens may ""swarm"" at high risk to the hive. Bees that are swarming are not in a defensive stinging mode and a swarm is shown alighting on trolley lines in Germany, stopping the urban human activities until the bees fly away. Bees are shown forming a new hive in a hollow tree stump. Some honey bees harvest woodland honey from aphids. Ants are shown raiding a nest. A bear tears apart the tree stump to harvest honey, despite heavily bothersome bee stings. Bees toss out the drones and survive winter.  A beekeeper harvests some frames of honey. Video closes with a quote from Winnie the Pooh, describing the best part of honey being the moment before eating it: ""sweet anticipation.""

The close-up photography throughout the video is exceptional. David Ogden Stiers narrates with his signature voice that drops off at the end of each sentence, which can lead to some students drifting off as well. Some of the script is anthropomorphic but not problematic. Appropriate for grade levels from 5th through high school; use at university level will require additional technical supplemantary narration.

Too be able to film where they did and how they did it is incredible. this has to be the best of the best as far as a beekeeping or bee film.,1260921600,12,289,3.393939393939394
8173598,5,B000MZGN4K,"After watching all the main DVDs on bees I have to say this is my favorite. The filming of the inside of the hives and the close-ups of bees in flight is very interesting and enlightening. You will learn how honey is actually created and see how royal jelly is used to raise queen bees. You will see bees making honeycomb and learn that they have wax secreting glands.

As with any nature DVD there is usually something disturbing like when the bees are attacked by a hornet. A bear also discovers a hive in a tree stump and eats up the honey. The filming of how bees swarm was slightly scary but entertaining to see people surrounded by hundreds of bees. There is also a scene where you see a drone mating with a queen bee at top flight. How they captured these moments is amazing and I don't know all the technical details.

I felt this film was stunningly beautiful and was actually humorous in places. Besides the bees, there is a mouse, owl and some horses. The countryside where this was filmed is gorgeous. So I vote this the best DVD on bees I've yet to see! I think you will learn a lot and also be amazed at how intelligent bees are and how we need to protect them. This film did not discuss colony collapse disorder. There is one scene where honey is extracted from honeycomb, but humans are not the focus. Most of the time is just spent filming bees at work and wow are they busy!
