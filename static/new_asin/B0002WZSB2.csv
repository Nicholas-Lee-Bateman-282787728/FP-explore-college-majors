2131349,5,B0002WZSB2,This movie is filled with passion for his country and the people of Mexico. This is historically accurate in regards to the history and not his love life.,1354838400,,154,4.535714285714286
2131350,5,B0002WZSB2,"If this man were alive right now, he would be a force to be dealt with
still people talk about him at this day and age. Simple man whom loved the land and its people.",1329868800,2,166,3.7714285714285714
2131351,4,B0002WZSB2,This is an entertaining film with authentic people and setting. The 4:3 picture is sharp and crystal clear. The film is in Spanish with English subtitles.,1269043200,3,154,4.961538461538462
2131352,5,B0002WZSB2,"Sometimes I think old Mexico has lost its soul, but then something like this apparently made-for-TV movie comes out, and I'm completely thrown. Bichir is unbelievably good, as is the entire cast. And the director deserves some sort of medal of honor. I'm just heartsick knowing that IMDB doesn't even list this movie. If you've got a drop of Mexican blood in your veins, or even just like Mexican food, you really need to see this wonderful little film. Bravo all involved!",1189468800,5,473,4.780487804878049
2131353,5,B0002WZSB2,"I am not much of a soap opera fan, but this mini-series was great and could not stop watching-it from start to finish. It is a historical and romantic type of series. Wish they had a english dubbed version so my friends who do not understand spanish see a bit of history of Mexico; and what the late 20th and early 21st Century Zapatistas are truly have been fighting all these years. ""Tierra y Libertad"" (""Land and Liberty"")by GOD, Emiliano Zapata was a true human being who cared about the future of Mexico and its children. Anyone interested in Mexican history should purchase this movie, it is subtitled. Buy-it now!!!",1156032000,3,622,4.663636363636364
2131354,3,B0002WZSB2,"When I saw the comercial of this historical ""telenovela"" epic, I was very interested in watching it since I had finished reading various biographies of Emiliano Zapata. However, it began as a telenovela and had too many inaccuracies.  Especially the way it showed that he was not interested in his wife, Josefa until she proved herself to him. In reality she was not into him, and her family never aproved of him because of their social standing,until he became General of the Rebel army did her family accept him into the family. All in all, if you want an accurate historical biography you must look into it yourself and come up with your own conclusions.",1144281600,8,657,4.71304347826087
2131355,5,B0002WZSB2,"A great historical theme movie that covers mexico's civil war.

The acting is superb, the chemestry invokes your passions.

Not only for the romantic scenes in the movie, that is.

The rich landowners Injustice and ignorance fuels the uprising of the peasants, who elect a modest, justice seeking peon out of their midst as their leader: Emiliano Zapata.

Bound not on vengeance but social consience, he journeys with

the peasents against Mexico's corrupt regime, making his mark on history. The battle scenes are realisticly depicted, the violence not overdramatised . A refreshing departure from the current ""hollywood special effect"" spectacle.

The miniseries should have been longer, because the armed struggle contains a lot of untold drama, that the budged had to compromise on. Nevertheless, a must see for all lovers of historical theme movies.",1137283200,16,854,5.335820895522388
2131356,4,B0002WZSB2,"I did not know much about Zapata before I watched this movie. It is an exiting story about the revolutionary Zapata. The true story has been spiced up a bit by adding romance. I liked the movie a lot - 4,5 hours with good entertainment - ""telenovela"" style!",1104364800,9,257,4.375

8033975,1,B0002WZSB2,"This is one of the worst movies ever made anywhere! Now I understand why it was never released in the United States. Forget this movie, watch VIVA ZAPATA starring Marlon Brando and Anthony Quinn and written by John Steinbeck. The script, the acting, the cinematography, everything is terrible in this movie. Zero stars!!!",1415750400,,321,5.0754716981132075
8033976,5,B0002WZSB2,zapata (el sueno de un heroe): I loved this movie for the courage and love Zapata had for others. I learned so many things about him I didn't know. If you are Mexican/American and know something about our hero's I believe you should buy this film.  Thank you.,1411948800,3,259,4.395833333333333
8033977,5,B0002WZSB2,awesome already had cd but I lost it and I liked it very much so that is why I ordered a second one,1388275200,2,99,3.347826086956522
8033978,2,B0002WZSB2,"Please do not watch this series as ""history"". It is only vaguely accurate.

However, the production values are quite high (this was a super-expensive production) and the story moves along nicely regardless of its shallow stereotype characters and ludicrous, annoying romantic subplots. What can I say; I'm a Mexican Revolution buff and I don't like inaccuracy.  But I watched all of it anyway because the real strength of this series lies in its visuals.

The photography is attractive.  The editing is very well done - for example, a ""battle"" scene that contains only a small handful of people almost feels like a real battle (Kudos! I'm sure that wasn't easy for the editors to pull off).  They filmed in many excellent locations and the visual accuracy of some recreated scenes is amazing (I felt almost creeped out by the accuracy of scene of Zapata and Villa's famous photograph in the Presidential Palace).  The weapons, vehicles and men's costumes are pretty accurate (and therefore awesome if you like that style) but sadly, the women's wardrobe is cheap and silly.  The lovely Lorena Rojas is ridiculously un-historical in her revealing outfits - I guess it seemed a shame to hide such a gorgeous woman under accurate period clothing.

The actors are overall very good.  I think Demian Bachir lacks the intensity required to play Zapata no matter how many famous poses he strikes. But there are many excellent performers here, including Enoc Leao (Zapata's brother Eufemio), Giovanna Zacaras (Josefa Espejo) and Joaqun Cosio (Pancho Villa).

It's definitely fun to see actors made up to look exactly like Villa, Fierro, Madero, Huerta and Carranza.  And there are trains, horses, cigarillos, and bandoliers.  Since it's a Mexican production, we are spared a weird, ignorant Hollywood version of ""Mexico"". If you want to watch something Revolution-y, that last reason is enough in itself to watch this series.",1372809600,8,1917,5.108974358974359
8033979,5,B0002WZSB2,"Great movie,Would recommend to anybody that would like to learn about the Mexican Revolutionary Heroes. Also look into Pancho Villa as Himself...Starring Antonio Banderas.",1362009600,2,171,6.166666666666667
8033980,5,B0002WZSB2,To learn more about Mexican culture and history this DVD is a must. Great acting and reinacting. I loved it.,1361232000,2,108,4.45
8033981,5,B0002WZSB2,I received the movie faster than expected. The movie arrived new and in great condition. most of the actors and actresses are my favorite and best of Mexican representation.,1357430400,2,173,5.0
