4207758,5,B003UYJM7U,"I really enjoyed ""The Dead Matter""!  It's not like a lot of other horror films being made today.  It doesn't have a lot of gore - which is just fine with me!  The movie has a very old-school look to it and it reminds me of horror films from the 80s.  The story is very interesting and has a few twists to keep it moving along.  It's not super-scary, but it did make me jump a few times!  I'm a huge Midnight Syndicate fan, so I really loved the music, too!",1280966400,4,456,3.956043956043956
4207759,5,B003UYJM7U,"The movie is thrilling to watch and the music is out of this world!  The film stays true to the horror and suspense genre, while having a modern plot.  Some of the filming took place in the Ohio Reformatory in Mansfied, OH, supposedly haunted with several paranormal ""hotspots"".  The movie is entertaining for the whole family.",1280880000,2,327,4.803571428571429
4207760,2,B003UYJM7U,"Not to burst anyone's bubble, but this film isn't that great. In fairness, it's obvious that those that made it gave it their best shot and made it with heart. And, there are some good ideas here. Still, the film is convoluted, suffers from poor pacing, editing and looks cheap. It also does a poor job trying to decide if it's a horror film or satire. One scene meant for laughs features a zombie drinking beer in a pub, a funny idea. Amazingly the crowd in the bar  doesn't even notice the monster and the joke just dies. Beloved Cleveland celeb Big Chuck has a cameo but isn't given much to do, which is a shame. Midnight Syndicate is known for their music but the score feels overproduced for this kind of B movie carnage and intrudes more than enhances the movie. Listening to the soundtrack (which is very good) by itself would be the better option. I have to note that the beautiful DVD cover artwork is truly awesome.",1280707200,6,925,4.4411764705882355
4207761,5,B003UYJM7U,"The Dead Matter...

This is the imagination of Gothic/Halloween band Midnight Syndicate founding member Ed Douglas at work. Being creative always starts with an idea and a vision. In the mid 1990s he had an idea. He had a vision. He had a dream. He had $2,000. He had...............a Super VHS camera that he borrowed. It was used to film the first version of The Dead Matter, released in 1996. You have to start somewhere. A decade later an opportunity to re-make The Dead Matter with a much larger budget was realized (about $1.5 million). The script was co-written by Ed Douglas and Tony Demci, just as it was in the original 1996 film. Shooting took place in August and September 2007 in the Mansfield, Ohio area. To make this movie, Douglas went to the well and drew on his many talents, knowledge, creativity, interest in horror films, and prior background as a filmmaker and musician/composer, not to mention a college degree in theater and filmmaking. The end result is a dream realized. An excellent independent horror film with excellent actors, an excellent musical score courtesy of Midnight Syndicate themselves, not to mention contributions from other artists in the form of rock & roll songs (Lazy Lane, Eternal Legacy, and HipNostic).

This movie stars Andrew Divoff (CSI: Miami, Lost, also movies such as Wishmaster, Air Force One, The Rage, Indiana Jones 4), Jason Carter (Babylon 5, Beverly Hills 90210, Angel, Charmed, Third Rock From The Sun), special effects legend Tom Savini (From Dusk Till Dawn, Dawn Of The Dead, Lost Boys 2, Grindhouse, Friday The 13th), Sean Serino (The Rage), Tom Nagel (North Mission Road, Beast Of Bray Road), CB Spencer (Passions, Ally McBeal, the movie Ballistica) Christopher Robichaud (the original 1996 version of The Dead Matter, plus voices on Midnight Syndicate albums), Brian Van Camp (New World Disorder), Donna Williams (The Rapture), Jim O' Rear (Hell House, Vampyre Tales), Meredith Beardmore (CSI: NY, A Family Matter), Kenyatta Foster, and ""Big Chuck"" Schodowski (American Scary), to name just a few, along with special effects/makeup artist Alan Tuskes (Star Trek, Vanilla Sky, The Rage). The narrator is Richard ""Count Gore De Vol"" Dyszel (The Alien Factor, Chainsaw Sally).

What is this movie about? It's about a grief-stricken young woman named Gretchen who will do anything to contact or ""reconnect"" with her deceased brother. She stumbles upon an ancient Egyptian occult relic that leads her into the dark world of vampires and the living dead. She gets more than she bargained for, as all hell breaks loose. Two warring vampire lords are in search of the relic, which can control the dead. A vampire hunter is trying to stop them from obtaining the relic. This movie is unique in that it mixes both zombies and vampires. If you're somebody who is a fan of the Halloween season and its darker aspects, yet also embraces the lighter side of Halloween, then this movie will entertain you, as it is both on the dark side and lighter side. This movie has horror, humor, twists and turns, and keeps you guessing. The atmosphere is dark and creepy in parts, while at other times everyday activities and locations are used, such as in houses, bars, office buildings, etc. Midnight Syndicate doesn't hesitate to embrace the lighter side of horror/Halloween once in a while, and this movie proves it. You can't go wrong. I don't want to reveal too much. Watch it and be entertained. It's destined to become a Halloween classic, one of those movies that you'll want to watch every year during the Halloween season or on Halloween night after the trick-or-treaters have gone home and the jack-o-lantern has been extinguished. While not that scary, it does have its moments that will catch you off guard.

Ed Douglas and Tony Demci were inspired and influenced by horror films of yesteryear, particularly from the '30s, '60s, '70s, '80s, Creepshow, and the Hammer films, but the bottom line is that The Dead Matter is ORIGINAL. The movie takes the ""old school"" approach of yesteryear, and it works. I personally think it's a great movie and I think you will, too. It doesn't take a lot of money to accomplish the primary goal, which is to scare or at least entertain the audience. Think of films like Carnival Of Souls (1962), Night Of The Living Dead (1968), and Halloween (1978). These are perfect examples of independent films that make their point and get the job done by scaring and entertaining you and creating the perfect atmosphere with minimal money.

The Dead Matter is 89 minutes long and is presented in widescreen format.

The extras on the DVD are excellent. There are two Midnight Syndicate music videos (""Dark Legacy"" and ""Lost"", both of which appeared on The Dead Matter: Cemetery Gates album, released in 2008), three finalists' music videos from the Midnight Syndicate 13th Anniversary video contest, gag reels, audio commentary by Ed Douglas, Robert Kurtzman, and Gary Jones, a feature called Maximum Dead Matter that allows you to watch a scene in one corner of the screen while simultaneously watching the actual filming of the scene in another window, interviews with cast and crew members, locations, and concept art.

Robert Kurtzman (producer, From Dusk Till Dawn, The Rage, Wishmaster), Gary Jones (Xena, Hercules, Boogeyman 3), and Ed Douglas all co-produced this movie.

This 3-disc set contains The Dead Matter movie on DVD as well as the music CD ""Halloween Music Collection"", a sort of ""greatest hits"" compilation of some of their best songs over the years.  Also included in this set is the motion picture soundtrack to The Dead Matter.  So there you go - 3 discs altogether!

Yes, there is still hope when it comes to the making of quality horror movies. Thankfully, there are still a few people out there who actually have their own ideas and imagination. This is a standout independent horror movie gem released during the Age of Horror Remakes that we're currently living in. As good as this movie is, I believe that time will elevate this movie's status even more.",1280448000,,6061,4.938174681059863

The music is very good (being produced by Midnight Syndicate, which I love for horror / gothic mood music).  The plot has some intriguing elements and introduces some interesting ideas (i.e.a human diet drug being ""vampire crack"" that also lets them walk in the sun).  The problem is that the movie has several viable storylines but does not really pick one to develop.  Definitely worth a watch if you are a fan of one of the actors but very much ""meh"" as a story.",1421020800,6,556,4.421568627450981

4207768,5,B003UYJM7U,"I liked the movie and thought it had a cliff-hanger at the end. Even though it is a low-budget film, I do believe the soundtrack from Midnight Syndicate really helped set the atmosphere to this film considerably! If this is the actors' first appearances making a film, they did great with what they had at their disposal to work with. I read somewhere that the director didn't have a huge budget to go all out on this particular film. From my movie lover's stand point: I see a lot of potential for this film, its director, plus the cast itself. Maybe they'll earn enough from this movie's sales to support a bigger budget horror movie to expand upon The Dead Matter. Then again, perhaps, the director never meant to create a sequel to it. Either way, it was a good film, especially since it has Tom Savini in it.",1382918400,4,813,4.4630872483221475
4207769,3,B003UYJM7U,"I did not totally follow this wacky story of a scarab pendant, some vampires (?), and a zombie made into a companion/pet, but it was rather entertaining in its silliness.",1351123200,,170,4.7
4207770,4,B003UYJM7U,"First timer Edward Douglas wrote and directed this wonderful tale into the undead. While Edward is new in the director's chair he has been working on the music end of horror films since 1997 and his ability to work with music shows through the entire film.

What you have to give the film credit for is taking every major aspect of the undead in horror today and twisting it all together to form a fun ride into an off the wall story. I warn you ahead of the time zombie in it is more of the traditional voodoo zombie then the Romero or infected that we've come to be used to and isn't the main threat in the film. While this usually may make us overlook a film it was a fun ride and did have at least one zombie in it so we're able to slip it in through the cracks and into a review!

Basically the plot follows 3 main avenues that center around one item. We have Gretchen (Sean Serino) who wants nothing more than to have her brother back in her life. The one drawback to this is that he's dead. Bummer. What's a girl to do but track down a mystical artifact, an amulet to be specific, that has some interesting powers. I'll give you 1 guess on the item that all 3 major story arcs kind of focus on. It's an amulet that gives you control over the dead. Not only control but also let's you bring the dead back to life. Now I wonder why Gretchen wants it?

The second person after this artifact is actually dead himself, or should I say undead, a vampire that goes by Vellich (Andrew Divoff) who wants nothing more then a new means of power since thats what all old vampires tend to be in the mood for. His competitor though is what spices up this story line as the other vampire chasing after the amulet is Sebed (played by zombie fan favorite Tom Savini!) Tom plays a drug dealing vampire who is at odds with Vellich and the two are having a power struggle that fits in.

Finally though are 2 people who are stuck in the middle of all of these people after a simple little amulet. McCallister (Jason Carter) and Pym (Bryan Van Camp.) Vampire hunters who really want nothing more then to have some time to kill off some vampires.

The zombie theme comes in after the vampire hunter Pym is killed off and brought back to life by Gretchen from this amulet. Back to life, not a vampire, can it be? YES! Finally! There is a zombie in this film! Sure he's more of that traditional voodoo zombie (-voodoo +amulet) but he still counts!

Sure the plot is a little convoluted at times and the special effects make you feel like it's a 90's horror film but none of that makes the movie bad. In fact nothing makes the movie bad or I wouldn't be giving a mostly vampire themed flick a review on Buy Zombie. It's really a fun romp that feels like a throwback to classic horror films of days gone by. I suggest picking this one up as it'll grow on you (like an infection) the further in you get.",1349049600,3,2882,4.221415607985481
4207771,4,B003UYJM7U,"Let's state the obvious: This movie is a long way from Hollywood (and that might not be a bad thing) but it suffers from a lackluster cast, low budget, and some relatively poor acting at times. On the other hand, the music is great, and the movie is good for several laughs along the way. I'm not going to spoil it by revealing the plot, so you'll have to read other reviews to get that. In a strange way, this movie is refreshing and an escape from the predictable Hollywood horror film. Douglas and crew manage to crank out a film that has that dark element, good plot, good music, and humor for an overall decent experience. I give the movie 3 stars for the deficiencies stated above, but 5 stars for the overall effort and music. I would like to see more Syndicate movies in the future, preferably something along the lines of dark Tim Burton atmospheres and downright edge of your seat horror; this would make up for the low budgets and inferior acting. P.S. I hope that the actress who played Gretchen was paid well; she's in just about every scene!",1348704000,,1055,4.443298969072165

4207773,5,B003UYJM7U,"I loved this movie. Filmed at the Mansfield Reformatory added a super huge dose of creepiness to this flick.

4207774,5,B003UYJM7U,"""The Dead Matter"" has raised the bar for independent horror movies big time!  The production values (direction, photography, music, lighting, sound) are of Hollywood quality, but unlike Hollywood (fortunately!) ""The Dead Matter"" has a unique and engaging story that unfolds throughout the film's entire run-time.  In fact, it isn't really fair to call ""The Dead Matter"" a horror movie - it's much more than that - it's a supernatural movie.

Most Hollywood horror movies these days are remakes or are so 'by-the-numbers' you pretty much know everything that is going to happen after the first 5-10 minutes.  ""The Dead Matter"" follows multiple stories that converge in the final frantic 20 minutes.  The plot melds so many different supernatural elements that it's reminiscent of the creativity the old Shaw Brother's horror movies used to exhibit in the 1980s.  Those movies, like ""The Dead Matter"" didn't follow the rules of horror genres; they created their own supernatural mythologies.

This review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the excellent actors assembled for this movie, including b-movie favorites Tom Savini and Jim O'Rear, but it is the welcome return of Jason Carter that really sets this one apart from its indie contemporaries.  Jason Carter may be best known for his role on the TV series Babylon-5, but he really shines in ""The Dead Matter"".  I hope this film re-energizes his career so we see him in more horror and sci-fi films.

If you're looking for something engagingly-different with Hollywood production values, ""The Dead Matter"" is for you!",1303603200,,1575,5.214285714285714

If you're a regular visitor of NightmaRevue... hell, if you're an irregular visitor (I'm talking the OTHER definition, not the ""I need some Ex-Lax"" type of irregular), or if you've never seen the site at all, if you're into the dark and spooky odds are you're aware of Midnight Syndicate. The duo, comprised of Edward Douglas and Gavin Goszka, has been crafting elegantly moody music since 1995. If you visit Hot Topic or one of the annual Halloween specialty shops that tend to pop up these days, odds are you've seen their CDs for retail (and, hopefully, found a place in your CD collection for some of their offerings).

Way back in 1995, our kindly Mr. Douglas made a film called The Dead Matter for two grand. Now, with co-production from Robert Kurtzman (for whom Midnight Syndicate wrote and recorded the score for his film The Rage) and Gary Jones teamed up with Midnight Syndicate Films, Edward's been able to remake his vision on a much grander scale...

The Dead Matter has two two main parallel storylines that converge every now and then until coming into direct conflict in the film's final half hour. One of these is focused on Gretchen (Sean Serino), a young woman troubled by the recent death of her brother. To the unease of her boyfriend Mike (Tom Nagel) Gretchen has obsessively turned more and more to the occult in attempts to contact her deceased sibling, including recruiting the talents of Jill (C.B. Spencer), a dabbler in supernaturalism herself who, when we first see her, is carrying a grimoire of her own. Mike's buddy Frank (Christopher Robichaud) who works in a commercial laboratory developing weight-loss products tags along for the ""what the hell, why not?"" factor and ends up falling in love with Jill along the way. Scientist and spiritualist, two great tastes that go great together.

On a night's gathering for a seance, our four intrepid spookseekers find a peculiar scarab amulet on the ground in the forest. Gretchen keeps it, puts it on, and is delighted when, during the seance, it seems to somehow call up or activate spirits that zip through the air around and through our now surprised foursome. Gretchen soon discovers that the scarab gives her the power to command the dead, a skill that becomes only too apparent when a single silent, roughed-up zombie shows up at her beck and call.

Our second major plotline follows an intense vampire of the old school badass variety who goes by the name of Vellich (Andrew Divoff, from Wishmaster and Lost). He recently had the scarab amulet himself and had been using it to cause havoc and horror with an undead army until vampire hunter McCallister (Jason Carter of Babylon 5 fame) showed up and wrecked his plans. He begins a new search for the artifact and comes into conflict with an enclave of vampires led by the sarcastic and insulting Sebed (horror genre stalwart Tom Savini). Sebed, who seems to use drug traffic as his reins of power over his fellow vampires, favors a more modern outlook on vampirism than the ye olde world style of Vellich, and the two have a strong, unhidden contempt for each other.

So... ""good guys"" versus ""bad guys"" you think, right? Not entirely. Once the character I found myself thinking of as ""servitor zombie"" - a partner of McCallister's who died earlier in the film at Vellich's capable, savage hands - is introduced, the film takes some interesting time to show how our human foursome react to the sudden intrusion of the macabre into their world. Poor Gretchen falls deeper into her obsession with making contact with her dead brother, Jill is horrified at the abomination Gretchen's new bauble has wrought, and Frank, ever the scientist, ignores matters of spiritual morality and goes straight into obsessing about getting the walking cadaver into the lab for rigorous study. Gretchen's poor boyfriend is left in a doubting but hopeful stance as his instincts tell him Gretchen's wrong yet he wants to do what he can to support her and help her with her pain.

In general, the majority of your straightforward horror films present the monsters - if such a film should HAVE a monster - as a threatening OUTSIDER. We occasionally get glimpses from its point of view sometimes, at least in a physical sense, usually to build tension, but the story is never related from that monster's point of view. In such films monster is a chaotic, destructive element that afflicts our protagonists and their world, and, well, that's about it until its Achilles' Heel is discovered, the protagonists escape, or the protagonists themselves succumb. You don't look in Hannibal Lector's head, watch Dracula hatch his schemes and discuss them over with the house vampiresses, or get to understand the natural hunting proclivities of the Wolf Man. These creatures are the threats to the people we're SUPPOSED to identify with, the characters they present a clear and present danger toward.

The Dead Matter is of a school of genre film that has extended the perception box's dimensions out enough that the monsters themselves take on more aspect of fully developed characterization, perhaps even humanization. It becomes less about an outside threat and more about a consistent universe in which all of these entities coexist and come into conflict for various reasons. It's horror fantasy, really. In the past Midnight Syndicate has written and recorded music inspired by and aimed at fans of fantasy roleplaying with a licensed Dungeons and Dragons themed album. Those familiar with TSR's old 2nd Edition Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Ravenloft campaign setting products will feel a nostalgic pang of memory deep in their twisted, black hearts, because, aside from the modern setting, it's contextually very similar to the sort of gaming one might have on the central nations of Barovia (Dracula-based) or Darkon (armies of undead rising on a commander's whim) in the game world's core. It's still horror - terrible, frightening, and revolting things happen - but the scope has been pulled out enough to allow monsters to be true gothic villains and our heroes to have all-too-tragic flaws. Throw in a heaping helping of ""Powers beyond the scope and understanding of humanity"" as the scarab's effects on not just the world and the dead but on Gretchen herself become more powerful and potent, and you've got The Dead Matter to a ""T.""

Its melding of horror and fantasy elements aside, The Dead Matter has a lot going for it. The makeup effects are, as would be expected from a person of Kurtzman's history - excellent - and the film's decision to use purple as its supernatural accentuation color as opposed to the usual tropes of, say, red or that X-Files reminiscent neon green, is a welcome change and nice to see as a Midnight Syndicate fan because it's so often incorporated in the group's album art. If they have a signature color, purple is it, and it just adds the right Midnight Syndicate feel to the proceedings. Digital effects work seems to be have been kept to a minimum such as when there's no other physical effects option that can precisely illustrate what needs to happen onscreen. When they happen, they aren't WETA quality, but they're not budget basement Sci-Fi Channel Original Movie dreck, either. Acting and writing are solid for the most part with the occasional rocky moment here or there, but nothing that'll come close to sinking the ship as a whole. The music, also the work of Edward Douglas, is another exemplary addition to the Midnight Syndicate catalog.

Do I have any stronger criticisms of the film that I haven't mentioned? Yes. A subplot detailing potential vampiric involvement in Frank's pharmaceutical place of employment appears almost too suddenly with too few threads tying it to the main plot. It would have been nice to have had this interesting connection elaborated on some more. Likewise, I personally would have enjoyed more depth to the Vellich/Sebed relationship - not different, but more. But, again, none of this sinks the film.

The sort of blending of Fantasy and Horror that you see with The Dead Matter just isn't something you see much. The Underworld films are too action-and-effects-centric, the Twilight films are juvenile in aim and lack any real horror, and Interview with the Vampire seemed almost as if I'd somehow come across a Highlander sequel with vampires instead of immortals or whatever the hell McCloud's race call themselves. The Blade films lack the subtlety and all of the above lack the morbidity.

As a first commercial release in the independent horror film market, The Dead Matter is a solid entry for Edward Douglas and Midnight Syndicate. It aims to do a little bit of everything and is actually able to succeed. Plus, they've thrown in a feature-length making of documentary and a number of Midnight Syndicate music videos to keep the fans satisfied. Hopefully with this one out of the way Edward and crew will find themselves soon in position to take what they learned on this production and bring us even more visual goodness from the Midnight Syndicate label.",1297728000,,9068,4.911879895561357

4207778,2,B003UYJM7U,"The Dead Matter (Edward Douglas, 2010)

It's been a little over two weeks since Twelve Hours of Terror, and the last movie from the fest that I have to review is The Dead Matter. Not only because it was the least deserving of the films that played, but simply because I can't really find much to say about it; it's not horrendous enough to achieve so-bad-it's-good status, but there's not a single thing about it that manages to be average, much less above average.

Douglas, who's Midnight Syndicate musical corps has worked on everything from The Rage 9the 2007 Robert Kurtzman-helmed Misty Mundae vehicle) to Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II, steps behind the camera for his directorial debut here. All I can give you of a plot synopsis is pretty much lifted straight from IMDB: there's this relic, see. In the opening scene, we see Vellich (Andrew Divoff, who also appeared in The Rage), head of a clan of vampires, pursuing a vampire hunter who took the relic and headed for the hills. Before said vampire hunter gets offed, he hides the relic well enough that Divoff can't find it. Cut to later, and a group of young-and-beautifuls out in the woods to conduct a sance to try and reach Gretchen (Sean Serino, also of The Rage... are you seeing a trend?)'s recently-deceased brother. Not long after that we find out the relic has the power to control the dead, so when, during the sance, it reveals its presence to Gretchen, you can pretty much guess the rest of the movie.

So okay, if this was basically a Rage reunion, where was the only thing worth watching about that movie... Misty Mundae? Not even a cameo, folks. (It should be noted, however, that Tom Savini does have one, as the head of a rival vampire clan. And for the more vertical-market cameo-hunters, if you know who Chuck Schodowski is...) And while Robert Kurtzman was pretty incompetent as a director, it's obvious that being around movies had at least given him a basic feel for blocking a shot. There was never a point during The Rage when I thought to myself ""man, this scene could have been lit so much better than it is."" (And no, the excuse is not ""the whole thing is basically outdoors""... since the same could be said of this flick.) I had that thought at least three times during The Dead Matter, and only one of them was an inside shot. (For trivia purposes, that one was when the zombie first walks into the bar.) Okay, so acting can sometimes carry a picture that's not well-directed. Not here, bub. There are a few high points (Jim O'Rear, who plays a vampire flunky, steals every scene he's in--not surprising given that he has more experience in front of the camera than any two other actors in this movie combined), but it's mostly straight-up cardboard. Sean Serino is drop-dead gorgeous, and I'll watch her in anything, but given the two movies I've seen her in I'll probably be muting the sound from here on out.

Given all that, as I often say, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen. Wasn't even the worst movie I saw in the month of October (though it's a solid second on that list). Mindless entertainment, but with so many better mindless-entertainment choices, leave this one on the video shelf until you've seen everything else you might be in the mood for. * ",1288742400,2,3259,4.602409638554217

Oct. 3rd 2009 at ""Tower City Ctr."" in Cleveland, OH., I'll tell you what this movie was well done and may become a Cult favorite down the road. Edward Douglas really knows how to make a good movie, He originally made this movie in 1996 on a minimal budget, Douglas was never really happy with the final results of This film. In 2007 he was given an estimated $2,000,000 to re-do the film the way he had intended, The whole film was shot from August 6th through Sept. 1st 2007. This just shows how Douglas and His Crew can make a Very Good movie when you have the Budget to do so. Also the music by ""Midnight Syndicate"" flowed so smoothly through out the movie, It just made the movie even more enjoyable to watch. It's a different type of Horror movie, with a twist and not a lot of gore. I don't know when this movie will be released domestically, but if you do get a chance to see it - DO NOT MISS IT!",1285200000,4,954,4.134408602150538
4207780,4,B003UYJM7U,"I love horror movies. I am espeically fond of scary, slapstick ones. This one fits the bill perfectly. I had the opportunity to attend a panel discussion with Edward Douglas (Midnight Syndicate) and Jason Carter at Dragon Con for a special screening of The Dead Matter. It was fantastic. Even Edward, the creator behind the film, stated that certain parts were meant to be funny.

My four year old and I are also big zombie movie girls and this fit the bill perfectly. Not to mention, it has Jason Carter in it from the television series Babylon 5.",1285113600,5,548,4.591836734693878
4207781,3,B003UYJM7U,"An unexpected arrival just recently, is this triple feature compendium of the film 'The Dead Matter' with soundtrack, and the Halloween music collection, which is essentially a ""best of Midnight Syndicate"" release, intended for Halloween spookshows and even personal celebrations. Having appreciated the compositions of Midnight Syndicate since discovering them at a Halloween shoppe circa Realm of Shadows, and then on through The 13th Hour, it is a pleasing surprise.

The Dead Matter {film & soundtrack}

Plotline 1: Two Vampire Warlords argue about the so-called ""new way"" and the ""old ways"". Tom Savini plays a mafia-like character named Sebed, to Andrew Divoff's more traditional vampire role as Vellich, although both register as ""evil"" personalities. Sebed prefers plasma injections versus the cinematically common blood ingestion of Vellich, who has a trick or two up his sleeve, granting him the advantage after all.

Plotline 2: A group of friends find an Egyptian scarab medallion in the woods, so predictably, just like with Ouija boards, one of the girls named Gretchen {reminiscent of Queen of The Damned} decides to play around with The Occult and have a seance to call forth her recently deceased brother. They take on more than they can handle*, and end up with a zombie, rotting away, but following her every instruction. She familiarizes herself with the relic's basic possibilities a bit, but it is not until the end when she becomes 'possessed' by a Necromantic entity that its full potential is unleashed.

Plotline 3: Besides the vampire vs. vampire scenario, there is also a ""Van Helsing""-like vampire hunter named McCallister, who actually 'crosses' the line between battling the nosferatu, quelling the zombie, and providing ritualistic advice to the obsessed / possessed Gretchen.

Apparently made on a condensed budget, this film has a rather 'made for TV' vibe to it, probably due to the fact that this was obviously recorded on videotape instead of film grade, but the production value really makes up for it in the above average acting, special effects, soundtrack, and intriguing dual plot, where it really counts. A fun little movie one may encounter during a late-night Halloween season broadcast.

Special features include a blooper reel, a making of featurette with interviews, film commentary, behind the scenes footage, and music videos by Midnight Syndicate {one of which gives the impression of the 'Goosebumps' theme}, as well as three rather impressive fan-made creations.

The soundtrack is appreciated for what it is, with dramatic action-adventure / horror / thriller orchestrations to accentuate scenes, characters, and activity, but can very well stand on its own, though not quite comparable to an individual opus.

Film: 3.5/5 | Soundtrack: 4/5.

Halloween Music collection

Contains 22 selections from Gates of Delirium, Realm of Shadows, Vampyre, The 13th Hour, ""Out of The Darkness"", & ""Cemetery Gates"", the latter which is the first recording since The 13th Hour; although in My estimation, that and the previous releases are the absolute best from Midnight Syndicate, and along with Nox Arcana (personal favorite), are ideal for Halloween festivities.

8406274,2,B003UYJM7U,"I can see I'm in the minority but I did not like it. Would have worked better as a zombie comedy or if it has been more campy. But, who ever directed it was trying to be too serious with a silly plot. My main issue, the leading lady. She came across to me more like a zombie than a human or someone who had been hypnotized or in a happy high after smoking some grass. Let me translate her dialog: 'Oh, a zombie, let me contact my brother, because zombies all know each other.' (I guess). Not intelligent enough to take serious and not amusing enough to go along for a ride.
