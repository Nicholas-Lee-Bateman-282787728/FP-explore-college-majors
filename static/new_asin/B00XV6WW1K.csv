8716698,5,B00XV6WW1K,"NJ's Rev 4 is absolutely amazing!  I don't have to go to the gym to do cardio and weight lifting. With Rev 4, you use your own body weight, using every single muscle of your body. The workouts are short and VERY effective. Your muscles hurt and you sweat!  If you have a laptop or an iPad, you're set and ready to go. My kids love the workouts as well. Her workoiare fun and her voice is soothing!! You will not be disappointed, I promise! Excuses or solutions, you decide!!",1457568000,2,474,4.2555555555555555
8716699,5,B00XV6WW1K,"This is an amazing Ab workout!!  Natalie Jill is so motivating and really teaches you how to do the exercises correctly so you get the results.  I love this DVD!  You can do a quick 10 minute ab workout or you can do the whole DVD for a real Ab scorcher!  You will love this workout.  I'm down 20 lbs and 22.5"" in 2.5 month using Natalie's fitness and nutrition programs.",1457568000,3,371,4.169014084507042
