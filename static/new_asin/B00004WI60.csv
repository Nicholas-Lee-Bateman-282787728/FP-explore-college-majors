PULSE: What do you do--and where do you go--when your own house is trying to kill you? This suburban horror story casts a sly eye on sinister images of ordinary household items. We all take electricity for granted; the insidious center of this flick lies in investing energy itself with a malevolent intelligence, made all the more chilling by its amorphous nature and ubiquitous presence. Mesmerizing close-ups of circuits, dissolving wire wraps, and solder melting and reforming as the current reprograms the appliances make the most mundane machines appear malicious.

Pulse begins slowly, but builds into a killer thriller in the final half hour and includes some excellent effects in the finale, as the house literally holds the humans hostage. Former teen idol Joey (""Whoa!"") Lawrence is cute, but Tyner, as the eccentric old electrician who provides the exposition, is the real scene-stealer.

1364891,5,B00004WI60,"This movie had my attention from the beggining. The way the script was made; the actors, the plot, the overall experience was just fascinating. I highly recommend it.",1353542400,,166,4.964285714285714
1364892,3,B00004WI60,"This is a pretty '80s movie which doesn't really push any boundaries. The characters are all pretty much one dimensional stereotypes. There's the divorced dad who is trying to build a career, a new relationship, and a future with his son, in roughly that order. He's dating the generic 80's woman who has a job and is smart and caring about her step son but still has womanic moments like emotional things and screaming every now and then. And the kid who is into baseball and skateboarding, what a big surprise.

On the other hand its pretty baller to watch their house go ballistic around them and Charles Tyner plays a crazy old whack job who knows about what's going on and really sells it. He's the best actor in this thing because he's the only one obviously not taking it seriously and just having fun being nuts. The whole ""intelligent killer electricity"" basically lacks a motive other than torturing people to death and driving them crazy, and isn't really even a character. But it's a worthy predecessor to modern things like Final Destination and sci fi channel originals except those newer films actually made money for their backers. Which Pulse obviously didn't do.

If for some stupid reason this movie were made today, it would star some teenagers and have government-conspiricy connections and things. Instead we get Roxanne Hart, who was 36 at the time this was made but she's still authentically cute instead of being fake sexy. She has a shower scene but again its the 80s so all the nudity is shoulders and up and implied. Which is still kind of hot.

People who are jaded about horror movies would think Pulse is kind of soft and boring but if you like cheap made for TV stuff there's some pretty funny things here.",1345680000,,1738,4.673202614379085

It has a creepy atmosphere and a great cast including Charles Tyner as a mysterious old man and Joseph Lawrence as the kid victim nobody will believe. It seems an evil energy is invading homes through the electrical lines, and one of the best effects is how it melts solder on circuit boards to rewire them to it's purpose. At first the strange appliance failures are blamed on bad luck, but in the end even the boy's father is convinced and takes action.

This PULSE has taken up residence in a transformer just outside David's new abode, and has already jolted a neighbor to death! I was expecting another hilarious appliances-gone-mad movie like GHOST IN THE MACHINE, and was a bit disappointed by the ultra-slow build-up and lack of killer dishwashers, but the story was fairly engaging in a sappy sort of way. Joey Lawrence was a decent actor for his age, and should have done more than become a teen semi-icon. Oh well...",1224720000,,764,4.8396946564885495
1364899,3,B00004WI60,"I purchased this DVD from the bargain bin at a audio store and the movie itself was OK, more like a made-for-TV movie. While the acting was fine, the plot was somewhat weak. Unfortunately, as another reviewer note, no explanation was given as to why these strange occurences (the electricity gone berserk) were happening--what it meant--or what all of this was leading to. Instead, the individuals beset with these ordeals were thought to be merely crazy.  The story would have been so much better if the script had been the story of one family's struggle against a more widespread phenomenon. These inexplicable events did happen across the street at the opening of the movie--it must have been also happening elsewhere. This change in plot would likely have resulted in a higher budget and a larger cast, and that is probably why it was not done. However, there is one segment towards the end of the film where the special effects are quite good; this helps redeem the movie.

The transfer to DVD of this 2005 edition is superb--one of the best that I have ever seen. The format is anamorphic widescreen, enhanced for 16 x 9 TV screens--so the image fills the entire screen.  I did not realize that ""Pulse"" was a relatively old (1988) film--I thought it was a relatively new (later than 2005) movie, based on its fantastic picture and sound quality. I have a large-screen high-definition TV and a Toshiba 1080p HD DVD player. Viewed on this system, this movie looked outstanding: High-definition (crystal clear picture, no grain whatsoever, great color) with great sound quality to match. This film might be scary to a younger audience, but not to adults.",1217116800,,1657,4.848056537102473

1364931,5,B00004WI60,"Pulse is a little seen movie from 1988 starring Cliff DeYoung, Roxanne

of their own? Or are all the strange goings on due to logical explana-
tions?  12 year old Joey is terrified while visiting his dad's house in
L.A. following his parent's divorce.  Seems the TV and washer and dis-
posal have a mind of their own.  Creepy moments and a few scares and
shocks(no pun intended) ensue.  The films biggest weakness is its in-
ability to fully explain the goings on, though the ending is satisfactory.",1196899200,,641,4.6371681415929205
1364932,3,B00004WI60,"I have a mental block...whenever I hear the name of actor Cliff De Young, I immediately picture Dennis De Young, former lead singer of the band Styx.  So when I saw Cliff De Young was one of the stars of the film Pulse (1988), I thought to myself ""Wow, I didn't know Mr. Roboto made a movie.""  Interestingly enough, Cliff did actually start out in the music industry in a band called Clear Light, in the late 1960s.  Once the group broke up, he began appearing on Broadway, eventually making it into movies.  Written and directed by Paul Golding (Beat Street), the film Pulse features, as I mentioned, Cliff De Young (The Hunger, F/X, The Skateboard Kid), who, as far as I can tell, has no relation to the former lead singer of the band Styx, along with Roxanne Hart (Highlander), and Joseph `Joey' Lawrence (Summer Rental, Adventures in Babysitting).  Also appearing is Charles Tyner (The Longest Yard, The Outlaw Josey Wales, Evilspeak), Robert `Mike Damone' Romanus (Fast Times at Ridgemont High), and brother to Joey, Matthew Lawrence (Planes, Trains & Automobiles, Mrs. Doubtfire)...do the Lawrence's implement some kind of contractual obligation where depending on which one you want in your film, you must also take one of the brothers?

All right, the film starts off with lighting striking a power station, and an odd surge makes its way through the system...well, I don't suppose that good for anyone.  Following the power lines out, we're eventually taken to a Californian suburb, specifically the home of Bill (De Young) and Ellen (Hart) Rockland.  Seems there's a disturbance, followed by silence, in the house across the street, and the police are called.  What the authorities find isn't pretty (a dead body), but certainly odd (severe, electrical and flooding damage).  Later on Bill retrieves his son David (Joey Lawrence) from the airport (seems Bill and his wife, David's mother, are divorced, and Bill has since remarried), as David is going to spend the summer with his father and stepmother.  David's kind of a poison pill, as he's obviously not too psyched about spending the summer away from home, despite Bill and Ellen's attempt to make the best of things (I think David is in need of a kick in the pants).  Anyway, some stuff happens and the appliances in the house begins to act all wicky wacky, at least initially around David.  David learns a bit about what happened in the death house across the street from his new friend Stevie (Matthew Lawrence), and begins to put two and two together (to get six).  Bill thinks David's fears are irrational and stem from separation anxiety, or something like that, but Ellen also begins to notice the strangeness.  Soon afterwards, it appears a malicious spirit has entered the Rockland home through the power lines, and is now intent on killing everyone utilizing appliances, power tools, and what not as its weapons of choice.  Will the Rockland's  be able to `pull the plug', or will they get their fuses permanently blown by the malicious entity inhabiting the wiring of their house?

I thought this movie was decent (in a TV movie sort of way), but I was a little disappointed the malignant force that came through the power lines wasn't a little more clearly defined...I mean, what the heck was it?  A satanic spirit?  Devilish demon?  Pesky poltergeist? Spunky specter?  I don't always need everything to be explained away, but given the amount of attention given to this indeterminate evil, some elucidation would have been appreciated (you can tell its evil because when it got into the television and/or VCR and messed up David's rental tape, and Ellen ended up having to buy the now defective VHS tape from the video store for $60...EEEEVIL!).  While I though Cliff De Young did a decent job, I really didn't care much for his character, specifically in the beginning as it seemed the arrival of his son was more of an imposition at times rather than something he really wanted (both he and his wife Ellen seemed conspicuously absent much of the time)...in his defense, David was kind of a snotty kid in general (check out the scene where he's going to steal the family car and drive himself to the airport).  I think the one aspect, with regards to the characters, that annoyed me more than anything else in this film was something I'd guess the director probably had little control over, and that was the casting of both the Lawrence boys in the film.  The boys were supposed to be neighbor kids, but seriously, given their obvious, physical similarities, were we really supposed to believe they were just two unrelated boys from different families?  I suspect when the filmmakers tried to cast Joey Lawrence, the Lawrence family and/or manager agreed only after foisting the younger Matthew (who was just a little too cute, for my tastes, sporting his soup bowl haircut) on the production.  I really despise this sort of Hollywood nepotism, unless it actually fits within the scheme of the story (i.e. casting the boys as brothers within the story).  I suppose it's unfair for me to take this out on the film itself, but it did stick in my craw.  As far as Roxanne Hart, I thought she did well enough up until the point when her character started wigging out, with very little incentive.  The basis for her freak seemed less than necessary, at least prior to the sequence involving her and the shower (the water heater kicked into overdrive).  I think my favorite performance came from character actor Charles Tyner, as the nutty old man/contract laborer working on the death house across the street.  His role was nothing new, as horror films often feature a curmudgeonly old timer issuing a dire warning based on some knowledge garnered solely on the basis of having lived longer than anyone else, but I never tire seeing it... Golding's direction works well enough (even if his story faltered a little), as he does manage to create suspense in a few scenes, even if the logic behind the scene wasn't readily apparent.  If you enjoy countless scenes of a young Joey Lawrence sticking his nose where he shouldn't, extreme close ups on circuitry and melty solder, and appliances acting strangely on their own accord, then you're in for a real treat here.

The widescreen (1.85:1) anamorphic picture on this DVD looks very good, and the Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo comes through clearly (hear that electricity crackle!).  There are no extras included, except for a standard listing of unrelated trailers of other Sony Pictures DVD releases (Sony purchased the MGM library sometime last year) including the dreadful Frankenfish (2004), Devour (2005), Vampires: The Turning (2005), and the television miniseries Kingdom Hospital (2004).

Cliff DeYoung is lifeless in his role as dad; Roxanne Hart brings some conviction to her role as the new wife.

Just the thought of an intelligent Alien life form manipulating, tapping into circuitry and recking havoc, is disturbing enough.  Pretty cool sci-fi 80's movie. Definetely an eirie one.",1106438400,,273,4.891304347826087
1364936,5,B00004WI60,"Its a shame this video isn't out on DVD yet. My VHS copy is slowly deteriorating. But anywho, I first saw this film in kingergarten (yeah haha), and to this day, still love it. Its basically about an almost supernatural ""pulse"" that invades homes and turns every electrical appliance into a weapon under its control. I won't spoil anything, you'll have to see it for yourself. I certainly enjoyed it.",1067212800,,400,4.728571428571429
1364937,3,B00004WI60,"This is a moderately entertaining film about a house in which the electricity, the appliances, the boiler, the garbage disposal, the television, the water...ok,ok, you get my drift...become deadly threats to those who live in that house.
Eleven year old David (Joey Lawrence) goes to stay with his father, Bill (Cliff De Young), and his second wife, Ellen (Roxanne Hart), David's new step-mother, for the summer in their new house. They do everything to make him comfortable. David learns from a neighborhood friend, however, that the house next door was destroyed in a terrible, violent tragedy that cost the  occupants their lives.
One night while home alone, David notices that the television seems to take on a life of its own. Soon, he begins to hear the house pulsating, as does Ellen. Bill, however, decides otherwise, thinking them inordinately paranoid, until he, too, hears the pulsating. Then, look out! It is every man for himself.
There is a fair amount of tension in the film, but it is still fairly predictable. The performances, however, are good, and the film manages to entertain, if not electrify, the viewer. It is a film worth renting, not buying.",1031443200,,1168,4.98974358974359
1364938,5,B00004WI60,"Ellen, the young boy's stepmother, gets involved in this frightening story quite by accident in the shower. It is necessary to actually tear apart the shower door to attempt to save her. The ""Pulse"" is in the TV, the electricity, the hot water... everywhere. Naturally nobody believes them when they try to explain what it is. I have watched this video several times and I'm still not sure myself. A real thriller: Get it while you can.

1364939,3,B00004WI60,"You can't SEE it.  You can't HEAR it.  But you can FEEL it.  And it's growing stronger and more deadly by the minute. It turns televisions,  microwaves, computers, dryers and furnaces into demonic weapons of  destruction.  It's PULSE--an electrifying tale of terror starring Cliff De  Young, Roxanne Hart and Joey Lawrence.  At first, 11-year-old David  (Lawrence) is excited about visiting his dad Bill (De Young) and stepmother  Ellen (Hart) for the summer.  But when he discovers that the house next  door was violently destroyed and the old man living there electrocuted,  David begins to panic.  Even in his own home, the lights...the  appliances...the electrical systems are taking on an evil, vengeful life of  their own.  David and Ellen know something is wrong, but Bill just thinks  they're paranoid.  Is it crazy to fear that ""power"" can destroy  you...if it wants to?  From writer/director Paul Golding comes a  well-crafted thriller that will keep your heart pounding.  It's PULSE...the  ultimate shocker.",966556800,,1018,5.2578616352201255
