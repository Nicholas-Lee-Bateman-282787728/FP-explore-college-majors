3856802,5,B0026RLM98,i am love to hear Nostradamus' predictions. i have used this vendor before and never had any trouble at all.,1355097600,4,108,4.45
3856803,5,B0026RLM98,"I cannot explain the attraction that this set of DVDs holds over my imagination.  I do not believe that Nostradamus was a ""great prophet"" nor that his ""prophesies"" actually predicted much of anything, but he is a fascinating individual none-the-less.  And I have viewed this DVD set again and again and enjoyed it every time.

""The Lost Book of Nostradamus"" and the ""Nostradamus 2012"" DVDs also fascinate me.  And again, they do this in spite of my non-believer status as to their actual factual relevance.  The whole set is well produced and it's one of my very favorite DVD sets.",1331769600,15,581,4.77

8353494,4,B0026RLM98,"This is two disks. the first is about a book that has become known to exist and it appears to be associated with Nostradamus. His history is given which explains he was a Frenchman in the 1500's who made predictions. He had to be careful of what he said because the Royals and/or the Church could have his head if they felt what he was saying was a threat to them so what he predicts is written in the form of poems. In the extras Penn and Teller appear as the works of Nostradamus are evaluated from 500 years later, some of his predictions are shared which are insightful but not clear until after the fact.

Disc 2 is about 2012 and if Nostradamus and the Maya were on the same page. December 21, 2012, anything?",1518652800,,715,4.257352941176471

8353500,5,B0026RLM98,"surprisingly a lot of content on these 2 dvds
the first dvd holds The lost book o f Nostradamus and this feature also comes with some extra additional scenes that comes with its own menu. The other extra on the disc is a 2nd full documentary Nostradamus 500 years later. This documentary extra has no other extras
On the second disc is Nostradamus 2012. and this Documentary comes with a few extra added scenes- however unlike the first one these have no menu to go with them- when you enter the extras for this dvd it just takes you straight to viewing a few extra added scenes.
I have always been a fan of documentaries and I own several history channel dvd documentaries. The added extras are a big pus for this set because the only other History Channel DVD that has any extra's that I have run across at least up to this is point is the Davinci and the code he lived by- Documentary.
Those even remotely interested in Nostradamus will find this documentary series dvd a good place to start and fans of Nostradamus will definitely enjoy this",1413244800,,1045,4.476439790575916
8353501,5,B0026RLM98,Great story about Nosrtra. Very interesting.,1406678400,,44,6.5
8353502,5,B0026RLM98,This is a fun to watch Documentary  and interesting. Not sure if these predictions will come true or not but interesting DVD if you like to be open minded about the topic. Nostradamus was a interesting man for his time and his  predictions on the Future holds our curiosity.,1391558400,,274,4.571428571428571
8353503,5,B0026RLM98,"I have been interested in and read Nostrodamous Quatrains for many years.
This book not only covers his life, but does interpret his quatrains from the original French, translated by many scholars.
Well worth the price.",1364774400,6,219,5.111111111111111
