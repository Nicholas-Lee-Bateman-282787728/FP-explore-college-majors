8242959,2,B0011YZVOY,I saw this movie at the drive in when I was about 5 years old. Later as an adult I tried hard to find it but could not remeber the title. In my childhood memories I remebered this movie as grand entertainment. After years of searching on the internet I finally found out the title and bought it on Amazon. This movie tries hard to blend action with comedy. It does not work. Also the film score seems like it should be from another movie and it is very distracting. Okay but be warned.,1347667200,,485,4.170212765957447
8242960,2,B0011YZVOY,"Bought this DVD (Amazons and Supermen) because I know one of the actresses.

There is a tenuous plot, but the acting is at best so-so and I could barely make it to the end.  We won't go into the special effects, such as they were.  Regrettably, the director/producer had aspersions to fame and the ""ending"" clearly pointed to a sequel rather than terminating the movie.  I don't know if there is a sequel, but free might be too expensive a price to pay for a copy of the sequel.

The best I can say is that
 -- I've seen far far worse movies
 -- they used nice horses, and (for the most part) the actors/actresses could actually ride them.

I give it a two star for the horses and riders, if you aren't a horse person this would be a less than one star event.",1296691200,,759,4.186206896551724
8242961,4,B0011YZVOY,"The story is typical of the genre. You know ,Amazons threaten village. The villagers fight back with the aid of three men who have almost super human abilities. One of the three seems to spend most of his time on a trampoline. The best part of the movie are the Amazons. They definitly look the part. They run around in bikinis. Wonderfull eye candy.",1237075200,2,350,4.484375
8242962,5,B0011YZVOY,"IT WAS GOOD. I LIKE THE FIRST PART WHICH FEATURED THE FIGHT BETWEEN TWO AMAZONS FOR THE TITLE ""QUEEN"".
I AM INTERESTED IN PURCHASING ""WAR GODDESS"". IT FEATURED A WRESTLING MATCH BETWEEN TWO AMAZONS IN A CAVE FOR THE TITLE ""QUEEN"". HOWEVER, I UNDERSTAND SOME VERSIONS ELIMINATED THIS PART. COULD YOU TELL ME IF I WAS TO ORDER ""WAR GODDESS"" IS THIS WRESTLING SCENE ELIMINATED ?

The film is good, but there is much to be said for the quality of the DVD, which is to say pretty poor. Because of the quality of the DVD, it pushes the rating down to 3 stars out of 5",1207267200,2,363,6.5625
