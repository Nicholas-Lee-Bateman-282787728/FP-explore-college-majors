646417,5,630340264X,"I honestly think that this movie is a lot better than those other people say it is.  Storyline is good, music was absolutely cool, not quite breathtaking, but good enough, and I liked the characters.  I haven't played the game, but this movie was good enough for me.  I call this a purchase, not a rent.  This movie deserves a better chance than the people here have...",973296000,3,369,4.462686567164179
646418,1,630340264X,"This review is another warning for people who for some reason or another may feel some sort of an inclination to purchase this video.  If you enjoy the video game at all then leave this movie be it will disappoint you in  every possible way.  My only gripe is that I bought it when if first game  out so I paid a lot more for this movie, which I painfully regret even to  this day.",957657600,,381,4.026666666666666
646419,2,630340264X,if you are thinking this is giong to be as cool as the video game you might be suprised how much this movie messed up the great image I had for the game! the action is well lame! but you will learn more about the people then you do thru the video game!,953510400,,252,3.7735849056603774
646420,1,630340264X,"I have no idea why AD Vision decided to make this their first dubbed release, but all I can say is that, uh, Shiro Tokisada Amakusa (the bad guy with the makeup)is MALE. Talk about not knowing a production's storyline.  Good thing AD Vision released Dirty Pair, otherwise I might not have  forgiven them for this....",931132800,2,316,4.625
646421,1,630340264X,"This is more of a warning than a review.  Some may be tempted by this title's low price.  Others may consider buying it because they are fans of the popular video game series it is based on.  I warn you all not to be  tempted.  The voice acting in the dubbed version is some of the worst that  I have ever heard.  It is not only poorly done but sometimes entirely  nonsensical (macho fighter characters with girly voices..etc). The dialogue  is silly, insipid and often incoherent. The plot is at best weak.  Characters wander in and out and the story wanders back and forth.  The  animation is the best aspect of this title and it is merely average or a  bit below.  In short, this title is atrocious.  If you want swords and  sorcery action, buy Ninja Scroll and pass on this dog.",924566400,3,782,4.363636363636363
7847151,5,630340264X,Great Movie. I love Amakusa as a girl. Nakoruru is hotter. Jubei Yagyu is Haohmaru's Sensei. Amakusa is better with blue hair but Nakoruru is the best.,1433376000,,151,4.62962962962963
7847152,5,630340264X,This is the first game in the Samurai Showdown series coming to life in animated form. Anyone who has played the original Samurai Showdown will absolutely love this.,1378080000,,165,4.928571428571429
7847153,1,630340264X,"Stay away from this movie.  Keep a distance of 100 yards or greater at all times.  This movie is a total piece of somethin.  Terrible voice overs, ghetto 80's art, dumb plot.  Go buy a value meal or something instead.",1184630400,,217,4.35
7847154,5,630340264X,What a perfect buy and it was great entertaining. I loved the action go see this. I love the game and the motion picture.,1132358400,2,121,4.083333333333333
7847155,3,630340264X,"I have the movie and I agree with both reviewers that there are some bad elements of the movie. I was not too impressed about the battle scenes. I was hoping to have more sequences of the bad guys and the goods guys with all the characters in the movie. Instead they restricted most of the power abilities they could have shown in the movie. If they have took the effort to make a great movie, there would have made enough money to make a trilogy. Within the story line of the games, there was a whole lot more going on in the story then what they showed in the movie. I own the movie and regardless of its aweful film, I bought it because its my favourite game. I am glad another Samurai Shodown game cam out onto the Playstation 2. I was so upset about SNK disapearing forever..(Really the person who made this movie should realize that its a Japanese game, so it should've been spelled correctly. SAMURAI SHODOWN  NO ""W"")

Thanks for reading my review.",1107561600,2,955,4.359550561797753
7847156,1,630340264X,"To put it simply, this is a bad, bad movie, an example of what happens when you try to make a video game into a movie. The animation is badly done, the voice acting sub-par --the voices don't even match the characters very well -- and the frequent action sequences are retro to the extreme and just don't look good.... I'm sorry to everyone who liked this film, but I love all anime, and I couldn't get halfway through this one. Avoid this movie at all costs.",1090540800,2,459,4.287356321839081
7847157,4,630340264X,"I just saw this movie and it was great. I have the movie dubbe in english not english subtitles. When I bought it today, I was amazed at the animation and when Haohmaru defeats Earthquake and
Genan was done beautifully. Although, what was weird is that Ukyo
was on the cover but not in the movie, you only see Ukyo at the Japaneese credits(weird huh?)anywase. A good movie, and a good video game.",1013126400,2,396,4.438356164383562
7847158,3,630340264X,"I am a pretty big anime fan and I am not quick to judge, but this is definetly not on my top ten list.  I rented it having high hopes, but I ended up wishing that I hadn't stayed up to watch it.  Fans of the videogame have probably already seen it, so if your just a person looking for a good anime to watch, find something else.  It looked like it might be good at first, but the plot never went that far, and everything had a kinda vague feeling to it.  It had 2 or 3 good fight scenes, and a little bit of humor, but that's about it.  I would not recommend buying it, but it might be worth renting.
  If you want a good videogame anime, try the Dark Stalkers series.",996192000,2,669,3.911111111111111
7847159,2,630340264X,"Simply put, Samurai Shodown is a below average action anime with average dubbing and average art. It is fighting game anime that takes the story from the game and does pretty much nothing with it. Buuuut, that doesn't mean it doesn't have its good parts. In fact, there is a pretty good dose of drama at the scene that occurs after the part when Haohmaru defeats Earthquake, and it's done very well in the dub. Speaking of dubbing, Haohmaru's voice is great (thank goodness, he's the main character), but supporting roles, uh, suck. Galford shows about as much emotion as Amakusa (which is null, by the way), Hanzo's voice is too deep for its own good, and Gen-An is just plain funny.  The action scenes in this movie are flat out average.
The one thing that almost redeemed the entire movie was the ultra-cool ending theme (not the English credits. Stick around until the Japanese credits roll). Not only does it show additional characters and awesome fight scenes that weren't in the movie (weird), but the nice ending theme, sung in Japanese, is subtitled, with pronunciations! Anyway, if you don't mind a generic plot and want a bit of action, give it a rent.",992995200,3,1163,4.700980392156863
7847160,5,630340264X,"Okay, I will admit, I only figured out that Amakusa was a guy when I watched it the second time around. But tell me, what good anime DOESN'T have some kind of cross-dresser in it?! Anyway, the animation is nice- really clear and bright. And i just love the characters, especially Nakoruru and her hawk! (Ever played Samurai Shodown 2 for NeoGeo Pocket? She looks ADORABLE super-deformed!!)",991180800,,389,4.82089552238806
