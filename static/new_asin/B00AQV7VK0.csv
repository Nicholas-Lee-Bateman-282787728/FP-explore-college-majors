8556639,5,B00AQV7VK0,Nice to have both on bluray.  Image and sound quality are what you would expect.  Snowman is the best of the two.  You will need a region B player.,1434585600,,147,4.0
8556640,2,B00AQV7VK0,Be sure to check the details.  I did not see these discs WILL NOT PLAY ON REGION 1 PLAYERS.  These are region B blu-ray movies (this in not labeled on the packaging).  My daughter is terribly disappointed and I am stuck with open discs that cannot be returned.,1419379200,3,260,4.375
