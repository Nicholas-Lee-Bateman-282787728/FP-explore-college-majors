6464376,5,B00L3ZB9QU,"I gotta say, I saw the entire series including the OVA online and it was subbed and I still enjoyed it, however watching this in English dub is not only an all new experience. The price is amazing! I'm not really the type that cares for the special features, so when I saw this was an S.A.V.E. release, my heart practically jumped out of my chest.

The anime really has no plot in my opinion but the series revolves around a bunch of idiots. Literally, almost everyone in the show in some form is an idiot from the protagonist Aki to even the few minor characters that pop up a few times thoroughout the series.

The series is a romantic comedy with a bunch of love triangles including two gay characters as well which make the series even more interesting. Be prepared for sexual innuendos, for that alone I wouldn't recommend this for kids but other than that it's not that bad.

If you're considering purchasing this anime, just go for it. It's cheap, it's funny, and you'll most definitely want to get the second season, which is also an S.A.V.E. edition as well.

If you enjoy the series, I recommend School Rumble, (for more adult humor), Is This A Zombie, Excel Saga, and Puni Puni Poemi.",1417305600,3,1195,4.493087557603687
6464377,5,B00L3ZB9QU,Just what I expected. A lighthearted comedy that anyone can enjoy.,1415664000,,66,5.090909090909091
6464378,5,B00L3ZB9QU,"Baka & Test is one of my favorite animes. I am one of those people who has watched enough anime that I categorize my favorite animes by genre; example: comedy, romance, romcom, action, etc. You get it. Anyways, Baka & Test, both seasons 1 + 2 are my favorite anime categorized under comedy.

Baka & Test introduces you to a great set of characters that are within a very fun environment. The English dub for Baka & Test is probably one of the best dubs I've ever watched. The characters act together in a seamless fashion in which you can tell the voice actors had a blast working together to make this. The plot, may seem scattered at times, but turns out to have a rather solid storyline. The comedy aspect of the show itself will, without a doubt, keep almost anyone watching, with exceptions.

I will add that the comedy is a rather... how might i put it, stupid comedy. I personally find Akihisa Yoshi, the main character, to be the most fun and lovable of the characters because his personality is just plain stupid-funny. He's not smart to put it simply, actually, none of the characters are all that bright, being as they are all in Class F. Although, Aki is the dumbest of them all. His comments will make you question if he seriously can't catch on to things. In fact, one of the major factors that isn't so much a spoiler is that he's thrown into a sort of ""love-triangle"" between two girls that are in love with him, yet he somehow manages not to know. It's not that he wants to keep them in the friend zone or anything, he's just two stupid to realize that they like him. I do not wish to write a review taking hours for me to try and explain the comedy other than ""stupid-funny."" It may be stupid, but you can clearly see that the writer to the anime executed jokes perfectly, in which so much humor can be happening at once that you will miss it.

Now, back on track. This is my rating of Baka & Test, although it is obviously biased because we all, as human beings, have different senses of humor. For the fact that this is one of my favorite animes, I rate this as a bullseye. A straight-up 10/10.

Oh, P.S. as for some who may be wondering about packaging or something on those lines, my copies of Baka & Test came in nearly perfect condition. The cases had ever so slight cracks, but there is no way I would pin that on Amazon. It was likely because of UPS handling. Anyways, aside from the minor cracks in the cases, the disks are flawless, so no worries there.

Now, being as this was rather a long and uneventful review that I doubt many people will find helpful, I would like to thank anyone who decided to read it all the way through. As I basically stated earlier, Baka & Test has great humor with a fun setting, but it all depends on an individuals personal preference as to whether you will like it or not. I will make note that Season 1 IS on Netflix, and I do highly recommend watching it. Me, being the person I am, watched it all online then bought it because I knew I would want to rewatch it, time and time again.",1413936000,10,3046,4.2904347826086955
6464379,5,B00L3ZB9QU,A great funny anime a good one to watch and own,1457049600,,47,3.3636363636363638
6464380,3,B00L3ZB9QU,"This series is funny as hell! one case where the English dub is way better then the original (for me at least). in a scale of 1 to 10 it's an 8.5
but this DVD transfer is not good - and I don't know why. It's a short series.

I couldn't watch it on my big screen TV, the picture is pix-elated so much its annoying - on the computer it can be viewed just fine + the font for the subtitles is awful - like something out of the 80's

Maybe this is because it's a 'S.A.V.E.' collection but for this series I would gladly paid 10$ more for a better quality product.

I'm happy I got the series, it's just disappointing I can only watch it on my computer or small screen TV.",1457049600,,668,3.933333333333333

6464387,3,B00L3ZB9QU,School life with pet avatars. I'm not sure if this would be a fight anime or a pet monster anime or a school life anime but that would roughly sum things up. Your Avatar combat power is based on your test scores in certain subjects. This story follows the loveable losers in class F (the lowest scoring students). The animation looks cheap. The background most certainly does. I found the show entertaining but its appeal is going to be limited.,1427932800,,445,4.575
