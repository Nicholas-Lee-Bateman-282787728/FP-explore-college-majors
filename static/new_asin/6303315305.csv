626170,5,6303315305,"Disney took its turn to make a baseball movie about 8 years ago, and remade the 1951 movie with the same title. The main team is this movie is (then) Califoral Angles. The movie stars Danny Glover, Branda Flicker, Tony Dnza and Christopher Lloyd (in his last movie of 1994). The Angles are on a losing streak, but still keep two young boys as fans and they are Roger Baumont (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and J.P (Milton Davis Jr).",1036886400,,424,4.51948051948052
626171,3,6303315305,"Here is yet another DVD from Disney which has yet to take advantage of the wonders of this media format.  They have taken a movie which I loved on VHS placed it on DVD widescreen anamorphic in menus ONLY!  THE MOVIE IS IN LETTERBOX..The colors and picture quality are not bad, but why not just do it right the first time.
They just don't get it.

626172,5,6303315305,"I have seen this movie several times and never get tired of it. The acting in the movie is great and the story is cool too.
Roger and JP are two children who live in a foster-home with a kind woman name Maggie. Roger and JP are in love with baseball and the local Anaheim Angels who play only a few blocks from their home. They sneak into every game that they are able to, to watch their beloved team. Roger, however feels sad quite often because he wants to be back with his troubled father. His father made a deal with him that he'd be back to pick him up if the Angels ever won the pennant. During one game Roger see's angels in the outfield helping a player making a catch, and at the plate, helping them hit. But nobody else can see them, not even JP. After they tell the manager about this he has Roger motions to him whenever he sees the angels. Then the Angels start winning after starting off the season very slow. With the help of the angels that Roger sees they win the pennant. Roger gets very sad because he will have to leave Maggie and JP, but his troubled father never comes to pick him up which breaks his heart.
If you are looking for a great, funny baseball movie with a fantasy twist you should check out Angels in the Outfield.",1019952000,,1248,4.182572614107884
626173,5,6303315305,"I loved this movie. I thought the acting was very strong and the story was inspiring. Roger and JP are two young boys living in a foster home under the care of the kindhearted Maggie. JP is your typical adorable and happy-go-lucky (for the most part) kid, but Roger is still hoping that his messed-up father will come back for him. Apparently, Roger's father tells him that he will only come back if the California Angels baseball team--the worst team in the league--wins the pennant. So, Roger becomes an instant fan, and he and JP begin to follow the team. Manager George Knox is bullheaded and about ready to pack up and leave until Roger starts to see angels who just might be able to carry the team where they need to go. All in all, it is just a very good film that has something powerful to say about having faith, pulling together as a team, and forming your own family bonds when the ones that you have are broken. I recommend this one 100%, and it is worth every cent of your money.",1017532800,10,992,4.367567567567567
626174,4,6303315305,"When a 11 year old boy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) lives in a foster home, while his broking down father (Dermot Murloney) cannot takes him. While the boy love of Baseball, his favorite team is the Angels. His wish is to live with his father. But his wish comes true, when he seems true Angels helping the Baseball team a lift.
Directed by William Dear (Harry and the Hendersons) brings a familiar but enjoyable fantasy.

626175,2,6303315305,"Not-very-good remake about a last-place baseball team(the then-California Angels; the now-ANAHEIM Angels, thanks to Disney) which gets their help from Heaven all thanks to a little boy who just wants his father back.
Innocuous plotting and dialogue doesn't help much and why in the HECK would anyone want their kids to think that angels are biased spirits who help random sports teams CHEAT?!? Imagine explaining to your child that the very reason he didn't win was because there were no angels there to help his or her team...
I suppose all that wasn't the point, however. The movie just suffers from over-silliness and shows us that even though we have needless suffering throughout the planet, God will take his angels and let them play ball in order to help a child in need of role model(even though his sweet caregiver will do nicely). And can somebody tell me what kind of an orphanage will let their children go to a baseball game day after day even if it means travelling all over the CONTINENT???
The least favorite of all my favorite sports-movies is still okay for kids but I'm not entirely sure they'll fall for it either.
Followed by ""Angels in the Endzone""(from Disney's quickee-department) and the enomously idiotic ""Angels in the Infield""(from the part of Disney's department that's headed by six-year-olds).",992390400,2,1324,4.968468468468468
626176,1,6303315305,"This movie is not funny (unless you like to watch people to fall down), it's not charming, it's not warm, it's not good.  Like most movies of their genre, the acting is very second rate.  I could only see liking for nostalgic reasons.  The same recycled plot really doesn't capture anything here.  The Disney machine cranks out another loser.",984614400,2,342,4.745762711864407

The days when Walt Disney Pictures spared no detail or effort in teaching both kids and grown-ups their values and morals, including the importance of having a little faith. Plus, if little JP's apprehension about going into Manager George Knox's car was any indication, the writers of Angels in the Outfield even pointed out how children remember the events that changed their lives in the most negative possible way. This picture even introduced Matthew McConaughey, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Christopher Lloyd, the last of these names I would remember throughout my childhood.

Of course star power alone did not propel this film's success nor did it garner attention...not like today's dingy, lamebrain, mediocre-at-best fake Disney things. It was all about dang good storytelling and convincing performances. And it can be about that again. Yeah! It could happen!",1510704000,2,1052,6.255172413793104

Christopher Lloyd was great as the angel Al. Heck, even Matthew McConaughey was in there. Tony Danza's character was my favorite.

626545,5,6303315305,"A beloved movie from the 90's, this was my grandmother's favorite movie and is particularly heartwarming in a humorous sort of way when the goofy angels come to change the game at the request of a boy who wants his dad to take him out of foster care (which the dad promised if the poorly performing baseball team won the championship).  The twist?  Only the boy who prayed can see the angels.  Everyone else is astonished when players who thought they could never win a game suddenly start doing what would have been impossible without the angel's intervention.  Ring leader angel, Al, is great.  Main characters will grow on you.  Each time the coach's change-of-heart and growth into a hero in these two foster kids' lives (seen in middle of movie cover) I cry.  Beautiful story that can bring hope to you even if you don't believe in miracles or angels.",1481414400,2,856,4.629139072847682

I can watch this movie over and over and over again, just like many of my friends.
Wow! This sounds like the Walt Disney movie ""It's A Wonderful Life"" with James Stewart and Donna Reed, another amazing story with an angel. And who says baseball isn't prompted by angels in heavenly places? Being prompted by angels might be the best thing a baseball team could ever want. Yes!!!
This amazing baseball adventure is filled with lots of action and a baseball story that will keep the reader laughing up to the end.

627183,4,6303315305,"Clarence Brown's charming family flick ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD was remade in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1994/dp/B0000633U2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1994</a>&nbsp;with Danny Glover as lead. This 1951 version is superior, however.

The Pittsburgh Pirates are perhaps the losingest team in American sports history. In 1951 (the year this film was released) their won-lost record was a dismal 64-90. No wonder then that this tale of angelic intervention was so popular, especially in the Steel City!

Here, Miss Leigh plays a girl reporter who blames the Pirates' dismal luck on their caustic manager Paul Douglas. When foul-mouthed Douglas starts hearing a divine voice (Whitmore) he vows to change his nasty ways if it will help the team. Sure enough, Pittsburgh goes on a winning streak! An orphan girl (and diehard Pirates fan) claims she can see angels on the field actively helping her team out. In fact, these spirits are deceased all-star players whose assistance may abruptly end if Douglas can't live up to his word.

Fans of baseball history will love this picture for several reasons: it's filmed at old Forbes Field, there's game footage plus cameos of Joe DiMaggio, Ralph Kiner (who slugs a homer) and Ty Cobb (considered by many the greatest baseballer of all time). Also here is Bing Crosby (he owned 15% of the team), songwriter Harry Ruby, Barbara Billingsley (as a hatcheck girl) and Peter Graves (radio announcer). Ed Wood fave Tor Johnson is seen as a wrestler on TV.

Eventually they make it from being the biggest losing team to going to the world series to play against the White Sox. All in all, the movie does warm the heart & is recommended to all who appreciate this kind of wholesome madness involving the fictional mind of a foster child! A must have for all ages.

Danny Glover, Tony Danza, and Christopher Lloyd, are superb in acting performance. This movie has a way of making everyone feel good, as we watch the California Angels swing back into action. The coach played by Danny Glover begins the season with frustration, dealing with a team of misfits, until a young boy shares winning tips from an angel, played by Christopher Lloyd.  As a result, the team  touches the hearts of millions of fans, including all viewers of this inspirational movie. This delightful movie is a mix of comedy,baseball action, and inspiration, with dazzling special effects.

627487,4,6303315305,"Roger and JP are in Maggie's foster home. They're unrelated boys who have become close friends while staying with Maggie. 7-ish JP tags along with 10-ish Roger to nearby Angel Stadium to watch some games, and Roger prays for Divine intervention, believing that an offhanded comment by his father ensures that his family will reunite if the Angels win the American League pennant.

Roger and his father never reunite, but Roger and JP end the movie excited about a promised placement, together, with a prospective adoptive father. This movie could be a good choice for pre-teens and young teens in foster care, if they can get past the cheesy scenes where angels (the Heaven ones, not the California ones) manipulate baseball games. The movie touches on a lot of experiences that kids in foster care sometimes experience: kids they come to care about get moved from the foster home on short notice; expectations of birth family members are sometimes disappointingly unfulfilled; Court appointments interrupt your life. The movie is not without flaws, but it does have some powerful moments and could serve as a powerful conversation starter.",1351641600,7,1140,5.096256684491979

627570,5,6303315305,"I haven't seen this movie since I was atleast twelve years old, and when I thought about whether Amazon had it on DVD, I pratically fainted.  I bought this movie as a suprise to my dad who is coming back from a long business trip; this too is one of his favorite movies.
  But lets get to my... Movie genius opinion.  The movie itself features some star actors such as: Christopher Loyd, Danny Glover, and Matthew Mconaughey.  All of them are on my top favorite actors, Mostly Christopher Loyd, after his roll in my all time favorite Movies; Back To The Future, Parts 1 through 3.
  Danny Glover and Matthew Mconaughey, play as Baseball players on the Team, California Angels.  When young Roger desides to pray for the first time in his life to my all time favorite person; God.  God then sends some of his angels to help out the Baseball team, Angels; Hmmm how ironic.
  Christopher Loyd plays as Al, The captian of the Angels.
If you wanna see what happens next you'll just have to buy the movie.
I would recommend this movie to anyone, it okay for kids but Danny Glover does swear in the movie but its only brief, I'll bet if you didn't have the subtitles on, the kids won't even notice.
Great story, Great actors, Great Ending; just buy the movie and stop reading this review already.

At the press conference, the statements about God and angels are so vague, bland and incoherent as to call into question the wisdom of including angels in the plot at all. Based on the press conference, the movie should have been called whatchamacallits in the thingamajig. Why was the Mel Clark disease plot point sprung on us unless it was to jerk more tears? Was there any other plot point that wasn't telegraphed like a pitcher with a tell?

627729,3,6303315305,"In an attempt to repeat the magic and financial success they had with `The Mighty Ducks' (92) two years previously, Disney turned their attention to major league baseball and the hometown Angels. Deciding to do a remake of the '51 film `Angels in the Outfield' which starred Paul Douglas they had all they needed available right from the beginning; a tried and true storyline to work from and access to a local, professional baseball team. What could make things more perfect? Well how about the fact that the team in question just happened to be named the Angels fitting perfectly into the title and theme of the proposed film! Ahh..., the genius of the Disney machine is a beautiful thing to observe isn't it?

The end result of their endeavors, `Angels in the Outfield' is definitely a kid friendly film that the whole family can not only enjoy but the wise parent may even be able to use some aspects of the storyline as ""teachable moments"" with their children. Maybe a conversation on the plight of the orphan and the importance of parenting might be in order, or on a more personal, human potential level how confidence in yourself and your own abilities can lead to miraculous achievements? if you're more spiritually oriented you may wish to use the film to initiate a discussion on the existence and function of angels and the role of faith? One that immediately comes to mind is the warning that smoking is hazardous to your health (remember at the end when Al (Christopher Lloyd) the boss angel informs Roger (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) that one of the players will be playing for the REAL Angels soon due to his twenty year smoking habit). Leave it to Disney to not only entertain, but instruct (I hope you realize I'm being facetious).",1225670400,,1743,4.733552631578948

  Of course, Roger doesn't really catch his Dad's sarcasm, so he then asks God to help his favorite baseball team, the California Angels, win the pennant.  Soon after, Roger actually SEES angels coming from the sky to help his team prevail.
  What follows is a sports-fantasy that should keep children very entertained, which makes the film a success, for children are obviously its target audience, but adults may like it as well.  The movie's special effects are indeed special, and the story provides a nice, uplifting ending.

627835,5,6303315305,"This is one film I am aiming to get on DVD. But even on VHS, this film sparkles. The cynical amazon review talks about the effects  heavy side of the film, but I guess I must have seen another film, since I thought that the material was treated with respect, and done as unobtrusively as you can possibly do with the appearance of Angels.
The cast is excellent, and I feel that this film works in a great way, not simply because it is a Disney film. Forget the comments that slate this film as cheezy, or sugary... it is just plain wonderful.
The brief appearance of the kid's Dad is memorable in retrospect, since it is played by the actor who also appears in ABOUT  SCHMIDT, and does a wonderful job there as well.
Danny Glover fills an absolutely brilliant role as the coach, and eventually fills bigger shoes in the lives of the two main children.
Tony Danza plays a very accessable role as a ""has-been"" pitcher, who is given one final moment of glory thanks to the magic of the Angels, and the intercession of the young child  lead ( you can see why when you watch the film). It is all very heart warming stuff in many ways, and whilst it has a lesson or two for many people, it is mainly very fine entertainment.
Christopher Lloyd does a great job as the lead Angel, and the ancilliary  Angels are great as well.

Then Roger says ""wheres the nachos"" and he sits right on them. ""im saving them for later"" is his answer. Makes me laugh all the time for some reason. Danny Glover delivers a great performance as the ""pissed off coach, coaching a horrible team""...But with Gods angels helping the real life baseball angels, the team is no longer horrible.

He eventually convinces the manager to put certain players into the game. His choices seem to be the players who have not proven themselves all year. The ball game announcer mocks the decisions but is amazed as they perform the most unusual outstanding maneuvers which turns the luck of the team into winners. Knox, the manager, is finally convinced that Roger sees something and reluctantly follows his suggestions which keeps the Angels on a winning streak.

Both Roger and JP are foster-children of Maggie. Soon after one of the children in the foster home has been adopted, Roger goes for a custody hearing. There he discovers his own dad does not want him. Roger is given to the state of California for custody. Roger's hearing takes place on the day of a crucial game. He can not make it and without his help the Angels lose. Nonetheless, the Angels made it to the World Series. Knox is worried since he lost the previous game whether or not his team can win. It turns out Roger meets the head angel-in-the-outfield who lets him in on a secret, Mel Clark, the pitcher has cancer and only 6 months left to live, however he does not know it yet. It turns out that the Angels playing in the World Series are not permitted to receive help from the angels-in-the-outfield. The ball players must win this one on their own power ...

Needless to say, one can guess the ending ... However, the plot thickens, as the announcer of the ball game suspects some trick in the Angels winning streak. He tells the newspapers that the manager believes their winning streak is due to divine intervention, in the form of angels. Due to this revelation, the owner of the team wants to fire the manager. Just when Knox intends to announce his resignation at a news conference, there is an unexpected turn of events. The ball players stick together and each stands up declaring, if the manager leaves so will they. The team goes on to win the World Series and the foster children reeive a big surprise, too. They are adopted by an unlikely ""father"". This story will touch the heart of children and adults alike. It is a ""feel good"" story filled with poignant moments and heart-warming results.

627841,3,6303315305,"""Angels in the Outfield"" is a charming family film from Disney, certainly one of their better live-action productions. The story's premise is somewhat silly - a boy wishes that the Angels will win the pennant so that his father will take care of him again and he can leave his foster home. Nonetheless, it's perfectly-executed, in the style of '90s Disney films that work (such as Man of the House, Jungle 2 Jungle, Cool Runnings).
""Angels"" blends comedy and drama without ever feeling like either element is forced. Kudos must go to the cast. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does an apt job in his starring role as Roger, and Danny Glover puts energy and heart into his performance as Angels manager George Knox. Christopher Lloyd is wired to comedic effect, as usual. Tony Danza is compassionate as a troubled, aging pitcher. Supporting cast does well, also - Milton Davis Jr. is likable as Roger's friend J.P., and Tony Longo provides some comic power. You'll also recognize some faces that have gone on to get lead work in a number of notable films, including Matthew McConaughey, Neal McDonough (TV's ""Boomtown"") and Adrien Brody.
Cynical audiences will surely find fault with the moralistic and uplifting tale of a last place team working their way to the top with some divine intervention. The rest of us will enjoy a very fun movie that is solid family viewing.
The DVD just barely makes it to first base. The good: the film is presented in widescreen and 5.1 Dolby Digital. The bad: the transfer is a direct port of the laserdisc, not enhanced for 16x9 televisions, and not as sharp or clear as you'd hope. Worst of all, after waiting for several years for the film to come to DVD - there's not a single extra feature. Not even the memorable theatrical trailer. More effort should have gone into the DVD presentation for this wonderful family film.
Nonetheless, it's appropriately low-priced, and the movie is a home run. Highly recommended.",1061942400,,1939,4.8258258258258255
627842,3,6303315305,"I have heard many people say that this version of ""Angels in the Outfield"" is vastly inferior to the original 1954 movie. Well, if that's the case, the original must have been pretty darn spectacular, because this movie is very well-done. Roger and J.P. are foster children living under the temporary care of a kind woman named Maggie. Roger is the main character. His mother is dead, and his troubled father rarely visits, even when he promises to. One day, however, his father jokingly says that they have as much chance of being a family again as the last-place California Angels (now the Anaheim Angels) have to win the pennant. Roger takes this statement at face value and prays for heavenly help, which soon arrives in the form of angels who actually come onto the playing field to assist the team. This begins a wonderful summer in which the players, along with their disgruntled manager, start to believe in themselves and find the value of teamwork and courage. Although this is a good film for the entire family (only some very mild profanity and the awkward parent scenes are carried out appropriately), there are several issues that will not be missed by knowledgable (older) viewers. For example, the potential for racial trouble involving the manager and the two boys at the end of the film (I don't want to give it away!) is completely skipped over, although it is a very likely scenario. Although, it is a Disney movie, so everything is supposed to be too good to be true!
