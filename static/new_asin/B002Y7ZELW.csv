4012309,5,B002Y7ZELW,I have a new perspective on my own emotional life as a result of this documentary.  I have been able to re-evaluate many of my asumptions and find contentment and peace. Daniel Gilbert's interview of Dr. Siegelman and the develpment of positive psychology gave me personal hope.  He has gone beyond brain imaging research to speak in plain English of how these discoveries can make a difference in our lives.,1284768000,,408,4.814285714285714
4012310,5,B002Y7ZELW,It is a super compilation of recent studies by incredibly re-known medical institutions and universities that allows us to understand a lot better why we feel the way we feel and that we never know why others feel or act the way they do.,1278806400,,237,4.409090909090909
4012311,2,B002Y7ZELW,"I just watched Episode 2 of this program and was troubled by what I felt was a major bias toward medication, cognitive behavioural therapy, and the desire to believe that depression and other problems are ""nothing more than physical problems with the brain,"" as the host gleefully proclaims when he is shown ""evidence"" that anti-depressants actually grow cells in the brain! Are experiments on rats really indicative of how the human brain and mind will respond to these things?

For a show entitled ""This Emotional Life,"" there wasn't much in-depth discussion about the nature of these emotions, where they stem from, and the forces that shape emotions and people. There was zero discussion about the unconscious, and our emotional life in *that* realm of our selves. No talk of dreams, of unspoken desires or socially unacceptable feelings and ideas; the stuff that gets repressed by our social and cultural expectations and end up coming out as crippling neurotic symptoms.

The young woman who ended up receiving ECT...did anyone delve into who she was as a person? Talk to her about how she REALLY feels? What kind of real emotions lay under her depression, like anger and rage? If so, it wasn't presented in the program. Basically, she saw a psychiatrist, tried meds, and ended up with ECT, which didn't seem to help her much. There was no discussion about her relationship with her family, and what feelings might be simmering there.

Once again, we have a program about mental illness that looks for (and promotes) the quick fix through CBT, psychiatry and - of course - medication, while glossing over or totally ignoring the inner life of the person. In our culture, we so badly want to attribute things like depression and anxiety exclusively to some purely physical ""defect"" in the brain that it's absurd. Being depressed is NOT like having diabetes. If it was, then medication would work for everyone.

Mr. Gilbert, how about some consideration of the human psyche? The soul? The dark side of our experience? What about dreams? Repressed emotions? Maybe these ideas are too arcane for Harvard these days.

We ignore our deep inner life at our own peril. This program seemed like an ad for CBT, medication, and the 'physical illness' approach to treating mental illness, not a program about the human soul or a real emotional life.",1263427200,66,2343,4.936548223350254
4012312,4,B002Y7ZELW,"i loved this series....such interesting facts... but i think its only  an introduction for all of the themes & cases presented.... i wish it was at least 12 hours of content , but that it explained in a more detailed way every case, theory, study etc...!....i still wanted more ansewers....more insight on the cases...more more more....",1263340800,6,336,5.0
4012313,5,B002Y7ZELW,"Although I almost never watch tv... I turned this on while I was nursing.  I had so much to do and was just mesmerized by it... I couldn't turn it off and I didn't have a way to tape it.  I think the part about bullying should be part of ""required seeing"" for elementary, junior high, and high schoolers.  The young black couple with four children was a poignant story of working through marital problems that I think many people with young children or communication issues could relate to.  It was just a terrific documentary.  I have seen less than half of the entire 360 minutes, and it was well worth the time spent.",1262995200,3,620,4.4035087719298245
4012314,5,B002Y7ZELW,"I cannot express how insightful watching this was for me, very thought provoking.  If I could afford it I would buy this DVD for every person I know.  This DVD makes me happy because I know the knowledge it shares will change my life for the better from here on out, it gives you such an amazing new way to look at everything.  Totally Amazing!",1262908800,33,344,4.2615384615384615
4012315,4,B002Y7ZELW,"I just saw this 6-hour presentation on PBS.  It deals with emotions, happiness, and related neurobiology.  The host is Daniel Gilbert, a Harvard psychologist who is very qualified for this role.  The presentation presents interesting findings from studies during the past few decades, many of which may not be well-known to the general public and may therefore be eye-opening, so I can recommend it to people new to this topic.

However, for people already somewhat familiar with this topic, or who want to go into more depth, this presentation may feel somewhat superficial relative to its length, and so more in the ""edutainment"" category, though I did find some of the case studies to be very interesting, especially those dealing with married couples.

To go beyond this presentation, I highly recommend reading some of the excellent books on this topic, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stumbling-on-Happiness/dp/1400077427/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stumbling on Happiness</a>&nbsp;by Daniel Gilbert himself,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Happiness-Hypothesis-Finding-Modern-Truth-in-Ancient-Wisdom/dp/0465028020/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom</a>&nbsp;by Jonathan Haidt, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Geography-of-Bliss-One-Grump-s-Search-for-the-Happiest-Places-in-the-World/dp/0446580260/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Geography of Bliss: One Grump's Search for the Happiest Places in the World</a>&nbsp;by Eric Weiner (three of my favorites).

Also, Gilbert is doubtful about much of self-help literature, though he acknowledges that some of it is good and useful.  In this regard, I highly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Self-Help-Stuff-That-Works/dp/0962465674/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Self-Help Stuff That Works</a>&nbsp;by Adam Khan.",1262822400,97,2016,8.136363636363637
4012316,5,B002Y7ZELW,"This 3-part program that aired on PBS is simply stunning.  It is something that everyone should watch to see how our emotions (good or bad) impact our life and to see how they impact not only us, but those around us.  My husband (35) and I (31) were captivated by the TV during those nights this show was on.  I will not hesitate to purchase this on DVD!

Amazing program.",1262822400,12,372,4.271428571428571
4012317,5,B002Y7ZELW,"This was aired on Channel 13 (PBS) for the last three nights from 9 p.m. to 11:p.m.  ""This Emotional Life"" is extremely educational in all areas.  From babies to the elderly.  Depression, happiness, anger and helplessness in all ages.  I am a 66 yr. old female, a mother, grandmother and friend to many.  I would recommend this highly.",1262736000,40,335,4.706896551724138
4012328,2,B002Y7ZELW,"The narrator really got on my nerves midway through this, lots of repetition, and maybe the intended pedagogy is for a different audience, but I didn't learn anything.  What helped the Vietnam vet with PTSD?  talking?  pretty boring, disappointed with PBS",1480204800,,255,5.170731707317073
4012329,4,B002Y7ZELW,"This Emotional Life is a very entertaining documentary that anyone can relate to. I was spellbound by these three DVDs that explore the lives of very emotionally healthy or unhealthy individuals. This program discusses anger, depression, fear, happiness and anxiety. It was fascinating to see one girl go through depression and finally recover fully. Some of the people interviewed also suffered from PTSD and learned how to manage their condition. The section on the adopted child who can't relate to his parents is a bit sad but even in that story there is some hope.

If you are interested in psychology at all or just want to figure out your own emotions this presentation is helpful in that regard. By watching this you will learn a few secrets to happiness and also understand yourself and others much more.

One thing this set of DVDs does not cover is religious feelings of say love for God that can make a person very happy. There is a brief section on Buddhist meditation. So mostly this documentary focuses on non religious subjects and emphasizes scientific discovery and evolution of the brain. There are also interviews with very famous people like Dr. Phil. Oprah's picture flashes on the screen but no interview. Louise Hay is also featured and talks about thinking positively. Some famous actors and musicians are also interviewed which makes this all the more interesting.

However there is some good information on how to stop bullying which makes this well worth watching. Daniel Gilbert is also an excellent host and makes each stage of watching this enjoyable. He knows how to ask the right questions to engage the viewer fully.

This may take a few days to watch as it is six hours long. But I felt it was time well spent as it taught me about my own humanity and will now help me to relate more empathetically to others.

It offers a balanced presentation that offers an insight into the lives of those who experience fear, depression and the perceived 'negative' emotions with the science behind them and places these emotions within the context of being human.  It also gives perspective to the concept of 'happiness' within our lives. Educators might consider using this in the classroom with students at the high school or college level to generate a discussion regarding human emotions and empathy.

4012656,3,B002Y7ZELW,"There are many touching moments, intelligent insights, and heartwarming case studies in this series. On the other hand, about half of Part Two was very much like an infomercial for psychiatric drugs and ECT. It was not a balanced presentationit was a sales pitch, and the host barely mentioned the many serious negative side-effects of pharmaceuticals and ECT.
Another problem is the clever way of portraying alternative therapies as quackery (the ding).
Also, the host ignores many medical systems that balance emotional life using natural methods such as healthier food choices, plant-based medicines, yoga, meditation, and personal growth.
The two oldest human medical systems--Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurvedic medicine--can mitigate emotional problems in ways that are far more efficacious and holistic than chemicals and inducing Grand Mal seizures.
If you want to see an alternative to pharmaceuticals and the standard Western approaches to happiness and healing, watch the documentary ""Art of Being.""",1403568000,,1017,5.697368421052632

Daniel Gilbert is the finest of narrators, and more than anything else, this show provided what every other show did not: actual scientific studies and results. Now, it wasn't bogged down by this, but enhanced. There wasn't so much of it that the usual lay person wouldn't understand, but it also lent a great deal of credence to the proceedings. I am not fond of people just telling me, ""This is the way it is"" in documentaries. Show me why, show me proof. This delivered.",1399420800,,572,4.617647058823529
4012705,1,B002Y7ZELW,I thought this would have been informative but It's nothing but propaganda for socialist views and the belief that living emotionally is a good thing....How about teaching people that using analytical analysis is the way to handle issues. I could only watch about 15 mins of this and understood completely the SOCIALIST agenda...I'm sure everyone got a trophy at the end too,1398816000,,374,5.048387096774194

4012708,4,B002Y7ZELW,an excellent exploration of the impact of emotions on behavior as well as an intelligent definition of the impact of disorders that limit or even eliminate emotion responses in individuals with disorders found on the Autism spectrum.  This response is based on having viewed only one of the three episodes.  It was sufficiently interesting that I will watch the remaining episodes.,1396915200,,381,5.229508196721311

4012712,5,B002Y7ZELW,Emotions are difficult to direct and even more difficult to describe. This documentary I feel does a very good job of exploring the motivations behind our emotions. All episodes have a standalone quality to them and all put together cover the range of emotions that bother and inspire us through our daily lives.

For example, there is a woman who says that she cured herself of cancer by thinking ""happy thoughts"".  It's noted that such a claim is not a scientific fact. . . but you don't hear anyone say ""that's crazy talk"".

I don't think this series is supposed to. . . or will.  . .fix all of your ""issues"".  (that is, if you have ""issues"")  But I think you'll see how ""normal"" you really are.  You might be inspired by a few people.  You might find one or two things which will help you in your own life.

4012784,1,B002Y7ZELW,"This was the first download that we ordered after being enticed by Amazon's email promoting ""instant"" video services.

They truly did put out their feeling unlike what I have seen before. Listening, it is a cheap medicine. One thing that these DVDs do is to suggest medical solution to all problems. They showed and analysed behaviours that was interesting and I was not familiar with. Just few hours of any DVD is not suppose to resolve any or all issues we human beings may have so individuals who criticize a DVD which does not cover all issues are just simply unreasonable. What is the absolute truth... is there one... Emotions are never right or wrong since from the prospective of the person feeling the emotion, it is the truth, it is the right thing, it is the right approach, it is the right medicine...

We are given a special look into several people's relationships, how they deal with pain, frustration, loneliness, bullying, grief.  I took a drama class in college.  The professor taught that emotions are our primary source of entertainment.  We are fascinated and interested in emotions -- those of others and those of our own -- because our well-being depends on how well we understand and navigate the emotional mine field!",1310256000,8,516,5.4125
4012791,1,B002Y7ZELW,"In This Emotional Life, a documentary purportedly about the human (or at least American) experience, there was a disturbing absence of a significantly relevant aspect of our human experience.

Where are the gay people?

I shall answer my rhetorical question by first pointing out that it is rhetorical at two levels.  Firstly, where are the subjects who explicitly identify as LGBorT?  Secondly, why were the subjects who did appear in the film, and were LGBT, have this aspect erased within the documentary?

Yes, in asserting this second point, I was reduced to scrounging for clues in order to make a ""gay reading"" of this film.  I cannot be 100 percent sure my readings are accurate, but I put the questions out there:
What was the orientation of the young woman with an anger problem who took on three guys in a bar over comments they made about the girlfriend she was with, and who used boxing as an outlet?  What was the orientation of the older man with the beautiful house (the only woman we see in the house is an Andy Warhol Marilyn Monroe on the wall - maybe a clue, people), a house being filled with beautiful furniture as delivered by a handsome, young, rebellious man whom he then mentored into a fulfilling life?

And it is fair to speak of ""erasure"" and not ""oversight"" because sexuality as a source of conflict or happiness was explicitly addressed in the film, because the primary relationships of heterosexual subjects often appeared as the context of their lives, and because issues of discrimination are crucial to well-being.  If you think I am imaging this erasure, let me ask, why was the swishy, artist lottery winner with nieces and nephews but no kids, NOT speaking to the effects of money on his primary romantic relationships, when his female friend was allowed to mention a ""husband""?

If the subjects who appeared in the film were not willing to be out, then the makers should have looked around for subjects who would be willing - and judging by the raging success of the ""It Gets Better"" project (in which older LGBTs are reaching out to younger LGBTs trapped in a schooling system that is failing to protect them) there are plenty of willing subjects out there.

It is stunning to watch people who appear secure in their professional lives as researchers into human psychology display such a lack of moral courage to allow full expression of the human experience.  Is it just too hard to fit into queerness into their pet theories?  Either way, it sends the message loud and clear that LGBT-queerness is still not acceptable.

But for this significant problem, I might have given this documentary 4 stars.  It is even more of a disappointment when this error of omission is made in a production that is otherwise handled with sensitivity and involves courageous subjects.",1305331200,5,2807,4.782608695652174

They'd be happy with the likes of Shutter Island or Girl Interrupted, but I show the educational ones. So they began their usual behavior of pulling out papers when I announced one day that we were viewing a film.  However, within the first five minutes of This Emotional Life, all of them had abandoned the tasks and shifted their bodies in their desks to be able to get the best view.  They remained in the same position for the 75 minutes left in the period.  In other words, they were mesmerized.

I love the way each seemingly hopeless situation is followed by a description of a treatment that does offer hope.  Watching this film is an emotional experience.",1285804800,30,767,4.644444444444445
4012796,5,B002Y7ZELW,"This is a well done documentary on the current thinking on emotional health.  It covers the process of a child's emotional development in connection with parents, as well as the many types of pathologies that can develop from poor childhood experiences (including with parents), possible genetic vulnerabilities, traumas in childhood or adulthood such as war and issues with relationships with spouses and others.

I would recommend it to anyone, whether diagnosed with an emotional problem or not, as a great summary on these issues.  If you have been diagnosed with an emotional problem, or if you have difficulty in relationships (who doesn't? :), you may find it especially helpful.

My only reservation about this DVD is that it represents current thinking on these issues (perhaps as it appears to a middle-aged male psychologist?) and does not quite get at some issues that were lurking in the background.  As other reviewers have noted, the contexts of depth psychology (long-term psychotherapy getting at locating long buried-in-subconscious wounds, bringing their emotional content to the surface and resolving them), family systems issues, and broader ""sickness"" in the political-social-economic environment did not receive focus.  These include:

1.  Overfocus on mothering.  There was some attention paid to fathers, such as the lawyer who had the son with attachment disorder.  His statement that ""My son's disease has meant I could not be the father I wanted to be.  Instead this has been about meeting my son's needs.  But maybe that is what a father is, really?""  This was a great moment for showing how important healthier fathering is and how many men (and women) have a view that their authority is what is important rather than the child's needs.  I was troubled that this was not called out by the narrator, however, while the single mother's need to learn how to make her child feel cared for and to support her child's autonomy was.  Also, the financial markets guy who become a stay-at-home dad; I was disappointed that much was made of the fact he did not find fulfillment in being a stay-at-home dad; it seemed to me what was going on was that he was facing the very same issues that many stay-at-home moms do.

2.  The sociological context in which many of these people were living.  For example, the wife who had to get treatment to learn to enjoy sex with her husband shows a very common problem many women face in a culture that has traditionally focused on male sexuality and been male-dominant.  Many families mirror this broader cultural context and the woman noted that she had to reverse the conditioning from her childhood, which was difficult.  She seemed to be blaming her husband for this or wanting him to know how hard this was.  I can understand this; since men are dominant in patriarchy it is easy to blame them for the problem; also because they are privileged it is often invisible to them how women suffer under it.  Also, in what we often see as our most important relationship of adulthood, our marriage, we would want the other person to understand us and our situation better. I wish this context would have been noted, though.

This was also true with the husband who cheated on his wife.  The wife's comments that she didn't ""need"" her husband led him to have an affair.  I suspect her comments derived more from her wanting more of a sense of adult economic and political autonomy, which we all need, and which girls/women are not often encouraged to develop, rather than not wanting to be with this man in particular as a partner.  Also, his reaction when the psychologist said ""not all men have affairs"" was interesting as it seemed to show that he had just had an affair in part because he thought men were supposed to have affairs, not because he personally wanted to, which also shows how the sociological context of male dominance places distorting and dysfunctional pressures on men as well.

This broader context was also missing from the interview with David Buss; although there was a segue into how some couples manage to stay together despite the man-as-status-object/woman-as-fertility-object paradigm promoted by Buss as true ""across cultures"" there was not enough attention paid to how these problems can be prevented by reconciling patriarchy with feminism into raising children to be more well-rounded. Buss is a so-called ""evolutionary psychologist"" who, I think really just studies how the traditional male control of resources has affected people's psychology and created conflict between the sexes.  Now that women are increasingly allowed direct access to resources, and male parenting skills are more at issue in women's mate selection (rather than just the man's ability to earn a living) and many men actually want to be good parents, I suspect we may see different psychology, with less conflict between the sexes, and healthier families, including better emotional health in children, emerge (if it hasn't emerged already).  Buss is controversial because he doesn't take into account the socialized nature of patriarchy; the cultures he studies omit ones where men play more of a role in child-rearing and where women have leadership roles.

People interested in this broader context may find a book like ""The Gender Knot"" by Alan Johnson helpful.

3.  The failure to note the family system of the depressed high school girl.  I was troubled watching the mother take her to the appointments and, at the same time, ignore what her daughter said about blaming the mother and wanting her to fix it.  As someone who has suffered from depression myself and done long-term therapy, I can say in my case that my depression was definitely rooted in oppressive circumstances in my home, which in turn derived at least in part from broader cultural oppression.  I don't know if that is the case with this girl, but I thought the mother's dismissal of the daughter's comments could reflect a common set-up where the mother is in denial of her own past wounds, reproduces these in the child and even dumps the mother's discomfort onto the child, blaming the child in effect for raising issues the mother doesn't want to face about her treatment of her daughter and also about the mother's own buried wounds.  This is very oppressive and a recipe for depression.  Since in this family, the mother appears to have been the primary and possibly the only parent who is focused on the daughters (I don't think the father said anything at all?), this explains why the daughter would blame the mother and not the father.  This single-parenting (which often happens even in married couples set up in the traditional male-provider, patriarchal style) is also a recipe for oppression as the mother often doesn't have autonomy and so subconsciously leans on the children.  Also, the mother may block the child from having a good relationship with the father as all she has is ""mothering.""  And the father may take no responsibility for learning parenting skills himself since he sees that as the mother's job.  A book like Alice Miller's ""The Drama of the Gifted Child"" explains some of these issues.",1285372800,22,7159,4.9623115577889445
