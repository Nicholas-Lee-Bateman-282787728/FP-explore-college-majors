7816806,5,6301922700,"The above title comes from a quote used twice in the movie. I must say that this movie struck a cord with me. Like Jake Scully in Brian DePalma's Body Double, I identified with Scott Bruin, young, sucessful and handsome player. He's also a fashion photographer, the profession every young man dreams of being involved in (Once Amatured For An AFI Company So I Know This For A Fact).

Scott Bruin has been having nightmares. Nightmares of killing a beautiful woman. The nightmares unsettle him and he talks first with his best friend (Played By Brian Thompson). That does not help so he goes to see a shrink (Played Wonderfully By The Great David Soul). Even this in depth help does him no good and finally at his wits end Scott sleeps on the street with a homeless hobo. By morning time, he coincidentally sees a bicycle rider wearing a T-shirt with the face of the woman who has been in his nightmares. He chases the man down and they exchange shirts. Following a lead to the T-shirt shop, Scott questions a recalcitrant store owner and leaves the shop with almost none of his queries answered. He leaves his card, however.

The next morning, back at his studio/apartment, Scott is awakened by a gorgeous female who thinks he's a PI hired by her ex-husband to keep tabs on her. Scott convinces her (Kimberly Shawn) otherwise and they end up having lunch where he meets her Mother (Played By The Great Tipi Hedren In A Fascinating Cameo). A late dinner follows and then the games begin! Oh my God! The sex in this movie puts Fatal Attraction's scene to shame. I have never ever in my life seen such sexual intensity between two co-stars in a non Adult Film! Kimberly and Scott (Lester & Sachs) have a screen chemistry that has seldom been seen or matched before in a Hollywood Suspense/Thriller. Having Fallen in love, Scott can't get enough of her body (No Man Could) and decides to stay over for a few days. On the second night during a torrid sex encounter he attempts to strangle Kimberly. This scares Scott more than it does Kimberly, but he decides to sleep outside in the tent where he more or less gets a restless night's slumber. The following day Scott is left alone in the house while Kimberly goes to work. Using the time to plunder, he goes through the house and discovers avault and then a cabinet where he learns that Kimberly Shawn has been playing him all along. He discovers his nightmare verbatim on a DVD/Laser Disc. Angered, he leaves the house and confronts Kimberly in front of her office. She in turn leads him to the head honcho who was responsible for Scott's torturous nightmares.

I won't discuss the film's climax but I will tell you that this movie was thoroughly enjoyable! I remember showing it to my friends and they also thought it was an interesting view (They Loved The Sex). My buddy Sean even said Scott should have all his teeth pulled (See The Movie To Understand The Meaning Of That Quote).

Now let me go into detail about a man ahead of his time. Scott Bruin, elite fashion photographer, had a laptop computer, cell phone and digital camera in the early 1990s when few people in the country had even heard of those devices! He lived the life of a swinging bachelor that so many of us guys would dream to have. His great looks and cut hard body came with a chiseled jaw and athletic stride (He Manages To Chase Down A Fleeing Bicyclist!). He looked like he could have been a pitcher or quarterback for a MLB or NFL team!

This movie is a fantastic view and I highly recommend it. The locations shown were beautiful and breathtaking. From lit up LA skylines to huge art-deco houses to downtown LA and Venice Beach, this movie showcaswed a wide variety of sites a tourist and film buff would enjoy. I'm lucky that I was able to buy this movie on DVD in 2005. Unfortunately it is now out of print in that media format. However, it is still available on VHS, so there is another major reasion for you guys not to throw out your VCRs!

If you guys like hot and intense sexual thrillers, you will like this film. Buy, rent or borrow it and you won't be disappointed. Touche to you Mr. Nico Mastorakis! I wish you had made more films in this genre! This is my 100th review for Amazon!

Anyways, I thought the acting was rather lame. To think that someone would  actually spend money to make this movie is beyond me. But this movie is  about sex, and let's face it, there was a good deal of it and the women  were well chosen. That one scene where the guy and the girl first get it on  lasts forever. I love how they utilized everything around them in the sex  scenes, like the scene with marbles at the beginning. That dude just knew  how to work it. It's a cool movie for dumb movies. And it is mad sexy as  hell, so check it out, even if only for once. You won't be disappointed.",944352000,14,743,3.97972972972973
