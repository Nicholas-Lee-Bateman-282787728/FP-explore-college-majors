8621938,4,B00G9AKXDE,"Final Fantasy X (often referred to simply as FFX) is the legendary PS2 game that brought the series into the next generation of 3D graphical presentation. However, the game did just as much for the world of audio in the RPG gaming world, as it did anything else. When the remaster for the game was announced and released in 2013, I was somewhat surprised to hear there would be a remaster for the audio. I expected maybe some increase in qualitya simple remaster for modern sound systems would dobut what I got was a rearrangement instead. Unfortunately, not all is well here. For one, not all the tracks have been remastered. According to the Final Fantasy Wikia Over 60 songs were newly arranged by Masashi Hamauzu, Junya Nakano, Tsutomu Narita, Hirosato Noda, and Ryo Yamazaki. Out of 104 tracks, this is a good ratio, but it still feels undone. My other major complaint stems from just the quality of the arrangements. I will delve into this and more, but first I will talk about the equipment and methodology for a review.

  For this review I swapped back and forth between an Audeze LCD-2 and Sennheiser HD650 headphones but primarily stuck to the LCD-2 and will speak from that standpoint. The Sennheiser was mostly to gain perspective on what I was hearing sonically. I use a Schiit Gungnir Multibit digital to analog converter connected to a Schiit Lyr 2 with Telefunken Ulm tubes from the 60s. The CD was ripped using Exact Audio Copy and played in Foobar2000 using WASAPI.

  From the get go, the soundtrack starts off with plenty of arrangements and there is a lot to say. The original Final Fantasy games were often restricted by the limits of the Playstation 1 and 2 audio chips and while FFX certainly makes great utilization of artificial instrumentation, there is so much potential given todays technological strides. I cannot say with full conidence that this soundtrack has gone out and done that. I do believe they wanted to capture some of the original tonality but there was a lot more to be had here. A great example of this is Supira no Houkei or Sight of Spira in the original official English translation. This is a simple song with a couple of guitars with one holding the original melody and the other providing a harmonic support and some percussive elements thrown in as well. This track would of benefited from live instrumentation or simply better guitar samples being used.

  A lesser, but still unfortunate example is the highly lauded Besaid Island. Some of the original harmonic elements are still prevalent here. The arrangement itself isn't bad and it adds more layers to the polyphony of the piece, which is quite welcome. However, the original perfectly captured the sense of wonder of the island itself with a relaxing harmonic background with an addictive, energetic pulse provided by the snare drum. The new version loses that same energy and provides a more ethereal sound. Another unfortunate miss.

  The soundtrack is not all misses however. As we move further into track list, Luca really comes across strong, though the supporting keyboards weren't a welcome addition. Here the bass presence is strong and really provides a welcome punch. The HD650s more bloated bass presence makes this a fun listen. There is an added modulation to the end that wasn't in the original that I found quite pleasant. Ryokou Kouka or Travel Agency is a song quite similar to the previous Sight of Spira in theme. Very relaxed, used during pit stops during the characters journey and a simple, homophonic piece. The new one is a more interesting arrangement and the instrumentation is overall more lively and atmospheric, without taking away from the originals charm.

  As noted earlier, there are some songs that are left in their original arrangement. Though I felt this somewhat lazy on Square Enixs part, it doesnt really affect the quality of the album overall. However, the vocalized Aeon prayer songs definitely could of used new arrangements. For one, these are critical to the game itself and an important plot element, but moreover, as a vocalist, it is always welcome to hear new musical interpretations from different singers. Since all of them are still the original arrangements, I assume this was a creative choice by the arrangers, and one I disagree with.

  Lastly I want to take a look at two of my favorite tracks on the album. The famousVia Purifico or Jouzai no Michi and Assault or Shuugeki. Via Purifico is actually not a new arrangement, but is taken from the original Final Fantasy X Piano Collections CD. I actually love this as a creative move. Aki Kuroda gave a stellar performance on the album and it certainly is still fitting of the original setting. Assault is the big winner and my favorite from the whole album. This is what this album could of been overall and the soaring energy I get makes me wonder if the arranger for this was the birlliant Masashi Hamauzu or even Shiro Hamaguchi. Regardless, they somehow made an already excellent track even better.

  At $50-60 depending on where you buy it from, the Final Fantasy X Remaster OST is a tough sell but worth it if you are a fan of the music in the games. Theree are plenty of misses and I cannot take away from that, but the hits are gems that I will be listening to again and again. There also are a few tracks from FFX-2, the sequel game that was also remastered, but I found them mostly forgettable. If you are a completionist or a big fan of the music of Final Fantasy, I say go for it and grab this album.",1521331200,,5534,4.731808731808732
8621939,5,B00G9AKXDE,"Maybe this review is biased as FFX is my favorite of the series; but, this HD remaster is COMPLETELY worth it.  I'm listening to it with my headphones on and I feel like they completely redid every track from scratch for this OST.  Some of my favorite tracks sound even more epic with this remaster!  As a bonus you get some FFX-2 tracks as well which is cool and unexpected.  I was lucky enough to find this on Amazon at a price $20 cheaper than the official SquareEnix store.",1488499200,,477,4.325842696629214
