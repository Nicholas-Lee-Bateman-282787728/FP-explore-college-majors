6506760,5,B00LU4URR6,I watched the Adventures of Rin Tin Tin tv series from the 1950's. Then I fell in love with the new version Rin Tin Tin K9 Cop. This is such a wonderful exciting show. I'm so happy that this series has been found again. Please continue releasing the series on DVD.,1440028800,2,264,4.196078431372549

6506763,4,B00LU4URR6,"This release contains 10 episodes from season 1, episodes 1-6 and 8-11. Missing is episode 7 ... No clue as to why. I was especially disappointed with this because it doesn't suggest a plan to release further episodes. The episodes are all on one disc with no special features, no episode guide insert, or close captioning, but at least the chapter breaks are set so you can skip past the theme song when you've heard it enough times. Please release the rest of the show already, eh?",1420848000,9,483,4.563218390804598
6506764,5,B00LU4URR6,Love this series.  Hope they put the rest on dvd,1419897600,,48,3.8
6506765,5,B00LU4URR6,"Finally, finally, finally.  This is just the tip of the iceberg though.  I really want all five seasons, boxed set.  Ten disconnected episodes don't convey the story arc that built through the whole series.  Outstanding program - give it the respect it deserves.  I love this show.",1416355200,4,281,4.8936170212765955
6506766,4,B00LU4URR6,"It's a great series that I had the pleasure to grow up with and it's wonderful to finally see it coming out on DVD.  Unfortunately, this is not the complete first season and is actually a collection of ten episodes from the first season, sans some of the important plot building episodes that come to effect the storyline in later seasons.  I'm wondering if this is intentional or if they simply lost the hard copies of the missing episodes.

Either way, it's awesome to have this DVD and I eagerly look forward to future releases- it's really nice to be able to walk down memory lane again with this show.",1414886400,5,606,4.490909090909091
6506767,4,B00LU4URR6,I grew up watching this. And i am glad they put to dvd. But i have done some research and come to find that there were more episodes to season 1 ? I would like to see all the seasons put to dvd.,1412467200,3,194,3.5348837209302326
6506768,5,B00LU4URR6,"Thank you so very much I been looking for this show everywhere, Thank you guys for finally putting the show on DVD I grew up whilst watching this show when I was just a little girl, now I can finally relive these magical moments all over again. :)",1411776000,4,247,4.166666666666667

8668174,5,B00LU4URR6,"Really a good movie for family viewing. Not the most professionally done, however, still funny and fun to watch. Clean language. Some things might need explaining to a very young child of what police officers go through on the job at times, but nothing that is too drastic. Kept in a light hearted sense. Whereas older children know police work isn't always that funny.",1526860800,,369,4.78125

8668178,5,B00LU4URR6,I just recently found that these episodes had been releases & was disappointed that it was such a small selection. It was such a sweet & family friendly tv show. It was especially disappointing to see online that most of the other episodes had been released on dvd in a French language version. This does me little good since I speak little French.  I emailed the publisher of the English version & they stated there were no plans at this time to release any more English DVDs... But being that I just NOW found this DVD and it was released 4 yrs ago - 2014 - to me it shows that there was very little advertising of wide market release. This would account for low sales and lake of interest for other DVDS to be made. Is there others that desire to have the entire series on DVD? I'd love to find a way to encourage more shows to be put on DVD! Any thoughts?,1488758400,,859,4.206060606060606

8668182,1,B00LU4URR6,Mill Creek Entertainment is a HORRIBLE company that does not care about the deaf fans. No closed-captioning = no sale!!,1452902400,,119,5.0
