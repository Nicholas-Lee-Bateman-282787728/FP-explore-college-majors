No heavy moral answers and even less questions.",1178409600,,223,4.309523809523809
8566751,3,B00BDT6MJ0,"When I first bought this I figured it was porn....70's porn to be specific, because of Nick Phillips. But I thought perhaps it would be like some of John Holmes or Ron Jeremy's work and have some point to it. I was in turn, disappointed. There is no plot to this movie. The one thing that usually sets 70's porn aside and makes it interesting, is missing completely. The only reason i'm giving it three stars is for all the Nudity/Sex....Which there is plenty of. If your looking for classic 70's erotica, look someplace else. Don't waste your money on this. They don't even have the right picture displayed for the cover art. I'd recommend....Debbie Does Dallas if your looking for a classic that has a plot outline.",1176076800,,717,4.609375
8566752,2,B00BDT6MJ0,"This is not a movie that happens to include some explicit sex scenes (such as Erotic Night of the Living Dead).  It is simply a sex film.  There is no plot.  It was shot on silent 35mm film and a single voice narrates over the visuals.  The narration does not always match the scene.

Ultimately we see three women.  One is a European porn star visiting LA, one is supposedly at a Hollywood party and the third is just in an apartment.  The first gets involved with her female agent.  The second surprises a man in a private moment and joins in.  The third calls a swinging couple to come over.  The three scenes flash back an forth with explicit visuals and the single narrator.  Often the narrator will be relating one scene while a different scene is being shown.

In the end this is just a hardcore movie backed up by a few extras including an interview with the producer and a photo gallery (4 photos).  This is not I Am Curious Yellow or Realm of the Senses, there is no story, plot or even real characters, just lots of sex and occasional flashes of lawn statues.",1118102400,18,1070,4.343434343434343
