2636325,5,B000HEWEFI,"Wonderful boxed set for the true Thundercat enthusiasts.  Hubby went crazy when we found the whole collection here on Amazon listed for 24 a piece.  We jumped on it and were so happy we did... because now they have doubled in price.

The boxes are really nice and some of the sets even have holograms on them.  They have been copied over very nicely.  GREAT buy and would recommend it not only to 80's children but also to the younger generation.",1214265600,,446,4.45679012345679
2636326,5,B000HEWEFI,"I was extremely ecstatic when I found this last volume of Thundercats on sale.  I had been waiting for the price to go down, and Amazon did not disappoint me.  It's always great to save a little green, and Amazon came through for me as usual.",1211414400,,242,4.239130434782608
2636327,5,B000HEWEFI,"Great volume its a must buy for any thundercats fan or any child born in the 80's,I suggest you buy the other volumes 1 and 2 of season 1 and season 2 volume 1 first,enjoy!!!!!!",1209945600,,177,4.085714285714285
2636328,5,B000HEWEFI,"I never was that crazy about cartoons, but for some reason I really liked the Thundercats series.  Oh sure, I would watch cartoons every Saturday morning like any other kid, but none of them really made a lasting impression on me (good thing I guess).  Thundercats was different though.  I was actually a pre-teen when they aired and was arguably too old for them, but the story lines, characters, values, etc. really caught my attention.  With the non-sense on T.V. today (i.e. Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, etc.), I am only too happy to introduce my 4 kids to some real cartoon entertainment.  I would recommend these DVDs to anyone who feels nostalgic about '80s cartoons, or anyone who has kids and wants to give them a break from the mind numbing Sponge Bobs of today's T.V. - Enjoy",1198800000,6,790,4.695652173913044
2636329,4,B000HEWEFI,"Very good, i'm telling u. U won't regret it, but i only wish they would have done alittle more like the other folks did with the he-man collection. Dics number six has nothing but the final 3 episodes of season 2 volume 2. I wish they would have done a documentary with the history of the thunder cats and how the thunder cats started, and stuff like that... like the he-man collection did. But still is a great buy.",1179705600,4,416,4.2784810126582276
2636330,5,B000HEWEFI,This is a must have collection since it was one of the best cartoons in the 80's,1168300800,2,80,3.764705882352941
2636331,5,B000HEWEFI,"If you're looking for episodes with believable problems, excellent bad guys, and storylines that make you sit on the edge of your seat... don't buy this.  On the other hand, if you want something that'll teach your child moral lessons and is still silly enough for you to giggle hysterically behind your hands at the absurdidty of some of these ideas, then nab it!

This last collection of the Thundercat TV series gets a 5 from me, not because the actual storylines are any good, but because the morals are sound, the animation is much better than in the first season, and they're just so darned silly!  Oh, yeah, I'm also biased in the Thundercats' favor. :D",1167868800,6,660,4.6239316239316235
2636332,5,B000HEWEFI,"These six long-awaited DVDs come conveniently packed in three standard-size two-disc cases, housed in a groovy slipcover decorated with art that changes from an image of Lion-O to an image of the evil Mumm-Ra as you move it around.  This packaging is aesthetically pleasing while still providing easy access to, and safe storage for, the discs inside.  Since that infamous background music flub on Season One Volume One, Warner has done a commendable job bringing our Thunderian heroes to DVD (albeit with a dearth of extras), and this set completes the legendary ThunderCat saga.  This final period in the Cats' history falls a bit short of the brilliant standard set by the first season, in my opinion.  The plots just seem a little too repetitive and far-fetched at this point.  After an unfortunate run-in with a flying circus train driven by W.C. Fields and a crow who talks like Groucho Marx, the villainous Mutants and Lunatacs are conspicuously absent from many of the shows on this set.  Most episodes begin with lonely Mumm-Ra (slightly less menacing these days as he caresses mummies-best-friend, Ma-Mutt) cooking up yet another diabolical scheme to destroy the ThunderCats, only to be foiled yet again by the limitless power of the Sword of Omens.  The sword can now do ANYTHING from growing in size, to traveling millions of miles through space to come to Lion-O's hand -- it can even bring rain to end a New Thunderian drought!  Time and again, our heroes must search for pieces of the Treasure of Thundera; dive into and out of The Book of Omens; re-forge the Sword; re-build the new Cats' Lair; and fix that troublesome Gyroscope -- all while enduring the incessant squeaking of Elmo sound-alike, Snarfer.  It's enough to make a ThunderCat take Jaga's name in vain!  At least they can now travel back and forth between Thundera and Third Earth with ease...but why was it necessary for them to be cryogenically frozen in the first episode?  And hey, doesn't that Screwloose character look an awful lot like C-3PO?  Vexing questions aside, the old ThunderCat magic is still evident during several of these beautifully-animated adventures, E.G.: ""The Jade Dragon"" (starring Hachiman);"" ""Leah;"" ""Malcar;"" ""The Mossland Monster;"" and ""The Touch of Amortus.""  Dog owners and mummified zombies alike are sure to get a kick out of ""Ma-Mutt's Confusion,"" in which the playful putrid pooch has some fun with his master's bandages.  The complete ThunderCat series on DVD: It's a good thing.  Justice, Truth, Honor, and Loyalty.  HOOOOOOO!",1165881600,10,2543,5.033412887828162
2636333,5,B000HEWEFI,"This set is 6 single sided disks, most likely double layer... roughly 5-6 episodes per disk.  English and French audio, Spanish subtitles.  This is the last volume that completes the entire collection (Season 1, Volume 1) (Season 1, Volume 2) (Season 2, Volume 1) and (Season 2 Volume 2).  Evidently Est-Bay Uy-Bay (pig latin) is selling previous volumes on the cheap as of today, so if you are on the fence - get 'em while they are inexpensive.  The box says episodes 35-65 of 65, but this refers to the episodes from season 2.  In the great scheme of the entire series, this set gives episodes 100-130 of 130, and the titles are as follows.

2636334,1,B000HEWEFI,I have purchased this box set from two different venders on amazon. Both were factory sealed mint but I had to return both due to discs in each of the two  boxed sets not playing or stopping and starting and scattered pixels.  This is a manufacturer issue. When season two Vol two was printed The Manufacturer screwed up causing several discs to have major issues.  I'm sadden to because I have season two vol  one and no issues with that boxed set at all.,1473206400,,456,4.392857142857143
2636335,5,B000HEWEFI,Nice collection if you like the 80's,1471737600,,36,4.285714285714286
2636336,2,B000HEWEFI,"Seen  both  seasons,  but  I  like  season  1  better.  Thunder  cats  have  got  just  regular  looking  bad  guys.  In  season  2  they  look  a  little  more  freakish.  I  bought  both  volumes  1  &  2  about  a  year  ago,  or  maybe  it  was  a  year  &  a  half  ago.  I  still  watch  season  2  even  though  its  not  as  interesting  as  the  first  season.  In  my  opinion  season  2  wears  thin  &  is  not  as  popular  as  the  first  season.  If  the  second  was  more  like  the  first  then  chances  are  I'd  like  it  a  little  bit  better.  In  season  2  volume  2  you  got  some  idiot  character  &  circus  train  who  comes  &  takes  the  mutants  away,  Slithe, Jackleman, Monkian,  &  Vulcherman,  &  comes  back  for  them  when  they  escape,  real  lame  script.  Stupid, Stupid  Stupid!!!  Season  2  volume  2  Stinks.  Not  hardly  worth  watching.  Neither  volumes.
Its  a  great  show.  &  I  watched  it  quite  regularly  as  a  kid.  Now  being  an  adult  I  got  a  little  more  time  to  think  &  decide  for  myself.  I'll  say  one  good  thing  I  think  the  Thunder  cats  from  the  1980's  is  so  much  better  then  the  new  Thunder  cats  TV  show.
My  honest  opinion,  It  wasn't  even  necessary  to  go  ahead  &  redo  the  show.
They  wasted  their  time  whoever's  to  blame  whether  it  was  Warner bros  or  someone  else.
My  advice  forget  the  new  Thunder cats  show  which  is  only  a  few  years  old  even  exists!
It  is  today's  modern  junk  anyways.",1468281600,,1538,4.150793650793651

2636381,5,B000HEWEFI,"And so we come to the end of one of the greatest 80s cartoons ever. I have to admit that next to Transformers, this had the most epic stories and scale.  Not many 80s cartoons lasted 100 episodes or more, at least during the decade (like Ninja Turtles).  Here's a review of the episodes with synopsizes from Wikipedia.

Disc 7

100.  Exile Isle:  The Thundercats capture the Lunatacs, put them on trial, and exile them to a desolate planet.  However, there is another old enemy of the Thundercats trapped on Exile Isle, with whom the Lunatacs soon team up to plan a destructive return to Third Earth.  B

101.  The Key To Thundera:  During an attempt to decode the Book of Omens, Lion-O accidentally traps himself within its pages, prompting Mumm-Ra to try to steal the book from Cats' Lair.  Meanwhile, Panthro discovers a mysterious key on New Thundera.  A+

102.  Return Of The Thundercubs:  Tygra, Cheetara and Panthro fall under Mumm-Ra's power on New Thundera, and he tries to use Cheetara's Sixth Sense to locate the Treasure of Thundera.  To rescue his friends, Lion-O must convince the mutants to fly him from Third Earth in the Ratstar.  B

103.  The Formula:  Alluro's new superfuel formula for Sky Tomb unexpectedly seems to boost the growth of local plant and animal life to massive proportions.  Luna orders the mutants to spray it around Cats' Lair, leaving the Thundercats trapped in a gigantic savage garden.  C

104.  Locket of Lies:  Mumm-Ra creates an evil trinket which the Thundercats mistake for a piece of the Treasure of Thundera.  It soon leads them into deep trouble on New Thundera, and nobody is around to rescue them.  A+

105.  Bracelet of Power:  The Feliner returns from New Thundera with a mysterious bracelet.  When Snarf puts it on, he discovers it has the power to turn Thundercats into his obedient servants.  While he toys with this new power, Mumm-Ra plots to steal the bracelet for his own evil purposes.  A+

Disc 8

106.  The Wild Workout:  The Lunatacs hook up exercise machines to generate power for Sky Tomb's engines, but their own laziness forces them to find Thundercats to do the hard work. Meanwhile, Mumm-Ra plans to lure the Thundercats into a freezing trap in the Caverns of Cold on New Thundera.  C

107.  The Thunderscope:  Lion-O and Snarf recover a mysterious telescope from the wreckage of their original spaceship. Mumm-Ra recognizes it as the Thunderscope, which allows its user to locate pieces of the Treasure of Thundera.  Lion-O must discover its purpose and keep it out of Mumm-Ra's evil hands.  A+

108.  The Jade Dragon:  Mumm-Ra discovers the power of one of the pieces of the treasure of Thundera.  The Double-Headed Dragon of Doom, or the Jade Dragon possess the power to entrap people in its stomach.  The Thundercats find the Jade Dragon, but Mumm-Ra manages to trap Lion-O and Cheetara in it.  Hachiman is their only hope.  A+

109.  The Circus Train:  A bounty hunter known as Captain Bragg comes to Third Earth to help the Thundercats get rid of the Mutants and the Lunatacks.  Capt Bragg tricks Wilykat in going with him and they first go after the Mutants.  After capturing them, they go to capture the Lunataks. They capture all except Luna and Amuk, who free the other Lunataks, put Bragg in a cage and tie Wilykat to the train's engine.  I don't hate this episode like most people do.  Granted, there are a couple terrible parts, but I thought most of it was funny.  B

110.  The Last Day:  Impatient with Mumm-Ra failing them time and time again, the Ancient Spirits of Evil give him one final chance: destroy the Thundercats within twenty-four hours, or face exile.  To this end, he is granted extraordinary power by the Spirits, and grows to a gigantic size.  An excellent episode that would have served as a grand finale if the show had ended here. A+

Disc 9

111-115.  Return To Thundera:  The Ancient Spirits of Evil give new life to Mumm-Ra and Ma-Mutt, send them to New Thundera, and build a new Pyramid for Mumm-Ra.  The Thundercats say goodbye to Third Earth and depart for Thundera, leaving Tygra and Pumyra behind to watch the Tower of Omens and Cat's Lair.  The Thundercats soon arrive and begin plans to build a new lair. Mumm-Ra meanwhile learns that the planet's gravity is controlled by the Gyroscope under the Churning Rocks at the center of the planet and will use this knowledge to destroy the Thundercats and trick the Gyroscope's guardian, the ancient sorceress Jaguara.  An excellent 5 part story that shows that these cats still have some of their nine lives left.  A+

Disc 10

116.  Leah:  The Ancient Spirits of Evil bring the Mirror Wraith to Mumm-Ra, and he disguises it as a child's toy.  Mumm-Ra then intercepts a Thunderian escape pod which carries in it a little girl. He gives the toy to the child (Leah), and leaves.  She is rescued by the Thundercats, and goes into New Cat's Lair with the doll.  B+

117.  Frogman:  Wily Kit and Kat are constructing a well for the New Cat's Lair on New Thundera.  The Thundercats on New Thundera receive a distress signal from Thunderian refugees trying to find their way to New Thundera.  The Kittens are left alone with Snarf on at the New Cat's Lair, and Lion-O and Snarfer are out constructing an early warning device.  The rest of the Thundercats seek out the refugees in space.  When Wily Kit and Kat strike water, they accidentally unleash a monster that Jaga trapped in the underground lake centuries ago.  C

118.  The Heritage:  Wily Kit and Kat, exploring New Thundera, stumble upon an Orb of Gold, and pick it up thinking that it is a part of their Heritage.  Possessed by the power of the Golden Sphere of City, the ThunderKittens get greedy, and let the power of the orb overcome them.  Mumm-Ra manages to get a hold of the orb, and his powers get four times more powerful.  B+

119.  Screwloose:  Jaguara cannot work New Thundera's Gyro on her own. The Thundercats order a robot to aid her in running the Gyro. Screw Loose, a robot who specializes in Gyro's, comes to New Thundera. Mumm-Ra manages to mess up Screw Loose's brain so he becomes destructive instead of helpful. The Thundercats must help Jagara get Screw Loose under control, before the entire planet is destroyed.  C

120.  Malcar:  Mumm-Ra summons Malcar, an ancient alchemist, to return from the dead.  The alchemist returns old and weak, and Mumm-Ra must restore his youth and power.  Malcar regains his powers to use them against the Thundercats.  B+

121.  Helpless Laughter:  A convergence of the Moons of Plun-Darr causes a drought on Thundera.  Panthro and Snarf go looking for water, then Ezuka, the flying Serpent of Dreary Canal wanting to get water itself, attacks Panthro and Snarf and causes them to fall into the Swamp of the Laughing Lilypads, making them laugh out of control.  A+

Disc 11

122.  Cracker's Revenge:  Capt. Cracker and his mechanical parrot Polly land on Way-Out Back and free the Lunatacs and put Bragg and Crownan in one of the train's cages.  They plan to go to Third Earth to attack it since most of the Thundercats are no longer on Third Earth.  B

123.  The Mossland Monster:  Tygra, on a solo trip to New Thundera to meet the other Thundercats, decides to take a shortcut through a meteor shower.  His ship is damaged, and he lands on an unexplored region of New Thundera, The Moss-Land.  It turns out that the moss in moss-land is part of a giant monster who captures Tygra with its moss.  A+

124.  Ma-Mutt's Confusion:  Mumm-Ra has a new device that he plans to use on Cats Lair, the Babylonian Barbarian Boiler.  Ma-Mutt fools around too much and Mumm-Ra banishes him from the Pyramid.  Later, the Thunderkittens, Snarf, and Snarfer bring Ma-Mutt back to Cats Lair and then Mumm-Ra fires the Boiler's beam at the Lair, which causes it to start melting.  B

125.  Shadowmaster:  From the Shadow Realm, the Shadowmaster contacts the Ancient Spirits of Evil, telling them of how he captured Lion-O's father, Claudus, just before Thundera blew up. Then the Shadowmaster, through a bad dream, shows Lion-O his captured father and challenges Lion-O to a fight.  The Shadowmaster is by far the coolest one-shot villain of the second season. A+

126.  Swan Song:  An Ecology Inspector (EI) comes to Thundera to inspect the new Cats Lair.  His ship uses the SWAN system (Space Way Airborn Navigations) to direct him to planets all over the universe.  When he arrives on Thundera, he gets ambushed by Two-Time (from Return to Thundera Part 3).  B

127.  Touch of Amortus:  Mumm-Ra orders Amortus, a being he banished to the Land of No Return centuries ago, to destroy Lynx-O.  Amortus makes Lynx-O crash in the Thunderstrike, and then he touches Lynx-O's face.  The spell from the touch makes Lynx-O feel like he is an outcast, so he leaves to join Amortus in the Land of No Return.  A

Disc 12

128.  The Zaxx Factor:  Vultureman escapes from exile by hijacking a bookmobile.  He finds a disk containing ancient history about two powerful evil forces on Third Earth: Mumm-Ra and his enemy Zaxx.  Using this information, Vultureman plots to defeat Mumm-Ra and rule the universe.  A+

129.  Well of Doubt:  The Thundercats use a new Tower signal to guide a Thunderian ship in; aboard are Baron Tass and Mr. Grubber, a devious pair of Thunderians.  Later Lion-O sends Torr, Baron Tass and Mr. Grubber to get water, but on the way the Baron stops at the Well of Doubt and gets some of its water.  The water causes a person to become very doubtful of his own abilities.  When they get back to the Thundercats, Baron Tass gives some of the water to Lion-O.  A-

130.  The Book of Omens:  Finally Panthro deciphers how to use the Key of Omens.  He enters the code to open the lock, and suddenly, the Guardian of Omens is summoned.  It tells the Thundercats they have 24 hours to present both the key and four other items to the four places in disgrace (geological disasters) all over New Thundera.  This is an excellent episode to end the series on.  A+

So that's the end.  I have to admit that even though the second season wasn't as good as the first, it was truly enjoyable for the most part.  Definitely recommended to animation fans.",1390521600,,10199,4.675339366515837

2636403,5,B000HEWEFI,"For anyone who was a kid in the 80's, this is a must have. Although they have a new Thundercats out now, it is nothing compared to the original, and I am glad that I was able to buy this. As always, I received a great product, with great customer service, and able to find something at a great price through Amazon.com. For any old school fan out there of 80's cartoons, this is worth the buy, and the animation is still great compared to today's cartoons. Thundercats Hooo!!!!",1368403200,,477,4.370786516853933

2636406,2,B000HEWEFI,"I just think that people who put in the box did not care about the fact that one disc inside was off the placement thing and it was dancing around inside putting in jeopardy the quality and integrity of the same. I feel like they just noticed it, did not care and send it...really sad about it. I did not feel appreciated as a customer",1354233600,,335,4.1692307692307695
2636407,5,B000HEWEFI,"Okay, so the box art pales in comparison to He-Man, but this series is so much better. And we all hate how they price gouged us by breaking it up into volumes instead of complete seasons, but again, this show is worth it. This is the best cartoon of the 80's in my opinion and I was blown away by how well it still holds up today. Such a fantastic cartoon!",1348444800,,356,4.028169014084507

Something to share and watch with the newer generations. I love the classic cartoons they showed/teach kids manners and responsibilities compared to cartoons nowadays such as family guy or such which teaches/shows kids bad manners and or bad morals. If you like the 80's cartoons, you won't be disappointed purchasing these 80's cartoon!

Just be aware that there is a major manufacturer's defect on one of the discs in this set that affects two episodes, rendering them both unplayable and impossible to rip. Considering you still get 30 or so episodes that do work, you may not care.  I have verified this plenty, as I've purchased the set 4 separate times from different places, and they all have the same defect. Thundercats HO!",1501718400,,534,4.448979591836735
