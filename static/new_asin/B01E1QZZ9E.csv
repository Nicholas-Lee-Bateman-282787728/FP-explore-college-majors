7729996,5,B01E1QZZ9E,"Loved it as a kid, love it as an adult, kids love it now too. Good music, decent acting, hot women, cool bike stunts/scenes, bad ass course at the end. This DVD is far better and superior to EVERY other copy I've owned. The picture quality is fantastic on my 4k HDTV. Previous copies were 80's grainy. I was actually extremely  surprised how good the picture was and it made the movie even more fun to watch.",1532908800,,408,4.298701298701299

7730008,5,B01E1QZZ9E,"Growing up this was one of my favorite guilty pleasures.  Among the gimmicky 80's extreme sport movies, this one stood out as a solid, albeit enjoyably campy, movie in its own right.  I was disappointed that I could never find it on DVD, and even more so when I learned it had fallen into public domain resulting in almost every copy I encountered online being a poor digitization of a clearly deteriorating VHS.  After reading the reviews for this particular seller, I took a chance.  And the holy grail for this film has been found: as clear in quality as you can get for the pre-HD era, this feels it was lifted from one of the master copies as opposed to a VHS rip.  If you know this movie, and have been searching for a clean copy of it, this is definitely it.",1529625600,,765,4.321678321678322

7730015,5,B01E1QZZ9E,"If you were born between 1975-80 odds on you have atleast seen this movie once. But if you ever owned a GT, HARO, REDLINE, MONGOOSE, CW, HUTCH, SKYLINE, KUWAHARA, or a cheaper knock off RANDOR from Sky City or WalMart raced BMX , or rode flatland or vert  and did tricks odds you have seen this movie 100 times easy. Sometimes movies you loved as a kid doesn't hold up over time because of plot and story but luckily the story plot is very simple local BMX racer vs the Pro Cooperate BMX team. The movie was never written to win a Oscar for story or actors but it does have Lori Loughlin in a eary movie role doing BMX tricks and danicing on a bike to song Send Me A Angel. The opening credits has pros riding vert and ramps and end credits have flatland pro legends Martin Aparijo and Eddie Fiola doing old school tricks. Helltrack race is awesome but to me the qualifying race will get you going while cheering and rooting for Cru Jones the underdog in a hockey goalie helmet and homemade pads he has to wear while the cooperate team all have real BMX offical uniforms and pro Bell Helmets. It is a great watch for anyone just wanting a simple feel good movie with a little nostalgic or anyone who spent hours learning how to bunny hop their bike in the driveway so you can impress your friends and jump and clear the curb in front of your house give it a try you will not be sorry.",1523750400,3,1384,4.222641509433962

7730029,5,B01E1QZZ9E,"Got this for my husband as a Christmas gift.  It was one of his favorite movies from his childhood.  Knowing that this was not an official DVD (since this particular film sadly doesn't have one) I was worried about the picture quality.  And I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  The quality of the picture & sound looked great!  Not sure what source this was taken from (maybe laser disc?) but if I didn't know any different I would have thought this was a regular studio released DVD.  Will definitely purchase this seller again if I have any hard to find films I want on DVD.

As for the movie itself, I was also very pleasantly surprised.  I was expecting lots of 80s cheese, but, although dated, this was a nice little movie.  It definitely made for a great movie night with my husband.",1518220800,9,795,4.427586206896552

I was originally concerned I was just paying for the same poor quality copy.  Happily this is a much better digital copy of the movie.  My wife and I were both surprised how good the quality was.  It even had a DVD menu which really surprised me since I thought this was just a VHS copy.,1482883200,,436,4.034883720930233

7730102,5,B01E1QZZ9E,I have been waiting for this release for YEARS!  Much thanks to the powers of influence for making this possible.  Now I don't have to pull out the old VCR to watch on VHS.  Suggestion for future release:  Widescreen!?!  I understand the source format may not support it but it would sure be great to see in...W.I.D.E.S.C.R.E.E.N!  Keep on doing what you do...I will be watching ;),1475107200,2,381,4.611940298507463

7730104,2,B01E1QZZ9E,"FYI, this is a DVDR copy.  Movie looks fine as does the packaging, however, if you look at the lower right of the screen you can see some sort of watermark perhaps from a tv station or something. I know the movie ownership has a weird history so being that this copy is watchable I can't complain much.",1474761600,3,302,4.206896551724138

7730107,5,B01E1QZZ9E,"This is the best quality ""80s"" movie you will ever find. I'm a HUGE Rad fan. It was my favorite movie growing up and still is. I've seen this movie hundreds of times on vhs and on a dvd copy I bought years back. The dvd quality wasn't much better than the vhs but at least it had a menu with chapters and I could watch it on a dvd player. I have always tried to keep my eye out for a better quality dvd and was sceptical when I found this because it said it was HD quality and I found that hard to believe because this movie has never even been released on dvd. I figured I would give it a shot because it was only $20. Let me tell you, best $20 I have ever spent. The quality is absolutely unbelievable. It looks better than some Blu Rays that I have. No joke. I don't know how they got it to look so good but it is well worth your money. I was telling my brother how good the movie looked and he thought I was full of it until he watched it. Ten minutes into the movie he was on Amazon ordering himself a copy.  If you are a fan of the movie you need to buy this now. You will not be disappointed.
I tip my hat to ""FRANKIE'S CUSTOM CLASSICS"" I don't know how you got the movie to look so good, but job well done. I have been waiting for something like this for a long time. Thanks",1472169600,26,1282,3.8377358490566036

Not only is it packaged nicely, play with no hesitation and include DVD menu and all, it is superb quality. Definitely an enhancement from my old VHSs. GREAT PRODUCT, SELLER!
