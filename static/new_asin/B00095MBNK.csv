2267418,5,B00095MBNK,"Annette Fletcher defines her new program,  "" Stretch and Joint Mobility Therapy,""  as active pursuit of joint health thru movement, (important especially as we age), stimulating synovial fluid to keep joints lubricated and less stiff.  Annette Fletcher's previous programs are great as a prelim to dance with excellent results in warm up, strength and flexibility. ""The Perfect in Ten Stretch"", is perfect for mini work outs when time does not allow for more.
Stretch and Joint Mobility Therapy is perhaps the most priceless dvd I have yet to receive. The investment in my personal health has no measure especially throughout life's' stages. As a dancer I must be ready to execute movement properly. Recently I suffered an injury at home, yet upon completion of my physical therapy, this program has been an aide in helping my body heal and regain range of motion as I strive to return to normal dance life.
Since this program is open level, it is ideal so you may pace yourself by choosing from any of the three sections designed specifically for your needs. Begin slowly and work up to your comfort level, use your judgement . Here is an assortment of yoga, pilates  and simple stretches to help lengthen muscles and keep your joints happy.
 The first section is great for anyone beginning with intense focus to the joints. These stretches are so relaxing and soothing to tired achy muscles of the shoulders and back. Isolated ribcage and hip rotations, knees and ankles, these all get a workout in circular movements to allow the synovial fluid to lubricate and soothe the joints. The hip swing is an awesome stretch in this section.
Dynamics stretches follow and the speed and range increase. If you are active in sports or dance, you will be at ease in this section. These begin slowly and develop larger range gradually. The side lunges were my favorite in this segment. Balance, strength and flexibility are also a focus. Spinal twists progress into abdominal strengthening exercises.
Static stretches are next and rich and beneficial for the hamstrings, hip flexors. Also seated stretches for the lower back are so helpful if you lead a sedentary lifestyle and sit in front of a computer most of the day. Each section is approximately 15- 20 minutes in length.
In the vast ocean of self help videos out there, this is definitely one that you can trust. It is prepared by a professional dancer and Pilates instructor. Her teaching method is clear and to the point without being overly lengthy. Best yet, your joints will thank you in the years to come.",1256688000,72,2559,4.8466819221967965
2267419,5,B00095MBNK,"I am so happy Annette Fletcher came out with a new stretch DVD. I like her style because she is easy to listen to, calm, and explains all moves in good detail. This new DVD has three sections. A joint mobility routine that lasts about 20 minutes. This routine will get your joints moving and it feels great. Next is a full body stretch routine that is 20 minutes long with bigger stretch moves. This stretch routine will get your heart pumping a little and really warmed up for the day or for the next workout you move into. The last section is a quick 15 minute light stretch routine. I like all three routines together for a full workout or you can view them separate as a quick stretch to start your day. I often combine Annette's 20 minute bigger stretch routine with a weight lifting DVD - what a great combination! What I like about this DVD is the combination of static stretches and full body movement. The music isn't annoying, Annette is very pleasant, great flow, and the speed is medium pace. Nothing is too difficult, but it's not boring either. In my opinion, this is a really great stretch DVD. I am so happy to have it in my collection and I look forward to these routines each morning! One thing to note: I also have the AM/PM Stretch for Health DVD that I also like very much, but it's a little easier and less of a workout than this DVD. If you are looking to go beyond easy stretches, and desire more of a workout, then go with this Stretch and Joint Mobility Therapy DVD.",1256515200,148,1492,4.332142857142857

2267469,2,B00095MBNK,"I am active with different types of exercise; swimming, power walking, weight lifting--I was expecting to learn and be able to follow at least 1/2 of the dynamic stretching in this CD.  I was wrong.  Annette is wonderful in terms of her own flexibility but her training seems designed more to show off her own flexibility than to guide someone who is not nearly as flexible or strong as she is.  My main complaint is that she moves much too quickly!  She says once in a while that the participant does not have to rush through the movements but meanwhile she, herself, is rushing through them and if one takes even 10 seconds longer on a specific movement by then she's in the middle or even finished with the next movement!

I have no issue with Annette's physical qualifications as a trainer; i just think she needs to learn how to train.  The second major complaint is that she comes across as a football coach; she needs to soften her tone of voice and speak more to the individual participant and acknowledge any challenges they may be having...she can say, for instance, ""it will help if you inhale on the way up and exhale on the way down""...and other helpful tips..  But, no!  in fact, breathing is critical to stretching and she doesn't even discuss it.  briefly, I would instead go with another stretch CD and avoid Annette Fletcher",1414627200,14,1342,4.581589958158996

She starts with your head and works her way down to your toes with a very easy to follow thorough body stretch.  I bought this particular video because I wanted a stretch for my hip that I had injured in a fall, before walking on my treadmill. It is great for that.  I am 52 years old and I am not interested in a fast paced aerobic movement eexcerise.  Even if you have not excercised at all you can do this, and your joints will thank you.  Your heart will speed up a little, but it's really to keep you joints fluid and it I'm sure it will do that.  It is not fast paced but, you can feel the stretch through your whole body.

2267499,4,B00095MBNK,"I am a daily at home exerciser.  Although I do a lot of yoga, I believe that it can also be important to incorporate more traditional types of stretching into my fitness regimen, especially given that I've had some problems with lower back pain as well as various other aches and pains as I've gotten older (I'm now in my mid-40s).  I did have another DVD by this instructor,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Save-Your-Lower-Back/dp/B00097C4B2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Save Your Lower Back</a>, and while that DVD was generally well-done, I found that overall, what it offered was too similar to other DVDs in my collection.  So, using Amazon's Trade-in program, I decided to swap that DVD for this one.

Annette Fletcher, a certified fitness instructor with a background in Pilates, teaches three different routines on this DVD.  On the Main Menu, you will find options for Welcome (a short overview by Fletcher), Joint Mobility: Head to Toe, Dynamic Stretch, Static Active Stretch, and then options to find out more about Fletcher, her DVDs, and Credits/Disclaimer.  For all three of the stretch segments, Fletcher teaches live.  She is alone in a large studio, and the only equipment is a mat.  I have described each section in greater detail below.

JOINT MOBILITY (22 minutes)
Fletcher starts with a brief introduction to this type of stretching, explaining how joint mobility uses larger movements to improve range of motion.  Beginning standing, she starts with the neck, first moving the head side-to-side, then twisting the next to either side, sliding the chin forward and back, and finishing with neck rolls.  Moving down the body, she performs shoulder shrugs, shoulder circles, elbow circles, and wrist circles.  Continuing to move down the arms, Fletcher moves the hands in and out and the fingers in and out.  She finishes the upper body with shoulder joint rotations and several variations on arm swings.  Starting with the torso, Fletcher circles the rib cage, then moves lower for hip circles.  This is followed by hip joint rotations (knee circles) with balance and then a double knee circle.  Coning to lying on her back, Fletcher performs ankle circles and toe stretches.  She then moves to all fours for cat/cow, also doing some rocking in this position as well as a wrist stretch.  Lying on the belly, Fletcher stretches the low back first by raising the chest, then by raising the legs as well.  Finally, she comes to a seated position for a dynamic flow from seated staff pose to upright table and back again; this is repeated several times.

DYNAMIC STRETCHES (18 minutes)
Fletcher states at the beginning that these are more active stretches; she implies that they might be used prior to a workout.  Starting with the feet in a second position, she performs pulsing side bends, moving into torso circles.  Moving to the side, she moves from a knee dip into a calf stretch and then a torso reach and pull before repeating these two moves on the second side.  Next, Fletcher comes back into a wide stance for moving side-to-side lunges.  This is followed by coming in and out of a low squat position.  Fletcher then comes down to the mat for downward facing dog.  After pedaling in down dog, she does a flow from down dog to plank and then down dog to forward bend, moving through this several times.  She then holds the down dog, reaching to the opposite calf in a three-legged balance.  Coming back to standing, Fletcher performs a rear lunge with a twist.  This is followed by what she calls a three-way hip stretch but what is really more of a balance challenge:  she first brings the knee forward and holds, then brings the leg behind in a quad stretch, then raises the leg behind in dancer's pose.  Next comes what Fletcher calls a spiderman plank, which is like a alternating gecko lunge.  Finally, she comes down to her back on the mat for some abs work, including a reclined twist and rolling like a ball that optionally evolves into the rollover.

STATIC/ACTIVE STRETCH (12 minutes)
This segment is made up of more traditional stretches that would most likely be performed post-workout; Fletcher recommends holding each stretch 15-30 seconds.  She again begins standing, first for a side stretch, then an inner thigh stretch in a plie position.  She moves into a lunge to stretch the hip flexor, offering several different options here.  This is followed by hamstring stretches, including runner's lunge and pyramid pose.  Coming to seated, Fletcher performs a seated cross-legged forward bend, a seated twist, and seated one-leg straddle, repeating these three moves on the other side to finish.

I liked this DVD overall.  I definitely thought that the Joint Mobility segment was the best--I felt great after doing this!  The Dynamic Stretch segment was okay, but it was done in a way that is definitely NOT going to be accessible for everyone, making it mainly appropriate for experienced exercisers only.  (Personally, I enjoy dynamic stretching, but I would prefer a routine such as Classic Stretch or Jill Miller's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Tune-Up-Post-Athletic-Stretch-Routines/dp/B003CNNMHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Tune Up Post Athletic Stretch Routines</a>.)  I did like the last segment and could see using it post-workout.  However, I tried it on a day that my back felt stiff, and it did very little to address this.

So, while I did like this DVD and would recommend it, I found it to have a few shortcomings as well, which is why my final rating is 4 of 5 stars.",1359849600,7,5618,5.1062431544359255
2267518,4,B00095MBNK,I like it because it challenged me at the same time it was easy enough for me to get in the groove. It is a DVD you can use and continue to change and grow in your exercise. I want to keep on doing it and see if I will change physically.,1355011200,,237,3.576923076923077
2267519,5,B00095MBNK,"PROs: I am a young guy who hasn't been active in some time due to injuries during sports. This workout really does some great things that physical therapists should include! I usually have numbness in my right hand, but by the time I get to the end of the workout the blood is pumping down my arm to my hand and I can feel my nerves ""waking up."" The entire workout takes about 30 minutes, and I try to do it everyday especially before I go to the gym or do something active.

CONs: I dislike that she calls one of the positions ""downward dog"" as the Hindus do when referring to yoga assanas, so I skip over that part. I would say it isn't as well suited for older people due to the speed of the stretches, but it can be useful if you go at a slower pace.",1353888000,4,754,4.026666666666666
2267520,3,B00095MBNK,This dvd is VERY hard on the knees. so many exercises that have way too much bending of the knees to be therepeutic. the one part that I did like was the part where you warmed up all of your joints. that part might be good as a daily warmup. the rest - no - way too advanced for my body.,1336176000,10,287,3.721311475409836

It is gentle, effective and fun.  You can easily modify it for your own abilities and range of motion.  The instructor is positive and her cueing is very easy to follow.  After doing the workout I feel more relaxed, more flexible, and much less stiff and sore.  I plan to check out other workouts from this instructor.",1296345600,2,527,4.5638297872340425
2267524,5,B00095MBNK,"I'm athletic, but have omitted regular stretching most of my life. As I get older, inflexibility is becoming much more obvious and unpleasant than it was when I was young and sprightly. Using this DVD, I don't think I'll return to being younger, but sprightliness is a definite possibility.
Specifically, these aspects are valuable to me:
The instructor is very clear and logical in the instructions and the reasoning behind the techniques.
The first section is full of gentle, progressive movements to improve the fluidity and suppleness of joints - it is GREAT to start the day with.
The second section incorporates stretching as well as warming up the muscle groups: excellent to prepare for more strenuous exercise.
The third section is a program of more familiar static stretches, to help recover from exercise, promote flexibility and prevent stiffness after working out.
I am so glad I purchased this DVD - I'm going to get a lot of use out of it. It's different from other stretching programs - a good addition to your workout regimen.",1294531200,7,1043,4.931818181818182

2267549,3,B00095MBNK,"I wish someone, anyone, had mentioned that in the dynamic stretch section, you are doing squats and lunges. I have no idea why a DVD that seems focused on joint health (in the title anyway), would include this. Squats and lunges are more plain old exercise rather than actual stretches in my opinion. I bought this for stretching so I am very disappointed. Of all the stretches I've seen for glutes, quads, and hamstrings, I was irritated that she chose exercises that are hard on the knees. That was in the dynamic stretch section and it lasted long enough to make me feel I had been fooled into buying this. In the Static stretch section, she does more stretches standing up that make you do another kind of squat. I got so frustrated I turned it off. I can't speak to the joint section as I haven't watched it yet.

I'll look through the whole thing and up or downgrade my rating after I look at the entire thing. But if you have bad knees and are getting this DVD for stretching, you may want to look elsewhere. So far I wish I could return this.",1282176000,70,1050,4.357142857142857
2267550,5,B00095MBNK,"I am so glad that I own this dvd.  It is trully stretch therapy.  Some have said that it is for exercise experts.  I don't think so as it is for everyone at every fitness level. Here are some details.

Section 1
Head turns and rolls, shoulder rolls,  arms swings forward and back, chest and torso circles, arm swings circular, hip circles, wrist twirls, finger plucking (like playing a harp), knee circles.  Then down to the floor for toe crunches flex and point, hip swings from seated to table top to swinging back between hands (this is the hardest pose in this section); simple backbends, simple twists.  I think there are wrists stretches while on your knees and you turm your wrists outward.

Section 2: Torso left/right and circles with hands behind head; lunges with twist, knee up to dancers pose to warrior 3; lunging side to side; plank to lunge with forearm on floor back to plank; walking down dog to plank forward and back;  I may have missed a pose or two. This section is the most intensive. It did get my heart rate up.  If you are new to stretching, I suggest you do what you can and rest until she goes to the next pose.

Section 3: Standing stretch with arms up. Side to side stretch; floor stretches.  This is the simplest and easiest of the 3 sections.

I loved this dvd and will do it again and again.  Let's face it, I'm not getting any younger and things hurt that have never hurt before.  I plan on doing this dvd on a regular basis as I head into middle age and beyond.",1281398400,33,1496,4.350180505415162

I plan to use one of the sessions after I walk on my treadmill to stretch my muscles before doing other workout DVDs.

As one ages, flexibility becomes a problem and although I have about a dozen yoga or stretching tapes, most of them just sit and gather dust.

As other reviews have stated, there are three different programs on this DVD: Joint Mobility, Dynamic Stretching and Static Stretching. Let me also add that this is very unlike Yoga and more like the exercises you did in high school.  Well,at least like the ones I did in high school.

8057365,5,B00095MBNK,"After experiencing some loss in flexibility and mobility, and hearing that these are the first things to go as you age, I bought at least a half a dozen stretching dvds.  I've been doing this one almost every day since the first time I tried it.  It is amongst the very best for several reasons.

1) As a woman of 45 years, who has led a primarily sedentary lifestyle for the past 15, I am able to work through this dvd while being challenged.
2) This is the most comprehensive stretch dvd I've seen yet.  There are three segments you can work with depending on what your stretch objectives are: a) joint mobility; b) dynamic stretches (this section is a bit of a workout if you're out of shape like I am); and c) muscular stretches.
3) My personal area of tightness/inflexibility, being the hamstrings, is addressed in several different ways throughout the dvd (but this is not a 'hamstrings' dvd, there's lots more going on too).

Finally, I see there's a three-star review titled something like 'for experts' that has lots of positive responses on it, so you've probably already read it...  I have to disagree with that reviewer.  I am definitely no expert and I benefit from this dvd.  Yes, there is a section in the dynamic stretches where you go repeatedly from downward dog to plank and back, and I'm not strong enough to do all of those yet, but it gives me something to work toward.  And, yes, the hamstrings stretches in the last section of the dvd are more than I can currently do, or maybe could ever do but, again, it gives me something to work toward... It's important to note that she always instructs on the beginner level before moving toward the advanced herself.",1473897600,14,1681,4.558139534883721

8057367,5,B00095MBNK,"It's strange to love a stretching DVD because I find stretching so painfully boringvery necessary, as I feel HORRIBLE when I'm all locked up, but painfully boring nonetheless. So I was incredibly surprised that I truly love this DVD... enough to have done it up to twice daily for the first two weeks, AND enough to do the entire thing lots of times that I intend to only do one section. :)

I'm a 36-year-old female with EXTREMELY tight hips, now that I've stopped running for over a year and had become almost completely sedentary. I also have chronically tight shoulders and neck from my desk job... or rather I ""had"" them, as this DVD has been helping immensely with that.

// THREE SECTIONS

One main reason I got this was the ""mini workouts"": I can choose how long to stretch depending on my level of tightness, or time available. The sections are:

1. JOINT MOBILITY

This section consists of full-body ""movement""not so much stretching, per seto return the synovial fluid to your joints for lubrication. Basically, here, you're rolling your joints about, trying to experience that full range of motion in every joint.

Why? The instructor explains in plain English that, as we get older, we get stiffer due to lack of movement, and that movement is the ONLY thing that can lubricates and consequently (re-)loosen the joints.

Arthritis-Health.com further explains:

""When the joint is at rest, the cartilage ABSORBS some of the synovial fluid. [!] When the joint is in use, the synovial fluid is squeezed OUT of the cartilage [and back into the joint!], much like how water is wrung from a sponge. Consequently, joint use is essential to circulate the synovial fluid throughout the joint.""

Section 1 does get your neck, shoulders, rib cage, hips, knees, ankles, toes, and feet moving... even your hands, wrists, and fingers. This is truly a FULL-body ""rollabout."" It's low-key though, so your heart rate doesn't increase, you won't likely get winded, and your muscles aren't tired after finishing. It loosens you up just enough to move to the next segment...

2. DYNAMIC STRETCHING

Your heart rate WILL increase during several of these exercises. You're also doing much BIGGER movements (that you may not be physically ready for, depending on how loose or tight you are... so remember to listen to your own body and DO NOT push too hard).

She has you doing things like reverse lunges with a torso twist, rolling stretches, a sumo-type stretch where you get down like a sumo wrestler to do your inner thighs, and a ""walking"" stretch where you transition on your hands from plank to downward dog, and back again.

This is actually a really good *workout*. It stretches me out wonderfully after the initial loosening in Section 1, and it's built up my balance, along with my leg, glute, and ab strength. (I have NOT attempted this one without doing Joint Mobility, yoga, or *something* first. My hips are much too tight and painful to jump right into this segment as the first thing I do.)

3. STATIC STRETCHING

Another fantastic segue, Section 3 lengthens your muscles after you've really warmed up amazingly in the last segment. I could do this section as the first physical activity I do in a day... but it wouldn't be anywhere near as comfortable, nor as beneficial, as doing it immediately following Dynamic Stretching.

In this segment, she has you doing lunges, the hip flexor stretch (that I HATE) where you have one knee on the ground, the opposite leg at a 90-degree angle in front of you with foot flat on the floor, then leaning a little forward into that planted foot. (Actually, I DON'T hate doing this stretch in this video, because I'm so warm by the time I get to it if I've started from Section 1. This is unprecedented, as it's one of my least favorite ways to contort my body in the whole entire world. But after exactly two weeks of doing this DVD nearly every day, if not every day... that stretch has finally started to feel GOOD, instead of like burny, searing, willy-giving pain no matter how shallow I stretched.)

// PROS

** She explains and demonstrates how to do *most* of the exercises very thoroughly. (More below.)

** Loosened up parts of my body that I never expected to benefitfor instance, my shoulders and wrists. I knew my shoulders were tight, but I hadn't a clue something like this would get me feeling ""normal"" again. I didn't know just how uncomfortable I had become in that area. The Joint Mobility section is golden. Truly, I'm thankful to have found and taken the risk to try this DVD, knowing how much I've despised stretching!

** The price is super-affordable, particularly for such an effective workout. I LOVE that there are different segments, that it's an hour long, and that it was still under $10.

// CONS:

** Like nearly every instructor I've ever tried (except my Ballet Body workout), the time spent stretching/working one side of the body is always a bit mismatched from the other. I usually pause the DVD a few seconds to extend the stretch on the ""lesser"" side, or I stretch the tightest side of my body when she's stretching the ""longest"" side.

** Like others have stated, the music is very aggravating. I hate the music for the first segment, but for the second one, it gets a little better. Fortunately it's low, so if you have the volume down enough, you can actually barely hear it.

** Production quality is low, from the menu design, to the way they abruptly cut to and from different camera angles in the intro. This doesn't affect the quality of the workout, so it's really moot, especially at this price. (I just can't get over the sheer effectiveness of this routine for under $10.)

** She CONSTANTLY MAKES SEVERE, STRANGE, STRAINED FACIAL CONTORTIONS. My BF couldn't watch the DVD intro where she explains joint mobility, lest he be too distracted. She doesn't seem comfortable in front of the camera, especially at first, and she constantly swallows and strains her neck like she's swallowing a camel.

6/9/2016 UPDATE: This actually has turned out to be a HUGE con. I bought another of her DVDs, and the faces are even worse there. She is SO tense, rigid, forced, and ""face-y."" 80% of the time you pause it, she's making a horrid face. I'm not being funny or trying to be mean; it's completely unavoidable and is turning us off from doing her workouts. Because I can't take the faces, I make it a point to look away from the TV as soon as I know the movement, focusing on my form in the mirror instead.

** I wish she explained the benefits of later exercises, such as exactly what muscles you're supposed to be stretching, to use as a gauge to ensure I'm doing it right. For instance, there's one where you sit on the floor with your legs out in staff pose. You go from rocking backward (holding yourself up with straight arms, hands on the floor) to forward (like a half bridge, quads toward the ceiling, legs at a 90-degree angle with feet flat on the floor). Since I don't know what I'm supposed to be stretching there, I'm only hoping I'm working the right body parts.

** There's too much explanation for the moves. The workout could be 40 minutes long if she didn't over-explain, which is helpful the first few times, but maddening once you've memorized the movements.

// SUMMARY:

To provide a truly balanced review, I listed my ""cons"" ... but NONE of them are honestly enough to take off stars from this highly effective, mostly enjoyable, and affordable workout. I paid $25 [!!!] for ""Fit and Bendy: Get Bent"" for other reasons. I don't like it anywhere near as much because it doesn't work anywhere near as well for me at this stage of tightness. Hopefully after doing this more and for longer, I'll be able to do Fit and Bendy and get great benefits. For now, Stretch and Joint Mobility Therapy is my favorite tape to put in when I need to loosen up... which is every day (or I regret it)!

// 6/9/16 UPDATE: I just did Get Bent again last night, and having done yoga plus this DVD almost daily for the past month plus... Get Bent now doesn't hurt! I get the same deep benefits I feel from this DVD, being able to stretch more completely in my new looser state. :)

PLEASE NOTE: The Joint Mobility segment may feel annoying, pointless, and awkward as you move your joints around in what may be, to you, a, boredom-inspiring way. I felt like that the first time or two I did this... but HANG IN THERE. You may start to enjoy it, even if JUST from the great benefits.

This DVD flows together in such a well-thought out, methodical, and sensible way that it's like she's helping you open up ""layers"" of mobility. And each layer builds so well upon the next pieces to come that you don't want to stop the stretchand you want to do it all the time. Well, I generally do. Though I still can't take the faces!! (Two pics are from her other DVD, but faces are the same across all. ;-( )",1461196800,13,8880,4.607097591888467
