4709435,1,B005IGVTD8,"Plot: An unfortunate woman is kidnapped and subjected to deranged abuses. When she resists, her captor warns her that if she does not comply with his wishes, he will seek a new victim, but that other woman will be killed after his wishes are fulfilled. He videotapes his attacks and forces the captive to watch, telling her that she could have prevented the ordeal. Each time she says ""no"" she is really saying, ""Defile another woman.""

This movie was painfully bad. The only thing good about this movie was the premise and that was horribly neglected in favor of long slow meaningless shots of naked women, which I normally wouldn't mind. But combined with crap music, virtually no dialog, no tension, worse acting than you'd see in an elementary school Christmas play and truly awful camera work, and this waste of celluloid doesn't even work as porn.

Seriously, there are rape scenes in this movie and the only reason that you can tell anything is going on is that the woman involved moves up and down in the frame as if being pushed, with an expression that can only be described as constipated.

I actually believe that I could take this concept and make a better movie using a cheap digital camera and a rented boom mike with hookers instead of actresses.

The ONLY nice thing that I can say about this movie is that the women are fairly attractive. They can't act to save their lives, but they look pretty decent. You know, for hookers.

I'd give this movie 0 of 5 stars but Amazon won't let me. It is completely and utterly worthless with no redeeming qualities. Do not waste your money on this film.",1351209600,35,1609,4.592334494773519
4709436,1,B005IGVTD8,"TERRIBLE!!  NOT JUST SOME PARTS -  THE WHOLE THING WAS TERRIBLE.  I REALIZE THAT THIS MOVIE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE A PLOT, BUT THIS ISN'T EVEN INTERESTING. NOTHING GOOD ABOUT IT",1348185600,14,178,4.5
4709437,1,B005IGVTD8,"The description of this so called movie is misleading. Do not waste your time or money. The ""acting"" is atrocious and the camera work is the same. I could not even get past 7 minutes before I turned it off, ejected it, broke the disk up into several pieces and threw it in the trash.",1344816000,8,283,4.163636363636364

8474665,1,B005IGVTD8,"Whenever I purchase a movie either from here or from the store I always read reviews whether it's from just other Amazon buyers or critics so I kind of have an idea of what I'm getting into. Well, I had purchased this movie on here on an impulse buy quite awhile ago. When I bought it there were no reviews for it on here yet and when I searched Google I couldn't find much about this movie besides the concept. When it comes to the concept I thought it sounded different and interesting and thought what the hell I'll just get it. After months and months of just sitting on the shelf (I kind of lost interest in it when I got it) I finally got around to watching it.
Now I know why I always wait until there's info about a movie before I buy it. There's really no story to it whatsoever. The only story you kind of get about what is suppose to be going on is the paragraph on the back of the dvd case. All it is, is about a hour or so of some guy with a crappy camcorder taping topless women posing and pretending they're scared by having a frown on their face. This was 20 bucks on here when I got it. It dropped in price but it's still not worth it. I know there's some people who'll want it for the women in the movie but even then if you want to see topless women just buy a playboy and save yourself the extra 6 bucks.",1378771200,12,1324,4.0
