5391225,4,B00A704L3K,"The producers/writer/director must have been doing acid when they came up with this one. It borders on surreal. How you take a story with domestic violence at its core and play much of it as comedy is way beyond my sensibilities.

Here's the scoop. Ha-eun is married to Gwak chun-sim who is a champion kickboxer. He beats her regularly on little more than a whim. She's so pitiful even her daughter has no respect for her. On a p.r. boondoggle she challenges him to a kickboxing match. She's so timid and frightened there is no hope of her winning. In another screw-up she signs on to train with a guy who, as it turns out, is a math teacher and doesn't know the first thing about kickboxing. How are they to pull this off?

So...we have an early scene where her brute of a husband is beating her and then beats the daughter. These are difficult to watch in their viciousness. She moves out and in with a friend. Then the subsequent match is proposed and she has three months to buck up and become  good enough to beat a man who has just killed his opponent in the ring. This is where things turn comic. I thought I just tuned into some other movie. It does a complete 180. Her trainer is as mild-mannered as she is. He's a middle-aged, single, book-wormish type guy who can't even garner the respect of his students. He drives a heap of a car that stinks like butt and you can't roll down the windows. They train and she starts to feel her oats but she just doesn't have the necessary killer instinct.

Then the big match comes. This is a real fairy tale . They did the best they could to pull it off but I wasn't buying it. This was really weird. I liked what they had to say. It was just really cock-eyed. Don't get me wrong. This is a very entertaining watch. You like the characters and you root for who you should root for and you sneer at the villains. The camera work was interesting and Ji-Won To as Ha-eun has the face of an angel. She's a pleasure to watch. Maybe this shouldn't be at the top of your list, but if you happen upon it, it's worth your time.",1363046400,,2066,4.249363867684479
5391226,5,B00A704L3K,"This movie is one of my favorite domestic violence movies to date. The revenge that reaped on her ex-husband was too good. Though I lost hope in her towards the end she really turned it around and the movie is truly a gem. I would defintiely recommend buying it. It took Enough to a whole other level. Though I wish her husband's character was more developed and dimensional, this movie was just awesome.  I loved the fight at the end and her belief in herself. A true jewel this movie is.",1361750400,4,489,4.373626373626373
5391227,3,B00A704L3K,"there's only one reason to watch this ridiculous movie - Choi Seol Ri - or as she is now better known as - F(x) Sulli

why ridiculous - the film starts out with ugly scenes of a horribly abusive marriage - with their beleaguered teenage daughter - then becomes a comedy as the wife is forced to learn martial arts in 3 months - after she challenged her professional mixed martial artist husband to a duel

the actors are mostly too good for the story - but none are better the Seol Ri as the teenager - during every scene of hers - i kept saying to myself - ""this kid's going to be a star"" - she had incredible screen presence - the camera loved her - and she communicated the girl's angst clearly to the audience

i had seen her before in another Korean film called BA BO - which i happened to rent a few days after the girl group F(x) debuted in Korea - and i was stunned to learn that the pretty girl in that film was now the tall and cute Sulli singing and dancing on stage

she was very good in BA BO - but it was a conventional nice girl role - while in this film - the role is moody and more demanding - and she conquers all - for that - i am adding a couple extra stars to my ranking - while i give only 1 star to the film in itself

i hope Seol Ri works on her english so a wider audience can discover her

dear F(x) Krystal and F(x) Amber - please help her to that end",1356393600,2,1378,3.886120996441281
5391228,3,B00A704L3K,"I love movies where the underdog rises to the occasion and tops the bully.  What is a more diverse comparison than between a woman whose husband is a MMA champion and gets his kicks out of beating her up.  Now she will tolerate that believing that is was always her fault until he starts toward her daughter.  To protect her she knocks him out with a frying pan.  A wonderful use of normal kitchen item.  But it doesn't stop there, a past lover and appears and challenges her husband to a fight and then dies in the ring.  The woman totally losses it and in a fit of anger she says she will fight her husband in the ring before God and country in three months.  In mock retaliation he says he will tie his left hand behind his back.  All this leads up to the conflict that all good stories need.  Now the lady finds a man who is trying to turn a broken down Gym into a day care center and who knows nothing about fighting.  But after she inherits a large sum of money he agrees to help train her.  So he starts training himself so he can train her.  This was why this only got 3 stars and not more.  To even consider that this barely 100 lb woman with no training is then trained by a trainer who has never fought and she then beats an MMA champion who has trained all his life, I don't think so.  I really did like the story line, the acting was a little over the top, and yes I'm a sucker for stories like this.  I thought it could have been done better and the ending really didn't work but it was nice, so three stars.",1439078400,,1522,4.060402684563758
5391229,4,B00A704L3K,"At first I thought this would be a strictly serious story, but they actually added in some comedic moments. Still it does express the issue of Domestic Abuse. I don't know much about the domestic abuse statistics in South Korea. Otherwise, this movie provided a decent slice-of-life into Korean culture. It was a bit unbelievable at times, but still an enjoyable movie.",1436400000,,369,4.967741935483871
5391230,5,B00A704L3K,"Loved it and it was not like she trained to be some diesel strong fighter.  Some lucky shots, then knocked him dazed and confused. It had a good message ",1434067200,,153,4.241379310344827

5391233,3,B00A704L3K,"The acting and action scenes were very good. The translation, unfortunately, didn't seem to carry the complete emotions displayed on the screen. Worth a look.",1415404800,,158,5.36

5391235,4,B00A704L3K,"There are complaints that this movie depicts domestic violence vividly, especially in context of a film with light-hearted moments, or that the idea that a fight between a professional boxer and a lightweight amateur (never mind a woman with very little training) would ever even be allowed. I guess those things are true, so if they'd bother you, stay away. But since when is the David-and-Goliath story supposed to be believable?

Personally, I think there's still a lot to recommend about the movie. I can't speak for the actual situation in Korean culture, but it's all-too-believable that a woman would remain in a brutal physically abusive relationship, and that many in society would either refuse to believe that the abuse even happened, or would defend the abuser by blaming the woman. It's an important reminder that even as far as we've come in the US, this dynamic still exists here and to an even greater extent elsewhere.

At the same time, the script goes beyond a simple depiction of right and wrong. Even beyond the well-trodden path of codependency. We follow a woman in a unique position of having challenged her professional-fighter, abusing husband to an actual match in the ring. And yes, there's a fair amount of borrowing from ""Rocky"" here, but there's also a lot that you'd never see in American cinema: genuine character development, with real and believable emotional responses to the situations.

There's certainly some dramatic license being taken, especially to set up the plot. Ha-eun isn't just motivated by the attack on her daughter and the general pattern of abuse; she is avenging the death of her lost love. But given that, her accusation and challenge to her husband in the heat of a press conference is utterly understandable.

Likewise, throughout her training we see someone with determination, but also a lack of confidence. And even as she gets stronger, old patterns of response to the abuse are revealed in confrontations with her husband. It's heartbreaking, but strongly revealing at the same time. Even through the end, Ha-eun is driven not so much by an anger fueled by years of abuse, but a choice to finally stand up for herself. To defend herself and her daughter in spite of her fear and basic lack of aggression.

True to the traditions of outside-Hollywood film-making, this is a hard-to-characterize movie. Certainly it's got the underdog-vs-predator element. But it's also got some real character drama story-telling. It shares cultural insight, and addresses a real social problem. And on top of that, it's got some genuinely funny spots, a bit of comedic relief at sometimes surprising moments. Like many great films, it refuses to be pigeonholed.

That's what makes it so good.",1408838400,4,2737,5.030905077262693
5391236,1,B00A704L3K,"You guys had me fooled. All the positive reviews made it seem like this was a really good movie. Look, I'm 1,000% against domestic violence and would beat the crap out of a guy that beats his wife or children. I have never and will never lay a hand on my wife, but this movie was just absurd. It's just a really poor version of Enough with Jennifer Lopez. At least with her it actually seemed like she had a fighting chance. This movie???? There's no chance in hell. Dumb luck doesn't begin to explain all this. If they want to promote the ending of domestic violence, this wasn't the way to do it. Sadly disappointed. Had she at least half way through her training seemed more confident, had she at least seem she could run a mile without collapsing or had he isn't the reigning champion that can take an actual beating... maybe I can see this happening.

All that said, I do support abused women and children to overcome their situation and get out of it as quickly as possible. No one should be treated that way. Take care.",1408752000,,1026,4.371727748691099
5391237,4,B00A704L3K,"This movie was kind of along the lines of ""ENOUGH""  with Jennifer Lopez but Korean.  I liked it. I thought it was going to be bad but I loved how it ended. great.",1401926400,2,162,3.878787878787879
5391248,3,B00A704L3K,"A great movie mixed about a serious issue and with just a right about humorous moments. Not so strong on the martial arts side, but it was okay.",1400976000,,144,4.178571428571429
5391249,2,B00A704L3K,"I liked the story line, since it deals with the topic of spousal abuse and the challenges it poses, especially to the victims and the children in a family.  But I felt the movie was sensationalized and, the concept that the heroine could train for 3 months and develop even marginal MMA skills, completely unrealistic.  That particular element of the movie undermined what might have been a powerful and poignant tale about breaking away from an abusive situation.",1394582400,,464,4.935897435897436
5391250,5,B00A704L3K,"A good movie that supports a serious subject matter with a touch of laughter. Overall, a must watch for gaining a perspective on how women are treated in a world of violent men.",1392768000,,177,4.393939393939394
5391251,2,B00A704L3K,"Was expecting a more action, serious type of movie, but it wasn't. They tried to make it funny when it shouldn't be. If this movie was suppose to send a message to the Korean people about domestic violence, then they did a horrible and unrealistic job.",1378512000,,252,4.5
5391252,5,B00A704L3K,"This movie was not what I expected at all,  I guess I should have read the description but I was gratefully surprised.  I'm not going to go into the details of the movie, but I thought it was going to be like every other seriously overdone revenge movie I've seen in the past and really didn't expect the comic relief.  It started off so serious and then slowly transitioned into the comedy scenes which really relaxed the tone on the subject matter of domestic violence.  I'll definitely have to add this one to my collection.",1375747200,,527,4.515789473684211
5391253,4,B00A704L3K,"I've read some of the other reviews, so I won't add too much. First domestic violence and comedy... Okay, I agree the two don't mix in a 'real' situation; however, when telling a story or watching a movie sometimes the topic is so horrendous that in order for some to tolerate it you need some humour. I'm one of those people. So, I didn't mind the mix. Secondly, I gave this a 4/5 rating because I've seen a lot of Korean dramas and I know what bad is. This movie isn't bad, in regards to the acting and storyline. Last, but not least is Sulli. Her acting is dabaek (wow). Seeing Sulli in this movie was a pleasant surprise. I had no idea she was a part of the cast. *Sulli is a member of the KPOP group F(x). I loved her rebelliousness. I can't wait to see more from her.",1374278400,,773,4.125827814569536
5391254,5,B00A704L3K,This film starts out inexplicably Korean---they never make any sense.

5391257,5,B00A704L3K,The film starts as a brutal story of domestic violence. It then takes a sharp comedic turn which is needed after the brutality of the first half.
