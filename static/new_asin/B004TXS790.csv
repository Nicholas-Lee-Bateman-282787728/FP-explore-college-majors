4466161,5,B004TXS790,"There  Have  been  many  films  about  Adolf  Hitler  and  They  usually  Just  Rant &  Rav  About  How  Horrible  he  was ,  This  Film  is  Unique  Because  it  Shows  Hitler  before  the  Propaganda  of  WW  II  made  him  out  to  be  a  villain !  It  shows  Him  as  Time  Magazines  ""  Man of The Year For 1938 "" and  His  Great  Speaking  Ability .  The  Negative  Propaganda  of  WW II  Has  Brainwashed  Millions  Against  Hitler !  They  Don't  do  That  Type  of  Horrible Stereotyping  anymore , but  Hitler  Got  a  Double  Dose !  In  Conclusion  I  say  If  You  Are  Looking  For  a  Film  That  Really  &  Fairly  Portrays  Hitler  As  One  of  The  Greatest  Leaders  in  History ,  This  is  it .  I  Really  Liked  the  Contribution  of  Alfonse Heck . He  was  There  and  Witnessed  everything  !  Buy  This  Film  at  Any  Price ,  it  is  one  of  The  True  Pieces  of  History  we  Have .",1366675200,2,915,3.9936305732484074
4466162,4,B004TXS790,"This documentary is well made with some rarely seen footage and candid interviews with several key figures of the Third Reich. The film itself is one of the very few which attempts to take an even handed approach to the subject matter, who is perhaps one of the most hated men in history. That really says something about the producers, who made this film to air on the 100th anniversary of Hitler's birth in 1889 on the BBC. For those with no or little familarity with Hitler, or who would like to see a less ""sensationalized"" and more factual film about the man and his times, this is for you. The movie makes to attempt to downplay or justify the horrors of the Third Reich however.",1317686400,16,685,4.444444444444445

8441092,5,B004TXS790,This a far and away the best source of information for learning what Adolf Hitler and his times were all about. One of the biggest reasons for that are the interviews with important people who were involved in those events. There is a lot of so called history out there about Hitler and the Nazis that is not very objective---or honest. This production is both of those things.,1486252800,,377,4.5588235294117645

8441098,5,B004TXS790,An excellent documentary that delivers on its title. It provides an original and objective analysis of Hitler's appeal and how certain factors led a people to embrace him and how the spell was broken during the aftermath of his reign.,1374624000,3,234,4.875
8441099,5,B004TXS790,This topic isn't a nice one to say the least but it clearly shows the rise and fall of Hitler in a view of the bbc who did it. It shows how due to the economical situation in Germany in the 20's and 30's allowed the rise of one of the most evil men of the 20th century.,1371081600,3,269,3.6551724137931036
