5880696,5,B00DZUV0M4,Lonesome Dove has always been a favorite of mine . Bonus for me is that this contained all the mini series .,1389744000,,108,3.9545454545454546
5880697,5,B00DZUV0M4,This was a gift to my husband who has been a long time Lonesome Dove fan. I was looking for each separately but found this 4-in-1 DVD. I was skeptical at first because I have experienced bad quality with multi-movies on disc but these were excellent in both picture quality and sound.,1389312000,,284,4.480769230769231
5880698,1,B00DZUV0M4,Return to Lonesome Dove should not even be part of this 4 pack!!!! It's not in the real saga!  It should be Streets of Laredo.,1389139200,5,126,4.04

5880702,5,B00DZUV0M4,Very nice set I couldn't find a good stopping point so I ended up watching the whole set in one sitting. Just couldn't stop watching. If you like the old west it is well worth investing in.,1386028800,,189,4.135135135135135
5880703,5,B00DZUV0M4,"This four pack is a wonderful prelude to Lonesome Dove, and like Lonesome Dove, had good times and heartaches; however no profanity. Gus was played wonderfully, almost as good as old Gus himself.  Thank yo for recommending it to us. I especially like movies with heart, although sometimes broken, however no obscenities. Everyone shoud was these mov ies at least once.  Mary conen",1385510400,,380,5.015873015873016
5880704,3,B00DZUV0M4,They have compressed six hours onto a two hour DVD and the quality is quite poor. Movement is jerky and not smooth. You would be better off to spend a little more and order the separate movies.,1383350400,78,193,4.243243243243243

5880713,5,B00DZUV0M4,"Dont buy anything from from SURPLUS DVD!!! They sent us a damaged dvd set and did not replace or refund our money. With that said...the series  (which we had to watch on YouTube) is awesome. Great story and superb acting. The main characters are played by different actors in each series, but they are all excellent and bring new character to each role they play. The story is brilliant and will shine a new light onto a more authentic portrayal of the American West in the 1800's. Very up close and personal.",1512345600,,509,4.532608695652174

5880763,5,B00DZUV0M4,The BEST western there EVER was. Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duval MASTERFUL!!!!!!! A timeless treat!,1475539200,,100,5.3125
5880764,3,B00DZUV0M4,"IF you like authentic (as actors w/perfect teeth), except for supporting, you'll enjoy this mini-adenture, spanning the mid age of their lives. If you enjoy Robert Duvall, which I love, altho' he is a character actor: but many parts and Tommy Lee Jones, who ( I think the best movie his acting career started with, was a 'dark-horse' flick based on the famous Nebraska kids gone wrong, doing what dysfunctional youth can do. BTW, when/if you check it out his female co-star-and I am going to make you look it up playes a supporting role, NOT! Without her 'supporting role' this flick would never have a chance to get distribution.
I have loved, and am in love with Diane Lane. Starting as a child actor, regardless of the success of the film, she made her part(s) convincing....but an Actor can only do soooo much with what is handed to them in script AND Directing material(s). She has always accomplished this. Her supporting role in this flick could have/should have been detailed and elaborated; not to the point of shadowing the two main actors, BUT making THEM more believable. She did her best.
Houston, another Female Actor, with a list of accomplishments as long as she has acted, was dealt the same 'cards'. Like Lane, she brought real 'bellievablity' to the closing of the film.
....The ENTIRE 'Laredo' adventure took away/not added to the film. It wasn't necessary, and because it was left in, it lessened the entire value of the film: I lost  track of/and why the drama detoured, during the  'cattle drive'.  Honorable Mention: The Sheriff in the 'Laredo' portion protrayed the character beautifully; he added dimension.  The 'wild child/girl' character was cast by an 'unknown' Actor; her protrayal of the character, tho' brief was excellent---it should have been lengthen, even placed in the 'cattle drive' as a supporting character contrasting Lane's character: real possibilities.
The 'Gambler' character should have never been put in the script! It brought NO dimension to the film's sucess-it was an unnecessary distraction. The Actor that played the 'Gamble' in my opinion (and he did obtain some small sucess later) should have found another profession: I speak a a 'view', O', I forgot a customer that can break/or make the careers of EVERY ONE in the film.
The flm lost my concentration after the 'cattle drive' ended. I saw the writer's as being 'tired' and just wanted to conclude the film as quickly as possible.  They were forced too to do this because of the 'entire' Laredo detour. Some smart person that eliminated the Laredo detour (for the film, at least) should have demanded that the writers take this gift of substantial time to deepen the characters, the plots (while on the drive), etc.
The film ending was a complete waste of my time. Jones character should have just ridden off with/w/o Duvall's character and the supporting actors should have been given opportunities to show the 'talents' .
Jones riding off the ranch should have been the end of the film, as written. Everything after that wasted my time watching. I felt cheated.
The film started out with character depth and plot, but quickly began to confuse me.  Many portions besides the Laredo venture could have been written while on the trail. The 'cattle trail' and the adventures along the trail, while on the trail; not straying off course, would have turned this film from 'okay' to 'good' or 'great'.
It had potential. It's a shame. I believe, as a viewer, the film had every opportunity to become a 'classic'. It didn't. This is a poor example, but as a viewer, I could compare it as 'coitus interruptus.",1475452800,,3609,4.869706840390879

5880810,4,B00DZUV0M4,"At $6.99, the Lonesome Dove 4-pack is one of the best dollars per hour viewing bargains you can find.  The series draws its strength, as do all great westerns, by addressing fundamental questions: What makes a good life? What makes a good man?  When does a life cease to become worth living? What are the roles of loyalty, love, friendship and moral principle?  In Lonesome Dove, the contrast between the warm embrace of life and people by Augustus McRae (Robert Duvall) and the utterly principled but emotionally empty and constricted Woodrow Calls  both legendary Texas Rangers  brings these issues into sharp relief and McRaes final scene of ""Lonesome Dove"" is unforgettable.

Return to Lonesome Dove keeps these issues in clear focus and develops them further by contrasting the rigid Call (now played by Jon Voigt) with cattle magnate Gregor Donnigan (Oliver Reed), a warm and passionate man with deep and fierce personal attachments who is also a cold-blooded murdered on the path to expanding his empire at the expense of Call and so many others.  Donnigan has rescued his much-younger wife Ferris (Reese Witherspoon) from a sordid past and loves her dearly and openly but unselfishly plans a future for her when he is gone with Calls known but unacknowledged son, Newt Dobbs (Ricky Schroder) who is at emotional loggerheads with Call for his refusal to embrace him as his son.  The deep conflict between a rich but amoral personality who is a widely respected empire builder with the emotionally crippled and stunted inner life of Call could not be plainer, and the final words between Ferris and Newt bring home why two souls drawn towards and seemingly destined for each other must remain worlds apart.  The display of moral courage by Call that brought about these final words between the would-be lovers will remain etched in memory and it is hard not to think that only a man with so few personal ties could ever be quite so brave.

Larry McMurtry, the author on whose work the series is based, despised and disowned this second installment, insisting that each of the final two be titled Larry McMurtrys  But this is both a shame and misguided vanity.  In keeping alive and making vivid the conflict between competing visions of what makes a life worth living, Return to Lonesome Dove is almost as good as its predecessor and far better than either of the final two that McMurtry cobbled together  which are still worth watching.

A leading critique complains of ""too much compression"" but unless you are committed to watching the video quality and ignoring the film this is a perfectly watchable series.",1457395200,2,2618,4.893665158371041

5880890,5,B00DZUV0M4,"There should be a choice for ""Awesome Read"" because ""Sayan Knights""  looks like it may be another winner for Ms Gardner.  I know her 1929 series were cliff hangers.  By the time I finished reading the series, I felt as though, somehow, the family had moved away and I lost track of them.  Believe it or not, I actually missed them. Her ""Purling Road"" series has helped me. LOL I feel an addiction to this author's writings.  She is fantastic and has a way of holding your interest.  Turning pages to skip the boring parts does not exist with her stories.  There is no boring parts. I pray that someone will take note of her stories and make a television series with it. Her stories are so interesting and realistic that you automatically become addicted to them. It is a good read when the characters are so real in it that you actually miss them.  ""Sayan Knights"" is on it's way to being another winner and I can hardly wait to get the entire series of ""1929"" and ""Sayan Knights""  in book form for my library of great, want to read again and again books.",1427328000,,1055,4.369230769230769

5880926,3,B00DZUV0M4,"The cinematography is very attractive with romantic scenery, authentic costuming, rustic surroundings, etc.  A persistent complaint for me and my wife is dialogue that is difficult to hear which makes it difficult to understand what male or female characters are saying.  Perhaps it is a combination of it not being filmed on a sound stage but mainly outdoors and not being voiced over, and the idiom of the era.  Too bad when I consider how much these productions must have cost in time and money.  Would otherwise been one of the classic westerns.  The use of different players representing the same characters makes it difficult to follow in the different films.  If one doesn't follow the films in proper chronology one has difficulty knowing the correct sequence of events.",1416355200,2,778,4.992248062015504

5880930,3,B00DZUV0M4,"I gave this set 3 stars only... for the fact that there are no subtitles & the audio was not great, in fact, on my 47 inch TV, I had the volume up to 85 out of 100 in order to hear it, even up to 90... that's pretty sad... I wish that when DVD's are released, that they all have subtitles and have the volume up to a level, where I don't need to turn the TV up to a hundred in order to hear it! Unfortunately, many DVD releases have similar issues... that's why I prefer to download most of my movies, 3000 and counting... all free... where I can adjust the volume level to where on my TV, my volume level is no higher than 35... I bought this at Wal-Mart for $10... I couldn't find an excellent copy online in order to download... That's my review...",1415232000,9,751,4.013333333333334

5880939,5,B00DZUV0M4,I have watched this video several times over the years. I recommend it to anyone that is building a good video library.

The prices is right and they do play without any issues, but it is very noticible that the picture isn't sharp and clear.  My major complaint with this purchase was the shipping!

This 4 pack seemed to be a good option, but upon playing it, I found that it was not closed-captioned.  It was a real disappointment, and I'll have to go shopping again.  As far as story lines go, my favorites, worth 5 stars were Lonesome Dove and Return to Lovesome Dove, although the other two are good also.

I THINK THAT MOST FANS OF WESTERN WOULD ENJOY ALL OF THESE. THEY WERE OF GOOD QUALITY AND PICTURE WAS GOOD.  DID NOT RETURN, WILL GIVE TO SOMEONE THAT CAN USE AND ENJOY THEM.
