1425873,3,B00005ICGJ,"Enjoyable but not much skiing action more just extreme living amongst young ""dudes"".  Probably wouldn't have purchased if knew how little actual skiing filmed but some interesting aspects to extra ciricular activities off the mtns.",1325980800,,231,5.6
1425874,4,B00005ICGJ,"This film has some heavy hitters in the lineup, with the unfortunate exception of Seth Morrison not being in it.  Nobis holds down the fort for the skiers, and Jeremy Jones for the boarders.  The film is 90% skiing; Jones does all the 10% of the boarding that's in the film; being that this is a big mountain flick, it's only appropriate that J. Jones, the godfather of snowboard big mountain riding, gets a montage.  This is one of the best movies you can buy to please a mixed crowd of skiers and boarders.  It's big mountain heavy, which is nice - about 90%.  The kickers in the flick are not repetitive and are bit worthy.  Plus, there are a number of great avalanche & head cam shots.  This film is solid.  I concur that the soundtrack SUCKS and those damn voice overs really ruin the momentum of certain scenes.  Just turn off the volume and crank your own jams.  Also, note that J. Jones' snowboard footage is 85% copied/cut straight in from Totally Board 9 (another Redline series movie release the same year).",1090108800,3,1018,4.483695652173913
1425875,3,B00005ICGJ,"This movie has some great shots, but the soundtrack is pretty bad, I just turn it off.  It also has a very unprofessional feel to it, despite some great shots.  Overall, its ok, feels like TGR needs some fine tuning.  The helmet cams are awesome, that needs to be used more often.",1078012800,,280,4.346153846153846
1425876,3,B00005ICGJ,"The Jeremy Nobis sequence at the begining of this movie gets your hopes up but a mediocre soundtrack and a few annoying voice overs put this at the bottom of my list when looking over my ski movie collection. (13, Global Storming, Ski Movie, High Society, and Propaganda)
A must rent, but definitely not a must buy...",1047168000,3,317,4.578947368421052
1425877,5,B00005ICGJ,"The title above says it all, this is the BEST skiing dvd made to date, full of action, excitment, and incane footage at times, makes this a dvd not one to be missed.",989539200,,165,4.03030303030303
1425878,4,B00005ICGJ,Well this defintly is a good movie but there is defintly better like Ski Movie or There's Something about McConkey.  This sure is a good movie but it could use some more riders but overall a solid movie and a must get for ultimate skiers.,980121600,8,238,4.288888888888889
1425879,4,B00005ICGJ,"Further is an awsome movie which has the perfect balance of big mountain and new school skiing.  It features some of the years best moments in skiing.  The scene where Candide Thovex hits a 118 foot gap or when Tanner Hall hits a rail at the top of a cliff are insane.  The heli skiing scenes are breathtaking and the soundtrack rules.  Their is also alot of cool park and pipe footage. If you are a two plancker, buy this movie right now!",974073600,4,439,4.253012048192771

7938320,5,B00005ICGJ,"This film takes on more of a documentary feel than many snowboard movies, which is a good thing. Jones always find interesting places to ride and interesting people to ride with. His status as a legend is well earned.",1370044800,,217,4.589743589743589
7938321,5,B00005ICGJ,"I actually bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who is a snowboard filmer and editor, and he really liked it. I don't personally snowboard, but I found it really interesting and fun to watch. Would recommend to anyone!",1363564800,,220,4.525

7938325,5,B00005ICGJ,"The catch about this movie is that it is different and it shows a lot more about the adventure side than the technical tricks and flips behind some movies. I know that the riding is very technical, but I enjoyed it more for the back story of how long it took to get to certain places and what conditions they must endure for a unique experience. I found it to really hit a deeper part of the ""calling"" in me that is the endurance athlete and adventurer and I'm glad I bought the movie. I read that there will be a third movie so I can't wait. One thing I'd like to really also acknowledge is the family sacrifice that Jeremy makes to do these movies. I'm his age and have children that appear to be similar in age and when I see how he stays gone for such a period of time to do these scenes, I really respect that level of commitment. Glad I bought the movie and I can support the continued adventures.",1353283200,4,903,4.136363636363637
