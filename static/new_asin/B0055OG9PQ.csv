4578665,5,B0055OG9PQ,"For Power Circuit Training with Jackie, you will need a mat & two sets (heavy + light) of weights. Jackie's system focuses on form, function & fatigue. Circuits are 4 minutes each.  The targeted body part is worked in three 1 minute exercises.  The last minute is what Jackie calls ""Power Burn"" in which all three exercises are combined to fatigue the muscles.

On the main menu, there are 5 options to choose from:

- 15 minute Total Body Circuit
- 15 minute Abs only Circuit
- 15 minute Lower Body Circuit
- 15 minute Upper Body Circuit
- 40 minute Total Body Circuit

Here's a breakdown of the 40 minute Total Body Circuit:

Warm-up - 2 minutes
light jog, side to side taps, squat kicks, chain breakers (elbows up-open/shut)opens up the chest, back stroke & trunk twists

Circuit 1 - Quads
 *Sissy Squats - these are done with your heels on your weights.  You can choose to add intensity by holding weights
 *UFCs - drop down to one knee, then other knee, up one knee, up other knee (I've also seen this in one of Jillian's workouts)
  to add intensity on this move, stay in the squat position
 *Front Lunge - hands on hips or hold weights for extra intensity

Circuit 2 - Hamstrings
 *Deadlifts - use heavier weights, go past knees and come up with a pop
 *Bridge Extensions - in bridge position, alternate kicking legs up
 *Reverse Plank - these are a killer - talk about BURN!!!

Circuit 3 - Glutes
 *Front Squats - weights held up in front of chin while squat through heels - she moves fast!
 *Ski Lunge - side to side lunges, constant motion - felt the burn =)
 *Squat Kicks - squat with alternate leg kicks

Circuit 4 - Chest
 *Chest Press - Jackie does an excellent job explaining form for this
 *Reverse Fly - open up then squeeze and twist up (like you are trying to touch your elbows)
 *Alternate Press - alternate pressing each dumbell up

Circuit 5 - Back
 *Wide Row - squeeze shoulder blades together, resist going down
 *Renegades - feet together, alternate each arm - really working the back!!
 *Dumbbell Pullover - One dumbbell, drop behind head and pull up - resist against weight pulling you down

Circuit 6 - Bicep/Tricep/Shoulder
 *Close Grip Hammercurl
 *Straight Arm Kick Back - tri's are burning with this!!!
 *Arnold Press - weights together palms facing you, then open and up - great shoulder exercise

Circuit 7 - Upper Abs
 *Straight leg crunch - holding one weight
 *legs straight up in the air and crunch
 *Tall Sit-up - still using one dumbbell to help propel you up

Circuit 8 - Lower Abs
 *Reverse Crunch
 *Tummy Tucks - keep back arched while pulling knees up and out, leading with chest
 *Single Leg Jack Knife - opposite hand touches opposite toe

Circuit 9 - Obliques
 *Sumo Squats - touch elbows to knees
 *Windshield Wipers - legs at 90 degree angle, drop side to side
 *Side Planks - pop up using obliques

Stretch - a bit under 2 minutes
Knee Cross Over, pull leg into chest, sit up in straddle position - reach for each ankle to stretch hamstrings, stand up balance on one leg & bend opposite leg up to stretch quads, clasp hands in front and pull back for chest, & straight arm stretch for shoulders.

Jackie does an excellent job throughout describing proper form.  The circuits are short, but intense....if you don't feel the intensity, use heavier weights. I love this because she moves quickly, gets to the point and moves onto the next circuit - no boredom here =) My only complaints are; stretch at the end seemed too short and I wish there was one more bicep/tricep/shoulder circuit b/c arms are my trouble spot. Everything else I felt was worked adequately!

Holly Perkins is the only team member in this I recognized. It was pleasant to see her new team, the group in her first video were a bit too over the top for me.  I recommend this for all levels since it offers modifications for making it easier or harder!  Well Done.",1256083200,510,3880,4.526695526695526

4578667,5,B0055OG9PQ,if you stick with it you will definitely see results. Jackie is a crazy woman. definitely worked me out to where i was sore the next day. Love this video.,1481760000,,154,4.166666666666667
4578668,5,B0055OG9PQ,"This is a tough but doable workout, and I'm 52 and and trying to get back in a decent shape. I tried the 40 minute workout and thought I was going to die, lol. So I've been sticking to the 15 minute routines until I can build up to the longer one. I will continue with this dvd as the 15 minutes go by so fast and its not boring at all, fast paced but I can almost keep up, I have to modify a few of her moves, but I keep at it until the 15 minutes is up. I do one 15 minute session a day, abs, upper body then lower body, then I start over. Good dvd would recommend!",1477958400,,567,3.6557377049180326

4578670,5,B0055OG9PQ,"If you actually commit to this the payoff is great. Easy to follow, the workouts are a great length for me and I really look forward to doing these routines everyday. A lot of exercise DVD's have this sort of payoff, I just happened to try this one and buy it. Give it a shot, but stick to it for a few weeks.",1473552000,,309,3.9206349206349205
4578671,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I am a 47 year old female.  I consider myself an ""intermediate"" exerciser and of course, like a few of you out there, I can stand to lose around 40lbs.  I just took this DVD out to use in my rotation of workout dvd's.  Yes, this is hard & the ""get down on your knees & get back up routine"" is very difficult for me but I plugged away at my own pace.  The ab routine is also a challenge for me but so is any other ab workout.  If you are new to exercising, skip this DVD.  Use a beginner DVD.  This one I consider advanced & difficult, but if you PACE YOURSELF & DO WHAT YOU CAN DO, YOU'LL SUCCEED.  It takes modification for me to get through a few parts of this DVD.  IMO, this is great if you don't like complicated choreography & you want a challenging workout.",1472169600,,764,3.973684210526316
4578672,5,B0055OG9PQ,Great no-nonsense workout video.  Was a little disappointed that the 15min workouts are basically the same segments taken from the longer 40min workout. I was hoping they would be new routines. Overall I am very happy with this purchase,1471824000,,236,5.051282051282051
4578673,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I have two other Jackie Warner workout DVDs, and this is by far the best! I did the first circuit workout, (sweated like a cow!) and have gone back again and again to do just the abs. It has one of the best ab workouts I've ever used, and my middle is my most challenging area. You just can't go wrong with Jackie.",1470009600,,314,4.0
4578674,5,B0055OG9PQ,No easy but doable and great for my marathon cross training,1469404800,,59,4.454545454545454
4578675,5,B0055OG9PQ,"(UPDATE: FYI: When I bought this DVD a couple of years ago I only paid $10 for it on amazon prime with free shipping. I have no idea why it's gone up so much in price.)

My *favorite* exercise DVD (and I have many of them, including Beach Body dvds, Jillian Michaels dvds, other Jackie Warner dvds, etc.) The reason this one is my favorite is because the time goes by *very quickly* and- IF you put in the effort- you will FEEL IT. And if you use this dvd consistently, you WILL GET RESULTS. The format of this dvd is user friendly; Jackie gets right down to business (no annoying commercials like in Beach Body dvds.) The dvd is broken up into 5 segments. There is 15 minutes lower body, 15 minutes upper body(which is chest, back and arms), and 15 minute abs. Each segment includes the same brief warm up and cool down. There is a 40 minute total body option, which is the upper, lower, and abs segments all put together with the warm up and cool down. There is also a 15 minute total body option, which includes one exercise for each specific area, as well as the warm up and cool down. In my experience, if you are trying to start incorporating regular exercise into your lifestyle, you should never take more than one or two days off from exercise, as it is way easier to get out of the habit of exercising than it is to get into it! Even if it's just a short walk or doing some crunches, you should do something. This 15 minute total body segment can be an option for days when you are pressed for time, or just don't feel like exercising, but you're on day 1 or 2  of resting, and you don't want to get to day 2 or 3 without doing something physical to keep yourself in the habit.

Remember that you will ""feel it before you see"" (you will feel the results of your efforts before you see them, but keep using this exercise routine consistently with as much effort as you can muster, and you will see results faster than you might think. I saw results within a month.) After awhile you will have this dvd memorized, and I would suggest turning down the volume and playing whatever music motivates you while you are going through your work out. This dvd is meant is for toning, so if you are trying to lose weight, you will need to incorporate a healthy eating plan as well. If these exercises feel too difficult, just go at a slower pace, follow the modifications, and just do the best you can, but don't quit. Eventually you will feel yourself getting stronger, developing better balance, and increasing your speed. Then you can add the weights, if you're ready. As you become accustomed to the exercises, you can increase your speed and/or increase the weights to make the exercises more difficult. You can also supplement this dvd with additional exercises to further target specific areas. For instance, on leg days, when you are done with Jackie's lower body routine, you can add some additional butt exercises from Butt Bible or 30 Day Butt Lift. Or on upper body, abs or leg days, you can add some additional weight training or ab exercises from Body Beast (these are 3 other dvds that I like, but not nearly as much as I like this one!)

When I first started using this dvd, there were times when Jackie said I should be feeling the burn, and I wasn't. Then I realized I was not keeping pace with her, and once I sped up, I noticed the difference. I was burning and sweating like I hadn't been before. I also realized that I needed to go deeper on my squats and lunges to get the burn that Jackie was referring to, but at first my main focus was to concentrate on learning how to do the exercises with the proper form and finish in the time allotted. Once I had this down, I went deeper and increased my speed, and the burn came- big time! Also, during the crunches in the abs section, I modified by supporting my head with my hands instead of using the weight so as to reduce the strain on my neck, and I do not believe that it reduced the effectiveness of the exercise at all; I could still feel and see results!

I rarely ever do the 40 minute total body segment because I do not like to exercise for more than 30 minutes at a time. I usually follow one of 2 schedules: lower body on day 1, then upper body and abs on day 2, with a rest day on the 3rd day if needed (then repeat.) Or lower body on day 1, then upper body on day 2, then abs on day 3 (then repeat.) Sometimes I do the 15 minute total body segment, which is like the Cliffs Notes version of the 40 minute total body. I usually add some extra glute exercises on lower body day, and extra ab exercises on ab day, because it's summer and I have several beach trips planned! You can also repeat the segment again for extra sweat and burn, if needed.  I rarely go over 30 minutes a day, and the time goes by so quickly with this dvd, which is why I've been able to maintain a regular exercise schedule (since I am not a fan of exercise and would much rather be curled up on my couch with a glass of wine and a good movie!)

So if you don't like spending a lot of time exercising, but want to tone up and you're willing to put in the effort to do so, then this is the dvd for you.  (FYI: I am a 46 year old female, 5'4"", 120 lbs.)",1467072000,3,5205,4.213640922768305

This didn't seem to hard during the workout and it goes by fast but man 2 days later and I'm still sore.  There isn't much cardio but that's exactly what I wanted for my non running days.

4578682,5,B0055OG9PQ,"All-time favorite workout video and I HATE WORKING OUT !  This is the 3rd DVD I have purchased over the years of Jackie's and it is comprehensive, easy and grueling all at the same time.  Nothing is too hard and the exercises are designed to minimize injury (which I need because I shattered my leg two years ago) but MAN am I sore the days following !  She kicks your ass without you even knowing.  She is my favorite trainer, hands down.",1461283200,,439,4.317073170731708
4578683,4,B0055OG9PQ,"I like this DVD and use it frequently, but at my own pace. I like to lift heavier and her pace and transition is just too fast for lifting more than a few pounds safely. Her instruction on form could also be more in depth, especially if you are just getting started lifting weights. The warm up is OK, but her cool down is completely lacking. I skip it entirely and use Laura Hudson's 10 Minute Yoga, Relaxation & Flexibility segment instead. All that being said, I still enjoy this DVD, especially the lower body segment and the 15 Minute Total Body for days when I'm in a hurry but want more than just a stretch.",1460764800,,614,4.301724137931035
4578684,4,B0055OG9PQ,"I wanted to give this at least a month before posting a review. I like that the 40 minute workout goes by fast. I like that there isn't any jumping. I love the 15 minute workout, although, it's really not quite long enough. I like Jackie and overall it's a good DVD. I wish both the warm-up and the cool-down were about 1 minute longer.

After a month of using this 3 times per week (it's all I ever do for workout videos), I definitely feel/look more toned, but I haven't lost any weight. While I know the speed and intensity of the circuits provide some cardio, I don't think it's quite enough for me. I've been a little out of breath at times, but not as out of breath as I think I should be with a workout video. I also rarely broke a sweat which was a red flag to me that I probably wouldn't lose much weight. I don't think my dumbells were too light either, so I don't think that was the problem.

So, for the next month I'm going to use another one of my DVDs and try to knock off about 5 lbs., then go back to this for some more toning.

I would recommend this video, I just wish it was a little more cardio heavy (and I hate jumping and most cardio exercises, but I know that's what I need).",1459641600,,1200,4.033613445378151
4578685,5,B0055OG9PQ,"This video is really great for someone with a basic fitness base.  I wouldn't recommend it for beginners as she doesn't spend a lot of time covering proper form, though she does remind you throughout that your form is paramount.  If I were a beginner I wouldn't feel certain I had proper form.  Other than that, it's a great addition to regular workouts as a quick but not super challenging resistance training session.  Add in 5 minutes of jump rope, jumping jacks, or some other easy cardio between strength circuits and it's all you need.

What I like most about the video is JACKIE.  I've tried a ton of workout videos and I can't stand the cheerleader (pop sugar) or drill sergeant (jillian) style of trainer.  I watch those videos thoroughly once and mute them all subsequent times.  But Jackie is not annoying.  She's encouraging without being too perky or too angry and that's exactly what I've been looking for.",1459209600,,920,4.7

In 15 minutes I feel like I've done something, but I'll generally do two of the 15 minute circuits or time on the treadmill or elliptical to make it a full workout.  I get bored easily with exercise DVD's but I don't think I will with this.  It targets different areas and it makes me think about the muscle groups while going through the training.  Very happy with the purchase and a good addition to my library of exercise DVD's.",1455062400,,527,4.4375

4578690,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I would give her 10 stars if I could.  I was doing Cardio (tredmill) alone for years with a couple of my own add ins for toning (push ups &  squats). Yes first few times it is a challenge but once you do it regularly, at least twice a week,  you get used to the fast pace. Results are unbelievable and you feel toned and in shape. I can do this everyday and still feel the post workout aches (which  I love).  Heads up for women, if you're looking to tone this is the dvd,  just use light weights for toning (more for muscles) , I use 5lbs for arm/upper and 11lbs for back workout.

4578697,5,B0055OG9PQ,"Wow!  I LOVE this DVD!  I have exercised on a regular basis for many years, so I guess I am pretty fit--but definitely NOT athletically gifted, nor coordinated. (I tend to shy away from new workouts that might make me feel like a clumsy oaf, sticking instead to ones that are so familiar I recite the trainer's instructions along with the DVD.)  I am also a mother of five and a full-time teacher, so I look for workouts that are efficient, fun, and can be modified to my needs.  Before trying this, I probably would have said that Jillian Michaels' ""No More Trouble Zones"" was my favorite toning workout...it was challenging (almost too challenging if I hadn't done it in a while) fast-paced, and worked the whole body.  Here is why I like Jackie's Power Training Circuit:
1.  It is fast-paced, yet do-able.  I have a hard time with complicated moves that require an athlete's coordination, but all of Jackie's exercises are easy to follow.  She gives good instructions on form, but she really keeps things moving.  I am still surprised at how fast the 40 minute workout goes.
2.  It is easy to modify.  I have dumbbells ranging from 3 lbs to 10 lbs, and was quickly able to figure out which ones would be most appropriate for me to use for the various moves.  You wouldn't have to have more than one set of dumbbells, of course, but the workout is easily modified and customized if you do.  Jackie makes it easy to know how and where to push myself a little more--as well as back off if I need to. I don't think I will ""outgrow"" this workout since I can simply use heavier weights if something starts to feel too easy.
3.  It is a whole body workout--quads, glutes, hamstrings, back, shoulders, arms, abs--she covers it all.  And you definitely feel it.  Everywhere.
4. Great options if you only have a little time - With a busy family, there are some mornings that I don't have time for even a 30 minute workout.  This DVD includes a 15 minute total body workout, so I no longer have an excuse!  On the other hand, I love being able to really work my body, and be finished in 40 minutes (unlike ""No More Trouble Zones"" which says it is a 40 minute circuit--but really takes over 50 minutes)
5.  It's fun! As someone who would much rather read my kindle as I workout on the elliptical, it means a lot that I actually look forward to this workout.  Many of the exercises were familiar to me, but some were new.  Even the moves that are not my favorite (and Jackie acknowledges that we all have those we love--and hate) are over in a minute!

This is my first Jackie Warner DVD, but I doubt it will be my last.  I love how effective--yet accessible--this workout is!!",1439337600,,2667,4.420081967213115

4578716,4,B0055OG9PQ,"I must say having done Jillian and Bob Harper, this workout in my opinion is a little easier. This is not to say that you won't sweat and feel ""the burn"" the next day, it's just not as intense. I really enjoyed it and would recommend. It also came with a 5 day meal plan which seems very easy without too much prep work involved.",1428969600,2,329,4.076923076923077
4578717,2,B0055OG9PQ,I don't really like Jackie.  I think her routine moves to fast and isn't safe.  It is to much neck jarring. I prefer Harley Pasternak.  I also don't like her personal character after researching her more. She insulted Jamie Eason at one point about breast implants without knowing she was a breast cancer survivor.  Jamie Eason is now a fitness model and amazing role model.,1428105600,,374,4.707692307692308
4578718,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I wasn't sure about this DVD, so I checked it out from the public library before purchasing it.  After about the first 20 minutes, I realized it wasn't what I thought it was going to be, but I kept at it.  That day I told my husband I wasn't interested in it.  The next day I was really sore and started to think more about it.  The third day I was still really sore and completely sold on this.  I have no doubt that this will get you into shape.

First, let me tell you what this is and what this isn't.  This isn't a cardio workout.  This is a circuit weight workout.  Your heart rate will go up just a little during some parts of the workout, but if you are looking for a super-intense weight workout that gets your heart really pumping, this is not what you are looking for.  For reference, I'm 33, female, and weight 135.  My heart rate got up into the high 140s during some of the lower body circuit, but it stayed in the low 130s/high 120s during most of the workout.  Even lower during Abs.  According to my Garmin Heart Rate Monitor, I burned 200 calories during the 40-minute workout.  While that's not necessarily accurate, it's great for comparing to other workouts.  For comparison, I've done Bob Harper's Total Trainer Plus DVD (I believe you can only purchase this in a set at Target) - the first workout - and I burn 230 calories in just 25 minutes.  But these are two completely different types of workouts with two different goals.

However, if you are looking to get a really great weight training workout in very little time, this is a winner.  I would say you are getting the equivalent of an hour long weight workout in just 40 minutes.  If you challenge yourself, you will be sore.  I can see this being a really great workout that I am adding to my weekly rotation for the next month or so.

This is how the workout goes: She does three sets of circuits for lower body, upper body, and then core/abs.  Each set includes three exercises aimed at one specific muscle group that you do for one minute each followed by a minute of all three (20 seconds each).  So each set is 4 minutes.  Then you take a really short break and go on to the next set.  She starts with lower body and ends with abs.  You can also do a 15-minute workout that focuses on just one body area.  The 15-minute workout includes the three sets of circuits that you do in the 40-minute workout.  I haven't done the 15-minute total body workout, yet.

I highly recommend this if you are new to weight lifting or if you are ready to change up your regular routine.  One of the greatest things about this DVD is that it only requires 2 sets of dumbbells and you could definitely get away with one set.  I used a set of 10-pounders and a set of 15-pounders.  I can see adding 20-pounders and getting rid of the 15.  I also enjoyed Jackie's style of teaching.  She is upbeat and does a great job with cues.  This is a great DVD for all fitness levels and especially for anyone looking for a challenging weight training workout.",1426723200,8,3015,4.304270462633452

The workout is upbeat and Jackie's instructions are clear and easy to follow.  I'm REALLY happy with this purchase and looking forward to doing the other tracks including the 40 minute total body.  I love that the only equipment I need is a set (or two) of hand weights and my own body.  It's also an easy workout to do with limited living room space.,1425340800,2,491,4.351648351648351

It is just 7 x 5 minute segments mixed up in different ways for the different workouts (from what I have seen). I usually do the 40 minute full-body workout, which is pretty easy on the legs, but a real struggle for my abs. I like that there's no counting of the reps, which can be annoying. The exercises are interesting and with the short amount of time spent on each (with the exception of the thousands of crunch varieties) they don't get too boring.

4578753,3,B0055OG9PQ,I am a person who hates exercise and I do very little.  I hike once a week.  I do a little walking a couple of times a week.  I did one year of martial arts and one year of yoga back in the early nineties.  As I get older and weaker I know I need to do something so I figured the 15 minute workouts would be a good start once a day.  I find that these 15 minute workouts don't necessarily seem to target one section of the body.  I was using a touch of legs on the arms workout and a touch of arms on the legs workout.  I spoke to a personal trainer who says some of the forms are old school outdated and there are better more modified ways of doing certain things.  The thing I like about the 15 minute workouts is that just when I am about to quit...it's over.  Perhaps one day I will be able to do the whole 40 minute workout without stressing.

4578793,3,B0055OG9PQ,"I enjoy circuit training because you get to move from one exercise to another quickly, which is nice when you want a fast-paced workout that has a lot of variety and doesn't get boring.  Although I was excited to try this one, once I actually did it I was pretty disappointed.  The entire workout is only 40 minutes in length, which isn't too bad considering you can get a lot done in that time when you're doing circuit training, but I felt like the exercises were not very comprehensive (they felt more like demonstrations, so by the time you finish and move on to the next cycle, you wonder ""was that it?"").  I was surprised the warm-up was less than 3 minutes long - who can adequately warm up in that short a time?  Sure, you can warm up more on your own, but when you buy a training DVD you expect it to mimic an actual workout.  Basically each cycle consists of three exercises that focus on one or more body parts (for example glutes or upper body).  Once you do the three exercises you repeat them in quick succession for a short blast.  I guess I was expecting a more advanced workout that puts more focus on each muscle group, rather than just short bursts before moving on to the next section.  One minute of legs or triceps doesn't really provide any toning benefit at all, so you end up just spiking your heart rate a little before moving on to something else.  For overall training you can really get your heart rate up when doing these short circuits, but it was nowhere near what I thought it would be.  I am much more challenged by Cathe Friedrich's workouts.  Would not recommend this one to advanced exercises, but it might be good for intermediates.",1401321600,5,1670,4.42483660130719

As I was looking for an at-home workouts I was pleasantly surprised at the sophistication and professional quality of this latest generation, particularly those by the women I sample.  I settled on a couple by Jackie Warner because of  her persistence on near-scientific testing and subtleness of her techniques.  I like this one and her DVD on the core workout as well. Many nice features, but one that is particularly useful to anyone nursing injuries is her tendency to demonstrate a modified way to do many of the exercises.

The format is really disjointed -- there are a bunch of different ""circuits"" so you can mix and match your workout or just play the whole thing, but when you play the whole thing, it takes too much time between circuits and you can tell they are distinct parts. It's also really easy if you're in decent shape -- I did not break a sweat, even using heavier weights. Her other DVDs -- Xtreme Timesaver and 30 Fast Start -- are by far the best DVDs I have ever done (even compared to Jillian Michaels and all the other populars) -- and still make me sweat.

I'm in pretty good shape, I work out 6 or 7 times a week, doing spinning, running, yoga, weights.

This workout left me shaking.  SHAKING.  I really ""felt the burn"" during the power circuit.  I had a hard time completing some of the circuits, because the ""burn"" was so intense.  I love it!! Thank you, Jackie.  I can see myself doing this DVD once a week or so.  I can also see myself being sore for the next few days.  I used 8lb and 5lb hand weights for this workout.

I like Jackie's no nonsense style.  She's not really funny, or witty...but she just gets the job done.  She got me shaking.  And I love a good burn!!",1394323200,,819,4.13375796178344

The concept of doing 3 exercise for one minute at a time then the 4th minute rotating through the exercises is wonderful  I set my watch with 1 min. intervals and just go.  I get a good sweat as well as nicely sore muscles the next day.

4578820,5,B0055OG9PQ,"The 40-min ""total body circuit"" is a great all-over workout designed around 4 min circuits.  There are 10 circuits in the 40 min workout, each featuring 3 exercises and targeting different muscle groups.  There is also a ""light"" version of the ""total body circuit"" that takes 15 min.  Also included are three addition 15-min workouts: abs only, upper body, and lower body.  I have concentrated on the 40-min workout so will comment only on that one.  You'll need hand weights--I used 3, 5, and 8 pound weights, but if you're more advanced you may want 10 or 15 pound weights.  You'll also need a mat and shoes.  Jackie concentrates on 'form, function, & fatigue"" in her workouts, and she gives pointers to the toned, fit participants as they work out.  There's one guy in the group and a couple of women who are very fit but are not sporting ""6-pack"" abs like Jackie (which is fine--not every woman wants washboard abs!).  It's a DVD that would be suitable for men as well as women.  There are some tough exercises in the mix--particularly at the very beginning of the 40-min total body circuit, including a couple I simply couldn't do at this point in my fitness journey, but most were doable though I chose lighter weights for some of the moves.  This workout is definitely a keeper and will be part of my DVD rotation, particularly on days where I want to pick up the weights.",1390608000,,1379,4.587755102040816

4578824,4,B0055OG9PQ,"I really like this work out. I like the challenge and the style, working the same area three ways then challenging yourself with Power Circuit. However, I do wish the manufacturer would consider formatting the disk so that you can skip over chapters. For example, there is a warm up at the beginning of each 15 minute segment. If you wanted to do 2 of the 15 minute segments to do a 30 minute workout instead of the 40 minute version that strings the three together, there's no easy way to skip over the warm up when you start your 2nd 15 minute circuit. Same goes for the 40 minute version. Once it starts playing, if you hit SKIP to next chapter, it goes to the ending credits. Not the next circuit or next 15 minute block. For those of us who may only have 30 minutes to spare, this would be very useful so we could do Upper/Lower or Lower/Abs or Abs/Upper in combination.",1389830400,,875,4.3090909090909095

4578828,4,B0055OG9PQ,"My wife and I do these workouts together and they're awesome.  As a recreational lifter I scoffed but decided to do the workouts with my wife anyway.  With heavy enough dumbbells and focusing on the proper muscle being worked these workouts are intense and are well put together.  The format is good, explanations of movements are ok, and warmup and cooldown are not overdone.  For a beginner start light and make it through.  For someone more experienced these are good maintenance and I think you could even bump up the weight and challenge yourself enough to build some new muscle with proper diet and rest.

There are 4, 15 minute workouts:  Upper, Lower, Full-Body, and Abs  and one 40 minute Full-Body workout.  So a person could start by doing the 15 minute full-body routine on a mon-wed-fri schedule to start, then switch to and upper-lower split to add a little more volume(mon/tues, thur/fri).  Then if things are going to be busy kick your own butt with a 40 minutes session every 3-5 days.  Very easy way to get in shape, stay in shape and even make some gains if you implement a good diet/rest strategy.",1389052800,4,1117,4.676923076923077
4578829,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I started working out because my back and hips were beginning to hurt and a friend told me it was because I was losing muscle tone and my back and hips were trying to compensate for the muscle loss. I guess it happens a lot to women as they age. I thought that working out would only make me hurt more. Boy was I wrong. At first I was so sore and in so much pain, but once my body started to get stronger the soreness from the workouts went away, and to my surprise so did my hip and back pain. I would have never believed it if it wasn't something that I personally experienced. I have Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred and LOVE it because it takes less than 30 minutes to complete a very intense workout . When I want a little long workout I use this Jackie Warner Personal Training DVD.

I purchased the DVD after talking with a women in her late 40's (I am 41). She was in such beautiful shape. She was slim and toned, not bulky. She told me that she had been using this DVD for 2 years consistently. That was all it took for me to go forward with my purchase.
I love the results I see. It took me about 7 workouts before I was able to do the whole thing through, but what an exhilarating experience. I was so sore the first week (after just one workout) that I thought I would NEVER want to do this workout again. But, I am thankful that I kept at it. Be prepared to give yourself a few days in between if you have not been working out.

I also love the old ""Firm"" DVD's. Tough Tape 2 and Standing legs are two of my favorite. I just purchased No More Trouble Zones after seeing 900+ great reviews.....unfortunately, I don't care for it. There isn't enough cardio.

If you need to get in great shape 30 Day Shred by Jillian Michaels and Personal Training with Jackie are my two favorites.",1388880000,5,1789,4.1203438395415475

4578831,4,B0055OG9PQ,"I like Jackie's DVDs. These short 15-minute workouts are good for people who want the basic but don't have a lot of time to exercise. One word of caution is with the ab workout if you have any back issues. Use your own judgement and if it hurts your back to do them--stop (the reason I gave 4 stars, not 5) . I also like Jillian's workouts and they incorporate some of the same movements with more aerobics. You sweat more with those. But Jillian's style is, let me frame this kindly, more abrasive than Jackie's. I think a good idea is, for example, to do her 15-minute upper body workout and then supplement with some of your own exercises. In 30 minutes you'll be worked out.",1388793600,,678,4.346456692913386

There are 4 different workouts and I like that there are different lengths of time to select from, as well as different muscle groups. You can tailor the amount of weight you use to your own fitness level and the workout definitely has a good cardio element.  I did the 15 minute total body workout last night and can say two things........First, it is a TRUE 15 minutes. From warmup to cool down, it was exactly 15 minutes. Second, my lower body is slightly sore today and I workout 3 times a week --So I am not a beginner and consider myself to be in pretty good shape. For me that signals the DVD hit muscles in a combination and intensity I have not been using, and that is a good thing!

I learned about this video from other reviewers on amazon.com, and was concerned that it would be too Dance-y or ""girly"". It is not! I will probably even see good results.

- Excellant Workout - I was totally exausted when I was done.  Every part of my body was sore.
- Fune excercises that you don't normally see
- Fairly easy to follow

Cons

- Starts new excercises quickly.  I have difficlulty gettig into position and getting the appropriate weights before Jackie is already going.  I have to pause the dvd.  This should improve as I learn the routine better.
- Poor chapter markers.  When I want to toggle through to a different segent, I have to use the fast forward/rewied because there are very few chapters marked on the dvd.

I did this workout last night for the first time and I am seriously feeling it today! the quad workout is crazy and I had some definite soreness while climbing the stairs or sitting and standing ( which is good! ). The DVD goes by pretty quick because you work all the muscle groups. The power burn is awesome! You need to have weights, one pair of lighter weight and one pair of heavier ones.",1385510400,,398,4.25
4578842,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I've worked out to a variety of at home exercise DVDs: Jackie, P90X, Supreme, Jillian Michaels, and Bob Harper. I've just recently discovered Jackie and I think she's the dark horse of the great trainers, especially compared with Jillian's excessive self promotion. Her workouts are short and intense and the exercises aren't the same old boring squats and lunges I've seen in so many other videos. This video is really nice because you can make a short workout or a long workout using a variety of customizable options. I also really enjoy the fact that her warm ups aren't that long (3 minutes). Long warm ups are just a waste of time, IMO. My one complaint with this video is I think the ab routine could use improvement. It is a little too short with too few exercises. I still like the DVD, though, and it has become part of my regular rotation.",1385510400,,850,4.562091503267974
4578843,5,B0055OG9PQ,"Working out with Jackie is a great way to get and stay fit. This is my favorite DVD. I am 63 and on a mission to get strong, lean, and fit. Since May I've lost 22 pounds and 3% body fat. I work out 5-6 times each week and this DVD is in the rotation at least twice a week. Love that I am drenched in sweat when I'm done. Have three other Jackie DVDs, along with two by Bob Harper---and MANY more that are mostly out of the rotation because they don't make me sweat. Used to do 30 Day Shred with Jillian, but I just don't sweat as much and am not a fan of her style. Also do about 70 minutes of Yoga once each week. My philosophy is: ""No sweat? Why bother?""

If you do this DVD regularly, you will see results.",1384905600,2,709,3.856164383561644
4578844,5,B0055OG9PQ,"This is a great workout!  I started my weight loss journey out with Jillian Michael's 30 days shred and lost some pounds and inches and toned up.  Then I moved on to this DVD. It's 40 minutes instead of 20 and it's more strength based than cardio.

I have lost lots more inches and weight! I went from 5 lb dumbbells to 10 lb and now I'm incorporating 15 lb weights when I can (squats, deadlifts, rows). I just keep getting smaller (not bulky).

The best part is the 20 minute abs workout.  If you are looking for a killer abs workout that isn't just crunches, this is awesome!  I like Jackie's encouragement, honesty, and humor.  There is also a section on upper body and lower body.  You can do the whole workout, or pick out of the 3 parts.  Big fan!",1382140800,,449,4.151162790697675

I bought this hoping for a circuit/boot camp style video.  It does not disappoint!  It is shorter than the Jillian videos which was a nice change (only by about 10 minutes if you don't do the stretching at the end on either video).  The major differences between a typical Jillian work out and this video is that Jackie allows you to work with heavier weights because you are only focusing on one area at a time.  Rather than doing leg lifts and flys, you are only doing flys, so you can focus only on your chest and use heavier weights.  I plan to alternate this and the Jillian videos just to keep things fresh.  I have worked out for years and after doing this video the first time I was sore, very sore, for about 4 days, from using heavier weights than I was used to.  I'm only giving it four stars because I think it would be easy to fall into a routine and not challenge yourself but it definitely works up a sweat if you are challenging yourself!",1379808000,2,1081,4.239024390243903

I used to be more of a BeachBody DVDs fun (Chalene Johnson's Turbo Fire Drills, Insanity by Shane T, & P90X by Tony Horton) but I was looking for a change and I found it with Jackie's programs.

4578853,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I bought this DVD to bring a weight training method to my cardio workouts.  I love the circuit workouts in this DVD and how the video is divided up into specific body sections-brilliant!  Not only do you get strength training but, you get a cardio workout too.  I switch from running on the treadmill one day to Jackie's upperbody and abs the next day, then treadmill again the next day, then lower body and abs the next day, then treadmill the next.  Do this 6 days a week and you will notice great results in 2 months.  My wife keeps telling me how good I look now and she is starting to use the DVD now too!  I am not afraid to look at myself nude anymore either!!!

One good thing about this DVD and Jackie, she isn't arragant or ""too manly"" acting in the videos.  She is a straight forward trainer and brings her life training experiences to the video.  You can tell she has real world experience and the results I am seeing are proof.

You have 4 -15 minute workouts that concentrate just on one muscle group or you can do the 40 minute which works you whole body.  Either way you will sweat and get a great endurance and cardio workout.",1378166400,,321,4.213114754098361

Through a series of circuits that target a particular muscle group, she ensures a good overall toning workout. If you are an advanced exerciser- then this is the workout for the days you aren't extremely energetic. Despite what she says, you cant use this as a calorie scorcher. My caloric count for the whole 40 minute circuit was just 215 calories. On the other hand for Jillian Michaels comparable cicuit (NMTZ) it was 430. So thats just half. The good thing however is that her form is very good and you probably will come back to this workout often just because it isn't as intense.",1377648000,,684,4.614754098360656

4578860,4,B0055OG9PQ,"I love doing full-body workouts so I did all the exercises on this DVD one after the other. Each circuit is four minutes. First you do one minute of each exercise for a specific body part then you do twenty seconds of each exercise a little faster during the last minute. So really you are doing three minutes of individual exercises then you put them all together during the last minute. There is not very much time to recover between exercises. That makes this a very fast-paced routine. The goal is to work your muscles to a point of fatigue.

If you do the entire workout you start with a very quick warm up and proceed to quads, gluts, chest, back, shoulders, biceps, triceps, upper abs, lower abs and obliques. This takes 40 minutes.

The longer I exercised the more I felt the burn. However I did not always feel the burn when Jackie told me I would. Some exercises would have to be done for a little longer to feel a burn. But overall this is a great workout and you will probably want to take a day off after completing the 40 minutes.

If you have less time you can do a fifteen minute workout for the total body or just abs, lower body and upper body. Either way you are going to get an intense workout.

4578870,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I debated 5 vs. 4 stars.  I'm giving it 5 stars because this workout works perfectly for what I need it to do -- a fairly quick morning resistance/weight training workout that I can squeeze in before I go to work a couple of mornings per week.  I don't love doing it, but maybe that's just because I don't love weight training in general like I love Zumba or Yoga or Barre workouts.
What I also like is that this workout appears to be effective for me.  I'm up to 8 pound weights already after starting with 4 and 5 lbs -- I'm a 120 lb middle-aged woman and this DVD makes you do lots of reps of some traditional weight lifting moves, so I feel that 8 lbs is pretty darned good.  And I am even thinking about buying heavier dumbbells for the deadlifts, sissy squats, sumo squats, and shoulder presses.  I look more defined, without a doubt.  So it's working for me.  I just don't love weight workouts as much as cardio workouts or workouts that involve the great outdoors.  But this is effective, and if you hate one element (the side lunges are my dislike), well, you get to move on to the next one soon enough.",1372896000,2,1112,4.261904761904762

There is also little to no discussion of how to choose a proper weight, and the transitions between exercises are, again, too fast.

Also like that you can choose between the 40-minute full body workout, short 15-minute full body workout and three separate 15-minute workouts (upper body, lower body and abs; which if you do them all makes a full body workout).

And not section everything by adding a cut screen.  It slows the workout down.",1366243200,,419,4.358974358974359
4578889,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I love the format of this workout.. A short summary of the three moves coming up and the muscle group you'll be working comes up, then you do one minute of each move. Then comes the power burn - all three moves repeated for 20 seconds each. The power burns really burn. Jackie Warner is a great trainer who does a good job giving pointers on form, and her chit chat is minimal. The format really makes the time go by, and I usually do the whole-body 40 minute workout. The shorter 15-minute workouts are the same as the 40 minute version, but if you want to do just two of them (lower body and abs, for instance) the warmup repeats. I just fastforward to the  handy screen that shows what moves are coming up.

I love the background exercisers, who aren't dressed in crazy outfits and who aren't intimidatingly gorgeous like the ones in Jackie's One-on-One Training DVD. The ones on the Power Circuit Training video look like regular people who are fit and who work out regularly.

However, the 15 min individual workouts leave me feeling cheated: they each contain (the same) 2min warm-up, as well as (the same) 3min stretch. So actually, you're only getting 11-12mins of workout (since they each last 17-18mins rather than the 15). I know it's only a couple of minutes, but that's quite a lot when you only have 15.

I have to skip two of the leg segments because one of my knees gives me problems when I do squats and lunges, but that's ok with me because my main focus is my arms and abs, and those segments definitely deliver. I workout regularly with weights, but the day after I did this workout for the first time my arms, shoulders and abs were really feeling it. This morning I did the workout for the second time and I was cursing Jackie by the end (in a good way). I'm sure I'll be feeling this tomorrow. One thing I love is that many of the exercises (even the ab exercises) use weights so you can adjust the intensity by using heavier or lighter weights. On some of the exercises I could use 7lb weights, with others I could only use 3lbs, so I know there is room for me to get stronger.

4578893,4,B0055OG9PQ,"I am an intermediate exerciser and have been working out mostly to Jillian Michaels videos. My favourites of hers are No More Trouble Zones and Banish Fat Boost Metabolism.

I like Jackie Warner as an instructor better than Jillian because she is straightforward and is not ""performing"" for the camera or engaging in tons of annoying banter with her models, which is often hard for me to get past with Jillian videos (and why I stick to the same few ones that I like of hers). She is encouraging without being cheerleaderish (ie. Denise Austin, who is just way too cheesy for words.)

I would like this video better if it had cardio segments mixed in between the weight training circuits. That would immediately make it comparable to Jillian's workouts. I realize I could stop the vid and then work in 1-2 mins myself, but that's a pain so that's part of why this video receives 4 stars from me.

This 40 minute workout is the right length of time for me. I didn't find that I sweated tons or had a really elevated heart rate like with all of Jillian's videos, but I did find my muscles fatigued by the end of each circuit and I do find I am sore from the video, and I will simply increase my weights as I cease to be sore. Jackie concentrates one 3-exercise circuit on each of the following muscle groups: quads, hamstrings, glutes, chest, back, arms, upper abs, lower abs, obliques. I like the approach a lot because it does tend to fatigue those muscles by supersetting them, instead of spreading it around like Jillian Michaels. I found the following cons with this workout:
 -arms are all one circuit, with one exercise for each of biceps, triceps, shoulders. I would have liked to see individual sets for each of those muscle groups instead of combining them
 -the second round of each set (which Jackie calls ""Power Burn"" has fewer reps than the first go round, so I don't really know why it's called a power burn, because it's less exercise than the first set. She should just repeat the first set of each and have long sets, and you'd get a better workout)
 -I really liked the fact that she separated the major muscle groups of the legs and had a separate circuit for each. And similarly, she separates the three parts of the abs and has a separate one for each. I think if one was looking for something super short to do on non-workout days, one could do the abs segments.
 -there is nothing in this video that hurts my knees, wrists or shoulders. I find this a problem in some videos where there is over-extension in the squat/lunge or a lot of planking
 -sometimes the cadence of the exercises is quite fast, and this will become more of a problem as I increase my weights

With these reservations, I did like this video quite a bit and because of it, I'd like to check out some other vids by Jackie. I will be happy to add this to my rotation, especially on days where I might not have the energy for a Jillian video.",1365465600,,2931,4.443202979515829

4578896,4,B0055OG9PQ,I've heard great things about Jackie's workout DVDs. I found success with Jillian Michaels circuit training but I wanted to try something new so I can learn how to switch up my workouts so they don't become so mundane. I like Jacie as a trainer as well as how she 'coaches' you through the moves. She moves at an awesome pace and I like the team of people she uses to film the videos. I've seen changes in my leg strength and abs the most which I like. My only complaint is that even though each circuit is supposed to be timed exactly the same; it doesn't always feel that way. Some of the circuits seem shorter than others so at the end of each one I feel like I didn't work on it as much as I should or could have done.,1364774400,,722,4.055944055944056
4578897,4,B0055OG9PQ,"Have another Jackie Warner video, so obviously, I am a fan.  This workout is structured to give you concentrated focus  on particular areas within one 40 minute workout (lower abs, upper abs, glutes, back, legs, chest & arms) Slong with some limited cardio.  The instruction is mediocre frankly - so you really, really should watch this one all the way through before you do it the first time or bad form habits may easily develop - I have probably done this DVD 20 times and I still find myself realizing I have been off on my form during previous sessions.

All that said, this is an invigorating, well organized routine.  I feel the burn as I work.  You begin by working the larger muscle groups and then hone in on the usual problem areas.  Just when I think I will have to stop and take a breather, Jackie moves you on to the next exercise.  I exercise regularly doing Bob Harper, using a StairMaster, a stationary bike, Jillian Michaels workouts - this is one of my less exhausting (no intense cardio) routines.

Good toning, muscle defining routine - for your off-cardio rotation day I would highly recommend it.",1364688000,,1119,4.611111111111111

This workout was just what I needed! I've only done the 40 minute whole body workout and wow did it fly right by! Each circuit consists of 3 moves for one minute each, and then the last minute is a 'power burn' in which you perform all three moves on top of each other with no rest. Each circuit works one specific part of the body. What I love about this is there are very little classic cardio moves (save for some jumping jacks in the warm-up), yet it still produces a cardio effect while toning muscle. While I have not completed them yet, there are also shorter workouts for when you're in a time crunch - each are 15 minutes long and include one for the total body, abs only, lower body, and upper body.

4578902,5,B0055OG9PQ,"Up till I rented this DVD, my only exposure to DVD workouts had been via late-night infomercials featuring uber-buff people, and that didn't seem particularly appealing. I don't have a gym membership, up till now I didn't even work out regularly but I really wanted to start because it was a New Years resolution and I'll be darned if I don't keep at least one resolution. Anyway. I'd seen some Jackie Warner workout video stuff on a fitness website and she seemed likeable enough, and I liked the way she talked the viewer through the exercises, so I got this DVD. No regrets! Loved it! Watching it, the exercises don't seem too intense, and they're not, really, but they definitely leave you sore the next day. Which is perfect. Easy exercises with good impact.

HOWEVER. It would have been really nice if the DVD had been better made, in terms of chapters. Sometimes I'd like to skip through a particular set of exercises (like maybe skip shoulders and do triceps instead or something) (why would I skip shoulders) and it would just go straight to the end credits. Sort of annoying. Not really a big deal. Just nitpicking.

I have lost 5 pounds so far working out to Jillian Michaels BFBM, NMTZ, Shred, and RI30.  I also rotate Results Fitness: 10 Days to a Better Body and this DVD. This DVD gives you a good workout overall.  It is not as hard as Jillian Michaels but it has 3 killer abs circuits. After doing this DVD 4 times, I still fatigue on the tummy tuck and tricep kickback exercises. You will break a sweat from the repetitions but it is a toning workout, not a cardio one. Also, I do not find the fat burn exercises at the end of each circuit very challenging as the repetitions are less on these. I feel good after doing this workout though and will continue to rotate this with my other DVD's. I may increase the intensity by adding more weights as I get stronger.

When I started this video I had already lost 20 lbs and was doing cardio 4-5 x week. So somewhere between beginner and novice.  The exercises are basic, and only change every 30 - 60 seconds so no trouble following along.  There are 5 options.  Upper body (20 min) Lower Body (20 min) Abs (20 min) total body (40 min)  and express total body (20 min)  At first I was doing the 40 minute total body 2 x / week but it felt too intense to me and I was sore for days afterwards.  Now I'm doing segments -  Upper body Day 1 - Lower Body day 2 - Abs Day 3.  To be honest the segments did not feel like enough exercise daily (at least to create calorie defecit I need to lose weight)  So now after each segment I walk briskly x 30 minutes. I definitely feel my body changing rapidly with each week that goes by. I would say the ABS portion of the video is the most intense followed by the upper body and finally the lower body.  I really like this video because it is quick, effective, I can do a little each day and it integrates well with my cardio routine.

Jackie is great as an instructor, always focusing on proper form and offering modified versions of some of the moves. She is a little silly sometimes, but it is refreshing to hear her trying to make a joke and miserably failing.

The arm exercises, in particular, are severely lacking. My biggest issue, though, is that this workout is NOT for those who still have remnants of injuries--most especially lower back--or who prefer to lift heavy.

In just a short time, I have progressed up in the weights I am using and am beginning to see definition in my shoulders and legs. I like the way she leads the video. Since it is broken into sections it seems to go by very quickly.

Update: Sometimes it is hard to tell how much you are going to like an exercise video when you first get it. I have many, and I like variety, but this has become my favorite ""go-to"" video. It is just the right length and gets you a good workout on arms, legs, and core. My legs are way more muscular now, my arms are stronger, and my shoulders and delts have shown a huge difference. I am starting to see the outline of my abs, even. A few of my girlfriends were planning on taking a strength training class (they only went to one, ha!), and I just told them that I'm good in that area--I have my Jackie videos.

She is very good at leading you through the exercises. Each exercise is one minute (you do 3 different moves for one minute each), then you do the ""power burn"" where you do each exercise for 20 seconds. It goes by quickly. Expect delayed muscle soreness for the first week, but then you will be able to go up in the weights you use rather quickly. I've actually doubled the weights I use since I started. I usually finish the video and then jump rope for 20 minutes to get in some cardio/fat burning. My clothes are looser and I feel more confident and much stronger.",1354406400,,1515,4.167235494880546

So I will still keep it in my rotation as it adds a little more variety to my workouts. Also, she is less demanding and rough which is Jillian's style.

4578939,4,B0055OG9PQ,"I shall preface this by saying that I'm one of those people who's been really lucky to maintain the same petite size and weight for more than a decade despite being extremely lazy.  That said, after some sporadic attempts to develop a healthier lifestyle, I have begun working out regularly because it makes me feel sooo much better (post-workout soreness > couch-potato achiness), I want to be stronger, and having some muscle definition certainly wouldn't hurt. I decided to try Jackie Warner because I read such great reviews, 15-minute workouts seemed doable, and frankly, I was less scared of her than Jillian Michaels.  And I LOVE this workout.  I love the interval style (she's pretty much converted me from anything else), I love that it gets my heart rate up WITHOUT jumping around (yay, no-impact cardio!), I love that before each interval set the screen tells you what exercises you will be doing, I love that she works every single muscle in every body part (it's so thorough!), I love that you just push and push with each move for a solid minute because it's ONLY a minute (so you've got this!), I love that it's mix-and-match, and I love that all you have to do to make it harder as you get stronger is to add more weights (and watch your form, of course). You get out of it what you put into it.  I also really enjoy Jackie's personality--calm, steady voice, but energetic and encouraging.

I tried these workouts out for the first time this past summer.  The first time I did her lower body workout, I could barely walk for the next couple of days.  The first time I did her upper body workout, my arms were total noodles--I couldn't even use them to push myself off the floor (which made for an interesting cortortioning experiment to make it into the shower). The abs you will definitely feel the next day as well (I'm feeling them right now, in fact). Amazingly, though, my body adjusted after just that one workout and I'm currently using it to supplement another workout program, and I've even increased my weights twice.  Go me!

My only complaints are that (1) the UFC's (which are TOUGH!) only go in one direction.  It seems to me like there should be a reversal of which leg you start on to even out the muscles used.  I've tried switching directions in the middle myself, and that has not gone well.  (Clumsy, meet fast-paced.)(2) The first time I attempted the entire workout, I was unable to do a lot of the upper body stuff without some major adjustments (like sitting instead of standing) because I had already exhausted my lower body.  It seemed like maybe the workout should have started with the upper body, since those muscles aren't used in the lower body workout.  (3)  I would have liked to see some variation in stretches customized to the 15-minute workouts, instead of the exact same warm-up and cool-down regardless of body part focused on.  (And as others have mentioned, definitely take more time on the stretches and add in a few of your own--she's squeezing a lot into a little time, which I appreciate--just be sure to take care of yourself).

I'm super-glad I got this workout and am adding to my Jackie collection (even as I'm getting over my fear of Jillian).  Highly, highly recommend!",1351036800,,3236,4.6572934973637965
4578940,4,B0055OG9PQ,"I found this in my closet, unopened, I have no idea how long it's been there! I've been working out 5 days a week, tae bo, P90, Chris Freytag. I've been doing cardio, circuit training and weights - this DVD was a challenge for me. I agree with the other poster who said that the reps are fast and it's hard to keep form. You have to be very careful you don't hurt your back(I have a weak back and I have to pay attention) when you do fast reps. Concentrate on what your doing and you'll be ok. However, if you aren't up to this level of a workout, like I am not yet, then it's hard to keep your form because you simply do not have the strength. I found myself swinging my weights vs. actually moving them. In some of the ab moves, I had to support my hips, or I found myself jerking into position. Not good. I caught myself, but I realized that this workout is for a more advanced exerciser.  I'll get there eventually, but it's not my favorite simply because I'm not strong enough yet.

Its actually an excellent workout for folks who have had some higher level of circuit training before. You'll feel the burn, it goes by EXTREMELY fast and the moves are simple enough. I look forward to working up to this level of fitness :) This is NOT for beginners though.

I'd say if you've had about 6 months circuit training with weights, this DVD would be great for you.  Anything less than that and you may not be up for the challenge or have the strength to execute the moves without hurting yourself. But.. you will if you keep trying it! I plan to revisit this DVD in another couple of weeks and see how I've progressed! :)",1350950400,,1621,4.219354838709678

Today was the first day I tried it and I did the 40 minute routine.  I found that the pace was too fast, not because I'm out of shape (I work out 6 times a week and have been consistent with that for the past four years - I also run and hike 14ers) but because it was hard to keep proper form and complete the movements.  I did break a sweat which is always a good thing to me.  I was feeling the burn on a couple of the segments, but overall, I really didn't feel like I got the workout I wanted.  I'll try doing this a couple of days a week for the next month and see how I feel about it after I'm done and before I switch to a new DVD.  I'll add that I found that The Firm Bootcamp - Maximum Calorie Burn, was a better overall circuit training workout.",1347408000,,926,3.946236559139785

She is tough like Jillian Michaels and very motivating! She encourages you to keep going when you feel like giving up! And with the use of dumbbells you never outgrow it because you can just up the weight! She has different twists on traditional moves - I love that! The only downside is that her body looks like a man, not inspiring to me at all! To each their own! But I really liked the workout!",1342051200,,535,4.36

Really hate wasting time writing stuff down...or spending 20 mins warming up.  This is a good quick all over workout. Use a bench to do chest part, not floor for a better workout.  It does go quite fast, so be sure to keep remote handy to pause to ready yourself for next cycle.",1341878400,,454,4.244186046511628

 I like Jackie as an instructor, her manner is good and the workout is fine.
I think this would be good for beginners to weights but the pacing is a bit fast for beginners.

The exercises are simple but the transitions are quick and the reps are a bit fast for people who might be uncertain of form. So I'm not sure who the target audience is.

I would recommend it for : beginners - but watch it through first once and practice the exercises slowly first to get your form, and then get it up to speed.

I do like the abs section - it's more thorough than the upper or lower body sections in my opinion.",1341187200,2,804,4.128205128205129

I would consider myself in good condition (above average) and I feel it today. PROS: Using weights, you can really adjust based on your fitness level. It's a high rep workout, so I ended up using lighter weight than I normally would for typcial weight training. It includes 15 minute ""mini workouts."" 15 mintues will not get you ripped, but on a really busy day, 15 tough minutes is better than nothing. She does a lot of combination moves, so you get the stabilizers and secondary muscles involved. CONS: there isn't much instruction. If you are not already familiar with the techniques, you might not do them correctly, which can lessen the workout and lead to injury. Also, Jackie is not as motivating as other trainers who have DVDs. If you want a good workout and know the basics, this is pretty good.",1340236800,,914,4.613496932515337

4578957,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I am a big P90X fan and was looking for an alternative that would still give me a total body workout, but in less time.  I bought the Power Circuit Training DVD and the Extreme Time Saver DVD and love both of them.  I alternate between the two, along with my faves from P90 and I run.  PCT is great as it focuses on one muscle group at a time and the power burners rock.  It's about 40 mins.  ETS seems more intense to me (I sweat more) as you work arms and legs at the same time and it's 30 mins.  What I also love is that her warm ups and cool downs are short.  Still good but short.  I want to get to the workout, not do 15 mins of warming up and stretching.  She's also quite pleasant and normal (i.e. she's not annoying).  The pace of both workouts is fast so you have to keep up.  This P90 girl is now hooked on Jackie's shorter but still killer workouts.",1338940800,2,861,3.947674418604651

The ab circuit alone is worth the $7, I assure you.  All the circuits are broken out so you can select from the menu what you want.  I like this feature because primarily I'm a runner and sometimes I need a good, dense 20 minute strength workout after some of my shorter runs so with this I can choose what I feel like doing that day.  The other part I really like, which makes it a little more challenging, is that she doesn't bs around, she moves quick to the next move.",1338768000,,644,4.153225806451613

To be fair, I only did the 40 minute total body workout and have not tried the other workouts. I used 8 pound weights as my heavy set and 5 pound weights as my light set since there are so many reps involved. I did think the workout was difficult and a few times I wasn't able to complete all the reps. However, at the end of the workout I hadn't really sweat that much. According to my HRM, I only burned 133 calories. I did feel a bit sore the next day so I know it did something, but I'm still a bit disappointed in the calorie burn in this. If I remember correctly, the Xtreme Time Saver DVD burned around 230-250 calories in just 30 minutes and still used weights.

So was this DVD a waste of time? Absolutely not, but it wasn't exactly what I was looking for either. I will try combining some of the other 15 minute workouts on this DVD and update this review later.",1338768000,,974,4.046632124352332
4578960,5,B0055OG9PQ,"Just before Lent this year,I decided to ""up my game""
with my diet and exercise routines. Tossing out processed
and high sodium foods was easy; since I'm vegetarian I
didn't feel deprived.
But I was stuck in a rut with my workouts,so I looked into this
power circuit training DVD. I'd read an article on Jackie Warner
a while back,but never saw her TV show. I bought this just from
Amazon reviews,and I'm glad I did!
 To say this kicked my butt is a major understatement.
I'm an over 50 intermediate exerciser who used to power lift
in my 30s,so I know the effectiveness of pumping iron. But
beyond using 5lb weights  for toning routines,I hadn't weight
trained in several years.
I was out of breath,sore and exhausted the first time I did
ONE workout! I felt that PERHAPS it was too intense for my age
and maybe I made a mistake in purchasing it. However I pressed
on,and was rewarded for it.
By Good Friday,when I had my physical,I'd lost 8 lbs,
developed KILLER abs that I hadn't seen since my 30s,and got
double takes from friends,family and coworkers asking ""WHAT
are you doing?""
I'm buying another copy soon,because my boyfriend
was so impressed with my results,I'm giving HIM my copy!
He travels,and is frustrated by how hard it is to stay in
shape on the road;he owns a Bowflex that's seen better days.
He'll have no problem packing a set of dumbbells for it.
I assured him that this DVD works for men and women,and that
it's tough enough to challenge him.

Unless you're UNDER 35,in GREAT shape and an advanced exerciser,
I'd suggest doing 20-30 minutes of cardio(or Pilates/yoga) before
ANY 15 minute section or 45 minute total body workout to REALLY
warm up, and for faster overall results.
My workout  consisted of 20 minutes cardio,a 15 minute upper
or lower body circuit section on alternating days,then either the
Warner ab workout or a Pilates DVD ab routine. The ""master""warm
up and cool down sections here are the same for all the segments;
I feel it's barely adequate.

Now that I've gotten the results I want,I rotate between this
workout and others for maintenance. It's helped me ease back into
regular weight training,which has fined tuned my physique and helped
me drop  more inches. I may have to go down a size for some clothing!:-)
I highly recommend this workout--if you're up to the challenge!",1338681600,4,2321,4.676470588235294

The first time I did this dvd I HATED it, obviously, because it made me work! I stuck with it though. I started doing this workout dvd once or twice a week, and on other days I would do cardio workouts at the gym. This dvd helped me change my whole attitude about working out and being healthy.

I think that if you like Jillian Michaels' workout, you should try this one for sure.
Although I love Jillian as well, Jackie brings something different than Jillian. Whereas Jillian is great for compound exercises that incorporate both weight training and cardio at the same time, Jackie is more focused on weight training. I can't say whether one if better because they are both amazing trainers! If you are a fan of home-workouts and a Jillian Miachaels fan, Jackie will surprise you!

I also have Jackie's 30 min Xtreme time saver and crunch-less Abs DVDs all of which I think are fabulous.  I find the 40 min work out to be challenging but not so tough that I don't think I can finish (with the exception of her lower abs circuit which is killer but if that is what it takes to whip my abs back into shape after having my son bring it on!) I use a lighter weight and am able to make it through the routine with out much difficulty (meaning I can finish the whole thing and feel like I worked out hard but am not struggling or in pain when its over) but I know if I used heavier weights it would be hard to make it though the whole workout so for those who say its too difficult perhaps you could try a lighter weight or no weights until you build up your endurance and are able keep up with Jackie and her trainers.  I actually found the pace on this DVD to be rather slow compared to her other DVD's but personally I like that bc it helps me focus on form and quality vs just slamming out a copious amount of repetitions. I try to keep up with the pace she sets on the DVD but I am more focused on form so for some of the exercises she gets in more reps than me but again, form is key so I just focus on that and know that as I get stronger I will be able to keep up with her through the whole routine.

4578985,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I have had gym memberships, taken tons of different workout classes and own at least 20 different workout DVDs.  Jackie Warner's Power Circuit Training is by far the best workout I have ever done!  I love this workout!  It transformed my body!  I have had two kids and while I have always been able to maintain a good weight, pregnancy and age has brought on love handles, soft legs, some cellulite (while I hate cellulite, I am learning it is pretty common for most women) and a flabby tummy.  I needed to tone up.  I bought the video a few months before a family beach vacation.  I did the video for 6 weeks, 3-5 times per week.  By the time we left for vacation, I had a six pack (no lie), solid legs and no love handles!  I can't ever remember having a body that I was actually proud to show off in a bikini.  It is true, your entire body will ache tremendously after the first time you do the workout and you will probably think it is too difficult to finish all the reps.  Give yourself 3 days to rest and then start again. If you stick with it, within a few weeks you will be able to do all the reps and you will no longer ache after working out.  And, if you really commit to sticking with it for 4-6 weeks, you will see a major transformation in your body.  I tell everyone I know about the DVD and they rave about it after working out to it as well.  You won't regret this purchase.  Plus, it is a bargain!",1324944000,54,1416,4.116788321167883

4578988,5,B0055OG9PQ,"This video isn't really for fitness buffs. Those who already have a consistent workout routine at the gym will not find a real challenge here. This video is for beginners or those who enjoy exercising with videos.

I've had this video for almost a year, and I haven't gotten bored yet. While I haven't used it consistently during the past year (I have other Jackie Warner videos that I rotate through), this is the JW video that I come back to time and time again. My favorite is the 15-minute total body workout that always challenges me. She also offers a 15-minute workout for the following: upper body, abs only, and lower body. And to top it off, she gives you the option of incorporating all of those workouts into one jam-packed 40-minute session. (I haven't had the courage to work my way through that!)

I used to use Jillian Michaels's videos, but I prefer JW for two reasons:
1. Jackie doesn't need to yell at you to help you get through a difficult exercise. She is like a partner, encouraging you to hold on while attempting to achieve maximum results.
2. Jackie is also clearer with her instructions than Jillian is, which allows you to perform moves without having to look at the TV all the time. (This is important for the cool down/stretch at the end of the workouts.)

JW's technique gives you the opportunity to learn the moves; it really is circuit training at its best in video form. In the 15-minute total body workout, she walks you through 3 moves, which you perform for 1 minute, that gears you up for the ""power burn"" in which you perform all 3 moves in 1-1.5 minutes. This gives you the opportunity to learn the moves and develop good form over time so you're not constantly staring at the TV, trying to determine what she's doing.

I enjoy the 15-minute video the best because it always challenges me in different ways: some squat moves can be modified to add weights; the shoulder moves (working the deltoids) are always challenging; the ab moves are not for the faint of heart.

Between using JW videos (the sole source of my recent workouts), changing my eating habits, and being a part of Weight Watchers, I've lost nearly 10 lbs in 8 weeks.",1323648000,13,2173,4.561538461538461
4578989,4,B0055OG9PQ,"This is the first exercise DVD I've ever purchased, so I didn't really have a frame of reference when it came to picking out the right workout routine for me. I chose this one because it has different workout times to choose from. For example, you can work out for only 15 minutes or you can do a longer time. I really liked the routine because for the most part all the motions were things that I could easily do; however, even doing the fifteen minute workout makes me extremely sore, so I think I need to do other types of exercise first and then work up to Jackie's super butt-kicking exercises. I can tell that I was definitely working muscles I don't normally use that much. I also like the fact that the routine is easy to follow along with. So, I would recommend this DVD but just know that unless you are already pretty physically fit it will kick your butt at first; you might have to cut back a little and then work up to it.",1323216000,,936,4.23463687150838

P90x was too extreme and not exciting.  This workout tape keeps it moving without being unrealistic.
I am trying to drop close to 15lbs in the next 6 weeks for a trip to the islands, so I hope Jackie can help me back into a bikini.  Keep hope alive with Jackie!",1320105600,3,561,4.1192660550458715

I like this video so much because she does the circuits in short but powerful sections and just when you think you cannot do one more rep you are done.

I loved the 30 Day Shred DVD but developed low back issues after doing it every day.  I've had no such issues with this DVD.

My only complaint is that for as much hard work as you do throughout the cirucuit, there isn't enough stretching afterward.  The cool down section is short.  If you're short on time, you can do a shorter circuit that sufficiently works your body or you can do a 15 min workout targeting a specific body part.

4579002,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I started using this video last year after seeing the free preview offered by my cable service. Two years ago I was 80 lbs over weight and had started working to take it off.  The first year I worked on my eating habits and walking the weight off. By the second year I had lost a substantial amount but still had that stubborn 20-30 lbs left and was flabby, flappy, and weak all over.  This video did as promised...it gave me great results!!

It's intense and fast paced from the beginning but she spends time verbally explaining how to position and move, focusing on form over speed. It took me almost a year to work up to completing the whole video the way she does it without pausing.  The first couple of months there was one exercise from each set I just couldn't do because my body wouldn't move that way. Then I would have to cut the reps in half.  Now I can finish the whole 40 min workout and have had to increase my weights on many of them to get the same benefit. A year later it is still an a**kicker and gives me a great work out!!

I love how quick it it.  Just when you think you can't do anymore the whole routine changes. When it seems like I can't do another rep I just remind myself that nothing is done for longer than 60 seconds.  Exercises are easily modified for beginners and those working with physical limits, I have a herniated disk and a funky knee...the only long term modification I had to make was a thick mat like we had in grade school vs. the thin yoga type mats they use on the video.  In fact my back is stronger and hurts less since I started this video! (Though always check with a doctor first!!)  Jackie is reassuring, clear, and motivating the whole time.  The exercises are broken up in to specific body parts and the screen changes for each set which is nice so you can grab your weights or move your mat.  The only thing I wish was that they had added a timer at the bottom of the screen so you knew how long you had left on each exercise.

I started out doing the video once a week, then twice a week, finally to three times a week as I got physically stronger.  A year later I just started doing the video twice a week and supplementing a yoga/exercise ball routine in three times a week to challenge my muscles in a different way while still keeping them strong and lean.

I will always fall back on this video - Jackie did a great job!!  I'm constantly getting compliments and I know It's because of all my ""jackie time""!!

As others have said all you need is 1-2 sets of weights, a light set (I started with 5 lbs) and a heavy set, (I now have 5-10-15 lbs sets), and a mat. I started with just the one set until I was physically strong enough to use both as there is only one exercise where she uses both. The workouts are in a relatively controlled space so you don't need to much more room than the mat as all exercises are either done on the mat or right next to the mat.  I started with a yoga type mat but then bought a much thicker mat to absorb the impact on my knee and lower back.  There are several workout options and while they are all similar the exercises are different.  I really like the 40 min version for the great overall attention to each muscle but did use the 15 min version on the days I was super crunched for time.

If you are looking for a serious change and are ready to put in the work this is the best video workout I've seen in a long time!  5 stars all the way!",1312243200,,3441,4.135135135135135

The movements were slow and after the 40min workout I felt like I needed a workout, in fact, I did another workout.  I was sore after this DVD, which means 1: the warm up did not have enough cardio to get the muscles warm/flexible;  and 2: the cool down did not stretch the muscles adequately. I really like the Xtreme Time Saver DVD that Jackie has.  I'd pass on this DVD for Bob or Jillian- the workout was just lacking.",1311724800,2,488,4.204301075268817

There is a very challenging 40 minute routine, but it also includes three 15 minute super sets that are fantastic when you are pressed for time, or the day after a big workout.

I also like the fact that all you need are some dumbbells and a mat (or nice thick rug).  I intend to take it with me when I travel.
Very happy with this purchase.

UPDATE 2013: As with most exercise DVD's, eventually you get sick of them and the trainer's voice starts to irritate you. So I put this away for a YEAR! I have about 10 different exercise DVD's and so I brought this one out again and enjoyed it once more - older, maybe wiser, definitely not getting 'fitter', but I want to stay fit for my 'age' - 56 now.

Its a 45 minute (or 3 15 min short workouts) of strength training at a faster pace to get a cardio effect (BOGO!)  She spends 4 minutes with 4 circuits on each body part.  Its low impact but very effective.  Great workout.,1309219200,,315,4.271186440677966

At the beginning Jackie annoyed me (mostly b/c of her cueing, not her personality), but with time I was able to appreciate this is a solid workout.  If you're choosing heavy weights then you'll definitely see results from it.  I do the full 40-minute workout and particularly like the leg sets and still find them challenging, mostly b/c of the speed that Jackie works at.  There's very little time between sets to rest, which is the point of circuit training.  I think that Jackie often varies her speed, but have learned to either ignore her or pay attention to the two other exercisers who tend to be more consistent.

For some reason, it's hard to find a good workout in the 45 minute range, and this one fits the bill, which is why I'm still doing it!",1308960000,3,835,4.32051282051282

I have very little time to work out, so having the option of choosing a 15 minute workout was ideal for me.  (Also, something that isn't mentioned much, Jackie includes a pamphlet of a 5-day meal plan with little to no cooking (a godsend) that really helped me to stay on track.) After my first workout, by whole body was shaking- I could barely move the next day! But, I continued with the workout every other day and have now moved into the 40 minute total body on the weekends.  I can't believe my results- my upper body is so much more defined and my core is starting to really shape up.  I even moved to heavier weights and my energy levels have definitely increased.

The swift pace is actually fun, and Jackie is so much nicer than Jillian.  I'm sorry, but I don't need an instructor that makes me feel bad as I am working out.  I also liked her short, 15 minute segments and the 5 different workout options -- 40 minute total body, 15 minute total body, 15 minute abs, 15 minute upper body, and 15 minute lower body.

I had reached the point where I could do 20 minutes of squats and lunges with 8 lb hand weights and feel next to no burn with minimal soreness afterward.  I've done this DVD twice, and have only been able to get through the 15 minute lower body workout.  It left my legs so fatigued that they were trembling, and I had serious doubts whether they would provide me adequate support to get through the remaining standing portions of the workout.  And boy, was I sore afterward!  Simple things like the flight of stairs in my apartment building (I live on the second floor, no elevator) were quite the challenge for a couple of days.  If the abs and upper body workouts are as intense, I can't wait to see what this DVD does to my body as I become accustomed to the workout (I'm in my mid 40's and I've lost nearly 40 lbs in the past year and a half and am now trying to fill in some of the loose skin with muscle).",1306972800,,973,4.260869565217392

It gives my abs a great workout - something that my Jillian Michaels' Shred It With Weights and Ripped in 30 Days don't do (Jillian Michaels' DVDs work for me too, improved my cardio fitness, strength, and improved my shape). So far, only this DVD and Cardio Fusion Leaned and Toned have left me pleasantly sore. None of the other workout DVDs I did left gave me this very pleasant after-effect. The stretch session is quite short, I find it insufficient. So I stretch myself out for longer after the workout.

What I love most about this workout is the variety of exercises. Each circuit is 4 mins and has three exercises. Each is done for a minute, then do all three in the fourth minute. There are several circuits so I don't get bored. I really like this as weight training is not my favourite and long or repetitive exercises bore me.",1306800000,,898,4.475609756097561

The second time I did it, I modified it Jillian Michaels-style by doing biceps curls, shoulder raises, triceps presses, etc. while doing the lower body moves and adding squats and lunges to the upper body moves.  Now it's going back to the library.  I found Jackie to be upbeat and encouraging without being too annoying, but she gives too little instruction about form.

4579017,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I purchased the DVD from Target on Tuesday, worked out with it Wednesday, and I am hooked. I only get 30 mins for lunch. I can do a 15 min segment, shower, and be back at my desk all in 30 mins. I work up a good sweat in 15 mins. The tape is fast paced, which I like because I get bored easily doing the same repetitive exercises. I am not athletic or a fitness buff. I am slightly overweight, but I found the DVD easy to follow and I was able do the work out. My abs are so weak, I had to make up my own modified version for some of the abs moves, but all in all I felt the burn, my muscles were fatigued, and I am sore all over today, so I am guessing I performed all the moves correctly. I love the way Jackie instructs in the video, and I felt like I was her client. She is friendly and pushes you to keep going. She lets you know how much time is left and when you are almost finished with the move. The video also included a 5 day meal plan which is easy to follow as well. I am looking forward to seeing results with this video.",1305158400,,1035,3.7962962962962963
4579018,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I am so impressed with Jackie Warner. I get so much more from her workouts than with Jillian. I have been working out with Jillian for almost 2 years, and I have loved her, but I respond better to Jackie and her way of coaching. She teaches as she coaches, and she's much more pleasant than Jillian. I sweat way more with this circuit training DVD than I ever did with Jillian. Like, dripping sweat all over my body!! I LOVE it!

PLUS....I LOVE Jackie's book.

4579019,5,B0055OG9PQ,I have alot of workout tapes-I really like this one.  It is an evenly spaced out workout-not too fast or too slow.  I use it on days I don't feel like doin P90X.,1304899200,,161,3.8484848484848486
4579020,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I have Xtreme Timesaver and Crunch-Free Xtreme Abs by Jackie. I am nearly 40 and have quite a collection of workout dvds and consider myself fit. I must admit that Xtreme Timesaver feels heavy some days. Crunch-Free is doable, but makes me feel that I had execised the day before. This one is fantastic in many ways. It's much more fun compared the other two. It IS indeed challanging, but the circuits move fast, so you know that the burn will not last too long. There are many moves that I have not seen before. I really like Jackies's style: very down to earth, yet motivating.
This workout is short, sweet and very effective. A must have, in my opinion.
Have a great workout!!",1303948800,,680,4.491935483870968
4579021,5,B0055OG9PQ,These have the best workouts.  I typically do the 15 total body workout.  It gives you a great workout targeting specific parts of your body.  The only complaint I have about the workouts is that Jackie doesn't spend enough time stretching but that's because she's trying to get everything to fit into 15 minutes. So just take your time stretching afterwards.,1303689600,,359,4.852459016393443
4579022,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I had the opportunity to try this workout ""Free"" on Demand with our local cable company.  After the ""Free"" time was over and they took it off, I decided after a month that I really liked this workout because it touched on most core muscles throughout the body. LOVE IT!",1303603200,,269,4.38
4579023,5,B0055OG9PQ,"This is a wonderful Jackie workout routine. The 3 exercises for a minute each, followed by a minute of ""power-burn"" (putting the 3 together for another minute) really gets your heart going as well as fatiguing your muscles.  The exercises she performs are not earth-shattering, they are actually pretty basic, but she focuses on form and still manages to be fast paced.  I find Jackie quite encouraging and no-nonsense. She isn't overly bubbly or irritating but her voice is constantly reminding you to watch form, how to correct for common mistakes, etc.  Besides her extreme timesaver workout, this is a fav of mine. I also like that you can break it down by upper/lower body and abs to customize your workout.  Keep the videos coming Jackie!",1302998400,,744,4.880952380952381
4579024,3,B0055OG9PQ,"I have been rotating this workout into my weekly exercise routines for a few months now.  While I like some aspects of Jackie's workout, others need vast improvement. I will start with the positive points.  The workout can be easily tailored to your daily needs since the workout is split up by body part into various segments. I usually do the entire workout at once but have chosen just the abs portion from time to time. It really leaves one with no excuse for not exercising! I found the workout intensity to be great.  You can adjust the intensity by moving up in weight. When I first tried the workout, I used 3's and 7's.  Now I use 5's,10's and for select exercises, 12's. Finally, the workout flys by!  Since it is a circuit training format, you are transitioning from one exercise to another quickly.  Before you know it, the workout is done.  No boredom and no down time.  Very efficient and effective.

Now that we have covered the positive points of the DVD, I do want to share some of the negative aspects as well.  First and foremost, Jackie runs through her reps WAY too fast. Transitioning between circuits SHOULD be fast; however, your reps should NOT! You can get a better workout by slowing down and to boot, you will prevent injury. I always modify her exercises by slowing down the reps and at times, modifying the form. If you have any injuries or arthritis-knee, back, neck etc., you will need to modify many of her exercises. They are easily modified if you are an experienced exerciser but perhaps not for a newbie. Last but not least, she utilizes a few real old school exercises (like trunk twists and sumo side bends)that really are unnecessary.  There are many exercises that are safer and more effective that could have subbed in for these.",1302480000,3,1771,4.60828025477707
4579025,4,B0055OG9PQ,"This is my first dvd by Jackie Warner.  I must say, when I saw the cover I thought for sure it wouldn't be my cup of tea.  The woman is absolutely ""ripped""....fat would be afraid to land on her.  I imagined the tough, ""so what, you're coughing up your spleen, don't be a wuss"" kind of instruction.  I was pleasantly surprised that her instruction was encouraging, straight-forward and friendly without being too hard or too over the top.  Perfect.... I borrowed this from the library and ended up checking it out for more time so that I could do all of the segments.  I am contemplating purchasing this one now to add into my rotation to give me a bit of much needed  resistance training.  I really like that there are five workout options: 15 minute or 40 minute total body circuits, or 15 minutes of only abs, only upper body or only lower body.  I worked out with the 3 targeted ones all together as one work-out.

The thing I liked best is that you can use higher or lower weights depending on your preference and you are given exercises that you do your reps and move on to the next group. No endless reps...she gets in, exhausts the muscle and moves on so the workout goes quickly and you feel like you have accomplished something at the end.  You have three exercises to do (longer reps in the first round and then shorter reps once you put them all together at the end.)

The one area that I would have liked a little something different is in the menu.  I would have liked the option of custom workout where I could add segments together and not have to fast forward through a warm-up I already had done or through a cool down that I would do at the very end.  That is really a small thing in the grand scheme though.

Overall, a great dvd and I would definitely seek out more dvd's of hers.  Great cuing, excellent form and a good total body work-out.

Don't be frightened by her awesome abs...this is one good instructor!",1302220800,,1932,4.351955307262569
4579026,4,B0055OG9PQ,"I got this in a multi-pack and it was totally worth it.  I like a little variation from my favorite workout (No more trouble zones--Jillian Michaels) and this does the trick.  It doesn't incorporate a lot of upper and lower body, but it does get the heart going and enough variation and difficulty to get the body hot...and works out the muscles slightly differently that I'm still sore afterwords....great addition to the workouts I do currently...and nice to have a 40min work out...really be 40 min.",1302048000,,502,4.825581395348837
4579027,3,B0055OG9PQ,"This dvd was ok, nothing special.  I probably won't use it much unless I have a day where I want a light work out.  I've worked out my entire life though....running, weights, cycling, yoga, hiking, etc.  I guess I was expecting a more intense work out by the looks of Jackie and all the hype, so it may just be a letdown because it wasn't up to my expectations.  I should probably try it again and increase my weights.....I definitely didn't use heavy enough weights when I tried this dvd.  I love most of  Jillian's workouts (they are much more intense) and  I used the weights I normally use with her dvd's and it wasn't nearly challenging enough for this one.  I do have to admit that the abs workout on this left me sore (which is hard to do)!  I thought she put together a really thorough ab mix, better than Jillian's ab sequences.  I wish Jackie would have been this focused and intense on all muscle groups, even if it meant breaking it down into two different workouts.  I felt that she neglected upper body.  It was almost like she put a shoulder/chest segment in as an afterthought.  Our legs get lots of use with all cardio and other workouts, so it would be nice to have a really thorough upper body segment.  I think this would be a good dvd for a beginner or on a day that you want to get your body moving, but not push it.",1301616000,,1338,4.257936507936508
4579028,4,B0055OG9PQ,"I tried the workouts individually, and each exercise was very good, very targeted, and fast enough not to be boring! BUT I wanted a longer workout. Kind of felt it was too easy. Next time I might try doing each twice.

The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because I wish it was a longer workout, but if you're short on time and want a good workout it's PERFECT.",1301356800,,366,4.154929577464789
4579029,5,B0055OG9PQ,"During the first workout, I could feel the burn. I am in relatively good shape, 10pounds overweight. I have a moderate base muscle mass, and haven't done much for 3 years except walking. (Had two kids, one year apart). In this current physical state, even though I didn't gain a lot of weight, it was difficult to do her routine.

Jackie's workout was relatively fast and it was difficult to maintain good form and keep up with her pace. Some videos have an exercise person on the video who is doing low-impact or slower, but Jackie's had only people in tip top almost professional athlete level condition.

I found her hurried fashion almost rediculous and impossible-but don't get me wrong. This is absolutely the best workout video I have ever done.  I have been working out via videos since 1980 and this is probably the most effective with respect to type of exercise, routine and number of repetitions- but unfortunately hard to complete the full routine becuase of her speed and ability to keep up with the instructor Jackie.

I ended up getting frustrated and then just alternated her two movements for one of mine. Doable but you don't really get the comraderie of being in the ""group"", which in itself is motivating. The next day, I could barely walk. It felt like my muscles had been stabbed, and each muscle even the deep muscles I forgot I had, wow I could feel each one.

All in all, I would recommend this video workout for EVERYONE, once they reach advanced stage of their physical workout state-so already cardiovascularly in shaped with a good muscle mass, and perhaps only for those who just need to tone up.

This is truly an amazing trainer and now I do beleive it is possible to get into top shape, almost perfect form without surgery, which I always assumed celebrities used.  Thank you Jackie! (little bit slower routine next video please!)",1301270400,,1864,4.699386503067485
4579030,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I really liked Jackie's cardio circuit training.  The UFC's were a killer.  I did the 40 minute workout, and only had to modify a few excercises.  I was happy when this workout was over, but I can't wait to do it again.",1300320000,,219,4.166666666666667
4579031,1,B0055OG9PQ,"Update 10/2016: I have decided that I really dislike this video. EVERYTHING feels rushed, and she's got you up and down from the mat constantly and in a very disjointed way. My biggest beef, though, is that if you attempt this at the pace she and her assistants are at (and she is often counting down even faster than they are doing the repetitions, which is already too fast), you are putting yourself at serious risk for injury. Pointers for form are minimal and insufficient, and the way you're sped through the already short to begin with routines negates most of the benefits you'd reap from doing the repetitions slowly and deliberately.
My advice is to try any of her other workout videos and leave this one on the shelf.
6/2012: I don't know the chronology of Jackie's workout videos, but I do know mine.  I started with the Xtreme Timesaver workout and was extremely impressed.  Jackie consistently stressed the importance of proper form and implored you not to rush through the moves, as it was more important to do the exercises properly and with good form (both for effectiveness of the exercises and to avoid injury) than it was to try and maintain a certain tempo (like that of the music!).
All that good advice seems to have been abandoned in this video, which finds Jackie and crew rushing from one exercise to the next and, during each of the exercises, maintaining a tempo that I found to be downright dangerous unless you had impeccable form.  It was nearly impossible to keep up, especially in the 15-minute total body workout. The exercises themselves are good, and effective, but not if done in the rushed manner that is demonstrated.
All in all, a huge letdown from Xtreme Timesaver, which I highly recommend.",1299628800,15,1732,4.728476821192053
4579032,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I have several workout d.v.d's and must say I really like Jackie!

4579033,5,B0055OG9PQ,"This is my first Jackie Warner DVD and I have to say, I think I'm hooked! What I love the most is the pace of the workouts. Some exercise DVDs are annoying (I feel) because there's too much time between different exercises or too much talking. Jackie keeps you moving and keeps you working! (Her power burns are great because they push you to do just a little bit more.) And, the time goes by really quickly. One caveat--she's not for beginners. I wouldn't recommend anyone start with this. Some of the ab stuff isn't back friendly at all if you don't already have a foundation.

Overall--I highly recommend and I look forward to purchasing more of her stuff!",1298678400,7,659,4.53781512605042
4579034,4,B0055OG9PQ,"This is a good video to add to anyone's exercise dvd collection.

4579036,5,B0055OG9PQ,"This DVD is so great! I run and do yoga throughout the week and was looking to add a strength training routine and found this at a pretty good price. Keep in mind I've never tried an instructional DVD so I would consider myself newbie. Also I'm not someone who's constantly in the gym with weights- So I was a little worried when reading reviews here about it being advanced. I will admit it KICKED MY BUTT! My first time I only did the ab and upper body circuits, I was so sore the next day but was able to do my usual run. I think the key here is to know your limits and what your abilities are- she even comments on this in the DVD... She recommends either using heavier weights for better resistance or none at all (one of the girls behind her doesn't use weights). This is a great DVD and it was exactly what I was hoping it would be. I can't wait to work my way up to doing the full body circuit with weights! Get this if you want your butt kicked into shape!

For those of you using this regularly... How many days a week should a beginner start out doing?",1297728000,2,1063,4.086124401913875
4579037,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I am a fan of circuit training as you can kill two birds with one exercise session - cardio and weight training.  Jackie's DVD is by far one of the best ones that I have.  I love the sore muscles associated with working out and I could feel the effects of the workout for 2 - 3 days afterwards.

The full body workout takes about 40 minutes to complete.  The 15 minute full body workout is equally challenging.  If you are short on time, you can rest assured of a good workout with the 15 minute workout.  I especially like the way she explains the benefit of every exercise.

I highly recommend her DVD if you love circuit training and I am
looking forward to another DVD by Jackie.  She is an awesome trainer!

Oh, and by the way, if you don't have her book, it is a must to have because the book is a companion to the DVD.  It shows photos of everyone of her exercises on the DVD.",1297641600,2,883,4.111111111111111
4579038,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I really like this video because it is simple, the music is not obnoxious and you can do it in segments. I also like that the other people in the video are doing the same exercises at either an easier or more difficult level. You can go up or down. Once you do the video a few times you get the hang of it. I believe if someone was trying to loose weight, this would definitely accomplish it if you keep up at the speed they do the circuits. I'm trying to bulk up and tone. I'll be back when I accomplish that to tell you if it's working or not. :)",1296518400,,548,3.9017857142857144
4579039,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I purchased this DVD after buying Jackie's complete time saver DVD and absolutely love both. I find it hard to get motivated to work out but since I started these I have been working out consistantly. The dvd gives you options for different circuits but I recommend the 40 minute option or I don't think you'll get as much out of it. After the first time I tried it, I thought, that wasn't so hard..  until two days later when I could feel muscles hurting that I never knew existed. The DVD isn't so tough that you can't complete it. You get a nice workout and your muscles feel good afterwards. I recommend doing some cardio before it as well to get a complete workout in. Only complaint I have is that during Jackie's ""power burns"", some of the moves could be done a little longer when you have to address both sides. (ex: during the ab routine you only get to do 5 reps per side and it doesn't feel like you did anything because it went by so quick..) But then, some other moves kill during the power burn. Guess it just depends on the muscle!

I got it to break up the monotony of going to the gym or to have an option as something to do at home when I'm running short on time.
IT IS AWESOME. Combine this dvd with 20 minutes of cardio intervals after, and it's the perfect workout.
I actually LOOK FORWARD to working out to this dvd- something I have NEVER said before about any at-home workout.
The upper and lower body routines are challenging and effective.

In addition it offers a 45 minute workout as well.  I started with the 15 min each day using a different section.  I not only felt the workout in my total body without being so sore I couldn't move, but I am seeing the difference.  I have done just about every new workout tape.  I feel like you get the biggest bang for your buck.  A few weakness is the same warm up and cool down for each section and she doesn't guide you through each exercise which may be hard for a beginner.

YOu're essentially just getting one workout that is repeated into shorter sections.  Upper body 15 mins is the exact same upper body workout you do in the total body.  This is why I am giving it 4 stars and not 5.  Otherwise it is very effective and a good workout.  The pace is fast and keeps you moving.",1295308800,2,472,4.367816091954023

I felt the 15 min total body workout was not very challenging, so I was a little disapointed with that, however, when I did the 40 minute total body workout I was IMPRESSED.  It is tough (note: you have to move up on the weight for the arm section to really work your arms)!  One thing I like about Jackie's moves are they don't hurt my knees like Jillians do.  Jillian has you jumping around in a way that strains my knees.  When you first start Jackie's videos you might be sore for 2-3 days afterwards, sneezing or coughing will be quite painful - thats how hard you worked your abs.  Keep doing it - but don't overdo it, give yourself a 3-4 day break between these workouts, gradually decreasing the days you rest as you are able to without being super sore.  It gets much, much better!  Definitely stretch each muscle for 30 seconds (much longer than the video has you stretch).  Stretching your quads, hamstrings, and calves well is essential to prevent knee or back pain caused by overtight muscles.",1294790400,12,1147,4.524271844660194

I already have Extreme Time Saver Training and am looking forward to working through all the routines on this DVD.  I found the 1min per exercise circuits eaiser to work through eaiser than Jillian Michaels 30 seconds per exercise (2x per circuit), but each instructor does what works best for them.  As a workout DVD veteran, I would highly recommend watching the workouts once to know what you're getting into, as well as performing the workout once or twice without any weights to get used to the flow of the routines.  My only complaint is the audio track fades a lot; the volume is not steady and you may have to turn the volume up louder than usual to hear it through the entire workout.  I have experienced the volume issue with a couple of other professionally produced DVD's, so it's not that big of an issue for me.  Once I get used to the routines I can tune that out or use my own music.  Based on the workouts I've done so far, I would definitely recommend this DVD for anyone who's looking for a great workout in a short amount of time.",1291507200,,1131,4.434782608695652

4579054,5,B0055OG9PQ,"This workout is almost entirely strength workout, with good challenging exercises. It is also much easier on the joints, since there are no jumps like in 30 day shred by Jillian Michaels. However, I have to say that although I will likely be using this DVD a lot more than Jillian's, I like Jillian's style a lot more than Jackie's. I exercise to get results, so to me it makes a lot more sense when Jillian says ""I know it hurts, but if you want to get results you have to push through it"" than Jackie's ""Feel the burn... Love it!"" or ""Ouch! But I love the burn.""  If it wasn't for this annoying little detail, this would have been a perfect workout. Since it doesn't have any plank/push up exercises, I usually just pause the DVD before cool down stretch and do some of those from Jillian's 30 Day shred, 10-20 repetitions each, and then do the cool down stretch. Overall, it is still an excellent workout.",1290470400,3,908,4.404761904761905
4579055,3,B0055OG9PQ,"This was my first experience with a Jackie workout.  I purchased this DVD to switch things up with Bob and Jillian's workouts.

This workout definitely made me sweat!  I really enjoyed her circuit method and how each circuit is designed for a certain part of your body.  I liked how fast the transitions were between workouts, and her personality is really motivating.  I also liked how it's the same set that Jillian uses for her DVDs!

The ab circuits were INTENSE.  I thought the Sumo squats were awesome!  I can definitely see the potential to get huge results if you do those three circuits everyday.

However, I was a bit disappointed by the arm portion of the workout.  I wish there was more than just one circuit for arms!  You can't workout your biceps, triceps, and shoulders with just one exercise for each.

The full-body circuit also went by reallllly fast.  I was using a playstation to play it, so I wasn't able to check the length of the workout, but it totally didn't feel like 40 minutes...maybe I just was having too much fun and time flew by?  I'll have to time it next time...

Overall, this is a good 40 minute workout, but if you're not a beginner, you will probably be left wanting an extra 15-20 minutes once it ends.  Wish it was an hour long!",1290124800,2,1269,4.475982532751091

I was always a big Jillian Michaels fan, but her DVDs left me unimpressed. After seeing Jackie Warner's new show, ""Thintervention with Jackie Warner,"" I decided to give her a try. A month or so later, and I look better, feel better, and intend to keep working out ""with"" Jackie!
The video isn't easy, but it's also far from boring. You only need a mat and two sets of weights (light and heavy). I absolutely recommend this video! My only concern is that the stretch segment at the end isn't nearly long enough.",1289606400,,713,4.578125
4579058,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I am a big Jari Love fan, and was looking for variety.  The toughest part of working out for me is finding time, so I want to work hard when I work out.  I also have terrible knee problems, but am somewhat trained in fitness, so I modify when I need to.  I am not super young, and do muscle toning to keep muscle as I age, not to look hot on the red carpet.

I hesitated on this DVD when I saw one reviewer who said it hurt her knees.  I modified a bit, but did not have trouble.  Strong quads are what keep my knees together, so the good squat tracks were good for me.

I like the format of the workout.  You do a set of three exercises for one body part for one minute each, then you do a minute of the three combined.  The exercises are creative and effective, and the last combined minute effectively forces you do to 20 more seconds of each one after you think you can't do more.  My heart rate was up.  This is not circuit training where you lift, then do aerobic in intervals.  This is all weights, but at a pace that will get your heart beating.

I agree with other reviewers that the music is awkward.  Jackie, the music, and I were all going at different speeds.  This was not a terrible problem, as you know you need to do that exercises for one minute, regardless of reps.  Still, the music was a bit frantic, and not at a safe pace for doing the exercises.  If you did half time, it was too slow.  So I was always against the beat.  The music seems to serve more as an energy source than as pacing for the exercises, which is hard if you came up on aerobics.

After doing Jari Love for a year faithfully, this DVD gave me a good kick in the pants.  It is a bit more intense than Jari Love, and she does different exercises.  I am glad to add Jackie to my weight training rotation for variety and plateau-busting.",1289347200,4,1825,4.067415730337078

She wears you out but seems to know exactly when you need to rest for a minute....although you really aren't resting...you are just laying down on your mat doing different types of exercises. The variety is so tight that the workout flies by and Jackie makes you WANT to push yourself...first time I did it...couldnt get around without moaning and groaning for the next 2 days....now...I can whip this puppy out ...but its still not easy...a great workout and results....literally in no time!

However, I'm onto my 6th week of doing this, and I've noticed definite results! I've lost a total of 7 pounds, and I'm very toned in my quads, arms, shoulders, and biceps. Abs still need work of course!

I also notice that it's MUCH easier to do now. With the ab exercises, I had such a difficult time, I could barely do the first segment, but now it's just challenging, but not dreadful.

Don't be discouraged the first week you try it. It's not an easy video, and is definitely for intermediate to advanced athletes, however, it is doable. Just make sure you're following the appropriate body mechanics, or you can get hurt.

I also followed the leaflet inside with the diet, and I did pretty well with it. I've really emphasized cutting out sugar, and I've noticed my hunger has waned, and I'm not starving all the time. The diet is doable, although difficult the first week or 2.

My only complaint is that the upper abs workouts requires you to hold a dumbell above you and after just finishing the arm exercies my shoulders are extremely worn out.  So the intense burining during the upper abs section is more intense in my shoulders than my abs.

It's a fantastic workout, smart, pleasant and effective. It's quite hard but you can do it. It's designed for any level of physical shape, as long as you agree to workout hard. I do miss a couple of reps but at the end I am always bathed in sweat. My level is now close to intermediate. I always do the 40 minutes version and my heart rate pounds wildly ! However I am not sure it's cardio for someone who is well trained (cardio wise).

It reminds me of Jillian Michaels Trouble Zone workout. However I much prefer this one. She works out all muscles separately and you really feel the burn, to say the least! It's worthwhile a gym session @ the gym! You build up muscles and progress quickly and efficiently.

Any faults that other reviewers found might be correct but don't really bother. It's great as a whole.

This DVD is more toning and less aerobic than some of Jackie's other offerings, but that doesn't mean you don't sweat and work like crazy.  I was able to get through it reasonably well the first time I tried it, although I'd recommend keeping the remote handy to pause and rewind it the first few times you try it, as Jackie doesn't waste a moment in between exercises.  I finished the 40 minute whole body workout thinking it was less advanced than her other DVDs, but changed my mind a day later when I realized how sore I was and how effective the work had been.

4579070,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I couldn't wait to get this dvd as I've been a big fan of jackie since her workout show days. The dvd is broken down into three 15 min sections, or a 40 min total body. I've been doing the 15 min sections on alternating days and they are tough! The 15 mins goes by unbelievably fast, which is important for me...it's over before you know it, but I'm still feeling it days after. The lower body was especially killer. I'm pretty out of shape, just a little overweight (average!) and this one feels like it's really going to work for me! It includes a (small) booklet inside with a nutrition plan that I have been really into following since getting this 5 days ago. I think the combination of the video for strength training, the nutrition plan inside, and doing Jackie's cardio interval plan (20 mins cardio...2 mins walk fast on incline, 2 mins sprint, 1 min walk slow to bring heart rate down, repeat 4 times total for 20 mins-also killer!)have really got me started in the right direction.
I don't know if it's good for people already in shape, but I will say that my husband's in good condition, and he was impressed when he did the 15 min upper body part of the dvd. He says his arms are still sore a few days later! If you are looking for something that you can do in a little bit of time (my 1 yo can tolerate sitting in the highchair for the 15 min sections!) that really feels like it will work, I say go for it!

4579071,4,B0055OG9PQ,"This is my first Jackie Warner dvd. I have been working out with Jillian Michaels dvds for a couple years now & was looking for something new to mix into my routine. I chose this dvd because it seemed closest in comparison to my favorite Jillian Michaels circuit training workout, No More Trouble Zones.

The instructor, Jackie Warner, was easy to listen to and I never found her to be annoying in any way - none of that fake, perky, high-pitch that can be common in fitness instructors. Jackie provides a basic, motivating commentary. The only area I feel she falls short in is her ability to focus on form - I wish that she would have given slightly more instruction on the proper form for each move - I found her brief talks on form to come too late (you've already been doing a few reps of the move) and inconsistent (proper form was not explained for every move). But, all in all, I like her as an instructor. The music & setting for the workout is simple & non-distracting.

The actual workout is separated into circuits directed towards specific body parts/zones. I was really pleased to find many new moves in this dvd that I have not seen in other dvds. I feel like this is a huge bonus, as many fitness dvds these days are so similar. The area I feel this workout falls short in (mostly in comparison to No More Trouble Zones) is that it is not as efficient. Jillian Michaels is great about combining moves (ie. chest press with a crunch) whereas Jackie mostly focuses on one body part at a time (ie. just chest presses). I also found myself wishing for more reps for each move. Jackie does one longer set of each move, then does a ""Power Burn"" of each move that has much fewer reps. I don't really understand what makes it a ""power burn"" since it does less reps, not more. I would have just preferred to have two sets of equal number of reps for each move, which I believe is more effective. Don't get me wrong - this was definitely still a challenging workout - just not quite as challenging as I am used to with Jillian Michaels' dvds.

Overall, I would say this is a really great strength-training workout & I am happy with it to mix into my normal fitness routine. I will definitely buy other Jackie Warner dvds in the future. However, if you have to choose just one strength circuit training dvd to buy, I would definitely choose Jillian Michaels' No More Trouble Zones over this one, simply because it is more efficient and slightly more challenging.",1286150400,15,2467,4.441501103752759

Wanted a new video to add to my rotation I bought this based on the reviews. I LOVE it! The workouts are similar to Jillian but enough variety to not bore me.

What I love is that I can do the full 40 minute workout, or do a couple of the 15 minute workouts (just stop before the cool down, go to menu and start a new one. You'll do the short little warm up again, but it's good for you. :) ) Best of all - with a 15 minute all over workout - who has excuses??!!

You can go at your pace. You will still feel the burn after the workout.
Jackie has one gal in the video using weights and another gal doing the workout without weights. Plus there is also a guy that pops in and out.
Some of the moves can be done with a light weight and some moves can be done with a heavier weight.

My only pet peeve is like some of the other reviewers--she talks about ""form"" but doesn't explain it until you are already 3-4 moves into the exercise.  For someone watching this for the first time, or even those returning to it after awhile it is helpful if not essential to talk about form BEFORE you start the move.

I would suggest watching this video once before trying it.  The transitions between moves are very fast.  PRO: It keeps your heart pumping and your muscles burning. CON: if you need to switch weights like me, depending upon the move, you can miss some of the workout.  Often times, I need to figure out what we are doing first before I decide whether or not I need a lower or higher weight.  I'm sure with repetition this becomes intuitive, but for the first time this was a bit jarring.

All in all, a very good workout.  You will feel it.  I would use this as one of the videos in my rotation.  I have to say, though as far as instruction, TV presence, etc., my favorite is still Bob Harper from Biggest Loser, and Tamilee Webb ""I Want That Body"".",1284681600,,1213,4.361607142857143

Jackie has the nicest style of speaking and training... I have done this dvd over 50 times now and I still love it. I consider myself very fit, 5""5, 106llbs... and this dvd always makes me feel like I have done something good for my muscles! I feel it the next day, and have had no injury, Jackie is so adamant about correct form so you won't be injuring yourself.
I have a collection of fitness dvds, and I find the Jillian 30 day shred ok, but I find Jillians style a little irritating when you have to hear her over and over again. So if you feel like that too- you will LOVE jackie. she is seriously awesome! I now have all her dvds because I love her style so much, but this is still my fave of hers.
PLus, the most important thing of all- is that IT WORKS! I was 13llbs overweight and this has slimmed me down and toned my whole body.

Jackie's personality is infectious and not over the top.

I was sore the next day.

I have other full body workouts, Cathe, Amy, etc., but I wanted something to the point short and sweet and this is it.

Lastly, Jackie moves quickly through this workout and some have complained about this, my advice just do your own thing.  Pace yourself.  Form and getting the most from each exercise is more important than performing the exercise incorrectly.  Plus, the fast pace helps to keep that heart rate up, thus you are burning fat in your zone.

4579086,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I recently posted a comment regarding another person's review of this DVD and realized it might be helpful to post my own review!  So here goes...

I have never been one to work out with any regularity, as I tend to get bored easily.  Over the past five years, though, I became increasingly sedentary due to my job sitting behind a desk most of the day.  I also noticed my metabolism slowing down, and although I did not need to lose weight, I was out of shape, feeling tired a lot, and lacking the tight abs I was once so proud to have!  After turning 35 this year I realized I needed to add fitness into my daily life.  My goals were to strengthen and tone my body and gain energy, but without weight loss.

I had been working out for a solid 4 weeks when I first tried this DVD.  When I began exercising this summer, I worked out 3 days a week for the first 2 weeks and then 5 days a week for the second 2 weeks -- solely with fitness DVDs at home.  I was surprised to find myself actually enjoying working out!  However, I reached a point where I wasn't feeling challenged enough by the DVDs I had been using (mostly SELF magazine workouts and Gunnar Peterson's Core Secrets) and decided to borrow Jackie's Power Circuit Training DVD from my local library to see how I would like it.  (I had tried the first level of Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred and LOVED it, but wanted something to alternate with that workout.  Just a note: As I continue to try different DVDs, I have found that I do not tend to enjoy ""dance-y"" workouts or intense cardio with complicated footwork.  I prefer primarily strength training that involves compound exercises and movement, so circuit training is a good fit for me.)

Jackie's Power Circuit Training DVD provided just the challenge I was needing!  Jackie discusses proper form for MOST all of the exercises, as well as shows modifications using one of the backup trainers.  (I completed the 40 minute total body circuit, which covers all of the exercises on the DVD.)  I will say that she does NOT do a very good job discussing proper form during the core/abs section, and I found myself needing to support my head during the first circuit (upper abs) to relieve the strain on my neck, rather than holding a weight in my hands as she instructs.

Before each circuit a screen comes up telling you which muscle group(s) you will be working and the exercises you'll be doing.  So, I did not find it difficult to know which equipment I would be using (as a few reviewers have complained).  You pretty much need to have your weights and mat accessible throughout the entire workout.  While I found Jackie's pace a bit faster than I wanted to go, I just took each exercise at my own pace...and yes, I felt the burn!  I did not find any of the total body circuit difficult for my knees (another reviewer complaint), although my family has a history of knee problems so I am very careful to use proper form doing squats, lunges, etc.  Additionally, Jackie cues well and has a likeable, non-irritating personality.  I consider myself an advanced beginner or intermediate exerciser, and I think this is a great workout!  However, not everyone's definition of ""advanced beginner/intermediate"" is the same...so take things at your own pace (fast, jerky movements are never good) and if you don't feel like a particular workout explains proper form well enough, find out from another source.

Update: I hadn't done this workout for a couple of weeks (I am now in my seventh straight week of working out -- a record for me!) and was dreading it, just thinking about how challenging it had been and how long it runs (approximately 42 minutes for the total body circuit). Once I started it, though, I was reminded of how much I enjoy it and how quickly the time passes! I look forward to doing it again!

Hope this helps! :)",1282780800,3,3844,4.517341040462428

I happened to have her circuit training workout OnDemand with my cable company for free so I gave it a try and I'm hooked!  The very first workout i woke up so sore I could barely walk, that's amazing!  I typically will do 45 minutes of interval cardio and then 30-40 minutes of resistance weights at the gym and this workout with Jackie gave me a better burn than my gym workout.

For 15 minutes, it definitely go the heart rate going and the next 2 days, I was sore.  Now, I played college basketball, ran 5-6 miles a day and worked out until 34 weeks of my pregnancy so I am not just a newbie.

4579096,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I already have the original workout DVD Jackie Warner had. Then when I saw this one, I wanted to get it because I liked her original DVD a lot.

I love this new DVD. There is NO excuse not to exercise!

- There is a 15 minute TOTAL BODY work out. This is something her last DVD did not have, you had to do all 3 20-minute sessions to get a full body work out.

- There is a 15 minute upper body, 15 minute lower body, and 15 minute ab workout.

- And for the extra challenge or if you want to workout longer, there is also a 40-minute total body routine.

I like the sequence of exercises better than her last DVD. She does 3 exercises for 1 minute each. Then you do a 1 minute ""Power Burn"" where you do all 3 exercises again within that 1 minute. That is when all the toning is supposed to happen.

The warm up and cool down are the same for all the routines unlike her last DVD as well. But that's fine because it's for your whole body.

I like to switch back and forth between DVDs sometimes. It changes things up a bit, and that's always good to when you're strength training.

I feel really good after doing this DVD. And the time goes by so quick! I love it",1280448000,2,1163,3.9827586206896552

No need to do cardio after doing this video. You will be sweating like crazy! If you exclude the warm up and cool down the total body workout is really only about 12 minutes...the only downside to Jackie's workout is that I do have a hardtime doing it on back to back days. I'm seriously sore from head to toe. I have not been able to do it more than twice a week. Although, I am in shape and not trying to lose weight, my muscles are visibly defined after four sessions.

I have a Reebok step and a collection of great DVDs, which I rotate and change up to keep from getting bored. BUT I did this workout ONE time and my mother in law said, ""Wow, you look great. Have you been working out a ton?"" She sees me all the time. The only difference was this workout.

And I can see it in the mirror. I don't see it on the scale. But I think that is because of how much muscle sculpting this work out does. It kicks my butt and the pay off is phenomenal! I have now done this workout 3 times and I swear to you...my legs look different. I have a biceps muscle  (suddenly!) and my butt is higher. I am not joking. I can't do this workout two days in a row...it is hard. So I do a good cardio routine between, and I am seeing a significant difference in such a short period of time. Here's the scoop. The exercises are all extremely calisthenic in nature. You use weights, you focus on one or two body parts at a time. 3 exercises, about a minute each.  Then she does a 'power burn', which is all three again, in shorter time frames, but which completely burn out the muscle. It is genius. Do you know Jackie charges $5,000 for her weeklong fitness retreats? You can get the whole workout here, for $9.99! It is a steal. I love this DVD and plan to do it for the next 6 weeeks.

You absolutely cannot get the same results from just doing cardio. It is about targeting these muscles, and now you can do it all at home. Jackie rocks and I highly recommend this routine It is only 40 minutes long and I thought it would hurt my knees, but they do not hurt at all! LOVE IT. love you Jackie!!!

There are 4 15 minute target segments and a separate 40 minute total body workout.  They have you lifting sets using various routines rather quickly so you get cario in as well.  There are women and men doing the exercises in the workouts, with the men using heavier weights.  The trainer isn't annoying like in some other DVDs.

In each 15 minute circut, you do 3 - 1 minute exercises concentrating on a different muscle group.  There is a 4th minute called the ""Power Burn"" that combines all exercises.  Most of the moves are simple to learn.

4579104,5,B0055OG9PQ,"If you are looking for a workout DVD that focuses on circuit training, without a trainer who talks too much and otherwise slows down the workout, then this DVD is for you. Jackie is basically just as involved in your workout as a trainer in a gym would be, she gives you enough description to do the exercise in the proper form and occasionally some words of encouragement but that's it. This is a great DVD to act as a stand in trainer.

The 40 minute total body workout is terrific. At first I was skeptical regarding how complete a workout could I get in 40 minutes. The workout moves steadily and at the end of each exercise you are feeling the burn. You can increase or decrease weights at your convenience and by the end of the 40 minutes, there is no doubt that you have received a total body workout.

I was even more skeptical to try the 15 minute total workout and was just as pleasantly surprised. Quick, effective and thorough. By the end of those 15 minutes you feel like you have had a total body workout, great for those days when you can't make it to the gym.

As an owner of Jackie Warner's other workout DVD, I was happy that she came out with another fitness DVD I could work into my workout. I like having her DVDs to fall back on, for days when I don't want to go to the gym but I still want to work out.

All in all, a great product and one I wholeheartedly recommend!",1278547200,3,1390,4.194756554307116

Second, Jackie basically sprints through the exercise and NEVER says go at your own pace.  She goes so fast that if you try to keep up with her, you will get hurt.  Just remember, it's not about how many your do, but that you keep going, at your pace, keeping your form, until she says stop.
Third, overall, it's a tough workout and you will feel it, which is good.  You can add weights and try to go faster.  It's a decent workout, that needs a better instructor.",1278460800,3,579,4.133928571428571

I've been working out for several years, but I mainly stuck to cardio like running or the elliptical. I didn't do much weight lifting type of exercises.

Boy was I missing out. Ever since starting this workout (and slowly increasing weights over the few weeks I've been doing it) I've noticed a HUGEEEE change in my body and my energy level. I can actually see and feel my muscles changing and I feel like I'm 18 again. It's amazing!

The video isn't the BEST quality and she doesn't describe things in very much detail. Plus some of the moves are pretty intense. For these reasons I state that this isn't a video for beginners. I've been pretty sore each and every time I do this workout and like I stated above I'm definitely not a beginner. If you've never had someone explain proper form for weightlifting then you may end up hurting yourself trying to do some of these moves.

I started out at the beginning of the year doing Jillian's 30-day shred video because I wanted to get some definition, and look good in a bathing suit.  That is definitely a very good, short workout in my opinion. I thought Jillian was about as tough as it gets, and I really like her style. I started wanting some variety, so I bought a few more videos including Jackie's Power Circuit Training. Jackie is a great trainer, no doubt about it. I instantly feel the tone in my muscles during and after this video. She focuses on ""form, function, and fatigue"" and seriously, your muscles do wear out at the end of each circuit. She offers two versions of a lot of the moves so you can make it a little more difficult or easy if you want. They look simple for the most part, but they REALLY work! The ab routine is really hard! The only complaint I have is, during the upper ab workout, my neck feels strained so instead of having my arms up in the air with a dumbell, I have to keep them behind my head. The moves still BURN, though. Also sometimes during the ""power burn"" section of each circuit, she moves so quickly between exercises that I barely get a few reps out before it's on to the next thing. The concept is good, though. It really is a tough workout, I fell asleep on the floor after stretching the first time I did the whole 40-min thing. That's another thing I love about this video: You can choose which body parts you want to work out and just do those circuits. Like today, my shoulders and arms were sore so I just did the Lower Body and Abs workouts. Good 30 minute workout. Bottom Line: This is a great, effective video and I am glad I bought it.",1275955200,,1702,4.269349845201238

I also noticed that the areas that I wanted to be a bit more firm, started firming up.  I highly recommend adding this to your exercise routine.  Jillian Michaels is my other favorite trainer -- Jillian's workouts feel tougher than this one I have to admit, but what I really like about Jackie's workouts are the variety and super-fast pace.

Through a series of circuits that target a particular muscle group, she ensures a good overall toning workout. If you are an advanced exerciser- then this is the workout for the days you aren't extremely energetic. Despite what she says, you cant use this as a calorie scorcher. My caloric count for the whole 40 minute circuit was just 215 calories. On the other hand for Jillian Michaels comparable cicuit (NMTZ) it was 430. So thats just half.

If you do the 40 minute total body workout, you will do a quads section, hamstring section, glutes section, chest section, biceps and triceps section, a back section, and three separate abs sections (upper, lower, and obliques).  You can also select from these sections rather than doing the full 40 minute workout. In each section, you do three different exercises for one minute each and then do them all at the end for a one minute ""powerburn."" In my opinion, this one is easier because you only work on one area at a time, whereas with Jillian you will be doing moves that work upper and lower body at the same time.

This is not a dvd for beginners, although it has modifications for beginners. What i would like to point out is that while the trainers seem to be using the same weight for all the exercises, i was not able to. you should have 2 set of dumb bells as advised but have in mind that there are a few back to back with say 5 seconds in between that should probably use different weights so keep an eye out.

i recommend around 10 pound weights for the chest segment and alternating between the 5 and 10 for the arms.

The upper abs workout also incorporates the use of weights and for that neither weight would serve well as the 10 pound is too heavy and the 5 weight is to light.

instructions is excellent and thorough, but without the extra push Jillian Micheals is notorious for. This is a great workout with great trainers unlike the annoying trainers on her other DVD ""One on One Personal Training with Jackie"".",1273622400,14,1101,4.35609756097561

I am not a couch potato - I spent a lot of time outside walking, little running, hiking, type of thing. But I'm not a fitness type either. I just like to be in good enough shape so I can do the things I enjoy.

This definitely took me to another level - I was surprised to feel it the most in my legs (I walk/run about 4-5 miles a day, I was surprised my legs were so weak!) You can split the programs and do a couple 15 minute rounds a day along with other cardio - which is what I do - or there is a full 40 minute circuit.

I don't have much to compare it to, but it was certainly worth the $10, and I will be able to use it for a while since I can up my resistance easily once I plateau. I am fairly slim, but after the ab workout I wake up the next day with a more clearly defined waistline - even the husband commented...it works.",1273104000,,1119,3.8189655172413794

Her workout can be broken down into lower body, upper body, and core focus or you can do a total body workout in 40 minutes.
Her circuit moves are pretty straighforward so you don't have to be super coordinated but they are pretty intense.
You can increase difficulty with resistance weight if you desire. She moves pretty quick through the routine - not boring.
You should have a mat and two sets of handweights (light and heavy).",1272931200,,452,4.592592592592593

She has you do three exercises plus a power burn for each body part. For example, there are three exercises and a power burn for the hamstrings.

She doesn't give you any modifications and expects everyone to be able to tackle each exercise at the same level she does. She has several other trainers with her on the set. She calls them ""your training team.""

The warm-up consists of jogging and jumping jacks (which I hate), squats and kicks, chain breakers (upper body), back stroke and finally trunk twists. It takes just under two minutes and the same warm-up is used in all segments.

For most of the workouts you'll need two sizes of weights and a mat. She doesn't say what weight to use but she indicates it's best to go heavy or as heavy as you can.

Even though Jackie has admitted crunches are ""worthless"" she does them in the ab section --- especially in the upper ab section. Moreover, some of the crunches are full sit ups with a weight in the hands. This is actually a dangerous exercise and most people are no longer doing the sit up type of exercise. ""It's working if it's burning,"" she says.

The lower ab section includes the basic crunch and tummy tucks. Then she has you do a single leg jackknife.

Then she goes into the ""power burn"" which is a combination of all the above exercises.

She then goes into the obliques and other areas of the abs. These are done standing in a side to side motion in windshield wipers. Then, you lay down and do a side to side roll in the half-way mark. This is an excellent exercise.

Next is a side plank. This move is hard to do and some people won't be able to do it. Moreover, if you have bad knees, you may not want to try it. This is followed by another power burn.

Next comes the stretch at about 14 minutes. It's a good stretch and does stretch the muscles just used in the ab workout. The same cool-down is used in all sections.

Total time with warm-up and cool-down in the ab section is 16:36.

I personally don't like the ab section and won't do them.

The lower body workout is fairly basic with some rather obnoxious exercises called UFCs built into it. Weights are used in some of these moves. I prefer to use resistance bands in my lower body work or even just body weight.

I didn't much like the lower body workout. I don't doubt it would be effective. It's just not a workout I enjoy personally.

The upper body work was pretty traditional and well done. Warner does a decent job of explaining the moves and how to do them. Unfortunately, she often doesn't tell you until after the move is started. So be sure and watch the workouts before doing them.

She does lots of isolation exercises, which I consider a waste of time. Most bodybuilders and exercise professionals prefer to do the big compound muscles since you need those for function. But, if you want big biceps or a six pack, you'll have to do isolation moves. It's just that they're not especially functional.

In reality, there are only six compound exercises that are needed to make a great workout. Isolation exercises work only one muscle or muscle group and only one joint at a time.

Today's fitness programs tend to focus on functional fitness, which refers to exercise that simulates real-life activities and uses a wide variety of movements through a wide range of motion. The basis of these routines are a variety of compound exercises. Compound exercises are multi-joint movements that work several muscles or muscle groups at one time. A great example of a compound exercise is the squat exercise, which engages many muscles in the lower body and core, including the quadriceps, the hamstrings, the calves, the glutes, the lower back and the core. Apparently Jackie doesn't adhere to this doctrine.

Examples of compound exercises are the bench press, military press, deadlift, bent-over row, pull up, dip and squat. The deadlift can be dangerous and a full squat is not necessary, though a modified one is great. Jackie does use the squat and the row but the other exercises seem to be isolation.

While I find Warner a good trainer and her DVD is easy to navigate, I really don't like the workouts. I do like the fact that there's a warm up and cool down with each section without having to click anything on the menu. And there's no doubt the workouts will build muscle and provide strength. I just personally don't enjoy the workouts and prefer a compound muscle workout.

Certainly her method of working to fatigue is the way to go and I applaud her for using that method. But this is not a workout I want to be doing except perhaps on rare occasions when I want something different.

This DVD is for intermediate and advanced exercisers and those looking for an aggressive, non-stop workout using mostly isolation exercises.

Certainly all reviews are subjective and what I may like, you may not and vice versa. I'm only giving my point of view here --- which is all anyone can do. You may find this a great workout.

4579119,5,B0055OG9PQ,"This is an update to my first review. I've been using this DVD and Jackie's other DVD two to three times a week since the end of January. I have lost about 10 lbs. and gone from a tight size 8 to a loose size 6. My body is tighter and more toned than it's been in a long time. I'm 46 and I considered hiring a personal trainer, but no need! Jackie is my personal trainer now and I love this DVD. I never get bored with it because you increase your weights and challenge yourself every time. When I did this DVD for the first time, I was shaking. And I THOUGHT I was FIT! Now I finished the whole DVD, sweaty and tired, but feeling very proud of my accomplishment.",1272412800,49,663,3.992481203007519
4579120,5,B0055OG9PQ,"Great DVD.  I really enjoy Jackie's exercises and circuits.  I really feel that I get a full body workout with this DVD.  She is upbeat without being totally annoying, she moves quickly between exercises, and gives good info on form and modifications (easier & more challenging).  Love it!  I only wish I could find more than 2 DVDs by her.

I have to comment on the ab workout too here.  It is phenomenal as it is with her one-on-one training DVD as well.  I do a lot of Jillian Michaels stuff and she's got great moves too, but I always feel I have to do additional ab work afterwards.  That is NOT the case here.  I was burning up!!

This is a great, challenging workout that you can use from the beginner to intermediate level.",1272067200,2,731,4.340740740740741
4579121,5,B0055OG9PQ,"For the person who is completely out of shape fear not. This workout can be done by anyone. But...it will take a while before you can do it well. The workout creates results in a very short period of time if you stick with it even if you cannot do everything in exercise program. For the beginner, just do what you can. You will get better at it. Some parts are even fun. I highly recommend this workout DVD if you want quick results and you have a burning desire to get there. If you decide to workout with Jackie Warner you ought to know that she takes no prisoners!!!",1271808000,2,570,4.1909090909090905
4579122,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I bought this video on a whim because I loathed my Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred video.  I am so glad that Jillian drove me to the frustration of finding a new video otherwise I would have never discovered Jackie!  Jackie's Circuit Training video has you work on 6 muscle groups:  Quads, Hamstrings, Butt, Back, Arms (biceps, triceps, shoulders) and Abs (upper, lower, obliques).  In each segment you do 3 separate exercises for 1 minute followed up by a ""Power Burn"" doing all 3 exercises, consecutively.  You can do the entire workout in 40 minutes or do a 15 minute upper, lower, or abs workout.  After a month of doing this video I can STILL barely make it though the ""Butt"" workout!  All you need are hand weights.  I use 3lb. and 5lb. hand weights just because my arms are wimpy and I can't use the 5lbs. for some of the exercises.  Sorry for the long winded review.  Honestly, I just can't say enough good about this video.  My sister even loved it and bought one for herself!",1271721600,4,984,4.47191011235955
4579123,5,B0055OG9PQ,I love Jackie's Power Circuit Training DVD.  I started with another DVD from a popular TV Trainer but despite the workout I didn't feel the results and didn't want to mess around.  Jackie gets every inch in 40 mins that feel half as long as another popular DVD workout.  The 15min workout leaves a lil more to be desired as I cannot fathom only working out 15mins. But it's a great companion for days that your are combining your strength and cardio days.  That being said its worth every penny it really makes you feel strong!,1271376000,2,527,4.458333333333333

4579126,5,B0055OG9PQ,"Wow, this is an amazing workout & I find it to be so much better than Jackie's first video, SO MUCH BETTER (& I loved the workout in her first video). This is a fast paced workout, so she definitely manages to squeeze in as much as possible in such a short time. The moves are great, and I definitely felt the burn both during & after the workout. I was sweating after the warm up & first lower body circuit!! I am starting off with 8lb weights and will increase if/when needed. If you are familiar with Jackie's first video and may be unsure about what to expect from this one, let me just say that this is a more grown-up version with a much better format and way better back-up trainers. I am an avid 30 day shredder and I honestly think that this workout is a little better.

As everyone else has already stated, Jackie moves through the circuits very quickly with no wasted time, & still manages to explain exactly how to do each move. I think this workout would be great for beginners as well because you can definitely learn correct form for each move in this video. I would definitely recommend it if you're looking for a serious workout!

**UPDATE: The ab workout is really intense, which I love, but unfortunately I find myself with really tender neck muscles the day after. The moves require you to keep your head off the floor with your neck straight with no support, and most moves this is for the whole circuit. Maybe it is only me with this problem? I have never experienced this before from an ab workout. My abs do feel great though!! Hopefully my neck muscles will strengthen as well, but man does it hurt :)",1271116800,2,1626,4.363036303630363
4579127,4,B0055OG9PQ,"Jackie rocks. This video is fast, upbeat, and effective if you want a cut-to-the-chase type of workout. I enjoy the 40 minute routine. The first time I did the workout, I was sore for several days. Jackie is inspirational, she looks great, and isn't annoying (high on my list for workout instructors). This is a great video for after work, when one may not have loads of time. She works the entire body. Each routine is performed twice, the second go-around is much shorter (one criticism, I wish the second go-around was a bit longer, but perhaps this is intentional in the workout arena).",1271116800,,590,4.6826923076923075
4579128,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I love love love this dvd. I've only done it two nights and wowwwwweee! I love it. My glutes, calves, thighs arms, back, chest and abs are all feeling it. I have a 6 month old son, and I had a c-section, and I was NOT in the best shape when I had him, So my scar can be sensitive at times, and those are the time where i take it a little easier.. but I can tell you right now this work outs awesome. I am by no means an ""advanced"" exerciser, I'm a 20 year old mom, average to about 10 lbs over weight, and this is challenging but definitely doable. Don't be stupid here people, listen to your body when you are working out, if you can't do something, don't, but at least try it just to be sure.

But this is a great workout, Don't get me wrong its not Easy by any means. I didn't want easy. I mean I sweat my butt off doing it, but easy doesn't get you results. I follow Jackie's belief that if you feel like you can do another rep at the end of a set your weights aren't heavy enough. I'd much rather pay 10 bucks for this dvd than go to a class, pay hundreds for exercise machines, or anything.

Well I also think that if you aren't practically falling over after a work out, you're not doing your job either! You don't HAVE to do everything perfect, if its too hard for you don't use weights at first, just use your body. Work on form and customize it otherwise until you are ready to progress to weights. It doesn't HAVE to be all or nothing when you first start a work out, and in fact I think if you haven't been active and you are choosing this to get started, which by the way GREAT choice, start with the 15 minute total body for a week or so until you feel upto moving on. Don't discourage yourself by going all out and thinking ""I Can't do that again..."" and leaving the dvd up on a shelf to get dusty.
These are workouts that are challenging and worth buying! I really admire her, shes a smart woman, and I totally agree with her, Sugar Is The Devil!!!!!!!!!!!! I think I'm gonna buy her book, I'm a believer.

You do need 2 set of dumbbells, one lighter set and one heavier set, and a yoga mat. but hey if you don't have that stuff right now, use what you got around the house. I've been using jugs of water or big cans of soup or beans. lol... Its not perfect but it works. I'll get the dumbbells soon.",1270252800,2,2316,4.030434782608696

5 STAR WORKOUT

Power Circuit Total Body workout - 45 minutes

TOTAL CALORIE BURN: 500

Jackie Warner's Power Circuit Total Body is a system based on the concepts of Form, Function, and Fatigue. Jackie's plan consist of 4 minute circuits that target specific body parts with 3 exercises for 1 minute each followed by a power burn session. (Source: Exercise TV on Demand)

 I was avoiding Jackie Warner's workouts, because I had seen her reality series on television. It kind of made me a little wary of her, since I couldn't understand some of the facets of her personal life. She seems too emotional, jumps head first in personal relationships, and allows her private life to be televised.  Besides that, she is beautiful and has the most beautiful hands & fingers I've ever seen on a woman. My husband agrees and thinks she kind of looks like Mandy Moore.

 I finally decided to sample her after seeing glowing reviews on her fitness DVD. After finishing her workout, I have to admit that she is on the top of my list for fitness training. I started sweating hard after going through her workout during the first 7 minutes. Almost every exercise was different and novel. Some of them were modified and better versions of exercises I have done in the past.

PROS:

My favorite fitness workout

The best workout I've ever done so far.

Pleasant and to the point instructions

Best and highest calorie burn

Fast - She keeps you moving non-stop

She has supersets (exercises that involve 2 or more sets of muscles working together).

Novel and creative exercise moves

Challenging

Cons:

- It was difficult for me to catch up with her on the upper ab move exercises. I love that she moves fast, but I will have to adapt.",1269993600,,1773,4.636655948553055
4579130,5,B0055OG9PQ,"This dvd kicks my rear end.  I usually do the 40 minute workout, which flies by.  The lower body workout is challenging.  But, what drives me to tears is the abs workout.  I have a strong lower body and a very weak core.  I usually have to stop several times during the upper abs workout.  Immediately afterward I curse Jackie and tell her I hate her. All is forgiven an hour later, though, when I'm feeling tighter and firmer and even a little sore.

Jackie is a great instructor.  She has an easy personality and not at all bubbly.  I like that she works out a bit and then focuses on form for every move.  I know that if she tells me it should be burning and it's not then I'm doing something wrong.

I highly recommend this dvd.  It's to the point.  Gets in and gets the job done.  I do this dvd 2x a week in addition to my cardio workouts 3x a week to tone and tighten.",1269648000,4,874,4.064705882352941
4579131,3,B0055OG9PQ,"I must be one of the few people that really just doesn't get into this.  I have used the ab and upper body routines.  I am much more likely to use the individual segments as I don't usually do upper body and lower body on the same day.  I found it annoying that I had to listen to her introduction for each 15 minute clip, go through a warm up and cool down. Would have been much better to have a matrix where I could easily skip by those things and do the real workout.  I do strength after I do the elliptical so I don't need a warm up, and the cool down was much shorter than what I would normally do.  Also, I think the reps would have been much more effective if she has slowed down just a little. Sometimes I felt like I was racing to keep up.

I think part of my problem is that I have been using Squeeze Stronger for some time now (upper body, waist, and abs), and if comparing routines that use high reps, I think Squeeze Stronger is much more effective. I was looking for a nice upper body routine that I could alternate in from time to time for variety, but don't think this is it. I have a lot of different ab routines to select from, but always looking for variety.

Abs: Her upper ab routine was nice and hit me different than some of my other workouts. I have pretty strong abs, though, and the lower ab and oblique workouts didn't do much for me. (Back to Squeeze Stronger, but her waist routine with a stick is much more effective than Jackie's squat/twist.)  I've kind of outgrown traditional ab workouts, which this was for the most part, as I've found other things more effective. If I'm going to go the traditional route, I have some other DVDs that work better for me.

Upper Body: I would have liked it if she had skipped the warm up and cool down and done more of a focus on the arms and shoulders.  There were very few exercises for these, yet this is the area that most people see.

All in all, these two routines were too basic for me, her cool down insuffcient, and I would have liked a matrix.  I don't think the DVD will get much use from me.

Also, as another reviewer hinted at, no one on the DVD seems to be working that hard.",1269302400,12,2159,4.124105011933175
4579132,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I bought this DVD on the advice of a friend and also saw it listed as a top ten excercise DVD.  Just what I was looking for. Yes, it's tough but if you want results, you have to work for it.  No messing around, gets right to the point. I was afraid the 40 min circuit would be too long but it went by so fast! I am still sore 2 days later but can't wait to do it again. Will come back in 2 months and update the comments!  I am alternating this with running, so can't wait to see the progress and changes!",1269302400,3,505,3.7904761904761903
4579133,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I love this workout.  Really really love this workout.  Its hard, its intense, and it WORKS.

The entire workout is 40 minutes (I haven't tried the short workouts).  The warm-up is a little on the short side (less than 5 minutes).  The workout then moves into the circuits.  Each circuit targets one muscle group and there is three exercises per circuit. Then all the exercises are combined in a power burn.  The cool down stretch is also pretty short.

She does a pretty good job demonstrating proper form for each exercise but there are no real modifications for beginners (the beginner modifications are really aimed at intermediate exercisers).  If you are a beginning exerciser, you should wait on this dvd.

The only equipment required is hand weights and an exercise mat (for hard floor surfaces).  The pace is fast (it definitely doesn't drag) and it targets everything.  I especially like the abs work.  There were three circuits dedicated to abs!  This work out will appeal to anyone who likes Jari Love and Jillian Michaels.",1269129600,6,1035,4.873563218390805

IT definitely kicked my butt!  I had to take two days to 'recover' because it left me SOOOOOOOOOO sore that it was rough walking up and down stairs!  BUT I cant wait to do it again today after work!!!!

JUST A FEW THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND:

1.  If you are overweight like I am, some of the moved are going to be hard for you to do! don't give up, because after the 40 minute work out!  I felt like I had never worked out harder!!!
1-a.  give yourself a day or two to recover after the first time you do it, and REMEMBER TO STRETCH A LOOOOOT  (before and after the video)!!!! it will save you from even more soreness!

2. Some of the move are pretty hard!  even my friends who work out all the time had a bit of a hard time doing 'the squat, kneel, and stand back up into squat position' move (cant remember what Jackie called it!)

3. Have water by your side! Youll need it if you are newer to working out!

4. HAVE FUN~! and don't get down on yourself if you cant do all the moved the first time around - because i know im still gonna struggle with it!  but im going to be so proud of myself when i am fit enough to do the entire 40 minute workout without struggling with any of the moves!!!

The ab workout is one of the best ones I've ever tried. The upper body workout got me ripped and the lower body workout left me in pain for about three days.

Personally I do the upper body workout combined with 20 minutes on an elliptical machine, such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stamina-55-1610-InMotion-E1000-Elliptical-Trainer/dp/B000VICRO8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stamina 55-1610 InMotion E1000 Elliptical Trainer</a>, and do that every other day. I do the ab routine on my ""off"" days - it's only 15 minutes. The best part about the way Jackie designed this workout is that you'll almost never outgrow it. To have the routines evolve with your progress just use heavier weights. I'm a 26 year-old, 6 fooot male and currently I use 15 lb. weights. I also try to squeeze in about 50 or so push-ups in between the sets and I'm done. My arms are huge, muscular and toned.

There are a couple of moves that were difficult for me (but they're the same one's I have trouble with when I take a class at the gym) so I know how to modify and just keep moving.  You will FEEL the results right away ... I actually felt them for a week after my first 15 minute session.  Its quick so you do not get bored ... even the 40 minute workout went by quickly.  I usually go out for my walk then come home and do one of these workouts.  I would highly recommend this DVD to tone up those muscles!",1267142400,,664,4.022900763358779

It's really great because you can pick a 15 minute or a 40 minute workout, depending on the amount of time you have available -- she has a full body workout OR you can do legs, upper body, or abs.  It's challenging no matter what as you can vary the weight to adjust the difficulty level. But I'm in good shape already and I could feel the burn that Jackie was talking about...she knows how to reshape your body.  I did the DVD for just one week and people already were telling me that I looked trimmer!!  Jackie has a great attitude, you can tell she's into it from a fitness perspective and makes sure to point out appropriate form on all of the workouts. It goes from one thing to the next, so you're not sitting around wasting time and you certainly aren't bored.  The next day I felt sore all over, but a great kind of sore as I knew it was working. Finally, the best part about this workout?  She doesn't jump around so much so you're not killing your knees the way you do with Jillian Michaels. I have all of the Jillian Michaels DVD's, and while I like some of it I didn't like all the bouncing around...it seems doing Jillian you would be much more prone to injury. I'd rather do a safe, effective work out, and this is it!!  Looking forward to more DVD's from Jackie, I hope she does more!",1266969600,4,1317,4.2023809523809526

I normally do four days of a cardio workout and three days of a cardio-strength training combination workout but had gotten very bored with my own routine. I tried workouts on WII Fit, but found them to be not a big enough challenge. I find the Power Circuit Training dvd to be a real challenge! I absolutely love it. I feel so strong powering through the routines with Jackie. I find Jackie to be very easy to work along with without too much unnecessary banter. She does a great job explaining which muscles are fat burners and so forth. She really knows her stuff! I now incorporate this dvd on my three days of cardio-strength combination training performing the 40 minute workout each time. I perform the ab workout after my cardio workout on the other four days. What an ab workout! It hurts so good!",1266537600,,970,4.548571428571429

4579153,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I categorize myself at an intermediate fitness level (med-high intensity workouts approx 1 hour/5 days a week.)

CONS: There is one move, especially, that involves going up and down onto the knees which I hate (don't have knee problems but I want to keep it that way and I feel these kind of moves can't be that good for it.) Can skip or substitute move with something else if need be e.g., jumping jacks or whatever just to keep heart rate up.

PROS: Overall, this was a tough workout, straightforward, a variety of dumbbell weight training moves, sit-ups, move in place cardio.  Really like this instructor.  Love, love, love that it does not have a lot of swishy transitional moves appropriate for guys or girls (backup people includes one guy and two girls that trade out for different segments.)",1266451200,,800,4.733812949640288

4579156,3,B0055OG9PQ,"The workout in this DVD, is worth at least four stars.  It is hard and really works muscles and the cardiovascular system well.  However, there are many negatives that detract from the good.

The music for the workout was apparently not playing while the workout was taped.  If it was, no one onscreen has any sense of rhythm or the editing is atrocious.  Unless you watch the screen the entire time, you cannot work at the same pace as Jackie because she goes faster and slower than the music as a segment progresses.  Since some moves require that you turn away or lie on the floor looking at the ceiling, that can be rather difficult.  For someone with a good sense of rhythm, trying to work at a pace different from the music is difficult and frustrating.

The warm-up and cool down segments are much too short, with too little stretching in the latter.  One can always stretch more without Jackie's leading, but it is unfortunate that many viewing the workout will think she's done enough.  Jackie's instructions are somewhat vague and incomplete about the movements.  It is easy to have bad form since she says so little about it.  Other workout discs use different camera angles and more instruction from the instructor to clearly show what good and bad form is.  There is little of that in this program.  There is an interstitial screen before each new set of movements that list what's coming, but if you happen to not look at the screen during those few seconds, or don't read really fast, you'll miss it. Jackie apparently thinks those lists are enough because she advances from one move to the next with little warning or transition.

The disc provides a 40 minute workout and four, targeted 15 minute workouts.  The latter are simply the same warm-up and cool down routines from the 40 minute workout plus one of the four segments.  That is, remove the cool down from the first three 15 minute workouts and the warm-up from the last three and run them together, and you'll have the 40 minute workout.

Jackie regularly counts down to one, ostensibly to indicate when to stop the current movement, yet you can never be sure whether she'll stop when she reaches one or if there's another bit to go thereafter.  Furthermore, her counting is inconsistent.  Sometimes, she seems to be watching a clock and counting off seconds.  Other times she seems to be counting movements, so the pace varies from one time to another, but also while she's counting in several instances.

If you aren't frustrated by mismatched movement and music, inconsistent counting, and you know good form from bad, then you may like the hard workout on this disc.  If you use this workout frequently or have good memory for what comes next even as you rotate among other workouts, then the little warning Jackie gives about the next movement will not be much problem.  Otherwise, try something else.  I will use this workout again, despite my frustrations, but I like numerous others much better overall.",1266019200,37,2987,4.731141199226306

4579163,2,B0055OG9PQ,"I bought this DVD today cause it was not too expensive and I was looking for something new.  I exercise almost daily and have for over 1 year and have lost a significant amount of weight however I have a way to go.  But I do not consider myself a beginner.  I could not perform all of these exercises.  I consider this workout VERY advanced.  It was hard on my knees especially.  Also, it moves so fast there are no instructions before each exercise and I found I was scrambling to get whatever I needed ie, mat, eights, etc. and having to rewind to start the exercise over.  To me this defeats the ""circuit training"" aspect as I had to keep stopping and starting the DVD.  Frustrating.  I did not feel there was enough explanation as to proper form. No modifications to do any of the moves at a less advanced level.  Frequently she would say ""you should be feeling the burn. If you are not, you're not doing it right.""  But then NO explanation on HOW to do it right. What she calls ""cool down"" is NOT.  Only 60 seconds at the most of a few stretches. I normally do at least at 10-15 minutes of cool down which I will do on my own.  This is the first Jackie Warner workout I have tried. I think she needs to talk to a wider audience.  If you are not already fit, this workout will be very difficult.",1264896000,81,1299,4.185483870967742
4579164,4,B0055OG9PQ,"This is actually a pretty great DVD - particularly if you're somebody that likes sculpting (as I do) over cardio. Led by the supremely ripped Jackie and a band of relatively mute but not lifeless drones (although 'Blake' looks like someone out of Mortal Kombat with his cartoonish muscles), this DVD really does do a total body workout that just flies by.

Despite the packaging of this DVD as 5 powerful workouts, it's really just 2, and even then, really just 1. The main 40-minute total body workout may seem like a strong time (and pain) investment but it truly just flies by. There are 9 'segments' in total lasting four minutes each, focusing on the quads, hamstrings, glutes, chest, back, arms, upper abs, lower abs, and oblique (abs). Each segment features 3 moves focused on that area (but often working in other areas at the same time) that you do for a minute before moving onto a 'power burn' where you do each of the 3 moves for about 20 seconds. Because you're never spending a ton of time in one area the workout literally just zips by and you feel all the stronger for it.

The 'second' actual workout is the condensed total body workout which takes one move from each segment of the 9 segments so you complete a lower, upper, and abs circuit of 3 moves + power burn per circuit. It's a great way to get the whole body toned on days when you just don't have time to do the full 40 mins. Now the other 3 'workouts' are actually just the 3 sections of the full workout repackaged - so you complete all 9 moves for lower, upper, and abs per workout. You could combine these in theory, but you'd have to skip over the warm-up and cool down that are thrown in for each mini-workout...or you could just start the 40-minute cycle and skip through whatever segments you want.

Jackie is a solid, spirited trainer, and it's refreshing to see her complete the workouts as often as she does vs. other dvds I've used. My only critiques would be that for someone who *isn't* familiar with form (I am), Jackie doesn't talk about it as often as she should. Although some of her fave phrases are 'Form is critical on this' and 'Make sure you're on point', I found myself relying on tips and tricks I'd learned from other DVDs (like tail bone to the wall when bending over for arms, or neck to the ceiling on abs) to make sure I didn't injure myself. Jackie could take a cue from Jillian Michaels' '30-Day Shred' and take a look at form quickly for each move to make sure people aren't walking away all sore and miserable the next day.

So there you have it. This is a *great* sculpting DVD with a fair bit of variation, but it's best combined with other workout DVDs. There isn't enough cardio within these workouts to justify using this dvd alone. Beyond that my only critiques are the way it packages itself as 5 workouts but is really just 2, and Jackie could do some more coaching on form. Oh and the abs workouts are a bit bananas the first time you do em!",1264896000,11,2961,4.397810218978102
4579165,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I've been working out regularly for over 10 years now. I've always hated work out DVD's. They can never hold my attention and I'd much rather go to the gym and take a class. Unfortunately, my erratic work schedule has changed, not allowing me to make it to the gym for my favorite classes. Now I work out at home. Tired of the usual work out routines I've been doing, I decided to give this one a whirl. WOW!!! After about 2 months of doing it I am noticing changes in my body that I haven't seen...EVER! I'm tone and cut in places that I never thought I would be. I'm a hard critic and can be pretty cynical, but honestly, this DVD works.

Pros: Up-tempo, great cardio and strength traninig.
  Varied exercises so you don't get bored
  Really focuses on specific muscle groups
  Pick the order of your program.

Cons: Jackie doesn't give much instruction on how to perform the exercise. She states that form is key, but doesn't exactly show how to have correct form. However: if you are familiar with common weight exercises, this will not be a problem.
  The whole group doesn't work out at once--which seems odd. She only has one person doing the strength moves at a time. Except in the Core section-where she does have someone demonstrating an easier option.

Overall: This a grea DVD for someone with experience. It is NOT for beginners. It will get your heart rate up, get your muscles pumping and I promise you'll be sore by the end of the program.",1264291200,15,1081,4.732620320855615

If you are a fan of that vieo you should know hat this one is different. First off, it lacks the weird sexual tension of the other video (a plus unless you appreciate its comedic value). Secondly, it lacks the variety of exercises and focuses on basic strength training without the cardio moves in between. The upper body routine only offers one exercise for biceps, triceps and shoulders which leaves one feeling as though they need to do more if they are accustomed to the One-on-One program.
Also, you'll need heavy weights as muscles don't fatigue as quickly with this workout.

I will use this video regularly because it still beats many of the other strength videos offered. I do hope she returns to her old style in her next video, even if she must flirt with the cast. And while we're at it, I'd like to request a decent cardio workout for those of us who like variety.",1263945600,,1025,4.423280423280423

Keep doing it, be persistent and you'll get results! Don't forget that diet is EXTREMELY important, so don't expect a 180 by using this dvd as the only method of changing your body composition, you must eat healthily!!!

THE NEGATIVES: Almost TOO fast-paced. Jackie moves very quickly through each of the moves, almost so quickly that it's quite difficult to keep up.

THE POSITIVES: Jackie gives great cues and explanations for each move. She's very encouraging and upbeat throughout the workout. The workout is broken down into circuits, targeting each area of the body with 4 moves, following by a ""Power Burn"" that combines each of the moves together. Each circuit on its own is just 15 minutes long, and you have the option to do the entire body circuit which is 40 minutes in length.

I love that you know what to expect with this workout, as you receive a brief overview/list of the moves you'll be doing and which body part they target. There is a brief warmup at the beginning and a great stretch at the end.

If i wanted to do those same moves, id use her last dvd--not buy a new one. Hamstrings were on FIRE for 3 days after this routine (probably the reverse planks!). This is definitely not for a beginner. I would recommend starting slow and adding new circuits in slowly if you don't workout frequently. The only thing I don't care for is how fast she moves. I know she likes to get ""as much bang for her buck"" as she can, but form and technique are just as important and its hard to focus on that when you are plowing through each exercise at 100 mph. I almost want to pause in between exercises just to go at my own pace. This seems to be her style though, so I guess i better get used to it!

But I love feeling fit and can achieve that with a good micro workout.  This dvd and Jackie Warner's other dvd-One-on-One--have short 15-20 minute workouts that are highly effective.  The exercises are intense, simple (only weights are required), do not require much room (no dancing), and don't hurt my back or my knees.  I like the cast in Power Circuit Training better than the cast in One-on-One.  I think Jackie Warner has perfected the micro workout and hope that she continues releasing similar workout dvds.",1262044800,,673,4.808695652173913

4579184,4,B0055OG9PQ,"After doing the 40 minute circuit yesterday, I honestly wasn't all that impressed.  As the workout is relatively short, each body part only gets 1-2 moves, but with multiple reps.  I finished the workout, sweaty, but not feeling like I had all that great of a workout.  However, I was in pain when I woke up this morning.  My legs, butt, and chest hurt the most.  I did, however, use heavier weights than shown in the video (10-12lbs).  For some, I might go up the next time I do this workout.

All in all, a good quickie workout.  Harder than it feels!",1261526400,3,553,4.352941176470588
4579185,5,B0055OG9PQ,"This is definitey not ""Sweatin to the Oldies"" which is the last fitness tape (yes, VHS) that I had done previous to working out with this DVD.  While my mom's workout got me moving when I was a younger, chubbier teen, I need something that makes me feel like I'm working for it.  And this DVD most certainly does.

I am not an avid exerciser.  I always want to be and feel better when I do, but I'm no fitness buff.  Coming off a two-year hiatus from exercising was difficult.  I'm an average build woman of normal weight & BMI, but I feel like I haven't used my muscles in years.  The first time I did this DVD, I found muscles I never knew existed let alone how sore they could become.  At the end of the first session, I had trouble walking down the stairs.  My legs were that shaky.

Yet, I felt like I accomplished something.  I actually did the first couple of sessions with large soups cans because I didn't have weights.  I still felt it in my arms (although nothing like when I started using 5 lb weights#.  I was sore and extremely muscle fatigued the first few times I did it.  However, that went away after a week, and now it just makes me want to exercise more.  Things are less challenging than at the start.

The great thing about this DVD is that there's always room to improve.  If you are no longer challenged, just add some more weight!  I have wimpy arms, so I won't be adding more weight for awhile.  However, it's nice that such an option exists.

A few final critiques #although, the pros far outway these cons):

- This can only be one component of your fitness routine.  Circuit training is wonderful and does give some cardio.  However, while you do raise your heart rate, you're not going to hit that ""target heart rate"" for maximal fat burn that everyone seems to be talking about these days.  Thus, as I build up strength and get used to exercising again, I plan on interspersing the days with some cardio.  On that note, you can't really do circuit training daily and get the maximal effect.  You need days in between sessions.  I guess that might not be a bad thing as it could prevent boredom.

- Stretching is way too short at the end.  As others have said, it's the only way she can fit everything into the DVD in 40 minutes.  I just ignore her stretching routine and do some of my own for a 5 minute cool down at the end.

- There are a few times that I wish she told the viewer exactly what muscle or area of the body was supposed to be feeling it.  She was great at some parts like the chest, but I've never really been shown what muscle groups I should be engaging with what exercised.

Make this DVD a part of your fitness routine!!!",1261526400,3,2672,4.258964143426295
4579186,5,B0055OG9PQ,"I have been working out for about 2 years. I have lost 80 pounds so far. I am not really in that good of shape, so I am trying to find exercises that I can do in my limited ability. I am not coordinated enough to do exercises with lots of movements like dancing. I bought The FIRM ultimate fat-burning workout, but I tried to keep up, I did it for about 4 minutes and gave up. What a waste of money, because I won't ever do that again. If you like that sort of workout fine, but not my cup of tea.

I bought Valerie Bertinelli's dvd, I love this one. It is easy to follow and its nice to see Valerie struggling a little too. I wanted a little harder workout and I saw Jackie's Dvd on tv and thought I would try it. I love it,Love it , love it. It's not easy, but there is no fancy steps, just a plain hard work out, and I could do it. I did struggle alittle. It's fast and just gets to the exercise. No stupid foot work. I did the 40 minute total body circuit first. It was just what I was looking for. I am soooooo happy to find this dvd.

So I am hooked on Jackie. Just can't wait so see the results, because this dvd I will definatly use again and again.",1261180800,8,1157,3.8776371308016877
4579187,4,B0055OG9PQ,"I have Jackie's previous DVD and find it a challenging workout. This new one is, if anything, even more challenging (in a good way). I was sore for about two days after doing the 40-minute workout for the first time. It's a simple concept: For each muscle group, there are three exercises that you do for a minute each, followed by the ""power burn,"" which is all three of the exercises in one minute. Then it's on to the next muscle group.... You will definitely feel it afterward. I recommend starting with the 15-minute total body workout before attempting the 40-minute one.",1261008000,2,577,4.666666666666667

I tried many of them but particularly this is one of my favorites. I having doing like 15 days and I start to see results, I feel fit and more toned. At the beginning I wasn't too optimistic because I'm aerobic fan and this program is just circuits without aerobics, but now I really love this kind of exercises. It is very balanced, you never feel that you can't go further, when part of your body get tired the next circuit works other parts of your body so you don't tempt to quit. You have the option to do a full 40 minutes exercises or break it into 15 minutes target moves.",1260921600,7,705,4.115942028985507

Despite doing my Workout video faithfully, I immediately felt a difference since doing the Personal Training w/ jackie video.  Have muscle soreness I haven't felt in a while.

I just completed this workout for the first time and I loved it! I have tried using Jillian Michaels' workouts, but I find them waaaaay too difficult. Jackie has created an intense and physically stressful workout, but it can actually be completed! I definitely felt the burn completing this workout, and I love how she focuses on one body part at a time. I have no doubt my body will change due to this workout!",1257724800,8,526,4.43298969072165
4579198,5,B0055OG9PQ,"This is a DVD for people who hate to work out. I'm an avid exerciser, but I can't say I love it. I work out because I have to to stay in shape. I do know that my body feels lousy if I don't work out, so I know I need it.

Anyway, this DVD is a godsend. The time just flies by. It is very fast paced but you know you are getting a good workout because you CAN FEEL THIS the next day and the day after and the day after....

I am a Jillian Michaels fan and I gotta say, Jackie gives her a run for her money here. Tons of bang for the buck, and all under 45 minutes! She hits all the major muscle groups and teaches you about them along the way, which ones are fat burners etc. Each circuit is about 4 minutes, you do three exercises, then the ""power burn"" which is the 3 exercises done all at once right after the other without stopping. I won't go into the exercises, as another reviewer has broken them down for you.

I know what you're thinking--do I really need ANOTHER workout DVD? Well if you're considering getting this DO IT!!!

These exercises are NEW--well to me they are, and I have an extensive fitness DVD collection. A few I have seen before but the majority I haven't. I even have jackie's first DVD and this new one blows that one out of the water. Gone are the cutesy, baby-voiced trainers, all made up. Now Jackie has REAL people working out with her and she does the work too. occasionally she does stop to check out form and educate you but she does every exercise with you. This is no nonsense folks. I do have to say, since this workout is a little condensed, the warm up and cool down leave a little to be desired. So if you like an extensive cool down after working out, pop in a short yoga set or something. Also, this is strictly strength, no cardio or cardio bursts, just some light joggging and jumping jacks in the warm up. So if you are expecting cardio you won't find it here.

And funnily enough, Jackie does a version of Jillian's ""Surrender"" from her No More Trouble Zones DVD. Jackie calls them UFCs here. However Jackie does them without weights, and I can actually do them! They are not hard on the knees at all! So if you guys are having trouble with Jillian's ""Surrender"" try it without weights. Believe me, you will still feel it!
As much as I love Jillian, I have to say I haven't popped her DVDs in since I got jackie's--it's that good! Granted once my body adapts and I don't feel it as much the next day I will probably add more Jillian back into my rotation.

Sorry to compare the two so much in this review but they are both very similar in their styles and if you're unfamiliar with Jackie, I want to give you a similar example.

All in all, a great workout and fast paced. And since it's about 40 mins long, it's not something you dread doing. You will not get bored with this and I bet you will feel it the next day. Thanks Jackie!",1257638400,261,2878,4.146953405017921

I picked up this DVD on a whim thinking it would sit and collect dust with the rest of my in-home work out DVD's, however something came over me one day and I decide to pop it in and give it a try. Not only was I blown away by how do-able each workout was (the 15 minutes circuit segments) but I also realized how out of shape I was while wiping the sweat from different areas of my body! I love being able to work different parts of my body at 15 minute intervals--it's so much better than committing to a treadmill or personal training session that usually is beyond brutal. Since I'm also very busy, these work outs are so great for when I'm in a time crunch! I can honestly say that this DVD has changed my work out mentality ENTIRELY! Slowly but surely, I'm trying to commit to doing at least 2/3 of the segments per week and boy is my body reaping the benefits!
