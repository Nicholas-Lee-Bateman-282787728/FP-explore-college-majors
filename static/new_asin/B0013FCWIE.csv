8250638,5,B0013FCWIE,"This is my new banjo toy. It is forcing me to play faster, even if it is slow. I didn't realize ""Cripple Creek"" was supposed to sound like in a jam until I heard them play it and had to speed up and slow down in places. I keep hearing you cannot learn to play the banjo without playing with other people. This is the next best thing, perhaps better, because Murphy and friends are endlessly patient and I can turn them off when it gets too frustrating.",1381881600,,452,4.1477272727272725
8250639,5,B0013FCWIE,"This is another in the long series of Murphy Method instructional DVD's. Quality of the video is excellent and Murphy Henry breaks each song down into smaller pieces or licks. Like all of her products there is banjo tab listings. She believes that tab listings slow down the learning process. I don't completely agree with this. For easy, short songs this works but when it comes to longer intermediate songs with complex passages I would like to have the tab in hard copy. Still this is an excellent product designed to help banjo players learn to play with a group. I highly recommend it for those that don't have an opportunity to jam with live groups very often.",1242172800,6,666,4.6525423728813555
