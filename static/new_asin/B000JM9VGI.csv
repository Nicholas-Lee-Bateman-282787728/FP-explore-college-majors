2678254,5,B000JM9VGI,Sharilyn's dvds are a must have for anyone interested in jewelry design. I was fortunate enough to take classes with this master teacher and purchased this dvd to reinforce what I had learned in class. It is easy to follow with clear step by step instructions. I love being able to pause the video while I make the wonderful jewelry pieces featured on the dvd. I own three of Sharilyn's dvds and her Bead on a Wire book and look forward to purchasing more of her instuctional guides in the future.,1218412800,2,497,4.472527472527473
2678255,5,B000JM9VGI,"I have all 4 of Sharilyn's DVD's and this is my personal favorite.  Watching these DVD's is like having your own personal teacher, and each skill learned prepares you for the next one.  I love that Sharilyn focuses on proper technique rather than just teaching the viewer how to make a duplicate of her sample piece of jewelry.

I have taken live classes with Sharilyn in Virginia as well as in California, and these DVD's are the next best thing to being in the front row of one of her live classes.
