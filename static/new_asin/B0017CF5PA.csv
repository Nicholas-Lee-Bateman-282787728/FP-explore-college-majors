8265533,4,B0017CF5PA,"THEYRE A WEIRD MOB ****
(1966, Australia, 107 min, colour, English subtitles, Aspect ratio: 4:3 Letterbox, Audio: Mono)
In 1960 Michael Powell made one of his greatest films, Peeping Tom. Nobody understood it and his career took a nosedive as he made his ignominious exit from Britain the following year with The Queens Guard. Two years later he was in Germany making Bluebeards Castle with his old collaborator Hein Heckroth and then three years after that in 1966 he disappeared down under to make two films, Theyre a Weird Mob and Age of Consent (1969). The first of these was a reunion for The Archers, Pressburger penning a comic script under the name Richard Imrie (Imre was his real first name) which spins happily on the old Archer theme of combining a love story with exploding national stereotypes. The final result is more than a little bizarre, but its humor was infectious enough to make it a huge success at the Australian box office to the extent that it was credited with reviving the moribund Australian film industry and sparking off the 1970s New Wave. Transparently a product of the 60s, the film aroused little interest elsewhere and is now largely of curiosity value only, but it is worth a watch for Powell/Pressburger lovers and is much more than just a sad footnote to their career.

The film is based on a book written by John OGrady under the pen name Nino Culotta which is also the name of the main character (Walter Chieri), an Italian immigrant journalist just off the boat from Napoli who has been promised a job as sports writer by his magazine-running cousin living in Sydney. Trouble is he cant speak let alone write English and his cousins done a runner leaving a large debt to pay to the office buildings owner Kay Kelly (Clare Dunne). Down on his uppers, Nino squats in the vacant office and gets a job with a local builder Joe (Ed Devereaux) laying foundations in order to pay back his cousins debt to Kay. Kay initially wants him evicted and deported, but his old fashioned ways melt her heart. Trouble is her Anglo-Irish dad (Chips Rafferty), also a builder, hates writers, brickies and dagos. The story is really the typical one of many an immigrant in Australia who arrive with nothing, enter a trade at the bottom, and then make something of themselves. This was the story of my own uncle more or less. Whats rich about the film is the endless stream of jokes had at the expense of dagos, ozzies and poms. Nino thinks the center of Sydney is Kings Bloody Cross thanks to a cabby and is soon learning all about sheilas and shouts. There are some nice scenes surrounding the lad as hes taken in by Joe and his wife, Nino treated deferentially by the lady of the house while her husband is used like a doormat. Excellent use is made of Sydney locations (if you want to know what the harbour was like before the opera house was built this is the film for you) with a stand-out scene on Bondi Beach as Nino swims into trouble, waves back at the lifeguards waving at him as a warning and ends up being rescued and the laughing stock of the beach. The film builds up nicely to a beautiful scene between prospective husband and soon-to-be father-in-law as the two shake each other down, the father eventually won over by realizing the Pope Himself is also a dago. Theres also a hilarious exploding meringue sequence which segues from old world (re British) afternoon tea to new world (re Aussie) breaking out the beers. The film isn't finally very significant, but then it doesnt intend to be. Powell/Pressburger are here simply enjoying themselves, having a bit of innocuous fun at everyones expense, and I defy anyone not to come away from the film grinning from ear to ear.",1490054400,,3711,4.631259484066768
8265534,3,B0017CF5PA,"This is a 50/50 film. The great bits are watching the builders and anyone that knows the way that world was (and knows their blue metal, smoko and who the fullback was for St George was) in Sydney suburbs at the time will have a laugh... the discussion about the jacket staying on or off on his first day digging is worth price of admission alone. In fact any of the 'blokey' parts are fantastic. So the downside? Anything to do with the women. As soon as this territory is ever entered, it's like encountering an interminable ad break for car insurance during some evergreen film on TV. The female aspect - no doubt tagged on to make it sell as a film - is really, really alien and boring... ironic as it's meant to be all about verisimilitude and being lighthearted.",1411776000,,768,4.415492957746479
8265535,3,B0017CF5PA,"Our friends sent this to us 38 years ago on VHS from Australia, however we never could watch it because it was for region 4. We bought a multi region dvd player so when I saw this I bought it for my husband.",1406419200,,207,3.8372093023255816
8265536,4,B0017CF5PA,"This movie version of the book titled They're a Weird Mob was made in 1966, and, as well as sticking roughly to the novel's plot, is a marvellous snapshot of Sydney  in the 1960's. Hair styles and wardrobe fashion are especially delightful to see. Nino is well played by Walter Chiari, Graham Kennedy appears for a brief cameo and the cast includes very young versions of John Mellion, Chips Rafferty, Ed Devereaux, Tony Bonner, Barry Creyton and Noel Brophy. Hilarious .",1377648000,,471,4.814814814814815
8265537,4,B0017CF5PA,"Seeing this movie nearly 40 years after its release in theatres, I have to admit that it's a bit dated, but what a wonderful line up of Australian actors from both the large and small screens there is! Nino Cullotta, played by Italian actor Walter Chiari, comes to Australia under the sponsorship of his cousin, to work as a sports editor for an Italian newspaper only to find that his cousin has left the country and that the newspaper has closed down. Needing work, he takes a job as a bricklayer's labourer and luckily falls in with a group of honest, hardworking men and their wives who take him under their wings. The main joke is the difference between the English language which is taught in Europe and the colloquial English as it is spoken by Australian working class men and women. It still gave me a few laughs but now seems a bit too outdated to be really funny.",1217462400,3,874,4.46875
