4854492,4,B005OT822U,"Nice is the word. I grew up watching all the three SHAFT movies( Shaft, Shaft's big Score, Shaft in Africa ). I did not know there was a series on Shaft. Thank God now I have the collection.",1408406400,2,190,4.026315789473684
4854493,5,B005OT822U,"Since the original Shaft movie in 1972, I've always enjoyed Richard Roundtree in this role. I well remember when the short-lived Shaft TV series was on. It's so nice to view these episodes all over again for the sake of nostalgia.",1401667200,4,230,4.634146341463414
4854494,4,B005OT822U,"I've watched the first three of these Shaft TV movies from the 70s, and I must say I've found them more interesting than most of the detective shows from that era; and I've seen them all. It's fascinating to see so many character actors from that period getting work in these Shaft TV movies. Also, these shows give Richard Roundtree an opportunity to demonstrate that he has a wider acting range than he was allowed to exhibit in the theatrical films. Yes, he is much more buddy-buddy with Lt. Al Rossi than he was with Lt. Vic Androzzi; but that is more realistic because in reality one hand washes the other. The way Shaft treated Lt. Androzzi was something that stretched credulity in the theatrical films. As for getting in people's faces, the TV Shaft is still very hard on criminals, once even killing two of them with a handgun he had bought illegally while under suspension! This Shaft shows more emotional intelligence because he's able to get along with a wider range of people. The character of John Shaft is much more well-rounded and human here than the trash-talking tough guy in the films. One more thing, as a native New Yorker, I love all the exteriors of on-location street scenes from the Big Apple back in the 1970s. Wow! The city really has changed! I am glad I bought this set and look forward to watching the remaining TV movies in this collection.",1394236800,,1372,4.604081632653061
4854495,5,B005OT822U,The movies starring Richard Roundtree were urban gritty. The TV movie collection is tame but still is good example of the Hardboiled Private Eye genre.,1375401600,2,151,5.08
4854496,5,B005OT822U,Well here I don't that in Australia but I remember the short series along time ago. Richard Roundtree reprise his role the Movie Shaft which should had sequels.,1370736000,,160,4.75
4854497,3,B005OT822U,"I should have known before i bought this how STUPID TV execs can be!
Shaft was a ground breaking blaxploitation film that featured the black man and his hood and brought it to the big screen and the black man cheered!
  This TV version is a castrated Shaft hanging with an all white cast, all white characters, they totally lost the black audience and the white man didn't care much for Shaft, at least not for a sterile Shaft who hangs with white folk and acts and talks white. So typical of how stupid corp America can be. This could have been a huge tv series, no wonder they cancelled it after just 7 episodes. They are 73 mins each, I thought at first ""great!, I'm getting 7 Shaft films!"". I did but they are pretty lame, watchable but lame.",1367280000,5,746,4.321428571428571
4854498,5,B005OT822U,"When I first saw the original three Shaft movies I didn't even know these TV movies existed. Finding out they did was like discovering Sean Connery played James Bond in a TV series years ago that had long been forgotten. Admittedly you don't get the same raw appeal of the movies, but still you have Richard Roundtree, still looking great and oozing charisma, in seven new stories! A few of them feel as if they just plugged Shaft into an existing 70's TV mystery that could have been as easily occupied by Cannon or McCloud or any number of TV detectives, but most of them at least come close to the action content of the movies (if on a smaller budget and being careful not to get too bloody). Even the lesser ones are enjoyable if you like the familiarity of 70's TV and all those faces you've seen a million times even if you don't know their names. So I enjoyed the set quite a bit. Oh - and if you miss the use of Isaac Hayes's iconic theme song in the two follow-up movies here they made ample use of it throughout all the stories!",1354233600,13,1038,4.274111675126903
4854499,5,B005OT822U,"This long forgotten TV spin off from the 3 Shaft Movies - Shaft (1971), Shaft's Big Score! (1972) and Shaft In Africa (1973) - comes at last to DVD courtesy of Warner's Archive Collection.

Why long forgotten? Many fans of the movies complained that the TV version of Shaft was toned down too much from the character on the big screen - his prickly relationship with Lt Vic Anderozzi was replaced by a buddy buddy friendship with Lt Al Rossi, his trendy turtleneck sweaters and leather jackets were ditched in favour of conservative shirts, ties, suits and even pullovers!, and worst of all, he was no longer an in-your-face-up-yours tough black private eye, but merely a private eye who happened to be black. The violence was toned right down and the sex was reduced to zero.

Is this, fans asked, really our Shaft?

Well this series was made in 1973 and in those days American TV was ultra-conservative. Richard Roundtree himself, in response to these criticisms, said that the movie Shaft could not be reproduced on TV.

Once you accept that, this series is very enjoyable for anyone who likes the movies and Roundtree himself is on top form. I saw this myself back at the time and it was my introduction to the Shaft character. I've wanted to see it again since the 70s and here it is.

Don't expect the rawness of the movies, but enjoy 7 more adventures of John Shaft.",1344297600,20,1373,4.610655737704918
8481789,4,B005OT822U,"This release collects all seven Shaft telefilms, which might not be as gritty as the theatrical Shaft entries, but are still fun to watch. Fans of 70s cop shows will find a lot to like here as well, with a lot of the usual tropes and conventions explored. Shaft battles an impressive assortment of villains like Tony Curtis, Clu Gulager, Darren McGavin, Robert Culp, and others. Good casts and Richard Roundtree is charismatic as always, giving us more Shaft adventures. The movies look good, with little signs of wear of debris. So seven movies at a reasonable price, this collection is well recommended.",1509148800,,605,4.883495145631068
