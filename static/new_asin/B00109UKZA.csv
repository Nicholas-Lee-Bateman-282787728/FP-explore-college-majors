8237421,3,B00109UKZA,"A 2004 horror film from China, one of the early films of the hot international film star Shu Qi, as well as Karen Mok. 3 ghost stories that centers around an office building, overall not a bad keeper. The first story is with Karen Mok, the best of the 3 stories in my opinion. Second story is with the HOT Shu Qi, playing as an evil ghost. The third story is the more funny one with the office ghosts. In widescreen/5.1 surround sound with english subtitles.",1388534400,,458,4.337209302325581
