5057298,5,B00761ELQ0,"To bad it is only 32 minutes. Roy was totally into his show, I don't think he even knew the crowd was present.",1375833600,,110,3.8260869565217392
5057299,5,B00761ELQ0,The degree of taste and expertise displayed by Roy is unmatched by anyone. Done back in the 70s without twanger bar or any pedals or digital help makes him even more masterful. Truly amazing.,1366243200,,191,4.647058823529412

5057301,5,B00761ELQ0,"I have always loved Roy Buchanan.  He was one of the best guitarists ever. This DVD will not disappoint you if you are a true fan.  His performance was great and he truly made the guitar sing, cry and wail.  It actually brought a tear to my eyes.  There are not many documented performances of him.  Although it is very short with only five songs, it is a real treasure.",1356825600,2,370,4.228571428571429

8510712,5,B00761ELQ0,"This is Roy Buchanan at his fiery best. On stage he appears to be a quiet humble man who stands quietly on stage with an occasional smile. When he takes on a guitar solo he plays with such fire and power it is mesmerising to watch. The audience in a very intimate setting sit with their mouths open in wonder.

This is a special performance of some very passionate music by a man who deserves to be up there with the best of them.",1402358400,,430,4.119047619047619
8510713,3,B00761ELQ0,"Very good performance and swell played, altough in my humble opinion
way, way too short for a DVD with this Quality.

Always good to have a live performance of a great guitarist!
