8084266,4,B000BB1MQ4,"This DVD disc features four cartoon episodes that incorporate characters, music, and visual elements from the 1939 movie ""The Wizard of Oz."" At the same time, each episode is a self-contained short adventure. Among the various characters, Glinda the good witch is attractive and has blond hair. On the other hand, the blue-headed (and not to mention villainous) winged monkeys are nowhere near as attractive. Some of the music is enjoyable, though there is also music that is negative. (For instance, the ""enemy attack"" tune is quite negative. From what one remembers, this same tune is played in the 1939 movie when Dorothy's friends are being chased by the guards in the wicked witch's castle.)

Of the four episodes, ""Upside Downtown"" is probably the best episode, with ""Hot Air"" as the second best and ""Dream a Little Dream"" (which is indicated as being a ""bonus"" episode) as the third best. In ""Dream a Little Dream,"" there is a quite humorous part near the end after the witch confronts Dorothy's group.

For the Wizard of Oz episodes, the disc provides a Spanish language soundtrack in addition to the normal English language soundtrack. Unfortunately, the disc does not appear to feature any subtitles or closed captioning. Included on the disc are previews for a number of other DIC Entertainment productions.

Note: Many (but not all) commercial DVD discs incorporate technological measures that may restrict the ability to access and/or reuse DVD content even when access and/or reuse is permitted by law. (For instance, extracting a small portion of DVD content for use in conjunction with a critical commentary may be inhibited.) I do not know the extent (if any) to which the DVD disc ""The Wizard of Oz: We're Off to Save the Wizard"" incorporates such technological restrictions.",1281830400,3,1793,5.050675675675675
8084267,4,B000BB1MQ4,"This dvd is part of the animated series. It is one I enjoyed years ago and all but forgot! My daughter and I were in the movie rental store and saw one on video and rented it for her- she loved it!! Since then I have been on the hunt to find them for her and purchase them. She is a Wizard of Oz fanatic.
 This episodes on this dvd are funny at times, a bit perilous others - the witch is as evil as ever!!
 For Oz fans, and children alike, it is very entertaining.",1241395200,2,465,3.8333333333333335
