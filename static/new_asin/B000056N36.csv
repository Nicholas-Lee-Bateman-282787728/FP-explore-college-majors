7932243,1,B000056N36,How could Amazon allow this to be sold. It is absolutely useless. A video of children drawing and that's it. This author should be ashamed. I didn't realize it was only 13mins. I can't in all good conscience give even one star! I had to hit one star or this message wouldn't post. Do not order this.,1478649600,,299,4.2631578947368425
7932244,5,B000056N36,"The Art Made Easy video series includes about 6 or 7 videos aimed for middle school age students. They deal with drawing the human form, perspective, framing and displaying, art history and how to approach an art subject.  The lessons are short, concise, and memorable. The best thing is that they are practical -- especially for students who have not tried art before.  I found these videos are good for art activities in nursing homes.",1320364800,2,437,4.8133333333333335
