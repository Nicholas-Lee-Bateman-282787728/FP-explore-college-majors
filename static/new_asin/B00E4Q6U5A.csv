8601037,5,B00E4Q6U5A,"Not only is this a classic Yanks series, and great to have every game, but the set includes the radio play-by-play! For me, who is visually impaired, this is amazing! I hope MLB Productions puts out the 96, 98 and 99 sets soon!",1381276800,4,227,4.3023255813953485
8601038,3,B00E4Q6U5A,"I was so happy to finally be able to get these games on DVD as this is one of my favorite Yankees World Series victories. Imagine my disappointment when I put the first game in the DVD player and am greeted with a gaudy, gigantic and non-removable MLB logo in the upper right hand corner of the screen for THE ENTIRE GAME.

Pathetic and completely unnecessary and it really mars what otherwise would be a decent collection of great World Series games.

It's a shame that brain dead companies like MLB Productions are so worried about  ""piracy"" that they'd deliberately piss off their paying customers by mangling the video presentation like this. There are times when this graphic is directly over the batter's face which is simply inexcusable.

5 stars for the games, 1 star for the BS non-removable logo on the screen. Averages out to 3 stars.",1381190400,17,845,4.6891891891891895
