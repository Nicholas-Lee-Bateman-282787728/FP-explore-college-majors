8222026,5,B000WBFFO8,"First of all, this is a typical AirUtopia DVD; the viewer gets a few minutes narration about the airport at the beginning and then no more narration or captions for the rest of the video.  I'd suggest this DVD for those with knowledge about different aircraft types so that planes can be identified as they land, take-off, and taxi.  At the very least, just be ready to be content with watching airport ops.  The camera angles were quite good and the palm trees and nearby seaside are very atmospheric.

What surprised me in the video was that widebody airliners delivering loads of tourists were a minority of the aircraft operating - though there were 767's, 777's, DC-10's, and 747 ""classics"".  Instead, there's a lot of footage of 717's, 737's, cargo aircraft, and even Air National Guard fighter planes.  Day, twilight, night, and multiple cloud cover shots add variety to the view.

Two short flashback video's show air ops from the 1980's and the 1960's at Honolulu.  Pretty neat.",1394755200,,987,4.833333333333333
8222027,2,B000WBFFO8,"This DVD is long and not narrated... and is not a documentary.
Lots of planes here, but cut out the repeated footage (some several times) and unnecessary filler scenes - and this video could be a decent half hour.
The quality of the packaging and presentation is average at absolute best.
However, if you are into sitting at the airport and watching planes for hours on end - perhaps you will be more interested in this video than I was.",1312070400,,437,4.475
