It helped her learn her vowel sounds--plus the music is pretty jamming! ;-) I think it's pretty funny (which is a plus when you have to see it over and over again.) She loves the app so much I bought her the DVD as well. We're watching it right now, as I type, and she's saying her sounds and letters along with the characters. I cannot recommend this DVD--and the entire LeapFrog video/app series--strongly enough. I'd give it six stars if I could.",1325721600,,576,4.495238095238095

I wish leap frog had more videos with these characters, since my daughter has become attached to them. It would be nice if they made another on vowels that was a step up from this one. I like how the words are displayed and highlighted as they are said so that my daughter can track with the reading. Both vowels and tracking are two things we are working on for kindergarten.",1321920000,,546,4.160377358490566

4499809,5,B004YK29BK,"My 2-1/2 year old just loves the Sing and Learn with Us! DVD.  The songs, that teach short vowel sounds, are groovy enough and short enough to keep her attention and she loves to dance along.  She is even starting to pick up some simple spelling from the cute monster characters sounding out three-letter words and simultaneously holding up letter signs.

As mentioned in other reviews, Tad, Leap, and Lily are nowhere to be found in this DVD.  Also, the animation is cute but is not the traditional style of the other LeapFrog offerings.  Still, my daughter loves this DVD and it is an effective learning tool.",1314144000,6,611,4.672897196261682
4499810,4,B004YK29BK,"I'm pretty sure there is no such thing as a BAD Leap Frog DVD. :) My 3.5 year old son enjoyed it, but kept asking ""Where are the frogs?"" lol. It even kept my 18 month old's attention too!",1312243200,3,187,3.8205128205128207

This video is totally different than the originals.  I suggest getting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LeapFrog-Leapster-Educational-Video-The-Letter-Factory/dp/B001KUANRY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LeapFrog Leapster Educational Video: The Letter Factory</a>&nbsp;first and then purchasing this video.  The Letter Factory focuses on Letters and the sounds they make.  The Letter Factory is the best DVD for teaching your kids what pre-phonics skills, in my opinion. Sing and Learn with us is a nice DVD to show once the Letter FActory has been viewed.

Sing and Learn with us includes new characters; Al, Og, Meg, Izzy and Gus.  These toe-tapping characters perform 12 animated sing-along shorts focusing on developmental reading skills; such as, short vowels, phonics skills (word building) and comprehension - skills perfect for the preschool to first grade crowd.  Great for those kiddos that have some knowledge of the sounds letters make and who are ready to start building CVC words.  The music included is fun and catchy, and it's easy for kids to follow along on the screen with the words being highlighted as you go.  It is nice to always see all the words on the bottom of the screen.  A beginning reader can follow along and read while watching.  My Pre-K child enjoyed the DVD very much.  It is 30 minutes and it seems to cover enough material without overwhelming the child with too much details.

The DVD also doubles as a DVD-ROM, where if you put the DVD into your computer drive, you'll be able to access 12 printable sing-along storybooks and 3 printable coloring sheets too!  The activities are a perfect way to continue learning and having fun!!!",1311120000,35,2079,5.909698996655519
4499812,5,B004YK29BK,"From the images, this is a different packaging of Sing along read along. Only difference is that it doesn't comes with the booklets in sing along read along.

Sing along read along was the first Leapfrog DVD I've gotten for my 2 years old son and he is obsessed with Leapfrog since then. He will say ""frog, frog"" daily and point to where the DVD is or trying to on the DVD player.

This DVD is different from the other Leapfrog DVD. This contains short stories about Al, Og, Meg, Izzy, Gus and with quite a few short songs. Perfect for young children who is not interested in 30 stories with only two to three 3 mins songs.",1309824000,3,623,4.271186440677966
4499813,5,B004YK29BK,"MAY 10 2011:
Although I'm a fan of Leapfrog Leapster2 and Explorer, I never ever thought of buying Leapfrog DVD's. Simply because I wasn't familiar with the characters. That changed when I saw a good deal on Amazon for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LeapFrog-Learning-DVD-Set/dp/B002LYD2M6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LeapFrog: Learning DVD Set</a>&nbsp;and decided to try it. I was very surprised with how our 6 year old reacted to that set of dvd's. He liked them a lot, watches them regularly, and learns from them.

Based on that experienced, and since our 6 yol, likes music, singing and even dancing,.... we're planning to get this new dvd. Again, the characters depicted on the cover, seems quite odd to me (I look at the cover, and Halloween comes to mind). And kind of more in the range for 3-4 year old kids. Because of my perception, I normally would not buy this dvd, ... but since the surprise with the previous dvd set, .... I think it's worth a try. I will update this review, and if needed also the star rating, in due time.

UPDATE 19 July 2011:
Got the dvd. It's fun, and entertaining, for young kids. Perhaps more so for kids 3-5. They learn through singing a long. The songs are quite catchy. Our 6 yol, enjoyed it, altough he also wanted to watch other dvd's. So I'm thinking the younger your kids, the more they will like it.

Apparently this is a 'remake' of an earlier Leapfrog dvd, ""Sing-along Read-along"", but this newer version, has a new set of characters. The ""Sing-along Read-along"" dvd, came with a booklet with songs, but with the ""Sing and Learn with us"" version, you can download 12 Sing-along storybooks, so the your kids will be able to take the songs where ever they go.",1304985600,7,1750,4.925423728813559

I don't think a child that wasn't overly interested in language would find it amusing at all though, so be warned.",1451692800,,388,4.63768115942029

4499821,5,B004YK29BK,"The video does a good job of introducing kids to phonics.  When my son was a about 2 1/4, he already knew the alphabet backwards and forwards as well as the basic sounds of letters, so we had him watch this video as a next step.  He picked up on the spellings and concepts very quickly, and he was able to start sounding out some simple words.  It worked incredibly well.

As a parent who has had to suffer through kids' videos played hundreds of times apiece, this one is refreshing because my wife and I actually liked it.  After I played it the first time, I had to play it again.  The artwork is 1950s flat design, and the music is based upon some very retro 50's and early 60s melodies as well as popular songs such as Blitzkrieg Bop and Cat Scratch Fever, but altered enough so as not to infringe on copyrights.",1424563200,,817,4.2387096774193544

4499824,2,B004YK29BK,"As others have said, this is not up to the quality of the average Leap Frog video. What I like: this video quite clearly shows how words are built from letters. What I don't like: confusing scenes such as showing the letter ""e"", but having the characters go ""sh, sh, sh"" and THEN giving the ""eh"" sound. As much as I LOVE what they have done well in this video, I don't want my toddler watching learning DVDs that muddy the waters.",1409443200,,430,4.2560975609756095

I have no idea why since I first played it he knew which one it is and always brings the same dvd and ask me to play it over and over. He also learnt to play the disk  by himself as he was so in to it. I think this was the cheapest of them all and they teach a lot of words in songs I believe what kids really like.

4499826,4,B004YK29BK,"As pure entertainment, no, this isn't the best DVD for kids. But for encouraging kids who are beginning to read, it's great. My child is beginning to read, and if he weren't, I don't think he'd be very interested in this video as compared to, say, a PBS cartoon. As an early reader, though, it is interesting to him because he is curious about the process of reading. It's slower than some of the other leap frog DVDs, but it has to be in order to allow children to absorb the different sounds and letter combinations that are simultaneously being sung and displayed on the bottom of the screen. I don't expect this DVD to teach him how to read, but it seems to inspire him and reinforces some of the concepts we've been working on.",1404172800,3,732,4.389705882352941

4499835,5,B004YK29BK,"My son didn't have any experience with Leapfrog DVDs and characters when we bought this DVD so I think it helped with his not being disappointed. Think of this more like a phonics/reading chapter of a School House Rock kind of video. It isn't really a story, its 12 songs that cover all of the vowel sounds (short a, long a, etc). When we bought this, we bought the books and DVD pack. As my son read the books, we would watch the DVDs. This helped him gain mastery of the different vowel sounds and he loved the catchy music.

To avoid some of the disappointment others feel, realize this is not a Tad, Lilly and the gang show. This is also NOT a story DVD. This is a sing along DVD. That's it. It has books you learn to read and sing alongs that go with it. We started my son on this after knowing the letters and while learning the sounds they make. He was 4. He is almost 6 and he still loves it (the way we all love nostalgic things from our past).",1391385600,5,953,4.096256684491979

4499840,5,B004YK29BK,"My 2 1/2 yr old has known his alphabet for some time. I have been trying to figure out how to advance from that point, and came across this video. It is superb. Why? Because the version I have has captions on the bottom in English that he can read along with. It has short little dance and song clips with lots of simple words, mostly rhyming. It's a lot of fun and keeps his attention. But not just limited to using words, this includes contextual clues, and several different definitions. For example ""Dig"" as in ""digging with a rig"" (digging with a large digger truck) and ""dig"" in the groovy sense as in ""liking something a lot"" (a dancing pig that looks like elvis). Thru repetition and tone variance this is a great way to show kids sounds and words so that they gather new comprehension of words, as well as how to spell them. the words are generally simple enough for kids that age to understand already, or have come into contact, so they aren't complicated or foreign concepts at all.",1375488000,,994,4.437158469945355

From an adult perspective, I have seen the progress of my niece with the way she expresses herself and of course the basic education she is gaining.
As a parent myself, I recommend that you spend time with your child while viewing these programs.  Whilst they are pitched for the child to view alone I always believe in parents being part of the learning process.
If you are considering this purchase, take a look at it first and determine if your child is ready for it. We purchased over 8 of the Leapfrog learning DVDs and no regrets thus far.",1327622400,7,693,4.290076335877862

8448418,5,B004YK29BK,"My son is three years old and has high functioning autisim (what used to be known as aspergers).  As such, finding anything that will capture his attention for more than a few minutes can be challenging.  However, he has a fascination with letters and numbers, and we find he learns best with music. This DVD was perfect for him!  The first time I played it, he gazed at the screen practically motionless for the entire 32 minutes, and the second it ended he begged me for more. In fact we watch the DVD four times in a row before I finally dragged him away!  Within days he was going around very proudly sounding out words!

I  had originally borrowed his DVD from the library, and after seeing how hooked on it he was over the course of the week, I had to buy it!  He watches it at least once or twice every day and always is asking for it.  Each time he seems to pick up more, and he enjoys reading along with the words he knows.

If you are looking for high quality graphics, this may not be the right leapfrog video for you.  But as a learning tool that is appealing to three year olds and can capture their minds, it can't be beat! If you have a child who drawn to shows like Word World, or who knows most of their alphabet and is starting to show interest in reading and picking up simple sight words, I strongly recommend this DVD!  I believe that even children who love singing and dancing will immediately be drawn in,  even if they aren't quite ready for the content.",1489017600,,1478,4.258064516129032
