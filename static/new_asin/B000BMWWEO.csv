8466323,4,B000BMWWEO,"Very good look at Ronaldinho's career. The teams he played for since Gremio, Paris Saint Germain and Barcelona, including a little bit of Brazil. Interesting interviews and good highlights. The picture could be a lot better, but just by seeing Ronaldinho in action, you forget the image quality. There are more highlights of him playing for Barca that could've been thrown in there, but good enough. I loved it!",1129507200,17,411,4.971014492753623
