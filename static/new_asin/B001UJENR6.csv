it is must if you planning to travel to london
good tips and advices",1261353600,,97,3.9
3801582,5,B001UJENR6,The images are stunning. It is in 1080i but still looks fantastic. Very informative. Rudy Maxa is interesting to listen to and he gives good tips for travelling in the areas he documents. I felt I had to review this blu-ray when I saw one of the two reviews showing a one star review because the person apparantly didn't update their firmware for their Sony laptop computer and had problems watching the disk and rated this one star.  They dinged all 3 blu-ray videos in this series for the same reason. There are other titles in this series including England and Italy which are also filmed beautifully and are interesting. Also video is 16:9 and not 1.33:1. Beautiful widescreen.,1247875200,17,681,4.722689075630252
3801583,5,B001UJENR6,"I couldn't wait to see how the Rudy Maxa series would look in hi-def- it was well worth the wait.

Fantastic transfer on the France disc- rich bold colors, excellent detail, didn't notice a trace of video noise or artifacting.  Note- the Amazon description lists this series (France, Italy, England) as being in 1:33 aspect ratio- they are NOT!  Full 16x9/- glorious!

If you love the Maxa series/and or France, you will love this disc- an absolute no-brainer.

5 stars- highly recommended!",1242086400,35,490,4.926829268292683
3801584,5,B001UJENR6,"This is a simply stunning 1080 blue ray demo material , I find Rudy Maxa  very relaxing to listen to and watch, The definition just takes you there so lovely not rushed its very well done I didn't know Rudy Maxa  before viewing this needless to say I will seek his other work out",1407456000,,279,4.148148148148148
3801585,5,B001UJENR6,"Rudy is at his best when he mixes art with travel.  He showed the countryside and linked it with various artists, it was all very well done, and I gave the dvd which came with the blu ray to a friend, a retired curator of a small art gallery, who also greatly enjoyed it.",1388620800,,271,4.018518518518518

3801588,2,B001UJENR6,please no more rudy maxa. I would not have bought this disc if I was aware that this was a guided tour. I only want to see the places of interest. Not a review of the wine and cheeses.,1358380800,,184,3.7435897435897436
3801589,1,B001UJENR6,"All the blu-ray clarity in the world can't make up for inconsistent video editing, rushed pacing and poor camera composition.

If you are buying this (notably) inexpensive feature in hopes of luxurious, stunning footage of French architecture, historical sites and beautiful countryside in 1080p... (like ""Planet Earth"" quality shots) take my advice and pass.

The pacing is rushed & the vast majority of the camera shots (which move along too fast for this type of feature) show unremarkable views and locations.  No slow pans... no long establishing shots... few aerial views... The voice-over narration falls short as well.  While he names the buildings/locations and sometimes offers a brief factoid, it fails to intrigue the listener, and only aids in the footage feeling ""rushed through"".

You can mute the audio, sure, but beware, your host will appear on-camera numerous times (in 1080p!) in stand-ups (that's what they call 'em in the biz) that seem to be the ONLY shots that drag on too long.  Insult to injury, mon ami.

Not only would I recommend avoiding this one in the series, but ALL in this series, as I can't imagine it being any better for other locations/countries.

If you purchase it:
Pros
-The cover looks great!
-It didn't cost a ton!
-You can donate it to your local library!
-It gets 4-5 star reviews from other people!
Cons
-It's really bad
-$12 is still $12",1355961600,4,1385,4.914163090128755
3801590,3,B001UJENR6,"I got this back in the summer of 2012 & haven't watched it since, but I do remember that the content was ok,but not the blu-ray quality. I don't get to travel & I do like to watch travel shows on parts of the world I'll probably never get to. If you are going to France any time soon this would be ok to watch to get an idea of what to expect. I bought the blu-ray hoping that I would feel like I was right there. Not the case. I was rather disappointed with the quality & that could be why I haven't re-watched it. The price was right but not the quality.",1351036800,4,556,3.8859649122807016
3801591,5,B001UJENR6,Very very informative!  if you can't make France as a trip...this is the next best thing!!!  I highly recommend!  The scenery in beautiful.  The host makes it interesting to watch without dozing off.,1341792000,,199,4.9393939393939394
3801592,2,B001UJENR6,Very short and not worth the money by any means.  I would not recommend this or any other CDs by this person or company unless you have more money than brains.,1331683200,2,159,4.129032258064516
