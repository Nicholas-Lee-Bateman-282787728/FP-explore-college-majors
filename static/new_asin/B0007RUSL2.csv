2238856,5,B0007RUSL2,"The Boston Strangler is now available on Blu-ray disc in Europe but if you don't have a region free or unlocked Blu-ray player, this DVD remains a great buy, especially for its low price. Richard Fleisher's use of the fragmented screen aesthetics remains of the most innovative, brilliant and daring ever puts to screen and for any film aficionados, film students, film historians, just because of this, The Boston Strangler is a must see movie. But that's not all, because Fleisher, with his use of dark and gritty colors obviously inspired the dark urban cinema that would follows in the 70s and early 80s (The Boston Strangler's creepiness is all over William Lustig's Maniac if you ask me). The film is divided in two parts: the eluding serial killer's chase and then his detention and questioning. Both are fascinating. Both are cruel and disheartening. The ending is a punch to the stomach. It is a raw form of American cinema ripped between the old guard of Hollywood's classicists and the forthcoming New Hollywood. It is a masterpiece.

Sure, this is all about the film, because the supplements on the DVD aren't particularly impressive: you get trailers, teasers and a short (although very interesting) featurette about the making of the movie. I have no complaints about the image but to tell you the truth, after seeing the Blu-ray, I must say the latter offers the  nec plus ultra  when it comes to the cinematography and the brilliant use of the colours. But no matter what, I have no grievances and I do think the image treatment on the DVD is very good and still respectable.

Do yourself a favour and buy this movie right now.",1421193600,,1643,4.774647887323944
2238867,5,B0007RUSL2,"Even though he doesn't appear until the last third of the film, Tony Curtis justly gets star billing in THE BOSTON STRANGLER (1968) for his amazing performance while under interrogation. That entire sequence was easily his best acting work.

Henry Fonda co-stars as John Bottomly, a law professor drafted by Massachusetts Attorney General Edward Brooke to head a Strangler task force. Bottomly also interrogated Albert DeSalvo after the serial killer's arrest. In the movie, Fonda questions Curtis but is mostly off-camera. These sessions were a delicate task, for DeSalvo was a classic dual-personality and if his ""normal"" self was forced to confront his evil side, there was a good chance he'd totally withdraw and remain in a catatonic state. The film ends leaving this possibility in the air, but hinting that it may have occurred.

Early on, Richard Fleischer, this picture's director, used a series of annoying on-screen windows, as many as six at once, but that ill-conceived cinematic technique was dropped after a couple of reels for straight visual storytelling. The film benefits greatly from this switch to the orthodox, and the viewer is drawn into the story (at least I was!).

Also in a terrific cast are George Kennedy, Mike Kellin, Hurd Hatfield, Murray Hamilton, Jeff Corey and Sally Kellerman, as the all-important survivor of a Strangler attack. She also turns in a most convncing performance, evoking much sympathy from a viewer.",1416787200,2,1450,5.188034188034188

2238876,5,B0007RUSL2,"""The Boston Strangler"" was savagely criticized in a review by Roger Ebert, who says (as can be read on the Wikipedia page) that ""the movie should not have been made at all."" What he means here is that he has a serious problem with taking a nonfiction source (the excellent book by Gerold Frank) and translating it into the film medium, a source of entertainment whose purpose is to give pleasure rather than facts. But in the case of Curtis's electrifying performance, I would argue that the film is both entertaining and disturbing, and director Fleischer keeps a quasi-documentary feel going throughout so that one does not become completely overwhelmed by the exuberance of knowing that this is a fictionalization of serious subject matter. Curtis may not have been robbed of his Oscar (please, Tony, those awards are fixed, so political as to be a parody of themselves), but he probably was robbed of a Golden Globe award, seeing as to how his fellow craftsmen (and craftswomen) should have recognized his skill in working in their profession. Edward Anhalt (who did once win Oscars for his great screen stories) was robbed of his Edgar Award for his screenplay adaptation, though, because he does a good job of keeping the mystery storytelling going by using the proper amounts of dialogue, humor, and shocking details to move along the case. A dark, fascinating story that provides an opportunity for future film historians to see a memorable, startling turn by Curtis, and a terrifically subdued one from Fonda.
The DVD includes the AMC Backstory episode, which has footage of the real DeSalvo case, as well as words from Richard Zanuck and a clearly disappointed Tony Curtis (who seemed to want more out of his movie career than he ever successfully received). As far as picture and sound are concerned, this is a good enough transfer, perhaps one that could have been sharper, but overall pretty good and in widescreen. Is ""The Boston Strangler"" a good exploitation title? This is a question of taste, of course, but for me it has the feel of a nostalgic, memorable police procedural that does not quite deplete the seriousness of this true life case with its entertainment-driven structure.

2238887,5,B0007RUSL2,"Ok, I am a Tony Cutis fan.  But I can be objective if he plays in a bad movie, he has made some.  I didn't know he made a movie like this and I have to say I really enjoyed his performance and this movie.  The movie does split screen sceens and I found this very interesting.  I don't know if it is for everybody.  But this movie is on my favorite list now.  I never seen him do a bad guy before in this way, he certainly did impress me.",1390867200,2,437,3.7472527472527473

2238894,4,B0007RUSL2,"Glad I bought this DVD, but the movie wasn't as engrossing as I had recalled from seeing it in its time.",1378252800,,104,4.0
2238895,4,B0007RUSL2,"I wasn't even born when the real Boston Strangler began murdering women in the early 60s.  But I vaguely remember seeing this film probably 40 years ago; I think that a version for television released in the early 70s, most likely.  But I was still too young to understand most of it at the time.

And I vaguely remember the split-screen technique that was used in this film.  Now, I understand some of the pragmatic, and ever artistic, motivations for this technique -- it's easier to show people's reactions to scenes simultaneously, and it's mirroring the so-called dual personality of DeSalvo -- but I still feel that this technique was a mistake.  It is certainly distracting, and that's most likely why almost no director would use this today, minus a scene or two here or there.

Now, if you believe that ""one hand didn't know what the other hand was doing"" with regards to Mr. Desalvo, that he had two distinct personalities, and the ""tame"" one didn't know what the ""killer"" one was doing. . . .  I have my standard reaction:  I have some oceanfront property in Iowa to sell you.  I don't buy it, and neither should you.

And to me, this became the weakness of this film, in the third act.  Without giving too much away, Henry Fonda is interviewing Tony Curtis, and believing this fairy tale (sorry to those that believe it) is almost required to appreciate that act.  I found it slightly pathetic, and I found it manipulative.  When the credits finally roll, the filmmakers even added a nice little public service announcement that dealt with these issues.  Ahh. . . .

Well thankfully, all is not lost.  The cast is certainly excellent, and I did like seeing what Boston looked like in the 60s, although I've only been there a couple of times.  The script at that time used almost-the-N-word-and-really-the-F-word (for gays), words that I'm surprised that today's revisionists haven't edited out.  It will happen someday, just as it's happened to Mark Twain.  And that is always a shame since art -- and history -- lose all of its original meaning when this happens.  Hey, like the words or not, they were part of the American lexicon of the timeframe.

Overall, a very good film, even though it has a split personality.  I liked the first two acts; not so much the third.  But still, a fairly strong recommendation on this early serial killer film.",1364515200,,2359,4.686131386861314

This collection contains 5 tapes, each tape contains two episodes. Each episode is 26 minutes long.

Volume 1:
Murph the Surf - It wasn't the perfect crime. In fact, the 1964 robbery of precious gems from a New York museum was most noteworthy for the amateur tactics of the trio responsible. One of the thieves was surfing champion Jack ""Murph the Surf"" Murphy. Catching Murphy and his cohorts was relatively simple, But tracking down the rare gems led investigator on a wild odyssey with mixed results. Narrated by Bill Kurtis
The Boston Brinks Robbery - At 7 P.M., on the 16th of January, 1950, 7 men let themselves into the Brinks Armored Car Company in Boston. Once inside, disguised with Halloween masks, they made their way to the vault and escaped with over $1.5 million in cash and securities. The ensuing FBI investigation would take 6 years and cost $29 million. Every shady crook and colorful character of the time became the subject of suspicion. As the story unfolded and the truth became known, the details, planning and scheduling by these clever thieves resulted in one of the most fascinating and classic heists of all time. Narrated by Robert Powell.

Volume 2:
The Massacre of the Tsar - The Massacre of the Tsar and the Imperial Royal Family 1917. Revolution erupted in Russia and the reign of the Tsars, absolute rulers for more that two centuries, was over. Tsar Nicholas II, hated for his inefficiency and for his close association with the ""mad monk"" Rasputin, was taken prisoner with his wife and five children. They were held captive but this powerful family was too dangerous to be left alive. In July 1918, at Ekaterinburg, the Imperial family was suddenly slaughtered. Narrated by Robert Powell.
Stalin and Katyn - A complete and thorough look at one of the most ruthless monsters in modern history, and more specifically one of his most heinous crimes on record - the massacre of 3,000 Polish soldiers at the Hill of Goats in Katyn Forest. Sensational and riveting footage documents the initial investigation, grisly exhumation of the bodies and over 40 years of debate and speculation of culpability. I the 1940's, few people believed that Stalin, while a ruthless leader, was capable of authorizing such a murderous act. Witness the facts first hand...and decide for yourself. Narrated by Robert Powell.

Volume 3:
John Wayne Gacy - John Wayne Gacy was the model citizen. Active in the business community, he even dressed as a clown to entertain the local children. But detectives investigating a boy's disappearance began to uncover the secret life that was buried along with the corpses in Gacy's basement. A single drugstore receipt linked Gacy to the last of his more than thirty victims. Narrated by Bill Kurtis.
Richard Speck - The tattoo on Richard Speck's arm said it all: Born to Raise Hell."" In a savage one-night spree, he left 8 women dead in a Chicago apartment. But in his drunken stupor, Speck lost track of his captives. A ninth woman had wiggled into hiding beneath a bed. She became a devastating witness in a trial that ultimately sent Speck to prison for an astounding 400 years. Narrated by Bill Kurtis.

Volume 4:
Trial of Adolf Eichmann - Of all the Nazi leaders who escaped after the Second World War, none was hated more than Adof Eichmann. He was one of the Nazi's chief executioners, and the evil mind which devised the 'Final Solution' - the attempt to exterminate the Jewish race from Nazi occupied Europe. Justice, however, lay in wait for Eichmann. Many concentration camp survivors broke down as they gave evidence in one of the trials of the century. Sitting in a booth of bulletproof glass, Eichmann calmly protested his innocence as he awaited the verdict that would decide his fate. Narrated by Bill Kurtis.
Hitler and the Nuremberg Trials - 1945. As the Second World War was reaching its climax and the German army had surrendered, bringing to trial the men who had cause the most heinous miseries of war ever committed on humanity produce what would undoubtedly be the trial of the century. The trial took place in Nuremberg and lasted from November 20, 1945 through September 30, 1946. The monsters of the Nazi party were tired before an international tribunal for the most flagrant and grotesque crimes against humanity in the history of the world. Although Hitler was not present to face the humiliation of the trials at Nuremberg (he shot himself to avoid such a fate), he was present in spirit for every moment of them. He was the man who had given the orders and every indictment was an indictment of him. Narrated by Robert Powell.

Volume 5:
The Assassination of Martin Luther King - 1968. On the 3rd of April, 39-year-old Dr. Marin Luther King, Jr. arrived in Memphis, Tennessee to lend his support to a local strike. In less that 24 hours, he would be pronounced dead, the victim of an assassin's bullet. The gunman was later tracked down and identified as James Earl Ray. The incredible life of the legendary Marin Luther King and the fascinating detail of his untimely death are the focus of this intense and moving tribute to the power of he legacy he left behind. Narrated by Robert Powell.
The Ku Klux Klan Killings - Founded originally in the aftermath of the American Civil War as a defender of white southerners against the revenge of freed black slaves, this secret society, notorious for its savage methods and white hooded costume, became openly racist against Jews and other minorities, as well as blacks, in the 1920's and 1960's. The attempts of the U.S. Government to control it, and the controversy surrounding the violent methods employed by its members, is as compelling as it is disturbing. Narrated by Robert Powell.",1351036800,,6714,4.90580985915493

On this VHS you'll find two episodes: The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. & The Ku Klux Klan killings. Each episode is 26 minutes long.

Episode 1: The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.
The last 1950s and 1960s were a time of turmoil in America as the Civil Rights movement fought against racial segregation. Its leader was the charismatic preacher Martin Luther King Jr, and his assassination in April 1968 allegedly by a lone gunman James Earl Ray, gave rise to endless conspiracy theories as to who had funded him to do so. Narrated by Robert Powell

Episode 2: The Ku Klux Klan killings
Founded originally in the aftermath of the American Civil War as a defender of white southerners against the revenge of freed black slaves, this secret society became notorious for its savage methods and white-hooded costume. Revived in the 1920s, its targets became Jews and other minorities as well as blacks. The attempts of the US government to control it were the background of the film ""Mississippi Burning"".

Episode 1: The Massacre of the Tsar
In the early hours of a July day in 1918, one of history's most infamous murders was perpetrated on parents, their five children and their loyal servants, in a cellar in the central Russian city of Yekaterinburg. The gun and bayonet murder of the Romanovs -- the family of the last Tsar and Tsarina of Russia -- spawned countless conspiracy theories, including the belief that at least one child had survived to escape abroad. Since that fatal dawn, about 200 people have claimed to descend from one or other of the Romanovs who had somehow survived the slaughter in the basement of Ipatiev House.

Episode 2: Stalin and the Massacre at Katyn Wood
n April 1943, Berlin announced that the bodies of 3,000 Polish officers had been found murdered by the Soviets at Katyn Wood. Stalin indignantly denied the accusation, even though all documents on the bodies stopped in 1940 when the men had been in Soviet hands. Only recently did the full truth of who was responsible come out. Narrated by Robert Powell",1351036800,,2174,4.967032967032967

Episode 1: Ma Barker and other Public Enemies
For more than twenty years Ma Barker and her 'boys' terrorised the mid-west of the US, robbing scores of banks and killing dozens of people. Ma has been portrayed as the mastermind of the Barker-Karpis gang, while surviving gang members absolutely denied the allegations. However, evidence indicates that she was much more involved in criminal activity than some think, whether she was the ""mastermind"" or not is debatable. To say the least, she was a willing accomplice, if nothing else. This episode also examines other cases where criminals became society's ""Public Enemies"".

Episode 2: John Duffy
John Duffy was a brutal rapist and killer who struck lone women at railway stations throughout the South East and mainly North and West London. He was at first thought to have carried out his heinous crimes alone and was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murders. However, police were sure that he had an accomplice.",1351036800,,2101,5.137426900584796

On this VHS you'll find two episodes: The Trial of Adolf Eichmann & Hitler and the Nuremberg Trials. Each episode is 26 minutes long.

Episode 1: The Trial of Adolf Eichmann
After World War II, Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann fled from Austria and made his way to Argentina where he lived under the name Ricardo Klement. In May 1960, Israeli Security Service agents seized Eichmann in Argentina and took him to Jerusalem for trial in an Israeli court. Eichmann testified from a bulletproof glass booth. The charges against Eichmann were numerous. After the Wannsee Conference (January 1942), Eichmann coordinated deportations of Jews from Germany and elsewhere in western, southern, and northern Europe to killing centers (through his representatives Alois Brunner, Theodor Dannecker, Rolf Guenther, and Dieter Wisliceny and others in the Gestapo). Eichmann made deportation plans down to the last detail. Working with other German agencies, he determined how the property of deported Jews would be seized and made certain that his office would benefit from the confiscated assets. He also arranged for the deportation of tens of thousands of Roma (Gypsies). Eichmann was also charged with membership in criminal organizations--the Storm Troopers (SA), Security Service (SD), and Gestapo (all of which had been declared criminal organizations at the 1946 Nuremberg Trial). Narrated by Bill Kurtis.

Episode 2: Hitler and the Nuremberg Trials
Hitler and his Nazi party dominated Germany for only 12 years. But during that short period they not only brought about a World War in which tens of millions of troops and civilians died, but were responsible for a cold-blooded policy of mass extermination directed against the Jews and other racial groups which the Nazis considered subhuman in which many more millions were slaughtered. When the Nazis had finally been defeated, the victorious alliance against them took the unprecedented step of putting their surviving leaders on trial at Nuremberg for Crimes against Humanity.

2238906,4,B0007RUSL2,"Reviews of ""The Boston Strangler"" contain some of the most interesting comments this observer has ever noticed on the amazon site. Previous viewers have definitely picked up on some historical question marks concerning the resolution of ""the strangler"" case.  There is even a book out by one Susan Kelly that apparently casts all in doubt.

The movie itself can stand alone as solid entertainment.  Henry Fonda and Tony Curtis are excellent as the 2 main leads.  HF is the main investigator, dragooned into his job by then State Attorney General Edward Brooke. TC is she strangler himself, Albert De Salvo.  There is good, gritty, no nonsense police work here.  Some of those scenes are in gay bars and kinky theatres. Another uses a plain clothes female cop.  That was heady stuff for the late 1960s. Watch closely for the break in the case, which serendipitously takes place in an elevator!

One could carp that ""The Boston Strangler"" is a tad long. It probably is.  Certainly the coda could have been cut.  That said, this is a good one and highly recommended.  Those who worry about transfer from VHS to DVD can stand easy.  And those who worry about historical accuracies should definitely read the previous reviews-and then still watch BS for sheer engagement.",1339200000,,1266,4.892018779342723
2238917,4,B0007RUSL2,"George Kennedy plays Phil DiNatale, the Boston detective on the case. Henry Fonda is John Bottomly, the state attorney general's special prosecutor or assistant or -- well, the AG asked him to head up a ""strangler task force"" because four different counties were involved. Still, women were dying and there seemed to be no real clues. The women of the Boston metropolitan area were scared out of their wits, although somehow enough opened their doors to the strangler. Why? We eventually find out, but the whole thing gets more mysterious all the time. The first three (or was it four?) victims were elderly women who lived alone. Then a young black woman who had roommates, then the rest were young white women. But the MO was consistent, and it was clear they were all killed by the same person. In fact, the police had some details they did not share with the press, as is common with such cases, that tied the cases together.

As most people know, Albert Desalvo, played by Tony Curtis, was eventually arrested on a simple breaking and entering. But he had a human bite on his hand just like the only woman who survived his assault remembered giving him. The cops checked his record, and specifically checked that he had no alibi for any of the dates and times of the eleven murders or the attack on the one living victim.

Turns out he was completely psycho -- as the movie demonstrates effectively -- and was locked up in a mental hospital. He was never brought to trial, but he did effectively confess. Why do I say ""effectively""? See the movie. It's a very tense drama about a very tense time in Boston's history.",1336694400,,1621,4.6055363321799305
2238918,4,B0007RUSL2,"The brilliant 1968 crime thriller ""The Boston Strangler"" pre-dates the ""serial killer"" genre by decades.

Don't be misled. While the subject matter is lurid, ""The Boston Strangler"" is a technical masterwork from director Richard Fleischer, an unheralded great at home with true-crime (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Compulsion/dp/B000EHSVQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Compulsion</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Rillington-Place/dp/B0048O2YWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Rillington Place</a>).

In haunting documentary tones, Fleischer details an infamous series of murders in Boston during the early 1960s when 13 women were strangled in their apartments. Police investigators follow numerous leads and shakedown seedy suspects. George Kennedy, hot from his Oscar-winning work in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cool-Hand-Luke/dp/B001EC2IXK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cool Hand Luke</a>, is terrific as Det. Phil DiNatale, arriving at each new crime scene attempting to make sense of the growing hysteria. With partner Det. McAfee in tow (Murray Hamilton - have two better actors ever played a police team?), they struggle with ever-increasing numbers of victims. As they say in the film, ""We have a maniac on our hands."" The term ""serial killer"" had not yet been coined in 1968.

Utilizing split-screens, on-location shooting and actual news footage, Fleischer has recreated a time in Boston history when terrified residents locked doors, purchased hand guns and dialed the police every time a stranger was on the block. Ultimately, police are overwhelmed and conduct proactive strategies as they arrest prank callers, flashers and theater perverts. The scenes are gritty and shocking. Such criminal detail, not to mention a sympathetic visit to a homosexual bar, were uncommon in motion pictures at the time. Henry Fonda arrives on the scene as Attorney John S. Bottomly, appointed to lead a task force to track down the elusive killer. These early scenes display amazing authenticity, with real-life DiNatale and Bottomly serving as technical advisors.

Today's definition of serial killers was nonexistent in 1968. Profiling and strategy were first developed in the 1970s, thanks in no small part to the horrible rampage of Ted Bundy. As history shows, blue collar worker Albert DeSalvo was arrested for the Boston crimes. In an unorthodox bit of casting, he's played by Tony Curtis as a character with split personality disorder. Curtis, who campaigned for the part, gives the finest performance of his career in an extremely difficult role. He's introduced midway through the film as a humble family man who snaps into a zombie-like state when leaving his apartment. In hindsight, it's unlikely DeSalvo suffered from a split personality, and there's still controversy as to whether the malady even exists. Such an explanation comforted 1960's audiences who had great difficulty understanding how a person could commit such terrible crimes. Today, I suppose, we know better.

Fonda's Bottomly thinks they've found their man after an extraordinary scene of revelation on a hospital elevator, and begins a series of risky interviews to try and bring DeSalvo out of his shell. Flashback sequences during the interviews are as eerie as anything seen in a horror film, with the final shot showing DeSalvo apparently reduced to a catatonic state. As history has shown, DeSalvo was not a catatonic zombie, escaping from his mental institution a year later. There's even controversy as to whether DeSalvo committed these crimes (I'm of the belief he did).

The film was panned by contemporary critics as being an unsuitable subject for entertainment. It's an interesting argument before Manson, Bundy, Watergate, splatter films and numerous other cultural disasters effectively forced us towards the Oscar-winning sensation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silence-of-the-Lambs/dp/B002CMV1N4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silence of the Lambs</a>. But ""The Boston Strangler"" is an undeniably dark and fascinating masterpiece, and one of the greatest films ever made about the seedy world of America's urban landscape.",1326153600,,4700,6.537720706260032
2238919,5,B0007RUSL2,"I came across this movie being shown on TV and saw the entire 2nd half, beginning with Henry Fonda finding Tony Curtis and suspecting he may be the strangler. Their scenes together are powerful. Henry Fonda gently but forcefully guides the strangler to a realization of what he's done. There are scenes that are filmed in such a way that you are able to feel along with the strangler a sense of dread and horror as the truth of what he's done begins to unfold. Tony Curtis is gives a stunning peformance. He is totally convincing as the disturbed plumber. The movie deals compassionately with the strangler as a victim of a severe mental illness, and Tony Curtis brings a strong sense of pathos to the role.",1318809600,,707,4.574803149606299
2238920,4,B0007RUSL2,"""The Boston Strangler"" is a highly fictionalized 1968 film about a series of killings that took place between June 1962 and January 1964 in Boston. The victims were women from 19 to 75 years of age most of whom were sexually assaulted and strangled. The film was based on the 1966 book by Gerold Frank.(""I'll Cry Tomorrow"", ""Beloved Infidel"").

Tony Curtis stars as Albert DeSalvo, the man suspected of committing the murders. Curtis (`1925-2010) was probably one of the most under-rated actors of his era.  For ""The Defiant Ones"" (1958) he was nominated for an Oscar, a BAFTA, and a Golden Globe, yet his excellent performances in hits like ""Some Like it Hot"" (1959) ""Spartacus"" (1960), ""Sweet Smell of Success"" (1957) and ""Trapeze"" (1956) went unrecognized. Curtis had three problems - his deadly good looks, his divorce from Janet Leigh, and his Brooklyn accent.

FWIW - Many people, Curtis included, consider this his finest performance. But don't wet your lips too soon - Curtis doesn't even appear for the first hour.

Henry Fonda (1905-82) plays the chief detective. Fonda needs little introduction. AFI lists him as the 6th Greatest Male Star of All Time. He won one Oscar (""On Golden Pond"") and was nominated for 2 more (""The Grapes of Wrath"", ""12 Angry Men""), plus 3 Emmy nominations, 2 Golden Globe nominations, and he won a Tony for ""Mister Roberts"" (1948).

George Kennedy (1925) plays Fonda's sidekick. Kennedy is best remembered for his role as the convict who beats up Paul Newman in ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967) for which he won the Oscar.

Sally Kellerman (1937) plays one of the victims. She's best known as ""Hot Lips"" from ""MASH"" (1970) for which she was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Her performance in this film is very good, and maybe one of her best.

Richard Fleischer (1916-2006) directs. Fleischer was an extremely versatile director who could handle different genres, including film noir (""Bodyguard"", ""Armed Car Robbery""), adventure (""The Vikings"", ""Violent Saturday""), science fiction (""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", ""Fantastic Voyage"", ""Soylent Green"") and action (""Tora, Tora, Tora"", Mr. Majestyk""). He made 3 films, including this one, that dealt with true life serial killers - Compulsion (1959) and ""10 Rillington Place"" (1971).

Fleischer does a good job maintaining a semi documentary feel to the film yet letting the more dramatic parts have a life of their own. His use of split screen is effective and not distracting. The flashback sequences are nicely integrated into the present and Fleischer uses the camera to simulate Curtis' mental state.

In 1968 the big box office winners were ""Funny Girl"", ""2001"", ""Bullitt"", ""Romeo and Juliette"", and ""Rosemary's Baby"". The big Oscar winner was ""Oliver"" (Picture, Director) and ""Charly"" (Actor) and ""The Lion in Winter"" (Actress) each won one. Other notable releases that year were ""Planet of the Apes"", ""Barbarella"", ""Funny Girl"", ""Monterey Pop"", ""The Producers"", ""The Thomas Crown Affair"", and ""The Odd Couple"".

The film was very controversial, largely because it followed the book which strayed considerably from the facts. Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun Times praised it as a film (""very good"") but said ""This film, which was made so well, should not have been made at all."" Renata Adler in the NY Times said it ""represents an incredible collapse of taste, judgment, decency, prose, insight, journalism and movie technique, and yet--through certain prurient options that it does not take--it is not quite the popular exploitation film that one might think.""

Despite the controversy, Curtis was nominated for a Golden Globe and the film was nominated for an Edgar Allan Poe Award.

Bottom line - if you accept the film as a fictionalized account, this is a good crime film with some excellent performances.

FWIW - Shortly before filming began, DeSalvo escape from  the mental hospital., but returned after a day, and was sentenced to a maximum security prison. DeSalvo was stabbed to death in 1973 and the identity of the Boston Strangler was never established.",1318809600,,4061,5.087218045112782

2238922,4,B0007RUSL2,"The split screen technique widely used in this movie is one that has, unfortunately, gone out of favor in movie making, though I find it stimulating. The acting performances are excellent by everyone in the movie, from Tony Curtis to the various perverts that are investigated throughout the crime spree. Watch particularly for the purse pervert, listen to his eerie voice and then picture him sixty years later.

Anyway, this is a thriller about law enforcement people trying to catch a serial killer during the early Sixties in the Boston area, dubbed the Boston Strangler. Although, like I said, the film is very well done, the facts don't exactly fit the film, so if you approach the film as a factual, historical, film, you will be disappointed, but if you approach it simply as a thriller, it is good. Unfortunately, however, the film nose dives after the killer is caught as the characters engage in psychobabble.

The first half of the film--with the expection of the director's infatuation with splitting the screen--works well, as the Henry Fonda-led police try to apprehend the notorious Boston Strangler (Tony Curtis); however, as the topic of the movie shifts to pyschobabbling attempts to unlock Curtis's split personality, the movie takes a turn for the boring and emerges as a film you really don't need to spend time or money on.",1244592000,2,442,5.054794520547945
2238942,5,B0007RUSL2,"Like most people, I'm fascinated with serial killers and why they do what they do. I don't need the gory details: just what makes them tick. I know some people here are turned off because they say that the killer - Albert DeSalvo - was not the mental personality he was portrayed in the last 30 minutes of this film. Personally, I don't care. I realize this is Hollywood, and how often is the film world historically accurate? Almost never.

So....just enjoy the acting, the camera-work, and the suspense because there is a lot to like here if you are entertained by crime stories.

I, for one, liked the split screen technique presented in this film. It gave a unique feel to the film, seeing the crimes from all kinds of angles at once. Rarely has this been done in films before or since. (I presume because it didn't go over that well to most people.)

Anyway, the story is riveting start to finish and Curtis gives a memorable performance, even though he isn't in the movie until the last segment. How some ""critics"" can label him a sub-par actor is beyond me. He is amazing in here, as he was in ""Sweet Smell Of Success,"" ""Some Like It Hot,"" and other films.

His fellow actors - Henry Fonda,George Kennedy, Hurd Hatfield, Murray Hamilton, Jeff Corey and Mike Kellin - all add to this excellent drama. It was a long wait for the DVD but at least that finally came out in 2005. I've viewed this DVD several times since then and enjoyed it immensely each time.

This film was originally released about the time the Hollywood rating system began to be employed and films changed drastically. Although there is very little offensive language, there is nudity and some shocking scenes with the intense horrific subject matter.",1233273600,2,1726,4.609120521172638
2238943,3,B0007RUSL2,"With its split screen camera work - preceding, but like the movie ""Woodstock"" from the same era - this film seems a little ahead of its time. As a thriller, though, it's pretty wooden. It's not scary in the least, compared with today's films. The acting is leaden, at best. Tony Curtis has one facial expression: blank. The other big names, Henry Fonda, George Kennedy seem fairly lame actors by today's standards of DeNiro, Pacino etc. Also, it was not snowy in Boston the weekend of the Kennedy assassination, as this film erroneously depicts. That should have been elementary research. I don't know how accurate the film is. As a period piece, watch it if you like dated older movies.",1232064000,4,687,4.733333333333333
2238944,5,B0007RUSL2,"All those of you who know Tony Curtis as an actor, know him for his brilliant comedies and the British TV series ""The Persuaders"", alongside Roger Moore.

Yet he was not only a brilliant comedian, but also a very good drama actor as he had proved in ""Spartacus"", ""The Defiant Ones"" (with Sidney Poitier), ""The Great Impostor"", etc.

Alas, if it hadn't been for his pronounced accent, he would have been able to move on to much higher levels.

In ""The Boston Strangler"", as he, himself states and with reason, he simply surpassed himself. He plays a very ugly and disturbing character who actually did exist in fact.

It is the first time that a movie dared tell the story of a serial killer and depict him as your everyday neighbor and otherwise normal, caring husband and father.

The monster is not deformed or visually disgusting. The monster is within him and as such more threatening and more devious than ever.

The movie is simply told, in a very naturalistic way, with not truly shocking scenes (by today's standards), almost documentary in style.
This simple fact makes it even more terrifying, since it becomes immediately palpable and brings it near to us, as no other picture has ever done before, nor since.

Curtis gives a perfect and painstakingly researched performance of a contorted mind and of an individual who simply can't refrain from what his impulses dictate him to do.

Despite being a monster, the main character has traits with which we, the audience, could even sympathize, and this is truly the horror of this picture.

The DVD transfer is simply one of the best, if not the only one, I know in existence, and as such I can only say that it is a very good copy of the film, which also sports a good and clear sound, although a bit rough at times (but that might have been the original intent of the mixer).

As said, this movie is very disturbing, and for those who are very sensible about certain subjects, not at all recommended, but for those who want to see Tony Curtis delivering a masterful performance, this is it.

Absolutely not a movie for kids or adolescents without strict parental supervision.

This is just for mature, very mature audiences...",1228003200,2,2186,4.678851174934726

I liked this movie as a movie, but I realize that given the nature of this case, it is but one person's understanding of what may have occured in Boston from 1962-1964.

The split screen format of the film makes the viewer disoriented in a manner that lends to the film.  You feel like a cop in the film: as time goes on, you feel the story come together.  Henry Fonda and Tony Curtis do a superb job in this film (as always), allowing you to focus in on them.  The film moves quickly until they meet, and then it is one of the most interesting psychological battles in all of film!

The movie is a classic, odd in its production and worth adding to my DVD collection. BUT, the film is pure fiction, taken from Frank's book which is nearly all fiction.
Read Kelly's book and afterward I am sure you will agree with the police. Albert DeSalvo had nothing to do with the eleven, mostly unrelated, murders.",1203724800,4,490,4.51685393258427

2238958,5,B0007RUSL2,"(This was the best satirical comedy,i think i've ever seen yet.)Well,Tony was looking for a different type of film ,that would bring out the best he had to offer as an actor. His previous film,'Don't Make Waves',co-starring Sharon Tate,bombed at the box office. This Strangler film was a vastly different genre film,that his fans and public viewers,had difficulty accepting. Eventhough the story-line is based on the false statements of the con-artist Albert DeSalvo,this is an interesting sado-thriller nevertheless. The real DeSalvo's notoriety was waning and his plaguey prison-life was becoming a drag for Albert. He wanted out and wanted to confess his innocence. He had made-up the story of being the Boston Strangler. DeSalvo had wanted instant fame and an entertainment contract. His weak crooning was even recorded on wax,during the his trial phase. He was running a small drug network throughout the prison. In 1973,Albert was stabbed to death under the guise of a hit ordered by a rival dealer,within the prison. When in fact,the hit was ordered from the outside to quiet DeSalvo the Stool-pigeon. It's not unfathomable,to speculate that the arch-killer 'Zodiac' may have been involved in the Boston stranglation deaths. He simply was being amused by the drama surrounding DeSalvo's media cavalcade and false claims. At any rate,this film is an intriguing suspense flick,venerating the versatile qualities of the legendary actor Tony Curtis.",1177977600,2,1452,5.400881057268722
2238959,5,B0007RUSL2,"In a time where direct-to-video movies about serial killers (Dahmer, Ted Bundy, Gacy, Ed Gein, Evilenko, etc. The list goes on) are stocked onto Blockbuster's shelves; It's a movie that was made in 1968, before The Boston Strangler had reached the final chapter of his story, to be a masterpiece of its genre. This movie is easily one of the most accurate, entertaining, and well-acted movie about a serial killer in existence. I don't really know a lot about the case; What I do know is that a man named Albert DeSalvo was caught for attempting to break into a house and was committed to a hospital. He was believed to be The Boston Strangler, but was never tried for the crime. He eventually died in the hospital, at the hands of a fellow inmate. This movie doesn't have every detail of DeSalvo's commitment and demise, but other than that...It's accurate. It also has extremely innovative camera work and a dynamite performance by Tony Curtis (who previously had appeared in comedic films like Some Like It Hot). The movie beings from the cops perspective; Elderly women are suddenly being killed by an unknown assailant, whom they've invited into their homes. We don't actually witness the killings, but the way they're filmed is pretty effective. Eventually a lawyer, named John Bottomly (Henry Fonda), is brought in to head up the team to track down the killer. After a bunch of false leads, they finally catch the killer Albert DeSalvo (Curtis) by chance. The movie doesn't show Albert DeSalvo until much later in the movie and I think it would've been more effective to not show him until he was in the victim's house, rather than at his own. Whatever...It's still good. Tony Curtis did not get an Oscar nomination for this film, which only proves to me further that the Academy Awards don't always pay attention to really good performances (although, I can't say I know who the 5 nominees were for that year). Henry Fonda is also good as Bottomly, but Curtis owns the movie. Since the film begins with the title card ""This film is based on actual events, involving murderer Albert DeSalvo"" (or something to that effect), it seems unrealistic that the movie could be good. You know where it's leading. But even when the cops follow up the wrong leads (or even when they bring in a swami), it still keeps your attention. The cinematography is, as I mentioned, innovative. Movies like ""Hulk"" wouldn't look the same if not for this movie. It's not horrifying and it's pretty tame as far as graphic content, but it still can deliver the occasional chill.

GRADE: A-

P.S.,

I mentioned in the beginning that direct-to-video movies about serial killers are being released frequently. While movies about Dahmer, Bundy, Gacy, Chikatilo, Gein, Ramirez, and every other killer you can think of are on the market...It appears that distributors are running out of ideas. There's a recently released Boston Strangler movie available now.",1155081600,2,2933,4.850299401197605
2238960,4,B0007RUSL2,"The Boston Strangler has dated somewhat: as with all revolutionary films, what seemed groundbreaking in 1968 seems almost quaint at times today. Yet it's still interesting just how unjudgmental the film is, generally offering a tour of the city's moral underbelly without ever assuming the same prejudices of the detectives failing to deal with the murders. Like the same year's The Detective, also from 20th Century Fox, it's surprisingly level and sympathetic in its treatment of Hurd Hatfield's gay antique dealer who is automatically regarded as a prime suspect in any sex crimes (was it an in-joke that it's a portrait that gets him on the list, I wonder?), just as it resists the temptation to demonize William Hickey's obsessive pervert (lesbians, however, aren't quite so lucky). In many ways, this is a film more about attempting to understand and prevent further killings than a manhunt movie, with the eternally under-rated Richard Fleischer's psychiatric training making him an ideal choice for the material.

The matter of fact procedural nature of the film is at times too low-key to make for compelling drama, but the split-screen sequences are still quite impressive and Tony Curtis' performance is a remarkable piece of work from an actor who now seems all too content to play down to people's low expectations. It's also interesting to note the way that the interrogation scene, with Henry Fonda appearing in Curtis' memories as he works his way inside his head, was so comprehensively ripped off by Spike Lee in Clockers to much less effect.

Alongside a fine 2.35:1 transfer, the disc also boasts some good extras covering both the making of the film and the real murders.",1142985600,,1692,5.060931899641577

This is a gem that any film afficionado would enjoy and appreciate. It has more style than fashion week in the Big Apple. It is deliciously abundant with flavor of a past era in suspense thrillers as well as intellectual art house works of the 60's. Visually stimulating thru brilliant use of color, composition, and perspective. Aurally savvy thru subtle sound direction. Everything from the set designs right down to the wardrobes was incredibly well thought out and executed. I have had an ongoing love affair with the horror genre for about 25 years and this is my new favorite. Not so, for the same reason Texas Chainsaw Massacre has held that title for the past decade, but for the artistic nature of this work of art in the celluloid realm alone. It's not at all ""over the top"", nor is it lacking in any way. I have difficulty forming any complaints at all about this beautifully constructed piece of work.",1106524800,3,1047,4.574468085106383

2238966,5,B0007RUSL2,"This movie is haunting, creepy, and fascinating. The first half of the movie deals with the gradual shock and horror in Boston as the stranglings continue, and focuses on the search by the police for the killer, including many false leads (which are fascinating in themselves). The camera work is interesting (including split screen effects) and contributes to a sense of unease as the search intensifies. (This movie should be seen in widescreen so I hope the DVD version is forthcoming.) The acting may seem a little flat and Jack-Webbish at times.
The second half of the movie is incredible. Henry Fonda finds Tony Curtis and suspects he may be the strangler.  Their scenes together are powerful. Henry Fonda gently but forcefully guides the strangler to a realization of what he's done. There are scenes that are filmed in such a way that you are able to feel along with the strangler a sense of dread and horror as the truth of what he's done begins to unfold. Tony Curtis is gives a stunning peformance.  He is totally convincing as the disturbed plumber. Some of the scenes stay in your mind a long time. There is no gore, but there is one scene of an attack, and in general the film is somewhat disturbing, so I wouldn't let a young child or anyone too unstable watch it. The movie deals compassionately with the strangler as a victim of a severe mental illness, and Tony Curtis brings a strong sense of pathos to the role.",1051228800,8,1431,4.6299212598425195

Characters such as Bottomly are made up, as well as almost everything on the second half of the film, from the moment De Salvo is supposedly captured (something that never happened in reality; De Salvo just walked into a Police Precinct and gave himself up).
I cannot believe that Richard Fleischer did this milquetoast movie. From being standard, lame, fare, the movie falls into boredom when the screen writer (who had not done a great job so far either) invents De Salvo's double personality. So the last fifteen minutes, when viewers are forced to watch endless, non existing, pseudo-Freudian dialogues between an imaginary character and an imaginary schizophrenic De Salvo, are a total waste of time.

8051064,4,B0007RUSL2,"With the invention of the 24 hour news cycle and cable news it seems like every atrocity on the face of the Earth is presented to us nonstop around the clock. When a mass shooting happens or serial killer is on the lose we hear about it constantly without relief. Growing up when there were only three major networks and people relied as much on print journalism as they did TV we never had that. When something like this occurred the story would unfold over time rather than tons of speculation and unverified tidbits coming at us fast and furious.

So it was with the case of Albert DeSalvo, aka the Boston Strangler. The story was mostly regional in the Boston area at first. Once the killing was solved the story spread out across the country. Pundits didn't weigh in automatically about this, that or the other. The deepest look into what happened was put in books rather than a movie of the week. But a movie was made and it was a great depiction of events.

In 1962 the city of Boston is filled with fear as a series of murders of women occur. No one feels safe and no location is safe as the women were murdered in their own homes in most cases. There was no sign of forced entry and most were sexually assaulted. To say that there was intense pressure on law enforcement to catch this killer is an understatement.

The movie moves back and forth between two stories, the second developing as we get into things. On one hand we have the typical police procedural story to watch. Led by appointee John Bottomly (Henry Fonda) a task force is set up to bring together all the clues and information about the killer in the hopes of capturing him and ending his reign of terror. Things get so desperate that Bottomly allows psychic Peter Hurkos in to help the task force. But it is luck that results in the killers apprehension.

As this story unfolds we are also presented with that of Albert DeSalvo, the man who is indeed the Boston strangler. A middle aged married man with children, DeSalvo goes to work, comes home, watches TV and seems normal on the surface. While watching TV one day he tells his wife he has to leave for work. In reality he has another victim in mind. His attack goes off and he rapes the woman, being bitten by her as she tries to free herself. While running away he is apprehended by the police and eventually his story is revealed.

The third act here involves the interrogation of DeSalvo and how they came to find out more about the man and his mental issues. Without a confession the evidence to convict is slim. As Bottomly questions DeSalvo it at first appears he won't succeed. Whether he can or not makes for a well thought out, stunningly portrayed performance by two great actors.

When the movie was released it received solid reviews but most critics took note that much was changed from the reality of the story. Rather than praising it for being an accurate portrayal they noted it was more in the vein of a based on real events type film. This didn't hold back the public who went to see the movie and made it a success.

The movie offered actor Tony Curtis who fought for the role one of the best parts of his life. He was able to show that he wasn't just another pretty face but a dynamite actor who had the chops to bring the character to life. At a time when many thought his career was over this revitalized it instead. Watching his performance is one of the highlights of the film.

The release by Twilight Time is every bit as good as the rest of their catalog, offering a pristine version of the movie on blu-ray. In addition to the quality image on screen extras include an isolated music & effects track, audio commentary by film historians David Del Valle and Steven Peros, Split-screen Personality a short with William Friedkin on the film, Real Killer Fake Nose, AMC Backstory: The Boston Strangler, Fox Movietone Newsreel and the original theatrical trailers. As is always the case with their releases this has a limited run so if you are interested make a point of picking one up before they're gone.",1501200000,,4061,4.478378378378379
