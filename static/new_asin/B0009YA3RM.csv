I laughed at some of the really scary parts, then looked around to see if anyone heard me.  I wasn't sure I was supposed to. It's funny and suspenseful in the strangest, most original way. After I saw it, I went to bed with the following prayer:

2338481,5,B0009YA3RM,"This film is a unique terrifying/hysterical black comedy, and a ready-made cult film in search of a cult.  You can tell that Ms. Boucher is having the time of her life playing ""Nursie"", a sadistic woman who runs an isolated home for the elderly and infirm in the deep south.  Mr. Howell is also in top form as the young doctor who falls into Nursie's clutches.  He finds himself duped, dazed and drugged, and a prisoner surrounded by crazy little old ladies, a pale and mysterious young girl, Nursie's zombie-like (and homocidal) brother, and of course...Nursie, herself--who fancies him for something a little more romantic. If she doesn't kill him, first.",1127433600,,657,4.900900900900901
2338482,5,B0009YA3RM,"NURSIE IS TRULY LOSING HER PATIENTS, August 23, 2005

Reviewer: trumpedup_md

I had the opportunity of seeing this little horror movie when I visited my cousin in the UK this summer. If you love horror, dysfuntion and campy characters, you'll like it. Based in the south, a young doctor (C. Thomas Howell) is injured in a car wreck in the middle of nowhere and taken to a run down southern mansion. He wakes to find himself being cared for by a middle aged nurse known to the patients in the house as ""Nursie"". The doctor is eventually held against his will by Nursie who is looking for not only a business partner but someone to love her. Unfortunately for Nursie, the young doctor has eyes for a pretty but abused young woman (Frieda Jane) who lives in the house. Scorned by love in the past but still looking, Nursie isn't about to lose a man to this young woman. (Savannah Boucher) delivers one hell of a performance as ""Nursie"".

At times, I found myself on edge but at other times, I couldn't help but laugh. Nursie's brother, Raymond, (David Parker), rivals Frankenstein in looks and brain power andobediently carries out Nursie's orders without question. Feeding hostages in the attic, torture, murder or simply burying the victims in the cemetery behind the house, Raymond does what his sister says.

This is not a big budget Hollywood movie but a great little sleeper. You have to meet Nursie and her brother. A must see and a keeper on DVD. When it is released, it is on my buy list.",1124841600,,1494,4.584269662921348

8070329,1,B0009YA3RM,"This is a cheap, rubbishy knock-off of Misery.  All of these over-the-top positive reviews are obviously generated by people who created this 3rd-rate garbage, and their friends!  Save your money and avoid this boring Misery wannabe.",1294012800,,233,5.444444444444445
8070330,1,B0009YA3RM,"If you like your horror movies dated, and perhaps trying too hard, this one is for you.  I've never had a film that ran less than 90 minutes feel like 3 hours!  I'm not kidding.  This is nothing new- not even close.  Maybe it wanted to be cliche, stereotypical and dated.  But even that ""feel"" is tired now.  It seemed like a really bad episode from ""Tales From The Darkside""- and could have been told in 30 minutes as well!  Perhaps they were going for an 80's ""homage""- another tell-tale sign of lame ""filmmaking.""  What else could possibly explain the video wipe transitions?!?

There is NOTHING scary about this atrocity. Moments of potential suspense are never allowed to come to fruition.  I mean how many escape attempts can we witness anyway- just to be tharted by the shotgun-toting hillbilly brother?  (Talk about audience-insulting cliche characters!)  And Savannah Boucher's portrayal of the tituar character is nothing short of bad, bad, bad.  Over-the-top insane chicks are not funny- they are just a sign of terrible acting.

Made cheaply, shot on video, edited on a computer: this movies proves one more time that nowadays anyone can make a ""movie.""  Who can make a good one?",1186358400,,1191,4.826732673267327
8070331,2,B0009YA3RM,"Let me first start off by saying that i love horror movies! From the lowest of the ultra low-budget films such as ""ICE FROM THE SUN"" & ""JOSHUA"" all the way to the Big-budget hollywood films such as ""THE RING"" & ""DAWN OF THE DEAD(2004)"" as well as everything outside & inbetween as long as its good horror i will love it. So i see the 5 star average between 10 reviewers on this page & read what i thought to be insightful reviews about this so-called little known gem & with the quickness i seek & find a copy & spend a good chunk o change on it but no matter,surely it will be well worth it,so i thought! Horror fans yes Savannah Smith Boucher does put on a great performance as the psycho Nursie(and that is why i gave it the extra stars) but it still couldn't save this amateur edited mess from being the MISERY ripp-off joke that it truly is. I can't believe i spent 20$ on this insult to the low-budget horror genre. You need to get your head checked if you think this is a Great horror movie!

I'm having a Nursie party on Halloween weekend (invited everyone to dress like Doctors and Nurses.  Hmmm...)!  Entertaining, campy, chilling, and unpredictable.",1129161600,3,291,5.1063829787234045

Nursie is truly one he__ of an actress... Miss Savannah, I loved you! C. Thomas' character is like the perfect frat-boy-turned-doctor... so smart but totally naive at the same time.  The writers are amazing!...who thinks like this?  I wanna party with you!!",1129161600,3,414,4.942028985507246
8070334,5,B0009YA3RM,"I had heard that the Director of the film, Joe C. Maxwell, really liked the look of Orson Welles's ""Touch of Evil.""  The DP, Russell Metty (""Touch of Evil""), did a lot of handheld work -- thus Maxwell did the same because he believed it would be the best way to shoot the movie the fastest while capturing the tone of the material.

I recommend any student of film to check this one out.  It shows that a full-length feature can be shot in a matter of weeks.

The film itself was entertaining - and I thought Savannah Boucher's performance (""Nursie"") topped Gina Rowlands performance in ""The Skeleton Key.""",1129161600,4,606,4.532110091743119
8070335,5,B0009YA3RM,"I saw Nursie at the premier in Shreveport. It is a movie that keeps you spellbound. It is very exciting and one is holding baited breath waiting for what is coming next.

Savannah was the best as Ada in the movie; no one could have been better.

Thomas C. Howell (Zack) worked his magic as the captured Doctor.

Frieda Jane was great as the abused daughter of Ada.

I liked the movie, because of the great directing and all the actors

were great.

The music was well done and went the script.

The picture quality was excellent.",1127952000,4,529,4.391752577319588
8070336,4,B0009YA3RM,"This chick is nuts and over-the-top hysterically out of touch!  A great campy little gem of a film that is tongue-in-cheek and winking at the genre with

good fun and some real scares.  Maxwell gets some great angles and some

gothic rawness from the Louisiana swamps.  The chase scene in the marshy bayou is great fun!  The music grabs the horror  atmosphere by the throat and there's some great rural tunes as source.  Love the Strauss during the tour of the house to visit the patients.  A nod to the offbeat musical choices of Kubrick.

A fun, sleeper, independent popcorn film!  Swampy!",1127865600,4,591,4.696078431372549
