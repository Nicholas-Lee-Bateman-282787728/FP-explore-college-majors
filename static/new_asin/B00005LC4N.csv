1620764,5,B00005LC4N,"Whether you know it or not, most of what we think of when we think of the Mummy comes not from 1932's ""The Mummy"" with Boris Karloff, but rather from its sequals. Boris was only wrapped in the cloth for the first ten minutes of the movie as ""Im-ho-tep"", and then assumed the name ""Ardath Bey,"" who was dressed and talked for the rest of the movie. But the limping, right-hand-wrapped-to-the-body, rampaging Mummy we know and love is Kharis.

""The Mummy's Hand"" is not a sequel to the original ""Mummy,"" but rather a whole new story. When a troup of American scientists (Dick Foran, Wallce Ford) discover the Princess Ananka, they venture farther on in the dusty, ancient catacombs of Egypt to find the 3,000 year old Kharis (minor cowboy actor Tom Tyler). Both mummies are prepared to go to America, but the mummies have a keeper, and when he discovers the plans of the archaeologists, the high priest brings Kharis to life with tana leaf tea.

Kharis and the high priest follow the Americans to New England, in order to retrieve Ananka, Kharis' love. Wandering the eerie countryside, all the while creating havoc, Kharis meets up with the Americans and Ananka in an exciting climax (watch for the cool ""glowing eye"" trick on the Mummy).

Overall, a great, creepy Universal monster movie with plenty of comic relief to keep things interesting.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Screenwriter Griffin Jay, who would co-write the rest of the sequal's screenplays, co-penned ""The Mummy's Tomb"" to follow up ""The Mummy's Hand."" This movie is more of a re-make of the previous movie, in that the mummy is hunting down those who ""stole"" his beloved princess. It starts with Steve Banning (Dick Foran), years later, regaling his story of the Mummy's discovery, and his apparent demise. What Banning didn't know was that the high priest (George Zucco again) appointed a new keeper for the Mummy (Turhan Bey). The high priest falls in love with a local girl, and wants Kharis to capture her. Kharis, revived with tana leaf tea, looks for her, scaring and killing several people throughout the towns.

All parties meet at the end, for the classic showdown.

""The Mummy's Tomb"" is a great movie, albeit not the most original from a story perspective. Obviously, Universal's biggest pluses are the creepy sets, which oozes ATMOSPHERE! But the biggest news about this movie, as well as for the remaining two ""Mummy"" sequals, is that Universal wisely got the incredible Lon Chaney Jr. to play Kharis!

These first two ""Mummy"" sequals are great monster movies, and classics in their own rights!",998438400,3,2607,4.990783410138249

1620777,4,B00005LC4N,"Plenty stock footage of Egypt here...shifting sands and camels and the pyramids in the background...but when the archaeological dig gets started, we have mountains and rockslide. Where'd that come from? For any who saw the original ""Mummy"" with Boris Karloff, the flashbacks explaining Kharis and Ananka's romance are very obviously taken from that movie though so very well-edited they fit in smooth with those of the present mummy cowboy actor Tom Tyler.

Two down and out archaeologists halfway con an American magician who's been entertaining in Cairo into funding their expedition. One's completely serious, the other's the comic side-kick relief required in these type of films. There's the pretty girl, the magician's daughter, to add the romantic touch, and the villains are the priests sworn through the centuries to protect Ananka's tomb by awakening Kharis to dispatch the intruders.

Though the whole thing sounds pretty mild today, thanks to out CGI effects, and the mummy's so lumbering one wonders how he managed to catch anyone much less kill them, this movie sets up the rest and also establishes all the cliches to follow.

Nevertheless, it's good fun and still entertaining.

As for The Mummy's Tomb...

A Spoiler here:  This is one of the few movies where they kill off most of the original cast.  The scene now shifts to Boston and the Scripps Museum, and also the small town of Mapleton, nearby. (The location of Mapleton is mportant, because in the next couple of moviess, it seems to shift frm Massachusetts to Louisiana!)

Ananka's mummy is on display. The old high priest sends his successor to the States to bring back the princess, using Kharis and the tanna leaves to revivify him.  Again the stock footage of Kharis' downfall is replayed. From there on out, the theme runs according to the outline: Kharis is brought to the US by the priest, murders abound, the skeptic son is convinced of the supernatural and fights the monster and his human cohort...successfully. Kharis dies in a conflagration which has become the tried and true way to stop a Universal monster.

This one is good because of the change of local. Indeed, generally the introduction and setting of the theme of these films is actually better than the rest of the story. Too bad that brief sense of anticipation at the beginning can't hold through to the end.

It's best to suspend disbelief and attempt to view them as someone in the actual time-setting in which they were made. They're much more enjoyable that way.

difference in even a bad movie. Dick Foran and George Zucco are great in Mummy's Hand. I love the ending of this movie. I think the Mummy
in the Mummy's Hand is the best and most real looking and scary of all the Mummy movies. It's a shame more kids and younger people can't

1620808,4,B00005LC4N,"The Mummy's Hand is not a sequel to the classic 1932 film The Mummy.  It's more of an unofficial remake.  It goes over the same ground, forbidden love between a priest and a princess.  The princess dies, the disgraced priest is buried alive, archaeologists dig up same and trouble begins, helped along by the incredibly evil Professor Andoheb (played with great menace by George Zucco).  In this case, there's an evil secret sect devoted to keeping the disgraced mummy/priest/Kharis alive with leaf juice.  Thankfully, the ancient High Priest (Eduardo Ciannelli) of this evil sect manages to pass along the secret recipe for keeping Kharis alive before he drops dead on cue.  Three leaves will keep the mummy alive; nine leaves will give him movement.  Tom Tyler plays the mummy Kharis as well as can be expected, it's a hard role to screw up, there are no lines, no tongue, all he has to do is scrape along the ground.
For a supposed horror film there certainly was a lot of comic relief thanks to Wallace Ford (as Babe Jenson) and Cecil Kellaway (as the Great Solvani).  They even managed to toss in a bar brawl before any digging was done.  In this version the archaeologists are more treasure seekers than scientists.
The best part of this old black and white film is George Zucco's villain.

The greatest failing of The Mummy's Tomb is that it is a sequel that wastes a great deal of time rehashing the previous film with unnecessary flashbacks.  At the rate they were going, they might just as well have shown the other film first then jammed this one onto its ending.  They also noticeably canceled out a couple of deaths from the previous film and aged the two leads, now old fogies with a family to lose.  Returning briefly in a guest-guest-guest starring role, Babe (Wallace Ford) shows up with a new last name (now Hanson), no doubt to throw off the mummy.  The second biggest failing was an insubstantial villain (Turhan Bey as Mehemet Bey), the latest caregiver to Kharis (now played by a reluctant Lon Chaney, Jr.).  The killing spree of the main characters is the best part of this lazy production.",1406160000,,2113,4.688346883468835

""The Mummy's Hand"" is the kind of film spoofed by Woody Allen in ""The Purple Rose of Cairo,"" a comedy/adventure/horror/romance/thriller all somehow contained within an hour.  Cowboy star Tom Tyler plays the mummy, and he was cast because he looked something like a young Boris Karloff, which facilitated the use of stock footage from the 1932 film, but it's really the shadows that carry the film. ""The Mummy's Tomb"" contains stock footage from ""The Mummy,"" and ""The Mummy's Hand,"" and ""Frankenstein,"" AND ""Bride of Frankenstein,"" but it has a better story, one in which the vengeful Kharis (here Lon Chaney, Jr.) is bent on destroying all who defiled the tomb of his ancient love, Princess Ananka, spurred on by ""the fanatic in the fez,"" here Turhan Bey.  Chaney hated playing the mummy, but here at least he puts some effort into it, providing some effective pantomime moments and making his hulking, shambling form look truly dead and pain-ridden in its movements.  In subsequent mummy movies he would simply shuffle.  These two films are no one's candidates for great world cinema, but they're effectively creepy and fun.",1382486400,,1395,5.069868995633188

1620837,4,B00005LC4N,"This was the beginning of Universal Pictures giving us what would become the defining cultural image of what people think of when they hear the word ""mummy."" Prince Kharis--a bandaged, shuffling brute with a bad leg & right arm, neither of which seem to hamper him when it comes to the task of carrying off some nubile, young woman wearing a form-fitting Vera West gown.

Although the first film in this new wave of Mummy pictures, ""The Mummy's Hand"" is often referred to as a sequel to Karloff's 1932 Mummy, it is not. The story is all new & save for some stock footage, there isn't really anything tying this to the 1932 feature. ""Hand"" is a good feature that can get weighed down by some of the annoying comic relief--most of it coming from the comically challenged Wallace Ford--but those gripes aside, Hand is a good way to kill 60 or so minutes & George Zucco--one of the kings of B-movie horror--turns in a suitably sinister performance as the high priest who's in charge of Kharis. 4 stars

The 2nd feature, ""The Mummy's Tomb"" may be one of the more underrated features of the entire Universal monster series. I really liked its dark atmosphere & the renowned Lon Chaney Jr. takes over as the mummy. In real life, Chaney hated playing the mummy, but I enjoyed his portrayal of the monster regardless. Just take notice of the scene when Kharis, out on the street, spots Wallace Ford's character & chases him down an alley.

Even though he's only got one eye to see, you can feel the hate & rage coming out of Chaney during that scene. George Zucco returns as the aging high priest who turns over the caretaking duties to Mehemet Bay, played by Turhan Bey. ""Tomb"" is easily my favorite of the quartet of Kharis films. 4 stars

I also want to add that this print of ""Mummy's Tomb"" seems to have a lot of static & scratches on the film over the first 10 or 15 minutes of the feature--something that was apparently cleaned up when the film was re-released on the ""Legacy Collection."" Maybe some astute observers will go back and compare the two prints if they have not already.

Overall, while the Universal Mummy pictures of the 1940s were not classics ala the Karloff original, they for the most part are still a lot of fun & a good way to occupy one's time for 60 minutes.",1370822400,,2278,4.492753623188406

1620848,5,B00005LC4N,"Ok, so I admit, I wasn't the biggest fan of the mummy as a kid. The Wolf Man, Frankenstein's Monster and Dracula I all loved, but the mummy left me cold for some reason. As an adult now, I have a bigger appreciation for the mummy & his place in the lexicon of classic movie monsters.

Everyone knows what a classic the original 1932 movie with Karloff is. Moody, understated and beautifully photographed. A first-rate job all the way.

But the real fun comes with the second wave of Mummy movies produced by Universal in the 1940s. These were the films largely responsible for the pop-culture image most people think of when they hear the word ""mummy"". Admittedly, these films are not great, but they are good B-movie fun (for the most part) and a lot of the fun comes with picking out the various continuity errors that occur throughout the series.

Prince Kharis, the bandaged, shuffling brute who throttles anybody who is unfortunate enough to get within his grasp first comes to life in ""The Mummy's Hand"" played by b-movie western veteran Tom Tyler. A good movie, although the comic relief provided throughout the film for the most part is obnoxious (especially Wallace Ford), but George Zucco turns in a perfectly sinister performance as the high priest in charge of keeping the mummy alive.

Even better (imo) is the follow up ""The Mummy's Tomb"" which gets a lot of knocks judging by most reviews I've seen, but I thought it was very atmospheric, wasn't bogged down with any annoying comic relief like ""Hand"" and Turhan Bey and Lon Chaney Jr. were terrific in their respective roles, although the plot device of the high priest being tempted by some American skirt & fouling up his mission because of it was already getting tired & unfortunately would continue to be repeated in the followup sequels.

The other two films, ""Mummy's Ghost"" & ""Curse"" are okay features with a great performance by John Carradine in ""Ghost"", but for the most part, the mummy vehicle was getting more than a bit tired by the time these two films were originally released. But taken for what they are, they can still be enjoyable B-movie fodder.

Overall, I rate it a somewhat generous ""5 stars"", mostly for the fun factor.",1358294400,3,2208,4.722077922077922

1620862,5,B00005LC4N,"Even though there are continuity and logic issues oozing throughout this collection I loved this whole set. Boris Karloff plays the first mummy but looses the rags after the spooky prologe which I never really liked since the first mummy movie I had ever seen was the fantastic 1959 Hammer classic with Peter Cushing and Christoper Lee; I like the mummy to stay in its rappings, thank you very much. Still Karloff is frighteningly wonderful; I had seen this movie on Thriller TV a month after I graduated high school but had never seen a single sequel until this set came out so Universal gets 5 stars for giving me the entire kitandkaboodle in one awesome package.

Tom Tyler is the second mummy buts acts as stiff as...well...a mummy might, if, you know, a mummy got up and walked about, but Tyler's stiffness is miscasting not authenticity.

Lon Chaney Jr. plays the mummy in the final three, which I loved best because, look, a mummy in rappings, shuffling one-armed after its victims, tres cool! I remember stills of Chaney's mummy in Famous Monsters of Filmland and on the old Universal trading cards, and of course, he was mimicked by the killer in Fade to Black and then later in Monster Squad, but Chris Lee was the one that introduced me to the shuffling style that a really cool mummy ought to make, if mummies could walk, that is.",1351987200,,1342,4.6344537815126055
1620863,4,B00005LC4N,"The Mummy - Legacy Collection DVD

This product has two DVDs with five Mummy movie from 1932 and the 1940s. The first DVD has ""The Mummy"" from 1932 starring Boris Karloff, the second double-sided DVD has the other movies. The idea of a long-dead mummy coming back to life imitates the legends of vampires. The movies from the 1940s were sequels with different and varying actors. These movies are digitally enhanced for clarity and contrast, much better than what you have seen on videotapes. The first two sequels are the better stories. The others are interesting but repetitive.

""The Mummy"" (1932) tells how a strong love persisted after 4,000 years when the lovers were reanimated to spread terror among people.

""The Mummy's Hand"" (1940) was about an expedition to Egypt te excavate an undiscovered tomb for a 3,000 year old mummy. Their success has an unexpected result.

""The Mummy's Tomb"" (1942) has the reanimated mummy coming to America in search of the mummy of Princess Ananka located in a museum at a New England college.

""The Mummy's Ghost"" (1943) continues this story. Kharis searches for the elusive Princess Ananka. Is the Mapleton Monster back in New England? Yes, and Kharis takes the woman into a swamp to elude his pursuers.

""The Mummy's Curse"" (1944) is set in Louisiana where a swamp is being drained. Kharis again searches for Princess Ananka who is reincarnated in the body of a modern woman. After the usual dramatic events the mummies are recovered and shipped to that New England museum.",1350691200,,1518,4.91015625

1620867,3,B00005LC4N,"""The Mummy's Hand"" is a hybrid comedy-horror picture that just doesn't quite work on either count. Tom Tyler is unconvincing as the mummy, and Wallace Ford's slapstick bumbling portends the unfortunate fate of other Universal Pictures' monsters (i.e., they will eventually meet Abbott & Costello <sigh>).

The use of re-worked stock footage from the classic 1932 Boris Karloff film is unwelcomed here. That's what we get from a B-movie, I suppose.

Dick Foran is solid in the lead, and the supporting cast is surprisingly good (for the most part): George Zucco is excellent as the High Priest, Peggy Moran is quite fetching as the scream queen, and the venerable Cecil Kellaway is very good as the magician. The one exception is Eduardo Cianelli's performance (as the dying High Priest) which is stiff and locked into the silent era method of acting.

The sets are below par, and the script is tolerable at best. With more focus and a bigger budget, this perhaps could have been a ""masterpiece"" of a motion picture, but as is it comes up way short (despite the claims). Still, I enjoyed parts of this film once as a guilty pleasure, but have no desire to see it again.

In ""The Mummy's Tomb"", we have more of a formula B-movie. Lon Chaney Jr. is more effective as the monster, and Elyse Knox is lovely on screen. The talented George Zucco is mostly wasted here, but Turhan Bey is effective as the new High Priest.

The story gets off to a plodding start with too long of a recap/retelling of the prior picture (more stock footage). But things pick up from there, and a series of murders allows prototypical 40's leading man John Hubbard to step to the forefront. Hubbard's performance is able, if unremarkable.

The end scene is well-staged, and is remindful of another monster movie. Once again we have a film here that I was glad to see once, but ultimately turns out to be nothing special at all.

Which film is better? Hard to say as they are so different, yet so similar at the same time. Overall, 3/5 stars and a worthwhile purchase as long as one's expectations are not too high.",1331337600,,2086,4.6521739130434785

He never explained why Tom Tyler only played the role of the Mummy once or why Lon Chaney, Jr. hated this role the most. Also he does not go into much detail with the other four movies and only giving the viewer as cliff note version. Only buy this to replace your VHS collection.

The Mummy is one hour and thirteen minutes long and was released on December 22, 1932. The Boris Karloff's mummy is seen only on screen for about eight minutes and only about a minute of him coming alive and stealing the sacred scroll. The rest of the movie he is Ardath Bey; Imhotep brought back to life. Imhotep\Ardath Bey helps some archaeologists find the burial site of Princess Ankh-es-en-amon. His real intentions are to bring the Princess Ankh-es-en-amon back to life so they can be together forever. Princess Ankh-es-en-amon has taken the soul of Helen Grosvenor. So throughout the movie he is trying to bring Helen Grosvenor to the museum and change her into his Princess Ankh-es-en-amon. The movie flows along well into you get to about five minutes to the end and turns almost south. They could have done a better ending. The Mummy relies on suspense since the horror is minimal at best. Still this deserves an A-.

The Mummy's Hand is one hour and six minutes long and released on September 20, 1940. There was almost and eight year gap between the original Mummy movie and the Mummy's Hand, so it is assumed that the studio would have hoped the movie goers forgot the original film and the plot. This film is neither a follow up nor a sequel to The Mummy. In the original movie the mummy is called Imhotep, in the next four movie the mummy is named Kharis. Second, Princess Ankh-es-en-amon is now the Princess Ananka. Finally instead of reviving the Princess Ankh-es-en-amon with the Scroll of Thoth, it is tana leaves to keep Kharis heart beating so he can guard his beloved Princess Ananka. Also the mummy Kharis stays a mummy and does not take human form. Gone is Boris Karloff as the mummy, in is Tom Tyler as the mummy. Just like Karloff, this would be Tom Tyler only time as the mummy; mainly due to his arthritis. The movie starts out okay, buts starts to loose it half way in the story. Even the ending on how they defeat mummy in battle. The Mummy's Hand only gets a C out of me.

The Mummy's Tomb is one hour and one minute long and was released in theaters on October 23, 1942. This time around Lon Chaney, Jr. takes over the role of the mummy. It is thirty years into the future from where the Mummy's Hand left off. The High Priest Andoheb has survived being shot at and Kharis has seemed to have found some new bandages, because he was set afire last time around. The High Priest Andoheb has sent his protge, Mehemet Bey to Mapleton, Massachusetts to kill off the remaining members of the original expedition and the Banning family. Kharis kills three of the four people he is assign to. Mehemet Bey falls in love with Isobel Evans; who is to marry Dr. John Banning, Stephen Banning's son. Kharis kidnaps Isobel and is taken to the cemetery where he is being kept. John rescues Isobel, Mehemt Bey is shot, and Kharis gets caught in a house fire, the end. Throughout the movie, Kharis is unable to use his right leg and arm. At the climatic end, he suddenly regains recovery to do battle. One footnote about this movie, in the Mummy's Hand Wallace Ford character is Babe Jenson and in this movie his last name is now Hanson. This movie seems to go nowhere and the story is almost predictable. This gets a C- from me.

The Mummy's Ghost is one hour and one minute long and was released in theaters on July 7, 1944. This was the fourth installment of the Mummy series. Kharis is now living in Mapleton, Massachusetts. How he got there or how he survived another burning the movie does not explain why. Yousef Bey (John Carradine) is sent to retrieve Kharis and the Princess Ananka and bring them back to the Hills of Arkan. This time the spirit of Princess Ananka rests in Amina Mansouri. Her hair keeps turning white as the picture moves along. Basically it is the same plot that you saw in The Mummy's Hand and The Mummy's Tomb. The only different is Kharis and Amina Mansouri are drowned in a swamp. The beautiful woman does not survive in this picture nor does Kharis dies another fiery death. This is one of the rare Universal horror\monster movie were the leading lady and the monster dies together. Footnote about this movie, Acquanetta of Jungle Woman fame was cast as the leading actress but hurt her self on the first day of shooting and was replaced with Ramsay Ames. The Mummy's Ghost only gets a C+ and that is only for a different ending.

The Mummy's Curse is one hour and was released on December 22, 1944. This is the final movie in the Universal Mummy series. This takes place in Louisiana Cajun marshes. So how we went from Massachusetts to Louisiana is anybody guesses. The movie does not explain how. Virginia Christine takes over the roll of the girl carried into the swamp; Ramsay Ames was the person in The Mummy's Ghost. During the clearing of the swamp, Kharis and the Princess Ananka are unearthed, but not together and not at the same time. So as usual, Kharis has to go on one of his killing sprees to find his true love. It ends with the Princess Ananka turning back into a mummy and Kharis kills Ragheb for killing Zandaab. While trying to kill Ragheb part of the monastery wall falls on the both of them. This time around Kharis is not showed that often as he was in The Mummy's Ghost. During a flashback to explain why Kharis is still alive we are shown footage of Tom Tyler from The Mummy's Hand and if you look closely you will see Boris Karloff in that same stock footage. Footnote about this movie; in the last three movies it is three tana leaves to keep Kharis heart beating and nine tana leaves on the cycle of the full moon to give him movement. In the Mummy's Curse it is reversed or the actor saying this unknowingly said it backwards and no one caught the mistake. Everything in this movie is C+ quality.",1327276800,3,7206,4.530361260568793

1620871,4,B00005LC4N,"By 1932, Universal had established itself as Hollywood's premiere house of horror with films like Dracula and the cinematic masterpiece Frankenstein. Hollywood had also been swept up in the Egyptian craze which had befallen the world, since the discovery of King Tut. Universal had found it's next monster, and on December 22nd, The Mummy was released to a waiting public. Featuring the studio's biggest name, Boris Karloff, The Mummy also reunited veteran actors Edward Van Sloan and David Manners in Universal's latest monster outing, along with Dracula cinematographer Karl Freund, now in the director's chair.

The movie opens at the end of the British Museum's Egyptian expedition of 1921, where renowned archeologist Sir Joseph Whemple, played by Arthur Byron, and his team have unearthed a 3,700 year old mummy along with a large box buried with it. Upon consulting his friend Dr Muller, played by Edward Van Sloan in a similar manner to his role as Dracula's Van Helsing, an expert in the occult, Sir Joseph learns that the mummy, having been identified as Imhotep, a high priest in the Pharaoh's service, was buried alive, presumably for crimes of sacrilege. The mummy is inadvertently resurrected by Sir Joseph's over-eager assistant, played by Bramwell Fletcher, who instantly goes mad at the sight of a 3,700 year old corpse walking away with the Scroll of Thoth, on which the spell that brought him back to life was written.

We flash forward to the British Museum's Egyptian expedition of 1932, where Sir Joseph's son, Frank Whemple, played by David Manners in the same dorky, love-struck schoolboy performance he gave in Dracula, is just preparing to wrap up the year's tour when a strange, heavily wrinkled and very tall Egyptian man, Ardath Bey, played in a superbly deadpan, yet eerie manner by the master, Boris Karloff, brings him a piece of pottery that he claims to have come from the undisturbed tomb of the princess Anck es en Amon, which has been lost for 3,700 years. Frank jumps at the chance to bring something sensational back, so he puts his crew to work digging where Ardath Bey tells him to, and recovers the princess and all the personal effects buried with her. Due to a contract with the Cairo Museum, the entire find must be turned over to the Egyptians for display there.

Meanwhile, Dr. Muller has returned to Egypt with a patient of his, Helen Grosvenor, played in a very dramatic performance by Hungarian Zita Johann. After the museum closes, Ardath Bey is found mumbling a strange incantation next to the body of the princess, which Helen hears all the way across town, causing her to fall into a trance. She blindly heads for the museum where Sir Joseph and Frank see her trying to get in after the museum is closed. When she collapses at Frank's feet, they take her to their house for medical attention, where they are met by Dr. Muller. Sir Joseph and Dr. Muller retreat to the study where Sir Joseph tells the doctor that Helen has been mumbling the name Imhotep. He is alarmed by this, since no one other than the three men who dug the mummy up have ever heard the name. While the two colleagues are in the study, Ardath Bey comes to the house on previous invitation from Sir Joseph to find that Helen was at the museum earlier. After Dr. Muller questions Ardath Bey, he determines that Imhotep intends to kill Helen, whom he believes is Anck es en Amon reincarnated, and revive the long dead princess's soul in Helen's body.

The basic story behind The Mummy was not one of evil, but one of sadness. Anck es en Amon had died, leaving her lover, the high priest Imhotep, heartbroken and grief stricken. His plan to read the forbidden text and resurrect her was not out of evil, but out of love. He only wanted a life with the woman he loved, but was buried alive for his crimes and his coffin desecrated so he would be condemned in the after-life as well. In his own words, ""No man has ever suffered as I have for you."" And it was true.

Eight years later, in 1940, the Mummy was dug up again. This time there were no Scrolls or powerful undead priests. The entire story was begun anew, in The Mummy's Hand, with Imhotep being replaced by the mummy Kharis, kept alive for 3,000 years by the Priests of Karnak with tana leaf fluid. The Priests of Karnak were led by the high priest Professor Andoheb, played, in a strong creepy performance, by George Zucco, who was also director of Egyptology at the Cairo Museum. The sole purpose of the Priests of Karnak was to guard the tomb of the princess Ananka, who had died in a similar manner as Anck es en Amon in the 1932 classic. In a flashback at the beginning of the movie, it is explained that Kharis was in love with Ananka, just as Imhotep was with Anck es en Amon and tried to raise her from the dead with tana leaves instead of an ancient scroll. Scenes in the flashback were directly cannibalized from the first film, with close ups of Boris Karloff replaced with shots of stuntman Tom Tyler, who plodded along as Kharis, killing all who dared enter Ananka's tomb.

Americans Steve Banning and Babe Jenson, played by Dick Foran and Wallace Ford respectively, stumbled across the legend and, hoping for a sensational find to bring back to New York, enlisted the financial aid of American magician The Great Solvani, played by Cecil Kelloway, to unearth the princess's tomb. Solvani's daughter Marta, played by Peggy Moran, was none too happy about her father giving all their money to two strangers and insisted on going with them.

After the group found the tomb of Kharis, Prof. Andoheb revived the mummy and from then on, Kharis was little more than a supernatural hit man, killing where ever he found tana fluid, placed by the professor's lackey, known only as the beggar. Kharis kidnaps Marta, whom Andoheb tries to make immortal along with himself, but is foiled by Steve and Babe.

In addition to the star of the feature being little more than a priest's enforcer, none of the other performances were all that great. Foran played the standard 1940's tough guy, Ford played the lovable, if goofy sidekick and Moran played the formulaic damsel in distress. There were scared locals who believed in the curse and in the end, the good guys won. This was probably one of the first examples of a studio throwing money into visual effects instead of good acting. The set used for the tomb was very elaborate and Tom Tyler's eyes were blacked out frame by frame to give Kharis a more horrifying look. But when you have a cookie-cutter script, and half decent acting at best, you can only go so far. The Mummy's Hand didn't have a very far reach.

After the dismal venture of the Mummy's Hand, two years later in 1942, The Mummy's Tomb was opened. This one picked up where Hand left off with mostly the same characters played by the same people, with the exception of Kharis, now played by Universal's new golden boy Lon Chaney Jr., fresh off the Wolf Man. The Mummy's Tomb even ripped off the Wolf Man's opening music. Good to see they put time and effort into this one.

Tomb starts out with a much older Steve Banning, reprised by Dick Foran, recounting the story of the last movie to his older sister Jane, played by Mary Gordon, his grown son John, Played by John Hubbard, and John's fiancee Isabel, played by Elyse Knox, in their Massachusetts home. Twelve minutes into the hour long movie, we see some new material with George Zucco reprising, however briefly, his role as Andoheb, passing the mantle of high priest on to Mehemet Bey, played by Turhan Bey, and instructing him to take Kharis to America and kill all the surviving members of the group that took Ananka's mummy back to New York in the last film. Kharis is once again a glorified hit man, and the high priest sets his sights on the film's heroine and plans to make her immortal, along with himself, to stop the Banning bloodline. Wallace Ford returns for a time as Babe Hanson, renamed from Babe Jenson from the last film. Glad to see the production crew was concerned with continuity here. The story of Tomb goes pretty much the same as Hand. The only difference in the tow movies, acting wise, is Lon Chaney Jr. He isn't given much in the way of projecting his character since the mummy is pretty much a secondary villain, but his shuffling gait is a little lass animated than Tom Tyler's was, making Kharis more believable as being an undead creature. The production quality here was almost nonexistent, with the film stealing the Wolf Man's music, and scenes from Hand as well as angry mob scenes from Frankenstein. I wonder if anybody besides Chaney put any effort into this picture at all. The main cast was just as dull as the previous movie, mostly because, with few exceptions, they were the same people. One good point was a very well done, spooky cemetery set. The Mummy's Tomb should have stayed buried.

In 1944, continuing the reign of foolishness, The Mummy's Ghost came to haunt us. And not in the good way. This time the priests of Arkhan, not Karnak, send new leader Yousef Bey, played by John Carradine, to America to find Kharis and return to Egypt with him and the body of Ananka. George Zucco simply can't die, because he's back again as the high priest who passes the mantle of leadership on to Yousef Bey. Does ANYBODY care about continuity at all?

Yousef Bey arrives in Mapleton Massachusetts and finds Kharis, or rather Kharis finds him, after the priest boils tana leaves in the woods. His first victim is local university teacher, Professor Norman, played by Frank Reicher. In his class is Tom Hervey, played by Robert Lowery, who is dating an Egyptian girl named Amina, played by a very lovely Ramsay Ames. Everything happens as it did in the first two movies, except this time, it is Kharis who stops the priest from making Amina immortal.

Same story as before. The acting was terrible, they ripped of the Wolf Man's music again, apparently, no one could be bothered to watch the previous two films for continuity, and it was the same story with different players. The Mummy's Ghost should have stayed dead.

Alas, the very same year, 1944, The Mummy's Curse was unleashed on fright fans. This one really was a curse.
Somehow, Both Kharis and Ananka were relocated from Massachusetts to THE BAYOU! How that happened is anyone's guess. A group of local Cajun workers are working to develop the swamp where the mummies are buried, and the foreman, Pat Walsh, played by Addison Richards, isn't having any nonsense about mummies slow down his work. He is visited by a man named Halsey, played by Dennis Moore, and his assistant Ilzor, played by Peter Coe, from the Scripps Museum to recover and bring back the two mummies if he can. Walsh's secretary, who is also his niece Betty, played by Kay Harding, is quite taken with Halsey and, while on a date, they find a young woman lying by the road and bring her back to camp. The girl has a case of amnesia, and can't remember who she is, but she does know a great deal about the legend of Kharis, though even she isn't sure how. In addition to being Halsey's assistant, Ilzor is also this movie's high priest. He has an underling in the form of Ragheb, played by a mildly sinister Martin Kosleck, who becomes enamored with Betty. This time the priests are planning to bring the two mummies back to Egypt to be re-entombed in the Valley of the Seven Jackals. Kharis is sent to find the princess and he does, while Ragheb sets his sights on Betty. All the bad guys die, all the good guys live and that's it for the mummy franchise. Even Chaney didn't care enough about this piece of junk to really get into it. The rest of the acting was as bad as the other three Kharis movies. The Mummy's Curse really was a curse.

As is often the case, the first film is the best. The rest of them were blatant attempts to cash in on a proven thing, but were all done so badly, it's a wonder they made any money at all. There's an interesting documentary, Mummy Dearest: A Horror Tradition Unearthed, on the first disc the tells a lot of interesting facts about the original Karloff movie, and mentions the other four out of politeness. So, with one tale of eternal tragedy and suffering, and four poorly made do-overs, the Mummy set is still worth a buy if you're a fan of old classic Universal horror, or Boris Karloff, when he went for a little walk, nearly 80 years ago. And the whole world saw his face.",1318032000,,12436,4.608126410835214

1620873,2,B00005LC4N,"I must disagree with several of the decisions that were made in the course of restoring the original
Karloff version of the Mummy. In the DVD that I own, which is labeled Legacy Collection but has a
different Karloff mummy picture than the one shown by Amazon, Universal decided to crop out the
bottom of the original 35 mm frame to simulate a modern wide-screen film. This shows a total lack
of respect for the movie. But even worse, the marvelous detail visible in the original film has
been totally erased.

Karl Freund was fascinated by the rendition of texture on film, and he took very special pains to create
maximum texture in Karloff's mummy. Apparently he used strong sidelighting and other technical means
to record the incredible fine detail visible in older prints of the Mummy that I've personally seen

But what do we have on this ""restored"" DVD? We have a ""dumbed down"" movie where Freund's fine detail
is totally suppressed. The movie now looks like so many other 1930's film, a little murky, a
little blurry, and extremely mediocre in a visual sense.

The sound track was also trashed. There seems to be a total obsession among film restorers to get rid
of the slight hiss that is characteristic of the classic 35 mm sound track. This hiss is part of the
original movie experience and everyone who saw the Karloff film in the 1930's heard this artifact of
the early sound film process and did not resent it.

However, today it seems that this natural hiss is a ""defect"" that must be totally erased. The result
here is a very dull sound track that lacks the auditory details easily heard in the original movie.
Mr. Dolby, where were you? I didn't see a Dolby seal on this movie. An intelligent application of the
Dolby process would be a much better choice than merely rolling off the high frequencies as was
apparently done here.

In the original film, the first view of Karloff is a total shock because he seems to be covered with
the dust of the ages. The amount of detail visible in his face is shocking. Freund must have sweated
blood to get all this detail down on his 35 mm film stock. But now Freund's masterpiece has been made
to look like the vaselined blur of a typical Paramount production. Lazy, stupid decisions were made
that have trashed a classic film.

Obviously the definitive restoration of this iconic film classic has not yet appeared. This botched amd
mangled version is completely typical of the classic Hollywood attitude of contempt both for the films
they produce and the audiences that watch them. We can only hope that this movie will finally
encounter a restoration team that will respect it on its own terms, instead of [----]ing copiously
on the film and also on us.",1315353600,4,2715,4.645833333333333

The original was more of a romance than a scarefest. Boris Karloff is as always the highlight of the movie. It is well directed and has some very intersting scenes. The make up job on Karloff is pure Jack Pierce and is worth seeing.
The sequels are a mixed bag. They are still very enjoyable. The Mummy's Hand has a couple of Musuem archeoligists looking for a long lost tomb. Of course they find a map on a vase and start an expidition with the added female and her dad. If this sounds convoluted it is! Just go with it. It is fun and enjoyable you won't feel like you are wasting your time. At the end there is a fall off a long set of stairs that is a remarkable stunt by the great Jock (Tarzan)Mahoney. Also Tom (Captain Marvel) Tyler is the Mummy.
The other 3 sequels all star the wonderful Lon Chaney jr. as the Mummy these movies are a blast and I have a wonderful time with them and my kids and grand kids.

1620876,3,B00005LC4N,"None of the Universal Studios Legacy Collections have been digitally remastered. :( So I cannot give this set 5 stars. The best movie is the first, ""the Mummy"". Karloff really shows why he is the master! Other than that these movies all occur in series 20-30  years after each other so if you follow the first occurring in 1920, the last occurs sometime in the 1990's.
The second movie changes the mechanics of the concept of a living mummy, and all the others follow that second movies setup. One change is that after the first movie the mummy is covered in bandages and used as a tool for vengeance. Slow plodding sluggish vengeance that should be easily escaped from. But no, he racks up quite a body count anyway in each.  The plots of all the movies other than the first are pretty bad. The second is okay because of the mystical mechanics they added. All but the first have several minutes of flashback scenes from the first film added. Seeing as they are only 60 to 70 minutes long each, you have to wonder what they were thinking.

This set is not for everyone. Still though, if you are a big old time horror movie fan, or a student of horror films, then I highly recommend all these sets. Otherwise I'd give most of them a pass. I'd definitely pass on this Mummy set.",1306368000,,1276,4.421276595744681

THE MUMMY (1932): Starring Boris Karloff, Zita Johann, David Manners, Arthur Byron, Edward Van Sloan, Bramwell Fletcher, Noble Johnson and James Crane. PLOT: After being resurrected in 1922, a mummy takes on a human identity and searches for his long lost princess.

THE MUMMY'S HAND (1940): Starring Dick Foran, Peggy Moran, Wallace Ford, Cecil Kellaway, George Zucco, Tom Tyler, Charles Trowbridge and Eduardo Ciannelli. PLOT: A group of explorers accidently discover the tomb of Kharis, the guardian of Princess Ananka's tomb.

THE MUMMY'S TOMB (1942): Starring Lon Chaney Jr., John Hubbard, Elyse Knox, Turhan Bey, Cliff Clark, Dick Foran, George Zucco, Wallace Ford and Mary Gordon. PLOT: Kharis returns to kill off the ones who desecrated his princess' tomb.

THE MUMMY'S GHOST (1944): Starring Lon Chaney Jr., John Carradine, Ramsey Ames, Robert Lowery, George Zucco, Barton MacLane, Harry Shannon, Frank Reicher and Oscar O'Shea. PLOT: A new priest and Kharis discover a woman who is secretly Princess Ananka.

THE MUMMY'S CURSE (1944): Starring Lon Chaney Jr., Peter Coe, Napoleon Simpson, Kay Harding, Dennis Moore, Kurt Katch, Addison Richards, Holmes Herbert, Charles Stevens, William Farnum, Martin Kosleck and Virginia Christine. PLOT: Kharis chases after Ananka in a Cajun countryside.

1620884,4,B00005LC4N,"It's hard to dislike The Mummy's Hand, if anything for nostalgic reasons; however, the comic precence of Wallace Ford and Cecil Kellaway make the film appear uneven.  The mummy is certainly creepy, and George Zucco is the ultimate mad man. But I would have liked it as a straight horror film myself.  It strikes me as strange that the other major monsters didn't play their sequels for laughs. Dracula was followed by Dracula's Daughter, Frankenstein had The Bride of Frankenstein, and after The Wolf Man came Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man.  Why Universal decided make The Mummy's Hand a comedy-horror movie I'm not sure, but on that level, it suceeds.

Ironically, the sequel, The Mummy's Tomb, isn't a humor/horror film.  The mummy (this time portrayed by Lon Chaney) is still frigtening, but this time Wallace Ford isn't a laugh-getter, nor is Dick Foran the leading man (that role goes to his son).  George Zucco is only in the film for the first few minutes, and Cecil Kellaway's magician character -- as well as his daughter -- are gone.

1620887,5,B00005LC4N,"This B & W movie of ""The Mummy"" with Boris Karloff is a magnificent example of how children can be scared out of their pants and utterly delighted at the same time.  I saw the movie a couple of times as a kid and several more times as an adult.  Now that I am fast approaching retirement age, I find that it is just as entertaining as it was 50 years ago.  The makeup on Mr. Karloff is utterly believable and, if his body position when he walks appears a little silly, so what?  It is the rest of the time that the mummy sends chills down your back.  The flashbacks are great and give us an understanding of his unending search for his lost love, the princess, now embodied in the movie's heroine in this century (or was it last century?).

Regardless of the few minor imperfections in this original version of ""The Mummy"", I found it to be just as entertaining as it was when I first saw it and even spookier in black and white that it is in the modern color version.  No one will ever beat Boris Karloff in this role.  He lends just the right amounts of pathos and evil, so that you find yourself wishing he could recover his lost love, just don't let her be the heroine of this particular movie because she is already taken.

1620889,3,B00005LC4N,"Generally speaking, the Universal Legacy Collection volumes tend to feature one immensely well done film and a mixed bag of sequels.  The Mummy Legacy Collection is unique, however, both because the first film is not part of the same franchise as the four films that follow and because the quality in nearly all of these films is sub-par when compared to the usual Universal Monster standard.  With the exception of one severely underrated sequel in this volume (""The Mummy's Ghost""), I consider these to be mediocre films, most feeling like B films shot on A film budgets.

The Mummy **: What should have been an amazing film is repeatedly compromised by its direction and its studio.  Karl Freund, the cinematographer legend who revolutionized the look of both cinema and television, was drafted to direct this film at the very last second.  Freund had never directed a film in his life, and that comes across clearly.  While the film is filled with lavish sets and strong visuals (Karloff's intense close-ups with his burning eyes are nothing less than iconic), it fails to take any stance on the story, itself.  The Mummy is motivated by intense love, and yet Karloff's acting and Freund's cameras do not sympathize with him.  At the same time, if The Mummy is not the protagonist with whom we side, who is?  The professor's obnoxious, lazy, and impulsive son?  We're left with a less than terrifying film about a somewhat creepy looking lover/killer who is neither a monster nor the tragic figure with whom we sympathize.  Freund applies no level of pathos to the script, nor does he compel it from Karloff.  Instead, we get an indecisive, yet beautiful looking film that never really works on the emotions in the way that it should.  Perhaps, had the studio not cut a sequence in which we see Karloff's character follow his lover across various time-periods, each time failing to keep her, the film would resonate differently.  Instead, as it stands, The Mummy fails to capture the terror of Dracula nor the tragic pathos of Frankenstein.  It falls carelessly between the two, never really delivering anything more than a memorable set of burning eyes.  Oh, and I'd be amiss to leave out the fact that Karloff ceases to appear as a mummy after the first scene of the film.  A disappointment all around.

The Mummy's Hand ***: Eight years later, The Mummy franchise resets itself with a far simpler, more action-oriented monster flick with a similar (yet different) mummy (who actually appears as a mummy throughout the film), a simple yet likable band of heroes, a new and more imaginative set of rules surrounding the Mummy mythos, and a plot that holds together reasonably well if you give it a healthy suspension of disbelief.  Don't approach this film looking for artistry of any kind.  It's a great B horror film; nothing more and nothing less.

The Mummy's Tomb **: The first sequel to The Mummy's Hand fast forwards many years and features geriatric versions of the previous film's protagonists, as well as a boring son who looks like Basil Rathbone but lacks his acting skills, and an Egyptian priest villain who is blatantly Japanese to suit the anti-Japan hysteria of post-Pearl Harbor America.  If this sounds like a recipe for a lame sequel, you're not entirely wrong.  The only saving grace is Lon Chaney Jr., who really defines the morbid and deformed presence of the mummy.  The film's watchable, but it's hardly entertaining.

The Mummy's Ghost *****: Here's where the franchise offers up a tremendous surprise.  The second sequel to The Mummy's Hand borrows the strongest ingredients from the previous films and then takes the franchise to the next level.  We actually see Kharis (the Mummy) finally begin to take on true characterization.  With even more limitations placed upon him than Karloff's Frankenstein monster (can't talk, and you can barely see any facial expressions beneath those bandages), we can still see Chaney's Mummy experience frustration, rage, love, and resolute sadness.  Add to this John Carradine playing the best villain of the entire series (think Christopher Lee meets Willam Defoe meets Peter Lorre), likable characters, and one draw-dropping surprise ending, and you're in for one heck of a viewing experience.  I honestly don't understand how this film gets overlooked by classic horror fans.

The Mummy's Curse *: The worst of the series, in my humble opinion.  The characters are woefully under-developed, there's almost no plot and certainly no recognizable protagonists until the last twenty minutes of the film, there are massive plot holes, and the resolution is entirely unsatisfying.  This is a film that simply didn't need to be made.  Perhaps its one saving grace is that we finally get a Mummy film where the evil priest doesn't spontaneously fall in love and thereby undo himself at the end of the film.

All in all, this is one sleeper of a franchise with a few minor exceptions:
- You get the first mediocre film, featuring Karloff, some beautiful visuals, and a premise that could have been amazing if given to another director.
- The second film is fun, if cheesy.
- The fourth film is a true masterpiece and absolutely worth seeing on its own.

Universal was the best,bar none, at creating gorgeous and elaborately dark and moody sets that appropriately generated just the right atmosphere. In this case it is ancient Egypt and in and around the pyramids. Why you can almost feel the dust and sand.
Boris Karloff plays the title role to a tee in the original 1932 picture ,fresh from his breakthrough role in ""Frankenstein"".He is Karis a high priest whose love Princess Ananka dies. He is so overcome with grief that he tries to bring her to life but is caught doing so. He is sentenced to death and is wrapped and buried alive.
About 2,500 years later in 1932 the tomb of Ananka is discovered by archeologists and is removed to a museum. Karis comes alive at this disturbance and becomes determined to re-awaken his love from her sleep. Her spirit flees into the body of a local woman. He tries to befriend the museum staff but things get just too frustrating and he takes matters into his own hands. He captures the woman in whose body the princess' spirit resides but she is confused and is having nothing to do with it all. She calls on Osiris to help her and the Egyptian Goddess strikes Karis down.
The franchise continues with The Mummy's Hand(1940).This time a Dr. Banning(recently from the Scripps Musueum) with his friend Babe are trying to find some kind of archeological find in Egypt that will restore the museums'faith in him. They find a piece of pottery which leads them to discover the tomb of Priness Ananka. A sect which has comes down through the ages dedicated to Karis and the Princess decide to kill the infidels who have dared to open and desecrate the tomb. They reawaken the Mummy(who apparently didn't toatlly kick it seven years earlier;played by Tom Tyler) who goes on a rampage killing everyone it can get its moldy clutches on. It is touch and go but in the end Dr. Banning and Babe come through it all with the Princess in their grasp and the Mummy ""dispatched"".
""The Mummy's Tomb""(1942) takes place about 30 years later with Dr. Banning and Babe that much older. The film begins with the good doctor talking to his son,sister and friends about his expedition 30 years before. Later that night the mummy sect ressurects Karis(played from now on by Lon Chaney) who sole aim is to kill every member of the expedition starting with Banning,which he does. The town is crawling with reporters as word spreads about the murder and the curse of the Mummy. An older Babe also shows up and he too succumbs in Karis' clutches. Bannings' son becomes the next target. The sect decides Karis should capture his girlfriend but the townsfolk set a trap and capture him on the second floor of a house. There they set it ablaze with the Mummy seemingly seared to a crisp.
""The Mummy's Ghost""(1944) takes place in the same town where Banning lived. This time a professor who had been involved with the Mummy case in the last film is first victim in this one. The leader of the Karis sect(John Carradine) seeks the  spirit of the princess who this time seems to have inhabited another young girl in the town. He works out of a local cave/mine and eventually the killings in the town arouse the suspicions of everyone. The girl in question often talks strangely and has been found lying  on the ground close to where the Mummy travels and kills. Finally she is captured by Karis and the chase is on. But this time the Mummy actually escapes carrying his ""love"" into a local swamp and the pair disappear into the quagmire never to be seen again.
Finally in the last installment ""The Mummy's Curse""(1944) we find the owner of a construction company contracted to drain the very swamp the Mummy and his princess disappeared into some time before. The workers he has hired are of course jumpy and leary of the entire area to begin with with talks of curses and strange goings on. Unknowingly during their work they release the Mummy who is found by the co-hort of an archeologist sent to the swamp to investigate the mummy story. His cohort however has sinister plans and is really there to take the Mummy and the princess(if found) back to Egypt where they belong. They hold up in the ruins of an old monastery and do their works from that location. Around this time the woman in whose body the princess' spirit resides(from the last picture)also is inadvertantly uncovered and also comes to life. She is confused and dazed and is found by one of the local residents. But Karis finds her and kills everyone who would get in his way to keep her. The townspeople of course spring into action,again out for a piece of the mummys' hide. The chase leads to the old ruins where in the end the Mummy seemingly gets killed under the falling fragments of a corner of the monastery.
As the series progressed the films got slightly weaker with each successive one and the plot threads that bound each to the other got thinner also. But they were all solid money makers for the studios(some more so than others) and they all hold up pretty well today.
All films have been wonderfully restored. There is a documentary called""Mummy Dearest:A Horror Tradition Unearthed"",there is film commentary for the original movie provided by film historian Paul Jensen,the ""Mummy Archives"" and all the original theatrical trailers are included.
All considering this set is a must have for all true horror fans. This Legacy collection gives us all a chance to see these films in a wonderfully restored and pristine condition as never before. They have been out for about four years now so before they disappear altogether may I suggest,if you haven't already,start your collection of this must have classic collection today.",1204675200,,5916,4.698458574181117

Unfortunately, The Mummy and its sequels don't live up to the glory of the other monster collections (Frankenstein, Dracula, etc).  I think The Mummy collection is also the worst of the film transfers, and even though I know how old these movies are, the other transfers to DVD are much better.  Also, unless you are a true Mummy fan, the sequels included here (Mummy's Hand, Mummy's Curse, Mummy's Ghost, Mummy's Tomb) are just not that exciting.  This is all personal preference of course, but compared to the other great collections, this one doesn't stand up.",1202947200,7,681,4.886956521739131

So much fun to look at, a commentary audio with plenty of details.

The only thing I really don't like is that there is no subtitles for the commentary audio and if you don't speak english perfectly (which I'm not), you miss a lot. I live in France and would like to see french subtitles. They could have at least put english subtitles.

Not everybody speak english!! And don't forget deaf and hearing impaired people.

1620904,2,B00005LC4N,"These two films are really rather poor. Even though they are mercifully short (Hand is 67mins and Tomb is 60mins) they have few redeeming qualities. The acting is at times rather wooden and in the case of the Mummys hand two of the heros are vaguely reminisent of Abbott and Costello. Whether this was intended I very much doubt.

The Mummy itself is a pretty clever makeup creation (no CGI remember) and there are one or two moments in both films where the closeups of the mummys face must have been pretty scary back in the 1940's. However any tension created is soon lost because the films are largely confined to one or two sets and the plots are pretty contrived and disbelief settles in quite quickly when you realise that the Mummy can only walk at 1.5 miles an hour. Naturally the characters in the film don't seem to grasp this important fact!

See the Boris Karloff original, which is one of the great Universal horror films.",1195516800,,935,4.559523809523809
1620905,5,B00005LC4N,"Another tasty collection of classics from Universal.  The Mummy is a classic of the horror genre just as much and Frankenstein or Dracula.  Sure we all know what the damn mummy looks like, but the original film is a bit different than you may think.  First off, Karloff is briefly in mummy makeup for a few seconds in the beginning of the movie, though every poster and box cover is plastered with the image of the Karloff mummy.  Once he escapes from his tomb, he goes on a search for a woman believed to be his reincarnated love.  He does all this in human form(wearing a fez of course).  Most of the movie is devoted to his attempts at attaining the woman.  An excellent film shot by cameraman, Karl Freund.  Freund had a background working on German expressionist films, and it must have rubbed off on him coz this film has touches of that.  Visually, it's one of the best looking Universal monster films.  The movie has a tendency to make me feel sleepy.  Not because it's boring, mind you, but because it has a very dreamy feel about it.  Great stuff.  The second film, The Mummy's Hand, is where we start to see the themes and visuals we now associate with mummy stuff.  The mummy is played by Tom Tyler in his only mummy role.  This movie is not a sequel, and though some flashback footage from the first film is used, the storyline of the first movie is pretty much altered.  Now the mummy is called Kharis instead of Im-Ho-Tep, and his love, the princess, is called Ananka.  Now the mummy is a shuffling, bandaged brute brought to life from tana leaves and strangles those who have desecrated Ananka's tomb.  This is the mummy stuff most people think of when they think of mummy movies.  This plotline(and some plot points from the sequels) would be what Hammer would base their Cushing/Lee version of The Mummy on.  Lon Chaney jr would now step into the bandages for the duration starting with The Mummy's Tomb.  Now the movies are actually sequels.  Chaney's mummy films, while entertaining, all have a sameness about them.  In fact, if you ask me there is one too many.  In Tomb, he comes to America(with Egyptian high priest of course.  How else is he supposed to get the tana leaf cocktail?) to strangle everyone that escaped in The Mummy's Hand.  In The Mummy's Ghost, he's still in America(with another high priest, shipped via airmail from Egypt) and chasing a chick he believes to be the princess Ananka.  Plus he has to kill the leftover cast member from the previous film.  In The Mummy's Curse he's pulled from his burial spot in the swamp by-you guessed it-another high priest from Egypt, but this one has a sidekick.  Once up and running again he chases Ananka once more and strangles all those in his way.  It is kinda tiresome by that point, but not without entertainment value.  Another good documentary on the films is included in this set.  Well worth the purchase for the asking price considering you get the classic original and all the other Universal Mummy films.  Well, that wraps up this review(get it?).",1194048000,2,3039,4.589219330855019

1620908,3,B00005LC4N,"Here each of five mummy movies in the Legacy Collection is reviewed in order of original release.

The Mummy  (1932) -- This flick has mood, lots of it. Director Karl Freund's background in the German Impressionistic-style of the 20-30's played a big role in the cinematic quality of The Mummy . The visual approach of The Mummy  shows what Dracula (D, Tod Browning) could have been if Freund (who was the director of photography) had been given more free reign.

The Mummy capitalized on the American fascination with ancient Egypt brought on by the 1922 discovery of Tutankhamun 's tomb. The story line of The Mummy was certainly enhanced by the real-life belief in a curse of Tutankhamun. One should view The Mummy today with this in mind - it certainly helps to provide considerable chill. Modern audiences are quite desensitized to horror and ancient Egypt provides much less lure today than it did in the 1930's.

The standouts in The Mummy are the sets and Karloff. The set designs are wonderful; one feels they are in 1920-30's Egypt. The Mummy sequels suffer tremendously by comparison in this regard.  Boris Karloff had already established himself as one of Universal's horror stars (Frankenstein, 1931; Old Dark House, 1932) and certainly proves himself adept again. Although he is only seen as 'the mummy' (Im-ho-tep) for a short period early in the film - and even then not fully, Jack Pierce's make-up is classic - no iconic. Even as the living mummy, Ardath Bey, Karloff is visually creepy, his face and hands appearing wrinkled and desiccated. As was common for Karloff he plays 'the mummy' in a restrained manner, bringing both fear and empathy from the viewer towards his characterization. The remaining cast is less impressive. Probably the weakest performance is that of Zita Johann (the female lead); hers is a performance typical of that of female leads of the time - over the top and stiff. The film historians that comment on her performance in original Universal documentary Mummy Dearest that accompanies the Legacy Collection give her much higher marks. I however do not feel that she complements Karloff's performance; where he delivers chills, she diminishes them by 'acting' (as the Jon Lovitz thespian character would say on SNL). A solid performance is provided by David Manners as the supporting male, while the performance of Edward Van Sloan as the 'educated' protagonist to Ardath Bey is a lackluster and cookie-cutter version of his performance as Prof. Van Helsing from Dracula (1931). The remaining supporting cast do not deliver real memorable performances. Karloff dwarfs all in this cast, without him The Mummy would have been relegated to a simple novelty of period of Hollywood's 'gory days'.

Despite the criticisms of the acting, the story, sets, Karloff and cinematography prove substantial and The Mummy is a solid 4 star movie (5 stars if one is able to completely place oneself in the mindset of a 1932 viewer!) and certainly the BEST of the Mummy movies from Universal's golden age of horror.

The Mummy's Hand (1940) -- Not a sequel in a traditional sense as the story is almost completely unrelated to 1932's The Mummy , The Mummy's Hand is a solid follow-up with its own fair share of creepiness. Where The Mummy was a simple horror story filmed and acted (mostly by Boris Karloff) as a horror story, The Mummy's Hand is a more tongue-and-cheek horror; not all out camp but comedic at times. Although no performance comes close to that of Karloff's in The Mummy , the cast performance of The Mummy's Hand is by far more balanced and solid than that of The Mummy . This does a lot to boost a weaker story and less convincing sets (see more below).

The Mummy's Hand begins a four-movie run of essentially the same story: Ancient love (only similar theme to the 1932 film) transcending time and protected by an eventually jealous third party. From The Mummy's Hand onward, the mummy is not Ih-ho-tep, but Kharis. His lost love is not Princess Anckesen-Amon , but the Princess Ananka. While the Ananka character remains essentially the same (and minor) in each of the three following Mummy movies, the Kharis character is first presented as a non-royal lover of Ananka, buried alive for his inappropriate love. In later films Karis mysteriously evolves into a Prince and the reasons for his living-mummification become obscured. Add to this dead-lovers mix an Egyptian High Priest (played by George Zucco in The Mummy's Hand ) and one henchman/underling-priest. In each of the four post-1932 films responsibility of the High Priesthood is handed down by a dying High Priest to his #1 with much pomp, including a long speech by the new High Priest accepting his responsibility with the recognition that failure will result in a horrible death curse . It is the responsibility of the High Priest to maintain Kharis in a barely living state by ""giving him the fluid from three leaves from the ancient tana plant each night of the full moon"". Should anyone disturb the tomb of Ananka the High Priest was to give Kharis ""the fluid from six (to nine in later films) tana leaves to allow life and motion"" such that the mummy can kill all those who have defiled the tomb. Of course revival of Kharis to motion results in re-activation of his love for Ananka, revival of Ananka in the personage of the lead female actress who is always of Egyptian heritage and somehow psychically-connected to the Princesses soul. In the last act the High Priest inevitably falls in love with the reincarnated Ananka, bringing upon himself the curse of ""a horrible death"". This general sequence is essentially repeated in each of Universal's 'sequels' to the 1932 movie.

In The Mummy's Hand , Kharis is aptly played as the stereotypical lumbering, leg-dragging mummy by western actor Tom Tyler. In contrast to Karloff's performance, Tyler remains a 'mummy' for the entire film. Again Jack Pierce's make-up does much to create a creepy feel. Added to this is a post-production special effect by which Tylers eyes were blackened to make his eye sockets appear empty.  While certainly not a perfect effect, this is a creepy visual. Aside from Pierce's make-up, the visuals in The Mummy's Hand are quite disappointing. First, the mountain entrance to the High Priest's temple looks more like an Inca ruins than an Egyptian relic. The temple itself also has a 'south of the border feel'. The dig site is SO obviously an internal set that one will snicker and think Ed Wood wasn't that bad after all! These problems greatly dampen the seriousness with which the viewer can take The Mummy's Hand . Yet the oft comedic interchanges between the Steve Banning (played by Dick Foran) and Babe Jenson (played by Wallace Ford) characters make the aforementioned problems seem in place.

All in all this is a fun little movie, not as 'classic' as The Mummy but a decent 3.5 star effort.

The Mummy's Tomb (1942) -- In the third Universal Mummy outing Dick Foran and Wallace Ford reprise there roles as Banning and 'Babe' (although Hanson instead of Jenson this time - huh?), but with 30 years added to their ages. In The Mummy's Tomb the general plot scheme of The Mummy's Hand is rehashed but in this case the new High Priest (played quite well by someone who actually looks Middle Eastern) is given the task of taking Kharis - now, and thereafter, played by Lon Chaney Jr - to America to kill the Banning archeology party and all those associated with it. Thus the Mummy series moves west - this saves considerably on costs for sets as one only needs contemporary American village sets (in The Mummy's Tomb , Banning resides in New England ) and Universal recycled scenes (directly) from The Mummy's Hand such that nearly ALL Egyptian action comes from the previous movie. Not much new in this Mummy movie except locale. The acting is acceptable but not stellar. The Mummy's Tomb (and all subsequent Mummy movies) has a bit of American Western feel, both in set designs and cast actions. The latter is illustrated by the use of posse-vigilantly gangs to chase down the killer (Kharis). I found little in this movie to applaud loudly although this is not to say it is horrible. Taken for what it is - low budget 40's, WWII, Universal horror, it's a 3 star movie worth watching if you're interested in the genre.

The Mummy's Ghost (1944) -- Ahhhh...continuance of the same old story line.  This time the High Priest (enjoyably played by John Carradine) is charged with going to recover both Kharis and the mummy of the Princess Ananka from America and return them to Egypt and their eternal resting place. Otherwise, same ol', same ol'.  Again set mostly in New England, although this time the Banning village is surrounded by more thicket and swamp, the sets are simple and generally uninventive.  Chaney is solid ass the lumbering Kharis although he seemed to have gained better mobility from Tomb to Ghost . Although having an 'immobile' arm in Tomb, Kharis appears to be able to gain use that arm when necessary (e.g., carrying away the heroine).  Plot contrivances and continuity flaws such as this really lend a hand in dragging down The Mummy's Ghost .  Add to these problems the use of photographic filtering techniques to produce 'night sequences', that were in reality filmed during daylight hours (one need not look far to see the strong shadows cast by all object, animate and not!) and one gets a really cheap production value.  Certainly other Universal films of the same period (e.g., The Wolf Man ) were not nearly as shabby and had no greater budgets.

What if any redeeming qualities exist for Ghost ? Acting; namely that of John Carradine, who gives a very solid performance and holds the show, much like Karloff did in The Mummy . Casting Carradine as an Egyptian is a bit like casting Charlton Heston as a Mexican (see Orsen Wells' Touch of Evil ), but Carradine, like Heston later, somehow pulls it off. Aside from Carradine the cast is lackluster but compotent. Look for Barton MacLane as the inspector - he played a detective in Bogart's classic The Maltese Falcon. In the end, Carradine's performance can only pull The Mummy's Ghost up to a 2.5 star movie.

The Mummy's Curse (1944) -- Same year, same story - kind of. The Mummy's Curse picks up where The Mummy's Ghost left off. A new High Priest is appointed to go to America and do the job that Carradine's character failed at (because of the inevitable lust for Ananka and subsequent curse of a 'horrible death'); namely bring Kharis and Ananka back to Egypt. Not much new here, with exception of some pretty weird story faults. Most clear of these is the fact that Banning's little New England village swap where Kharis and a resurrected Ananka receded into at the end of Ghost has been transported to the Bayou's of LA!  Curse thus has Cajun mobs after Kharis rather than proper New England gentlemen and farmers. For whatever reason this time around no efforts were made to disguise daylight as darkness and much of the action takes place in full sunlight although the people of this sleepy little town aren't particularly bright lights as they seem to miss the mummy on almost all occasions. Chaney's Kharis is physically a bit schizophrenic in Curse , vacillating between the stereotypical lumbering movement to quite limber and agile movements. Apparently mummy's 'evolve' quickly once they get enough tana extract. The acting in Curse is by far the WORST of any of the Mummy movies. The lead actor is downright horrid! The only truly creepy part of The Mummy's Curse is the resurrection of Ananka from the mud of the Bayou; although even this is a bit campy and overacted. All in all Curse is the proper prequel to any mummy outing with Abbott and Costello (Meet the Mummy, 1955), which was the fate of all great horror figures at Universal once the 50's rolled around. No more than 1.5 stars for The Mummy's Curse.",1191542400,,11915,4.812805474095796

True, the Karloff original was a complete story in and of itself, but the sequel The Mummy,s Hand was a great story on its own and a good start for a new history for the character.

Tom Tyler was a good choice for the title role and a far cry from his work as Captain Marvel. Lon Chaney lent his usual skill to the part with suitable menace, and next to the wolfman, was probably his best monster role.  There were nice sub-plots as well, particularly the reincarnation of Princess Ananka.  Her reawakening from the swamp has to rate as one of the creepiest scenes in classic horror.

Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman was a combined sequel of The Wolfman and Ghost of Frankenstein. Which then continued in House of Frankenstein and ended with House of Dracula. Even Abbott and Costello met Franky, Drac, and, Wolfy in one movie.  The Mummy and The Invisible Man dealt with A & C separately in two different movies.

1620927,5,B00005LC4N,"This set of films is a real treat for horror fans and exactly what popcorn was made for. It includes the original screen classic from 1932 that began our long love affair with the mysteries of archaeology and ancient Egyptian curses which have provided us with countless hours of entertainment over the years as we let our imaginations run free for an hour or two. This is top-notch fun from Universal.

After the initial masterpiece of the original ""A"" film, ""The Mummy,"" Universal would make a franchise of the character and it would become a staple during the 1940's for people looking to escape the harsh news of the war and get lost in a fun story on a Saturday afternoon. It was also a chance to put your arm around your girl, as you knew there would be a few thrills that would give you the excuse you needed.

Films like ""The Mummy's Hand"" and ""The Mummy's Tomb"" while no more than mere entertainment helped keep the legend fresh in the minds of those hungering for more. The two later entries from the 1940's included here are both a lot of fun, and both have Lon Chaney Jr. as the tortured Kharis, forever attempting to reunite with his forbidden love, Ananka.

""The Mummy's Ghost"" was excellent ""B"" film entertainment and had John Carradine as Yousef Bay. George Zucco was back as Andoheb, even though he was supposedly killed off in the previous film. Ramsay Ames is the frightened Amina/Ananka in this one and Robert Lowery is her bewildered boyfriend. Chaney elicits sympathy through the bandages somehow as he chases after the screaming Amina, who begins to transform into his love Ananka as the story progresses. The great ""B"" sets of Universal and the transformation of Ramsay Ames' character Amina into Ananka are highlights of a good entry in the series.

Lon Chaney would portray Kharis in the final film of the series also, and this time the stunning Virginia Christine would be his most sought after prize. ""The Mummy's Curse"" was set in the swamps as a group of workers developing the area become frightened when they uncover the resting place of Kharis. The foggy swamps provide an appropriately creepy mood for this good ""B"" entry.

Betty Walsh is good as Kay Harding and Peter Coe is Dr. Ilzor Zanard, hiding Kharis in the ruins of a monastery. It is best not to question why or how there is such a place on a hill overlooking the swamps of the bayou or how the coffin of Kharis came to be there. These ""B"" Universal entries were meant to be fun entertainment and nothing more. This one succeeds in that capacity with the foggy atmosphere of the swamps and the gorgeous Virginia Christine. The scene where she rises from the swamps, awoken by the sunlight and covered in mud, gives this one a big lift.

For something on another level, the original ""The Mummy"" is a true film classic. The story will seem familiar to audiences today, but it still has never been done better. This great film from 1932 which introduced moviegoers to a story we still can't get enough of, was both entertainment and art. It has stood the test of time and is as much fun to watch today as it was when in theatres in 1932.

The Mummy is one of the great horror films from the early days of sound pictures. It began as all true film classics do, with an excellent story, this one by Nina Wilcox Putnam and Richard Schayer. It was a mystery and adventure set in the exotic location of Egypt. Add to that a present day romance in a tug of war with an ancient and supernatural love story and you have a true masterpiece of the genre.

The story opens at a dig by the British Museum in 1921 as Sir Joseph Whemple (Arthur Bryon) and his team uncover an ancient sarcophagus. It becomes clear, however, that there is something quite different and disturbing about the mummy inside. His name was Imhotep, a High Priest, and the sacred spells etched into his coffin meant to make his journey to the afterlife smooth have been scratched out. And rather than being embalmed as was the custom in ancient Egypt, he was buried alive!

A small casket is also found with him that warns of death for anyone opening it. It seems it contains the ancient scrolls of the Egyptian god Isis, the scrolls holding the key to life and death itself. Try as he may, in spite of warnings about the curse and its power from Dr. Muller (Edward van Sloan), Sir Joseph's assistant Ralph (Bramwell Fletcher) not only opens the small casket, but whispers the ancient Egyptian words of the scroll inside, bringing Imhotep back to life. Ralph Norton goes insane and Imhotep disappears.

Eleven years later, in 1932, a new field expedition of the British Museum headed by Frank Whemple, Sir Joseph's son, is led by a tall and stiff Egyptian with hypnotic eyes named Ardeth Bay (Boris Karloff) to the tomb of an ancient princess. There are equally dire markers surrounding her resting place, the seals of Seven Jackels from over 3,700 years prior left as a warning.

A battle of wills ensues for the love of big eyed and beautiful Helen Grosvernor (Zita Johann) between Frank and Ardeth Bay/Imhotep as Imhotep wants to use the scrolls to bring back Princess Anck-Es-En-Amon and give her Helen's soul. Imhotep's spell is poweful, but perhaps not as strong as Frank and Helen's love for each other. And one must not forget how Isis feels about Imhotep's past and present transgressions against ancient things held sacred.

This is old-fashioned fun in every sense of the word. It does not seem creaky at all but is very entertaining, director Karl Freund keeping this Carl Laemmle Jr. production moving along at a nice pace. Karloff, Manners, and Zita Johann are especially good in creating a memorable film that began the legend we all have come to know as, ""The Mummy.""

There is a sarcophagus full of fun and entertainment here. These films are what going to the movies is all about. So grab the popcorn and the kids and let your imagination run wild for an hour or two. It's a lot of fun!",1150070400,29,5955,4.596045197740113

1620931,4,B00005LC4N,"I remember when I was younger I would love to watch some of the old black and white classics because they had a certain creepiness to me that some of the horror movies of the 80s lacked. While watching this movie today isn't quite as frightening as watching it as a child, ""The Mummy"" still has plenty suspense and eeriness to it. Universal Studios made a lot of these types of classic in the 30s and 40s and they were all originals for how they portrayed monsters and creatures from beyond (Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, Dracula, The Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde come to mind).

This story begins with two archeologists digging around for valuable artifacts and scrolls. When one of them comes upon a tomb with a mummy in it, he becomes intrigued and fascinated, despite protests from a man who reads an inscription on the casket that is nearby ""Death, eternal punishment for anyone who opens this casket."" After opening it, the curse is renewed, and the Mummy (played by creature sensation Boris Karloff) comes to life.

One of the best moments in the movie to me is the scene when the man opens the casket and the camera pans back and forth from the man reading the contents while sitting at the chair to the slowly reviving creature awakening.  It is more impressive that during this scene there is no sound, as to give it a suspenseful and sinister effect upon the viewers.

After this opening scene, we fast forward 10 years later, and understand that Imhotep (the mummy, resurrected) has plans for trying to lure Helen (who is a reincarnated ancient princess) into eternity with him. However, Sir Joseph Whemple, the one who survived the terrible event 10 years prior, his son, and Dr. Muller all piece together little by little the past of not only the curse, but the events that let to it. Helen, who is played perfectly as a ""damsel in distress"" by Zita Johann, wavers between the hypnotic powers and plans of Imhotep and the nave but charming Frank Whemple, who distrusts all notions of curses until the climatic scene.

Another aspect of this film that was refreshing is making Karloff's role multi-dimensional and dynamic. Although a villain and antagonist, he does (as others have noted) come across as a semi-sympathetic character whose motives are originally designed for love. As the movie progresses, he becomes too obsessed with his goals, and consequently does not stop at anything to attain his goal of capturing the princess for the afterlife.

The other movies are ones in the same Mummy series, but many fair to come close to the quality of this one. Still, it is a great deal, and The Mummy alone makes it worth the DVD.",1129161600,2,2653,4.694623655913978
1620932,5,B00005LC4N,"This warning from The Mummy's Hand (1940) doesn't just refer to the cycle of low-budget movies by Universal during World War II. There was something else 1940s American movie audiences might have wished they could slow down, if not stop, and that was America's new (self-appointed) responsibility for running the world.

All four of these movies were sequels to The Mummy (1932) starring Boris Karloff and the compelling Hungarian actress Zita Johann (the best actor in any of the Universal mummy movies). But the sequels tell a separate story from the Karloff movie. It's the story of three-thousand-year-old Kharis and his love for the Egyptian princess Ananka, which led Kharis from the ancient and mysterious Near East to the new center of world power, the United States.

Kharis is kept alive by the extinct ""tana leaves"" administered by an ancient priesthood. (The medallion-wearing priests are called priests of Amon-Ra until the last two movies, when John Carradine calls himself a ""priest of Arkham."" (This might make The Mummy's Ghost the first movie with a reference to H.P. Lovecraft - - a clich homage now, like ""Arkham Asylum"" in the Batman movies. Arkham, Mass., is the fictional town where scholars from ""Miskatonic University"" study the Old Gods of the Cthulhu mythos. You sometimes see Miskatonic U sweatshirts in low-budget horror movies, too.)

In The Mummy's Hand a virile American hero and his giggly male sidekick named ""Babe"" (who likes to play with a ""hootchie-kootchie"" doll he bought from an poor Arab trader in Cairo) find the tombs of Kharis and Ananka, save the girl the hero has fallen in love with, and seal up the mummies until the next movie.

In The Mummy's Tomb the virile American hero from the last movie is an old man living in Middleton, U.S.A. The ingenue has given him a son (now a doctor) and conveniently died to free up the movie for that son's love interest. This movie came out in 1942 and the war is part of it. The doctor is waiting for his army commission to come through. A reporter who comes to Middleton to cover the ""fiend murders"" that follow the arrival of the mummy Kharis says, ""I had a choice of covering the Russian front or this.""

A priest of Amon-Ra brings Kharis's mummy to Middleton, where Ananka now rests in the local museum. This evil priest looks distinctly Japanese to me, though the actor apparently wasn't. But the character must have made 1942 audiences think of their present enemy. Sending Kharis on a mission of murder, the priest says, ""While the moon is still high in the sky death goes with you."" Is the moon a stand-in for the Rising Sun? Is Kharis a kamikaze?

One of the plot twists in all the mummy movies is the ""temptation"" of the priests. This temptation is usually lust for a white (or almost white) woman whose body has been infused with the spirit of Ananka.

The doctor is engaged to get married before he ships out, and his fiancee tries on her mother's wedding dress, but the foreign priest has other ideas. When the priest tells Kharis of his plan to possess the white woman even Kharis recoils at the horror of miscegenation (the only real acting anyone is able to do in the mummy wrappings).

As in most Universal horror pics, an army of villagers with torches appear and track down the priest. The sheriff shoots him without warning and then grins. One less . . . Egyptian. The twentieth-century posse chases Kharis and the girl to the doctor's family home. (It seems like Kharis is  returning her to where she belongs, the doctor's bed.)

The doctor burns down his own home to incinerate Kharis. Death by flame was a common image of the war in the Pacific. Kamikaze pilots smashed into battleships. U.S. Marines used flame-throwers against enemy troops entrenched on islands. Tokyo and other cities were firebombed  (though the British and Americans did that in Europe, too). All this was before the atomic bomb was used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

When The Mummy's Ghost came out (1944) the country and the movies were getting ready for the postwar period. By 1944 the Soviets had turned the Germans back at Stalingrad, Americans knew D-Day was coming soon, and the Big Three were meeting to divvy up the world. The war was as good as over, except for those who hadn't been killed in it yet.

Ghost opens in a college classroom in Middleton, filled with young men and women. By having the young men in class instead of in uniform, the movie was telling audiences it was okay to get ready for normal life again. But these young people don't know how corrupt the touch of the ancient world could be. The spirits of Kharis and Ananka were still a threat to American optimism and purity.

Here the new postwar American hero is in love with Amina, who doesn't even try to pass as white. ""You're Egyptian. What's wrong with Egypt? It's as modern and up to date as any other country.""

The ""shadow"" of Kharis that Amina feels pass over her in the night is the pull of the old world she can't resist. Describing her new acquaintance (the latest priest of Arkham to serve Kharis), Amina tells her boyfriend, ""He kept talking about tana leaves and moonlight.""

But late in the movie we find out something that may explain the hero's doomed love for the half-Egyptian Amina. Maybe he's not so pure himself. He wants to take Amina ""to New York, to my people."" ""Your people?"" Amina asks. ""Maybe they won't want me.""

""Your people"" may just mean ""your family,"" but it might be code for Jews, too. (And doesn't this young man look slightly ""dark""? Could this New York boy bring home a girl less ""suitable"" than a part-Arab?) As Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) says in Annie Hall, the rest of the country thinks of New York as a liberal Jewish homosexual conspiracy. ""Even I do sometimes."" And Middleton is about as Gentile as the town Beaver Cleaver grew up in.

As usual, when Amina puts on her sheer nightgown, what priest of Arkham could resist temptation? But this mummy movie ends differently.

Kharis takes Amina (now Ananka incarnate, whose skin ages and crumbles at the mummy's touch) into a swamp. But the villagers won't  let the hero chase his love into the swamp and save her from Kharis. ""It's certain death."" Amina/Ananka is where she belongs. (""We belong dead,"" as Frankenstein's monster said to his bride. You can't be part one thing and part another and live.)

This postwar hero is not like the archeologists and scientists who came before him. He's too accepting of the strange. He doesn't realize that his Amina can't be saved. She is too tainted by her foreignness. And her American hero himself may not be pure enough.

In The Mummy's Curse Kharis and Ananka rise from the swamp to find an America busy with government-sponsored technical projects, turning itself into a modern superpower.

A white manager sent to the swamps by the federal government argues with superstitious Cajuns who work for him. They don't want the swamp drained because they're afraid of stories of ""the loup-garou."" (A nice touch since this mummy is played by Lon Chaney, Jr., the best werewolf actor ever, but his sad face and voice go to waste in these movies. Even the mummy makeup is nothing special.)

""Can't you people get it through your head that the government is draining that swamp for your own good?"" (Apparently Middleton is near the Louisiana bayou country.) The manager relies on his foreman ""Cajun Joe,"" since he ""knows how to handle these people.""

A scientist comes to the swamp with an Egyptian colleague (who doesn't shake hands - - a tip-off ever since Boris Karloff first refused to shake hands in The Mummy) but the manager doesn't like ""college professors getting in my way.""

Pointy-headed professors aren't the only stereotypes. There's ""Goobie,"" the only black in this part of the south (the rest of the locals speak what sound like metropolitan, not Cajun, French). Goobie's favorite line is, ""The devil's on the loose and he dancin' with the mummy!"" (The filmmakers liked it so much they had him repeat it.)

Ananka rises from the bayou and turns into a beautiful young woman with a Bettie Page hairdo (not the Amina who sank into the swamp at the end of the last movie). Ananka now possesses her completely.

You guessed it, the professor's Egyptian colleague is really a priest of Arkham, and he has a servitor who's passing as one of the locals. And in this movie, it isn't the priest who's tempted by the white or near-white woman, it's the acolyte. When the priest finds him with his hands on Kharis's princess Ananka, the priest puts the ""curse of Amon-Ra"" on him.

Michael is the self-appointed caretaker of the abandoned (presumably Christian) monastery where the Egyptian priests hide Kharis between murders. When he discovers the foreign blasphemy, Michael can save neither himself nor Ananka, who tragically can't really become American even though she's worked with the professor and his purebred American girlfriend and would like to be just like them.

The Egyptian priest can't save Kharis and his princess, and neither can the Christian monk. It's the modern scientist and government technocrat who finally bring order.

Unlike most of the other mummy films, this one doesn't end in fire, but in a more biblical way - - Kharis brings down the walls of the monastery on himself and the Egyptians like Samson.

1620935,4,B00005LC4N,"Universal Studios offers excellent dollar value with this collection. The films have all been re-mastered. The original trailers are included, and there's a short feature about the creation of the original film. With the exception of the transfer of the original film itself their work is stellar. (Actually it's stunning. The print of the original film probably just wasn't in good shape to begin with). The trailers are enjoyable but likely won't be watched more than a few times. The documentary on the creation of the film is (for me anyway) one of the most enjoyable in their entire series. The stories about Zita Johann and her clashes with (Director) Karl Freund are too funny for words to describe.

The sequels are more fun to pass a bit of time with than the original was though. They're light and not particularly demanding, and they're filled with enough laughs (intentional and otherwise) to make any hour a pleasant one. Archival bits weren't matched well with the rest of the footage but apart from that the films are superbly crafted. Yes, the dialogue and the acting are poor but the photography, sets and makeup are excellent. Much of the lighting was done brilliantly. This combination of good with bad gives them a sort of charm that hasn't quit. At least, it hasn't quit yet.

The Mummy ****

Karloff's portrayal of Ardath Bey (Im-ho-tep) remains one of the best of its kind. His method of communicating intent by not doing things was ahead of its time. Zita Johann was an excellent foil for him. Her combination of demure femininity and exotic (but eccentric) sexuality make her one of the most memorable of all of Universal Studio's horror film heroines. Edward Van Sloan gave a performance that's essentially another version of his portrayal of Van Helsing but it served the film well. The rest of the cast is solid, if not remarkable.

The film has some scenes that are still chilling. The first confrontation with the reanimated Mummy is exceptional. Karloff's scenes with Johann while she's under his spell weave mysticism with an undercurrent of dark erotica in a way that pulls the viewer right into their web. Accordingly, the plight and helplessness of the individuals trying to retrieve her from the hold Bey has over her is just as compelling. The special effects used in the final confrontation between Ardath Bey and his pursuers were phenomenal then and remain impressive now.

It's still easy to see that this film is far superior to the recent remake.

The Mummy's Hand **

The sequels the film spawned that began running in 1940 weren't really sequels. The first of four featured the singing cowboy (Dick Foran) who didn't sing, a boob of a sidekick (Wallace Ford), a magician (Cecil Kellaway), a love interest (Peggy Moran) and a no-name Mummy (whose name was Tom Tyler). There's also a victim (Charles Trowbridge) who has a name (and a part worth mentioning), a couple other victims (who don't have parts that are worth mentioning) and a good (even literate) villain (George Zucco). They set off in search of the Tomb of the Princess Ananka but they find Kharis instead. Plenty of doo doo follows. All the victims fail to out run the slowest menace on the planet and Peggy Moran turns out to be the one spook film heroine with the sense to wear flat shoes. It's silly but it's a lot of fun to watch.

The Mummy's Tomb **

Two of the players from the first film returned (so they could get killed) but a new ""Mummy"" was brought on board. This time Lon Chaney was cast in the role of Kharis. He moved as slowly as Tom Tyler but at least didn't look like a moth caught in headlights the way Tyler did when caught in close-ups. The old villain (George Zucco) came back as well but had the sense to recruit a new dummy (Turhan Bey) to get shot at. In this film thirty years have passed since the first encounter and the remnants of the original cast have grown old but technology hasn't progressed a whit.

The Mummy's Ghost **

A new reincarnation of the Princess Ananka is played by Ramsay Ames. She's named ""Amina"" (which sounds like something gastric or an additive for laundry detergent) and she's surrounded by the usual lot of hapless defenders (played by nobody anyone ever heard of). They mean well but couldn't hit a barn door with a cannon. The most able among them turns out to be a little dog named ""Peanuts"". John Carradine was cast as the heavy in the piece and (except for the fact that he looks about as much like he's from Egypt as a Penguin would) he did a pretty good job with the role. Chaney was back as the Mummy as well and he lurched along at the same pace as before. He was reportedly drunk for much of the shoot but had no dialogue so the only slurring came from his left leg. For all that, he is still genuinely menacing when need be. Lon was too good an actor to ever blow it totally.

The Mummy's Curse ***

This one has to get the extra star. It has the same flaws as the rest (silly dialogue, bad acting, absurd stereotyping and non-progressive technology) but the plot is more interesting and the casting is better. Peter Coe (as the heavy) at least seems as if he could be from someplace other than America. Virginia Christine took the role of Ananka and, though she didn't look like she could be from Egypt, was exotic enough to conjure the idea of being from somewhere far away. Chaney also gave his best performance in the role of Kharis. His movements are still slow but the raw strength and relentless nature of the character were depicted well. That alone could have set it above the rest.",1112054400,43,5565,4.60343087790111
1620942,3,B00005LC4N,"Okay, so maybe the classic Universal ""Mummy"" movies aren't all that terrifying, but they're still fun...innocent, guileless fun. The Karloff original is, of course, the best (and is it just me or is he doing a conscious imitation of Bela Lugosi in his first appearance as ""Ardeth Bey?""), but the sequels all have their own merits.  ""The Mummy's Hand"" is the prototype for the film that Woody Allen satirized in ""The Purple Rose of Cairo,"" and it's sequel, ""The Mummy's Tomb,"" is the best of the Chaney series (he truly looks like the walking, painful dead in this one).  ""The Mummy's Ghost"" is probably the worst, with a laughable turn by John Carradine and bum direction by Reginald LeBorg (who, for some reason, is highly regarded), but ""The Mummy's Curse"" features what is very likely Virginia Christine's shining moment on film -- decades before her tenure as ""Mrs. Olsen.""  These aren't great movies, or even great Mummy movies (the 1959 Hammer version with Christopher Lee remains the best treatment of the subject), but they are awfully hard to dislike, still a lot of fun to watch on a Saturday-morning level.",1108339200,5,1117,4.868421052631579
1620943,4,B00005LC4N,"Of course I could probably say the above about all the Universal Legacy Collections I now own(besides this one,I also have Frankenstein,Dracula,and The Wolf Man). I'm a sucker for those great old Universal horror classics anyway,and to get an entire series of these films along with extras for such a low price...well,how can you go wrong?

The best of the bunch is,of course,the Karloff original. Much has been made about his wondeful performance,but mention should also be made about the work of Zita Johann. What a terrific actress she was,and it's a pity she didn't do more films. The Mummy does not go for the more physical terrors of the later films in the series and instead involves reincarnation and a love that goes on through the ages but is never meant to be. This illustrates the difference between the Universal horror films of the 30s with the ones of the 40s.

Speaking of which,the other movies in the set can't quite come close,and as mentioned by a previous reviewer,they tend to be repetitious when seen back to back,as I tried to do one evening. The best of the follow-ups is The Mummy's Hand,with Tom Tyler's first and only appearance as a different mummy,Kharis(as opposed to Im-Ho-Tep from the first movie). Dick Foran and Wallace Ford play a couple of guys who go on a search for the tomb of Princess Ananka,with an evil professor/Karnac high priest(George Zucco)following close behind. Here,the main mummy character is not a sad sympathetic being but rather a strong-arm henchman for the chief bad guy. But there are some fairly humorous touches and good performances to make up for some of the flaws.

There isn't much to say about the Lon Chaney Jr.ones except that they do have their moments. The firey finale at the end of The Mummy's Tomb,Princess Ananka's rising from the swamp in The Mummy's Curse,and a mild return to the reincarnation angle in The Mummy's Ghost.

I have read reviews of a number of the Legacy Collection sets and noticed that some have said they had trouble with the discs freezing,locking,etc. Like I said,I own 4 of the sets,and I have not encountered these problems. Perhaps it could be a case of disc/player incompatibility? Anyway,these films have never looked or sounded better than they do in this set. The extras are pretty neat too,including a nice documentary that focuses mainly on the first film,but does glance a bit at the sequels,a look at poster art and production stills,and audio commentary. If you're nostalgic for the great Universal horror films of the 30s and 40s,you just have to get the Legacy sets.",1105488000,,2575,4.845454545454546
1620944,4,B00005LC4N,"This box set includes 5 mummy movies.  I will rate and review each movie separately.

""The Mummy"" (1932) - 5 stars

Boris Karloff is magnificent as the living mummy Im-ho-tep, who angered the gods by reading the scroll of Thoth, which would raise the dead body of his beloved Princess Anckesen-Amon.  When Im-ho-tep's tomb is discovered over 3,700 years later and one of the archeologists reads the scroll of Thoth, Im-ho-tep is brought back to life.  He later removes his mummy wrappings and assumes the identity of Ardath Bey.  Ardath meets and falls in love with a reincarnated version of Princess Anckesen-Amon.  In the end, the Princess calls upon the goddess Isis, who zaps Ardath Bey/Im-ho-tep back into a skeleton.  This movie has withstood the test of time to become a classic.

""The Mummy's Hand"" (1940) - 3 stars

In this sequel, continuity is sacrificed at the expense of the contrived plot.  The living mummy, played by Tom Tyler, is renamed Kharis.  He remains in his mummy wrappings and slowly shuffles along for the duration of the movie.  The scroll of Thoth is discarded, as the means for reviving the mummy involve boiling tana leaves and drinking their juice.  Finally, the Princess is referred to as Princess Ananka.  The archaeologist Steve Banning (Dick Foran), his buddy Babe Jenson (Wallace Ford) and a magician named the Great Solvani (Cecil Kellaway) are played strictly for laughs.  At the end, Kharis is supposedly destroyed by being set on fire.

""The Mummy's Tomb"" (1942) - 4 stars

Lon Chaney, Jr. assumes the role of Kharis in this movie, and is a vast improvement over Tom Tyler.  A high priest brings Kharis to America to kill those responsible for desecrating the tomb and digging up Princess Ananka.  Kharis is brought to Mapleton, Massachusetts, where Steve Banning lives.  Interestingly, he resides in a mansion which looks like a Southern style plantation.  Kharis kills Steve Banning (hooray!), Steve's elderly sister (boo!), and Babe Jenson (hip hip hooray!) in quick succession.  Kharis is supposedly burned to ashes when the mansion is set on fire.

""The Mummy's Ghost"" (1944) - 4 stars

Lon Chaney, Jr. returns as Kharis, while John Carradine plays the high priest Yousef Bey.  Yousef goes to Mapleton, Mass. to revive Kharis and Princess Ananka with the tana leaves.  It works on Kharis but not on the Princess.  Fortunately for Kharis, the heroine of the movie is really the reincarnated Princess.  Yousef Bey has designs on her, which causes Kharis to kill him.  Even though there aren't any swamps to speak of in Massachusetts, Kharis and Princess Ananka are chased into a swamp, where they supposedly drown together.

""The Mummy's Curse"" (1944) - 4 stars

Continuity is once again sacrificed, as Kharis (Lon Chaney, Jr.) and the reincarnated Princess Ananka (Virginia Christine) emerge from a drained swamp in the bayous of Louisiana.  Although that setting makes perfect sense, given the Southern style mansion and swamp of the previous two movies, no explanation is given for them drowning in Massachusetts, and being dug up in Louisiana!  In the final film in this series, the reincarnated Princess Ananka is turned into a living mummy by drinking the juice of the tana leaves, while Kharis is killed when part of an old monastery collapses on him and buries him alive.  Abbott and Costello would meet a different mummy, named Klaris, in their 1955 movie.  The documentary entitled ""Mummy Dearest: A Horror Tradition Unearthed,"" the Mummy Archives of still pictures and posters, and theatrical trailers for all five movies, are excellent bonus features.

A total of 20 stars, divided by 5 movies, equals a rating of 4 stars for the box set.",1104710400,119,3693,4.9754901960784315
1620945,3,B00005LC4N,"A few months ago, as a tie-in with the movie Van Helsing, Universal came out with some nice boxed sets featuring the three great movie monsters of Dracula, the Wolf Man and Frankenstein (technically, Frankenstein's monster).  Following up on this, Universal has now come out with more sets featuring their classic monsters.  In the Mummy, we get a set of five movies that feature the title monster.

The original movie, called The Mummy, is clearly the best in the bunch.  Unlike the other movies - in which the Mummy is little more than a bandaged zombie - this movie has Boris Karloff as the villain, an ancient Egyptian brought back to life and intent on resurrecting his ancient lover.  Karloff is what makes this movie great, playing a murderous villain who nonetheless is sympathetic as he is motivated more by love than by malice.

The other four movies are merely passable B-movies that are almost interchangeable in plot.  All four deal with an ancient Egyptian cult intent on protecting the tomb of Princess Ananka and using the ancient mummy Karis to do their bidding.  Slow-moving and with only one functional arm, Karis is not the most threatening of monsters; although he could be outrun if you walked briskly away from him, he still is able to kill a number of people who are willing to stand still and wait for him to approach.

There is a nice featurette and some decent commentary on the original film, but as a whole, this set is clearly the weakest of the four mentioned.  The first movie rates maybe four-and-a-half stars, the others average around two.  With the special features, this rates a solid three stars.  For fans of old movies, this is a worthwhile buy, but the more casual viewer should approach the ""B"" parts of this collection with caution.",1100822400,37,1775,4.745928338762215
1620946,4,B00005LC4N,"The Mummy's Hand is the first sequel to the Mummy although it would not appear until eight years after the original. It opens by re-using footage from the original with just a few scenes re-shot showing Kharis stealing tana leaves replacing the scene where Karloff as Imhotep steals the scroll of Thoth.

We are introduced to Horror vet George Zucco as Andoheb, high Priest of Karnak and guardian of the secret tomb of princess Ananka. We are shown how he can control the mummy Kharis by giving him a fluid made of tana leaves.

Cut to Dick Foran as ""Steve Banning"", a down on his luck archeologist and his partner Babe Jensen. Banning makes a discovery of the location of Ananka's tomb and puts together an expedition to uncover the tomb, funded by American Magician The Great Solvini and his daugher Marta.

Soon, Andoheb sets Kharis on their trail to kill them after they discover Ananka's tomb.

The Mummy's Hand, and the later three sequels would all be ""B"" movies, re-using much stock footage. There isn't really much of a plot here other than to give Zucco a change to let the Mummy (played by western star Tim Tyler) run wild...well, shamble wild. But hey..the second sycle of Horror was running wild at Universal so they were cranking these out fast.

Foran is the usual handsome hero and Wallace Ford as Babe jenson provides the usual sidekick comic relief so common in these movies.

Certainly no classic and director Christy Cabanne was NO Karl Freund...but it's still a fun movie and a quick watch at just over 60 minutes.

""The Mummy's Tomb"" is a direct sequel to the ""Mummy's Hand and takes place 30 years later.  Almost the entire first 12 minutes of the movie uses footage from the Mummy's Hand as Steve Banning, now an old man, relates the events of discovering Anankas tomb and fighting the Mummy Kharis, as he speaks to his son, John and his fiancee Isabel.

Universal was never above trying to save a few bucks by re-using footage from previous films.

We also find out that the High Priest Andoheb (George Zucco) and the mummy were not killed and that Andoheb is passing on guardianship of Kharis on to Mehemet Bey (Turhan Bey).  He is to go to America and destroy Banning and his family for desecrating Ananka's tomb.

We now cut to Mapleton, MA, as Kharis begins his nighly rampages of revenge.  Wallace Ford Reprises his role as ""Babe"" although strangely his last name is changed from Jensen to Hanson.

The other big change is Lon Chaney Jr. taking over in his first go as the Mummy, Kharis.  He cuts a more imposing figure than Tim Tyler and the makeup was far superior as he appeared much more decrepit can decayed.

Overall it was a refreshing change to move the setting to the States where everyday people were encountering the Mummy in a terror.",1099872000,6,2776,4.6232179226069245
1620947,5,B00005LC4N,"Legacy is to be commended for restoring this collection of Mummy movies so beautifully. After buying this and seeing the wonderful job they did I intend to buy the rest of the collections for Dracula, Frankenstein, Werewolf, and the Invisible Man. The movies themselves are great. The care shown in transferring them to DVD is always appreciated when it is done right. In this collection the original ""The Mummy"" with Boris Karloff is amazing. This movie alone is worth the price. Karloff was able to scare you with his eyes. He knew how to pull an audience in with his expressions and mannerisms. What a wonderful voice as well. Is it any wonder they used it in ""The Monster Mash"" or for the original Grinch?

I highly recommend this collection if you are a fan of the old black & white monster movies. Even people that are new to these movies will probably find them entertaining. This collection is on two DVDs. The first contains ""The Mummy"" movie, commentary, documentary, and other extras. The second disc has the other four mummy movies. ""The Mummy's Hand"" is a favorite of mine. The addition of Tanna leaves to the storyline is a nice touch. Good cast, story, and music make it a classic. It even has some comedy that doesn't detract from the scare factor. The other three on this disc are fun to watch as well. The collections picture quality is incredibly sharp and the sound is excellent. The level of detail can't be beat. Anyone that saw these movies on TV before this restoration will definitely appreciate the quality.",1099180800,8,1533,4.698884758364312
1620948,5,B00005LC4N,"This MUMMY collection continues the magnificent spree of monster movies from universal! Boris Karloff is Im-Ho-Tep, the 4,000 year old cadaver in the title feature. He is inadvertantly re-animated by a group of archaeologists, and sets out to find his long-long lost love (played by the amazing Zita Johann). Boris is at his horrid best! His stare alone is worth the price of this set! THE MUMMY'S HAND- There's a new mummy in town, and his name is Kharis! This time around we've got Steve Banning and Babe Jenson (Dick Foran and Wallace Ford), an Abbot-and-Costello-esque pair of archaeologists out to find the tomb of princess Ananka. Along the way, they enlist the financial aid of a magician and his daughter. This is the first of the ""step-scrape"" mummy movies (as they're reffered to in SPIDER BABY) with a shambling Kharis attempting to choke anyone who tampers with Ananka's resting place. Not bad at all! George Zucco (The Flying Serpent, Dead Men Walk) is the high priest of Arkham, trying to stop the Banning expedition by setting Kharis loose. Those mystical tanna leaves are introduced as a means of both feeding and controlling Kharis. THE MUMMY'S TOMB- Lon Chaney jr. gets wrapped up for his turn as Kharis. Turhan Bey (The Amazing Mr. X) is the high priest of Arkham, set on wiping out the descendants of the Banning party. Kharis goes on his merry way, hopped up on tanna leaves, strangling those unlucky enough to meet him! Will any survive? Very good. THE MUMMY'S GHOST- Lon jr. is back as Kharis. George Zucco hands over his fez to the new high priest of Arkham, John Carradine (Shock Waves, Astro Zombies). Kharis gets his Ananka (in the form of a beautiful egyptian girl who works at the local college) and carries her into the swamp, where both submerge. THE MUMMY'S CURSE- Lon Chaney jr. dons the moldy bandages one last time. Princess Ananka rises from her muddy grave in one of the best scenes of the series! She's dazed and doesn't remember her own identity. Ananka is taken in by some kindly cajun folks. Soon, Kharis comes for her, killing all who stand in his way. A decent way to end this mumm-a-thon!

I eagerly snatched up the monster legacy package with Dracula,Frankenstein,and the Wolfman in a box w/3 nice busts. Now another 3 legacy dvd's were released,but separately this time and no busts. Bummer. Oh well,this Mummy set(Invisible Man and Creature from the black lagoon sets were also released) is great! Boris Karloff's great original is first where his whole movie is ignored in the sequels where a different storyline and mummy are established. I guess Universal knew that,without Karloff,direct sequels wouldn't have worked. The sequels are good fun and Lon Chaney jr's Mummy is fantastic. Tom Tyler is the mummy in THE MUMMY'S HAND and is a weak performance in my opinion.

Extras:

A commentary track for the first film,a nice documentary,Archives,and trailers.

The Mummy - sadly it appears to be the same transfer, there is no improvement over the old release.

The Mummy's Hand - somewhat improved.

The Mummy's Tomb - somewhat improved.

The Mummy's Curse - almost the same, I give the edge to the old version, but it's really a toss-up.

The Mummy's Ghost - noticeable improvement in contrast and detail.

1620952,5,B00005LC4N,"I have wondered for so long why the classic 1930s/1940s Universal monster films were out of print. These are (to try not to use an overused description) really classic films. These were mainstays of my Saturday afternoon monster features on TV when I was a kid. Well, finally we're seeing the re-releases, and a great set of packages, too.

The true gem of the Mummy series is the original. No modern day photo trickery and CGI can compete with the truly scary visual of Karloff's illuminated eye close ups as Ardeth Bey! The entire story is wonderfully compelling, and has remained one of my favorites of the Universal series over the years.

The Kharis mummy versions are fun, no doubt about that, but a foot dragging mummy surviving on tana leaves while searching for his lost princess Anaka pales to the Karloff interpretation of love lost and life sacrificed. Still, I was very pleased to see the inclusion of these films in the package, along with the bonuses, and really a very attractive sales price. My video tapes from over-the-air broadcasts of these films can finally be retired.

As for some of the other Universals, I held back on Dracula as I have the prior DVD which includes the extended groaning at the finale, something missing on the re-release. And I paid a slight premium for Frankenstein on an out of print DVD; but I may add these collections at a later date.

If you're a fan of the Universal monster machine of this time period, there is no reason not to add them to your collection.",1098230400,2,1509,4.640449438202247

We have other great classic monster movies also lets put them out on dvd to.  So i thank Stephen Sommers for making Van Helsing for one reson, THE MONSTER LEAGACY COLLECTION!

Universal Studios has descriptions of these DVDs on their website, and they have described them as being in black and white - which is great news. Just do a search on their website and you'll see it.

Anyhow, this is a great collection for fans of old Universal Monster films. Obviously, ""The Mummy"" with Boris Karloff is the best of the bunch. But the other four films on this DVD are great fun too. They don't have the same mummy in them as the first Mummy film did, but they're great classic horror and that's what counts. I can't wait to have this collection!",1093219200,10,673,4.384
1620955,5,B00005LC4N,"I was very pleased with the first Legacy sets (aside from the bad-taste tie-in documentaries that try to convince audiences that Stephen Sommers' Van Helsing franchise was an acceptable homage to these classics). I was however very happy to see the studio include ALL the extras from their previous releases. I was desperately hoping there would be more sets, but did not honestly expect them to arrive until Van Helsing 2, and only for the monsters he decides to trash in that film. So Universal is doing something truly great by now covering the Mummy, the Invisible Men (and Woman), and the Gill Man.

However, two things now worry me: Will we get busts of these three characters in a Deluxe package? And more importantly: Will we also get a miscellaneous Legacy set to polish off the last 11 films of their classic horror line?: The Phantom of the Opera (1943), The Climax, Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (should've been on the Frankenstein set), "" "" "" the Mummy (why isn't this on the Mummy Legacy set?),  "" "" "" the Invisible Man (and why isn't this on the Invisible Legacy set?), "" "" "" Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde, the Wild Woman trilogy, The Mad Ghoul, and The Mole People?

Yes, I know its easy enough to simply buy the two Abbott and Costello sets that feature the monsters, but the bulk of people wanting those specific films are largely the ones already buying the monster sets; So why not add them to the official Legacy series as well? At the very least put out one last Legacy set that covers these remaining films.

Give us that last set of films Universal, with busts of the Bride of Frankenstein, a Mole Man, and the Phantom, and I think all collectors will be ecstatic to finally have all 37 classic Universal horror releases in this excellent packaging.",1092182400,5,1776,4.593059936908517
1620956,4,B00005LC4N,"Having already purchased these films on VHS, plus ""The Mummy Collection"" laserdisc box set, I was eager for a DVD release of ""The Mummy's Hand"" starring Tom Tyler, George Zucco and Peggy Moran (who, very sadly, passed away recently) and ""The Mummy's Tomb"" starring George Zucco, Turban Bey, Lon Chaney, Jr. and Elyse Knox (Mark Harmon's Mom).  Apparently, according to other reviews here, in the first run of this DVD there was a formatting error, with the two features not in the correct order on the DVD top menu or title page.  However, it must have been corrected in subsequent runs because when I put the DVD in the player the Title Menu displayed the films correctly and defaulted to the ""The Mummy's Hand"" (1940) first on the left and displaying ""The Mummy's Tomb"" (1942), to be watched second, on the right of the screen.  Also, I had no problem getting back to the title page menu to watch the second film (and sequel) ""The Mummy's Tomb.  I used the ""Top menu"" (or title button some players) button from the menu page with my Toshiba player.
  I thought the prints used were in good condition with ""Hand"" showing a little more wear than ""Tomb"".  The dvd prints seemed almost identical to the Laserdisc edition.  Maybe some small further scratches on ""The Mummy's Hand"", but the film was over 60 years old when the transfer was done (2001) and Universal did a commendable job.  There was a scene from ""The Mummy's Tomb"" that was censored in 1942 and deleted from some theatrical and TV prints as well as the 1993 VHS edition release.  Over a minute of the film, where the elderly character actress and Universal player Mary Gordon is strangled by the mummy (Lon Chaney, Jr.) was cut.  It was restored to the 1994 Laserdisc box set edition and is included here.  The print of ""Tomb"" was also cleaned up and is in very good condition. Sound restoration work is obvious on the audio tracks of both films. Dolby digital two channel mono English and Spanish soundtracks are included for both movies, plus English and French Subtitles.  While light on extras, the dvd is a lot of fun and I am glad these films are available again for kids of all ages.",1050364800,13,2153,4.604712041884817
1620957,4,B00005LC4N,"I'm sorry that Universal has stopped producing its deluxe DVD editions of its classic horror films. While it's nice getting two films for the price of one, I would have preferred that several of these films be issued individually with commentaries and a documentary.  OK, not all the films in this last batch deserve that treatment but such beloved classics as Son of Frankenstein, Son of Dracula and Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman certainly do.  No question The Black Cat should also be released in a deluxe edition (when they get around to releasing it) as it is one of the very greatest of all horror films.  I would also argue that The Mummy's Hand is worthy of special treatment as it is a benchmark horror film and easily the best of its series (if you don't include the original The Mummy).  For one thing, it established the whole mythology of Kharis and has influenced every mummy film made since.  Universal's latest remake starring Brandon Frasier owes more to The Mummy's Hand than it does The Mummy.  In fact, it's a remake that follows the 1940 film's storyline very closely.  The films features a top-notch cast including George Zucco in what is arguably his most memorable role.  The script combines horror and humor in a manner not unlike its 1999 remake.  No actor has ever made a more frightening mummy than Tom Tyler - tremendous care was taken with the make-up and optical effects to make him look very ghoulish - and his facial expressions are much more restrained and effective than Chaney or the CGI mummy in the new films.  Most of the music is lifted from Frank Skinner's score for Son of Frankenstein however H.J. Salter did contribute a few unforgettable cues that are now indelibly linked with Kharis and his romantic story.  Fortunately, the film's lead actress is still with us and I wish Universal had taken advantage of the opportunity to interview Peggy Moran about her memories making this film as well as her other films at Universal in the early 40s.  So few actors survive from these films that it seems a shame not to capture their stories on tape if they are willing to do so.  Imagine the audio commentary she could have given us! I can't get very excited when it comes to the three Chaney mummy films although here again the studio should have invited Turhan Bey to record his recollections of working on the film.  That would have been interesting - probably more so than the film itself.  There are individual scenes in these Chaney films that I enjoy watching (the cemetery scenes in Tomb are beautifully done) but I can't sit through them complete without getting a little bored.  Still, this is a very good DVD overall despite the lack of extras.  I did notice a lot of wear on the print of Mummy's Hand.  Maybe it's time Universal restore it.

Tom Tylers performance in The Mummy's Hand was exceptional, he was scarrrrry, they chose to black out his eyes and I felt that added to his look of being one of the scariest of all time. The Mummy's hand is actually a romantic film in a strange kind of way, but I guess they all are when you come to think of it....saving the beautiful girl.

1620959,3,B00005LC4N,"THE MUMMY'S HAND/THE MUMMY'S TOMB were the 1st 2 sequels of Universal's classic THE MUMMY, which starred Boris Karloff. However, while the original had Karloff's Imhotep in bandages for only about 5 minutes before appearing as a VERY wrinkled wizard, the sequels had the Mummy fully wrapped in these 2 flicks. Basically the films tell the tale of Kharis, who basically had the same back story as Imhotep: being buried alive for trying revive his dead lover, called Ananka here. The films also tell of a expedition that dig up Ananka's tomb, and occur the wrath of the Mummy. Obviously, both films end up using stock footage in padding their stories...you even see the villagers of the original FRANKENSTEIN waving their torches at one point in THE MUMMY'S TOMB. Tom Tyler, who plays the Mummy in the first film, lends a chilling presence. It also helps that his eyes are blacked-out in the editing room, adding to the creep factor. His successor, Lon Chaney, Jr., is somewhat less successful. With what looks more like a mask, Cheney seems less scary in comparison. At a little over than an hour each, the movies definitely do not drag in pacing. The DVD transfers are very sharp, but the lack of special features is disappointing.

1620960,4,B00005LC4N,"Not much has been made out of these new 'double-featurette' Monster set-ups yet. I picked this particular set up at a local store before buying any more. The transfers are very sharp looking and of high quality; there are sure no complaints about how the movies themselves look.
However, sad to say that these are pretty lacking in the cool extras that the original classic Monster releases had - track commentary, mini-documentaries and photo galleries are completely missing. What you do get for extras (assuming this set is indicative of the rest of the 2-for-1 releases) are sparse 'text only' production notes which may hold a little interest for fans; select cast bios and filmography; and vintage trailers for the movies (I do not recall seeing a 'Mummy's Tomb' trailer before so that was kind of cool). And for what little it is worth the jewel-box packaging art/design is also pretty disappointing (...). On the other hand, it is kind of nice of Universal to go for a somewhat more economically minded 'two for the price of one' format with these releases; I guess if they had to sacrifice some of the extras to acheive this.....personally I (like many serious fans) would rather have paid more and seen the documentaries and heard the commentary!
All things considered; the movies themselves are the bottom line and if this set is a fair representation of the rest of the new series, they look great and are definetely worth picking up. Sadly, a lack of cool extras as we had become used to with the original Classic Monsters DVD releases knock these a little bit down from 'Must Own' status.",999388800,9,1602,4.787003610108303
