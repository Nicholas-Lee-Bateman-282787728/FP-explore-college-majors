4504711,3,B004Z29XEI,"A young couple falls in love in college, but the woman is here on a student visa. She overstays her visa, and is later unable to return to be with him after attending her sister's wedding. Over the course of time, they grow apart and then come back together, always facing the dilemma of how they are going to make their relationship work. On the positive side, I appreciate the dilemma that the couple faces, deciding between others that they have connected with and getting back together. The negative of this film is that the natural course of events appears to be for them to grow apart, living on separate continents, and the movie just does not let it happen. Overall, the positive outweighs the negative enough to get a recommendation.",1321056000,,742,4.67175572519084
4504712,3,B004Z29XEI,"There is a level of genuine intimacy generated by the two actors, Felicity Jones and Anton Yelchin (Chekhov in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek/dp/B002HWRYJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek</a>&nbsp;reboot), playing the young lovers in this low-key, low-budget 2011 indie romantic drama directed and co-written by Drake Doremus. Apparently, he and co-scenarist Ben York Jones wrote a fifty-page outline for the movie and allowed the actors to flesh out the story by having them improvise most of their lines. The net result is a level of naturalness achieved in their performances that comes across without contrivance, no small feat given how predictable most love-at-first-sight movies can be. However, there is a nagging conventionality and a relative imbalance to the love story that makes the film fall short of its emotional objective with this viewer.

Yelchin and Jones play Jacob and Anna, senior-year college students in LA who fall in love shortly before the latter is to return to her native London. Naturally, there is a meet-cute set-up that leads to a hesitant first date that leads them headlong into unbridled romance. So smitten are they with each other that Anna overstays her student visa and doesn't return home on schedule. When she tries to return to LA, she is detained by immigration officials and forced to go home. What occurs is a long-distance relationship hampered by their separate burgeoning careers (she becomes a magazine writer/blogger, he a furniture designer), the fragility of love, and the fear of commitment. Their hopeless naivet in a post-9/11 world is a plot device that forces each of them to decide what they are willing to do to invest in their relationship.

It is at this point that each seems to divert since Anna is willing to make all the hard choices whereas Jacob appears comparatively passive in his commitment. Perhaps it would have been excessive (and maybe a bit boring) to have both lovers follow their hearts in equal proportion, but the gap does undermine what would have made the relationship more compelling to witness beyond the standard romantic montages and overtures seen in like-minded films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Notebook/dp/B000683VI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Notebook</a>, for example). While both lead actors are affecting and perceptive in their respective roles, the charismatic Jones has the advantage of playing a character that is far more transparent in her motivations. Yelchin is saddled with the more elliptical role where we are left to guess how far he is willing to commit.

Compelling in just a few scenes as Jacob's comely assistant Sam, Jennifer Lawrence (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winter-s-Bone/dp/B003EYVXTG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winter's Bone</a>) is the inevitable temptation in his path, while Charlie Bewley makes less of an impression as Anna's neighbor Simon. Familiar TV actors Alex Kingston and Oliver Muirhead play Anna's supportive parents with measured gusto, while another familiar small-screen face, Finola Hughes (""General Hospital""), nicely plays Anna's boss. Framed by John Guleserian's hand-held digital camerawork, the film benefits from the incisive way Doremus staged several of the key scenes, especially the ones that highlight the intermittent disconnects between the lovers, and the young filmmaker shrewdly provides an ambiguous ending allowing viewers to fill in the blanks with the future of Jacob's and Anna's relationship. Nonetheless, the film just didn't leave an indelible impression on me.",1320537600,21,3679,5.860074626865671
4504713,5,B004Z29XEI,"Okay, others have written what this movie is about, so I won't go there. I was drawn to this movie by the two stars, the late Anton Yelchin from Star Trek and Felicity Jones of Star Wars Rogue One.  Of course this was made before Rogue One . For those who complained of continuity problems, or being confused, tell me how you would show the long passages of time. This romance covered a very long stretch of time.  I think the director and editor did a tremendous job of telling a complicated love story without showing this happened, then this happened. I had no problem figuring out  what was happening to the characters between times they saw each other. The little clues that were presented were enough to do that. If everything was spelled out the movie would have been at least an hour longer. The ending was perfect. I'm sure if they ocntined the story in a sequel old flames would resurface.  As far as the chemistry between Yelchin and Jones, I would not be surprised if they continued with an off screen affair. They seemed in love. I'm sure Felicity Jones was devastated when Anton died in that freak accident.  I very highly recommend this movie.",1492300800,,1158,4.548076923076923
4504714,5,B004Z29XEI,I loved this film.  It reminded me a little bit of the 1970 film Love Story.  Very down to earth realistic portrayal of young love.  Excellent acting all around and great chemistry between Yelchin and Jones.  Very honest and for real dialogue.  Some of the scenes brought back to mind the first time I was in love.  Jennifer Lawrence's performance was perfect as usual.  She has an amazing screen persona and of course is very beautiful to look at as well.  If you're looking for a good old fashioned story about young love I would highly recommend seeing this film.,1490918400,,566,4.59

4504718,2,B004Z29XEI,"This movie had a couple of serious faults to me.  First, there was a lack of continuity - the viewer is left to realize that time has elapsed, some are apart, others are together in the progression from scene to scene.  Second, the camera work is not good.  Apparently hand held, and thus the frame is shifting unnecessarily which is hard on the eyes.

4504722,3,B004Z29XEI,"Good premise, some good acting, but for me, disconnected and poorly told story. The character development, especially those of their ""other"" loves (Jennifer Lawrence and Charley Bewley I think is his name), isn't there; those two just sort of appear in their lives and while we see that they appear to be genuinely in love with the main characters, there is no background to set it up a little better. Felicity is very good, fragile and beautiful, and Anton (Yelchin) is quite believable, but I kept asking myself why they didn't just marry sooner and avoid all that grief. Or, perhaps show a great deal more patience and strength, to match their professed love for one another. Too easily distracted. Again, some good acting but didn't make the cut for me.",1485129600,,757,4.786259541984733

4504742,5,B004Z29XEI,"Oh, this film. I loved SO many of its elements (heh) ""like crazy"" -- the improvised performances; the inventive cuts and time transitions; the swoon-worthy first act; the always-outstanding Jennifer Lawrence in a key supporting role. Some say that the central structure forcing the two main characters apart feels a little unrealistic. But this is a movie that spotlights (and, in my opinion, absolutely nails) the *feelings* surrounding first love -- the euphoria, the urgency, the jealousy, the doubt, the aching loneliness, the bittersweet nostalgia. I initially found myself wondering why any guy would choose chair-making over the apparent love of his life. But after a second viewing (made almost unbearably poignant by the far-too-soon death of the stellar Anton Yelchin), I came away with a clearer impression. I think your feelings toward this story -- and your interpretation of its endpoint -- depend a lot on the personal life experience you project onto it. This movie illustrates how easy it is to fall in love with the IDEA of love. It shows how paradoxically overpowering yet incredibly fragile love can be. I always felt that Yelchin struck an intriguingly passive balance with his character; one that actually seems to increase as the central relationship hits roadblock after roadblock. It's the lovestruck Anna often driving things forward -- and ultimately, they (and we) are faced with the question of what's left. I consider this movie a true marvel -- well-acted, incredibly honest, sweetly nostalgic, insightful, absolutely heartbreaking. Definitely worth a watch ... or two.",1466640000,,1600,5.303149606299213

SPOILER ALERT
The film is basically a transconntinal love affair, she Anna from England, he Jacob from the USA and L.A. Anna visiting the USA on a student visa meets and falls in love with Jacob while she's in L.A. The two are drawn closer, dating, spending more and more time together. Until Anna is forced to leave the USA because of a student visa violation for overstaying her visit in the USA. The two lovers torn apart separated by an ocean, text and talk to each other, telling each other how much each misses the other. Jacob visits Anna in England and the two realize that the travelling back and forth would prove to be very costly for the young lovers.  The two despondent try to cope and go about their lives. Jacob has found a new love interest with his gorgeous new employee.
Enter Jennifer Lawrence as Samantha. Never have I seen such a gorgeous and welcomed entrance by an actress. Her long blonde hair glorious curvaceous figure and her charismatic personality just demonstrates even this early in Jennifers career why she is a superstar actress. Jacob enjoys the company of his new love interest Samantha, she is more fun filled than Anna. I like many other males watching this film fantasize about being with the hot sizzling Jennifer Lawrence as Samantha. I know my heart beat picked up and my eyes enjoyed the pleasure of seeing Samantha.  We see Jacob and Samantha at a nightclub partying and having a great time. Suddenly while on the dance floor Jacob receives multiple texts from Anna in England for him to call her.  This is where Anna starts acting crazy and Jacob starts to get stupid. Now while Anna is kind of cute, Samantha is sizzling Hot!! 99.9% of guys would pick Samantha over Anna. So Jacob answers the call, Samantha suspects that Anna is about steal her guy from her. While Anna is selfish and possessive, Samantha is forgiving and understanding along with being far more beautiful than Anna.
Jacob makes hits first stupid idiotic move, he lives Samantha and travels to England to be reunited with Anna.  Anna corrals Jacob into marrying her believing that it would open the door for the two to return to the USA. Not happening! The ban on her travel is still in effect because of her student visa violation. Now the two are stuck at a crossroad situation. How do they make their marriage work?  The stress of their dream plan faltering brings out the anger suppressed within the two.  Anna and Jacob both have careers in different countries. The stress brings about a screaming argument between the two.
Jacob leaves Anna and returns to L.A. and a forgiving Samantha. Wow what a woman! Now at the same time Anna begins dating a young Brit named Simon. They have a close loving relationship to the point where Simon proposes to Anna.  Anna plays it cool and doesnt accept his proposal. Ok now back to L.A. Jacob is in bed with the sexy gorgeous Samantha, while she sleeps Jacob receives a text from guess who? Anna, she texts I miss you The stupid Jacob upon learning that Anna has the travel ban lifted agrees to go back to her.
Upon Annas return to L.A. her meeting with Jacob is sort of awkward and not as passionate and fun filled relationship that Jacob had with Samantha.  Right away Anna complains about not being able to find a job like the great job she gave up in England.  The two seem to be lovers who have career issues that interfere with their romantic lives. This uneasy compromise by Anna being in L.A. one could see is not going to work out. Will Samantha be waiting on the sidelines ready to comeback to Jacob? Word of advice for Anna STAY IN ENGLND!! Leave Jacob alone so he can find real happiness with Samantha! The Four stars I give all of them to the fabulous young Jennifer Lawrence appearing as Samantha!",1461888000,,3793,4.574374079528718

4504799,5,B004Z29XEI,"""Like Crazy"" is a euphemism for the zig-zagging way all too many relationships really resolve themselves. Jacob (Anton Yelchin) and Anna (Felicity Jones) are both students in the same college class in CA.  She is from England and is studying in the US on a student visa.  There is a definite attraction between them; and it is Anna who initiates the contact that leads to a serious relationship. They are both so enamoured with each other that she decides to violate her visa and remains an additional two months prior to returning to England. When she returns to the US, her previous violation catches up with her and Anna is not allowed back into the country. This sets into motion a major problem for the two lovers: how to overcome the self-created distance between them, remain faithful to each other, and overcome the new barriers to re-entry into the US.  (As an aside, one cannot help but think about the laxity of our own NSA agents at times when it comes to allowing others back in with expired visas who could potentially be a genuine threat - think 9/11; or the ongoing problem of solving our immigration situation.) Even after Jacob and Anna marry in England, she still is not being allowed back into the US. There is a definite question of fairness and sense of overkill that affected this viewer. Perhaps some additional message was being sent to its audience in this film. Indeed, it takes four months for a breakthrough to occur.  However, in the interim, both Jacob and Anna have hooked up with other partners despite their best efforts to resist the temptation.  What happens next, I leave to the next DVD viewer (no ""spoilers"" here).  Suffice it to say, that the performance of both actors is so natural and so good that the viewer feels that he/she is actually being drawn into a credible real life romantic relationship progression. You emotionally ""feel"" for them as well as their new found partners (Jennifer Lawrence of The Hunger Games is excellent as one of them) as they all go through a trial and tribulation period.  Flashbacks in the mind of Anna when first she and Jacob began their dating are a nice and relevant touch towards the final denouement. How to overcome the challenges of being apart, then together, then apart again, is the real message of this fine film.",1432771200,,2300,4.706467661691542

There aren't any evil agendas at work here...just four people who are unable or unwilling to be alone for any length of time, despite how much less ""like crazy"" that might make their lives in the long run.

4504811,3,B004Z29XEI,This film started off up beat and kind of fun.  But about half way thru it sort of lost its verve.  And I started to lose interest. The one interesting thing about this film is that it was shot with no script but rather with scenes and the actors ad lib'ed with the Director's suggestions guiding them.  I also understand that their street scenes were shot gorilla style rather than the big studio set-ups we usually see.  It opened the door to others who want to shoot a short film or even a feature on a very low budget.,1424390400,3,522,4.242424242424242
4504812,4,B004Z29XEI,"Good movie. I almost think that material was too heavy to be condensed into such a short time, but it was well done.",1424390400,,116,4.086956521739131

4504814,5,B004Z29XEI,"I'm seeing numerous reviews about the characters and how they are boring and cheat a lot. Those reviews are wrong. These characters portray a great amount of everything that goes into a long distance relationship. They are hurt but trying to move on with their lives as they each just graduated. Through the movie you can tell they are slowly growing apart, which is tragic in itself considering they had such strong feelings for one another in the beginning. I do agree that the female character seems to be the one taking control for the most part, but that's how she is! She's take charge and he's low key so that's just how their personalities are portrayed.
As far as the cheating, they are so conflicted. They each want eachother and struggle with loneliness, barely able to even speak because of the time difference. With the constant uncertainty of when they will be seeing eachother next and if they'll ever be able to be together, they seek other relationships in the meantime. I know most people think love stories should be all butterflies and rainbows 24/7 but just because this movie has REALNESS to it does not mean the characters are disgusting and the plot is boring.",1423699200,,1184,4.72463768115942

4504822,5,B004Z29XEI,"This is a truly beautiful movie displaying the trials of maintaining a failing long-distance relationship. The chemistry between the main characters Anna and Jacob is outstanding. Anyone who has been in this situation can relate to this couple, it actually made me cry the first time I saw it because I saw a bit of my own past reflected in it. This isn't your typical Hollywood romance story, and this is why I think a lot of people don't like the movie. I love this aspect of it. It's a fresh story- you haven't exactly seen this a million times so it's uniqueness makes it worth the watch. A lot of people are expecting the usual storyline of two characters falling in love, experiencing an obstacle, and overcoming it. This movie's plot was based on what really happened to the director and his ex wife. There is a lot of improvisation in this movie, making everything feel closer to reality, spontaneous,  and less scripted. This movie is not supposed to leave you with a lovey dovey cute feeling, it's simply a story told with a different formula than most are used to. Go into it with an open mind. A lot of people think the ending is ambiguous- (SPOILER) It's not. They've been fighting for so long for their relationship, even giving up multiple times. Now that they are together after all of that time, they aren't sure what's really left anymore. The spark they had in the beginning of their relationship is gone because not only have they put so much energy into getting past barriers, they have both grown past it over time. The point isn't for viewers to wonder what they will do, it's to simply display how complex relationships can be which is much more of a realistic ending than most romance films give us.",1416096000,2,1724,4.5792880258899675

4504842,1,B004Z29XEI,This is not an uplifting love story. The movie drags on with indecision and moral ambivalence ending with dismal confusion and relationship ineptitude.,1405814400,2,151,5.608695652173913
4504843,3,B004Z29XEI,"This is a movie that is bound to draw out emotions in most people.  When I read that the dialogue for the film was improvised by the actors I knew that the thing that made the movie believable and down to earth had also made the storyline weaker, in my opinion.  It is a movie about relationships and how frail that they can be when the two people are separated by a great distance.

It's hard to do a proper review without some spoilers in this case so I'll just try to be as vague as I can and say that the characters actions left me very cold and in the end I truly didn't understand if this was supposed to be a movie about some great love story or one that showed the futility of long-distance love.

For me this is firmly in the middle as it's not one I could highly recommend and it's also not one that I could say to avoid at all costs.",1405382400,,844,4.005952380952381

4504868,4,B004Z29XEI,"This movie is everything you could ask for in a raw chick-flick. It is brilliantly directed and acted- Felicity Jones is particularly sensational. It's a perfect roller-coaster of emotions in the relationship of two young lovers separated by an expired visa. The story makes you want to fall as deeply in love as the two main characters, just maybe under better circumstances. Still, it's a sweet- and at times bittersweet- story of true love. Jennifer Lawrence has a tiny role in this film, which is mildly entertaining in itself since she sky-rocketed to stardom immediately after this movie was released.

Also, I don't get the hype about felicity jones. She's pretty blas. I wish they'd switched her and Jennifer Lawrence. Come to think of it, switch Anton Yeltsin with the guy that played simon.

4504903,5,B004Z29XEI,"Hollywood clichspeople claim to hate them, and yet millions of people still flock to the theatre to watch them. A superhero is selfish and greedy, until a terrible villain comes to life. He then inevitably defeats the bad guy, gets the girl, and becomes the most wonderful human being to ever walk the planet.  The girl falls in love with the boy, there is dramatic heartbreak, and then it is resolved with passionate declarations of true love and romantic kissing in the rain. Sound familiar? Like Crazy is not one of these tales. The film stars Anton Yelchin, an American college student, and Felicity Jones, a British foreign exchange student. Their relationship becomes complicated when they are forced to separate due to visa issues. The hardship of staying connected in a long distance relationship is a main theme in the film, as well as the question of validity of soul mates and true love.
I know what you're thinking: typical Hollywood movie. What makes this movie so raw and different is the fact that there was no script. Yep, you read that right - NO SCRIPT!
How can you make a movie without a script? It is no easy task, and requires excellent actors and actresses who have the ability to improvise with each other. The cast was given a storyline of what was to happen. They were then set free to interpret what two real people would say and do in each situation. Quite a bit of the movie is either silent or just dialogue, with some soft songs playing in the background. At times it almost feels like you are spying through a window on two peoples blossoming romance. It feels extremely real, and that is one of the things that makes this movie so special.
Another positive aspect of this film is the budget that it was produced with: $250, 000.00. Compared to most other films, (27 Dresses, $30 million; Titanic, $100 million; Spiderman 3, $200 million) this movie was made with vastly less cost, and the product is one of much more realism and depth. The filming was shot extremely well also, with many simple shots of the two lovers talking or just walking and holding hands, enjoying the moment. The viewer is allowed to enjoy the moment with them. The way in which Like Crazy is filmed and performed truly makes it a unique piece of cinema. The development of the storyline feels truly realistic, and it goes along at a pace that is natural and easy to keep up with.
Some people have claimed this movie is boring. Others have said it is full of awkward pauses and moments of strange humor. I argue that these moments are what make this film truly inspiring to watch. Isnt real life filled with these things on a daily basis?
If you are the type of individual who only watches movies to get away from feeling the sadness of your own life, or just enjoy happy endings and up beat pop music, then you might as well stop reading, because this movie is not for you. However, if you are a person who truly enjoys a great plot and cinematic development, and values movies that challenge your thinking, you MUST see this movie! Like Crazy will make you think of things you have never thought of before and make you feel so attached to the characters and the story that you may not know what to do with yourself at the end.
These are the movies that are truly magnificent movies that are real, movies that make you think, movies that inspire. Are you ready to experience real life on screen? Go for it. After all, its only an hour and a half of your life.",1392595200,,3466,4.51033386327504

4504933,1,B004Z29XEI,"That is SUCH an odd comparison, I know. So let me explain.

First, I DESPISED LLV (Leaving LV), but I did like parts of LC (Like Crazy). LLV felt totally worthless to me--not only a why-bother movie but a worse-for-the-watching movie. A wasted life, a horrible end. My only moniker for this movie was ""No redeeming qualities.""

LC has moments worth watching and redeeming qualities. It is not a romance, b/c as other viewers point out, the two main characters are dedicated neither to the nobility nor virtue of real love--the value of what love is and does (that which withstands the onslaughts). They are two young, restless souls reflecting today's current popular values of love works as long as it is convenient. But, with that as its base, until the last half hour and especially the end, it had its points as a good movie. As the reviews before show, it brings up a lot of good questions--what is love? Should we cheat? Is monogamy important?--which is what a good movie does.

***SPOILER ALERT***-----------------------------------

Where it left me with the LLV sense was the end. ALL that, I mean ALLLLL that, and then they are together and not feeling it is right? NOTHING builds up to this end (poor plot development) and there is no explanation as to why. It seems to me a cheap jump into an attempted emotional manipulation of the viewer. Let's just screw the emotions of the watchers for the sake of jacking them around and to attempt some dark, dramatic splash. For the purpose of appearing the current definition of artistic? I'm not sure.

Point is, if you really want to move the viewer in the way this end implies, you have to, HAVE TO, give some support for the emotional segue. Every other time Anna and Jacob got together the past was forgotten and the enjoyment of being together eclipsed the problems in getting there. Suddenly, in the last 2 minutes of the film, this was no longer the case?

There is every reason Anna and Jacob could have had doubts at this juncture--sometimes the journey takes such a great toll and you are so wearied by the end that you don't know why you ever wanted it in the first place. Other times the desire of what you are wanting is daunted by the reality of it actually being there. It can be scary when it actually becomes real. There was good lead up to this. Had it been supported in the last 10-15 minutes of the film, this could have worked. But NOTHING supported the abruptness of the end given. It was almost like we switched to an alternative reality.

To me, the end knocked this movie down from 8 stars to 2--along with, as other reviewers have said, that the ambiguity around them being married and going to other partners was left out like a dog in the bitter cold and snow. Say what??? And also the shallowness of the character development that never had the two of them talking about WHY they couldn't/wouldn't wait for marriage visa resolution and had to go to others instead. How about some interplay on this screen writers? Or at least a scene where they talk about not being willing to wait. There was NO segue. One scene Jacob is in England and they are married, within the next few minutes they are sleeping with others. With some character interplay we would have some lead up as to why/how they ended up with other partners again. And the marriage question would be answered.

What could have kept LC to an 8 (still not a 10 due to the above) is one of 2 endings, with the first, I think, being the one most true to the prior interactions/leadings of the film: either broaden the emotions/conversations as to why they were feeling disconnected and then have them continue on past where the film ended to again finding their way--as they had every other time. Then have the film end on this happy and plot-fulfilled note. OR. If you need the dark, if that's the only way you can feel you've fulfilled your artistic expression, explore the reasons why this ultimate wish is not fulfilling for your two main characters. Everything in the movie leads up to to them being happy. Over and over again. To do the bait and switch is NOT amazing drama and emotional circumspection, it is, to my mind, as I said earlier, cheap manipulation.

So often, actions are used as an attempt to fill the void of writers' inadequacies. They are so intent on making an impact that they try for what they consider to be ""great drama:"" Wretch the viewers at the end, leave them thinking; Scarlet O'Hara's, ""Tomorrow is another day."" But Scarlet had a whole film to bring her to those words. This film had NOTHING to bring it to the ending it did. Hence, you have unfulfiling drama. Think how powerful the film would have been--with the exact same ending, to say, they realize after all this they do not want to be together after all--if it had only been played out on the screen. That would have REALLY made you think. And be be moved. And you would have been brought there by the movie. THAT is great film making.",1390867200,3,4969,4.549217002237136

Small movements, voice alterations, facial expressions and emotional behaviors are all spot on by the actors and really make the movie feel real. However, I think that the movie is incomplete. The ending of the movie left me feeling robbed. I think that the movie should have had a better and more complete ending. The characters in this movie are excellent and I found myself really feeling the emotions of the characters (not just the main characters), which is always a good thing.

4504940,1,B004Z29XEI,"Possible mild spoilers.

We love a good romance like the next couple, but this was not it. I'd like to think we can also appreciate a good film that has something valuable to say - and for us this wasn't it either. The story follows a young couple who fall in love while in college - he an America, she a Brit - and because they are swept up in their love they decide to have her overstay her visa, which causes all sorts of difficulties down the road.

For a movie to work it, imo, it has to have an internal consistency. This couple is challenged by the distance in their relationship but we very rarely see them calling, texting, chatting, IM'ing, skyping... in other words, communicating with technology despite their distance. As such, this movie would have worked much better if it was set in the early nineties if it was important that they be separated with few options to connect. If they were failing to connect on purpose - this is really never explained well or delved into to that we can understand it more fully.

As a result, their ""struggle"" to maintain their relationship despite the distance always felt half-hearted and perfunctory, though you're led to believe that they can't exist without each other. The ending of the movie may be one of the worst I've seen - and really smacked of an attempt to be artistic for art's sake without being true to the plot. I would say more but it would definitely cross into major spoiler territory, and I'm sure IMDB or WIKI has the gory details if you'd like to know before watching.

We choose romance movies to see hope and love triumph. This movie was as much about love and hope triumphing as The Avengers would have been an example of a great action/adventure movie if Loki would have won. Some people might like that and think it ""deep"" and ""real"" but it wasn't for us. If you take a chance on the movie, we hope you enjoy it!",1390089600,,1889,4.435158501440922

Then, when they return home, they date and sleep with other people. They finally get married and aren't happy, so they sleep with other people.

4505032,3,B004Z29XEI,"Oh, where to start.  At first this movie had a lot of promise...two young adults, Anna and Jacob, who meet in college (while Anna is on a student visa), trying to make a long-distance relationship work.  It's something I could definitely relate to, having done it for three years with my spouse.  But what this movie really failed to depict was two people who really, truly loved each other.

First, the main female character Anna makes a horribly dumb decision by overstaying her student visa because she can't fathom the thought of spending the summer without her boyfriend Jacob.  The cavalier way with which she makes this relatively serious infraction of immigration law is puzzling, but even worse is her expectation that there will not be any consequences.  Nevertheless, after leaving with an expired visa to attend her sister's wedding, she returns to the US and is promptly whisked back to the UK, where the story really begins.

You'd expect that these two youngsters would speak to each other, email each other, Skype each other constantly like most other couples in this situation do.  Instead, the two let their relationship fall by the wayside, having only cursory, curt conversations on the phone, lacking the softness they exhibited when they were physically together.  You see the characters going out to bars with their friends, but mostly forgetting each other.  You'd also expect that Anna would be crestfallen and determined to get back to the US, but instead she gets a job at a magazine and there's barely any talk of returning to the US.  On Jacob's part, he gives no serious consideration to possibly moving to the UK, even if temporarily.

Both Anna and Jacob find new relationships while ostensibly being involved with each other, and it seems plainly unfair to their respective partners that both Anna and Jacob are clearly preoccupied by whatever sentimentality remains between them.  However, this also brings up the point of the best part of this film, which is clearly Jennifer Lawrence as Sam.  Of all the three couple permutations depicted in this film (Anna and Jacob, Anna and Simon, Jacob and Sam), Yelchin's Jacob and Sam's Lawrence have the most convincing chemistry.  The scene where Sam makes breakfast in bed for Jacob is heartwarming, and probably the most authentic few minutes of this film. Perhaps this is because of Lawrence's formidable acting chops, but her playful and assertive, yet forgiving Sam seems a much worthier companion for Jacob than the moody Anna.  Anna's other paramour Simon is an unflinchingly supportive boyfriend, but again, he is relegated to a side prop as Anna's feelings for Jacob consume her.

The situation that Anna and Jacob find themselves in is unfortunate, but the way events play out in this movie, neither of them come off as particularly likeable.  I found myself rooting for Sam more than any of the other characters.",1381017600,3,2901,4.971014492753623

Samantha was crazy to stick around. Then poor Simon proposes... ugh, poor guy. I felt bad for him. He had no idea. I didn't like the fact that they never really talked about what they did when they were apart after the first time (except for that one huge argument,) but I did like how it showed that the people they were with were mere substitutes for who they really loved. But after awhile even that gets troubled by the conflict that comes with being disloyal to the commitment they'd made to each other. So the unfaithfulness part of the story was a bummer, but it was different than is usually portrayed because they each knew about other people, just not the full extent of the other person's involvement. Even though some viewers hated the ending, I found it profound because you could see in their eyes the impact that their straying had on both of them. It didn't leave them unaffected. Sheesh, I'd feel bad too if I knew that I had a fill-in lover for a time when I was apart from my true love. So I liked how the realism was shown - that the thing they wanted most (to be together) was tainted by their straying on both ends. I would have been more upset if they had reunited and been super happy like neither of them had done anything to hurt someone else (and living with someone when you really love someone else is not going to make you happy unless you have no conscience.) They both had broken hearts needlessly by allowing someone to love them that they couldn't truly love back.

This guy can't act and his voice is SO unbelievably annoying.  I kept waiting for Jennifer Lawrence, but she hadn't shown up and just couldn't stand it any more.  Don't bother.  (It's a shame because I really like Felicity Jones and Alex Kingston.)

So, six months later I finished the film.  It turned out to be fairly interesting in the remainder.  I still found Yelchin annoying, but Jones and the remainder of the cast were worth watching.  I always find it refreshing when films don't resort to the clichd, ""happy ever after,"" ending.  This film left me thinking about the relationship that might make it and then might not.

My original rating was one star, but I increased it to three.  (The annoying, whining voice of Anton Yelchin just turns me off.)",1369785600,2,875,4.6103896103896105

The only problem is one lives in England and one lives in New York.  If anyone would like to see how self-involved, arrogant and selfish the younger generation is, I would recommend this movie.  You see, they are both in love, but because their careers are taking off and they are temporarily separated by the English characters screw up regarding her visa, they have to decide which of them is going to sacrifice so that they can be together.  The answer takes an entire hour and a half to figure out.  It is clear that these two are too egotistical and narcissitic to ever experience real love.  The script portarys them as play-acting little brats.  They have no idea what that means.  I would give a marriage between these two about 2-4 years, before they start fooling around with people ""with interests closer to their own,"" or before one of them begins to hate the other for the sacrifices that party made ""for love.""  Hope they don't have any kids.  Without a doubt, these are two of the most repulsive people ever portaryed as star-crossed lovers.  This is low, even for Hollywood.  Why would I want to know what is going on in their heads?  Maybe the director meant this as a horror movie - the attack of the walking dead yuppies.  Nor does the casting add much credibility to the film.  The female lead is reasonably attractive, but the male lead makes quasimodo look like Tom Cruise.  He is disgusting, yet women, including the beautiful Jennifer Lawerence - must have needed the money, hang all over him.  And given his shallow personality, I just can't see the attraction.  The ""aw shucks"" attitude only gets you so far.  I will not give away what happens at the end, but I will say that reflects Hollywood's neanderthal values regarding gender.",1363564800,4,1892,4.624624624624625

For the next two hours you watch two very average young people deal with the most unpleasant aspects of a relationship (jealousy, distance, etc) and attempt to execute the most pitiful coping mechanisms.

All the hallmarks of emotional immaturity and unrealistic romantic expectations are here: reading each others text messages, lying to your partner about previous/current lovers, etc, etc.

The thing is, it's not a bad *movie* per se. It's just an exceedingly unpleasant experience to endure. Why anyone would subject themselves to two hours of this emotionally contrite drivel is beyond me.

4505163,3,B004Z29XEI,"Okay, I admit I ordered up this movie solely to see Jennifer Lawrence in an early minor role. My expectations were low. And when I saw this film the first time, I don't think I would have given it more than two stars. On impulse, I came back to this film recently and gave it a second, more careful viewing. And this time, I liked what I saw. The acting is high quality. The players give us nuances best appreciated in a second viewing. There are many scenes where gestures and expressions speak louder than words. And this is such a believable story. The idea of a college coed screwing up her immigration status is credible, as is Yeltin's ambition to be a furniture designer. Many Hollywood movies can't even film a barroom scene without making it too good to be true. This film's barroom scenes are completely credible. I liked the makeup touches and camera work used to show the characters changing and getting older. Fine attention to story detail.

It all works so well, and yet, the downbeat ending is a complete betrayal of the story arc. In fact, it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment for viewers who have come so far with lovers they've grown attached to. And you talk about needless. The difference between a great ending and the unacceptable one we got is simply how the director had the players portray the film's final thirty seconds. Doremus did this on purpose, and my message to him is that this is deplorable enough to move the film's rating from five stars to three.",1359763200,,1492,4.588014981273409

4505186,5,B004Z29XEI,"I really appreciated the slow tempered manner in which they explore this story of young romantic love. Unlike much of contemporary love stories this film doesn't descend into the physicality of love or love's tensions but takes a page out of traditional or classic romances, focusing on the purity, joy & innocence of first love and how little it takes to ruin that delicate freshness. When the two main characters are tested with a brief separation the lack of patience on the part of one lover, her desire to not let go for even a little while, causes her to jeopardize the relationship all together. The lesson in this romance is that of patience, something most young people lack and a necessary ingredient when protecting the freshness of love's first flush. This isn't a film for everyone, its tender without being too sentimental and its honest and realistic without being cold and crass. The performances by the two main actors are stellar and they uphold the integrity of the script without forcing their performance. I loved this film and would definitely watch it again. If you're looking for a dramatic cookie-cutter hollywood love story or the forced quirkiness in an indie romance then you may not fully appreciate this film .",1358467200,,1240,4.881516587677726

In the beginning, I thought I had made a good choice, that it was a cute love story about a British girl and an American guy. But man this movie went down the toilet real quick. It's one of those movies I wish I could unwatch because it gave me one of those crappy, no good, need to take a shower kind of feelings. I agree with the reviewer that said that ""Love and Selfishness Can Not Coexist"" and that ""Most romantic movies ignore the fact that the feeling that comes with ""falling in love"", is not real love and is always temporary."" I only continued to watch it (when it made a turn for the worse) because I was just hoping the movie would turn itself around and the characters would stop cheating on each other and actually end up at least liking each other again...I was hoping that the rolling credits were just a joke and the real ending would happen eventually...

In this movie it is clear from the tortured existence the characters choose to live, real love is something they have not yet been willing to give, and probably don't even understand.

I watched every smile, kiss, and embrace as if it were my own being replayed. It wasn't the contrived, romantic comedy love. There was spunk and spontaneity to their days, and that is what I remember most about my earlier youth and feeling so in `love'. And even how I feel that now. Not love, but something very slightly reminiscent of it. Driving up to see him and laughing on a bench by the creek. His silly mannerisms paired with genuine descriptions of what he liked about this situation we have going on. Maybe it's the way he always wants to rub my back and make me smile about absolutely ridiculous comments. I don't rightly know. There's peculiar things in this life that I find absolutely beautiful. The temporary imperfections that fit just right in the permanent. The little parts of the sidewalk that aren't quite right and trip you up when you walk. The eyelash on their cheek you can't tell them about because you're not that acquainted, so you let them walk around that way. The tall, dignified trees out in the park that seem to have staying power of a hundred years or more, but have those couples engravings that you are sure were temporary flings. The things that we make happen for a short while and forget about later. You tripped. It blew away. We never went back to that place. It was for a time that it was love, or something like it. And it goes as soon as it comes. You love it like crazy. And then life fast forwardly rewinds and you do it again. You trip. It blows away. And you never go back to that place. You just start over. And it's obviously going to be imperfect, but you find it. And it goes. And it goes and you find yourself going back to saying I love you, like crazy.

The whole story at first sounded interesting, and firmiliar to Titanic in a few ways. Mainly it's the fact that the girl made a sacrafice by violating her Student Visa by staying longer in the country, and basically when she tired to return to the United States she was sent back, and stuck in England.

I'll agree that this is one of the most difficult things to pull off in a movie. However, the rest of the story falls so far from the target that the acting can not save it.

I'll start with the positives here: The acting is realistic. By that I mean it doesn't seem like the actors are acting but rather just carrying themselves as they would through their every day lives. It's a different style of acting that comes off as artificial sometimes, but I'd say a good 90% of the time it worked in this movie to the point where I liked it. The traditional ""perfectly memorized, perfectly recited"" Hollywood style of acting gets kind of tiresome after a while. On the other hand, I felt like this ""natural acting"" was chosen at the sacrifice of some other traditional aspects of movies (including the following: humor, fear, plot development, etc.). This is a VERY dry movie.

Secondly, it's very difficult to relate to the situation as a whole. I've personally lived through having to say goodbye to my fiancee and then waiting several months to see her again, so I understand it's difficult to wait. But this movie doesn't accurately depict the difficulties and agony that accompany the wait. Instead, it does a better job of depicting a very irresponsible couple that simply don't belong together. Any semblance of a plot is destroyed about halfway in when you realize they've already spent more time collectively with their new partners than they had with each other, and that their new partners are fine matches for them. So then why do they pursue the entire immigration and separation angle? Followed up with the fact that there is literally no conclusion to the movie. I really felt like I was watching a watered down cinema version of Teen Mom, with all the frustration and lack of sense that that show presents, but with none of the entertainment value.",1354406400,6,2124,4.706989247311828

4505224,3,B004Z29XEI,"Anna, an attractive British student spending a year in California, meets fellow student Jacob and they fall in love. They seem perfectly suited - but their love undergoes an unexpected test in this fairly dour but tough-minded little flick. Anna can't bear to leave Jacob at the end of the semester and overstays her visas so they can ""spend the summer in bed."" That decision determines their fate.

Anna eventually returns to London but the two pine for each other. When she travels back to California to be reunited, she's stopped at passport control and sent back to London. American bureaucracy, so impersonal, will now prevent her return to the United States.

Anna and Jacob both begin to build careers, he hand-making furniture, she in journalism. They both embark on affairs with others, and yet remain in love. Jacob doesn't seem ready to consider a life in Britain. The only way Anna could gain entry to the United States is by marrying -- so they get married. Surely now, all will end well.

What I liked about this movie was its realism and refusal to give in to the tropes of the romantic comedy or the expectations of the audience to deliver the usual ""life affirming"" happy ending. Yes, love is powerful but it is not all-powerful. What I did not like was the very slow pace, the feeling of dead air that often surrounded the actors and lack of desperation the movie conveys -- as if none of it really mattered much.",1348876800,3,1431,4.648221343873518

When they finally meet up again, her student Visa has expired and she is not allowed in to the United States until she can get her Visa renewed again. Jacob and Anna's relationship is deeply complicated and yet confusing at times. The film jumps around too much and the viewer is left scratching its head in confusion. It's not a perfect movie but I feel like it's accurate of how relationships go through ups and downs, espcially long-distance relationships.

They drag each other and two other people through the dirt, so it's no wonder they both struggle with trust issues the entire movie. The ending leaves you hanging.

4505251,5,B004Z29XEI,"Like Crazy is much better than the average romantic drama drivel that masquerades as a film nowadays. For one thing, the movie is more authentic: the love story isn't completely rosy or cliched, the dialogue is how young people actually talk, and the actors look like regular people, without a professional, stylized look. The two leads have great chemistry, which is a requisite for any good romantic flick. And the acting is superb as well. Felicity Jones, in particular, gives a wonderful performance and could turn into a star someday. But most importantly, Like Crazy succeeds in what it sets out to do. We sympathize with the main characters and feel the ups and downs of their relationship.

4505265,4,B004Z29XEI,"Not knowing what to make of all the conflicting comments about this film, I decided to go buy it on my own instincts, and am glad that I did.
No, it's not a masterpiece, nor, I daresay, it is meant to be.  Instead, it is a small scale work that deals extremely well with the oldest of storylines known to man - that of falling in love.  In this case, the protagonists are two college kids who get to know each other at the moment they are about to study for a career in Los Angeles, which in more ways than one turns out to be a distance much harder to span than its geographical mileage from London would suggest. Long distance love affairs can no doubt be trying in the best of circumstances, but when you add the U.S. Immigration Dept. into the mix you've got one helluva problem.
Still, ""where there's a will there's a way,"" and this film beautifully captures in a completely natural a convincing way the emotional ties between two people that even the U.S. Immigration apparatchiks can't break.  She, Anna, is a Londoner who is obliged by force of circumstances to stay in London once her studies are over, and then make a career, whilst he, Jacob, must do the same in L.A.
This is one of those films where you feel you're watching real life unfolding before your eyes, rather than some highly scripted drama.  I read that some or indeed much of the dialogue was improvised, and if this is the case, it has paid off in spades. Whilst Anton Yelchin does a fine job as Jacob, the star role must belong to Felicity Jones, who manages to employ every nuance that seems to come so naturally to her somewhat ambiguous feelings about her relationship with Jacob.
I thoroughly disagree with the negative comments made about the ending, which is really the perfect and very life like conclusion to what is the running theme that has motivated Anna all along.
An excellent movie which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Thank god I wasn't put off by its detractors. It's also a nice bright and clean blu ray outing with fine sound.",1336867200,3,2014,4.476839237057221

4505268,4,B004Z29XEI,"This is one of  those films that can hit the core of every human soul.  It is a love story of two young college students.  Anna is from England attending college is LA.  Jacob is American, who happens to take classes with her at the same university.  Both are young and emotionally available.  Their attraction is instanteneous and over time they build relationship that is consuming all of their emotional energy.  As any young love, there are no rules for this couple; so when Anna breaks the rule by overstaying in US on her student visa, their relationship comes to a test.  Anna is not allowed to enter US until her transgression is cleared with the US Customs department and Jacob will have to choose if he want to coninue visiting her in London or just forgetting about the whole affair.

What really touched me is the sincerity of the raw emotions these young people show on the screen.  Longing, heartbreak, need to connect and experience love.  The intensity of feelings that exists only in young love is beautifully captured in this film.  If you have seen ""(500) Days of Summer"", this film will fall into same genre.  Story is original and emotionally packed.  The only shortcoming is that on occasion the film sound is not very good.

I found some moments in this movie compelling, but for the most part it was agonizing to watch Anna and Jacob torture each other and their other partners with the ebb and flow of living together and living apart.  Jennifer Lawrence does an admirable job portraying Jacob's other very admirable love interest.  Felicity Jones' Anna seems to take the reins much of the time to keep whatever is left of their relationship from fading into the past.  Anton Yelchin's Jacob is a limp, malleable character who goes with the flow probably more than he should.

SPOILER ALERT  Ultimately the two have legal rights to live together in the US.  When Anna receives the call from her parents' friend Harry (who has toiled for months to get approval for Anna to be able legally be in the US), Anna takes the call with the heaviness and frustration of knowing or at least questioning whether this is what she really wants for her future. Anna leaves a very rewarding career to move to the US and we see her looking up less than ideal jobs on the Internet. Jacob meanwhile gets to move back to his company/living space.  Where is the fairness in this decision?  The abrupt ending was probably realistic and very similar to the ending from ""The Graduate"".  Okay, we are here, we are together, where do we go from here?  Do we even really want to be together anymore?

first to get this out of the way: it irked me to no end that jacob never made the leaps and bounds to make his move to anna. she was the one who had the good job, later a promotion, too. what made it so his business was so established he could not possibly relocate? ah, that felt good to vent.

loved the movie, and its well done job in sculpting this relationship. i personally found this resoundingly true to life. and in my situation, as well, one of us just wasn't as committed to making it work in spite of odds/frailty/distance. but things in life aren't usually so simple. relationships deserve a chance to develop at their own pace. just as a good dish, made with right ingredients, still won't turn out right, if rushed or drawn out. in hindsight, the culmination of things between anna and jacob made total sense, given the foundation of their relationship amounted to mere months of time knowing one another before circumstances turned them into mere visitors in each others' lives. their desire for what was had, blinded them both to the reality that it had passed, and they were clinging to something fraying, not thriving. the fights were becoming petty and harsh. this was a portrayal of first love, a practice, if you will. the sentiment and experiences conveyed genuinely, in their naivety, innocence, and intent.

Unfortunately, the director seems proud of the fact that there wasn't a screenplay, claiming that should be obvious to the viewer.  Unfortunately, it IS obvious to the viewer.  The idea for this movie is an excellent one, but in practice, without the crafting of a clever writer, the acting falls short.  We see Anna, early on, decide to ignore the ending of her student visa.  Without context (and not enough is given), she just seems to be a stupid, foolish girl making a rash decision, even though she seemed to be quite aware beforehand that she needed to return to England once her visa expired.  When the couple is ripped apart, I lacked sympathy for either of them.  Later one, when married, they each find someone new and nearby.  Jacob finds Sam, a girl who works for him and obviously adores him.  Anna finds her neighbor Simon, a dashing but controlling man who loves the woman Anna has turned into while they are dating.

The only redeeming quality I found in this movie was Anna's parents.  Both veteran actors, they played their parts brilliantly.  They were clever, fun, and always watching their daughter attempting to discern where her true happiness could be found.  Unfortunately, Jacob and Anna ruined the movie, and the fault here lies with the director, not directing enough, and not hiring a screenwriter to give these young actors the voices they so desperately needed.

4505296,5,B004Z29XEI,"When `Like Crazy' was making the Sundance circuit and garnering much deserved attention, many were comparing it to 2010's devastating marital dissection piece, `Blue Valentine'.  It was being heralded as this past years answer to the truth about relationships; a relationship life cycle of sorts.  It was, obviously, much tamer (notably edited to achieve a PG-13 rating instead of the R rating it initially snagged) and it constructed its development differently (where `Blue Valentine' siphons the beginning of their relationship alongside the end of their marriage, `Like Crazy' starts at the beginning and follows it through in chronological order), but at the end of the day it has a very similar effect.

This film is so real.

I was expecting, in a way, to see a cheap knockoff of one of the best films in recent memory (`Blue Valentine' has only grown in my esteem as one of the first masterpieces of this current decade) but instead I received a special film; an intimate and unique fascinating look at love and the toll it takes on a person.

`Like Crazy' tells the story of Jacob and Anna.  Jacob is an LA native, while Anna is from Europe and is in the States with a visa in order to attend college.  That is where they meet and that is where they fall in love.  Sadly, in a hasty lovelorn decision, Anna violates her visa in order to spend the summer with Jacob and winds up being refused entry back into the country once she leaves to attend a wedding.  Forced to spend long spans of time apart, their love for one another (which is undeniable) is put to full test as they venture into other relationships while still trying to keep their own.  The film covers the beginning of their love affair and follows it through a few years as they grow apart and then fall madly back in love when in each other's company.

Yelchin and Jones are beautifully in sync throughout the film; building a beautiful repertoire with one another.  It is a stunning chemistry that they have and it allows the viewer to truly invest in the truth of their relationship.  The supporting cast is also good, especially Jennifer Lawrence, who bleeds a natural depletion of love as she pines for Yelchin's affections.

`Like Crazy' is nowhere near as devastating as `Blue Valentine', so don't let the comparisons deter you from giving this a try (I'm telling you MKIA, you'll love this).  Instead, `Like Crazy' sheds a slight ounce of hope that these two star-crossed lovers will rekindle something that seems so lost.  I love the ambiguity of some film endings, and the way that this film closes (the beautiful close ups, the contrasted blue backdrop, the tearful memories, the sudden blackness) is just a monumental emotional achievement.  I still prefer `Blue Valentine', by possible leaps and bounds (that film is a masterpiece) but there is no denying that `Like Crazy' also understands the beauty and the devastation of a relationship.",1334016000,12,2926,4.785288270377734

I always search for the kind of movies that stick with you even weeks after watching it. I think the reason it is so different than any other movie is because it feels so real.

4505329,4,B004Z29XEI,"Writer/Director Drake Doremus (with co-writer Ben York Jones) are young and it shows. The have a refreshing take on the fragile delicacies that surround first love and have presented a story with a solid idea that somehow gradually fizzles as the film turns the corner at the denouement. What begins as a lovely, underplayed examination of how fresh love happens between two young people turns into a somewhat discordant trial of endurance on the part of the couple whose nascent love so beautifully fills the screen at first.

American furniture design student Jacob (Anton Yelchin) and British journalism student Anna (Felicity Jones) fall instantly in love when they meet as students at an L.A. university. More is said with silences and the gradual onset of physical behavior with beautifully captured atmospheres that many extraneous words could clutter. But Anna, being British, must return to England at graduation because her student visa expires.  Anna's parents (Alex Kingston and Oliver Muirhead) visit the couple and are happy with the nascent relationship. But when graduation approaches, Anna decides to stay and violate her student visa rather than returning to England. After a visit home, she is then unable to return to the United States. While fighting customs and immigration battles, Anna and Jacob must decide if their relationship is worth the distance and the hardship.  In the intervening time lapses communication becomes strained, Anna gains a new boyfriend Simon (Charlie Bewley) and Jacob has a live-in flame Samantha (Jennifer Lawrence), but in an attempt to solve immigration problems Jacob flies to England and marries Anna.  From that point the story flounders and the manner in which the tale ends is frustrating not only to the couple but to the audience.

Despite a script that looses its way during what seems to be the nidus of a very charming film, the actors in each of the roles do their best to make it work - and for the most part they succeed. The audience is left wondering just how successful the eventual resolution (or lack thereof) of the relationship will be.  Good idea, needed more time in the oven.

4505330,4,B004Z29XEI,"This movie was a sweet movie about young love. The two main characters are trying to be together while in different countries. I liked it because it was romantic and I feel a lot of couples have to deal with long distance. It shows how the road to true love never runs smooth and the movies very realistic. I felt I could really relate to the characters and feel what they felt. They were real to me, and the story line was real too. One of the things I didn't like about the movie was sometime your were unaware of the amount of time that had elapsed from scene to scene. Overall the movie was cheeky and cute. Now lets discuss the ending. You may have read from other comments the ending was strange, or bad or what not. The honest truth was the ending was exactly what it should be. If you truly understand the movie and understand the message of the movie you'll understand the movie. The movie is about how uncertain love can, but yet how certain people are when they are in love. The end clearly depicts that message.
SPOILER ALERT: Don't continue reading unless you wanna know about the ending.
At the end they're showering together and the main characters each have their own flash backs. This is exactly how the ending should be. The story is about how two people love each other, but can't be together easily because of distance. The ending shows how they've done all these things together despite the ocean between them. It shows that they can conquer anything. They're remembering everything they've done and why they love each other, proving to themselves they made the right choice to work at the relationship.",1331337600,,1624,4.546075085324232

4505334,2,B004Z29XEI,"I'm not going to recap on the movie since it's been done in most of the reviews. The movie had a great soundtrack and really great actors. However, I didn't really care for this movie as much as I hoped I would care. I'm in a long distance relationship with someone in England and was really looking forward to this movie. I felt like I didn't understand or connect with the couple. I actually connected more with her and Simon's relationship due to the fact that he reminded me of my ex. Simon was not as great as people have said. He overdominated the conversation and it was always about him. It was obvious in the parents' reaction that they didn't like him at all whereas they seemed to love Jacob.

I hated how we as viewers missed important conversations. One scene she's being deported, then they are missing phone calls in the next scene, and then he's telling his partner that he's not going to England, because they are just friends. Another missed scene...they get married, they fight about obvious jealously and being insecure and angry, and then they are shacked up with another person in the next scene (with no concept of time, except that she had dated Simon for 6 months). WAIT...WHAT? What they hell just happened? And are they still married?

Also, they didn't seem to like eachother as much when they got together after a long parting. I mean, when my man leaves, I'm not sitting on the otherside of a train smiling at him. I'm holding on to him as much as I can before I have to leave his side. And then, it just ends with them remembering how it used to be that summer (with the exception of Jacob remembering the wedding...I assume). They didn't even seem overly happy to FINALLY be together after all that time.

All in all, I was very disconnected from this movie whereas I shouldn't have been. I just felt like it could have been and wanted to be so much more.",1331078400,6,1887,4.463768115942029
4505335,3,B004Z29XEI,"The feeling that you might get from this film is the same feeling you get when being told a story about people you don't know. You're moderately interested, but really you just don't care. As a viewer, you feel very detached from the action taking place. It's very anti-climactic, which was probably intentional, and it's not necessarily something to dislike in the film. It speaks volumes to have the audience not really care about the main characters of a story, because that's a reality we can all relate to: not really having a vested interested in the lives of people we don't really know. It's not a bad movie, in fact, as far as films go, it's very fresh. It's a nice change of pace from the prevailing current in films today. The film, as a work in and of itself, is good. If you are one who likes film as a medium for literature it's a good one, but it is a lot like listening to someone tell you a story about two people you just don't care about.",1331078400,2,957,4.322222222222222

4505337,3,B004Z29XEI,"Looking for a little romance to fill your Friday night with the significant other? If you don't mind them in the bittersweet variety, Like Crazy may be right up your alley. After two little-seen films, director Drake Doremus achieved some significant buzz for this third feature, which took home the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance in 2011. Based loosely on Doremus's real life experiences, the film stars Anton Yelchin as American college student Jacob and Felicity Jones as Anna, the British exchange student he falls in love with. After a passionate summer together, Anna overstays her student visa but returns to London; when she attempts to return to Jacob, she is denied reentry into the States, and a difficult long-distance relationship ensues. While Like Crazy sports a lot of the elements one would expect to find in a romance, the film succeeds in portraying real characters and genuine emotion, crafting a true, intimate study. It's not your average happy-go-lucky movie, but if you relish the ups and downs of rapturous joy and deeply felt heartache, this could be the movie for you.",1330992000,2,1093,5.010989010989011
4505338,3,B004Z29XEI,"What if the one person you loved more than anyone was no longer allowed in the country? How do you maintain a relationship with limited financial resources and nine time-zones between you?

  Just before graduating from college in Los Angeles, Jacob (played by Anton Yelchin) meets and falls in love with Anna (played by Felicity Jones), an exchange student from London. Her student visa is about to expire, but rather than leave as she is required to, Anna (Jones) elects to spend the summer with Jacob (Yelchin) and returns home only to attend a family function. When she flies back to LA, she is detained at the airport for violating immigration law, sent home, and told she will no longer be allowed to enter the United States at any time for any reason. The couple's relations strain as the longing and obstacles to communication become more and more insurmountable. Over time, Jacob's resolve weakens and he begins a relationship with a co-worker, albeit with Anna's blessing that she later retracts.

  As a small, independent film, it took a great deal of time for Like Crazy to arrive in a local venue and even with less-than-stellar reviews from the majority of critics, I was anxious to see it. I should've been better prepared for the continuous agony and discomfort the story and its characters brought. There are worse films out there, without question.

After a visit to England to see her parents she is denied the chance to
come back to the US. The movie then goes on to show the struggles that
her decision creates for them and how they try and overcome the
hardship. This is at it's core a very real life love story. By that I
mean it's not all sunshine and roses the whole time. This is a
different type of love story in the fact that you are not sure who the
one ""in the right"" is and who the one that ""isn't all in"" is. A rare
love story that makes you mad over and over. For that reason (the
freshness) I liked this. On the other hand this is a very drawn out
movie that is really only good one time. Overall worth a watch for the

The director stated in an interview that he would rehearse with the actors until it was almost there, that way once they started shooting there was room to be better and go further into the action and subtext. It premiered at Sundance 2011 which it strongly deserved. It is definitely a heartfelt and true film. I can't wait to get the DVD and watch it again. Great film.",1325894400,5,675,4.451612903225806

4505344,4,B004Z29XEI,"There have many films over the years about long distance romance including 2010's cute romantic comedy ""Going the Distance.""  In that film it involves one person in New York and the other in L. A.  The characters are put in circumstances that bring a chuckle or two.  That way, the angst of the difficult romance is lessened.  In this film whose title comes from a line ""I love you `like crazy'"" our lovers have more obstacles including distance.  Jacob (Anton Yelchin) is a teaching assistant at a Los Angeles college where Anna (newcomer Felicity Jones) is a student from England.  She has eyes for Jacob and leaves him a rather lengthy note on his car windshield.  We only see glimpses of the note, but Jacob appreciates the effort and the humor of the contents.  They go out and begin dating and eventually fall in love.  During this section of the film we of course get to witness what I refer to as the ""falling in love part"".  That is, running on the beach, eating ice cream, riding bumper cars and so on.  Life is complicated however as Anna has a student visa that will expire so she must return to England for 3 months before returning.  In spite of the potential consequences she decides to stay with Jacob for the summer before returning.  Time quickly passes during this section but upon her return to the U. S. she is denied entry because she had previously overstayed her visa.

Anna and Jacob are deeply in love and we can feel their angst.  We are led to believe that both are in love, but clearly Anna has been bitten much harder.  With time passing before they can reunite, Jacob plays house with an assistant at his business (designing and making custom chairs).  As played by Jennifer Lawrence, Sam has also fallen for Jacob.  She is a minor character in the plot but Lawrence makes her sweet, sincere and not some evil monster.  On the other side of the pond, Anna tries to resolve her visa issue but it will take time even after she and Jacob marry on one of his trips to see her.  After he goes back to his business - for some reason he can't relocate - he goes back to Sam and Anna takes up with a neighbor.  Simon (Charlie Bewley) isn't a bad guy either.  He's thoughtful, handsome and clearly a catch.  Still, Jacob and Anna can't shake each other.  But can it ever be the same?

Aided by a supple soundtrack, this is a wonderfully drawn film flush with beautiful but believable characters.  Even Anna's parents are to die for.  Felicity Jones will be a star soon.  She has a charm and loveliness that is fresh and welcome.  This is an excellent film for those looking for an honest depiction of young romance.

BLU RAY UPDATE (1-7-13) This is the first time I've seen this movie since it was in theaters more than a year ago.  I continue to be amazed at Felicity Jones, who I have seen in subsequent films (""The Tempest"" and ""Albatross"") but nothing better than here.  The chemistry between her and Anton Yelchin as the long distance lovers is what makes this movie special.  Obviously somewhat improvised, especially the physical behavior, you can truly believe this is what falling in love looks and yes, feels like.

Pay attention as well to some really nice supporting performances.  Alex Kingston and Oliver Muirhead as Anna's parents are warm and understanding.  Also, second place lovers played by Jennifer Lawrence and Charlie Bewley have small but effectively emotional roles.  I love the quiet moments, only occasionally filled with the twinkling piano of Dustin O'Halloran.  I also like the way the director Drake Doremus and editor Jonathan Alberts cut the film using unusually sharp transitions to cover long periods of time.  Very effective.

This viewing was on Blu ray and I thought it was just as sharp as the theatrical version.  The film clearly has a smallish budget so some of the camera work is done with hand held HD digital equipment, but I thought the transfer looked clear and colorful.  The film comes with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio and 1080p resolution.  The audio is in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 but isn't a show stopper as this is a dialog driven film.  Still some of the club scenes and those at the beach and at the airport give the surrounds something to do.  I can understand some audiences being a bit bored with the struggles our lovers face, but I still find it romantically authentic in every way.  Extras include the usual commentaries, some cut scenes and some alternate scenes.",1322265600,75,4440,4.6130268199233715

The real life obstacles to love are real, but instead of inspiring us to overcome those obstacles, ""Like Crazy"" sends us away empty handed. We are drawn into a beautiful love, and then tortured into watching a rapid collapse of that love, as if nothing in the world is more flimsy and easily destroyed than the feelings that two people have for one another.
