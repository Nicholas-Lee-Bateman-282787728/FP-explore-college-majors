8081821,5,B000B5Y0DW,"My wife never watched Frasier when it was on TV in regular seasons. She became a fan after watching a few re-runs, and wanted more. This was a Christmas gift, and she has loved it. A dream come true...Frasier without commercial interruption! This was a great buy!",1168819200,,263,4.617021276595745
8081822,5,B000B5Y0DW,The girlfriend and I have gone through every DVD one time and our going back through again.  Some of this is so funny she chokes laughing so hard and I have to stop the show.  I loaned a couple of DVD's to a Seinfeld fan and he now uses his TIVO to record Frasier reruns instead of Seinfeld.  Episode where they buy an old restaurant and then Roz lights the Cherries Jubilee is incredibly funny.  Only complaint is where are seasons 9 and 10 at?,1168300800,,445,4.2
8081823,5,B000B5Y0DW,"The first 5 seasons of Frasier were undoubtedly the best. If I'm not mistaken the show won an Emmy each of those 5 seasons. The last season wasn't too shabby either. I would definitely put Frasier in the same category as my other favorites ""Yes Prime Minister"" & ""Yes Minister"". The dialogues are witty, the timing perfect, and the pomposity displayed by Frasier and Niles hilarious. A must have for those with a feverish hunger for laughter.",1168041600,,442,4.753246753246753
8081824,5,B000B5Y0DW,"Some people are apparently willing to pay extra for any case that the box set comes in. Just like the friends box they are actually selling separately for $25. There is an empty box listed on Amazon for $60+. So it's not laziness, it's something that they are willing to pay for. Let YOU not be so lazy as to give some consideration that some people will pay a premium just for the box. Believe it or not, not everyone thinks just like YOU.",1149984000,6,440,4.25
8081825,5,B000B5Y0DW,"The witty banter, snobbish and sarcastic remarks are just the teaser. This ensemble cast provides an cornicopia of situational humor and intellectual refrences without even an idea of insult to your intelligence. The show could have easily gone to a twentieth season and yet we would still want more. If you are still reading this you are wasting time, go buy every copy you can get your hands on. LTD",1148256000,6,401,4.742857142857143
8081826,1,B000B5Y0DW,"I just bought each season on AMAZON (1-7) separately, ordered at the same time, opted for FREE SHIPPING, and my total was $181.31.  Do the math!  I saved $88.68.  Let's not get too lazy, shall we?",1145750400,34,196,4.388888888888889
8081827,1,B000B5Y0DW,"I am as big a fan of Frasier as one can be - I own all eight seasons (1-7 and final) in dvd. My rating is based on the price associated with this dvd pack - please do the simple math. It is possible to pick up all the seasons of Frasier at Amazon.com for a lot cheaper if you buy them separately. I simply do not understand this extra cost associated with buying the set - are we becoming so lazy that we are willing to pay a premium in excess of US$ 30 to buy the set together instead of going through the trouble(!) to buy them separately? And once again from the same vendor (i.e. Amazon.com).

As for the series it is one of the wittiest shows on TV and is strongly recommended.",1143072000,60,682,4.014705882352941
