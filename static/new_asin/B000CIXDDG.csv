2465342,5,B000CIXDDG,"I purchased this DVD based on other peoples reviews raving about how great it was. So I bought it for $30.00, used. Too bad it won't play on my DVD player. Something about area restrictions. Although, on the DVD, it says, ""All regions."" I strongly say, ""Buyer beware."" I tried it on my Dell computer and it plays. And...yes...it is a great concert! I'll just have to be satisfied to watch it on my computer. Wish I could watch it on my 36"" television instead of my 17"" monitor. Just want to warn people out there.

It was dumb of me to think that I could just order a DVD and that it would have no problem at all. Even though very other DVD that I've ever bought, has played on my DVD player. Not this one. Be smart about this purchase for your sake.",1169942400,16,750,4.172413793103448
2465343,5,B000CIXDDG,Like T. Cordonnier said in his review I too have this in VHS format and have been waiting for years in hopes they would market it in DVD format! These 4 fella's are all legends individually as well as collectively. It is somewhat rare that artists successful in and of themselves can team up together and not only be successful but humble as well. I love The Highwaymen and since the passing of Waylon and John ended any future collaboration it makes everything they have done together that more special!,1152403200,12,504,4.611111111111111
2465344,5,B000CIXDDG,"Written by Stuart Borris - Do not confuse this group with the original Highwaymen folk group, because the 4 guys that make up these Highwaymen are much different than the men who first used the name. These are 4 legends who came together to give real back bone to the name Highwaymen and this tape is a solid introduction to that.  To say this item is great is like saying the Pacific Ocean has a lot of water. If you appreciate the roots of country music, this video is real proof that there was nothing like having Waylon, Johnny, Willie and Kris on stage at the same time working together. In this presentation, you see 4 legends coming together to make a rare combonation. These guys created something so special it can not be matched. The closest thing to them might be the Rat Pack or maybe if BB King, Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Bruce Springsteen and Neil Diamond came together, recorded and performed on stage together. That is a tall tall order but the Highwaymen are all that and have made their mark for many generations to follow. I had the fortune of seeing these guys in person at the Patriot Center Fairfax, Virginia on June 10, 1995. Even though I had always liked Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings, my friend Eric had to talk me into going to this show. It was at a time when I was more into Hootie and the Blowfish and Collective Soul. Even though I wasn't excited when I came in, I came out of that show a real fan of the Highwaymen and an even bigger fan Cash and Jennings. It was my one and only opportunity of seeing them because they never returned to the Washington DC area again. I wish I had known how good they were, for I would have surely seen them multiple times. Even though there will never be another opportunity for me to see them live again as Cash and Jennings have passed away, the footage here makes it possible for me to see them again and again and again and again and again and again and again. The presentation does a near perfect job at showing their legendary presence on stage and incredible musical ability on stage. Along with that, it also provides an inside look at their relationship together through interviews and by the stories they tell. Afterall, not only are they performers, they are also emotional storytellers as well. As a result you will get a real feel of what the Highwaymen were about from this video. As Waylon points out in the video, ""the best part of the Highwaymen tour is the music"", and this video shows us why. As far as the orignal folk group also called the Highwaymen, these 4 legends do not take anything away from their musical accomplishments.",1145750400,20,2622,4.4625
2465345,5,B000CIXDDG,"I had this video in VHS format and I always considered it as my best video ever. I dreamed it would exist in DVD one day and it became now a reality. So I bought it back immediately.the songs are perfect they sing so well, nothing to reject,from the vhs to the dvd I would have expected a better improvement in terms of image but I have no regret still. If you like these artists this is a key document to have at home and you will need to see it many times it's a masterpiece Thank you so much I can keep this fabulous concert in dvd now.

Rush to buy it and you won't regret I can tell you !",1145577600,29,593,3.860655737704918

2465384,1,B000CIXDDG,"READ FINE PRINT BEFORE PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT! I am a huge Highwayman fan and could not wait to get this DVD.  Immediately upon receiving it I put it in the DVD player and saw ""cannot read"".  I logged on to view my original order and realized I had ordered ""Region 2"", this means it will not play in the US!!!  It definately was my fault for not noticing the Region 2 in the first place, but in my defense I was doing some quick shopping and did not even know you could buy something that would not play in the US.  I would think the seller would notice that the product was being shipped to a US address and inform the buyer they are buying a product that most likely won't play on a DVD player sold in the US or Canada.  I guess if I ever visit Japan or Europe I'll have something to listen to.",1346284800,,797,4.050955414012739
2465385,3,B000CIXDDG,"This is one of those great concerts that should have been released on DVD long ago.  I purchased the original on VHS when it was first released and watched it many times.  There are some versions of songs on this recording that are not available anywhere else.  So for a long time I had hoped that this recording would be released on DVD and here it is.  HOWEVER, the quality is very poor for a DVD.  It is even much poorer that the original release on VHS.  It appears that this DVD has been dubbed from an aged copy of the VHS rather than from an original master.  Nevertheless, it is a good concert, and the sound quality is very good.",1344384000,2,638,4.223140495867769
2465386,5,B000CIXDDG,"This is a great video. I wasn't familiar with the highwaymen before but since getting this video I've played it almost every day.
The only bad thing about this video is that it won't play on my boyfriend's DVD player.

2465390,5,B000CIXDDG,"First off, this is a REGION 2 DVD, it says so right on the dang page!
I am utterly AMAZED at so many dummy's who bought this and gripe ""oh it won't play on my DVD player"" then give it a 1 or 2 stars for that! I mean come on! READ first before you buy and secondly, it plays on your COMPUTER! I mean doesnt anyone even try that????
...Now for the show.......I first bought this in 1991 on VHS when it was first released in America. At this time, Cash had not yet become a new icon to the kids, he was a has been, Waylon just had the top 5 hit ""Wrong"" but wasn't included in this set, Willie is always a classic outlaw who's never outdated, then you have Kris. Kris huh....why did thye chose this bum? Sure he wrote great songs and got lucky to star in a few movies, but he's no singer. The trio would have been perfect without him, or maybe throw in Haggard or the like.
 The BAND is very tight, the songs sound GREAT! Great filming, in between songs now and then you get a interview nugget from cash or Waylon talking about a song or the tour. It's a GREAT GEM, nice and long play (90 mins). Even Kris's songs were great, and Im not a fan of him much, his ""Living Legend"" is great but he steals the show believe it or not with his ""Why me Lord"" song and gets a standing ovation and even Waylon says ""I have to follow that?"".  It's a great treasure of music from 3 legends.",1311120000,5,1372,4.0036496350364965
2465391,5,B000CIXDDG,"The information listed for this DVD clearly states that this DVD is in PAL format, meaning it will not play on any NTSC players (hence USA customers are unable to watch it on their DVD players). Unless you buy a region free player, you will have to stick with the original VHS or hunt down the laserdisc to enjoy this magnificent concert.

The DVD I received will not play on any DVD player in my home (tried 3 of them). Very disappointed as this was a surprise gift for my hubby for Father's Day. He was so excited to watch it and I felt awful that it was worthless. Sending it back for a refund. Wish they had one that worked. :-),1308528000,,471,4.075268817204301

We still do not know what type of device we should buy in order to play this CD!!!! We looked everywhere on the package to see what exact device we need in order to play this DVD. All it says is DVD.

2465397,5,B000CIXDDG,"Well it goes without saying that this is the best concert I have ever seen. Growing up on these guys, being able to see them all (separatly unfortunatly) was always worth a million. So I have the VHS for years and years, and a dear friend of mine loved it. SO I told myself when the DVD came out I would definatly get it, and one fine day in ordering other movies there it was. And I bought it. And it does not play! When I looked at the ad it DID NOT have the big red letters saying it would not play here in the states. And my DVD case even says "" ALL REGIONS"" in big bold letters on the back! I am so upset, because my dear friend has my VHS of this and I have a DUD DVD!!!  COME ONE GUYS!!! Waylon, Willie, Johnny, & Kris are the ones who brought us up here in the USA! Their music should be formatted on DVD for everyone around the world, yes, but in the USA we should not have any problem walking into a store and buying it, going on line and ordering it, or whatever fashion of purchase we choose to OWN IT!!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE~~~ I DO NOT WANT TO ORDER ANOTHER USED VHS,,,PUT THIS FANTASTIC CONCERT ON REGION 1 DVD SO MYSELF, AND MOST LIKELY THOUSANDS OF OTHER FANS CAN BUY IT AND ENJOY IT, like I thought I was going to do today. If anyone out there has a solution, PLEASE pass it on!!!",1292716800,11,1298,3.9731800766283527
2465398,5,B000CIXDDG,"When I ordered this DVD I didn't read the listing good enough. The DVD was for region 2 and It wouldn't play on my players,two Panasonic and one Sony. My Panasonic S97 went bad So I ordered a Panasonic S58 and surprise,surprise it plays it fine. Real entertaining concert. They each sing their own hits and a lot of performances are by the whole group together. It brings out the best of all of them. If you order it though make sure of the region. The case states that it will play in all regions but the disc shows region 0. Iv'e read in one article on the internet that Region 0 will play on all players but that is apparently not the case. Another item that may be of interest to some of you that use the componet 480 hookup is a cable going bad. My S97 was using the componet system and I lost the red color in the picture. Even the tail lites on cars were greenish. I tried the disc in my other players and it worked fine so I figured the S97 was going gunnysack. Not so,the red cable of the component cable set went open circuit so the reds didn't get to the TV. I didn't need to replace old 97 after all. Of course I wouldn't have been able to view the Highway men then.

Indeed the outcome of this reunion deserves every superlative. We all know about the Dream Team the U.S. sent to the Olympic games, and won the gold medal in basketball. Well, the Highwaymen is America`s Dream Team in country music.

Since the concert was filmed only in March 1990 the date is wrong (1986).
And it's a PAL ""All regions"" DVD edited 2005 by Sony BMG Music Entertainment (Australia). At least my item with the same cover is. So it should run on DVD players in the US and Canada.
