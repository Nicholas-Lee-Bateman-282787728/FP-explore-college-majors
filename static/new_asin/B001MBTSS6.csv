3695296,3,B001MBTSS6,"I loved the old man, Arthur, and his duckling, Joe. Good acting and dialogue for Philip Baker Hall (Arthur) with some lovely dry humor. A moving portrayal of one man's decline into homelessness, and the importance of purpose. Caring for an orphaned duckling makes a new man of old Arthur, a retired history teacher and war veteran. But Los Angeles is hard on homeless Arthur and his duck, where the last public park has been closed, leaving only a polluted desert landscape.

This movie clearly makes a social/political statement, and it made me want to reach out and help.  Arthur and Joe are the victims of various broken programs: senior citizen support, welfare, social security, veteran's benefits, LA Unified Schools, Parks and Recreation, waste management, EPA/environmental care, etc. Joe blames these flawed systems on Republicans first, but also on apathetic Democrats.  While I concur with the messages, I found them overdone. I'm not a fan of the sledgehammer approach. Nearly every character Arthur meets is insensitive, ignorant, thoughtless, and very rude: the landlord, the landfill crew, the psychiatrists, the bus driver, the park rangers, etc. However, a few kind souls make a big difference. And that's another message.

The movie movingly portrays the terrible conditions facing America's elderly citizens. And of course, who doesn't love ducklings?

This tale reminded me a little of the book THE PENGUIN LESSONS by Tom Michell. It also brought to mind the Swedish movie The 100-YEAR-OLD MAN WHO CLIMBED OUT THE WINDOW AND DISAPPEARED.",1470009600,,1557,5.236947791164659

3695325,4,B001MBTSS6,"I've read the other reviews posted previous to this one I'm writing.  It has been interesting, reading what people think of this movie.  The story would probably come across better in written form.  Reminds me of literature I had to read in university.  Existentialist stuff.

Here are my thoughts:

Having been a displaced person at various times in my life, I still find comfort in remembering the odd person here & there who treated me as if I mattered.  The child, elderly person, the clerk, the night nurse - - helped me through.  And, maybe I helped them.  So, don't take this movie too seriously - - reflect on the love between the man & the duck.  Reflect on how our society in the US has not actually come to this - - the reality of the movie.  There is still hope & help.

The music & lyrics, especially the lyrics - - meant a lot to me, & added to the narrative.  The hope.",1440979200,,884,4.284848484848485
3695326,1,B001MBTSS6,"A homeless man and his duck that follows him around L.A. I honestly don't know what the point of this was, but I can definitely state that it was far too long.",1413763200,,159,4.0
3695327,4,B001MBTSS6,"Duck is a sensitive little film telling the story of an elderly man, all alone in the world after his wife and son have died, must find a way to live his life with a sense of meaning and drive while taking care of a duck who has mistaken him for its mother. The film shows us well how the old man cares for the duck and the impact the duck has on his life, too. The cinematography is very good and the acting was rather convincing.  I also liked the musical score. It could have been edited a little to make the action faster and the plot a bit tighter; but on the whole it's a rather good film.

When the film starts, we learn that Arthur Pratt (Philip Baker Hall) has lost his son Daniel and his wife Frances (Carol Mansell) and that he is all alone in the world. Sadly, he buries his late wife's ashes with a small tree in one of the few beautiful parks left in his neighborhood in or near Los Angeles. It isn't long, however, that a duckling approaches Arthur and we see that even in his despair Arthur is willing to take care of the duck that he names Joe.

However, the real story--and it's quite a journey--begins when Arthur is evicted from his apartment by his landlord--who happens to be the son of old family friends (Larry Cedar as Mr. Janney). Arthur almost loses Joe but finds him just in time; and Arthur, with Joe, wanders all over Los Angeles slowly but surely making his way to the beach where Arthur hopes to find some inner peace and quiet. Along the way Arthur and his duck have a few adventures most of which show how cruel others can be toward the elderly and animals; but Arthur does have positive experiences with a social worker (Starletta DuPois) and a pedicurist (Amy Hill). Look also for Bill Brochtrup to do a great job of playing a homeless man named Leopold and Bill Cobbs is wonderful as Norman, a blind man who also wants to go to the seashore with his assistance dog Tessa.

The DVD comes with a few extras including an optional running commentary.

Duck is a solid indie film that shows how an animal enables an old man to have a renewed sense of purpose in this world; and that's grand. I recommend this film for people who like independent dramas and fans of the actors would do well to add this to their collections.",1310428800,,2255,4.2964705882352945
3695328,5,B001MBTSS6,I ordered it for a friend she loved it...I love amazon they make it so easy for me to shop for her..............joe,1301702400,,115,4.2727272727272725
3695329,5,B001MBTSS6,"This movie made me cry, and I haven't seen a movie that's been able to do that in a long, long, time.  It's a very sad story, made even sadder because, with just a little kindness and help, Arthur's and Joe's lives could have been so much less tragic.

Set in a not so distant future (actually the past, now)where Jeb Bush is president and there is no Social Security, no social services, no safety net at all for the old and sick, ""Duck"" tells the story of a man on the brink of suicide because he has nothing left to live for.  Until a little duck finds him and gives him that reason.

But don't think this is a soppy, life-affirming, happy ending movie.  It's not.  It's grim, sad, and depressing.  Very dark.  It will make you feel sad.  Watch it next time you think about voting for any bills that cut social services, poor as they are.",1267833600,,841,4.238993710691824
3695330,5,B001MBTSS6,"This movie shows how an unexpected turn of events can change a person's life, and how that person can go on to help others. Dealing with grief and the loss of loved ones, an older gentleman is ""adopted"" by a duckling, and goes on to raise and care for the duck, though homeless. He travels across country, helping others along the way. The bond between the old man and his duck is truly heartwarming.",1242691200,,400,4.418918918918919
3695331,5,B001MBTSS6,"Duck is a story of the strength of love. A force that takes you out of the confusing labyrinth of  personal sadness and leads you to see other beings in need of love and care.
Each encounter that Arthur has is an inspiring story, a story that dwells on different aspects of a human being: their love, care, greed, despair, anger, loneliness, sadness and so on.

The bonding between a left alone duck and a man who has lost everything that he cherished is  an opening to a world beyond ""standards"" and mundane values.

You feel an immense sadness through the whole movie but you also feel how love keeps you going, how caring for another widens your horizon.

Duck is not a movie for mere entertainment, killing time or forgetting. It is a movie about how cruel and beautiful life can be/is. It is like a sad beautiful piece of music that brings you to feeling alive and appreciating the gift of love.",1238976000,,900,4.463414634146342
3695332,5,B001MBTSS6,"As our family of ducks; one on the floor in front of the TV; one in my lap; and one under the coffee table next to my mama Helen's feet watched our life spread accross the screen.  We had no idea what ""Duck"" was about.

We wanted to see a light fun duck movie because mama Helen was just diagnosed with cancer.  We got something far more healing and shockingly close to home.  The film touched on a deepest fear; homelessness and loneliness.  Helen and I are all we seem to have.  When things seemed their worst I almost shut the movie off...and then came this little duckling to the rescue like a little angel.

This movie had potential to be made undbelievably corny.  Thank you and Phillip Baker Hall for taking this seriously!!!  Thank you for making a movie that shows how our animals care for us.  Thank you for not ""going for the funny or getting morbidly depressing.""  Thank  you for showing it from our perspective; excentric and bright are always judged crazy...  ""Why do you have a duck?""  ....This movie answered, ""Why not?""...and ""Why do you need to know?"" ...The scene that is depicted with the photo on the cover threw out another question about why owners always end up looking like their animal companions.

I also LOVED the symbolism of feet in the movie...protecting them...being the conection between mind, body, and soul.

I love how this showed the perspective of the outsider looking into human society.  It is the top 10% of us who look out beyond the box...philosophical types who have a hard time finding someone to talk to.  Here these so called pragmatic ""normal"" people show how nuts they really are.  Phillip Baker Hall is now on my list of great all time actors.  Sometimes we seem a little different, but we are really all the same.",1229731200,,1764,4.575079872204473
3695333,3,B001MBTSS6,"I'm referring to both the duck (who really makes out rather well since his owner goes to such length to care for him) AND the old gentleman who was left bereaved and bereft.

I can see where folks think the film is uplifting, but I found it quite depressing, and, unfortunately, all too accurate.  There are plenty of homeless people who will relate to the circumstances which resulted in both 'animals' being left to the 'mercy' of the wide world.  And there are plenty of predator animals in the landfill they found themselves in.  Not in a beautiful garden, or even in an area where social services can help the destitute, but they have to survive under the grimmest conditions.

Yet the human animal (great acting and good scripting, by the way) cares for the non-human animal with great loyalty and optimism.  The former would have made a wonderful, indulgent grandfather if life had been kinder and had kept his beloved wife and son alive. Its a sad film, but very worthwhile viewing.

And next time we are sitting in our car reading a hand-drawn begging sign from a homeless person on the center island of the roadway, give them a smile and a buck, will you?",1221609600,,1165,4.599033816425121
3695334,3,B001MBTSS6,The duck stole the show in this movie - as was to be expected.  A great movie for any duck or animal lover.  I enjoyed it.  Always a pleasure to see Bill Cobbs and Philip Baker Hall was great.  Recommend it ! 'Think outside the flock.',1220054400,,235,4.043478260869565
3695335,5,B001MBTSS6,The movie Duck was a wonderful inspirational movie to watch.  I watched it twice over a weekend.  It was a touching heartfelt story about an older gentleman and a duck who gave him a whole new perspective on living in the moment of life.  The movie was about a person who went with the flow of life and was very good at relating with others.  It was impressive how the man and the duck dealt with the hard knocks of life without being a complainer or victim.  It was a touching uplifting story.,1219104000,,494,4.268817204301075
3695336,4,B001MBTSS6,"DUCK is a really bittersweet movie.  I bought it after seeing the trailer and because my family and I own two white Peking ducks whom we rescued as ducklings.  The movie does a great job at portraying just how much personality ducks have and how they can be great lovable companions when exposed to humans early on.

The story about poor Arthur is heart-breaking and is the reason I gave this movie a 4.  I cried through half the movie, partly because it reminded me of my own ducks but mostly because more bad than good happened to Arthur and his duck, Joe.  I wish there would have been some happier moments in the movie so I wasn't crying the whole time (although there were several lighthearted moments during certain conversations Arthur had with Joe or when Joe would do something cute).  It is a fairly depressing movie, although there is a decent happy ending (it could have been happier, but it seems to be enough for Arthur and Joe).  I do still wish more good things happened to Arthur because it was sad to see him trying to keep himself and Joe going while others made it even more difficult for him and at times were downright cruel.

If you are an animal lover or want to see a rare type of storyline, watch this movie.  You will see how animals - in this case ducks - can bring a lot of joy and love to the lives of humans and get a glimpse into how ducks who are attached to humans can be.  But, be prepared with tissues!",1218412800,,1438,4.292592592592593
8320823,5,B001MBTSS6,"This is not a movie for StarWar FX junkies.  If you're looking for explosions, car chases, CGI, gore, nudity, or belly laughs, this is not your kind of film.  It will bore those with attention deficit disorders.

That said, this is one of my favorite indy films.  It's a tale about two lost souls finding each other at a critical junction and developing a lasting bond, even if they're not of the same species.  The humor is wry and low key, the characters are a tad unusual and true to life, the plot is about the erratic daily life of the elderly homeless in LA without resorting to shallowness.

The chemistry between man and duck is unlike anything I have seen in all my years; ranking with the greats like Al Pacino, Audrey Hepburn, and Meryl Streep. Perfect for date night, a family get together, or alone in your room with snacks. The heart wrenching misunderstanding on part of Duck is one we can all relate to; thinking someone of another species is indeed your own kin. The loneliness and desperation on part of Man tugs on strings that I did not know were on my cold, black heart. I am trying my best to accurately put into rhetoric the feeling that this piece of cinema evokes in ones conscious and subconscious mind. Subliminal messages are throughout, and leave the viewer with a slight twang of nausea but also pure elatedness. One could argue that the last few moments of this motion picture are the most impactful, when the last lingering glances between Duck and Man are shared with the upmost of emotion.
Watch this movie. If not for you, do so for your children, your grandchildren, your great grandchildren to know the tale of Man and Duck. It is unparalleled in every element.
Thank you for your time.

The beginning was SUPER slow but I stayed with it hoping it would get better ....However about half-way through the movie I had to shut it down.  The movie is slow, depressing, and very unrealistic. Don't waist your time, there are so many other movies to choose from.",1500595200,,305,4.527272727272727

8320831,5,B001MBTSS6,"I like ducks, rescue them and advocate for all waterfowl (and other wildlife), so I admit upfront that I will be favorably predisposed to any benevolent animal movie, (especially birds) just on principle.  In this case, a fellow waterfowl rehabber recommended it.  It is an indie film, so expect an unorthodox story, treatment and unknown actors, and don't compare it to mainstream movies.  Taken for what it is, it is a sad/sweet, simple, charming ultimately hopeful story that sheds light on the people in our society who don't fit into neat categories and who often fall through the cracks, in this case, a disenfranchised yet resourceful senior who has no place to live and a duck he rescued for a companion.  The characters he meets along the way - some nice, some not so nice - add to the story.  If we are honest with ourselves, indie films probably reflect more on real life than big studio movies.  You will need a mind and a heart to appreciate this film, and the soul to read between the lines.  I liked it very much.",1494374400,,1028,4.584699453551913
