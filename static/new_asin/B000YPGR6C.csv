I'm getting a few more for friends and the family for Christmas. Thank you Mr. England.",1291939200,2,272,4.571428571428571
8233648,5,B000YPGR6C,I just want to say that maybe Jon is saying to us who loved listening to Liberace to not forget him.  Let Liberace style music live on.  If Liberace inspired Jon then that is all for the better.  I love listening to this music.  I am even going to purchase some other Liberace cd's soon.  I will also purchase a cd of Jon England playing piano and maybe a dvd or vhs tape.,1272931200,2,372,4.041095890410959
8233649,5,B000YPGR6C,"It has been said immitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but I think what we have with Jon England is a cut above immitation. Jon is in no way a copy of anyone. I feel Jon pays homage to Liberace with a deep respect. If Jon is not a top seller that is only a reflection on our age. What passes for music today with the popular guitar hero crowd is more abusive noise that withers the soul.
Thanks to Jon the tradition of beautiful piano music with class and sentimentaity did not die with Liberace. I'd gladly wear an ""Old fashioned"" label as I would a purple heart.
I appreciate that Jon does not sell out to sell. It is a rare gift to know what one's true gift is- and to share that without throwing in any substitutions.
Jon England is a vote that beautiful music is...to be continued.

PS. Even my 19 year old son liked this music.",1260835200,2,855,4.2073170731707314
8233650,1,B000YPGR6C,"Jon England obviously is trying to imitate the late American showman Liberace's style of playing the piano.  And it just doesn't work.  Yes, the piano playing is ""beautiful"" but after about two minutes worth, you are wondering if the elevator doors will ever open because this is the kind of gooey, saccharine music that is played in elevators.  The spinning chandeliers above, next to, and around the piano are an obvious (and weird) imitation of Liberace's famous soliltary candelabra.  When this guy gets to Vegas like Liberace did and is making a million dollars a week like Liberace did and has a million fans like Liberace did, maybe I'll re-consider.  Until then, let Liberace rest in peace!

P.S.  Even my 73-year old grandmother didn't like this DVD!",1205539200,2,759,4.929133858267717
