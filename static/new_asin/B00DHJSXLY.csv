5807294,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Sometimes a film will surprise you by just how unexpectedly good it is.  Directed by Stephen Frears (The Queen, Liam, My Beautiful Launderette), with a screenplay by Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope based on the book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee by Martin Sixsmith, Philomena is one of those films. An extraordinary story about a woman's real-life search for the child she was compelled to give up for adoption fifty years earlier, it's also a marvelous character study of two highly mismatched people brought together by chance to solve a mystery with both knowing that the odds are very much against them. And even though this sort of story has been done many times before, Philomena not only manages to avoid cliche, it takes surprising twists and turns along the way showing that real life can indeed trump the best that fiction has to offer. It engages you from the very beginning, draws you further in with each scene until you are so deeply invested in the characters and their quest that everything that unfolds on the screen matters to you.

The plot begins with Philomena Lee (marvelously played by Judi Dench) , a retired Irish woman living in England with her grown daughter, staring at a small old photograph of a little boy about 3 years old. When her daughter, Jane (Anna Maxwell Martin), asks, Philomena reveals a secret she's kept all her adult life - that when she was a young girl in Ireland she had a son out of wedlock that she was forced, very much against her will, to give up for adoption. The details of her story are revealed in flashbacks in which we see young Philomena (a compelling performance by Sophie Kennedy Clark) held in one of Ireland's now infamous Magdalene Asylums, institutions run by various orders of nuns where many young Irish girls of the time were sent for getting pregnant (as well as any number of other ""improprieties"" such as engaging in prostitution, being promiscuous or sometimes just for flirting), becoming virtual prisoners - and slave labor - beyond the reach of the secular law and with no hope of appeal.  She has been haunted by this her entire life, always wondering what became of her little boy, and finding her every attempt to find out thwarted by the implacable bureaucracy of the Irish church.

At the same time, Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan in a deft counterpart to Dench), a former adviser to the current Labour government at the time, has just lost his job due to a minor scandal due to something he said. Given the sack in his mid-fifties, Martin is at loose ends, unsure of what to do with himself, vacillating between taking up running or pursuing a vaguely-formed notion of writing a book on Russian history.  Prior to working in government though, Martin was a journalist of sorts, and while at a party an editor friend of his suggest that perhaps he should try his hand at doing a ""human interest"" story.  Jane, who happened to be at the party, overhears this and approaches Martin with the story of her mother's dilemma over her lost son, thinking that perhaps he can help.  Martin, who had openly said he wasn't interested in doing human interest story as he considered them nothing but fluff, brushes her off. But later, when pondering his options, he finds himself drawn back to Jane's idea. He gets her name and number from another friend and calls her to set up a meeting with Philomena, and soon they're off, going first to the convent in Ireland, where Martin learns firsthand just what Philomena has been up against.

I can't speak of what subsequently unfolds plot-wise without spoiling the revelations and discoveries that are made, but a lot of what makes the film so enjoyable is simply watching Dench and Coogan's mismatched characters interact with each other. Where Martin is world-weary, a bit cynical and of a suspicious nature, Philomena is trusting, irrepressibly chatty, and finds delight in the simplest things, all of which tends to drive Martin up the wall. But in spite of the first impression that we first get of her, as the film progresses Philomena reveals that she's far from naive about life, having moments where she shows a remarkably clear-eyed view of the world (particularly when it comes to sex). It's simply that she refuses to let the bad things that have happened to her color her view of everything else in life. But this attitude, while in some ways admirable, is not very helpful when one is up against forces that are deliberately trying to prevent people from digging up the past, and this is where Martin's suspicious nature proves its worth as he begins to examine the stories they're being told and openly question their veracity, a thing Philomena by nature is not capable of. But what truly works more than anything else is the way Dench's Philomena is delightfully funny even though she's not trying to be, completely oblivious to the way she's coming across to Martin, while Coogan's Martin is hopelessly inept at being funny, most especially when he's trying to be, one of those unfortunate individuals who cannot tell a joke to save their life. It's a comic chemistry of a very human kind, made completely natural by two superb actors at the top of their form.

Also worth mentioning is the beautiful film score by Alexandre Desplat that heightens the mood without intruding on or distracting from the events on screen, and the cinematography by Robbie Ryan that really captures the intimacy of the story and the characters involved.

On a side note, it helps if you can find Peter Mullan's 2002 film The Magdalene Sisters, which is all about the Magdalene Asylums and their decades-long horrendous abuses of vulnerable young Irish women, most notably forcibly taking their children away from them and compelling the women to work in the institution's laundries which the nuns operated as a commercial enterprise, reaping the profits while the women working in them got nothing. The parts of Philomena that only touch on those abuses fall into greater context if you've seen the earlier film.

Highly, highly recommended as an engaging film on every level, a very human story worth hearing, and for the wonderfully mismatched chemistry between Dench and Coogan's characters.",1385942400,385,6203,4.820488721804511
5807295,4,B00DHJSXLY,"""Philomena"" (2013 release from the UK; 95 min.) brings the story (""inspired by true events"", we are reminded at the beginning) of Martin Sixsmith (played by Steve Coogan) and Philomena Lee(played by Judi Dench). As the movie opens, we learn that journalist Sixsmith just lost his job (Sixsmith: 'I'm depressed because I just go the sack'; his doctor: 'But it wasn't your fault'. Sixsmith: ""that's why I'm depressed!"") and is now contemplating writing a book about Russian history. Meanwhile, through flashbacks we learn that in the early 1950s Philomena became pregnant at a young age. Her parents gave her into care of the nuns at Roscrea Abbey in Ireland, where eventually her young son was given up/sold to an American couple. Philomena has been wanting to find her son ever since. Philomena's daughter convinces Sixsmith to take on this ""human interest story"", and off go Sixsmith and Philomena looking for her son. To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: Steve Coogan pretty much took on this project, and in addition to starring, he also co-wrote the script and produced the movie. I very much enjoyed his restrained performance. Even better is Judi Dench, now in het mid-to-late 70s yet seemingly better than ever. While the movie is ostensibly about Philomena looking for her son, the movie is actually much more about the at first awkward relationship between Philomena and Sixsmith, and the ""fish out of water"" experiences when Philomena gets to the US. The chemistry between Dench and Coogan is palpable, and it truly carries the movie (Philomena: 'do you want a N-Tune?', to which Sixsmith responds: 'if I hum it, will you play it?', ha!). But the last 15-20 min., when all is revealed, of course will tuck at your heart, so bring a Kleenex or two. Make sure to stay when the credits start rolling, as not only do we learn what became of Philomena and Sixsmith, but we also get to see real-life pictures of them.

I had seen the trailer of this a few times in recent weeks and couldn't wait to see it. The movie finally opened this weekend here in Cincinnati, and the Sunday matinee screening I saw this at was quite packed, and not surprisingly heavily leaning towards seniors. The crowd laughed and hollered at all the right times, and ate up this movie. Bottom line: while perhaps not the great, serious movie that one might have expected, ""Philomena"" is a moving 'human interest story' nevertheless, and worthwhile checking out, be it In the theatre or on DVD/Blue-ray.",1385856000,110,2578,4.830316742081448
5807296,5,B00DHJSXLY,"I have just seen in a local theatre the film ""Philomena."" I hardly know how to describe it. I went because I have never seen Judi Dench in a bad movie and because of the recent trailer I saw.  And another reason: a friend of mine, adopted as an infant, now at 70 has learned that she has a brother and sister and has made contact with them and has gleaned precious information about her birth mother who died several years ago. I do not believe  I have ever seen another human happier than she is right now.

I cannot remember when I have found a movie so powerful and disturbing. I recently heard Scott Simon on NPR use a phrase about an interview on ""Story Corps"" that describes perfectly my reaction: ""it peels away the heart."" Based on the book by Martin Sixsmith and directed by Stephen Frears (""The Queen""), ""Philomena"" relates the story of a young pregnant Irish girl who gave up a child for adoption and for 50 long years  wanted to find him. This is all I knew from the trailer and if any reviewer is intent on telling someone planning to see the film much else, I would advise you  not to read that review.

I was devastated by the film. Two times during this hour and a half film that seems much shorter I screamed out at the film, a first for me. (I apologized to the woman seated two seats from me when the credits went up.) I cannot imagine that the movie will not reduce you to tears. I left the theatre angry and sad-- I vote for the journalist Mr. Sixsmith's (Steve Coogan) reaction to the events that take place rather than  Philomena's for whatever it's worth. Philomena Lee is a much better human being than I; she is right of course when she says that hate destroys the hater. I have just read via the internet her thoughtful, beautiful response in writing to a review by Kyle Smith in the NEW YORK POST in which he said that the movie is ""a sucker punch"" and that it attacks both the Catholic Church and Republicans. Ms. Lee is obviously a woman with class. Part of her gentle letter to Mr. Smith reads as follows: ""Stephen's movie is not an attack. . . It is a testament to the undying bond that exists between mothers and their children."" To that I say, say amen, somebody. Smith's review might be the nastiest I have ever read. And he totally ignores the scenes from near the end of the film when nuns-- and the last time I checked they were Catholic-- had a chance to do a kind and human, surely Christ-like deed and chose not to.

While the writer and director take some liberties with the facts-- for example, Ms. Lee who worked for 30 years as a nurse in real life, is portrayed in the movie as sometimes a bit silly, reading romance novels and being too complimentary to the personnel in restaurants, Mr. Frears' depiction of how the Catholic Church treated both Philomena Lee and her son is completely accurate.  My reaction upon seeing the film, as a friend of mine recently opined concerning  its massive cover-up of pedophile priests, the Catholic Church has much to answer for. The question to ask, it seems to me, is whether or not what Mr. Frears through the movie says about the Catholic Church or the Republican Party is biased or untrue. After all, isn't the truth supposed to set us all free?

Ms. Lee's story ultimately is about love-- the best kind-- and forgiveness which her letter indicates.  Surely Ms. Dench will win awards for her performance in this unforgettable movie.

Addendum: For anyone interested in knowing more about this remarkable woman, Philomena Lee was interviewed for an article that appeared in the NEW YORK TIMES on November 30, 2013.",1385856000,14,3601,4.462709284627093
5807297,5,B00DHJSXLY,Just saw this film. It is the best movie I've seen in a couple years. Judi Dench is incredible as always.,1385856000,12,105,4.0476190476190474
5807298,5,B00DHJSXLY,"You may ask what is Judi Dench up to this time? I wonder if this wonderful actress ever dreamed her career would continue to soar into her golden years. I hasten to add that everything you have heard in praise of this film is richly deserved. This is a road picture without the outrageous calamities that usually beset players in this genre; it is a gentle comedy without demeaning any of the characters; and it is also a very effective drama about a young mother and her long-lost child.

This PG-13, pleasantly scripted dramedy was co-written by Jeff Coke (Lots of TV) and Mr. Coogan himself, based on the book ""The Lost Child of Philomena Lee"" by Martin Sixsmith. You will see no sweaty bodies (except when Philomena gives birth), hear no gunshots, and see no vehicular mayhem. What a relief!

We have:
  * Judi Dench (""Skyfall"") is Philomena Lee. Many decades ago, as a pregnant teenager abolished to a convent, she was forced to give up her out-of-wedlock boy as penance. She has searched for him for a long, long time. This woman is not worldly, but she IS wise...
  * Steve Coogan (""What Maisie Knew"") is Martin Sixsmith, a jaded journalist who suffers from a mild case of depression; he did after all, just lose his job. When he is first approached about this story, his reaction is strictly negative. ""Human Interest Stories"" are NOT his cup of tea! This may be the first time I've found this actor appealing.
  * Anna Maxwell Martin (""North and South"") is Jane, Philomena's daughter who is convinced her mother deserves to know what happened to her little boy after he was taken from her. Jane is the one who approaches the journalist...

The facts, as they are uncovered, are NOT kind to the Catholic Church, nor to the people who administer the penances for their parishioners. In recent years, much has been disclosed about the treatment of young girls and orphans in Ireland, courtesy of the Church, so there is no big surprise here. This simply puts a face on one of its victims.

The home movies that appear throughout seem so authentic, it's hard to know if they are real or not. I can't find anything that tells me, so I think this is simply an extremely sophisticated blend of fact and fiction. Kudos to the artists who put this together! You may be sure I will pre-order my DVD from Amazon.",1385769600,130,2310,4.584951456310679

5807377,3,B00DHJSXLY,"I guess I'm kind of middle of the road on this one.  I read quite a few of the reviews trying to sort out my feelings about this movie.  For me it kind of fell flat, and I finished it reluctantly just wanting to see the resolution.  The acting was very good for the most part, although not Judi Dench's best effort; she kind of waltzed through the whole thing IMO and at time seemed to force bad dialog.  I had not read the book so had no preconceived notions.  However, reading through a lot of reviews, evidently the book was  mostly about the child's life in the US.  If that is the case, the move certainly did add scenes and pushed personal agendas.  I did think it was a little heavy handed regarding politics and homosexuality, but it was what it was.  I would not recommend it; there are so many better movies out there worth your time and money.
I DID, however, very much like the scene where Philomena forgave the Sister.  What a hard thing to do, perhaps the hardest thing ever in such a circumstance. Too many people carry hate and grudges through life.  I hope that that part was true.",1508457600,,1098,4.307317073170732

5807416,3,B00DHJSXLY,"The film was recommended by a friend.
First:  I love both of the lead actors in the film (Steve Coogan in Alan Partridge and Judi Dench in As Time Goes By and EVERYTHING ELSE!) They are both very good in the movie. When I saw the trailer and I thought it was a comedy. I had comedic moments but it was a bit depressing.
Second:  EVIL NUNS! WHY? Just pure evil. Except for the black nun who opened the door to them. She was the nicest gun. And the one who gave her the photo. She was nice, too. ALL THE OTHERS. EVIL.
Third: O my gosh, girls who got pregnant who were being cared for (with their children) had to WORK to pay for their room and board? The humanity!
Fourth: Is Selling babies and adoption fees the same thing?
Fifth: Seriously. She BELIEVED toddler Anthony/Michael was gay? (SMH)
Sixth: Exactly WHY didn't the nuns help Anthony/Michael + Philomena find each other? That was never fully explained. Even if OLD LADY nun didn't want to help them, there were tons of other people there who could have helped. People who seemingly didn't have a clue about whatever shady dealings were going on. Were all the ""wrinklies"" in on it? Or all the Nuns? Or the entire church?
Seventh:  Stephen Coogan's character was a jerk for most of the movie and though he can be funny, I almost stopped the movie because he was such a jerk.
Eighth:  I think a point of what the nun said that she was chaste even to old age -  Was the position of the church at the time that ALL sex was bad.(Not a Catholic, but is sex within marriage bad in the Catholic theology?)  I'm sure if Phil had been married  (the baby's daddy, as they now say, had apparently abandoned his pregnant girlfriend) would it have been an issue?
Lastly, I LOVE that Philomena FORGAVE the evil nun in the end. And she got the closure of knowing that her son was ""home"" Maybe that's the point of the film.",1497916800,,1862,4.318051575931232

5807531,5,B00DHJSXLY,"This movie deserves Oscar all star winner. It was just nominated 4 awards.
 Philomena(Judi Dench) is the name of the English woman who was grown in a convent by nuns.
 When she was 16, she got pregnant and the nuns treated her as a sinner, took away her child, sold him to America.
 After 50 years, she is desperate to find her adopted son and her daugher meets this journalist (Steve Googan) who usually writes other matters rather than human stories but finally decides to help her finding her son/ write a story about what happened back then.
 There are severel or many of the same or similar stories already made from Europe but none of them touched me this deep.
 Only Stephen Frears FLORENCE Foster JENKINS, THE QUEEN, MRS HENDERSON PRESENT- can be possible made this emotionally so touching drama.
 Also Judi Dench once and for all deserves an Oscar winner for sure.
 She was not flamboyant or cried or shout or anything but she was so very herself all into the character. I was even wanted to see this movie a little more even during the credit is rolling. I wanted to see more of her life! Philomenas life!
 All of the Stephen Frears movies are so delicate and instant classic that you should just have to buy them and collect them.
 Steve Googan doesnt believe in god that much. He thinks that they are in some way fraud. When he hears about what happened to Judi Dench, he was so angry and that anger helped her all the way. I felt his justice.
 When they finally have researched and even meets the lover of the son, they found out that after the son- he was gay and got AIDS- got AIDS, he visited the convent to trace his mother, they all lied by saying she abandoned him and never wanted to meet him.
 He was even buried in the yard at the convent.
 They thought that she was a sinner and deserved not to even meet the son even after 50 years apart.
 May I ask what kind of a sin that sheve made?
 Had sex with a boy whom he loved at an early age? Is that it?
 Is is so against god that she has to let go of him abroad not even knowing that the nuns are selling the baby to America?
 Not even be able to meet him after he was succeeded He became a team for the President Regan as a politician and came back to meet her but they lied that she didn't wanted to see him ever?
 Sometimes if the movie is so real, the charactors are so great, as an audience, I become so angry as well at the fact.
 But how she reacted was, I was wrong.
 I am happy to know that I finally had a chance to retrace him.
 Dont blame the nuns. They did nothing wrong.
 I was wrong.
 But for Steve Googan as a man, he couldn't help becoming so angry.
 The very old nun still think that she is a sinner and what she did was all right.
 After everything have been passed, they finally wrote this into a book.
 It was all revealed into this book.
 As I said, there are a lot of similar movies dealing with this matter but this movie stands alone so vivid because of the director Stephen Frears.
 He knows how to cook two actors so well.
 Judi Dench constantly talks about what she thinks, at the beginning it was kind of tiresome but as time goes by we begin to fall in love with that.
 Steve Googan, a kind understanding man, a man with responsibility, brave and righteous man.
 This movie deserves more attention.

5807573,4,B00DHJSXLY,"I liked this movie . Judy Dench was good and, I was surprised, Steve Coogan was better.  It is a story taken from reality, sadly. More abuse coming out of the Catholic church and Ireland, exposed. A young, single, pregnant girl taken in by the church  has her child sold in adoption. This history  is exposed as pattern and practice of this institution in Ireland. I am so amazed by the reviewers who go completely off the hook in response to the element of homosexuality, the actual lack of response  by the U.S.federal government to the AIDS epidemic and the proven horrors and abuse by the Catholic church in Ireland (actually, everywhere). Sorry, for you guys, that the real world is such a bite.
Why don't you just review the movie and keep your side issues to yourself? Voice your issues at meetings.",1478304000,,806,4.615384615384615
5807574,1,B00DHJSXLY,"This film is so excellently acted and directed. I was engaged from the beginning. But at the point where they put the photo up of her son with his boyfriend, and continuing on for a bit, it became evident that this was nothing more than just more homosexual propaganda; Hollywood being used as a pawn to push this perversion on us. Too bad this storyline had to ruin what started out as a great film.",1477094400,,400,4.346666666666667

5807676,5,B00DHJSXLY,That deserves a broader audience. Another dark thread in the Catholic church's history. People continue to rise above the suffering inflicted. Well acted with the kind of comic relief life gifts.,1463788800,,195,5.32258064516129

5807703,5,B00DHJSXLY,"We have to do something about Judi Dench, people. Heck, she must be over 70 by now. How do we guarantee that she can keep acting beyond 90, with mobility and good voice? Like Betty White, for instance? If she dies or retires, who will do the roles she handles so perfectly? ""Philomena"" is a serious story with a few comic moments, but brings more tears than laughter. The title character's search for her son, born out of wedlock 50 years ago and adopted out to an American couple by the nuns who housed his unwed mother, is powerfully rendered. Based on a real search for a real man by a real bio-mom with the help of a real writer in two countries and many obstacles, it will have an affect on all adopted adults and their bio-or adoptive parents. Even you don't know any folks who have a connection to adoption, enjoy it for its writing and performances.",1461888000,,857,4.39622641509434
5807704,4,B00DHJSXLY,A really amazing study of human nature and the power of forgiveness and also an expose of a hideous abuse of power against young women that flourished unchecked and unpunished for decades.  While the ending is supposedly true-to-life it seems a little politically driven but Judi Dench and Steve Coogan's performances ring true throughout.,1461715200,,339,5.277777777777778

5807707,2,B00DHJSXLY,"The film portrays Philomena as a woman who can forgive the Catholic Church for decades of abuse, but who can't forgive a reporter for his anger at what happened to her? I just didn't buy that. Maybe religion does that to people, I don't know, but the movie must be doing something wrong when I felt worse for the reporter who had to put up with this idiot of a woman than I did for the woman herself.",1459900800,,400,4.141025641025641

Childhood abuse is not a pretty subject, and young mothers having their babies torn from their breast will bring either a tear or anger out of you.  And it is abuse, the way the Church treated these girls is beyond sin.  I hope the priests and nuns roast slowly in all for what they diid.

5807830,5,B00DHJSXLY,"This story will stay with you long after the final credits roll.  I borrowed this movie from my local library after reading multiple positive reviews.  I also think Judi Dench and Steve Coogan are wonderful actors.  I was surprised to discover how heavy the subject matter is.  The reviews I'd read made the film seem a bit quirky and heartwarming.  The bright and cheery movie cover also lends an air of happiness. Philomena is a gut-wrenching true story that feels like it must have happened years and years ago.  That this story took place in just the 1950s is unfathomable.  I have since purchased the DVD and the paperback movie tie-in, and have shared, and purchased, the pair as gifts for others.  When recommending this movie and book to someone for the first time, I always suggest watching the movie FIRST, for those who do not like ""spoiler alerts"" (for lack of a better term).  The book contains many photos that give rich detail to the story, and they also provide a summary of the story arc.  This is an amazing, yet difficult movie to watch, and I hope this review does it a bit of justice.",1449964800,,1105,4.563451776649746

Her child is given for adoption and years later she decides to seek him out. Steve Coogan plays a down on his luck journalist who reluctantly desides to pursue Philomena's story but gradually becomes engaged in the quest. Very moving account of a young orphaned girl seeking her child later in life. Based on real events.,1445817600,,455,4.560975609756097

5807903,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Ordinarily, if you tell me to check out a movie because its heartwarming, or great for the whole family, I grab my Howard Stern books and run for the hills. I do that because, nine times out of ten (OK, 9.7 times out of 10), that description is code for sappy and crappy. But then along comes an exception like ""Philomena,"" which is part comedy, part road movie, part tearjerker and yes, heartwarming and great for the whole family.

Steve Coogan plays a disgraced BBC journalist who, in an attempt to resuscitate his career, agrees to do a human-interest piece about an elderly woman who, having lost touch with her infant son in the 1950s, hopes to find him again in America.

Martin Sixsmith (Coogan) and Philomena Lee (Judi Dench) travel to Washington, D.C., and their exploits are charming and unpredictable, not cloying or clichd. If this movie was typical Hollywood fare, we would no doubt get scenes of Philomena learning to twerk, or performing a rap routine. Instead, Philomena gets laughs by defying our expectations with well-timed observations, or with gentle pokes at Sixsmith.

The screenplay, co-written by Coogan and Jeff Pope from a book by the real Sixsmith, time and again takes unexpected turns. When we at last learn what became of Philomenas beloved son, it caught me off-guard  twice. Without giving away too much of the plot, lets just say the boys adulthood involves Ronald Reagan and personal secrets.

Coogan and Dench are both understated and both very good. If the film has a flaw, its that the main villain, once revealed, is perhaps a bit too villainous  or at least this persons motivations aren't adequately explained.  Grade:  A-  -- grouchyeditor.com",1445472000,,1686,4.908450704225352

5807961,4,B00DHJSXLY,"Dame Judi Dench plays an Academy Award nominated performance as Philomena Lee, an Irish retiree living in England. She was an unwed Mother in 1952 Ireland where she gives birth to a son, Anthony, in an Abbey for unwed mothers. When Anthony is adopted by an American couple, Philomena is devastated and powerless to stop it.

Fifty years later, she tells her story to her daughter who tells a journalist named Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan). He gets interested and the unlikely pair make the journey to Ireland and the United States to find about her son's life.

Coogan and Dench are a wonderful team onscreen. The movie is a heartwarming delight overall. The film deserved accolades for the performances and film itself. The DVD includes an eight minutes interview with Judi Dench; a behind the scenes and the real Philomena and Martin; and a question and answer with Steve Coogan.

Forgiveness is at the bottom of it all, in spite of the Sister Hildegards of an earlier era, who could never repent or understand what our Lord really mean.  The journalist is a perfect reaction for one who does not truly believe.  This is a touching, understanding, and beautiful film.

I would have liked more information on Anthony/Michael as, apparently, the book upon which this movie is based does offer.
What really fascinated me, however, was the terrible Irish adoption scam that literally did sell babies right from their mothers' arms to the highest payer.
This got me to wondering about something that is very, very controversial and that is the extremely stringent Irish adoption laws that are in place today and that *may have*  something to do with the questions surrounding the adoption of two Irish babies by our own Supreme Court Chief Justice, John Roberts.
Rumor has it (and it is just rumor, I think) that Justice and Mrs. Roberts ---in their quest to adopt Caucasian children---went outside the laws of Ireland in their adoption proceedings; circumventing Irish adoption laws which, again, do not, I repeat, do not, allow Irish children to be adopted out of the country of Ireland.
So how DID the Robertses come to acquire their their Irish children?  And did he set himself up for blackmail if he did break Irish law?
Just wondering.",1443312000,,1336,4.907079646017699

If you are looking for completely one dimensional one hour and thirty minutes to reinforce every superficial stereotype of the Catholic Church, the Republican party, Americans or homosexuality than this is the movie for you!  Of course all the nuns are evil, just trying to sell babies and blame young pregnant mothers, and there must also be a hint of evil republicans shaming a loving gay man.

Steve Coogan and Judy Dench are great actors, but this movie is tremendously disappointing as the writing seems to be simply the fantasy human interest story from a Huffington Post journalist.  What would have made this movie somewhat interesting is if instead of a simplistic take on ""good and evil"" it actually captured the essence of the human experience where most people are trying to do the right thing, and truly intend to help people, but in that effort sometimes things don't work out right.

5808311,5,B00DHJSXLY,"This is a very moving true story of a very devout Roman Catholic girl who became pregnant and bore a son who was taken away from her by nuns who did so because of what they believed was religious reasons. The girl was driven from her home by her parents and was sent to a nunnery where she bore her son. She was allowed to see and be with the boy for an hour a day. But then, against her will, the nuns gave the child to an American couple for $1,000, a huge amount of money in those days. Now fifty years later the woman wants to find her son. A writer agrees to help her. The acting in the film is superb and the story unforgettable. The story, among much else, raises questions about religions. For example, did the nuns act properly and if not what should they have done?",1434499200,,775,4.105263157894737

5808314,5,B00DHJSXLY,I enjoyed this movie. This true story was handled  well  and with such emotion. Judi Dench has long been a favorite if mine and she did not disappoint me in her acting in this part. The movie has a serious theme and you might need a hankie. Still I did enjoy seeing it.,1434412800,,269,4.056603773584905
5808355,5,B00DHJSXLY,Good story and shows how persistence pays off.  Judi Dench is a favorite of mind.,1434326400,,81,4.4
5808356,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Terrific acting by Judy Dench.  I haven't been that fond of her in the over acted TV series she was in.  It's good to know she does have acting talent.

I know it's hard to believe, but I knew nothing about this movie before I saw it.  Even though the story was tragic for Philomena it was uplifting for me to know that despite everything she still had faith and hope in her heart.",1434326400,2,381,4.108108108108108
5808357,5,B00DHJSXLY,"A fascinating film which proves that fact is often stranger than fiction.  An absorbing true-life story of Philomena Lee's search for her son, taken for adoption when she, as an unwed mother  was forced into a Catholic convent, runs like a gripping detective story with countless twists and turns which would rival the best mystery novels.
Judi Dench is peerless as Philomena, providing a warm  portrait of a very practical, yet unpredictable woman who can never  be taken for granted.  As the journalist Martin Sixsmith  who provides the assets for her search to track down her son in the United States, Steve Coogan is also excellent.
Another fine film from director Stephen Frears  which also raises the ethics of child adoption, the secrecy and repression and general lack of compassion by, in this case, the Catholic Church in 1950's Ireland especially towards unwed mothers.",1434153600,,880,5.069444444444445

5808418,5,B00DHJSXLY,I love any movie or TV program with Judi Dench.  This one did not disappoint.  It is a true story and in some ways a very sad one but there are many lighter moments to offset to some extent the sadness.  This is a story of an Irish woman who after 50 years began to search for her son who was taken from her when he was three years old and sold to an American couple.,1432684800,2,367,3.8026315789473686

Overall, a good story about letting go of the past, accepting the present and forgiving and hope. The one lesson to take away from this movie is not to run from your past!!

5808897,5,B00DHJSXLY,"There is a potentially exploitative blockbuster at the heart of Philomena (2013), and as it unfolds we expect, at any moment, to be drawn into yet another example of cinema as propaganda. A film with the theme of abusive nuns in an Irish Catholic asylum lording over unwed mothers is an invitation for at least one audience-as-silly-putty moment, molded by hackneyed writing and line delivery. It never happens. Instead, we are treated to a sensitively written, smartly balanced drama, which never succumbs to overt sentimentality or cynicism.

Such restraint takes a collaborative effort, and Philomena benefits from the directing of Stephen Frears, Steve Coogan and Jeff Popes screen treatment of Martin Sixsmiths book, along with Judi Denchs astute performance.

Denchs portrayal of a devout, elderly survivor of convent abuse is one of touchingly nuanced wisdom. Sadistically dehumanized for actually experiencing puberty and having a child out of wedlock, Philomena Lee spends fifty years searching for the son that her religious superiors sold to an American couple.

After a chance meeting with the recently disgraced journalist (and atheist) Martin Sixsmith, Philomena embarks on a search for her son, which leads them both to Washington, D.C. and a heartbreaking discovery.

)Sixsmith (Coogan), a lapsed Catholic himself, paradoxically (and complexly) proves to be both Philomenas foil and means to the truth. Aptly, it is not closeted prayer, but aid from a fellow human that manifests Philomenas invocation.

Although cinematic treatments of religion have traditionally been fodder for mainstream audiences, Philomena somewhat slipped under the radar in its opening run. The reason for that is simple. To quote Paul Gauguin: In every generation the least cultivated taste has the largest appetite. However, after receiving a plethora of good reviews and (later) awards, Philomena found its audience and, even with its nonpartisan approach, still managed to provoke a good percentage of them.

Accusations that the film was arty,anti-Catholic, anti-Christian, anti-Reagan, pro-gay, and had a liberal agenda flew fast and furious, despite the fact that the film, like the book, was nonfiction. The silence is golden species of nuns serve, albeit unintentionally, as the model for this defensiveness. Upon hearing the confession of the nun Mary Johnson, who had engaged in a lesbian relation, Mother Teresa told her charge: Talking about the sin is as great as the sin itself.

In the Washington Post review of Philomena, critic Ann Hornaday describes a portrayal of unfathomable cruelty. One supposes she is blessed for thinking so, but it is completely fathomable to anyone who has been subjected to the abuses of organized religion.  In addition to the religious, predatory aggression vented against young, stained, single mothers, a second sin is lensed here: the sin of not talking about it.

The offended faction of Philomenas audience echoes the shadowy nuns here. Any mention of wrong deeds perpetrated in the name of religion, or all spoken criticisms, are a sinful blemish on the pedestaled institution and an insult to the faith.

Even the secular worshipers of the iconic Ronald Reagan jumped into the films maelstrom. Outraged that the film made a passing reference to that administrations cutting of AIDS funds (which it did), the extremists labeled the film as having a liberal agenda, despite the fact that Philomenas lost son worked for President Reagan and Philomena herself is, primarily, a religious conservative. One is forced to conclude, from said reactions, that the coveted outcome for AIDS victims is let them die in the streets.

Hornaday identifies with Martin Sixsmiths sense of outrage. She is less understanding of Philomenas tenacious faith and her (seemingly) having turned a blind eye to the vestals crimes. In this, Hornaday mirrors the secular world at large in failing to grasp the pulse of many abuse victims who insist that the abusers, the silent elite, or the self-appointed keepers of the flame will not solely own the religious tradition or have access to the Kingdoms keys.

In sharp contrast, those who desire nothing less than a perfectly polished veneer for the religious establishment will indeed find room for offense, regardless of the films inevitably impartial approach. Philomenas right-wing critics are predictably hypocritical in their complaints of the films nonchalant portrayal of a deceased gay man. These same critics have made no, or damn little, reference to guilty heterosexual fornicators because, in the 21st century, hell, we are all convicted of that.

However, it brought back memories of growing up in an Ireland that was close to the reality described in the movie since my father was the doctor at the local convent where there was a laundry. Snatches of old memories started to fill out and the sinister under-belly of a Catholic Ireland that we were proud of began to appear in their true light. In retrospect, we were in many ways no more free than those countries we believed to be living under some tyranny such as communism or paganism. It is no wonder that Edna O'Brien, who grew up in the same county and a little before my time but not by much, wrote a book titled ""A Pagan Place.""",1424390400,,719,4.373134328358209

I wd almost not watch it for sorry written drivel like that except that it sounds like a quality made movie telling a story that deserves to be told. But please, let's not demote her or her actions, pregnancy or story by making it sound like she ""fell ill"" which is a somewhat strange term to begin with. Truth be told she 'got' or 'became' pregnant. Whether raped or out-of-wedlock or even married and spurned (look it up!) she did not ""fall"" anywhere unless there is a hidden implication as in ""falling from grace"" or 'sinning' which I highly doubt. But it seems to remove all responsibility that she had in the fact or at least his with whom this situation had to do. Please don't brain-wash or talk down to us, the public. Most adults know what causes pregnancy and falling has little to do with it. Unless you are talking about ""in love"" which doesn't seem to be what the story--as good as it probably is---is about.

This is an excellent but very disturbing story.  I don't own many movies but after seeing this on a free movie channel preview I had to have both the movie & the book.  The movie takes a bit of poetic license from the book but not enough to be a problem.  It gives a very good portrayal of what happened & went on in those Magdalene Laundries in Ireland, which were just horrible & somehow stayed in operation until 1996.  There aren't enough negative words to describe the awful things that were done & said to those poor girls & their children,  Every time I learn of something like that I am so thankful that our founding forefathers had the insight & foresight to put laws into place that a religion would NEVER become the law in this country.  The movie is mostly about what happened to Philomena there & her search for the son who was taken from her.  The book is a whole lot more about him as a young man, which you want to know about after seeing the movie.  There are complaints that the book is a lot of fiction.  It is written more like a novel with dialog the author couldn't possible have known about  but I think the gist of it is probably true.  He had to have been conflicted about being adopted, esp since he was told his mother gave him away because she didn't want him, & because he was gay in a very anti-gay society.

I've also seen stories about how horrible teen/unwed moms were treated in the past (and some still are) for something that wasn't done out of malice, cruelty, it wasn't a criminal mentality that created the child, etc.  The Magdelene Laundries (that just ended in Ireland in the 1990s) were heinous, cruel warehouses for unwed mothers to hide them from shaming their families (not sure I'd want to live with someone that hateful anyway).  Philomena kept her son a secret for 50 years, and then told her daughter.  The search for him leads to the US (she didn't know that her son had been sold to Americans who could pay 1000 pounds for a white child, and she wasn't told he'd be leaving).  Not to spoil the ending, it all comes full circle, and she seems to have gotten some peace.

Highly recommended.... for birth moms, it may be rough, but it's also well done.  It tells about the horrors that young women/teens went through because they had sex.",1422316800,,1053,4.654054054054054

It is no wonder many have been soured on their view of Christianity. It is sad that people and organized groups use a respectable front to hide what they are truly like inside. The Catholic Church, the largest ""Christian"" organization in the world continues to flourish leaving behind a legacy of collateral damage. It is hard to imagine that Jesus would ever sanction much less use such an organization to represent him on earth.",1418428800,,565,5.0212765957446805

I never would have expected Judi Dench and Steve Coogan to be as charming a pair as they were in this movie. Judi Dench's character is very endearing.  She's a kindhearted, naive optimist teamed up with the pessimistic and crass Coogan to find her long lost child.  The story is heartwarming and will win over even the harshest critics.

film on a slightly different level than other viewers. The writing and

terrific. It is a sad and compelling true story but Steve Coogan did a
masterful job in getting it made. I am sorry that they didn't win more

5809674,5,B00DHJSXLY,"This is an excellent, thought provoking film that is based upon a true story, one that unfortunately is far from unique.

The film focuses on Philomena, who as a unwed teenager had given birth to a son.  Her father had been deeply ashamed of her and had, as did many other families in this situation had done, sent her to a convent to give birth in secret.  The girls in these Church run but state sanctioned and supported homes were required to both relinquish their children for placement in better homes, and to remain to work in the convents themselves for years to repay for their care.  This even though the Irish government paid the convents for the care of the mothers and babies, and the babies themselves were essentially sold to the highest bidders.

After Philomena's son Anthony was taken away by an American family Philomena managed to repay her debt, then rebuild her life, eventually becoming a nurse, marrying and raising a family.  She kept her shameful secret but never forgot her son.  Her attempts to trace him through the convent was met with polite but unrelenting resistance.  Finally she told her daughter her secret, and the daughter managed to reach out to a journalist, Martin Sixsmith and convince him to take on Philomena's story.  Together they began to investigate the fate of Anthony, ultimately tracing him to America, specifically to Washington DC where, in a twist of fate, he had crossed Martin's path years earlier.

What they ultimately found there was not the happy reunion that Philomena had long hoped for, but instead the discovery that the lies told by the nuns and the Irish officials had spread far beyond those told to Philomena and the other women but also to the children themselves who were denied the opportunity of finding out about their birth families.  She also discovered that her son, now named Michael, had also spent his life with deep secrets of his own.

This movie could have easily become saccharine sweet, and overly preachy but Judi Dench in the title role and Steve Coogan as Sixsmith, (also the driving force behind, and co-author of the screenplay) have skillfully managed to avoid that.  Both actors have portrayed their characters as wonderfully flawed individuals who are both sympathetic and irritating.

The extras included in this dvd make it well worth the investment of purchasing (as opposed to renting or borrowing the film alone) the dvd.  There is a commentary to the entire film, interviews with both the real Philomena and Judi Dench as well as a Question and Answer segment with Steve Coogan.  Additionally this is a film that bears watching multiple times as it provides much to think about and discuss on the consequences of telling lies and keeping secrets.",1411084800,,2743,4.866666666666666

5809707,2,B00DHJSXLY,"All I can really say is that I expected more from a film with 4 Oscar nominations.  The flow of the story was inconsistent, as were some of the actions of the two main characters.  This prevented me from ever really establishing any kind of a connection with either one of them.  If fact, the story felt so forced that I commented to my wife ""well, it's not like it's a true story or anything"", which I found out later to be incorrect.

Philomena was forced to give up her infant son by the nuns that took her in when she became pregnant as a teenager.  She had tried to get information on what happened to him but the nuns were determined not to let her find out.  Steve was a journalist who had just lost his job and takes on the hunt for her son as a personal interest story.  With his help, they get some leads and begin their quest to find the man who is her son.  There are several twists and turns in this story.  It is good drama and the interaction between Philomena and Martin were, on occasion, comic which is needed in this very sad and serious story.",1410739200,,734,4.2

Philomena was very courageous, strong, & wise to be able to forgive the nuns for such a terrible thing.  The cruelty of the nuns was shocking, especially later in the film.  How could she forgive them?",1410566400,,400,4.6571428571428575

That part of the film was quite a story of grace and God's ability to heal out heart.  Many women's lives were ruined by the Order of the Magdaline Sisters.",1410307200,,432,4.455696202531645

I love Dame Judy Dench, so it was so nice to see HER play this part as well!!!

5809850,4,B00DHJSXLY,"This is one of those movies that stays with  you for a long time.  I didn't buy it here, but I watched it from another source---I don't think this is a movie I would want to own because I won't watch it again.  It was too emotional.

Anyway, this is a true story about Philomena Lee, an elderly woman, who as an unwed mother gave birth to a son at a home for unwed mothers in Ireland.  It was her last cry for help because her dad kicked her out of the house and she had nowhere to go.  Enter the sisters who take her in with several conditions.  She works off the care she receives in childbirth(which is very little) and she signs over her baby to be adopted when the time comes.  Only in this place one never knows when that will happen and the mothers aren't told either.  By the time her child is taken from her, she has gotten to spend time with him and bond with him.

Flash forward about forty years later and Philomena has been married, has a daughter, and still thinks of her young son and what happened to him.  She has tried to contact the home where he was born, but gets no answers.  Her daughter concerned about her mother and also wanting some closure in this case, decides to take this story to a reporter.  And this is where the adventure begins.

The reporter, played by Steve Coogan has been fired from his job at the BBC.  He's looking for work, but he's not exactly excited about looking into what happened to a child of an unwed mother.  But he meets Philomena, played by Judi Dench, and she convinces him to help her out.  The journey takes them to Washington DC.  What they find is not only a bit of a surprise, but it's also heartbreaking.

This is truly a human interest story.  And at times I found myself near tears.  There were also light moments as the character of Philomena, a no-nonsense, Irish woman who tells it like it is and isn't fooled by anybody really gets special treatment by Judi Dench.  This woman can play royalty,  Victorian characters, and even simple women like this one with aplomb.  Steve Coogan plays the somewhat arrogant journalist who continually becomes impatient with Philomena and her very assertive and also friendly manner as she approaches strangers and tries to befriend nearly everyone she meets.  They eventually find some common ground and a good relationship grows, and in the end he becomes her ally in this quest to find her lost son.",1409875200,3,2403,4.419134396355353

An unwed mother and her child are torn apart by the lies and prejudice of those who should be protecting them, but in the end the mother discovers the truth and a sour, cynical reporter finds new purpose.  This isn't the movie for you if you are looking for a romantic comedy or are a hardcore Catholic who thinks the church can do no wrong.

A true story about how the catholic church bullied teen mothers into giving up their babies and a mother fight to find him.
I especially liked the journalist in this movie who always had choice remarks about religion and the nuns running the catholic boarding house.  Really funny guy (the journalist) who helps Phelomena find her son.

Rather, it's a true story of love, dedication and courage in the face of very challenging circumstance.  No explosions or car chases.  No steamy sex or slapstick antics.  Just a very human story about people that you will come to care about.  Dame Dench does her customary brilliant dramatic work creating a woman of more depth that you might originally expect.  Steve Coogan, who also authored the script does an outstanding  job of making a remarkably insensitive and aloof individual likable.  No easy task.  Keep and open mind and a box of Kleenex at the ready when you view this one.",1408492800,,700,4.702479338842975
5810113,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Philomena, as a teenager, lives at the Roscrea Abbey Sisters of the Sacred Hearts convent in Ireland. A staff of Catholic nuns care for a number of unwed adolescent girls, either pregnant or have recently given birth. Some mothers do not survive the birthing process. Along with quotidian activities like choir practice, the girls do prosaic chores such as laundering clothing to repay the nuns for watching after their infant children. The one hour each day they are allowed to see their child is a most pleasurable time. When the infants reach a certain age, though, they are sold for adoption to American couples. It is heartbreaking for the mothers when the day arrives for their child to be removed from the convent permanently. Many years later, when Philomena is an elderly woman, a journalist offers to help her locate her son, now 50-years-old, if he can publish a story about it. Together they fly to Washington, D.C., her son's last known address. Surprising twists and turns in this memorable film directed by Stephen Frears.",1408492800,,1037,4.9314285714285715

I just want to say that this terrific film follows many of the rules of a great screenplay and works so well because of it. Judi Dench is fabulous as this gentle and unforgettable person who refuses to be damaged by the Catholic Church.

I will never, ever forget Philomena Lee and her son, who came to Ireland three times to try and find her and was lied to again and again by the nuns. I guess the highest praise I can give for a film is that within it are people whose stories will stay with me for the rest of my life.",1407456000,,609,4.161016949152542

5810290,3,B00DHJSXLY,"The premise of this story was very simple - a mother searching for her son that was given up for adoption 50 years ago.  Based on the fact that it was a best picture and best actress (Judi Dench) nominee for an Academy Award, I expected at the very least to be emotionally touched by the film.

I feel that there were a few reasons why the film didn't grab me.  One was that the film's focus on Philomena's (played by Judy Dench) search for her son is from the point 50 years later when she enlists the aid of a reporter Martin Sixsmith (played by Steve Coogan).  The film seemed to spend a significant amount of time on the Philomena/Sixsmith relationship and interaction which I didn't find very engaging.  Another aspect of the film was the Church and Nuns who put the child up for adoption and this theme is a familiar one which is hard to put a fresh angle on.

**SPOILER ALERT**  The other reason that the film didn't work emotionally for me is that a little past the midway point it is uncovered that her son is not alive.  This took whatever emotion that was starting to build out of me and a couple of the twists later on in the film didn't make up for that fact.

As it was, the film was okay, it was fairly short at 98 minutes so it didn't drag on, but it could have been a lot better if it packed more of an emotional wallop.",1407369600,,1337,4.171206225680934

Steve Coogan's performance is a perfect blend of his usual cynicism with a developing determination to do some positive good in the world--in this case for Judi Dench's character.  As for Judi, she's a marvel of honesty and optimism. Together, these two forge a happy outcome that at first would have seemed impossible.",1407110400,,370,5.379310344827586

5810397,1,B00DHJSXLY,This movie had the elements to be great but fell far short. Perhaps it is due to the cynicism of the atheist reporter or the unabashed rewriting of history in regards to AIDS but it failed on so many levels. For starters the movie go'er is left wondering how Philomena goes from living in a nunnery doing laundry to a nurse that married and had more children. Too many gaps and too much gratuitous politics.

She does a great job with the vulnerability of her character.  One aspect I really like is that the movie isn't too long, about 98 minutes, which is good considering the dour subject matter.  Too many times Hollywood drags these type of movies out as if trying to make us feel as bad as we possibly can.  I think this movie keeps your grief directly in line with the character's, and you feel Philomena's optimism as well as her sadness.",1406678400,,583,4.254545454545455
5810418,3,B00DHJSXLY,Judi Dench and Steve Coogan do a masterful job of creating solid characters out of a very fractured story.

Director Stephen Frears. Written by Steve Coogan, Jeff Pope.

Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) is at the doctor's office having just finished the examination. There is nothing wrong with him. He is depressed because he lost his job and it is not his fault. He is currently writing a story about the Russian Revolution. He goes to a place where a group of people watch the television. Looks like the news is on. They may have been talking about the Labour Party whom Martin used to work for. Martin doesn't feel like hearing it and so he leaves.
  Meanwhile, Philomena Lee, a senior woman (Judi Dench), is in a church to light a candle. She sits there and remembers her past when she was young. In 1951, she (Sophie Kennedy Clark) went to a carnival and met a young man. They kissed.
 Months later, she stands before the Mother Superior in the condition of being pregnant and is asked if she took her knickers down with the young man. She said ""yes"".
  The baby boy is born with the help of the nuns delivering. They allowed Philomena to see her son, Anthony (Tadhg Bowen), as he grew and learned to call her ""mommy"".  But then one day, the nuns allowed the boy to be adopted. Philomena was devastated, screaming the name, ""Anthony"", as the car drove away.
 Philomena remembers that today is Anthony's 50th birthday.
  Philomena's daughter meets Martin Sixsmith at a party and invites him to meet her mother to tell her story.
 Martin agrees to try to help Philomena obtain information of what happened to her son.

I must watch it again, however, because it seemed that they were able to trace her son in the US a little too quickly, and I think I may have missed something in the dialogue. (I have trouble with British accents.) Steve Coogan is so believable as the laid-back, former BBC reporter who is looking for ""that special story"".

5810583,5,B00DHJSXLY,"This is one of my favorite all time movies. The story is touching, yet filled with humor.  It leaves many questions unanswered but proves the strength of a mother's love as Philomena searches for the son taken from her at an early age.  The Irish countryside is pictured beautifully.

5810704,5,B00DHJSXLY,"The first part of this movie is difficult to watch in that it is so sad and a harsh indictment against the Catholic Church almost as harsh as the truths that have come out about sexual abuse of children that went unpunished and unnoticed for so many years.  I'm reminded of a scene in the movie ""The Way"" when the irish man says ""Where I'm from the church has a lot to answer for.  Temples of Tears"" they are.  I guess that this story would have been kept secret also except for the fact that we live in a time when due to journalists, newspapers and t.v. you simply can't hide anything, thank goodness.  I loved this movie.  It is so well done, the characters so well drawn and acted from scene one to the end. The relationship that develops between them is sometimes funny but you see the feeling that grows between them.  He, in a way, is as needy as she is.  He is wonderful in the part and, of course, Dench is always wonderful.  Along the way it seemed to me that there would not be a happy ending but then the story twisted and turned some more and it was a very satisfying end.  I recommend this film highly.  It's wonderful. Extremely well done. A real keeper, to be looked at over and over.",1405555200,,1200,4.223684210526316

Wonder how many every found out where their children went, or if many even tried.  The attitude of forgiveness and true Christian character portrayed by Philomena was heart warming to see.",1405468800,,355,4.866666666666666
5810709,3,B00DHJSXLY,"I was somewhat disappointed in this movie. It is mediocre at best. Of course Dame Dench's acting was spot on, but the presentation and production was just okay.  It left me asking ""so what?""",1405468800,,190,4.588235294117647

5810741,3,B00DHJSXLY,I was actually disappointed in the movie.  I read the book first and the book was so much different.  It was about Michael's life after he grew up and his search for his mother Philomena.  I thought the book was much better than the movie and recommend the book.  I will say Judi Dench was great...,1405296000,2,298,4.267857142857143
5810742,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Philomena is the story of a brave woman. It's hard to believe that supposedly caring nuns would treat young girls for their ignorance in this way. Teenage out of wedlock pregnancy was a hushed scandal when I was young, but to tear the children away from their mothers as these children were is just plain cruel. It is even more so to never allow them access to each other when they are adults and want the connection. Judi Dench and Steve Coogan played off each other so well and made the story interesting as well as believable. I bought this movie and will watch it again and again over the years because it is an uncommon story of common people. I hope it gives other women in Philomena's predicament the courage to keep searching for their children.",1405296000,,753,4.5036496350364965

5810787,4,B00DHJSXLY,"I really enjoyed this movie, even though it was quite sad.  This movie focuses on the search of a woman for her long lost son which she had when times were not so kind to unwed mothers.  I also recommend seeing the movie ""Oranges and Sunshine"" about children sent to Australia under similar circumstances.  Both movies deal with a period of history that does not look kindly on government or churches that helped to establish and eventually conceal these events.  It does bring to mind current concerns with adoptions across different countries.  It should make all wonder about why the children are available for adoption in the first place.",1405209600,,642,4.853211009174312

Take a look at this wonderful portrayal of a women that gave up her child she didn't want to give up!

5810836,3,B00DHJSXLY,"While I have always been a fan of Judi Dench, I can't get enough of her, and I love this story, I was appalled that Martin Sixsmith or those who wrote the actual screenplay would use this story to promote such horrific untruths about the republican party and conservatives and their attitudes about homosexuals.  Those attitudes were the attitudes of MOST at that time, but so it goes in Hollywood and the film industry.  None of that is true and it is outrageous that this touching story would be used to promote such LIES!!!",1405123200,2,526,4.585106382978723

5810885,5,B00DHJSXLY,Judi Dench was spectacular in this movie.  The plot was refreshing.  The lack of sex and violence was appreciated.  You can enjoy a movie without those two elements.  It brought back memories of the Catholic schools I went to for 8 years.  It also renewed my faith in the gentleness and forgiving nature as portrayed by the part that Judy Dench played as Philomena.,1404864000,,365,4.640625
5810886,5,B00DHJSXLY,"At first I thought, great bashing Catholic Nuns AGAIN.  But it's not about that, although I don't know the author's intent.  What I got out of it is the real meaning of forgiveness for the sake of peace in the heart.  This lady got what it meant when Jesus said forgive your enemies.  The victim needs to forgive their enemies, not for the enemies sake so much (because enemies are seldom sorry) as for the victim's sake.",1404864000,,421,4.428571428571429

The acting was well done, good plot, and actually quite more humorous in many places more than I would expect.  Judi Dench does a great job.  I've only seen her in her younger version on PBS English comedy show reruns.  She does a great job at serious roles too.  Also love the more unpredictable ending.  Might not be the fair tale/how'd you wished it would end, but it was more realistic this way.  I highly recommend it for sure.  : )",1404604800,,554,4.2

Absolutely horrible!  and then they lied to the children and the mothers when the children came back and tried to find their real mothers.  If you embrace the Catholic church, you should watch this and begin beating on the Catholic Church for relief for all the atrocities the church has perpetrated on innocent victims doing their dirty deeds in the name of God.",1404345600,,579,4.647058823529412

Despite the extreme abuse that Philomena suffered for 4 years in a Catholic institution, she was still able to forgive her oppressors. Both movies are truly remarkable, entertaining, emotional and educational. I enjoyed both movies.",1404259200,,549,5.310344827586207

It is definitely not a ""feel good"" movie, but rather more ""the story that must be told"" - and it was told well.  Be sure everyone viewing is ready to have the intolerance of the church exposed, disbelief in God highlighted, forgiveness questioned, and homosexual affection showcased.  I'm not sure this is the kind of movie you can really say you ""enjoyed"", perhaps ""was educated by"" or ""benefitted from"" are better words.

The issue is the shocking state of our health system""): Philomena, or Phabricating Philomena. Oh, the latest one is the shocking Tuam baby holocaust - you know, 800 babies thrown into a septic tank by Nazi-like nuns? Yeah - that's cock-and-bull as well.

Here's what's interesting about this latest hoax: ""The mass grave story is traceable to the work of a local historian, Catherine Corless. In 2012, she wrote a splendid piece about the Tuam home in a journal. Things changed earlier this year when her rhetoric became increasingly heated: She started making accusations against the order of nuns who tended to the women and children, the Bon Secours Sisters.
One of the reasons she changed her tune was her encounter with Martin Sixsmith, the English atheist who wrote the book upon which the movie, ""Philomena,"" was based. His contempt for Catholicism, and his flagrantly dishonest account of Philomena Lee, is indisputable.""

Philomena sets out to find him in his adulthood and this reporter/writer accompanies her for the story and now movie. There are some twists and turns to the story that you don't expect.

5811299,4,B00DHJSXLY,"Judy Dench in my opinion is top notch. I always am impressed with her acting abilities and her ability to make her roles believable. This is the first time I saw her in a ""down to earth"" role and I love her even more. It's a heartwarming due to Ms. Denches role as a mother searching for her son taken from her at the Magdalen School after her parents shunned her because she was pregnant out of wedlock. It's many years later and she found her son was adopted by an American family and moved to the States. A writer has a job to write her story and offers to take her to America to find her adopted son. The writer isn't as likable as she and is,  and he is sometimes quite rude. Ms Denchs' character puts him in his place after she stops getting hurt by his rudeness. She turns this writer a bit likable in some ways, which is the best part of this movie in my opinion. It's is upsetting however, to find this really did happen. Judy Dench's character had a child out of wedlock and was a prisoner of this ""School"" of abuse and many of the young girls felt they were guilty and belonged there for their sins as most were devout Catholics. I saw a documentary/drama of the Magdalen Catholic School in Ireland where innocent and naive young girls were sent there because of the embarrassment to their families. The girls were held  against their will and their babies were adopted without even considering the teenaged mothers. The school is known for it's horrific abuse suffered and the girls were treated as prisoners. It's a jail nobody would question because of the stigma of premarital sex, especially with the devout Catholics of that time. The nuns did as they wished as well as the priests who would rape and molest some then preach the bible. It's worth researching this after watching.",1403136000,,1796,4.455927051671733

Like a fairy tale it unravels peeling the layers for all involved.",1402876800,,261,5.55
5811362,4,B00DHJSXLY,"This was a movie I settled in to watch reluctantly, and with no pre-knowledge of the back story (""inspired by true events"", which always sounds like an opportunity to play fast and loose with the facts).

The movie gets off to a rather choppy start, as it time shifts between present-day England (where journalist Martin Sixsmith has just lost his job under somewhat unclear circumstances), and early 1950s Ireland (where teenager Philomena Lee becomes an unwed mother whose baby boy, Anthony --and fate-- are literally delivered into the hands of the Catholic nuns of the Sean Ross Abbye in Rosecrea, Ireland). As the movie begins, Philomena is unburdening her long-held secret of her first child's birth at Roscrea to her adult daughter, Jane, and confessing her 50-year old wish to discover his fate. Shortly afterwards, Jane pitches the possible ""human interest"" story to the the floudering, jaded Martin.

The results include Martin and Philomena's travels together to Rosecrae and eventually, the United States as leads to her Anthony's fate alternately appear and evaporate. Along the way, Martin and Philomena are forced to find their way across gulfs of faith, age, culture and education as the they explore truths about themselves.

Mostly this is done artfully. And when it turns out that her son was a closeted gay man serving in the highest ranks of two Republican White Houses whose life was claimed by AIDS, the movie provides just enough context about those administrations' views to clarify for younger viewers why this might be problematic for those in the middle of it.  Similarly, while some might claim this movie has an anti-Catholic agenda, this was not my take-away. Quite the contrary, I'd argue Philomena's steadfast insistence on forgiving the narrow views of the morality of unwed motherhood is in fact an argument for the strength of faith instilled in her.

There's no shortage of online debate about the complete veracity of this movie. I'll leave that to others, and leave those without preconceptions about either homosexuality or Catholicism to watch this movie and make reach threir own conclusions. Nobody but the most cynical or hardened of viewers can watch the final minutes of this movie --and the missed opportunities for mother and son to connect again-- and be unmoved.

Even with the addition of dramatic license, far better than mainstream formulaic offerings, and is well worth the time invested in watching.",1402876800,2,2454,5.1225

The relationship that develops between the unrefined, plain-speaking Philomena (Judi Dench) and a burnt out, cynical journalist (Steve Coogan) is a fascinating exchange of perspectives and lessons as they search for the son that Philomena inadvertently surrendered to a Catholic institution for unwed girls some 50 years earlier. The true story may provoke anger and outrage (with good reason); the film is a blend of wit and wills, of tenderness and edginess, of unexpected turns and a surprising measure of grace.

5811425,5,B00DHJSXLY,"I was impressed by the performance of Judi and Steve in a real life story. The respect for the persona that they played. I specially loved at the end of the movie, how Philomena react to the hate of the sister. For me a lesson of how to do justice without hate.",1402704000,,261,4.038461538461538
5811426,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Dench and Coogan make Philomena's account of her search for her son come alive. Heart-warming especially because it is based on fact, with a bittersweet ending that adheres to Philomena's story. At points humorous, but always engaging. The two actors play off each other in charming fashion. Recommended.",1402617600,,304,5.354166666666667

5811428,4,B00DHJSXLY,"Judi Dench steals the show of a script that could use far more character development. The story is one worth reading about, but doesn't translate as cinematically as one would have hoped. More documentary style than feature. Oh, well.

5811433,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Philomena is how we all should aspire to be.  Except if we don't speak up when abuses are occurring in the name of religion we are just as guilty as the perpetrators.  The reporter that accompanies philomena along her journey plays that part well and learns an important lesson from Philomena: not all believers in God are hypocrites, some truly try to aspire to be humanistic in practicing their faith. Too bad many people today only use God as a reason to hate and try to punish those who don't believe as they do.",1402531200,,516,4.4787234042553195

5811462,4,B00DHJSXLY,"I was really looking forward to seeing steve koogan after his brilliant film ""the trip"" he underplayed the part a little too much, perhaps daunted by dench who never gets it wrong. a little black and white with the sub-characters and plot but a nice quiet little film and that alone makes it worth supporting",1402444800,,308,4.618181818181818
5811463,5,B00DHJSXLY,This was an important story to be told and it is very relevant to the work that I do. The acting was suburb. I was completely captivated from beginning to end.,1402444800,,159,4.161290322580645
5811474,5,B00DHJSXLY,Judi Dench is amazing as always.  This is based on a true story and highlights one of the dark secrets of the Catholic church in Ireland.  It's heart wrenching.,1402444800,,160,4.482758620689655
5811475,5,B00DHJSXLY,"I love almost every movie I have ever seen with Judi Dench in it even when she played ""M"" in the 007 action hits of recent years.  So I was already sure I would not likely be disappointed. This is definitely her style and a perfect performance.  She plays the part of a woman she had a son out of wedlock when she was quite young.  She was forced to give  the boy up for adoption at the insistance of a group of nuns who take her in.  As an older woman some fifty years later she goes back to Ireland trying to find some trace or information on the son which leads her with the help of a journalist reporter to travel to the United States to find the son she lost so long ago.  To tell more would be to spoil.  It is finely done and worth a watch.  I consider it one of the finest movies I have seen in quite a while.",1402358400,,817,3.8795180722891565
5811476,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Loved the emotional twists and turns in this story and it is even a more incredible story, because it was true. The acting was superb - but this to me was more about the truth behind a mystery.",1402358400,,193,4.105263157894737
5811477,5,B00DHJSXLY,Such a wonderful heartwarming movie. Both the main actors were so great and made the story line so real. I actually shed a few tears during the movie. My husband watched it with me and he loved it too. (He is usually does not like subjects like this) Who wouldn't like a performance by Judy Dench?,1402358400,,297,4.321428571428571

5811479,4,B00DHJSXLY,Judi Dench was phenomenal as always. Steve Coogan was really good. He seems familiar but I have no idea where I have seen him before?  The story took you through a full range of emotions. It was beautifully shot and well directed.,1402358400,,230,4.476190476190476
5811480,4,B00DHJSXLY,I thought this movie would be a lot more sentimental and a lot less interesting than it actually is. Great performances from everyone involved and a story that turns out somewhat differently than you expect. Made me interested in the book it's based on (a true story).,1402358400,,268,4.723404255319149

5811482,4,B00DHJSXLY,"This was a very sweet movie, it did not just rage on the Church or the home for unwed mothers as it could have; it just let the story unfold. The story also took some unexpected turns along the way. The real gold here was Judy Dench, she gives a perfectly wonderful performance. The interaction between her and Steve Coogan was excellent.
My wife and I both enjoyed it.",1402358400,,369,4.36231884057971
5811483,4,B00DHJSXLY,It was a poignant story that exposes the harsh treatment of unwed mothers in Ireland still in the 20 the century.  Judy French is spectacular. The human ability to forgive is portrayed with amazing grace.,1402358400,,204,4.828571428571428

5811506,5,B00DHJSXLY,"An excellent story, and an excellent portrayal of the real Philomena.  As she always does in her films and TV, Dame Judi Dench did an outstanding portrayal of Philomena.  The story is both sad and a touch of humor. Great expression of a Mother's love for her son, who was taken away from her when he was about 4 years old.
she spent time and money to locate him.  You must see this story! It will stay with you. I would recommend this DVD to all.",1402358400,,446,4.162790697674419

5811510,5,B00DHJSXLY,An important story well told.  The poor girls consigned to the Magdalene Laundry must not be forgotten.  Judi Dench is a gem.,1402358400,,125,4.636363636363637
5811511,5,B00DHJSXLY,Because this movie is based on true events it is all the more sad and moving.  One hopes this type of thing will never happen again.,1402358400,,132,4.076923076923077

5811524,5,B00DHJSXLY,What a wonderful movie and story.  The acting is superb and what an insight as to how strict the nuns were at that time.  It is absolutely heartbreaking to think that a child can be taken away from its mother just because of one night's indiscretion.,1402272000,,250,4.413043478260869

5811527,5,B00DHJSXLY,What a terrific movie this is. Not to mention  Judi Dench is one of my favorite actress. She is at her very best in this movie.,1402272000,,127,3.8846153846153846
5811528,5,B00DHJSXLY,A feel good movie even though you get angry at the strictness of the religious codes back then.  Judi Dench is just great.  Loved the whole movie.  It was very real.  She could be a neighbor.  Sad but loving.  Will watch this many times.,1402272000,,237,4.2727272727272725

5811532,5,B00DHJSXLY,"This movie touched me so much. As my title states, my heart broke for Philomena when her son was taken from her and then again what happened when she found out what had happened to him. Steve Coogan gave a good performance but Dame Judi Dench was breathtaking. It was her movie through and through. While, there were apparently some poetic license taken with the real story, I'm astounded, horrified, and amazed at everything that was true.",1402185600,,440,4.7272727272727275

5811543,5,B00DHJSXLY,Based on true events. It reveals the inhumane treatment of mothers who gave birth out of wedlock and who lived with nuns. Great actors and acting. Must see.,1402185600,,156,4.607142857142857
5811544,4,B00DHJSXLY,"I thought this might be depressing, but it was actually very good.  It kept us interested in what would happen next, and the characters were interesting and didn't react the way I expected.  Enjoyable and interesting, not depressing.",1402185600,,233,5.105263157894737
5811545,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Dame Judy Dench us as usual very good. It is a very thought provoking movie , very sad, makes one very angry at what was done to so many young girls at that time.",1402185600,,162,3.7941176470588234
5811546,5,B00DHJSXLY,What can I say? I cried. This movie is very moving and thought provoking. It tackles major issues surrounding motherhood and what exactly it means in various contexts. Being a birth mother as well as an adoptive mother I felt this movie championed both. Judi Dench is a professional beyond compare. Many don't know that her eyesight is so poor she cannot read cue lines and memorizes her part entirely.  I did feel that her part was played in a very stoic manner rather than portraying it in a more emotionally charged way.  Excellent movie.,1402185600,,541,4.684210526315789
5811547,4,B00DHJSXLY,This movie starts out slow but picks up pace as it goes. It has a lot of turns at end. I am not much for English speaking shows but this one was good.,1402099200,,150,3.5757575757575757
5811548,3,B00DHJSXLY,"I enjoy both actors, so of course I found them to be engaging and like-able.

5811551,5,B00DHJSXLY,A really great beautiful movie.  The emotion was so real and moving.  It was recommended by a friend and I totally loved the whole movie.,1402099200,,137,4.44
5811552,5,B00DHJSXLY,Loved it.  Touching with a chuckle thrown in.  Of couse Judi Dench is wonderful as sever.  Toped off to know it is a true story makes it even better,1402099200,,148,4.0344827586206895

5811577,1,B00DHJSXLY,"Didn't think the 'Dame' could be bad in anything.  I don't think Judi could wrap her head around this woman...and no wonder!  We've heard the sad stories of the Magdalene girls before and those big bad nuns.  Here it comes again, more confusing than ever.  Girl gets pregnant, is kicked out with nowhere to go, nuns take her in, she signs papers to give baby up for adoption but meanwhile has four or five years? where she lives together in 'the home' with her son before he's adopted.  She then goes on with her life, marries, has other children, becomes a nurse and eventually looks him up.  Throughout, good Catholic girl that she has remained, she holds no grudge against the sisters...until the bitter end which doesn't turn out like she hoped.  Times and morals were different in the decades before free love.  No excusing the harshness even cruelty perpetrated on the 'wayward girls', but I didn't understand Philomena's viewpoint any better at the end than I did at the beginning or the middle.",1402012800,7,1002,4.718390804597701

5811579,4,B00DHJSXLY,"This is a surprisingly good movie. I feared it might be a a Lifetime-quality movie, but it was far superior to those.  It took a poignant topic and maintained the inherent complexities rather than glossing over them.",1402012800,,216,4.837837837837838

5811606,5,B00DHJSXLY,"A very touching story of a supposedly  ""good"" and ""caring"" charity gone bad and the subsequent efforts of the victimized mother to find her son.

In 1950s Ireland, Philomena Lee became pregnant out of wedlock, was removed to a convent and forced to give her child up for adoption. Half a century later, Lee (Judi Dench) contacts jaded journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) to help her find her son.

What did we think?

Philomena is based on a true story done right. The central premise  one womans tireless search for her son, and her strength in the face of heartbreak wrought by the hands of the Catholic Church  is compelling. Dench is a quiet powerhouse, and she and Coogan are delightful as the unlikely companions. Gorgeously captured scenery underscores the honest human drama. With a screenplay full of heart, the film packs an emotional punch yet never manipulates. Its beautifully nuanced, moving cinema.",1401667200,,790,5.0

Judi Dench plays the guilt-ridden Catholic woman searching for her son who was sold by the infamous Magadalene sisters to a wealthy American couple.  Steve Coogan plays the excellent fallen, modern man who acts as her personal detective and foil challenging her religious beliefs.

I almost passed, but decided I needed a sweet story right now (a dear friend just died).  It turns out that the movie was excellent and beyond my expectations.  The pace did not drag and it kept me engaged.  Steve Coogan had wonderful facial expressions (and a voice reminiscent of David Frost) as a disgruntled former Catholic and recently fired BBC newscaster who helps a still devout old Irish woman locate the illegitimate son she lost when he was young (he was ""sold"" by the Catholic nuns to a wealthy American family.)  I won't expound of Dame Dench's acting ability, but it's obvious why she became a ""Dame"".  I won't give away the end, but it was absolutely perfect and I didn't expect it.

5811734,5,B00DHJSXLY,Very sad.  The interesting point is it is not only true about the Catholic Church in Ireland but it still goes on.  Organized Religion is just about MONEY.  Only the weak are the sheep who follow it.  This is true with the Mormon Church.  WHO DO THEY HELP?  NO ONE!  Wars are fought because of Religion.  I don't believe Jesus had any of this in mind.

5811737,5,B00DHJSXLY,"What an amazing film! Honest, disturbing, heartbreaking and flawlessly acted all at once. This film reminded me of why Dame Judi Dench was knighted, why she has an Oscar winner and why she is considered one of the most important theater actresses ever. She is a gift and she leaves nothing in the acting bag with this film. She portrays a simple, though not stupid woman with a deft touch. And in the process reminds us that being smart isn't always the same as being intelligent. Her character has grace, flaws, courage and wit and wears them all with the elan of a Paris runway model during fashion week. All while struggling to right a wrong not her own but one done to her. This is not a happy ending film and the films' creators are okay with that. As is the main character. Of particular note is how this character takes a cynical, angry reporter with her on this journey and changes him not with the power of persuasion but the strength of her character. He does become a happy person, but he does see himself for what he has become and goes on to alter that narrative before it completely consumes him. what a great story. Absolutely worth it.",1401494400,,1151,4.459715639810427

5811752,5,B00DHJSXLY,"That's a film from our time and our continent, from Ireland for sure but it could be from many other places in this world. The Celtic harp is the key to the story.

Like all testimonies of some past horror, after seeing it, after being told about it, no one can really say anything coherent about the drama they have just witnessed.

Did that girl who had been entrusted to a nunnery for her education and had fallen into some carnal attraction deserve the severe punishment of dying in labor because the nuns did not provide her with any medical help, or deserve the punishment of seeing her own child be adopted away for a big sum of money from some rich Americans, or deserve the revenge of these nuns who refuse fifty years later to give her any indication about her son, and even lie to this mother in her old age and her lifelong repentance?

If it were only one girl, we would say there was something wrong with her, but when there were always a dozen of girls in the same situation practically permanently in that nunnery, you can wonder what was wrong with this institution that could not educate these girls into some prudence and care about what they did. There sure was something wrong since they did not inform the girls of the danger of having sex on the wild side of the moon, and they did not provide the girls with any protection, of course not we are Catholic and we are in 1952, in other words in the Middle Ages, and we have to keep in mind the Catholic church, in spite of its recently promoted Pope, still advocates some hostility against any protection at all, and of course against abortion, which should never have to be performed if all precautions had been taken before, provided the teenagers were informed about these dangers and these protections.

Was that cultivated ignorance a way to keep a dozen of adoptable children in constant availability for the parents who were ready to provide the nunnery with a wealthy income? Was that nunnery a nursery of orphans to be sold to the highest bidders?

We have to keep in mind that contraception was liberated only twenty or thirty years after World War II in many western countries, and is still not common in many countries today, even when the law has made it legal. A shortage is so easily organized in this market economy.

So is it the fault of Ireland who was thinking of many other problems including a civil war and did not even thought of women's rights? Is it the fault of the nuns who were totally engulfed in an ideology that made sex a sin and carnal desire a crime? Is it the fault of the Catholic church that was and still is in many ways tied up in some medieval beliefs? And is this Catholic church the only culprit in this world on that crime against humanity that uses sex to crush people down and keep them in some kind of mental slavery? Are other religions and fundamentalist ethics better on that subject?

We are confronted to a drama that happened in one situation but similar dramas happened in many other situations, orphanages or simple homelessness and neglect, and are still happening, including the abduction of millions of children every year, sold by their parents on not, ending up in global prostitution, which seems to be so profitable in the countries where it is economically accounted for and financially registered. Who is responsible if not the human mind that seems to just start being able today in wider and wider zones in the world to understand that individual freedom is the condition to individual success and that common success cannot be reached in any society when individuals are not free enough to excel.

That's what this film made me sad about: history is going so slow at times. And yet I am not that sad after all because history seems to be going slightly faster in the present period than it used to go before 1945. And yet has the world changed really? And will it really ever reach a proper general and global level of acceptability?

5811781,4,B00DHJSXLY,"Very interesting realistic film, from people from 2 different perspectives and times.  Philomena is so realistic about life and what it is all about!  Her ability to love, forgive, and make the best of any situation by putting others first was a refreshing character to be portrayed from a Hollywood film.  What was most amazing was that Philomena portrayed many of the virtues that the Catholic Faith teaches, in relation to life, love, forgiveness, and motherhood. Life and love is always difficult and requires self sacrifice, this film portrayed this well.  The nuns also sacrificed much to help these young women, who gave birth, it was sad that over time their perspectives became jaded as to why they were doing it, it was out of love, not punishment.  But understandable why in old ages they would become confused, as they faced their own loss of never have given birth, and helping these young women over and over with their losses as society continued to allow women to be uninformed about the reality of their own bodies, and at a time where birth control was not a reality, even if they did know.

Adoption of a baby is wonderful but always stems from a loss, sad for the triad involved, and can not really be blamed on society or a religion it is just a natural fact, that sex is a procreative in nature and the gift of life, needs to be protected at all costs.  Parenthood is always about self sacrifice and life will also present us with suffering in some form or another.  It was a privilege watch this film.",1401321600,,1524,4.597785977859779

But he learns about Philomena from a caterer at a party and so decides a paycheck is better than none and off they go to the convent where Philomena had her baby; where the child was sold to Americans and how she slaved in the Magdeline laundries to pay back her room and board.  So what makes this film so good?  Not just that it's based on a true story but that it demonstrates that some of the most interesting stories we humans have are our own, they're real and not fabricated.  Dame Judy Dench seemed to live this role rather than perform it.  She was able to communicate the gentle yet stubborn state that is belief and with grace and humility she was able to forgive those who trespassed against her.  Mare Winningham's few lines revealed a whole other story that needed not to be developed to be understood.  Scenes of old family movies also told a story.  This was a character based performance, no action required

Some of the best stories out there are slow paced and reveal their truths less through what is said than in those moments that nothing more need be said.  This is one such screen gem.  Touching and poignant and Kleenex worthy.  You won't be disappointed.",1401062400,,1299,4.5

5811967,4,B00DHJSXLY,"Philomena is well deserving of the 23 wins and 41 nominations received. Based on a true story of an Irish woman's search for her son, the movie is a journey of discovery. Because it has so many twists and turns that will completely surprise you, I won't spoil the outcome. (Tissues may be required.)

The story begins with Philomena's encounter with a young man at a fair, with whom she has sex. As a result of her encounter, she becomes pregnant. Her family sends her away to Sean Ross Abbey in Ireland, where she gives birth at a convent that houses young girls who are pregnant out of wedlock.

During her time there, Philomena endures the harshness of working seven days a week and the constant condemnation of the nuns for her sexual indiscretion. Eventually, her young son and another baby girl are adopted by a family.  For 50 years, she has kept the secret of what happened to her, even though she eventually married and had other children. In her mind, it was a sin to have given birth out of wedlock and a sin to have kept it secret for 50 years. She can't decide which is the worse of the two.

A journalist, Martin Sixsmith, decides to do a human interest story about Philomena's experience and search for her son. Her own attempts to find out what happened to him have been unfruitful, but with his journalist connections he is able to help her discover his whereabouts. They continue their search in Washington, D.C.  It is here, that the story begins to surprise and shock its audience, but it culminates in a discovery you don't see coming.

The movie is filled with themes, mostly around faith, guilt, regrets, unconditional love, and the ability to forgive the cruelty of the sisters' actions. Unfortunately, Philomena is a woman driven by guilt of sins past and those present, which have been placed upon her by the church. Martin is a man who doesn't believe in God or understands the reasoning of the Catholic faith, and he often clashes with her beliefs.

The true story is also a very sad commentary of the practices of this particular Catholic abbey regarding their own lack of compassion and secrets. From 1930 to 1970 they housed pregnant, unwed mothers, buried the ones who died in childbirth from poor care, sold babies, and continued to make the girls pay for their transgressions with heartless treatment and hard work.  In the end, it was a story that had to be told.

Judi Dench is wonderful, of course. She was nominated for best actress multiple times for this movie, and the winner of multiple awards. Steve Coogan humorously portrayed the journalist, along with his cynicism over religion and the church. At times, you chuckled over some of his comments and the sparring between Philomena and himself.

5812003,3,B00DHJSXLY,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Philomena is an interesting but odd little film that probably is more noteworthy for the controversy it engendered rather than for the efficacy of its narrative. It's based on the novel, The Lost Child of Philomena Lee by journalist Martin Sixsmith, a BBC correspondent turned Labour government adviser turned civil service worker, who became embroiled in a political scandal and was forced to resign (according to Wikipedia, the government later had to issue an apology and pay compensation). The screenplay was written by Steven Coogan who plays Sixsmith in the film. Coogan grafted a good part of his own personality on to Sixsmith who notably is Protestant with Coogan now portraying him as a lapsed Catholic, which is basically how Coogan views himself.

Coogan is very harsh on the Catholic church and the director of Philomena, Stephen Frears, basically admitted on Charlie Rose, that Coogan wrote his own autobiography into it. Frears took issue with Bill Donohue, President of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, in his article ""Debunking ""Philomena"", who claimed, ""A half century ago an Irish woman gave birth to a son out-of-wedlock and gave him up for adoption."" Frears argued that Philomena's child was actually ""taken and sold."" Donohue correctly maintains that the child wasn't ""taken"", as it was Philomena's father who brought his daughter to the abbey after Philomena's mother died when she was very young and he could not take care of her.

Donohue takes exceptional issue to the charge that the Catholic Church took the children and ""sold them to the highest bidder."" Coogan/Sixsmith imply that the nuns at the convent conspired to destroy the records through an act of arson (recall the scene in the pub where Sixsmith takes the word of villagers who believe the 'rumors'). According to Donohue, a fire did actually destroy most of the records as reported in the NY Times at the time--but all the rumors about the nuns actually destroying the records, was never substantiated (but the filmmakers act as if this is a fact).

Donohue also takes issue with Judi Dench who has been quoted as saying that Philomena was ""forced"" to give up her child. Donohue points out, however, that Dench forgets the scene in the film where Philomena acknowledges that she signed a legal agreement that she was relinquishing full claim to her child and handing it over to the nuns. And notably Philomena did this, not when she was a teenager, but when she was 22 years old!

Nonetheless, one cannot ignore Philomena's feelings of bitterness toward the nuns which she expresses throughout the film. The actual giving up of the child (indeed if that's the way it happened), was an example of great insensitivity on the part of the nuns in charge and could have been handled in a much better way. At the same time, Donohue can't understand why Philomena would complain about her grudge work in the laundry for four years. He writes: ""The fact is that the nuns did what they could for the girls in their care, when no one else would accept them."" He points out that the government was in no position in 1952 to care for the children. If there's anyone to blame here, it would be Philomena's family and Irish society in general--in 1952 Ireland, a baby born out-of-wedlock, was simply not accepted. Donohue adds that if the nuns were that 'evil', why did they help Philomena obtain a job after she left the convent?

According to Donohue, Sixsmith asserted that both Philomena and her son separately visited the abbey in 1977 looking for each other but the nuns have no record of that visit. Even more startling is the fact that Philomena and Sixsmith never went to the United States to search for her son--this was completely invented out of whole cloth by Coogan.

The bulk of 'Philomena' concerns the search for Philomena's son, Anthony (adopted name Michael), who Sixsmith (Coogan) discovers was a senior official in the Reagan and Bush administrations, was gay and died of AIDS, eight years earlier. After Philomena learns the shattering news, she and Sixsmith both decide to try and learn more about Michael and they end up speaking with his sister and ex-lover, who is initially hostile to communicating but warms up after Philomena directly approaches him.

Is Donohue correct in asserting that 'Philomena' is one big Catholic bash? Not completely as the dialectic between the two principals makes it clear that Philomena is completely forgiving toward the nuns whereas Sixsmith/Coogan casts them as evil incarnate. In fact, Sixsmith/Coogan come off as self-righteous prigs who refuse to listen to Philomena's message of forgiveness. When Sixsmith damns the nuns when it's revealed they never told Philomena of Michael's visit to the abbey, Philomena points out they couldn't have known since he was visiting them as 'Michael' and not using his birth name of 'Anthony'.

Nonetheless, Sixsmith is still enraged since there is at least one nun there, the ailing Sister Hildegarde, who would have known about Michael's visit and could have told Philomena later on. The problem is (and Donohue is completely correct about this), the real Sister Hildegarde died in 1995, and Sixsmith didn't start helping Philomena find her son until 2004. So the entire scene where an 'evil' Hildegarde blasts Philomena for her wayward ways is completely made up and never happened. Thus, the most significant dramatic moment in the film should be classified as wholly manipulative.

I'm not an apologist for the Catholic Church especially in light of its history of pedophile priests. Nonetheless, in the case of this film, it's clear that the film's scenarists have unfairly stacked the deck against the nuns who cared for Philomena. The film still is worth watching particularly for Judi Dench's great performance as Philomena, the chronicle of her quest to find her son and the fascinating controversy the film has engendered.",1400803200,,5970,5.003021148036254

5812045,5,B00DHJSXLY,"There are those movies that you want to see, others you feel obligated to see and some that fall into both categories. PHILOMENA falls into both categories, a sad tale that offers hope before the end of the film, a movie that inspires you to be a better person, to be like Philomena. Would that we could all achieve that goal.

The movie opens with Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan), a battle hardened political journalist caught up in controversy and looking for work. At a party he goes to a friend tells him to contact her should he ever decide to write a piece for her magazine. He also finds himself introduced to a woman who tells him he should meet her mother. Not expecting to find much interesting he agrees.

When they first meet Martin is unimpressed with Philomena (Judi Dench), an elderly woman who wants him to help her with a quest. When she was a young girl in Ireland, Philomena found herself pregnant but unmarried. With no way to support herself she was sent to have the child and work for the nuns at Sean Ross Abbey. While she is told ahead of time what will happen, it still comes as a shock for her. Children born out of wedlock in this Abbey are sold off to American couples looking for children. What makes it horrifying is that the girls are allowed to nurse their children and spend time with them prior to their being taken away. Now some 50 years later Philomena turns to Martin to help her find her son.

Martin isn't interested at first but the more he thinks about it, the deeper his interest grows. If nothing else he can get a story out of it. Contacting the magazine editor he met at the party he gets funding and he and Philomena set out to find her son. Their initial contacts in the Abbey lead to nothing but stonewalling and being informed that the records of all the children were burned in a fire some years back. Unwilling to settle for their replies Martin digs deeper until he discovers a leak that leads the pair to the U.S.A. Unfortunately the information they find isn't quite what they expected or hoped for.

What makes this movie special isn't just the lead in story. The movie explores the relationship between Martin and Philomena, two completely different people from two totally different backgrounds. The posh world that Martin comes from is filled with superficial people who consider themselves above it all, especially when it comes to religion. Philomena, on the other hand, retains her faith in God after all that has happened to her in the past. A salt of the Earth character, her attitudes toward the world around her are to see the wonder of it all where as Martin takes it all for granted. Before their journey ends Martin will find his life changed forever.

Coogan not only stars in the film, he helped write it as well. While not a known mega-star in the U.S., he is a big name in England. Some will recognize him from his roles in both NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM films. He turns in a wonderful performance here, showing his disdain for common people and being taken to task for that from Philomena. Dench is absolutely fantastic in the lead role, bringing a sense of amazement to the character as she observes her surroundings while trying to settle the heartbreak she has suffered through for all these years.

If anything this film will tear at your heart with the whole story of the Catholic Church selling babies back in the 50s. It will anger you. But it will also make you realize that it is people who make poor decisions not organizations. This was a small group that made this decision, not the entire church. At the same time in today's times it's hard to imagine a world where young people have no idea how they will become pregnant and are stunned when it happens. It only makes the loss they experience that much sadder.

Even with such a sad story there is much hope to be found in the experiences of both Martin and Philomena. Both of them walk away from the tale much wiser and closer than they were when they began this journey. The answer is found and just what that is I won't reveal. I would whole heartedly suggest though that you watch the film to find out. No guns, no explosions, no monsters or superheroes...just a movie about real people. In particular a movie about one true hero and that is Philomena. .",1400630400,,4289,4.498074454428755

5812137,2,B00DHJSXLY,I love British shows usually but this was not up to par with most. The story line started out interesting but got boring and added some twists that weren't expected and took away from the overall mystery theme. But since it was a partially true story there is no getting around the truth.....It was remarkable to learn how the Catholic church allowed or condoned punishing girls that had children out of wedlock. The scars must have been tremendous. But I still believe Philomena was a great soul for not holding grudges and keeping her faith in God and Christ.,1400284800,,561,4.6767676767676765

A white habit flapped and a voice said, ""That is no lady,  She is 14!""  The next morning in the sun room, I was watching the sun rise when I heard sniffles.  I looked around and the first thing I saw were fuzzy pink bunny slippers.  No one came to be with that girl during her fear and suffering, and no one came to visit her.  She left without her baby, and with no compassion offered to her by the ""religious.""  This movie spoke truth that I observed fifty years ago.  I hope that girl had the spirit and character that Philomena does, and that she eventually found kindness and her baby.

5812248,5,B00DHJSXLY,"What a hammer to the head!  Philomena is the compliant one who suffers by reason of the ideological conceptions of others.  Those concepts provide refuge from lived human experience, as though God wishes his creation to be other than he created it..  The cynicism of the journalist, the unbelief, the anger at obvious self delusions on the part of those ""offering service"" are the way most of us deal with the speck in the eyes of others.  Amazingly, it was when Philomena forgives the controlling nun who had carried her celibacy as a proof of righteousness and who had buried in her own life principle any compassion and thus missed seeing her sin -- it was then that the journalist caught a quick and unsustained glimpse at redemption and gave Philomena's son the symbol of unconditional love and undeserved forgiveness.  Anyone who has lived religious life in the 1940's through the 1960's can understand the impact of religious fervor turned selfish.  What a wonderful depiction of redemption -- though the story does not complete the story of Sister Hildegard.",1400025600,,1066,4.927374301675978

5812262,5,B00DHJSXLY,"We all tuned in on Mother's day to enjoy this.  There are scenes where you want to scream into a pillow because of the terrible things done by the Catholic convent to Judi Dench's character and she just takes it.  That unyielding loyalty is worth respect, only wish at the end she had cracked and admitted the evil's done to her were simply unforgivable and those who perpetuate it should be chastised at best.",1399939200,,410,4.527027027027027

5812268,5,B00DHJSXLY,"I didn't really know what the story was about when we watched this movie.  I knew it had something to do with a woman looking for a child she had 'given' away.  This movie is about so much more.  It is about a search, about growth, about a twisted use of power for misunderstood reasons, about acceptance, about healing, about significant relationships and how they grow.  All of this and based on a true story.  I loved this movie.",1399939200,,432,4.417721518987341
5812269,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Perfect characterization between these two leads. Being Irish & an ex-catholic, this resonated deeply with me. The rigid cruelty and punishment focus of the Irish catholic church is a black mark against Ireland and the church. This movie shows how the Irish catholic church ruined lives and destroyed futures while creating a white slave labor base to serve their needs ... and all under the guise of religion. This is a current story/condition that people will be shocked to see. What is beautiful about it are the performances of Dench and Coogan. They deal with happiness, hope, cooperation, frustration, lies, anger as normal people do as the story unfolds. He is an athiest and she carries the remnants of the respect for church of that day. Many unwed mothers who had their babies taken from them by the church and sold into adoption (mostly U.S. families) are looking for those lost children today. It's a Catholic religion version of the selling of babies and an active slave trade. All in the name of some god. The movie is so very well acted and presented with care and understanding.",1399939200,,1094,4.824468085106383
5812270,5,B00DHJSXLY,"This is a wonderful, wistful, spiritual movie. It's about a humble irish girl who got pregnant and had her child forcibly taken from her by Catholic nuns in the early 1950s. The child was apparently sent for adoption. But in reality the boy was ""sold"" to wealthy adoptive parents in America. Eventually he becomes a quite prominent political figure at a young  age. The mother is never allowed by the Church to know anything about the boy. Nor is the boy allowed to know anything about his mother, despite often asking. The Church and the nuns make both believe they were abandoned by the other. After fifty years, a British journalist, Martin Sixsmith, helps Phllomena - the young Irish girl now in her seventies - retrace steps and find out about her son. The beauty of the  story is the captivating way Judi Dench and James Coogan (who plays Sixsmith) bring out so tellingly the ambivalence felt by both as they seek out the truth. By contrast with the unfeeling and far less than spiritual role played by the Church and its representatives, Philomena ultimately shows a truly spiritual ability to forgive, where the Church's minions only instincts seem to be to rather brutally employ a repressive version of Christianity to punish ""sin"" and then to cover up their own quite inhuman actions. Anyone who knows anything about such groups as Opus Dei today, will see the chlling similarities between what the Church did in the 1950s and how it can still act today. All this of course is brought to us by the same Church with a long undeclared pedophile priest problem! A great movie showing how simple people can have more deep and genuine human caring and spirituality than mighty - and arrogant - organized religions. Thank heavens for people like Philomena! No thanks to the Church that they exist, I'm afraid!",1399939200,,1814,4.773885350318471

5812285,4,B00DHJSXLY,Funny how times have changed.  No one seems to think twice about children being born out of wedlock and multiple children to boot these days.  How sad it was back then that Philomena was so condemned for her 'sins.'  And how sad that she never got to meet her son.

5812289,5,B00DHJSXLY,It was an amazing story with an insight of what went on back then. Those poor girls being treated like that by those nuns who preach a Christian way of life and yet some of them were too inhuman that they should never have had that authority over these vulnerable girls.

5812307,4,B00DHJSXLY,"great story and wonderful acting, that will keep you in emotional state from beginning to end, with a few smile in the middle",1399852800,,125,4.478260869565218
5812308,5,B00DHJSXLY,"When reading about what this movie was about, it peaked my interest.  But I had to think about purchasing it because although it received award nominations and I believe an award or two, I wasn't sure I'd enjoy something with a rather sad (to me) theme - an older woman going on a hunt to find the son she'd ""given up"" when a young teenager unable to support him.  Sounds like a downer of a movie, but I wanted to see what the awards and award nominations were all about for this movie so ordered the Blu-ray.

I was immediately drawn to the handsome former reporter/journalist Philomena happens into.  Then I began to get to know Philomena better and understand her story, and admire her tenacity and boldness, determination, etc., I really came to admire her.  Since this is based on a true story, I was intrigued at what would happen...would she find him? would she not?  if she did would he speak to her?  if she spoke with him, what would she say, etc.

I was soon caught up with the entire thing.  I found moments of brilliance in this movie.  It's simple, with few main characters, and that's probably what I loved most about it.  It's not just another Hollywood pop-out-a-movie-quickly-made-so-we-can-get-money.  This movie has substance, emotions, complexities, you are along on the journey of a few people changing.

I ended up really moved by this movie, and while it isn't the only genre of movie I care to watch (comedies), I loved the journey, the movie took me on.",1399852800,,1479,4.620689655172414
5812309,5,B00DHJSXLY,Can understand why this movie was nominated for academy award!  It held my attention all the way through.  Highly recommend!,1399852800,,124,5.15
5812310,5,B00DHJSXLY,I loved it...I love watching the mutual respect that develops between the two main characters. Judi is superb.. She carries the movie well and is thoroughly believable in her part. I actually felt her pain and loss as she searched for the son that was taken from her. Steve Coogan is also delightful as the gruff reporter and journalist who helps her realize her dream. A must see for drama lovers....,1399852800,,401,4.661971830985915
5812321,5,B00DHJSXLY,Judi Dench is awesome in this movie. I would definitely watch it again. I would like to see more of this type of movie.,1399852800,,119,4.0

5812326,5,B00DHJSXLY,One of the better movies we have seen in a long time.  Great story and good acting. Definitely recommend it.,1399852800,,108,4.4
5812327,5,B00DHJSXLY,"I thought I knew how the plot of this film would unfold, but it continued to surprise and astonish me at every turn. The connection between Judi Dench and Steve Coogan is what makes it work, and must have been similar to the connection between the real characters - Philomena and Martin Sixsmith. He is an out of work journalist who agrees to take on this human interest story at the urging of Philomena's daughter and his editor, though it's not usually his ""cup of tea"". He finds Philomena extremely frank and forthcoming, and enjoys her delight in experiencing America for the first time when they visit Washington, D.C. to start the search for her long-lost son.

50 years after her son was taken away from her by the nuns in Roscrea Abbey, she is still conflicted between the shame of having a baby out of wedlock and keeping it a secret for so many years. Sixsmith can't understand her Catholic guilt, particularly since the nuns had mistreated her so badly. She vacillates between supporting him in writing her story and wanting to keep it a secret. When he learns the real story, he is angry and outraged, and doesn't understand why she can be so forgiving. These are complex characters, both on a journey of discovery which is revealed gradually throughout the film.

Some of the settings in Washington D.C. and Ireland are quite beautiful and the cinematography is rich. Both actors give wonderful performances. I didn't realize until watching the bonus material on the DVD that this is based on a true story. Thousands of Irish children were ""bought"" from the orphanages and brought to the U.S. Though most probably went to good homes, the manner of their adoption and removal from their birth mothers has caused untold human anguish, and this is an important story that needed to be told.",1399766400,,1800,4.747603833865814
5812328,5,B00DHJSXLY,Well done loved it. Judy Dench was terific. The sets were very realistic. I don't want to say anymore and give it away.,1399766400,,119,4.217391304347826

5812330,4,B00DHJSXLY,I had already read the book Philomena so I didn't know what to expect for the movie. It turned out to be very good and much like the book with just little details left out. The book has more about the time she was able to spend with her boy in the convent and more detail about her and her friend. The movie was as good as reading the book.,1399766400,,340,3.8714285714285714

5812354,5,B00DHJSXLY,Philomena avoids sentimentality which is a feat in making this film very realisitic. Judi Dench and Steve Coogan work extremely well together and are completely believeable. Stephen Frears' direction is impeccible and the script is brilliant. The pace of the film keeps the viewer interested without any moments that are superfluous. Dench and Coogan are wonderful along with Mare Winningham and Barbara Jefford as the vitriolic Sister Hildegard. Barbara Jefford takes a small but pivotal role and makes it seem like a large role. She is unforgettable as the present day Sister Hildegard. Jefford and Dench worked together at the Old Vic Company in Shakespeare plays in the 1950s. There is only four years difference between them! Yet Barbara Jefford is convincing as the older Sister Hildegard. Philomena is a film that can be seen again and again. It deserved its nomination for Best Picture for the Oscars. I cannot recommend this film highly enough.,1399593600,,953,5.15483870967742

What an opportunity for a great movie, yet direction wanders all over. Especially with Coogan's character.  You can fast forward to last ten minutes and get more out of the experience than slogging through the first part.  Keep asking, ""What about this?""",1399507200,12,364,5.333333333333333

5812390,5,B00DHJSXLY,I had heard the horrible stories about these nuns before but this is a beautiful personal story that is so much more.  It illustrates how wide reaching the damage caused by the nuns' imprisonment and forced servitude of unwed mothers and ripping apart of families was.  It is a remarkable story of love between a mother and child who had but a short time together and of how both refused to let tragedy cause them to hate.,1399507200,,422,4.467532467532467
5812391,5,B00DHJSXLY,"My daughter watched the video and recommended I watch it. Of course I so admire Judith Dench in anything she has a part in.
It was sad to see how the Nuns kept Phiomena from the truth of her son. The fact that this is true makes me even sadder that there are those who think they know whats best for people that they play God.
It was quite a journey she and her companion took. Simon Coogan did a very good job playing his role. Both he and Philomena learned alot from each other. Philomenas ability to forgive was more than I think I could have done. Good, good film.",1399507200,,568,4.126126126126126

It also gives one a greater understanding of the heart ache, anguish, and dry humor of the characters. This film is well laid out and moves at a comfortable pace. It is a must see film for adults only. There is no sex scenes or foul language but the story line itself would not be enjoyed by the younger crowd.",1399420800,,626,4.024193548387097

Predictable catholic response makes the story even more interesting as the uproar picks the scar off a wound that even well meaning nuns were unaware they were perpetuating.

98 minutes very well spent in contemplating where beliefs were 65 years ago.  Catholics might cringe a bit at the judgmental spirit of the mother superior but we all have a long way to go to reach uncompromising love for our fellow humans in our life's journey bb",1399334400,,578,5.042105263157895

5812462,5,B00DHJSXLY,"I read Philomena about a week before I saw the movie. The structure for the book was completely different. The first third was about Philomena at the convent until she gave up her baby. Then the book follows the baby to America. It becomes the story of his life with all his trials and triumphs. Then the last part of the book focuses on  Philomena looking for the son she had given up. I could not imagine how they could make this book into movie.
The movie changed the structure to start when Philomena begins looking for his son. There are flashbacks to the convent and things that happened to her and her son. But most of her son's life is referenced rather than shown. The movie works beautifully as a mother's quest to find her lost son and reduces the focus on the more difficult issues in the book.
Judy Dench makes Philomena come alive as a warm, funny and very sincere woman. This little movie was up for several Academy awards, but was over-shadowed by the bigger and more well-known films. However, I thought it should have won for best screen play from another medium. See this movie if you have a mother, if you are a mother or might ever become a mother. It is great!!",1399334400,,1183,4.401826484018265
5812463,4,B00DHJSXLY,"Very well done and a very interesting story. Knew little about the movie before we rented it and we were both very pleased with  watching it. Don't want to spoil the plot, so you need to watch it.",1399334400,,196,4.157894736842105
5812464,3,B00DHJSXLY,Love to watch Dame Dench do her work. She is a wonderful actor.  It simply wasn't that exciting. Perhaps I am ruined from enjoying the thrills in Breaking Bad and Damages.,1399334400,,171,4.516129032258065
5812465,5,B00DHJSXLY,"I had no idea what this film was about so I had no preconceived notions of whether I would like it or not.  I'm so glad I gave the movie time to develop, because at first take I thought it would be terribly sad about a young girl forced to give up her illegitimate child while at a Catholic home.  Little did I know what Stephen Frears, the talented director, had in mind.  Intertwining two very different characters through their shared journey to the truth, you are cheering at every small victory they encounter.  I just adored this movie.",1399334400,,542,4.444444444444445

5812468,3,B00DHJSXLY,"The protagonist in this film, wrestles with the issue of writing a human interest story vs. writing something more substantial. Unfortunately, the film makers did not engage in the same struggle. They went straight fior the human interest side. If you're interested in the subject matter of this film, see ""The Magdeline Sisters"", which is a much better film and much less charitable towards the catholic chuirch in Ireland.",1399334400,3,424,5.159420289855072

5812482,5,B00DHJSXLY,"This is a great story told in a fairly gentle fashion.  What the the Irish RC nuns did was incredibly sinful in multiple ways.

5812483,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Philomena was well acted and quite moving.  Dame Dench did an excellent job of demostrating Christian love in the face of enormous obstacles.

I personally would have emphasized how bleak (even life threatening) the other options (besides entering the convent) were for unwed mothers in Ireland at the time.",1399334400,,307,5.244897959183674
5812484,5,B00DHJSXLY,"As always, Judi Dench delivers...and so does the rest of the cast.  A wonderful, thought provoking story, based on true events.

5812486,3,B00DHJSXLY,"I was very disappointed in the book because I thought it would be more about the journey the mother went through to find her son. I was glad the movie came out and seemed to more about her story.

The movie had both funny and touching moments. It was about a woman who tried to find her son after being taken away to America when he was four years old.

I gave the movie only three stars because it felt very rushed through. But, if you have a short time to kick back and watch something good, this movie is for you.",1399334400,,516,4.049019607843137

5812512,3,B00DHJSXLY,I thought the movie would be much better from the hype it received (and the nomination). It was good but not great. Always love Judy Dench.,1399248000,,139,4.384615384615385
5812513,5,B00DHJSXLY,I had been wanting to rent this for a long time and finally did last weekend. It is so moving and I absolutely love Judi Dench. You won't be disappointed.,1399248000,,154,4.166666666666667

5812515,4,B00DHJSXLY,I had read the book first and the book was excellent. The movie was not exactly true to the book but it was still an enjoyable movie. Judi Dench is truly a legend and it doesn't matter what part she is playing she always does it justice. I will watch it again sometime.,1399248000,,269,4.09433962264151

5812517,5,B00DHJSXLY,"The role of Philomena is another example of Judi Dench's amazing ability.  Whether she is portraying Lady Macbeth, Sally Bowles, Jean Hardcastle or Philomena Lee, she becomes that person.  In my opinion, she is the most outstanding actor of our time.  And given the storyline, support cast, and Director, this film is a winner.",1399248000,,327,5.018518518518518
5812518,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Okay, as I figured, there are already 460 (!) reviews posted on Amazon forPhilomena. I wanted to point out that Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a film together under each version. So you will find lots of reviews of the theatrical version here as well as reviews of the Amazon Instant version. Neither of these covers the bonus features on the DVD and Bluray. So I always recommend that buyers sort the reviews by Most Recent first and then look to see which format the reviewer is discussing. With that said, on to the Bluray Combo pack.

I had a chance to see this wonderful film last year when it played the Philadelphia Film Festival and couldn't wait to see it again on home video as well experience the bonus features. Though my 42 inch TV screen is much smaller than the big screen I saw it on, originally, the film is just interesting and Dame Judi Dench gives the Academy Award nominated performance  that she was honored with.  The images on the Blu-ray are sharp and crisp.

Steve Coogan, who co-wrote the script  based on a short article in the British newspaper The Guardian  is best known as a comedian but he does just right by the story here playing an out-of-work newsman who takes on the task of helping Philomena (Dench) find the son she gave up for adoption. Personally I feel the less you know of the plot, the more you will enjoy the film so youll get no spoilers from me.

As for the Bonuses on the BD, the only reallu significant one is the feature length commentary by Coogan and his co-writer Jeff Pope. I would loved to have heard Director Stephen Frears and Dame Judi chime in but they aren't there. Instead we get a nine-minute Conversation with Judi Dench featurette in which she responds to questions shown as title cards.  The questions are about her career and things shes learned in her many years of acting (including her preference for live stage acting versus films. Next up is a piece titled The Real Philomena Lee which is really one of those Making of featurettes which includes comments from Dench, Coogan, Frears and finally the REAL Philomena and her daughter. It runs less than three minutes.  Lastly is a 24-minute Q&A with Steve Coogan from December 2013 held at a screening.  It does add to the pleasure of the film.

So, if you haven't seen the film, I do highly recommend it. If you saw it in the theater or streaming on Amazon, and want to know more, there are a few hours of extra material (including the commentary) here for you.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5812529,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Great story. Great acting. A lot sweet and a bit sour. Judith Dench is old, but age has not deteriorated her ability to act.",1399248000,,124,4.208333333333333
5812530,3,B00DHJSXLY,I would give this movie 3.5 stars. There are a few humorous parts through all the seriousness. It's worth the watch.,1399248000,,116,4.571428571428571
5812531,4,B00DHJSXLY,"Based upon a true story of which I knew nothing about before watching this movie, it is a sad, yet redeeming movie about another aspect of the human condition.  Steve Coogan plays Martin Sixsmith, a former BBC journalist and he plays the character masterfully.  Unfortunately there are far too many uppity journalists who think they are so superior to the mere meager mortals that surround them, especially those of the middle and lower middle classes, mostly because they are convinced of their superior ""worldliness"" and education.

Judi Dench once again perfectly plays her character (as she does every character) as a simple, modest, humble woman who has been emotionally tortured all her adult life by one bad choice she made when she was a young woman, yet ultimately does not regret.  Her undying faith in the goodness of people, the forgiveness she shows to those who have wronged her, and her joy in the simple every day beauties of life (that most of us miss) make her a most charming and endearing character.

A well directed and written (true) story of redemption, forgiveness, and healing well worth the cost of a rental.",1399248000,,1134,4.885416666666667
5812532,5,B00DHJSXLY,"What a powerful story.  As a recovering Catholic, it is both appalling and then, not that surprising.  The sexual repression within the Church creates such hatred of themselves, its amazing that not all those serving the church don't go mad....",1399248000,,244,5.075
5812533,5,B00DHJSXLY,This movie was masterfully done. You get the sense how much this woman resigned herself to not live a life hating those who took her son (in this case the Church).,1399248000,,163,4.290322580645161
5812534,5,B00DHJSXLY,Excellent movie! Heartfelt yet frustrating at times...a very beautiful story. Judi Dench shines as Philomena...and the story has many life lessons.,1399248000,,147,6.0476190476190474
5812535,5,B00DHJSXLY,Thank you Judi Dench and the real Philomena and all those who brought this story to the light of day: The reality of the brutality that exists in the Catholic Church. Philomena teaches more about truth and spirituality than the Nuns ever did.,1399248000,,242,4.651162790697675
5812536,5,B00DHJSXLY,"I was flat out surprised by this film. Thinking the bones of the story were laid out in the trailer but there is a lot more to the story than reporter takes woman to look for birth son.  Judi Dench as the title character disappears into the role, a masters class in acting.",1399248000,,273,4.150943396226415
5812537,5,B00DHJSXLY,A surprise of a movie. I was a bit hesitant to watch it because it got a lot of press. But it a a good story with great performances and an unexpected ending.,1399161600,,158,3.8181818181818183
5812538,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Hopefully, you will have a box of kleenex nearby because as this movie progresses, you will need it.  This movie mirrors many a women's plight back in the 1950's when an unwed woman found herself with child and no man to support her.  She is shutted off by her disgusted and dismayed father to a home, run by nuns, for unwed mothers.  She has her baby but she is honored bound to be of service at the home for four years, as are all the other mothers there, for her keep.  The baby's are sold for adoption to well heeled individuals. I don't want to give away the story, but this is a most powerful story and one that has hit home to many a woman in Philiomena's shoes.

5812574,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Great film, albeit a sad story that exposes the tip of the proverbial ""iceberg of truth"".  Superbly acted.  Dame Judi Dench is brilliant, as always.  Steve Coogan is amazing and very believable as the grumpy but lovable journalist.  Loved this film and highly recommend it, but keep the box of paper hankies handy.",1399161600,,314,4.867924528301887
5812575,5,B00DHJSXLY,"We should reflect more about how the modern society still labels and judges single mothers in many cases. Our world would be very different if we stopped judging others.

I knew the story was going to focus more on Philomena herself whereas the book is mostly about her son.
The movie was a huge let down. I am a big Judy Dench fan and she is always wonderful, but I'm not sure Steve Coogan was the best choice as I find it hard to see him as anything other than a comedian. I felt that the movie was slightly flippant and I could not recommend it, sadly.

The Church usurped God and decided to mete out punishment to unmarried mothers itself, simultaneously getting free labour and enriching its coffers whilst robbing the girls of their children. Steve Coogan is convincing as a cynical, previously smug ex political media man unwittingly warming to this 'human interest' story and its protagonists. Judy Dench as an Irish housewife surprises him with the amount of knowledge and wisdom she has acquired through the years from what he assumes has been a lifelong diet of the Daily Mail and Readers Digest.",1398988800,,632,5.205882352941177

I was shocked to read some other online reviews that accused this movie of ""attacking"" the Catholic Church. This is a true story, and as in life, evil comes in all colors and religious backgrounds. We frequently hear about unethical adoptions and services provided by those mere mortals who have betrayed those who had trust in them. These nuns were evil and should be punished as any other person would. Just because they are nuns, they are not above reproach. They chose the behavior and deserve the consequences.

I am a very conservative mother of 2 adult sons and would say that in retrospect I would have required them to be 12 to 14 years old before they watched it.

Because of this I found it difficult to find any characters in this story to really care about for everyone seemed somehow emotionally, psychologically and philosophically skewed.

5812759,3,B00DHJSXLY,The film missed the mark for me in terms of fully capturing the bond between the son to his mother. The main premise of finding the long lost child was solved within the first half of the film. The remaining body of the film was a series of non emotional meetings and reunions with significant members of the adult child's inner circle of friends and family.

5812767,5,B00DHJSXLY,"In 2009, Martin Sixsmith, former BBC reporter and government communications director, wrote ""The Lost Child of Philomena Lee,"" in which he recounted the heart-wrenching story of an Irish-Catholic girl who became pregnant out of wedlock. She gave birth to a boy, Anthony, in a country convent at Roscrea, Tipperary, in 1952.  After he turned three, Anthony was adopted by an American couple, in return for a handsome fee. Philomena, meanwhile, was forced to perform backbreaking labor for three years to pay for her room and board.

Many years go by, and Philomena is now elderly with a family of her own. She and Martin Sixsmith team up to learn the truth about what became of Anthony after he left Ireland.  In return for his help, Martin plans to write an expos revealing the church's cruelty to unwed mothers during the fifties and sixties. The script, which is ""inspired by true events,"" takes liberties with the facts, presumably to make the film more poignant and powerful.  Still, Frears, who directs with great sensitivity, and the two screenwriters, Steve Coogan (who portrays Sixsmith) and Jeff Pope, beautifully capture Philomena's spirit.  Viewers grow to care about this courageous and determined individual and hope that she can reconnect with her grown-up son.

""Philomena"" moves us without being overly sentimental.  Judi Dench delivers her usual spot-on performance, portraying Lee as a plain-spoken person with a backbone of steel.  She chides Sixsmith when he behaves rudely, but she refuses to take no for an answer when someone stonewalls her.  Coogan and Dench balance one another out perfectly. She is good-hearted, gracious, and a devout Catholic; he is brash, ill- mannered, and an avowed atheist.  ""Philomena"" has moments of gentle humor, but Frears and Coogan also touch on serious themes: the role of religion in society; a mother's enduring love for her child; and one's need for closure, especially after having suffered a terrible loss. Further enhancing the film are its fine cinematography and lovely, understated score. In addition to Dench and Coogan, kudos go to Sophie Kennedy Clark as the anguished young Philomena, and Barbara Jefford, who plays the unyielding, self-righteous Sister Hildegarde.  ""Philomena"" is a wonderful tribute to a remarkable woman.",1398729600,,2293,5.237704918032787

5812782,4,B00DHJSXLY,"You know when you go to a movie and you think you know where it's going to go, but it's okay because you're in the mood for that kind of movie?  Well that's what I thought with Philomena.  I thought, it's a movie about some stuck up journalist who gets a story and has no disregard for the subject of the story, but in the end, he learns something about how to treat people.  I was right about that part of the movie.  I also thought it's about a woman who suffers at the hands of the catholic church but triumphs over them.  That's sort of true.  This movie turns a direction that I really didn't expect and it's just so heartbreaking.  What's more, if you're a fan of the catholic church and would like to remain so, better skip this one.  If you're an ex, you'll be really mad, but not surprised.  I've been an ex so long that while I wasn't surprised, I was pretty shocked at just how malevolent they were.  I'd write more but carpool is here.  Great movie.  Too short.  I wanted the nun's ass kicked, but still a great movie.",1398729600,,1030,4.1938775510204085
5812783,4,B00DHJSXLY,I was aware of the storyline prior to watching the movie but was unprepared for the ending.  It does not shine a very good light on the Catholic church or the nuns but I believe it depicts what happened.  There are pros and cons of searching for children given up at birth- or children searching for birth parents but having a mother care for a child and then selling that child is just wrong!  Did the girl make a mistake? Yes but what the nuns did was wrong when they knew the child was searching for his mother and the mother was searching for her son.,1398729600,,555,4.216981132075472

Have you ever purchased fruit juice and took home, only to read the label and find that 'it contains less than 10% fruit juice' or 'no appreciable amount of real juice'.  'Based on A True Story' from Hollywood means about the same. This movie has more agenda to it than fact. I wish Hollywood would stay away from calling everything it makes 'art'.

5812811,1,B00DHJSXLY,"I thought I would really like this movie - I love Judi Dench and like Steve Coogan.  And it started out well. And it was acted well.  But the movie had an agenda against the Catholic Church, and the issues the Catholic church stands for.  And it played them out in a very biased way.

Maybe it's a true story, and maybe there were people in her life who were unkind to this lady. The world is full of imperfect people, of which I am one.  However, in the story, the church took her in when her father turned her out, saved her child, and she appeared to go on to have a fulfilling life. Such was not the case for many in her situation at that time.

It plays to the notion that only stupid people have faith and a belief in God, and intelligent people like the character played by Coogan aren't so stupid; of course he later in the movie brings Philomena to this bleak truth that atheists like the Coogan character, and possibly Coogan himself,  live by.

I found it offensive and biased - and was upset enough to walk out of the movie theater, regardless of the ""beautiful acting"".  If you too are one of the so-intelligent people that find a belief in God quaint and amusing - somewhat like the Amish in wagons - by all means go for it. But if you have faith, avoid it and tell others not to be taken in.",1398729600,21,1306,4.171314741035856

I loved seeing him grow and change through knowing her.  I loved seeing her grow and change through coming to know her own experience, partly through him.  An outcome that could have determined the whole theme and purpose of the movie didn't--the movie moved past it to claim its own ending.  It's on my short list.",1398729600,,620,4.433628318584071

The movie, based on a true story, deals with some key issues regarding differing views of religion, the Catholic church and forgiveness.  The story is beautifully portrayed and the casting and character evolution is spot-on.  And of course, Judy Dench is marvelous!

5812841,5,B00DHJSXLY,"In the Oscar race in early 2014, a brilliant film was nominated for some key awards, but was largely ignored at the end of the day. I saw this picture in the theater, but I saw so many other movies around the same time, that I kind of forgot to write a review for it. This was a movie that gets even better and more rich in its second viewing, a movie that doesnt lose any of its punch in a Blu-ray viewing. This picture is Philomena.

Judi Dench stars as Philomena Lee, a real woman whose wedlock-born child was stolen from her by nuns when she was a teenager. Her mother had died and her father had shipped her off to the nuns when it was revealed she was pregnant. She had an intense maternal connection to her son Anthony, but he was given up for adoption without her consent, and she had been quietly looking for him for over 50 years. Martin Sixmith (Steve Coogan) is a journalist who doesnt quite know what his own future holds. He is told Philomenas story at a dinner party one night, and he decides to take this human interest story, which isn't what he is used to writing, and tell this story that needs to be heard by the public.

I haven't read Sixmiths book, and don't quite know how accurate this film is to Lees real story. However, in this brisk and massively entertaining film, her story is very fascinating and multi-layered. Unlike many of the other Oscar films in 2013, the film has a humane running time - just over 90 minutes. However, these 90 minutes are filled to the brim with a rich story and incredible performances.

The story packs an intense emotional punch that doesnt hit you right away, but when it does in the films third act, youll likely be in tears. Judi Dench is basically playing the everywoman here - the every-old-lady, if you will. She will probably remind you of your own grandmother, or perhaps a teacher or some other older woman who was a great influence to you at some point in your life. She makes this (mildly?) fictionalized Lee someone who we love and root for from the beginning. We understand her and want her to find what shes looking for.

Steve Coogan, whom this is a passion piece for, co-wrote the screenplay as well. He does an incredible job as the man who stands as the voice of the audience - were hanging on every word of her story and were occasionally shocked, baffled and irritated at whats going on, and so is he.

The story is incredibly accessible. Im not a parent. I don't even like children at all, but I felt every bit of Philomenas pain, because she is a very well written character. It eventually becomes nothing short of an old-fashioned crowd pleaser once the characters come full circle. This is a film that I suggest you buy on DVD, Blu-ray, whatever you fancy. Its the kind of thing you can watch again and again, because I don't see it becoming any less powerful in multiple viewings.

5812847,5,B00DHJSXLY,"This was such a wonderful movie.

My wife and I discussed the overall theme of the movie for several days.  It was more than entertaining - it was engrossing.

5812881,5,B00DHJSXLY,Philomema-- a subject that should be brought front and center.  Are these people being brought to justice or is it still being ignored as something that happened then and could not possibly be going on somewhere today?  I cried from the git go with grief and compassion.  This might be considered a chick flick by some but it was brought about by a very brave women and covered a very sad situation beautifully.  I loved the simplicity of the acting and story telling. Awards were deserved all the way around. A must see movie.,1398643200,,527,4.574468085106383

5812898,5,B00DHJSXLY,This is a wonderful movie with a great story line and great acting. Judi Dench is always the person she plays just as she is Philomena. The interactions within the relationship between the two main characters is interesting as it changes and becomes deeper.

I had looked forward to it for a while,  but very early I realized the story was not headed in the direction that I had anticipated, and frankly felt misled  by the ads and trailers.  The acting was very very good, but the essence  of the story was disappointing. I liked the forgiveness that ""Philomena"" gives, who doesn't want and need forgiveness and a soft heart, but still, it was a disappointment in the story line.",1398643200,,454,4.487804878048781

5812905,4,B00DHJSXLY,This was a good movie.  It was based on a true story of a woman who gave up her baby for adoption through the Catholic church in Ireland.  She had to work in the laundry for 4 years to pay off what they did for her (which was hide her baby from the public while selling the baby to a rich American couple).  Eventually she searches for her son.  Felt like viewing a documentary.,1398556800,,378,4.0675675675675675

5812935,4,B00DHJSXLY,"As a practicing Roman Catholic I approached this film with a little trepidation cautious that it may be another example of Hollywood bashing organized religion.  That said I am also aware of the child abuse scandal that was not only exposed in my own diocese but others throughout the U.S.  After a lot of soul searching you come to the conclusion that our Church not only encompasses imperfect clergy but parishioners searching for a way to lead their lives the way Christ would.  Philomena Lee (Judi Dench) is a woman at the twilight of her life who has gained peace and the ability to forgive notably the Sacred Heart sisters who sold her son for adoption.  When the film begins Philomena is a woman looking for closure in her life wanting to find out what happened to the toddler son taken from her before she had a chance to grow as a woman and a mother.  She is assisted in an odyssey that will take her from England to Ireland to America by a recently sacked BBC investigative journalist, Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan), who is looking for a human interest story that will get him back in the game.  Sixsmith is the polar opposite of Philomena not only a lapsed Catholic but an embittered cynic.  Their journey together is not only a fact finding one but one where Sixsmith reconnects with his humanity under the positive tutelage of Philomena which allows for his personal growth.  ""Philomena"" will wring your emotions like few films can.  Dench's work is one of great nuance and warmth.  She and Coogan have great chemistry that brings out the best out of each performer.  Not an easy film to watch, particularly if you are Roman Catholic, but an imperative nonetheless.",1398556800,3,1679,4.6768707482993195
5812936,4,B00DHJSXLY,"I delayed watching this movie, because I assumed it to be what we used to call a ""three-handkerchief"" movie.  I was wrong, only one was needed.  There was a brilliant balance of humor and pathos here, and the combined interplay of the main characters, Ms. Dench & Mr. Coogan was marvelous to watch.  For a film buff, I haven't seen much of Judy Dench, for some reason her movies haven't been on my bucket list.  My bad because she's brilliant in this movie, as she displays a wide range of moods and attitudes.  Her character's insistence on remaining neutral over the circumstances that affected most of her adult life, can remind one exactly of dealing with an aged parent.  The rage she should have felt, is transferred onto you, the viewer as an ersatz avenger.  Since I had seen an earlier movie (forgot the title) dealing with the incarceration of young Irish females who have had sex without the benefit of clergy, I understood those conditions very well.  This movie was more about the later consequences in the lives of the victims.",1398556800,,1041,4.681318681318682

I loved seeing the research they went through and all the hurdles they had to jump to get to their destination. They both played their parts so perfectly.

The film was good, acting was great as it depicts the wrongs and misguided beliefs of the Church at that period of time.
So sad cruelty overshadowed goodness and kindness. The cruelty and suffering inflicted on young girls was nothing short of torture. And through it all, Dench keeps her faith and her goodness prevails.",1398556800,,500,4.825581395348837

I'm not a huge Judy Dench fan - not that I don't like her, I just haven't paid much attention to her to even decide to BE a fan - but wow, she might be one of the best actress alive right now.  She say's more with her eyes and facial expressions in one minute than most actors can in an hour using everything they have.  So convincing.

5812975,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Another friend had praised this film highly after seeing in the theaters but I remained a fence sitter until renting it this week and now I know why it earned his praise.  There's great humor and pathos in this recounting of how the real life Philomena Lee enlisted the help of former BBC journalist Martin Sixsmith to find her son some 50 years after he was forcibly taken from him by Catholic nuns running a sweat shop for unwed pregnant mothers.  The revelation that there were - and perhaps still are - such places of hell on earth as Roscrea Abbey in Ireland, where ignorant families angrily tossed their pregnant teen daughters away like disposable garbage, to be abused into 7-day a week labor while offfered only 1 hour a day to see their children, until that time when the nuns running the Abbey saw fit to sell the children to wealthy American families, well, that's stunning and horrifying.  The acting by Judi Dench as a simple Irish woman paired up with the Oxford-trained high-flying intellectual journalist played with mild condescension and simmering moral outrage by Steve Coogan is marvelous and delicious - their odd couple pairing, a rarity in our increasingly stratified societies, makes for great discomfort, humor and warmth.  Most touching is how Philomena, upon discovering the life that her son was able to experience in America - of high achievement and love - realizes that she could never have provided that kind of life for him, had she been able to escape the clutches of the Abbey with her boy.  This is a film that you will never feel bored by, with excellent pacing and truly heartfelt moments made all the more poignant by the reality of their historically happening. See it and you'll undoubtedly love it.",1398470400,,1741,4.79

5813003,5,B00DHJSXLY,"My wife & I loved this movie, Philomena. We also liked Captain Phillips. We had no use for Silver Linings Playbook and stopped watching it half way through it. Also I did not care a bit for The Wolf of Wall Street. It is a vulgar mess. Instead watch Animal House which is risque but also is very funny! Also Wolf is way tooo long! Strongly recommend watching Philomena. As per usual Judi Dench does a ""phenomenal"" job. As with most Brit flicks, it starts slowly but has great rewards for those who stick with it. Enjoy!",1398384000,,519,4.360824742268041
5813004,4,B00DHJSXLY,A very sad but heartwarming movie.based on a true story so you don't know how much is made supposed to make the film better. The nuns pictured in this film were about as mean and unhelpful as they could be.the movie was worth renting but I'm glad I didn't see it at the theatre !,1398384000,,279,4.090909090909091

5813009,5,B00DHJSXLY,"I thought this was a heart-warming, funny, yet tragic true story.  While other reviewers have felt it was a negative statement about faith, and the Catholic church, I did not see it as that.  Philomena and her child were treated in a terrible manner by the church but she does not lose her faith.  The story of Philomena's  journey is priceless as is her humor and insight. Good movie to watch, much to be  said about a mother's never-ending love.",1398384000,,447,4.5375
5813010,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Judi Dench and Steve Coogan gave ""OSCAR"" AWARD performances. This is a  true-to life portrait of a heart-wrenching story of the result of an out-of -wedlock pregnancy in post-war Ireland.

5813016,5,B00DHJSXLY,The script and performances here are first rate.  I was unaware of the extensive commandeering and sale of the children of unmarried Irish Catholic women in the 50's snd 60's that is so poignantly depicted here.  Another mark against the Church Into which I was born.  And the Sisters!  How could anyone concoct such uncaring and mercernary women?,1398297600,,347,4.931034482758621
5813017,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Dame Judi Dench is a gifted actress. I have watched her on PBS. This story was so sad and the ending floored me. I recommend
watching it over and over. What she went through to find her son and how the nuns treated her was shameful. The dried-up biddies
put her through hell. She is phenomenal in this movie.",1398297600,,308,4.237288135593221
5813018,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Judi Dench is wonderful.  The movie is based on a true story and people should see this so they know how young women were treated for becoming pregnant out of wedlock.  Just let me see another side of the Catholic Church exposing more corruption, but this time the priests were not the only ones to blame.  The nuns as well.  A must see movie.",1398297600,,343,4.3125

5813021,5,B00DHJSXLY,Unfortunately I understand Philomena's loss and hunger for answers.  The movie was thoughtfully presented - delicate subject - with life impacting results.,1398297600,,155,6.045454545454546
5813022,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Well done. Unlike some of the other viewers, I did not find this story a condemnation of the Catholic church. I think it does a beautiful job of representing the facts as they were and leaving it up to the viewer to make up his own mind. You clearly see the impact of forgiveness vs. anger in the end. So, I wouldn't stay away thinking that it's going to be about church bashing. It's a sad story that has a happy ending because Philomena is a remarkable woman. She took many positive things from it. That could be a lesson to many of us if we only choose to see it that way.

I highly recommend this movie for the beautiful acting and realistic storytelling.",1398297600,,659,4.272
5813023,5,B00DHJSXLY,Wonderfully directed and beautifully acted!! Judi Dench was magnificent and delivered a touching performance.  Steve Coogan was charmingly grumpy and also delivered a stellar performance.  Enjoyed the emotional journey from beginning to end.

I was able to relate to this film because, many years ago, my family also had to arrange a new life for one of their children.  I cannot imagine the trauma or anguish suffered by so many women at the hands of misguided, religious zealots.  When I see a movie I want to learn something from it.  In this case one clearly felt a great deal of compassion and admired the strength of this aging and delightful Irish woman who desperately needed to open a door towards the end of her life.",1398211200,,583,4.087719298245614

5813057,4,B00DHJSXLY,"A lovely movie about a tragic circumstance.  Steve Coogan was a surprise as the stuffy, slightly self-important journalist who becomes personally changed by the pain and longing of a woman searching for her child that was taken from her.  Judi Dench, as always, was pitch perfect.",1398211200,,280,5.065217391304348

For those who are likewise unfamiliar with the plot, don't go hunting down a synopsis, just buy it, rent it, stream it or whatever. You will not regret it. There is never a single dull moment.

I will say that just when you think the plot has reached a new climatic limit, a new surprise is revealed, and another and another. I'm not an especially religious person, but this true story seems to have been written in the stars. It's a simple story, but has moved me more than any other film in a long time.

5813098,4,B00DHJSXLY,"Being based on a true story, it was fascinating. Some may not like the fact that it showed the Catholic church in a bad light, but on the other hand, it showed how Philomena did not resent God nor the church overall. This was very positive I thought in light of other  movies and their portrayal of God. It was a slow movie when you compare it to most others. Yet, this is what it had to be taking into consideration the content and the message. We enjoyed the positive attitude and the graciousness of Philomena. It was a breath of fresh air compared to most other protaganists in many films.",1398124800,,593,4.342342342342342

Judi Densch is fabulous as a devout woman who looks beyond the harsh and unforgiving doctrine of her church to God for redemption and healing.  The human relationships in this movie are portrayed as quietly dignified and  the characters animated by love.  Highly recommended.,1398124800,,318,5.0576923076923075

5813102,3,B00DHJSXLY,Thought it was a decent film. I didn't particularly care for the way they portrayed the Catholic Church. Of course that is the way the secular film makers do it. It was a good story though. I am glad she was able to forgive - that is the Catholic Christian way.  It should have been rated R with the language used.,1398124800,,314,4.147540983606557

5813113,5,B00DHJSXLY,Judi Densch is always amazing in her honest and subtle skill to become a character and she is amazing as Philomena.  The movie is fictionalized but keeps the truth of the sad story of her son taken from her and given away to an American family by the cruelty of a convent in England.,1398124800,,283,4.2407407407407405

5813116,4,B00DHJSXLY,This was a poignant and bittersweet movie that was more about the grace and character of a simple Irish woman than it was about the cruelty of the Irish Catholic Church and deeds done in the name of Christianity. Judy Dench is superb in this character. Its about dealing with grief but also about redemption and forgiveness. Great flick!,1398124800,,337,4.728813559322034
5813117,4,B00DHJSXLY,"But the transmissions from Amazon kept stopping for about 15 seconds throughout the movie which was a little disconcerting.

5813133,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Deeply moving film, the hypocrisy and meanness of the Nuns was portrayed with passion.  The selling of babies was repugnant.  The relationship of the two protagonists matured during the film.  Judi Dench was outstanding.",1398124800,,220,5.411764705882353

5813159,5,B00DHJSXLY,I would recommend this movie to mature adults of any age.  The acting is superb--both Judy Dench and Steve Coogan are very good.  The story of the Dench character's search for her son brings to mind questions about parent-child relationships and also questions about personal faith.  The Catholic clergy here bear close examination.  The movie is not just about the search but also about the Coogan character's development and the relationship of the main characters.,1398038400,,467,5.1866666666666665

5813175,3,B00DHJSXLY,First rate acting can't rescue this film from a mediocre script. Apart from a notable moments (and fine acting) this was no better than a made for television movie.,1398038400,3,164,4.689655172413793
5813176,5,B00DHJSXLY,A movie that has a lot of food for thought.  How culture changes are huge in less than a century.  A nice feeling to see a true friendship develop between the two main stars in spite of their age differences.  A respect for each other in spite of their differences.  A lesson to be learned for us all.,1398038400,,301,4.137931034482759

5813193,5,B00DHJSXLY,I thought the movie was very classic in regards to the problems of any large organization trying to do good work with results that can be mixed and unexpected.

5813198,5,B00DHJSXLY,This is a story which shows how strong the mother child bond really is.  It also is just one more example of the real downside to the Catholic church and the cruelty it contains within many of its clergy; this time nuns instead of priests.  I am glad I knew nothing about the story before I saw it because that would have taken away from my enjoyment of it.  Judi Dench is brilliant and Steve Coogan is excellent in his supporting role.  F.

5813199,5,B00DHJSXLY,A profoundly sad story that does not reflect well on that particular group of nuns. The sadness of the story is amplified by the failure of those nuns to provide love and understanding.,1398038400,,185,4.636363636363637
5813200,1,B00DHJSXLY,"This show held some promise: actors were interesting personalities; the hunt to see a ""lost"" child was purposeful; the relationships between the characters were realistic. But then the movie had to disrupt it's great story line with  the unmerciful dribble of God is out, church doesn't really provide for a person's faith (confession is in vain), and Republicans (and Regan especially) are moral police trying to take away everyone's rights. Foreign films should just stick with their own country's nastiness and refrain from making jabs at ours. It's so one-sided and perplexing when you are engaged in a movie with a story that might have some merit.",1398038400,12,653,5.102803738317757

5813206,2,B00DHJSXLY,The acting was good but much of the emotion was overplayed and did not appear real for a supposedly real story.

5813227,5,B00DHJSXLY,"A lovely and gentle tale about the enduring power of love and the importance of forgiveness.

When sophisticated and cynical journalist, Martin, loses his job, he is approached by the grown daughter of Philomena Lee. Philomena, fifty years earlier was forced to give up her four year old son to comparatively rich Americans who in collusion with the Irish government and the Catholic charities literally bought the children of unwed mothers.

Philomena gave birth under harsh circumstances then was mercilessly worked to pay her 'debt' to the Sisters in their laundries for four years. Though never given a chance to say goodby to her son or even told that he would be adopted, she has never forgotten him or stopped trying to find him.

Her worries are endless--is he homeless, a drug addict, did he die in Viet Nam -and most hilariously--is he obese?--she's heard that is an enormous problem in America due to portion sizes. Her worries are both unfounded and very real--her son had done very well in life, was loved  but died young. In the interim, he tried to find her as well, and asked to be buried in the churchyard of the place he was adopted from.

How Philomena reacts when she finds out about her son's life, the gentle lessons she teaches Martin, and her enduring love and ability to forgive are lovingly portrayed in this touching and often humorous story.",1397952000,4,1369,4.783898305084746

5813242,5,B00DHJSXLY,"I was unable to see this film locally when it was in theatrical release and have been waiting eagerly for it ever since it's many nominations in award season. First it is directed by Stephen Frears, whose work is always good, and secondly it stars Dame Judi Dench whom I love. It is the story of a recently fired cynical press secretary and journalist (played so well by Steve Coogan) who decides to do a human interest story about the Irish woman Philomena Lee at the prompting of her daughter. In yet another shameful chapter in the Catholic Churches recent past, Philomena (an unwed mother in fifties Ireland) is forced to work as unpaid slave labor and have her young child sold to Americans by hateful nuns wit the collusion of the church and her government (it is a true story!) Despite fifty years of searching for her boy with nothing but lies from the convent in which she was held, Philomena still has hope. It is in playing Philomena that Dame Dench excels. She is completely without guile, and her faith remains unshaken. She can almost seem to be naive to Matin the journalist, but she never is. The two go on a road trip to America in search of her boy, and act as a brilliant comedic pair, with tragedy and comedy a balanced pair. Philomena Lee and her real life story will enrich and entertain.",1397952000,,1310,4.508403361344538

5813244,3,B00DHJSXLY,"The movie is entertaining but inevitably falls prey to Hollywoods aboslute desire to weave politics into the drama. Most viewers who are by now so steeped in the untruths through years of public school and mainstream media indoctrination will not even question the remarks regarding the main characters son and the suggestion that the Reagan administration decreased funding to AIDS, Hollywood never lets the truth get in the way of it's own depiction of event. While President Reagan's critics are free to argue that he should have done more about AIDS, and perhaps he should have, the fact that total federal HIV/AIDS expenditures grew from $0 to $5.727 billion on his watch belies the notion that he ""did nothing"" about this vicious disease. ""Whatever else it is,"" Reagan wrote, ""homosexuality is not a contagious disease like the measles. Prevailing scientific opinion is that an individual's sexuality is determined at a very early age and that a child's teachers do not really influence this."" He also argued: ""Since the measure does not restrict itself to the classroom, every aspect of a teacher's personal life could presumably come under suspicion. What constitutes 'advocacy' of homosexuality? Would public opposition to Proposition 6 by a teacher - should it pass - be considered advocacy?"" That November 7, Proposition 6 lost, 41.6 percent in favor to 58.4 percent against. Reagan's opposition is considered instrumental to its defeat. ""Despite the urging of some of his conservative supporters, he never made fighting homosexuality a cause,"" wrote Kenneth T. Walsh, former U.S. News and World Report White House correspondent, in his 1997 biography, Ronald Reagan. ""In the final analysis, Reagan felt that what people do in private is their own business, not the government's.""",1397865600,2,1791,5.265734265734266

Although this movie is a bit slow paced at times, it has an interesting enough true story at its heart that kept me interested all the way through.  Judi Dench does an exceptional job at playing Philomena, who remains remarkably cool considering all the frustrations she has in her journey.

Although the pacing is slow, Dench's acting and the story make up for it and makes this worth watching, if nothing else but for learning the tragic history of Irish adoptions.  A movie worth watching. 3.5 stars.",1397779200,,679,4.633333333333334

5813287,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Another film that really touches mature audiences. I'm 60+ and could really relate to both Philomena (Dame Judi Dench) and Martin (Steve Coogan.) Of course, being a GIANT fan of Judi Dench for years helps too. Dench is Philomena to perfection. Many have written about the story: Unwed Irish mother gets baby taken away for adoption by nuns. Philomena looks for him after 50 years. The story is the search, the flashbacks, and of course, the end results. Some of the flashback footage was REAL.

Having the DVD (I chose to wait, instead of doing the theater viewing) allows for a second viewing with actor/writer commentary, and special features like a 9 min interview with Dench; 3 minutes meeting the real Philomena; and 25 min of Q&A with Steve Coogan who not only acted Martin's part, but was writer and producer, not to mention the driving force to get this project started. He did more, but is unaccredited for the extra touches. The film was nominated (40) profusely and captured some wins (23) with the acting of Judi Dench, the writing adaptation, and music.

This is more than just a film. There is substance to the story. It is real life, the good and the ugly, depicted in ways charming, funny, and sad. Well worth the purchase price. An outstanding story that needs to be seen more than once.

I am not catholic; but what the Catholic church is supposed to do with pregnant teens whom families abandon them with limited or no resources in poor Ireland. I think that the Catholic Church try to deal with the situation the best way they knew how. Remember Philomina sign a consent to give her (knowingly gay son at the age of 3) for adoption so she knew what was coming yet the movie make you think that the boy was taken from her by those evil nuns. Those children that were adopted were given an opportunity for a better life. The only criticism I have for the Catholic Church did wrong was not allowing the dying son to meet his mother by withholding information; but that could easy be explain by understanding the legalese of the adoption process and the liability/risk of the Catholic Church if they release the information",1397779200,12,1181,4.467592592592593

5813323,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Directed by Stephen Frears (The Queen, Liam, High Fidelity, Dirty Pretty Things, My Beautiful Launderette, The Grifters, etc), with a screenplay by Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope based on the book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee by Martin Sixsmith and with a cast that features Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, this film was destined to be a success. If at times the story becomes a bit `Hallmarky' that flaw is quickly diminished because of the power of the story and the manner in which it was made.

Former BBC journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) is dismissed from the Labour Party in disgrace and is at a loss as to what do. His loathing for `human interest stories' is legendary, but that changes when a young Irish woman approaches him about a story of her mother, Philomena (Judi Dench), who when she fell pregnant as a teenager in Ireland in 1952, was sent to the convent to be looked after as a fallen woman. She cared for her baby for three years until the Church took him from her and sold him, like countless others, to America for adoption. Coerced into signing a document promising never to attempt to see her child again, she nonetheless spent the next fifty years secretly searching for him, unaware that he was searching for her from across the Atlantic. Suddenly struck by the strength of the story Martin arranges a magazine assignment about her search for Anthony that eventually leads to America. Along the way, Martin and Philomena discover as much about each other as about her son's fate. Furthermore, both find their basic beliefs challenged.

There are many fascinating aspects to the story and the manner in which it ends but to share those would destroy the film for other viewers. Love conquers all and there is something in the genes that never lets go. Dench, Coogan, and Cathy Belton deserve special kudos but he cast that includes such non-verbal roles as Sean Mahon, and the bit parts by Peter Hermann, Mare Winningham, Sophie Kennedy Clarke, and Barbara Jefford add immensely to this sensitive film.

Judi Dench is wonderful in the role of Philomena, and Steve Coogan as himself is quite good. This is far from a ""hatchet job"", as both sides are well presented, and the story unfolds slowly and carefully.

2. No doubt there were some very cruel nuns. I was somewhat of a victim myself. But if movies slammed all religion's faults equally the way they continually and vehemently slam Catholicism, then I might have given this a better rating for being fair. But then again, Catholicism is the only religion the media can get away with being vile to. That's called cowardice, not empowerment.

3. It doesn't matter to me what political party a person is from, but when one side is continually blamed for all the horrors brought to us on earth, I suddenly start to realize that the message by the filmmakers is not for people to think about certain subjects, but an agenda.

5813350,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Philomena was one of the most overlooked and under publicized movies nominated for best picture at the oscars this year, but certainly one of the best. The film is about the true story of Philomena Lee, who after getting pregnant out of wedlock, is abandoned by her shamed family to work in a Convent with other young Irish women in the 1950's. Long story short, her child is wrongfully taken from her by the nuns at the abbey and put up for adoption. Fast forward 50 years, and we have Judi Dench's Philomena, who is still searching for her son. Events pair her with a disgraced journalist, Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan), who sets out with her to locate her son. I won't divulge any more than this, for fear of spoilers. The story is an intriguing mystery that slowly unravels throughout the film. Philomena is a movie that gradually reveals itself to be more then it seems, starting out as a seemingly simple and formulaic road trip buddy comedy, and slowly forming itself to be the thoughtful, contemplative story that it is. The writing is excellent, using dialogue driven scenes to develop the two main characters, both of whom have differing beliefs and worldviews. They disagree often, and these scenes are both amusing and thought provoking. The film is very fair in that it doesn't take sides, but is nonetheless honest and pointed. The performances are perfect, with Judi Dench being the standout. Normally she plays very strong, dignified characters, so it was interesting to see her play such a naive, modest, and optimistic character. She is the beating heart of the film. Steve Coogan is very good as well, playing his character with snarky appeal and biting cynicism.

In the hands of a different group of people, this movie would have been insufferable and overly sentimental. This is very difficult material, and it would have been very easy to demonize the Catholic Church for the self righteous cruelty they visited upon these young girls, of whom Philomena is one of many. Likewise, it would have also been easy to make this a preachy and weepy film about the power of forgiveness. But thanks to the competent direction of Stephen Frears, the excellent writing, and knockout performances from Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, Philomena not only overcomes these obstacles, but transcends them. It goes without saying that this is a moving film, but not in a manipulative way. This is genuinely powerful drama on an intimate level.

The duality of the religious, yet sweet and realistic nurse combining forces with the agnostic or atheist, cynical journalist is a pairing to remember. I would truly be friends with someone like Philomena, someone who lives in the grays.

5813354,5,B00DHJSXLY,"I was surprised that this movie made the list of Best Picture Nominees for the Oscars. It was certainly an outstanding and well made film. But this sort of quiet movie rarely makes the cut to the nomination list. As others have said, it's based on a true story, beginning with the birth of a boy to an unwed girl, Philomena, in an Irish institution run by questionable nuns. What the nuns do is unconscionable and unbelievably cruel, both when the boy is a toddler and later when the boy is a man. You could almost say that what they did is downright evil..  I admit I cried during the movie. It was hard not to. As a woman, I could relate to Philomena. But I also laughed. There's quite a bit of humor in the movie. Judi Dench is superb. Steve Coogan is awesome in this film. He strikes the right note between being superficially caring and being overly sentimental. He shows a lot of emotion in his face and eyes. His heart truly breaks at one point.  (And he's not hard to look at, either.)

If you want to know more about the nuns' institution, you can do an internet search of the Magdalene Laundries. It's unbelievable what Ireland did to young (and older) girls and women for years, and for profit. An official report on the laundries and the involvement of many, including the government, in them was released not too long ago.

A tear jerker of a movie, for me. The end ...well, I felt anger and vengeance at the end. I won't tell you Philomena's viewpoint, so as not to spoil it for you.  I decided, however, that Philomena was, ironically, morally superior to the nuns.",1397520000,5,1580,4.415807560137457

5813357,4,B00DHJSXLY,"""Philomena"" is based on a true story about an Irish woman searching for the toddler son she gave up for adoption 50 years ago. She was forced to ""atone for her sins"", while the Catholic Church sold her son to Americans who paid a thousand pounds for her child. She was part of a group of young girls who were brought to a Catholic home run by brutal nuns who worked these women to the bone and sold their children.

 Dame Judi Dench, plays Philomena, who kept her secret for 50'years. She finally told her daughter, and her story was told to a journalist. Martin Sixsmith, played by Steve Coogan. Hectares on the task of finding the son, Anthony. They journey to the United States, in search, and this is Philomena's story. Philomena, a middle class woman, and Martin Sixsmith, who worked for the Government have different tastes and differing methods if finding the truth.

Philomena is a good soul, a strong Catholic, and Martin is a sarcastic, smug man. They clash, but quickly change their tone. This is a film that will cause many tears, but, is full of search and discovery and the times to face the truth. A lively film about a woman searching for her son, and all the while wondering if he ever thought of her.

The story was okay, not a happy tale, doesn't have a great ending, not a sad ending, but not a happy one either, so, just okay.
Parental Warning:
While there is no sex or nudity whatsoever, there are a couple of conversations about sex, and a rather innocent mention about a particular female body part (below the waist).
There is a scene of a man kissing another man, which is shown a number of times.
There are 4 'F' bombs....which is surprising for a PG-13 film. It used to be that nudity, sex OR more than 1 F-word would warrant an R rating. How times have changed. It's sad to think of what is becoming commonplace these days.",1397520000,5,808,4.357615894039735

A cynical political journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan), though initially reluctant to cover her story, decides to investigate what happened to the boy.

Philomena and Martin travel to the convent in Ireland, then to America, where something unexpected awaits them. Directed by Stephen Frears (The Queen), Philomena is not just about finding the truth about the heroines son; it is also a road movie where the two unlikely travelers go through psychological changes.

The process of finding the truth is a little slow, and so are the character developments of Philomena Lee and Martin Sixsmith. Most supporting characters are one-dimensional, but the credible portrayals of Philomena and Martin, rich in details, make up for that.",1397520000,,903,5.094594594594595

Martin Sixsmith (Coogan) has just been forced out of his political office and has no idea what to do next. When a woman tells him a story about how her mother Philomena (Dench) gave birth to a son who was taken away from her by the nuns in the convent she was living at. Philomena has never really had any contact with the son for her entire life. Martin approaches his former magazine with an idea of doing a story about the reunion between a mother and son. What starts off as a simple human interest piece becomes so much more. This movie will make you angry. I start off with that because no review I have seen starts with that statement. The unnecessary hardship that this sweet woman goes through because of how others feel about her situation will make you feel things that you don't think you ever could. The most amazing thing about her though is even though she is constantly facing disappointment and heartache she doesn't let it affect her. Martin is the voice of most people in the way that he becomes frustrated and angry to the point of almost saying and doing things he can't take back but you understand why. Philomena represents the kind of person we all want to be. The movie itself was good, a little slow moving but by the end you will be glad you stuck with it and watched it. That is if you still have a screen to watch it on, depending on what you find to throw. Overall, a good movie that will make you angry.

A lot of movies, even ""action"" movies have periods with lulls in them, but this film really kept my interest from end to end.

Some have said that this movie criticizes the Catholic church and there are absolutely policies that are questioned but the overall story is far from anti-Catholic, and Philomena's faith despite her adversity is truly inspiring, especially the way she is able to forgive.

One final note - for those of you who have only read the book on which this is based, this film has a much different feel.  It is not like they change the facts presented in the book, but in the book 90% of the focus is on her son's life while in the film 90% of it deals with Philomena's struggles in locating her son.

5813414,5,B00DHJSXLY,"PHILOMENA is a movie about closure.

Directed by Stephen Frears, it tells the true story of Philomena Lee (Judi Dench), a retired Irish nurse who goes looking for the out-of-wedlock son that she was coerced by Catholic nuns to give up for adoption fifty years earlier.  Helping in her search, which takes her to the United States, is British journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan), who begins his relationship with Philomena seeking a story, but winds up caring more about the woman hes writing about than the facts hes uncovered.

Coogan and Jeff Pope wrote the screenplay, adapted from a book by Sixsmith, which takes a surprising, disheartening turn at its midpoint, yet moves on to a more than satisfying conclusion.

Dench is magnificent as a woman who has kept her dark secret for half a century.  Indeed, some of her most effective scenes are without any dialogue whatsoever.  Coogan and Sophie Kennedy Clark, as the young Philomena, are also effective.

PHILOMENA, released on home video by Anchor Bay Entertainment, is a truly touching film that is not afraid to inject some humor into what is, essentially, a tragic story.

I don't think the Catholic Church will like this movie.

Extras on the Blu-Ray disc include feature commentary with Coogan and his screenwriting partner, Jeff Pope, an interview with Judi Dench, a Q&A with Coogan, and a look at the real Philomena Lee.

5813415,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Deeply movingThose two words perfectly reflect how I was feeling when I got out of the cinema where I watched the movie Philomena. This is about a woman Philomena who spent her whole life looking for the son she gave birth to when she was just a teenager, and who she had to give up for adoption because she was considered to be an unsuitable mother.
In my opinion, it is one of the best movies I have ever seen because it leads to a deep reflection on life but also on Catholic values at this time. Moreover, it might be useful to notice that the success of this film is mostly due to the great performances of both Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, whose complicity would not let anybody feel indifferent.
If I were to say which part of the film affected me the most, I would probably have difficulties to select one. However, I remember being really distraught at the moment when Philomena finally finds out that her son died before she could see him once again in her life. It might be hard to explain how I exactly felt at this moment, but I can still remember Philomenas reaction which was, if my memorys good, a mix of sadness and powerlessness.
To conclude, I would say that if you are looking for a movie which is full of emotions and which can lead you to a kind of meditation, you should definitely watch Philomena because it will certainly change your vision of life. To be honest, lots of my friends saw it and I don't know anyone of them who doesnt agree with the fact that Philomena is one of the best films made in the last decade.",1395187200,2,1542,4.302405498281787
5813416,4,B00DHJSXLY,"Philomena (Stephen Frears, 2013)

Stephen Frears, it has always seemed to me, and I rush to add for no reason I can quantify, has always struck me as being Mike Leigh's filmic little stepbrothernot nearly as well-known, laboring in the shadow etc. where this side of the pond is concerned, but vastly more talented and enjoyable a filmmaker. That has started changing over the past decade or so. Frears is a very good all-rounder, but there are certain aspects of filmmaking where he excels. One of those specifics is pulling the best possible performances out of every woman he puts on a screen. (If you've never, sit down with Frears' two 1987 features, Sammy and Rosie Get Laid and Prick Up Your Ears, both of which feature a young Frances Barber, for an object lesson on how an actor and a director can work together to create magic.) America stopped being able to brush Frears under the rug when he took one of the world's best actresses, had the hubris to cast her as Queen Elizabeth, and netted Helen Mirred a long-overdue Oscar for Best Actress. With seven years and six films in between them (including the critically-lauded Tamara Drewe and the equally critically reviled Lay the Favorite), it would be somewhat disingenuous to case Philomena as Frears' followup to The Queen, but once again, Frears has taken one of the world's greatest actressesand if there is an actress working today better than Judi Dench, I am entirely unaware of her existencestuck her in a role based on a real person, and scored a Best Actress Oscar nomination. (The film is also nominated for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Score.) This is Dench's fifth Best Actress nomination; she deserves it here more than she has since 2002's Iris.

Philomena Lee (Dench), as we open, is quietly mourning the fiftieth birthday of the son she hasn't known since he was a toddler; Lee, pregnant out of wedlock, was left by her family with the Magdalene nuns for four years after her pregnancy was discovered; the nuns raised money in part by selling the girls' babies to adoptive parents, usually from America (one minor character wryly notes that it was the Americans what had the money, in those days). Her daughter Jane (South Riding's Anna Maxwell Martin), who knew nothing of this story until that night, is waitressing at a party where she runs into disgraced former journalist Martin Sixsmith (What Maisie Knew's Steve Coogan), who's casting about for a story to get back into journalism; match made in heaven, no? At this point, the movie takes some turns into, essentially, comedic mystery, with Lee and Sixsmith attempting to track down Lee's son.

Both the movie's greatest strength and its defining weakness lie in Judi Dench. She has taken the role she was given and played it to the hilt; Philomena Lee herself, anecdotally, is said to have loved Dench's portrayal. (Dench, in an interview, said she was more nervous than she had ever been, since she was playing someone still alive.) The problem is, well, Philomena Lee. A great deal of the movie's comedy is of the uncomfortable kind, poking fun at Lee's working-class background and general lack of tact (there's a scene with a Mexican omelet chef in a hotel that's positively cringe-worthy) and playing the fish-out-of-water class-war aspect of the film a great deal more than was necessary. To me, at least, it had the effect of watering down the entire last half of the film; the first part is gut-wrenching, while the second is...not. Ironically, in the hands of a lesser actress, I don't think the difference would have been as severely noticeable.

A very good movie? Unquestionably. All it could have been? No, I don't believe so. *** ",1395100800,,3699,4.837282780410742
5813417,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) has lost his faith and worse, his job. While at a party he meets a woman who tells him of a human interest story. Martin claims they are for ""weak minded, vulnerable, ignorant people"" but agrees to do it anyway. Philomena (Judi Dench) is an old Irish woman of faith. As a teen, she was forced to give up her illegitimate child for adoption, God's punishment and her penitence for her carnal sin. After 50 years of silence she wants to go look for him.

Our odd couple teams up and discovers the church operated ""A Modest Proposal"" and sold off the children to rich American Catholics which leads them to the US.

The film has emotional ups and downs but they were not exceeding high or low. Judi Dench is an automatic 5 stars (sorry my prejudice) and gave us a believable performance of a woman who is coming to terms with her actions and faith. There is some religious discussion, but mostly on the role of the Catholic Church and how it conducted its business. Only light  theological discussions.

Martin initially sees Philomena as one of those weak minded people, but later discovers she has strengths he does not.

An excellent film that would have garnered more recognition had it come out in a different year.

5813418,4,B00DHJSXLY,"A bittersweet tale of a mothers search for a loved one from her past forms the core of Philomena, a real life semibiography of atonement and forgiveness amid ignorance and the passage of time.  As directed by Stephen Frears (The Queen, My Beautiful Laundrette) from a screenplay by Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope from Martin Sixsmiths book, The Lost Child of Philomena Lee, it features impressive acting and an affecting story.

Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) is an unemployed news writer in Britain who is searching for direction in his life.  At the same time, an elderly woman, Philomena Lee (Judi Dench), prays in church and commemorates an anniversary of the pain and loss of her illegitimate son. She recalls the distant memories of working at an abbey in Ireland and being forced to give her young boy for adoption.  Her plight makes its way to Sixsmith who at first is not interested in human interest stories, but Philomenas anguish kindles a curiosity within Sixsmith and eventually grows into a crusade that has the support of a publisher.  Stymied by false leads and lost records, Philomenas desperate search for her adult son leads to a revelation and the truth despite the dogmatic doctrines of a holy institution.

Simultaneously a love story of a mother for her child and an investigative mystery, this is essentially a two person play, in which Philomena and Martin are contrasts in personality and background-she has a navety about her while he is a born cynic.  That she must experience a full spectrum of emotions during her journey from shame to anticipation to despondency contrasts with Martins determination, anger, and frustration.

As expected, Dench (Skyfall, Notes on a Scandal) excels in the sensitive role of an older woman anxious to reconnect with her son. She even gets the nuances and behavior of a woman who has had a sheltered, broken life and lacks the sophistication and social graces of normalcy. This detail is nice texture to her character.  Like the sole photograph she has of her son, she clings to memories and hopes of redemption.  Coogan is quite convincing as the determined reporter, quite a contrast to his comedic roots in British television and film.

There is liberal use of flashbacks to show Philomenas life as a teenage girl.  Sometimes dredging old memories can cause great pain not only for Philomena, but for other people who hold clues to her sons whereabouts.  What become of him?  What kind of relationships and profession did he have in life?  And perhaps, most importantly, did he ever wonder about his birth mother?

The film shows how life can be a series of events punctuated by remarkable links and coincidences particularly in one revelatory moment that serves as a remarkable thread that binds the principals together.  Some antiquated themes recall the stigma of being an unmarried mother and the practice of adopting illegitimate children through the church.  In some ways this film is the flip side to The Cider House Rules.

It calls into question how much an institution like the Catholic Church may or may not have been  complicit in the knowledge or whereabouts of her son.  It seems too obvious to place responsibility and condemn the Catholic Church, the very foundation of faith, and its nuns as villains.  In fact you wish you could learn much more about the motives and thinking of the older nuns and countless other nameless victims that passed through the abbey; Philomena is but one story.  What about Philomenas life beyond the abbey? We see that she also has a grown daughter, and yet we don't have those details.

After all that has transpired, the detective work, and globetrotting from Europe to the United States, there is only the love between a mother and her son.  In the end, a mothers hope and a reporters quest become a heartfelt search for the truth, a truth born of love that transcends time.",1393632000,2,3886,4.878234398782344
5813419,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Based upon the book THE LOST CHILD OF PHILOMENA LEE by Martin Sixsmith, the movie PHILOMENA is a biopic about a woman named Philomena Lee (portrayed by the wonderful Dame Judy Dench) and the search for her long-lost son. Philomena is an older Irish woman who lives in England. One day she breaks down in front of her daughter, Jane (Anna Maxwell Martin) and reveals to her a secret that she has kept from the world most of her life: when she was a young girl she became pregnant out of wedlock and was forced to live in at the Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea. Sean Ross Abbey essentially was a Magdalene Asylum, an institution for young wayward woman that was run by nuns and the young women who were taken in there were basically treated as slaves who were forced to work out their penance. Philomenas child, a boy, was taken away from her and she has always wondered what happened to him. Philomena meets Martin Sixsmith (portrayed by Steve Coogan), a former journalist for the BBC who was recently sacked from his job as a government advisor. Sixsmith is desperately trying to find a new project to work on as he works on a book about Russian history. While at a party a friend of his suggests he do a human interest story. Jane happens to be at the party and suggests to Sixsmith that she has the perfect person for his story, her mother Philomena Lee. At first Sixsmith is against the idea, but he eventually agrees to at least meet Philomena and soon this most unlikely duo are off on a surprising and moving journey.

Other than knowing PHILOMENA had been nominated for a Best Picture Oscar and that it starred Judy Dench, I knew nothing about the movie before watching it. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The film is full of interesting little twists and turns and that in itself makes it an enjoyable film. However, what really makes it such a wonderful and charming movie are the performances of Dench and Coogan and how the play off of each other. Dench received an Academy Award nomination for her performance, but she and Coogan should have been nominated as a pair; Denchs performance would have been grand either way, but its made better by playing against Coogan.

Overall, PHILOMENA is a surprisingly delightful and highly engaging movie thats full of warmth and character. It tells a story worth telling and, if for no other reason, is worth watching for the chemistry between Judy Dench and Steve Coogan.",1393200000,6,2428,4.56651376146789
5813420,4,B00DHJSXLY,"I just finished reading Philomena, told primarily about Philomena's son, Michael/Anthony Lee, who was placed (""sold"") by Irish nuns to a family in the US when Michael/Anthony was a young toddler, following his life into adulthood. I feel the book poignantly expresses the serious prejudices held against young Irish women during this time, who were relegated to Irish Catholic orphanages to work as indentured inmates basically, giving birth to their children born out of wedlock and then taken away from them, the mothers being required to sign away all their rights to reconnect with their children forever. Conversely, the movie focuses on Philomena's life and perspectives and her attempts to find her son and to tell her story. I would like to seriously take issue with Kyle Smith, NY Post critic, for denigrating the author of the book, Michael Sixsmith, and the author of the screenplay of Philomena. It's too bad Al Gore has already used the Title, ""An Inconvenient Truth"" because Kyle Smith is simply exposing his prejudices in behalf of both Catholicism and Republicanism, which presents his views as an unreasoned voice: he's very upset (it's inconvenient) that someone might reveal the role of the Catholic Church for its role in this whole affair, shaming Irish girls for becoming pregnant and treating them like sinners and lepers. The book further shines a light on the Republican Party's awareness of gays during this time and the party's abhorrence toward educating the public about AIDS. Mr. Smith does not really do anyone favors for being an apologist for the Catholic Church and the Republican Party during these years. There is simply no excuse for either group to have been so cruel and abusive toward women and gays. Kyle Smith needs to develop some major compassion, considerably more tolerance, and an attitude toward ""values"" himself before he judges others. Really, it's too bad Smith can't undergo the sort of prejudice himself that Philomena and all the other young women experienced (check out The Magdaline Sisters). As it stands, he just comes across as morally judgmental, intellectually challenged, and compassionately deficient.

PHILOMENA is a fine comedy about some very serious issues, a smart film that evokes all sorts of emotions. It also has the advantage of being closely based on a true story involving some fairly prominent political figures. While it may not have the heavily dramatic twists and turns that many desire, there is well-earned surprise and revelation here. Judi Dench is her usual great in the lead role, and Steven Coogan is also most convincing as Martin Sixsmith, a tabloid journalist who discovers that ""silly human interest stories"" for ""weak-minded"" people can involve matters that any intelligent person should care about. Outstanding acting by many of the supporting cast as well, a wonderfully rich script, and expert cinematography that gives us some stunning views of rural Ireland.

There is an interesting mesh of somber, often disturbing back-story of Philomena's adolescence and pregnancy in an Irish orphanage during the 1950s and more upbeat yet moving front-story of her search for the son she hasn't seen in 50 years. The storyline is amazingly well-put-together: Even the apparently irrelevant comic asides relate to the story in a meaningful way.

Note: I agree with another reviewer who stated that the cover photo for this film is VERY misleading as to PHILOMENA's atmosphere and general content.",1392422400,9,1327,5.191588785046729

5813432,5,B00DHJSXLY,"""Philomena"" has already won multiple awards at the Toronto International Film Festival and the Venice Film Festival this year, and created tons of critical buzz in the process. Judi Dench and Steve Coogan have been praised for their fantastic performances, and deservingly so. Not only is this one of the most fun and interesting movies of the year, it also managed to surprise me in every way imaginable.

The film centers on Philomena (Judi Dench), a woman whose son was taken away from her decades ago after she became pregnant and was forced to live in a convent. Martin (Steve Coogan), a struggling journalist, gets wind of her story and decides to help her search for her long-lost son. Their journey together is fascinating, with a fantastic balance of comedy and drama.

With breathtaking cinematography, and Oscar-worthy performances from the leads, I couldn't recommend this film enough. Rated PG-13 for language, ""Philomena"" is a wonderful movie experience.",1392163200,,968,5.159235668789809
5813433,1,B00DHJSXLY,"The lies told about the film Philomena, never stop. Steve Coogan, who did the screenplay adaptation, and is one of the producers, appeared on MSNBC today to discuss the movie.

Richard Liu, the host, said at one point, And you're talking about a group of girls and women, out-of-wedlock, having children in these institutions [homes run by nuns for troubled young women], and their children were taken away from them.

This is a lie: the nuns did not walk the streets of Ireland seeking to rob kids from their mothers. In the case of Philomena, her father took her to the nuns to care for the baby she could not provide for.

Coogan replied to Liu that the home was the only place that you could go to. He is correct about this: no one was kidnappedthe women came to the nuns voluntarily. Moreover, the alternative was the street. Lucky for Philomena, her father placed her with the nunsthe same nuns who found her a job after her baby was born.

Coogan said these women were effectively incarcerated against their will. This is a lie: no one was incarcerated; Philomena did not live in a jail cell. The word effectively is interesting: either they were imprisoned or they were not. Coogan also says their children were forcibly adopted. This is another lie: Philomena signed a contract when she was 22. No one forced her to give up her baby.

Liu asks, And then [the nuns] prevented [the women] from finding their children. Coogan says that in Philomenas case, she was obstructed at every turn by both the government and the Church. Two more lies: the Church didn't stop anyone, and Philomena never set foot in the U.S. until last year; this was long after her son died of AIDS. Contrary to what the film contends, she never looked for her son in the U.S.

The parallels between this and ""Kathy's Story"" (which also duped the gullible) are noteworthy. As they are with the nonsense about the Magdalene Laundries (see the equally ridiculous ""Magdalene Sisters"", 2002), which was debunked by last year's McAleese report. Even the anti-Catholic bigoted Irish Times was forced to admit: ""There is no escaping the fact that the [McAleese] report jars with popular perceptions."" In other words, those popular perceptions are founded on lies. Just like ""Philomena."" These Irish sob stories are becoming so boring. They belong in the ""misery literature"" genre, under Fiction.",1392163200,32,2368,4.805896805896806
5813434,4,B00DHJSXLY,"There is never smoke without fire and given the many atrocities perpetrated by members of the Catholic Church which have finally been exposed, investigated and acknowledged by the Vatican, this was not a glowing coal, but a raging inferno. The Catholic Church in particular has come under fire for its cruelty, perversion and cover-ups, but is not unique in warranting castigation.

More horrors have been perpetrated in the name of ""religion"" than anything else. Such institutions were often vehicles for sick, bitter, misguided individuals exacting payback for past injustices, or giving vent to their perversions on ignorant and hapless victims, without fear of consequence.

Without deviating too far from religion in general or the Catholic Church in particlar, non-religious organizations that recruit followers are equally guilty, using their own twisted interpretation of faith or atheism to exploit members of their communities. Sleepers (1996) is a case in point - there are numerous others.

The 2002 Magdalene Sisters film was a similar expos&eacute;, much broader than Philomena, which proved largely true, allowing the world a glimpse of the punitive conditions endured by inmates. Young fallen women (mostly teenage girls) were disowned by their families because of the ingrained stigma of illegitimacy drummed in by the church. It was an excellent movie, but compared to Philomena, comes across as more heavy handed and shocking. Philomena has it's light moments, leaving one uplifted rather than depressed. In many ways, it is more about the system and narrow mindedness of the families who abandoned their daughters, than a pure assassination on the Catholic Church.

Forced to sign disclaimers relinquishing rights to their children, years of indentured servitude were imposed in return for taking in these girls.  They were forced to suffer inhumane, punitive conditions - 12 hour workdays, 7 days per week, with meagre food, clothing and shelter for mother and child, some institutions only only permitting 1 hour per day for mothers to be with their children. Albeit limited, this contact exacerbated the trauma of inevitable separation.

This generated income for the convent, while the nuns themselves did little physical work.  Adding another money spinner - adoption -  made these institutions highly profitable. The exact details may have been distorted for media sensationalism, but the truth is, it happened mostly as portrayed. Too many similar accounts from women all over Ireland who didn't know one another cannot all be shades of the same fabrication. Smoke with fire indeed. Feedback from inmates of previous Magdalene laundries have testified that the movie, The Magdalene Sisters was tame in comparison to reality.

As a poor, almost 3rd world country, dominated by the dogma of the Catholic Church, it is little wonder that mid-20th century Ireland's treatment of the dispossessed has been the focus of so much controversy. Unfortunately, these institutions had been meting out this type of treatment for hundred of years, in a time capsule devoid of modern enlightenment. Far from emancipating these women to move on and have meaningful lives after serving out their penance, they set out to break their spirit.

Without spoilers, Philomena based on the true story of Philomena Lee's desire to contact her son, born 50 years earlier, who was forcibly removed and put up for adoption. Due to Ireland's poverty, wealthy Americans were targeted to ""buy"" these superfluous children. Suitability as parents was not an issue, just the ability to pay.

Cynical and disillusioned Martin Sixsmith, recently misquoted and forcibly ""resigned"" from his position with the BBC, is not keen on assisting with this human interest project initally, but relents. The common thread between these two completely disparate individuals is their sense of injustice.

Philomena, a naive, motherless girl who spent most her childhood in an orphanage/convent, is then disowned by her father when she falls prey to a silver tongued seducer at a fair who impregnates her. We do not know if this was a one night stand, or whether he abandons her after discovering that she is pregnant. Her guilt at her sin is so deeply ingrained that she is not bitter, just sad and curious to find out what sort of life her son had, who he is and whether he ever thought of her and Ireland.

Sixsmith, who wrote the story (The Lost Child of Philomena Lee) and collaborated on the screenplay with Steve Coogan (who plays the role of Sixsmith) is leery of religion. His anger and frustration at the antipathy and continued cover-ups create a counterbalance to Philomena's unworldly viewpoints. Somewhere in the middle is the truth on faith. In the broad sense, is neither for nor against religion, but there is no doubt that an evil system was allowed to operate for so long.

Throughout the film, Philomena's simple unsophisticated, but straightforward character is grateful for any services that she receives from paid emploees such airport crew, hotel and restaurant staff, neatly juxtaposing Sixsmith's brusque manner. She is easily sidelined by the glib nuns at the convent. Sixsmith, an experienced tenacious journalist is not so easily put off, which ultimately leads to closure for Philomena.

No, it is not another boring attack on the Catholic Church. Yes, there has been some licence. Sister Hildegarde had actually passed on in 1995, nine years before Sixsmith got involved, but was included for 2 reasons.

1. It was not necessary to introduce more characters to clutter the story unnecessarily.
2.  By deviating from the truth to include Sister Hildegarde, their encounter was an embodiment of the narrow minded vituperative mindset of the time.

The current Mother Superior, Sister Clare is far more enlightened, a product of her time. She could never convey what the infirm Sister Hildegarde did with her brief moments onscreen. Sister Clare had to deny the accusations against the convent, taking the party line - what is her alternative?

This is not a happily ever after story. It's intimate, bittersweet and believable. Dame Judi Dench is consummate as ever as Philomena, as is Steve Coogan as Sixsmith, under the delicate direction of Stephen Frears. Oscar-worthy? Not quite. Despite winning a number of awards, there are more deserving offerings out there. Worth seeing - absolutely!

Trivia :
1.  Philomena Lee met Pope Francis, whom she feels has absolved her of the guilt that haunted her for so long. Of this, she said : ""I bet those nuns would be jealous now"".

2. On being interviewed about his choice of Judi Dench as Philomena, Steve Coogan, who is well known for his dry wit as a comedian and impersonator (particularly of the numerous James Bond characters), lightened the moment by recounting their first meeting at her home.

He said he was completely intimidated by the prospect and when she herself opened the door to receive him, he thought ""Oh my goodness, it's ""M""!"" (Forgive the possible misquote - I cannot find the exact wording anymore). However, On set, Judi put him at his ease, asking him to do Bond impersonations. The ease with which they interacted off-screen enhanced their on-screen chemistry considerably.",1391817600,5,7250,5.188356164383562
5813435,4,B00DHJSXLY,"I don't have anything against Catholics, but it's difficult for me, at this point in my life, to have sympathy for the Catholic Church at all, despite the fact that I think the new Pope is pretty cool. The history of the Catholic Church is so full of injustices done for the ""good"" of people it makes it difficult to see any actual good. The fact that this stuff is still ongoing and that we are constantly finding out about new ways in which the Church covered up wrongs and, even, allowed them to keep happening is incredible to me. To paraphrase a line from Philomena, ""If Jesus was here, he'd tip the Church out of its wheelchair, and it wouldn't get up and walk!""

And, now, the spoiler warning!
That was it. The warning, I mean.

The movie is not about the Catholic Church while being about the Catholic Church. It's about a woman's search for her son, who was taken from her against her will and sold... by a nunnery. Because that's what they did with unwanted girls and their babies, wanted or not. Basically, young girls who had become pregnant and, therefore, an embarrassment to their families were given over to this particular convent as slaves. Seriously. They were held for a particular amount of time and made to work everyday unless they could buy their way out of it. Of course, they weren't paid for their work, and their families had abandoned them there, so they had no way of coming up with any money with which to purchase their freedom. They were also forced to sign away the rights to their babies, which were then sold, usually to Americans. It was horrid.

So... slavery and selling babies. Just par for the course for the Catholic Church, I guess. And, of course, after the fact, they lied to both the mothers and the children who were trying to reunite with each other. And burned all the records so that they could honestly say, ""the records all burned up in the great fire.""

I suppose I might be able to start getting over my ill feelings toward the Catholic Church if all of this stuff was in the past. If this was stuff the church used to do, but this stuff... this stuff just happened. It took an investigative reporter to uncover the truth of  this situation because they, the nuns and the church, were still busy lying about what had happened. And we continue to find out about things like this month after month. It makes it difficult to look at any good things the Catholic Church may have done.

Anyway...

Steve Coogan is amazing in this movie. He also co-wrote the script. I'm used to him playing comedic side characters of no real import, but he was completely convincing as Martin Sixsmith, the reporter who investigated the convent in order to help Philomena track down her son. I hope Coogan pursues more work of this nature, both writing and acting, because he was excellent.

As was Judi Dench, but that's to be expected. However, if you're used to her in more commanding roles, she may surprise you in this one as the somewhat-daft-and-possibly-not-always-quite-in-touch-with-things Philomena Lee. She was a pleasure to watch and deserves her nomination.

Philomena is a very good movie, certainly one of the best I have seen this year, so I can totally support its nomination. I don't think it's going to win, nor do I think it should, but it's not out of place on the list. And, now, I actually (more than) kind of want to read the book, The Lost Child of Philomena Lee, and, when you adapt a book into a movie (whether it's a true story or not), I think the highest achievement of the movie is that it makes you want to read the book. I'm not saying I will (because my TBR stack is huge), but I want to. Also, it's good to get more of this stuff from the Church out into the open and, hopefully, prompt them into some real change.",1391040000,11,3782,4.493449781659389
5813436,5,B00DHJSXLY,"I went to see Philomena with a bare outline of the story, expecting a story that would be very sad. Surprisingly, there is much humor in the film, anger about what had been done to Philomena with much understanding and forgiveness.

(spoils below)

The story of Philomena begins in Ireland in 1952 when she becomes pregnant as a teenager.  Although it is not shown in the film, her family puts her in a convent. At no time are we aware of any feelings on the part of her family toward her. Apparently, she was cast out because of her pregnancy. Philomena must work in the convent for four years, performing backbreaking labor in the convent laundry, seven days a week. Philomena has a son, who she names Anthony and the nuns force her to sign a document relinquishing her parental rights and agree to never attempt to contact her son. Anthony is adopted, along with a girl, by an American couple for a ten hefty fee of $1,000.

The story of the film is Philomens search for her son fifty years later. She is joined by journalist Martin Sixsmith, who has been forced to resign from his job.  Martin is looking for something to do and agrees to write a book about Philomenas quest to find her son. The humor of the film comes from the relationship between Martin and Philomena. She loved to read romance novels and recount the plots to Martin, who would is more into Shakespeare. For years, Philomena has visited the convent hoping that she could persuade the nuns to allow her to have the location of her son. The adoption records have been destroyed in a fire but as Martin discovers they were burned by the nuns themselves. The search for her son takes Philomena and Martin to Washington D. C. but, unknown to her, Philomenas son has been searching for her.

(end of spoilers)

Comedian Steve Coogan is the driving force behind the film, having read the book by Martin Sixsmith and realized the screen possibilities. Coogan co-authored the screen play with Sixsmith, as well as producing the film and is perfect in portraying Sixsmith on screen. Dame Judy Dench is wonderful as Philomena, portraying her as a strong and determined woman who is strong in her Catholic faith, remaining conflicted over being forced to give up her son. She truly becomes and not plays Philomena. The film is beautifully directed by Stephen Frears with some great cinematography.  When I saw the film, the audience was completely in awe of the film, and everyone sat quietly while the ending credits rolled.  Philomena is one of those films that one thinks about for a long time afterwards.",1390867200,3,2570,4.668141592920354
5813437,4,B00DHJSXLY,"Nine Things About the Movie Philomena

1. The movie poster for this film is one of the biggest misrepresentations of a movie Ive ever seen. It makes the movie seem like some kind of screwball road-movie-romantic-comedy for retired people. This is absolutely NOT what the movie is.

2. Based on a true story, this is a charming but heartbreaking comedy drama. Its also simultaneously heartwarming, but without being sappy or saccharine.

3. Its about a young troubled girl, Philomena, who goes to live with nuns in Ireland in the 1950s. But this is not The Sound of Music. Not by a long shot.

4. Philomena is pregnant, and she is one of thousands of pregnant girls who work in convents almost as slaves, while the nuns sell the children.

5. As an older woman, Philomena decides she wants to find the son that the nuns took from her and sold to rich Americans. She teams up with Martin, an unemployed journalist, to help her solve the mystery.

6. What Philomena discovers gives proof to the old saying Truth is stranger than fiction.

7. Martin is an atheist, and Philomena is a devout Catholic. They have strong words for each other at different stages of their quest. Its a fascinating partnership, and give an extra layer of depth to an already interesting story.

8. Im used to seeing Judy Dench play smart, strong female characters. Its pretty shocking to see her play such a timid, simple, religious woman going far out of her comfort zone to look for her son.

9. The movie is very critical of the Catholic Church, and rightfully so. The book that the movie is based on uncovered some very cruel and hypocritical activities of the Church in Ireland.",1390521600,9,1657,4.647260273972603

5813449,4,B00DHJSXLY,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

Based on the true story of Philomena Lee who lost her child to adoption (sold like property to rich Americans) as an unwed teen.  Philomena played with unusual wit and character by Judi Dench, has been searching for the boy she named Anthony for decades.  Her return to the Irish Catholic home for girls has been met with stonewalled rejection.  Philomena's daughter, serving as a waiter at a social gathering meets Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan, who also co-wrote the screenplay), a recently ""sacked"" political press aid.  He's looking for work and is eventually convinced that he would lower himself to write a human interest story, a genre he loathes.

Eventually the odd couple (Martin and Philomena) travel to Washington, D. C. where they believe they will have better luck finding the boy, who now would be a middle aged man.  Martin, using some connections and some very cool software find the man now named Michael (Sean Mahon in home movies) who is now deceased.  It turns out he was a highly placed attorney in the Reagan and Bush administrations.

Directed with a light touch by Stephen Frears, the movie is guaranteed to produce a tear or two, but not by manipulating the audience with swelling violins or overly distraught characters.  In fact, Dench keeps the character's emotions in check for the most part.  At the same time the pain is clearly visable in her eyes and gestures.  A great piece of acting.

Coogan is also underrated as a dramatic actor and for the most part plays Sixsmith as a cold, calculating cynical investigative reporter.  At the same time his humor is always on the cusp.  Sixsmith is a non-believing lapsed Catholic and Philomena is a God fearing regular which creates some humorous byplay between the two.  This is an Oscar worthy film that moves along briskly coming in at 98 minutes and while there is a melancholy theme, it plays honestly without a bit of saccharin.",1390176000,2,1954,4.837349397590361

5813451,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Perhaps the most profound movie I've seen this year.

Remember this is based on a true story. And remember Judi Dench is well regarded for portraying ""real people"" with authenticity...true to the person. So when I realized that through out this journey Dench's Philomena did not allow herself to get caught up in anyone else's issues or agendas, I was riveted to what I was learning about forgiveness - compassion - and transcendent love that takes a mother beyond the temptations of anger that would weaken her resolve and distract her from her path to reunion. Her single-mindedness penetrates to a purity of heart that humbled me... there was only one thing that mattered... finding her child. Clearly, Dench's Philomena had been preparing her heart for 50 years for reunion.  From the moment Philomena reveals to her daughter the photograph of her son.... everyone has an opinion and employs their powers of persuasion... either to pursue her intention or to abandon it. The focus of the reunion wasn't about what Philomena would gain, or achieve from the reunion -- the reunion was the fruit of her love for her child.  She wasn't about  settling scores.... nor punishing anyone - not even herself.  She didn't allow anyone's anger and rage to penetrate her tranquility of spirit... her peace....  THESE qualities --- what Philomena brought in her heart for the journey of reunion --- these serve as a model for anyone considering a reunion.

Don't be distracted by who helps and who deters ... focus on how centered Philomena stays. Pure Grace! It would be a mistake to focus on what she did and miss how she did it. She did it with a purity of heart, and a peace that could not be uprooted by anyone. And she even avoided the trap of trying to change the opinions of others. She let her love bear witness.  I was deeply aware of how far I was from staying at peace in such combative circumstances! Tilting at windmills and getting distracted by my own brokenness. So... this is what the Beatitudes look like when lived in everyday life.  The film is a primer... for anyone yearning for a reunion of any type... and it is one of the most profound witnesses to the truth of the Beatitudes.",1388620800,24,2194,4.692708333333333

5813453,2,B00DHJSXLY,"No doubt, this somewhat fictionalized version of a true story is an engaging cinematic experience.

Problem is that it leaves the impression that the Irish nuns were solely cruel and insensitive. Investigative reporting by Britian's The Guardian uncovered a different history from the screenplay. I quote an article from 11/11/13.

""The Catholic Church doesn't come out of this story well however you slice it, but in the book its cruelty seems to be largely in the past [the 1950s - sixty years ago]. 'The nuns were lovely,' writes the real Sixsmith, after visiting Roscrea with Philomena. He describes the mother superior as 'a friendly, educated woman ... who had devoted her life to the care of disadvantaged and disabled people.' This doesn't come across at all in the film. Furthermore, the film-makers have resuscitated Sister Hildegarde (who in real life died in 1995 -- nearly 20 years ago, long BEFORE Sixsmith's visit) to act as the principal villain and embodiment of all the Catholic Church's most vicious tendencies. This makes for a dynamic and gripping screen story, but it's harsh on the real Sister Hildegarde. Judging by the book, she may well have been a tough old bird - but the film goes a good deal further, especially towards the end, and some modern Irish nuns have understandably been upset.

""In fact, responsibility for the Magdalene Laundries and the appalling privations they imposed on women and children is hardly limited to one person or even one institution. Following a long public campaign, the ***Irish government*** finally apologised for its role in the Magdalene system this year. Though the film version of Philomena might have picked unfairly on Hildegarde to be its [principal] villain, its fury and grief over what happened to the Magdalene victims is undoubtedly justified.

""Verdict:  Philomena is a captivating and deeply affecting account of one family's trauma, but it really has it in for nuns.""

Further, some additional context is important. In the 1950s Ireland was virtually a 3rd world country, and this held true into the 1970s. It had little of the social infrastructure that 21st century Ireland now has. Moreover, it was a poor country and poverty corrodes life and social institutions, even Catholic ones. Further, the sort of reforms that the Catholic Church needed were promulgated a decade after Philomena's experience, i.e. Vatican II, and these reforms are ongoing. Finally, in 1951 when Philomena encountered the nuns, the current Pope Francis was a 15 year old Argentinian janitor. He joined the Jesuits in 1958, when Philomena's son was 7. Francis is also three years younger than Philomena ---- AND --- he brushed aside the Vatican gatekeepers to give her (and Coogan!) an audience in Rome recently, for which she was grateful. I cite these statistics to give readers a sense of the great period of time we are dealing with and the big changes that have happened since 1951.

Some more context: socially engaged, issues-oriented films don't exist in a vacuum. Catholic spokesmen, lay AND religious, rightly point to a current climate of hostility to the Church from ""a media and academic culture that propagates skepticism and even cynicism regarding the message of the church,"" notes Rev. Robert P. Imbelli, professor of theology, Boston University. While the Catholic Church is due honest criticisms for its failures (priestly sexual abuse), this hostile culture doesn't stop at honest criticism. Philomena director Stephen Frears, a gifted filmmaker, is part of that hostile culture, and therefore Philmena is not an objective portrayal of the historical events he interprets in his film. It is an artistic work with a contemporary critical agenda -- projected from 1951 into 2013 -- a 60 year span. Many viewers express indignation at Philomena's hurtful treatment, but such indignation coming from 2013/14 is anachronistic -- imposing a contemporary ""enlightened view"" onto very different circumstances from 60 years ago. From the distance of time and space, this is an easy (and lazy) accusation to make.

So Albarino says, by all means, enjoy the film as engaged cinematic art, but keep in mind that it takes some liberties with the actual events, persons and their outcomes. And I do note that the cinematic Philomena appears more forgiving of the old church than Sixsmith -- but then he's a cynic and is played by one.",1387324800,48,4396,5.112813370473537

But, just when you think someone is preparing to wind down their career, a role comes along to prove you absolutely wrong.

Philomena, directed by Stephen Frears (The Queen, High Fidelity), stars Judi Dench as Philomena Lee, an elderly woman that reveals to her daughter how she had a child out of wedlock and gave her son, Anthony, up for adoption 50 years earlier. After years of searching for him and running into roadblocks, dumb luck leads Philomena to a down-on-his-luck former BBC reporter, Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan, who also serves as a producer and screenwriter with Jeff Pope). Reluctant at first to write a human interest story, Martin quickly agrees to help Philomena track down her son.

The film begins with Philomena as a young woman (presumably in or around 1952) in Ireland. She's out for the night at a carnival and meets a charming young man with whom she has a one night stand. A short time later, she's pregnant with nowhere to go, forcing her to give birth to her child at a small Irish convent. This particular convent takes in young pregnant girls and sells their child for profit  forcing (more like insisting) the mother to sign their rights to the child away. The convent finds parents that are looking to adopt (mainly in the United States), and for a sum, they sell them.

Philomena can still recall the day with clarity that she watched her child leave the convent, purchased by adoptive parents. Looking for information about the possible location of her child, Philomena and Martin return to the convent only to be informed such info is not available (allegedly it was destroyed in a fire). From there, Martin receives a tip that most of the children sold did in fact end up in the United States. Believing thats where Anthony was likely take, Martin encourages Philomena to join him on a trip to the United States.

Once in the United States, Martin arrives at more roadblocks, but finally discovers who and where Anthony has been since he left the convent all those years ago  information which he also shares with Philomena and his news editor. Hes put in a difficult situation due to the fact that hes contractually obligated to tell Philomenas story regardless of the outcome. After discovering her childs whereabouts, Philomena goes back and forth about whether to stay in the United States or return home. Initially, she wants to leave but ultimately decides to stay and dig deeper into the past of her son. Its an emotional journey, yet one that she's unwilling to give up on until she finds closure.

The film is based on real life events depicted in the book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee, written by Martin Sixsmith. While the book focuses more on the life of Anthony, the journey to find him makes for a wonderful story on film. If you imagine this movie being a typical tale where the mother has her son taken from her and years later is reunited with him  like most fairy tale endings, you should brace yourself for something much different and far more emotional. This film is full of twists, turns, and unexpected revelations that you usually don't find in films of this nature. Its almost like a breath of fresh air, even though the true story doesnt exactly leave you with a satisfying taste in your mouth.

As you might expect, Judy Dench is absolutely flawless in her execution as Philomena Lee. Her command of the various emotional swings is just superb  and proves without a shadow of a doubt that shes still one of the finest actresses on the planet. Age has no restriction because she continues to out due herself with every additional role that she adds to her already lengthy film resume. Dench portrays this character as someone that has made peace with the choices shes made in her life, yet that doesnt deter her desire for closure. There isn't a scene in this film that won't have you marveling in her mastery  especially in those scenes where she randomly goes on a tangent about her novels. For such a pointless scene, she sure does make it captivating.

Martin Sixsmith is a typical, business as usual type of character. After having just been fired from a high-end government position, he falls back into journalism. On several occasions he declares hes going to write a book on Russian history, so the fact that he takes the time for a random human interest story is a unique dynamic. Steve Coogan starts out with this character as someone thats simply trying to figure out the next chapter of his life  let alone get into human interest journalism. However, thats exactly what he does, and wholeheartedly, too. At no point does it feel like hes only servicing himself or his career. He becomes morally invested, a train that Coogan sells perfectly. While Coogan gives a notable performance, hes terribly overshadowed by Judi Dench.

The story and acting are both memorable, but this film also doesnt hesitate to take quite a few needless pot shots at religion and politics. Obviously, the fact that a convent basically sells off babies for a fee raises all sorts of red flags about the church in general  but something tells me that nasty message was conveyed quite well when Sixsmiths book hit shelves in 2009. Politics is also the subject of several timely insults, directly largely at Ronald Reagan and the Republican Party. Reagan takes a shot for reducing AIDS funding, while the Republican Party in general takes a whacking for being non-liberal (in this case anti-gay).

Overall, Philomena is a peace-of-mind story that aims to tell the truth more than provide a happy-go-lucky tone. This is a human interest piece though and through, meaning it intends to depict a series of events while still supplying information. Steve Coogan obviously has quite a bit invested in this film (literally) and will most likely be rewarded for it on more than one occasion (during award season). Judi Dench will also be in for quite a bit of attention after giving yet another career defining performance (and who would have thought that was possible given her already full list of incredible portrayals). The age gap for this film swings heavily towards older generations, plus British films rarely connect well in the United States (unless it's James Bond related)  so the film will be extremely handicapped. Nevertheless, the talent and unique plot line definitely makes Philomena one of the most impressively well-rounded bio pics of 2013.

I don't want to say any more, to avoid spoilers!  Don't miss this film!",1386288000,5,328,4.586206896551724
5813456,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Philomena is definitely  one of the best films of the year. Judi Dench does an incredible job in the part of Philomena. The film is an indictment of church, society, and government, but very absorbing to watch, follow,  and enjoy. This is a film made for grownups who like a well done story. The acting is flawless. Luckily I got to see this in the theatre. Judi Dench is simply riveting in the title role.",1386201600,3,406,4.4
5813457,5,B00DHJSXLY,"Despite the juiced-up facts and figures surrounding the real Philomena Lee's story, this movie is unforgettably rich with raw emotion and a gripping immediacy that feels utterly real.  Credit Judi Dench and director Stephen Frears for almost never going for the sentimental, and allowing this tragic, but ultimately redemptive, story unfold before our eyes - and certainly in our hearts.  I cannot remember the last time I felt the way I did in a movie theatre while watching this movie: I forgot entirely where I was, so completely absorbed into the people on the screen.  With each revelation, this movie earns its tears, and once again (think The Magdalene Sisters) shines a harsh light on those infamous Irish ""laundries"", attributing even more terrible sins to the pious nuns and priests who ran them.  Philomena, embodied by the glorious, infinitely watchable, utterly human Ms. Dench, emerges as a striking figure of compassion and forgiveness amid so much deceit and cruelty. Philomena will stay with you.",1386115200,23,1013,5.158536585365853

8593271,2,B00DHJSXLY,"I watched this on TV and found it very disappointing. Just another Poor Little Gay Victims film, in the end  - yet another one! The mother seeking the son she gave away for adoption years ago could have found any number of different sorts of men, but she had to find a homosexual who had died of AIDS, and then return tearfully to the convent where the wicked nuns had lied to both of them and kept them apart. The truth is that when AIDS appeared in the USA there were thousands of victims who got free health care in Catholic hospitals, run on charity, and there are still thousands of sufferers who get such free or subsidized treatment and care. We never get a film about that. The homosexuals are always presented as young, handsome, successful and monogamous (yeah, well, believe that if you like). The Catholic church in Ireland did its best to take children from single mothers who were struggling to care for them, and find adoptive parents who gave them a far better chance in life. Surely the vast majority of them have got a lot to be thankful for, and so have the parents who adopted them. I really winced when the mother said she knew the small boy was homosexual at the age of two, because he was ""sensitive"". That is total rubbish. Homosexuals are not more sensitive than other people. I could post on here some of the revolting things they are arrested for doing, but won't because the review might be removed as offensive!",1519603200,,1440,4.4961832061068705
