1688902,4,B0000639KS,"I recently caught this film on the Sci-Fi Channel, and I found it to be quite enjoyable. It is certainly better than some big budget science fiction films that I have seen (""Battlefield  Earth"" or ""Solaris"", anyone?). The cast of actors does an admirable job with the script, and the special effects are more than adequate.

The story line is pretty basic. A giant monolithic structure suddenly appears out of nowhere in Bhutan. The United States government immediately sends military personnel and scientists to Bhutan at the request of the local government. Meanwhile, China, the adjacent country wishes to do likewise, causing a conflict that will have a surprising outcome.

The monolithic structure appears to contain an alien force with technological capabilities far beyond that of anyone on earth. Mason (David Keith), an engineer suffering from an incurable terminal illness, has been taken under duress to Bhutan in order to try and ascertain the physical properties of the monolith, investigate its structure, and gain entry. Ryan O'Neal has a small part in which he plays the role of Mason's superior and appears to be a liaison with the military that wishes to take a more strident, aggressive role in the matter.

Mason, as do the others, eventually discovers that the alien force within the monolith appears to have healing powers far beyond anyone's imagination. This discovery does not prevent the United States government from making a knuckle-headed decision as to what to do with the monolith. Mason and a female scientist then try to right what went wrong. An intriguing outcome provides some food for thought, although much of what is touched upon in this film has been covered in other films.

For those who enjoy science fiction, it is certainly worth a rental.",1119657600,3,1785,5.057823129251701
1688903,3,B0000639KS,"Not half bad for a low budget DTV effort. I've seen worse (including the abysmal 'Deep Shock' also starring the wooden david keith) and of course, much better.

This one tells the tale of a massive structure rising from the bowels of the earth. It hovers in a desert where different groups vie to study its mysteries. Of course, theres the eternal man is to sick to live theme running through (ala The Day the Earth Stood Still and to a lesser extent 'The Abyss [extended version]). Still, Epoch is mildly enjoyable and I was thinking of what kind of movie this could have been with a more solid script and a bigger finacial backing. I think the devlin/emerich team behind Independence Day and Day After Tommorow could have made yet another end of the world hollywood pap trap with this material. Alas, there is no starpower or big studio to be found here. Instead the tale is brought to fruition by some outfit called UFO Films and features David Keith, the fallen Ryan O'Neil and an assortment of other B grade character actors (including Brian Thompson and his obligatory scenes of rage) I've seen elsewhere. The effects are steady but not spectacular. The storm scenes and sets were strong points whereas the rising of the monolith at the beggining of the film was an example of Godzilla like blue screen effort. In godzilla, its pricelss, here its not good.

The DVD itself is bare bones. No features other than a crappy trailer. The transfer is junk to with no clean up of the print and its not even displayed in its proper widescreen ratio. I just love when movies show us locations and time in the print at the bottom of the screen and the edges are chopped off.

Take Epoch for what it is and you may enjoy it. Go in looking for a big time hollywood effects blockbuster and be prepared to be let down.",1105833600,,1810,4.512195121951219
1688904,3,B0000639KS,"All the pieces are good. A Mysterious Object appears in central Asia. Our Hero is recruited (under duress) to analyze it. He has no special qualifications, except for being generally good at figuring things out. He tries desperately to do the job he was ordered to do, but the ever-present military does what the military usually seems to do: get confused, issue contradictory orders as a result, and get more confused. Governments do what governments do: squabble over who owns something that no human agency could possibly own.

The end of the world begins, Our Hero is destroyed at ground zero in a nuclear explosion, he recovers nicely, and we get a happy ending. The pieces are good, but come together as an ordinary story.

Parts of the movie have a recycled look. Roger Dean used mysterious inverted cones on album covers in the 1970s. The white-on-white inner sanctum imitates Kubrick's 2001 (also from the 70s). The inexplicable healing forces have appeared lots of places, the movie E.T. among them. Epoch's creators certainly have been rummaging around in the effects closet. The good news is that they had the sense to pull out and try on some respectable material.

It's a safe, watchable SF movie. There's not a lot of violence, and adult themes appear only as hints off screen. There are lots of better movies out there, but lots worse too.

1688905,1,B0000639KS,"Because I could not give it a lower score.

This Sci-Fi flick is a mystery. Some well very known stars, acting as if they were in a Woman's Club play. The plot is where this film falls apart. Trying to use too much symbolism makes it very hard to understand.

It has good cast, this is how I was fooled into watching this awful movie. Cast: David Keith, Shannon Lee, Ryan O'Neal, James Avery and Craig Wasson.",1092355200,,409,4.298701298701299
1688906,3,B0000639KS,"UFO LLC is not the film company to go to when you're looking for solid filmmaking or great writing. They're a company that thrives only on its special-effects rather than anything else. Yet for what it's worth, I found ""Epoch"" to be a very enjoyable movie where I didn't need to think for a bit. Compare it to ""Sphere"" and it seems like a sci-fi masterpiece! The story is not the usual large-monster horror film like UFO usually does. It's about an alien artifact that is found in Bhutan. The army is sent to investigate it. Many theories rise up and there are a few neat effects sequences. The movie never tries to rise above its own intelligence. It never once insults the intelligence of the viewer, and it never stretches anything out to a ridiculous length. The special effects are extraordinary, the best UFO has ever done. The story is simple enough, but not stupid. True, when you get right to it, it's another direct-to-video movie. But not once does it try to pretend its anything more. I liked it.",1051574400,21,1008,4.574585635359116
1688907,4,B0000639KS,"This isn't as bad a film as some critics make out. I have seen a lot worse and they had a bigger budget than this made for TV movie had. Does anyone remember ""Battlefield Earth""? Now that was a film that stank and sank! EPOCH on the other hand is an easy to watch, easy to understand movie that touches on areas that we all know and love.
The plot follows a group of investigators as they struggle to find out the truth behind a strange monolith that has appeared in the middle of nowhere in Bhutan. David Keith is a dying scientist who finds himself cured of a terminal illness after he enters the Monolith. Ryan O'Neil doesn't do too badly as his equally confused colleague trying to keep the Military under control whilst at the same time trying to understand what is happening. The much loved James Avery (from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air) gives a good performance as a military Doctor and the excellent James Hong is cuttingly sarcastic as Chinese Ambassador Po. Add to this a Colonel with a power complex, a Captain whose belief in God comes into conflict with his orders and you have a pretty good film.
The film's overall storyline is that the Monolith intends to ""wipe the slate clean and start all over again,"" because in a nutshell earth and its destructive human population isn't worthy of existing anymore. The Monolith is able to resequence DNA, hence David Keith's miraculous cure and the resurrection of two dead Chinese pilots and a Scientist.
Okay so the special effects aren't all that and a bag of chips, but even with a couple million dollars worth of special effects, ""Battlefield Earth"" still managed to honk louder than a gaggle geese in a farmyard!
It's not a terribly suspenseful film but it is watchable and not as bad as some people are making out. It certainly isn't cinema quality that is for sure then neither are a lot of movies that make it to the cinema and I don't see them getting panned in the same way. Make your own mind up about this movie, don't expect much other than a nice little movie that you can rent out when there is nothing else available. Like I said, it's not that bad.",1037232000,9,2121,4.469072164948454
1688908,1,B0000639KS,"Washed up, bloated, Ryan O'Neal is the star of this TV flick, so that should give you enough information to know just how bad ""Epoch"" is going to be.  Unfortunately, I bit anyway.  What a colossal waste of time.  The plot is transparent; the characters, unbelievably shallow, hackneyed and stock.  The actors? I've seen better acting in high school productions.  They deliver lines about as well as Ackroyd's Beldar from Saturday Night Live.  How the producers and directors could have put their names to this time waster is beyond me.  Don't be fooled by the cool production art on the DVD cover. This...is of such ""Epoch"" proportions the fact that it actually was released should be science fiction.  I feel like such a fool for having rented it to watch.",1028678400,3,757,4.769230769230769

1688956,2,B0000639KS,"(Spoilers.) This movie telegraphs its quality from the very beginning. The caption tells us that the alien artifact came to earth in 4 billion BC. That is your first warning that this movie was written by someone who didn't know WTF he was talking about, neither from the standpoint of science nor science fiction. The BC part is totally irrelevant, superfluous, and dim-bulbed. The 2000 years of the Common Era (or 2000 AD, if you prefer) is a mere 0.00005% of 4 billion years, so to speak of an occurrence in 4,000,000,000 BC is, for all intents and purposes, the same as 4 billion years ago ... period. No BC is needed. And, can anyone answer this question: if the artifact intended to terraform earth and wipe us ALL out (not just the humans), why did it heal people and bring them back from death? What's up with that? And if the artifact DECIDED to terraform earth and start all over again because it discovered we violent, aggressive humans are not what it intended to create, why did it use NATURAL SELECTION evolution as the mechanism by which we would climb up out of the primordial ooze? Natural selection can occasionally make use of cooperation (Win-Win) as a method of evolutionary advancement, but natural selection just as often (probably much MORE often) makes use of competition (Win-Lose, where someone wins and someone else loses) as the preeminent method of evolutionary advancement. Why would this advanced artifact expect the emergence of a peaceful species from what is essentially a violent process??? Dumb movie!

Clichs and caricatures abound. The one place where you'd think the continuity department would focus their efforts -- making sure the timer on the ticking bomb shows at least something close to the same countdown in each subsequent shot -- it looks like they decided to just head out early for happy hour instead. The military is portrayed as beyond goofball, effective for pushing the thin plot I suppose, but way past even the most generous suspension of disbelief.

The ""science"" in this sci-fi movie isn't even half-baked. Any sci-fi fan is used to granting a bit of credulity in the service of a good story, but all of the science-related elements in this movie come off more like the placeholders you'd find in a ST:TNG script. And in the end, the healing powers of the ""towering alien structure"" are apparently just an ironic side-effect, given the object's apparent true purpose. So why waste so much of the story-telling on that? (Oh, I know...because someone decided the movie wasn't long enough otherwise).

Not that the movie is without merit completely. Some of the special effects are entertaining to watch, there's a scene that could have been pretty funny involving some Mexican bandits and a surprise rescue (so, just imagine the well-done version as you're watching this one, and it's entertaining), there's 60 seconds or so of George Jones' ""Real Deal"", and David Keith's character Rand is given some funny lines.

Obviously love was the key, because that is what made it decide to leave the earth intact at the end. Oh and I forgot the nuke that detonates and then undetonates.

1689198,4,B0000639KS,"From reading many of the negative reviews, I can only think that some people have forgotten the concept of the classic ""B"" SF film.  I'm not familiar with the studio, but this movie could have proudly taken its place as the second feature of any drive-in in American history.

Sure the characters are stock:  wisecracking specialist and frosty-cool woman scientist, gung-ho military commander, craven bureaucrats.  But here they have motivations, and exhibit personality quirks, beyond the normal stock SF players.  The specialist has less than a year to live, which gives him little reason to behave (set up in a scene where he insults a truckload of Mexican highwaymen).  The NSA bureaucrats refuse to answer the Presidential hot line when it rings, instead making their most junior member take a message -- the next time he calls she immediately tells them ""I'm NOT answering that!""

This movie is an enjoyable time-killer.  You won't learn any fundamental truths of the universe or humankind, but since when did we start to expect this from every SF film?  Sometimes a giant mutated ant is just a giant mutated ant, and not necessarily a warning of the dangers of nuclear testing.  The Big Mysterious Object in this case, the ""Torus,"" has a satisfyingly mineral look to it, appropriate for a 4 billion year old chunk of the Earth's crust -- or meteorite implant.

1689208,3,B0000639KS,"This is an honest movie in the respect that it makes a valid attempt at trying a new direction in science fiction.  Not a wholly new direction, however.  We still have the ""alien intelligence from elsewhere"" controlling the levers of mankind's fate; we still have the mindless hut-hut army guys wanting to let rip with their automatic weapons; we still have the government attempts at a cover up; we still have the drop-dead, good-looking female PhD; and we still have the Nuclear Wipeout Option for wrapping up a situation that spirals out of control.

Other than those stereotypes and worn-out plot elements, the movie evinces a very strong creative urge to do something different in science fiction; namely, it tries to be intelligent and thoughtful.

Kubrick's Monolith reappears in a somewhat weirdly ragged form and is ultimately understood to essentially control human development.  The new twist is that this alien structure has been on Earth for several billion years and apparently ""terraforms,"" or maybe ""re-terraforms,"" the planet on a periodic basis.  The decision to obliterate all living things and start over again seems to be based on how well biological life forms are doing, or maybe if they are evolving in the ""correct"" manner.  This seems especially true for the human beings who have recently appeared on the evolutionary scene, i.e., are they evolving toward something better or are they still acting like vicious animals and need to be eradicated in a pan-global die off?

This cycle of biological rebooting explains what happened to the dinosaurs.  What they had done wrong to deserve such a fate is not explained.  In any event, the human race is up next for review and possible extinction.  Will love save the race?

Given that this movie was made in 2001, the computer-generated graphics are a little clunky by today's standards.  But there are still some animated scenes that rise to the level of digital art, sort of like what you would expect from a mechanical engineer suddenly seized by a fit of wild creativity.

The acting, directing, and cinematography are up to standards.  The editing is a little rough in places, usually when one character is talking to another character who is actually off set, and the scene is spliced together later.  As for the soundtrack, if you like the moaning male and whining female vocal background when a scene is getting eerie or mystical, you will like this soundtrack, also.",1352332800,,2446,4.972972972972973

1689210,5,B0000639KS,"In Bhutan an alien object appears causing a death clild to come back to live.  However, the alien object causes electric outages around the world.

The US military is sent by the NSA to the alien site for observation, but tensions are high because the location is near China.

Mason Rand and Dr Cosvaugh travel by plane to the site. Rand specializes in figuring out how devices work.  The object is a large floating rock formation, 1/2 mile high and 1/4 mile in diameter.

Dr. Solomon introduces Dr. Rand to the boy who died of diphtheria and brought back to life by the aliens, reanimation.  Dr. Rands head wound was miraculously healed.

Two Chinese Migs  fly by the Epoch.  The epoch has nine holes representing the nine planets in the solar system.  A robot hand is used to open the epoch by rotating the holes counter clockwise to the current position of the nine planets.

The Chinese Migs fire a missile at the Epoch.  An energy alien sentry launches and its energy tentacles striking the planes destroying both the aircraft.  NSA is concerned because it looks like the US military shot down the migs.

China wants total access to Epoch or it will destroy it.  The Chinese ambassador does not believe the US is cooperative and demands complete access without the Presidents approval.

Dr. Rand's Lou Garrett is cured.  The alien can alter cellular structure and Epoch is 4 billion years old.  The Epoch alien can reconstitute DNA.  The bizarre jumps in species were DNA manipulation by the Epoch alien, evolutionary science version of God.

China does not acknowledge Bhutan sovereignty.  The Chinese Military has four division ready to fight.  The alien is a robot.  the robot shows Rand and Cosvaugh the dna history of the planet.  The robot wants to redesign earth. The robot and epoch generate cloud cover 1 mile wide and it will cover the earth in 90 hours, a new ice age in 30 days, a black out period.  The military decides to explode a nuclear weapon inside the epoch.  Rand decides to disarm a tactical nuclear weapon.

Epoch had the ability to absorb the nuclear blast.  The epoch break apart.  The robot terra former departs earth.  Rand believed he caused the robot to depart. cosvaugh has become pregnant.

The director portrays China build arrogant, unwilling to listen, and in a Master and servant role.  China's military strike Epoch without understanding the object then it sends in research team to discovery epoch's purpose.  China has might, it has brains, but it acting strangely out of context, almost like a machine.  The terraform also seems to be caught in a simple algorithm to repair dna defect, restore the original dna when corruption occurs, and reboot the planet.  The world has been caught up in false science, false beliefs, false gods, and become diseased.  The terraform robot can't fix all the problems so it attempts to reboot the system.  However, it realizes the the second dna family has more potential and then shuts down because it operates on morality.  The earth almost receives a cleansing but the terraforming robot realizes an epoch responsibility to do no harm and stops.  A strange paradox because the wicked will continue to be more corrupt.  It seems the terraforming robot could not exercise judgment because it lack the wisdom and power to do so.",1322265600,,3306,4.813167259786477
1689211,2,B0000639KS,"Like the mysterious object at the center of the story, this movie doesn't lend itself to easy interpretation.  In many cases, that is a good thing - but in the case of Epoch, I think it's just a natural byproduct of a weak and insufficient storyline.  The whole movie disappoints on multiple levels.  The scientific research angle is not credible, the military angle leaves much to be desired, and the governmental and international diplomacy angle is laughable.  With the exception of David Keith, the acting is acceptable at best, and the impressive special effects scenes are outnumbered by patently fake and poor CGI shots.  I love science fiction films like this, but Epoch just doesn't make the grade.

Epoch's story revolves around a remarkable and wholly mysterious object that suddenly rises out of the earth in the Asian country of Bhutan.  The gigantic monolith just hangs there like a tornado flash-frozen in carbonite.  Locals attach a religious significance to it, claiming that its appearance has healed the sick and brought the recently dead back to life.  The United States government, as represented by a room full of unidentified diplomats and military leaders, sends a team to investigate the site.  That team consists of Dr. K.C. Czaban (Stephanie Niznik), a National Security advisor we know nothing about (we don't even know what her specialty is supposed to be) and Mason Rand (David Keith), a civilian engineer with a skunk works past.  Two people with hazy backgrounds - that's it.  They are accompanied by a team of elite soldiers.  The Washington talking heads insist that the military presence be as low key as possible, yet the military sets up a base camp and takes over the whole area with a visible presence.  The team's mission is to find a way in to the object and learn as much about it as possible - and time is short because the Chinese are also interested in the object (which lies only a hundred miles or so from the Chinese border) and will soon be sending their own forces to the area.

Things are a mess on every level.  The Washington diplomats are just silly and clueless,  Rand butts heads at the site with both Dr. Czaban and the military, the elite special forces act like a bunch of scared little boys at the first sign of trouble, the diplomatic and military negotiations between the Americans and Chinese leave everyone looking foolish, and even the military command structure on site eventually slides into chaos.  We learn very little about the alien structure beyond the fact that it may hold the secrets to life on Earth even as it emerges as a possible threat to life as we know it.  An unsatisfying conclusion leaves a whole host of questions up in the air.  The movie does sustain your interest throughout, but the whole thing seems almost pointless in the end.  Epoch is essentially an epic disappointment.",1292976000,3,2865,4.8061224489795915
1689212,4,B0000639KS,"I'd seen this title several times, passing it up every time, but I finally decided to give it a shot and see just how bad this film is.  Well, maybe it's because I went into it with such low expectations, but it wasn't half bad.  OK, sure, some alien or unknown object appears in Bhutan, people in the region are brought back to life (no, not as zombies!) or are cured.  The USA learns about it and sends in a scientific team supported by, yes, you guessed it, a crack team of Army Rangers.  There is the head of the scientific team who is not unattractive, and a buckaroo-style brilliant engineer.  They enter the thing and see if they can't figure out what is up with it.  Of course the Chinese want a piece of the action so there is an international crisis brewing as well.

Anyway, that's the set-up.  The cast is all right.  Ryan O'Neil looks like he came out of retirement to play, but he plays a relatively minor role.  David Keith plays the lead, and does all right with it, but let's face it...no one in this film is going to be getting any Oscar nods.

There are several steroetypical characters in this flick, as well as plot developments in the form of military characters, and military decisions, but you'll be surprised how it all turns out.  I was.  All I'll say about that is ""evolution.""

It is certainly better than some big budget science fiction films that I have seen (""Battlefield Earth"" or ""Solaris"", anyone?). The cast of actors does an admirable job with the script, and the special effects are more than adequate.

The story line is pretty basic. A giant monolithic structure suddenly appears out of nowhere in Bhutan. The United States government immediately sends military personnel and scientists to Bhutan at the request of the local government. Meanwhile, China, the adjacent country wishes to do likewise, causing a conflict that will have a surprising outcome.

The monolithic structure appears to contain an alien force with technological capabilities far beyond that of anyone on earth. Mason (David Keith), an engineer suffering from an incurable terminal illness, has been taken under duress to Bhutan in order to try and ascertain the physical properties of the monolith, investigate its structure, and gain entry. Ryan O'Neal has a small part in which he plays the role of Mason's superior and appears to be a liaison with the military that wishes to take a more strident, aggressive role in the matter.

Mason, as do the others, eventually discovers that the alien force within the monolith appears to have healing powers far beyond anyone's imagination. This discovery does not prevent the United States government from making a knuckle-headed decision as to what to do with the monolith. Mason and a female scientist then try to right what went wrong.

An intriguing outcome provides some food for thought, although much of what is touched upon in this film has been covered in other films.

For those who enjoy science fiction, it is certainly worth a rental.",1150848000,38,1775,5.047781569965871
1689225,5,B0000639KS,"I wasn't going to write anything so I'll just make two brief commentaries.

-I loved this movie as much the first reviewers did.

-The last reviewer said it was nonsense that the alien thing from this movie heals at the same it wipes entire world lifeout. I guess that guy is confused about something. This movie is ""Epoch"" and it's about an alien weird thing that comes to check what's been going on since the world life started billions of years ago. The alien thing was attacked several times by military wackos who didn't care at all that several people had been healed and even brought back to life from death. What would you do if after doing so much good you get this reply? Anyway, the alien thing finally forgave the world.",1143158400,6,732,4.496240601503759
1689226,4,B0000639KS,"A large rock-like construct has risen in an Asian desert.  The object defies gravity and looks like a sculpture of a tornado.  The US Military has been invited to investigate.  A top problem solver has been brought in.  The object seems o be impossibly old and its appearance is rumored to have brought a dead boy back to life.

Tempers flare as the Chinese government tries to send in its own troops.  While the diplomatic and military arms of the governments clash it becomes evident that there is some sort of healing power associated with the object.  Access to the object's interior is gained and the revelations begin.  This object's place in our planets history is undeniable as are its immediate plans.

A rather interesting story.  The plot ties in nicely to some theories of evolution and the development of Earth.  The special effect were pretty good although the typical problem of scale is apparent.  At one point we are told the size of the object while other scenes at a distance don't seem to match (nowhere near as bad as when Spider-Man was three stories tall).  But all in all the story is character driven and not effects driven (that is usually a good thing).  If you like science fiction that makes you think then this is one for you.",1141862400,5,1256,4.624434389140271
1689227,5,B0000639KS,"This movie made me think about the origins of life on earth - it explores the intelligent design but by whom versus darwinian evolution, such speculations set in the context of military conflict over a strange uncontrollable object in Bhutan, on the border of China. Ryan ONeal plays a minor role as Alan Lysander with unshakeable faith in our hero, who with his sheila, unravels the mystery of 4 billion years of evolution on Earth.

Excellent Sci Fi for buffs of all ages.",1128124800,4,474,4.710843373493976
