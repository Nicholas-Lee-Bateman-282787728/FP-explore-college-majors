This collection of movies represent some of the last true Warren Miller movies. The current films using his name have nothing to do with Mr. Miller. Much like Walt Disney, Warren Miller's name has become a brand. This collection of movies will help you understand why. The movies are well produced, feature contemporary artists in the soundtrack, and add words to the popular lexicon, like Freeride. Best of all, they also feature Warren Miller's vision, style and humor. These movies are still a great way to kick off ski season.",1283644800,2,701,4.85
2379506,5,B000A8AX2C,"The ""Riders"" movies are some of the best of the Warren Miller movies.  I have always loved Snowriders 2 not only for it's breathtaking video footage, but also for it's great soundtrack.  It has some great bands on it such as Reel Big Fish, The Offspring, and Counting Crows.  Snowriders 2 is the film that ends with the song, ""A Long December,"" by Counting Crows which is a perfect way to end a ski movie if you ask me.

It's a great price for three great movies.

After watching one movie, my wife and I are now planning on moving to a ski town.  I love skiing and have always wanted to do that and now I am.  ""If you don't do it this year, you'll be one year older when you do.""",1258848000,5,680,4.067669172932331
2379507,4,B000A8AX2C,"The name Warren Miller is a household name for ski enthusiasts.  He's built a great reputation for his documentaries of filiming skiers.  This DVD collection shows skiing places all over the world and great footages of a few going down  extreme slopes.  What bored me most of the time is how monotonous the footages were no matter what country they take you, the shots are always at close-up range.  It doesn't have that feel that you're watching that person ski down that Italian Alps or down that Scottish glens or even down our local slopes in Squaw Valley - all footages in different countries were filmed at close-up range so after a while it will get monotonous.  It does get boring after 1 hour and then there's two more DVD's to go. This DVD collection is great for parties where you put it on a big screen in mute with loud music blasting from your home stereo and people having loud conversations and just happening to see footages of skiers while talking.  Good collection to keep though.",1143244800,8,999,4.610169491525424

8076190,4,B000A8AX2C,"Love these movies. These are three of the greatest ski movies of all time. The skiing is great, and Warren's commentary is on point, but the reason why I'm only giving it 4 stars is because Snowriders does not have all the original music. I have all 3 of these on VHS and I instantly noticed something was different in the first scene at Copper Mountain and then the next scene and then a few select ones from there on out. Still a great movie, but it is a little irritating not having the original music having seen it so many times before.",1420329600,,541,4.262135922330097
