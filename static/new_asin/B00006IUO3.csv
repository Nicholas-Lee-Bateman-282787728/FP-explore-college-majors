1779139,4,B00006IUO3,"I love this movie. The best movies are the true stories. It's funny but it's also pretty scary and unnerving. I think that most of us can relate to the main character and empathize with her family. It's horrible what happened to her and awful that she didn't have the community support that she deserved from the start of her attempts to get justice. Its sad that things like this have to happen before policymakers get certain laws on the books. How much common sense do you have to have to create laws that don't have to specifically include certain infringements of privacy but that will encompass many wrong and illegal acts? This law should have been a part of a bigger laaw, created years ago.",1253750400,,699,4.555555555555555
1779140,5,B00006IUO3,"Wow I saw this movie on TV and just watched it again. The man accross the road and his wife were perverts and scum who spied on their neighbors using video camera's.  Unfortunately for the victims, the ""church going"" friends took the side of the perverts and made the victims feel at fault. Even though the ""church going"" friends obviously had issues too. What was in the water in that neighborhood? Are all those freaks still there? If your moving to that area, I would seriously reconsider. Haha. What a bunch of sick folks.",1214092800,2,526,4.595744680851064
1779141,5,B00006IUO3,This movie gave me the chills with how this pyscho watched this lady and her family on cam.  The actors were great and i liked the story.  Must See!,1151193600,2,148,4.068965517241379
1779142,5,B00006IUO3,"WOW! This movie rocks. This is a movie about Susan Wilson and her family and the effects of their life being taped with out your permission. Susan was not going to sit there and do nothing, she stood up and made people who are doing these crimes accountable for them. This is a true story about a women who changed the law about video Voyeurs. And for those who may not know what Video Voyeur is it is the tapeing of your life, personal moments, sexual moments, and things to that effect with out your permission. Video Voyeurs can happen any where. Susan was safe in her own home, or so she thought! This was a GREAT lifetime original movie........",1105660800,12,649,4.416666666666667
1779143,3,B00006IUO3,"Although I don't usually watch made-for-TV movies, the only reason I watched this one is because I'm an Angie Harmon fan, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered.
 This is a typical ""woman in jeopardy"" story based on a real life tale. What sets it apart from others(in my opinion)is the fine performance turned in by Ms. Harmon as Susan Wilson, a wife and mother of two who is being secretly videotaped by her neighbor and fellow churchgoer. She brings an emotional and energetic spirit to the character as we see her first settling in to the new communtiy, then discovering the disturbing invasion of privacy, and finally fighting back against the man responsible. Rather than remaining a victim, Susan Wilson chose to confront this individual and prosecute him as far as the state supreme court regardless of what her friends and neighbors said, and Angie Harmon portrays that effectively.
 The movie does not give too much depth to the other characters such as Susan's husband and the motivations behind the neighbor's voyeurism but it does a good job with the title character and the essence of this story.
 A routine story saved by a fine lead performance.",1036972800,9,1156,4.887755102040816
1779144,5,B00006IUO3,"A must-see for all Lifetime enthusiasts! If you're obsessed with Lifetime movies, you're sure to love this one. It's salacious, controversial, creepy, and awesome all at once! Well-acted for a tv movie, I highly recommend Video Voyeur!",1411344000,,235,5.378378378378378
1779145,5,B00006IUO3,Bought it for the wife as a gift she wanted it,1399334400,,46,3.272727272727273
1779146,2,B00006IUO3,"I so wanted to give this more stars.  The cast acting was competent to engaging, the pacing was even, the viewer could empathize with the protagonist-- But here's my thing: one and arguably two incidents in which her voyeur carelessly demonstrate that he has heard things said and music played by his victim, when she thought she was alone in her house, are forgotten about when law enforcement establishes what the voyeur can be charged with under the existing laws: The tapes he has made are without sound.  But it was by remembering his comment about something she said when she was talking to herself in her bathroom that Ms. Wilson first realizes her neighbor has been spying on her in the first place!  Very big OOPS in the screenplay, I would say, and I have a hard time excusing such carelessness.",1394755200,,805,4.654929577464789
1779147,4,B00006IUO3,"This movie based on the true experience of Susan Wilson was excellent and illustrated the courage of one woman to fight the system to create a law that would make videotaping a person without their consent a crime. Her ""oh-so-friendly"" church-going neighbor has major boundary issues that reach far beyond his drop-by visits!  Although a well-respected elder in his church, this man has a dark side, and Susan finally realizes what is going on behind closed doors.  A wonderful movie with excellent actors.  Would recommend highly!",1375142400,2,531,5.151162790697675
1779148,5,B00006IUO3,The cast and crew of this TV film have it all done as Angie Harmon suspects her neighbor of watching her and her family in compromising postions.,1372032000,,145,4.407407407407407
1779149,3,B00006IUO3,"The Wilson family move next door to all around nice guy Steve Glover (Jamey Sheridan) church deacon and handy man. He hangs around and helps and is perhaps a little too fond of Susan Wilson (Angie Harmon). Eventually he develops that Eric Roberts creep to him as he plays his hand too soon. The first rule of peeping Tom is to pretend you know less about the victim than you do. Steve screws up and gets caught. What is fortunate for him is that the law is on his side, although it would seem filming children would come under child pornography even back in the 1990s.

With the advent of micro and cell phone cameras, the voyeur tendency or ""visual rape"" as it is called has gotten out of control, with people being arrested in shopping malls standing at the escalators. Where does it end when people are given the technology to be voyeurs without being caught?

It is an interesting film to say the least. It opens up a can of worms that society has trouble dealing with, that is, ourselves. Temptation and the ability to do wrong and get away with it will always lead to controversy and trouble.

Parental Guide: Made for TV film. No nudity. Discreet arm/sheet placement and body suit for Susan (you can visibly see a panty line in the shower)",1362096000,,1246,4.4801762114537445
1779150,4,B00006IUO3,"For a made for TV production it is above average. They do a good job on the creep factor for the perpetrator, and the jaw-droppingly cavalier approach from some church members. Harmon's portrayal is very good, but doesn't quite grasp the brass ring. As technology and society's understanding of tech have advanced some of the elements of the movie are a bit trite and dated. Nevertheless, still an effective presentation.",1350604800,,421,5.0285714285714285
1779151,5,B00006IUO3,this move is a great true story. i could understand why she and other victims of such a crime would feel as if they had been raped. it is sickening that people would do such a thing. i belive all states should have a law against it.the movie was very good the woman who acted as susan was a great actress. i liked the movie alot,1293062400,,328,3.984848484848485
1779152,5,B00006IUO3,"This story was so touching that I feel it is the glue that holds many women, and men, together after an experience of deceipt, where they find themselves the victim. I found strength in this story as well as an aliveness that made me glad I am not a complacent person who goes on day to day claiming that nothing evil happens in this world. There are many deceiptful people out there who are made up of both good and bad, some of them more bad than good, and we must help each other with every thread we have to overcome violations of our freedom, or our person, by exposing these situations and these people. Congrats to Susan for standing up for herself and being instrumental in changing some of the state's laws governing videotaping behavior. Loved it!",1284336000,2,757,4.492753623188406
1779153,5,B00006IUO3,"I have no idea how many times I have watched this movie, but I enjoy it every single time that I do watch it.  Each time I see this movie I pick up something that I had not noticed before, a fact which makes this movie even more exciting.

Angie Harmon is especially beautiful in this movie.  She adds a lot to the movie with her beauty and tremendous acting ability.  She has true talent, making the movie even more believable than it already is.  All the other actors add a tremendous amount of excitement and believability to the movie through their own efforts and tremendous talents.

I do have to say that the acting pool for ""Video Voyeur"" is perfect.  No better actors could have been chosen to create this movie or to make it the great work that it is.  For the talent alone in this movie I would recommend it to anyone old enough to watch it.  It is a must!  Buy this video if you can, folks!  It is definitely worth your time!",1280275200,,937,4.237288135593221
