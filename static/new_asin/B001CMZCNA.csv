It was not pornographic in the slightest sense, and very educational. It amazed me how little most people even nowadays know about sex. There were factiods in the DVD that amazed me, while others made me laugh. They brought in the war, literature, and movies. Describing how each one was influenced by sex, and how the idea of sex was changed by different events. All and All this gag gift offered me an educational experaince that was far from boring and very much enlightening.",1225238400,,645,4.47457627118644
