6506147,5,B00LTQPB6W,"A Hollywood classic from it's golden years, ""Gone with the Wind"" is essential viewing.  The small, blathering crowd that would tell you that the depiction of the antebellum south is ""offensive"" are simply bleating a politically skewed victimhood that has no place in enjoying this marvelous film.  In fact, proving this is easy:  My 11-year old son, as we watched, asked questions about the period of time shown in the film- questions THAT WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ASKED HAD THIS FILM NOT BEEN AVAILABLE!  I already had an old copy of this movie, but I admit I bought THIS one because I was afraid that it might ""go away"".  I have a great copy of ""Song of the South"", as well, and enjoy it immensely- without a single negative thought.  Please, get ""GWTW"" (and ""SOTS"", for that matter), and simply enjoy.  If you've got questions, ask them, and if you have answers, please give them honestly and teach, teach, teach!",1508889600,6,913,4.66875
6506148,1,B00LTQPB6W,"This review is of this product, not the film.

The digital copy code included is expired. It doesn't work and Warner Brothers refuses to help me. They passed me off to Flixster, who I do not have an account with and do not want to make an account with, but apparently I'll have to in order to see if *maybe* they will provide a working code to redeem the digital copy. I will update if I get a working code or not, but the one star rating isn't going to change; I've had issues with Warner Bros before.",1505260800,,502,4.122448979591836

For those in the U.S. and order the 75th Anniversary Edition on Blu Ray, you will receive an imported copy that was originally intended for the U.K. and Ireland, as per the packaging.

8668023,5,B00LTQPB6W,"Gone With The Wind, 1939 film

This 75th Anniversary release has four DVDs for its programming material. GWTW was the most successful movie in Hollywood's history. Its message of surviving an economic catastrophe must have resonated with people suffering from the Great Depression. Discs 1 and 2 contain the movie. The novel told about the very rich and their personal problems. It shows how the war affected people's lives and what happened to the survivors.

Disc 1 begins in 1861, people await ""The War for Southern Independence"" which will quickly be over. We see the society of the plantation owners (like feudal aristocracy) and their personalities. The main interest is Scarlett O'Hara and her whims and passions. Ashley rejects her, so she marries Charles who goes off to the war and dies. The South loses the Battle of Gettyburg and later Sherman's Army invades Georgia to split the Confederate states. Scarlett returns to find Tara devastated. She vows to live through this and never be hungry again.

Disc 2 begins with occupied Georgia and a new political rule. Scarlett marries a wealthy businessman to get the money needed to save Tara from the tax collector. Convicts provide cheap labor. Charles is killed in a raid on a shanty town. Scarlett is free to marry Rhett (who knows how to act for his self-interest). Scarlett faces down society while Melanie greets her. Later she asks Scarlett to look after her son and Ashley (she is going away on a long trip). But Ashley will always love Melanie. Rhett tells Scarlett he is leaving her. Saying ""I'm sorry"" can't make up for the past. ""Tomorrow is another day"" says Scarlett.",1518912000,,1639,4.888489208633094
