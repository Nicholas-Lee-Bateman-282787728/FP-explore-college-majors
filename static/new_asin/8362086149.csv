For those who like wacky comedy, it's a fine of that genre.  Some Polish reviewers call it Poland's best comedy.  For me, the film's strength lies in its capture of Polish life, business, architecture and people during the era of Soviet repression. As it follows the mishaps of a variety of characters, the film shows a panorama of Warsaw life.  The DVD was delivered promptly. It was of high quality.  As the seller noted, the video is produced for the European region, requiring appropriate equipment for viewing on U.S. equipment .",1384300800,,655,4.701754385964913
