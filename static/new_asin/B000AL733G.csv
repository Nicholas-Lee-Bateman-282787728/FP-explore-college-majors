2389333,5,B000AL733G,"I haven't seen ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" since it was last shown on TV Land quite a few years back. This show is one of the best anthology series ever and deserves to be shown and enjoyed. Thankfully Universal has seen fit to release season one on DVD. All 39 episodes (yes, 39!) of this incredible show.

The one constant element throughout the series is the presence of Alfred Hitchcock with his dry, macabre sense of humor. This show made the well-respected film director a huge TV personality of the 50s and 60s. It was part of his deal with CBS that he would direct many of the episodes but as it turned out he directed only 17 segments during the series entire run.

Many well-known actors from film and television made appearances on the show during it's run. In this season one set you can expect to see Aunt Bea (Frances Bavier), John Forsythe, Cloris Leachman, Joseph Cotten, Peter Lawford, Barry Fitzgerald, Carolyn Jones, John Cassavetes, Charles Bronson, Claude Rains and many others. There was also a bit of nepotism afoot as Pat Hichcock made numerous appearances on her dad's show. Fortunately, she was a pretty good actress.

The episodes are based on great short stories by writers such as Alexander Woollcott, Ambrose Bierce, Cornell Woolrich, Frederic Brown, Henry Slesar, H.H. Munro (aka Saki), John Cheever, John Collier, John Wyndham, Ray Bradbury, Robert Bloch and Roald Dahl. Yes, that's the same Roald Dahl who wrote those entertaining children's stories (you've heard of Willy Wonka, I presume). He wrote one of the series most famous episodes ""Lamb to the Slaughter.""

I have read that Hitchcock actually filmed two openings and closings for each episode. The ones Americans are familiar with feature Hitch sarcastically commenting on the show's sponsors and TV in general. The other openings and closings were created for the European market and featured Hitch poking fun at Americans. I don't know if any of these alternate scenes are included but they would be fun to watch.

A price tag of under $30 for 39 episodes of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" is a great bargain compared to the ridiculously overpriced ""The Twilight Zone"" seasons. As much as I like ""The Twilight Zone"" I refuse to pay those prices. As for ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents,"" I'll be the first in line to drop my $30 for these great shows.",1122768000,204,2336,4.888888888888889
2389334,5,B000AL733G,"After releasing only selected episodes in volumes (4 episodes in 1 DVD), it is good to see that Universal Home Entertainment is finally releasing this show in season box sets (and hope that they continue to release the remaining seasons in the future).

Premiered on October 1st, 1955, this wonderful series ran for seven seasons, and afterwards for another 3 seasons as ""The Alfred Hitchcock Hour"". This set contains the first 39 episodes of Season 1, told by the `Master of Suspense', Alfred Hitchcock. The episodes include:

39. Momentum

Along with the above episodes, this DVD also contains a featurette called ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents: A Look Back"" on the show. Compared to the Season Sets of ""The Twilight Zone"" (which ranges from $75-100), I feel the price for this DVD is very decent and is worth buying.

All in all, this is a great release and I hope Universal will continue releasing more seasons of this show in the future.",1122681600,394,1790,4.605769230769231

discussing Alfred Hitchcock's tenure as the host of his cult classic tv series. Then ""The Cheney Vase"" and a less aired episode ""The Sorcerer's Apprentise"" are shown in their entirety complete with commercials  :(  If you get a hold of this tape,expect very little of it not only because of the short content but also the diminished quality of reproduction.

That's the problem with cheap flippers.  They almost always arrived damaged or simply unplayable.  They either get scratched in shipping or their cheap production quality means they're rendered unplayable straight from the factory.  Sides that won't be recognized as playable DVD's in any player.

Universal, of course, has the right to be cheap in production.  And I have the right to tell you not to waste your money on their cheap product.

EDIT: Further reasons not to buy.  No scratches on Disc 2, Side B: not fully playable.  No scratches on Disc 3, Side A: not fully playable.  See?  Flippers are trash!  Do NOT buy!",1495756800,,796,4.8

2389372,5,B000AL733G,"I loved staying up late to watch the re-runs of these shows when I was growing up. Each show has some type of tense dramatic moment, which is sometimes frightening and sometimes just shocking. One of the common threads that runs through each show is the harrowing nature of the human experience.

In this first season, you will be pleased by the memorable stories, but also surprised by how many well-known authors were utilized as sources for the stories, including one of my favorite authors, Dorothy L. Sayers. You will also recognize many famous actors and actresses. In addition, there are interesting appearances by people that you may not recognize, such as Alfred Hitchcock's daughter.

Another aspect of this show that makes it fun is the humorous and often self-deprecating humor of Hitchcock himself. If you loved the old Twilight Zone series, you will most likely also appreciate this series.",1434758400,,904,5.02

He carries his bowling ball over to a circus-style cannon and comments; ""I am pleased to report that I have not suffered from a sore shoulder since using this apparatus."" He drops the ball into the cannon, lights the fuse and theatrically sticks his fingers into his ears. The resulting ""poof"" of white smoke is the segue into the episode. Coming out of commercial after act one, Hitch is back, to report; ""I knocked down all ten pins, the backboard at the end of the lane, the back wall of the building, as well as two young boys who were playing in the parking lot"". There is a thin repetitive ""beep"" in the manner of Sputnik or other unmanned satellites of that era. Hitch concludes; ""And one of them has apparently gone into orbit"". Oops, almost forgot--no impression of Alfred Hitchcock is accurate without the pronunciation of ""evening"" as a three-syllable word (""good eve-uh-ning"").",1393027200,,1061,4.709677419354839

I'm 25, but I've always loved all the classic television shows and movies, and it's shows like this that's the reason why.

Now I've read some other reviews, and it seems that some people have had problems with their first season dvd set, but I honestly had no problems whatsoever with my set. I'm crossing my fingers that it stays that way! I can definitly tell I'm gonna wanna watch these episodes multiple times.

I rather imagine actors clamored to get a role on his shows, such was the showcase potential.  He often used them against type to wonderful effect.

It is unfortunate that Universal has issued these discs in double-sided format.  The British version is released in 6 discs, and the American in three.  I have had two of these boxes and both had the same problem at some point:  the disc would freeze, then jump around, and play again or not.  I tried them on four machines with the same results.  I could lay the blame entirely on the double sides but, as sometimes the defect is not necessarily visible, it would indicate that the defect is embedded in the encoding.

2389517,4,B000AL733G,"Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Season One

(Released: 2005 by Universal Studios Home Entertainment)
Another Looong DVD Review by Joe Torcivia

It boasts one of the most famous openings in television history.  The classical piece ""Funeral March of a Marionette"" plays, as the drawn outline of a rotund man fades into view.  A dark silhouette, fitting the outlined profile, slowly walks into frame, matching it contour for contour.  The camera pans over to our host, who greets us with a simultaneously familiar and chilling: ""Good Eve-ven-ing!""

It is ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS, one of those underappreciated television gems that has become more a part of our culture than most folks realize.  AHP continues to demonstrate its brilliance through the courtesy of DVD, the first such collection is the subject of this review.

Renowned director Alfred Hitchcock both introduces and offers a coda to each of his weekly tales of mystery, suspense, and usually murder - the grizzly detail of which often seems to surpass the perceived norms of 1950s TV.  Mr. Hitchcock employs top-notch actors, writers and directors for his television ""plays"" (as he calls them) and sometimes directs certain choice episodes himself.

The ""plays"" themselves are fun to watch, and deliver the best suspense the era had to offer.  But Alfred Hitchcock really puts them ""over the top"" with the innovative ways he leads into and out of the stories - and introduces commercial messages.

Sample this typical Hitchcock introduction, taken from the episode: ""A Bullet for Baldwin"".  (We open with Hitchcock seated at a desk.)

""Good Eve-ven-ing!  I hope you'll excuse me if I appear a trifle excited, but I've just come into possession of a cure for insomnia.  [He produces FIVE BULLETS and stands them up on the desk, neatly in a row.] It comes in capsule form.  For best results, they must be taken internally. [He produces a GUN.]  Here is the handy applicator.

""It is an amazingly simple device.  An idiot can operate it - and, indeed, many do.  These objects play an important part in tonight's tale.  It is called `A Bullet for Baldwin'.""

As is our custom in these reviews, we'll break it into CONS and PROS.

The CONS:

Disc One:  In what I hope is strictly my own experience, The Adventure of Disc One is one of those quirky happenings that Mr. Hitchcock would no doubt appreciate.  Episode Four ""Don't Come Back Alive"" froze little more than halfway through.  It would then skip forward a bit and resume without incident.  This happened in exactly the same way on multiple players.

Amazon was excellent in quickly delivering a duplicate of the set, and leaving me a generous amount of time to return the original defective one.

My first impulse was to immediately play ""Don't Come Back Alive"" to see what I missed.  To my surprise, the same flaw manifested itself - only EARLIER in the episode - and skipped to a LATER POINT before resuming!

Now, this wasn't necessarily a bad thing, as the ""freeze"" perfectly coincided with a commercial break fade-out (making the fade-out just seem longer than usual, and the flaw somehow ""neater"").  I considered keeping this one, and sending back the original - even though I was missing more of the episode.

Then, I found an ADDITIONAL such flaw on the SAME DISC in Episode # 5 ""Into Thin Air"" - which just happens to be one of the best of the set!  So, I flurry-watched every episode of the ORIGINAL SET, and sent back the replacement - which, sadly, was more flawed than the original.

Chapter Skipping:  In short, there is none.  At any point in an episode, pressing ""Forward Chapter Skip"" will take you past the end of the episode and back to the menu.  Compare with a comparable half-hour show like TWILIGHT ZONE, which will have three chapters per episode, and one each for ""Rod Serling's Next Week Preview"", and End Credits.  But, the worst is yet to come, in the form of...

Spoilers and Inaccuracies:  When selecting ""Play"" for each episode, an ""Episode Summary"" screen appears, offering a description of the story before allowing the ""Play"" option.  This is a nice idea, but for two quibbles.  These summaries - all too often, alas - either give away the endings... or are inaccurate in describing the story.  WARNING:  Do not read this material until AFTER viewing the episode in question.

One of these gives away the ending to the best mystery story of the set!  How could Universal's quality control allow this?!  A major detriment to the enjoyment of this fine set.

The PROS:

The Players: A stellar list of names, often appearing multiple times over the season:  (In order of first appearance) Ralph Meeker, Vera Miles, John Forsythe, Cloris Leachman, Warren Stevens, Percy Helton, Ellen Corby, Gene Barry, Darren McGavin, Robert Emhardt, Patricia Hitchcock, Alan Napier, Elisha Cook Jr., Joseph Cotton, Everett Sloane, Olan Soule, Peter Lawford, John Williams, Robert F. Simon, Barry Fitzgerald, Arthur Space, Carolyn Jones, John Qualen, Sebastian Cabot, John Cassavetes, Jo Van Fleet, Robert H, Harris, Michael Ansara, Robert Foulk, Cyril Delevanti, Claude Rains, Charles Bronson, Werner Klemperer and John Banner (In the same episode!), Sean McClory, Claude Akins, Estelle Winwood, Amanda Blake, Lorne Greene, Biff McGuire, Alan Hewitt, Frank Gorshin (very brief cameo), Harry Townes, Skip Homeier, and Joanne Woodward.  With Paul Frees in an uncredited role as a radio announcer in the final episode.

How's THAT for a cast list!

The Episodes:  39 glorious episodes of ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS, from the 1955-1956 television season!  Highlights include:

""Revenge"":  The series premiere, directed by Alfred Hitchcock.  Never take the law into your own hands!

""Triggers in Leash"": A tense confrontation between western gunfighters Gene Barry and Darren McGavin breaks out - over breakfast!

""Into Thin Air"": Alfie's daughter, Pat Hitchcock, stars as a frightened young British woman whose mother disappears during a stopover in Paris.  Mother disappears without a trace - and everyone denies having ever seen her.  Hitchcock acknowledges the familial connection at episode's end: ""Oh, incidentally, I thought the little leading lady was rather good... didn't you!""

""Don't Come Back Alive"":  Yes, the one with the ""skip"" in it.  A scheming older man almost gets away with murdering his wife.  Wonderful ending moment!

""Breakdown"": Hitchcock directs Joseph Cotton in what may be one of the most incredible dramatic television presentations of the era!  Paralyzed, pinned in an auto wreck, and unable to speak, Cotton is presumed dead by all who encounter him!  His frantic thoughts, communicated only to the audience, prove otherwise.  Unforgettable!

""A Bullet for Baldwin"": A meek office clerk shoots and kills the boss (Sebastian Cabot) that fired him.  The next day, the boss is back at his desk, with no one the wiser.

""The Older Sister"":  The ""real"" story of Lizzie Borden.  Did she REALLY ""take an axe, etc...""?

""Whodunit"":  An angel (formerly a pompous old mystery writer) requests that he relive his last hours on Earth, to learn who murdered him.  Naturally, he gets more than he bargained for.

""Never Again"" The unexpected can happen when you drink!  So, don't drink!

""The Gentleman from America"" Two nearly bankrupt Britishers bet a bragging wealthy American that he can't (...wait for it) spend the night in an old haunted house!  How many times, and in how many different ways, was this plot done!  Well done here, though!

""The Belfry"": A murderer hides in the bell tower of an old schoolhouse, waiting for the moment to kill the teacher who spurned his affections.

""The Creeper"":  Second best episode after ""Breakdown""! Young blonde women in a New York City neighborhood are being murdered by a killer dubbed ""The Creeper"".  Our story focuses on a housewife's efforts to cope with the situation.  A SUPERB mystery that presents at least five suspects in its 25 minutes of play.

BEWARE: The ""Episode Summary"" that displays before the episode plays GIVES AWAY THE IDENTITY OF THE KILLER!!!  You are warned to just blow past this display before watching ""The Creeper""!

Oh, and don't look this one up on IMDB either. They give it away, too!

Extra Features: ""ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS: A Look Back"", a 14:44 documentary on the series and Alfred Hitchcock.

Overall:

I love this set and its contents... BUT, while the CONS do not outweigh the PROS, they are too severe to ignore.  Again, I hope I am more-or-less alone in my experiences with disc flaws, but I doubt it.

Give it a try... but, like any character in one of Hitchcock's television plays, be wary!

It will please you to know that all the ""CONS"" have been rectified in the SEASON TWO set... and, hopefully, beyond.",1283817600,9,8739,4.991678224687933

The ""plays"" are elegantly and stylishly present, oh what TV and short subjects should be.  Masterful.",1282694400,,324,5.173076923076923
2389539,4,B000AL733G,"When I'd hear the theme music to ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS, I'd suddenly need a drink of water -- my excuse for getting out of bed so I could at least watch his introduction.  And his introduction is sometimes more entertaining -- and thought-provoking-- than the story presented.  Am delighted to have the complete first season to watch at my leisure, and they are the type stories one can watch repeatedly with their plot twists, study of human nature, the universal principles (and violations of same) presented in these tales.  And Hitchcock's wry - and dry - humor is uniquely entertaining.
Received the order on time and in great condition, though there is some issues with the quality of the DVDs -- have watched 3 of the 6 sides and on 2 have encountered a place where the DVD ""sticks"" but was able to fast-forward past that without losing appreciable continuity.  Definitely recommend for any Hitchcock fan; hope to obtain AHP for additional seasons.",1279670400,,959,4.865030674846626
2389540,5,B000AL733G,"I haven't read any of the other reviews yet, but I'm certain some will note the poor sound quality during some of the episodes, and occasional not-too-good picture, but overall, this is a true gem of cinematic history.
  It is quite obvious that other great shows from the ""Golden Age"", such as the ""original"" Twilight Zone were influenced when they came out some years later, (though the Twilight Zone, also beautifully ""creepy"", focused more on fantasy and science fiction, along with death, crime, suspense, and people at their wits end). Another thing that the Twilight Zone incorporated (to it's advantage) was music- something you barely hear during ""Hitchcock Presents"". That being said, I never tire of the incredibly ominous musical drone during the title segment of each episode- it's more unnerving than ""Jaws"" or anything else (except perhaps for the screeching violins in Hitchcock's ""Psycho"").
  And, of course, before and after each episode, who can resist Hitchcock's wonderful intros and outros! I cracked up at the one where the ""men in white coats"" were dragging the hollering, kicking and screaming, Alfred away!
  Unfortunately with Season One, I had some moments of pixel freezing- or whatever the hell it's called- on some episodes, but after repeated trying to replay, (and/or gently washing the disc a few times), the occasional episode in question would play. A friend of mine said that this was common among double-sided discs. I'm glad the other seasons are single-sided.

Special Feature- Alfred Hitchcock Presents: A Look Back

Other special features include A Piece on the history of Alfred Hitchcock's television show featuring all new interviews with Pat Hitchcock- Alfred's daughter, Norman Lloyd, Producer, Director & Actor Plus Hilton Green, Assistant Director.

The set contains both Spanish and English subtitles and is worth every penny if you're interested in some classic and wonderfully directed pieces of TV history. Every episode is great, both in plot and directing. Enjoy.",1222128000,6,10948,4.521958606764261
2389563,5,B000AL733G,Anyone who likes Alfred Hitchcock will enjoy this set.  Each one has a lot of movie stars in it along with good twists and turns to the story.  I highly recommend this.,1220659200,,168,4.21875
2389564,4,B000AL733G,"This along with The Untouchables are 2 great classic TV shows that are now offered on DVD. Both are too pricey, that is why a 4 not a 5.",1219276800,,136,3.7241379310344827
2389565,4,B000AL733G,"This compilation contains bite-sized television dramas from the 1950s.

The compilation deserves FOUR STARS on the basis of the huge quantity of dramas found within, as well as the fact that six of the episodes are truly excellent.  There are 39 stories.  All of the stories begin with a creepy, deadpan introduction by Mr. Hitchcock.  For example, in one introduction, he has a fake knife driven into his back.

This concerns the packaging.  The package is sturdy.  There is a separate plastic insert for each of the three discs.  The discs are two-sided.  This means that there are no charming pictures on one side of the disc.  But in the Superman T.V. series, the five discs bear photographs of Superman, Clark Kent, Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and Perry White.  The Hitchcock package has large photographs of some of the actors.  But this is a waste of space.  In contrast, the Superman package contains a synopsis of each of the shows, in addition to the title.  This is helpful in determining if you've seen the show already or not.  The Hitchcock package contains only a list of titles, and no synopsis.

A few of Amazon.com's reviewers complained about problems with the discs, for example, spontaneous stopping.  None of my discs had any problems.  They all performed smoothly and without any glitches.

This is about the Hitchcock dramas.  The actors are first rate, for example, one of the shows features John Forsyth, a familiar face to all baby-boomers.

It is also great fun to discover various actors, in the Hitchcock stories, who also appear in TWILIGHT ZONE.  Cyril Delevanti, distinguished in being extremely wrinkled, and who appears in LETTER OF CREDIT, SPECIALTY OF THE HOUSE, and THE DERELICTS, of the Hitchcock series, also appears in PIANO IN THE HOUSE of the TWILIGHT ZONE series.  Philip Coolidge, distinguished by having an mean-looking face, and who appears in DECOY as a police detective, also appears in PIANO IN THE HOUSE of TWILIGHT ZONE.  Percy Helton, distinguished by his raspy voice, appears in THE CREEPER as a handyman, also appears on TWILIGHT ZONE in MR.GARRITY AND THE GRAVES.  Other actors who appear in both ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS and in TWILIGHT ZONE episodes include William Shatner (Glass Eye in Alfred Hitchcock Presents; Nick of Time and Nightmare at 20,000 Feet in Twilight Zone), Jack Klugman, and Albert Salmi.  Also, I noticed Everett Sloane, who is found in the Alfred Hitchcock episode, OUR COOK'S A TREASURE, and the Twilight Zone episode, THE FEVER.  In both of these stories, Everett Sloane plays an irritable man.

Out of the 39 dramas, I found found a half-dozen shows that are solid FIVE STAR shows.  The first concerns an automobile trip from New York City to San Francisco, where two men share thoughts about England.  The second concerns a man in England who buries his wife in his basement, and travels to a new job in America.  The third concerns a young couple living in a trailer park, where the wife imagines that she was attacked (this one has plump actress Frances Bavier, a.k.a. Aunt Bee).  The fourth concerns a belligerent woman who likes to give shopkeepers a hard time. The fifth concerns a man who believes his housekeeper is trying to poison him, but it turns out to be his wife (oh no, I gave away the ending).  The sixth, the one with John Forsyth, contains a classic surprise ending.

This is about my favorite story, the one about the belligerent woman.  It is called SHOPPING FOR DEATH, by Ray Bradbury.  Mr. Hitchcock introduces the story by opening and closing a door.  There is no squeak.  Then he applies something from an oil can, and opens and closes the door.  There are very loud squeaks.  He says, ""There, that's better, much better.  Loud-squeaking fluid!  On dark nights, you can spray it in the air if the wind isn't whistling loud enough.  It can make old shoes squeak like new again.""  Then the story begins.

SHOPPING FOR DEATH features Jo Van Fleet, an actress who performed in over 50 movies and T.V. shows, e.g., East of Eden, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, 77 Sunset Strip, Cool Hand Luke, Bonanza, The Trip to Bountiful, and others.  In a nutshell, the woman likes to give shopkeepers a hard time.  She is always on the verge of anger, for typical reasons.  These reasons include, lack of money, an apartment that is too noisy, a husband who drinks too much, and concern for getting too old. The plot involves two retired life insurance men, who show concern for the woman's excess belligerance (especially in view of the hot summer weather), from safety hazards in her apartment (frayed electric wires), and from her failure to refrigerate meat from the butcher.  The two men try to warn the woman that she shouldn't be so quick to anger, since this might provoke retaliation.  But the woman responds with paranoia, and send the two men away.  The story ends when we see the husband returning home from an hour of drinking.  Surprisingly, this is the only Hitchcock story without any actual violence--but there is a ton of implied violence.  This is what makes SHOPPING FOR DEATH a work of dramatic art.

My second favorite story is THE LONG SHOT.  Mr. Hitchcock begins the monologue by working a gambling machine.  He says, ""My last quarter.  I've been lucky this evening.""  Mr. Hitchcock steps to the side, and we see that actual fruits have come out of the gambling machine--oranges, grapes, lemons.  The drama features Peter Lawford, a gambler who bets on horses.  But he has a gambling debt of $4,200 that is owed to ""Dutch.""  He spots an ad from a driver to accompany an Englishman across the country, from New York to San Francisco.  His goal is to get out of town and to hide from Dutch.  During the motor trip, Peter Lawford and the Englishman talk about places in London--Soho, the Algerian Cafe on Dean Street, cafes on Fleet Street, and the Queen.  During the trip, Peter Lawford snoops in the Englishman's brief case and finds a letter promising a $200,000 inheritance from ""Uncle Gerald.""  Peter Lawford decides to impersonate the nephew, and so in continuing the motor trip, he murders the Englishman in the Nevada desert, by running over him with the automobile.  In a day or so, Peter Lawford shows up at the attorney's office in San Francisco to claim his inheritance.  But then, the viewer is treated to a remarkable surprise ending.

Most of the plots are not really first rate.  For example, BACK FOR CHRISTMAS is an average show.  Far superior versions of the same sort of plot can be found in MIRACLE ON 34th STREET, which features Natalie Wood as a child, and NIGHT OF THE MEEK, a charming Christmas drama in the Twilight Zone series featuring Art Carney.

Also, too many of the Hitchcock shows have old people.  There are just too many damned old people in the Hitchcock stories.  In contrast,  TWILIGHT ZONE features mostly middle-aged persons, for example, two excellent dramas with a youthful William Shatner, as well as several dramas where the main actor is a little boy or girl.

Nearly all of the Hitchcock dramas show somebody getting whacked on the head, run over by an automobile, shot, knived, poisoned, or bludgeoned.  Is this the kind of program that I'd want to watch more than once?  No.",1218585600,4,7229,4.77320419693301

2389584,3,B000AL733G,"I can only add my voice to those blasting Universal for such a shoddy job presenting some wonderful work by Hitchcock and the brilliant writers that were responsible for some of the best television that's ever come over the airwaves.

The transfers - both video and audio - are lame to begin with, especially in this age where the technology exists that makes it possible to do wonders with old footage. Getting past that, while aggravating, is nothing compared to finding the episodes past the first four on each side of each disc. Hey Universal, a simple ""menu"" is something anyone even remotely familiar with a DVD-creation program learns on day one! This is amateur-hour work of the first magnitude, unworthy of the many first-class artists involved in creating a splendid collection of productions.

The double-sided disks scream ""Cheap."" Why not charge a couple of extra bucks and do it right? Special features would be nice - perhaps some information on the writers or actors or on the original productions - but better sound and video would be even better.

Having said all of that how does one ""rate"" this? OK, 5 Stars for the content, Zero Stars for the (physical) production. That averages out to 2 . So I'm feeling good today; make it 3.",1187654400,16,1249,4.773148148148148

Tautly written photoplays expertly acted and filmed, this half-hour TV program is a lasting tribute to the murder-mystery genre, and to all concerned in its making. The stable of UNIVERSAL PICTURES actors available to this show's producers also guaranteed a consistently hard to beat level of quality. (One strange casting coincidence this first season: the future Colonel Klink and Sgt. Schultz of HOGAN'S HEROES appear together in ""Safe Conduct."")

ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS is highly recommended for all Hitchcock fans and aficionados of vintage television. (Note to UNIVERSAL/MCA-- a suggestion that future volumes include the intro and epilogue segments that 'Hitch' filmed for European audiences only.)

2389611,1,B000AL733G,"I purchased this collection, happy to have the first season of what I remembered as one of my favorite childhood programs.  Unfortunately, this isn't very good in retrospect.  Where The Twilight Zone is BETTER than I gave it credit for back in the day (I couldn't really understand the subtext) this pails in comparison.

I honestly have only seen two of the discs, and jumped through most of the episodes once the hooky plot had been established.  This is third rate Hitch. A really sad waste of talent and effort.  It is amazing it went on for six seasons.  Maybe some individual episodes aren't third rate silliness.  The 'send them to the cornfield' episode is included here.  WAY sad compared with how frightened it made me as a kid.

Not recommended, except maybe as a rental from the Library.",1175990400,5,799,4.690647482014389

It took me a short while to get used to the format of the show which I hadn't seen in long time but once I got used to it, my pleasure in the show soared!  This show is a forerunner to shows like The Twilight Zone etc.  What a great anthology series!  Hitchcock was able to get the best writers, directors and stars to come to television.  Norman Lloyd of later St. Elsewhere fame directed many episodes and people such as Charles Bronson, Barbara Del Geddes, Joanne Woodward starred in them.

2389614,3,B000AL733G,"It's not that this collection of episodes from the first year of the singular Alfred Hitchcock Presents series aren't good stories in themselves, but with the exception of one or two, 50 ensuing years of crime and mystery dramas on TV have so well accustomed us as viewers that the ""twist"" ending or surprises here are telegraphed way in advance.  A bit of rust showing on these dramatizations.

However, Hitch's opening and closing remarks are as wry and amusing as ever and they are cause for delight.  That, and seeing some of the best  lead and supporting players of the era, including Joseph Cotton (a very good episode), Claire Trevor and others in the former, and Percy Kelton and Thelma Ritter et al in the latter, as well as newcomers such as Joanne Woodward, add to the fun.

Mostly a one-time look for me, I don't know if I would purchase this set, but renting it could be fun.  I watched this show with my parents when I was a child and, curiously, I loved it (and never forgot the Joe Cotton segment).  I can't believe I got Hitch's humor then, but I think I did, and I found it a fond recollection here.  I will be curious to see how Season Two develops.",1173830400,3,1168,4.425233644859813

I remember them as being very good, sometimes spooky, sometimes eerie and sometimes humorous.  As I look back at these shows, this first year was definitely weaker than the subsequent series and the even-better Alfred Hitchcock Hour.  I have to admit that these are better than I remembered, though; and with stories written by Roald Dahl, Ray Bradbury and other now-famous writers, with so few directed by Hitch himself, they are still well directed, usually well acted and they are all presented as only the Great Hitch can do.

The best part, however, are the take-ins and take-outs, the little 1 minutes parts by Hitch, all with very wry humor and usually very, very funny.  They alone are worth the price of the DVD's.  As dour as one might think Hitch was, he really was a very delightful man.

The DVDs are not good. They are double-sided which I do not like. The menu only offers four selections under the ""episodes"" category even though there are many more. I saw one reviewer's suggestion for getting around that and will try it. I do not like AT ALL that the episode summaries contain spoilers. They should be teasers only. So after the first one ruined the surprise ending for me I didn't read the others. I haven't yet had any skipping some other people have mentioned.

2389620,1,B000AL733G,"Just needed to add to the long list of outraged customers who bought this set, only to discover that the double-discs tend to be defective, often stopping or freezing halfway into episodes.  When watching an often highly literary mystery program, it is especially infuriating when an episode cuts out and leaves you hanging, like the last few pages of a short story having been torn from the book.  Worse still, given the fact that this is ALFRED HITCHCOCK and not something crummy (like Spielberg's almost unwatchable ""Amazing Stories""), you would think Universal would actually bother to treat this property with an ounce of respect.  Considering  the fact that collectors/afficionados of this type of programming tend to be relatively discriminating, Universal should offer complete replacement sets.  They've made a mint off Hitchcock!

As for the show itself, it's almost uniformly superlative.  I had forgotten how gruesome and graphically violent these episodes tended to be, so it's been a pleasant rediscovery.  All the more reason to resent Universal's appallingly shoddy treatment.",1164499200,38,1092,5.420118343195266

However, I have yet to buy the first season set due to the comments of a number of folks regarding the double sided DVDs ""skipping"" and ""jumping back"".

I'd like to see some much more recent commentary from any purchasers of this first season set in this DVD configuration as to how they've fared with them.

I'd love to buy the first season set but am very reluctant to do so as other double sided DVD items I and others I know have bought have suffered similar problems.

What say any of you folks? Would appreciate hearing from any of you. Perhaps the AHP DVD manufacturers have any comments of reassurance they'd care to make.

2389622,5,B000AL733G,"Watching the immense season one of ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS is like coming upon a treasure chest of lost Alfred Hitchcock masterpieces in miniature.  Herein are 25 minute tales of murder, infidelity, more murder, the macabre, ironic twist endings, and still more murder.  There is so much here that it seems like several seasons, not just one 39 episode season.  It has taken me two months to get through the three disk set.

I don't even know where to begin, maybe with the key players.  Vera Miles and Ralph Meeker as a married couple, a never-better John Qualen in at least three of the very best (especially ""Help Wanted"" with Lorne Greene), Pat Hitchcock (Hitch's daughter) in two of the best (that vanishing hotel is a lulu), John Forsythe in a town that seems haunted, Claude Rains as an eerie ventriloquist, several blackmailers and husbands who fake wives' deaths to collect on insurance policies they do not get, Charles Bronson, Cloris Leachman, gamblers (including Gene Barry) who run out of luck, Everett Sloane and Sidney Blackmer in several delicious gems as men whose murdered wives come back from the dead; the list goes on.  The casting throughout, perhaps by associate producer Joan Harrison, is world-class.

The crew is great, including B&W photography, art direction on the Universal back lot and detailed interiors that belie low production costs, and sharp editing.  The directors include the versatile Robert Stevenson (MARY POPPINS) and Hitchcock himself on a few playlets.  Hitchcock is seemingly the producer on all 39 teleplays here, all of them with witty and acid introductions and closings with him.

But it is the writing that should get the highest praise here--the suspenseful and ironic plotting, superb dialogue, and surprise endings.  Note, especially, how graphic violence is mostly off-screen, including at intermission fade-outs.  There are no bloodbaths here, or in most of Hitchcock's theatrical masterpieces.  Your mind only thinks there is.  The TV writers include Francis Cockrell, Ray Bradbury, and Robert C. Dennis.  Their work is magnificent on these spine-tingling little tales of the macabre.  The talented actors could not do their jobs without the words to say.  ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS (Season One) gets my highest recommendation for fans of the macabre and the supernatural.  You will definitely lose sleep over most of these stories.  Good eve-ning.",1163635200,6,2408,5.223958333333333
2389623,4,B000AL733G,"Alfred Hitchcock was already a celebrated feature film director when ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" brought his macabre humor to television, making Hitchcock a huge star whose profile was readily recognizable all over the world. The shows were a mix of suspense and character dramas involving crime or deceit, often closing with a signature plot twist memorable for its perversity. ""Situation tragedies"", Hitchcock called them. You'll detect the remnants of film noir in more than a few of these tales. Hitchcock's priceless lead-ins and lead-outs for each episode were worth tuning in for, in themselves. All of these darkly comic introductions and epilogues were written by James Allardice. Hitchcock's deadpan presentations make fun of the show's moral lessons, warn wives of murderous husbands, mention that a bullet fired from a gun is a cure for insomnia, and persistently mock the show's sponsors. Who could resist such gall?

Season 1 consists of 39 25-minute episodes plus a short documentary ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents: A Look Back"". These shows originally aired between October 2, 1955 and June 25, 1956. The great majority of the episodes are 4-star quality -good but not great. There are 11 episodes that I award 5 stars and two 3-star episodes. I've noticed that they suffer if you watch many episodes in a row. Viewing no more than 3 at a time presents the episodes to their best advantage. Among the writers on whose stories the shows were based are: Dorothy Sayers, Cornell Woolrich, Ray Bradbury (2), Louis Pollack, Adela Rogers St. John. Featured actors include: Ralph Meeker, Vera Miles, Cloris Leachman, John Forsythe, Joseph Cotton, Peter Lawford, John Cassavetes, Charles Bronson (2), Claude Rains, Claire Trevor, John Williams (2), and Joanne Woodward.

If you are renting Season 1, you may get 6 single-sided discs instead of the 3 double-sided discs that are available for purchase. If you don't want to watch the entire season, choose Disc 2 (or Disc 1, Side B for a 3-disc set). It is the single best disc, with 5 outstanding episodes, including one Emmy Nominee. If you own the set and want some guidance as to what is most worth your time, these are my choices: ""Breakdown"" (#7), ""Our Cook's Treasure"" (#8), ""The Long Shot"" (#9), ""The Case of Mr. Pellam"" (#10), ""Guilty Witness"" (#11), ""The Cheney Vase"" (#13), ""Help Wanted"" (#27), ""Never Again"" (#30), ""The Legacy"" (#35), ""The Creeper"" (#38), and ""Momentum"" (#39).

The Best of the Best are: ""The Case of Mr. Pellam"", in which a businessman (Tom Ewell)  believes that someone must be impersonating him. This episode was Emmy-nominated and is the most unnerving of the lot even though it is thoroughly implausible. In ""The Cheney Vase"", an unscrupulous museum employee (Darren McGavin) imprisons a patron in her own home in order to obtain a valuable vase. ""Help Wanted"" finds an unemployed clerical worker (John Qualen) accepting a job from a mysterious employer who sets him up in an office and pays good money for information he could easily get himself. ""Never Again"" is a character drama about an alcoholic woman (Phyllis Thaxter) who has promised her boyfriend that she would never drink again but has somehow ended up in the hospital, hung over, as she tries to remember why. In ""The Creeper"", a woman (Constance Ford) must deal with her short-tempered husband, sadistic ex-husband, vicious neighbor, and odd janitor, as a near-hysterical fear of a serial strangler consumes her.

The DVDs (Universal 2005): The films have not been restored, so the episodes have some minor flaws. The introductions by Alfred Hitchcock are in worse condition, showing white specks and scratches. An episode summary precedes each episode. A few summaries contain spoilers, but more contain errors. The DVD menus were written for 2-sided discs. If you have a set of single-sided discs,  the menus incorrectly refer to Side B, which doesn't exist. And every disc says that it contains a bonus feature called ""A Look Back"", but that feature is actually on Disc 6 (or Disc 3, Side B).  ""A Look Back"" (15 min) is a short documentary about creating the show, featuring interviews with Hitchcock's daughter Pat Hitchcock, producer Norman Lloyd, and assistant director Hilton Green. Subtitles available for the episodes in English SDH and Spanish.",1162684800,10,4305,5.097872340425532

Though Hitch did not direct all of the episodes (he was, after all, busy with his feature films), all are made with care and are well cast.  John Williams, a Hitch favorite, pops up in several episodes of the first and later seasons.  It's fun to see actors past their heyday or yet to achieve greater stardom in these shows.

The picture froze up several times. I want to say that I'm sorry to all of the people that I said they needed to get new DVD players if their sets didn't work. I was wrong!! There now seems to be a problem with my DVD'S. I take good care of all of my DVD'S so I know it's not me. Universal needs to start doing a better job when it comes to puting all of their shows on DVD. Stop being so Dam cheap! Paramont puts their shows on the right amount of DVD'S & their shows are great. It wouldn't cost any more for Universal to put the shows on one sided DVD'S. They are so much better & there is never a problem with them. Shame on you Universal. I will not buy the next season (if it ever is released on DVD)of AHP unless they change the way they make their DVD'S.",1153008000,21,1045,3.9107981220657275

Different spots at different times on different discs cause the screen to go blank, freeze or go back to the menu page. It's not often, or predictable, but it is a pain. Taking the disc out and blowing off dust, wiping in circular motion, etc. can fix it for the individual incident.

The content is good. The shows are enjoyable. I am a big Hitchcock fan. This is the first series, and as such, is spotty in quality and entertainment value. I am also hoping for a better Season 2 in quality of product and production.",1152835200,11,646,4.338842975206612
2389634,4,B000AL733G,"ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS is one of those things I wanted so desperately on DVD but wasn't sure would ever be released.  I was quite surprised in the fall of 2005 when I saw it on the release schedule.

It is a true television classic, in every aspect.  Hitchcock's introductions, the actors, and above all, the stories all come together to make some of the most compelling television ever broadcast.

However, as good as the shows were, Universal has not seen to treat them with the dignity they deserve.  Unlike the recent reissures of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, these episodes were obviously not remastered from the original camera negatives.  They're not BAD, but they're not great, either.  Some episodes are in better shape than others, in terms of the video and audio quality.

There is also very little by way of bonus material, but I can forgive that.  If this season cost more than $70, I would have expected some audio commentaries and more featurettes, but for $30, I can't complain about the lack of extras.  I'd rather have the episodes without bonus material than have no episodes at all...

So my review is five stars for the programs, and three stars for the DVD quality, giving it an overall four stars.  If you like these shows, this set is WELL worth the purchase price.

No we can only hope that Universal will see fit to release more season sets within our lifetimes.",1150243200,14,1381,4.680497925311204

The thing that kept this from getting a full five stars is that the packaging was terrible!  No linear notes to be found and the bonus material (a 15 minute documentary) left a whole lot to be desired.  Universal seemed to just want to capitalize on the Hitchcock name without doing any sort of work on this collection.  This was highly disappointing.

On top of that, there were NO liner notes, the plot synopses (which you HAVE to see if you watch individual episodes) give away endings quite frequently, the sound quality is VERY poor, especially compared to the Twilight Zone first year set, and the DVDs glitch up often.

1) Not all episodes play, despite no apparent scratches on a new CD. 2 Eps so far have stopped in the middle (Shopping for Death is one of them! argh!) I thought I had a faulty copy, but reading similar reviews it may be down to teh double-sided format. No wonder Dallas costs twice as much on single-sided CDs!

2) The load screen for each episode is full of terrible SPOILERS so you must avert your eyes and just click PLAY right through them - or they wil GIVE AWAY the twists that make this series.

These eps are some of the best TV I own. It's a shame the company didn't  ensure they'd be viewable. You have no choice but to buy them if you want to see the season, though. Good Luck",1147132800,7,786,4.185430463576159

As with Adam-12, Dragnet 1967, Emergency, and both Seasons of The Munsters I have had problems getting the discs to play in 3 dvd players (a Sony, Panasonic, and JVC).

Universal really needs to get their **** together here.  I have had no problems with any other sets from other manufacters and I own over 300 dvd's of TV Shows.  The problem is they try to squeeze to much information on the DVD-18's that they use.  I do not like doule sided dvd's but none of the ones I have from Warner Brothers or Sony ever give me problems.

The first season has 39 episodes, that should be 6 per disc (single sided dual layer) with three on the 7th disc plus the bonus feature.  That would be 7 discs total instead of 3.  Universal really needs to take a lesson from other companies and do things right.

As for the show, I don't have much to say except that it is excellent.  Of course there are a few clunkers but I would say 95% of the episodes are excellent and well worth watching.  Hitch's intro's and outro's are also a blast as the man has a great sense of dry humor.

The bonus material is well done but I would have liked to have seen a few of the original commercials from the first season too.",1146441600,10,1336,4.278884462151394
2389642,4,B000AL733G,"I'm so happy that these wonderful classic episodes are finally available in DVD, but I have to say that I'm disappointed by the quality of the two-sided DVDs. For that reason I've subtracted one star. As many other reviewers have mentioned, many episodes freeze somewhere in the middle, and no amount of cleaning does any good. I usually have to move ahead to the next episode, then rewind back to where the scene froze, which is a bit annoying to say the least! Another annoyance is that the menu only gives the first four episodes on each side; the viewer has to start at the beginning of the disc and fast forward to get to the other four. All in all, the set seems to have been put together rather hastily. For example, there are errors in some of the titles. The episode listed as ""Our Cook's Treasure"" is supposed to be ""Our Cook's a Treasure"". OK, it's a minor mistake, just one word, one letter really, but still...

All in all, however, it's delightful to be able to see these classic shows again, with Hitchcock's dry, often hilarious introductions preceding each, and for the price, I guess a skip or two can be excused!",1146182400,9,1131,4.517073170731707

It would have been nice if single sided dvds had been used, but the decision not to do that is one I can live with.

What I disliked (and that's why I say 4 stars) is on each episode page the description serves as a spoiler, usually giving away every detail except the final surprise. I don't even look at those until after I've seen the episode.

2389657,4,B000AL733G,"I received this as a gift during Christmas, and have just recently begun watching them.  The series, ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents,"" is superb. Each episode holds up well, and have terrific twist endings. As other reviewers have cited, DO NOT read the plot synopses written before each episode begins, as some of them DO reveal the ending. (What bonehead at Universal decided to do that?) Hence, my 4-star rating.

But unlike many of the other reviews, (which I am sure are accurate, given Universal's track record) -  I find the quality of the discs to be fine. I'm already onto my third disc, and have not had a single problem with any skipping, freezing, or jumping back to menus.  (I own a Denon DVD player)

The quality of the prints is also fine - and although not as perfect as the Twilight Zone Definitive Collections, these prints aren't awful. They're sharp, but they're not perfectly clean.  The audio is compressed, and sounds peculiar for some of the episodes on my home theater - but otherwise clean and understandable.

The price is terrific considering the amount of shows included, in comparison to the pricey Twilight discs, and other DVDs.  We're talking 39 EPISODES. And it's cheaper to get the DVDs instead of even downloading all of these off of Apple's Itunes for the video Ipod. (It'll currently run you $55 for the entire season on Apple)

Ultimately, it sounds like it's a gamble -- you either have a fine boxed set, or a bad one. Let's hope Universal is reading these comments, and they don't make the same mistake if/when they come out with Season 2. I for one am keeping my fingers crossed that they will!!  Alfred Hitchcock remains one of the finest directors and hosts ever.

I mean, DVDs are cheap, make it six regular discs, and charge an extra 2 dollars.  Its worth it not to have these problems.....otherwise, the shows are great, one show out of the 39 did not have Alfred narrate in the beginning, is this the way that episode was made, or did they make a mistake when putting them to disc?  I don't know, it was the episode with Thelma Ritter.  Very enjoyable shows, each with a twist at the end. I think the best part of the show is Alfred himself, his dry humor is priceless!

First season stand out episodes include ""A Bullet for Baldwin"" concerning a murder victim (Sebastion Cabot) who will not stay dead.  The excellent ""The Older Sister"" gives an interesting spin on the Lizzie Borden case.  And there is ""Back for Christmas"" where John Williams murders his wife, buries her in the basement and then gets a rude surprise.  And ""The Creeper"" a really scary story about a serial killer targeting women during a New York heat wave.

But as good as these stories are the treat of each episode was always the humorous openings and closings provided by the Mr. Hitchcock.  Often due to the censorship of the time Hitch would explain how the episode's bad guy who seemingly got away with it was actually caught.

If this collection has any drawn backs it is that the picture quality and sound could have really been better.  And even more criminal Hitch's introduction to one episode is actually missing.

I was afraid Universal was going to skimp on quality.  I was right.

Look, enough with the double sided discs.  IMAGE has managed to thrill fans and dvd collectors with their treatment of THE TWILIGHT ZONE and the DICK VAN DYKE SHOW.  Both of these shows had a minimum number of episodes per disc, each disc separately packaged in a slimline case, and extras alotted to each individual episode.  They played like a dream, and were terrific fun to watch and collect. For this, IMAGE asked a higher, and fair, price.

Universal, please, listen.  Do it right and charge us what you need to.  We only want archival and quality prints of ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS with all available extras.  The episodes should be properly spaced out on single sided discs, and we'll be grateful for whatever oddities are stored away if you slap them on there as extras.  Produce a high quality product, and the millions of Alfred Hitchcock fans will pay for it.

One of the key things about Hitchcock is the plot twist at the end of the show that comes from nowhere and sets things in a whole new direction. When you choose ""Episode Index"" and then choose the episode you want to see, an episode summary comes up. The summary tells the entire episode, right down to the plot twist! I read the first two or three thinking it was just an error, but then found it gave everything away. Now I just save reading those for AFTER I've watched the episode so the suspense isn't ruined. I know they probably pulled those descriptions from a book somewhere, but it would have been nice if they'd trimmed them down or put some kind of warning on there of spoilers.

Other than that, it's a great series. Not every show is a winner, but there are some great moments in here. Ray Bradbury even wrote  the script for an episode (""Shopping for Death""), though it's unfortunately not one of the better ones. Hitch himself directed a couple, and they show his flair for the cinematic.

I also agree that the ""bonus"" material is pretty much a throw away, of no great interest or insight.

I did not have any problems with the playback, and this is on a DVD player that seems to have a lot of skips with things I get from the video store.  I thought the sound and video quality was decent--not perfect, but pretty good.  I have no idea as to whethere this is the best that could be done.

The ITune quality actually seemed really good.

The episode quality--acting and writing--varies quite a bit to me.  Some are great.  I agree that many of the ""trick"" endings seem kind of predictable and corny.  The acting seems largely overacted.  I guess I am saying that they seemed pretty dated, which is appropriate, I suppose, given that this is a 50-year-old TV show.

These are not like, or generally up to, a Hitchcock film.  Lots of famous actors though, and they are fun to watch.

It is a shame that Universal would edit episodes or opening and closing remarks by Hitchcock.  On the other hand, for my purposes, I would like a way to skip easily over Hitchcock's discussions.  I find them distracting.  I am not sure why Hitchcock would find the need to make a joke of every episode, when some are quite good and develop a really feel and atmosphere, and Hitchcock's remarks break the spell.

I think the comparison with Twilight Zone is a very revealing and interesting one.  It is a little difficult, because I am very familiar with TZ, and has have just come back to AH with this first season. TZ's range seems much broader, and it is clearly sci-fi and fantasy, whereas AHP is limited to mystery, and limited to murder mystery at that.  TW has been criticized for being preachy.  No question that Rod Serling had more of a message, and had a more serious tone.  Even where AH has a point, which does not seem all that often, he distances himself in the before and after monologue.  Both shows can seem dated.

In my view, however, TZ at its best blows AHP away, and it is the much more important TV series.  TZ is more thought-provoking and serious, and, I would expect, boundary pushing and influential.  AHP seems like a very good TV show.  Not particularly trendsetting.  Not particularly important to the development of TV.

In an event, these disks have some great TV, that is a great bargain.  I, too, look forward to the remaining seasons on DVD.",1136160000,4,2506,4.492239467849224

Having said that, though, I have to agree with other reviewers who had problems with the picture freezing up. This has happened to me during two episodes: ""The Gentleman From America"", and ""The Belfry"". Try as I might, I cannot get these two episodes to run all the way through without the image going ""cubist"" on me. (Good thing this didn't happen during ""BREAKDOWN"", or I might have had one as well.

Since I've only seen one fourth of the shows, it makes me wonder what other problems I'll have with these discs.

Congrats to those lucky people who didn't have any problems with the disks. You were lucky- this time...

The quality control is definitely lacking somewhere back at the plant.

ALSO: The packaging should come with a caveat: ""WARNING!!"" If you really want to enjoy this show, DO NOT READ THE PLOT SYNOPSIS!!"".

2389674,2,B000AL733G,"Universal's poor dvd quality has once again ruined a much anticipated viewing experience for me.  So far, I've played the first 5 episodes,  and 2 of them have frozen up mid-way. This is the same problem I had with their ""FRANKENSTEIN"" and ""MUMMY"" box sets. Looks like the double-sided discs just plain SUCK.  The problem is,  you can't really return these discs, only exchange them, so there's no guarantee the next set won't freeze just as bad in a different location.  The earlier reviewer that stated it must be the fault of the DVD player couldn't be more wrong.  I own 4 machines of various qualities and ages, and these discs freeze on all 4.  After this, I won't be purchasing Universal double-sided discs again.

However, the ""twists"" that end most of the shows do not hold up as well as The Twilight Zone; there are some quality problems - there were parts when the DVD would freeze as my player tried to correct errors; I'd suggest that you make sure not to read the synopsis prior to each episode.

2389676,1,B000AL733G,was really excited to see that the classic series' first season was available on dvd.  totally bummed out when i threw it in the garbage.  disgraceful that universal could take such classic cinema and put it on a horribly constructed double-sided dvd set.  got tired of the frustration of seeing half an episode and then having the dvd go back to play on its own (disk 2 was particularly bad).  very angry.  will never buy another universal dvd again.,1132704000,47,451,4.658227848101266
2389677,5,B000AL733G,"The best bargain on Amazon.com by far.  Beautiful presentation of a classic series and at a very fair price. One qualm: the synopsis at the beginning of each episode (""play"") basically ruins the twist ending.  If you read it BEFORE viewing the episode, then you have spoiled the suspense. Read the synopsis AFTER you view the episode.",1132531200,40,334,4.842105263157895
2389678,5,B000AL733G,"I purchased a copy of this DVD set and the quality is magnificent.  The menu screens are flawless, and this is a welcome addition to any collection.  Forget the nit-pickers who claim there are problems with playing these DVDs, Universal spent a lot of money putting this set out and I had no problem with them personally. The only gripe I have is that the documentary only includes three interviews with people involved and one was Hitchcock's daughter to had very little involvement with the show.  You would think a show like this would have been treated to more bonus features.

One thing I do want to recommend, if you buy this DVD set, also buy the book THE ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS COMPANION by Martin Grams and Patrik Wikstrom.  The book is 660 pages thick and is extremely thorough in detailing and documenting each and every episode.  The index is 40 pages thick (that's how detailed it is). This book is available on Amazon also so treat yourself and buy both at the same time.  Want to know how good it really is?  As any book should be, it includes a detailed history of the series, memories from exclusive interviews with almost everybody who participated with the series from Sidney Pollack, Vincent Price and Norman Lloyd. Each episode is covered in detail, cast includes the names of the fictional characters they played, and Hitchcock's opening and closing remarks are printed and even better, the opening and closings he did for the U.K. airings where he made fun of Americans rather than the sponsors. If you want a book that will answer every freakin' question you have about this series - such as what was really in ""the jar,"" - then this is the book for you. Five stars!

Every time I watch an episode, I read an entry in the book.  That's how I enjoy the series.  Grab both the DVD set and the book and have fun.",1132358400,39,1836,4.567073170731708
2389679,5,B000AL733G,"Growing up in the 70's, I was drawn to two shows above all others;  Twilight Zone and Hitchcock Presents.  While Twilight Zone may be the better of the two overall, Hitchcock Presents is a close second.  Taking into account the somewhat outrageous prices for the Twilight Zone sets, I feel this is the much better value.

Transfers seem great (for their age), and I actually like the two sided disks because they cut down on space.

As others have noted, the summaries of each episode do give away too much of the plot (I stopped reading them entirely).

Overall, probably the best value in the Tv Dvd releases I have purchased!",1130198400,12,628,4.612612612612613

Well, I watched all of them & either Universal remade the DVD'S or the people who said that the shows froze & skipped or didn't work at all need to clean their DVD players or get new ones! The shows played perfectly & they look good! I saw some editing (nothing to fall apart over). Alfred came on in the beginning & the end of every episode except one:( The Baby sitter). The reviewer that said breakdown was the worst they had ever seen is also wrong! I paid close attention to that one & it looks great!( remember these shows are 50 years old)!There are some slight gliches before the show but, nothing to worry about. Everything I read that was bad about the shows is not on the DVD'S.  Some of them even say: brought to you by Bristol Meyers. I don't know what those reviewers are talking about! I'm very happy with my Alfred Hitchcock DVD'S & I can't wait for season 2. I hope it comes out soon.$ 30.00 dollars is a great price for 39 episodes.

Case: nice, but tough to get the double-sided disks out-- can't someone come up with a better way that this?

2389682,4,B000AL733G,"One of the year's great DVD bargains -- all 39 episodes from Hitch's first season on TV, working out to a buck a pop at full retail.

Already a master film director, Hitchcock let his pal and agent Lew Wasserman convince him to try his hand at U.S. television. This series, which began in 1955 and ran in some form for a decade, turned Hitch into a star, mostly on the strength of his one-man skits that opened and closed the shows. The black-comedy bits were ""the vessel in which to promulgate (his) mad ideas,"" said actor Norman Lloyd, who worked as an associate producer.

Hitchcock approved all of the scripts for ""tonight's play,"" some based on short stories, others originals from such top writers as Ray Bradbury, Roald Dahl and Robert Bloch. Hitch directed his share of episodes (famously, 1958's ""Lamb to the Slaughter). Lloyd said every creative decision was about, ""Are we reflecting the Hitchcock persona?""

Producer Joan Harrison, who immigrated to Hollywood with the Hitchcocks, roped in some of the best actors of the day. Season 1 stars included Joseph Cotton, Claude Rains, John Cassavetes, Cloris Leachman, Gene Barry, Charles Bronson and John Forsythe. These are fine shows, varied, literate and sometimes way dark for '50s TV.

The sole extra of note is a so-so documentary directed by Laurent Bouzereau. Hitchcock's actress daughter Pat (who appears in some of the episodes), assistant director Hilton A. Green and Lloyd do the recollecting.

It's great that Universal put the season out as a piece, given the series' crazy-quilt DVD releases in the past. Alas, there are some problems. The menu's episode summaries are sometimes dead wrong (""Salvage"" for example) and give away key plot points. Avoid like the plague. Video and audio are OK, nothing special. I haven't played all of the (double-sided) DVDs but one disc froze in the middle of the episode ""Don't Come Back Alive"" and refused to budge despite various attempts to get it going again. Some Amazon reviewers have noted this problem; others haven't experienced it.",1129680000,19,2047,4.973684210526316
2389683,4,B000AL733G,"""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" first aired on network TV on October 2, 1955, when television was quite young indeed. This anthology drama/suspense series was very popular and was on the air for seven seasons (spanning 268 black-and-white episodes), with the series ending in June 1962. One of those episodes never actually aired in prime-time (""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"", which was released on VHS videotape by ""GoodTimes Home Video"" in 1998).

Mr. Hitchcock, in September of 1962, then turned his half-hour series into ""The Alfred Hitchcock Hour"", which had a pretty successful TV run all its own (3 seasons and 93 hour-long dramas).

Universal Studios Home Entertainment released ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents Season One"" as a 3-Disc DVD set on October 4th, 2005 (coinciding almost perfectly with the 50th anniversary of the show's debut). It's nice to have all 39 of these teleplays from Mr. Hitchcock's first TV endeavor available in one compact DVD collection.

Some buyers of this set are far from pleased with the quality of the DVD transfers (and the double-sided DVD-18 software itself, which gives some players fits it seems). But, in my own personal opinion, I don't think there are enough serious gripes with this Hitchcock set to warrant not purchasing it.

I haven't experienced a single ""freeze up"" on the DVDs either (as yet). Every episode has played perfectly all the way through on my Panasonic player.

The episodes look very nice on these DVDs (especially for a program that is now a half-century old). The program entitled ""Breakdown"" has some major ""vertical-line"" problems and dirt blemishes in some portions of the show (mainly during the opening titles and the Hitchcock intro, which look fairly bad), but even that episode clears up nicely for the bulk of the story. A fine ep. too, featuring the great Joseph Cotten.

Other episodes I've watched seem to be very good in overall video quality. The audio, in Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono (English only), sounds a bit harsh, particularly the opening theme music. But that's not a big deal, IMO. Dialogue comes through well, however.

Classy DVD packaging too. A nice ""two-toned"" kind of cover, with raised lettering for the show title; plus some nice black-and-white pics on the interior parts of the Digipak that's used to house the three DVDs.

The droll witticisms of Mr. Hitchcock are fun to experience at the beginning and end of each show. The ending to ""The Case Of Mr. Pelham"", where Hitch has to do a little acting himself, is one of my favorites. (""Bubble gum in his pocket indeed!"") :)

I'm not thrilled, though, about the fact that a few portions of Mr. Hitchcock's intros and epilogues (aka ""lead-ins"" and ""lead-outs"") have been trimmed off of these episodes for the DVD release. Some of this editing was no doubt done for continuity sake, to eliminate the references by Hitchcock to the upcoming sponsor's message. I wish, however, that every second of each program had been included on these discs, but I'm not exactly ready to slash my wrists with a dull razor either due to a few missing seconds here and there.

The aforementioned ""Mr. Pelham"" episode, starring Tom Ewell, is one of my all-time favorite ""AHP"" programs during this first (or any other) season of the series. And it looks absolutely sensational on this DVD. Gorgeous video quality on that one.

When perusing the complete roster of shows contained in this first-season AHP set, I've found quite a few really top-flight episodes (that I hadn't realized were all aired during the very first year of Hitchcock's series before getting this DVD collection). Such as:

>> ""Premonition"", with John Forsythe and Cloris Leachman.
>> ""The Cheney Vase"", featuring Carolyn Jones and Darren McGavin.
>> ""Back For Christmas"", starring John Williams.
>> ""The Creeper"", with Constance Ford.

""The Creeper"" really gives off some eerie vibes. It's ""creepy"" alright, and showcases the fine acting abilities of Constance Ford, Reta Shaw, Steve Brodie, and Harry Townes. And when Percy Helton is also tossed into the cast mix, you know you're in for a frightful time. Mr Helton, who popped up in guest roles on many TV shows of the 1950s and 1960s, radiates a kind of built-in unnerving eeriness that makes him perfect as ""George"" in the ""Creeper"" episode. Helton, who reminds me a lot of Peter Lorre, doesn't usually play villains in his TV appearances, however -- he just gives you the impression that he might turn out to be one whenever he shows up.

Helton, who died in 1971, appeared in a great number of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" episodes, including several in this first season alone. Helton might also be remembered as the drunken Santa Claus at the beginning of the original ""Miracle On 34th Street"" (1947) -- which only proves my point that he's not usually a villain on screen. :-)

Here now is a quick ""Pros"" and ""Cons"" breakdown of this ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Season One"" DVD boxed set:

PROS:

>> 39 (almost) uncut episodes on three DVDs, packed in a handsome, slender, easy-to-store Digipak case.

>> Very good picture quality (everything considered).

>> ""Play All Episodes"" option is here.

>> English and Spanish subtitles are included.

>> A nice little bonus featurette is also included (""Alfred Hitchcock Presents: A Look Back""), featuring interviews with Pat Hitchcock, Norman Lloyd, and Hilton Green. Laurent Bouzereau produced this 2005 DVD supplement, which is fairly short (at 14:44), but quite fun to watch. English and Spanish subtitles are available for this featurette, too.

>> A handy quick-reference ""Episode List"" is provided on all sides of all three discs, which lists the episode titles for all 39 shows in the DVD set and the corresponding disc side where each program can be found. (An episode guide is also available on the inner Digipak case, which is even a faster method of locating a particular episode, because that entire guide is printed all on one case flap. Whereas the ""List"" on the actual DVDs takes up three different Menu screens.)

>> Easy-to-navigate, non-animated Menu design.

CONS:

>> Some of the prologues/epilogues have been edited/trimmed.

>> No Chapter Breaks at all for any of the episodes.

>> Some episode descriptions on the DVD Menus are way too detailed, giving away crucial plot points of the story.

>> Looped ""Hitchcock Theme"" music plays continuously on Main Menu screen. It's pretty shrill-sounding here too. (Having it play just once and then quit would have been much better. Or, better still, just have the Menu totally silent to begin with.)

-------------

In the final ""All-Things-Considered"" analysis -- I think these Hitchcock TV episodes are terrific and, for the most part, look just great on these discs. Even with a few edits here and there, I'm still enjoying watching these programs that were aired right smack in the middle of the so-called ""Golden Age Of Television"". And after seeing many of these wonderfully-written episodes, it's easy to see why such a ""Golden Age"" tag has been attached to TV shows from that 1950s era.

Even though this DVD set is not 100% perfection, I certainly don't want to deprive myself of these 39 Hitchcock TV gems. Do you?",1129507200,26,7179,4.982426778242678
2389684,5,B000AL733G,"I decided to write a review because I read all the others and none of them mention what I noticed.  It's not a big deal really, I actually thought it was funny.  I have watched the first 14 episodes and of them the show synopsis at the beginning is wrong on about half of them.  I really don't believe whoever wrote them watched the shows, or at least got correct info.  Check out 'Santa Claus and the 10th Avenue Kid' to see what I mean, I believe that was the synopsis that was the most wrong.  And I do agree with a previous reviewer - sometimes the synopsis does give away important story points - I watch the show, then read the synopsis.  It's turned into kind of a game, to see how close they can get to what the story is actually about.  Besides that this is a great bargain, and having only seen about 10 episodes of this show before I was really looking forward to seeing more.  There was only one of the first 14 episodes I didn't care for, the rest were great.  I hope I don't encounter the double-sided disc problems I've read about here, but as for show editing and sound and picture quality I've never seen these before and they're all fine to me.  It's an old TV show, I expected it wouldn't be perfect.  I thought the documentary was very interesting too.",1129507200,17,1272,4.258333333333334
2389685,5,B000AL733G,"This is my thought about this Alfred Hitchcock Presents set.
I am extremely happy to be able to finally watch the first season of this show. I have not seen it in years anytime or anywhere on a network station. So far I have enjoyed them without any problems. I mus admit that I do not like double sided disks, but I do own them in such series as THE OUTER LIMITS and GILLIGANS ISLAND. As long as they play without scratching, I'm still okay with it, especially when the price is very reasonable.
I have no complaints about the quality of the programs. Actually, considering how old they are, I believe they look great and I truly enjoy Alfred's fine and sometimes hlarious beginning and ending comments.
I highly recommend this set if you are a fan of the show. I sincerely hope that UNIVERSAL will release every season of this outstanding series as well as the newer version of the show which had old series beginnings and endings pasted onto it with new plays. Once a show begins, I certainly would hope to see ALL of the episodes come out on DVD.
This set is a companion to all of Alfred's films which I also have collected over the years. Alfred Hitchcock has strived to be a great storyteller and so far I have not been disappointed.",1129334400,10,1239,4.414847161572053
2389686,2,B000AL733G,"The previous reviewer Winston is correct that ""Breakdown"" is indeed in the set.  However, it should also be noted that ""Breakdown"" is probably the worst looking TV episode ever released on a major DVD set.  It is full of the kind of dropout lines that you're used to seeing on a deteriorating VHS tape, and it almost looks as if a deteriorating VHS tape were the source material used for that episode!

Other episodes in the set look fine but there are as others have noted some serious problems with the editing of Hitchcock's prologue/epilogue sequences in many episodes.  One episode ""Baby Sitter"" with Thelma Ritter is missing Hitchcock's prologue entirely and goes straight to the episode after the theme music!

But the trimmings in the prologe/epilogue sequences isn't the worst problem in Universal's shoddy presentation of this show.  If one wishes to bypass the ""Play All"" feature and watch individual episodes, one will find an episode summary that in the case of EVERY episode manages to reveal more plot details, including the payoff twists in quick fashion which would totally ruin the experience for those who are trying to experience these episodes for the first time.  Universal should fire the person who was hired to write these summaries because they are the worst examples of giving away the key details of a story I've seen since the first Planet of the Apes DVD used cover art that gave away the ending of the film.

In the end, if you have a machine that doesn't give you the freeze-up problems that have plagued so many other Universal titles, you should still get this, but be warned that this isn't the kind of set this title deserved.  Shame on Universal for such an appalling job.",1129248000,35,1709,4.785714285714286
2389687,5,B000AL733G,"Gooood evening!  Wow, what a great set this is.  Don't listen to anyone who says these are not excellent quality.  Remember these shows are 50 years old!  The quality of these are FANTASTIC!! If you like this show you will be very happy with this set. I can't wait for all of these to come out.  Good night!",1129075200,4,307,4.224137931034483
2389688,1,B000AL733G,"After being thrilled to find this classic Hitchcock series available, we are also plagued with problems of episodes freezing and being impossible to watch.

Universal always seems to have been the low-budget studio, compared to Warner and Paramount, and it seems their low-ball production methods are now leading to flawed dvds.

I recommend never buying one of their products unless you find sufficient reviews to show they have improved their quality-control and production standards. Whatever minor saving Universal gained from cheapo production standards is going to cost them in negative brand recognition and bad word-of-mouth. Beware!",1128988800,51,641,5.666666666666667
2389689,1,B000AL733G,"$27.99 may seem like a good price for 39 episodes of a terrific show like this, but never forget that if it sounds too good to be true - it usually is.  I've been looking forward to this show being released on DVD for such a long time, but not like this.  Not on two-sided discs that freeze up constantly, and not with crucial footage cut out.  And, though less importantly, not with a dearth of special features.  Such a schlocky presentation is more worthy of a show like ""Britney and Kevin: Chaotic,"" not a classic gem like ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents.""  Some people still seem to think this set is a bargain.  Pleather shoes may seem like a bargain, since they're low-priced.  The problem is, they're still pleather.  I for one demand quality and am willing to pay for it.  They could have done a much better job restoring the show and transferring it onto discs of higher quality.  $27.99 is no bargain when the product is so poorly made.  I've ordered this disc set but I'm returning it for a refund.  I might rent it sometime since the episodes are mostly intact except for some of Hitchcock's concluding remarks, but I don't want to pay to own this show until they get it right.  It is a major affront to Hitchcock and his fans to slaughter his show this way.  Fans of other classic oldie shows such as ""The Twilight Zone"" or ""I Love Lucy"" are willing to pay more for high-quality DVD sets of those shows, and I'm sure fans of ""AHP"" are no different.  I hope they will make improvements to this release sometime in the future.  I want uncut episodes!

  I would give five stars for the show itself, which is absolutely brilliant, but since I'm rating this item as a product, I give it only one.

P.S. I own the book ""The Alfred Hitchcock Presents Companion,"" which includes summaries of each episode Hitchcock's fully transcribed monologues from each show. The book is poorly written, has many spelling errors, and many times where the writer clearly heard the dialogue wrong in his transcriptions, but it is a least a good companion, as it purports to be, to the show. I've watched (Netflixed, not bought) the first four seasons on DVD, and can confirm that most of Hitchcock's pre-commercial messages have been cut from the DVDs (which sucks, because I'm certain they were included when the show used to air on TVLand). It might seem unnecessary, since obviously there are no ads on the DVDs, but it would still have been nice since Hitch always had some delightfuly devilish new way to mock the hands that fed him, i.e his sponsors (it was cool when they showed these on TVLand because they always aired an old-timey ad directly after these remarks). Still a great show and fun to watch, but no way I will purchase rather than rent if all these gems have been discarded.",1128988800,116,2780,4.544176706827309
2389690,4,B000AL733G,"As much as I enjoyed this set there are a couple of issues I have to be upfront about; 1) It appears that some of these episodes have been edited. I'm not referring to the syndicated versions that floated around for years either. Evidently some of the ending comments that Hitch made prior to the final credits rolling have been trimmed. I'm not exactly sure who did this or why but it will be disconcerting for ""Presents"" fans expecting the original broadcast episodes. I pointed out that ""Breakdown"" was missing in a previous review--it turns out the copy I had was defective and wouldn't play that episode or even access it from the main menu. Happily the new version I was sent does play ""Breakdown"" one of my favorite of Hitch's directed episodes.

 2) These have been released on the nefarious DVD18 dual sided dual layered discs. On the one hand it's more compact than other sets and maximizes the amount of shows available in the set; Universal has been having major problems with many of their DVD18 releases freezing up and being unplayable because of quality control issues in the manufacturing of these discs. I did have one disc freeze up but the returned copy seems to be fine. The DVD18s do have their fair share of problems because they are pressed three times vs. the normal two so the incidence of flaws are higher.  To be fair, Universal has taken great care with this set doing a marvelous job with just about everything (although a booklet with each episode listed, actors, writers and directors would have been helpful as well as a plot synopsis much like ""The Outer Limits: Season One"" set did). While manufacturing snafus can get any studio producing any DVD (I went through three ""Star Trek: Enterprise: Complete Season Three"" sets before finding one where there were no manufacturing/playing issues), Universal has been hit particularly hard by them. I'm not sure if it's because of QC issues with their plant in Mexico but the nature of DVD18's make them risky to begin with. Nevertheless, this is a good value for what you're getting.

Not much restoration went into these episodes as there are a considerable amount of scratches and dirt. The sound is occasionally distorted but, on the whole, the episodes look pretty good and sound pretty good as well.

All of these episodes were produced originally in black and white (color TV was not the standard in 1955 when these shows were shot and produced) and while there is noticeable grain it's not any larger an issue here than any other vintage series from the same time frame. There are occasional white flecks and bits of dirt that crop up during the opening title or during episodes but they are minimal. Clearly some of these episodes are going to look better than others depending on the condition of the show. Quality vaired quite a bit throughout the set but it's good overall. The set would have been improved with chapter stops within each episode and placing a chapter stop after the opening titles would be nice as well. The mono sound doesn't offer much potential for improvement but Universal has done a fine job of insuring that it has nice presence, appears without distortion and that the dialogue comes across with remarkable clarity. This isn't a set that's designed to work out your home theater system but it was never intended to anyway.

The first season set comes with a fine featurette with actor/producer/director Norman Lloyd who was associate producer for the first season before being promoted to full producer in 1957. Lloyd worked closely with producer Joan Harrison (a long time Hitchcock collaborator who contributed to many of Hitch's screenplays going as far back as ""Rebecca"") and discusses the challenges of producing a weekly series during the 50's that needed to meet cinematic standards. Make no mistake while this is a TV series, Hitch's episodes and many of the other ones as well demanded creative direction, writing and strong performances to sell these shows to a skeptical public that could be watching something else. Network TV dominated the airwaves during the 50's so while there were limited options there was always something else on. Lloyd comments about Hitch's comically concise assessment of each week's episode (which he viewed prior to airing). If he thought it was terrific he'd comment ""good"". If he felt it was subpar he would simply say ""thank you"" as he left the screening room. Lloyd and producer Harrison ran the show submitting the stories they selected for production send them up to Hitchcock to read and approve. If they didn't hear anything they knew they had passed the test. Hitch's daughter Pat Hitchcock O'Connell also appears during the featurette discussing the working conditions on her father's show. She appeared in a number of episodes (and also her father's films ""Strangers on a Train"" and ""Stage Fright"" prior to the series as ""Psycho"" during its run before retiring to raise her family). Her insightful comments on her father's commitment to high quality brings further appreciation from this viewer who grew up watching this show in syndication. She also discusses the history of the show and those who worked on the series including the late Joan Harrison.  Assistant Director Hilton Green discusses the production of the practical day-to-day side of things. He also discusses why ""Presents"" went from a half hour to an hour during its early run.  All three also discuss Lew Wasserman and the importance of his relationship with Hitchcock. Wasserman first proposed doing the TV show to Hitchcock. Lloyd and Green discuss the importance of writer James B. Allardice to the droll introductory segments and closing comments.

Behind-the-scenes photographs, the reproduction of important scripts that might be in the UCLA archive would be nice additions to future sets. With some of the important talent involved in the show, I'd hope that the papers from the UCLA archive would be scoured for extras. Perhaps we'll see something of the sort in future sets. Again, to give credit where it is due Universal elected to give us bonus materials unlike, say, MGM with ""The Outer Limits"".

Commentary tracks would have been nice and this is another  failing of this set outside of the DVD18 dual sided/dual layered discs and the lack of chapter stops for each episode. While many of the participants have passed away, Patricia Hitchcock, Lloyd, Green and others could have provided one or two commentary tracks on the production of key episodes. Hopefully with luminaries such as Robert Altman, Gordon Hessler, Arthur Hiller and others (at the time of this writing) still with us, Universal will ask them for comments on the episodes they directed (or at the very least include them in future featurettes).

Universal has done a good job transferring these classic episodes of television (there's only so much that can be done to clean up and restore these given the current state of technology). Unfortunately, this series doesn't warrant the full scale restoration that Hitch's films deserve in Universal's eyes. Nevertheless they do look and sound pretty good and fans will be pleasantly surprised at how well the show has held up.",1128816000,17,7188,4.941225165562914

As far as the stories go, they are great. I always loved

this show, BUT, as far as quality goes. TERRIBLE!

They should have done better with this.

Very grainy, scratch lines throughout.

2389692,2,B000AL733G,"When Dragnet, 1967 came out, I bought it. I returned it because the double-sided DVD skipped. I exchanged it. The new one skipped in the identical place. I exchanged it again and the new one skipped in the same place! Is this some mystical coincedence? I think not. Needless to say, I returned it the third time and haven't bought it since. I won't buy it. The first copy of AHP that was sent out skipped side A, Disc 2. The next one better not skip there or I will return it and not buy it again. Its not worth my time to sit through 18+ hours of episodes to find I have to return it AGAIN. Fast forwarding through sometimes misses some skips.

One Universal set had one double sided disc and one single sided disc. Much the same story as Dragnet 1967, I could never get the double sided disc to play right. There was a sticker somewhere that indicated the double-sided disc was made in Mexico without any indication where the single sided one was made. If this is a problem, Universal Home Video, bring jobs back to the US and make discs that work.

If this trend of crummy quality continues, I will never buy another Universal Disc.

If I may speak for the group of us that purchased AHP, Season 1, we're willing to pay more for single sided discs that work reliably. As I have a DVD changer this makes having double-sided discs doubly annoying. As it stands now, going cheap may start losing you customers.

As to the edition:

The transfers and original film stock are acceptable mostly but poor in too many places, the sound is washed out badly and the idea of putting one episode per chapter is asinine. I never have problems with Paramount, or WB (although Fox is a little shaky sometimes), so why are you doing this to us?",1128816000,23,1731,4.38006230529595
2389693,1,B000AL733G,"It's very hard for me to type this, because I thought this was going to be a stellar set -- but alas some episodes are indeed edited.

Example: ""Salvage"" ends with Gene Barry shooting Nancy Gates.  After he pulls the trigger, the next scene on the DVD is Hitchcock saying (after the usual comedy), ""We'll be back next week.""  Then the end credits roll.  I knew something was missing, so I went back to my 10-year-old VHS recording (syndicated TV version) of this episode and played it.  There, Hitch does indeed come back BETWEEN the end of the show and the farewell till next week outro.  It's about 30 seconds of footage with Hitch explaining, ""He would have gotten away with murder, but ...""  This is CRUCIAL footage!  And since it's included in the syndicated TV version, Universal can't say it isn't included on the DVD because the footage is ""lost.""

Sigh.  Why can't Universal get it right?  Double-sided discs are one thing; releasing edited shows is another.  What, exactly, is the problem?",1128816000,191,999,4.710982658959537

""Hitch"" as he was known to many of his closest friends, was a brilliant film maker, who made a flawless and successful transition to the television genre. This 3 DVD set is phenomenal with 39 original half hour episodes that delve deep into the machinations of the human mind. Even today the story lines have great relevance. There really is something for everyone. Unlike Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, which I also like, these storys are realistic mysteries that everyone can identify with. It's a great DVD set at a great price that will give you hours of enjoyment.",1128729600,3,655,4.695652173913044
2389695,3,B000AL733G,"***** for the shows themselves, but only *** for the DVD presentation.  These are the same film transfers that were done over 20 years ago, they are not re-mastered.  You will see film grain, scratch lines, and dirt specks.

Even worse, it looks like Alfred Hitchcock's closings have been edited.  He used to come out at the end of the story to wrap it up and make a remark about the upcoming commercial.  After the break he would come back to say his goodbys and the credits would slide in.  The few episodes I sampled seem to have the pre-commercial appearance after the story EDITED OUT or combined into the next appearance.

""BOO HISS"" Alfred would say about this.",1128643200,24,668,4.563025210084033
2389696,4,B000AL733G,"As a fan of classic Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock presents, these shows were stuff I grew up on in reruns. Thus, it is fantastic to see them rereleased on DVD. I have only minor concerns about the DVD collection. In fact, there are only two. The first is that the menu music featuring the theme song to the program is unusually harsh in terms of sound quality. I am not sure if they left it raw for effect, but, it has the opposide effect on me as being grating. The episode intros are even better than the menu music. Also, the graphics in the menu section seem very plain with no flair. The other minor problem is the double disc presentation with a Side A and Side B. The DVD's could get scratched more easily.

That being said, 39 Episodes for under $35 is a great deal and about the best value you will find out there for a program of this historic importance. The documentary wasn't as in depth as I would have liked at 14 minutes. However, again, the consumer is buying these for the actual episodes and they are as good as remembered.",1128643200,5,1047,4.314720812182741

In response to another person's complaint, I actually don't care much for the bonus material for this.  Just the episodes is perfectly fine for me, and 39 of them!  But here is the problem, I am having trouble getting these to play in my DVD player!  Side A of disc one was fine, after that there are problems.  Side B of disc one would not read, side B of disc 2 will not work and now Side A won't either.  I haven't even tried the others.  Maybe there are some glitches in the first product run of these???  Well, Regardless I'm sure eventually a set of these will work and I highly recomend getting this set without a doubt.  The double sided discs do suck, but i like that there is no waste of materials here.  No BS packaging.",1128556800,4,884,4.141176470588236
2389698,3,B000AL733G,"As a fan of the show, I was looking forward to buying this collection. I began watching Season One yesterday, starting with the ""Bonus Material"", ""A Look Back."" I found that to be rather shallow. Norman Lloyd was particularly annoying (in my opinion) with his recollection of the show. I also found the quality control to be below what I was expecting. For example, if you watch the credits for the first episode, they're ""tearing"", which is a result of a very high video level. How can that be? Then they edited out the commercial ""bumpers"", which is just wrong. I sincerely hope Universal comes up with better bonus material for the rest of the series, like the alternate intros Hitchcock did for the european versions, or the daytime promotional film he did to promote the show to women during the day (in re-runs).",1128556800,8,818,4.6875

I hate them because it's like playing Russian Rulet when buying them. When I say this, I mean, I bought this dvd set yesturday and the first set I had to return because my first disc,side A, was defective and skipped badly. I took it back and thank goodness, the second set played fine. I've had this problem before on a double-sided Universal release of  Abbott & Costello. Beware when you buy this set it may happen to you to. and from what I've read in the past, this has happened to alot of people. This is a great set, believe me ,it's well worth the money, but it's just so annoying when you have to try all the discs out in your dvd player to see if they play good and if they dont, you have to take it back to the store.

2389700,4,B000AL733G,"Just to confirm what a prior reviewer assumed - these 3 discs are double sided and it can be fairly annoying to press the button to release the discs out of their case. I wouldn't be surprised if someone may accidentally break a disc.

These discs make the prior releases of AHP discs outdated, such as those single discs that came with the old Hitchcock DVD sets from Universal.

2389701,5,B000AL733G,"I grew up watching ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" which found a completely unique niche of its own during the Golden Age of television. These stories are unforgettable and each one is superb and the actors in each show are perfect. Many are simple everyday events that take a sudden unexpected twist and throw the people involved into dreadful situations.

Although some of the actors are not well known, they are excellent and actually provide a creepier and more believable atmosphere. Written by the same writers who penned the Alfred Hitchcock magazine, seeing the stories acted out gives them a whole new and fascinating dimension. I pray they also release the Alfred Hitchcock Hour which had many fantastic shows, each one worthy of a feature film designation.

One in particular that scared the hell out of me was the story of two nurses taking care of a rich man in an isolated Victorian house and was truly scary all the way through. At the end, you were literally hanging onto something for moral support it was that terrifying. The one hour format gave Hitchcock time to really develop the story and characters and get the audience ready for the always shocking ending for which he was famous.

Thank God they finally decided to release these gems and now we can see them again and again, and those who missed them the first time around can see what television was like during the time when quality took precedence over any other considerations and producers and directors actually treated their audiences with respect for their intelligence.",1127347200,24,1550,4.908396946564886
2389702,3,B000AL733G,"Season one has 39 episodes and Universal plans to release all episodes on three discs. 39 episodes is a lot to squeeze onto three discs. So, the only was to fit all those episodes is for the three discs to be double-sided. Either that or Universal is using a lot of compression for these episodes, but I doubt it. Universal has a bad history of quality control when it comes to double-sided discs. Just read the reviews of ""The Best of Abbott and Costello"" DVDs. Those are double-sided discs released by Universal and there are a lot of complaints of defective discs. I am a huge fan of Alfred Hitchcock Presents.

2389703,5,B000AL733G,"""Alfred Hitchcock Presents,"" is a classy and smart show for those of us who want something different. In many ways the show mirrors ""The Twilight Zone,"" with its take on mystery, suspense, science fiction, and fantasy. It also contains a good dose of the creep factor. It accomplishes these things without dumbing down its audience. I'm a female in my twenties and I don't agree with another amazon.com reviewer that young people don't watch classic shows and movies. There are some that do appreciate quality entertainment and I'm one of them. I love watching TCM on satellite. I remember a few years ago when TV Land did run a whole weekend of nothing but ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents,"" though it was very rare. I can't wait until the dvds come out, that way viewers like me aren't at the mercy of tv networks.",1126828800,16,810,4.711267605633803
2389704,5,B000AL733G,"A few reviewers have complained the Hitch's little intro and epilouge spots are cut down, and they are right. I have an old bootleg VHS tape of 4 Hitch episodes from the mid-1980s and it has the ""full"" intro/epilouge spots, with the original Bristol-Meyers Squibb advertising slides that appeared as the camera panned from the line drawing to Hitch. If you watch the DVD, you can easily see the film splice as the camera wheels from the end of the epilouge skits to the pen & ink Hitch silhouette-this excised film was a 10 second ad spot with a Bristol Meyers ad slide.  The little bits of cut off dialouge are Hitch poking fun at Bristol-Meyers by name, and for obvious legal reasons these could not be transferred to the DVD. Also, the closing credits featured ad slides and ads for Peter Gunn and other Bristol-Meyers sponsored shows.
  Poor Hitchcock! His fans have stoically suffered the indignity of watching inane,fetid drivel like ""Full House,"" ""Survivor,"" and ""Gilligan's Island"" recieve the full DVD treatment, while Hitch's half-hour masterpieces have been cruelly relegated to early 1990s homemade Nick-at-Nite VHS tape recordings that sell on ebay for $60 an episode.
  Syndicators stopped re-running black-and-white programs altogether in the early 1990s, because most viewers under age 50 will immediatly change the channel when a black-and-white show crosses the screen. Even novelty channels like TV Land eschew black and white shows, with rare exception (Andy Griffith and The Munsters).Thus Hitch's days in re-run are long gone.  Despite an online petition, etc, TVLand has stubbornly refused to air Hitchcock; thus the show has been entirely absent from televison since the mid-1990s. It was always a ""filler"" show when it was on Nick at Nite; I remeber they used to air it from midnite to 12:30, without commercial interruption, though I think the episodes were still cut down from the original tapes. Hitch used to do ad spots at the beginning and end of each little monolouge, which is why these vignettes often seemed ""chopped off"" when the show played in re-runs. I have a Canadian bootleg of a few episodes that were transfered from the master tapes, and these have the full ""Brought to You BY Bristol-Meyers Squibb"" slides during the opening and closing credits, with promo spots for other Bristol Meyers shows like ""Peter Gunn.""
  Hopefully Universal will release the subsequent seasons ASAP. I can't wait to watch ""The Creeper,"" Man from the South,"" and ""Beta Delta Gamma"" again! Rumor has it that the film and sound have been treated to a top-notch restoration. Long overdue!",1125878400,24,2606,5.03016241299304
2389705,5,B000AL733G,"First of all I want to state that ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS is a superbly entertaing program.  Hitchcock himself did not want to host his own television program until 1955, when Lew Wasserman, then head of Universal Studios (then known as Universal International), convinced Hitchcock to market his name and his movies by hosting his own television series.  Thus ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS was born.

Hitchcock himself directed four of the 39 episodes of the first season.  There is a book, authorized through Universal, entitled THE ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS COMPANION by Martin Grams and Patrik Wikstrom, with a foreward by Patricia Hitchcock, Hitchcock's daughter. This book was published two years ago and is 660 pages thick and highly detailed covering everything you could want to know about the program.

This book is also available on Amazon so when you buy Season One of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, I recommend you buy the book as a companion piece. My only question is whether the DVD will feature the alternative openings Hitchcock filmed. You see, the program became so popular that three different openings and closings were filmed for most of the episodes.  One in English, one in French (Hitchcock could speak French), and the other also in English but instead of making fun of the sponsors, he made fun of the Americans cause when the show aired in Britain, those alternative openings and closings were aired overseas.  I only hope Universal features the alternative versions.  Thankfully the book I described lists those alternatives.",1123027200,65,1549,5.192771084337349
