421919,4,6302088135,"This must be one of the best kept secrets of the '90s.  A brilliant film straight to video, what a waste.
I cannot recall how many times I have watched my treasured video of this film but I know it never fails to entertain.
I just want to add my voice to those pleading for a DVD release.",1062201600,19,288,3.9655172413793105
421920,5,6302088135,"Run is a very good movie, I can honestly say that it's the type of movie that once you start it, you don't want to walk away until you see how it ends.  I don't know why it didn't do better than how it has done so far because if it received slightly more exposure I think people would really take to it.  I almost feel as though you are missing out by not seeing this, and as I said in my ""title"" it should be out on DVD.

On my personal top 100 favorite movies list, ""Run"" comes in at #68.  I know what your thinking...68!...that's it!  Well considering that there are 1000's of movies out there, to even rank on a top 100 at all is pretty nice, I think.",1054339200,3,655,3.9318181818181817
421921,4,6302088135,I saw the preview for this video at the beginning of another video I rented one night and I thought it looked kind of exciting so I thought I'd give it a try.  I was very impressed.  The movie was fairly well acted by a very earnest Patrick Dempsey and the story moved along at a very believable pace.  I would guess that there was a very modest budget for this straight-to-video release but I felt that the director got as much out of his budget and his actors as possible.  The action was quick and exciting without being frenetic and the actors and the story was actually fairly believable.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who desires a night of simple fun escapism.,994636800,4,677,4.384
421922,4,6302088135,"Different from most of Patrick Dempsey's films, much like ""All the Right Moves"" feels like a grittier movie for the early Tom Cruise.  The production quality is excellent for the moderate budget that it appears the movie was made on.  I still enjoy watching this movie today!",975542400,,275,4.829787234042553
421923,4,6302088135,"The film was different in the way he ends situations on where he,s under threat but inadvertently escapes the mafia while still on the run. Excellent plot.",946080000,,155,4.777777777777778
421974,2,6302088135,"I swear I remember liking this movie back in the day, but cheesy and bad now.",1438819200,,77,3.875
421975,1,6302088135,will not play .period,1438128000,,21,4.5
421976,4,6302088135,"I last watched this in the mid 90's.  It is not available in the US on DVD.  Why not?  This is a really fun chase film.  Once it starts it never lets up.  It is short on running time, pun intended, but it is still worth owning.  It has some great action in it, and Patrick Dempsey plays the victim to perfection.  Not to mention, he can run fast, and he does a ton of it in this film.  He must still be wore out from filming this.  Have a look at ""RUN"".  You will enjoy it for sure.",1437609600,,482,3.7777777777777777
421977,5,6302088135,Dempsey was really great in this movie and there is a lot of action. Very entertaining.,1436572800,,87,4.5
421978,5,6302088135,Had to buy at a premium price as it was older and only 1 available. Worth it to me.,1435363200,,83,3.4210526315789473
421979,5,6302088135,Good movie thank you proper service very pleased,1432080000,,48,5.125
421980,5,6302088135,"A true five star movie. Action, drama, character traits, small town power, but who paid for the car he was to deliver. This movie was actually thrilling from the very beginning. It was in the category of the Die Hard movies and the Harrison Ford political thrillers. Why it was not or has not been released in the USA on DVD is interesting yet so many one star movies are released continually.",1425600000,,393,4.472222222222222

421983,5,6302088135,"One of Patrick Dempsey's good films. Don't understand why this hasn't been released here in the U.S. yet, buy a region free player. Problem solved. Dempsey is Charlie Farrow, law student asked to drive a Porsche to Atlantic City by his boss. Along the way he is introduced to a poker game and local bully Denny Halloran. Denny accidentally hits his head and dies, Denny's dad, local businessman boss wants Charlie dead. And the chase is on. A great film overlooked here in the U.S. Buy it.",1413849600,,489,4.632183908045977

422016,4,6302088135,"Great movie, too bad it's region 2 but it makes no difference, there are plenty of low end DVD players that can be made region free.
Lots of fun and still keeps me on the edge of my seat. It will probably come out in Region 1 eventually but for now I'll take it and get rid of my old copy recorded from cable years ago. Nice quality on DVD and it's official (just not in North America).",1397692800,,386,3.9615384615384617
422017,1,6302088135,I could not view the movie. Because of the Region 2 restrictions. Meaning it does not play on any of my DVD players here in the US. So the movie is worthless.,1393804800,,158,3.96875
422018,5,6302088135,"Come on, this should be on dvd, there are so many bad movies that are, why not a good one like this?",1391212800,,100,3.590909090909091
422019,5,6302088135,"Great Movie!
Saw this one as a rental and loved it. LOTS of action and a great plot.
I recorded it off of TV on VHS and will have to settle for that until it is released on DVD.
I know I am preaching to the choir here but this needs to be released in DVD, as it is one of the biggest sleepers of the decade.",1388016000,,307,3.5970149253731343
422020,5,6302088135,"Great movie, lots of action! I've loved this one for a long time, glad I ordered it here on Amazon. This is a fast paced movie, good action and ya gotta love Patrick Dempsey <3",1380153600,,176,4.057142857142857
422021,1,6302088135,"region 2 Is for foreign countries! Since I live in the United States and you mailed it to the U.S. you should know my dvd player will not play it! This was a birthday gift for my mentally disabled son, who loves Patrick Dempsey and asked for this movie. I was soo
excited to find it, I did not take the time to read what district 2 meant. Very disappointed!!",1376611200,,358,4.128571428571429
422022,1,6302088135,They need to make this Movie Region 1 Specific cause it looks Good and I can't even watch it cause the DVD Player I got wasn't even an All Region Player so Now I gotta Return The Movie along with the Player.,1374019200,,207,3.9523809523809526
422023,4,6302088135,"I liked this movie from the 80s. I've had a tough time trying to find this movie in DVD format for Region 1 but no luck. So I settled with the VHS format. It plays good and sounds good, but it is no DVD.",1356652800,,203,3.6363636363636362
422064,5,6302088135,"Outstanding movie! It's a nonstop thrill ride, never dull not even for a second! A young Kelly Preston lights up the screen! You cannot get this movie on netflix or anywhere else. Amazon rocks and if you like the thriller, action and suspense genre you'll love run!",1355443200,,265,4.659574468085107
422065,5,6302088135,"I had long had this on VHS, but never saw a DVD
version issued in the USA>  Recently I purchased a
DVD player capable of playing PAL standard DVD's. I
was delighted to see this on DVD at last. Someone
commented that this went directly to video, without
a theatrical run. Really? Most films ending up that
way are pretty bad, but NOT this one! This never
lets up in exitement.  Friends, don't complain about
lack of a USA DVD issue, buy a player capable of playing PAL discs. You'll find lots of things domestic
and foreign that are out of print or unissued in the
USA. These players are much more affordable now.",1338768000,6,612,4.359649122807017
422066,5,6302088135,"I've had this on vhs for years and it is one of my all time favorite movies. I rate it a 10 out of 1 to 10. I bought the dvd on the internet and it was a mediocre copy.it came from UK and was in the US format and plays fine. I suspect that it was a bootlegged copy. This is what happens when a great movie is ignored by hollywood. there are hundreds of movies on dvd that I would rate less than a 1 yet great movies like run don't get to dvd.

""run"" is about a kid that is to deliver a car for a car dealer. He has car trouble and to kill some time ends up in a small town hideaway casino. He accidently kills the town czar and casino owners son. All hell breaks loose. He dodges dirty cops and everyone out for the 50K reward on his head by the town czar. kelly preston reluctantly helps him out. Patrick dempsey is the kid that creates havoc all over town. the movies is exciting from start to finish and well directed with a unique and somewhat believable plot. few movies are this entertaining.",1326326400,,998,3.99
422067,4,6302088135,"I really love this old movie, made before Mr. Dempsey became People magazine's sexiest man of the year. I searched and searched for this movie and could never find it, low and behold, I went to Amazon, and there it was. This movie was very exciting, watching this man run from an entire town,I would recommend this movie to anyone, except kids of course.",1325462400,,354,4.546875

422072,5,6302088135,"Did you see its listed as available on the Amazon UK website on DVD?  I don't get it.  You'd think with his newfound popularity, it wouldn't be so difficult to get this excellent movie on DVD.",1167177600,8,192,4.305555555555555

But, if you are able to watch overseas dvds, give this movie a try.  I saw it in theaters when it was released and still remember it being a very good action thriller.  Mob boss thinks Patrick was malicious with his son's death during an illegal poker game.  So, he ""runs"" from getting whacked.  Sounds simple, and it is, but a very underated movie.

FYI - I ordered this DVD from an overseas seller.  It apperently didn't make it here stateside.  But, the seller did refund my order.",1444003200,,629,4.4
