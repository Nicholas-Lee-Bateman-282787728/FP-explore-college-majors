The image is really terrible, and the music really wasn't all that. If you want to see the Chaplin Films in their best format, image and sound (including extra material) go for the Image releases.

I know they are old films, but why even bother to give these bootlegers a profit when the best quality is available and affordable. It seems that this is the copy of the copy of the copy of the copy...! The image jumps up and down, it's just not appealing to watch nor enjoy at all.

I am a Chaplin fan since I was 12 years old. I have seen a lot of his films and documentaries, as well as read a lot of books about him, including his Auto-Biography. I collect his music, films, documentaries and books; and it irritates me to see how some people make a living selling you these classic films at a ridiculous price for a disapointing quality... Sad, but true!

Once you've seen the difference between a restored image and sound quality film of Sir Charles Chaplin, believe me, you'll never come looking for these bad quality films.

Don't throw your money away in this cheap item!",1255392000,3,1219,4.404444444444445
8216432,5,B000V4C0W6,"Just suppose you bought the DVD of Roger's and Hammerstein's classic musical Oklahoma and instead of Gordon MacRae singing ""Oh What a Beautiful Morning"" he sings America's ""Horse With No Name"" and later in the film instead of the chorus of cowboys singing ""Everything's up to date in Kansas City"" they sing Sinatra's ""My kind of town?"" The music is still good, ""but folks it ain't the music wrote for the piece.""
So, why should you watch classic Chaplin without the music originally selected to accompany his films?
Most classic silent films seen today have an added soundtrack of generic music.
Rick Benjamin's ""Paragon Ragtime Orchestra"" is unique. The music you will hear accompanying these timeless Chaplin comedies is the very same music you would have heard sitting in a movie house 90 years ago.
Classic is classic; if you are going to enjoy these comedies do it right, and this Paragon presentation is right.
When you get it, plug it in, turn off the lights and become transported. Don't forget to turn off your cell phones and Blackberries or you'll miss the time-warp.",1227312000,3,1078,4.864130434782608
