6014698,4,B00FMGPWNW,"I love old horror and sci-fi films and I do have a real soft spot for The Beast of Hollow Mountain. For one, it was one of the few stop motion films that didn't feature Willis O'Brien or Ray Harryhausen at the helm. It also has one of my favorite endings in a giant monster film.

Of course looking at it now it is obviously not O'Brien or Harryhausen's work. The effects are rather crude, but oddly memerizing at the same time. There seems to be mixed reviews on this release, but I found that these transfer are just fine. The films look great to good depending on the scene. The colors are bright, the image is clear in most spots, but there are some scratched and lines that pop up occasionally. Some of the outside shots in ""Beast"" are a bit fuzzy, but that can not be helped. It is the way these scenes were filmed.

The thing to remember is these were very cheaply made films and regardless of scratches I doubt anyone has ever seen them  looking better.

The Neanderthal Man is pretty much the same with the opening sequence looking the worst regarding scratches etc. This one is a real HOOT, with so much unintensional laughter my gut was busting. It's really a gem of the times.

So let's see, you get a nice two-fer here at roughly 9 bucks a film (when I ordered it) and very obscure films at that
My biggest disappointment is there are no bonus features. NONE! NO TRAILERS???!  No Nuthin'! ...come on at least give us the trailers!! It's a shame because so little is known about these films it would have been interesting to have even small ""making of ""or ""rememberance"" features of these films.

All and all, if you love these old films and don't have them in your collection, then this is a no brainer. I doubt they'll ever look better than this and if you keep your expectations in reality then you'll be pleasantly surprised by how good they look.",1391817600,19,1863,4.398255813953488
6014699,3,B00FMGPWNW,"Finally the beast from hollow mountain 1956 with double feature the neantherdal man 1953Two superb movies from the 50's arrives on blu ray and dvd combo. This review only pertains to the transfer which are horrifying on the combo,scratches some frame jumping.scream factory and mgm blew it with the transfer. Both blu and dvd are same ,they don't look like they even attempted to clean up these classics. Well I spent my mony on this set but the good news is I have always wanted the beast from hollow mountain one of my favorites .I will give this set stars and two stars for the terrible transfer. Again the reason this set does not get an excellent ratiingis because of the terrible quality. Still these two classics is a must any where in a collection but for now if you want these two like beast then get it and wait hopefully for a criterion to pick up some day.......",1391731200,4,874,4.50314465408805
6014700,4,B00FMGPWNW,"I wrote a review about this last week concerning the late delivery/ out of stock issue. It evidently was deleted by Amazon. My review concerned Amazon's inability to deliver this on the promised date. I got it a week later. The movie hasn't been viewed yet so my comment on that is ...it is a good movie, worth the price. My main concern however is one voiced by another poster about Amazon and the deterioration of service that some Prime members like me have experienced. This was only rectified after I complained to them. Why does Amazon think they can arbitrarily change the delivery conditions? They promise on time delivery and two day free delivery. I, for one, plan on seeing they honor that. As for the movie, watch it, it's good clean fun.",1391126400,,750,4.604477611940299
6014701,5,B00FMGPWNW,"This movie is for fans of 50's Sci-Fi, Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen.

It is a sentimental favorite of mine.

When I was a kid, Guy Madison was a TV Star with his portrayal of WILD BILL HICKOCK. I guess I had seen THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS as well by then. This movie, presented in color, went another step further. It's a melodrama with a rivalry between two men for the affections of Patricia Medina (Mrs. Joseph Cotten at the time). The dinosaur takes his time showing up (special effects are expensive), but, when he does arrive, he does not disappoint. Guy is handsome and heroic. Patricia is stunningly beautiful. The T-Rex is scary, but not too much, so little kids will be okay with it. What more could you want?",1390867200,26,729,4.515151515151516
6014712,5,B00FMGPWNW,"This little gem of a release features two movies( I only bought it for one of the two) The Beast of Hollow Mountain and the Neanderthal man. First, let me say that Beast is from an idea of Willis O'Brian, the man responcible for King Kong. That alone makes this Blu-ray worth owning. As for the other, it is a""B"" grade film from the fifties and is the lesser known of the two films. Now to the film transfer-Excelent! It doesn't get better than this folks,  Beast tells the tale of a surviving T-Rex down Mexico way cut off by a swamp. When the swamp dries out, Dino comes looking for food. The Neanderthal man follows a mad scientist who recreates a way to turn himself into the title character. Boith movies have aged well and are well worth collecting.",1469404800,,755,4.392857142857143

These are not fully restored, but, I'm MORE THAN HAPPY
to own these two movies.
""Beast of Hollow Mountain"" is a Mexican/American co-

The sound is quite good, and the video-quality is excellent...
with the exception of the lead-in and tail-out of the reels. You
can tell when the reel-changes; there are scratches every 17-
minutes... for about 90-seconds.

6014717,5,B00FMGPWNW,"Beast of Hollow Mountain. This is a good B movie. I liked it enough to add it to my collection. A lot of the special effects are cheesy, (A pair of Dinosaur legs that are obviously knee-high rubber boots, a cattle stampede where the cattle are obviously NOT running, (they are walking, and the footage was shot @ a lower frame rate so that when played at regular speed they would APPEAR to be running, etc.)) Other than that, an entertaining Monster movie. Some of the Caballeros are either VERY Brave, Foolish, or Crazy. (Fighting a dinosaur with REVOLVERS?!!) True, it's a smaller type of Dinosaur, (Possibly an Allosaurus, (It's arms are WAY too long for a T-Rex)) But Revolvers? That's like shooting a Tank with a Pellet Gun! (Still a fun movie.)
  The Neanderthal Man. An interesting take on De-Evolution. A ""Mad"" Scientist experiments with a chemical solution that regresses animals to a prehistoric state. After having some success with cats, he decides to experiment on himself, with detrimental results. Again, a B movie, but fun to watch.

6014724,5,B00FMGPWNW,"Let's face facts, folks - most of us have purchased this delghtful double feature for THE BEAST OF HOLLOW MOUNTAIN. A grade C western with the inevitable Mexican stereotypes- 1. Pancho, the fat, tequila-swilling goofball  2. His little, obnoxious kid named Panchito, who you know is just going to be more trouble than he's worth. 3. Sarita, The inevitable attractive woman, who is equally as obnoxious and 4. Enrique, The hot tempered troublemaker who is no good at all. By the end of the film, you're rooting for the ""Beast"" (which looks like an Allosaurus) to get all of them! Enter our square-jawed hero, Jimmy, played by Guy Madison, who makes you wonder why he even bothers hanging around this group of losers until the end of the movie, since the townspeople in this pathetic little Mexican burb, treat the ""gringo"" badly.
 A fair chunk of the film is padded out with some ""touristy"" footage of some stupid local celebration -consisting of people wearing giant papier-mch heads dancing around, while firecrackers are going off. When the inevitable cattle stampede comes roaring through town, I was hoping to see the cows trampling  over the ""giant papier-mch head people""!
Things start picking up about 55 minutes into the film, when we see our first ""victim"" get his (I was cheering!) , screaming as the shadow of the ""Beast"" covers over him. Finally, a few minutes later, a pair of ne'er-do-wells meet their fate as we finally get the first look at the star of the picture - a delightful, snarling dinosaur! (looks like an Allosaurus to me folks, but then I still use the incorrect title, Brontosaurus, for those other big fellas, so don't take my word for it!) After that, we get a lot of excitement that made it well worth the wait to see what happens next! I've never seen a dinosaur of this size run so fast in this type of movie, and I love the way he snarls and wags his tongue, in anticipation of his next meal!
If you love enjoyable bad movies, you're in for a real treat, and I'm so happy that a decent 2.35:1  release of this film has finally been put out on DVD. (I still have my previous, frequently-viewed copy on Laserdisc).
Also, as an added treat, we get NEANDERTHAL, but that's for another review.",1416182400,,2222,4.646310432569974
6014725,5,B00FMGPWNW,"Great pair of B quality, 50's horror films.  The Beast of Hollow Mountain is an English-language U.S./Mexican co-production.  It stars Guy Madison and Carlos Rivas as owners of a south of the border ranch being harassed by a local cattle baron who wants to be king of the region.  The locals keep things interesting with tales of spooky tales of what goes on at Hollow Mountain and its surrounding swamp and quagmire.  Eventually the title beast shoes up to make complicated things worse.  Beautiful photography and color.  Actually filmed in Mexico with some very good Mexican actors in secondary roles.  Unforgettable dialogue: a maid tells a little orphan who doesn't know what happened to his dad, ""Your father was swallowed up by the swamp, now come and join the party"".
The Neanderthal Man is an early 50's horror film about an evolutionary scientist who is experimenting with a concoction that turns cats into sabertooths, his maid into a particularly ugly dame, and himself into the title creature.  Actually he looks more like a sub-human a few million years older than a Neanderthal.  Naturally he gets loose and creates havoc in the rural community.
Both films are excellent quality and this DVD/Blu-Ray release is highly recommended.",1408147200,,1245,5.034146341463415

6014729,4,B00FMGPWNW,"This primeval double feature is highly recommended for Jurassic junkies who love 50's sci fi flicks. The Beast of Hollow mountain boasts beautiful color and sub par special effects with an Allosaurus that has a tongue that would make Gene Simmons envious. Its a western with a dinosaur in it.  Unfortunately the beast does not show up for an hour but after he does its non stop Regis scope for the next 20 minutes.  Whether its tearing the roof off a log cabin or chasing cowboys across the terrain  the beastie never is dull , and that wagging tongue is a feature no other dinosaur before or since has ever exhibited.  The Neanderthal Man stars the amiable Robert Shayne as a bombastic, pig headed scientist out to prove that cavemen were smarter than modern man because they have larger craniums  and therefore could house more brain matter in their heads. Even a 5 year old child could see the illogic in that.  However to prove his point he turns his house cat into a sabre tooth tiger and himself into a primitive murderous beast man. Its Jekyll and Hyde with Jekyll being an unsympathetic ignoramus. The transformation scenes are done in the standard lap dissolve process.  The final transformation is accomplished by using a mask with painted on eyes,  this is how they disguised the stunt man substituting for Shayne for the more strenuous sequences. Actor Robert Shayne must have been getting tips from John Carradine on how to act in a bad movie.  When he is not over the top he is obnoxious but he is never boring.  The quality of the dvd on both movies is excellent and the sound crisp. So pull up a rock and sit down to enjoy these two primitive potboilers.",1398816000,,1670,4.592592592592593

The story marries ranchers against dinosaurs and the locale is Mexico which has some lush costuming and scenery.  The dinosaur looks like stop motion and is pretty good.  Patricia Medina plays the romantic lead to Guy Madison and both of them are really good looking.  It has a whinny kid in it but that is my only complaint.  The other movie, the Neanderthal Man is quite ordinary but with a glass of wine becomes entertaining.  That copy is good as well and is superior to any copy that is out now.  The price is right so if you are replacing older copies than this is the set for you.  Remember it contains both DVD and a Blu Ray disc.",1395705600,,793,4.226666666666667

6014746,5,B00FMGPWNW,"Scream Factory has released the second-best cowboy-combating-dinosaur movie, The Beast of Hollow Mountain, in 1080p high-definition widescreen in its Blu-ray/DVD combo SF/Horror double feature edition. It has been difficult to find The Beast of Hollow Mountain on any kind of disc, and certainly not in its original framed format or without the color bleached bloodlessly out of it.

This cowboy/dinosaur conflict is a way-distant second to Ray Harryhausen's The Valley of Gwangi which starred James Franciscus as the cowboy. But you can't beat the price for two movies that filled outdoor movie screens.

The dinosaur in The Beast of Hollow Mountain is not in Ray Harryhausen's class, nor is it in the class of Willis O'Brien, who had the initial idea for a dinosaur devouring cattle. But the star of the film is Guy Madison, who was Wild Bill Hickok on TV in the early 1950s, so fans of early television westerns don't have any kick about the human part.

This dinosaur may be late to the breakfast table (he doesn't appear until an hour into the film) but he does want to devour more than Sugar Pops -- which Madison blasted with his six-gun aimed right into the camera at the opening of many an episode of Wild Bill Hickok. This was in the days when advertisers could have the cowboy heroes pose with their sponsor's products, whether it was cereal boxes, chewing gum, whatever, while declaring proudly chowing down and endorsing Sugar Pops essential for your health and happiness, or something to that effect.)

6014747,5,B00FMGPWNW,"While these movies are not great cinema, by any means, I found them both very enjoyable.  In particular, the Beast of Hollow Mountain was one of the first giant creature movies that I ever saw on TV, and it starred Guy Madison, a mainstay of Saturday Morning TV. (He had played Wild Bill Hickok.)

I had seen the movie once recently on TV, was surprised to learn it was in color, and was sorely disappointed with the colors I saw.  The monster appeared to be a bright kelly green and his darting tongue (which appears to be twice as long as his head!) was a very bright red, it dominated the scenes with the monster.  This defect has been fixed for the blu-ray, and the film looks just right.  I was very happy with my purchase, and enjoyed watching it very much.

I had not seen the Neanderthal man before.  If you can stop laughing at the special effects, it's a nice tight little movie.  All in all, I enjoyed it a lot.

Beware:  If you show these movies to your friends, they are going to start playing the ""Mystery Theatre 3000"" game on you.  Just take your punishment. You can't stop them.

The quality of the Blu-Ray was excellent and the show was fun.",1394582400,,1159,4.339534883720931
6014748,4,B00FMGPWNW,"Finally I get to see Beast of Hollow Mountain in all its widescreen Cinemascope and Regiscope glory! Apart from a few print scratches varound reel changes the image is perfect. For those unfamiliar with the movie it's an entertaining blend of cowboys and monsters.- like a low budget Valley of Gwangi.
Available previously on DVD, Neanderthal Man isn't such a visual thrill being only black and white and 1.33:1 ratio, but it's a fun little movie nonetheless.",1393977600,,459,4.974025974025974
6014749,5,B00FMGPWNW,"I've been desperately searching for YEARS for a decent legit copy of THE BEAST OF HOLLOW MOUNTAIN. Sadly, I could never find one, even back in the day on VHS tape! Well now, thanks to those cult-loving kids at Shout! Factory, we not only get this fun dinosaur-on-the-loose movie, we also get it in beautiful hi-def Blu-ray to boot! Woot! And although a rather odd pairing, we get the wacky Robert Shayne caveman film, THE NEANDERTHAL MAN, too! :-D

TBOHM is a rather slow-moving film, for those who've never seen it, so don't expect lots of constant, over the top monster action. The title creature only shows up in the final reel. Guy Madison is suitably rugged, if a little bland, as fish-out-of-water white cowboy stud, Jimmie Ryan, trying his luck as an independent cattle rancher south of the boarder. Carlos Rivas plays Felipe, Jimmie's likable Mexican buddy who works with him as a partner in the ranch. Local cattle baron and all-around A-hole, Enrique Rios (Eduardo Noriega), controls most of the goings on in the small village, and he wants hunky honkey heartthrob Madison out of the picture... Now! Enrique's crazy jealous and cannot stand the way 'ol Jimmie boy has been making goo-goo eyes at his lusty, busty fiancee, Sarita, (Patricia Medina). Sarita feels trapped in what is presumably a prearranged marriage-to-be and when she's not-so-secretly pining for a piece of white meat, she takes care of Pancho & Panchito, a drunken but good-hearted old vaquero and his cute little ragamuffin son. Interesting tidbit for trivia buffs: Carlos Rivas (Felipe), Pascual Garca Pea (Pancho) and Mario Navarro (Panchito), also worked together the following year in another Willis O'Brian-based south of the boarder stop-motion horror film, The Black Scorpion.

The animation is hit or miss and most of the stop motion work here is, to be brutally honest, very crude. Ray Harryhausen's work looks like ILM-level CGI stuff compared to the shaky stop motion animation footage on display in TBOHM. But to be fair, this wasn't a Harryhausen effort and they likely had only a fraction of the budget Ray usually worked with, not to mention animators with no where near the level of expertise and sophistication that Mr. Harryhausen had. Ray Harryhausen was an true artist who not only had the ability to infuse his rubber & steel puppets with life, but give each one a personality and a ""soul"" - something most other stop-mo animators were never able to achieve. Still, the Allosaurus (Not, as the boxart blurb incorrectly states, a T-Rex) looks pretty dang cool. He's got a nice blue-ish tint to his skin, ala Gwangi, and a cute little fin on the back of his head. His tongue, however, is laughably distracting since in some scenes it appears to be as long as the dinosaur is tall! LOL! But to give credit where it's due, there are actually some truly beautiful animated composite shots found here too, including two terrific shots of the Allosaurus running alongside Guy Madison as he tries to escape the dinosaur on horseback. Those look great! The animators also used Harryhausen's trick of having an air bladder buried inside the stop-mo puppet that could be inflated & deflated to simulate chest expansion/breathing; a nice touch for such a low budget effort.

THE NEANDERTHAL MAN is a rather pedestrian film; a sort of cheap knock-off of Universal's much-better MONSTER ON THE CAMPUS. But where TNM really shines is in the stuffy scientific mumbo-jumbo dialogue the characters have to choke through, and the way that star Robert Shayne just tears it up - delivering his lines like his life depended on it! Shayne rocks this movie! He chews more scenery than the deadly Sabre Tooth Tiger he creates and then sets loose on the local yokels. The sabre-tooth tiger is achieved by using a mixture of stock footage of at least two very different-looking Bengal Tigers wandering around in the woods looking bored, and a hilariously awful miniature puppet head for close-up shots, complete with ridiculously long fangs/tusks and stuffed doll's eyes! I about spit out my drink when the deadly killer kitty leaped onto the hood of the local Game Warden's Nash station wagon and the filmmakers cut to this obviously stuffed Tiger head, filling the entire screen for a full two seconds, (not even bothering to move it a bit in an attempt to simulate life) and then dubbing in a lion roar! HA!

Shayne's cave-man make-up is equally stiff and fake-looking, but it's a silly programmer monster movie, not Gone With The Wind. And besides, it's all in good fun! Robert Shayne appears to be having a great time here, overacting the hell out of his part. God bless him. It's nice to see him get a big chunk of screen time instead of the usual background Colonel/General roles he played in a zillion sci-fi flicks during the 50's, and of course his brief appearances in almost every episode of George Reeves' beloved ""The Adventures of Superman"" TV series, as gruff but lovable Inspector Bill Henderson.

The Blu-ray has both films packed onto one disc and also includes a standard definition DVD of the films set up the same way. The slipcase cover artwork is quite nice, featuring reproductions from both films' theater posters, slightly tweaked to fit side by side on the cover. The artwork continues on the inside of the insert, one side for each film, with various stills and a credits list for each movie. A nice touch here, too. The transfer used from the MGM vaults for TBOHM is glorious! The hi-def picture is sharp, as it should be, and the rich colors are eye-poppingly bright & beautiful. There are some vertical scratches (apparently on the film element itself), and since this movie was not restored in any way the scratches made the jump, too. Slightly disappointing I'll admit, but certainly not a deal breaker by any means. The sound is strong and consistent, with no noticeable fading or hissing/popping.

I have THE NEANDERTHAL MAN on a 2005 DVD from Cheezy Flicks and that transfer is gawd-awful compared to the one Shout! Factory used here to master their hi-def Blu-ray. Also again, from the MGM vaults. The black & white photography is pretty good for a low budget quickie and the focus, although not as sharp as I'd like, is still light years beyond the murky, scratched all to hell transfer found on the Cheezy Flicks DVD. That crappy copy can go out with the trash now! Thank you Shout! Factory, for yet another awesome genre-pleasing double feature release of two obscure, fun, goofy old school monster movies from the good old days! A great way to spend a rainy/snowy Saturday afternoon. Pop some popcorn and enjoy!!! 5 stars!",1393372800,10,6637,4.853486319505737
6014750,5,B00FMGPWNW,"I have been trying for YEARS to get Beast of Hollow Mountain in ANY format. It is rarely shown on TV & when it is, it's chopped up by commercials. Starring Guy Madison, of TV's Wild bill Hickok fame, as a rancher living in Mexico trying to keep his ranch from being destroyed by the jealous suitor of the local bigwig's daughter (Patricia Medina, Mrs. Joseph Cotton). To complicate matters, he has to contend with a prehistoric T-Rex that lives in a remote mountain valley & likes to dine on his cattle. Really not a bad movie. Actually, better than these CGI laden epics around now days. The second DVD, The Neanderthal Man, is a B-movie in the mad scientist genre.

6014751,4,B00FMGPWNW,"glad to add this genuine factory pressed dvd of beast from hollow mountain to my collection, ( I am a vintage sci fi collector),
for almost 20 years you could only find a few dvd-r copies that had problems with pixelating and artifacting and fuzziness,
I lived with that copy for many years thinking no one would ever release a pro studio print on a genuine pressed dvd,
that being said I consider this release the best by far to date,
for the price they give you two formats, regular dvd and Blu-ray dvd, two separate discs, not everything crammed on one disc,
the second bonus feature,""neanderthal man"" has been available before, but this print is also a nice quality example,

** PLEASE UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT A ""RESTORED"" PRINT **
If someone like criterion restored this print the price would have to be much higher,
but I think this is the best quality print of this movie so far ever released, the original they took it from was quite good for 1956,
your typical vertical wear lines appear in a few scenes, but no jumping or jitters, very good color, basically sharp focus and a nice soundtrack,
go to imdb.com for critical reviews of the storyline and acting,directing,etc,
when it comes down to who would enjoy this kind of film it gets personal, these types of ""B"" nostalgic movies are not for everyone,
this reviewer does not even own or want a copy of ""gone with the wind"", (though I do have copies of some of Clark Gables ""B' movies and love them),
anyway, thanks shout factory for this release, and all you sci fi movie buffs grab this while you can as these types of movies often go out of print fast, a true piece of nostalgic sci fi history.",1391904000,7,1657,4.486754966887418

Neanderthal Man pure hoke. :-D",1524096000,,92,4.411764705882353
8616936,5,B00FMGPWNW,"Handsome Guy Madison and beautiful Patricia Medina team up to make this colorful, filmed on location in Mexico movie a fun one to watch.  If you are a fan of both actors, you won't be disappointed.  Guy had one of the best speaking voices in movies. He was a great horseman and did most of his own stunts.  He is only 34 years old here and his athletic skills were great . His wife travelled with him on location to Mexico.  They had three daughters.  Guy had a son in 1967 from a relationship he had while living and working in Rome.  He really should have made more US movies and not had to go to Europe to work in the 60s.",1522800000,,625,4.081967213114754

8616938,4,B00FMGPWNW,"Image quality isn't perfect, but it's good for movies of this age. It met my expectations for a Blu-Ray transfer of these movies.  Anyone who is a fan of these movies, or even if not a fan, but are a collector of 1950's Sci-fi and horror will find this double-feature to be a good addition to their collection.",1497139200,,310,4.344827586206897

8616942,3,B00FMGPWNW,Made in the 50s..not to bad of a movie just wish they showed the T-Rex more throughout the movie instead of waiting towards the end...T-Rex looked good almost in the fashion of Willis O'Brien or Ray Harryhausen but not as good..When they centered in on the feet of the dinosaur when he was walking it was a man wearing special made boots to look like T-Rex legs..really terrible considering the effect of the dinosaur...but all in all not a bad movie.,1472947200,,451,4.580246913580247
8616943,5,B00FMGPWNW,"I saw The Beast of Hollow Mountain when I was very young and I was terrified.  It's a hokey movie, but I was not disappointed - it was great fun.",1472083200,,145,3.8333333333333335
8616944,4,B00FMGPWNW,"I first saw this movie when it came out in the mid-fifties. Not to many dinosaurs around then and not in color. Good climatic ending but the first 50 minutes or so are hard to get through and the movies plot seems to run as slow as molasses.  To bad they couldn't have paired this up with the Valley of Gwangi another  cowboy vs. dinosaur flick. To be truthful I didn't buy this combo because I didn't want to pay an extra ten bucks for some caveman movie which I would probably never watch. ""Beast"" would be nice to have though, maybe some other day.",1470528000,,551,4.238095238095238
