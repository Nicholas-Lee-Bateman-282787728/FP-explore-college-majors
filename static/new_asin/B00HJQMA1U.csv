6166817,5,B00HJQMA1U,I loved it! A seamless performance that kept us laughing all of the way through. So glad that it was available through Amazon!,1399161600,2,126,4.521739130434782
6166818,5,B00HJQMA1U,"Jim is THE BEST stand up comedian these days. His humor is great, and ""Obsessed"" adds another chapter to his outrageously funny work.

I got the Blu-ray version ... because I wanted to see if it was possible for Jim to look even paler. And it is! Let me warn you now. Don't make the mistake of watching this while under the influence of pain killers, alcohol, or anything else that makes your brain freak out. If you dose off, and wake up to see a glowing man with a beard staring at you ... you'll think god is talking. Probably end up forming some sort of doughnut cult, and that would be embarrassing for everyone.

However, there is one thing that should be noted. The Blu-ray does contain a bit of material from Jim's performance that wasn't shown on the Comedy Central Special. But, there is nothing else on the disk ... no additional features at all (unless you consider having sub-titles to be an important feature). You would think that, being Comedy Central, they could at least throw in his early performance where he talked about the Indiana mafia.

Anyway, it's still great stuff. And, unless you have a thing for Blu-ray's alarming ability to display paleness, I would stick with a download from Jim's website.

Keep up the great work Jim! And have some more babies! You need at least a half-dozen.",1399161600,,1312,4.5702127659574465
6166819,5,B00HJQMA1U,"Jim Gaffigan is hysterical and this is his funniest stand up yet. Buy this, you will not be disappointed. It's awesome!",1399075200,,119,4.714285714285714
6166820,5,B00HJQMA1U,"Gaffigan starts delivering jokes and doesn't stop, showing a confidence and level of comfort with himself that makes the show even more fun.",1398988800,7,140,5.130434782608695
6166821,5,B00HJQMA1U,"Jim Gaffigan is easily one of the best stand up comedians currently touring. If you get the opportunity to go to a live show, do it.

My husband and I attended the show that was taped for this special and it was from front to back hilarious. You know that you are at a good show when the pauses after the jokes are not long enough, not because of poor delivery, but because every other joke has you laughing for five minutes straight.

If you're a Gaffigan fan, you will love this show.",1398729600,37,486,4.21505376344086
6166822,5,B00HJQMA1U,"I am also going to review this DVD based on the two White Bread Tour shows I saw in the last year (one July 2013, one April 2014):

Great show again, Jim! Your material is spot on, your delivery perfectly yours. Thanks for always including local material as well- I love that you do your homework. Also, we saw your White Bread tour in Duluth last summer, so we expected more or less the same show- but the vast majority of the material was fresh. What an extraordinary man! Even your signature Hot Pockets bit had some new gems. Love it. Fan for life.",1397520000,29,552,4.3076923076923075
6166823,5,B00HJQMA1U,"So this review is based on his live performance in Omaha, NE on Tuesday, March 18, 2014.

Absolutely Classic Gaffigan.  More of everything you love.  A lot of acts progress and move forward.  and while that is a positive more many performers, Jim Gaffigan has succeeded in providing consistent material on the mundane from the awfulness of seafood to the greatness of steak.  At the risk of sounding repetitive and rehashing old routines, he manages to bring a freshness to the sameness.

At the risk of deterring your purchase, I do wish to repeat that the material seems familiar, but it is also new, but well within our comfort level.

This is of course assuming that the DVD is smiliar to what I just saw, I will edit this review if it appears drastically different.",1395100800,10,770,4.659259259259259

He isn't 100% clean but I prefer his type of performance over a 100% clean act because he is more true to people in the real world. I love that he inserts personal stories because I relate and laugh a lot! You won't be dissappointed if you watch this show. You might even be tempted to seek out his other videos.

6167181,5,B00HJQMA1U,"We've been Jim Gaffigan fans for years and, as usual, this didn't disappoint.  Sometimes I feel comedians are less funny as their career advances- early on they have material that spans all their childhood and young adult years, but later it narrows to jokes about family and air travel.  That's not the case with Jim at all...he's only getting better with time.  We appreciate that this is funny without being profane. Lots of food jokes which I don't mind at all.  In fact, they're my favorite!",1408579200,,496,4.732558139534884

6167199,3,B00HJQMA1U,"Funny, but not his funniest. We love his skits and bought it to watch as a family because he's pretty clean. It is-as hinted-all about food and those parts are funny but not his best work. Then it goes a little off the track into stuff not as clean, though certainly not R rated. It's ok, we probably won't ever watch it again.",1406332800,,327,4.2063492063492065
6167200,5,B00HJQMA1U,I have watched this so often and still laugh out loud each time.  His delivery is priceless and he does not need to curse because he has an actual vocabulary.  Each topic is carefully introduced and is easy to picture.  I love this man,1406332800,,235,4.295454545454546

6167202,4,B00HJQMA1U,"Pretty funny. This time around Jim primarily focuses on food. There were a few times I laughed out loud but, for the most part just made me chuckle and grin. If you want laugh out loud funny then Jim's ""Mr. Universe"" is what you want. I like Jim because he gets the job done with really no profanity or sexual degradation references. There's no racial or political belief bashing, which, is never that funny anyway.",1405900800,,415,4.546666666666667
6167203,3,B00HJQMA1U,"I thought that this one was alright, but my family and I found ourselves not really laughing like we did during King Baby and Mr. Universe. Some were hilarious, but then there'd be times where he kind of got off track, like during the vegetables jokes.",1405814400,,252,4.5
6167204,5,B00HJQMA1U,Gaffigan is an acquired taste. His comedy attitude is different from majority in his shuffling delivery. It's the 'voices of reason' that get you.,1405728000,,146,5.125

6167206,3,B00HJQMA1U,"Not up to the same standard of his other work and certain not in the same league as Mr. Universe. He seems a little all over the place and does a lot more insulting than he typically does. I know there was a span of probably around 15 minutes where my wife and I didn't so much as crack a smile, which is quite a bit of time considering the special isn't too much more than an hour long. If you have the patience, it's probably worth waiting for this one to show up on Netflix.",1404950400,9,477,3.9791666666666665

6167215,5,B00HJQMA1U,"I think Gaffigan is the one of, if not the best stand-up comedians in the country today . . .  and he doesn't go low-ball/gutter for cheap humor. Witty, clever, life-observational stuff delivered in a way that only Jim can do. His rapid fire stuff reminds me of Groucho Marx. I really think he is in that league, and that is heady company. You are still laughing at the last joke and he is half-way through the next, not because of a lack of timing, that others have so aptly posted, but because it is part of his schtick that he does so well. PG stuff you can watch with the whole family. Thanks for making us all laugh, Jim.",1404432000,18,626,4.216666666666667

6167219,4,B00HJQMA1U,"I enjoyed Obsessed and the new material in it, but it kind of feels like the stand-up equivalent of video game add-on DLC, in this case for his previous special, Mr Universe. Enjoyable, but not as good as his 3 previous specials. Definitely worth the price of admission, but right on the edge of being better to wait for it to show up on Netflix or Amazon Prime Instant. I really liked the fact that he released his previous special (Mr Universe) DRM free, as opposed to this release, which to my knowledge is only available in DRM-secured format. If this had been offered DRM free, it definitely would have upped the value for me. That said, I am sure the fact that this is a Comedy Central release, rather than independent, may be the reason for DRM.",1403740800,,752,4.456521739130435
