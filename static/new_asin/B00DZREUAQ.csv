My 4-stars rating was for the movie itself.  Although I love Ivy Ling Po and her wonderful singing, I didn't find this movie as interesting as ""General Hua Mu Lan"".  Still it is a light-hearted, fun kind of movie if you are looking to pass a couple of hours of your day.",1384300800,,441,4.301204819277109
