8123354,5,B000FIMIL6,"I bought this opera because I wanted another performance of Matti Salmenin.  I was not disappointed, he was great as was every other member of the cast.  The voices are strong and blend together nicely.  The music was wonderful, the staging imaginative and right for the opera.  It is a first class opera given a first class performance by outstanding musicians.  I can't recommend it high enough.",1286582400,12,397,4.865671641791045
