3475069,2,B001AZ5IUQ,"Good anime. But item description should be redone. It does not list the episodes on item, which is misleading as to what product you are buying, as there is a volume 2 for gurren lagann and a volume 2 - 2 disc set for gurren lagann. One has 5 episodes, and one has 10 episodes. Need more specifics given in dvd information.",1247529600,7,323,4.225806451612903
3475070,5,B001AZ5IUQ,I got this in the mail after waiting a single day (free shipping).  It came in mint condition and I paid half price for it.  Couldn't expect a better deal.,1241740800,,155,4.133333333333334
3475071,5,B001AZ5IUQ,"FYI, I'm going to be duplicating this review for the other two parts in this series. I've been a hardcore anime fan since the mid 80's, I even purchase a lot of Japanese region exclusive anime. I've watched them all, from ROBOTECH to GaoGaiGar to Witchblade. And Gurren Lagann is a very, very good anime series. One of the best.

  The story is very well paced, reminiscent of Gunbuster (the original OVA, not the new series). Sorry, I'm not going to give away any hint of spoilers in this review. But let me say that the character development and evolution is handled as well as any anime or film I've seen.

  Gurren Lagann's style is a mix of Naruto and GaoGaiGar. Familiarize yourself with those series if you haven't already. Basically it's just WAY over the top!! It doesn't matter if it's the characters, weapons or scale. If the scene can be made any more spectacular, it is. I can't say enough about this series, other than BUY IT!! Support this kind of high grade anime!! And hopefully we can get more amazing anime series like this in the future. Thanks.",1237075200,3,1065,4.549738219895288
3475072,5,B001AZ5IUQ,This is the greatest anime every made. The DVD doesn't really offer any extras...or an English version...but it is an amazing world that everyone should experience.,1229472000,2,164,5.346153846153846
3475073,5,B001AZ5IUQ,"Gurren Lagann is an amazing show that brings back the mecha genre. I am very happy with this product and the rest of the series. There is a number of epic mecha battles that include many stunning visual effects. I thought that  the visual style alone made Gurren Lagann stand out from other upcoming mecha shows and those of the past. Gurren Lagann is an amazing show, end of story.",1220745600,,382,4.457142857142857
3475074,5,B001AZ5IUQ,"This time around, the situation's getting serious. Harsh consequences and sacrifices are made by the Gurren-dan in the coming days as they inch closer and closer to Lord Genome. The series in no way loses momentum or quality; in fact, these only increase with each episode. Episode 18 is guaranteed to cause immense, hate-filled epithets. You can't beat a series which grips the viewer so tightly. Good release, sparse extras, but then again, it's Gurren Lagann. If that in itself doesn't motivate you to buy it, you need more than a few extras to help you.",1219881600,,557,4.8125
3475075,5,B001AZ5IUQ,"Gurren Lagann is one of the few new series to catch my attention recently. The show contains fantastic animation, a good story, and fast paced action. I am also a fan of how this series is being released. Bandai is releasing this show in three volumes, each of which contains two discs. However, the only versions that are currently available are the sub-title only disc, so if you do not like subs I suggest you wait for the dubbed release whenever that comes out.",1218844800,,465,4.5476190476190474
3475076,3,B001AZ5IUQ,"This is a fantastic series; I am mainly writing this review to point out the fact that the master for the 11th episode is from the TV version, not the version that was on the Japanese DVD releases. Sloppy work from Bandai. Other then that it is a decent release though.",1218585600,7,269,4.294117647058823
8280408,2,B001AZ5IUQ,Not sure how I missed this but all of the Gurren Lagann DVDs being offered on Amazon do not have the English audio. Now its too late to return them. Every other site I see selling them include both the Japanese and English audio. Very disappointed.,1499904000,,248,4.413043478260869

8280412,5,B001AZ5IUQ,"OK, the DVD releases are very confusing, but here is the episode guide:
Gurren Lagann Vol. 1 (Eps 1-5).
Gurren Lagann Vol. 2 (Eps 6-9).
Gurren Lagann Vol. 1, 2 Disc Ed. (Eps 1-9).
Gurren Lagann Vol. 2, 2 Disc Ed. (Eps 10-18).
I do not know what is on Gurren Lagann Vol. 3 since I do now own them, but I suspect Volume 3, 2-Disc will have the last 3rd of the series.",1419292800,11,365,3.945945945945946
8280413,5,B001AZ5IUQ,I love both my new anime it came so fast,1411344000,,40,3.1
8280414,1,B001AZ5IUQ,"i bought this dvd thinking the episodes listed are the ones on the DVD. I was wrong.

this single disc includes episodes 6 7 8 and 9. not 10-18 like the product listing says.

there is a gap of 9 episodes between volume 2 (this listing) and volume 3 which is now very expensive due to bandai not exporting anime anymore. all in all this listing is incorrect and you should not purchase gurren lagann vol 2 unless you want episodes 6-9.",1361577600,8,435,4.2926829268292686

8280417,3,B001AZ5IUQ,"the dvd's were japanese audio only!
It wasn't mentioned anywhere that they were japanese audio only. I had the rest of the box set except for this part and was looking forward to watching it with my friends, but when we got to part 2 it was in japanese and didn't have the same impact as when we watched it before.",1354492800,2,314,4.163934426229508
