Do not buy this item.",1224979200,2,147,4.103448275862069
8124664,3,B000FMGTSA,"Before purchase, one should check whether or not buying Season 1 of each series individually might be less expensive.  DVD releases get re-priced all the time, but as of this writing (11/2007) the sum of the parts is about 1/3 the cost of the whole!  5 stars for the idea (and the content is OK too) but 1 star for the list-pricing of this combo pack.",1194998400,,351,4.303030303030303
