7846496,2,6303419747,"This quick cash grab of the early 90s that poses as a documentary was a waste of money even back in 1992 or around the time it was made.

It sheds very little information on Shawn Kemp and is mostly just a highlight reel of dunks and players opinions on him.

However you can see it was made very cheaply, not much effort was put into it and it was just an NBA quick release to take advantage of their hot properties of the time and make a quick buck from them.

This provides little info up to the time it was released. So don't expect to see any iformation about the Sonics taking on the Bulls in the 96 finals... this was made a few years before that.

With that said, it's obvious it's not a complete history of Kemp either. These cash grab docos ripped off fans when they where released, and they're not even worth seeing the lazy editing of today to give them much of a collector's value.

I personally think you're being ripped off if you purchase this these days at higher cost of the original RRP. Especially since most of these barely ran more than 40 mins and there is good reason the NBA have never bothered reissuing these releases on DVD or any other forms of media. Even on Youtube its not a popular video.

The sellers asking for more than ten to fifteen bucks are having a laugh and will never get that price for this.",1517961600,,1335,4.2362204724409445
