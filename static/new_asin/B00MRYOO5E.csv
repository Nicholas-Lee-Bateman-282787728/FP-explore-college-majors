6600639,5,B00MRYOO5E,This region code free bluray is the second installment of Babymetal's concert legacy on their path to worldwide conquest. The sound quality is out of this world. The cardiovascular powered live performance on stage is phenomenal. The japanese based storytelling is even fantastic. It has songs that are not in their debut album so please take a payday loan out and get your relatives each a copy for the holidays. 5 out of 5 stars for this very rare collectors' item.,1414713600,12,467,4.777777777777778
6600640,4,B00MRYOO5E,"The first show was ok but lacked GREAT camera angles. Also you can clearly see in many parts Yui and Moa are not singing. Suzuka's voice was good on the first show BUT in the second show she was great! So the second show, it was awesome! The singing,the dancing,and the kami band were all great. Even though this isn't my favorite show of them (I prefer red night and black night dvd) it is still a great show. Totally worth the money!",1465516800,,435,4.253012048192771
6600641,5,B00MRYOO5E,"Ok, so I just got through purchasing this here and quite a hefty price at that...but it's sooooo worth it! Yeah, I'm adding my 5 star review before even getting my copy, but I already know what needs to be said, so yeah, my review is not really based on this DVD, doesn't have to be as all the other 9 reviewers before me said enough of this DVD. I just found out about BABYMETAL yesterday, and today (lol) I purchased both albums (CD+DVD set of course, the only way to go) and 4 of their concert DVD's. Sorry Amazon, I purchased my other 5 BABYMETAL's through eBay as they were cheaper. Ok, so I'm like a big fan of female artists and female-fronted metal bands, so I was like searching through the web yesterday for some female-fronted asian metal bands and I found the band ""Cyntia"" & ""Aldious"", both from Japan. Now, I'm a big fan of the pop duo ""Twins"" from Hong Kong, so not understanding a damn word of Japanese is no problem, they sounded pretty good. Now, here's the funny thing, throughout my searches on their albums I kept seeing BABYMETAL listed as something I would like. So I finally just went on Wikipedia to see what BABYMETAL was all about, and it said BABYMETAL is a ""kawaii (cute) metal"" band, a fusion of J-Pop Idol and metal. Hmmm...I got to thinking, this could be better than ""Cyntia"" & ""Aldious"". So I got on YouTube to check them out, and OMFG...I loved them! I ended up putting my purchases on hold on the other two bands as I had to get all BABYMETAL. I not need to explain how awesome this band is as others have stated everything already. Not every metal fan will take a liking to BABYMETAL, but if you're like me, loves the female voice, enjoys pop & metal, and don't care what the hell they're saying, then BABYMETAL it is!",1460246400,,1755,4.353658536585366
6600642,5,B00MRYOO5E,"Video quality is excellent, but for the price you would think the audio could at least be in 5.1 dolby minimum since it's a concert. The 2 channel is quite good and detailed and way way better than what you will hear online, other than that it is a good buy if you like the band.",1456963200,,279,4.0
6600643,5,B00MRYOO5E,"The 1997 show is probably my favorite out of every live performance they have filmed. They never disappoint but there's a ton that goes on during this show. The production, Su-Metal's amazing voice, and the godly Kami band are fantastic. I've already seen the entire performance on Daily motion numerous times that I felt that getting the blue-ray would be necessary (don't have to deal with buffering/ads and what not). Each song sounds incredible live as well, I think that they should have had an audio copy of this concert as well besides the Budokan performance. (someone maaay have posted it already on reddit ;) )  These girls are incredible and I can't wait to see them next year!",1450915200,2,688,4.781512605042017
6600644,5,B00MRYOO5E,"ANOTHER Great BABY METAL concert, its not my first choice but this band makes You smile, fun! that's why I give it 5 stars because it is! some of the singing is dubbed , they put on a great show, and the picture quality is great too...",1447459200,,235,4.0212765957446805

6600647,5,B00MRYOO5E,"First off, none of the Babymetal discs have a setup option for English subtitles. This is infuriating. Every Japanese movie or anime in my library has an option to turn on English subtitles, but not any of Babymetals do so!!!!
Second forget the Budoken or the IDZ discs. If you are a fan, 1999,1997 is the only disc you want given the very steep price of all these discs.
Third, 1997 may be the greatest live performance of any pop act which I have ever seen. The production values are off the scales. And Su-metal hits the stage as if possessed. Freeze frame Headbanger #12 at 1:02:26 and look at that closeup of Su-metal. If that doen't send chills down your spine, you aint alive. If you are a fan, you have get this disc and in bluray.",1428969600,3,739,4.36231884057971
6600648,5,B00MRYOO5E,"If you're taking the time to look at the reviews, you're probably already aware of Babymetal and are a fan of the band or at least like them.  After all, the price tag for this video is pretty steep, so if the high price didn't scare you away, you must at least have a bit of an interest in the band.  You also probably know that as of this writing this is the only concert video they've released that is not available for download on iTunes (their other videos, ""Legend I,D,Z"" and ""Live at Budokan Red Night & Black Night Apocalypse"" are available for download on iTunes and are considerably cheaper on iTunes then when buying them in disc form).  You also probably have noticed that although footage from pretty much the entire Legend I, D, Z video is floating around on youtube, footage from this video is almost nowhere to be found.  So, the only way to even get a peek at this is by buying it in disc form, and you're wondering if it's worth the risk to throw down your hard earned dollars for this rather pricy item.

I know that several months ago I was right where you are now, thinking ""do I really want to spend this kind of money on this?"" Months later, I can honestly say I have no regrets.  Honestly, this is probably one of the best concert videos I own of any band and it still gets  heavy rotation from the entire family (yes, the entire family). It's that good.

First, the image quality, the video editing, the sound, and performance quality of both shows is excellent (the video consists of two shows, the Legend 1999 show on 6/30/2013 and the Legend 1997 show on 12/21/2013). In fact, this video is probably the best they've put out and in my opinion is better then both the Legend I, D, Z video and the Live at Budokan Red Night Black Night Apocalypse video.  The Legend 1997 show on the disc is especially good and is arguably the better of the two on the disc. To give you a sense of  what kind of quality to expect from the video of this show, their ""Gimme Chocolate"" video was taken pretty much entirely from footage shot from this show.  The video quality and sound quality of this entire show is pretty much equal to or at times even better then that of the Gimme Chocolate video.  Candidly, if you're looking for a concert video to show to someone to get them interested in Babymetal, the Legend 1997 show footage is the thing to show them.

So, if you're even kind of curious about this video, or have seen footage from their other videos and are wondering about buying this one, just go ahead and buy this.  You won't be disappointed.  Even if somehow you are disappointed, this thing is not very easy to find and is in high demand by collectors and fans, so you'll have no problem selling it and making back your money if you really don't want to keep it.

However, I get the sense that if you already like this band, you'll really like this video and won't be parting with it.  And if you're on the fence about this band, this might be what wins you over.",1424908800,24,2987,4.32437275985663
6600649,5,B00MRYOO5E,Arrived pretty fast and in excellent condition. Totally recommend this for everyone interested in babymetal you will not be disappointed,1416960000,4,136,5.85
8674392,5,B00MRYOO5E,"If you're into the whole BABYMETAL mythology, then this is a must for your collection as this is the ""origin story"". Legend 1997 is one of my favourite concerts so far and was the scene for the viral hit Gimme Chocolate!!.",1524009600,,222,4.439024390243903

8674396,5,B00MRYOO5E,Any concert put out by Babymetal is awesome to watch. While this is centered on each of the members birthdays; individual acts are put out exemplifying this. This was nice surprise to me when watching for this first time.,1489622400,,221,4.6923076923076925
8674397,5,B00MRYOO5E,"I am extremely happy with all the performances on this blu ray. I just can't get enough babymetal, I think they are fantastic.",1482019200,,126,4.521739130434782
8674398,5,B00MRYOO5E,"As an early BM fan, I wanted to start having a valuable collection of what I could appreciate the most, and this is one of them. Yes, it was pricey but it was worth it. No regrets. And I loved it too was the fact I watched the full concert where ""Gimme chocolate"" music video was taken from. For any BM fan, this is a must. HQ is granted.",1470096000,,338,3.9130434782608696
8674399,4,B00MRYOO5E,"If i based my review on the first show only, i would give it three stars. The second show deserves five stars thus the four star rating. I got the bluray of this concert and was disappointed by the video quality of the first show. It looks like the footage was taken from someone out in the audience with a handheld video camera. The video was kind of blurry and jumpy. I thought the sound quality wasn't up to par as well. The video and sound quality on the second show was much better. The stage setup was the best I've seen of all their concerts. In spite of that, i believe the red/black night budokan was their best concert on video by far with superior sound and video quality especially during closeups. The Kami band was excellent and played throughout the entire concert. They also got to take turns doing some badass solos. For people who don't know, the band with the skeleton outfits in the legend shows are just for show, they are not actually playing. With the Kami band the performances are much more rounded and complete because they compliment each other so well.",1468627200,3,1080,4.4873096446700504
8674400,5,B00MRYOO5E,"This 2 show dvd is damn good. With barely any dubbed vocals from Su-Metal and most of the songs with the Kami band, this blows i,d,z out of the water. (Not that I,d,z is bad, its actually very good.) A definate buy if you are a Babymetal fan like me. Ijime, dame, zettai.",1466294400,,271,4.132075471698113
8674401,5,B00MRYOO5E,Great quality video. Not sure how you can give less than five stars. Either you love it or you hate it. Great early concerts from the kawaii trio.,1465948800,,146,4.25
