8103295,4,B000E0OBIS,I saw this Series years ago and when I first started ordering things off of Amazon I knew this was one of the items I needed to have. I haven't completed this series but I can't wait do so. It's about a stepmother who falls into a relationship with her stepson. after the first few times of being a mistake and only wanting some love and compassion he turns her around completely. Within this vol he takes her out to the park and well I don't really want to spoil anything... I'll just say some more people get involved.  Also I would like to say that this H-Series Classic DVD arrived sooner than expected and was really excited to have it and nearly finish my collection of this series.,1349654400,,688,4.333333333333333
