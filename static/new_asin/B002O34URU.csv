8375889,4,B002O34URU,"I chose this movie to be a 4.0/5.0 rating scale based on the different ways the director, Kent Mackenzie, provided for his characters. The outlook on these characters are very different than the gypsies that we have been learning about all semester long. For instance these characters have a way of life that does not seem to be family oriented and in the usual movies we see that the main characters strive with that family relationship, even with miles away from each other, their main goal is to raise money and keep their families safe and sound. While The Exiles showed a way of selfishness such as when they left the girl in the restaurant to pay for the food. Even through the title and cover we see that this movie is projected very dark and in black and white to show the mystery and hidden identity from the characters. While this movie does project these dark side it also taught me how their small town neighborhood reminds me of the neighborhood where I come from; Paterson New Jersey. These residents do not have high ambition and their lifestyle can be described as boring since it follows the same routine everyday. The lives of many people in Paterson is to get a job that will allow them with enough money to just make it through and pay for the necessities. However, many people in Paterson also live off welfare system and they complain that not many jobs are provided for them since they lack education or training that they need, much like the residents living in the reservation. Furthermore, the voice of the narrator Yvonne played by Yvonne Williams helps the audience follow the dreams she has as we see her life circle through a bottomless pit since she is pregnant and has a husband, Homer, who leaves to do whatever he wants. This life cycle done by the director shows the way that many poor community have with their spouses, and how sadly couples continue having children without having the money to support them. This movie shows a great deal of  reality that the audience should familiarize themselves with.",1396915200,,2040,4.666666666666667
8375890,5,B002O34URU,"As Sherman Alexie stated in the commentary, the director had to have known about and been very close to Indins to tell this story the way he did.  An incredible and unbiased look into the lives of a handful of natives living off the rez.  Beautifully shot too.  Highly recommended.",1391990400,,281,4.58
8375891,5,B002O34URU,"Few remember the history of Bunker Hill or the power of real, raw cinema verite. This film has both--a group of friends, Native Americans exiled to the poverty of Bunker Hill in Los Angeles, during a night when each of them is out searching.

If you've had enough of screenplay-guru-influenced, pre-digested American film, buy or rent this movie today!",1372464000,5,352,4.966101694915254
8375892,5,B002O34URU,"This movie is an early version of American Graffiti with a Native American cast living on Los Angeles' disappeared Bunker Hill. It is the finest time capsule of the late 50's early 60's period depicting the once great LA neighborhood of Bunker Hill. This long lost movie is a national treasure and for all those who love LA yesterday, today and tomorrow a must see. There are also some other short films in this two volume set by the director The Exiles.",1362096000,4,454,4.548780487804878
8375893,3,B002O34URU,"I was very interested in seeing this movie as I'm a product of the Native American LA experience of the 1950's. When it arrived I wasted not time in putting it into my player. The movie was what I expected so I thought I'd watch the second disk. When I went to take it out, it folded into a cd taco. I was bummed.",1328486400,,313,3.90625
8375894,5,B002O34URU,"Excellent docudrama about young Native Americans living in central Los Angeles circa 1960. The film vividly captures a time and place as it follows a half dozen characters during a night of bar hopping, cruising around town, and gathering on a hilltop overlooking the city for drumming and singing. Other reviewers have noted the down-beat tone of the film, but it is also full of comic moments and immense energy, which is reflected in the terrific rock-and-roll soundtrack (all original music for the film).

Beautifully photographed in black and white with striking night-time street scenes, the original Angels Flight funicular, the old houses on Bunker Hill and the tunnel under it. Mackenzie's camera captures wonderful unscripted details in the crowded bar scenes, and the performances of his nonprofessional cast seem natural and spontaneous. Originally made as a student film at USC, ""The Exiles"" has stood up remarkably well for its 50 years and rewards viewers with a multi-layered portrayal of lives lived in a moment of history. Two-disc set with extensive supporting materials.",1274832000,6,1091,5.30635838150289
8375895,3,B002O34URU,"The previous reviewers have done an excellent job of describing the contents of this DVD set.
It should be noted that there are no positive-feelings (hopefulness) or happy-endings to any of the features.
There is also nothing new/ancient (knowledge) to learn about the Native culture(s) or our history.
It's simply the ""urban"" version of Native life versus the ""rural"" Reservation version of our reality/culture.
The DVD's main feature also has the option of having (overdubbed) audio commentary by two contemporary Natives.
This option is recommended during viewing, since there is no real script or meaningful plot to follow, as this commentary can give the viewer a much better insight as to what is being shown and how it is viewed/interpreted by the Native culture.
Conversely, if the audio is turned-off completely, the viewer cannot even distinguish that the movie is about/includes Native Americans...except for the still-photos at the beginning of the main feature. (sic)
The DVD set is a ""must-have"" for collectors of Native American culture documentation (due to it's rarity), but would disappoint anyone looking for action, drama, plot or some kind of (Native) wisdom/lesson.

Hope this helps in your research & decision-making.",1264118400,3,1240,5.391752577319588
8375896,5,B002O34URU,"Whether you consider this film to be docudrama or documentary (a case could be made for either), THE EXILES is one of the greatest ""night"" films ever made.  If you asked Mr. Peabody to fire up the wayback machine and transport you to Los Angeles in 1958 for a night on the town (when most of the film's action was actually filmed), this is what you might see.  In other words, the production provides a brilliant time capsule of a specific time and place.  The nighttime cinematography is breathtaking, rivaling that of the best film noir efforts.  The ambience is punctuated by many forgotten vintage rock/blues/doo-wop songs playing constantly in the background as the characters move from place to place.  Some of that music is instrumental tracks performed by the Revels.

The period is further brought to life via some of the accompanying featurettes.  There are documentary studies of Bunker Hill and Angels Flight (the funicular railway) that reveal the grandeur that had fallen into decay by 1958.  There are also some native American featurettes.

The two-disc set has something for everyone, spanning elements of history, architecture, sociology, and psychology.  The film is no musty lecture, but a living document that brings the past back to life.  The DVD's transfer and supplemental features are superb.",1258934400,17,1318,5.083720930232558
8375897,5,B002O34URU,"""The Exiles"" is another cinematic gem rescued from oblivion by the good folks at Milestone Film and Video. Directed by the late Kent Mackenzie, not long after he graduated from the University of Southern California, the film give us a rare glance at life of Native Americans in the big city, providing us with a unique and very important document of our times.

The movie adequately opens with numerous beautiful, historical photos - mostly portraits of Native Americans throughout time --, and right away we are told that ""white men sent Indians to reservations, but some went to the city,"" and we immediately meet one of the several characters that we'll see in the next 72 minutes. We follow them in what turns out to be great part of a day in their lives, beginning when pregnant Yvonne arrives home one afternoon, where she finds several mostly unemployed men, bored as they could possible be, wasting time in nonsense.  From then on, we follow them into their night rituals. The women mostly stay home or go to the movies; the men, however, have or apparently have all the fun. They go gambling, partying, drinking, getting high, and skirt-chasing. They do this until the sun rises, and repeat this destructive cycle every day.

""The Exiles"" is an unpretentious, sincere film, done with the heart, and the director apparently allowed the actors - mostly Native Americans -- to be themselves and play their culture. This exceptional movie depicts a well-known, sad part of our society, with defeated human beings, with defeated minds, as the main characters. It doesn't matter where the plot takes place - the city or the reservation --, the stories are always the same. This is especially revealed in the long scene in which the boys go to party on a hill in the city Los Angeles known as Hill X, in which they drink and play the drums all night long, as they did in their reservations. This is their way to reminisce about their culture, their parents, their childhood, and their land.

""The Exiles"" also captures a part of Los Angeles that is gone, because the whole film takes place in that city, mostly in a place known as Bunker Hill. We get to see how the neighborhood was during the early sixties, including the famous Angel's Flight, which was located in that area. Angels' Flight was out of business for a while, but it was recently rebuilt as a tourist attraction. Sadly, the neighborhood didn't have the same luck: it was demolished to make way to corporate buildings, which constitute the current landscape of downtown Los Angeles. This story is identical to the fate that a place known as Chavez Ravine had. It was a happy site, mostly populated by Mexican immigrants, which was demolished to build Dodger Stadium -- in short, the history of brown people. In addition, there are scenes filmed in Grand Central Market, in Downtown Los Angeles, a place which, for some reason, has been able to survive and thrive all these years. For us, who live in this weird and controversial city, it is important to see all this visual historical records.

In addition of the film, this magnificent two-disc DVD set is loaded with historical extras, featuring several shorts by Kent Mackenzie, including ""A Skill for Molina"", ""Story of a Rodeo Cowboy"", and ""Ivan and his Father."" It also includes the documentary ""Bunker Hill: A tale of Urban Renewal"" by Greg Kimble, and ""White Fawn's Devotion: the First Native American Film. Furthermore, this remarkable DVD set also features audio bonuses, like ""The Leonard Lopate Show,"" with Sherman Alexie and Sean Axmaker, as well as interviews with these two personalities. Finally, there is also a DVD-ROM, with downloadable material, including ""The Exiles"" scripts (including the final version), publicity material, production history on ""Bunker Hill,"" ""The Making of The Exiles"" (MacKenzie's Master Thesis), and much more. (USA, 1961, B&W and color, 72 min with additional material).
