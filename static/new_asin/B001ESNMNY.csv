8510938,1,B001ESNMNY,"This was essentially a silent film, only background noises and one announcement about the head of the Olympics.  The NTSC copy I bought from China had great photography and COST $33 shipping -yuk! but the spectacular lost if glow without telling us what was going on.  NBC gave great detail and I thought this one would also. BUT IT HAD NONE!  . Disk one and two are almost the same and the 3rd of the closing was over half just people and contestants walking around. Then when that ended it was a lack luster show for the closing. Opening spectacular closing yawn-yawn!! TOTAL WASTE OF TIME and very boring. Watch PBS which shows it with complete commentary. The NBC announcers were very good with detail but these videos HAD NO COMMENTARY.  I am not sure what one of the reviewer thinks he heard in Manderine.",1236038400,,811,4.572413793103448
8510939,3,B001ESNMNY,"The video format is wide screen, but its audio and video quality are sub-standard compared to most DVD movies probably because of heavy compression. It doesn't look good on an HDTV even with a good up-scaling DVD player.

Not recommended as a memorative unless you want the Chinese narration. The narration does give you more detail than the NBC commentators. It was difficult for the NBC guys to tell what was going on because of their cultural background.",1221523200,22,457,4.858974358974359
