5540583,4,B00B14P81K,"Charles is a professional assassin who is very good at what he does. He also has a thing for cleanness. But he wants to go straight, and alas, events conspire to complicate his plans. Dead in France is a difficult-to-categorize indie, but it might be described as a neo-noir thriller parody, or perhaps phrased another way, a darkly comical take on the familiar hitman formula. Strengths include the deadpan Brit humor, sunny Southern France locales, and the quirky characters who are well portrayed by the near perfect cast.

It's an easy movie to like, or dislike, depending upon one's sensibilities. I come down on the like side, even with the proviso that the patches of violence, toned down somewhat by the b&w look, are pretty extreme even for this genre. As mentioned, DIF has a strong cast, especially Celia Muir as the cleaning lady/girlfriend, who pretty much steals the movie, though Kate Loustau as our hero's arch-rival, a slightly psychotic fellow assassin, gives her a run for her money. I'd tap this one as a can't miss future cult favorite. Recommended then, with the usual not-for-all-tastes caveat. Four stars.",1421798400,,1129,4.973544973544974

5540585,4,B00B14P81K,"This is not your average British film: the DVD box may say 'Tarantino meets Ritchie' but it's more 'Burn After Reading' mixed with the more earnest 'The American', a world populated with shady Brits running riot in the South of France, each pursuing their own hopes and dreams and their fates colliding one sunny day in Cannes.

The story is eclectic and original, although a variation on a theme: after a long career killing people, obsessive-compulsive hitman Charles decides to retire to the South of France to find a wife and a yacht but with zero experience of either as he suffers from a brand of social autism. Nevertheless, he hires coquettish Lisa to provide him with certain 'services' in a wonderfully-scripted scene, and, after claiming a 2m retirement fund from another retired hitman whom Charles makes strip naked and stand in a posh Cannes pool, embarrassment covered only by a bobbing rubber duck, Charles drives around France with the money in the boot of his car looking to buy a yacht. Unfortunately, Charles's day starts becoming a nightmare as the money is taken from right under his nose by two Londoners, brothers Simon and Ray who don't actually look anything like each other ('same mum, different dads' apparently). The mess Charles finds himself in is exacerbated by the arrival of rival hitwoman Clancy who has probably by far the most violent introduction of the whole film, and who follows Charles to France as she wants money from him that she believes she is owed and she wants it before Charles retires.

As one of the taglines states: 'things are going to get messy', and they do with at least as much impact as the moment that Clooney shoots Pitt in the wardrobe in the Coen's 'Burn After Reading': there is a lot of violence, bad language and a lovely over-the-top sex scene involving Lisa and her punk, Mohawk-sporting boyfriend Denny who also decides to rip off Charles, steal one of his guns from a drawer and use it to clobber the local French with, and their cats.

The film is mainly in black and white which is a great choice for something set in and around the South of France: things look very fresh and clear and bright: the film knowingly sends up the film noir crime genre without any winks to camera: the cast all manage to play it dead straight, which must have been difficult as you can see from the extensive gag reel that comes with the film along with a couple of the trailers including the original and red-bands plus some deleted scenes.

None of the actors in this is well-known, but the writing is excellent, the direction clever, the cinematography very film-noir yet also modern and the music is very nice, probably the most Tarantino-like thing in the film. It is a breath of fresh air to find a comedy like this that is quite difficult to pigeonhole, and actually I'd like to see more films like this. It's very British for all the right reasons. Four solid stars.",1363132800,5,2926,4.675728155339806
5540586,4,B00B14P81K,"This is posited as a modern, Brit noir comedy and in many ways it meets that description. It is all about a hit man Charlie played by Brian Levine (who also co-wrote this). He plays a well spoken assassin who is on his last gig, which is 100 kills, and then he wants to retire. He has skipped to the South of France for the hit and comes into a rather large sum of cash as a result and is now minted.

He has also hired a cleaner in the shape of effervescent Lisa (Celia Muir), but she has a dodgy boyfriend who is a bit of a trick puller. Meanwhile our hit man also has competition in the form of lesbian uber bitch Clancy (Kate Loustau), and she decides if he is going to retire she will make it permanent. Then Charlie goes and gets all his cash nicked by a couple of con artist brothers who are as hapless as they are lucky and he has to put retirement on hold. So as he is looking for his cash and the love of his life, he is also being hunted and anyone who gets in the way is surely going to have their day ruined.

I really enjoyed this film, it is all filmed in black and white and has been generally well lit, which can be an issue in noir productions, so well done for that. It is generally well acted and is funny in places. I think that Brian Levine probably mis cast himself in the main role as he seemed wrong for the job, but it is his baby and perhaps the juxtaposition of erudite killer who over enunciates was seen as adding to the humour. Either way everyone over plays their parts with aplomb especially Celia Muir, who steals most scenes with her cleaning obsessed reluctant gang mol act.

It is not laugh out loud all the time, it is well made, it is entertaining and it is certainly a bit noir and so quite a pleasant surprise. I think much of this is down to Kris McManus who directed, co wrote and did the cinematography, he has learnt a fair bit from his previous low budget offering `Travellers'(I can't find it on Az US available in Region 2 on Az UK) and should be praised for quite a good and original Brit film.",1357776000,,2043,4.1025

8560496,1,B00B14P81K,"It's confusing because of the number of characters that appear for no other reason than to get killed. This is supposed to be funny, but I don't get any laughs from watching people get shot in the head. Plus it's boring. I think I must have dozed off near the end because all of a sudden there were some more people that I hadn't seen before tied up in the closet. But that's the way this movie is - all sorts of things happen for no reason.",1494115200,,441,4.080459770114943

8560503,5,B00B14P81K,"This Brit wit dark comedy is hilarious.

For a brief second, Dead in France reminded me of the Brit comedy troupe Monty Pyton, yet this movie stands alone as a comedy side splitter. The movie is so subtle, so funny, and so British, I might watch it a second time. It's than funny.

I've always enjoyed the British sense of humor, and this dark comedy made in the style of American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, is all about comedy. Dark comedy, nonetheless, comedy in its highest form. The first hint that Dead in France was going to be a dark comedy is the Black and White film used to make the movie. Set in Cannes, France, where the French hand out its Cesar Awards, France's Academy Awards, it's a location for the super rich. The movie starts out with Charles, played by Brian Levine, who also wrote the script, contemplating retirement once he reaches his 100th professional assassination as a professional hit man. His girlfriend, Lisa, played to perfection by Celia Muir, who is Charles cleaning lady, yet she also wants him to retire so he could buy a yacht for her on the Cote D'Azure. At the same time, Charles is away doing his job as a hit man, Lisa has an affair with a British punk, Denny, played by Darren Brandford, who seems to be more fascinated by the build in swimming pool than Muir's curvaceous body.

The story is based on Charles the Hit Man, who is sexually dysfunctional. His maid is pretty as a button yet he has communication problems in dealing with his maid and other women. Not only that Charles has competition in being a professional assassinating. He competition is Kate Loustau, a professional hit woman, who is also a lesbian. Wacky, yes, but it's British humor. Even though the characters and plot are far fetched, this movie works. It's so damn funny, and so British.

Director Kris McManus knows how to film a comedy movie. And he knows what catches the viewer's attention, not only pretty women, funny plots, but also scenic breath catching views of Provence in France. Nonetheless, it's McManus's eyes for what works on the screen which really shows his talent. A Mohawk Punk in briefs by the swimming pool, cliff side thrills, and flashy sports cars, all add to this movie.

I couldn't imagine a movie like this being made in the states. Dead in France is so British, is could only have been made by the British. And thank goodness it was. It was a comedic gem in the same vein as other British comedies such as Benny Hill, Monty Pyton, Keeping up Appearances, and the list goes on and on. With Dead in France now at the forefront of British comedy gems.",1473465600,,2596,4.586206896551724
