8730662,3,B014G8TJIK,"the total time of this ""movie"" is more like a TV show.  Although the box cover says it is 96 min long, it is only about 60 min long.  The subtitles are decent although at times the translation is erroneous as with many of the Japanese movies translated in Hong Kong or Taiwan.  In general, I've noticed that newer movies have better translations (those sold by 3-Monkey).  This is a cute story and the scenery is a nice travelogue of NY.  Pretty pricey for a short ""movie"".",1475280000,,473,4.390804597701149
