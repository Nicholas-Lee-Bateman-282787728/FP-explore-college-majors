1550105,5,B00005JO2G,"To the last reviewer, the girl's name is Livy...

A lovely adaptation of Ann Howard Creel's debut adult novel.  To get more insight into the beatiful relationship that develops between Livy and Ray, and the sneaky sub-plot involving the Japanese prison camp girls, do check out the book.",1107820800,8,287,4.958333333333333
1550106,5,B00005JO2G,"A beautiful pastor's daughter (Keri Russell), devastated over her mother's death, engages in a brief romance with a dashing soldier during WWII as a source of consolation. Soon after he leaves for Europe, she realizes that she is pregnant. Mattie's (I THINK that was the girl's name) father is furious over his daughter's indiscretion and arranges for her to quietly marry a young man in the parish of one of his minister friends...far from home. Mattie has no other choice but to marry the good hearted, but rather distant young farmer. Will Mattie grow to love her husband of convenience or will the father of her child return for her? Hopefully, this wonderful movie will be released on dvd and you will get the chance to find out.

This movie is very clean and family friendly. When the movie begins, Mattie is already pregnant, so you won't see her hitting the sack...this is a hallmark movie after all! I found the movie to be very sweet with several genuinely funny parts. Overall, this is a good movie about forgiveness and true love. A must see.",1107820800,19,1054,4.697297297297298

1550198,5,B00005JO2G,"I love just about any movie on the Hallmark channel.  It is nice to watch a movie with no profanity or violence - a movie that the whole family can watch together.

This movie was one of them !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I simply loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!",1336003200,,249,4.744186046511628
1550199,5,B00005JO2G,This movie is one of the best love story ever. I love how Ray and Livy found each other in a magical way. The Book and the movie are both well written and directed. Keri and Skeet did  a magnificient job in building their emotions to where they were able to find their way into each others arms. It is a must see movie. I LOVE IT and YOU WILL TOO.,1333324800,,347,3.887323943661972
1550200,5,B00005JO2G,"I have this movie on DVD and I watch it everyday, even if it's just parts of it. I  love the relationship between Livy and Ray. Ray tries so hard to please his new wife, he will do anything for her. This movie makes me feel so good everytime I watch it, it's like and old friend.",1278028800,,279,3.8947368421052633
1550201,5,B00005JO2G,"Keeps you engaged the whole time. It is a good period movie, clothing, cars, businesses, even the tractor fit the time frame.
It is about consequences, good and bad.
You will love the steady pace of falling really in love.
After making a wrong choice,came the miracle of finding a loving,caring,nonjudgmental man,whose sole purpose is to serve another human being when help was really needed. One who helps you to recognize that you will one day forgive yourself. Then allows you to.
It captures the awfulness of war,when innocent people get caught up in war related circumstances, in this case a wrong decision on the US government's part, to place all Japanese Americans in POW camps. The disruption in their lives,and the struggles that they faced.
Also farm life is a major part of the movie, the way people look at the same land, for instance, from different perspectives.
The support of family and community, was really what does happen in some lucky places.
All actors,actresses were perfect for their parts, you will fall in love with them, as you go along!
It really is artful in all aspects, beautifully presented.",1202947200,3,1124,4.890052356020942
1550202,5,B00005JO2G,"THIS IS A MOVIE THAT I NEEDED TO WATCH A LOT OF TIMES, AND NOW IT HAS BECOME SORT OF A FRIEND TO ME,AND LEAVES ME WITH A FEELING THAT IS HEARTWARMING.SOMETIMES I PUT IT ON IN THE BACKGROUND WHILE I DO MY HOUSEHOLD DUTIES AND IT WILL KEEP ME COMPANY,",1160438400,5,249,3.9019607843137254

1550204,5,B00005JO2G,"I've been waiting and waiting for this to come out on DVD.  I taped it but my VCR cut out a few times and I missed some scenes.  I love this film.  The acting is great. I loved Mare Winningham, especially at the dance.  I went to Hallmark just for the halibut and was pleasantly surprised to see it listed.  It will be here next week and I'm looking forward to seeing the scenes I missed.  I'm surprised at Amazon for not being up to date and taking email addresses for a film that was released months ago.",1127779200,4,506,4.112244897959184
1550205,5,B00005JO2G,"Hallmark stores do carry the DVD of this movie (but they are going quickly as this is one of the most popular movies by Hallmark), and you can also buy it online through Hallmark's site. It's been available for at least a few months (I got mine back in April). Also, for your information, Hallmark has received more positive feedback about this movie than any other Hallmark Hall of Fame movie and are currently looking into making a sequel to the story, so help make it possible by buying the DVD and writing to Hallmark.",1123027200,14,522,4.505263157894737
1550206,5,B00005JO2G,"I fell in love with the movie when it aired on CBS.  I can't wait for it to come out on DVD.  The acting was wonderful and the plot was simple, yet powerful.  The love story is a real love story and not something that only a few people can possibly feel.

I bought the book recently and am re-reading it because of how wonderufl the plot is.  Those Hollywood people better get moving on making it into a DVD because I want to own the best movie I've ever seen!",1121644800,3,460,4.010989010989011
1550317,5,B00005JO2G,I think that Keri did a great job in this movie. Also the actor who plays the role of her husband too. I really recommend this movie and I'll be waiting for the DVD release to buy a copy.,1118793600,,187,3.8205128205128207
1550318,5,B00005JO2G,"Excelent movie, nice plot, great actors. I saw it with my daughter and we both enjoyed it very much. I liked Skeet Ulrich in his role of the farmer who would do anything to make Livvy happy.",1118534400,2,190,4.162162162162162
1550319,5,B00005JO2G,"I have not seen such a beautiful movie in a long time.  Even if I had read this as a book first, I would have enjoyed the movie equally, or more.  There is no way possible to have made this movie more tender and real.  It takes difficult emotions and makes them so clear to the viewer.  I loved it and want a copy of my own!",1118275200,2,324,3.791044776119403
1550320,5,B00005JO2G,"I loved this Movie!! Skeet Ulrich did a wonderful job playing the lonely farmer who would do anything to make Livy (Keri Russell) happy. This is a story of redemption and forgiveness and unconditional love. I don't know how many times I have watched it, probably over 50. I had to buy another copy of the DVD because my friends kept borrowing it. I also read the book. I would like to see a sequel of this movie - like the Sarah Plain and Tall series from Hallmark. If you have the same thought there is a petition online asking Hallmark to do just that. Go here:  [...]  to sign it. Be sure to tell them that they have to use the same actors expecially Skeet and Keri.",1114560000,7,669,4.21875
1550321,5,B00005JO2G,"I haven't seen this yet, so this isn't so much a review as information for those of you who want it.  I'm a huge Keri Russell fan, so I did a little digging, and if you want to buy this movie, it's available at [...] if you search the title, it will bring you to the page.

Enjoy.",1111449600,8,280,3.810344827586207
1550322,5,B00005JO2G,"This film was beautifully done. The cast was superb. The Skeet Ulrich character, Ray, was wonderful. The quiet, gentleness of this character was played perfectly by Skeet. Kerri Russell did a wonderful job as Livy, learning to love the land and Skeet. Mare Winningham is always outstanding. I thought this movie was great. I have watched the DVD at least a dozen times. Skeet Ulrich is a young Henry Fonda. He should be in more movies and particularly the wonderful Hallmark movies.",1111104000,9,482,4.890243902439025
1550323,5,B00005JO2G,"Being from North Carolina, I found Skeet Ulrich's performance in this love story breathtaking. Keri Russell did a superb job as well. They both demonstrated true love and forgiveness for not only their own mistakes but those of others as well. The relationship that grew between these two characters is the kind of relationship I think most of us would like to see, patience, understanding and true love. I liked the movie so much I can't wait to purchase it when it becomes available.",1110067200,8,485,4.785714285714286
1550324,4,B00005JO2G,"I was mesmerized by Skeet's performance as the quiet, gentle farmer whose love for his bride is truly unconditional.  His body language conveys the most subtle of emotions without the necessity of speech.  This was a difficult role, which, it turned out, was perfectly suited to Skeet's talents as an understated, intense actor.",1109894400,8,328,5.169811320754717
1550325,5,B00005JO2G,"This was a wonderful movie that touched me deeply. It reminded me that love should have a basis of decency and honor, which is a message that should be sent more often. I am an English teacher and I am putting together a class using historical fiction. This movie will be used as I introduce the class; it is perfectly crafted and beautifully done.",1109116800,8,348,4.453125
1550326,5,B00005JO2G,"This is an excellent movie about finding love, forgiveness and acceptance in the least-likely of places.  While I was not too familiar with either of the lead actors, I really liked Skeet Ulrich's performance as Ray.

Like one of the other reviewers, I, too, checked out the book from my library after seeing the movie.  It is a nice, quick read and expands on the stories of Livy and Ray and their families as well as the Umahara sisters whom Livy befriends.

This is an excellent movie for people who like grown-up stories

without profanity, nudity, or sex scenes.  It proves that a movie doesn't need any of those things as long as the story is good.",1108598400,18,654,4.547008547008547
7941370,5,B00005JO2G,"I find most of the Hallmark movies on the obvious and lame side, but this one was surprisingly good. The acting is definitely above average and there's the secondary story of the Japanese-American girls basically imprisoned on FDR's policy during WW2. If you don't look at any other Hallmark movies, check this one out.",1525910400,,319,4.925925925925926
7941371,5,B00005JO2G,Very touching. Very classy. Sweet story of what real love looks like.,1522713600,,69,4.833333333333333
7941372,5,B00005JO2G,"I have watched this over and over;  it's that good!  Even the secondary characters are endearing.  I'm going to buy the DVD so I can watch it anytime I want to ""feel good"".  This is a real classic and you will love both Skeet Ulrich and Keri Russel in the star roles.  What great actors!  They make you feel like the characters are real!",1522022400,,337,4.1875
7941373,5,B00005JO2G,One of my favorite Hallmark films.,1520899200,,34,4.833333333333333
7941374,5,B00005JO2G,"One of my ALL TIME favorites. Almost can't count # of times I've watched over several years. Too bad it looks suspect because one review that is very favorable has 2 stars. The one star review has to do with a faulty product. Since you are reading the reviews, believe the positive ones. Very difficult life situation redeemed by principled young man over period of time. Tremendous to watch the main character relationship of the movie develop. You won't watch it one time, believe me.",1519689600,3,486,4.729411764705882

7941376,5,B00005JO2G,"Not sure how many times I have watched this movie.  The acting is excellent, a different kind of storyline, and attachment to all of the main characters is easily done.  Satisfying story, satisfying ending.",1513468800,2,206,5.029411764705882
7941377,5,B00005JO2G,"I watch it again and again and again..... amazing movie. Reminds me of God's love for us (steadfast, patient, gentle, & strong). True love in the highest form.",1512777600,2,159,4.714285714285714
7941378,5,B00005JO2G,"I love this movie. I watch it over and over. It is certainly a ""feel good movie."" Set in the 1940's, it is a nice period piece and the characters are all well defined and very interesting. It is a love story but not just between the main two characters; It is full of depictions of the love of family. Most interesting to me was the evolution of character and priorities above ""feelings"". I really enjoyed the music as well as the beautiful cinematography.
This is certainly a family movie, however be ready to answer questions if you have younger children about arranged marriages, ""out of wedlock pregnancy's"" as well as the issues of German and Japanese prisoners and internmant camps. I really enjoy watching a movie that also teaches me about historical facts. Enjoy!!!!",1512172800,5,775,4.7481481481481485
