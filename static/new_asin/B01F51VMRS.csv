7743560,1,B01F51VMRS,This movie was so hyped because of the actor. But it turned out to be a huge dissapointment. It could have been more interesting. Not sure how the movie song was not played. Not the best Bollywood movie.,1465862400,,203,4.368421052631579

7743567,5,B01F51VMRS,"For fans of SRK, this is a must have. SRK likes doing different types of rolls with different technology. His acting is superb, as always. There isn't one single song or dance routine in the movie, so Fan is not your typical SRK movie, with songs and dances. It is drama. I found myself at times sitting on the edge of my seat and also holding my breath. If you have not seen this movie yet, buy this DVD. I traveled 4 hours to a movie theatre to see this movie and it was worth it. I recommend that if you have access to YouTube, to watch ""Making of Fan"". You can see what the actors have to go thru to make these movies. SRK was in severe pain and you can't tell it on screen. That shows what he will do to create movies for his fans. But I do like the songs and to watch SRK dance.",1464652800,11,784,3.9371069182389937
7743568,5,B01F51VMRS,"This was Shah Rukh Khan's finest piece of work to date. It was far greater than the double roll he played in Duplicate, or the double roll he played in Don. Fan is the story of a love affair gone wrong and turned into destructive obsession and hatred. The two roles are done so superbly that it is almost impossible to remember they are being played by the same man. The young 20 something year old fan is uncanny in his resemblance to the older mature 50 something year old star, but there are differences in not only facial features but also carriage and body language. Still the youngster has learned to impersonate his idol and sees  himself as an extension of him, almost like his child or perhaps a younger version of himself. This horrifies the star and causes him to give advise to the young man to just go live his own life and leave him alone. Heartbroken that his beloved Aryan does not recognize or appreciate his love and devotion to him, the youngster sets out to destroy the star's good name and public image by posing as him in various places and circumstances, even eventually gaining admittance to the star's home and coming on to his wife. She of course is not fooled, but he threatens one of their children. The chase seen and subsequent fight is a ground breaking piece of cinema, with one actor playing two distinct parts so seamlessly it is nearly impossible to remember they are one person and not two. Red Chilies VFX does some magnificent work  with effects. I don't know if Mr. Khan will ever be able to top this film for fine acting. As a side note, SRK shattered his knee cap while filming this movie but the show must go on and no one would ever know he was suffering in real pain, neither in this film or in any of the ones he made directly after this one with not enough time off to properly rest and heal his knee. You rock hard Mr. Khan.",1502841600,3,1871,4.358166189111748

The Movie stays with you after viewing and you want to discuss with othes. You need to view this movie more than once to capture and understand all the nuances in certain scenes, let alone the dual role played by SRK.  One of his top 5 best works ever.  I can't think of any other superstar in the world who could have done this movie. 1. Not that many superstars to reference 20+ years of famous performance footage.  2. Not let Ego, Stature, Pride get in way how the role is played by the aging superstar Aryan.",1488585600,,678,4.479674796747967

7743604,1,B01F51VMRS,"Shah Rukh Khan's films have been pretty reliable for me but this one was a miss.

It's a simple plot, Aryan Khanna (a very, very thinly veiled version of Khan himself) is India's biggest movie star and Gaurav is his biggest fan, and a look-alike.  After Aryan snubs him (and oh, arranges for the police to arrest and beat him him) Gaurav sets out to ruin his life by framing him for various crimes and scandals.

One thrill is that Khan plays both characters except that Gaurav is de-aged through computer graphics making him look a good 20-30 years younger.  Another nice touch is that Aryan's fictional career is represented by clips and bits of music from Khan's actual films.  But other than that there's really nothing there.

Both Aryan and Gaurav are pretty reprehensible.  Gaurav is borderline psychopath from the start, threatening suicide when his effort to emulate his idol goes awry, then kidnapping and beating Aryan's box office rival.  Aryan is little better, bribing cops to arrest and torture Gaurav, then covering up the crime.  So it's hard to have much sympathy for either character.

Unlike a lot of Khan's films this is a straight up thriller, with no musical numbers or comedy.  But it's not really that thrilling.  Gaurav's plans for example would only work in a world where finger prints don't exist.

So I love Khan's films but can't recommend this one at all.  Save your time and money.",1476489600,2,1413,4.761316872427984

7743615,5,B01F51VMRS,"My first full length Hindi film. I saw this in a theater in May or June 2016. I was taken with the intense and wonderful acting of Shah Rukh Khan. This movie was wonderful and as ironic as it may seem has jump started my obsession with SRK. I was blown away by the brooding gorgeous tan beauty of Bollywood's King. Certainly a great film a fun ride, The CGI used as well is a must see if you can catch that on You Tube. SRK was made shorter and was made to look different all with cameras and computers he went thru a lot of work physically for this film. And for that we thank you SRK.

On a whim I saw this at the multiplex earlier this year as a limited run,and couldn't wait to see Fan again on DVD!Although the idea of an obsessed fan is not new,SRK's take on it is charming and fun. After watching this film,it made me want to see more of SRK's other work,as I understand he is a pretty popular entertainer.

Both main characters are played by Sharukh Khan, and this is just amazing. If you notice the main characters, one looks like Sharukh Khan usually looks. His other character looks 20 years younger, and has a smaller nose. I am just stunned at how they changed SRKs looks for this movie.

As to the movie itself, I loved the story line. This movie is about what can happen when an obsessive fan isn't given the attention he thinks he deserves. I also really liked the unique ending to this movie.

My friends who don't appreciate Bollywood might like this movie because there are no colorful song and dance numbers, but I missed having them there. However, there was a song and dance number made for the movie which can be found elsewhere. The title of the song is Fan Anthem, and of course Shahurkh Khan dances in it.

7743622,5,B01F51VMRS,"Shah Rukh Khan has outdone himself in this new film. He plays both main characters, different in ages, speech patterns, body language. In a key scene the superstar, Aryan, first meets his infatuated fan, Guarav. Subtle emotions flicker across Aryans face: cold fury tempered by sympathy for the skinny kid crumpled on the floor, followed by fascinated horror when Gaurav turns and reveals his resemblance to the star. Exasperation explodes into anger as Gaurav defies him. As Guarav, the actor portrays hurt morphing into murderous vengefulness, especially with his expressive eyes. Its clear that his demands will only escalate if Aryan gives in. But Gaurav is so like a youngster that he evokes compassion even as he grows more and more unhinged.
The several chase scenes, on foot (well, yes, there is a motorcycle) through Delhi traffic and across Dubrovniks stone parapets and tile roofs, are so well done that its hard to remember both characters are played by the same actor. Gauravs loose-limbed energy contrasts with Aryans powerful strides, but the two are matched in stubbornness in this contest of wills. The film is full of indelible images, like the moment when Aryan resolves to stop Gauravs attempts to ruin him: He says one word, Delhiwallah, with chilling ferocity. A couple of deleted scenes underscore Aryans street-fighter temperament  they could have been left in. It must have been difficult to play the superstar role with its similarities to SRKs real life (house, family, surging crowds waiting for a glimpse of him) though Aryan is much colder, harsher than SRK seems to be.
Fan is worth viewing again and again for its layers of meaning and great acting. Detailing the pressures of stardom as well as obsessive fandom, it might also be seen as SRKs shedding of his younger, wilder persona as he enters his 50s. The eerie last scene reminds me of that famous quote: The past is never dead. It's not even past.",1471132800,11,1935,4.953846153846154

7743644,5,B01F51VMRS,"The Blu Ray arrived on time and in great condition. I saw this film in the theater and really loved it. It's not your typical Bollywood movie nor was it supposed to be. But it's quite a psychological study especially when you consider it's Shah Rukh Khan playing both parts. While there were parts that could have possibly been trimmed, I was riveted throughout the whole film. And SRK's performance is amazing. Especially his performance of Guarav. Both characters have their good points and their faults and interestingly both are allowing their own stubborn natures to run this narrative into dangerous places. One or both can stop it in instantly, but neither will budge. I recommend the movie highly.",1468800000,,705,4.932773109243698

From the technology and especially the makeup on SRK. The concept was very good, althougth not new. But ""Fan"" held its own for I didn't feel it was just a copy of another film. I gave it four stars, but I would even go 4 1/2. There were thrilling moments,and some comedy. Also moments when you can really understand how ""Junior"" felt but not to his extreme. The chase scenes were a little too unreal. If the chase seens were part of making a movie with in the movie then yes you would know and understand SRK running leaping jumping falling  dodging climbing getting up and running 5 more miles trying to catch ""Junior"".  So because of the chase scenes I give ""Fan"" 4 Stars.",1468627200,,824,4.379084967320262
7743649,5,B01F51VMRS,"I love Shahrukh Khan! I have been waiting to see this movie. I have finally seen it, and I loved it! This story of a die-hard fan and his love for his idol. To me this movie was touching and it gripped at the heart at moments. There were some scenes of the movie that I will admit might not be easy for some to watch because of the violence, but it was awesome at the same time. I love movies where Shahrukh depicts two characters, and plays them to a T. Although Shahrukh was playing two characters, there were two different people who lived two separate lives. The ending of the movie was sad and confusing at the same time. Other than that, this movie was the best 2 hours of my movie life!",1468540800,2,693,4.140740740740741

7743651,5,B01F51VMRS,SRK is magical in this movie. He completely makes you forget that he is playing both roles~an amazing feat when Aryan & Gaurav look identical. It's a thought provoking look into two men's lives which are so closely intertwined~with one entirely unaware of the connection.,1468454400,,271,5.044444444444444
7743652,5,B01F51VMRS,"Wow. The film has a good story, great action scenes, and of course, a wonderful actor as both main characters. But what caught me is the message, stated by Aryan: ""you live your life, let me live mine"". It's a message addressed straight to his audience. Enjoy his work, but live your life, don't obsess over him. Catching a glimpse of his life, largely lived in a fishbowl, lets us see how a crowd of adoring fans can feel very threatening. We can't truly understand how that feels, but this movie helps. I am in awe. Ignore the negative, superficial reviews and decide for yourself.",1468368000,,583,4.561904761904762

7743654,1,B01F51VMRS,"I love the cinema. I watch and study movies in English, Italian, French, Spanish, and Hindi. I am sorry to say, this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I used to like SRK but this movie is too disappointing. It is an insult. It was a great idea and that's what makes it even more disappointing. Nothing makes sense, there is no logic, the characters so things that no real person would even think about doing, the storyline has so many huge incongruences that it was impossible to watch it to the end. And why are all of the English-speaking actors so unbearably bad? Nothing the 'fan' did made sense, how the police reacted was preposterous, and how the so-called 'star' behaved...none of it was logical. SRK, get out the '90's, yaar or your career will soon be over. And get some decent script writers.",1467936000,,817,4.453333333333333
7743655,5,B01F51VMRS,"I really enjoyed the movie, FAN.  The subtitles were fine.  The plot centers around a devoted fan, and the basic theme of the movie is about that relationship a superstar has to his fans, especially an obsessive one.

7743660,5,B01F51VMRS,"Overall. . . I liked the movie, but not enough to even give it more than three stars.  The five stars are for Shahrukh who plays a dual role. Once again he proves he's a much better actor than he or his critics claim.  However, he can only do so much with a plot line that makes little or no sense in the second half of the movie.  How can someone change so quickly from a simple hard working young man who loves his parents and worships his idol into a sadistic predator who tries to kill the man he's devoted his life to idolizing.  All because the idol is human and refuses to say, ""I'm sorry?""  However, all is not lost.  The movie is worth watching for a glimpse of the world of relationships between stars and their fans.",1466812800,,727,4.1571428571428575
7743661,5,B01F51VMRS,"Fan was supposed to elevate SRK back in the saddle and convince long time fans that the actor in him is not dead, it was also meant to assure fans that stories and scripts would be important than marketing when he signs on the dotted line.
Fan tries to give a convincing portrayal of a fan who has turned in to a creep but the complex writing has been rendered too simplistically. It only works when we see the game of chess between SRK and SRK, It reminds us that the actor in him is still intact. Among the leading stars, when it comes to playing psychos SRK still has the chops. I enjoyed the film because I enjoyed the game between the two leads but it still has many plot weaknesses that just stop short of making it great. I guess Manish Sharma was not the right director for this sort of complex narrative but he does try.
Just imagine the life of a actor or a star if they did not have any crazy adulation from fans, actors make films but fans make stars. In India, film star adulation is at another level and in Fan, SRK plays both a maniacal obsessive fan to a star who is somewhat on the wane.
The star is Aryan Khanna, who has steadily climbed the heights as various montages in the beginning of the film evoke. The other guy Guarav Chandna, ironically  not only looks like his idol but also believes that he has been created by God from the dust left behind by creating Aryan Khanna.
Gaurav Chandna is a middle class guy with the Delhi accent and an devout Aryan Khanna fan, supported by his parents Deepika Amin and Yogendra Tiku,.
He is famous in his neighborhood because he wins the local Suoer Sitara competition and believes he is in fact Aryan Khanna.  As crazy he is about his idol, his descent in to madness is random and we never understand his psychosis , because he is endearing and does not have the moments of viciousness that maniacs possess. The meetings between him and his idol are phenomenal because of the same actor i.e. SRK switching on and off between the personalities. They both have the sudden epiphany that the idol is a jerk and fans can be a pain.
I loved the fact that throughout the film SRK takes his fame with a grain of salt and often pokes fun at the superficiality of the stardom. The scene is Madame Tussauds is an example.
It would have worked big time, if the script would have been better written and did not have the far fetched situations that the film displays in the second half.
Despite all the flaws that Fan has it is still a very engaging film and an attempt to create something different.
SRK is finally showing some responsibility towards his fan by making an almost cerebral film that does not insult your gray matter. Many will be disappointed because the film strays away from the tried and true but this film was made to be away from the ordinary.

I get that SRK is trying to do something different and creative, but that one did not hit the mark at all. Bollywood movies do not have to be about love, singing and dancing, but this one was just plain long-winded, disturbing and unfulfilling. It was basically a waste of time to watch this movie.",1466035200,,407,4.513513513513513
7743667,4,B01F51VMRS,"So excited that this DVD was available so soon. Received today and my weekend is set! I saw this movie twice in the theaters and enjoyed it. Personally, I think it needed to go further, as fan Gaurav didn't quite come off as unsympathetic and evil as the movie makers wanted him to be. That said, SRK's performance was absolutely amazing, and yes, I am biased as this actor can stand in a frame and read the phone book and I would think it's fabulous. But seriously, his portrayal of the two characters was simply fantastic. I couldn't have been the only one wanting to throw my clothes at the movie screen at the scene in the police station:
Tough Guy Police Officer: 'We can do this nice without handcuffs, or nasty with handcuffs.'
And SRK, (as only he can) puts his sunglasses on and says, 'Nasty.'

When Gaurav goes to Delhi to meet Aryan and is refused, he looses his mental balance and becomes determined to ruin Aryan.

The strength of this thriller is not the plot, though it is suspenseful and well-written, but the make-up.  Khan as Gaurav is made to look just enough like the real Khan while not looking like him.  Tough to explain, but it works perfectly.  Khan gives a great performance, as well, playing both parts superbly.  While this isn't a perfect film, the amazing cosmetic artistry pushes the movie into five stars.",1535241600,,691,4.813559322033898
8760121,3,B01F51VMRS,"Possible spoilers ahead:
The premise of the movie is similar to The Fan (1996), although I liked The Fan better. I'm not here to provide a synopsis of the movie so I'll just post my review now.
Although I liked Fan, it lost steam towards the second half for me. The movie makers really made me stretch my suspension of disbelief from the Dubrovnik part and onwards. How the hell was Gaurav able to bypass the background check? Bhutiani has security all over the place except for outside of Aryan's dressing room? Aryan's assistant sees Gaurav dancing with Bhutiani's daughter on CCTV but doesn't see when Gaurav leaves the room? Aryan's security doesn't have enough sense to follow Aryan when Aryan chases after Gaurav? Aryan doesn't decide to wait for Gaurav to come up for air after Gaurav dives in the sea? These things plus more made me not enjoy the movie as much.
I also thought the movie makers were irresponsible in the glorification of Gaurav's life at the end of the movie. Gaurav was clearly mentally ill and mental illness should never be glorified.",1529280000,,1061,4.709677419354839

Once he got there, he played it safe and minted the big bucks playing similar roles over and over again. I stopped watching his movies altogether for a while. Recently, I saw Dear Zindagi and was tempted to check out this well reviewed movie. I think this is probably one of his best movies. Maneesh Sharma does a fine job as director. SRK is amazing as the obsessive fan as well as a version of himself in real life. It reminded me why I was once a huge fan.",1515283200,3,602,4.067226890756302
