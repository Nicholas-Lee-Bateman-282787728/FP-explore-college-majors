3521062,5,B001CZVVXW,"I agree with each of the reviews that praise this production of Carmen.  However, the reason I am writing a review is to tell you that Blu-Ray truly delivers on this disc!  The production quality is excellent on every level.  Picture quality is superb.  The camera gives a blend of audience views and up-close views without becoming distracting.  But, it is the music that will thrill you.  And isn't that why you buy opera discs?  The sound is delivered in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (stereo is an option).  I recently upgraded both my blu-ray player and pre-amp so I can play audio/video blu-ray discs like this one via HDMI.  What a treat to play this Blu-Ray opera and feel the satisfaction of superb high quality sound in my home theater.
I hope there are more discs like this one in the future.  But, for now, get this and enjoy every moment!

3521063,5,B001CZVVXW,"Until I saw this version, my preferred Carmen was the Rossi film with Julia-Migenes and Placido Domingo.  But this is even better.  Antonacci is an even more sultry Carmen with a great voice and a superb actress.  Kaufmann is handsome and a much better actor than Placido.  D'Arcangelo is an extremely virile Escamillo.  Plus, the sets and direction create an intimate, intense production.  Add to that the wide-screen and superb sound of the blu-ray and you have everything that a video opera should be. Buy this!  You won't regret it in any way!",1229817600,28,547,4.817204301075269
3521064,5,B001CZVVXW,"The re-instated spoken dialogues are a great addition to the drama unfolding on stage. Kaufman is a great Don Jose. Don Jose's transformation from a serene and controlled soldier to a passionate lover and ultimately to the killer of the source of his almost delirium is dynamically portrayed by Kaufman acting and singing. A real treat. Antonacci as Carmen, that free spirited gypsy that not even in love was willing to give her freedom, captivates you from the start and doesn't let it go through the whole opera.
The cast and the production succeed in creating a great drama which the beautiful music is part of. If only the noise created by the cast entering and leaving the stage could be avoided or suppressed.
A great production that Bluray resolution makes it wonderful. Highly recommended for all, first timers as well as well versed in Carmen productions.",1228089600,12,864,4.884353741496598
3521065,5,B001CZVVXW,"This is my first exposure to opera on blu-ray. What a great introduction. The audio and video are simply stunning and the cast is outstanding. I cannot wait to see what is coming in the future. For all those who argue endlessly about blu-ray versus upconverted dvds, stop wasting your time and enjoy the latest advancement in home theater.",1227312000,7,339,4.762711864406779
3521066,5,B001CZVVXW,Amazon's current listing of the aspect ratio as 1.33:1 is INCORRECT. Like all Blu-Ray productions (that aren't of classic films) Decca's new opera productions on Blu-Ray are 16:9 (or 1.85:1) and anamorphic (according to Ken of the Decca Music Group.,1226620800,13,249,5.25
3521067,5,B001CZVVXW,"Let me start by saying that Bizet's Carmen is my favorite opera and I would recommend it as a first opera for anyone wishing to explore the world of opera. Now for the review of this particular performance.

I own nine dvds (7-dvds and 2 blu-rays) of this opera. I can honestly say that this one comes the closest to perfection. In my opinion I believe the sucess of Carmen hinges on the singers portraying the lead characters and the believability they bring to the roles. In this performance all the leads completely succeeed in doing this. I believe that even though the most important role is Carmen the two male leads  need to make us believe that Carmen would actually be attracted to these two men.  I have always felt it is very important to have a really believable Escamillo. The reason for this is that we have to be made, in two arias, to believe  that Carmen could be lured away from Don Jose by Escamillo. This is the first porduction that I have viewed that had me say, yes!, Carmen could/would leave Don Jose for this bull fighter. The Don Jose of Jonas Kaufmann is simply outstanding and Ms Antonacci's Carmen is wonderfully portrayed. Both leads have the goods, vocally and acting, for their respective roles. However, it is the Escamillo of Mr. D'Arcangelo who puts this production into the strastosphere and makes it the performance that all others will be measured against. If I had to only own one performnce of this opera it would be this performance. I am sure anyone purchasing this production will be completely satisfied.

I own the following productions, all have their virtues and capture many of the principals in their prime. Bumbry/Vickers( a film version) ; Obraztsova/Domingo; Ewing/Lima(nla); Baltsa/Carreras. These are mostly of historic interest capturing some of the opera greats of the past. I also have the film with Migenes/Domingo with the two leads giving great performances and is in wide screen. All of these date from the mid-eighties or earlier so allowances need to be made for sound and aspect ratio. Of modern performances I own; von Otter's portrayal of Carmen, not bad but more of a one off version. The same can be said about the Antonacci performance conducted by Gardiner. It is a complete staging of the original first performnce and on the orginal stage of the Opera Comique where it was first performed. Antonacci is let down by her male leads though they sing their roles well the chemistry was lacking. The Micaela of Ms Gillet in this version was very nicely done. I also have the Garanca/Alagna performance from ""Live at the Met"" and is a clear second choice, having many of the same virtues of the Antonacci/Kaufmann.",1393891200,5,2680,4.767241379310345
3521068,5,B001CZVVXW,"I've seen Carmen several times but I've never seen one as passionate or as physical as this one. The leads are incredible, especially Mr. Kaufman whose powerful, ""dark"" voice brings an entirely new energy to the role. The staging is very good and the blu-ray version fully brings out the music and detail in the set design. A fabulous opera, incredibly well done!! Seriously worth your consideration!!",1359936000,2,401,5.0
3521069,5,B001CZVVXW,I was thrilled with this performance of Carmen. The singers are uniformly excellent. The acting and staging are excellent as well. It doesn't get better than this. I enthusiastically recommend this.,1358812800,,198,5.419354838709677

3521071,5,B001CZVVXW,"Always wanted to attend a Broadway play, this is the next best thing from your living room. Video quality is superb, feels like you are there in the audience and the production exceeds expectations. Definitely recommend for anyone wanting the Broadway experience at an affordable price, especially if you have an HD TV.",1350172800,,319,5.037735849056604
3521072,5,B001CZVVXW,"This Royal Opera production, in superb Blu-ray or DVD formats, features a darkly aggressive Carmen with mutual hatred and a desire to destroy brought out strongly. This approach is made far more effective by use of the spoken script as Bizet intended rather than the recitatives that replaced the script later and are still often used.

The opening scene rightly emphasises Don Jose's murderous past more strongly than usual prior to joining the army as his escape from the law with an opening stage sequel showing Don Jose being taken off to be executed. Early in the opera Don Jose informs his commanding officer of his violent past which led to his joining the army. This essential violence in Don Jose's character is matched by that of Carmen but not understood by her for its likely conclusion. Kaufmann's Don Jose is not a weak man but rather a dangerously unstable man.

Antonacci, in this production, portrays Carmen as an essentially dominant woman intent on controlling men through sexual availability in order to achieve conquest over them. This is not the same as being interested in having a serial sexual interest in men. There is no indication in this production that this Carmen actually enjoys either men or sexual relationships. This is simply a story about power and control with a strong undercurrent of latent violence which leads to its inevitable conclusion.

Both Kaufmann and Antonacci sing and act their respective parts well and convincingly. Kaufmann is especially impressive in this dark portrayal and one which his voice suits perfectly. His portrayal is of such an outstanding nature that Don Jose's character and decline has an equal dramatic weight to match those features of Carmen.

The supporting roles are also well done with a splendid and handsome Escamillo (D'arcangelo) making his first entrance on real horseback - a strongly egocentric and sexual conception and well sung so it is easy to see why Carmen would be attracted to such a man. The part of Michaela is also well portrayed although she is clearly no match for the attractions of Carmen. This is a difficult role to make attractive and Norah Amsellem makes a creditable job of it. The two lead gypsy girls are excellent in their roles and make a strong team with the gypsy men. The women of the chorus enter fully into the rather seedy spirit of their part of the production and this is particularly apparent in the opening tavern scene in Act 2 and in all the factory scenes in Act 1. The male chorus members make for convincing soldiers.

The setting is of the period and is very fully staged with lots of period detail and atmosphere. This relates not just to the staging but also to the costuming so this production could be summarised as an enhanced traditional production. The whole opera benefits from the drive generated by Pappano and his orchestra. Overall this is a grippingly vivid and destructive version based upon the mutual need to dominate.

The camera work is fully involving and enables the viewer to feel part of the action. The imaging is crisp with good colour rendition. The sound is presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo.

In summary then, this production is likely to give much satisfaction and can offer a setting of the correct period and with a cast that can both sing and act well. The recording has good production values with excellent surround sound and good camera work. It takes its place among other recent fine issues such as those at Glyndebourne and The Met and personal preferences will be the deciding factor when it comes to choosing which to buy. All three listed above are equally fine in their differing ways. In my opinion this is a worthy 5 star issue and should give much musical and dramatic satisfaction to future purchasers.",1343520000,5,3769,4.825077399380805
3521073,4,B001CZVVXW,"This is a recording from a live performance by the Royal Opera House. It is an outstanding performance all around.

First of all the music: All singers were excellent (or even better.)  Carmen (Anna Caterina Antonacci) sung well with emotion and deep conviction.  Don Jos (Jonas Kaufman) was also excellent albeit with some sharp edges occasionally.  Micala (Norah Amsellem) was simply outstanding.  She was so effortless with such a sweet way of singing, perfectly suited to her role in the opera.  Escamillo (Ildebrando D'Arcangelo) was excellent from a technical point of view, but he was a bit stiff in his manner.  He does not have many arias, but he sings some of the most popular and well known songs.

Next the peripherals: the acting, the set design, the costumes, all that stuff that is secondary to the music (for me), but still makes the experience so much richer, if well done.  In this regard, this was one of the best acted Carmen performances I have ever seen.  Antonacci was outstanding with her emotion in bringing out the best of Carmen.  It does not get any better in ""Masterpiece Theater"" than what she did in this performance.  Other principals were also excellent actors. Set design was minimalist (I mean minimalist in the utmost.) Costumes were good, appropriate for the period.

Next the Blu-Ray: it was disappointing. It was hard to believe that I was watching a Blu-Ray disk.  I can call it at best a decent DVD.  Blu-Ray requires sophisticated cinematography and HD recording, and you don't get it in this version.  Recently I bought several opera performances on Blu-Ray.  One of them, a Tosca performance had an incredibly well made Blu-Ray recording (and cinematography), and I could not help compare the recording quality of the two.  (You can see my review of Tosca if you type ""Tosca blu ray"" at the Amazon search box.)  If it was not for this, this performance deserves five stars every other way.",1325721600,6,1933,4.838414634146342
3521074,5,B001CZVVXW,"This is a great video and audio treat. While Anna Caterina Antonacci doesn't have quite the voice of Leontyne Price (arguably the best vocal Carmen of all time), she certainly looks and acts the part superbly. The rest of the company is excellent as well. A wonderful production.",1264809600,2,279,4.833333333333333
3521075,4,B001CZVVXW,"I enjoyed this production from the first moment to the last and would have given it 5 stars if they hadn't cut the openning of the final scene.  I love this opera, have heard it over and over and it never gets tired.  How can anybody justify cutting the openning chorus of the final scene?",1245974400,12,289,4.236363636363636
3521076,4,B001CZVVXW,"This is a difficult production to criticise as there is a lot of passion and fine acting and singing from Anna Antonacci as Carmen and Jonas Kaufmann as Don Jose BUT the balance between the vocalists and the orchestra is wrong.
The audio quality is fine with the orchestral sound excellent but it dominates the vocalists with their sound recessed and distant. Add in that Ildebrando D'Arcangelo is a less than compelling Escamilo making this production a limited success.
A pity because the vocal/orchestra unbalance is the fault of the engineers who by this bad audio mixing have depreciated the efforts of some very fine singing. My previous favourite Carmen was also a Covent Garden effort but 15 years earlier and on laserdisc. I put it on just to see if my memory was an illusion but no, Maria Ewing is a sensational Carmen AND the vocal/orchestral mix on this LD production is what it should have been on the latest BluRay. But the video quality on this old laserdisc is pretty ghastly with washed out colours so no real competition to the 2006 effort.
Many of the scenes are dark and this has not favoured otherwise clear picture quality. So I have only given this BluRay video 4/5 overall.
So there you are, glorious orchestral sound but the overall audio balance not good. That said it is a great, tuneful and dramatic opera. It is not a disaster, but a bit of a disappointment for me.",1245542400,11,1394,4.647773279352227
8290553,4,B001CZVVXW,"This is a very physical, powerful rendition of Carmen.  Given that it takes place in Spain the sweat on the actors seems completely appropriate.  The use of some of the dialogue is helpful -- this is the first time I have heard a Carmen with dialogue.  The sound (I listened using DTS HD master audio) was fine.  On a 53 inch high definition screen the images were wonderful with great clarity and color intensity.  The sets were simple but evocative and localized the action.  I prefer the Maria Ewing King's Court version even though the setting is more abstract.  My favorite Carmen remains Rise Stevens and I treasure the CDs of her performance.",1523577600,,649,4.6902654867256635

Sorry, call me old fashioned, but I'd rate this for ""mature"", audiences that like nasty, sweaty, slutty performances...and that's not for me.",1412899200,3,428,5.085714285714285
8290561,5,B001CZVVXW,"I was surprised to realize that I have Antonacci performing in a Don Carlo production from La Scala in 1989! She has only grown since then and she more than holds her own against Kaufmann and D'Arcangelo here, tough competition!
From her entrance, she is able to display her thoughts, emotions and motivations on her  face and in her movements. She has the vocal and acting talents and skill to back it up.
I watched three other recent Carmen videos and listened to the remastered 1951 Reiner Carmen with Rise Stevens n the same weeks as this one. Even after 60+ years, Stevens come right thru the speakers to seduce us. Antonacci does almost as well vocally, and delivers a vivid and sometimes gritty portrait that is irresistible.
Kaufmann here is well integrated in the story, starting with his go-to confused, whiny overaged teenager persona, confused by Carmen's attention, and then obsessed by her. He is here content to use his gorgeous piano and mezza voce tones. He can be so seductively communicative when he uses that voice.
Ildebrando D'Arcangelo is about the best Escamillo I have ever heard, with a wonderfully resonant bass voice and impeccable musicality. It doesn't hurt to have him arrive on a black stallion!
This is my favorite Carmen, but the MET Carmen has lots of positives, and there is a Sferisterio Carmen on Dynamic that I wouldn't give up. Each shows different facets of the characters and the story.
I did not love the Zurich Carmen and this is definitely the one to have if you love Kaufmann.
I used to bum around Europe hitting opera houses and I can tell you, the videos are relatively so CHEAP!
I miss going, but I love staying home...",1412726400,,1668,4.712328767123288
8290562,3,B001CZVVXW,"The great reviews are a bit of a surprise to me. This production is acceptably well done but the singing, particularly of Antonacci, comes nowhere near the deep erotic sensuousness of Maria Callas. I would surmise from seeing and hearing several Carmens that Callas is the gold standard.

The acting is acceptable. At times, the acting seems a little out of sync with the action. As much as I love Kaufmann, I saw no moment where he went from Momma's boy to madly in love with Carmen. This is common with Kaufmann---he is no doubt the world's best tenor (currently) but his love scenes lack credibility. I had this same feeling in Lohengrin when he declares his love for Elsa. Really? And he never seemed that interested in Marguerite (Faust)---though the Faust production is more recent and his acting is much better now that it was 5 years ago. This opera is a bit like Carmen meets Siegfried.

No points deducted for Kaufmann's singing. Excellent.

The staging is very good. It all works.

This is worth adding to your collection. I am collecting operas in which Kaufmann appears without shoes. Add this one.

Your comments are welcome and I will reply as time permits.",1409443200,2,1172,4.7254901960784315
