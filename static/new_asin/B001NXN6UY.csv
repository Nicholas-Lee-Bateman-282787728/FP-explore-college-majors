8328120,5,B001NXN6UY,"My primary interest is in the history of the Spanish Borderlands and the American West.  ""Los Primeros"" examines current equestrian and cattle raising traditions by going to their sources in Spain and Mexico.  The video starts with an examination of Spanish Doma Vaquera and Garrocha traditions and moves onto the Charro traditions of Jalisco, Mexico.  The video then follows these traditions as they moved and evolved in Alta California during the Colonial period. What I found most fascinating as person whose interest is in history was the survival of these Vaquero traditions in the Western United States.  This production spends a lot of time explaining modern day equestrian techniques and equipment.  Before this video, I had never heard of the Bosal, Macate or the Hackamore technique of training horses.  I found this practical, hands on approach to explaining history to be fascinating.  Highly recommended!",1422316800,,917,5.326388888888889
8328121,5,B001NXN6UY,"Perhaps the best (and my favorite so far) of the entire Vaquero series.

If you'd like to know the history of the Vaqueros and their influence on modern day American cowboys, this video is for you.",1393200000,,197,4.472222222222222
8328122,5,B001NXN6UY,"There is a number of these get them all. Some reviews are critical but I found them all to be a joy to watch. I have a friend who borrows mine for months at a time and I have to beg to get them back so I think his wife is buying the whole series for him. Not only do they educate us on a earlier time, but these folks work hard everyday, rain, snow or heat, no whiners allowed!!! How many of our young people today even have a clue where a steak comes from BEFORE it gets to the market. One at a time or the whole series , get them and enjoy.",1386374400,,542,3.7217391304347824
