to start the sport. Seeing and watching makes it more understanable and safety first.",1339545600,2,175,4.5
8291588,1,B001D41NQC,"If you already are familiar with archery then try the next volume.  This video is really for people that never picked up a bow.  You can find more useful information off of youtube.  But I guess if you're an absolute beginner and you wanted to get a nice complete introduction to the sport then this would be fine. For my purposes and its price, I gave it 1 star, however for the novice it would be a two.",1288742400,12,405,4.166666666666667
8291589,1,B001D41NQC,"The author's review should not be published as a customer review. Include the video as a
sales pitch.
The two DVDs by Lloyd Brown appear to present one of the more brazen ripoffs
at Amazon. 32 minutes for beginners at $26.99 and 37 minutes for Advanced at $30 totalling
69 minutes at $56.99 are one of the most expensive dvds around at about 83 cents per minute
of material that could have all been presented in 15 minutes for about $15.
You can get all of the symphonies of the greatest composers for less than the cost
of these two DVDs.
For about twice the cost of these things you can buy a good recurve bow, a few arrows, a target
and learn to shoot with a few hours practice and some basic instruction from the store where
you got the equipment.
Good material from a fine instructor on a great sport at an absurdly high price.
The USAA should scold him for discouraging potential members with such
profiteering.",1285718400,24,917,4.431952662721893
