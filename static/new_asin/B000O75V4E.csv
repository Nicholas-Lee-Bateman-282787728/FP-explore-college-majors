8494819,5,B000O75V4E,"I'm a huge fan of What Not To Wear. With the show having gone off the air, I'm now monthly buying on Amazon episodes from the first four seasons that I've never seen (which means the show hasn't ended for me ... woot, woot!) Anyone reading any WNTW review I do should know:
1) I'm only doing these reviews to give the ep 5 stars; I will give EVERY ep 5 stars as a nod to the general greatness of WNTW. I admit I'm biased. (But really, if the knowledge, fun, and drama aren't enough, the brilliance and wit of Stacy and Clinton push every ep to a 5 anyway.)
2) While I don't have time for big writeups on each DVD, a few observations: This ep was amazing, and it had nothing to do with the exploits of the Fantastic Four (who were awesome, as usual). What was incredible was the amount of skin that nice young Atlanta realtor Irene was showing in a work setting. The ep had plenty of clever real estate puns, yet to put the situation in perspective I'll trot out one of the only ones I don't believe was used ... location, location, location. As in, the location of her skirts was too high, the location of her necklines was too low, and the location of my jaw was on the floor. Seriously, for a second I thought I was watching one of the higher-numbered cable channels! But this, of course, made for some hilarious moments in the ambush and 360, and when things calmed down it was obvious she was going to look stunning. She did, and it was sweet how grateful she was. A truly memorable installment!
3) Oh yeah, the cost ... $19.95 for one ep? WTF! I'm a big enough fan of this great show, and have the resources, to buy them. But do I see anybody else purchasing them? Nope. And does anyone have any ideas how I can get DVDs of eps from the middle seasons????",1468281600,,1760,4.210059171597633
