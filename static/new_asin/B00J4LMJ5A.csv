8648112,3,B00J4LMJ5A,Not too good--Tom Berenger fans might like this--I am a fan but this one is bad.  A TV movie that needs a little help in plot development.  Not much of a plot anyway==TV movie with no commercials is what it is.  Avoid if possible.  Amber alert story with no substance.,1424390400,,268,4.3

8648114,4,B00J4LMJ5A,"I'm a huge Tom Berenger fan and while he was great in his role in this movie, I thought the teenagers roles were pretty weak...in other words, either they were under-acting, over-acting...or couldn't act....and the pace with them were slow at best.",1420329600,2,248,4.928571428571429
