3736609,5,B001OXLGJG,This show is great and I hope Disney continues to keep it going. My Grandsons like to watch it (Great excuse to watch it with them since I've been a Spider-Man fan since the comics in the 60's. In these episodes Peter Parker/Spider-Man is still a teenager in high school so children can relate more to him. It's not campy like the cartoon show from the 60's. Hopefully they will release the 90's show on DVD before long.,1268438400,,420,4.397435897435898
3736610,4,B001OXLGJG,"""THE SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAN"" has won a lot of viewers due to its modern theme and its ability to attract and entertain Spider-Man fans of all ages.

""THE SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAN"" is definitely a series for the next generation.  Peter Parker is no longer the bookworm that is an outcast in the whole school.  No glasses, no bad clothing and no self-esteem issues like the original teenager of the comic book series.  In fact, the spider he has been bit by is not radioactive but genetically altered.

This Peter Parker is cooler and even sports a man bag (or school bag) and has a birthmark.

In volume 3, Spider-Man learned that the Big Man is Tombstone and that he will be in for a major surprise when he finds out the identity of the Green Goblin.

The episodes in volume two are as follows:

Episode 7 - Catalysts - It's the Midtown High Fall Formal and Peter Parker brings his date, Mary Jane Watson, a beautiful red head that his Aunt May set up.  Meanwhile, the Green Goblin makes his appearance and he challenges the Big Man aka Tombstone.

Episode 8 - Reaction - As Dr. Otto Octavius is working on an experiment to create more super villains, the Green Goblin locks him in that experiment room and transforms Octavius to the Dr. Octopus.

Episode 9 - The Uncertainty Principle - While Colonel John Jameson tries to land his damaged space shuttle, Spider-Man battles Green Goblin and learns of his true identity.

As mentioned, ""THE SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAN"" is definitely a series that has caught a lot of attention and even IGN has voted it as #30 in their ""TOP 100 BEST ANIMATED TV SHOWS"" poll.  Unlike other Spider-Man animated series, Spider-Man's physique matches a young teenager (as it should).

And for us older folks used to the classic animated series or older comic books and have young children, there is always something entertaining with Spider-Man throughout the years, no matter how much it differs from what we grew up with, the soul of Spider-Man and the characters are faithful but adjusted for modern times.

And it's definitely a series that we can watch and enjoy with our children.  Another fun and exciting volume of ""The Spectacular Spider-Man"".

VIDEO & AUDIO:

Video is presented in 1:78:1 anamorphic widescreen. Animation is nice and vibrant.  Lines are clean, characters and objects are simple with shadows and not as much detail when it comes to the backgrounds.  But the choice to do this was to replicate fluidity of Spider-Man in the films. But overall, the animation is good and clean.

Audio is presented in English 5.1 (Dolby Digital) and French (Dolby Surround).

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are no special features but trailers/previews.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""THE SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAN"" has been a pretty solid series thus far.  Again, it's not the Spider-Man I grew up with but for a new generation watching this, it's adapted for a modern setting, its animated much differently than any Spider-Man animations in the past but everything works.

Watching it with my son, I think it was great to find a series that would be appealing to the young children, teenagers and the adults.

I've read several interviews with series developers Victor Cook and Greig Weisman and both are Spider-Man fans but also fans of other genres such as Hong Kong films and also grabbing ideas from different eras, may it be from ""Ultimate Spider-Man"", the films and thus certain purists may have a hard time with it but again, as a fan of the comic books and the many incarnations of Spider-Man animated series, whats important is that this series remains faithful to the characters.

Sure, they may have different storylines of how the villains became to be what they are but still, the essence of who Peter Parker is and having to be this hero but yet knowing that it will affect his personal relationships with those close to him is still intact.

Episodes 7-9 was enjoyable as the previous episodes.  And I like how the series captures the relationship (or lack of) the Osborn family between Harry and his father and how the Green Goblin is quite central to that storyline.  And you know, when the Green Goblin is around, expect to see quite a bit of action between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin.

Also, it's interesting to see how the Big Man (L. Thompson Lincoln) aka Tombstone will be used in the series.  So, far he has been able to manhandle Spider-Man and because his company and his character is so integral in the series, especially with the other villains, it will be interesting to see how long he will stick around.

Overall, a fun and enjoyable series thus far.  For those who are budget conscious, waiting for a full season may be of your best interested.  I wished there was some sort of special feature included on the DVD but overall, an animated series that both young and old can enjoy.  Check it out!",1237420800,,4841,4.753293413173653
3736611,5,B001OXLGJG,This is my favorite spidey cartoon since the 90's and any spidey fan would love to have this in their collection regardless of their age anyone would love it!,1237248000,,158,4.482758620689655
3736612,3,B001OXLGJG,"My sons (ages 6 and 4) love this new animated series, The Spectacular Spider-Man. The show is much better suited for younger audiences than Spider-Man's last animated series, which lasted only one season on MTV in 2003.

This series features all of Spider-Man's most famous villians, including the Green Goblin, Venom, Doctor Octopus, Sandman, Vulture, Rhino and Electro. In Volume 3, Peter Parker finds himself amidst more dangerous arch enemies, including the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus and Tombstone.

If you absolutely must buy a DVD right now (birthday present, etc.) this is a good choice for Spider-Man fans. Amazon has the DVD priced $5 below suggested retail price ($19.95) and this is a good choice for young children who love Spider-Man.

The more economical decision is to wait for a DVD set release of all 26 episodes from Seasons 1 and 2, which should be priced around $30. It was announced earlier this year that Season 2 would move from the CW network to Disney XD. Season 2 is scheduled to begin in March 2009. However, the Spectacular Spider-Man ended production after completing the 26th episode (the end of Season 2). A third season might happen, depending on the ratings Season 2 gets on Disney XD.

In summary, I'd rate The Spectacular Spider-Man series five stars based on the entertainment value for young superhero fans. The shows are accessible without being too scary or adult for the under-10 audience. However, by marketing the first season into four DVDs, I deduct two stars. The series is overpriced, especially in light of the current economy.",1235692800,8,1577,4.984790874524715
