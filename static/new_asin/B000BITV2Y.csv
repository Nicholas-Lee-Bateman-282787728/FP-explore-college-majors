8087154,4,B000BITV2Y,"Monogram Pictures presents ""BULLETS AND SADDLES"" (29 October 1943) (54 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- With the success of Republic's Three Mesquiteers, several forces came together around 1940 to develop a new 'trigger trio' for the screen --- The star was Ray 'Crash' Corrigan, a producer named George W. Weeks and Monogram Pictures --- With a character of his own name. Ray starred in 20 of the 24 films in this series between 1940 and 1943 --- The Range Busters was clearly a lower budget copy of the Mesquiteers --- Big, muscular Ray 'Crash' Corrigan was the lead, the second lead was John 'Dusty' King, a big band singer (Ben Bernie Orchestra) with a reasonably good baritone, who would vocalize a tune or two in each film --- And comic relief was in the hands of ventriloquist Max 'Alibi' Terhune (and his wise-cracking dummy Elmer --- Monogram would distribute the Range Busters but not be directly involved in the productions --- The deal gave Corrigan a substantial share of the film profits (in an interview years later, Ray said he received 50%).

The story line and plot, Our heroes Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan (Himself), Denny Moore (Dennis Moore) and Alibi (Max Terhune) members of the Range Busters in their 24th outing and last film in the series finds the cowboy trio riding to the rescue in all their black & white glory --- Jack Hammond (Glenn Strange) is after the Craig ranch and has framed Charlie Craig (Budd Buster) for murder --- Mother Craig (Rose Plumer) brings in the Range Busters --- They capture one of Hammond's men and Alibi plans to trick him into a confession as to who the real murderer is --- Meanwhile, Denny has overheard Hammond's plans for his next move and he and Crash set out to round up the gang --- Crash Corrigan, Max Terhune and Dennis Moore make a very good western trio and this film has plenty of action --- Corrigan, a veteran of the Three Mesquiteers series, always was at his best when included in these type of pairings --- Max Terhune is funny here and continues to be a good comic foil. Glenn Strange was a fine villain in this one and a good match for the determined heroes --- Strange was later a regular as Sam the Bartender in the Gunsmoke TV Series.
