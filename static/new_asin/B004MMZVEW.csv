8436103,5,B004MMZVEW,"I got this DVD from the library and am now sold on getting more of her workout DVD's.  I love her approach, in the beginning she clearly tells you how to do each workout and then goes through it with you.  I have learned new tricks and correct body position to do these workouts correctly and effectively.  I also love that she is going through this workout with great momentum, she gives it what she's got and is sweating, as you should be, during the workout.  I am at an average fitness level, and felt that she was really helpful with giving some alternatives to make some of the excersises more doable.  But I know if I stick with her DVD's I will get stronger and be able to do it all.  And if you are in great shape I think this will challenge you and keep you fit and agile.  No frills, just a great workout!  Love it!",1320192000,,826,4.150943396226415
