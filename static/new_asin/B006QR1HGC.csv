8503102,5,B006QR1HGC,"If you can even find a copy of this, get it. It is an excellent compilation of well edited training tapes by a master combatives instructor. Bob Kasper was the real deal. He ran with some of the most dedicated and knowledgeable folks in the field of combatives. His books, his knife designs, and these tapes speak for themselves. He was a lifelong and passionate student of combatives in general and knife combatives in particular. You will learn much.",1525737600,,452,4.734177215189874

8503104,5,B006QR1HGC,"I was not sure what to expect from this video since it was mostly lost tapes. Well, it is not just a collection of Kasper's teachings but, actually a sequence of his techniques filmed during actual classes. Not only a historical video but one you can learn from. I'm very glad I obtained it because it is very straight forward in his concepts and relatively easy to learn if you put the time. Some systems may take longer time and may be more complex, so, if you don't have that time Kasper's system can offer simple moves to gain that may help in a moments notice. All you have to do is have a partner and drill drill drill.",1452816000,,625,4.260504201680672
8503105,5,B006QR1HGC,"Old videos edited together to form these informative lessons. If you've heard of Bob numerous times and wanted to understand more about his training ideology and methods, then here it is.",1449360000,,187,5.064516129032258
8503106,5,B006QR1HGC,"This is one of the best knife fighting videos on the market. I was hesitant at first on ordering it since it was a collection of seminar and class training videos but the editing is very well done. There is a ton of information. It doesnt matter if you just now picked up a knife or have been training for years, you will learn something from this video.",1437523200,3,354,4.220588235294118
8503107,5,B006QR1HGC,"This is the real deal.  No nonsense techniques, drills and advice from a man who dedicated his life to keeping it real.
As the title suggests, these DVDs are from efforts to record seminars and lessons and not meant to be a commercial product in themselves. At times the sound or angle of the camera is less than ideal, but the wealth of knowledge more than off sets the minor inconveniences. It is so far above the average martial arts DVDs it's in a class by itself.
Before ordering, I thought the DVD would be a rehash of his book Sting of the Scorpion and just be a demo of those techniques. If it was it would still be a great buy. No, there are many more things here than the book contains. The book is the basics (and I highly recommend it; I've read it MANY times) and the DVDs take it to a whole new level. There are lots of street applications, drills and information that is only hinted at in other sources.
So, buy the book,read and re-read it and  then be amazed by these DVDs.",1411516800,4,990,4.232804232804233
8503108,5,B006QR1HGC,"This two disk DVD set is truly priceless!  ""It's like having Bob Kasper as your own private instructor.""  (The system of Kni-com has been updated since the release of these DVDs; nonetheless the instruction given coincides well with the books released by Paladin Press after Bob's death.)  This is the best reality-based combat knife fighting you'll (EVER) find for the money!!!  R.I.P. Bob ... ""you were one-hell-of-a-combatives' instructor!""

HIGHLY ... HIGHLY ... HIGHLY ... RECOMMEND

""A SIX-STAR PRODUCT!""",1374364800,4,510,5.4743589743589745
8503109,5,B006QR1HGC,"Very good instruction here, a good compliment to Kasper's book ""The Sting Of The Scorpion"". I highly reccommend this DVD set.",1373932800,,125,5.0
8503110,5,B006QR1HGC,"I knew very little about Bob but I did know that Kelly McCann was a colleague of his through the GHCA, and that Kelly thought highly of Bob's KNI-COM skillset, so I took a chance on this DVD, and am glad that I did.

Bob's methods make a lot of sense and I have incorporated them into my own training.

Well worth the money.",1370908800,,324,4.046875
