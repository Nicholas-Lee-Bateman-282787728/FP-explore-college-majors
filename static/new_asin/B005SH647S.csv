Although Miroku & Sango get new chances by Miroku testing a poison so he can no longer feel pain when he uses his windtunnel & Sango, her Hiraikotsu or giant boomerang gains a new power. Namely it can now draw on & shatter demonic ora as I've heard some say Sango's Hiraikotsu becomes supercharged, if Takashi did a new profiles book Sango's Hiraikotsu would have at least a 1 to 11/2 power scale markup. Hakoudoshi is also drawn into Miroku's windtunnel in episode 1, and Naraku doesn't protect him knowing Hakoudoshi, is planning to kill him, OVERALL A MUST HAVE FOR ANY FAN OF THE ORIGINAL INUYASHA!!!!!!.",1385769600,,701,4.661290322580645

4885142,4,B005SH647S,I love Inuyasha series. I'm just a little upset because there is an episode missing. The episode where it explains how Hiraikotsuh breaks. They jumped from Kanna's dead to repairing hiraikotsuh. They don't show the episode in between. WB or whoever put togheter the episodes screwed it. Is it just my DVD that doesn't have episode?

Little did I realize that the last bits were considered a completely different series and done years later.  THANKFULLY, I didn't have to wait as long as the inital fans to have my resolution.  Most all the classic characters are back.  Some don't last long, and some only get a cameo, but they're there!  I won't say any more to avoid spoilers.

So having the Final Act in ENGLISH is MUCH BETTER!! One minor gripe I got used to real fast was that I hated Kagome's new voice actor, as well as Seshomaru... but I grew to like them! Final Act Part 2 is JUST as BETTER as the first part!",1366416000,,408,3.927710843373494
4885168,5,B005SH647S,I always love inuyasha! I'm glad that my collection is finally complete!!They changed the voice actor and voice actress of the original cast and it was disappointing but at least they completed the story.

4885170,5,B005SH647S,"Scammed us a bit in releasing the final season in two parts, but that's not uncommon anymore. As for the story, I'd say it's a good ending for an old and favorite series. Nice that they actually allowed them to go back and finish it out properly. (rather than leaving it hanging or cramming it into a movie). At times it wanders off track on side stories and character development, at first it seemed annoying, but then I realized, that fits the Inuyasha series perfectly, character development and the person touch are the hallmarks of this series. Personally I think they did an excellent job with this and made an ending befitting this excellent series.",1365292800,,656,4.71304347826087

4885174,5,B005SH647S,"Okay, Sesshoumaru is my favorite character, And I was a little worried that the guy who plays him is different from the regular Inuyasha, but the guy does great. Sesshoumaru does a great deal more talking in The Final Act, but his voice is almost the same - to me, anyway. Kagome's voice is different, Too, but it's like Kagome has gotten older and grown up a little, So if you think of her that way, the different voice isn't so horrible. All in all, couldn't be happier I bought it. Love this show, but I'm sad it's finally over...",1364342400,,533,4.34
4885175,5,B005SH647S,"I've been waiting for this forever, it seems.  While the entire us voice cast did not return, it does not take away from the quality of this work.  If you want the full flavor Of Rumiko's work read the manga as it explores more about what's happening and why in relation to The bad guys  schemes.  I do not want to put any spoilers here.  But an incredible amount was achieved in the little time they had for presentation, story telling purposes.  The manga offers so much more info.  Parts 1 and 2 are visual delights.  And the perfect compliment to your Inuyasha collection.  It would be incomplete without this set.  Enjoy, it's worth every penny.

I have watched the entire series in English and was anticipating this release, but I have to subtract 1 star for splitting the season in two (with no extras or fluff) and another star for the voice acting.  I understand that time had passed and that it was difficult to get some of the voice actors back, but it is not just Kagome and Sesshomaru.  Half the the cast sounds different.  If it is going to sound different, why not pay less to get the entire season.

The only way I can imagine enjoying this as much as the rest of the story is if I never listen to the other episodes again.  Even then, 10 years of hearing the original voices is not going to fade over night.",1359158400,,787,4.144736842105263

I couldn't believe that my favorite anime would have such a ridiculous ending.  Despite how much I hated the ending, I decided to collect the series anyway because I loved it that much, but then I found out that The Final Act was being dubbed in English.  Although I was completely ecstatic, I tried not to get my hopes up for the end result, but it turns out that there was no need to worry.  The Final Act Set 1 was absolutely fantastic!!!  My sister and I devoured the show faster than I would've believed possible.  Although I was originally annoyed by the new voice of Kagome, it eventually grew on me.  I was a little surprised, however by how rushed the dubbing seemed to be.  (The episode titles are still written in the original Japanese, which was to say at the very least, 'a little surprising') In the end I didn't really mind though.  Altogether, this is definitely the best money I've ever spent.  The set came right on time and was as advertised.

The story goes at a much faster clip than the original series, mainly because they needed to condense the story from about 20 volumes of manga to 26 episodes.  I am disappointed also that they were not able to get the original voice actors, most notably Kagome's and Sesshomaru.( especially disappointing because Sesshomaru has a decent role in this part of the story.) However, that said, their replacements do a very good job and probably only the most devoted fans will care at all.

I was devestated to say the least.  So with no alterantive in sight I went and read the chapters of the manga which concluded some time ago.  When it was revealed that they were going to animate the final chapters of Inuyasha I did a little jump for joy.

when they released final act part 1 I was upset. Why didn't they release all 26 episodes all at once?!?
I was excited enough to buy it the day of release.
When I saw the episodes. It wasn't as bad as you think. They did a great job on sesshomaru's voice! Me and my sister didn't notice much of a difference. As for Kagome, it was a little weird at first.

But it's something that I expected no less coming from a manga series from Rumiko Takahashi, one of my favorite manga-ka's in Japan known for anime TV series hits such as ""Urusei Yatsura"", ""Maison Ikkoku"", ""Ranma 1/2 and ""InuYasha"".

In Japan, Takahashi has written 56 volumes for ""InuYasha"" and the first 167 episodes aired on Yomiuri TV from 2000-2004.  As many long anime series go on break in order for the mangaka to work on the manga series or the animators create a story on their own that is different from the manga, fortunately the anime series was put on hold for several years in order to have Takahashi finish the series.

By 2009, the second series ""InuYasha: The Final Act"" (26-episodes) began airing on Yomiuri TV from Oct. 2009 through March 2010 and now will be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Viz Media with the first 13 episodes slated for release in November 2012.

""InuYasha: The Final Act"" is based on the last 21 volumes of the manga series.  The original staff and cast of the series returned for this final season and would feature the continuing storyline of InuYasha, Kagome, Miroku, Sango, Shippo and Kirara searching for the final fragments of the shattered shikon jewel and prepare for their final battle against Naraku.

In the first half of the series, InuYasha and friends to all they can to find the remaining final shards but so is Naraku.  The fight against Naraku continues as one character is killed and another uses power to the maximum to the point of nearly killing themselves.  Meanwhile, one confesses their love and in the process, their power grows.

Find out who lives, who dies and who becomes more powerful in the first half of ""InuYasha: The Final Act"".

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""InuYasha: The Final Act"" definitely shows the animated differences from the previous seasons created nearly a decade ago.  With today's use of computers and better utilization of CG and more detailed artwork, ""InuYasha: The Final Act"" looks better. Not only are art backgrounds much more detailed but you can tell that Sunrise didn't lax on this TV series, they did a wonderful job in animation and with the art backgrounds and making Rumiko Takashi's manga series come alive!

As for the audio, audio is presented in 2.0 and both languages are done quite well. The English dubbed seems a bit more clearer and a little louder coming through my front speakers over the Japanese track but overall, it's a purely dialogue driven anime and there are no 5.1ch tracks, so it's pretty much a front-channel driven soundtrack. For ""Ranma 1/2 fans, you will see the reunion of Ranma 1/2 voice actor Kappei Yamaguchi (Ranma) return as the voice for InuYasha which was pretty cool and also Noriko Hidaka (""Ranma 1/2 character Akane) as Kikyo.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""InuYasha: The Final Act"" comes with:

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to anime series, especially long running series, rarely do you see one going on hiatus in order for the manga artist to create newer material or to finish up their series.  We have seen it many times before with series such as ""Dragon Ball z"", ""Naruto"", ""Bleach"", long series that had its challenges of trying to allow the author to develop the manga series and so, what ends up happening is that readers are treated with many filler episodes.  Or similar to ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" or ""Hellsing"", the writers create their own storyline.

But in Japan, there are few mangaka where studios will bow down to when it comes to creator control and one of the most well-known mangaka in Japan is Rumiko Takahashi, creator of ""Urusei Yatsura"", ""Maison Ikkoku"", ""Ranma 1/2 to name a few.

And with a hiatus that has lasted eight years, the manga series and now the anime series is now complete in Japan and with the release of ""InuYasha: The Final Act"" on Blu-ray and DVD, fans who have waited a long time, can now finally watch and see how the series will end.

I have always felt that when it comes to an anime television series based on a Rumiko Takahashi manga, you really can't go wrong. Her first three are classics in their own right and ""InuYasha"" will surely join the others as not only popular hit manga series but also great anime TV series of all time. There are not too many manga creators who have a lot of their works get the anime adaptation that spawn many films, CD drama series and soundtracks and also a lot of merchandise. For Rumiko Takahashi, she's had three decades worth of series that have lasted for a long time and even today, fans still crave her works because they can be watched any time and they are good now as they were then.

But when it comes to ""InuYasha"", where I've had such a strong affinity towards her previous releases and even ""Ranma 1/2, I have to admit, ""InuYasha"" is a solid series and there was not many episodes that were bland or ""OK"", they were all very good and again, there are not many TV series where I want to continue watching nearly every episode in one sitting.

So, everything is fantastic about this series but are there any negatives with this DVD release?  Well, I'm sure one can argue that they wish all 26-episodes were released as one volume and some can wish that there were more special features included.  But it's hard to argue since Viz Media has always broken up their DVD's into volumes and rarely release full collections.  And as for special features, while past ""InuYasha"" collections had some rare swag included in the limited edition releases, pretty much all you're going to get is a Japanese trailer.  Yes, Japan's DVD release of ""InuYasha: The Final Act"" received a bonus DVD, a calendar and DJ CD but Viz Media has not really released limited edition DVD releases for many years now.

But as for the series itself, ""InuYasha: The Final Act"" is what many people expected to see.  Characters risking their lives to take down Naraku and not only does a character die, but we also get to see others nearly get killed as they sacrificed themselves for the greater good or to save the person they love.

Right now these 13-episodes are just a build-up of what is coming up for the second and final half.  Things have been slowly building from the final fragments being found to those making decisions on who's side they will fight on and why.  Others have developed purpose, courage and a few secrets will be revealed.

Sesshomaru learns the truth about his sword Tenseiga, Kikyo discovers a secret regarding Naraku and the race to obtaining the shards becomes deadlier.

I personally can't wait to see how ""InuYasha: The Final Act"" ends and if you are a fan who have watched the series for a long time and have been waiting for this conclusio of this anime-series, it's a no-brainer...""InuYasha: The Final Act DVD Set 1 is recommended!",1354233600,,7163,4.702962369895917
4885267,5,B005SH647S,"After waiting so long and wondering if Viz would ever release this, it is finally here.  I just received and finished watching set one of ""The Final Act"", and while I still wish we had not had to wait so long, the wait was worth it.
My biggest worries were the voice replacements for Kagome and Sesshomaru.  Everyone will of course have their own opinions on how well the replacements have done, but I think they both did an admirable job.  Coming from me, a HUGE Sesshomaru fan, that is high praise indeed.  I was initially heartbroken when I found out David Kaye would not be able to return to voice Shesshomaru.  In Shessomaru's first scene when he opened his mouth to speak, I held my breath.  Alas, I will miss David Kaye's amazing voice, but Michael Dangerfield does very well.  In my heart I tell myself that the alteration in Shesshomaru's voice comes from his change of heart...it works for me!
There has been so much to love about this series.  Fantasy, adventure, sword fighting, amazing animation, humor, Japanese setting, great characters.  The characters!  One of the best things about this series, and this first set of The Final Act, is seeing how much the characters have grown and changed.  A few of course change for the worse, but for the most part we get to see all of them grow and change for the better.  They become stronger, more courageous, more compassionate, wiser.  While I do not want to give spoilers, I will say that the death of one character in particular was among the most beautiful and touching I have ever seen anywhere.  Have tissues handy.
If you have been a fan of Inuyasha for years, or have recently discovered it, I don't think this Final Act will disappoint.  I myself discovered it years ago, by accident while channel surfing late one night.  I will always be so glad I did!",1354233600,,1821,4.574074074074074
4885268,4,B005SH647S,"I love InuYasha--the English dub better than the sub, but Stori voicing Kagome is a big part of that. There are a few other actors I'd accept doing her voice--Brina Palencia and Christine Auten being just two of them, but the new person voicing Kagome for The Final Act just falls short (by more than a little).

So, 5 stars for the original work and 3 stars for a voice cast without Moneca Stori (though everyone else is still excellent) gives this 4 stars. At least one can still watch the sub.",1354147200,,496,4.391304347826087

What a tragedy:( but still InuYasha is my favorite Japanese anime. Besides full metal alchemist, fruits basket, Ouran high school host club, and Eureka seven!!! But none of them compare to InuYasha!!! So I'm happy it's coming out none the less. I just wished all the old cast could have done it. It will be super weird without the same voice for Kagome.

My expectations were exceeded. The colors are more vibrant than I've ever seen them, the picture is crystal clear and the audio quality (DTS HD Japanese and English) is fantastic. Translation of the Japanese version is done generally well (I speak Japanese). Worth every cent paid for it and more. This is a high quality Blu-ray release and I cannot recommend it highly enough, especially for fans of Inuyasha! Note that this is only the first half of Inuyasha: The Final Act, with the latter part coming in February 2013. If you are a fan of Inuyasha with a Blu-ray player, this is a must-buy!",1353888000,,759,4.62962962962963
4885271,5,B005SH647S,"Voices
First of all let me say this is the VIZ Media dub.  There is another dub available on the web from ANIMAX.  Avoid it.  The voices are different than the ones you are used to from the earlier discs or viewings on Adult Swim.  True, two of the main character voices (for the English dub) did not come back (Kagome and Lord Sesshomaru) but the actors replacing them are very compatible with the characters.  The sound is crisp and clear and the sub-titles are good.  The Animax dub is an inferior dub in my opinion.

Animation
CGI, but top notch.  One of the things that brought me to Inuyasha was the drawing, especially the backgrounds.  Beautifully drawn and now beautifully rendered.  No complaints about the quality or the transfer to DVD.  Looks great to me.

Story
A bit of a let down.  NO SPOILERS FROM ME.  A let down in that very soon in the last series you see that there is a formula being followed-hint---Everyone gets their episode in the sun.  One thing this final story arc does achieve is a wrapping up of 99% of all plot points.  Sometimes it is done in a very clunky fashion with lots and lots of dialog expounding on a point.  I think, IMHO, that maybe restructuring a bit would have allowed them to get the point across without these long discussions which do tend to kill some of the dramatic tension.  Still, the ending while predictable, is in its own way satisfying. There is some use of flashbacks to the original episodes to remind us of plot points, but they are generally restrained.

Extras
Extras?  What extras?  Oh, the original trailer and English cast list...YAWN!

The Splitting of the Final Arc into two sets of two discs
Some reviewers have castigated the makers for doing this, big deal.  Pretty much most of the releases of Inuyasha have been done this way. I have a bigger complaint which I expound on in the conclusion below....

Conclusion
I wish we did not have to wait this long for them to go back and finish the series!  I feel some fans dropped Inuyasha due to the break in the episodes.  Considering the large market they had in the US at that time they really should have gone for it, rather than waiting about 5yrs or so between series.  Still I am glad they did do it and I feel that the conclusion-although predictable-was a fitting conclusion to a show that was left hanging.",1353801600,15,2332,4.4904761904761905
4885272,5,B005SH647S,I loved it. I can't wait for the second half to come out. If you love Inuyasha the final act is definitely worth buying.,1353715200,,120,4.041666666666667
4885273,5,B005SH647S,"Inuyasha just stopped about 6 years ago. Nothing was resolved and everyone was pissed. Thankfully they are giving us the rest. I am thrilled. This first installment has 13 episodes. In the previous releases it would take 4 release dates to get that much ground covered. The series starts off again with some major drama. A major character, who shall remain nameless, dies almost immediately. Inuyasha and Sesshomaru also gain new powers with their swords. Sesshomaru, having cared deeply for another person, gains the power to kill with his Tensaiga. That's a good thing, since his demon sword he used is broken. Inuyasha's Tetsusaiga also gains the power to absorb demonic energy. Koga finds and has an ancient wolf demon artifact bestowed upon him. With our heroes ready to fight and stronger than ever Naraku's future is looking more bleak. Not to mention that almost all of Naraku's incarnattions have turned on him. Including the part containing his heart.

This series is getting better. The only things that I can see that are different are a few cast members. Kagome, and Sesshomaru are played by different voice actors in The Final Act. Don't worry though. Even though there is a difference, the voice actors are very good, and sound very similar to the original actors. It's easy to get used to and doesn't hurt the series at all. Props to the new cast members. Other than that little detail, Inuyasha The Final Act is what we have all come to expect and love. Maybe even a bit better. It's a must see for every anime fan.",1353456000,,1532,4.7593984962406015
4885274,4,B005SH647S,"An outstanding ending to an outstanding anime.  But make sure you have your handkerchiefs and tissues at the ready.  Naraku gets what's been coming to him, but not without a great cost.  There is much emphasis on the immense worth and transitory nature of life, as a fair number of major characters take their final bows, providing moments of profound anguish and sorrow, and all amplified by the knowledge that the adventure itself is coming to an end.  There are moments of humor, most notably in the episode centered on Shippo's fox demon training, but they are few and far between; not nearly enough to offset the somber tone that permiates the events of the main story (as was the case in the first seven seasons).  I perfer dub to sub, but this is one of those rare occasions when not even watching it subbed diminished my viewing pleasure.

As for the dubbing:  How did Viz and Ocean Studios not manage to get Moneca Stori to do Kagome with three years lead time?  Is she too busy making movies with Tom Cruise?  With all due respect to David Kaye fans, any decent Clint Eastwood imitator could fill in for him just fine.  But one of the two main characters in the story?  Viz and Ocean screwed the pooch big time on this one, and that's why I give the series four stars.  If you're fine with watching it in Japanese with sub-titles, it's worth five stars.  I mean, the story and animation are that good.  And Amazon is cheaper than many retail outlets, so you might as well get it here.  But since I already have the subbed series in Japanese, I will regretfully decline to buy this one, despite owning all the other seasons on DVD.  Viz should not make a profit off of such a late, half-hearted effort.

UPDATE 29 NOV 2012:  Just heard two excerpts from the dub.  Based on them, Moneca Stori's replacement does a good job.  But whoever replaced David Kaye as Sesshomaru is terrible.  Better to just watch the whole thing subbed.",1353456000,,1937,4.508620689655173
4885275,4,B005SH647S,"I love InuYasha, but after getting this set I am rather upset with Viz. It is unfortunate that they are the ones from whom we must buy this set. It is obvious that they put as little effort as possible into the English version of this set. They didn't even translate the title sequences. If I had not seen the Japanese version I would have missed some of what we are intended to understand.

InuYasha is great, but I am so glad that this is the only series I will ever buy from Viz. Once the series is complete, I will never buy from them again.

As far as the series itself goes, it is well worth buying. The substitutes that were made in the cast are clear, but the new voices are close enough to keep it from being a disaster. The story makes up for it.",1353369600,,756,4.101351351351352
4885276,5,B005SH647S,"Finally, after waiting for this release since October 3rd of 2009 it is here!

This Blu-ray or DVD set contains 2 discs containing episodes 1-13, both in dual audio (Eng. Dub/Jap. with English subs) - It contains little to no extras. The extras being 3 trailers or promos from the Japanese television airing back in 2009, original English dub cast list and a trailer or two for Viz Media's new anime service; Neon Alley.

I picked up the Blu-ray release and as far as the quality goes it is AMAZING on my flat screen HD TV. The colors practically pop out at you, and are bright and vivid for the most part. Originally The Final Act did not air in HD when it was broadcasting in Japan, so this is an upscaled release I am assuming, and I can't find a single flaw in the quality. This is also Viz Media's first series Blu-ray release, before TFA all they have released in Blu-ray 1080p format is the Bleach/Naruto/Berserk movies in the last year, so it is indeed a job well done on the quality.

As for the dub voice acting I enjoyed it very much. Kagome and Sesshomaru's voice actress/actor did not come back for their original roles, meaning they were both obviously replaced with a new voice actor. Kagome's voice actor will take time to get used to for most fans, but don't let it discourage you because you will grow into it, I sure did. I originally was very against her new voice actress because I've been hearing Monica Stori's voice as Kagome since I was about 8 years old now, meaning it would be a huge change for me (and I'm sure most of the fanbase as well) - Sesshomaru's voice actor I can't even tell the difference in, being 100% honest. If I wasn't specifically told that his voice actor was different I wouldn't have had a clue, that's how good it is. What it really comes down to with this release for the dub fans is giving it time, and not being impatient. It could take you a good 3-5 episodes to get used to the voice changes but it will be well worth it.

The packaging was the usual Viz Media release; bare bones and in a cheap recyclable case with a single paper advertisement for Neon Alley's streaming service on the PS3. (I got my order on November 13th from RightStuf, so I've completed this box set and reviewed all of it's contents, that is how I know all of this) - I know a lot of people were complaining about the packaging due to it not being consistent with the original series release, but who knows? Viz could decide to give TFA a re-release in 2014 if these 2 13 episode sets sell well enough, so give them your support and we could see a better release.

Long story short: pick this release up. If you are a long time InuYasha fan then give Viz Media your money (if you can) and show them we really appreciate this finally getting a release after 3+ years.

But, I just found out that the voice actor David Kaye  will not be repeating his role of Sesshomaru!!!! My heart is broken....the only voice I know and want for my beloved character of Sesshomaru is David Kaye.

Everyone else is coming back for their role, except also the voice actress for Kagome...I really don't like that character so I care less.

I will still be buying it but, the real thrill I had for this DVD is a little half hearted now. But, the animation will fantastic and it will be a great end to a great series. While I normally, would have given it a 5 star rating...I just had to give it 4 just because of Sesshomaru's voice.

I hope I will survive.",1351900800,,842,4.24375
4885278,3,B005SH647S,"i just watched this again for the second time online. honestly this is not TERRIBLE but it is not that great either. this really suffers from we all know naraku will get killed. the show has basically spoon fed this idea and that it is a happy ending show as well so therefore naruku must eventually die. unfortunently that is the problem and the way in which he dies is a bit retarded.

the good things are the music, lack of filler(so no more stupid reused sit jokes 5 times an episode or lecher jokes all over the place), and animation is quite good. the show really does look and sound good and i cannot wait to to see it on blu ray in english.

that said the overall story is terrible. naruku must die....the problem with the final act is everyone and their mom gets powered up like back to back to back. inuyashas sword loses its power like 3 or 4 times and he must defeat a foe and reclaim its power as his sword apparently cant lose the ability to absorb other swords powers. Koga even gets a new powerup but then is promptly dropped from the storyline within the first few episodes and only seen again on the last episodes ending credits wrap up section. kikyos death is memorable and one of the highlights.

sesshomoru regrows his arm somehow(the show truly does not explain this very well) in addition he gets a sword that just pops out of his body which is apparently the arm that got cut off way back in episode 6 or 7 of the series. this does not even begin to make any kind of sense. this sword of course has a super cheap move that even by the standards of the inuyasha universe is cheap. his sword cuts things but then destroys whatever else gets effected by the cut part....so if your arm is cut by it the rest of your body is affected and gets killed in a chain effect unless you cut off your arm before that happens. his other sword tenseiga starts to become cool then stops as it loses its power to inuyashas sword which is how he finds his new sword to begin with....well the sword can still heal though

also his mother appears for one episode which is beyond random.

then we have narakus death....nothing on any planet about this makes any sense. he finally completes the jewel and defiles but it does not swallow it or absorb it. this is explained later but it still reeks of terrible writing. then we have the fact he transforms into some giant spider so the all knowing naraku forgets about the chain effect body killing sword??? and have no counter to it? in the last few episodes as he is fighting his arch rivals he puts up such a crappy level of defense it is mind boggling. this is the guy that seemed to have an answer to about 98% of what everyone tossed at him and that other 2 % he could usually at least put up a good fight but for some reason here at the end with a completely defiled jewel shard under his control he puts up the crappiest fight he has in the entire nearly 200 episode series. it really makes 0 sense. but then again it does not make sense that every character receives one epic power up in this 26 episode time frame....and speaking of apparently miroku can suck in poison no problem now....yes he drinks a potion to negate his ability to feel pain but even if you don't feel pain poison still ya know KILLS!!! yet he no longer suffers from this fatal poison which is stated to being much stronger on a number of occasions. there is also no real explanation for kagome suddenly learning to do more than shooting an arrow or inuyashas sword suddenly goes on a power absorbing rampage or sangos weapon somehow gets stronger...yes explanations are given but they are terrible at best.

even kohaku dies and comes back to life all within in the same episode if i recall.

so he finally dies because he has no answer to that new sword of sesshomaru. he gets one last laugh in and drags kagome into the jewel. inuyasha using one of his new several abilities he has gained in such a rapid time to follow her. the jewel begs kagome to make a wish she refuses inuyasha saves her she then makes a wish telling the jewel to disappear forever the problem is the jewel had apparently been controlling our dear old friend naruku because it was desperate to remain in the world so why in the hell would a jewel that apparently has its own mind grant the wish of the thing it did not want the most? when it had up to that point become clear to everyone that the jewel did not grant wishes!!! i believe this is even flat out stated by kagome and naruku at some point.

then the wrap up ending piles even more cheese on this. after she is saved inuyasha warps back to his world against his will and they are seperated for three years long enough for kagome to graduate high school(another thing that bugs me about this show that i admit to having a guilty pleasure of enjoying...is her OCD like passion to finish school when none of that is practical to slaying demons but maybe calculus comes in handy when killing demons???) right after graduating she is suddenly able to through i guess force of will? i don't know she hops through time and see inuyasha and live happily ever after

dont get me wrong i love the series for some odd reason. but the finale has holes. the show has holes. the plot is terrible at points and aggrivating at others. naraku for some all mighty manipulative bastard has one of the worst deaths ever. the show also never once addresses why there are no demons 500 years in the future? why are there only 4 dog demons?(mom,dad,inuyasha and his brother?)

the sounds animation and voice acting and music is all solid don't get me wrong this is a rant against the story and it being the conclusion.

EDIT UPDATE:

so concerning the blu ray itself.

the blu ray quality is not the best anime quality ever but it is not bad. the quality of the anime however does seem to go up by episode 10 or so.

the sound is good enough and pretty close to its japanese counter part from what i can recall.

i didn't watch it in japanese but the english voices are pretty good. the only thing which is to be expected is there are different voice actors for everyone. so you will have to get past that. the sad part here is they did not even try to get these voice actors to try and sound like the original ones. they all sound 100% different. i do not fault the change in actors but it would of been nice if they tried to  at least sound like the originals.

there is not really any special features to speak of they are about the same as the first 7 season box sets in that regard.

this is the first 13 episodes and really this is about as good as the final act gets. its all downhill from here. however some of the best scenes in the entire series are found in these 13 episodes so that is a plus but ironic as the worst part of the entire series is contained in what will be part 2.

overall the quality of the blu ray is pretty good i only wish the quality of animation and clarity that is found in the last few episodes was present in the entire thing. but oh well.",1351468800,3,7020,4.276563677467973

4885283,5,B005SH647S,I have Inuyasha seasons 1-7 and all 4 movies but I kept getting conflicting information that season 7 was The Final Act and other saying it was not and that it was basically season 8 so idk can someone clear this up for me.,1349740800,,223,4.090909090909091
4885284,4,B005SH647S,"I've been watching this on and off on HuluPlus. So I'll wait till it comes out as a completed box set. Feels like I've been waiting too long for this. There is definitely a disconnect somewhere.

Anyway, I purchased from Ebay, the complete 7 seasons set not knowing I could have paid $9 less through Amazon. I think the one I bought is from a prior production run. The one here looks like a new production run. I used to see the individual seasons go for $120 each 5 yr.'s ago with or without trinket. Who know's, maybe 30 yr.'s from now, one of those unopened trinket season box's could go for $100k like the unboxed bobbafett from 1976? that sold for $19k.

I think the music from the Inuyasha series is the best I have listened to even if my copy was a knock-off. An absolute top-notch production as well the anime. The licensed copies from other countries go for alot less on Ebay apparently. Knock-offs have about 97% of the fidelity clarity of the licensed DRM copies I think but play anywhere.",1349308800,,1000,4.429347826086956
4885285,2,B005SH647S,"Im waiting till both halves come out I can't stand things being incomplete and partial if I can help it. Sides, I'm not even sure yet if it's got the dub or not, saying so doesn't make it so as it's yet come out. Sides, I got a Japanese only version of the movie, so I theorize that the dub isn't out just yet.

It's probably just me being picky, but the art irks me. I thought they were gonna use the picture they had on Hulu with Naraku and a tainted jewel and InuYasha and the black Tetsuseiga, with webs in the background I think, that would've made a beautiful picture for the complete set.

What also prevents me from getting this set is looking at the movie set reviews, somebody said it was the only way to get the fourth movie, I dunno if that's true, I pre ordered mine from a store, but this gives me cause to at least wait till the other half comes out as I said,  then decide.

And I hear the new replacements aren't bad, sesshoumaru's new voice actor does a perfect imitation of his predecessor, if I don't like Kagome, I can always watch it in Japanese.

I watched this during the weeks it was released, and loved it all, I do believe it is my favorite of all the seasons

Is it just me or is the animation style slightly duffrrent? Closer to the manga depiction I think. Very pretty.",1348704000,,1299,4.176
4885286,4,B005SH647S,I waited so long to finally own the remaining episodes of this great anime classic but was sad to here that they didn't just make a complete series instead they divided it up into two parts and something tells me that later on they might just make a complete series set. I hope they aren't double dipping.,1348099200,5,305,4.368421052631579
4885287,4,B005SH647S,i remember this series back when it was on and i do like it but don't know if they change it to english dub closer to time or at least before it comes out,1346371200,,154,3.5588235294117645
4885288,5,B005SH647S,been waiting forever for this to finally come out sub or dubbed i don't care. *happy dance* just glade that box set 7 is not the real ending like they where trying to make it. ^_^ just hope they where able to get most of all the main cast back. other wise i will only be able to watch it in Eng up to a point and then it will be Japanese from that point after. i just got it and i can wait to watch it but i have to it is a Christmas gift even though i know what it is... i didn't hear any clanking a round so is should be good.,1345939200,2,528,3.6
4885289,5,B005SH647S,"Omg! I'm just glad its finally got a release date! I've been waiting sooooo long to see it. I didn't go to the web sites to watch it so I don't care how it comes, sub or dub, I just want it! I don't care about the case or that its being released in 2 parts their getting my money! It seems to me that all the companies in the last few years have been releasing their series in more than one part, but after all the parts are out they turn around and release a complete collection! So if you are one of those people who want your inuyasha the final act in one complete collection they'll probably release that, just wait for a bit! I have to have it now though I've waited long enough so I'll be buying the 2 parts!",1345852800,16,714,3.9652777777777777
4885290,2,B005SH647S,"I have been waiting for InuYasha The Final Act to have a English Dub, ever since the voice actor of Sango stated that they were working on the dub back in 2010. I'm happy that it is finally going to be released, but I don't like how VIZ Media is handling this product. The series contains 26 episodes, but they are releasing it in two parts, 13 episodes each. I do not like the fact that they are using the standard DVD case for this series since the previous series has been treated with beautiful box sets. What I don't understand is that WHY is it being released NOW when they started dubbing in 2010? A company like FUNimation would easily have dubbed their series and release them to DVD months later and keeping their fans updated about their products. This should have at least been released on DVD and Blu-Ray last year, and instead of using standard cases and cutting the series in half, it should be released in a nice box set containing all 26 episodes, especially since it took them this long to finally release them, and it is ONLY 26 episodes.",1345593600,12,1057,4.425641025641026
4885291,1,B005SH647S,"I'm going to ""review"" something I don't own before it's even out. I normally hate when people do this but in this case I think it's justified. If you don't think so, feel free to yell at me in the comments, I don't care.

My ""review"" is a slightly altered rant that I posted on Viz's Facebook page.

May I just start off by saying that I'm completely disappointed with how cheap Viz has become. They used to make beautiful quality box sets, but now all I see from them are overpriced standard DVD cases with lackluster artwork. Me and the many fans of Inuyasha have been waiting for the release of Final Act for a long time and I thought because of how well Viz treated Inuyasha in the past, it would get a proper release. But instead we have a standard case with boring artwork. To top that off we have to buy two sets because they are only including 13 episodes on each. Final Act only has 26 episodes and the majority of the Inuyasha DVD's Viz released previously contained 27 episodes. So other than being completely money hungry, what reason is there to split the show in half? I can't say I'm completely surprised considering how crap the releases of Naruto and Bleach became. But despite what I've said, they'll get my money anyway because there's no other way to purchase the dub on DVD.

Congrats Viz",1345507200,15,1309,4.423236514522822
