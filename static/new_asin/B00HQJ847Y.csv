6197636,5,B00HQJ847Y,"I received this DVD directly from YMAA Publications for the purpose of reviewing said material.

I personally have been waiting for someone with real world experience managing human violence, who also owns the same practical contextual approach to jujutsu training and grappling martial arts. Enter Rory Miller and his new video offering addressing the truth of joint locks.

In this 60 minute presentation, Miller provides an in-depth explication on the simplicity and functionality of joint locks, as well as their fundamental weakness and failings.

Six principles (maximizing leverage, two-way action, using gravity, basing, stacking, and giftsbuy the DVD for details) are covered that must be engaged and adhered to in a simultaneous fashion in order for any joint lock to actually work under duress against uncooperative, resistant suspects. He then proceeds to demonstrate how to apply these six principles to the various joints of the body, detailing the specific anatomy of the various types of joints, and how to best apply these principles, making for a lock that actually does what it needs to do.

Miller conducts a class with various individuals present, each owning a specific level of skill, and then shows these practitioners the very easy approach to learning and applying joint locks. This provides the viewer with a more realistic example of how we learn these manipulations and how we may apply them on different people, from different angles of approach, while under duress. Miller then demonstrates how easily it is to slip out of, and walk away from, standing joint locks and restraints when all of the six principles are not applied simultaneously.

This reviewer began his journey in martial arts, beginning in 1958 with wrestling and Traditional Kodokan Judo. The very first thing one learns in these two disciplines is that to mechanically shut down a human entity not wanting to be mechanically shut down, head and hip control must be forthcoming, simultaneously. I am excited that this truth is finally revealed and demonstrated clearly by a man of skill and experience.

This is a good demo/lecture DVD. At one hour I will almost certainly watch it a number of times.

Several years ago my neighbor and I decided to study Chin Na together. We worked from the several Chin Na DVD series in my possession and made some progress. We found however, that against full resistance, many of the techniques vanished. This DVD goes a good way to explaining that. It simplifies the art down to VERY BASIC principles that apply in all cases. What type of joint (there are three) have you been given? How do you capitalize on that? Where is the hole or escape? How can you remove that?

After each principle the diverse students (male and female of varying sizes) are given an opportunity to experiment and Rory Miller gives suggestions and criticism. His manner is friendly, humor filled and completely present. He attends to camera angles as well as technique. While he often references the Chinese and Japanese names he does not discuss the specific techniques in detail. Instead the focus is on improvisation and proper mindset for practice.

My Chin Na DVD's have gathered dust. Some have never been watched to the end. The dozens (many dozens) of techniques and escapes remain unlearned. With this DVD I am inspired to go out and find a sparring buddy to resume my exploration.

As the sparse jacket information states, Joint locks are not primary self-defense techniques. This information (alone) will not get you out of a jam. I think it is also important to mention that this DVD is a single meal. While there is plenty here for a second or third viewing it is not study material. In fact I think Miller goes so far as to say that this material cannot be effectively studied.  Miller advocates a more playful, improvisational approach.

As usual with YMAA videos, the trailers for other material is extensive and for the most part worth watching. I thoroughly enjoyed this. I expect the price tag may be a bit steep for an hour lecture. A chart with the table of contents and a few illustrations would have been useful.

I give four stars because of the disconnect between the price and the amount of material. While the mastery that allowed for such a clear and simplified presentation is apparent there were a number of places where clarification or illustration would have been welcome. I also note that there is minimal discussion of practice safety. It is pretty easy to injure one's playmate with this stuff.",1392854400,4,2524,4.770642201834862

Essentially its a masterclass on the principles of all joint locks, the steps necessary to lock each particular joint, the reasons why locks aren't usually what you need in self defense and how to apply them when you do. He doesn't focus on any particular style but stresses using 'playful' drills to develop the ability to improvise locks under pressure.",1392422400,10,460,4.8354430379746836
6197639,5,B00HQJ847Y,"Short review on Rory's New YMAA Joint Locks DVD:

[...]

Rory's goal was to make Joint Locks accessible - make them easy to understand, and to remove the complications and mystery. It works. He has boiled down JL's to a lesson in less than one hour timeframe, removed a lot of the BS, explained some of the tricks, but most importantly  - once again - made us all think! Since I use JL's as a primary stepping off point, and use them more than most, they've always been on my list of things to 'master' - it can't be done, and it shouldn't be done. It's messy, but it can still work if you listen, and learn. The Principles is a personal tome that I've asked Rory to publish in the past and to share - without 'em we're all flailing. Rory  has provide some basics, some great demos, and some great thinking and talking points in this new release - long overdue, and sure to compliment any MA/LEO library of existing titles. It's just got some great basic foundational ideas. Mine came yesterday, and I spent three hours today capturing his ideas on paper to think about, and review while I can't be watching - fine tuning my abilities with some restructuring, some fixes to my mess, and some new information that I hadn't seen anywhere else. My biggest problem with Rory's stuff is this: he gives you tools, and they make you want more. I know that Rory doesn't intend this specifically, but I'm always waiting for his NEXT release, and the one after that, and so on. He always brings something new to my table and library, and he always makes me think differently. It's always a joy to get a new Miller product in the mailbox, and this one was no exception. In fact, it's very relevant to my needs and journey to go home safe. Thank you Rory for your talent, and ability to deliver your experience to those of us out here that need your knowledge.",1391472000,12,1848,4.394736842105263
6197640,4,B00HQJ847Y,"Miller is an excellent author with years of real world experience with violence. This video is not a step-by-step guide to different joint locks. It is instead a guide to improvising joint locks on the fly in fluid situations. Miller states that if you are looking to apply the static locks presented in most defensive tactics classes in a fight you will probably not find them. Through the video Miller attempts to teach you how to ""see"" the momentary opportunities in a fight that you can use to create a joint lock. What Miller also states is that you cannot learn by simply watching the video, you have to ""play"" which is what most of the video demonstrates. It is a good video, if you are willing to apply the concepts and incorporate them into your training. If you are looking for a bunch of specific techniques this isn't it. I think that it's human nature to want the ""if A happens, do B"" style of instruction but what Miller is trying to teach is more abstract and far more useful in a real fight.",1440979200,2,1007,4.448648648648649

This video is pretty much a master class on both principles and training methodologies surrounding joint manipulation techniques.  It's obvious the people working with Mr Miller in this video are from a wide range of disciplines, and seeing how the methodologies get assimilated by people of different backgrounds is incredibly useful as well.

Get this DVD.
Do you suppose that you might one day be confronted by a grappler?
Get this DVD.

The specifics of this work have already been covered by the other reviewers, and are quite well outlined in the product description.
But what makes this DVD worth the money is not simply its particular systematic approach to using hold and locks, and understanding
them better in the event of them being used against you, The content is, like all of the other books and DVDs from these authors, also
guide toward further study, which raises it above and beyond what could be contained in a few pages of a book, or a few minutes of demo footage.
  This DVD contains principles. Principles are just that - the basic blocks leading to a deeper understanding and application of a subject.
Is this all original information and unique revelations? Of course not - Grappling has been around ever since we fell from the trees, and
every practical martial system worthy of the title covers it to some degree. But if you want a good complimentary excellent oversight of the subject and how
to train it, this should have something for everyone, novice or experienced.
Judo, aikido, china, hapkido, jujitsu, MMA, it should not matter much  I predict that this DVD will make a good bit of supposedly esoteric knowledge more understandable to a lot of people, and would make a worthwhile addition to anyone's martial library.",1425081600,2,1450,4.788

He breaks down how joint locks work and what is needed to make them effective in dynamic situations. All of this taught in a very short amount of time by simply taking a step back and looking at how the different joints function, then applying that understanding to formulating simple procedures for making them work.",1405987200,2,451,4.934210526315789
6197657,5,B00HQJ847Y,"I've been training in the martial arts for nearly 50 years and practicing the grappling arts for about half that long. I have used joint locks on the street as a police officer and have found them to work most of the timemeaning, not all of the time. With Rory Miller's insightful approach on teaching and practicing joint locks, I see now where I messed up.

Miller doesn't teach a series of locks, although by watching him demonstrate and teach his principles, and then watching his students practice ""finding"" them, you will inadvertently learn, depending on your experience, one of two new ones or even several.

But learning locks isn't what this DVD is about. What makes Miller's approach unique is that he explains the three types of joints and how you can make them hurt, even using less than polished techniques. It's all about recognizing the type of jointand Miller shows you how easy that is to doand then applying pain to it using your hands, arms, chest, knees, and even your rear end. In short, it's about learning to improvise. Real fights are fast, furious, and fluid situations. If you cant improvise, you will come in second place. Period.

The DVD box says you can learn Miller's approach in an hour. True? Absolutely.

At a run time of 60 minutes, the information provided is very practical and straight forward. Rory breaks down the concepts of the different joints in the human body, how to manipulate them, and gives the viewer ideas on how to create their own techniques as the situation presents itself. The concepts are very easy to understand and apply, but must be practiced with another person to truly benefit from this creative exercise. Once again, Rory, you never cease to amaze!

Instead, be prepared to learn the principles to both apply and escape from various joint locks.
The unique aspect of this DVD is that it's part instruction, part class. Miller teaches the moves, then has a handful of participants come out and play with the moves. It's not a heavily scripted DVD. I'd guess Miller outlined various aspects he wanted to go over, but it's not structured in any particular way.",1397779200,4,500,4.617977528089888

Room for improvement:  The DVD could have delivered better on how to apply locks under intense pressure. Also there could have been a better explanation on how to get out of common locks with more ""slow-motion"" demonstration.

In closing I would say to get it because if you even only take one thing away it will elevate your ""self-defense repertoire"" another notch. That has been my experience with his books/DVDs. Remember that Miller has police officer/military experience and has been through the most harrowing situations.",1394841600,7,805,4.897058823529412

6197666,5,B00HQJ847Y,"Once again, Rory Miller presents an informative, interesting and instruction DVD regarding protection of one's self in violent situations. In this DVD, Miller demonstrates takedowns and joint locks which can help anyone who learns the basics of the art.

Miller demonstrates that the protective moves should be used by maximizing leverage holds and other techniques which can be learned by anyone. He teaches the moves by stressing taking advantage of gravity and basing, stacking and gifts given by the bad guy; these terms are defined and demonstrated in the DVD lessons.

Admonitions are given that most of these defensive/offensive moves are not to be learned by rote but rather learned in basic moves and in general practice. Improvisation and learning of the advantage points are more important than learning the same moves over and over.

I wanted to watch this DVD because I learned a lot from Miller's earlier DVD, Facing Violence which stresses avoidance rather than confrontation. His years of law enforcement experience and teaching make this a must have DVD for all law enforcement officers and anyone who may be confronted in a physical situation. I highly recommend owning Joint Locks.",1394409600,2,1200,5.2072538860103625
6197667,5,B00HQJ847Y,"Over the many years I have practiced tai chi and Kung fu, I have heard the good teachers all say you have to work with what you've got. You don't know what will be presented to you in a confrontation. My sparring partner in the school may be my gender, age, height and weight, but the mugger may be older, faster, more ruthless. You must stick to principles and improvise under pressure .

Knowing simple principles and taking a different mindset, may be just enough to save your life. There  are several points in the DVD which may seem counter intuitive, but if you keep an open mind and a keen eye, it's easy to see an escape route. In one place Mr. Miller shows a scenario practiced in many self defense schools. A person grabs you around the neck to choke. The natural reaction is to struggle, the training reaction is to use grabs, grip, turns, muscles to escape, the new way of seeing the situation is to realize that the fingers are not touching in the back of your neck, so just walk backwards through the open door of the hands.

In another example, a small woman is is a wrist lock at the hands of a large man. Mr. Miller asks her if she trusts him. He tells her to push forward, toward the person locking her wrist. Looks like it may break her wrist, but in reality the forward movement drops her lower and releases the lock.

There are many masterful ways of seeing the empty spaces and gaps that will allow a double lock or a quick release. you must develop an open mind, have a good, clear eye and some old fashioned guts, along with being willing to practice. I am not familiar with many joint locks, as they have not been a part of my martial training up to this point. I did attend a Shuai Jiao class this afternoon and something that I  viewed in this DVD yesterday stuck in my head. I was able to lock in a grab with one hand, spiral my shoulder into his arm and use gravity to bring him forward, off balance, I was able to turn and drop my hand to his knee without looking down. ( Mr. Miller says if you know where his pinkie is, you know where his elbow is. Following that line of thought I felt where his shoulder was on my back, so I knew where his knee was), one step back and he was on the ground. I'm a 65 year old grandmother with some tai chi, bagua and Xinyi experience, my partner was a male, 25 year old wrestler, with 60 pounds on me.

6197668,5,B00HQJ847Y,"I have all the DVD's and Books created by Sgt. Rory Miller. The information is complete and concise.  This particular DVD explains the mechanics of how to create a joint lock, why they work, etc.  It's not a drawn out technique laden monotonous drone... I have a Blackbelt in Jiujitsu, and frankly, this is a good shortcut to the time spent, (6 years), figuring this all out on my own.  In the system that I studied under, this sort of explanation was reserved for the senior Blackbelts only.  I believe in a traditional teaching system, but this DVD would have made that training 1000% better if I would have had it 35 years ago at the beginning... I recommend this to anyone in Law Enforcement, the military, or in Personal Security who may be required by their job to wrestle with someone instead of just shooting/stabbing them.  This isn't for armchair commandos to watch once and think that they ""got it""... (please!, get off the couch and practice!),  Safely!  It's worth it.  I would recommend purchasing this for your Dojo, watching it en masse with the class, and practicing it together, with people who are willing to think and improvise. This isn't going to be something useful to stop someone with murderous or carnal intent, as Sgt. Miller says, this is for the ""Drunkle""... that Drunk Uncle who wants a cheap feel... all the way up to the exteme stuff, such as controling the other person until you can get to your weapon.  This is in that gray area between running and shooting, where the ""Left Hand Knife"", and secondary weapons may fall. Straight up?

6197669,5,B00HQJ847Y,"I would recommend this DVD to both novice and to the advanced practitioner because Rory Miller is a master of his craft and this joint lock DVD is no exception.  This DVD is different than his other 2 DVDs Facing Violence & Logic of Violence (I would recommend both) in that it doesnt go into the nature of violence but how to improvise joint locks. To be honest I didn't think this would be a topic Rory Miller would cover much less produce a DVD about the subject of joint locks. Im glad he did. Rory Miller mentions too often one practices joint locks making them more complicated than what they should be.
In the DVD on two different occasions Rory Miller describes key principles that will help improvise joint locks. He explains one doesnt have to memorize technique but understanding principle and know what to look for while applying joint locks under pressure. He then goes on to explain there are three types of joints in the human body; hinge, ball and socket and gliding joints and try not over complicate things. There are few drills as Rory describes making partners dance one can test with another partner including a lock flow drill. Rory shows several tricks and how to flow from one lock to the next joint lock while not getting hung up on getting a specific lock. At one point during a flow Rory Miller showed how a drunk would break out of a lock with ease which by the way was entertaining. At the end of the DVD Rory showed how to breakout lock flowing a joint lock of his own. All in all a very well put together DVD.
Rory Millers approach is simple and to the point, one learns while having fun.  One of the many things I like about this DVD.",1393113600,4,1666,4.4058441558441555
