4190770,5,B003TLJX46,Our boys loved this film. Highly recommend it for families. Remember to watch the first movie in the series to understand it all.,1369440000,,129,4.6521739130434785
4190771,4,B003TLJX46,"We loved Arthur and the invisibles.  It was a great movie that my kids thoroughly enjoyed so we were excited to see a 2nd and 3rd film about the adventures of Arthur and the Minimoys.  This 2nd movie, Arthur and the Invisibles 2, is cute but not quite as interesting as the 1st and 3rd movies.  It could easily be skipped and not miss much.  My kids still enjoyed it but weren't as captivated by it as the 1st and 3rd.  Overall a cute film but we liked the 1st and 3rd movies best.",1369267200,2,481,4.074468085106383
4190772,4,B003TLJX46,"Even though it is kind of cheesy and the storyline is a little silly, my kids really liked it.  Also, I am glad that my children have not figured out the age gap between Arthur and the princess.  She is a thousand years old (old enough to be queen of her people) and he is a little boy. They do have a kissing scene in this one too.",1367107200,,332,3.8676470588235294
4190773,1,B003TLJX46,"We ended up turning it off. We are very careful about what we let our kids watch and this movie was out of our comfort zone. Arthur spends more time with the tribal people it becomes like a religion to him. Arthur say ""Oh my God"" several times, and the method they use to transport Arthur to the Minimoys was not only disgusting, but also very scary for my 6 year old. We were very disappointed. Definitely not what we expected.",1362787200,2,428,4.296296296296297
4190774,5,B003TLJX46,"my son and me had a lot of fun watching this movie, it inspires the fantasy of young kids and teaches them respect for the animal kingdom and also the little creatures on earth....",1351382400,5,180,4.323529411764706
4190775,5,B003TLJX46,Great quality. The story line is good. Forces you to watch part 3. The voices seem the same. The characters stories are pretty good.,1339372800,6,132,4.541666666666667
4190776,3,B003TLJX46,"why isn't this movie & its sequel on reg DVD format?

i haven't watched any of them yet, so can't really give it any star rating.",1305763200,2,129,3.9615384615384617
4190777,2,B003TLJX46,I bought this sequel because I liked the first movie. This picture contained all the elements that I liked about the first except and ending. What I thought was another movie is only half a movie. You need to purchase Arthur 3 to get the end of this story. There is a set with both movies 2 and 3. I recommend that instead.,1299974400,3,323,4.142857142857143
4190778,3,B003TLJX46,"I think the first movie has me spoiled because, while the movie quality is fine, a number of the original voice actors have changed and the continued  story is not as engaging as the first part.",1493337600,,194,4.388888888888889

4190780,5,B003TLJX46,A great classic!! Love this movie!,1488153600,,34,4.833333333333333
4190781,5,B003TLJX46,"Better for older kids 10 plus, the special effects are so beautiful they look real and some of the ""magic"" might be too much for younger children.",1485043200,,146,4.444444444444445
4190782,3,B003TLJX46,"It was good, but the whole movie is pretty much just a lead-in to the third installment in the series.",1477958400,,102,4.15
4190783,1,B003TLJX46,Started out good but was just a movie of adults not the littles. Won't watch the third,1477267200,,86,4.117647058823529

4190786,5,B003TLJX46,My 10 year old grandsons sick day home from school. We snuggled in bed cuddling & watching all 3 episodes of Arthur! We both enjoyed the movies & I enjoyed the cuddles!,1465516800,,168,4.28125
4190787,5,B003TLJX46,"This and part two were just straight up like Marvel's, ""The Avengers"" but for kids. In addition, this whole trilogy had multible good morals, a well rounded story, and plenty of amazing, yet believable escalation. Most importantly though, IT'S THE SAME LIVE CAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
In these types of movies that typically go straight to dvd or whatever, they usually replace the whole cast, maybe keeping ONE actor the same, just to kind of hope to hold the audience for it's run time. In this movie however, every single member of the original cast returns for part two and three minus only Madonna, who is replaced by Sellina Gomez. David Bowie might also have been replaced, but if so, I couldn't tell. In this series, what can I say, it JUST ROCKS!!!!

Put parts one through three on for your kids on some rainy Saturday afternoon, and rock their imaginations out to whole new levels!!!!",1465430400,,886,4.790849673202614

4190789,3,B003TLJX46,"We loved the first movie and were so excited to see the second.  The problem--BIG PROBLEM--was nowhere does it say this ends on a CLIFFHANGER.  We got all the way to then end, big bad guy has just gotten free, and then ""To be continued"" comes on the screen.  NOOOOOOOOOOOO!  Our kids were so upset, and I have to say my husband and I were not happy.  Could it just say ""Part I of II"" somewhere?  The movie itself was pretty good, but I am afraid this tainted it for us.",1463270400,,469,4.0989010989010985

4190793,5,B003TLJX46,This was just as amazing as the first movie,1461715200,,43,3.888888888888889
4190794,1,B003TLJX46,"Terrible, kids liked the first one so we jumped in. Worthless, basically just setting up #3, no plot, no fun, waste of money.",1460678400,,125,4.478260869565218

4190799,5,B003TLJX46,We showed this on big screen to the neighbors and had a great time! We enjoyed the movie...4 adults 2 young teens and 1 older teen. We give it a thumbs up!!!,1450828800,,157,3.9375
4190800,1,B003TLJX46,So this is a sequel but also it's part 1 of 2. I will not be watching the second half. It was not worth spending all the time watching it with no plot finishing.,1446595200,,161,3.764705882352941
4190801,1,B003TLJX46,The first movie is better. This one was boring.,1444262400,,47,4.333333333333333

4190808,1,B003TLJX46,"Wow. Horrible. So horrible. And inappropriate for kids in several places. If I could give this a negative star, I would. At the end, it's ""to be continued."" It looks like the third movie has potential. If I were you, I'd skip 2 and go on to 3.",1432857600,,243,4.083333333333333

4190817,3,B003TLJX46,As with most multi  movies. First one was way better. Would give it 2 stars but the original movies is epic so I had to share the love.,1424476800,,135,3.8214285714285716

4190822,1,B003TLJX46,"We rented this after adoring the 1st movie.  If I could give it zero stars, I would.  I'd like my $2.99 back.
The characters were awkward (living and animated), and different in this film than the first.  The princess song ""I miss you""... yikes.  Most disappointing of all was that a little over an hour in, ""to be continued"" scrolls across the screen and the movie morphs into a strange promo for the next film.  We won't be watching Arthur 3.  Not even if Amazon offers it free for Prime members.  A disappointment.",1419292800,,517,4.494623655913978
4190823,1,B003TLJX46,"Really disappointing.  This second movie opted for crudity.  The song at the end was not fit for children....neither were the characters ""costumes"" in keeping with a cartoon movie (a loin cloth?, the princes was half dressed?  Really?  You have to do that to a children's movie?  I'm sorry I bought this and won't be buying the third one.  These film makers had a good thing going and they blew it.  I will be sure to let everyone I know who are buying movies for their children that this one is unfit.  Wicked disappointed!!! I really liked the first one and was delighted to see two more.  Unfortunately, I didn't think to peruse this one before showing it to one of the youngsters.  Lesson learned!!!",1418860800,,703,4.596774193548387
4190824,3,B003TLJX46,"Disappointing. We loved the first Arthur movie & this one just lacked the magic & excitement. Plus, the ending was a cliff hanger and a let down after paying for a movie.",1416355200,,170,4.34375

4190831,2,B003TLJX46,"What a rip off!! This is a part 2 of 3 movie. I didn't see part 1 but I won't be seeing part 3 either because I won't waste my money.  Very disappointed. Storyline drags in many places. I can see why now that I found out at the end it's part 2 of 3.  Fast forwarded through a song that was being poorly sung. This is a silly Saturday morning cartoon, real action movie that should be free. The small amount of good imagination couldn't carry the film past 2 stars. Good potential but awful in the end, or should I say middle.",1406246400,,525,4.038461538461538
4190832,3,B003TLJX46,"Not as good as the 1st one. It leaves off in the middle of the plot, open-ended so you need to buy #3 to see how the movie ends",1402790400,,127,3.413793103448276
4190833,5,B003TLJX46,Great movie! My kids really enjoyed it.  They wanted to watch episode one and two after the other. Movie made the ride to SC from GA shorter and full of laughter for them.,1402531200,,171,4.181818181818182
4190834,5,B003TLJX46,All of my kids loved this series. There ages are 4-9.  My oldest wants me to buy the books. The animation is really fabulous.,1402099200,,125,4.208333333333333
4190835,2,B003TLJX46,We enjoyed the first of these movies so thought we'd try this one. It was weird and boring. All of my kids lost interest. Waste of time.,1400630400,,136,4.074074074074074
4190836,3,B003TLJX46,They really didn't capture the essence of the first movie at all. Sorry I bought it. Will rent #3. The plot is really lacking.,1398556800,,126,4.291666666666667
4190837,4,B003TLJX46,The boys LOVE the Arthur and the Invisibles movies.... after each one their asking for more. They are a cute series and are a great trilogy for the family.,1397692800,,155,4.379310344827586
4190838,4,B003TLJX46,"Our grandson (age 13) and I enjoyed this on Roku, but apparently the first Arthur didn't get enough viewers in the theaters so Arthur2 and Arthur3 were put out only on DVD.  Doesn't matter.  It was fun and we'll be renting Arthur3 next week!",1395705600,,241,4.454545454545454
4190839,5,B003TLJX46,"Okay, so I did read that most folks liked the first one better and I can see why, but in the end, my 8 year old loves this movie and can't wait to see Arthur 3 - it's magical, family oriented, good wins over evil and happiness - with all the drama in real life, this is a little piece of gold and FUN for my daughter.  ENJOY!!",1395705600,,326,3.7941176470588234

4190841,2,B003TLJX46,"we loved the first arthur and the invisibles and was hoping the 2nd would be just as good.
very disappointed. had to turn it off because it was inappropriate for my boys. so
sad that hollywood feels they have to make things hip and sexy even for kids. the writers
could have done a better job, but alas they buckle to what they ""think"" kids will watch.
sticking to wholesome more appropriate movies.",1391126400,,399,4.47945205479452
4190842,3,B003TLJX46,The animation was perfect almost made you forget the characters are  not real actors. Story could use a bit more....more?! Big M is very stiff with his lines. The actor doing the voice over seemed bored.,1389139200,,203,4.638888888888889
4190843,1,B003TLJX46,"Not nearly as good as the first. The princess is too sexual for a kids movie and it was disappointing that a movie ends at the climax with ""to be continued.""  The third one looks like a lot of mayhem.  The story line was not nearly as good as the first. The main character is wonderful, as he always is.  At one point a mini person, who is supposed to be a good guy, hits a woman for no reason. It was totally uncalled for and inappropriate.",1385596800,,441,4.045977011494253
4190844,5,B003TLJX46,I love the entire trilogy of the archer movies myself my husband and my children all eagerly await for more to come!,1383350400,,116,4.318181818181818
4190845,2,B003TLJX46,"Started out okay, but fizzled quickly. It was painful to watch and my children thought the same thing. Did not finish the movie.",1382400000,,128,4.608695652173913
4190846,5,B003TLJX46,It was the biggest thing that you can see how the adventures of this is a great product to play RENT,1382400000,,100,3.8095238095238093
4190847,1,B003TLJX46,"The first movie had its cheesiness, but I actually kind of loved it. This had very little to love. The princess changed from someone who could take care of herself to someone who needed to be taken care of constantly. The rest of the plot was weird. Not my favorite. Too bad, because I did love the first one.",1381708800,,309,4.254237288135593
4190848,5,B003TLJX46,Absolutely enjoy watching the Arthur movie and had to watch the next one also.  Definitely a good family movie to have with the entire family.,1379980800,,142,4.68
4190849,3,B003TLJX46,I watched this with my kids after seeing the first movie.  I thought it was kind of slow.  My boys still liked it.,1377907200,,114,3.9130434782608696
4190850,1,B003TLJX46,"My family and I loved the first one, but this movie was long and drawn out, over-done as is typical to sequels. What is most irritating is that there is no ending; It is a ""to be continued."" After spending 2 hours watching this movie it still does not end. I definitely wasted my money on it. My advice is to skip it and wait for the 3rd one. I doubt that i will waste another $4, though.",1377820800,,388,3.9871794871794872
4190851,5,B003TLJX46,Great middle movie of the Arthur and the Invisibles trilogy.  Liked best by my nine year old son and still enjoyed by his older brother.,1374883200,,136,4.44

4190853,5,B003TLJX46,Excellent for older children. Don't take everything literally. It's meant to be watches right before the third movie. The first one was my favorite. I wish there was a forth one.,1371945600,2,178,4.774193548387097
4190854,5,B003TLJX46,Ordered for my eight year old Grandson. He was so excited too watch it  We all loved it. Would recommend highly.,1371945600,2,112,4.333333333333333
4190855,4,B003TLJX46,Love the animation. Kids enjoy the Imaginary world and the ability to travel to a small land. Need to watch first in series to understand this one.,1371340800,,147,4.481481481481482
4190856,1,B003TLJX46,My 7 year old loved the first movie of this series.  Arthur 2 ending left my daughter disappointed and unsettled.  The previews showed much more violence and doom.  Would not recommend this film.,1371168000,,195,4.848484848484849
4190857,5,B003TLJX46,Wasn't sure if this movie would be okay for a six and nine year old but it was delightful.  It had a good story.  The overall theme was good and kept the attention of the 6 year old -- that in itself was worth it!,1369526400,,213,3.7111111111111112

8405254,4,B003TLJX46,Great little movie. Our family loved it,1508889600,,39,4.714285714285714
8405255,5,B003TLJX46,Loved the 1st one and was happy to see a new adventure with the same main actors. The live action combined with animation has the same  quality. The story is a new adventure with some new characters added.,1507852800,,205,4.394736842105263
