8391999,5,B00395ATRC,Well made BBC version of the H G Wells tale. Not as heavy on the FX as the Harryhausen version but a little closer to the book. For instance no love interest. It's region 2 so if you don't have a multi-region player you won't be able to watch it. Thoroughly enjoyed it Recommended!,1429401600,2,281,4.222222222222222
8392000,3,B00395ATRC,"This was watchable, but paled in comparison to the 1964 film.  It was undoubtedly made on a much smaller budget with only a few people, and in that regard it is impressive.",1425081600,,172,4.375
