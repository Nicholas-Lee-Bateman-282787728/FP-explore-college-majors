8390248,4,B00374G3NO,"All too brief filmed interview with one of the truly great directors. In this 53 minute program, Welles in his mid forties, talks openly about his life and especially interesting is his career after making Citizen Kane. Basically his career was never able to reach those heights again and he spent the majority of those years trying to make his own films with his own money by taking acting jobs to finance the films. His passion for filmmaking is evident. What is so sad is that his reputation for being profligate with other people's money which he says is untrue in the interview, is the damaging factor that made executives reluctant to hire him as a director and he was never able to make a picture in Hollywood again. A big talented courageous man who lived and worked in a big way and never stopped trying. Recommended.",1372032000,,826,4.625850340136054
8390249,5,B00374G3NO,"I watched this once in the USA. Why, o why, can't we have a Region 2 version of this DVD?  It is a rivetting interview with a legend of my lifetime (1930s to today).

8390250,5,B00374G3NO,"I have seen many reviews with Orson Welles.  The best I have seen, is the interview with Dick Cavett, most entertaining. The Paris interview is definitely the most candid and down to earth.  This interview comes across like a conversation with a dear friend.  Where there were many questions in my mind about Orson Welles and his beliefs, this interview goes right to filling in my gaps and deepens my appreciation of the man.  Have you ever met someone and had a conversation that you wished would never end. ?  This is what hearing Orson Welles speak does to me, it reminds me of those conversations.  I have watched this interview three times and I will watch it many more.  An Orson Welles fan or not, you will enjoy this interview.",1281916800,17,736,4.572519083969466
8390251,5,B00374G3NO,"Here in an all too short face to face interview with a not very astute interviewer, Orson dressed in black, casts his spell in a chair in his Paris hotel room, with just a cup of coffee and a cigar as magic props. A pity it couldn't have been a four course meal in a Paris restaurant or better in one of his favorite haunts in Spain. But be grateful that the interview survives. When the interviewer criticises the voices of Gielgud and Olivier, Orson the bass/baritone leaps to the defence of the two actor with tenor ranges. A must-keep for Welles fans.",1278201600,10,555,4.398058252427185
8390252,4,B00374G3NO,"Liked the interview very much. It was like having Orson Welles in front of you when he was in his forties, still not too heavy and his voice vibrant.  You could see he was being frank & honest.",1275955200,11,193,4.078947368421052
