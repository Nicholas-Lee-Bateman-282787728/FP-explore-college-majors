5177521,5,B008P76VP8,"My introduction to the St. Matthew Passion and to Dietrich Fischer-Diskau was via that monumental old recording conducted by Fritz Lehmann.  That treasure has been cleaned up and reissued on three CDs by Music and Arts.  My introduction to the ""period approach"" to the St. Matthew Passion was via Nicklaus Harnoncourt's first recording of the work.  I guess I'm old-fashioned; however, when I come away from a period-oriented performance, I don't feel the spiritual caatharsis I feel after listening to Lehmann, or to a recording by Gnter Ramin with the Hessen Radio Choir and Sinfonieorchester which I recently heard on YouTube.
I must confess I've not heard this recording on Blue Ray by the wonderful Thommanerchor Leipzig; thus, I cannot rightly comment further than to say that this choir would give you the best in period performing.  I can say I know this is a stylistic approach, since it takes only 2 hours and 44 minutes, a timing which would be far too rapid to provide the contemplation I feel to be intrinsic to the work.  Lehmann's reading takes about 3 hours and 15 minutes, and captures mightily both the drama and the reflective aspects of the work.  Hertel's singing of ""Mache dich, mein Herze, rein at Lehmann's suitably slower tempo is the finest and most emotionally restful I have ever heard, and I own something like 25 different recordings of the work.  As performances of our time go, I suspect this Blue Ray recording well deserves the five stars it has been accorded, but for me, Lehmann (in spite of being monaural) takes this monumental work far beyond great music to the highest possible plateau of worship; and after all, worship is what Bach wrote it for.",1396656000,,1687,4.836805555555555

5177523,5,B008P76VP8,The quality of the disc is superb with first-rate picture AND two equally effective sound tracks.  The performance is simply sublime.  This disc is not to be missed!  Excellent packaging and swift service!,1366416000,,205,5.151515151515151
5177524,5,B008P76VP8,"The St. Mathew Passion by J.S. Bach could easily rank as one of the most awesome works of music ever written--2 hours and 40 minutes of great music by not 1 but 2 orchestras and chorus creating quite a spectacle.
  The new BluRay DVD by the St. Thomas Choir of Leipzig, an 800 year old institution that Bach himself graduated from, is both daring and eloquent and yet very true to the style of the period.
  One bold departure from the traditional voicing of the work is the performance of Stefan Kahle, a male alto singing a part traditionally sung by a woman.  A highly disciplined performer, Kahle renders every solo with an eloquence and beauty I have never heard in any previous performances. This is especially true in the exquisite duo for violin and alto: Erbarme dich, mein gott.  Backed by a superb violinist, this aria is breathtaking.  I highly recommend this.",1358640000,19,872,4.660130718954249
5177525,5,B008P76VP8,"In all fairness, I need to correct the earlier review.  This is NOT the only recording on blu-ray.  I already own the Peter Sellers production from Berlin, conducted by Simon Rattle.  And no - you don't have to pay $333.  Just shop around with some other internet retailers like Presto Classical.  It's available in both DVD and Blu-Ray, just make sure to order the NTSC version (not PAL).  I don't want to take attention away from this Leipzig Recording , which is probably also great (in fact, I ordered a copy for myself) - but it's NOT the only option on blu-ray.  And the Sellers/Rattle production is a real gem in its own right - very innovative and moving.",1353628800,22,663,4.5210084033613445
5177526,5,B008P76VP8,"This is THE only blu-ray of St. Matthew Passion in the U.S. market. So I took a chance to purchase without waiting for its review on major music magazines such as BBC Music or Gramophone. The image is sharp of course. But it is also well played and sung without making a fuss of comparing it to the die hard reference audio recordings such as Richter, etc., I have those. But life moves on that I need new experience in sight and sound if the performances are still strong enough.

That said, I enjoy this blu-ray expecting repeated watching and listening.",1350259200,18,556,4.5049504950495045
8529401,3,B008P76VP8,"When one finds the St. Matthew Passion being performed at St. Thomas, Bachs church in Leipzig where it was composed and first presented in 1727 ... one must restrain ones expectations and realize from the get-go, that this is the St. Thomas experience of today, not 300 years ago.  It is not, and could never be a recreation of the earlier event.

Still it is an interesting mix.  So we have mostly modern instruments;  but we have a choir of men and boys, and no women other than in the orchestra, and the single soprano soloist.  (In Bachs time there would be no women in performance at all.)  Here as well, the soprano soloist only takes the arias, none of the little miscellaneous eine magd lines which are taken by various choirboys.  (O, I take that back, she does sing the small part of Pilates wife.  It would have been a boy in the 1720's, but that could be problematic today.)

And I would submit, although I will probably be shot down, the level of overall musical mastery and ensemble here is far BEYOND what Bach could have ever created in that small town of 300 years ago, now a huge city in a huge country with a flourishing Bach tradition going back many decades.

I also like that there seems to have been coordination in dress.  The men are not in tuxes, rather mid 1960s-era suits with white shirt and dark tie.  (Apparently the only one not getting the memo was the Evangelist, who showed up in an incongruous black shirt and red tie.)

Overall, the recording is visually outstanding!  I have no idea how they had enough cameras in such a small area to get so many good angles, and at the same time not showing each other in the wide shots.  And no, I don't think it was cobbled together creatively to hide those cameras.  As far as Im concerned it is a master class in how to visually record a major classical music event.  Its perfectI cant imagine it any better.

Soundwise also, beyond reproach.  Its as good as a studio recording.  Its as if every soloist had his or her own mike, carefully tweakedbut not a mike in sight.

OK, with all this going for it, why then the reduced rating?  Well, frankly, its hard to sit thru and thoroughly enjoy for two reasons.  First, too much of it is at a fast tempo, faster than either the music itself, or (especially) THE TEXT supports.  They have drunk the Koolaid which demands the music be performed as quickly as the fingers can possibly hit the keys, or the consonants spit forth from the lips.  OK sure, it is not the fastest St. Matthew Passion I have ever heard, but so what?  It's still too fast.

Consider the words:  Come ye daughters, help me cry ... Thou sinless Lamb of God, who art stricken upon the cross etc.  Forget that you've ever heard Gardiner, and tell me if in selecting a tempo, sensibly, you need to consult what the proper dance tempo of that particular form should be?  Really?

Several other arias, very early on, are way off-base tempo-wise.  For example, Blute nur du liebes Herz (Bleed now, thou beloved heart)--ridiculously fast.  You cant tell me Bach, who regularly meditated on the joy of death, would want these introspective arias done that fast.  Then we get to an aria which SHOULD be done fast, for example, Ich will dir mein Herze schenken ... and sure enough, it is fast.  Too fast.  But not that much contrast with the introspective arias.

The other reason for the lowered rating is one of the main singers and I just don't care for him.  That is the Evangelist.  I don't like to say anything bad about a professional, but yes he is actually the main character. the titular character, St. Matthew, in a piece entitled the St. Matthew Passion.  Never minding that, he also has the most performance time.  And I suppose if I went to a piece entitled Hamlet, and I didn't like the lead's Hamlet, I have the right to respectfully say so without going into detail (especially if I let go 30 bucks to get in).  So I will leave it at that.

All the other soloists are excellent!  My Lord, what presence the Jesus here has!  Pun intended!  And I absolutely love the soprano soloist, although she has to work with unusually fast tempos, she dispatches them beautifully.  The male alto also to die for.  The tenor aria soloist also, outstanding.  Notice his breath support.  (I wish he would have been Evangelist.)  And the bass aria soloist, Gotthold Schwarz, who has since become the newest Cantor of St. Thomas, direct successor to Johann Sebastian Bach.  (I guess I will never have that particular position ... darnit.)

The choir and orchestra also, beyond reproach.  The minor soloists also, members of the choir, who I assume are current students at St. Thomas, also very good.

So I hate to disrecommend this release when it obviously has so much going for it.  Therefore, I do not disrecommend it.  Only for my ultimate St. Matthew experience I will return to any of Karl Richter's three offerings, that of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1958/dp/B000058BGV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1958</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1979/dp/B000026CS9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1979</a>, or his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/video/dp/B000CDIOYO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">video</a>.",1509408000,2,5309,4.90888638920135
8529402,5,B008P76VP8,The DVD of Bach's St. Matthew Passion is magnificent!  The St. Thomas Boys Choir performs this masterpiece with excellence and is beautifully supported by the orchestra.

8529404,4,B008P76VP8,"Good sound quality on a masterful piece of music. Performed well. Tremendous location. Wish they would have hired the right director and camera crew to make the visual presentation more interesting to watch. But then again, maybe there aren't enough classical music buffs to purchase something like this to make cranes, hand-held gimbals and better lighting cost effective... who knows, but look into it next time, please. (Check out Andre Bocelli's Blu-ray in Tuscany as a visual standard.) Buy this Blu-ray because it's great music to have in your library and the efforts to get this recorded deserve support.",1453593600,,611,5.181818181818182

8529406,5,B008P76VP8,"This disc combines technical excellence of recording with quality of performance and interpretation. The DTS HD sound is expemplary - balance of choir and orchestra is spot on and soloists well placed in the soundstage.

The soloists are all excellent - including the alto Kahle who is a revelation.

I was left with the impression that Biller, choir and orchestra are serving the music and in so doing the performance becomes larger and deeper than merely a well rehearsed set of musicians running through a work. Their approach adds another dimension to the music, perhaps one that an agnostic like myself might call spiritual, larger than the sum of it's parts.

I think Bach would have been overjoyed to witness this performance. Well worth the ticket price and heartily recommended.",1436054400,3,787,5.038461538461538

8529410,5,B008P76VP8,"Hearing this performance on YouTube encouraged me to search for the DVD. I have both the St. Matthew, and the B Minor Mass by the Thomanerchor, as well as the documentary DVD on the choir. After watching the documentary, I listened to this performance and better understood how Maestro Biller and his colleagues work with the boys/ young men to achieve the precise and exciting reading of Bach's music. The Thomanerchor's sound is, of course, different in character from the English and American choirs, but that does not detract at all from the wonderful sound. I realize that in most cases, I'm biased toward the boy choir sound, but that's my principal preference. There is a lightness and a dancing quality to these performances that is not easily duplicated by adult singers.....and I readily acknowledge that other choirs may perform this music just as well. However the large-group massed adult sound doesn't always do justice to either Handel, Haydn or Bach. I look forward to future recordings from Liepzig. Thanks so much.",1410048000,10,1032,5.005813953488372
