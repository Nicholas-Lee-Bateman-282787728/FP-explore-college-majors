7420243,5,B014N8A3XI,"I remember these movies from my childhood.  My mother had recorded them off the T.V and we would watch them every Halloween especially when they were no longer being shown on T.V.  When I had children, they watched them as well.  Unfortunately the VHS tape became worn and would no longer play.  I looked everywhere and for such a long time for these movies and was pleased to finally find them!!!  When they arrived in the my oldest child couldn't believe that I had actually found them.",1447804800,5,488,4.563218390804598

7420246,5,B014N8A3XI,"I loved these movies as a kid and it's even better as an adult! Especially the sequel. It's so delightfully cheesy and funny. Now my kids love it too. New Halloween tradition in our house! Highly recommend.
(And the shipping was very timely and the DVD and cover were in mint condition. Great job, Amazon. )",1481155200,,307,4.5
7420247,1,B014N8A3XI,This is a poor copy manufactured outside of the US.  There are periodic short skips in the audio and occasional glitches in the video.,1478908800,,134,4.583333333333333

7420252,5,B014N8A3XI,"Two of the greatest children's horror movies of all time. I was worried that time had smoothed over a terrible franchise, and that I would hate them now as an adult, but nothing could be further from the truth. Nostalgia and childhood glee have won the good fight, and I count this two-pack amongst the most prized films I own.
The price is kinda steep, but totally worth it.
Great for kids, and adults alike. I love these films!",1465344000,6,429,4.443037974683544
7420253,5,B014N8A3XI,"If you grew up in the 80s, you probably watched these movies every Halloween, I know I sure did. I still love them today and I'm 35. My 14 year old stepson thought they were kinda boring, but at least he can say he's seen them. Most kids today don't know about these gems.",1458000000,2,272,4.055555555555555

8731450,5,B014N8A3XI,"How can you get more ""NOSTALGIC"" than this old hidden gem?  A forgotten jewel, as it were ... a masterpiece from the old Disney Sunday night movies ... I couldn't believe when I found this treasure of a film for sale.  My VHS has been LOOONG blown out!  This DVD looks good, audio is great ... for $40 bucks that I paid, I figured, I got 2 movies.

8731454,1,B014N8A3XI,"The one star is because the price listed on this is pretty ridiculous considering you can get it for 25$ or less on the Disney Movie Club website.
I went to the Disney site to purchase instead. Absolutely loved Mr Boogedy & Bride of Boogedy as a kid, and still love to watch it now, as do my own kids. It's part of our Halloween movie line-up every year again since I found it on dvd. (a few years ago we finally wore out and had to retire the vhs copy of it that I'd had since I was a kid, lol)",1481500800,,495,3.8627450980392157
