7793331,2,0879463287,"The Stations of the Cross are good, although I would have preferred that they were in color.  In fact, the entire DVD is in black and white.  That was the first negative for me.  I was looking for a Rosary DVD that would be visually stimulating for meditation on the mysteries.  In my opinion, watching other people pray the rosary does not bring the mysteries to mind.  In this DVD a group of people are seated, holding rosaries while an unseen man prays the prayers of the rosary.  The group holding the rosaries never even move their lips.  I found this weird.  The camera would break away from these people from time to time and show waving grass in a field, or a lone flower or a far off mountain, all in black and white.  It never showed anything of the mystery except briefly before the decade was prayed.  I was distracted from the mysteries,  I won't use it again.",1449100800,5,873,4.39375
7793332,3,0879463287,nice meditations sound quality and video seemed a little dated but effective for prayer,1418601600,,87,5.285714285714286
7793333,2,0879463287,This appears to be a very low-budget DVD.  I wanted something with nice visuals and an enthusiastic group of people saying the rosary.  The people in the DVD look like they are nodding off.  Most of the time a group is saying the rosary but the people in the DVD aren't moving their mouths.  Not an uplifting spiritual event.,1386115200,3,325,4.4576271186440675

If you want to be able to enjoy saying the rosary or the Stations of the Cross anytime you want - this is a wonderful DVD to have.
I enjoyed it and it helps me to be able to have a visual experience while I listen, mediate upon the Lord, and pray.",1329436800,8,293,3.9
