8178779,5,B000B5MCDW,The impendingly vertiginous pace of the editing plus the exceptionally inventive special effects make this film a delight to watch. In addition the audience can't help but feel profound identification with the trials and travails of our deeply scarred but ultimately victorious scanner.
