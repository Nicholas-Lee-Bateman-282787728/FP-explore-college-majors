8071982,4,B000A1EBHC,"The only actor familiar to me in this film is Charlie Schlatter, but here
everyone seems just about perfect. This Australian film tells the story
of two young people who love each other, and interestingly enough have  (contrary to similar films)
more realistic view of what it will take to stay together. Sclatter's character
knows he has to work in order to provide an income and this proves to
be easier said than done. No spoilers in this review. The lack of an Australian accent
in Schlatter's character is explained by his being born in Australia, raised in America,
and coming back not long before this story begins. Nice photography, nice extras in
brief comments by Schlatter and his co-star. Also an interesting short film about the
musical score by American composer Miles Goodman.  This is the Region 4 edition, which
makes me glad I have a multi-region player. BEWARE of a Region 1 edition which reportedly
has poor quality, and no extras.",1376352000,,951,4.828220858895706
8071983,5,B000A1EBHC,"Ok, here's the thing about this DVD. If you have a multi-region player, this is the version you want (This movie was put on DVD for Australia only!). So if you have any other version, then you have a boot-leg version with bad picture (VHS quality) and no special features. I noticed that there is another version here on Amazon that is NTSC format with a different cover case. The reviews on that has mentioned the bad picture quality, no special features, and the cover on the case looks like a photocopy. Fans of Kylie (in the US), don't get fooled by it. You must remember that this DVD was only availble in Australia, so in PAL format only. So if you don't have a multi-region player, I suggest you do cause you will not want the US boot-leg on this, plus some crazy dealer on here is selling it for $44.95. I got my official Australian version for $18.99 here, got it yesterday in the mail as a matter of fact. Now about this DVD, it's so awesome! Being a big Kylie fan here in the states, this is a gem! The picture is perfect, clear, and crisp in widescreen. Now here's a sweet surprise, the description on Amazon has this as 2.0 Dolby Digital, as well as on the back of the DVD case. But when you select the audio option, BOOM...there is a 5.1 surround option, and it sounds awesome! For a 1989 film, this DVD makes it look and sound like todays films! Special features include theatrical trailer, 1989 interviews with Kylie, Charlie, and director, on the set featurette, and film score featurette. The film itself is a real feel good movie. This was my first time veiwing it, and did I get a surprise in the middle of the film! This is a real treat for all Kylie guy fans (and I guess girls that likes girls)! Being Kylie's first ever movie, this is a must have for any Kylie collection!",1368489600,,1796,4.348214285714286
8071984,4,B000A1EBHC,"Yes, the NTSC version isn't the greatest transfer. It appears to be a direct transfer from a VHS. But it's not the worst I've seen and it's the only way to get/watch this movie in the US/Canada, if you can find a copy. Unless you have a multi-region player. The back cover does say ""Digital remaster"", which doesn't appear to be correct. Also, some of the dialogue was a bit hard to understand due to background noise and thick Aussie accents. Subtitles would have been nice, but they aren't included.

The film itself is a good story with good acting. A must for fans of Kylie Minogue or Charlie Schlatter. Or even if you want to see a good film.

The only special feature shows filmographies for a few of the people involved. Unfortunately the NTSC version doesn't include the ""making of"" and ""interview"" features the Region 4 PAL version does.",1281225600,2,846,4.596026490066225
8071985,1,B000A1EBHC,"This review is not for the actual film but the DVD's quality.  Be warned.  The NTSC version of this film, released by New Star Video is very low in quality.  It's clearly an amateurish transfer from a VHS tape (you see lines and static while watching the DVD) and not the sharpest image either. Steer clear of this one, unless you don't have access to a Region Free DVD Player and are desperate to watch this film.  The cover (which looks like a color photocopy) states that it has been Digitally Remastered.  What they left off the end of that sentence is ""in my neighbor's living room.""",1238976000,3,588,4.457943925233645
8071986,4,B000A1EBHC,"Now, I have been a Kylie fans for years, and I think seen almost everything she has ever done!  Including several Mardi Gra performances!  Kylie has, and always will have, old fashioned star quality...And, she has it in this film too, in abundence!
Kylie herself once said, she's still around cause she does a bit of everything...but, this film proves she does a bit of eveything very well!
Kylie shines here in this light romance, that as it rolls along, will charm even the most harden viewer!  Okay, it is not high art but it's better than most CGI films around today!  Ps.  Kylie sings Tears on my Pillow in the closing credits!",1182470400,4,632,4.557522123893805
