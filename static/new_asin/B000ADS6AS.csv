8078044,5,B000ADS6AS,Tony is one of the most amazing Celtic guitarist around. He is also a great teacher. This DVD comes with detailed tabs and a great song selection. This is not really a beginners video so I recommend this if you have the basics down. This jumps right in like you already have that knowledge. So if you are looking to advance on your skills this is a great video. A+,1335657600,2,364,4.214285714285714
