1715713,5,B000067IYK,"This play is a classic!  I was fortunate enough to see it live and WOW is it powerful.  If you haven't already, read the book and get the play.  It's a wonder testimate to what its like being black and a women!",1232841600,,210,3.9523809523809526
1715714,5,B000067IYK,"Anyone who considers themselves to be a theatre aficionado should be familiar with this piece.  This work never gets old, it's a wonderful presentation on the Black experience from a woman's perspective.  Reading is great, seeing it is better.  If you're a Black actress, it should unquestionably be on your shelf.",1207353600,,314,5.117647058823529
1715715,3,B000067IYK,"The performances in this are spectacular. Shange's poetry comes alive.

However, there are two problems I have with this. First, is that one of the poems is left out entirely (latent rapist). Second, they have men in the film that speak some of the words. I think the power of ""for colored girls"" comes from the words only coming from women, since this play is for girls from women's mouths.

Still an amazing piece of artistry, and better than not seeing it live at all.",1175299200,22,471,4.529411764705882
1715716,5,B000067IYK,"Great work! I have heard parts of this play through out the years- but I was not expecting to see or hear-what I heard and what I saw on this dvd. It is off the chain!  If you want to see real black talent-  check it out! Also big props to Lynn Whitfield (damn- she is too sexy in this short skirt and midriff blouse- walking down the street- and giving it up real- This women can act and has great command of the stage  (also see her work in ""Zora is my name!""-another tour deforce- for above the board talent- regardless of the color of the production! & a big shout out to Mrs. Ruby Dee).  Ms. Woodard is one of the main reasons why I purchased this dvd - I wanted to view her earlier work and she is up in here-giving it up! In one scene- this dark beauty is sitting in a chair with a night gown on-trying to make sure those legs stay crossed. lol

In my book-Alfre is one the greatest actors in the world- and she still hasn't gotten her props. This woman has a great body of work and she can ACT!  All of the actors in this project come through with flying colors, and I really enjoyed watching this dvd.  Also the writing is very, very tight. Playwriting at its best. Now I see what all the fuss was about! Talent up the Ying yang.",1145664000,19,1238,4.049180327868853
1715717,5,B000067IYK,"Like a previous reviewer, I too searched for a copy of this tele-play for years until on a whim, I search Amazon and viola!! - bought it!

I remember seeing the teleplay on PBS so many years ago and the memories of the performances of all of the ladies stayed with me but especially those of the young & talented future stars - Alfre Woodard & Lynn Whitfield.

Having read the novel first, I was impressed by the way the stories were brought to life in front of my eyes and I loved how the first ""poem"" was translated to song and sung by the magnificent, Patti LaBelle.

I'd highly recommend this to fans of not only the aforementioned actresses but also of the works of Ntozake Shange.",1140825600,5,686,4.34375

1715800,5,B000067IYK,"A must see.  The new is good, but this original stage play is packed with POWERFUL acting.  Will make you think.  I will order this again.  Loved it soo much that I loaned it out.  You know how that can go sometimes,lol!",1394755200,,220,4.142857142857143
1715801,1,B000067IYK,i loved it. we are using it for our women ministry. this has a strong biblical aspect to it. women embracing the rainbow promise of God and finding themselves in the colors of life (rainbow),1379116800,,190,4.457142857142857

1715803,5,B000067IYK,"i would suggest this title to everyone . some of the poetry i didn't understand , but the emotion and preformances in scenes seemed to completely fill in the blanks for me . This  movie holds your interest from begining to end ;and this is a wonderful movie to have in your collection.",1369526400,,285,4.377358490566038
1715804,5,B000067IYK,After seeing the movie remake. I wanted to see the original play. I like it just S much as I like the movie.,1362355200,,108,3.739130434782609
1715805,3,B000067IYK,I also saw Tyler Perry's rendition of this movie and it was really good.  I think this play was before its time and i really enjoyed it.,1357516800,,136,4.037037037037037
1715806,5,B000067IYK,I checked a number of websites (including P.B.S.) before finding this telecast from the early 80's on Amazon. I was thrilled to watch it again and the delivery time was great. NOTE: This is quite theatrical as it was a made for t.v. version of the play so this is a bit different from the movie.,1336176000,,295,4.285714285714286
1715807,5,B000067IYK,had wanted to see the original since I heard of the play.  Amazing actors who are seasoned today are featured in this.  Just as touching as the current film based after this.,1322265600,,174,4.40625
1715876,5,B000067IYK,"I cannot discribe the overwhelming rush of emotion as I was able to identify with segments seeing my own life's experience as well as the experiences of my sisters  portrayed by a cast that did not simply act out character lines but placed them selves into the character, and lived each verse.  The play was alive!",1300233600,,314,4.589285714285714
1715877,5,B000067IYK,"I originally saw the PBS version of this incredible Mistresspiece of a Poem on PBS.  I have been familiar with this Poem since then.  I am so excited by the prospect of buying this version and also the new one.  Both the casts have some really actresses in them.  As a Poet myself, I love poetry.",1298764800,,296,4.232142857142857
1715878,1,B000067IYK,This TV version has been changed in a way that takes most of the poetry and meaning out of it. People who want to see what the original was like should look at Black Theater Ensemble's videos on YouTube.,1297036800,2,203,4.230769230769231
1715879,4,B000067IYK,This movie is about three girls rethinking their worst livelihood.  The movie is excellent if you can relate to it.  It took stead focus to understand some of it.,1295481600,,162,4.551724137931035
1715880,5,B000067IYK,"I saw the play in high school, then the PBS version on television and enjoyed both. Once the movie ""For Colored Girls"" was released I knew Tyler Perry probably ruined the story line.  I didn't waste my time  seeing the movie. Instead I bought PBS' version. The cast and music score is superb. This is a must have period piece. If you saw ""For Colored Girls,"" do yourself a favor and buy PBS version and view how Tyler Perry destroyed a beautiful work of art. People let's be realistic-with advance medicine and free clinics why did Tyler Perry have character get a back alley abortion? Why did he add Whoopi and Felicia Rashad's character? Could they be people from Perry's past? Maybe he changed script, and added characters to tell his own story.",1294444800,2,748,4.616541353383458
1715881,5,B000067IYK,"Read the book,and the dvd helped expand my understanding of the poetry. I think Alfre Woodard is the greatest actress ever and Lynne Whitfield is right up there with her. It was great to see them just starting, loved their performances. I am on the notify list for the release of the new movie by Tyler Perryon DVD. Plan to reread the book once I see the movie. Big ups to the author for a classic.",1294358400,,398,4.25
1715882,4,B000067IYK,"This was excellent to look at, and see the cast and how they started out (in their 20's) and it was cool to see how the original version was, versus the newer version with Janet Jackson, etc.",1293667200,,191,4.1891891891891895
1715883,4,B000067IYK,"I had seen the original play in my youth and Tyler Perry's rendition opening weekend, so I had to view this as well. It was a blast from ""Back in the Day"", but wonderful to see a very youthful Lynn Whitfield and Alfre Woodard!!! I had forgotten the opening poem that introduced the movie but was quickly refreshed.
It serves as an important part of the trio to get the full impact of what the author is so brilliantly speaking of.
All three have their rightful place to each generation at it's time.",1291075200,,499,4.376344086021505
1715884,5,B000067IYK,I'm receiving purchases from Amazon quicker with each order.  If I didn't know any better I'd think this item was sent overnight.  I was a little girl when this play was on Broadway and never got to see it live.  DVD came brand new.,1291075200,,232,4.2272727272727275
1715925,5,B000067IYK,"I had to see the original play because when It first opened in 1972 I was barely legal. It was confusing then because of where my head was, but now it is emotional, powerful and dramatic. This author was so in tune with the era and making a statement that we could relate to. I hope Tyler Perry can uphold the integrity of this play. (I'm sure he has put much thought and time into the remake) I haven't watched the new version (2010) yet, but I can't wait!! I felt I needed to watch this older version so that I could watch the newer version with more understanding.",1290124800,,567,4.2110091743119265
1715926,4,B000067IYK,"I had never seen this but wanted to with the new Tyler Perry version coming out.  It is a bit dated, but still good in it's own right.  I have seen both versions (current/old) and would recommend seeing this version 1st.",1289692800,,220,4.341463414634147
1715927,5,B000067IYK,"Early reviews are seeping in on the feature film Tyler Perry version of this great play. While scanning Amazon, much to my delight, I found the original PBS  version that I fell in love with. At the time, I had an old Akai (is that company even still around) VHS player that drug on significant parts of the play. But the power of Lynn Whitfield (my introduction) and Alfre Woodward's (also my introduction) performances are undeniable. I remember watching this play repeatedly and being swept by its sad emotive powers. There are so many budding actors that perform in this play version that if it is your first time, you will be impressed.

The play is so strong it is hard to imagine that Tyler Perry really does as poor a job directing as early reviews from Variety and Hollywood Reporter are indicating.

No one is disputing  the strong acting job in the forthcoming feature film so I am not sure what all the drama is about.

But do yourself a favor and take in this version. I am sure it is as good if not better than the forthcoming feature film.",1288828800,4,1054,4.46875
1715928,5,B000067IYK,"I remember watching this on PBS when I was in high school, it was a class assignment. I attended an all girls, predominately black school and I like most of my classmates were moved by this production. It was the first time I had ever seen Lynne Whitfield and her performance stood out for me.",1288483200,,293,4.345454545454546
1715929,5,B000067IYK,"I enjoyed this DVD! I remembered seeing this on TV as a child. If you are a collector of DVD's such as myself this is a must have. Tyler Perry is making this DVD a movie, and it would be great to have the original classic before you run out and buy the Tyler Perry's movie,you will be able to relate to his movie/characters better. It would be like you read the book before you see the movie.",1280275200,2,392,4.038461538461538
1715930,3,B000067IYK,I like the movie but I think maybe i need to watch it again(without distractions) lol but Lynn whitfield and Alfre Woodard did a great job...the video is enjoyable :),1270166400,,166,4.566666666666666
1715931,4,B000067IYK,"I did enjoy this film and the actors were some of my favorites.  However, the raw emotion and up close, in your face shared experiences did not come across as strongly as in the stage play.  I don't remember the names of the actresses that played Alfie Woodard and Lynn Whitfields part in the original stage performance but they were definately missed in the movie.",1267920000,2,365,4.6
1715932,5,B000067IYK,"after having this for a year, I finally watched it a few months ago. great spoken word dvd. the feeling that the women express, makes it more enjoyable. it was weird seeing Alfree Woodard and Lynne Whitfield, before they were famous, but still looking the same. i really enjoyed this dvd.",1258848000,,288,4.666666666666667
1715933,5,B000067IYK,"This video was in excellent condition when I received it and was exactly what I expected it to be. Anyone reading this review shoud immediately look up the book, the play, the movie and anything else involved with this work. It is an amazing piece entitled, ""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow is Enuf"" by Ntozake Shange. It is a beautiful choreopoem that follows the stories of 7 women of color as they recall what it is to be a black woman in America including the hardships, triumphs, trials, and tribulations, but also the beautiful moments. We are a multi-dimensional and beautiful people and this DVD only serves to bring all of these truths to life.",1250726400,,684,4.708333333333333
1715934,4,B000067IYK,"Good showing on DVD. I had heard of the play and never had a chance to see it. This was a very good movie, clear and concise.",1236729600,,125,3.6666666666666665
7963012,5,B000067IYK,Thought provoking!,1513641600,,18,8.5
7963013,3,B000067IYK,"Since this is part of the Broadway Archive Series I expected it to be much closer to the stage play. Instead the director has introduced male actors, who don't say anything, but interact with the women. The sets change as well to much more realistic settings than the minimal boxes of the stage play. The actresses aren't identified by their colors as in the original and the poems are not all spoken by the same characters that they would be in the original. Several of the performances are outstanding, particularly Alfre Woodard. It's nice to see Ntzoke Shange herself. But I don't think the changes made enhanced the play. I mostly found them distracting.",1496880000,,659,4.7894736842105265

7963015,1,B000067IYK,"I saw the original on Broadway in the 1970s. It was stunning!
I expected this to be the same production. It certainly is not. I think it's awful and really diminishes the power of the show that I saw.",1488412800,,200,4.153846153846154
