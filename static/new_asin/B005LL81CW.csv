4829222,3,B005LL81CW,"While I fully support Full Moon and their endeavors moviewise, I was disappointed with this one. Killer Eye: Halloween Haunt tells the story of Jenna, who asks three of her friends(at least, until a fourth one shows up) to help convert an old mansion into a Halloween Haunt. Things go awry when they accidently unleash a killer from another dimension...The Killer Eye. The Killer Eye needs to procreate to make other killer eyes and that's wherein the story lies.

Normally, I wouldn't knock a movie with that kind of storyline. Heck, I love B-movies. I love sexy women, too(I am a hot-blooded american male, after all). But, this movie just didn't do anything for me. The storyline, itself, was thin as paper. The dialogue seemed to be something that was made up as these women went along. It also seemed as though they reused exterior scenes over alot. It's apparent this was made on a shoestring budget. And, lastly, what was up with all the boob shots? I mean, come on, was that put in there because the storyline and dialogue didn't quit cut it just to keep us watching? The original movie was way better than this one and, sad to say, it was pretty bad for a b-movie.

As much as I'd love to recommend this one, heck-even lie and say it's one of Full Moon's better ones....I just can't do it. It's godawful..and that's being nice about it. It's one Full Moon picture that you might want to avoid.",1328832000,,1402,4.559523809523809
4829223,1,B005LL81CW,"I actually love bad movies.  It kind of goes along with being a horror movie fan.  I always review these type of movies better than average because they are entertaining for me.  This one, however, was even more awful than I could have imagined.  The plot? is about a group of girls who get together for a party to decorate one of their houses for Halloween.  It starts with the usual slutty teenage girls and lots of sexual inuendo.  At some point during their decorating process, they come accross a replica of the Killer Eye, which also contains a copy of the 90's movie.  They decide to watch the movie.  Much time is spent watching the original Killer Eye movie, which is a movie like the ones I referenced in the beginning.  It was bad, but in a good way.  Anyway, a crystal ball that is in the room somehow brings the replica killer eye to life.  The killer eye is quite a voyeur and seems to have a affinity for watching lesbian sex.  It tries to hypnotize the girls into having sex with each other.  Some girls die, a couple survive and smash the horny little eye and thankfully, the movie ends.  The only good thing that I can say about this movies is it's only a little over an hour long.",1328400000,,1199,4.318385650224215
4829224,1,B005LL81CW,"First indicator of what's to come is the poor echo like audio coupled with a too-cheap-for-subtitles studio thus making dialogue difficult to follow.
Second, the grade school dialogue consisted mostly of lines of fewer than nine words; complemented with the read-the-teleprompter crutch when it exceeded nine words, which was seldom.
Third, four female victims (of course) with my turn, your turn reading where the camera pans to each person who reads their line, and so on, continuously in a tedious robotic sequence.
Fourth, all filmed in maybe two rooms with a lot of reused Halloween props from the Full Moon props warehouse. Motion activated skeletons - that kind of stuff.
Fifth, prop eyeball with the use of clear fishing line and camera angles slowly slithers toward each girl. Next scene the girl is either dead and covered in red dyed syrup or has been hypnotized into acting dead. Final scene is of girl smashing eyeball with sledge hammer and along with co-survivors they look at a little glass ball with smoke inside accompanied by the customary Tarot cards close by - anticlimactic. The next day I even forgot how the movie ended.",1327795200,,1144,4.963541666666667
4829225,3,B005LL81CW,"Killer Eye: Halloween Haunt is just a decent way to kill 66 minutes. It's got hot girls, most of which show their boobs. And there is some humorous dialogue exchanges between the girls. Also the killer eye itself is pretty cool. So is the look of the film. Then again, most Full Moon movies that I've seen do have high production value for low-budget films. The problem with Killer Eye: Halloween Haunt is that it is pretty much all style, very little substance. You'll enjoy it while watching it, but you'll forget about it a few minutes later. Still, it's worth watching once for Full Moon fans.",1323734400,7,597,4.588785046728972

8478277,4,B005LL81CW,"This film is a throw back to the whimsical ""horror"" films of the 80's which featured topless women. It is a watered down version of ""Evil Toons."" A group of young ladies decide to fix up a house for Halloween, one that has a bunch of weird stuff that didn't fit into the plot...like the crystal ball. The girls watch a movie called ""Killer Eye"" with a ""Killer Eye"" prop.

Soon the girls are running and screaming around the house in various stages of undress and blood attempting to escape those possessed by said eye.

A film for mindless fun. Film was barley an hour long.

8478280,2,B005LL81CW,"Back in 1999, Charles Band and Full Moon Entertainment produced a movie called THE KILLER EYE.  Then in 2011, they released the not-quite sequel, KILLER EYE: Halloween Haunt.

In this movie, Jenna (Erica Rhodes, PLAGUE TOWN) has invited over some friends, Rocky (Chelsea Edmundson, GANGSTER SQUAD), Catalina (Ariana Madix, THE DEAD WANT WOMEN) and Kiana (Lauren Furs, Switched at Birth) to help her decorate the house for the annual haunted house Jenna and her mother do every Halloween.  Apparently, according to Jenna, this is how they make their money for the year.  That must be some haunted house.  Usually Jenna and her mother take care of everything, but this year, Jennas mother is helping her aunt who is getting out of the hospital.

The girls start to drink and decorate, but a good ten minutes in, theyve decorated themselves into exhaustion so they decide to take a break and watch a movie.  Rocky has found a box containing a two-foot long replica of the Killer Eye along with a DVD of the movie, so they decide to watch it.

Bad news for the girls, the replica comes alive and makes it way through the house later that night, possessing and killing the girls as it tries to mate with them.

Yeah, thats the plot of the movie.  Its Charles Band, what did you expect?  Obviously any hope of a plot that wasn't totally ridiculous was out of the question.

KILLER EYE: Halloween Haunt is a whole 67 minutes long, with over 10 of those minutes devoted to opening and closing credits.  Everything in between is a handful of pretty girls in their underwear making out or running from the killer eye.  In fact, girls in their underwear making out or running from the killer eye seems to be the entire reason this movie was made, because it sure as hell wasn't about a good story, quality acting or serious scares.

For a horror movie, this one is not only not scary, but pretty embarrassing throughout.  And the dialogue!  Bad dialogue is enough, but bad dialogue uttered by bad actors makes for a nearly unwatchable movie.  Thank God it was so short.

The production quality looks pretty good, and it was fun to look around the haunted house they were putting together and spot other Full Moon properties.  I saw Killer Klowns, I saw the Gingerdead Man, one of the puppets from the Puppet Master movies, plus Killjoy.  They weren't IN the movie as characters, just Halloween decorations.  Considering how tricked out that house was, there were probably dozens more I didn't recognize, but just from the Full Moon movies Im familiar with, I spotted those characters.

The effects were pretty good, considering with a killer eye on the loose, there wasn't much gore.  But what was shown looked like Full Moons making great strides in quality--at least in terms of how their movies look.  Theyre still dumb and lack any real story or good acting, but at least it looked good.

While the story was Bands, Kent Roudebush and August White wrote the script.  When I look at their combined resumes, which include THE GINGERDEAD MAN, DECADENT EVIL, EVIL BONG 3D and DOLL GRAVEYARD, the simplicity of the plot and the lame dialogue makes perfect sense.  Band did direct, however, and I know he likes to whip these things out as quick as possible, but jeez, its not going to be the end of the world if you actually DIRECT the actors to a good performance.  Then again, hes used to working with puppets and dolls, so maybe a wooden performance is just what hes used to (thank you, thank you, Ill be here all week!).

Its probably a good thing Ive seen enough Full Moon movies already to go into this one expecting to be disappointed.  But theres only so many times you can have that particular expectation met before you give up.  My kingdom for a Charles Band/Full Moon movie that looks like any real effort was put into telling a good story.  At the very least, hire actors who can do the thing they were hired to do.",1385856000,,3915,4.619392185238785

8478282,2,B005LL81CW,"For those unfortunate enough to have seen the first KILLER EYE, a followup would seem to spell 'disaster,' but KILLER EYE: HALLOWEEN HAUNT ranks alongside KILLJOY 3 and DEMONIC TOYS 2 as one of Full Moon's surprise sequels! Jenna invites her three hottest friends over to decorate for Halloween, when one of the props is zapped to life by her mother's crystal ball! One by one, the girls succumb to the eye's evil wishes, leaving Jenna to fend for herself as it attempts to impregnate her with its seed. KILLER EYE 2 is just pure campy fun that never gets bogged down by unnecessary story or character. Where else can you find a group of sexy, half-naked babes running away from an over-sexed killer eyeball in a creepy haunted house? With the help of prop maker Adam Johnston and the gruesome art designs of Sean P. Rodgers, Charles Band creates one of the company's best-dressed sets in years. The lifeless underacting from each of the girls only plays into the cheesiness of the plot, and can be forgiven in exchange for plenty of mindless nudity and gratuitous gore. Full Moon fans are sure to love this latest creation from the makers of EVIL BONG and THE GINGERDEAD MAN!
