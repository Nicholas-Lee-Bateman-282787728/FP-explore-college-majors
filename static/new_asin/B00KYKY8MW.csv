8662638,4,B00KYKY8MW,"Fans of Japanese ero-weirdness are doubtless aware that the ""Flower and Snake"" 'concept' (originally penned by revered Japanese S/M author Oniroku Dan) is one of the more enduring bits of erotica in Japan - it has spawned its' own mini-franchise.  The 'original' Flower & Snake tale has been translated to the screen twice by different (major) Jap. Directors and there were 4 additional subsequent spin-offs of lesser repute.  This latest entry from Toei Studios: ""Flower & Snake - Zero"" (2014) makes the fifth re-hash of the story.

The basic premise in all of the F&S plots (that hearken back to the original Oniroku Dan concept) concern the 'wife' figure in a marriage who gives herself over to some nefarious person(s) in order to atone for some problem that her husband is having (usually 'owing money' to the yakuza or similar transgression).  The dutiful wife is subsequently subjected to some sort of BDSM travails that she stoically endures - often emerging from the experience as a sexually altered personage.

Somehow, the copy of ""Flower & Snake Zero"" that I ordered did not have any English translation/sub-titles - SO - I was not able to understand a lot of the 'subtleties' of what was going on in the plot - YET, even without words, the action and intent was fairly easy to follow.

The story involves 3 women: a female detective who appears to be attempting to infiltrate an S/M organization, a horny young woman who is intrigued with the world of BDSM, and the de rigeur 'wife' figure of a desperate business man who has been coerced into participating in bondage productions that are distributed over the internet. Ultimately, all 3 of these women configure in a climatic BDSM 'show'.

Technically, this film is shot with crystal clear (widescreen) digital imagery and has very nice production values.  While there is a lot of rather implausible action portrayed - the movie might be thought of as sort of a live action Manga feature and is pretty 'over-the-top' and 'amusing' in many of its' aspects.  The other element that features prominently in all 'Flower & Snake' scenarios is the presence of a lot of Japanese 'shibari' style rope bondage, and this film has many fine examples!  The climatic scene has an amazing sequence where all 3 of the 'heroines' are joined in an intricate web of suspension bondage - worth the price of the disk alone!

It is also worth noting that this film does not have any of the annoying digital censorship imposed on the pubic regions of the actors!  While these productions are generally not overly explicit in their depictions of sexual activities ""F&S-0"" offers lots of female nudity (including some full frontal) and many kinky scenarios.

Although I would not rate this film as in the same league as the 2 'original' Flower & Snake features - it IS a lively and fun watch and a worthy addition to the franchise.  Try to get a copy w/ English sub-titles - the BluRay version apparently has them but not the regular DVD - AND - note that the 'format' is Region 2 which requires a 'region-free' player to access!",1438214400,,3070,4.7897727272727275
8662639,1,B00KYKY8MW,"Don't be fooled by this new production - it is a B-movie with zero production value, zero talent in acting, zero artistic appeal, zero plot, zero depht, zero character development and - just to sum it up - zero place in the history of World cinema.

The ""story"" is based on the fetish of the female police investigator who becomes the victim of sexual assault. Sounds like the plot of a porn, but here it is attempted as a plot of a mainstream movie - needless to say, without success.

It quickly becomes very hard to view the protagonist as female cop - she is quickly reduced to beig nothing more than a sex-starving woman who is turned on by the live action shown at the illegal website, she ""investigates"".

If you think that this sounds like a very thin plot, you won't be disappointed. The plot is indeed very, very thin, supported by poor acting and huge holes at the size of Grand Canyon.

I would love a high quality new production of Hana to Hebi, believe me, but this is not it - it is very, very far from it. Take the sound effects - the guns sound like something from a Comodore-64 video game of the 1980'es. And everything that goes on in this movie is just so unrealistic and unexplained that it is beyond belief.

1 - She is a female cop. 2 - She enjoys the live sex show on the internet. 3- She is suddenly (and with zero explanation) called by the administrator of the site. 4 - With no questions at all, she strips naked on his command (of course, of course, like any rational cop would do). 5 - She participates in a live sex show herself. 6 - The end. - 7. Closing credits roll over the screen.

Don't waste your time and money. Skip this movie and cross your fingers that something better will come up.",1421452800,,1725,4.276073619631902
