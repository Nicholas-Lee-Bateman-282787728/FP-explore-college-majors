8214706,5,B000USN8A6,If Tomorrow Comes is a very good look  at World War Two ideas of how Japanese descent people were treated. Patty Duke gives a wonderful performance as an American  girl in love with a Japanese boy. Anne Baxter provides great support as their friend.,1375488000,2,249,4.636363636363637

8214708,4,B000USN8A6,"In 1972, my Wisconsin High School US History class/books did not cover this issue and even later my 80's California college history/poli-sci classes didn't cover this subject. This movie was my first ever exposure to what the USA did to Japanese-Americans in WWII, for this reason I commend the guts and risk it took in making this movie.

Yes, this movie is a WWII Romeo-n-Juliet parity but it's the root of the story that's interesting. The only other movie I remember touching this subject was Midway, 1976. Patty Duke does her usual very good performance, as with all the actors, in showing the racial prejudice environment of 1941. The movie also touches on the CA communities prejudice against Japanese-Americans due to their ability to achieve economic success from inferior land. Due to their visual appearance they were erroneously 'all' suspected of being a foe to the USA, conversely the govt did not do this to German or Italian-Americans. If for nothing else this movie is an eye opener of an issue that should NEVER get buried into the achieves of historical complacency. Even due to Pearl Harbor, there was no conceivable justification for FDR's actions against ""natural born"" Americans that happen to have ancestral Japanese lineage/appearance!",1279065600,3,1260,5.116504854368932
