8384197,1,B002HIN4II,"I purchased this video for my 13y/o daughter who wanted to pick up the sport this summer in preparation for HS next year.  I was fully expecting to see video tape of coaches providing actual on-field instruction and kids going through drills in an active manner.  It was NOTHING like I expected.  Instead my daughter and I ended up watching a coach essentially READ about 45 minutes from a simple MS Power Point presentation through the WHOLE DVD!!!!!  Not ONCE was there even the SITE of a field, an active player, a stick, a ball, a goal... NOTHING!!!  It was honestly the very WORST purchase I have EVER made on line...EVER!  I have just requested a refund or a credit or something from the company who shipped it, and I HOPE they agree to something because this video was a TOTAL waste of time.  I would not recommend it to anyone... and for that matter would not GIVE IT to anyone for FREE.  Embarrassing product!  :(  Very, VERY disappointing!!!",1280448000,5,951,4.57396449704142
