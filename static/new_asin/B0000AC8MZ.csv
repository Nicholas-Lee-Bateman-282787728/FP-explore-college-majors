7996736,5,B0000AC8MZ,This is great for children that wants to learn about sports. My 4 1/2 year old likes it and taught him different drills before he started to play soccer. He plays and better understands how to play soccer now that he did before we got this dvd.,1344556800,,244,4.212765957446808
7996737,4,B0000AC8MZ,"I purchased this video for my 3 year old daughter and myself as I was volunteering to coach her soccer team. I was amazed at how she was singing all the songs because they were so catchy and implementing what she saw out on the field. Of course it taught her the very basics, and that was fine with me. I even went as far as purchasing a few for the 3 and 4 year olds on my team and their parents had the same response as me. I wouldn't really recommend this for kids over 5/6.",1232409600,2,477,3.9278350515463916
7996738,5,B0000AC8MZ,"I borrowed this from the library a week ago.  I almost didn't check it out, as it looked a bit corny . . . not as polished as so many other soccer dvds.  I was quite surprised when my 5-year-old son, who has a spring and fall soccer season under his belt, starting watching it over and over again.  Then my 9-year-old got hooked.  They both were rolling with laughter over the ""corny"" jokes made by the animated soccer balls.

My youngest was watching for the first time. About 20 minutes into the program he got up, went out into the dark backyard and returned carrying two cones and his soccer ball.  He set the cones up in front of the tv and started working on the moves demonstrated in the video.  I have a stack of professional coaching dvds.  I have tried to show my kids different moves  demonstrated on video but they haven't shown much interest.  However, they really got hooked by these Littlest Leaguers.  I think it because the moves aren't polished.  The moves are demonstrated by little kids just like my kids.  They are not super stars (or movie stars); they are just normal neighborhood kids.

This review comes from a soccer family.  I'm writing it because I'm really impressed on how much impact it had on my kids -- kids who are growing up in a home with professional soccer on the television at least every weekend.  This video conveys the basics of the game in terms kids can understand.",1204243200,5,1409,4.466666666666667

7996740,2,B0000AC8MZ,"This DVD was just okay in my book. A decent introduction into the game, but there were some weakness in the demonstration of the skills. But these aren't things that a child might pick up or emulate. Some of the techniques shown were performed at a slow pace and I think this video could have used 5-10 minutes of an actual game to show techniques being used at speed. Some parts of the DVD were just slow and might lose the attention of a young child. The music in the video is a little repetitive and basic, though enthusiastically performed. The video breaks down skill sets into dribbling, passing, trapping, shooting, and rules, as well as two scenes on sportsmanship. The animation was well done, but seemed a little awkward at times. On the plus side I thought the section showing some of the games and drills used to practice skills, particularly dribbling, were either okay or very good. I got this video for my three year old to help introduce him to the game and depending on how he reacts I'd be willing to rewrite this review.",1117670400,3,1039,4.531914893617022
