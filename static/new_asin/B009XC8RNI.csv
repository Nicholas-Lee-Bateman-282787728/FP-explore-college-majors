5370908,4,B009XC8RNI,"This episode in the ESPN series takes a look at teenager Ben Wilson who quickly became the number one high school player in the country but before he could take that talent to college or the professional league, he was shot and killed at the age of 17. The film talks to his friends, coaches and even some famous people who knew the young star to explain why his name and memory is still strong in Chicago. BENJI is another very well-made entry in the series, which just demands excellence. This story is one that could probably be told about many great players but from everyone interviewed it seems that this guy was someone special and someone that would probably be a legend had he not been murdered that day. Such famous faces as Common, R. Kelly, Jesse Jackson, Nick Anderson and Juwan Howard are interviewed about Wilson as they talk about what made him so special. Wilson's older brother is also interviewed and talks about the temper that might have led to his death. What actually happened to him is discussed as there are two sides of the story and we even get the murderer on hand telling his side of the events. I think the most shocking thing that comes from this story is that Wilson was the 669th victim in Chicago that year alone. Fans of the series are certainly going to want to check this one out as it features all the strong stuff that you've come to expect.",1364428800,,1380,4.458498023715415
