7838859,5,630311377X,"I coach youth soccer and I play in the adults league. I bought several books, videos, and dvd's about soccer training and coaching over the years. This particular video stands out among all of them. I was hoping and I am still looking for a DVD version because my tape is getting old and a DVD will make it easier to jump to certain chapters. Frans Van Balkom shows you all the tricks of fast footwork and feinting invented by soccer legends from Johan Cruyff to Maradona and many in between. and make them look easy. First you see the real move in a real game, then Frans demonstrates the move in normal speed and the action will be repeated from different camera angles. And then you will get the slow motion to give the exact drill. The narration is wonderful and all moves are explained. I highly recommend this video to anyone who wants to play real soccer, and those who are coaching others.",1208390400,,897,4.442424242424242
