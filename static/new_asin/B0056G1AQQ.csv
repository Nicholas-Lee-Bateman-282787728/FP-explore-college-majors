4588100,5,B0056G1AQQ,I have been watching the Red Green Show for over ten years.  You can see how the show matured over the years as additional funding allowed the writers to do more.  Seasons 1998 through 2005/2006 are my favorites.  These shows have offered me and my son a lot of laughs.  Its tough to get a teen to spend time with his parents but my son makes himself available to watch Red Green.  Thanks Red!,1318723200,,393,4.256756756756757
4588101,5,B0056G1AQQ,"3 years of fruitcake entertainment from the creation of Steve Smith (Red Green) & Rick Green (Bill). See more use of duct tape the ""Handy Man's Secret Weapon"" ""Spare the duck tape-spoil the job."" Hear the phrase ""If women don't find ya handsome, they should at least find you handy"" so often you'll be repeating it. Red can't explain nephew Harold (Pat McKenna) except ""Uncles can't be choosers.""  Red actually once told Harold, ""Speaking of misconceptions, of which you are one.""

Red Green, at some point in the set, is similar to other comedy stars. He resembles Red Skelton's commonness and innocent thinking. He resembles Tim Conway with off-beat gags, almost becoming believable. He's like Lucille Ball, Queen of American Comedy, a steady normal expression regardless of event preposterousness. He's Groucho Marx through smile-free one-liners. Green is Canada's Tim-The-Tool-Man-Allen. As straight faced, solemn through gags as Bob Newhart. Dare we compare to Bullwinkle the Moose?

This set is the continuation of the hilarious dull-witted back-woods red-neck show that continued for 1 1/2 decades and accumulated a cult-like following equal to many rock stars. This set contains 3 seasons. You might want 2, 1-4-U, & one a gift for family or friend who has the same off-the-wall humor so many of us have come to hold dear. It's a great `Man-Gift'. Women with a piqued sense of humor will find this show engaging. LOL comedy.

Bonus is an intro by Steve Smith and some character profiles of the zanier cast.
Closed Captioning is available, sometimes helpful when you are laughing too hard and loud to hear the audio.

4588102,5,B0056G1AQQ,I have been waiting years for these final seasons to come out on DVD! Can't wait! This is one fantastic show - one of which I own every episode and wish they had created more. Thank you acorn media!,1313452800,,198,4.102564102564102
4588103,5,B0056G1AQQ,"I watched this show as a teenager on PBS, it was great then, and it's even funnier now that I understand the more of the jokes. I am a fan of dark dramas like The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones, but it's nice to watch a show with some optimism once in a while. I would recommend to any guy between the ages of 14 and 114.",1396742400,,323,3.764705882352941
4588104,5,B0056G1AQQ,"The Red Green Show, especially those involving Harold, is a great little mindless escape while having a ""laugh at yourself"" sort of take on Human faults and foibles.  There is little as good for helping you put the days idiocies and idiots behind you, and helping you laugh them away as you relax for bed.  It's like the jester of ""videoland""!!",1368144000,,344,4.622950819672131
4588105,5,B0056G1AQQ,"I'm a man. But I can change. If I have to. I guess.

4588106,4,B0056G1AQQ,"For all those Red Green devotees, thisis a great addition to your collection of adventures by the boys of possum lodge! Now that the show has run its course, its nice to be able to re-live past episodes which seem to be timeless in their sometimes brainlessness!",1361059200,,262,4.595744680851064
4588107,5,B0056G1AQQ,"This series is the last of the TV series.  It is considered the ""geezer"" years.  I can certainly relate to the commentary and enjoy the duck tape suggested projects and repairs.  I especially like the ""Adventures with Bill"" segments.  I loved it on TV and now enjoy it any time I turn off the TV to get away from all the trash, foul language and ""reality TV programs"".",1355529600,2,368,4.367647058823529
4588108,5,B0056G1AQQ,I Got this for my Husband and he absolutely loves it. We watch it together and just crack up laughing .,1351555200,,103,3.9523809523809526
4588109,5,B0056G1AQQ,Can't ask for anything better. This is one of the funniest shows ever put on TV. Wish it were still on!,1347580800,2,103,3.9523809523809526
4588110,5,B0056G1AQQ,"There is nothing negative I can say about this show. Anyone wondering if Red Green is funny enough to watch 3 entire seasons - the answer is yes!
The DVD's work well and the show is just as funny as ever. It seems strange to ""want"" to pay to watch something that was shown on public access television for free, but this show has been work every minute.
I really enjoy the intro to each show. The DVD gives a nice, crisp picture.",1340323200,2,428,4.168674698795181
4588111,5,B0056G1AQQ,Finally being able to watch every season of this wonderful series. People either like it or they don't. Now check my supply of duct tape.,1334534400,,137,4.52

8459549,5,B0056G1AQQ,"Men beware! This show feels like a ""guy in his den show,"" but in reality, it is a smart satire of men in today's world. As they say on the show: ""I'm a man, and I can change, if I try -- I guess.""",1460073600,,196,3.477272727272727
