My only criticism of the movie is that the pace is a bit slow at the beginning; the movie gradually builds and you may need patience to get through the first few scenes of the film.  That being said, however, the final scenes of the film will stay with you for a while.",1351382400,,429,4.2073170731707314

4984085,2,B006E04D1C,"On a trip to Myanmar a while back, Secretary of State Clinton publicly expressed her admiration for Burmese political activist Aung San Suu Kyi, acknowledging her long personal struggle (including 15 years of house arrest) as head of an opposition party that has been (peacefully) attempting to bring democracy to a country that has been under oppressive military rule for 50 years. Indeed, Suu Kyi's story is an extraordinary one (and which one hopes is far from over). That's why it's a shame that Luc Besson's biopic, ""The Lady"", while timely in its release, can only be described as ""ordinary"" in its execution. It's an oddly uninvolving affair that starts off like ""Gandhi""...but ends up more like ""Camille"".

The film begins with a beautifully constructed and emotionally affecting preface depicting the 3-year old Suu Kyi kissing her father goodbye for what turns out to be the last time. The year is 1947, the place is Burma (as it was then known) and General Aung San (who today is considered the  nation's ""Father"" for his key role in helping it gain independence from British colonial rule) is off to a political meeting, where he is assassinated. The next time we see Suu Kyi (Michelle Yeoh), she is an adult, living in England with her husband, Oxford academic Dr. Michael Aris (David Thewlis). They have two teenage sons. When Suu Kyi learns that her mother is gravely ill, she returns to Burma to be at her side. It is during this visit (in 1988) that she realizes how socio-politically unstable her country has become, and how fear and dread rule the lives of her people. When she is asked by pro-democracy activists to remain in-country to lead their burgeoning movement, she accepts.

After this promising setup, I assumed that I was in for a rousing story of personal sacrifice and determination, set against a backdrop of intense political turmoil and sweeping historical breadth (something along the lines of ""The Year of Living Dangerously"" or ""The Killing Fields""). I assumed. But what follows instead is pure boilerplate; holding all the dramatic import of a Powerpoint presentation. Rebecca Frayn's screenplay takes a Cliff's Notes approach to Suu Kyi's life; for a 2  hour film, there are an inordinate amount of unanswered questions and expository holes. Perhaps most significantly, the film is marketed as being a great love story...but there is very little passion on display in the scenes between Thewlis and Yeoh; there is nothing offered onscreen that gives us any clue as to what sparked the attraction between the two. While I'll grant that it is possible Thewlis made an acting choice to play the ""stiff upper lip"" Englishman archetype, his behavior toward Yeoh plays out as formal and detached.

Instead, we're given a seemingly endless series of farewells and reunions, with Thewlis and sons leaving and arriving in taxis over the years, with only Eric Serra's overbearing orchestral swells on hand to cue us that we're supposed to be tearing up. And the part of the family's story that should truly move us, which was Dr. Aris' death from prostate cancer after spending the final 4 years of his life unsuccessfully petitioning the Burmese government for permission to visit Suu Kyi (under house arrest), is instead rendered like sudsy, almost laughable (if it weren't so inherently sad) Disease of the Week melodrama.

As I am a fan of his work, I was expecting much more from Besson, who has built his reputation on slickly produced, well-paced and visually inventive films that frequently feature strong female protagonists (""La Femme Nikita"", ""The Fifth Element"", ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc""). What he has delivered here (the opening 10 minutes aside) is a film that, while visually stunning, remains emotionally empty. For a more compelling portrait of modern-day Burma, I would recommend the documentary ""They Call it Myanmar: Lifting the Curtain"". In that film, you see and hear the real Suu Kyi, and although her appearance is brief, it reveals a whole lot more about the determination, grace and fortitude of this remarkable woman.",1349049600,3,4091,5.0
4984086,3,B006E04D1C,"""The Lady,"" a biographical picture of Aung San Suu Kyi, is directed by Luc Besson, best known for his ""La Femme Nikita,"" ""Lon: The Professional"" and ""The Fifth Element."" Michelle Yeoh plays the role of Aung San Suu Kyi, Burmese political and human rights activist. David Thewlis is her husband Dr. Michael Aris. (Thewlis also plays his twin brother Anthony.)

""The Lady"" starts in 1947. General Aung San was assassinated when his daughter Aung San Suu Kyi was only two years old. About forty years later, Aung San Suu Kyi, now living in Oxford with her husband and two sons, receives a call from Burma. Her mother is ill and in hospital. Aung San Suu Kyi flies back to Burma, where, witnessing the student protests and the bloody suppression of it, she decides to stay and become a leader of the movement for democracy.

Yes, it's Luc Besson and his usual collaborators cinematographer Thierry Arbogast and composer Eric Serra. Unlike in most of his films (including his recent ""Arthur"" trilogy),  his new film is not about a fantastical universe or underworld based on his wild imagination, but about a real-life person who is alive and in the middle of her political career. Actually, Besson made a ""bio-pic"" once, but I don't think historical accuracy was priority No. 1 in making ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"" for him.

While following her life as a political activist in Burma, Besson also tries to tell us a story of her relationship with her husband Michael Aris. In this way we get to see both her public and private face but despite the film's touching finale, ""The Lady"" suffers from its uneven pace that sometimes feels rushed. Most people other than Aung San Suu Kyi, and Michael Aris - generals, soldiers or citizens, whether Burmese or British - are relegated to caricatures or cyphers.

Acting is excellent. Michelle Yeoh plays the role of Aung San Suu Kyi with grace and dignity while David Thewlis turns in a moving performance as her husband supporting her even when he is thousands of miles away from her. Their strong bond is the driving force of the film, accompanied by the compelling photography.

""The Lady"" puts more focus on the relationship between Aung San Suu Kyi and Michael Aris, than her political career, for better or for worse. As a love story it works, thanks to the strong performances from the leads; as a biographical picture of Aung San Suu Kyi as one of the world's most iconic figures, perhaps we should wait for another film to be made, or read books.",1345766400,10,2506,4.723112128146453
4984087,5,B006E04D1C,"This film's great merit is its incredibly inspirational subject, a later-life biography of the luminous, internationally acclaimed democracy and peoples' rights activist, and Noble Peace Prize laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi.

Like much of the world, I am a long-time admirer of Aung San Suu Kyi.  I became familiar with this incredibly inspirational woman from just reading news articles about her in THE WASHINGTON POST.  This film admirably fleshes out these biographical details, into an extremely compelling story about her late-life activist endeavors on behalf of the ""Burmese"" people, a role she did not seek.  But she accepted this role, with unbelievable self-sacrifice on the part of herself and of her loving family.

Aung San Suu Kyi's petite physical attractiveness and captivating yet disarming personal presence, suitably complements her humanistic character.  The actress Michelle Yeoh is something of an Aung San Suu Kyi look-alike, and is a perfect choice to portray the attributes and accomplishments of Aung San Suu Kyi.  Michelle Yeoh's charismatic performance  of this role is outstanding.

Maybe I love Aung San Suu Kyi because she always wears flowers in her hair - always.  Remember the famous song lyric from the 1960s, ""Be sure to wear flowers in your hair!""

I was fortunate to view this film shortly before Aung San Suu Kyi made her triumphal visit to Europe in the summer of 2012, in part to receive a long delayed bestowal of her Nobel Peace Prize, and to hear parts of her acceptance speech.

Aung San Suu Kyi's triumphal tour of Europe also physically exhausted her - there was simply not enough of this petite and forcibly secluded woman to satisfy the overwhelming emotional embrace and demands of many people, and many countries, who all seemed to want her for themselves.  She even had the extremely rare honor of, I believe, a private citizen addressing the Parliament of the UK.

To quote the Olympic Creed, because Aung San Suu Kyi has ""endured the struggle,"" Aung San Suu Kyi ""Has brought honor to us all.""

Watch this DVD, and see why.

I will purchase a copy of this DVD for my 15-year old daughter, so she will know what a woman can do - particularly a woman in a repressive, patriarchal world.",1344816000,8,2234,4.933155080213904

Her poised but intense portrayal as well as her classic looks reveals so much about this amazing human being. Yeoh moves and waves in a much like manner and have us imagine how Aung San's strength and determination develops. Aung San's life is one to be celebrated, supported and imitated, particularly for being a woman that cries outloud against the crimes of her fellow countrymen. She carries such virtues and follow the example of courage of M. Gandhi. Michael Aris played outstandingly by David Thewlis who touches our hearts as a man of endless loyalty and support for his wife defending causes.

4984206,5,B006E04D1C,"Burmas political movement is a natural result against high pressure military government which disregard basic human rights and kill people like animals.

The special part of this political movement is Aung San Suu Kyi who after receive well education and live England for many years can lead people in Burma to truly know what is democracy by using her authority as the daughter of country independent father Aung San. And she did it and make most people in Burma know and trust democracy which is also the will of his father. This is a really impressive democracy movement and Aung San Suu Kyis non-violent political movement call makes it even more convincing.

The moving part of this film is beautifully depicting a female political leader inner motion, which is absolutely special since political leader is generally male and usually willing to scarify his family to his political ambition. However, as a mother and wife, it is not that easy to sustain separation from husband and son which is what love and motherhood means. This film perfectly explain why Suu Kyi refuse to come back to England with her family and her struggle to balance family and political dream. You cannot never imagine political struggle can be so elegant, beautiful and also heart-striking at the same time.

Aung San Suu Kyi with flowers who seems weak to solider with guns can win  Burmas peoples heart (even solider himself) is simply because a fair, productive  and loving society is universal dream for everyone, which i think what Luc Besson want to tell us. For people living developed country like west Euro or North America, it seems not that impressive. But if you have actual living experience in many high pressure society in East Asia, you can certainly understand why it is so eager to improve society.

After all, Luc Besson is talent screen builder who represent bloody military compression and peaceful protest, Suu kyi with flowers and solider with guns, the sound of weapon and the sound of piano making you feel the hope but also pain.",1434240000,,2036,4.886956521739131

4984217,3,B006E04D1C,"On the face of it, THE LADY has a lot going for it.  Filmed mostly in Thailand, it tells the story of Aung San Suu Kyi's (Michelle Yeoh's) progress from happily married homemaker in Oxford, England, to the leader of the democracy movement in Burma (Myanmar) imprisoned by the military for fifteen years.  The transition is not an easy one: the authorities try to make Suu's life as difficult as possible, by denying her freedom of movement and preventing her husband Michael (David Thewlis) from visiting her in Burman, even when he is dying with prostate cancer.  Yeoh delivers a first-rate performance; her face remains expressionless in public, especially while confronting the generals and their lackeys who try every single strategy they can think of to break her down.  Luc Besson's direction is both taut yet hard-edged; his handling of the crowd-scenes is especially good, particularly in the sequence where Suu addresses a band of pro-democracy demonstrators, but does not see the authorities taking off some of the demonstrators to prison at the back of the gathering.  The scene where Suu wins the election, and her supporters gather at the gates of her house, only to be repelled by gun-toting soldiers, is also memorable.  Yet the film as a whole is let down by Rebecca Frayn's clunky script, which is notable for its cliched scenes - as, for example, when younger son Kim Aris (Jonathan Raggett) crawls into his father's arms at their Oxford home and says ""I miss mum.""  Frayn's characterization of Suu is perfunctory: we get little sense of why she became such a celebrated figure resisting the military dictatorship, or what her politics actually were.  The script is far more concerned with revealing her enduring love for her husband.

4984268,5,B006E04D1C,"The director Luc Besson created a film that depicted the true essence and beauty of Aung San Suu Kyi. Alongside Suu Kyi, I had the privilege of enjoying her family, Burma and its people. I liked seeing Suu Kyi in Oxford with her family. It painted a different image of what I thought she was like. The actors were amazing and spoke with honesty. I could feel their frustrations, sadness, disappointments, triumphs and happiness. The cinematography was gorgeous and full of vibrance. I am already in love with the Burmese people and their country, and this film took it to another level for me.

I enjoyed seeing the more intimate side of Aung San Suu Kyi and her relationships with her husband and her two sons. It showed how patient and loving she was towards them, especially during adversity. Michelle Yeoh magnificently displays Suu Kyi as an honest, beautiful, compassionate, strong, stubborn woman, full of fervor and love for her family and her country. I felt Suu Kyi's pain during her struggle on whether she should go home to be with Mikey or stay in Burma. It was heart-wrenching to see her go through such pain but Mikey knew they had dedicated way too much of their lives to turn back now. It made me smile when she told him he could go and be free from her but he chose to support his wife and freedom for Burma. ""Mikey is an indulgent husband"". I am sure he struggled to let her follow her dream but he knew that Burma was counting on her. My heart was moved by several scenes and used nearly half a box of tissues. I felt like a fly on the wall of Aung San Suu Kyi's house, from the vivid details of each set and the honest emotions the actors portrayed.

One of my favorite scenes is when Suu Kyi invites the guard to come in to see the quotes on the wall of her house. She spoke with compassion and love to her enemy, the soldiers that guarded her while being imprisoned in her home. I could see the respect and admiration that the soldiers held for her. It was rewarding to see how love and peace destroyed fear.

 Before watching this movie, I already knew the history and the political and economical turmoil that occurred in Burma. I didn't need to know a lot of detail to understand why she was motivated to lead her country because her father General Aung San taught her about democracy and what the world should be like. This vision stayed with her as she grew up and she also saw the cruelty that was occurring against her people. Hopefully this movie will provoke people to learn more about Burma and why this country has struggled for many decades. I know it has provoked me to do more research and increased my desire to go to Burma as soon as possible.

 I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in seeing a beautiful leader that IS PEACE and LOVE wherever she goes. Aung San Suu Kyi is someone I would like to emulate in my own life and daily living. Hope and freedom were the fruit of sacrifice and diligence. I hope to meet her one day and witness her kindness and beauty.",1392854400,,3014,4.411870503597123

4984273,5,B006E04D1C,"I have long admired Aung San Suu Kyi. She is a woman of unbending will, who firmly believes in the good of people and the power of compassion over violence. She has endured a long battle for the freedom of the Burmese that is still not concluded. This battle has cost her so much of her life. She wasn't there for her sons, husband, or close friends. She gave all of herself to continue the work her father began. The national  hero Aung San freed his people from the imperial rule of both Britain and Japan. He tried to bring democracy to Burma and was assassinated for his efforts when Suu was but a child. So, when I heard that Luc Besson planned on making a film about the great lady Suu Kyi, I was afraid that it would cheapen her imagine and take away from her work. When I found out that Michelle Yeoh was going to play Aung San Suu Kyi, I thought this was a good thing, but still had reservations. I finally sat down to watch The Lady, and besides a few minor things, I found the film wonderfully done and a great tool to introduce those unfamiliar with the struggle of Aung San Suu Kyi and her people.

 The film is told through the viewpoints of both Aung San Suu Kyi, as portrayed by Michelle Yeoh, and her husband Michael Aris, played by David Thewlis, or as many know him, Remus Lupin. Since the two spent so much time apart, yet struggled for the same cause, these two viewpoints make perfect sense. However, that did not stop some ignorant individuals from voicing their suspicions concerning the film being white washed. My only response is that Michael Aris was important enough to Aung San Suu Kyi that she married him, so including him in her story seems more like honoring her than trying to get white people undeserved credit. So, what the viewer sees is Suu Kyi under house arrest and struggling to find ways to protect her people while trying to talk to the government. On the English side of things, you see Michael Aris and his brother Anthony Aris, also played by David Thewlis, trying to find ways to support her and bring international attention to her fight.

 I won't go into a detailed synopsis of the plot, as that is more of the historical narrative, which the film follows faithfully. Instead, I will speak on the performances delivered, which were amazing. David Thewlis plays both brothers Aris and makes it difficult to tell that he is the same actor when both are on the screen. He painfully captures Michaels slow collapse from cancer, slowly becoming more sick and more tired, as if the struggle to save Burma and his wife ends up physically destroying him. Such might have been the case. Michelle Yeoh truly becomes Aung San Suu Kyi and not just in appearance. I have watched many hours of Aung San Suu Kyi speaking and found it more than just uncanny how well Michelle Yeoh portrayed her. The slight way she walks, or raises her hand. The rhythm of her voice and stern but compassionate facial expressions, all of them Yeoh was able to reproduce. Yeoh also learned Burmese to be able to deliver Suu Kyis famous speeches in her native language. I was most moved during the scene that shows Suu Kyi facing off with a wall of rifle toting soldiers threatening to shoot her and her followers. She faces them down with the calm resolution of the Buddha facing down the rampaging elephant. Her break down when learning of Michaels death was heart wrenching. Yes, Michelle Yeoh and David Thewlis carried this film.

 The set should be commended as well. The production team recreated Suu Kyis childhood home, the one she was placed in house arrest in perfectly. Much of the filming was done in Thailand, as they were not allowed to film in Burma at all. Though that didn't stop them. Luc Besson and his team of camera persons went to Burma and filmed several locations, guerilla style, some were even arrested. These scenes are weaved into the film seamlessly. They also did their best to make use of the large population of Burmese refugees living in Thailand, many of whom are Suu Kyi supporters. They helped bring to life an accurate recounting of pivotal moments in Suu Kyis struggle, like her speeches and visiting villages outside of Rangoon.

 My only complaint was the music, but not even all the music. I found some of the score, provided by Eric Serra, to be a bit too The King and I. What I mean by this is that he tried to incorporate generic Asian melodies into what he wrote. Instead of utilizing traditional Burmese melodies he turned to what sounded like over used Chinese melodies, the kind Hollywood always turns to when they make an Asian themed film. For other parts of the film he did just fine, but those few instances really spoiled the moment. There were other times when classical pieces were used, and used very well. For the most part the music was fine, but the end of the film was ruined by the musical choices of Luc Besson.

 There were two songs near the end that really affected the impact of the film. One was a tune that sounded like U2, or a wannabe cover band, that made the ending feel like a motivational commercial rather then a major period of Burmas history that began the changes in the countrys fate. This cheap tune was played during the proytral of the army of monks who marched to Suu Kyis house and demanded the government end her house arrest. The other was the song that played during the credits. It was Sades Solider of Love. Now, I am not going to say anything bad about the song. I am a big fan of Sade, though more her early work, and the song is still fun and an ok tune to listen to. However, it doesnt fit the character of Aung San Suu Kyi or the character of film. Luc Besson, whether he is aware of it or not, under minded his entire film by adding that song. Why? Well, it broke the magic, it reminded people that they were watching a movie, reducing the story of a peoples struggle for freedom, to date night.

 All in all, I really enjoyed this film. I was grateful that someone wanted to use time and money to make such a film. Aung San Suu Kyi asked the world once to use their liberty to promote the liberty of the Burmese people and making such a film is doing just that. I was glad to learn that Michelle Yeoh truly cares about this topic and the Nobel Peace Prize recipient that this film was more than a career move, but a labor of love. I highly recommend taking the time to watch this film and learn about one of humanities greatest examples of compassion and liberty, The Lady Aung San Suu Kyi.",1382054400,,6502,4.449202350965575

4984302,5,B006E04D1C,"What a truly admirable person!  San Suu Kyi definitely deserves to be compared to the courageous peace advocates such as Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mandela.  At great personal sacrifice, she returned to Burma knowing that she was facing hostile, military opposition.  Her many years under house arrest without the ability to even speak to her husband and children in the face of possible murder shows her true faith in her convictions.  Few today, even give thought to doing something on behalf of their fellow citizens without at least a day in the media and an award in it for them.

Those who criticize this as a romance really miss the mark and the essence of the movie.  A mother's sacrifice for her country over her most prized things (a loving husband and two great sons) is great.  Ask any woman, who has lost a child!  In fact, though her husband died of cancer, she chose to stay because leaving to be at his side would have prevented her from returning to Myanmar.  Mike (Suu's husband) was an academic advocating for freedom on Asian countrymen, which is how they met.  He, too suffered great loneliness and separation from her house arrest being refused a VISA to visit her.  He didn't tell her of the cancer because he wanted her to stay.  This did not diminish the story.  If you want to see a great movie, it doesn't require John Wayne.  There was quite a bit of murder, guns, and blood on the screen to satisfy the testosterone requirements of most men.

My only complaint about this very convincing movie and it is minor, was that the actor, playing the eldest son did not look Asian and Caucasian but rather African and Caucasian.  He had very kinky hair; his skin tone and nose looked more African and likewise he wore a heavy beard, perhaps they were trying to give him a likeness to the father character, but the complexion was to different.  Meanwhile, the younger son definitely had features more appropriate to his heritage.

Additionally, the cinematography was excellent. This terrific movie was well acted.  I was not familiar with any of the actors, with the exception of David Thewlis prior to watching but all were convincing.  I was particularly appreciative of Michelle Yeoh's performance,  she gave us great insight into the mind of San Suu Kyi.  Her nuances were subtle and powerful.  David Thewlis is quite talented as well. It makes me want to read and learn more about this woman, I have long admired and supported via Amnesty International.

In conclusion, the struggles to fight evil political regimes will always require sacrifice, unfortunately, few are willing or courageous enough to take up a fight risking all!",1370044800,,2665,4.7685589519650655

Michelle Yeoh is outstanding (as are the other leads).

As for releases:

My first copy of this was from Canada (featuring French menu, and with a French voice track and subtitles, in addition to the English), but via Hong Kong.  The English subtitles (which remain on screen even when the actors are speaking English) are atrocious.  For that reason, though hesitant because of the price, I bought blu-ray copy of the ""Cohen"" release.  The English subtitles are reworked, so are fine.  And they aren't on screen when the dialog is in English.

So if you enjoy the film, prefer accurate subtitles, and the price isn't too much of an obstacle, go for the ""Cohen"" release.
_____

For those who've seen it, and if they had questions about her conversation with her son Kim while her husband is dying -- her saying, ""try to understand,"" and, ""my hands are tied"" -- this, from her speech, ""Freedom from Fear,"" illuminates, in which she is speaking of ""a-gati"" of Buddhist ethics:

""It is not power that corrupts but fear. Fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are subject to it.  Most Burmese are familiar with the four a-gati, the four kinds of corruption.  Chanda-gati, corruption induced by desire, is deviation from the right path in pursuit of bribes or for the sake of those one loves.  Dosa-gati is taking the wrong path to spite those against whom one bears ill will, and moga-gati is aberration due to ignorance.  But perhaps the worst of the four is bhaya-gati, for not only does bhaya, fear, stifle and slowly destroy all sense of right and wrong, it so often lies at the root of the other three kinds of corruption.  Just as chanda-gati, when not the result of sheer avarice, can be caused by fear of want or fear of losing the goodwill of those one loves, so fear of being surpassed, humiliated or injured in some way can provide the impetus for ill will.  And it would be difficult to dispel ignorance unless there is freedom to pursue the truth unfettered by fear.  With so close a relationship between fear and corruption it is little wonder that in any society where fear is rife corruption in all forms becomes deeply entrenched.""

Specifically:

""Chanda-gati, corruption induced by desire, is deviation from the right path in pursuit of bribes or for the sake of those one loves.""

And: "". . . . chanda-gati, when not the result of sheer avarice, can be caused by fear of want or fear of losing the goodwill of those one loves . . . .""

4984329,4,B006E04D1C,"Despite the flaws in this dramatized biopic of Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi  - far too long at 132 minutes, more emphasis on a family drama than an important change in Burma to Myanmar, etc - this film as written by Rebecca Frayn and directed by Luc Beeson (Taken, Transporter, La Femme Nikita, etc) deserves our attention in that it helps explain the volatile situation that existed in Burma from 1947 to the present. In brief it is the story of Aung San Suu Kyi as she becomes the core of Burma's democracy movement, and her relationship with her husband, Oxford professor and writer Michael Aris.

Opening in 1947 we meet Aung San Suu Kyi as a child bidding farewell to her father, General Aung San, a hero of the Burmese democratic movement, who is then assassinated. Aung San Suu Kyi (Michelle Leoh) escapes to England, matures, marries an Oxford professor Michael (David Thewlis) and has two sons (Jonathan Raggett and Jonathan Woodhouse). The film then jumps to 1988 when, due to the fact that her mother is critically ill, Suu Kyi  returns to Burma to care for her mother; once there she observes the student protests to the military regime headed by a dummy superstitious dictator, and as the heir to her father's fame in the country as a leader of the people she decides to stay and follow the encouragement of the protestors to be their leader. That decision places here in danger and eventual house arrest, and with the love of her husband and children as support she stays the course and becomes the leader of the democratic movement of the country now called Myanmar. The commitment to her cause by her husband (who discovers in Suu Kyi's absence that he has prostate cancer and a limited life span) offers her strength and she gains world attention when she is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.

THE LADY is more an epic love story about how an extraordinary couple and family sacrifice their happiness at great human cost for a higher cause than it is a full study of the persona of Aung San Suu Kyi Much is missing, especially the period in Burma from 1947 to 1988, and the maturing of Suu Kyi into a hero. But the film does emphasize the peaceful quest of the woman who is at the core of Burma's democracy movement and the indomitable love relationship and strength of marriage and family due to their undying support of her mission. Michelle Yeoh and David Thewlis are excellent and the film has touches of beauty that are memorable (as Suu Kyi listens on a portable radio to the Nobel Prize speech read by her son the music that is so much a part of Suu Kyi's life is her playing of the Pachelbel Canon accompanied by a small orchestra over a distance of thousands of miles). It is a touching tribute to a great lady of peace.  Grady Hap, March 13",1362873600,,2785,4.52882703777336

4984336,5,B006E04D1C,"In this excellent Anglo-French production, director Luc Besson has chosen to tell the story of Aung San Suu Kyi through the experience of her marriage to Oxford academic Michael Aris (an intelligent and sensitive performance by David Thewlis). The film explores the heartache of a family life characterised by long separations due to Suus choice to commit her life first and foremost to democracy and civil rights in her native Burma, and the resultant choices and sacrifices which both agree to endure for the cause.

What might in the hands of a less skilled director have turned into a political polemic, or worse, a worthy but uninvolving biopic, has become under Bessons skilled direction a truly great film with a strong storyline and real emotional power. The action see-saws between Suus struggles against the regime in Burma and Michaels safe, suburban academic life in Oxford, highlighting his unquestioning support for her decision even though it means she is absent from her children growing through adolescence, and of course from him. Whilst stopping short of doing Suu actual harm because her high public profile would bring down the outrage of the international community, the military regime in Burma does everything possible to make her leave Burma voluntarily  but she refuses to go, knowing that if she were to leave, new laws would be framed by the regime to ensure she would never be allowed back and she could be far less effective outside the country.

The audience is not spared graphic images of the horrors perpetrated by the Burmese regime. The violence however is in no way gratuitous, but essential to the action and to the story. The less well-known struggles of Michael in the background  bringing up the teenage boys on his own, lobbying for his wife to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to attract international news coverage & so add a layer of protection for her, missing her but uncomplaining  are well portrayed by Thewlis, whose performance is noble, intelligent and understated, and capped off by his brief cameos as Michaels identical-twin brother.

Michelle Yeoh remains the shining star of the film. Her portrayal of Aung San Suu Kyi runs the full gamut of the emotional spectrum while remaining noble and dignified in the face of ever-mounting indignities. She also learned Burmese (!) for the role, delivering Suus public speeches in front of large crowds in the Burmese language with utter conviction. You will believe absolutely that Yeoh is Aung San Suu Kyi, clearly understanding the difficult choices she made and their consequences.

The film would be worth five stars just for Yeohs stellar performance, but in fact The Lady is a finely crafted and emotionally involving film with no weak performances. Recommended.",1360281600,,2766,5.065934065934066

It is a nice tribute to a great woman, so I plan on watching it with my daughter when she is old enough.  Girls need more role models like this.

4984349,4,B006E04D1C,"Michelle acted as the Lady very well. Most of the movies that is based on a real story when they reveal the main character in real life they are somewhat different from the movie. But this one is very close to the real one.

I am very impressed with her professionalism. She also learned Burma for the public speaches. But, if you are looking for some exciting plots in the movie you will be disappointed, remember the Lady has been house rested for over a decade. But, you will appreciate the courage, the determination and the persistence shown by the movie. I enjoyed it very much",1356739200,,583,4.5
4984350,5,B006E04D1C,"Michelle Yeoh's portrayal of Aung San Suu Kyi is impressive as is of course Aung San Suu Kyi only a thousand times  over.  My wife and I thought this was a documentary which we enjoy but were in the mood for a movie.  Long story short, we were told of this film by a chance encounter with a Buddist monk from Burma earlier in the day.

The movie is appealing on may levels and I think successfully so.

Minor spoiler alert:
Aung San Suu Kyi's fight for democracy continues today but now as a sitting member of Burma's government as opposed to decades under house arrest (by the military hunta) after being elected the country's President.  Her election to parliament happened after this film was finished.  She was freed by the  same military that not only arrested her but who had assassinated her father decades earlier as he was - as a young general - leading Burma into democracy. See the movie, then read her story.  Unforgettable.",1356134400,,1364,4.761702127659574

The only drawback with the movie is that it can be a little drawn out and I wish they had some updates such as that Aung San Suu Kyi was recently voted into the Myanmar congress.

4984357,4,B006E04D1C,"When you watch the Making of The Lady featurette included with this DVD, you realize that this was Michelle Yeoh's project, and her focus was on the love story between Aung Sun Suu Kyi, her husband Michael and their two sons.  She succeeds in painting a tear-inducing portrayal of the powerful bonds holding Suu's family together, but we are left scratching our heads over her decision to stay in Burma during her husband's terminal illness, with the hindsight of history, knowing that it has taken another 14 years sine Michael Aris's passing for the junta in Burma to finally permit true democratic elections and seat Suu as a member of the national parliament - but not as the leader of a democratic nation.  The focus, overall, is really just on Suu, while we get painfully little about who else in the political opposition from academia, the military or the Karen rebellion have been working to bring change to Burma.  We do get a clear picture of the cold blooded violence of the junta and there is some lush cinematography of Rangoon and the Burmese countryside, which director Luc Besson tells us in the featurette he and two cameramen were able to surreptitiously obtain while posing as mere tourists with handheld digital cameras on a visit to Burma - apparently the military junta was unaware of who Besson was and what project he was working on.

One comes away from this film knowing more about the courageous Lady who has sacrificed so much to try to bring her nation into the democratic fold of the modern world and who has stood as the symbol of hope for her nation.  When you realize how few of us are truly willing to make such a dangerous stand - and she knew just how treacherous this was, having had her father brutally assassinated in the aftermath of leading a successful campaign for Burma's independence - a Nobel Peace Prize is the least of the honors that could be accorded her.  This film honors her request to ""please use your liberty to help us gain ours.""",1353196800,,1986,4.643874643874644
