2314467,5,B0009S2K9W,"After a long search, I finally found the vaulted footage of Marilyn Monroe's unfinished film. It was worth the wait. The film follows the original version (Irene Dunne and Cary Grant-1940) faithfully, so the story is familiar to viewers who know the story line of ""My Favorite Wife.""

This version never really gets to the end, however. Instead, after 35 minutes, this film has its own touching ending, and we all know what comes next for Monroe.

This movie needed to come out of the vault. It is a must have for Monroe fans, and for viewers who appreciate multiple movie versions of the same story. In this case, it's a great job of editing the material that was available into a cohesive story.  Additional plus: the film comes after a good deal of footage/ commentary about what was happening in Monroe's life at the time, so there is a some context that makes watching the movie at the end wortwhile.",1168300800,9,905,4.608695652173913

The resurrected footage of her final film appears very corny by today's standards. It's hard to believe the public bought this awful stuff not that long ago. Neither Monroe, nor her cos-star, Dean Martin, could ever get away with acting this lame today. But they must be judged by the standards of their day, I guess. You can imagine the parallels with today's starlets like Lindsey Lohan, perhaps.",1240617600,,573,4.917525773195877

2314495,5,B0009S2K9W,"This product is pieced together from raw/restored footage, out-takes and the ending partial film is sprite, interesting and Monroe's powerful luminous presence is riveting and ethereal.
The commentary unfortunately  tends to favor the negative side of the studio issues playing out. They fail to mention or down play that Monroe was the #1 female box office star of the past decade, that her films were  keeping 20th Century Fox above water for the past several years and they were paying her approximately 200K due to a loop hole in her early contract. Yet Cleopatra was literally bankrupting Fox after almost 2 years in production and Taylor was receiving 1M for her film. This was the last film under Monroe's old contract, and it was a flimsy B film that she didn't want to do. Fox expected Monroe to complete & release the hit quickly, thus it would help finance the ballooning Cleopatra and the sinking Fox. Monroe resented these facts, the film and didn't want to make it, who could blame her? So she was ""sick & tardy"", they fired her, she made history again at Madison Square Garden (Happy Birthday Mr. President), her legal team countered, Dean Martin quit (he refused to work with anyone but Monroe as his contract stated), Fox quickly rehired her with a large raise...Dumb like a Fox.
It's of note to watch her out-takes when she sees her children for the first time in 5 years, her eyes reveal a range as large as the Alps that take you on a journey in seconds - many shades of pathos, yearning and love.
In film class at Yale they devoted a whole class to Marilyn, showing a series of clips with a multitude of famous dignitaries with her: Presidents, Queens, Kings, actors, opera stars, famous scholars, etc. and at the end the professor asked us to name any of the 17 dignitaries with Monroe, we could name only 4. Such is the power of her luminous presence. Monroe's flesh impact owns the screen like no other - even when someone else is talking your still watching her.
Was she the best actor, dancer or singer? No...then again she obviously didn't have to be.
Since her passing it's safe to say they'll be no one at this level of screen presence, close but sans the flesh impact that only she can deliver. They'll still be watching her 1500 years from now.",1210636800,8,2275,4.614814814814815

2314500,5,B0009S2K9W,"Marilyn Monroe: the Final Days (2001)

directed by Patty Ivins Specht

This is a documentary on the production of 'SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE', the unfinished film starring Marilyn Monroe, Dean Martin and Cyd Charisse.  This movie was a remake of the 1940 film 'MY FAVORITE WIFE' which starred Cary Grant and Irene Dunne.  The movie itself has a pretty funny story where a man believes that his first wife has died or disappeared so he gets remarried.  When it turns out wife #1 is still around and comes back into his life, there are lots of awkward social situations.

By this time in her career, Marilyn was known for being extremely late to the set and also for demanding a lot of creative control over her characters- two things most directors won't put up with.  This was especially true of George Cukor, the famous RKO director who was slated to direct Marilyn's movie because he owed the studio a favor.  Marilyn's tardiness was a huge problem on 'SOMETHINGS GOT TO GIVE'- the only thing worse than her being late was when she didn't show up at all!  But what was wrong with Marilyn at this time in her life?  Several people are interviewed including her personal physician and some of her closest friends.  The consensus seems to be that she felt nobody took her seriously as a actress.  She was under the wing of dramatic acting coach Paula Strasberg and had attended husband Lee's prestigious ""Actor's Studio"" in efforts to flourish as a real talent.  But she also became ill and was advised by not one but two physicians postpone production on her latest film.  The studio was already way behind schedule and would lose a tremendous amount of money if the doctors' advice was followed.  This escalated tensions between Cukor, Monroe and the film crew.  When Marilyn was on the set, everyone loved the results, including the highly publicized swimming pool scene.  But since the director never knew when Marilyn would show up, he had to ""shoot around"" her- meaning he shot every scene in the movie that she wasn't in.  After these scenes were through, there was nothing left for Cukor to do.  When Marilyn made her famous appearance at President Kennedy's b-day gala, Cukor was understandably angry.  To her credit, Marilyn had told the studio about the gala before production on the movie had started, and if it were an isolated incident it could've been written off as a big misunderstanding.  Unfortunately this was just one of many problems between the director and the starlet.  Eventually Marilyn was fired (and replaced) which was no doubt devastating for her insecurities.  She decided to pull herself together and generate positive publicity for herself.  A sympathetic article featuring her side of the story and  new photographs was published and this probably ""humanized"" her to the fans.  The positive publicity must've worked because the studio negotiated to re-hire her and resume shooting on the movie.  Tragically, Marilyn died of a drug overdose before the production started back up.  'SOMETHINGS GOT TO GIVE' was scrapped and a new version called 'MOVE OVER DARLING' was made in 1963 with Doris Day and James Garner in the lead roles.

Marilyn's early death has been discussed many times before.  There is no question that she had a lifelong battle with depression and was using far too many pills.  Her miscarriage and failed high profile marriages were also all over the papers which has to be extremely hard to deal with.  But her life did seem to be back on track around the time of her passing.  Does this mean she didn't kill herself?  It is impossible to know and frankly I'm glad this movie doesn't focus too much on the issue.  You will hear the opinions of people who knew her, including some of the last people to see her.  But you will not hear any of the ""toxic enema"" theories or Kennedy-mafia secrets here- this movie is more memorial than speculation.

The last part of this documentary is an attempted reconstruction of 'SOMETHINGS GOT TO GIVE' using the existing footage and notes from the directors, producers, etc.  This cut runs a little under 40 minutes.  The movie is sort of strange to watch, especially after viewing the ""making of"" right before.  Not to mention that Marilyn only showed up for about half the days of shooting.  Watching the movie, you don't always think of the story or the characters being shown- you think of Marilyn and what she (and her peers) were going through.  Its a melacholy moment where you can't really suspend disbelief enough to forget the story of the person who more than anyone has come to embody ""tragic beauty"".

Very well made and full of exclusive material.  Essential for fans of Marilyn or 1960s Hollywood.",1173139200,10,4700,4.79228855721393

8065733,5,B0009S2K9W,"Much had been written about this aborted production Something's Got to Give, and snippets of film had appeared in various documentaries.  I recall first seeing a few clips in a 1963 Fox documentary narrated by Rock Hudson, and remember being riveted by how Monroe looked.  As film historians began unearthing more and more footage, and techniques to restore faded film stock improved, this documentary is the result of some painstaking restoration work, as well as containing interviews with key players.

As many have stated, Monroe looked better than she had in years, she was coiffed and dressed attractively, she was slim and lithe, was lit carefully, and seemed to glow.  This was a 1960s Monroe who teases viewer with what could have been.  The role was light comedy but was quite different than other roles she had played, especially when you realize that Irene Dunne had played role in original movie.  It may have transitioned her to more nuanced parts.  She does seem maddeningly inconsistent as production proceeds, focused one moment, lost the next.  She does not seem to have the patented Monroe magic and then suddenly, in brief scene where she is masquerading as Swedish nanny, there it is, that thing only she could do.

The reconstructed film at end of documentary is amazing piece of work, making the most of available footage.  You realize what pros Dean Martin and Cyd Charisse were.  It's interesting to compare to Mover Over Darling, the Doris Day movie that was finally filmed of this remake.  That movie was a hit, and you have to wonder whether the Monroe/Martin version would have done as well.

As a record of an uncompleted film, this documentary is highly recommended.",1398816000,,1697,4.933098591549296
8065734,5,B0009S2K9W,"I have been a huge fan of Marilyn for many, many years now and can say without a doubt, this is one of the best dvds out there recounting the last days of her life. The focus is mainly on the year 1962 and what she did in her last picture, ""Something's Got To Give"", which was never fully completed. This documentary follows Marilyn on the set and has many people that were involved in the making of this movie talking about it. They talk about the ""ups and downs"" of making the picture and working with an Icon personality such as Marilyn.
You get to see Marilyn herself working ""feverishly"" (and I used that term literally) on the set trying to appease anyone and everyone around her. She comes to the set late many times and probably causes the film to be behind schedule for many days at a time, all the while being physically sick.
Marilyn tried so hard on this picture, but we all know behind the scenes she was dealing with personal problems that did effect her on screen. She even overdosed on pills once while in the making of the film early on and the producer had to tell the ""makers"" of the film ""She is not ready to do this picture"".
They wouldn't listen and made her appear anyway when she was physically able to do so. She nearly made up for all lost time and mentality against her with the announcement that she was going to do a ""nude scene"" for the movie. A first for a major motion picture star, or so they thought.
 (Although here is a side note...Hedy Lamarr in her first motion picture did a complete full frontal nude scene early in her career, it was a black and white picture entitled ""ECSTASY"".)
After days of frolicking in the pool and playing with a defiant dog that wouldn't bark on que, she was eventually fired for not coming to the set and causing undue delays in the production.
What Fox didn't know or wouldn't admit was that by firing Marilyn, they had actually cut off their own ""cash flow"" source. They tried desperately to get other actresses to fill the shoes of Marilyn, even getting Lee Remick to try and come on board. No dice, said Dean Martin, who signed the contract early on in the picture that stipulated, NO MARILYN, NO PICTURE.
That was that. The movie was shut down altogether. Marilyn on her own time, sent telegrams to the other cast members asking them if they were willing to come back to the movie if things could be worked out. They all seemed to agree on that. Marilyn did get her attorneys to get her contract reworked at Fox, got them to hire her back and a new $1,000,000 2 picture deal at the same time. (Although the contract was never really signed in ink from Marilyn.)
So, things seemed to be looking up for Marilynl. Sadly though, on August 5, 1962, Marilyn was ""discovered"" dead of an apparent overdose of sleeping pills and other drugs at her Brentwood home in Ca. Her official funeral would be held on August 8th, 1962.
A tragedy had come and soon everyone knew we had lost MARILYN for good.
On this dvd, there is a 37 minute ""mini movie"" of SGTG completely reconstructed in a way as to preserve the integrity of the movie.

You also get on the IMAGE Entertainment version the following special features:

Marilyn as a Blue Book Model at the Ambassador Hotel - 1943
Marilyn as a Blue Book Model at the Ambassador Hotel - 1948

""Move Over, Darling"" Theatrical Trailer.

FOX CINEMA CLASSICS EDITION (2006): You only get the documentary and Fox Movietone News: CinemaScope Clip. There is NO still gallery although it is labeled on back as such. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT VERSION DVD of this with extras.

 There also is a 1990 SGTG documentary out there on VHS that is very good as well, but as of this writing, it is not available on dvd or bluray.  It is a rare one to get, but I have seen it on you tube, so at least, if you have not seen that, you can there. I miss Marilyn very much, and wish she were alive with us all, but as long as we keep her in our hearts and minds, she will live on with us for decades to come. She left us with her many movies, photographs, and songs to enjoy.",1395360000,,4092,4.362204724409449
8065735,5,B0009S2K9W,"In my opinion the DVD ""Marilyn Monroe : The Final Days"" is a priceless edition. The DVD includes Monroe's final unfinished film ""Something's Got To Give"". I'm really enjoyed this light comedy. It was 1962 and at that time Marilyn Monroe still was good looking, so cute and fascinating.
Also DVD includes interviews with co-stars of ""Something's Got To Give"" Cyd Charisse and Dean Martin; rare footage and stills of Marilyn behind the scenes of her final film and many other features.
A most impressive feature of ""Marilyn Monroe : The Final Days"" (on my mind) is Marilyn Monroe as a Blue Book Model - 1948. At that  young age she looks fabulous.",1372291200,,645,4.707964601769912

Several weeks later, they quitely resigned their leading Superstar to a multi-film pact with a dramatic increase in pay from what Monroe had been receiving from a outdated fifties contract, this made her very, very happy, now wanting the world to know about this conquest & other tumultuous events in her life, Marilyn requested of her press secretary scheduling the following Monday a media press conference, this was not to be as her life was taken that weekend and mystery surrounding how this happened remains to this day, hardcore fans feel the cover-up continues with this propaganda filled release, insisting she took her own life throughout ""The Final Days"" becomes very irritating and not for a moment convincing, ultimately this visually appealing documentry is interesting only for having a chance to view the making of what would have been another extraordinary Marilyn film classic...gone too soon to be sure. Looking radiant in every sumptuous frame and totally commanding in every scene, never did Marilyn look more gorgeous & beautiful on The Silver Screen, making ""The Final Days"" a must-have to view Marilyn Monroe in fine & glorious form, clearly ready to take position in the fabulous sixties as leading drop-dead gorgeous Diva of the Silver Screen...RIP beautiful lady, you are loved and missed by so many!",1343606400,2,1863,5.131578947368421

then the members of the film crew come in : "" Thank You !! "" ...

another take from the film 'Something's Got to Give' had finished.
this was the very last one would see of Marilyn Monroe on the white screen.

if one has a look at the documentary ""Marilyn Monroe - the Final Days"" with the reconstructed short version of the movie 'Something's Got to Give' added, directed by George Cukor, featuring Marilyn Monroe, Dean Martin and Cyd Charisse,
one is fully left with the question : 'what is it that happened to Marilyn Monroe' ?

she did a wonderful job on the scene, her 'method acting' coming to full quality, yet ...
the first 30 days of filming were troublesome to say the least.
Monroe was abscent from the film set on 17 of those 30 days. due to this the working on the film went easily 10 days behind schedule, and this had costed an additional 1 million dollars ...

people at 20th. Century Fox Studios had become alarmed, afraid, hopeless, and furious. how on earth could Marilyn Monroe had let the film crew down like this ? ...

the enormous losses resulted during the making of the movie 'Cleopatra' had lamed Fox Industries, which was now facing serious financial debt.
in the process whole departments had been shut down by Fox, and this movie 'Something's Got to Give' should have become the turning point, especially because Marilyn Monroe was in it.
this movie should have raised the box office numbers again, work on the movie started april 23, while release was planned for october 1962.

finally though the movie would be released in december 1963 under a different title, 'Move Over, Darling', and with different actors ... Doris Day, James Garner, and Polly Bergen.
by then Marilyn Monroe was already dead for over a year, and America was in a state of shock once more, after their President John Fitzgerald Kennedy was assasinated in Texas in november 1963.

was it the intention of Marilyn Monroe to let the film crew go down ?
not for a minute do I believe this to be the case. Marilyn Monroe was reknowned for being difficult to handle. she was mostly late on every appointment, which worked on the nerves of Clark Gable during the making of the film 'The Misfits' (1961), director John Huston there even brought filming temporarily to a halt, bringing Monroe to a hospital in order to have her detoxicate, as she was on drinks and narcotics. nevertheless the film, once finished, was a highly good production.
and now co-starring actor Dean Martin got so upset after another abscense of Marilyn Monroe on the set, that he walked away in despair. but Marilyn Monroe was herself the purification of a top quality actress, she was also reknowned to be the star with the democratic accessability of a normal human being, highly sensitive, friendly towards anyone on the filmset, even when in private she spoke about Monroe in the third person with playwriter Walter Bernstein stating at once : 'oh no, that is not what Monroe would do here'. why ? let it be said that Monroe had her ideas about the script, and it simply needed to suit what she stood for.
Dean Martin also had his choices if Monroe would become replaced by Fox, he simply would refuse to go ahead himself : ' if Monroe has to go, I go too ' ...

but one can not deny the fact that Marilyn Monroe was in deep personal trouble.

during one of her abscenses from the set she was found at home by producer Henry Weinstein, she was found lying on her bed, overdosed and subsequently taken care of.
as a result of all this it was decided an extra key of her home would be hidden in a segovia plant at her door, so anyone could have access to her home, in case an emergency rescue would need to take place.

weeks later associate producer Gene Allen began to loose his patience, and director George Cukor became very disenchanted with it all, and certainly also with Paula Strasberg, Monroe's acting couch, who in fact acted like a second director, asking several takes to resume.
let me remind you that director Joshua Logan refused to have Paula Strasberg on the filmset during the making of the movie 'Bus Stop' featuring Monroe, that was in 1956.

anyway, the directory of Fox had to make decisions.

then Monroe returned to the set, on june 1 a lovely Birthday celebration was held for her, the swimming pool scene had rounded of to be a succes as well. ironically a while later some of the stills photos of Monroe being half naked aside the swimming pool would blow of Liz Taylor from any front cover of any magazine in no time.
Monroe predicted the photos would become a succes, and indeed all magazines in the States had Monroe on the front cover as such. work on 'Something's Got to Give' was given new life.

but Weinstein finally couldn't figure out anymore what was going wrong with the star, because right after this nice take the mood had changed to grim again, with Monroe again showing no sign of life in the days following the happiness which was clearly found to be on the filmset.

Monroe would appear to be in a constant different change of mood. one moment she was brilliantly doing fine, the other moment she would be found depressed.
even more dangerous is the fact that a whole range of chemical products were at her disposal, both on the table beside her bed, apart from a large inventory of products to be found in her bathroom.

when it comes to all of these products which were to her availability, her personal physical Doctor, Dr. Hyman Engelberg, pointed out that Monroe later would be found dead with a high dosis of the tranquiliser Chloral Hydrate in her system as well, besides the lethally high concentration of Nembutal sleeping tablets.
Engelberg had never prescribed Chloral Hydrate to her according to his statement in the documentary.
he feels she must have found this material when she was briefly visiting Mexico. some years ago a re-study on the autopsy report by Dr. Cozzi made it clear that the amount of Chloral Hydrate found in her system not necessarily must have been lethal, but the dosis of Nembutal was. Donald Spoto would write in his biography on Marilyn Monroe that on july 25 of 1962 Monroe would have received a prescription for an unknown quantity of Nembutal sleeping tablets by the Studio Doctor Lei Seigel.
so obviously Dr. Hyman Engelberg was not the only one to have prescibed drugs to her, the way he himself prescribed a dosis of 25 tablets of Nembutal on august 3 of 1962, one day before her untimely death. in itself there was nothing wrong in prescribing the Nembutal. it was done while she was in fact weaning of from these products, and in order to fight the effects of weaning of, she was allowed to use one before going to sleep. according to the history these sleeping tablets came into play as Marilyn Monroe found extraordinary trouble in order to gain sleep, suffering from a sincere insomnia.

but there is no doubt in my mind either that a range of private matters have caused Monroe to become deeply depressed.

it is mentioned by her stand-in on the filmset Evelyn Moriarty how she felt that the scene where Monroe plays with the two kids must have reminded her about the fact that these kids easiily could have been hers, if not two miscarriages had happened in life.
her marriage with playwriter Arthur Miller had finished, Miller and his newly married wife Inge Morath were expecting a baby, exactly this was left unfulfilled due to a miscarriage during the relationship Monroe had with Miller.
there was the fact that she had come close to Robert Kennedy as a friend, but now she felt sincerely left abandoned by the Attorney General. as researchers strongly suggest, this may well have caused a serious argument going on between Robert Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe on the afternoon of august 4 of 1962, the last day of her life.
when then Dr. Ralph Greenson was asked by Monroe to visit her, he found her 'somewhat drugged', leading to the thesis that Monroe may well have taken some of the Chloral Hydrate after the discussion with Robert Kennedy had come to an end, in order to calm herself down.

and subsequently also Fox made life hard on her, let's be honoust.
Marilyn Monroe was found to be ill, but it seems she had to swallow the blame of the 'runaway production' of the movie 'Cleopatra' on top of it.
however when Marilyn did appear on stage, she was doing extremely well as one could expect from the highly ranked actress.
the medical doctor of Fox had suggested the start on the production of the movie to be postponed by one month, following a clear diagnosis of Monroe having caught a virus, a chronical sinusitis, later on a cold. Fox declined, so Monroe stayed away from the set, no surprise.
Weinstein had opted to postpone production on the movie when he found Monroe lying on her bed at home, explaining that at this very moment she wasn't ready to do the job properly, but Fox once more had declined.

when Dean Martin caught a cold, she refused to work with him for a few days, being afraid she would contract it from him.
Monroe showed signs of fatigue, asked specifically to director George Cukor not to film any close ups of her.

I regard it a sheer total nonsense that work on the film was only temporarily good because Monroe was shining during the shooting of the swimming pool scene, and a few other shots, as some of the production members would like to have it. I suggest people have a look for themselves, Monroe was firmly acting deliciously, for many years Fox had shelved the images of the movie, but they are now available to the audience in the disc which comprises the documentary concerning the difficulties which had surrounded the making of the film, as well as the shortfilm which it finally had become because of the unexpected death of Marilyn Monroe.

when on may 19, which was after all contractually agreed with Fox, Marilyn Monroe took a few days of leave to head for New York as she was invited amongst so many other guests like Opera Diva Maria Callas to be present at the Birthday Gala of John Kennedy,
executive producer Peter Levathes initially refused to let her go, since the filming on 'Something's Got to Give' was in serious trouble, he wanted work to commence. Monroe did however leave for New York as was first agreed with her employer.
the mixture of all of these troubles accumulating made Fox decide to finally fire actress Marilyn Monroe ... this would have meant that her career was as good as over, finished, and she would not find any work anymore in this town.

this came as a shock to Marilyn.

later she would tell Richard Merymen from Life Magazine in her final interview : "" I wish they had to act a comedy with a temperature and a virus "" - "" this Industry should behave like a mother whose child has just run out in front of a car. But instead of clasping the child to them, they start punishing the child. ""

her personal psychiatrist Dr. Ralph Greenson then started negotiating with Fox Industries to keep them from firing the movie star.
also the leading man from the Fox Industry, Darryl Francis Zanuck, stood up against the decision to fire Monroe. finally it was agreed that work on 'Something's Got to Give' was to be resumed with her as the leading actress.
albeit that it must be said Monroe's lawyer Mickey Rudin was afraid Monroe would never be able to live up to this new agreement, as he feared she would be mentally too weak to resume.

it is my sincere opinion that if Marilyn Monroe would have been able to finish this product, 'Something's Got to Give' would have been a wonderful achievement by all means.

8065740,4,B0009S2K9W,"On a certain level, the vehicle was crap, but Marilyn clearly transcended the material.  Her haunted beauty is, as another reviewer noted, ethereal. I was not even born when she died, but as someone with interests in feminist thought, World War II, Cold War fears and paranoia (by today's standards) and all things Kennedy (not to say I love them--there is much to despise) this is a must have.

Certainly this pic skewers the myth of a performer incapable of delivering the goods.  A version of this semi-documentary surfaced on Fox TV in the late 80's or early 90's and I still have it on VCR tape somewhere.  My memory is it was much heavier handed in it's thesis that Marilyn was gigged partially as repayment for prior scores, the excesses of stars at the time (which she herself contributed to in the mid 50's with her walkout on Fox and the amazing contract she negotiated for herself at that time) and a need to portray her as completely unbalanced.  The prior version of this film has extensive commentary by Harvey Weinstein, who in 1962 was a newbie and in charge of trying to hold Marilyn and this teetering production together.  The footage of the prior version of this semi-documentary is faded and has, I believe, different takes of the same scenes for at least some of the footage.  It is interesting to notice the subtle nuances, shadings of differences between takes.  Actually, I find this film hard to watch.  While she gives a solid performance, the subtext of her personal tragedies seems so painfully evident.

Had Marilyn finished this film, I suspect it would have been a modest commercial hit or perhaps ""broke even,"" but been the turning point for her career.  And not in a good way.  Her living contemporaries found themselves without an audience as the times changed.  Elvis, Jayne, and the scores of Marilyn knockoffs found themselves drifting, nearly irrelevant and ""a joke.""  In a sense, her death may have been a blessing compared to becoming the joke she always feared herself to be.  Gloria Steinem's collection of essays is strongly recommended as a companion piece to this film, as it explores her life in the context of the (and her) troubled times.  Her poignant blitz to get rehired for this role gives insights into her thinking and her limitless fears of being a living punchline.

It is interesting to speculate what would have happened had she lived.  Recently declassified documents indicate that the Brothers Kennedy had quite a problem on their hands, with Marilyn feeling used at their hands.  Further, had JFK returned from Dallas alive, congressional investigation awaited, as his sexual dalliances with an East German spy (and scores of other women) were seriously threatening to blow the lid off his presidency.

This ain't for the casual viewer wanting a feel good Marilyn moment.  For those wanting some insight into her life, it is highly recommended.",1277769600,,2906,4.865853658536586
