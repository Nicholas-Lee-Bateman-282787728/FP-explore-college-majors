4229032,1,B003YGC7JY,"They sure got the name right cause you have to be a knucklehead to see this movie. It's nothing more then fart jokes,fat jokes & all the predictable jokes in between. It's equally moronic as ""Jackass"" except without the fun. Nothing will surprise you in this film. It's predictable with a capital ""P"". It's just as bad as Nacho Libre.

4229041,5,B003YGC7JY,This is such a funny movie. But take my advice... pause it before the bus scene and take a potty break. That's how hard you will laugh. I bought it because the Big Show was in it. But I also found the nun to be very funny. And it is appropriate for children! The most they will see is Big Show's underwear in one scene that doesn't last long. That's probably the reason for the PG-13 label.,1391644800,,390,4.077922077922078

4229045,4,B003YGC7JY,"KNUCKLEHEAD

I am a huge wrestling fan and a huge movie fan so when the two come together I am all in. this was a comedy that WWE put together starring The Big Show as your typical man child. With the title that this film has I am sure you know what you are getting into. The best thing about this movie is that it is a family film. My little cuz and I have watched this a few times because she loves it.

Walter Krunk [Big Show] is a full grown orphan is a mess that breaks all things around him, but he has a big heart. When an accident in the kitchen of the orphanage leaves the room burned down they are told they have ten days to fix it or be shut down. Enter Eddie Sullivan [Mark Feuerstein] a fighter manager who is in dept to the wrong people and needs to pay them back. When he finds Walter he takes the giant under his wing so that they can win some fights and hopefully they will both get the money they need.

For the adult watching this it may not be a laugh out loud classic comedy but it is an enjoyable film. As for the kids they will love it, what is better than a big kind hearted giant who is very clumsy. This is a fun movie that actually has some decent fight scenes for a family flick. My cuz in particular loved the bear part, reminds me of the kid flicks from the 90's and such. You know like ""Kindergarten Cop"" and such, it just as that feeling about it.

The Big Show makes for a great lead in this family friendly movie which makes sense given his comedic turns in the WWE. He delivers with his character very well and the physical comedy is well done. Feuerstein is good here as well playing a guy you should hate because of what he is doing but you root for him anyway. Will Patton and Dennis Farina were excellent additions to the film as was Wendie Malick as the head Nun [excellent] and Melora Hardin as well. This isn't the best movie ever but it is a good one especially for family viewing. There are some great special features here like the commentary that Show is actually on.",1358380800,,2013,4.101522842639594
4229046,5,B003YGC7JY,I Love WWE. This is one of the best movies they have done so far. I laughed through most of the movie.,1358294400,,102,3.6818181818181817
4229047,5,B003YGC7JY,I just like paul wite a lot. Big show can do no wrong. Even if he tries to be a bad guy people love him :),1357084800,,106,3.1153846153846154
4229048,5,B003YGC7JY,Just watched this movie. Very cute. I give the Big Show a lot of credit for trying to pull of acting job. Pretty good! nice try.,1335139200,,128,3.9615384615384617
4229049,1,B003YGC7JY,this movie stinks its dumb and stupid amd totally unintelligent this is easily one of the worst movies ever made i use to like the world wrestling federation now its known as wwe aka world wrestling entertainment this movie stinks i hate it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1323993600,,265,5.186046511627907
4229050,4,B003YGC7JY,"No, it's not Shakespeare, but it isn't the worst movie ever, either.  It was fun.  As usual, Will Patton was horribly under-used.",1309305600,,129,4.818181818181818
4229051,5,B003YGC7JY,"When I bought this Dvd I wasn't expecting much . but, I am surprised it was quite funny. The main actor
'Big Show' a WWE wrestler truly showed he has a great since of humor. I am looking forward to seeing this
man again in another film.",1299888000,,236,4.042553191489362
4229052,4,B003YGC7JY,"I bought this movie for my son, aged 12, for Christmas.  He specifically asked for it since it starred a wrestling star.  He and his sister, age 16, enjoyed watching this movie, but I never watched it.  They liked the typical kid stuff that involved toilet humor but overall, he said this rated 4 out of 5 stars because it was good but not great.",1296518400,,346,4.292307692307692

  and thx again amazon for being ther for us!!",1296172800,,126,4.208333333333333
4229054,4,B003YGC7JY,"This was a gift for our whole family for Christmas.  My boys love WWE and found that seeing ""Big Show"" in a comedy was great!  It was funny and entertaining!",1293926400,,157,4.2
4229055,3,B003YGC7JY,"I recently rented this movie. I knew in advance this isn't that much of a good movie and it isnt. The storyline is alright and some of the humor. Big Show should really just stick to wrestling as he isn't really that good of an actor. If this was made by another movie company instead of WWE films and didn't star the 7'0 Big Show...this movie might've been really good...ok more then that. Yes some of acting is a tad bad..and some characters you just hate...for the wrong reason.

The movie did have some cool moments but a lot of bad. The storyline wasn't all that bad..even though it has been done before...way too many times.

Rent this if you like goofball movies, but skip if you want to see a good movie. In the end this movie is just ok.

Pros
-Had potental
-Some good funny moments
-Cool moments (the match against the bear)
-Interesting storyline

Cons
-Big Show's acting
-Some of the other actors
-Some characters are just bad",1293753600,,938,4.4678362573099415
4229056,1,B003YGC7JY,"I bought this movie for my son for Christmas.  He says it is not a
good movie.  He has tried to watch it twice and can not enjoy it
enough to get through it.  He told his aunt that he would not even
recommend that they watch it.  I would not recommend this movie.",1293494400,,263,3.814814814814815
4229057,5,B003YGC7JY,A delightful surprise. The movie was entertaining and funny. It did not try to be anything more than fun entertainment. I am not sure why it went DVD only as it was as good as any comedy of late at theaters. The storyline is easy to follow and the development of the story and its direction is easy to identity with. It is a cute movie with minimal foul language. You do not have to be embarasses if you watch it with your kids. The cast and supporting cast is quality actors and Big Show does a good job in his role.,1292976000,4,517,4.078431372549019
4229058,1,B003YGC7JY,"I am very unhappy with what has happened with this movie from the very beginning. It started by ordering the movie on November 7th, it should have arrived by the 19th and it didn't I waited until the 28th then Amazon was supposed to next day air me a replacement well that did not arrive until December 2 and when it arrived I tried to watch the movie the previews had sound but the movie had no sound track at all. I called Amazon again and this time I got someone on the phone that I could hardly understand and that could not understand English very well I soon became rather frustrated and finally got the person to understand that it was a problem with the DVD and not my equipment when I asked to talk to someone else that talked English they did not understand that either getting more frustrated finally the person said that they would replace the DVD but instead of next day it would not be until December 21st so instead of having them replace it I just had them refund my money to my account and I will pick up the movie at Wal-mart where the clerk understands English. I really like Amazon.com and have always left good feedback but this time the person not understanding English really frustrated me I'm sure that I will enjoy the movie.",1291248000,,1250,4.369098712446352
4229059,3,B003YGC7JY,"Paul ""Big Show"" Wight plays Walter Kronk, a 32 year old orphan who's looks like a giant but it really just a child at heart &  accidently sets fire to the kitchen in the orphanage causing thousands of dollars of damage that will result in the place being shut down in a week if they don't get the money to begin repairs.  Elsewhere is a man named Eddie Sullivan (Mark Feuerstein) who's a mixed martial arts promoter who owes a heavy debt to Memphis Earl (Dennis Farina) & is trying to find a new fighter to win a tournament to get the money he needs to pay off the debt.  After meeting Walter, Eddie convinces the head nun Sister Francesca (Wendy Malick) that Walter could make the money as a MMA fighter in a tournament out in New Orleans & send him off on the road, for the first time in his life, with her assistant & Walter's friend Mary (Melora Hardin) as a chaperone.  From there they get attempt to build his reputation via the internet by fighting in the most unusual situations such as churches, backyard at a children's party, a bear at a carnival, and frat houses while running into issues of their own such as transportation issues, Eddie & Mary facing their past, Walter seeing this as his only opportunity to be a hero, and Memphis Earl & his fighter Redrum (Lester Speight) trying to stop them at all cost.

Anyone who's seen Big Show on WWE television or the now famous Saturday Night Live episode back in 2000 knows that Show is funny doing the ""Chris Farley"" method in that he's a big softhearted guy who's just very clumsy & doesn't realise just how big he is at times leading to a lot of physical humor. Doing this led to show having some very funny moments like breaking the bed in the hotel room, walking into a ceiling fan (I can relate to that one), using a small bathroom on a bus, and riding in a motorcycle sidecar with sparks coming off the back.  As I stated earlier, this comedy relies more on physical humor more than punchlines & jokes as the acting wasn't much but I was still entertained at the end of the day.  In the end, this was WWE Studios first attempt at a comedy film & the movie did it's job in that I laughed & was entertained for the most part so this is definately worth checking out for a viewing.",1290643200,3,2244,4.315914489311164
4229060,1,B003YGC7JY,"I was very disappointed big time with this movie.  It could have been done much better and the movie would have been funny if they did the acting more naturally instead of trying to make it funny.  The guys were great on Royal Pains when Big Show guest starred but this...  I wish I knew what they were thinking.  Big Show is a really good actor.  I feel his talents went to waist on cheap laughs none of which came from me.  Granted the cheap fart jokes and things like that were for children's amusement, but it just lacked in smarts.

I'm up for them doing another movie, but not like this.",1289779200,,593,4.241071428571429
4229061,2,B003YGC7JY,"In an interview, Big Show admited, ""This is not 'Gone with the Wind.'""  So you have to go into this film in advance knowing it's poor quality.  However, he didn't let fans know that in this flick, you get to see his gluteus maximus twice.  You may have to use the slow-down button on your remote control, but it's definitely there.  When seeing Big Show wrestle, if you've ever said, ""I wonder what he looks like naked?"", then this film will give you some idea of that.  If you love you some big men, then you should see this flick despite its obvious shortcomings.

Derriere aside, yes, this is predictable and silly, as anyone could assume.  The characters crash a bus in a field and they just walk away from it.  No farmer ever takes them to task for destroying his land.  The explosion never sets the whole field on fire.  A boy doesn't know a fire is going on while playing a video game.  Yes, young people can be focused, but a person at any age would say, ""Why do I smell smoke?!""  Big Show's character is supposed to be unsophisticated, yet when the subject of family jewels comes up, he is all of a sudden able to make double entrendres and witty repartee.  Of course, there's a predictable love story line here too.  There are some stolen bits from the 1980s film ""Annie"" here too, if you think about it.",1289347200,3,1314,4.37603305785124
4229062,3,B003YGC7JY,"Ignore the reviewer who mentioned ""Jackass"" in his review. This is not a bunch of idiots daring each other to do stupid things, it's a family movie. Paul Wight plays Walter, a 7 foot tall orphan who has never left the orphanage, also a gentle giant who wouldn't hurt a fly. The orphanages kitchen burns down, and in order to save the orphanage, they have to raise money in a week to replace the kitchen. So a trainer discovers Walter, and takes him on a road trip to train him to be a fighter and attempt to win a martial arts contest to get the money.

Sure, the plot sounds pretty thin, but as does most light-hearted family comedies of this type. You will see the typical love interest, fart gags and corny jokes that go into the making of these kinds of films. It's a decent movie, better then you might expect, but just do not expect it to be a Steve Austin action movie or a Glen Jacobs (Kane) horror movie it is far from either. Take note when you see the PG-13 rating, and not M or R, so do not expect ""JACKASS"" to appear and start clubbing each other in the nads to win over some mindless teenagers idea of what funny is. And do not expect Paul Wight to bring out a Show Stoppa either... however, he does bring out the Show Ploppa!",1289088000,6,1240,4.2100840336134455
