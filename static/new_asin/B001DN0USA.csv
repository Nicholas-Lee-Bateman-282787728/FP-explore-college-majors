3535075,5,B001DN0USA,"I've seen this series several times in Japanese and it just gets better with each viewing.  Now, Funimation is bringing it out here.  They have been trying to get it onto US Television so they have not only dubbed it into English, they have also re-recorded the opening and ending themes.  I got to take a look at a screener of the show this past weekend and the re-dub of the songs is well done and the translation is surprisingly accurate.

The dub itself, while not perfect casts for the various characters is one of the better dubs I've seen.  The translators and cast made a strong effort to stay true to the original Japanese version but Haruhi's voice is a little too deep, Hikaru and Kaouru sound a little too forced, Honey sounds a little too old, and Tamaki and the others - while getting the feel of their characters down - are little over the top of their Japanese counterparts in my opinion.  With only minimal differences between the Japanese and English dub scripts, and the attention the English cast puts into matching the Japanese cast in inflection and emotion, this is one dub that I personally won't mind watching despite the minor personal annoyances.",1222646400,4,1173,4.642512077294686

3535077,5,B001DN0USA,"Usually I don't get excited about anime getting dubbed. I like it either way, BUT... Vic was awesome. I got to see the East Coast premiere of Ouran today at DragonCon. They did a REALLY spot on job of dubbing. They were even really faithful to the translation and intent.

I'm also excited because the series is being released in two shots, part 1 and 2, 13 Episodes at a time. The Second half comes out soon after part 1, so not much of a wait. $44 is not bad at all.",1220140800,13,468,4.086956521739131

3535079,5,B001DN0USA,"Ouran High School Host Club is a great anime which always brought a smile to my face! It was well thought out and was almost the funniest anime I've ever watched in my entire life! It's both adorable, sweet, and funny. The characters are wonderful! Especially Kaoru and Hikaru, since they spend small moments of brotherly love scenes. I love all of the characters in a special certain way, like how hilarious Tamaki-senpai is, how adorable Honey-senpai is, and how sexy Mori-kun is. I don't really find any interest in Kyouya-senpai anyhow. Though the opening song, ""Sakura Kiss"", is a great song which even got me interested in the anime. It's wonderful and hope all you guys buy it!",1218499200,5,684,4.756302521008403

3535128,4,B001DN0USA,"My order cam today and I am half way through the live action drama.
So far I like the drama of Ouran High school host club It has some very funny moments.
The one thing I dislike about this drama is all the cheasy special effects some of the effects are good but some are just bad.
If you liked the anime or mang you will also like the drama so I recomend you should get it.
Also there are some things in the drama that are not in the anime  and thease things are included in the maga as well [Hint]

I don't want to spoil anything for you guys so you will just have to buy the Ouran High school Host Club Drama and find out what happends for yourselvers.",1358985600,,655,3.9545454545454546
3535129,5,B001DN0USA,"First animated TV show I watched in full. I was explained to before watching it that the series pokes fun at other animated shows and you can tell that from all of the characters' stereotypes. I thought it was really funny, but by the end of the series the characters are more vibrant than any I've ever seen in a movie. Even many books don't even capture personality as well as this show does toward the end. If you like a silly show that you can sit back and be amused watch, I can think of no better show to watch than this one.",1357430400,,531,4.115384615384615
3535130,5,B001DN0USA,I real loved and found it funny. If you read the mangas or watched the anime you will love this so much.,1357344000,,104,3.772727272727273
3535131,4,B001DN0USA,the packaging was good. no loose dvds or damages to the box. the disc conditions were good as well. ive watched the anime & some of my favorite parts were cut out. but i still enjoyed it very much. i think the live characters did well in matching the characters in the anime.,1352419200,,275,4.2075471698113205
3535132,5,B001DN0USA,"I'll be the first to admit that as a girl, I don't really like Shojo at all; I lean more towards things like InuYasha, Rurouni Kenshin, Naruto, and Sengoku Basara, with my only real experience in Shojo being Alice in the Country of Hearts (Or Clover) series. However, after seeing a video review of the show I decided to give it a try... and I was not disappointed!

The whole premise is quite interesting in it's self: a tomboyish girl winds up owing a debt to the princely Host Club, and has to disguise herself as a boy in order to pay it off. It sure leads to some interesting dilemmas, if anything! Nevertheless, the characters, though they fall into normal Shojo stereotypes, are actually quite interesting to watch. I start to feel like I've met those kinds of people before, and grow used to them as if they were my own friends.

While there is romance, the selling point for me is the humor; from slapstick to parodying, this show's jokes can be for all, be it male or female. The target audience, of course, is women, though I suggest some guys could give it a try... or at least see a review of it beforehand. Ladies, on the other hand, have at it! I highly recommend it!

Though I have only seen the first half of the series, I think I have seen enough to confirm my beliefs: OHSHC is wonderful, even if Shojo, and I would love to see more of it in the future!",1351555200,,1372,4.310077519379845
3535133,5,B001DN0USA,"This is one of the 1st few Asian Dramas I got my husband to watch and he loved it too. I didn't like the actor who played Tamaki at first but he started to grow on me towards the middle. He is really good at the slapstick bit. Love it whenever he gets slammed into the wall. The anime version was funny too. Overall, I give it a two thumbs up! :D",1347408000,,346,3.8194444444444446
3535134,4,B001DN0USA,"Alright full disclosure:  I have seen both this and the Anime to completion so being able to compare and contrast is something that I might end up doing a lot in this review.

The Anime ran for 26 episodes from April 6, 2006 to September 26, 2006 and ran on FUNimation's channel for those that wanted to see it on there

Over 5 years later(July 22, 2011 to September 30th of that same year) It was TBS(Tokyo Broadcast System) that aired what would be an abbreviated version of the series(11 episodes as is on this set) and the question is a simple one:  How does the live action hold up?

In a short form...very well

Let's get this out of the way now.  There are things that, because its a Live Action, were harder to replicate in the series vs. its Anime counterpart.  An example would be what they did with ""Honey"" when during the very first episode they used a ""shrinking"" effect to make him look smaller than what he really was.  This is forgivable because I don't think they could have found a kid to actually cast for this role but what could you do right?

Tamaki is just as batshit crazy as he is in the Anime and maybe even more obnoxious but that's needed to counter balance Kyoya's cool demeanor.  Before I got any further let me tell you now that Kyoya is arguably my favorite character in the series although I do prefer the live action version of Haruhi vs. the Anime counterpart...go figure right

If you've seen the Anime most of the episodes might be familiar in the content if not the order.  Remember how in the Anime the ""Physical exam"" episode was 3rd?  this time that episode goes second and in it they reveal the profession of Haruhi's father.  This was not mentioned(or at least not in the dub) of the Anime so when you come to find out that her father has a ""very unusual profession"" there's a bit more shock involved than in the Live Action.  They do deal with the episode where Haruhi reveals that she is afraid of thunder and the ""bondage"" scene as it were is one that is made even funnier when ya see it.

It should also be noted that in the Live Action only the ending song of the episodes is credited which is FRIDAY MA-MAGIC by miwa.  There is a song that is used as a lead up to the beginning of each episode but that song I could never find the title of for the life of me which sucks because its one of the better songs used.

If there is one ""tricky"" thing they had to try and still use from the anime it was the ""Twins forbidden love"" gimmick.  I say that its tricky because when you do that in Anime form you aren't associating real people with the characters.  In a live action something like this is a hell of a lot harder to pull off but they did it the absolute best they could which is why I didn't knock off points for it.

the only reason this series didn't get a 5* rating is because of how short it was.  At least ""Pretty Guardian"" was nearly a quarter of the length of its Anime counterpart but this one couldn't break halfway which is a shame because just as you are getting used to the characters...its all over

This series comes highly recommended no matter if you import it(which the DVD/Blu-Ray comes out next month) or you get this version.  Be prepared for the wild and wacky trip that is the ""Ouran High School Host Club""",1346630400,6,3279,4.275526742301459
3535135,5,B001DN0USA,"This is a very funny anime. I really like it. Although I have betflix and therefore no real reason to purchase it here, i would. Love it! My favorite anime ever! It's a good starting anime for those who have yet to watch it or haven't really gotten into it. On top of that, though, it's fun to watch even for hardcore otaku's (people who spend all their time reading manga and watching anime).",1340323200,,393,4.324324324324325
3535136,5,B001DN0USA,I originally bought the first copy that came out because I loved the series so much despite the warnings about the last 2 episodes and the sudden changes in names of characters and in incomprehensible subtitles and I immediately regretted it after trying to watch it. Then wonderfully this version was made. I am happy to say everything is wonderful now with the last 2 episodes. So BUY BUY BUY if you like this series.  Cant wait for the movie in 2012,1339632000,18,452,4.512195121951219

3535138,5,B001DN0USA,"I think I laughed throughout the whole live-action! Although, I think the guy who played Tamaki isn't at all attractive, I still think he did a really good job at playing the part. I didn't expect for Nekozawa to have such a big influence in the live-action, but he made the story really interesting.

I seriously believe that Kyoya's character is actually softer than in the manga and anime, but I might be wrong. It just seemed like he smiled a bit more and he put up with Tamaki's silly antics a lot more. I think out of all the characters, Kyoya was my favorite. In the episode where they go to Karuizawa and Haruhi is on a date with Hikaru, Kyoya and Honey pretend to be on a date while spying on them and Kyoya's running his fingers through Honey's wig and sharing a drink with him. Their outfits are also really ridiculous! Honestly, I didn't realize that it was Honey at first, but it was so hilarious. It didn't seem like it was something Kyoya would do. but because of that, that is my favorite episode.

Although it is a little off from the manga and anime, all in all, this drama was great. I can't wait for the movie!!!",1335052800,10,1132,4.334905660377358

3535142,5,B001DN0USA,"""The Ouran host Club is where the school's handsomest boys with too much time on their hands entertain young ladies who also have way too much time on their hands.""

Well, that's the basic description. But ""Ouran High School Host Club: Season 1, Part 1"" is so much more than just a slapsticky reverse-harem anime -- it's a charming little comedy series that's constantly awash in costumes, geekery, over-the-top schemes, and an adorable little budding romance. And the best part is that the characters charm you as much as they do their clients.

Haruhi Fujioka has just started on her scholarship at the elite Ouran Academy, and is looking for a quiet place to study... when she stumbles across the Host Club. The six wealthy boys there entertain girls with flirtation and elaborate costumes and decorations. The members are -- melodramatic and not-too-bright Tamaki, the mischievous Hitachin twins Kaoru and Hikaru, cool-headed genius Kyoya, childlike Honey, and his silent stoic cousin Mori.

But when Haruhi accidentally breaks an antique vase, she finds herself drafted into the Host Club to pay off the debt... and only THEN does Tamaki find out she's a girl. But she continues working at the Host Club, and encounters some pretty bizarre adventures -- crazy otaku managers, physical exams, a fight between the inseparable twins, a jungle water park, their lesbian rivals from St. Lobelia's, a vacation at the beach, sugar junkie Honey developing a cavity, a Lewis Carroll dream, and an unexpected visit to Haruhi's ""commoner"" apartment.

And the Host Club also seems to be there to help people -- a little boy who wants to impress a girl, a father seeking his daughter, a young girl who feels alienated from her fiance, and even the Black Magic Club's president and his light-loving little sister.

It's hard to really summarize an anime like ""Ouran High School Host Club"" -- it's a big fluffy whirl of costumes, roses, over-the-top luxury, and lighthearted pokes at anime conventions (""Yay! There's debauchery here!""). It's just such a charming and fun little show, and it's made even better because it's almost surreal at times. Haruhi even notes, after an ""Alice in Wonderland"" dream, that she can't even tell when she's awake or asleep.

There's lots of funny goofy dialogue (""I never would have pegged the boss as an S&M pervert."" ""I told you! It wasn't like that at all!"") and hilariously weird situations (the guys all dress up in over-the-top drag, causing Haruhi to roll around screaming with laughter). But there are some more touching moments as well, such as Tamaki comforting Haruhi when she's frightened by a thunderstorm, or Haruhi's father reminiscing about his daughter's kindness toward him.

But the best part of the show is the characters -- Haruhi is a likably down-to-earth, sensible ""commoner"" who refuses to  succumb to the Club's weirdness, and often seems weirded out by the antics of the megarich teens of Ouran. But she's obviously getting slowly charmed by Tamaki, a charming but not-very-bright young man who seems pretty confused about whether he likes her as a ""daddy"" or a possible boyfriend.

And the rest of the cast is lots of fun as well -- Hunny's cutesiness is a little annoying, but it's fun to see him go psycho when deprived of sugar. Mori is likable and Kyoya is delightfully Machiavellin, and the twins are simply hilarious (especially since their personal ""theme"" is twincest).

""Ouran High School Host Club Season 1 Part 1"" is a delightful first half to this lovable anime series, and leaves you scrabbling for the rest of it. Charming, fluffy and fun.",1271548800,,3605,4.963515754560531
3535143,1,B001DN0USA,"I ordered this video series for my daughter, despite some trepidation caused by some of the positive and negative reviews. Unfortunately I found those fears were well founded by this Japanese anime series that portrays questionable moral values in a positive light.

I'm going to make this short and not waste your time. Are you buying this video series for a younger person? Then ask yourself these questions;

Do you want your son or daughter to watch a homosexual and incestual relationship between two young teenage twin brothers portrayed positively? Because that's a significant part of this anime series.

Are you aware that you are buying a series that finds it's humour on many occasions in sexual innuendos and scenarios?

Don't let yourself be fooled that this is somehow ok because the Japanese have a ""different approach"" to these moral questions. This video has the characters laughing uproariously at low sexual remarks and scenes that many adults would find to be inapropriate.

3535147,4,B001DN0USA,"Let me preface this review by fully owning up to the fact that I love Ouran High School Host Club.  I've only ever seen the Japanese version and so can't speak to this DVD release, but the anime is one of the very that manages to bring together warmth, charisma, excellent storytelling and characterization, and a wealth of sheer crack, all for your viewing entertainment.  When I heard it was being released in the States, I was ecstatic to finally have the opportunity to purchase the show.

Unfortunately, the price demanded for the show makes it impossible for me to obtain my own copy.  I don't follow anime as much as I once did, but what I remember of my previous DVD purchases was that individual DVDs (typically with 4-6 episodes a pop) would generally run at a price of around $20 and most collector's sets would only be divided if the show ran longer than the usual 26 episodes.  I was dismayed therefore to find OHHC to be priced well above this, at over $50 for new copies of collector's sets, and each only containing half the available episodes at that.

Ouran is a phenomenal show, and much beloved.  I can't justify spending over $100 on it right now, however, which is truly a shame.  The exorbitant price is what docked my review from five glowing stars down to four.  I hope fans more affluent than I help promote sales for this fantastic comedy; Ouran definitely deserves it!",1243900800,,1396,4.57429718875502

You can get Bleach season 1 for $48, and Ouran with half the episodes for $42. Sounds like a rip-off.

But not only did it have an amazingly accurate translation, but it left in alot of the honorifics and the english voices were perfect and might have actualy matched the quality of the Japanese voice actors. Out of all of the English dubs I have watched, (a fair amount of them ruining the orginal characters from the anime), the Ouran High School Host Club dub is by far the best and stands right up there with the Full Metal Alchemist dub (wich also has Vic in it).

I mean, I really liked it and all because I love Ouran so I can't give it a bad review. But, Haruhi's voice DOES NOT fit. The other voices fit well enough. But hers does not. I can live with the others. And I kind of got used to hers but I still wish that it was another voice. And the Haruhi in Wonderland episode kind of made me mad. But other than that stuff, the anime is really good and really funny. If you like the manga you will most likely like the anime. For now. I've seen then end episodes and they are weird. BUT YEAH.

Soon this wonderful boxset arrived to my doorstep on the day it came out to my surprise. More surprises happened on the way. For one Vic was great! He was surprisingly awesome. Secondly Hunny and Mori matched perfectly. However, Kyoya, Renge and the twins sounded extremely werid. I also didn't like Haruhi's voice because and seemed to low for my taste.

But I admitt this is better then most english dubs out there so I give them credit.

I also wasn't to thrilled with the dvd extras either. First, The Ouran manga preview for the first book (Which I have) Were to small to read (Even If I zoomed in on my TV), Secondly the Outtakes which I originally thought was deleted scenes from the Japanese version from Japan but turned out to be bloopers from the english voice acting.

I personally decided to give this a watch since I was looking for an anime similar to Fruits Basket. This anime is in fact a lot sharper and takes more shots at anime stereotypes than Fruits Basket, allowing for many laughs.

Characters are refreshing in that the writers and voice actors really exploit the archetype role each character portrays. Episodes rarely drag as there is always something amusing going on, or at least enjoyable. Basically if you want a really good comedy, get this.

AUDIO/VIDEO: The animation is really bright and crisp, looks great as the colors seem so vibrant and characters move so smoothly, or clumsily as their personality dictates. Music is fun, helps to further enrich the atmosphere and voice acting, both English and Japanese are enjoyable, though personally I always like to go Japanese audio w/ subtitles.

3535162,5,B001DN0USA,"I love this series - the comedy is right up my alley and makes me laugh out loud even after repeated viewings.  Since I'm not actively involved in the anime community I wasn't even aware that there was a lot of hype surrounding this show until after I watched it.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend this to someone  just starting out watching anime since there's a lot of parody of anime cliche in this that wouldn't be quite as funny unless you've seen the cliche a million times before.  The story arc is very subtle and really doesn't begin to take shape until the next season - this first season is more for getting to know the large cast of characters and laughing along with the random insanity.

The set is simple - I LOVE that they released the entire first season in one go (rather than having us collect episodes disk by disk with 3 episodes on each disk which is always annoying.) It's very basic - not a lot of bonus features on the disk or in the set.

The Japanese voices are wonderful and the subtitling is excellent - they do a great job walking the line between a literal translation and translating so as to convey a joke that might otherwise be lost in translation. I felt the subs were made with every attempt to be true to the original content.  Very pleased.

The cast for the English dub is superb, however as much as I love Vic Mignogna (particularly his work on FMA) I feel he was miscast as Tamaki.  Caitlin Glass (who was also excellent in FMA) did a good job, although I don't know if her interpretation of Haruhi was spot on.  In any case, the English dub, while not perfect, is definitely watchable.

The only thing I would change about this set is that there are NO bonus materials featuring stuff in Japanese.  There's some ""blooper reels"" which are fine and textless songs which are to be expected, but I would have loved to see more bonus materials featuring any sort of behind-the-scenes Japanese cast and/or crew.

Haruhi Fujioka is a serious student there on a scholarship, and she's determined to make it through without much fanfare. That all changes when she unexpectedly meets the members of the host club. Through a series of events, she becomes their underling, and shortly afterward, a host herself. I've seen the Japanese version, and I can say that Funimation did a fantastic job with the dub. There wasn't too much that I saw that was changed from the original script. Everyone sounded believable. From Haruhi's low tone, to Tamaki's and Kyoya's manners of speech, to the Hitachiin twins speaking in unison.

3535165,3,B001DN0USA,"Let me begin by stating the following two things: 1) Ouran High School Host Club is, hands down, my favorite anime ever. I watched the subtitled versions back on Youtube years ago. When I found out it was being released in America, I was incredibly excited. Which brings me to my second point. 2) I have nothing against American dubs as a whole, I find that more often than not, I am able to tolerate their voice selections.

And besides, we can always watch the sub version on the dvd is the dub bothers us that much, right?

Unfortunately, it appears not. I watched the first few episodes dubbed, but upon hearing Renge's voice, I had to quickly switch over to Japanese audio and English subtitles. However, the subs on my dvd simply would not work properly, despite which dvd player I played them in. They would usually stick on one line repeating for several minutes while the Japanese dialogue continues, or sometimes just not show any subtitle at all.

I found this very frustrating, though it did occur to me that perhaps I just got a bad dvd. I just wanted to warn everyone before they went off and bought a $40 dvd set with the expectation that they can watch it with subs. However, if you're someone who doesn't mind the dub (and there are samples on Youtube if you have yet to see them) or you want to take the chance that perhaps the subs will work on your dvd, don't let my review hold you back from enjoying a truly amazing anime.",1225411200,,1444,4.421052631578948
3535166,3,B001DN0USA,"Please note that this is the first anime I have watched, other than Pokemon, Yugioh and Digimon shows.  There's not a lot of text on screen in those shows; or when there is, it's not that important to be translated (menus and stuff like that).  But I love the manga of OHSHC, so I want to support Ms. Hatori in its creation by buying this anime.

So, I had watched the Japanese (subbed) versions of Ouran on Youtube about a year ago, maybe longer than that.  And I was surprised, when I got this DVD, to see that the times when text was used in the black & pink box in the middle of the page (for example saying 'Operation Haruhi Is Really a Boy' or whatever) - I was surprised to see these were still in Japanese with grainy English text superimposed over it.  I had expected a classier treatment of erasing out all the Japanese text from the boxes and using a clean pink font to put the English text in the box.  So in that respect this comes across looking slightly cheap.

The other thing is that when the voice actor for Tamaki is speaking, he sounds just like Matthew Broderick, and that is not consistent with my concept of Tamaki at all.  I would have expected a more serious voice, though not a deep one like Kyoya or Mori.

Now, there's something I just can't understand.  The manga has been out in its official English translation for years.  So, in the manga, we have ""Roberia"" and ""milord"" and ""Hunny"" (among other translations).  But in the anime it's been translated as ""Lobelia"" and ""boss"" and ""Honey.""  Why didn't they use the same English that's used in the manga?  In particular I think ""milord"" is a much better term for the half-French Tamaki than ""boss""; every time the twins call him ""Boss"" I think of Agumon and Marcus on Digimon Data Squad!  And I wonder why the English anime uses ""senpai"" all the time when it's not used in the manga and not really necessary.  It's not as if they have to match mouth movements.  The more I watch this the more I have to edit my review for these little things that bug me.

Otherwise, this is just what I remember from the Youtube versions, and it's entertaining to see so many favorite characters ""live"" as it were.  Hatori is a genius and I think her little quirks in the manga panels just don't translate well to anime.  You can have a lot going on in a manga whereas on screen it's tougher to do.",1225324800,2,2360,4.344748858447488
3535167,4,B001DN0USA,"Look at any discussion thread on the net over the last few years about which shoujo anime fans most wanted to reach Region 1, and the resounding cry was almost deafening - give us Ouran.  After a nail-biting wait for licensing news and a little bit longer for casting and English dubbing, the wait is finally over.

The plot reads like your typical reverse harem.  Scholarship student Haruhi Fujioka has made the grade for the super-elite Ouran High School.  Looking for a quiet place to study, Haruhi runs into the six member Host Club - filthy rich young men with too much time on their hands who entertain filthy rich young women who also have too much time on their hands.  Unfortunately,  Haruhi accidentally breaks a very expensive vase they were going to use to raise money - and has to pay it off by joining the club.  The catch?  Haruhi is a girl.  So begins her crossdressing adventures with Tamaki Suoh, the loud and overdramatic fearless leader; Kyoya Ohtori, the calculating veep who's the most normal of the group; Hikaru and Kaoru Hitachiin, the mischievous, funloving twins whose world is turned upside down when Haruhi becomes the first person who can tell them apart; Mitsukuni ""Hunny"" Haninozuka, who handles the cute niche with a vengeance, and Takashi ""Mori"" Morinozuka, your usual big, intimidating guy who's really a softie.

What makes Ouran more than just a relatively fun by-the-numbers reverse harem is that it's also a subversive parody of it's subgenre.  Tamaki is an overexaggeration of almost every major pretty boy shoujo male lead.  Hunny is a wickedly funny parody of all the characters probably best personified by Fruits Baskets' much more serious Momiji Sohma.  Then there's the twins, who put on an incest act clearly meant to mock fanatical shounen-ai and yaoi fans who insist on reading it into characters even when it clearly isn't there.  It's all done in a spirit of good natured fun, of course, and you'll definitely get much more out of Ouran if you're already familiar with two or three other reverse harem anime and/or manga to fully appreciate the parody elements.  Not that the show doesn't also have heart.  Although they're far from perfect, it's hard not to like the boys as they hatch hairbrained schemes - whether it be to get loving couples together, help their Goth acquaintance Nekozawa bond with his little sister or rescue Haruhi from the clutches of the fanatical lesbian feminists (yes, I did just write that) of the Lobelia Zuka Club.

The clincher is Haruhi herself, who is most definitely not your typical shoujo heroine.  No shrinking violet, she's not afraid to let Tamaki have it when he goes too far overboard; and it's a joy to watch her hold her own against the twins and give them as good as she gets - all with deadpan wit.

As for faithfulness to the manga, the anime so far sticks pretty close, the most noticeable difference probably being that Renge's role has been expanded and Nekozawa's slightly cut.

As manga fans are aware, the best is yet to come in Part 2- but so far we're off to a good start.",1225238400,10,3078,4.73921200750469

It cost me 50 dollars, but with 13 episodes, tons of extras and a school badge, that's freaking cheap!

3535169,5,B001DN0USA,"To try and explain Ouran with a basic synopsis does this anime little justice.  There's always so much going on, and with a diverse cast of character's including the princely, yet sometimes idiotic, drama-king, Tamaki, or the mischievous, trouble-making Hitachiin twins, there's no end to the variety of often strange activities the club members get into at Ouran Academy, a high school for the rich and prestigious.  Add to this, Haruhi, a scholarship student and ""commoner"" who was drafted into the Host Club after she accidentally broke an $80,000 vase.  The twist is, Haruhi is actually a girl and only the club members know it.  Being very plain spoken, Haruhi nicely complements the strange behaviors of her rich counterparts and is often the inspiration for many of their adventures, much to her annoyance.

  Probably the biggest concern of Ouran fans about this dvd collection is the transition over from Japanese to English.  As many fans will argue (myself included), the Japanese voice acting is flawless, making an English dub no easy task. But after getting a recent peek at episode one, I feel Funimation has met the challenge with great success.  While I'm not as hard core of a critic as some, I did carry some doubts as to how well they could pull off a decent dub.  Let me just say, I'm sorry I ever doubted them.  Usually it takes me a little while to adjust when I switch from the sub to the dub, but that wasn't the case for me here.  While there is the occasional rough patch, I think each voice actor did an excellent job matching his or her character's personality.  I found nothing distracting or out of place about any of them.

  My biggest beef, if any, is with the English opening and ending songs.  They aren't horrible, but they are a bit weak compared to the originals.  Not a big deal, though, as I'm sure you can still listen to the originals on the dvd.

  Overall, I'd say this is a must buy, whether you're already a fan or a newcomer.  The acting in both versions each have their own charm and you're bound to enjoy a few laughs every step of the way.  This anime also has the ability to keep you coming back again and again.  I never get tired of watching it, and the ability to have it in two languages just makes for double the fun.  Subtract a star from my rating if absolute randomness bothers you.  The Host Club members thrive on the out of the ordinary.  They are a bunch of rich kids looking for entertainment after all (well, except poor Haruhi).",1224288000,32,2495,4.548314606741573

8294236,5,B001DN0USA,"It arrived on time, exactly as described. I really love this series! The only complaint I have is that the subtitles are wonky. Really wonky. I prefer to watch without subtitles most of the time so I can learn more, but it's nice to have correct subtitles when I want to know the translation of something. I can usually figure it out, but it doesn't always make sense.

Anyway, great product!",1506556800,,392,4.52112676056338

8294238,1,B001DN0USA,I really love this series and own about have the episodes here on Amazon Video. Really awesome funny anime series. Why the 1 star you ask.....CAUSE AMAZON JUST REMOVED MY ACCESS TO THE EPISODES THAT I PURCHASED OVER 9YEARS AGO. NOW I CAN'T WATCH THEM UNLESS I USE ANIME STRIKE WHICH REQUIRES A MONTHLY PAYMENT OF $5. WHY SHOULD I HAVE PAY A MONTHLY PAYMENT FOR EPISODES I PURCHASED AND OWN ON AMAZON VIDEO!!!!!!! THIS REALLY IS BAD BUSINESS AMAZON!!!!!!,1490745600,,453,4.675

8294240,5,B001DN0USA,"I didn't know quite what to expect from this anime but I ended up binge-watching it very quickly.  It was funny, cute, silly, and even heartwarming.  The characters are sometimes very much caricatures, but then at other times have surprising depth.  I guess I should be grateful that there aren't more episodes because I stayed up until 3am watching this and would have most definitely kept watching it longer.  I need to sleep and this show is far too addicting!  I haven't watched the subbed version but I thought that the voice-acting in this was pretty good, definitely better than other dubbed anime I've attempted to watch!",1485561600,,629,4.841121495327103
