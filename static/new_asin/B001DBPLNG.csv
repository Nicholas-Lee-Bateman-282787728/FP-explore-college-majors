3528278,4,B001DBPLNG,This exercise program is FUN! FUN! FUN!  The kids are even having fun with me too.,1226361600,,82,4.125
3528279,4,B001DBPLNG,"I enjoy the workout DVDs a lot.  They really work on your middle section and lower body.  Some DVDs duplicate a bit but I think they are great exercises any way.  The only downside is that if you have a bad knee, some exercises might cause a bit of problem.  Just be careful not to overdo it.  I would recommend this to everyone.",1225238400,3,329,4.158730158730159
3528280,3,B001DBPLNG,"These dvd's are lots of fun...I really enjoyed them but my mom (in 50's) found them difficult to follow (as did a few of my friends)...took her/them a couple of weeks to get the moves to where she could keep up to the dvd. So, I think they are great but you may need to be patient with yourself.",1222300800,3,295,4.016949152542373
3528281,5,B001DBPLNG,I've always found prices much cheaper on Amazon. I found this exact DVD at Best Buy for 39.99.,1216080000,8,94,4.277777777777778
3528282,5,B001DBPLNG,"My wife absolutely loves it!! Not only does it give her a great workout, she's also learned some new moves too! I can tell the difference already in the way her clothes are fitting...would most definetly recommend this product to anyone who wants to trim down and learn some dance moves at the same time!

3528283,5,B001DBPLNG,"I just bought these on a whim and LOVE them.  I have a knee problem so I have to stay low impact. I do these workouts with no problem.  The thing that strikes me the most about these dvds is that the instructors truly look like they are having SO much fun teaching.

I love the movements, and haven't yet tried the actual dance instruction bonus feature.  It's enough to do the workout.  I'm always sweating and having fun!

If you've ever done a belly dance workout, Rania or the twins, I think it makes for a quicker learning curve for the hip movements, shoulder shimmies, etc. However, it's WAY more of a cardio workout than the bellydance videos that I have.

Overall, great workout, gets you sweating, it's fun!",1212451200,17,717,4.469230769230769
3528284,4,B001DBPLNG,The discs provide a really good workout but some of the dances are pretty tough. I have continued working through and have gotten a pretty good hang of them though! I would recommend them - I saw results very quickly!!!,1210550400,13,219,4.5
3528285,5,B001DBPLNG,"I bought this at a retail store on sale, not sure what to expect. I was happily surprised when I realized how challenging it was. I started to sweat during the warmup! This workout will really work your abs and hips. I'm using it to tone up my core muscles and to lay a foundation for taking some dance classes.

Besides the fact that it's well-designed and presented by real ballroom dancers (with amazing bodies - not an ounce of fat on them), there are several features that make this workout so good. The music really keeps you moving. You can choose to watch the video from the front or watch the back view (which is my favorite because it is easier to mimic the movements of the dancers). You can instantly change back and forth between the views, skip to certain segments within each workout, or get help in explaining how to do various moves. As the other reviewer said, sometimes it's a little bit repetitive but it's never boring. I think it's fun - much more fun that doing my Pilates videos or doing traditional stomach-toning exercises. I even got my husband to join in and try it with me and he said it was fun but hard! It's a very well-done workout and I highly recommend it.",1210204800,22,1191,4.413636363636364
3528286,4,B001DBPLNG,"I have tried 6 or 7 other dance workout programs and this is the first one that actually made me sweat.  The instructors are real dancers so their technique and movements are well done.  I love to salsa and swing dance and part of the reason I bought these videos was to improve my style.  They will not actually teach you how to dance, but if you work out to the videos you will at least be comfortable with the basic movements so that it makes learning far easier.

There are a lot of repedative movements in the videos, but I appreciate those because it gives you a chance to practice.  Also, the dvds are extremely versatile.  You can push a button at any time and they explain how to do the movements and you can view from the front or the back.

Great workout for your waist!",1202428800,12,781,4.236486486486487
8292656,5,B001DBPLNG,"After completing core rhythms workout, I feel very energized. I was having pains in my shoulder and after doing a workout with core rhythms, I have not had any more pain. They are great cardio workouts.

I am really seeing a difference in my waist. There is a pinch forming in the sides, giving me the hour glass look. I really enjoy these workouts, although I have to make myself workout. But after doing the core rhythms workout, I always FEEL glad I did. It's like my body is thanking me!

Next, I will try to eat healthier and smaller meals as well as working out five times a week to see maximum results. This is a great workout for those who get easily tired/bored with lifting weights and extremely hard workouts.

Glad I purchased them!",1356480000,,744,4.455882352941177
8292657,2,B001DBPLNG,"My girl friend want to have this one for her excize.

she really enjoy it
hope she keep do it for her helth

thank you",1339459200,,118,3.68
8292658,5,B001DBPLNG,"It is an understatement to say these are a great workout.  I got quite warm and steamy after about 5 minutes.  By 20-25 minutes, totally sweaty.  I love the music and the instruction is very good.  If you only have time to do the tape for 5, 10 or 15 minutes, I think you will see results and still feel like you've really moved your body in a great way.  Worth the investment.",1331078400,,377,4.109589041095891
8292659,5,B001DBPLNG,I have been looking for a new workout dvd for a while now.  And this is one of the best dvds that I have ever used.  It is so much fun and a great workout.,1286150400,,155,3.4
8292660,5,B001DBPLNG,"I'm really happy that I bought this workout dvd. I have many workout tapes. So in between my strength training dvd's sometimes I get bored and want to do cardio that seems like less of a workout but with the same energy. I liked the instructors because they were bubbly but they pushed you in a fun way. I also learned some basic Samba, Cha Cha, Swing, and my favorite  SALSA steps. It really makes you sweat for the whole hour and focuses alot on the waistline.",1281052800,,462,4.310344827586207
8292661,1,B001DBPLNG,Three out of the 4 DVDs couldn't be read with any of my 2 DVD drives. They didn't have scratches but they were freezing every 10 secs. My drives are working well with others DVDs. I returned them.,1273881600,3,196,4.184210526315789
8292662,4,B001DBPLNG,"LOVE IT! I have some dance experience and found the choreography fairly easy to follow, but even after doing these for several months now, I still find them engaging and fun.  There's always something to work on and improve and, if you're really working with the video, you'll be sweating your hips off. Most fun way to get my cardio.  Period.",1262476800,,343,4.60655737704918
8292663,2,B001DBPLNG,"I was really excited when I bought the Club Mix pack from Target.  I like the instruction, especially the Jive DVD and the instructors seem to break a sweat and still remain to have fun with it.

However, I have had to return the DVDs to Target due to some manufacturer defects.  The first set would not play at all on my DVD player.  The second set had a severely scratched Salsa DVD straight out of the pack and would not play.  The Samba Fusion DVD across two separate packs would freeze several times throughout the workout and the Bonus Latin Made Easy would not play at all.  Very disappointing because these look like they are very good DVDs content wise.

I did try calling the company who manufactures these and was told that I would have to return them to the retailer.  They were willing to sell me a Samba Fusion DVD which would have been $19.95 plus shipping. (They sell these DVD's separately).  However, since I had paid $39 for four DVDs, one of which did not work, I was opposed to throwing anymore money down the drain.  The company did tell me that if I had ordered directly from them (instead of buying from Target), they would have been able to just send me a new DVD.

So, lesson learned, keep your receipt and know the return policy.",1260230400,,1256,4.393939393939394
8292664,1,B001DBPLNG,"I ordered and paid over $40 for this club mix program that should include the 4 dvds... instead 2 weeks after the purchase i finally recieve my package and i instead receive the starter 4 disc package! I was furious and the only way to contact the seller was by email... i emailed the seller right after opening my package and i even checked my order history to be sure i was not mistaken but i was right i recieved the wrong set, i still (several weeks later) have not received a reply to my email or the correct package! i am not a core rhythms beginner and i am still upset that i wasted over $40 and did not recieve what i paid for! I never had a problem ordering anything online until now!

THE SELLER WAS ""MANIA MEDIA"" SO PLEASE BE AWARE OF WHO YOU ARE BUYING FROM!",1255996800,6,771,4.14
8292665,5,B001DBPLNG,"I bought these DVDs for some fun cardio, a change of pace. Jillian Michaels will kick your butt, but she's not the most entertaining instructor, you know? I was hoping for moderate cardio, but I was pleasantly surprised to find the these will really get your heart rate up. I'm 32 and in pretty good shape, and my heart rate runs 150-165 throughout these DVDs.

Each DVD has a dance warmup, followed by two dance segments, each focusing on a particular style. New steps are introduced incrementally in half or quarter time, then done at tempo, and then combined with other steps for short sequences, with each step repeated for four to eight counts per sequence. Occasionally they do a sprint, and this sequence is always very fast. There's lots of hip swirling and pelvic thrusting--you'll feel it in your hips and abs. They follow with a dance cooldown--something slow like paso doble or rumba.

Some steps really move quickly--I often struggle to keep up, and I'm quite certain I look ridiculous, but the instructors are so awesome that I always keep going. Seriously, they're adorable. I also switch between the front and back views. If I'm struggling with a step, changing views helps me get it faster.

I will definitely purchase the Sculpting set they released, and I hope they put out more DVDs.",1255910400,,1303,4.782222222222222
