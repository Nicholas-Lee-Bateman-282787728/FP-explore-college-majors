8470628,4,B005FSS40U,"This is a good DVD for practitioners who have an established practice, as it is not instructional.
However, if you're looking for a fairly vigorous routine, which incorporates sun salutation variations, you can let go of your mind and drop into the experience of your body through the smooth, pleasant voice and guidance of Diane Finlayson.",1346630400,,340,5.089285714285714
8470629,1,B005FSS40U,"It's not the backyard-production-in-the-flight-pattern-of-an-airport quality I object to; what I purchase yoga instructional materials for is the expertise of the instructor. Which in this case is minimal. The instructor moves quickly through the asana sequences as if this were a series of calisthenics, with little to no attention to the breath; in fact, she is out of breath and terribly unsteady the whole time. One of the basics of yoga, that every beginner learns is: keep the breath steady, synchronize breathing with the movement. It is this synchronization and awareness that brings physical steadiness to the practice. Utterly missing here. This is like watching a beginner practice, not an instructor-level practitioner. Unfortunately, even when not watching the video (I rarely ""watch"" yoga videos, only listen and practice) there was little to be gained from the audio - the instructor moves too quickly through the asanas for it to be beneficial, there's no music, and nothing calming about her manner of speaking. I've returned it.",1324771200,,1046,5.384146341463414
8470630,2,B005FSS40U,I only watched ten minutes of this video it was so bad.  I have been doing yoga for years and this video was so slow and basic that I had to turn it off.  The lady does not stop talking and all we did for ten minutes was swing our arms around.,1318204800,,243,3.6538461538461537
