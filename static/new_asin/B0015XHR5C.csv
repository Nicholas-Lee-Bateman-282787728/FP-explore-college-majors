3148900,4,B0015XHR5C,"What a fantastic season, Less whining more action. a lot happens in Season 9, they seem to embrace the idea o being around several more years and ramp up a few characters. This season Luca goes through some deep stuff and it was the interesting to watch him completely lose it. The episodes he narrates are my favorite.",1215820800,6,319,4.517241379310345
3148901,5,B0015XHR5C,"First off, it would be a lie to say the departures of Eriq La Salle and Anthony Edwards didn't hurt the show. They did. Dr. Greene was the heart of the ER, and Dr. Benton was the heart of the OR. After they both left the show in season eight, some reinventing would clearly be needed. ER continued on brilliantly for season nine. No, it was not the same show
it had been a season before, but season eight was much different than the first season. Nine was different. It had to be. It was not awful by any means.

Season nine picks up where eight left off. The hospital is in lockdown after a smallpox scare. It turns out the infection within County General is not smallpox, but monkeypox. Everyone is vaccinated and evacuated. Everyone except Carter, Abby, Chen and Pratt. During the evacuation, Dr. Romano is involved in an accident that will change the rest of his life. That accident has time and again been hailed as one of the most shocking moments of TV history!

The rest of the season is just as excellent as the season premiere. There are guest appearances by Sally Field, Don Cheadle and Edward Asnwer, among others. There is also a memorable Christmas episode that plays in reverse (a la MEMENTO) and of course the intense 200th episode, which alternates between the day and night shifts.

This season marks a change for ER. But the change isn't as bad as some people say. I think of season nine as the last truly CLASSIC season of ER. And while I'm still a loyal fan to this day, seasons 1-9 were the best of the best and I'll gladly add season nine of ER to my DVD collection.",1214179200,12,1589,4.3979591836734695
3148902,5,B0015XHR5C,"Like many ER fans after Dr. Greene was killed off in late Season 8, I was weary about what Season 9 would be like.  But after watching the first episode of the season,  I was dragged in once again!  My favorite character/storyline of this entire season would be the episodes with Robert Romano which is ironic because in past years I never really cared for his character, but Paul McCrane is such a exceptional actor - and I really loved the scenes with him and Dr. Corday!  Now they would of made a interesting romance pair.  The whole Benton/Corday or even Greene/Corday seemed kind of awkward for me.  Others might disagree.

The only thing I didn't like about this season, was the ""Africa"" episodes.  I prefer seeing action happening inside of county general rather then somewhere else.",1213833600,5,790,4.7153284671532845
3148903,4,B0015XHR5C,I love ER.  I like being able to watch all of the episodes of a season at my leisure.  I can't wait until 6/17.,1213401600,,111,3.5833333333333335
3148904,5,B0015XHR5C,"When this first aired on TV I started watching but ""put it down"" to watch other shows.  In a way I am glad I did, but also upset because I wish I could have watched it as it came out.  I am glad because now I can buy all the series on DVD and have an ER movie watch a thon.  Lol.  EXCELLENT SHOW!  I was upset with some of the characters leaving, but the show picks up the slack and keeps it going.  Nicely I might add.  I will be buying all the series as they come out.  Up to 8 now and waiting for 9 to ship :)

An excellent show by an excellent writer!  Thank you.",1212537600,4,567,3.689075630252101
3148905,5,B0015XHR5C,"I was thrilled to learn of season 9's release date. No matter which stars come or go, ER is a hit.  I plan to buy all 15 seasons!!!",1211414400,4,131,3.6785714285714284
3148906,5,B0015XHR5C,"ER continues to just as great as its previous seasons. Despite the departure of Anthony Edwards and Eriq La Salle, the drama and action still remains.

In this season, Carter must step up as the leader while dealing with his dysfunctional relationship with Abby. Luka hits rock-bottom and questions his desire in medicine. Weaver gets into hot water after an unethical favor for an alderman has tragic results. Pratt and Chen begin a relationship. Corday grieves after the death of Greene while teaching a medical student with Parkinson's Disease played by Don Cheadle. Romano's ""dead"" arm begins to be a burden and may derail his career in surgery. Susan treats a teenager with testicular cancer played by Patrick Fugit.

Highlight episodes: ""Chaos Theory"", ""Hindsight"", ""When Night Meets Day"" (ER's 200th episode)",1209513600,6,815,5.213740458015267
3148907,1,B0015XHR5C,"It is not the same without Anthony Edwards so I won't be buying it, Seasons 1-8 is complete to me",1207008000,3,97,3.9
3148908,5,B0015XHR5C,"Spoilers: While the television show ER lost some of its finest cast members in the preceding years, including founders Anthony Edwards, George Clooney, Julianna Margulies and the great Eriq LaSalle, it also gained some high calibre acting talent in the process.

Noah Wyle takes charge following the death of Mark Greene (in season eight), while Laura Innes's Kerry Weaver (a great characterization) continues with her usual ambitious plans, facing health and moral dilemmas on the way. Maura Tierney ably continues her role as Abby Lockhart, with Goran Visnjic maintaining his rebel ways. Newcomer Mekhi Phifer receives a top billing credit for his part as Gregory Pratt and although he has his moments, Sharif Atkins takes the upper hand with his portrayal of the likable Michael Gallant. Alex Kingston, a staple of the series has little to do this season while Sherry Stringfield returns as Susan Lewis, displaying some fine moments including a nice friendship with a terminal cancer patient. Ming-Na returns as Jing-Mei Chen, turning up the heat with her relationship with Pratt.

Season nine however, is highlighted by the brilliance of the underrated Paul McCrane. McCrane's Robert Romano faces a hard road to recovery after a devastating accident in the season opening. Though previously considered the shows 'villain', McCrane's character (who previously had few redeeming features other than his brilliance as a surgeon) is fleshed out more during season nine. With a more deeply felt characterization, McCrane gets the opportunity to display some brilliant acting talent, with a mix of the poignant and a touch of his trademark satiric wit. His friendship with Alex Kingston steps up a notch, with the two sharing a great mutual respect after years of relative hostility. It is a touching friendship.

Frances Sternhagen's Millicent Carter (John Carter's grandmother) is also worthy of a mention. First appearing in 1997, Sternhagen contributed to some great episodes and her pairing with Wyle left some great moments in the series history. This season is also graced with the presence of some great character actors including Bruce Weitz and Don Cheadle as a doctor in training with Parkinson's disease. On the whole, season nine is filled with solid work from all cast members and is a vast improvement over season seven and eight.",1206835200,38,2343,5.242666666666667
3148909,1,B0015XHR5C,"ER always suffered a little bit during times when a major character had exited the series. In February of 1999, George Clooney left as Dr. Ross and his absence left a huge gap for the remainder of the fifth season, while the seventh season dragged without Nurse Hathaway after Julianna Margulies made her departure. But the absence of Anthony Edwards as Dr. Greene created a permanent void, and one that Dr. Carter wasn't able to fill. I also thought for a long time that Carter and Abby would work as a couple. We finally see that unfold with the start of this season, but once they were together they sort of, well, sucked. Then there's Dr. Corday, who never showed any chemistry when the writers paired her with Dr. Greene and is now forced to be involved in some storyline where she's training an upcoming doctor who's keeping a secret about his disability. The real disability lies within the writers for creating a storyline that was totally boring as nothing compelling or challenging took place. We're also subjected to the return of Abby's mother as well as all the repeated tales of that relationship which took place two seasons earlier. There are many more flaws too numerous too mention, but let's just say that the quality of this once outstanding series had declined so bad that I stopped watching the show by the time they were airing the spring episodes. I remember the previews for the season finale though, which involved Carter and Luka stranded on some African safari. What should have happened next was NBC yanking the summer reruns and announcing that the show died a peaceful death.",1206662400,14,1606,4.759856630824372

3148971,5,B0015XHR5C,"This may be the first season where I found even one episode a bit less than brilliant. John Carter and Luka Kovac stand out in this season, and I am especially happy that Carter has resumed his climb in the ER hierarchy. I continue to expect that one of these days, he will reach the position of chief of the ER.

The opening episode is as gripping as the season 8 closer, as the ER shutdown finally gets resolved, but with a huge change in the fortunes of several characters with a fluke accident with a helicopter on the roof.

I'm happy that Carter and Lockhart continue to be the focus of the show, in the long run. They are a perfect balance of wealthy, privileged boy who does good in spite of ""advantages"" versus a poor girl who also succeeds, with exactly the opposite difficulties.

Luka Kovac is the center of many later episodes, which is good because he is an interesting character, but he runs into one of those virtuous character pitted against society rules episodes, which tends to leave a sour taste in my mouth, because it pictures municipal and medical authorities as people with no heart. Carter, on the other hand, challenges authority in the best possible way, and since the authority is Kerry Weaver, we can be sure that the outcome will have some balance and reason to it.

Abby's family problems tend to lower the level a bit, in spite of the brilliant acting by Sally Field. I can never quite be resolved to the notion that a disturbed funeral can be funny, and not tragic.

One routine which starts wearing thin is Kerry Weaver's threats to fire doctors for not showing up on time or going AWOL or all sorts of minor infractions, which tend to add up to major problems in an Emergency Room where time and patients' conditions are balanced on a knife's edge. With Kovac and Pratt, numerous threats come to nothing.",1387324800,4,1840,4.530120481927711

3149007,2,B0015XHR5C,"ER: The Complete Ninth Season (2001)

On June seventeenth 2008 Warner Brothers released the ninth season of ER in a six DVD set.

It's rare that the jumping of the shark in a television series can be spotted so easily, but there it is in all its gory glory in the first episode (Chaos Theory) of season nine of ER.

The proverbial shark in this case turned out to be the rotor blade of a helicopter that famed surgeon Dr. Robert ""Rocket"" Romano (Paul McCrane) manages to walk into resulting in the amputation of his arm.  This shockingly graphic plot twist would eventually lead to the ruining of one of the greatest antagonists on television.

Though attempts would be made in future years to introduce similar characters, none have been as well acted or appreciated.

Season nine also marks the first full season without the stabilizing force of the now deceased Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards).  That absence is felt throughout the season, as other leaders such as Dr. John Carter (Noah Wyle) and Dr. Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes) attempt to be a calming force in the ER.  No help is given by other characters such as Luka Kovac who spends most of the season going from one bed and problem to another, or Abby Lockhart RN (Maura Tierney) who spends a substantial amount of time dealing with her family and her relationships.

The family issues of Abby do allow for all-star guest appearances by Sally Fields as her mother and Tom Everett Scott as her brother.  Unfortunately the characters are one-dimensional, and the writing allows for little range by these talented actors.

The success of ER was built on the stories revolving around the patients coming into the hospital.  After a trend that began years earlier, the ER storylines really hit a low point in season nine, as the focus is solely on the lives of the doctors, and little screen time is spent on the stories of the patients.

Along with the set-up for the departure of the Rocket, we see the slow departure of Dr. Elizabeth Corday (Alex Kingston) and the second departure of Dr. Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield) as the writers struggle with writing for women in a season dominated by male characters.

This season is not without good episodes.  The opening episode of the season is certainly shocking, and the last (Kisangani) would lead to many great episodes in season 10.  The writing is fine, but the focus could certainly have been more diverse.  Season nine also includes appearances by Academy Nominated Actor Don Cheadle as the Parkinson disease stricken medical student Paul Nathan.  Though the performance is solid, the character appears to only serve the purpose of giving Dr. Corday something to do.

Not a lot of extras here.  The deleted scenes are interesting in a few cases, but for the most part it is clear why they were deleted.  The gag reel is fun.

Recommendation: This is only for the true fans.  Generally the writing and bringing in of guest stars seems desperate.  Better episodes in season eight and ten.",1237248000,3,2999,4.7562862669245645

While I found that it was odd not having many of the original cast on the show anymore they definitely had some good additions this season to help fill the void.
And a shake up at County General moves the management of the staff around.  I liked this season because it dealt with change as a rule in life.

3383398,5,B0015XHR5C,"First off, it would be a lie to say the departures of Eriq La Salle and Anthony Edwards didn't hurt the show. They did. Dr. Greene was the heart of the ER, and Dr. Benton was the heart of the OR. After they both left the show in season eight, some reinventing would clearly be needed. ER continued on brilliantly for season nine. No, it was not the same show
it had been a season before, but season eight was much different than the first season. Nine was different. It had to be. It was not awful by any means.

Season nine picks up where eight left off. The hospital is in lockdown after a smallpox scare. It turns out the infection within County General is not smallpox, but monkeypox. Everyone is vaccinated and evacuated. Everyone except Carter, Abby, Chen and Pratt. During the evacuation, Dr. Romano is involved in an accident that will change the rest of his life. That accident has time and again been hailed as one of the most shocking moments of TV history!

The rest of the season is just as excellent as the season premiere. There are guest appearances by Sally Field, Don Cheadle and Edward Asnwer, among others. There is also a memorable Christmas episode that plays in reverse (a la MEMENTO) and of course the intense 200th episode, which alternates between the day and night shifts.

This season marks a change for ER. But the change isn't as bad as some people say. I think of season nine as the last truly CLASSIC season of ER. And while I'm still a loyal fan to this day, seasons 1-9 were the best of the best and I'll gladly add season nine of ER to my DVD collection.",1214179200,12,1589,4.3979591836734695
3383399,5,B0015XHR5C,"Like many ER fans after Dr. Greene was killed off in late Season 8, I was weary about what Season 9 would be like.  But after watching the first episode of the season,  I was dragged in once again!  My favorite character/storyline of this entire season would be the episodes with Robert Romano which is ironic because in past years I never really cared for his character, but Paul McCrane is such a exceptional actor - and I really loved the scenes with him and Dr. Corday!  Now they would of made a interesting romance pair.  The whole Benton/Corday or even Greene/Corday seemed kind of awkward for me.  Others might disagree.

The only thing I didn't like about this season, was the ""Africa"" episodes.  I prefer seeing action happening inside of county general rather then somewhere else.",1213833600,5,790,4.7153284671532845

Weaver gets into hot water after an unethical favor for an alderman has tragic results. Pratt and Chen begin a relationship.

3383405,5,B0015XHR5C,"Spoilers: While the television show ER lost some of its finest cast members in the preceding years, including founders Anthony Edwards, George Clooney, Julianna Margulies and the great Eriq LaSalle, it also gained some high calibre acting talent in the process.

Noah Wyle takes charge following the death of Mark Greene (in season eight), while Laura Innes's Kerry Weaver (a great characterization) continues with her usual ambitious plans, facing health and moral dilemmas on the way. Maura Tierney ably continues her role as Abby Lockhart, with Goran Visnjic maintaining his rebel ways. Newcomer Mekhi Phifer receives a top billing credit for his part as Gregory Pratt and although he has his moments, Sharif Atkins takes the upper hand with his portrayal of the likable Michael Gallant. Alex Kingston, a staple of the series has little to do this season while Sherry Stringfield returns as Susan Lewis, displaying some fine moments including a nice friendship with a terminal cancer patient. Ming-Na returns as Jing-Mei Chen, turning up the heat with her relationship with Pratt.

Season nine however, is highlighted by the brilliance of the underrated Paul McCrane. McCrane's Robert Romano faces a hard road to recovery after a devastating accident in the season opening. Though previously considered the shows 'villain', McCrane's character (who previously had few redeeming features other than his brilliance as a surgeon) is fleshed out more during season nine. With a more deeply felt characterization, McCrane gets the opportunity to display some brilliant acting talent, with a mix of the poignant and a touch of his trademark satiric wit. His friendship with Alex Kingston steps up a notch, with the two sharing a great mutual respect after years of relative hostility. It is a touching friendship.

Frances Sternhagen's Millicent Carter (John Carter's grandmother) is also worthy of a mention. First appearing in 1997, Sternhagen contributed to some great episodes and her pairing with Wyle left some great moments in the series history. This season is also graced with the presence of some great character actors including Bruce Weitz and Don Cheadle as a doctor in training with Parkinson's disease. On the whole, season nine is filled with solid work from all cast members and is a vast improvement over season seven and eight.",1206835200,38,2343,5.242666666666667
3383406,1,B0015XHR5C,"ER always suffered a little bit during times when a major character had exited the series. In February of 1999, George Clooney left as Dr. Ross and his absence left a huge gap for the remainder of the fifth season, while the seventh season dragged without Nurse Hathaway after Julianna Margulies made her departure. But the absence of Anthony Edwards as Dr. Greene created a permanent void, and one that Dr. Carter wasn't able to fill. I also thought for a long time that Carter and Abby would work as a couple. We finally see that unfold with the start of this season, but once they were together they sort of, well, sucked. Then there's Dr. Corday, who never showed any chemistry when the writers paired her with Dr. Greene and is now forced to be involved in some storyline where she's training an upcoming doctor who's keeping a secret about his disability. The real disability lies within the writers for creating a storyline that was totally boring as nothing compelling or challenging took place. We're also subjected to the return of Abby's mother as well as all the repeated tales of that relationship which took place two seasons earlier. There are many more flaws too numerous too mention, but let's just say that the quality of this once outstanding series had declined so bad that I stopped watching the show by the time they were airing the spring episodes. I remember the previews for the season finale though, which involved Carter and Luka stranded on some African safari. What should have happened next was NBC yanking the summer reruns and announcing that the show died a peaceful death.",1206662400,14,1606,4.759856630824372

3383468,5,B0015XHR5C,"This may be the first season where I found even one episode a bit less than brilliant. John Carter and Luka Kovac stand out in this season, and I am especially happy that Carter has resumed his climb in the ER hierarchy. I continue to expect that one of these days, he will reach the position of chief of the ER.

The opening episode is as gripping as the season 8 closer, as the ER shutdown finally gets resolved, but with a huge change in the fortunes of several characters with a fluke accident with a helicopter on the roof.

I'm happy that Carter and Lockhart continue to be the focus of the show, in the long run. They are a perfect balance of wealthy, privileged boy who does good in spite of ""advantages"" versus a poor girl who also succeeds, with exactly the opposite difficulties.

Luka Kovac is the center of many later episodes, which is good because he is an interesting character, but he runs into one of those virtuous character pitted against society rules episodes, which tends to leave a sour taste in my mouth, because it pictures municipal and medical authorities as people with no heart. Carter, on the other hand, challenges authority in the best possible way, and since the authority is Kerry Weaver, we can be sure that the outcome will have some balance and reason to it.

Abby's family problems tend to lower the level a bit, in spite of the brilliant acting by Sally Field. I can never quite be resolved to the notion that a disturbed funeral can be funny, and not tragic.

One routine which starts wearing thin is Kerry Weaver's threats to fire doctors for not showing up on time or going AWOL or all sorts of minor infractions, which tend to add up to major problems in an Emergency Room where time and patients' conditions are balanced on a knife's edge. With Kovac and Pratt, numerous threats come to nothing.",1387324800,4,1840,4.530120481927711

3383504,2,B0015XHR5C,"ER: The Complete Ninth Season (2001)

On June seventeenth 2008 Warner Brothers released the ninth season of ER in a six DVD set.

It's rare that the jumping of the shark in a television series can be spotted so easily, but there it is in all its gory glory in the first episode (Chaos Theory) of season nine of ER.

The proverbial shark in this case turned out to be the rotor blade of a helicopter that famed surgeon Dr. Robert ""Rocket"" Romano (Paul McCrane) manages to walk into resulting in the amputation of his arm.  This shockingly graphic plot twist would eventually lead to the ruining of one of the greatest antagonists on television.

Though attempts would be made in future years to introduce similar characters, none have been as well acted or appreciated.

Season nine also marks the first full season without the stabilizing force of the now deceased Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards).  That absence is felt throughout the season, as other leaders such as Dr. John Carter (Noah Wyle) and Dr. Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes) attempt to be a calming force in the ER.  No help is given by other characters such as Luka Kovac who spends most of the season going from one bed and problem to another, or Abby Lockhart RN (Maura Tierney) who spends a substantial amount of time dealing with her family and her relationships.

The family issues of Abby do allow for all-star guest appearances by Sally Fields as her mother and Tom Everett Scott as her brother.  Unfortunately the characters are one-dimensional, and the writing allows for little range by these talented actors.

The success of ER was built on the stories revolving around the patients coming into the hospital.  After a trend that began years earlier, the ER storylines really hit a low point in season nine, as the focus is solely on the lives of the doctors, and little screen time is spent on the stories of the patients.

Along with the set-up for the departure of the Rocket, we see the slow departure of Dr. Elizabeth Corday (Alex Kingston) and the second departure of Dr. Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield) as the writers struggle with writing for women in a season dominated by male characters.

This season is not without good episodes.  The opening episode of the season is certainly shocking, and the last (Kisangani) would lead to many great episodes in season 10.  The writing is fine, but the focus could certainly have been more diverse.  Season nine also includes appearances by Academy Nominated Actor Don Cheadle as the Parkinson disease stricken medical student Paul Nathan.  Though the performance is solid, the character appears to only serve the purpose of giving Dr. Corday something to do.

Not a lot of extras here.  The deleted scenes are interesting in a few cases, but for the most part it is clear why they were deleted.  The gag reel is fun.

Recommendation: This is only for the true fans.  Generally the writing and bringing in of guest stars seems desperate.  Better episodes in season eight and ten.",1237248000,3,2999,4.7562862669245645
