8427176,2,B004ELAF5G,"I bought the DVD for Shoulder Arms hoping it would include Chaplin's original music score added in the 1950s as suggested in the product description. Instead it was a random jazz record completely mismatched with the images. The soundtrack was so distracting I had to mute it. No detailed production notes other than what is listed on the website. If music is important to you, then invest is a better collection.",1391472000,,413,4.830985915492958
8427177,5,B004ELAF5G,"I have not seen ""The Bond"" available on any other Chaplin DVD, so for Chaplin completists, this is a must have, if only for that film alone.",1374969600,,140,4.222222222222222
8427178,5,B004ELAF5G,"This DVD recording of the 1918 film is a decent copy and plays well.  Charlie Chaplin's  1918 film played well to combat veterans of the time.  Both Allied and Central Powers line soldiers loved it.  Nearly 100 years later, I played the film for Vietnam and Gulf War veterans who thoroughly loved it.  The humor along with the plot are as current today as then as I guess the soldier's lot remains the same.  This film is one that truly deserves the term 'Classic.'",1333411200,,465,4.476190476190476
