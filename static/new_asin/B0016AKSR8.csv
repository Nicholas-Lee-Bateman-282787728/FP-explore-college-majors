8261944,5,B0016AKSR8,"This is a terrific film about the Algeria war of 1954-62. The brutality and the irrationality of war are the real protagonists in this very powerful drama. The Algerian insurgency threw the French army into an abyss of blood, extreme violence and war crimes. Fighting and making sacrifices for a lost (and unjust) cause was the real drama for the 2 million French soldiers (and the many Francophile natives) that served there. If you are a war movies fan don't miss it.",1417392000,,469,4.7317073170731705
8261945,4,B0016AKSR8,"Back in 2003, when the United States was first getting involved in counter-insurgency campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, the 1966 film Battle for Algiers about the French counter-insurgency campaign in Algeria received widespread attention. That film was truly a classic in highlighting verities about the difficulty of counter-insurgency operations, but it was primarily done from a top-down viewpoint. A new film, at a much more tactical level, is the 2007 French film Intimate Enemies, which follows a French platoon-size force into battle against the Algerian resistance. Overall, this is an excellent military film, with a high level of detail, efficient plot and great photography, filmed in realistic terrain in Morocco. Military professionals should consider including this film on their reading/watching list, to help them gain insight into the pitfalls of counter-insurgency warfare.

 The film focuses on a French platoon-size detachment, which occupies a hilltop forward operating base (FOB) somewhere in central Algeria. The time period is 1959. The backbone of the platoon is Sergeant Dougnac, an experienced professional soldier and veteran of Indochina, while the rest of the men are conscripts who are just serving their time. After the platoon leader is killed in the opening action in the film, Lieutenant Terrien arrives to replace him, straight from the Military Academy in France. While Terrien and Dougnac do not always see eye to eye, the tension between the rookie lieutenant and the experienced NCO revolves fairly quickly and without the ridiculous antagonism that often occurs in film depictions of this scenario. Initially, while on patrol in the Forbidden Zone (essentially a Free-fire zone), Dougnac orders the platoon to fire on a group of what appears to be women and LT Terrien chews him out. However, the women turn out to be heavily-armed male insurgents and Terrien admits that he has a lot to learn. Although Terrien continues to be a bit annoying at times, his character is still well played.

Most of the film consists of short missions or patrols, usually only involving 10-12 troops for 24 hours or less. Essentially, the French platoon conducts intelligence-gathering and ambush patrols around its FOB and the main enemy presence is a specific resistance group led by an Algerian veteran of WW2. The platoon has some interaction with a company commander and an intelligence officer, gets one air strike called in and a helicopter Medevac, but this is all small-unit operations  in some sense, this is a bit artificial, since at no point do we see other ground troops outside of this platoon. However, the focus is on the small unit drama, which enables better character development. Sergeant Dougnac knows his business and the tactical movements depicted in the film are often quite realistic, but not all the patrols end well. The unit is gradually ground down, due to losses and the futility of their task. The film is also honest about the tactical use of torture in gaining information from detainees, indicating that it does have its place in counter-insurgency warfare but that it can become an end in itself (i.e. torturing detainees who clearly have nothing of intelligence value) as a way of striking back at the invisible enemy.

Unlike U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, the French Army had no intention of ever leaving Algeria  they saw it as part of France. In theory, this deepened the commitment to the mission and purpose of the counter-insurgency campaign, but I think this issue was better addressed in the earlier Battle of Algiers, where a French general asks a politician what price they are willing to pay to keep the country. In Intimate Enemies, the members of the platoon just want to survive and go home, which might not be an entirely accurate reflection of the French Armys state of mind in 1959-60. In fact, many veterans were encouraged to settle in Algeria (where over 1 million Frenchmen were living) and a number of officers and NCOs were violently opposed to giving up on Algeria. At no point in the film do any of the characters ever act like they give a damn about keeping Algeria, which is more of a modern viewpoint looking back fifty years.",1389657600,,4224,5.070503597122302
8261946,5,B0016AKSR8,"In 1959, the French still occupied Algeria and was fighting the insurgents who wanted an independent Algeria.  This movie is about a French Regiment stationed in the desert fighting these insurgents.  It is a haunting movie about the psychological and physical toll the war took on the soldiers.  The soldiers led by a young idealistic officer daily combat these insurgents, and many in the French Regiment were formerly on the side of the Algerian Resistance.  You never know who the enemy really is in the movie.  The French control the land during the day, and the insurgents control the land by night.  This movie really reflects a later conflict the United States had in Vietnam.  The French also fought in Vietnam and left Vietnam.  The U.S. did the same a few decades later.  This is a movie a lot like Oliver Stone's classic ""Platoon"".  It is well acted, great cinematography and is a really good war movie that shows the French lost Algeria in more ways than one.  HIGHLY RECOMMNEDED!",1381968000,,993,4.7823529411764705
8261947,4,B0016AKSR8,"1959 Algeria, French military operations are being strepped up against the FLN insurgents fighting for Algerian independence. High in the Kybile mountains, Terrien(Benoit Magimel),an idealistic lieutenant takes over the command of a platoon at a French army outpost. Here he meets Dougnac(Albert du Pontel) a cynical sergeant. His ideals of fighting an honourable war allowing the Algerian people to decide their own destiny free from the threat of violence is severely tested. The Fellagha are led by an ex-soldier,Slimane,who fought for the French. FLN's punishments are slitting throats,cutting off noses and lips,massacre of villages for refusal to pay the revolutionary tax or complying with the occupying army.

Algerian villages are at the mercy of French patrols by day and the Fellagha by night. Every village has a pair of eyes and ears for the Fellagha and the French troops find their every move anticipated. The enemy is depicted as an unseen deadly presence striking from nowhere and disappearing back into the mountains. The enemy is shadowy but ruthlessly efficient breaking out like small episodes of the plague. He begins to suspect that one of the platoon's ""harki"" (ex-FLN now `turned' and working for the French again) could be tipping off the enemy. For Dougnac the only way to fight the FLN is by being nasty,by using torture,terror,napalm. Terrien attempts to curb the excesses of the men and keep them alive. He grows increasingly disillusioned and is shown the atrocities of the FLN from photos of Captain Berthaud(intelligence),who fought like many in Indo-China. Terrien forms the moralcentre of the film. He refuses to shoot a prisoner,though inevitably he changes under psychological pressure.

Siri does not shy away from French atrocities or raising difficult questions,like the Moroccons and Tunisians were granted independence,why not the Algerians? One of the Harki says the French in Algeria are like the Germans in France. The French treat the FLN as a criminal minority to be eliminated. This film covers the guerilla campaign in the interior ,whereas The Battle of Algiers was about the urban terrorism in the capital. Alexandre Desplat's music invokes the work of Morricone who scored Pontecorvo's film. Siri reminds us that many of the FLN were veterans of the 1944 Italian campaign where a bulk of the French contingent were made up of Africancolonial troops(see Days of Glory).

As the French who fought in the Resistance came to be called `fascists' by the FLN,they'd lost the moral high ground and their right to a share in Algeria. The film has some widescreen panoramic shots showingthe sun-scorched rockscape(cinematographer Coltellacci) and the shadowy,timber and clay interiors recall Leone. But the character-driven focus of men in battle recall Ford's westerns. I think good as the film is it oversimplifies the politics and uses stereotype characters,which somewhat blurs ideas. The subject was banned in France until 1999, when it was admitted that France had been at war,not `restoring order and peacefully preparing tomorrow's Algeria'.Again the treatment of Algerian Arabs as a shadowy presence and invisible does not give the FLN a voice,nor the Algerian Arabs(as in Camus's books).

This is a harrowing but formulaic insight into the realities experienced by French conscripts during the Algerian War, while the cast conveys the dehumanisation that comes from losing comrades and exacting retribution against the locals. The discussion of duty and divided loyalty might have carried more weight had Siri tackled the dilemmas facing the Algerians fighting the FLN fellaghas.",1380412800,,3632,5.366666666666666

8261951,5,B0016AKSR8,"Intimate Enemies is a story about a French Army Platoon in the mountains of Algeria that are fighting to suppress the out of control insurgency.  Their sector is ""The Forbidden Zone,"" a wild, rocky section of North Africa crawling with insurgents.

This movie explores the nature of dirty, savage, and small ""Wars of Peace"" where the hard-bitten regulars do most of the fighting.  It examines the relationship between the experienced platoon sergeant and the new, idealistic Platoon Leader as well as the policies and tactics that were part of the war.

Unlike most war movies, this story avoids the over-used clich of a weak Platoon Leader and a strong, but ruthless platoon sergeant.  Instead all the leaders are portrayed as cool professionals in a tough situation.  This situation is far more like the military I served in than typical Hollywood fare.

The movie is in French.

A top notch story of the Algerian War.",1370908800,,920,4.928571428571429
8261952,5,B0016AKSR8,"This is a favourite movie of mine, one of the few to cover the French war in Algeria (other than that masterpiece The Battle of Algiers). I first saw it at a festival of French films and was so impressed I had to get my own copy. This movie takes the tired old trope of experienced sergeant having to deal with naive young lieutenant and subverts it. A much better French version of Platoon without all the Oliver Stone excesses and simplification of character that spoilt that almost, but not, great film. Yes, the platoon sergeant is vastly more experienced, a veteran of Indochina before Algeria, but the lieutenant, although idealistic, is by no means foolish. In time the sergeant comes to like, respect, even admire the officer. The tragedy comes as the lieutenant's idealism, even naivety, is eroded by the nature of the war they are fighting, a no holds barred counterinsurgency where the local people are caught and ground up between the French army and the guerillas. It is good on how counterinsurgency wars are fought and full of little vignettes that show what this style of war costs all the participants. A very good and quite moving film. More than 4 stars, maybe not quite in the top rank, say 4.5 stars and definately worth seeking out.",1369353600,2,1254,4.704545454545454
8261953,3,B0016AKSR8,"Unlike British cinema, which never misses another chance to beat itself up about its Colonial past, French cinema has never really dealt directly with the legacy of its own colonial wars: perhaps not so surprising in a nation that never officially recognised it had even been at war in Algeria until 1999 despite losing 27,000 troops there (a drop in the ocean compared to the 300-600,000 Algerian casualties). At times Florent Emilio Siri's Intimate Enemies threatens to turn into a more sophisticated version of The Green Berets, as Benoit Magimel's idealistic young volunteer officer, confronted by FLN atrocities, gradually abandons his ideals for a more morally corrosive pragmatic approach. Sure, some of the French cross the line and torture suspects and shoot suspects `trying to escape,' but for much of the running time it's seen purely from the French side, and they're mostly pretty decent sorts who have their reasons - they even adopt an orphan who survives one massacre. There's also the threat of turning in a French version of Platoon as it sets up a potential conflict with his more experienced sergeant, Albert Dupontel, who takes a more practical approach to torture and killing prisoners. But just when you think it's going to end with a ""That's why we're here"" speech to the aforementioned orphan, it swings violently away as the nominal hero's values become so eroded that he becomes the worst of all of them and it becomes clear that redemption isn't on the cards.

Aside from writer-director Pierre Schoendoerffer (who gets a thank you in the credits), the French war experience in IndoChine (Vietnam) has been almost completely ignored, while Intimate Enemies is probably the first major film about Algeria since 1966's Lost Command and Battle of Algiers. If it does sound a bit like another loss of innocence saga, it is a fairly accurate reflection of the way the FLN's strategy was designed to make the French escalate their own atrocities to lose the moral high ground they claimed, turning it into a battle between two equally callous sides, only one of whom could claim the right to actually be there. That the characters don't spin off too much into war movie archetypes at the end - the big conflict you're expecting at the beginning never materializes because the old hands know the new arrival will be ground down by the place and don't waste any effort forcing the issue - is possibly down to the co-writing credit the two stars get for their own characters, and if the film is ultimately predictable the unusual setting certainly freshens the old, old story a little. Siri's direction has improved immensely since his unfocused Une Minute de Silence or the never-quite-as-vivid-as-it-should-be Nid de Guepes, showing a good feel for both the desolate hillside landscapes and the smaller character moments and progressing the characters' downward spiral through a series of patrols and botched operations that make it at times feel like a much bigger budget version of Alan Clarke's TV play Contact. It's not an outstanding film, but it's certainly a good one.

While the feature on the French PAL DVD has English subtitles, if you want a good selection of English subtitled extras you're better off seeking the UK PAL 2-disc set.",1256688000,3,3267,4.992660550458716
