8688057,5,B00PHUTIX8,"I was unsure of how the whole bird banding operation worked and wanted a better understanding of both the process and how the data was collected and used. This DVD was a perfect introduction into the world of bird-banding.

As a wildlife rehabber and educator there were scenes that made me cringe. However, each scene was immediately followed with a significant explanation of what and why those specific tactics were used. In the end of the film, I felt like I had gained a great deal of knowledge and respect for the volunteers that help make citizen scientist projects like this not only possible but extremely helpful for the entire scientific world.

I would suggest that any educator interested in wildlife and/or learning how to help make an impact with simple citizen scientist projects and data collecting watch this film! It is short, to the point, and left me with an immense amount of  knowledge on a topic I knew nothing about.",1419120000,,941,4.796296296296297
8688058,5,B00PHUTIX8,"I enjoyed this documentary tremendously; in fact, I've watched it twice in a month.

In northern Illinois, just south of the Wisconsin border, there's a place called the Sandy Bluff Bird Observatory, where probably thousands of volunteers since 1967 have weighed, measured, counted, banded, and let go over a third of a million wild birds.

I imagine most people have some idea of what banding is. I knew a little more than average as I am an amateur bird photographer, but in 35 minutes ""Bracelets for Birds"" filled in what turned out to be huge gaps in my knowledge.

The people are great. They range from children to retirees, and they are in the best tradition of ""citizen scientists"": regular people who develop a passion and add to our knowledge of the world.

It's very entertaining and has a handmade quality. The producer/cinematographer asks the questions you want to ask. Both kids and adults will like it; it would make an interesting and instructive half hour, at schools, churches, and wildlife meet-ups. The disk also includes a profile of the man who started it all at Sandy Bluff.",1415836800,,1097,4.819148936170213
