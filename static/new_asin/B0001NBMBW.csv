2030734,1,B0001NBMBW,My child gets scared by black octopus in show. Do not buy for toddlers.,1154563200,,71,4.142857142857143
2030735,5,B0001NBMBW,"My 14 month old is mezmorized by this DVD.  It introduces numbers, colors, the 4 seasons, parts of the body and more in such a cute way.  There are lots of kids on the DVD from a newborn to 4 years old and we all know kids love watching other kids.  It's narrated, there are lots of rhyms in the narration and the music is nice in the background.  When showing any of the topics, such as colors, the word is shown on the screen.  This would be a great baby shower gift.",1105142400,6,469,4.0

8016743,1,B0001NBMBW,This was so boring that my child didn't make it through 4 seconds before he was asking me to turn it off. Don't waste your dollar.,1458000000,,130,4.038461538461538
8016744,5,B0001NBMBW,"My son LOVES this series, obsessively, (along with Baby Babble) since he was about a year old. He knew all his basic colors at 18 months old, started counting to 10 at 20 months, and at 21 months is starting to recognize letters. Not that it's all attributed to a TV show ;) but I really think that it's helped!!",1455580800,,312,4.216666666666667

8016746,5,B0001NBMBW,My 21 month old son can't get enough of this video.  He watches it on my kindle and enjoys the different ages of children that present the material.,1410480000,,148,4.285714285714286
8016747,5,B0001NBMBW,"Looking at this movie, you wouldn't expect it to be able to hold a baby or toddler's attention.  We bought it as something to entertain him during long car rides, and now it is always our go-to travel show.  We were very surprised at how much he loves it.  He smiles at certain scenes, waves bye-bye at the end when all the kids are saying goodbye, and he's even learning!  For example, we taught him to point to the obvious things such as bellybutton, nose, eyes, etc.  But one day we realized the show had taught him MORE that we had never gone over with him ourselves.  (Legs, fingers, etc.)

I highly recommend this little show!",1402617600,,632,4.396551724137931

8016749,5,B0001NBMBW,"My daughter loves this show. She is already starting to learn,  colors and numbers from this video. It always keeps her attention from beginning to end.",1368230400,,152,4.846153846153846
8016750,5,B0001NBMBW,This video is very educational and my daughter loves it!  She was saying her ABC's the very same day!  It has so much more that ABC's and animals.  It has musical instruments and trains and much more.  I would recommend this video if you want your child to be entertained while learning so much!,1236902400,,295,4.407407407407407
8016751,5,B0001NBMBW,"My daughter starting watching this about 8-9 months, it was the only thing that could keep her totally focused if I was getting things done or trying to settle her down. She took it all in and really learned from it. The children on the show are adorable and help keep her focused. We know use the animals and ABC's and she can say her alphabet and repeats all the animal sounds with the children. We love this compared to Baby Einstein products.",1192665600,2,446,4.385542168674699
