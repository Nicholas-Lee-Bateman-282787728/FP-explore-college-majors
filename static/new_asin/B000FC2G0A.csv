8193780,3,B000FC2G0A,"This review refers to the Critics Choice DVD named Tex Ritter Triple Feature #3

The movies in this DVD are:

Hitting the Trail, 1937, 58 min., directed by Robert N. Bradbury for Grand National Pictures

Frontier Town, 1938, 59 min., directed by Ray Taylor for GN

Gangsters of the Frontier, 1944, 56 min., directed by Elmer Clifton for PRC

Grand National had its own singing cowboy, Tex Ritter. Tex proved very popular from 1936 - 1945, when he called it a career in movies. His singing was excellent and most of his movies were well produced, albeit in a short schedule and low budget.

""Hitting the Trail"" is considered by many one of his best efforts at GN.

In ""Frontier Town"", Tex Ritter is a lucky rodeo cowboy whose good luck is disturbing a gang of racketeers. You can see the kind of economies that went into the production of those movies by looking at the rodeo scenes. Evidently, the rodeo crowd is stock footage from a modern event. Tex's singing is fine, though.

""Gangsters of the Frontier"" is from the 5th motion picture company Tex worked for, PRC. Tex was now working with Dave O'Brien. The theme of the movie, human slavery, is unfortunately very up to date.

Although PRC was a Poverty Row outfit, Gangsters of the Frontier apparently has no use of stock footage. One gimmick that I found interesting was when Tex and Dave were hiding out from a massive gang in a livery stable, a woman plays a wax cylinder on a gramophone with a recording of Tex's voice to divert the bandits' attention. An early use of technology to save lives. Here's an opportunity to compare the work of a more mature Tex Ritter in a completely different outfit.

Critic's Choice's Triple Features are good for collectors. You can build an affordable film library without too much shelf space. Please give us more.",1153267200,,1809,4.6426332288401255
