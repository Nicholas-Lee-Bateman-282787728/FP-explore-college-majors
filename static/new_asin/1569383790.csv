187403,5,1569383790,Arrived on time.  No damage.  Gave as a gift and recipient just loves them.,1214611200,,75,4.285714285714286
187404,5,1569383790,"Out of all the movie/TV adaptions of Agatha Christie's stories, I think David Suchet does the most justice. It's as if he has been playing the role his whole life.

All three episodes in this dvd are wonderful, but this is coming from a die-hard fan (there isn't one thing that Agatha Christie writes that I don't love).",1210291200,,320,4.517241379310345
187405,5,1569383790,This movie is great. My family loves to watch it all the time. It grabs your attention and never lets it go.,1183852800,,108,3.9545454545454546
187406,3,1569383790,I bought the previous Poirot set and was extremely disappointed that it did not have closed captioning. I love Poirot but if I had known that cc was missing I would have passed.  I haven't purchased this one but no mention of closed captioning here either.,1039996800,11,256,4.565217391304348
187407,5,1569383790,"The Cornish Mystery - Perhaps not the most complex mystery ever concieved, but the character interaction in this episode more than makes up for that! There are great bits about an Indian restaurant, a man in a scarlet kneeband, a yellow-haired hussie, and Japp once again losing a case to Poirot. The actors really shine in this one! Also the background music is great! - 4.5 stars
Double Sin - This one combines great character interaction as well as a great mystery. The solution is great, and even the background music is good! If this episode has any flaws it's that the Miss Lemon side-plot seems out-of-place, but that doesn't really detract from the episode at all - 4.5 stars
The Adventure of the Cheap Flat - Another great mystery with a tad of a plot stretch. There are some enjoyable side-characters in this one like an American FBI agent and a club-owner who never picks up his phone. Just as good as the first two, rounding out this set rather nicely! - 4.5 stars
Box Set Overall score (Not an Average) - 5 stars",993427200,19,1025,4.545945945945946
187408,5,1569383790,"There were many one hour and somewhat less two hour episodes of the Hercule Poirot mysteries shown on PBS; and foresighted fans should have taped them then, because when A&E re-runs them, parts of each have to  be removed to make room for all the commercials. Very often, the solution  at the end flashbacks to scenes that we never saw because of the  abridgments and frankly the value of these episodes are reduced  considerably.
  But now Acorn Media is reissuing them in complete  versions, with the two hour features on DVD and the shorter ones on VHS.  Both series are a delight. The acting genius of David Suchet is enhanced by  his usual supporting cast (Hugh Fraser as Hastings, Philip Jackson as Japp,  and Pauline Moran as Miss Lemon), the wonderful guest casts, the  done-to-perfection ambiance of time and place--the late 20s and early  30s--with all those fabulous art-deco buildings they have managed to find  and populate.
  The first boxed set of 3 episodes contains ""The  Disappearance of Mr. Davenheim,"" ""The Veiled Lady,"" and  ""The Lost Mine."" In the first, you might spot a bad flaw in the  solution. Hint: how long was the playing time of the average 78 rpm disc  back then?  The second set includes ""The Cornish Mystery"" (with  a genuine ""blonde hussy""), ""Double Sin"" (with a Sweet  Young Thing in Distress), and ""The Adventure of the Cheap Flat""  (with a neat reversal on the plot of Doyle's ""The Red Headed  League"").  And if too many solutions depend on Poirot overhearing by  chance some remark early in the story, well that should teach you to be  more alert to these things on future viewings.  Also if Poirot is not above  breaking the law with a little forced entry now and then, well so did  Sherlock Holmes.  Very amusing sleuthing for one and all--and a very  welcome relief to the grizzly ""modern"" mysteries now being shown  with extreme close-ups, whispered dialogue, and as much gore as possible in  each frame.",951696000,57,1947,4.765060240963855

187434,5,1569383790,"These productions are wonderfully done and, for the most part, follow the books as written. I purchased the rest of the Movie Collection set as well as the Poirot & Marple Crime Anthology collection. Between the two collections I have most all of the Agatha Christie Poirot and Marple movies produced and no overlap.",1385856000,,316,4.87037037037037

187469,5,1569383790,"I read my first Agatha Christi (And Then There Were None -- also called 10 Little Indians) when I was in 9th grade (1974).  I STILL love them!  She made me love mysteries.  Always entertaining...always intriguing!  The joy of those put to the screen by Clive is that he stays true to Ms. Christi's books -- and Suchet plays the PERFECT Poirot!  These are wonderful and can be watched by the entire family.  There's no open sex, no ""f"" bombs,  and the murders are not gorey...which makes them great for the kids.  You'll even watch them a second and third and fourth time to pick up on the clues.  The best part -- just like a fairy tale.....at the end, justice prevales and the ""good guys"" win!  You will not be disappointed...",1366934400,,727,4.4393939393939394

187504,5,1569383790,"I own all but 2 of the Poirot series with David Suchet as Poirot. I will eventually purchase the whole series, and will be sad when I have come to the end. David Suchet has portrayed Poirot excellently. I do not compare the movies to the Agatha Christies books. I have not read the books but will someday. I enjoy setting down at days end, plugging in a DVD of Poroit and engulfing myself in a life style of England and the world of years ago. It is hours of entertainment that I can watch over and over.

187505,1,1569383790,"Acorn repackages the same titles which is plenty sneaky, but Amazon is equally to blame.  A list of the titles included in the boxed set should be included in the description.  Shame on Acorn and Amazon.  What is unfortunate is that I will no longer buy Acorn products because as with the Poirots, they did the same thing with Midsomer Murders and it cost me more than $100 to end up with titles that I already had in other packaging.  Also, because of the way the box is packed, you can't tell this until you remove the plastic casing.  FRAUDS!",1304467200,24,545,4.41
