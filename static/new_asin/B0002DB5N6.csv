2078812,5,B0002DB5N6,"What a great news, finally my favorite sit-com will arive on DVD!!

 I remember watching all of the episodes when they aired overhere in Denmark, and they were all simplly great!! And then it also looks like I have something extra to look forward to. One of the other reviewers pointed out that 102 Alf episodes had been aired, however I'm sure that we only had 100 shown overhere.

 I can't say anything else which the other reviewers allreddy have not pointed out, only that I completely agree!! Alf is just the best!! I do hope that every season will be avalable on DVD and of course the film ""project Alf"" too!! Can't wait to august 10th!!",1091145600,6,643,4.47008547008547
2078813,5,B0002DB5N6,"This show is a classic! At last I can throw out those realy bad VHS copies I have. I have been waiting for ALF to come to Home Video ever since the show has been on the air back in the 80's. I even called Columbiahouse years ago and asked them if they where going to do Home Video copies. They never did. Now releasing TV's shows on DVD is now the popular thing. All thinks to FOX who was the first to do TV season box sets with the XFiles,it was a huge success,now everybody is doing it. All my favorites is now hitting DVD,Happy Days,The Munsters,Fraggle Rock,The Greatest American Hero is coming out in 2005,Three's Company seaon 3 is due out in November,Diffrent Strokes is coming out in Sep. On Aug 10 ALF is at long last coming to DVD and I cant wait. One of my favorite episode from season 1,was the camping episode,where ALF gets into a fight with  Willie and runs off into the woods,and end's up running into some hunters,who think ALF is an Ant Eater. Classic stuff. I know where i'll be Aug 10.
Update-What a joke this set turned out to be!!! Waited years to have seasons sets of ALF and this is what I get Edit JUNK! What a slap in the face to ALF Fans!",1090713600,10,1165,4.177777777777778
2078814,5,B0002DB5N6,"Thirty days 'til ALF comes out,
 I'm so happy I could shout,
Shout for joy, I'm really glad,
 ALF on disc I wish I had.
Season One I want real fast,
 Thirty days, I'll never last,
I'll have to wait thirty days,
 Lion's Gate still gets my praise.
August 10th, too long to wait,
 Move it up, Just change the date,
Thirty days 'til ALF comes out,
 I will buy it, there's no doubt.
My friend Ron says ALF is fake,
 A real long hike, he should take,
Take a hike Ron take one now,
 Don't belive? I don't know how.
ALF is real Ron, this I know,
 Gordon Schumway told me so,
Get with the plan stupid guy,
 ALF on disc you need to buy.
Season One is almost here,
 When it hits, I'll have to cheer,
Seasons Two and Three and Four,
 I'll have to wait even more.
Thirty days to go is bad,
 Not as bad as what we had,
We had to wait much too long,
 Wait Wait Wait, That's just plain wrong.
DVD's will soon be mine,
 Like pigs in slop, I'll be fine,
Buy ALF soon, Enjoy the fun,
 ALF's the man, he's NUMBER ONE!",1089504000,34,997,3.8855721393034828
2078815,5,B0002DB5N6,Alf is one of the coolest shows I've ever watched! The stories were always fun and the cast pulled off one hell of a job. Paul Fusco gave Alf a delightfully memorable voice. To me nothing is funnier than a midget running  around in the Alf suit whenever they need to show his feet and whatnot. Buy this DVD!,1089244800,4,307,4.203389830508475

I actually signed a petiton to keep alf on the hallmark channel because I beleve that this show is timeless. Kids from now untill the world ends will always see alfs humor. I sugest that you should pick this up if you have kids. Alf will surely give them an experionce that they will never forget. I am telling you now if you have them waching alf when they are kids later in their lives they will return to you and say hey mom or dad do you still have those alf dvd's i want my kids to wach them.

2078878,5,B0002DB5N6,"I have loved Alf from first sight. I think he is the icon of coping skills. If you were an alien life form, having just crashed your space ship irreparably and landed on another planet in the home of a suburban human family, you might feel out of place. If you also looked like a very hairy composite of parts of multiple odd looking animals or other, you might reasonably feel like you didn't fit in and act shy, fearful, withdrawn. But not Alf ! You could take him anywhere or, rather, he would traipse along anywhere (if allowed) and feel perfectly at home. His episodic story is timeless, clever, wonderfully funny, immensely human ( of all things!), very well written, directed and acted. And as I now watch it with my grandkids, I know it's as relevant today as ever. In the words of Mister Rogers: ""Everybody's fancy, everybody's fine...""",1467158400,,845,4.602649006622516

2079024,5,B0002DB5N6,"I was in the third grade back when ALF first aired on national television-good times...what an unforgettable program, funny, warm, and wholesome enough for grownups and kids. This season is the one that shows how it all began--when ALF's spaceship crashed into the Tanner residence one night and they find themselves taking in this wise-cracking ET visitor that ends up being a member of the family. This was back when sitcoms were truly funny--and had memorable characters as well as a good supporting cast (like the Ochmoneks next door--the Mrs manages to catch wind of the strange new visitor and her husband always thinks she is imagining things.) Willie, the father, is authoritarian and uptight , wife Kate is always composed and sensible, children Lynn and Brian take a liking to Alf and try to give him the benefit of the doubt even though he can be trying at times with his hilarious Melmac-to-earth adjustment antics.
I'm so glad I could get this on DVD this had to be the first time in years that I got to see that scene where Alf gets lost in the woods and wanders off to a strange cabin and find this big knife that makes him exclaim ""Yikes!"" (On the Road Again, I think.) And the way Alf insists on tricking the family cat Lucky into becoming Alf's dinner-priceless (even though I love cats and can't imagine a creature who eats them.) The scenes on the home/index page where Alf does his usual funny wit...a nice bonus. Great watching!",1424822400,,1450,4.66796875

2079128,2,B0002DB5N6,"If so, these DVDs are for you! Make no mistake -- ALF is a classic of the late 1980's. A bit cheesy, yes, but still very enjoyable. The show itself deserves at least 4 stars.

So why did I give it only two stars? Unfortunately, these DVDs contain the chopped up versions of each episode that you see in syndication. This means that they cut up each episode as it originally aired and left two - three minutes of it on the cutting room floor. That's a tenth of each episode. Worse, the scenes that were cut were mostly those immediately preceding or immediately following the commercial breaks on the originals, which means that many of the very best scenes got the ax. They did this so that more commercials could be added when the episodes played in syndication. But WHY, oh WHY, would they use these mangled versions on the DVDs, where of course there are no commercials?

Want the full episodes as they originally aired back in 1986 and 1987? You'll have to seek the European DVDs. These are invariably quite elusive and therefore very expensive. And they're Region 2, meaning you probably can't play them on a US or Canadian DVD player -- you'll have to rip them on your computer to watch them. But at least they let you watch the episodes the way they were intended to be enjoyed...",1389830400,5,1287,4.495726495726496

He always puts his 2 cents in even when it's not welcome but he'd do anything for his family because they are family <3 His antics make me laugh and I enjoy watching this show everyday.

2079415,5,B0002DB5N6,"I started watching ALF when the season premier aired in the mid 1980's.
I use to have ALF bed sheets and a curtain. I still have every single episode recorded on VHS.
What upsets me the most is when they released ALF seasons on DVD they released the syndication versions.
Meaning that if you have ever watched the original airing of the show. (in my case I have them all recorded)
You will notice scenes cut short, or slightly changed even. I heard that when Lyon's Gate purchased the rights
to sell the DVD the creator (Paul Fusco) only would sell the syndicated versions, and that people/fans are
trying to get Fusco to re-release the show to DVD in it's entirety. ""PLEASE PAUL DO THE RIGHT THING FOR THE FANS""",1342224000,,712,4.484615384615385

2079417,5,B0002DB5N6,"I just watched the first season of ALF on DVD. This is the first time I have seen the series since it originally aired on TV in the late 80's. I was a big fan of the show back then but I was young, impressionable and in college. I wondered how the show had aged because I had aged as well. I shouldn't have worried because while it can look cheesy at times with the low quality video and the stiff acting (by the humans not ALF) it still is a darn funny, witty, cheeky and sometimes touching comedy. ALF may be an alien and his home planet of Melmac was a planet located in the Aldente Nebula in the Andromeda Galaxy but the humor is all Borscht Belt! The relationship between ALF and Willie (Max Wright) was a lot of fun to watch. Willie was an amateur astronomer and obviously had an interest in space (he received a book about the universe for his birthday) so he was overwhelmed to meet a sentient alien life form. That amazement would often turn to frustration because ALF acted like an ADHD 10-year-old getting into mischief. The Tanner kids (Andrea Elson & Benji Gregory Hertzberg) didn't take long to fully embrace ALF as a member of the family. The most friction occurred between Alf and Kate (Anne Schedeen) who was the most suspicious and concerned about having a hyperactive alien live in her home. So I enjoyed visiting with ALF and the Tanners again after all of these years. My favorite first season episode was one I remembered quite well from its original broadcast, ""La Cucaracha."" I still laughed pretty hard as ALF struggled to keep from being eaten by the gargantuan Melmacian cockroach. I know there have been rumors about bring back ALF as a TV series and given the number of reboots of old shows that have been successful I am surprised ALF hasn't been returned to the airwaves. 2012 finds our country and world much more troubled and divided than it was in the late 80's. We could use some Melmacian wit and charm delivered by our favorite fur-ball alien... ALF. Now on to season two!",1341014400,,2009,4.476839237057221

The inserts are in German although, compared to the states' release, there's a description of each episode, ours doesn't have that. I bought the entire series in one box, and it has fur on it, lol. You can buy these individually of course. When I went to the German site (scroll to the bottom and you'll see the link) it offered translation, thank goodness.

2079467,2,B0002DB5N6,"I was born three weeks after season 3 ended in May 1989 so I obviously have no memory of watching ALF during the original run. But my family loved it from what I've heard and seen. In my house, I came across a plush doll, ""U.S. of ALF"" trivia cards, and even a comic book. My mom even put ALF on my uncle's birthday cake one year so there was obviously a cake-set being sold as well.

I was excited to see this on DVD after discovering it in reruns but like many I was very upset that all 4 seasons contained the chopped up edited episodes instead of the original broadcast. Even some episodes had songs cut out so that was up to 6 minutes of missing footage. Lionsgate claims that the original episodes were too poor in quality to clean up so they had no choice but to use the readily available syndicated versions. How were episodes produced in the 80s poorer quality than say, an episode of a sitcom produced in the 50s or 60s? I have several of those (I'm a big Lucille Ball fan and I love her work) and the picture/sound quality is SUPERB.

Cut up episodes is the reason why I didn't buy all the sets, just 1 and 4. I only bought 4 because WGN wouldn't air it and the episodes were not on Hulu or Youtube. I got season 1 as a gift. The only good thing about the American sets is the menus, bloopers and picture quality. And the original pilot as an extra.

Then I learned fantastic news, Warner Home Video was releasing it UNCUT overseas, with all original music intact and default English audio. And it could be shipped to the US. I now own all 4 seasons uncut. Only 1 or 2 episodes from season 1 have a cut in them--in ""For your eyes only,"" they cut out the Chipmunks Christmas song. And the original ""Try to Remember"" was not on there either but through the power of the Internet was able to find a copy of the uncut 1987 broadcast. So in your face censors! On season 2 the only edited episode is the Gilligan episode but with original music. Sure the picture quality on the region 2 dvds isn't perfect and there's no extras, but it is clear and I'm glad to have those than the pathetic excuses for a ""complete season"" dvd.

Also if the original broadcast episodes were ""too poor in quality"" to clean up, how did they get them overseas? And even in their full length in overseas reruns? (Seen some on Youtube but the European dialogue is dubbed over the English so it's hard to hear)

So don't waste your money buying chopped up episodes. Spring for the uncut region 2 set instead. You will need a region free dvd player though. To whoever thinks this is acceptable when the unedited episodes are now out there, I pity you. I'm using the same logic as others--go to a baseball game and only stay for 6 innings, or turn around halfway to your destination and go back home.

This alien happens to be Gordon Shumway from the planet Melmac. The family takes to calling the alien ALF, which is short for alien life form. Although the family is constantly given a great deal of trouble from ALF, he eventually becomes a greatly loved member of the family. The majority of the comedy in the series originates with ALF and his unique personality and his encounters with the family. The series can be a bit cheesy sometimes and always wraps the episodes up with a tight and happy ending, but ALF is one of the few sitcoms to stand the test of time and still remain very humorous. As for the collection itself, it has to be one of the better DVD collections I've ever encountered. Each disc contains a little skit featuring ALF in the beginning and he also offers a brief synopsis of each episode as well.

If you're new to the show, heres the rundown:

A huge, orange-furred alien with a long nose crashes into a suburban family's house, and goes about winning their hearts until they adopt and protect him. And the alien speaks English right from the very first episode (this is never clearly explained, however). He also has only four fingers, likes to eat cats, and falls in and out of love too easily.

If this sort of nonsensical humor is your bag, then ALF is the show for you. Some of us (like me) who grew up with the show tend to be partial towards it, especially since ALF became such a huge part of our lives. Im 31 now and not a day goes by where I don't think of or use an ALF dialog in conversation. He was the KING of one-liners, in my estimation, and he only gets better and better with time. Ah, ALF, at least we have you on DVD to remember.

If you're looking for a cult TV show that you watch over and over again (a true sign of a classic), then ALF Is the show for you - I cannot think of anything better. This first season is an apt place to start as it introduces all the characters (including Kate's mom, played by Ben Stillers' mother!). As ALF says - ""Gimme Four!""

I hadn't seen any of the episodes since they originally aired so when I started watching them on this DVD I was a bit disappointed that the show isn't as great as I remembered it.  The setup is goofy but original--a wisecracking, gruff-voiced alien living with an American family.  Once you accept that premise, though, you find that the jokes and dialogue just aren't very clever or sharp as most comedy shows need to be nowadays in order to survive.  Certainly it isn't entirely a question of the show's age--there are many sitcoms made at the same time or much earlier than ""ALF"" that are still hilarious when watched today--but I think this show was popular at the time largely because or its original premise, while today's audience would expect sharper, wittier humor in addition to that.  ""ALF"" is also terribly cute, which probably explains why I liked it when I was a small child but why most of the jokes seem to fall flat as I watch them now.  Because cute is just not funny.  What I mean by cute is, a lot of the supposed humor comes just from showing ALF with different props or in different costumes.  Or from some of the little boy Brian's silly lines.  I mean some of those things may make you smile but I don't find them exactly hilarious.  And overall I think most of the jokes just aren't interesting or funny enough.  Many of the lines/observations just seem too straightforward, and much of the time when the laugh track is played I find myself thinking ""THAT was supposed to be funny?""  Like, just as an example, this exchange in the first episode between Brian and the mother, Kate.

Kate: This thing is not staying in anybody's room.  It's not staying.

Brian:  Why not?  E.T. got to stay.,

Kate: E.T. was a movie.  This is real!  This is on our coffee table!

And that seems to be kind of a typical joke for the series--just not quite funny enough to be worth a laugh (barely even qualifies as a joke, actually).  To be fair, though, most of the dull moments (such as that one) are when ALF himself is unconscious and not speaking or just not in the scene.  Although some of ALF's lines also elicit eye-rolls, he does have some funny smart-alecky comebacks.  The show is at its best when ALF is playing off of the dad's neurotic uptightness, e.g. when ALF asks him for a kiss on his birthday, Willie reluctantly complies and ALF quips ""Not bad. Still waters run deep there, William,"" after which they both wipe their mouths.  Willie is so flustered and seething with anger all the time (although you can tell a lot of the time it's just the actor struggling to remember his lines) that he's a bit creepy, although in a way it does make him a good foil for the Alfmeister.  So the show has some humorous moments although I wouldn't really give it that same ""classic"" status as, say, a ""Cosby Show"" or ""I Love Lucy."" And if I may just throw out a couple other criticisms, let me say that the show does have a few contrivances that are a bit silly, like they never seem to bother to explain why ALF happens to speak the same language as the Tanners, and I think the whole ALF wanting to eat the cat thing gets a bit tired after a while.

Of course I also must mention, as many others already have, that the syndicated version of the show is what was released.  What can I say?  Unacceptable.  I pre-ordered this set before it first came out so I didn't find that out until I'd already received and opened it, otherwise I might have returned it.  After watching the first disc and half of the second I got bored of it, but I just now finally got around to watching the whole thing (so I could sell it, since this is obviously not something I'd want to revisit repeatedly.)  I admit I'll probably rent the remaining seasons just out of nostalgia, though.  I certainly hope Kate's hair gets better during the rest of the shows though--that...creation on her head is almost weirder-looking than ALF himself.",1168732800,3,4148,4.41578947368421

In some episodes, they actually cut out the best scenes with ALF cracking some of his most memorable jokes and sarcastic remarks.

If it wasn't for the scenes being cut, I would have given this collection a ""5"" instead of a ""3"".

The kids, however, are not as great as I remember them. These characters are almost cheesy in their wholesomeness--it's very hard to suspend that much disbelief.

As for the DVD set, I've heard that this version is somewhat cut, but since I don't really remember the originals, I thought this version was just fine.

Why on Earth would anyone buy a Fullscreen Movie over a Widescreen Movie?
Some Fullscreen movies have at least 45 to 50 percent of the picture chopped off.
And yet People pay Good Money for them.

The Movie--It's A Mad Mad Mad World was filmed in a 2.65:1 Aspect ratio
This means that the movie is 2.65 X Wider than it is Tall
The Average TV Screen is 1.33:1
This means your TV is 1.33 X Wider than it is Tall
At least 60% of the movie is Chopped Off, Why? Because you can't fit 2.65:1 into 1.33:1

Imagine sitting in your Local Movie Theater, you're watching LORD of the RINGS
and 10 minutes into the movie, they close the curtains so they cover the side 20 feet on each side of the screen. What would your reaction be?

There are 25 episodes on four discs and some great episodes of the series are from first season.

In Don't It Make My Brown Eyes episode, ALF has a crush on Lynn and makes a rock video to woo her.

2079674,4,B0002DB5N6,I never much watched ALF back in the 80's and early 90's when it was on primetime. But I have grown fond of it in syndication. To me the show is great because it goes down so easy. I like Anne Schedeen's characters of Mrs. Tanner as she acts upset a lot at the alien's antics which provides some conflict in the scripts.

2079677,4,B0002DB5N6,"ALF was and still is one of our families favorites shows. The interactions bewteen Willie and ALF were side splitting to say the least.

Yes I recognized immediately that these episodes were not the original that aired on NBC. In fact just more than the three minutes that someone stated is missing !

Paul Fusco (creator and voice of ALF) did a ton of ""voice overs"" for ALF using a more ""normal"" voice than the lower pitched voice that he originally used - which by the way we all thought was much better.

The three minutes that were cut out of the episodes leave out a lot of humor. For example on the episode ""Oh Tannenbaum"" when Willie has his dream, we don't get to see one of the funniest sequences in that episode of Lynn dressed up like a ""biker chick"", Brian dressed up in a military unifrom ""to stem the tide of communisim in some unnamed Central American country"" and of course Kate dressed very sexy and being taken out by Trevor who tells Willie ""Don't wait up"".

The quality is outstanding and the extras are great - especially the outtakes and the original pilot.

I am still waiting for one of my favorite episodes - the one were ALF becomes a butler and blows up the kitchen ""one minute to go luck miester - then I'll be down on you like a buzzard on a gut wagon""

All in all a very good effort. But please someone get us the original uncut episodes without the voice overs !",1102896000,8,1393,4.318007662835249

Unfortunally, i realized this DVD came only with english track language, wich is ok with me as far as i want to know how Alf originally sounded. But for me, that i grew up listen every episode in spanish (and we're proud our dubbed in whole Latinoamerica, is the best), is sad that i couldn't listen again in that language. I hope and you can do something about it, or at least take this review and send it to the person in charge and see what happened.

Also, the menu and quick episode guides that are introduced by Gordon Shumway himself show that there is life in the old ALFer yet and rumours of a new series based around him are in the air!

As it has been stated time and time again, these are not the full episodes but the edited syndicate versions that were shortened so to include more commercials into the same time slot. Never the less, this is a superb collection and it is well worth the money. Let's just hope that Lions Gate Home Entertainment manage to get hold of the full shows for series 2 onwards and hopefully more bonus features too.

So I immediately jumped on this DVD collection that Lions Gate Entertainment released.  The only negative about this DVD collection is that they used the syndication version of the shows rather than the original shows aired on NBC.  The shows were re-edited for syndication and Lion Gate Entertainment or the DVD producers decided to use them.  If you think about it, it's not that big of a disappointment because if TBS or some other network decided to air ALF again on a weekly basis we would be seeing the syndicated shows anyway.  But, if I had my choice I would love to see the original shows released.  One line that I missed in these syndicated versions was in the ""Come Fly with Me"" show where ALF goes, ""Come fly with me, come fly, come fly, come fly with me!""  That little bit of the scene was cut along with a little bit else of that show.  That kinda ticked me off but honestly, I'd rather have syndicated ALF shows on DVD than nothing at all.  Hopefully, Lion Gate will hear the outcry and re-release Season 1 with the original shows and just release Seasons 2-4 with the original shows.  Either way, if you are an ALF fan, this is a must buy.",1094860800,2,1300,4.286885245901639

Do not buy this collection unless you enjoy the thrill of being swindled out of your money or find satisfaction in doubting your brain's capacity for accurate memory storage.  As reviewers before me can attest, the episodes included have been edited with a heartlessness most often reserved for the fiercest of Satan's hell demons.  Typical viewer reaction is more likely to be disappointment at not hearing a particularly funny line, of which our subconscious minds thought highly enough to bother keeping around for the past eighteen years, and less likely to be gratitude for being spared precious seconds of our time at the expense of a mere superfluity.  We bought the entire first season of ALF for crying out loud!  Our time isn't precious!  And if they had to edit something out, it would be far less offensive to our sensibilities and perhaps not a little therapeutic if they were to edit out that Brian kid.  As of yet, your only options as a fan of the show are to find videotaped copies from those of us with the foresight to have made them, or to travel back in time to a Monday night circa 1987, the potential for miscalculation and subsequent accidental viewing of even a few seconds of ""Valerie's Family"" rendering the latter option,at best, unpalatable.",1094688000,5,1294,4.828054298642534

2079691,5,B0002DB5N6,"In the past I've been dissapointed with the releases of 80's TV shows on DVD.  Some of the relases have been plauged with poor quality transfers and poor implementation on DVD.

ALF is a true delight to watch the DVDs.  Not only is the series every bit as funny as I remember it, but the transfer is first class.  The video and sound are crisp as any new movie I've seen on DVD.  I haven't watched the bonus material on Disc 4 yet, but the menus are pure genius.

Each disc has a brief intro of ALF talking on a speaker phone, the menu layout is great, you even get an optional, very brief summary of each episode by ALF without leaving the menu.

The DVDs are obviously designed for us simple minded earthlings, as ALF gives detailed directions on how to navigate the extremely obvious menu's.

The packaging is somewhat unique.  It's a four disc set, but unlike the dividers I've grown accustomed to seeing in multi-DVD sets, this one actually stacks two DVD's on each side of the snap case, which is slightly larger than the normal DVD snap case.  It struck me as rather odd at first, and to be safe, you might need to remove both DVDs on one side to get to the bottom DVD.

All in all, it was well worth the wait for ALF on DVD.  This is one serires they did right the first time.",1094342400,,1284,4.238683127572016
2079692,5,B0002DB5N6,"I'm so glad I bought it because I love Alf so much - but hell yeah it does suck that they didn't put the full episodes on dvd. It's been so long though I can't really remember what's missing - I was six when the show aired. I do know that the way the pilot episode just starts right in the middle of a sentence and mid-scene really sucks. That's the ep that sets the whole tone for the show and at first I was like ""What the hell is this??"" humph. Because I really couldn't imagine the original pilot just coming on like that when that is so important. On the special features, the ""un-aired pilot"", that makes a lot more sense and actually sets the show up where it is easier to relate to and I mean if someone hadn't seen this show before they wouldn't to start off a series with two ppl freeze framed and mid voice over ""that was the night he came into my life."" I mean it doesn't even explain what Willie was doing with the radio.. *sigh*  Still loved the eps though. Alf's sarcasm and one liners are still awesome almost 20 years later.

Lion's Gate could definitely have done better.. but oh well. What's done is done. At least for now.  Anthor big gripe though would be the ""boxed set"" WTF?! The overlapping dvds and stuck in the middle episode ""guide"" shocked me. So cheap. Maybe Season Two LG will go all out for seeing as how the f'ed this up so badly. And maybe they'll add to the special features on that one some uncut eps from Season One?? Ya never know.

Like I said in my title: The actual show gets 5 stars. The packaging of the dvd gets 2 stars. And that's only because it does have something listing all episodes & nice cover picture. Also the dvd menus with Alf being the narrator is really awesome so that is a 5. But I agree with the person that said it sucks that there isn't an option to play all episodes on a disc at once without having to go back to the menu screen for each episode and hitting play manually. But actually that doesn't bother me too much because I like a little hiatus inbetween my eps, that way I keep the episodes separate in my mind easier. What can I say - I glace away from the tv from time to time.. doing stuff like going on here.

Also neat is the manual option on the menu of previewing the episodes by clicking on the question mark tab to the right of each ep and having Alf summarize the plot so you can decide if that is the ep you want to watch for a certain reason or not, without having to watch the ep all the way through to figure that out.

Fav Season One episodes:

-Wild Thing : The ep where ALF must be kept in a cage for 24 hrs

-Strangers in the Night : Mrs. Ochmonek babysits Brian and unknowingly babysits ALF as well..

-For Your Eyes Only : ALF meets his phone friend Jodi in person

-Keeping the Faith : ALF becomes a Terri Faith ""girl""

-Help Me Rhonda : ALF gets homesick and misses his friends and Melmac.

-Mother and Child Reunion : Kate's mother comes to stay for a quick trip before going to Hawaii with crazy Estelle.. except quick isn't the right word after all for this visit.

-A Little Bit of Soap : ALF writes a soap plot from real life interactions in the family btw Kate and her mother and it airs with disasterious results.

-Going Out of My Head Over You : ALF drives Willie crazy. Psychologist pal of Willie's comes to dinner.

-Weird Science : Brian makes a science project and adds two extra planets that ALF tells him about. ALF calls ""Consumer Ed"" after the tv dies. Willie confronts Brian's principal by ""accident"".

-Looking Through the Windows : ALF thinks he sees Trevor Ockmonek kill Mrs. Ockmonek.

-Come Fly With Me : The Ockmoneks and the Tanners, including stowaway ALF, go on vacation together in Mr. Ockmonek's plane. ALF wants a talking toaster from the free ""real estate giveway"" retreat. The Tanners just want ALF to keep his pyrotechnics to a minium and stay under the radar of the Ockmoneks.

I did those summaries myself so hopefully I did them justice. Making them intruging without giving away too much. All eps are great though.. those are just a taste of my favs.

And one of the highlights for me is the Gag Reel on the Special Features part of Disc Four. Older shows like this rarely include gag reels or anything of the sort because I guess they can't find the footage offhand. So that is definitely a treat..

And Paul Fusco was quite the sarcastic hornball as the puppeteer and voice of ALF.. the part with ""Alf"" and Anne ""Kate"" when she touches him and his reply and the nature of where he tries to place her hand.. hehe. So I guess all in all LG at least gets 2 stars with me for that alone.. but their crappy packaging and laziness with the dvds is b.s.

ALF speaks on the menus...the first episode is played...you laugh...video quality for an old show is great.  You watch a few more.  All is good.  Or is it?  I seem to remember certain lines and jokes that are missing.  Then it dawns on you.  These episodes are cut. They are the syndicated versions.  Meaning they have been ""chopped"" for syndication when a series goes into reruns so networks can squeeze in a few extra commercials.  The official word from Lion's Gate is that the cut episodes were already digitized so...best for the quality.

Herein lies the problem...cut episodes but very nice video quality.  The set, if not for the cut episodes would be great.  The only other downer in this set is the packaging.  A single case holding the 4 DVD's overlapping each other makes it tough for one to get the bottom disc out...you need to take the top one off if you aren't having a marathon.  As for the show itself...it's as you remember it, minus a minute or two each episode.  You hated it or you didn't.  I for one, found the show quite funny and compared to the mass quantity of family on a couch sitcoms nowadays, ALF was and is a refreshing change of pace.

If Lion's Gate had the full versions of the episodes, this would have received a full 5 stars...for those who don't recall ALF very well, you might not notice but for ALF fans, this was a low blow.

2079701,5,B0002DB5N6,"Truer words were never spoken by the delightful alien who came crashing into the Tanners garage way back in 1986. He is lazy, eats a lot, is fat and spends most of his time in front of the televison. Sounds familiar? This is the alien version of everybodies favourite cat, Garfield the lazy. The star of the show is of course Paul Fusco's Alf but the main actors are great, especially Max Wright and Anne Schedeen as Willie and Kate. Their relationship is the most normal and loving of all the father/mother relationships in all of the 80's comedy shows and Kate doesn't torment her husband like we saw on series like The Cosby Show. The kids are entertaining and the neighbours (played by Seinfeld's Liz Sheridan and John La Motta) are brilliant and intolerable.

After years of loving this show, it is finally on DVD. And the DVD is brilliant. All the episodes in season 1 are entertaining although sadly some aspects are missing on the DVD -  scenes that must have been destroyed and that is a real shame. For instance the original pilot began by Willie and Brian walking to the garage but on the DVD, it begins with Willie and Kate in the garage (probably about 2-3 minutes later). And there are other examples. ""Mother And Daughter Reunion"" begins with Kate's mother arriving but Alf and Kate had been talking for some time (about how Alf was planing to watch TV all day long without having to move at all from the sofa) when her mother arrived in that episode (and part of the missing scene can be seen in that show's end credits). But that doesn't change the fact that one of the greatest television characters of all times is on DVD for all to enjoy. The special features are few but good and all the discs are hosted by Alf himself in his unique way. If you are a fan of Alf (or Garfield for that matter) this is a must in your collection. One of the greatest comedy series has arrived on DVD and those who buy this set will not be disappointed.

Hopefully there will be enough viewer response to cause Lions Gate to correct this season or at least make adjustments to any future releases. The entire DVD set seemed to be poorly put together, including the way the discs fit into the case. Two of my DVDs were loose in the package when I recieved it, and the overlapping format makes it difficult to switch discs.

The best way to shorten the life of a DVD is to keep flexing it each time you take it out of the case. These don't release easy - in fact we put them in other, more friendly cases.

2.  Do we REALLY need ALF to give us lessons on how to use the menus of the DVD?  This annoying banter is possibly funny the first time but you are subjected to it EVERY time you view the DVD!

2079717,5,B0002DB5N6,"I was about two or three years old when Alf just aired, I was a big fan, though...but that's all I can really remember, and that I had an Alf doll.

So when I watched the ""edited for syndication"" versions, I didn't notice the difference, since I hardly remembered the episodes themselves, and the only series my family has recorded in entirity is Star Trek: The Next Generation (and we're going to have to rely on those for quite some time, because the Season boxed sets are ridiculously overpriced), so I don't have the expectation of being able to replace anything like that.

I really liked what parts of the epsisodes were on the set, and I assume now that the one hour ""recap"" episode contained parts of scenes originally edited-out for syndication, because there's a part of the converstation in the jail cell scene that I didn't remember seeing before, so I guess that explains the mystery.

Another thing is that the recap episode also contained at least one scene from an episode that came after it on the DVD, which leads me to wonder if the episode actually aired before or after that one, and if they put them in the wrong order.

Sure, the whole having to use a menu thing to select the episodes is kind of annoying, but since Alf gives a little summary of each one, it's kind of neat, because I can return to the menu, select the summary (the audio's a bit delayed, though, it sometimes needs to be watched twice to hear eveything he says), and then watch the episode.

Also, there's outtakes (from all the four seasons, I'm assuming), and trivia facts, which are interesting, as well as the unaired pilot episode.

It would've been cool if they would have had some kind of feature on the Alf puppet, sure it would maybe shock and disillusion some younger new fans, but it's better that they find out he's just a puppet now. lol

I'd just love to know how the puppet works, I'm into this kind of special effects stuff.  I do know they had a stand-in (either a young child or some kind of midget) in a costume (it's painfully obvious, which is probably why they used it less and less as the series went on) to show Alf walking around.

Overall, I give it a five because the series is so incredibly funny, and gives me a feeling of nostalgia even though I really don't remember the individual episodes.",1092355200,5,2314,4.477434679334917
2079718,3,B0002DB5N6,"""ALF"" is an excellent television show, and its first season (which aired in 1986-87) was probably its best. The show takes a standard family sitcom premise and adds its delightfully loony twist: the Tanners, a typical American household, get an indefinite houseguest in the form of a furry, 3-foot creature from another planet. The planet is Melmac, and the alien is ALF, a sarcastic, and lovable little guy. The sitcom delivered interesting plots and no shortage of laughs, and it never needed to add objectional material, allowing it to excel at entertaining the whole family.

So, after all these years of the DVD industry thriving, and television sets being quite the hit, my dream of ""ALF"" on DVD in season sets finally has come true. I'd anticipated the release of this first season DVD set like few others, and when the day arrived, I made my trek to the store with excitement.

First, the good news. All twenty-five episodes from the wonderful debut season of the show are presented here, with commendable picture and sound quality, and chapter stops. The menus are hosted by ALF himself and are clever, easy to navigate, and remarkably amusing. There's even a few genuinely interesting bonus features on Disc 4, in the way of a Gag Reel, Trivia Facts, and an alternate pilot.

The bad news is, as a few other reviews have mentioned by now, is that the show is not presented in its original form. I thought that the 21-minute running times were a bit on the slight side, and it turns out that Lions Gate has released syndication edits of episodes, lopping off several minutes from each show. Why this decision was made, I have no idea. It's a terrible choice, and one which taints an otherwise delightful release. I was particularly troubled by ""Help Me, Rhonda"", one of my favorite episodes, which removes the Beach Boys song altogether through unusual editing and definitely changes the episode.

Now I must admit that even if I knew the episodes were trimmed I'd still have bought it. ""ALF"" isn't on the air anymore, so this edited DVD is the only realistic alternative for those of us who didn't make our own tapes. The DVD format allows us to instead have instant access to any episode and in a superb digital presentation.

I am sure that the complete episodes of the first season with music and all scenes intact will never see the light of day on DVD, so waiting for a correction is futile. Lions Gate has an opportunity to fix things for future season, but even if they do, that won't change the fact that they've taken ALF's best year and tainted its long, highly-anticipated DVD release. Surely, they'll lose some sales from those with strong enough wills to go without seeing the show. I love it too much to abstain altogether.

Anyway, you should know that as you look into buying the set. I didn't know and I am quite disappointed that this ""Complete First Season"" is not complete. Still, it's episodes of ""ALF"" on DVD, and that's not a bad thing. I only wish that this wonderful sitcom would have received more appropriate treament on this format.

5 stars for the show and maybe 2 for the DVD. Rounding down, that makes for a mediocre 3-star review for what should have been the easiest sitcom DVD to recommend.",1092355200,25,3235,4.684859154929577
2079719,3,B0002DB5N6,"If you've read the other reviews, you'll already know that the episodes on this disc are syndicated versions, not the original NBC ones.  That's a shame, as my wife and I watched the show since Day 1 (I'm 38 in 2004, you do the math).

It is nice to have them on DVD.  Would it have been better to have the original uncut ones?  Hell yeah.  But I'll take this.  I just hope that if the next seasons are released, that they don't use syndication.

The comments by Alf on the DVD menus are pretty funny, and the blooper reel is awesome (What the hell is that?  A plane?)  As a long time Alf fan, I'm glad to see these on DVD, but my excitement is tinged with disappointment over them being edited.

The DVD intros recorded by Alf are quite funny.  The bit about more FBI warnings made me laugh out loud, as did some of the blooper reel - to hear Alf (mildly) swear made me and my wife really laugh out loud).  The syndicated issue aside, the show is STILL damn funny - there's no getting around that issue.  :)

NOTE: There's a statement from Lion's Gate on why they have the syndicated versions over the originals online over at TVshowsondvd.com - look in their Alf section.",1092355200,53,1173,4.2727272727272725

We watch them to this day, and they are so worn out. We sat back while ""classic tv show"" after ""classic tv show"" got the DVD treatment except for one of our absolute favorites.

Now that it's finally here, we get chopped syndication versions??? Sure, you can say it's just a tv show, but when you're a big fan and know every episode you have by heart, it's hard not to notice a missing line of dialog here and there, and in some cases entire scenes.

I'm so angry about this. It's so unfair what they've done. The ONLY reason I'm giving this a five instead of a one is because I love the show so much.

I KNEW there had to be a reason for such a low price...you get what you pay for I guess, but I would have gladly paid 60 or 70 for the TRUE show I love, not the chopped versions that were made to fit more viagra ads in a half hour slot.

All I have to say is, everyone who's angry and surprised by this, spread the word and let the makers KNOW IT. Maybe if they get enough of a response they'll release it the way it SHOULD be, or at the very least not chop the remaining seasons.

***UPDATED***

Now that I've had a chance to watch it, I'll add on to my review from yesterday.

Well, I got my copy in the mail yesterday as I thought I would. I must say even though I am still angry and disappointed at the chopped versions, and the fact that about half the clips in the clip show ""Try To Remember"" are part of the mysterious redone voice/lines that an earlier reviewer mentioned, it made me so happy to have my favorite show back in watchable condition again. I'm just glad not every show was redone...not sure I could have handled such a core element being so different.

Unlike an earlier reviewer, I thought that the gag reel was quite funny, and I've already watched it twice. The different menu introductions on each disk are a nice touch, especially ALF's comment on disc 1:

""It's a good thing Melmacians live for 400 years, cause it took almost that long to get this DVD out."" Amen!

I'm also not impressed with the overlapping style of the disc case, I think that's a very poor element, especially when only one of the disk holders on each side actually allows the disc to be snapped into place. When it came in the mail the other two discs out of the four were just flopping loose inside the case....not good.

Overall, the show itself manages to shine through the disservices of poor packaging and syndication editing that were done to it. I still hope and pray that they will release it again with the full episodes, and not chop the remaining seasons, but it was still great to have the ol' Alfer back at least somewhat the way he used to be.",1092268800,18,2826,4.214814814814815
2079721,3,B0002DB5N6,"I have most every episode taped from the original NBC airings. I expected to be able to eliminate them from my ever-cluttered collection of stuff with the purchase of this long awaited set. Why Lions Gate chose to use edited syndication episodes completely baffles the imagination. Perhaps they plan on later releasing a ""Deluxe Edition"" so that the consumer will get hit twice to pay for the same product. The $40 list price should have more than adequately covered licensing the rights to the full episodes, but I guess there's no end to corporate greed.

I am stunned by the rave reviews of the Extras: 1) a short gag reel of which only about 15% is funny, 2) some brief trivia screens which is mostly made up of obvious facts that any fan of the show already knows (like A.L.F. stands for Alien Life Form, for example), and 3) credits screens - credits for the DVD authoring is now considered a bonus extra?!?! Sheesh! Would have made better sense to have included some of the best ALF bits from Hollywood Squares, or even included some of the many commercials ALF has appeared in over the years. Or interviews with the cast reflecting on being a part of the show.

The omission of a feature to play all of the episodes on a disc is simply appalling. Interactive is nice, but can you imagine an audio CD in which you have to select each song separately? Adding this feature would have taken the authors mere minutes to code. I just don't get it.

Rather than deluxe packaging, like you get with most TV series box sets, a clamshell case crams in the four discs in a clunky, overlapping layout. No book, either, just a single sheet listing the discs and episodes, and a slipcover for the case. I've seen public domain sets packaged better.

I'm not sure if the picture quality is due to the original source or not, so I'll reserve judgement on that. Just don't touch the Zoom button because the artifacting from the low bitrate encoding is completely useless. Even still frames in normal mode look bumpy. No other TV series sets in my collection have these problems. How could so many elements get overlooked?

The three stars are for the episodes themselves, which are priceless. A smart, funny, irreverent sitcom that eclipsed ""Mork and Mindy"", which aired opposite ALF on rival network ABC. I still laugh out loud every time I view this wonderful series. The disc introductions by the ol' ALFer himself are quite amusing in their own respect and deserve to be a part of a package that was created with more care, passion, and respect to the fans of the series.",1092182400,64,2566,4.606126914660831

The animated menus are fantastic, and if you're an ALF fan, edited or otherwise, I advise you get the set. Sure it's a downer. But you shouldn't complain. Just be happy you got ALF on DVD at all.
