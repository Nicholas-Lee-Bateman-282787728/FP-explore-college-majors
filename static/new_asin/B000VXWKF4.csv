8220515,4,B000VXWKF4,"This is the quirkiest movie I have ever watched, but having said that, I enjoyed it! I love anything knitting related so I started out biased, I admit, but the story drew me in. The sisters are oddly charming; they are organized hoarders who catalog their scavenged finds. The knitting girl upsets their routine and her story takes an interesting turn. I liked the mix of real and fantasy. This movie probably wouldn't appeal to everyone, but if you are  a knitting fanatic, as I am, and if you like gentle movies from a different cultural perspective, this one might appeal to you.",1436313600,,582,4.650485436893204
8220516,4,B000VXWKF4,"As previous reviewers have noted, this is one very weird film ... but it's weird in a very good way, a modern fusion between fairy tale and Surrealist storytelling. And while it begins in a disorienting fashion, eventually it all comes together in a skillfully woven narrative, one that never loses its dreamlike quality even when most of the puzzle pieces have fallen into place. The writer/director is too smart to make it airtight & completely logical. This is dream logic, where everything makes sense, if you don't try too hard to make everything fit just right.

As to the story itself: it's told in the form of a fairy tale, combining live action, animation, and puppetry to reveal psychological truths in a fractured form, often out of sequence. Two elderly sisters make a daily ritual of scouring the neighborhood for junk, which they take home, lovingly catalog in hand-drawn books, and cherish as friends with feelings who watch over them. But one day, a cache of bright red yarn brings with it a strange girl, one who knits the yarn into a sweater, then screams that it has to be knit all over again, then unravels it, and begins anew.

While none of this makes sense at first, there's a firm hand behind the scenes. Gradually a tragic story of arrested childhood & deep loss begins to unfold, and we realize that we're seeing into the shared psyche of the two sisters, where the mysterious girl obsessed with knitting is clearly both mother & unborn sister. It's no accident that the endless yarn is red, the color of blood, birth, sexuality. Like all genuine fairy tales, the film deals with intense adult themes on a child's level.

As I said, everything isn't wrapped up neatly by the end. A brief scene early in the film suggests that the two sisters may well be ghosts. And where are they going as the film ends? Wisely, none of this is explained, at least not on a logical, conscious level. The meaning is felt & experienced, rather than explicated in words that might dissipate the power of the gorgeous, often frenetic imagery. While not for every taste, this is a genuinely fresh & absorbing film that makes me want more from its creator -- most highly recommended!",1396742400,2,2187,4.675324675324675

8220518,4,B000VXWKF4,"I spent the first 25 or 30 minutes of this movie in an advanced state of WTF.  But it drew me in.  Trying to work out what was happening and why and what might happen next was mezmerizing.  Some scenes I still haven't figured out. But I loved it and ended the film with a big smile on my face.

I'd give it five stars for entertainment but I took one away for sheer oddity.",1246406400,2,373,3.933333333333333
8220519,5,B000VXWKF4,"OK, after the worthless 1-star review by the guy who got a bad DVD, I thought I'd chime in about the actual movie...

I'm so glad Amazon has this so I can order it, I want my family to see it.  It's a pretty lively flick, but really, really weird.  It's not going to be for everyone, it's quirky rather than horror or action, with some rather bittersweet moments.

It's the story of 2 very strange old ladies who wall themselves off from life with their ever-growing collection of found junk.  One day though they collect the wrong thing and it has a young girl attached, who enters their home and their lives and endless ruckus ensues.  Bit by bit the old ladies are reminded of what young girls are like and recall that they too were once that way.  It's a charming, cute, sweet (mostly) journey of ravelings and unravelings, and it really tickled the heck out of me to watch it.

So... it's not gonna change your life, it won't make or break your movie watching career.  But it's a really cute, fun movie with lots of little surprises, and very heartwarming.  But weird!",1238457600,5,1073,4.428571428571429
8220520,2,B000VXWKF4,"This is a very odd movie. No real story, just a series of happenings that are strange.  Lots of unanswered questions... Worth $9 just to see an odd movie...",1223769600,,156,4.379310344827586
8220521,1,B000VXWKF4,"I purchased this dvd to send to a friend in another city. He has since told me the dvd was stuck in the case, as if the plastic of the case had fused with the dvd.  He was unable to remove it from the case.  Eventually the dvd cracked and was unreadable.  I am very sorry this happened, but I don't think I will order another dvd right now.",1207785600,,340,3.898550724637681
8220522,5,B000VXWKF4,"Offbeat and original (mostly live action) film by a Japanese animator. It is essentially atmospheric with very little plot or dialog. Two elderly sisters (who could have been created by Beckett) collect junk and fill their house with their finds. One day they find a bunch of red wool and take it home not realizing that a little girl is literally and metaphorically attached to it. She intrudes into their home and knits, destroys, and reknits herself a sweater/dress... and changes their lives. That's pretty much it but you have to see it to be cast under its spell.",1200009600,9,569,4.757575757575758
