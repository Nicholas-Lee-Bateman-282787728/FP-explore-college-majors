8388119,5,B0033XKVBY,"If you like Manowar, if you had been in one or more of their concerts, this is a must for you. I acquired it to see me on video, but were astonished by the whole DVD. Great. Can't feel the 131+db they bring live, but in a good HTS you can enjoy the power of this band. Long live Metal!!!",1302566400,,287,3.8
8388120,4,B0033XKVBY,"Manowar: Hell On Earth V is an awesome addition to the Hell On Earth series.......if you loved ""God's Of War"", you will like this 2 DVD set. Manowar show no signs of aging or slowing down...they are still the ""Kings Of Metal"" and continue to enjoy what they are doing. Original drummer Donnie Hamzik is featured on many songs due to the sad passing of Scott Columbus, and is still in great form.
DVD 1 is the clear winner here...., DVD 2 with all the bonus footage is O.K.but Dvd 1 is the real deal!. I wasn't sure if they could pull it off live, because some of the new songs are very complex, but they did a fantastic  job, as usual...and most songs play all the way through, without irritating interuptions....
4 Stars! Manowar Kills!",1293321600,,737,4.419117647058823
8388121,5,B0033XKVBY,"Little more can be said about Manowar.....This is one bombastic, over the top, in true Manowar style, concert. A Concert DVD not to be missed....",1275091200,,145,4.84
8388122,3,B0033XKVBY,"I bought this dvd because I really would like to watch these songs in a live performance.

And they deliver this, which is good!

But apart from that, there is nothing new... the girls, bikes, neverending speeches (fake speeches) will be there as usual...

At least the songs are great!! I like GODS OF WAR a lot.. so, for me, this a good DVD (for the songs)

But if you have every Manowar DVD... there is nothing new here!!!

Bye",1274140800,,430,4.325
