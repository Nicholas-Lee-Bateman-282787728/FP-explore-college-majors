8746396,5,B01A1L9TCM,"Grigory Sokolov has an unique sound that I enjoy most of any living pianist. There are many pianists with great technique, but Sokolov conveys a special feeling that other pianists do not convey.. He is  sui generis - one of a kind. The DG recording and video are superb.

I was not aware of Sokolov  until recently. He was unanimously awarded the gold medal at the 1976 Tchaikovsky Competition when he was 16 years old. I had previously associated the Tchaikovsky Competition with Van Cliburn, Ashkenazy and Matsuev.  Sokolov only recently started recording for a major label which has increased his visibility in the U.S. Although I missed him for almost 40 years, I am fortunate that I can now enjoy him.",1470009600,4,707,4.770491803278689

8746399,5,B01A1L9TCM,"Great, great playing.  The closest thing to the quality of playing one saw from Arrau.  Unfortunately, the tempos in the Hammerklavier are just unsustainable for the listener, but it's still magnificent music-making and playing.  A little aggravating with the distance of some of the camerawork, but it's a program i will see many times.",1460419200,4,337,5.203703703703703
