8332731,1,B001P9V94Q,"I ordered this from the UK as it is not available there mainly because of all the rave reviews. However I have discovered that it is the auteur himself who is writing these 5 star reviews. The film is simply awful beyond belief. I have not the words to describe how bad this film is. From the orange sepia filter that has been put on everything to hide bad sets and art direction to the laughable dialog that would have a porn film director hang his head in shame, one wonders what Anthony Quinn was doing in this vanity project. My guess is that he was so old and sick that he was happy to take any work especially if it paid well. I also imagine that this man Shokof was wealthy enough to offer him a hefty fee. There is a weird homoerotic threrad in the film which if the director was honest enough could have evolved into a Derek Jarman, Kenneth Anger type thing but the film is so pretentious that any redeeming feature is deeply buried. Simply vile!",1348876800,2,955,4.281767955801105
8332732,3,B001P9V94Q,"To call this film, one of Anthony Quinn's last, strange would be an understatement. A dying man hires four handsome young men (white, black, Asian, and Indian) to literally plug up his ears and nose constantly (yes, eating, sleeping, excreting, etc.) for ten days, in the hope not only of becoming more aware of his surroundings by blocking out extraneous sounds and smells, but also of being able to assimilate the energies of these young men. More of a philosophical treatise than anything else, not all of it makes sense (yes, there is the final orifice, the mouth, ultimately plugged by death, the fifth servant [kiss of death, get it?], and the woman who seems to be the literal servant (the sixth), but who is the seventh servant - the man who pops up juggling every now and then?). The film is co-directed by the cinematographer and art director/set designer, and it certainly shows in the sumptuous sets and photography. It sounds silly and often looks silly to see Quinn being literally connected to the four men, with fingers in his ears and nose, yet I ultimately found it oddly compelling. Definitely worth a try if you're in the mood for something very different.",1341360000,2,1176,4.769607843137255
8332733,5,B001P9V94Q,"I've been mulling over the prospect of writing a review of this movie for months. Despite the overwhelming impression the movie made on me, I could not find the words I felt properly express the movie's essence.

First things first. Anthony Quinn gives a flawless performance as Archie, a rich old man who is seeking both an experience of the oneness of all things, and a graceful way to die. At no time does he give the impression that he wants to die; but he knows it is close, and he accepts it, wishing only that death is meaningful. At turns he is powerful, wise, sad, vulnerable, and hilariously funny.

The film was narrated by one of the seven servants; the first to answer Archie's ad. He was paid $10,000 to insert his left index finger into Archie's right ear, and keep it there for ten days. The narrator was describing the events years after the fact, when he himself was on his deathbed.

By turns, other servants arrived, and inserted fingers into his ears and nostrils. Granted; the idea is a little bizarre! But this is only the surface appearance. The idea was unity, the unity of all things and all beings. And the transference of energy: life energy. The ultimate act of sharing.

The visual imagery of the film is striking. There is fruit everywhere; sometimes floating in the air. Archie's house is a beautiful mansion.

The music, composed and performed by Gato Barbieri, was marvelous on its own; and underscored the plot and imagery perfectly.

The first indication of death comes in the guise of ""The Mysterious Stranger"", an opera singer played by Audra McDonald. In fact, I believe her real character in this movie was the angel of death. She would sing, and Archie would begin to die. But that would come only after he had completed his quest for unity.

In fact, Archie's death was beautiful.

This, as I understand it, was Anthony Quinn's last movie. It is both revolting and somehow fitting that Quinn's final film role was in a masterpiece of a film that was largely overlooked by the public. To be sure, he deserved much better for this great performance.

I just re-read what I wrote. I'm glad that amazon.com allows customers to edit reviews in the future. ""Seven Servants"" is one of those films I imagine I will keep finding new facets of beauty and meaning in. This will not be my last word on it.",1264636800,4,2335,4.607228915662651
