The Mortal Storm? (1940)

thanks",1077494400,,124,4.9523809523809526
565629,5,6303120490,"THE MORTAL STORM is an excellent movie about the early days of Nazi oppression. The film is adapted from a book by Phyllis Bottome.
The story concerns a young couple played by James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan who attempt to flee Germany to Austria on skis after Hitler gains power in 1933. The acting by Stewart and Sullivan is superb. A Strong supporting cast includes Robert Young, Frank Morgan, Robert Stack and Bonita Granville. Frank Borzage is known for directing many other fine movies including A FAREWELL TO ARMS.",1059696000,2,525,4.910112359550562
565630,4,6303120490,"When THE MORTAL STORM was released in 1940, the war in Europe had been going on for nearly one year.  Americans were well aware that one country after another was being gobbled up by the Nazi war machine. Hollywood had just started to get into the act of alerting the collective consciousness of America that Nazism was a brute force that they would have to face soon enough.  Director Frank Borzage pictured a Nazi state that had just recently converted from the anarchy of the Weimar republic to the viciousness of Hitler's National Socialism.  Nowhere in the film does he identify this country as Germany (thus rendering it a patina of political allegory), but no American with an ounce of intelligence could have missed that.  This Germany of the film seems to have been run more by the brown-shirted toughs of the Sturmabteilungen (SA) than by the black-leathered Shutzstaffel (SS).  The focus is on two sets of characters. The first includes the Germans who were staunchly anti-Nazi.  James Stewert and Margaret Sullavan play doomed lovers who see the approach of the coming storm but cannot escape its fatal embrace.  The second focuses on Germans who embrace this new Nazi idelogy.  Robert Young, Robert Stack, and Ward Bond wear the swastika armband proudly and seek to root out all enemies of the state.  The dramatic center of the movie is squarely placed on Stewart's and Sullavan's ski slope slide for freedom towards the then free state of Austria.  He makes it alive but she does not.
  What makes THE MORTAL STORM still watchable despite its failure to more emphatically identify the source of the geographical infection is its willingness to put a face on both pursued and pursuer such that a dash for freedom toward Austria, a country that was soon to be assimilated, could show once again that any flight from despotism might save those who are fleeing, but does nothing for those unlucky enough not to have a ready pair of skis and slopes handy.",1027296000,3,1965,4.815476190476191
565631,5,6303120490,"Frank Borzage's 1940 masterpiece ""The Mortal Storm"" was one of the very first ""Anti-Nazi"" films Hollywood has produced during WW2.
Despite the fact that ""The Mortal Storm"" may seem a little bit dated, if not obscure nowadays (always keep in mind this movie features Jimmy Stewart playing a German small town boy!) it nevertheless tells its story with great careness and even greater characterizations, establishing its director, Frank Borzage, as one of the most underrated filmmakers of all time!
Like so many other Hollywood pros from the golden age, like say Michael Curtiz, Raoul Walsh or Howard Hawks, Borzage was one of the key directors who deeply felt for the characters in their movies and who were able to tell a story ""straight forward"", in a very own and unique kind of way.
Borzage was also a master of the ""mise en scene"": You only have to watch the camera movements in the ""taverne"" scenes, and/or the ""diner"" scenes in the professor's house. Especially the last big scene (my favorite in the whole movie!), when Margaret Sullivan's brother realises how evil the seed has already grown, he turns his face aside, walks behind (!) the camera, the camera takes his place and moves slowly through the professor's house, rests from time to time at various objects and interiors, while voice overs from the main characters are reminding us of the story's most significant events that took place earlier in these rooms and these locations (like the diner scene mentioned above, in which Stack asked for the hand of the professor's daughter, and were they first heard of the news that Hitler took over) and of happier days long gone now (the statue that was handed out to the professor as a birthday present through two of his students). These moments are cinema in its purest form. Really mesmerizing! And when Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan were heading for the Austrian border, spirits of the legendary final scenes from Jean Renoir's ""Grand Illusion"" come to mind! This says a lot about Frank Borzage's attitude and that was the league he actually played in.",1016496000,19,2074,4.894886363636363
565632,5,6303120490,"I first saw this movie 30 years ago, on late night tv, and it was never televised ever again. It pretty much bugged me because I couldn't remember the title, due to the fact that I started watching it ten minutes into the story.
Great movie, 5-star rating easy....

565633,5,6303120490,"This gripping story begins on the the eve of Hitler being named as chancellor in 1933, in a small town at the foot of the German Alps...and how it affects a non Aryan family, and their courageous friend, a veterinarian, played by James Stewart in a wonderful, warm and winning performance...Maria Ouspenskaya is also memorable in the role of his mother.
It's surprising that this film isn't more well known. It has a fascinating cast, and the story keeps one's interest in every scene. The cinematography is excellent, especially towards the end, in a chase scene on skis.
Sad and tender, intense and so well acted, it's a tale that honors freedom of thought and individuality...and shouldn't be missed.",995500800,36,703,4.915966386554622
565634,5,6303120490,"My kids love Jimmy Stewart from It's A Wonderful Life and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, so based on Amazon customer reviews I brought this one home. I had never heard of it, but we all agree this is a classic movie. Very subtle and interesting themes surrounding this horrible situation. The movie has many terrific performances and overall presents a compelling drama that educated my kids better than most history books ever could.",980726400,4,433,4.864864864864865
565635,5,6303120490,"MGM openly declared it's personal war on Hitler's Third Reich by producing this powerful film. Though the movie deals with the rise of the Nazi regime in the early thirties, it nevertheless scathingly profiles the hideous tyranny Hitler and his fellow thugs practised over once-civilised Germany. Margaret Sullavan, slender and special, is very believable as the young woman who dies rather than yield to the Nazi philosophy. Stack is quite surprisingly good as the older step-brother who realizes that the path he's chosen is crooked. Granted, the movie is pure propaganda, yet the leads play with undiminished vigour.",947116800,3,619,5.326530612244898
565636,5,6303120490,"No one who has lived in this century should avoid conducting a serious reflection on whether or not he or she would have had the courage to recognize and oppose trends of profound evilness, within their  civilization, had they lived in Nazi Germany prior to World War II. The  Mortal Storm provides one with such an opportunity. The film, produced in  1940, is not in any way limited by being mindful of its wartime anti-nazi  message. This is melodrama at its finest, no mere propaganda film. The film  is set in an alpine, university town in southern Germany near the Austrian  border. It opens on the occasion of the celebration of the sixtieth  birthday of a universally revered science professor at both his university  and later at his home. His three stepsons, although respectful of his  humanitarianism, are more swept up by the promises a Nazi Germany holds for  their youthful, male vanities. The professor, his wife, his daughter Freya  (Margaret Sullavan), and family friend Martin (Jimmy Stewart) demonstrate  an unhappy skepticism towards this regime, and this becomes the basis for  evolving tensions which are not explored by deep philosophy but in  melodramatic ways that are not always predictable, and very moving even  when you know they're coming. When the nationalistic disloyalties of Martin  and Freya become established, they are forced to seek an escape, their  romantic interest having been nurtured by their mutual respect for each  other's courage confronting the evil of escalating nazi sentiment. The  blessing they receive from Martin's mother prior to their departure is one  of the most poignant scenes in film history. This wartime film has the rare  grace of not demonizing the whole of German culture and tradition for the  mass moral insanity that frequently envelops all civilizations and requires  a rarefied courage to resist. The English speaking cast does not subtract  from the sense of alpine authenticity, and the overriding decency of his  character, a Stewart trademark, enables the viewer to ignore Stewart's  inability to shed his Midwestern accent for the role. It amuses rather than  distracts. Except for Stewart's more famous film, It's a Wonderful Life,  melodrama doesn't get any better than this.",917827200,13,2254,5.1689750692520775
565753,5,6303120490,"This is a scary film from the 1940s that resonates in 2017. It features Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan trying to navigate the rise of Nazi Germany. It starts with a normal everyday life, and slowly horrible things occur. A kind professor they love is taken away and disappears. People get confrontational in social settings. You cannot be outraged, or disagree - or you disappear too. Finally, Stewart and Sullavan have to take a stand. Excellent movie with a shock at the end.",1490140800,,482,4.819277108433735
565754,5,6303120490,"Excellent Pre-War II drama during Hitler's rise to power in Germany and his effect on those who want to follow him, and the few who choose not to fall for Nazism. James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan are two who choose not to stay in the rising Nazi Germany and plan to escape going over the Alps by ski into Austria. The family of Sullivan, all but her and her father, and James Stewart, go over to the dark side of Nazism.

The movie climaxes when Stewart and Sullivan ski dowp the Alps for safety and freedom while they are being pursued by the Nazis, who includes Sullivan's brothers.

It should be noted that when this movie was made, Hitller panned the movie as just propanda to hide the misdeeds he and his Party were doing to the people.",1490140800,,744,4.384057971014493

565876,5,6303120490,"Thrilled with this awesome film. The viewing quality looks great to me.

Margaret Sullavan took Jimmy Stewart under her wing and made him a better actor. Such overall great performances by everyone in this film.

This is Hollywood at its best as they took on the subject of fascism and handled with class and nobility. The movie is so timely considering what is happening in our world and country at present.

Robert Stack, Ward Bond, Robert Young, and Dan Dailey all made such rabid and fanatical nazis. Frank Morgan who played the Fatherly professor did an amazing job as did Maria Ouspenskaya who played Stewart's loving Mother.

For me though, it is all about Margaret Sullavan and her brilliant performance. She turns me on, I'm a radio so I cannot be impartial in my review and I don't want to be. The movie 'The Shop Around The Corner' is another fine film with Sullavan and Stewart and I highly recommend that one also.

I give the 'Mortal Storm' my highest recommendation.",1424131200,4,981,4.713450292397661
565877,5,6303120490,"I'm giving the movie 5 stars with consideration to the era it was made. It's not the same quality as a recent movie, but the message and story are clear and important (who doesn't love Jimmy Stewart?). The theme is uncomfortably familiar as it resonates changes we're seeing in our modern society. My teen-agers were quick to pick up on the similarities and think it should be shown in high school history class.

565960,5,6303120490,"The Mortal storm was released in 1940, before the United States entered the war and a few movie studio's wanted to encourage America's entrance in the war.  It was made before Germany took over Austria.  This why certain characters flee to Austria to escape the Naz's.  James Stewart is a young man who's Friendship the Roth family puts him at odds with some of his friends, who join the Nazi party.  You may be surprised to see various actors take on the role of Nazi's including Robert Young, TV's Doctor Welby, Robert Stack, TV Elliot Ness, and TV's wagon Master, Ward Bond.  Although the Word Jew is not used, it is implied that Professor Roth is a Jew.  Frank Morgan is brilliant as Professor Roth.  The story starts as Hitler and his Party come to power and we see people change as the Nazi's take over everything. The story is well told and the movie is well directed.  The movie is chilling because we now know what happened to Germany and Austria and the outcome of the war.  You want to yell at  Stewart, ""Don't go to Austria.""  When the death of Professor Roth is announced to his family they are told he died of a heart ailment.  This was a common excuse used by the Nazi's for those who died under interrogation before the war.

The story line is not too far off from some of what happened in Germany in the 30s, although I think the timeline is a little off. But, the basic gist of what was going on in Germany was not real far off.

This story is about students attending University that are suddenly swept up by the movement when Hitler comes to power.
Most of them will fall in step with the propaganda and the story revolves around Jimmy Stewart's refusal to join the Nazi party.
His love is Margaret Sullivan (Freya) who is engaged to marry Robert Young's character. She turns on him when he announces he is loyal to the party. He is not the same man she fell in love with, and Freya turns to Jimmy Stewart who was really her first love and he and his mother are very close to her. It's really a sad story about Jews being persecuted against and Freya's father (Frank Morgan) is the University Professor that will be taken away because of his religious beliefs.

Although it was made before things really started to peak in Germany and the surrounding countries were invaded by the Nazi regime, it shows how quickly people can turn on one another because they have different views of what they think is a better way to live and how certain segments of a population should be treated. It is showing the prelude of what was to come even before anyone, other than the people in charge, knew what was in their future and the bleak times so many would face.

The movie starts off corny, but it was made in an age when language and symbols were different from the ones we use today.  The effects are definitely primitive by today's standards, but we cannot judge the films of the past by the standards of today -- too many people make that mistake, and dismiss older work when they should take a deeper look at it, using the standards of the work's own time.

Once the film got rolling, I got caught up in the characters and what was happening to them.  Considering some of the forces at work in the US these days, groups who want to marginalize, and even criminalize, those who are different from them, this film is relevant today in its message.  Eternal vigilance is indeed the price of liberty.

Of the cast, James Stewart joined the Army Air Corps in World War II, and after a distinguished career, retired a brigadier general in the Air Force, and Robert Stack joined the Navy as a commissioned officer and based on his considerable ability as a marksman, served as an aerial gunnery instructor at Jacksonville Naval Air Station, Florida (where my father was the lead flight instructor).

However, the print from Warner Archives is horrible. I was excited at being able to get some movies that were not on DVD before through warner archives and made the mistake of ordering 4 films. I already had 3 on VHS, but wanted them on DVD.

One of my purchases is The Mortal Storm - a great WWII drama.  THis is one of Jimmy Stewart's finest films, despite being lessor known by some causal fans and its unfortunate that Warner doesn't see fit to give it a proper release.  Unfortunately, the Warner Archive release picture quality is probably worse then then my VHS tape and is clearly MUCH worse then the print quality you would see when the Turner Classic movie channel plays it on TV from time to time.  While the picture quality of the Mortal Storm was slightly better then Mr. Lucky (another great film -lousy transfer, that I also reviewed), it is far below what a film of this quality deserves.

It is disgraceful not only for Warner to be giving such crappy transfers to great films, but it is equally disgraceful to charge classic movie fans for films that have worse print quality then what the would see on TV when TCM plays the films and even worse then the old VHS tape was!!!

I've still got around 200 classic films on VHS and another 500 or so classics now on DVD/Blu-Ray, however I will NOT be purchasing any more Warner Classic films, even though there were around 50 or 60 titles I was interested in picking up - many of which I used to have on VHS and some that weren't available on VHS before.

It begins at Adolph Hitler's rise to power in the early 30's and the advent of the Hitler movement in the Universities.  Though never mentioned by name and treated quite kindly, it shows the beginning of the purging of the Jews.

Thoughts and opinions and loyalties are challenged.  Those who disagree are ostracized and beaten and jailed.  Families and lifelong friends are torn apart and turn on one another.

Everywhere is fear and anger.  Any slight difference of opinion is seen as a threat to the state and is harshly punished.  The political tone is so toxic that people begin the attempts at fleeing their country.

It is brilliantly acted by the young James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan and Robert Young and by the veteran Frank Morgan.

This film deserves commentaries, documentaries about it etc, surely there must have been much controversy when the film was made. A fascinating story to be told today.  There can be few films of the fourties that have remained  as potent and relevant today as this film does. When one considers this film was made before the scourge of the Nazis in Germany had even become evident to a lot of people.. Unlike the recently released ""Escape"" which covers the same period, this film  suffers from none of the over acting and hamminess in both story and characterisation. I look at this film now and it stands up today as both a brave and historical masterpiece . Just look at a few things about it; Frank Morgan gives the best performance of his career, Robert Young and Robert Stack epitomise evil in all its extreme right wing forms (some things don't change), the female hero dies tragically and shockingly , there are no happy tidy endings here. James Stewart's performance has a quiet majesty that was rarely matched in any of his other films of the period.

Solid, spectacular film making that deserved an Oscar. Films of this period are mostly overwrought and sentimental today, despite the acclaim of their day. This film soars with greatness and does not age.

For a studio known for emphasizing the ""Gloss"" treatment in their productions, MGM here has shows a rare,and uncompromising faithfulness to what was VERY potent subject matter at the time. It is NO Wonder ALL MGM films were banned in Germany after this one, for the remainder of the war!!

This is easily Frank Morgan's FINEST performance;Noble and powerfully understated, It seems somewhat shortchanging to him that he's been immortalized for his more blustery role in ""The Wizard Of Oz"".

And it's interesting to note, that the main ""Star"", James Stewart's character, actually disappears for the MOST of the last half of the film; I think this was an unusually admirable choice for the studio to make, in keeping the fabric of the film flowing as smoothly as possible, since more often than not,the studio would insist that the star's part be pumped up to give him/her more screen time bang for the buck.",1278979200,6,1075,4.677248677248677
566308,5,6303120490,"When I first saw this movie as a junior high school student in the mid 1960s I confess that I wept at the movies climax and ending and simultaneously got a serious adolescent crush on Magaret Sullivan which lasted a long time. She is one of the great actresses of American film and her voice is absolutely unique - light,tremulous and expressive, like no other.

There are some films you see and never forget and this is one of them. The Mortal Storm was made in 1940, over 18 months before the U.S went to war. Its depiction of the Nazis is not over the top evil or cartoonish - it is chilling and terrifying. It was also a brave film for MGM to make in 1940 - so much for the MGM image of only making nice, safe, family pictures.

The movie depicts the intrusion of the Nazi totalitarian state in 1933 {in a small university town} into an German upper middle class family that will divide and destroy it. Hitler comes to power at the moment that Professor Roth {Frank Morgan} is celebrating his 60th birthday with his wife, step sons, son, daughter {Margaret Sullivan} and friendly rivals for Freya - Jimmy Steward {Martin Breitner} and Robert Young {Fritz Marburg}.

While Professor Roth is toasting his families humor and tolerance you can see the family and friends dividing as the radio blares the news of Hiltler gaining power while the birthday cake is being cut. Professor Roth is a renowed / distingished  professor who is Jewish {in the movie ""Non Aryan""} and the gradual descent from ostracism in the town/university, to a student boycott of his classes to broken inmate in a concentration camp is exrcruciatingly painfull to watch. While he is Jewish, his wife and older stepsons are not while his daughter and son are 1/2 Jewish. These facts immediate target the family to the local Nazi party boss and his thugs.

The movie depicts the entire Nazi horror - the burning of books by students, the co-opting of the young into the party, the brownshirted stormtroopers beating up anyone who is different, the mindless conformism and cultivation of hardness and devotion of duty to the state above all else. Jimmy Steward gives a strong and sensitive performance as the lone hold out amoung the friends in joining the Nazi party because he values his right to think and speak freely. Robert Young is surprisingly effective as an earnest conformist and opportunist who joins the Nazis for power and loses Freya to Martin as a result. Frank Morgan gives one of his best performances at first proud, then bewildered and finally crushed and broken professor - seeing him shuffle into the waiting area of the concentration camp for a last meeting with his wife {Irene Rich} is heartbreaking.

The Roth family flees to Austria after one of Roth's stepsons {a young Robert Stack}who is now a Nazi Brownshirt who informs the his mother and Freya of Professor Roth's death telling them that he is ""finally free"". Freya is prevented from leaving Germany with her mother and brother because of a treatise on science and bloodtypes written by her father that she was taking with her for sentmental reasons. This document is contrary to Nazi ideology and as a result she is forbidden to leave Germany and her passport is confiscated. This leads to the climax of the film where Martin with and Freya attempt to reach Austria thru a pass in deep snow using ski's thru the mountains in a trail known only to Martin.

The Brownshirts/Nazis discover the plan and Fritz is exhorted and shamed by the local Nazi leader to do his duty and hunt them down without mercy. By using automobiles the squad reachs the area where  Freya and Martin to reach Austria have to emerge into the open and while Martin and Freya are making a mad dash sking down the mountain, Freya is shot and dies even as they have made it to freedom.

While breaking the news to Freya' brothers Fritz with false bravado claims that he had ""no choice"" but to give the order to shoot at them and ""do his duty"" !! The marvelous Maria Ouspenskaya plays Jimmy Steward's mother and her scene with them toasting to their future happiness with the Brides cup knowing she will never see them again is as heartbreaking a scene and performance that I have ever watched in a film.

Frank Borzage does a masterfull job in directing the film. I haven't 1/2 described the one after another great individual set-piece scenes in the movie that he infuses with his special directorial touch. Frank Morgan's performance will be a revelation to those viewers only familar with his dithering ""Professor Marvel"" in the Wizard of Oz - showing what a fine serious actor he could be. Margaret Sullivan's touching and glowing performance that mixes vunerability and strenght is the heart of a movie that after 70 + years is still powerfull, disturbing and revelant. I give this movie 5 stars and my strongest recommendation to add it to your film library.",1276560000,30,4888,4.693115519253209
566309,5,6303120490,"The Mortal Storm is one of the very few films to depict the evils of Nazism before the United States entered the war; and it certainly is a message film as well. Although the film is obviously designed to encourage people to support American involvement in World War Two, it never gets preachy nor does it have any silly moments that are saccharine. Indeed, the script was very well written; the casting was excellent and the acting was very convincing. The choreography and the cinematography work wonders for the film although you will notice that a few of the outdoor background scenes do appear to be manufactured or even painted and not real outdoor shots of southern Germany where this story takes place.

The action starts on an auspicious day for the Roth family; Professor Viktor Roth (Frank Morgan) is celebrating his 60th birthday. The family lavishes him with gifts and there are many gifts and cards in the mail as well. His two stepsons give him books he has been looking for and his daughter is only too happy to give him a scarf as well. There's even a surprise party for Viktor when he gets to his classroom at the college where he teaches.

Unfortunately, however, the family's happiness doesn't last long. That very evening Hitler is elected Chancellor of Germany; and the conflict that will tear the family apart immediately ensues. Viktor's two stepsons are only too eager to join the Nazi party and they relish war to get Germany in control of the world again (as Fritz Marberg, played to perfection by Robert Young, boasts) while Viktor, his wife, their daughter Freya (Margaret Sullavan) and their friend Martin Breitner (James Stewart) aren't so sure that this will be the best path for Germany to follow.

And the conflicts only get worse as the months pass. We see Nazis burning books by Einstein and they beat up an elderly teacher who refuses to sing along in their song praising their new leader and The Third Reich. Even Fritz and Freya begin to have serious difficulties; they had planned on getting married but Freya is not longer certain she loves Fritz as he becomes more and more involved with the new order. Martin begins to hope that perhaps Freya, the woman he's always loved, will want to marry him instead of Fritz although Martin's too gentlemanly to make his intentions for Freya known. There's even great, great trouble for the now formerly beloved Professor Viktor Roth.

The plot can still go in several different directions. Which man will Freya choose to be her husband? How exactly is the Roth family torn irreparably apart when politics comes between them and their happiness together as a family? No spoilers here--watch and find out!

The Mortal Storm is a very engaging film and I was never once bored. I highly recommend this film for anyone studying World War Two or the history of Nazism; and fans of the actors in this movie would do well to add this to their collections.",1274486400,6,2929,4.735294117647059

There are lots of absolute gems that modern classic-movie buffs often miss, for whatever reason---""Mortal Storm"" doesn't often show up on the lists of usual must-sees, but it should. This picture is chillingly real---even with the MGM treatment, it's a realistic portrayal of what the horrors of World War II did to nice, decent, everyday people. It's tragic, but so well acted that you can't take your eyes off it. Margaret Sullavan was a huge star in the 30's and 40's, and this role shows her at her best. The lady had talent, and she will take you on a roller-coaster ride of emotions.
Perennially reliable Jimmy Stewart is fine as the principled young man who loves her despite being in mortal danger.  Frank Morgan turns in his usual top-quality support as Sullavan's stepfather, and--surprise--you'll end up hating good old ""Father Knows Best""/""Marcus Welby"" star Robert Young. If you have any love of good classic film at all--do not miss this.",1263859200,61,1029,4.913793103448276

566381,4,6303120490,"""The Mortal Storm"" is a movie that predates America's entry into WWII.  It is based on a book that was published the year before the war began in Europe.  It tells the story of a Bavarian family and their mixed relationship with the Nazi party.  Within this family and their close associates, is a mixed opinion of the Nazi party.  Some were hard-core adherents and others either ignored or disagreed with its' totalitarian stance.  The film suffers somewhat by not exploring the rationale behind the near-fanatical supporters.  One day they're classmates and after Hitler is elected Chancellor of Germany, they are uniformed thugs.  Maybe I missed ""The Prenatal Storm"" but I found it hard to make the transistion.  Oh well, much of Germany, Europe and the rest of the world probably felt the same way.  That isn't the point to ""The Mortal Storm"".

The essence of ""The Mortal Storm"" is its' excellent depiction of how mob rule can intimidate freedom of speech.  Once freedom of speech is repressed, anything can happen.  The bullying and coercion came through loud and clear.  Although I'm repeating myself, this ""overnight"" transistion from brotherly love to thumb screws and jack boots, left out a major part of the lessons to be learned from Nazism.  That's unfortunate because we, as a world community, cannot speak coherantly about the lessons of Hitler's rise to power.  We hear people make comparisons to modern day political issues but those comparisons are quickly denounced as excessively inappropriate.  It's true that we have no Hitler/Nazi Party components wielding power in America.  but it isn't true that freedom of speech is free from attack.  The emergence of ""Politically Correct"" speech has intimidated a lot of thoughtless and worthless speech out of our national vernacular.  Our sense of decency and fairness has helped improve our diversity awareness and that is good.  However, the frontiers of Political Correctness have edged into intimidating the serious discussion of a number of moral and politcal issues.  Unlike ""The Mortal Storm"" these things don't happen overnight.

I found myself challenged to determine how much courage I would have had in such times as I was watching.  That, I believe, was the point of the movie.",1180310400,6,2252,5.076294277929155
566382,4,6303120490,"Probably the best movie concerning the rise of Hitler and Nazism ever made.  By far, the most compelling performances were that of Jimmy Stewart (Martin Breitner) and M. Sullivan.  There are many familiar faces in this film that went on to even greater heights: Frank Morgan (The Wizard of Oz), Robert Stack (The Untouchables), & Robert Montgomery (Father Knows Best, Marcus Welby MD).  But to really understand this film you have to understand the director, Frank Borzage. A 2-time Oscar winner (Seventh Heaven, The Bad Girl), he attained high rank in the Masonic Order. A primary axiom of the Masons was their belief in the universal brotherhood of man. The idea that all had value.  This themes is very evident in the film.  The alpine village depicted here serves as an excellent model relative to what happened in nearly every German home.  Although a box office failure, the film serves as perhaps the best commentary ever on the effects of Nazism on the individual German family.",1085011200,11,986,4.909638554216867
566383,5,6303120490,"A chilling and surprisingly effective political drama detailing Germany's transition from a center of European high civilization into the totalitarian paranoia of the Nazi regime.  Jimmy Stewart is a free-thinking, kind hearted Everyman, whose best friends turn on him when he refuses Party membership, and whose life and career are destroyed by the people who were once his neighbors and confidants.  The sense of horror and surprise at how swiftly things changed is made manifest in this film, which is one of Hollywood's most effective pre-war antifascist propaganda films.  Margaret Sullavan plays opposite Stewart, and once again adds a nice touch to her role as the girl he loves, and the daughter of an eminent scientist who runs afoul of the local Nazi fanatics.  Robert Stack also appears, so young (and so blond!) that you'll hardly recognize him.  A powerful film; well worth watching.",1081036800,12,896,5.194444444444445

7838243,4,6303120490,"The Mortal Storm is a tense drama about a German family that is torn apart by the coming to power of the Nazi Party in 1933. The father of the family is a liberal professor in a German town. He has two step- sons by his first marriage and a natural son and daughter by his second wife,
 who is Jewish. There are also two young men who are close friends of the family and who are sweet on the daughter

The two brothers are supporters of Hitler, as is one of the young friends, and this is a source of wrenching pain.
Nevertheless,this is not a story of stereotype characters. The two Nazi brothers are close to their step-father  and are concerned about the welfare of their sister and her full brother. The strains are about politics rather than race but race is never far below the surface.
.The story is about the brutal playing out of these strains.
The important thing about the book and the film is that they were written and made before the War. We are now familiar with the evil nature of the Nazi regime but it was not as clear in 1939. These works were completed before the holocaust,and before great atrocities in Poland and Russia. Phyllis Bottome  and the producers showed what the Nazis were like before 1939 and they helped to prepare the world for the coming struggle.
In the late 1930s the Penguin Book Company brought out a series of Penguin Specials to inform the British public of the dangers of the Nazi
regime. They brought out books such as ""The New German Empire"";' Poland';,""Germany_What Next;"" and ""What Hitler Wants"".
The novel they chose was ""The Mortal Storm"".
