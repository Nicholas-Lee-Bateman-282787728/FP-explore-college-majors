2648780,5,B000HXDWG4,"Magnum P.I. is my favorite show of all time. It ran for 8 seasons.

Great news with the release of season 5! Starting with season 5, the DVDs are single sided!

This is a very good season of the show. But it's not for newbies, because in order to understand some of the better episodes here, you need to be familiar with episodes from previous seasons. So if you're new to the show, I recommend starting either with season 1 (which is a great introduction to the series) or with season 2 (which is my favorite season, and doesn't require any familiarity with previous episodes.)

Here are the episodes from season 5:

Echoes Of The Mind Part 1 - This one hour episode was originally broadcast on September 27, 1984. The music in the opening scene is from the movie ""Blade Runner."" This is one of my favorite episodes of the series. Guest actress Sharon Stone plays twins. One of the twins is nice and kind and sweet. The other twin is the character that Sharon Stone usually plays.

Echoes Of The Mind Part 2 - This one hour episode was originally broadcast on October 4, 1984. This continues where the previous episode left off. This is just as good as that episode. I won't spoil the plot of either episode for you by telling you what they're about. These two episodes were made before Sharon Stone became famous. Both of these two episodes are excellent, even by the high standards that the series has set for itself.

Mac's Back - This is one of my favorite episodes of the series. While stopped at a red light, Magnum sees his friend Mac crossing the street. There's just one problem: Mac died two years ago. Magnum tries to convince his friends of what he saw, and they think he's crazy. Doc Ibold even talks about possibly putting Magnum into a psychiatric hospital. The final scene of this episode is a redoing of the final scene from the season 2  episode ""The Woman On The Beach.""

The Legacy Of Garwood Huddle - Magnum helps an old bank robber (who is an old acquaintance of Higgins) rescue his grandson from kidnappers.

Under World - While flying his helicopter, T.C. crashes into the ocean. T.C. spends much of the episode in a coma. Will T.C. survive? Or will he be missing from the last 4 seasons of the series? If you want to know the answer, you'll have to watch this episode.

Fragments - Magnum tries to help a psychic try to stop a murder from happening. This reminds me of the season 1 episode ""Missing In Action,"" except that this episode is a little bit better.

Blind Justice - This script seems like a very good episode of ""Law And Order."" I love what happens at the end with the tape recorder.

Murder 101 - Magnum teaches a college course on how to be a private investigator. I consider this to be one of worst and lamest episodes of the series.

Tran Quoc Jones - A young illegal immigrant asks Magnum to help him find his father.

Luther Gillis: File #001 - This is another one of those Luther Gillis episodes.

Kiss Of The Sabre - This is partially a fantasy episode where all the lead characters play other characters.

Little Games - Magnum makes a big mistake when he assumes that the new Mac is as good a computer programmer as the old Mac. While I loved the earlier episode ""Mac's Back,"" I don't at all like how the new Mac continues to reappear in later episodes such as this one.

Professor Jonathan Higgins - Pygmalion done Magnum style. The actress in question, Jillie Mack, married Tom Selleck in real life two years later.

Compulsion - A crazy psycho becomes obsessed with Magnum's friend Carol and kidnaps her.

All Four One Part 1 - In an attempt by the show's writers to recreate the Vietnam experience, Magnum, T.C., Rick, and Higgins go to Cambodia to rescue someone. By a weird coincidence, the plant life and mountain ranges in Cambodia look exactly like the plant life and mountain ranges in Hawaii.

All Four One Part 2 - This continues where the previous episode left off.

The Love For Sale Boat - Another episode with the fake Mac. The fake Mac is a con artist, and this causes a lot of trouble for various innocent bystanders.

Let me Hear The Music - I really like this episode. In homage to the plane crash that killed Buddy Holly, a fictional country singer from a long time ago died in a plane crash. Magnum tries to find 5 missing songs of his that are supposedly worth millions of dollars. There's a really great scene that takes place in a country bar with a female singer whose real life name is Amanda McBroom. She sings 2 songs. The first is a cover of Tanya Tucker's ""Texas (When I Die)"" from Tucker's 1978 album ""T.N.T."" That song is pretty good. But it's the second song that really intrigued me. That second song is a cover of Linda Ronstadt's version of the Everly Brothers' song ""When Will I Be Loved."" I liked it so much that I bought Ronstadt's 1974 album ""Heart Like A Wheel,"" which has since become my favorite album of all time.

Ms. Jones - Every time Magnum goes to the hall of records to get information, he always gets the same clerk behind the counter. A running joke in past episodes was that she always had the same phone conversation where she got dumped by her boyfriend. By this point in time, she's been married to him for a while. He's been kidnapped, and she needs Magnum's help to find him.

The Man From Marseilles - Magnumn helps a famous French detective. Part of solving the case requires Magnum to sing at a karaoke bar.

Torah Torah Torah - This is one of my favorite episodes of this season. Magnum helps a rabbi to find a stolen Torah. Magnum's respect for the rabbi's observance of the Sabbath prevents Magnum from being killed in a car bomb. The rabbi's description to Magnum of the first time that he saw Higgins is quite moving. This is an excellent episode.

A Pretty Good Dancing Chicken - Magnum tries to find a teenage runaway. In order to obtain information to solve the case, Magnum disguises himself as a prisoner inside a jail.",1157068800,120,5938,4.45983379501385

2648879,4,B000HXDWG4,"The fifth season of Magnum generally sustains the high level established from season 2 on. Highlights include two well done two part episodes. The first, leading season 5 off, features future star, but here barely known, Sharon Stone. The second finds our foursome back in southeast Asia.

We also get the return of Jeff Mackay, who played Lt. McReynolds in seasons 1-3. Now he plays likable con man Jim Bonnick. In a clever reversal of roles now Magnum and buddies are the ones being continually conned. Mackay appears in a number of episodes this season. Kathleen Lloyd also appears in several episodes as Assistant DA Carol Baldwin. There's also a third Luther Gilles episode.

Unfortunately, this season has more than a few weak episodes. The problems mostly stem from incoherent plotting. Episodes like ""Under World"" and ""Blind Justice"" just don't make a great deal of sense. ""Fragments"" takes psychics seriously.

The packaging is an improvement on the first 3 seasons. Gone are the double sided disks. Unfortunately, five hours of programming are squeezed onto most of the five disks. This leads to some distracting artifacting at times. One episode (""The Man From Marseilles"") has a few minutes of French dialogue cut from it. There doesn't appear to have been anything in the way of restoration done but fortunately the material is new enough not to require much. There is little in the way of extras, just one season 6 episode (""The Treasure of Kalaniopu'u"").

It helps but is not strictly necessary to have seen the previous seasons.

2648891,2,B000HXDWG4,"MAGNUM was an American television series starring Tom Selleck as Thomas Magnum, a former Naval Intelligence officer/Vietnam veteran, now James Bond like beach-bum private investigator living on Oahu, Hawaii that ran on CBS from December of 1980 to May of 1988 that consistently ranked in the top 20 American TV programs in the Nielsen ratings during the first 5 years of this detective drama.

Magnum lived & resided in the guest house of a posh, 200-acre beachfront estate known as Robin's Nest, in Hawaii, at the invitation of its owner(Robin Masters), the celebrated-but-never-seen author of several dozen lurid novels.

Ostensily this was quid pro quo for Magnum's services based upon Magnum's claimed expertise in security; the pilot episode ""Don't Eat The Snow In Hawaii"" suggests Magnum also did Robin Masters a favor of some sort.

Additionally, Robin's Nest was guarded by 2 highly trained Doberman Pinschers(Zeus & Apollo)and all other aspects of the estate were managed by Englishman Jonathan Quayle Higgins III(Played by Texas-born veteran actor John Hillerman), an often exasperated ex-British Army Sgt. Major with whom often as a humorous aside during various episodes of the series, Magnum must barter for use of estate amenities other than the guest house & the Ferrari GTS, tennis courts, wine cellar, expensive cameras, etc.

During the early seasons of MAGNUM, PI, the voice of Robin Masters heard only a few times per season was voiced by Orson Welles.

A recurrent theme throughout the last 2 seasons involves Magnum's suspicion that Higgins is actually Robin Masters, especially in the 7th Season in the ""Paper Wars"" episode when Magnum gets stuck in an elevator with Higgins, but this possibility is contradictory to numerous references throughout the series' run that make it clear that they are 2 different people. In spite of this, Higgins' dual identity remains an open question until the final episode ""Resolutions"" where Higgins admits he is Robin Masters, but later suggests what he had said about Robin Masters was a lie.

Magnum seemingly lived a dream lifestyle since he'd come & go as he pleases, works only when he wants to, has the unlimited use of the Ferrari as well as many other luxuries of Robin Masters.

Magnum also keeps a mini-fridge with a seemingly endless supply of fictional Coops beer, wears his father's treasured Rolex GMT Master wristwatch, is seemingly surrounded by countless foxy women(who are often his clients or victims in the cases he's hired to investigate)and enjoys adventures with his Navy buddies that he served in Vietnam with which were TC(Roger Mosley)and Rick(Larry Manetti).

Interestingly, Magnum & Higgins often break the 4th wall by 'locking eyes' with the audience; other characters do this, though less frequently.

At the end of the 7th Season, Magnum was killed off, and was intended to be the end of the series back in the Spring of 1987, but there was an outcry from fans and an 8th, final season was produced in the Fall of 1987, to bring Magnum 'back to life' and round the series off in the Spring of 1988 when CBS cancelled MAGNUM after it's 8-year run in May of 1988.

The 5th Season of this detective drama was terrible and the season when this show started going kind of stale at least until MAGNUM kicked off its 1985-86 Season on CBS, because it wasn't as funny or as sophisticated as 1st, 2nd, 6th, 7th, or 8th Season, plus the Fifth Season of MAGNUM,PI which was the 1984-85 Season on CBS seemed like a repeat or a duplicate of the 3rd and 4th Season of MAGNUM, especially since the 5th Season used the same exact introduction as the 3rd and 4th Season since that opening intro became stale after using it in the 3rd Season along with the fact that the honeymoon phase of this private detective show was already gone.

But CBS should've changed the introduction to this private detective drama by the time it hit it's 5th Season instead of waiting till the 6th Season of that show, which was MAGNUM's 1985-86 Season on CBS and used and started the Sixth Season introduction for the 5th Season instead of using the same exact introduction as the 3rd and 4th Season along with the fact that MAGNUM, P.I didn't seem to pick up again until the 6th Season, since the Sixth Season didn't feel like a repeat of the 3rd, 4th, or 5th Season either.

In addition to that, the DVD didn't even show the original air-date of each episode either, unlike they did for the first 3 seasons of that show, which really sucks, especially if you ever get curious on when each episodes original air-date was, plus they didn't even put the air-date on the listing of each episode on the DVD case next to the summary like Warner Bros. did with the CHiPs DVD's did either, which really lags big time.

For instance, the original air-dates to each of these 1984-1985 Season episodes on CBS was
9/27/84: ECHOES OF THE MIND(Part 1)
10/4/84: ECHOES OF THE MIND(Part 2)
10/11/84: MAC'S BACK
10/18/84: THE LEGACY OF GARWOOD HUDDLE
10/25/84: UNDER WORLD
11/1/84: FRAGMENTS
11/8/84: BLIND JUSTICE
11/15/84: MURDER 101
11/29/84: TRAN QUOC JONES
12/6/84: LUTHER GILLIS: FILE #001
12/13/84: KISS OF THE SABRE
1/3/85: LITTLE GAMES
1/10/85: PROFESSOR JONATHAN HIGGINS
1/24/85: COMPULSION
1/31/85: ALL FOR ONE(Part 1)
2/7/85: ALL FOR ONE(Part 2)
2/14/85: THE LOVE-FOR-SALE BOAT
2/21/85: LET ME HEAR THE MUSIC
3/7/85: MS. JONES
3/14/85: THE MAN FROM MARSEILLES
3/28/85: TORAH, TORAH, TORAH
4/4/85: A PRETTY GOOD DANCING CHICKEN

Therefore, this whole 1984-85 Season DVD really bites and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless of course you're a MAGNUM fan who ""has"" to have a collection of every single season of MAGNUM, PI on DVD.

On the other hand, MAGNUM's 5th Season had some interesting guest stars like
*Deborah Pratt in the ""Echoes of the Mind"" episode during her co-starring days as Archangel's side-kick(Marella) on AIRWOLF

*William Bryant in ""The Legacy of Garwood Huddle"" episode after his co-starring days as Colt Seaver's director on THE FALL GUY

*Sharon Stone in the ""Echoes of the Mind"" episode before she became a star

*Kim Miyori in the ""Murder 101"" episode after her co-starring days on ST. ELSEWHERE

*Jenny Agutter known for her role as Nurse Alex in the movie AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON guest starring in the ""Little Games"" episode

*Terry Kiser whose known for his role in the movie WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S guest starring in the ""Tran Quoc Jones"" episode

*Cesar Romero known for his role as The Joker on BATMAN guest starring in the ""Little Games"" episode

*Dustin Nguyen in the ""All for One"" episode before his co-starring days on 21 JUMPSTREET

In the meantime, now that Universal has released all 8 seasons of MAGNUM, PI out on DVD, I hope this has inspired Warner Bros. or Paramount to finally release the remaining seasons of MAGNUM'S biggest rival MATT HOUSTON with Lee Horsley(Houston) & Pamela Hensley(CJ Parsons) out on DVD soon, since MATT HOUSTON was an interesting private detective show like MAGNUM, P.I. was that was in serious competition with MAGNUM throughout MATT HOUSTON's 3-year run on ABC back in the early 1980's, except Houston was a more significant kind of detective than Magnum was who always had his act together, unlike Magnum since Magnum was only a beach-bum private detective who lived on a shoe-string budget and rent-free at the so-called Robin Masters estate in Hawaii barely able to stay afloat and Houston was a filthy-rich Texas style private-eye who lived a luxurious lifestyle that had moved to the L.A. Area to take over his family business overseas and did detective work on the side as a hobby who also had a swanky penthouse in the Hollywood hills and his detective agency in Downtown LA & frequently paid people money in $100 bills to get information to find leads to solve his cases along with the fact Houston was also a former Vietnam veteran like Magnum was, except Magnum could never touch Houston.

Therefore you could say that MATT HOUSTON was like a rich-mans MAGNUM since Magnum was always broke and Houston never was which resulted in Magnum always being in hot water, unlike Houston who lived high on the hog constantly outclassing Magnum along with the fact that Houston was also a playboy who always had cute chicks around him too even more often than Magnum did, despite the fact that MAGNUM, PI still outlasted MATT HOUSTON.

Therefore Houston lived the kind of lifestyle that Magnum probably wished he could've live, especially on a private dicks salary, but unfortunately MATT HOUSTON ran out of steam when it hit it's Third Season on ABC when the ratings fell drastically all of the sudden, which led to MATT HOUSTON's cancellation back in the Summer of 1985 when MAGNUM's Sixth Season was underway on CBS, which also takes me back to memory lane to when Lee Horsley(Houston)used to get teased a lot by people saying ""Are you trying to copy Tom Selleck?"", but Horsley would always acknowledge by saying ""No, but I'm flattered you see a resemblence."".

Lee Horseley also added that he knew that people were just trying to agitate him, but Horsley wouldn't take it personally, because of the fact that MATT HOUSTON was a very popular TV show like MAGNUM, PI was along with the fact that some people even preferred MATT HOUSTON to MAGNUM, especially since MATT HOUSTON had more action in it than MAGNUM, P.I. did along with the fact that Houston was a lot tougher, stronger, a lot huskier, a lot more organized, and a lot more fortunate than Magnum ever was along with the fact that Houston kicked more tail than Magnum did along with the fact that MAGNUM, PI perhaps even started losing some viewers through MATT HOUSTON during MATT HOUSTON's first 2 seasons, especially since MAGNUM was already in its 3rd Season on CBS when MATT HOUSTON made its debut on CBS's rival network ABC in September of 1982, but unfortunately tanked after it's 3rd Season since MATT HOUSTON took a nose-dive in the ratings since it lost a lot of viewers through the premiere of MIAMI VICE on NBC in the Fall of 1984 since it was shown at the same time slot as MATT HOUSTON every Friday night.

As a matter of fact, MATT HOUSTON made premiered on ABC on Sunday September 26th, 1982 which coincidentally happened to be the same night that KNIGHT RIDER made its debut on NBC, but MAGNUM, PI had already made its debut on CBS on Thursday December 11th, 1980 since MAGNUM got off to a late start in the late Fall of 1980 along with the fact that MATT HOUSTON made Lee Horsley a star just like MANGUM had made Tom Selleck a star as well as a sex symbol.

Something else I noticed that I couldn't help finding intriguing was every other person who has guest starred on MAGNUM, PI has also been on MATT HOUSTON too such as Cesar Romero, Alan Fudge, Beverly Garland, Robin Dearden, George Kee-Cheung, Ed Grover, Jack Hogan, Jack Kruschen, Jenny Sherman, Steven Keats, James Luisi, Robert F. Lyons, John-Dennis Johnston, Alan Hale, William Windom, Barbara Rush, Bill Lucking, Lenore Kasdorf, Russ McCubbin, Marta Dubois, John Calvin, etc.

By the way, I just got word that Paramount will finally be releasing the detective drama MATT HOUSTON-Season 1 out on DVD on Tuesday March 9th, 2010 and that the SHOUT Factory will be releasing the detective drama SIMON & SIMON-Season 4 out on DVD on Tuesday April 6th, 2010 and are both now available for pre-order which also gives us 2 new detective dramas in the works to look forward to in the Spring of 2010.",1200960000,2,11461,4.821283095723015

2648896,4,B000HXDWG4,"Magnum is a show that follows the ""star + ensemble"" formula that has always been a mainstay of the action movie and TV industries.  Nowhere does the formula been more successfully used, especially in the later seasons of Magnum.  Stories are often set up through the backgrounds of the supporting characters.  But it's still up to the star, in this case Tom Sellick, to carry the bulk of the load.  Luckily Sellick is up to the challenge, and I think this season relies on Sellick more than any previous season to keep the show interesting and entertaining.  Whenever the plot gets a little silly - and that happens in every season of Magnum - Sellick's down-to-earth and lovable portrayal of Magnum makes the show a joy to watch.

So what happens in this season?  The most important plot points are the return of ""Mac"" (reincarnated as a charming con man), the development of Carol, the district attorny, and the increasing use of Icepick, Rick's godfather-like underworld connection.  Few, if any, of the episodes are among the best of the series, but there are lots of good shows here to make the purchase price worthwhile.  ""Mac's Back"" is the most obvious must-have episode of the season.  Unlike others, I find the 2-part premier of the season to be overly melodramatic and possibly the worst shows of the season.  The other 2-parter, featuring a rescue mission to a Cambodian jungle village, makes good use of its time and even brings Higgins back into his military acoutrements.

Many fans feel the show decreased in quality over the last few seasons.  I am of the opinion that the show continued to get better - mostly due to the richness of the back stories and the quality of the supporting cast.  Season 5 may not be the best season, but it's still a lot of fun to watch.  Although there are no extras on this DVD edition, at least this season finally puts to rest the technical problems that plagued the releases of earlier seasons: for the first time, there was not a single show marred by segments unreadable by my DVD player.",1178841600,10,2041,4.662011173184357

There's always been political elements to the show, but they seemed to stretch one's imagination beyond realism. Season 2 through season 4 are the 3 ""must owns"" if you were to only have 3. The shows subject matter was at its peak and was fresh during those seasons. The Vietnam era ended right around the time I was born so being under 40, I tended to enjoy the episodes most like season 2's football episode featuring Dick Butkus, Season 3's episode with Rick and AJ Simon along with Morgan Fairchild, as well as season 4's with Magnum meeting Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker.",1168905600,4,746,4.574626865671642

I've seen all episodes on TV and now I appreciate to buy this DVD so I can see it again and again. And finally I can see it in original language which is much better. Well, dr. Watson, let's start. I mean Higgy Baby...I have just seen last episode of fifth series. And what can I say. As good as all previous series. Maybe I can feel some difference but it could be only feeling. It becomes more serious. In beginning it was all more optimistic, higher spirited. But I understand it's slowly facing to the end. And the end is as all we know not really happy end. But maybe somebody don't know, so that's all to this. I like this smart intelligent humor, unforgetable atmosphere of 80's in Hawai, Magnum's sense of humor, his red Ferrari. But most astonishing is without question his highness, amazing, terribly worn, small and not so slim Jonathan Quayle Higgins III and all his ""half-brothers"" and amazing friends... I like also Robin Masters...Mixed humorous, serious, funny and sometimes sad and melancholic episodes with very good detective stories an unique charakters made I think this the best series in all the universe. I can only recommend this series to people, who like these old TV shows, nice, humorous, kind...not like today's production without glamour and without even mark of clever dialogue and smart plot of action.",1168473600,9,1477,4.684615384615385
