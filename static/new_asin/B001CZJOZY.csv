3520764,2,B001CZJOZY,"I gave it 2 stars because the plot was sort of interesting to get into, but It was hard to watch the cheesy, poorly drawn characters, and animation. This was far more interesting than the other Naruto movies that I won't even review because they are all bad. I figured they give us some good fighting scenes at least. Nope....Well, I will stick to watching the TV series.",1415232000,,371,4.470588235294118

3520781,5,B001CZJOZY,My 16 year old says this is a great movie and good for everyone. Fans of Naruto will enjoy the movie and story as it is a continuation from other movies and the TV series. He says people that are new to Naruto will still be entertained because this movie does a good job of introducing all of the characters and plot lines (obviously you will understand more if you are already familiar with the TV series though).,1406332800,,414,4.32051282051282

3520799,5,B001CZJOZY,Received well ahead of schedule. Have watched it with my dad and my anime club and truly enjoy it. A lot of my friends have asked to borrow it and have enjoyed it.,1356998400,,163,3.9696969696969697
3520800,5,B001CZJOZY,Like all things Naruto it rocks. I'm kinda one sided but it was still a good movie regardless. I I I I I,1356393600,,104,3.5652173913043477
3520801,2,B001CZJOZY,"I think this is one of my favorite Naruto movies because at the end of it every character (even Sakura!) fought until they won for this child. This was different for me b/c in every other naruto movie only him and the other main character become stronger but, in this movie everyone got to taste the sweet juice of that never say never mentality. Naruto is and will always be a great fictional inspiration but I did feel like each movie has the same plotline. Naruto meets a lonely or spoiled person and helps them realize that if you believe in yourself anything is possible. I would love to see naruto evolve from this but hey you cant have it all. I suggest you watch this if you feel you don't see the nine tailed fox enough and you wanna see Sakura grow some balls other than that you can save your money.",1348617600,,810,4.300653594771242
3520802,5,B001CZJOZY,Favorite movie out of the three Naruto movies. The plot and theme for this movie are very good. Really liked how well everything started to peice together and flow smoothly. If you aren't a naruto fan this movie is a good one to start off with to introduce you to the series.,1315094400,,275,4.3076923076923075
3520803,4,B001CZJOZY,"Naruto the Movie 3: Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom is the third film in the Naruto franchise.  The movie has Naruto, Sakura, Lee, and Kakashi on a mission to protect Michiru, the prince of the Land of the Moon, as well as Michiru's son, Hikaru.  Michiru and Hikaru both believe that money can buy anything they want; this attitude rubs Naruto the wrong way.  During the movie, Hikaru learns what friendship means, thanks to Naruto, Sakura, and Lee.  Naruto and his friends have to help Michiru and Hikaru after the discover that the Land of the Moon has been taken over by one of the royal advisors and three ninja he has hired to help him.  Can Naruto and the group save the kingdom and return Michiru's family to power?

I have to say that while I enjoyed the story of this film, I was rather disappointed with the animation.  Of the three Naruto films, this one easily received the worst animation.  There isn't as much detail on the character drawings, and the computer graphics that were used just drew too much attention to themselves.

When Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom was released on DVD, it was released as a two disc set.  On the first disc, you can play the movie, select which scenes you want to see, and set up your options.  There is an audio commentary included in the options menu.

The second disc contains eight bonus features.  The first is a twenty-two minute documentary titled, ""The Story of Naruto: Growing Up a Ninja.""  The documentary starts out talking about Naruto and his childhood, and then goes into talking about the actual film.  This documentary includes interviews with the production supervisor, the ADR director, and the English dub actors for Lady Tsunade, Naruto, Hikaru, Kakashi, Prince Michiru, Shabadaba, and Ishidate.  At the very end, there is a brief discussion of the next Naruto series, Naruto Shippuden.

The second bonus feature is the seven-minute documentary, ""Team: The Art of Group Recording.""  In this feature, you see some of the voice actors recording the dub of the film together.  It features interviews with the ADR director, and the English dub voices for Kakashi, Prince Michiru, and Lee.

The third feature is ""Shooting for the Moon: A Conversation With the Naruto Movie 3 Producers.""  It runs for ten minutes and forty-one seconds, and features the Japanese producers.  The feature has Japanese audio and English subtitles.  Next is the ""Clean Ending,"" which runs for four minutes and twenty-five seconds.  This is the ending credits and the epilogue without any text.  However, since the text is never seen over the images (it's on a black portion to the side of the images), this feature seems to be a bit of a waste.

Next are the original Japanese movie trailers.  This feature runs for four minutes, and contains eight trailers.  This feature has Japanese audio, but absolutely no subtitles.  There is a ""Production Art Gallery,"" which contains thirty-five pages of line drawings of the characters.

The next feature is a Naruto trivia quiz.  You watch clips and answer questions.  At the end, you get your ninja rank.  First off, I thought there were too many questions in this quiz.  Secondly, there were a number of times where the question and the clip shown before it really had nothing to do with each other.  This feature is definitely aimed at viewers who have seen all of the Naruto series.  The final feature contains game trailers.  It runs for eight minutes, and includes trailers for five Naruto video games and one Bleach game.  Personally, I didn't think the Bleach one really needed to be included.

If you're a Naruto fan that wants to own everything on DVD, then this is a ""must get"" item.  If you're a more casual fan, then I would only recommend purchasing this release if you enjoyed the movie.

I wrote this review after watching a copy of this DVD that I checked out through the King County Library System.",1295308800,4,3915,4.774962742175857

As usual, Naruto does not disappoint.  This movie takes place after the departure of Sasuke, but definitely before Shippuden begins.  The animation is excellent, as is the audioscape.  A nice side adventure for those interested in the spunky shinobi.",1229385600,2,483,8.23076923076923

3520808,5,B001CZJOZY,"Its a great family movie, that is one thing that I love about the Naruto movies and the series is that it is filled with life lessons that really prioritizes and sets what truly matters in perspective.
 This movie features some of my favorite characters from the series, it is funny (of course anything with Naruto and Rock Lee is) and has a lot of action. With out getting into the plot too much or ruining all the good parts for you, its a typical Naruto movie where the squad is sent to escort/protect someone, what is suppose to be a clean cut mission turns into a lot more. The squad is forced to use their wits, team work, and abilities to carry out their mission.",1227139200,8,670,4.317460317460317
