1710070,5,B000065V3X,"This is an awful movie. Ms Funicello is clearly not having any of it, and there's not a smidge of sincerity in any of the children. Large sections seem to have been filmed in different universes, and the production values are super cheese.

I do however love Ray Bolger, and there's just not enough of his performances recorded for posterity. He's a little (??A little?) old for this part, he's not in his prime, but second rate Bolger is so much better than anyone first rate could be. Also, Ms Funicello's stoned rendition with her 3D counterparts of ""I Can't Do The Sum"" is a guilty pleasure. Could she care any less? Is she ill? Should we be worried?",1502582400,,654,4.495798319327731

How I want to dance like that! I have seen other versions but they are terrible compared to this. I've been hunting down the soundtrack for years but was never able to find it- after purchasing this on Amazon I discovered iTunes had this version's soundtrack...but it's one of those instances where the soundtrack was recorded much differently than the movie itself and that's a huge bummer. I'm astounded at how beautifully the old colors converted to HD, it's quite stunning.

1710174,2,B000065V3X,"I usually enjoy watching these old films with my grandkids, ages 4, 6, and 8.  But this one was really hard to get through.  In fact, I like to review them before sharing with the kids (even the old Disney ones----some are very, very scary like the witch scene in Snowwhite), so I haven't tested it on them yet.  My guess is that it'll get the GONG.  These children aren't subjected to the usual modern fare of non-stop hype , rude humor and disrespect that make up the movies, programs and cartoons today, so they've retained a good level of childhood innocence.  Having said that, they're also smart kids, and I'm not sure this kind of goofy, over the top (in the make-believe sense) movie isn't going to grab them.  For me watching Annette in her ever-changing beautiful dresses was fun and nostalgic, but I don't know that it's enough to keep the attention for an hour and a half.  Basically the film s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-s the life out of every nursery rhyme character you can think of, incorporating it into a laborious plot that was too old for a preschooler, yet Mother Goose, et al, was too young for older ones.  Maybe one hour would have been better with more meat to the plot.  The acting of the other characters is on par with a local kids' theater, not the movies.  Even pros like Ray Bolger had parts that were over the top and so drawn out I ended up fast-forwarding through much of the movie before finally giving up.  The music and dancing went on way too long to keep children entertained.  Kids may at first like to identify the characters but will probably get bored quickly.  Especially if they like the delights of Swiss Family Robinson, Old Yeller, Sound of Music, etc.  This is too childish for grade school children, but with adult themes of marriage, money, kidnapping etc., most preschoolers won't get, it becomes an awkward fit for all ages.  I gave 2 stars for the nostalgia of seeing old Mousketeer, Annette, but otherwise it would have been hard to give it even one star.",1456358400,3,1998,4.557422969187675

It's filled with songs and dancing, too, while living in Mother Goose Land. Disney made a wonderful fantasy of storybook characters come to life in this movie. Plus the toy soldiers! I haven't watched this disc, as I don't want to give her a used item. Hopefully the movie will still be clear and colorful.

I remember loving this movie as a kid.  But sadly, I was no judge of acting ability (poor Annette had a sweet voice, but who thought putting her in film was a good idea?!  Walt, I guess.)

1710283,5,B000065V3X,"I loved this movie from my childhood. There is something classic and timeless about it.

This is one of those grossly underrated, wonderful treasures of a movie. It's rather simple, with the fanciest effects being the movement of the toy soldiers, which was ahead of its time, but it's a true case of simple is beautiful. It's a fantastic movie for those who just wish to sit back, and laugh with the family, and have an adventure in fantasy land. There's really something for everyone - Ray Bolger ( who looked really spectacular, very handsome in his role as Barnaby), Annette (who is always charming for being the sweetheart we all know), Tommy Sands as the daring hero, and the team of Henrey Calvin and Gene Sheldon, along with the forever amusing Ed Wynn. This movie turns out more of a comedy, and the adventures that encompass Mary and Tom Piper, when crossed by Barnaby, double crossed by Gonzorgo and Rodrigo are hilarious.",1438128000,,933,4.723926380368098

The quality of the movie itself was very poor -- I think some things were lost with it being enhanced or ""fixed"" from the original, color seemed not true to color -- too bright.

It's a beautiful restoration of the 1961 movie (which I saw as a 12-year-old), and it was so funny Christmas night to have my 28-year-old daughter notice the movie playing and say ""Wait! Isn't this the movie with 'This Is The Forest Of No Return!'? I loved that movie!"". A little later my 25-year-old son walked in and noticed the movie and said ""Wait! Isn't this the movie with 'This is the Forest Of No Return'?"" They both remembered it from a VHS tape version (4:3 pan-and-scan back in the early 90s) that I used to have before DVDs.

Fun to see the early Ann Jillian as Bo Peep singing.  Ray Bolger played the evil Barnaby out to get rid of Tom Piper so that he could marry Mary Contrary and get her money.  Fun to see Henry Calvin and Gene Shelton ( two alumni of the Disney Zorro TV series) as Barnaby's henchmen.

1710408,5,B000065V3X,"Of all Annette Funicello's movies, this was her favorite. That's why it gets 5 stars.

A curtain opens to reveal the Toyland set, helping to make the movie look even more artificial than it already does.

It is based on an Operetta of the same name. Even in 1961, when this was released, operetta was pretty much dead as a doornail. My Mom is the only person I ever knew who liked Operetta. She hated this movie. Two of Disney's staff writers wrote new lyrics to Victor Herbert's music, further infuriating my Mother. In addition, neither Tommy Sands nor Annette had the voices required for operetta, so, all the music was pretty much lost.

Annette, a natural brunette, was transformed into a redhead for this movie. Annette is lovely. Unfortunateley, she doesn't have a lot to do except cry a lot and often. It's remarkable that Annette is the actress most remembered for this movie. She received third billing in this, and yet, there she is on the cover, standing by herself between two toy soldiers.

It's hard to believe, but Tommy Sands won out over James Darren for the part of Tom the Piper's son (Stole a pig and away he run.) Mr. Sands looked more like the guy who stole your hub caps. Still, he has a nice singing voice and he does what he can with the script he has been given.

Top billed Ray Bolger is the evil Barnaby. Who could be expected to believe that? He does a nice job dancing with Annette while singing his solo ""Castle in Spain"" (a love song in the original).

Disney contract players Henry Calvin, Gene Sheldon, Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran are here along with a very young Ann Jillian singing ""Never Mind Bo-Peep"" and Broadway's Mary McCarty (One day to be Stella Deems in FOLLIES) is Mother Goose.

The Disney Orchestra and Chorus are unmistakeably familiar. All of this gives the proceedings the feeling of a TV show. It doesn't have the look of a Major Studio Production.

The sets, although pretty, look like cardboard and plastic.

All in all, The Laurel and Hardy feature is a better movie and closer to the original in concept. The singing is by Charlotte Henry (Alice in Wonderland) and a boy who's name i cannot remember, but it is excellent. And, there's the super-scary bogie-men! who might be too much for the little ones.

Still, there's only one Annette and this Disney version is much beloved by its fans.",1417478400,,2348,4.5823389021479715

1710411,5,B000065V3X,"Hadn't seen this flick in over 50 years, when I was about 6.  Guess what?  It is BETTER as an adult!  It's a loose remake of 'The March of the Wooden Soldiers"" from the '30s with Laurel and Hardy, actually the Victor Herbert operetta, complete with Disney color and special effects and music.  I thought it was magnificent, the best light fantasy since ""The Wizard of Oz.""  It absolutely refuses to take itself seriously, which is why it works so well.  And did I mention that the great Ray Bolger, Oz' Scarecrow, played Barnaby the (not-so) Bad Guy?

This is a musical, and I still really like some of the songs. But the beginning of the movie is this odd, really long dance scene that I don't remember at all. I had remembered this as a movie where the characters go into ""Toyland"" from a normal reality, but actually they start out in this weird romantic dream land to begin with. The nemesis and his side kicks look like they're on a set of some high school production and their antics are like a dumbed down version of The Three Stooges. The movies doesn't really play to kids. The dialogue is not kid oriented, even if the physical activity is slapstick. I have no idea how I followed this as a kid and remained interested. Maybe I was just really taken in by the colors and costumes. I am even a fan of slow movies in general and a lot of the movies I like, I end up watching alone because they're too slow for everyone else... this is a slow movie with a lot of physical movement and definitely would not keep most audiences interested if I got bored. I don't know who the original target demographic was, but I'm thinking maybe it was played during holidays for the whole family to have on in the background and kind of ignore outside of the catchy musical numbers. I gave it three stars for being aesthetically entertaining during portions of the movie and for having a few good songs, as well as some older famous actors. I had to turn it off about thirty minutes in because I was so bored and gave up on the nostalgia.",1400371200,2,1684,4.29874213836478

1710510,2,B000065V3X,"Maybe ok if you're three years old and just like bright colors. Fifty-three years after it was first released (when I was a 17-year old), I finally watched this for the first time. As I enjoy the broad comic work of its main characters actors, I felt I couldn't go wrong on a wintery evening. So wrong. And so surprised. Uneven, often lethargic, cheesy production for a major studio and, except for Mother Goose's wisecracking goose and one delightful Tommy Sands scene, only Ray Bolger looks like he is having a good time. The usually vibrant Annette varies between just wooden and inexplicably sullen-faced. The rubbery-faced trees in the Forest of No Return have more energy going on in this film than she does. Was there some back-stage reason for this that I'm unaware of? Always liked Tommy Sands's voice and stage manner. If only he hadn't married Nancy Sinatra, he probably would have had a much longer career! He has a good, comic-song scene disguised as a gypsy fortune-telling crone. For me, it was the one bright spot of the film. Too bad. Even silly Ed Wynn couldn't save this one.",1390953600,2,1094,4.703125

The first half of the movie drags a bit but greatly picks up in the second half. The kids enjoyed the film but commented that it was funny because it was fake. The thought of ""What is this all about?"" goes through your head while watching since the plot is rather thin but at the same time you just can't take your eyes away. All said I'm glad this is available because I use to see the toy soldiers at Disneyland as a kid, and saw the story in the old anthology books but had never actually watched the movie. Another interesting moment is realizing Bo Peep is Ann Gillian in her first role.  Tommy Kirk's role as Grumio is interesting as he has a nutty professor haircut and the glasses to match which is much different than his prior portrayals.",1385078400,2,892,4.47239263803681

One of the discs became warped due to the damage it sustained on the trip.  Oh all three were still watchable, and my daughter fell in love with them.

The VHS and DVD relise of Disney's Babes In Toyland  was pan and scan and that cut out all the magic of this tuly great film.  But now at last Disney has restored the film and has offered it in Widscreen and great color on Blue Ray.  Once again the film can be enjoyed in it interity with the widescreen allowing all the great sets and wonderful colors and dance numbers be seen as Walt Disney ment them to be seen.  So if you already have this on DVD; toss it and get the Blue Ray and if you do not have a blue Ray player get one .  This film makes up grading to blue ray worth the troble!

1710650,4,B000065V3X,"I have loved Disney's 'Babes In Toyland' ever since I saw it years ago as a kid. The music, costumes,characters and even the simple plot all appealed to me then and I have carried an affection for it ever since. Being a fan of Annette Funicello, made it all the more enjoyable to me. It was a 'feel-good' movie for me then and takes me back to a simpler time. I bought the DVD when it originally came out a few years back and it is in full frame 1.33 to 1. So when I saw that they had released the film on BluRay, I was excited to see it was in 1.55 to 1. Although I know the film, being made in 1961, had to be in the widescreen format, I assumed the BluRay version wouldn't be totally widescreen but more so than the previous dvd release. I was WRONG. It is advertised as Widescreen but it is not. It's the same as the older DVD 1.33 to 1. The picture and sound are great but I must say I was expecting an aspect ratio closer to the original film's theatrical format. I don't know why Disney insists on releasing their family films in a pan-and-scan format. It's disappointing.

1710715,4,B000065V3X,"Probably more nostalgia than anything else, but I love this movie. I hadn't seen it in 20 years, but when I got this in the mail, the movie held every bit as much charm as I remember it as a child.

The video here is AMAZIING. If you have seen other Disney Blu-Rays, you should know what to expect. The movie has a fine amount of film grain, so it still has a film look, but i's not distracting, so it should even please people who like the scrubbed ""documentary"" type of look. I would have to say that, picture quality wise, it has a similar look to the Wizard of Oz Blu-Ray. Colors pop, detail is amazing (in some instances, you can make out seams and stitches on costumes, its just amazing.

The aspect ratio of this movie may be a bit unusual for American audiances. The aspect ratio is 1.66:1, which Disney properly presents here on the disc. This wasn't a format used much in the US, in fact, I have only seen a couple of other movies with it, both by Kubrick. Basically, what this means is that, on your HDTV, the picture will fill about 90% of the screen, with VERY THIN black bars on the SIDES. Most people won't even notice it - but in case you do, know that the movie is SUPPOSED to look this way.

Sadly, the Disney quality ends in the video department. In the audio department, we are presented with a Dolby Digital 2.0 soundtrack (yes, you read that right, no lossless audio). Disney has really spoiled us over the past couple of years with their DTS MA and Dolby TrueHD tracks on all their discs, with older movies remixed to 5.1 or 7.1. That being said, there is NOTHING WRONG with the Dolby Digital 2.0 track, despite what I have read on many review sites. The movie was released in the 60s, and I don't think was even shot in Stereo, much less surround. The soundtrack presented in this movie, while rich with sound effects and music, doesn't really push modern sound systems. So while I am a bit shocked by the DD 2.0 soundtrack, I doubt that adding a lossless track would have done anything to increase sound fidelity. I believe the soundtrack Disney included accurately represents how the filmmakers wanted the film to be heard.

What is sad is that there is not a single special feature on the disc - not even a trailer. Incredibly unusual for a Disney disc.

All in all, its a good movie, a great transfer, and it is reasonably priced, so I reccomend it.",1358899200,4,2377,4.356659142212189

1710738,5,B000065V3X,"By this time, Blu-rays have become so prevalent that pretty much every recent and classic movie has been released in the format. The real event releases are the ones that really show the brilliance and clarity of Blu-ray to its fullest.

That would be Walt Disney's Babes in Toyland. It's been over one hundred years since the Victor Herbert/Glen McDonough operetta premiered, yet there have only been two theatrical movies based on it. The first was Hal Roach's 1934 version with Laurel & Hardy, which I also love.

The second one came to theaters in 1961, when Walt Disney had just given the world Disneyland, three hit TV series and movies that were broadening from animation alone to live-action comedies and adventures as well. To understand and fully appreciate the significance of Babes in Toyland, it helps to put its release within that context and then see how it looks now.

Starting with the context: the Mickey Mouse Club had left ABC TV but was heading to syndication. Zorro was canceled, but still carried on in a few prime time episodes on the Disney Sunday night anthology show. They all overlapped, many of the performers appearing in numerous other productions for the studio.

For Toyland, we got Annette Funicello, Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran, all of whom had been stalwarts of the Mickey Mouse Club. From Zorro, we have the underappreciated Henry Calvin and Gene Sheldon, both of whom turn in superb comic performances in Toyland -- not mere Laurel & Hardy knock-offs, but genuinely unique on their own. (It's worth mentioning that their characters, Rodrigo and Gonzorgo, both existed in the 1903 Toyland stage show, long before the Laurel & Hardy version).

The Disney studio had only been making sporadic attempts at live action films for a relatively short time by 1961. Most of the earliest movies were British productions, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea being the first all-live action feature made domestically. And that was only 1954. Making a full-scale musical was a little ambitious at this point -- and the one Walt Disney wanted to make was called ""The Rainbow Road to Oz.""

Rainbow Road was to star Annette, Tommy Kirk and many of the other Mickey Mouse Club performers in an original musical that would even tie into a Disneyland attraction. Neither happened (though you can get a glimpse at Rainbow Road on the DVD set, ""Your Host, Walt Disney').

When Walt turned to Toyland, he used many of the same creatives intended for Rainbow Road. At the same time, his animators and other artists had worked on Disneyland projects, blending the Disney movies, TV and theme park productions into a house style of its day.

That's exactly what you see when you watch Babes in Toyland today, especially in the bright light of Blu-ray, in which even the fabric textures are astonishingly defined -- as if you're looking through a magic window.

What you're admittedly not really seeing, though, is a movie in the strictest sense. Few critics have good things to say about Toyland, and though they certainly make valid points, I don't think a movie is what this production ultimately is. It's more a big show on screen -- and a theme park ride if you will.

Looking at Mary Contrary's garden is like seeing a floral display at the Epcot International Flower & Garden Festival. The settings would not be out of place in Fantasyland (the sets, in fact, were displayed at Disneyland in 1961 for holiday Guests to explore).

And the stylistic design, very much out of any Big Disney Golden Book, have influenced the Theme Park parades and shows ever since 1961, especially the Toy Soldiers, who have become such a Disney fixture that many do not realize they were created for this film by X Atencio and Bill Justice (and also appeared briefly in Mary Poppins).

In essence, Walt Disney's Babes in Toyland was no Poppins, but it's an E-ticket in other ways. And it paved the way. Musical fantasy and high camp are both notoriously difficult to capture in movies (The Wizard of Oz and Mary Poppins being the only two such films to be embraced by critics and audiences upon their very first releases).

Toyland doesn't flinch from being as broad as a barn, just like the stage show upon which it is based, which has its roots in vaudeville and British Pantomime. When you approach it like that, suspending disbelief as you would for a whimsical children's stage show, suddenly it's one of most bold and brash of its kind.

Ray Bolger isn't so much playing a villain as having a blast and letting us all in on it. Annette Funicello is the very soul of sincerity. Tommy Sands is remarkably believable considering the silliness going on around him -- no easy feat -- and he gets a chance to jump into the ""camp camp"" with his unbridled Floretta performance, so totally different from the Tom character that one wonders if it's the same person.

And then there's Ed Wynn, who always plays ""Ed Wynn"" even when he's in a serious role, and what a joy he is to watch. After all, you're listening to Alice's Mad Hatter and seeing Mary Poppins' Uncle Arthur at the same time And that toy making machine -- couldn't you just see it in Willy Wonka's inventing room or at a candy shop in Downtown Disney?

By the way, the original vinyl ""original cast"" album of Disney's Toyland (a studio recording of the score with Annette, Wynn, Bolger, Ann Jillian and others) is downloadable on iTunes.",1356048000,3,5394,4.746794871794871

All I had to do was tell Paige it was a Disney movie to get her to try it!  What does that say about Disney's reputation?  Everything!  And once again, Disney did not disappoint!

I must admit I'm always skeptical to watch something that's this old (1961).  With modern technology and how amazing today's movies are to watch, it sometimes takes the ability to get lost in a movie out of the equation when you are noticing and analyzing technical aspects.  However, there is magic to this movie that stands the test of time and technology.

Although I was familiar with the Toyland song, I had no idea what this was about!  Both Paige and I enjoyed seeing all the familiar characters from nursery rhymes and loved the catchy songs.  While I don't typically enjoy musicals, children's musicals seem to be the exception!  I think characters that Paige knew made it interesting for her and nostalgic for me since I grew up on them.

Her involvement with Tom Piper has come into a series of troubles with the conniving baddie Barnaby, played excellently by Ray Bolger, who pays two henchmen to do away with Tom so he can move into Mary's affections. Tom survives, and helps Mary to find little Bo Peep's sheep lost in the forest of no return along with other storybook children. This gives Barnaby, still on the prowl with his henchmen (who resemble Laurel & Hardy), yet another chance to do in Tom. However, Mary, Tom, & children discover Toyland with the help of talking trees, and join toymaker and goofball geek assistant with problems of meeting Christmas deadline for making toys. In the meantime, Barnaby has managed to get the formula gun used to shrink items to toy size and use to shrink all who stand in his way, including Tom. Tom joins forces with battle toys to intercept a wedding forced by Barnaby with Mary, and claims victory after a few mishaps with Barnaby, thus resolving story of Tom's love for Mary. Nice little fantasy featuring Disney favorite Ed Wynn as Toymaker, Tommy Kirk as geeky assistant, Annette Funicello as Mary, Tommy Sands as Tom Piper, and a puppet carrying Mother Goose.

1710805,3,B000065V3X,"Walt Disney decided to capitalize on his stable of stars by creating his first full-length live musical movie.  Disney stars Annette Funicello (""The Mickey Mouse Club,"" ""The Shaggy Dog""), Ed Wynn (""Mary Poppins,"" ""That Darn Cat (1965)""), Tommy Kirk (""Old Yeller,"" ""The Monkey's Uncle""), Henry Calvin (""Zorro,"" ""Toby Tyler""), Gene Sheldon (""Zorro,"" ""Toby Tyler"") and Kevin Corcoran (""Old Yeller"" and ""Toby Tyler"") all made appearances in this movie.

The plot of this movie is relatively simple, and all the scenes were filmed on sets.  Mary Contrary (Funicello) is going to wed Tom Piper (Tommy Sands, ""The Longest Day,"" ""Ensign Pulver"").  Unbeknownst to Mary, she will inherit a great deal of money when she gets married.  However, evil Barnaby, played by Ray Bolger (""The Wizard of Oz""), is aware of the inheritance.  Barnaby decides to enlist the aid of Gonzorgo (Calvin) and Roderigo (Sheldon) to do away with Tom.  Of course, in a Disney movie made for children people disappear, and that is what happens to Tom.

After a song and dance number, Tom and Mary realize that the children have gone off to the Forest of No Return to find Bo Peep's lost sheep.  Tom and Mary head off to find the children, only to learn that the forest is full of wonders both scary and delightful, including the Toymaker (Wynn) and his assistant Grumio (Kirk).  The ending is delightful stop-motion fun that is the best part of the movie.

The Good:  The entertainment is mostly family friendly.  The trees in the Forest of No Return are a little scary, and Barnaby is a schmuck, but with mom and dad close by even the littlest ones should be able to watch this film.  The Toymaker's shop (mansion?) is cute, and the special effects at the end are nice for 1961.

The Bad:  Where's the widescreen?  This movie's aspect ratio is 1.75:1, which means that this full screen version has cut a lot out.  The plot is simple.  It feels like an episode of ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" stretched to an hour and forty-five minutes.

There's a lot to like about this movie.  The stars are cheery and will remind some of us of when we were in love with Annette in the early 1960's.  Walt Disney was still at the helm and his movies had an innocent image about them.  However, if you are looking for a better version of the story, I recommend ""March of the Wooden Soldiers,"" featuring Laurel and Hardy.  That movie can be scary for little children, but it is better.

1710812,3,B000065V3X,"If this 1961 Disney musical reminds you a bit of  1939's WIZARD OF OZ, that's hardly surprising.  You got your fairy tale villages (well, Mother Goose,actually, but who's counting?): you've got spooky forests with trees that come alive and scare innocent children : and you've got Ray Bolger (this time as a bad guy, but still dancing up a storm when given a chance).  There's even an Ed Wynn connection, sort of, since the lovable comedian, seen in here in a fairly small role, reportedly once rejected the title role in the '39 classic because it was ""way too small.""  I guess, 22 years on, he had learned his lesson.

Apparently, both this version of BABES IN TOYLAND and the earlier Laurel and Hardy adaptation, took considerable liberties with the Victor Herbert stage play--to the point where you could say they were only loosely adapted on same.  Since the source work is not really considered a classic itself, such revisions probably shouldn't matter much.  Hollywood-izing (or ""Disney-izing"") classic fairy tales or children's literature is one thing, submitting a turn-of-the-century operetta to the the same treatment should not upset purists too much.

It is interesting to note, however, that by 1961, the thrust of the storyline had switched from a scheming uncle trying to rob children of their inheritance, to a Snidely Whiplash type villain out to force the beautiful, innocent young Mary (who despite her name and her cockle-shell full garden is anything but ""contrary""--in general anyway , although she lets her contempt for the villain, Barnaby, show) into marriage so that he rob her of HER inheritance (and presumably other things as well).  Of course to do so, he must dispatch her handsome young fiance, Tom Piper, which proves to be no easy task, after all, especially when the sole help this arch-villain can enlist are a couple of bumbling refugees from the old ZORRO TV series.

The fact that the Disney folks were thinking that older-teen style mushiness played better than little kid adventure may have been indicative of a change in the cinematic Zeitgeist--we're on the verge of the swingin' 60s after all--or maybe it just had to do with the fact that Annette was a hot Disney property at the time and they needed a plotline that would focus on her and NOT on the cute little kids (all supposed to be her younger siblings, it would appear).  In fact the screen emphasis on Annette and beau Tom Piper (Tommy Sands) is so great that aside from Ann Jillian (billed here as ""Ann Jilliann"") as Bo Peep, it's not even clear who the other kids are supposed to be.  Perennial Disney favorite, Kevin Corcoran, is listed as Boy Blue in the credits.  Who knew?  He doesn't even get to blow his horn.

So it's a kids' movie in which the actual kid actors get short shrift and little screen time.  Well, of course, Judy Garland was already an adolescent herself by the time she played Dorothy.  Annette is a bit older than that: I believe she's about 20 here, and while she in no way possesses the vocal power and acting chops of a young Garland, she certainly projects the girl-next-door charm that had become her trademark by this time.  Tommy Sands actually does have the smooth good looks and even smoother vocal style of a potential musical star, but he was born a bit too late for that genre's heyday.  This was to be his sole musical, unfortunately for him: and his regular job as a teenage idol endured about as long as his real-life marriage to Nancy Sinatra.  All in all, kind of a shame.

I was fascinated to learn (from a previous reviewer) that Disney himself had wanted to make a quality musical and was actually quite unsatisfied with this film.  He did manage to achieve that goal just four years later with MARY POPPINS.  As for BABES IN TOYLAND itself, it ain't half bad.  The musical numbers, many of which really were from the Victor Herbert operetta, are entertaining.  The choreography is pretty good (although the dance numbers could have been SHOT better).  The stop motion animation is pretty effective in the toy soldier battle scenes.  And the cast is quite good (and let me throw in a mention for Tommy Kirk as well, another appealing Disney regular of the era, who would soon be blackballed by the company for proving to be relatively uncloseted in his personal life).

Kids, who aren't too jaded by contemporary special-effects-laden fare, should enjoy the film.  The dialog and some of the lyrics are just sophisticated enough to give the adults something to savor as well (yes, they did that back then too: they just didn't have to ANNOUNCE it by giving all the wisecracks to a hip comedian like Robin Williams or Eddie Murphy).  All in all, not bad.",1180310400,2,4703,4.742014742014742

The colorful production design is sensational and reminds me of the early days of Disneyland - whimsically artificial but gorgeous to look at.  Sure, the story is Squaresville, and many complain that the set is too stagey, but those are main elements of the film's lasting charm.  Dated and corny to some is a cool breeze of nostalgia and simpler times for others.

I am sad that this DVD is shamefully bargain bin.  Apparently someone at Disney has deemed this delightful slice of early 60's pop culture woefully insignificant, so not only is the film greatly reduced to fit on standard televisions, but there are NO special features whatsoever, a shame considering that many of the original principals in the film are still with us.  Also, there was an episode of The Wonderful World of Disney called ""Backstage Party"", timed to promote the release of the film in 1961, featuring Walt and the cast on the set doing obviously staged but nonetheless delightful songs, dances, testimonials and stand-up routines.  What a shame that no one had the foresite to include this terrific extra - or ANYTHING - on this dvd.  (I had the good fortune of catching this episode on the Disney Channel late one night - so it at least exists!)

Still, there is a lot to be happy with here, again thanks to the splendiferous production design, tuneful songs and largely charming cast.

Her opening dance number was halfway decent, but her bland, uninspired performance goes steeply downhill from there. And let's not get started on that nasal monotone she calls singing! She was such a bad actress in this film, the only other person who turns in a more dismal acting performance is Mother Goose herself. It is such a chore to watch the two women in the same scene, trying to outbore each other. I think Ed Wynn's turn as The Toymaker is the only part worth watching of the whole lot. By the time the last scene plods on, with the supposedly-demure Mary leading her groom Tom down the church steps after their wedding, you are just too sleepy it doesn't even occur to you to question if her wedding gown was inspired by the Michelin Man or if she had her hat specially sent in from Sherwood Forest.

This DVD release at the time of my review of this film adds nothing to the VHS. No Widescreen, no re-mastering, and no extras. I will keep my VHS copy for now. Now on to the original film itself:

FILM REVIEW
In this 1961 film, the first true live-action musical from the Walt Disney Studio, Tommy Sands is paired up with America's girl next door who got her start with Walt Disney, Annette Funicello. Also the famous Ray Bolger and Ed Wynn are featured, and Ann Jillian was a child actor in this movie. There is more great talent from the Disney in-house stable of stars, Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran, who played brothers in both ""Old Yeller"" and ""Swiss Family Robinson"".

The story is simple enough, we are in Mother Goose land and the villain shrinks our heroes to toy size. They must enlist help from the toys in the Toymaker's shop to fight back. The effects were eye-popping at the time, and to see a toy army coming to life and fight the bad guys is a great treat for kids. The movie has some real fun stop motion style animation, where the toys are made to look like they are alive (30 years before computer animation did it for ""Toy Story""). The Christmas parade at Disneyland has featured replicas of the marching soldiers from this film for over 40 years. The beautiful wooden toys that are seen in the film were all designed by veteran animator Ward Kimball. (animators X. Atencio and Bill Justice joined Ward on the stop-animation to bring the custom made toys to life).

The movie was promoted in advance on the Walt Disney television show, in a 1961 episode that also promoted ""The Parent Trap"", (the episode is called ""The Title Makers""). The film was promoted again that year in an episode called ""Backstage Party"", which celebrated the completion of the film and gave the viewers a tour of the Disney Studio. The sets specially built for the film at the studio were so unique, they found a temporary home at Disneyland after the films release in '61 up to 1963, and people could actually see them up close inside the Opera House on Main Street.

The best part of this film is the music, which is the true star of any musical. The musical score features 11 songs from the in-house team of George Bruns (music) and Mel Leven (lyrics), and their score was nominated for an Academy Award.

But even with the music, great stars, incredible sets, special effects, nice costumes, the script and dialogue left a lot to be desired so the film was deemed dull for adults. Uncle Walt hated the end product, but gamely tried to promote it as best he could and use it as an exercise for the studio to learn from, as he really wanted to make a good musical.

All is set for a happily ever after wedding,when in steps the villain, Snidley Whiplash style: Barnaby, the crooked, greedy
banker. Only he knows that Mary will inherit""scads of money""when she marries, and is determined to marry her for her
inheritance. The scoundrel has Tom kidnapped.....and the story takes off from there, leading the heroes through forbidding forests and on to Toyland for a final showdown between Barnaby and Tom and his army of toy soldiers. Spectcular stop-motion

1710864,1,B000065V3X,"As someone who grew up on the classic Laurel & Hardy version, this version is totally unwatchable.  (Even if one hasn't seen the L&H version, this is still unwatchable.)  The songs are cringe-worthy.  The plot a watered down version of the original, with all the creativity sucked from it.  The original was a little bit like a Grimm fairy tell, with genuinely scary bits.  This has none of that.  No bogeyman, no three little pigs, no triumphant march of the wooden soldiers at the end.  (In the original, 6 foot soldiers battle the bogeyman and Barnaby, in this, ... little 6 inch soldiers pelt a ... Barnaby wannabe.  And the Laurel and Hardy characters start the film as villians!  ...

1710865,4,B000065V3X,"While it can't quite compare to the exemplary Laurel & Hardy 'March Of The Wooden Soldiers' this 1961 Disney version of the classic Victor Herbert operetta remains perfect holiday entertainment for young children.  As always you can rely on any Walt Disney film from this era, their golden age, to have a terrific music score replete with memorable songs, the requisite slapstick routines, a nasty villain you love to hate and of course a happy ending.  Ed Wynn as the Toymaker, Ray Bolger as the heavy, Mr. Barnaby, and especially Henry Calvin and Gene Sheldon as the hapless duo who assist Barnaby in his evil scheme are all fine; the climax of the film featuring the now legendary attack of the toy soldiers is handled quite well also.  The set design is well conceived and the photography is excellent making great use of the brilliant and splashy colors scattered throughout.  While it is thoroughly entertaining for the young audience at which it is squarely aimed to please it could be heavy going for adults who don't favor Disney films.  My advice is to relax, take off your thinking cap temporarily and enjoy the onscreen shenanigans and exuberant musical numbers presented here.",1041638400,6,1189,4.895522388059701

It's an incredible film for kids and those of us who are children at heart. It's full of memorable and hilarious scenes and music including ""Slowly, Slowly He Sank Into the Sea"".

1710868,5,B000065V3X,"Disney's film version of Victor Herbert's operetta BABES IN TOYLAND is a joyous delight that the whole family will cherish.
The story concerns Mary-Quite-Contrary (Annette Funicello) who is to be married to her sweetheart Tom Piper (Tommy Sands).  However, trouble lurks in the guise of the wicked Barnaby (Ray Bolger) who wants Mary to marry HIM!.  Barnaby enlists the help of two bumbling fools (Henry Calvin and Gene Sheldon) to kidnap Tom and throw him into the sea, but instead they sell Tom to a troupe of gypsies so that they may profit twice from their actions.  Barnaby also makes sure that Mary's only means of income - her sheep - get lost in The Forest of No Return, thus forcing her into matrimony.
However, the plan backfires and Tom is reunited with Mary.  But Bo-Peep (Ann Jillian) and the children have gone looking for the sheep in the dangerous Forest...
Just like your favorite Christmas ornament, this is something that comes out every year no matter what.  Disney's long-awaited DVD release of BABES IN TOYLAND is a great new way to ensure that this classic will live again for a new generation.

Tommy Sands and Annette Funicello play the young Tom and Mary (Quite Contrary) in a land populated by Mother Goose and her creations. The evil Barnaby (played by perfection by Ray Bolger) wants Mary for his own, and begins a series of plots that ends up with our heroes and a band of nursery rhyme children at the shop that really makes Santa Claus's toys, working for the bumbling toymaker (Ed Wynn) and his brainy assistant (Tommy Kirk).
This is a film from the golden age of the live-action Disney musical, back when Haley Mills was cranking out a new film every other month. Although she's not in this one, there is a very young Ann Jillian. There have been many versions of this film both before and after -- this is the best.

1710871,3,B000065V3X,"I give this product 3 stars because of the quality of the DVD, not the film itself.  ""Babes in Toyland"" may not be ""Snow White"" or ""Mary Poppins,"" but it was the first-ever live action musical for Disney, and it remains a well-respected classic among Disneyphiles... and deserving of something better than a cheap, poor quality FULL FRAME release with no extras at all (not even a trailer).  With a colorful whismsy and imagination nothing short of ""Willy Wonka"" and aspirations of ""Wizard of Oz"", ""Babes in Toyland"" has always been a Disney staple, and it's simply amazing that something like ""The Swiss Family Robinson"" gets a 2-disc deluxe treatment while this is cast off as a cheapie release.  OK, all we need is:  anamorphic widescreen, some major remastering (there is grain all over the place!), the original trailer, and the only other necessary extra is the episode of Walt Disney Presents where Walt takes us backstage and behind-the-scenes...  there it is, a complete 50-minute documentary already complete, edited, and paid for.  Just slap it on the disc with the trailer and a remastered widescreen print, and Disney will do this classic real justice.  Alas, these are simply pipe dreams, I suppose.  As it stands, buy it if you want the film at all... because I seriously doubt we'll ever see another release of this classic.  And that's a real shame.",1034294400,8,1366,4.878787878787879
1710872,4,B000065V3X,"Since there are NO special features on this new remastered DVD, I continue to wait for a stereo surround version in widescreen -
(if that's ever going to be possible!).
The colors ARE brightly crisper and the digital surround sound is in fabulous mono, but Disney obviously didn't remaster the original film negatives as you can still see specks during the feature and even an occasional upper-right 'filmroll change' small circle (a blemish on film indicating one of the 35mm rolls on one of the 2 projectors showing the flick was about to run out!).
The picture also looks uncentered at times (possibly because of the way the original was filmed), esp noted on the right-side in the 'book opening' credits, along with other scenes - e.g. 'Won't Be Happy 'Till We Get It'; you only see half of Roderigo's (Gene Sheldon) head at the end of that muscial segment.
But auspiciously, if you're a devoted fan of this movie for the music and Annette, Sands, Bolger, Ed Wynn and a young Ann Jillian (credit says 'Jilliann') and you have a DVD player getting a little bored, then it's worth the under $18 purchase.
This being Disney's first musical production, it's ironic they never released an 'authentic' original soundtrack for this classic. The old Disneyland vinal LP's/45's of this film in the sixties only featured remakes and Ted Cassidy ('Lurch' of Addams Family) doing the Barnaby character, so this definately makes up for that.",1034294400,,1432,4.872950819672131
1710893,3,B000065V3X,"Please do not stone me with toys, but I have to confess, I found this film rather tedious, at least through the first half.
Comparisons to ""The Wizard of Oz"" are right on the money, down to the ""living"" trees, and our first glimpse of Toyland (looking suspiciously similar to The Emerald City). And Annette (still credited here with her single-name Mouseketeer moniker despite having grown out of her Mouse Ears), does a very good impression of Judy Garland from ""Oz"". In fact, Disney seems to have gone out of their way to make Annette look like Judy (hair, clothes, song selection, you name it).
Now, Ray Bolger is just excellent as the ""Oil Can Harry,"" classic old movie black-hat villain. However, his bumbling mercenaries, although funny, are pretty much just a ripoff of Laurel & Hardy. And Tommy Sands? The kid runs around the movie wearing a hairdoo that looks like a cat is pearched atop his noggin. He also suffers from some bad dubbing in some of his songs. He doesn't do much to strike the viewer as a big hero, either.
Still, things do pick up. Once the characters manage to find their way out of the forest, so does the script. Once in Toyland, we meet Ed Wynn, who is the perfect Toymaker. The Toymaker's inventive assistant offers up wonderful toy-making gadgets, and the villain causes villainous villainry.
One facet of the film that sets it apart from other studios is the simple use of animation. When being bonked on the head, a character see stars literally swirling around, and the toy army is nicely animated in stop motion.
The idea is great, and the characters are just fine, but the production is spotty throughout the first half, perhaps even too long, making the film more tedious than full of the usual Disney wonder and charm.
As for letting the kids watch, you'll have no worries there. The film is so sappishly innocent, that even a simple kiss between two sweethearts is forbidden (even Mickey got to get in a smootch now and then!). However, little kids may be scared by the trees, and by Ray Bolger when he attacks Toyland and battles the toy army.",1033257600,,2084,4.635135135135135

I think the costumes are great and the sets fantastic.  Watching this movie again ""all grown up"", I think it's as good as when I watched it as a kid.
