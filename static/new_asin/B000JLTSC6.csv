8151844,5,B000JLTSC6,"I am an ardent fan of Danish cinema.  This film, based on a Moliere play, is so rich, dense and at the same time luminous, that on a 1-5 scale I will give it a 10.
A story in which every character hides something, reveals something, is afraid of someone, it more than lives up to its title.  The acting, overall, is beyond superb.
The libretto is a masterpiece: a no point can you really guess what is going to happen next.  The director, writer and principal actor is a genius. The chicken metaphor reminds me of an earlier, much darker Italian film.  But this one does leave you a tears in your eyes and a big smile.  I just saw it.  I ran to buy it.
2018.  I have seen it again.  If anything, it gets better with age.  Unfortunately, it the ONLY Clausen film you will see in Region 1.  All of the others are Pal, and NFX doesn't even recognize clausen!",1277164800,,855,4.158536585365853
