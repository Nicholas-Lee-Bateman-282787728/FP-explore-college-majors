4043406,5,B0030BYWU0,"My six-year-old daughter loves reading, and loves learning new vocabulary. It was not too long ago that she and I discovered the PBS Kids' program, ""Martha Speaks"". The show is about a dog named Martha who gains the gift of speaking after she eats some alphabet soup. She has plenty of adventures with her best buddy Skits (another dog) and several other neighborhood animals and people. There are eight episodes on this DVD, i.e. Raiders of the Lost Art, Says It With Flowers, Martha Gets Spooked, Martha Changes Her Luck, There Goes the Neighborhood, Ice Scream, Martha Sings, and TD Makes the Band.

Each episode, like all Martha episodes teaches children vocabulary, and most importantly, teach the use of these words in context. This show is a great teaching resource, and the stories are engaging. ""Martha Speaks"" has become one of my daughter's favorite children's shows!",1292371200,2,878,5.013698630136986

4043408,5,B0030BYWU0,"This DVD has an even better choose of episodes than the first DVD release with characters who didn't make it into the previous DVD release.  The first episode is the title one MARTHA GOES TO SCHOOL where thanks to TD Martha become his and Helan's subsitute teacher in animal behavior class.  This follows with TD  misunderstanding his teacher assignment of Thomas Edison and creates a movie that has little to do with his subject. This episode does do a neat Harry Potter spoof.  Then Martha in next episode is embarrassed with Skits acting like a character on a TV show,  This is followed by a 2 part episode (both parts being on this one DVD) where Martha ends up in the pound and introduces the animal control character who is seen in later episodes in the series.  The next episode stars Truman and is a good episode about self image and how it important not to let what others think of your look effect you.  Truman also stars in the next episode where his electric spelling bee prize drive neighbor dog wild and traps him and most of the cast in a tree all episode until Martha can find a way to save them.  Final episode we had a hot summer day and Martha tries to take every mind off things by telling her own mad cap version of traditional fairy tales.

This DVD also include coloring pages and educational interactive games for the young minds.",1280188800,4,1354,4.471544715447155

4043412,5,B0030BYWU0,"while there are other top favorite episodes I wish could of made this DVD it has a large number of ones I really enjoy. Based on the children book series this DVD helps little kids learn vocabulary words while older kids will find enjoyable strictly from an entertainment stand point.  Being the first DVD to be release of the series however I was surprise that the episode MARTHA SPEAKS where Martha starts talking for the first time wasn't included here.  What are including among the 8 fifteen minute episodes that include TD, Helen and Martha trying to get pass a dog hating janitor to switch art drawings, Martha trying to make up for her past mistakes by doing something nice for grandma on her birthday but have trouble finding the right gift. Martha delivers flowers from the flower shop to a haunted house and sends TD, Helen and Martha into the type of spooky hi jinx you'd expect from the Hardy Boys. Martha learns about being a racist in a family friendly manner when Alice and Helen is making a fuss over a kitten.  When Truman says he never eat ice cream Alice goes above and beyond being annoying to try to make him eat it.  Helen and her family learn that while Alphabet soup makes Martha talks eating Helen's music home work makes her sing and she tries everything and ask everyone to try to find someone to stop her singing.  TD and his school friends form a neighborhood band. unfortunately they only know one song. About Belgium.",1268784000,12,1449,4.579150579150579

4043426,5,B0030BYWU0,"My granddaughter and I watch Martha Speaks faithfully. We both love her charm and the difficulties that arise whenever she appears.

Martha is a yellow dog, and one day when Martha was eating alphabet soup, the letters went to her brain, and from thatcday on, she could speak. Martha could not only speak, but she seems to know everything. For children who live animals and funnybsituations, this series is the best thing for them. Martha and the groupnshe lives with, family, are kind and friendly. However, like everyone they get into trouble or difficulties, as we say. Martha with her wisdom or by chance seems to find the correct response to find her way out of any difficulty

Parents and adults will like this show. It is perfect for lessons learned, as well as entertainment for their children. Perfect situations, colorful and well written episodes, just written for children.
