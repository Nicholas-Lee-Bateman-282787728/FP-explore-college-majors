2859168,3,B000R5NZ3W,"Puzzlehead's body is android as imagined by 1980s sci-fi, with fake skin and metal innards. But in a new twist on the Frankenstein myth, Walter uses his own psyche as the software on Puzzlehead's mental hard drive. The two are equally inhuman in the movie's first scenes, but as Puzzlehead starts to experience some of Walter's emotions, he becomes the character we sympathize with. What did Walter build him for? Does it have something to do with the beautiful, but unhappy Russian woman who owns a shop down the street?

It does. The old Frankenstein plot, where the Monster takes out his jealousy and anger at the good Doctor by murdering his beloved, gets a twist here, too. Both android and android maker fall for the same girl. But it's only natural--they're two men with the same brain.

While the twists are fairly predictable, and Galaida's twin performances seem more than artfully flat, Puzzlehead is a fascinating, new look at an old fable. Writer-director Bai's interest, however, is clearly in the art of the endeavor, not the philosophy. Expect to be wowed by the world and the visuals, not so much the plot.",1186876800,9,1123,4.813471502590674

2859170,3,B000R5NZ3W,"This was okay, why is it that scientists are portrayed as insensitive jerks?  I don't know, why go through all of the hardwork to create something that develops its own intelligence just to become jealous of it and try to become it?  This movie did keep me occupied as I wanted to know the ending but at the same time, I was wondering about how this movie showed the depravity of human life.  The robber, the rape, the doctor, Puzzlehead, each of them out for themselves at the expense of the female lead Julia.  It would be nice for just once to watch a movie without having to endure the ""weekness"" of a woman and the treachery of her 'fickle"" mind.  I don't know.  It seems man has to always do something to turn his creation into a ""frankenstein.""",1404950400,2,751,4.366906474820144
2859171,4,B000R5NZ3W,"A man named Walter (Stephen Galaida) fashions an android he calls PUZZLEHEAD, in his own image. He instills his creation w/ his memories, as well as his psychological makeup. All is well until both Walter and his ""twin"" fall for the same woman (Robbie Shapiro). Her name is Julia, and she helps PUZZLEHEAD to imprison Walter and take his place. Growing conflicted, Julia betrays PUZZLEHEAD, causing him to take drastic measures. Will either creator or creation survive? PUZZLEHEAD is a well-made film about identity and what it means to be human. Don't expect laser battles or explosions, just solid, intriguing science fiction...",1391385600,,630,5.186274509803922
2859172,4,B000R5NZ3W,"I read the Frankenstein comparisons but after the man creates the lifeform bit I think the comparisons end. It could just as well be compared to a ton of other stories but more important is the Artificial Intelligence theme found here.
I believe the author wanted us to root for one persona one moment, then the other the next, but in truth, one of these personas is a real jerk. So after choosing who you're going to root for you're then given some relative morality that I didn't quite buy, but then the other persona is not worth rooting for at that point either.
I wish the characters would not have developed at that point because I wanted them cut and dry. Oh well, can't always have it my way. Still a decent and enjoyable film once you get past the loud narration.",1374969600,2,772,4.405594405594406
2859173,2,B000R5NZ3W,"After some ten or fifteen minutes of this one, we decided we did not want to finish it.  The acting and dialogue were just too flat to hold our interest, and the story--such as we saw of it--seemed predictable.  It would have been better if Rod Serling had been around to write and direct it.",1365033600,,292,4.290909090909091
2859174,4,B000R5NZ3W,"Intelligent, low key sci-fi piece, impressive looking for it's reported
budget of $500K. This has thematic echoes of films like David
Cronenberg's ""Dead Ringers"".

In a near future dystopia, a scientist builds a robot that looks like
him, and has his memories. They end up both competing for the same
girl. While the story's basic building blocks are familiar, the acting is quite
good (especially for a no-name cast), and there is more thought put
into the creepy, complex philosophical and moral elements, and the
moody muted tone then into cheap scares.

The ending is a bit of a let down, in that it feels a bit more
formulaic. But overall this is an impressive first film by a director
who sadly has yet to make another.",1314835200,,725,4.700787401574803
2859175,1,B000R5NZ3W,"I'm sorry, but this film is really bad. It makes very little sense. Maybe if it was pitched as a sci-fi black comedy I could give it a better wrap. Sadly it has the potential to be incredible, but I cringed watching it all the way through. It gets worse as the film progresses. The director has a few simple cinematic tricks up his sleeve, but overall the film is just... bad.

The characterisation is confusing and the acting is fairly awful. Stephen Galaida is the worst, most ham-fisted android of all time. It's almost as though the only role research he did was to watch the first episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation Season 1 and copy DATA (badly). And he's the flattest, dullest, most monotone actor you could imagine. The fact that he plays BOTH roles blows my mind. I'll grant he is physically suited to the role of the android. Especially that bad hair. My partner even commented on the scene-stealingly bad hair.

The rhythm of the plot is badly paced and at times laughable. The plot devices are rudimentary and guessable for anybody who has watched bad TV drama. If you like robbers with guns, you're in for a great time. Oh, how menacing! I'm living in a futuristic dystopia where anything can happen and here comes a ROBBER...

For those who say it's steampunk or whatever, there's only one sentence at the beginning of the film where the narrator (the android) tells the audience about the world. After that there's little sense of place in the film. What happened to the old adage, ""show, don't tell""?

The female lead character is a cardboard cut-out, disempowered, fragile woman with a terrible Eastern European accent. It is almost as though the writers of the film have never met a woman before. Seriously. The way they portrayed her pregnancy and birth were comical if not for the intended seriousness of the subject matter (""The baby is coming""...""Okay""... let's STRAP her into an ambulance like some victim). And I'm sorry, but how does any real woman go from attempting suicide, to wanting to play house with the man who raped her, to wanting to keep the baby, ALL IN THE SPACE OF 10 MINUTES IN THE FILM? (And make sure you don't miss out on the actress's eyes blinking when she is in the bathtub possibly meant to be dead).

I could say more but I'll save my breath. Watch this film if you want to cringe. It's got a small glimmer of hope at times, but overall it's just a train wreck. If you like the ""so bad it's good"" class of movies, maybe give it a watch.",1265068800,,2491,4.5144124168514415
2859176,4,B000R5NZ3W,"Artistic, the main actor is real good.  Will definatly suit people who like dark, grey, twisted, confusion mixed with suppossed morality.. like me.",1253232000,,147,5.391304347826087
2859177,4,B000R5NZ3W,"Puzzlehead was an amazing movie considering the low budget nature of the film.

What I found most striking was how well this movie shows that good Cyberpunk can be made on a low budget.

Cyberpunk is simply the eventual evolution of humanity, whereby we make the leap to incorporate artificial devices into our own bodies.  It's already been around for many centuries in the form of jewelery and tattoos in some sense, but now more than ever the true Cyberpunk is starting to emerge.  Dependence and even an accepted social desire to incorporate technology as part of our being.  Take for example the revolutionary mobile phone, wearable computers, Ipods, electronic clothing, more and more advanced watches, personal torches, bluetooth devices etc.  How long do you think it will be till people decide to skin graft a mobile phone(using better transmission mediums than RF energy transmission), into there skin?  Already there are studies into biological data transmission.  The ability to transmit data simply by shaking someone elses hand.  This technology exists now along with organ cloning.

Is that a scary thought?  I don't believe so at all.  In fact it's anything but.  Imagine organs were allowed to be commercially grown.  It would spell the death of illegal organ harvesting.

Puzzle head is a movie about the ultimate in human creativity and imagination.  For centuries man has contemplated the idea of making machines think, behave and even feel like a human beings. It would simply be one of the most amazing if not ultimate achievements.  Robotics and Cybernetics fascinates people such as myself as it is an area where we discover just how incredible we are.  The complexity of creating hardware to allow a machine to think and make decisions is simply daunting.  There are so many possibilites to acheive the same goal, yet only limited hardware to make the idea work.  Hence all robotics ends up being a compromise.  So too does any device to aid organic machines(in other words our very own human bodies), yet slowly but surely advances in articicial eye sight, power assisted limbs and mobility vehicles becomes a reality.

Puzzle head is a slow movie that may not appeal to viewers who look to Cyberpunk for a thrill ride, however it does have some really great moments if your a technologist and can look past the budget special effects(which to be honest really suited the sets (main a large house), that most of the movie takes place in.

The story also highlighted the possibilities of what happens when a being becomes sentient and able to think for itself. How to have freedom and then have it taken away from you, will change you.  Also how parents must feel when there children come into the world.

Puzzlehead starts as a dumb robot but over a long period of time begins to learn, think and even feel.  Eventually it's as if Puzzle head is more human than his creator.

This movie is in short some of the most excellent in Cyberpunk movies I have ever seen.  Sure it will not compete with Blade runner for scope but I give it 4 stars for achieving a great story with a lot of thought provoking drama on a tight budget.

This movie spells great hope for those like myself who wish to make great movies but want to do so through thoughtful story writing that will work with what's around them.

Terrific Cyberpunk and essential viewing for anyone who is a fan of robotics, cybernetics or artificial lifeforms.

8199009,4,B000R5NZ3W,"Not only does Puzzlehead appear to be set in a dystopia, it looks as if it were filmed in one. As an indie sci-fi movie it is excellent and the filmmakers do a great job of making virtues out of necessities (e.g. make the wooden acting and the low budget a part of the odd and dystopic vibe). While the scoring was surprisingly well-done, overall the sound is poor (as other reviewers have noted).

8199011,2,B000R5NZ3W,"One word that sums up the entire movie: dreary. I really tried to like this movie. It has a good concept and is intelligent. But its execution is flawed because of the pace, lighting, and overall tone. I can see why film students and similarly inclined people would enjoy this movie but it is largely inaccessible to people who aren't formally or at least well-acquainted with how symbolism, reference, and other artistic tropes are used in cinema.

If you like the more technical aspects of movie-making as well as nuance and subtlety, then maybe you'll like this movie. But even then, if a movie or story can't hold your attention, then it can't hope to achieve what it set out to.",1431648000,,683,4.644628099173554
