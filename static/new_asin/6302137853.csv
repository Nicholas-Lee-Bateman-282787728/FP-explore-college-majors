7821820,3,6302137853,"""Birth of a Legend/Tale of an Egg"" - maybe the title should have warned me.  This is probably a terrific video and very educational if you are between 4 & 8.  I personally do not prefer to watch Walter K. cavorting with a classroom full of children (shudder) while reciting appropriate dina-info for this age group.  No doubt baby dinosaurs were very cute, but I really didn't feel a need to go on about it - or to watch cute little critter graphics dance about.
Warn a person next time about the age level of a video.  Luckily I have 8 grandsons, seven of whom are under 6, so I won't have a probelm disposing of it.
This video is probably really a 4 or 5, if you are buying it for children.  I only gave it a three out of pique.
