The use of lecture,PowerPoint, DVD presentations of actual sessions makes this DVD a well produced easy to watch DVD.  Most importantly, I found the material to be useful in my practice evaluating children in the child welfare system.  Dr. Becker-Weidman explains the concepts very well.  I now have a framework for evaluating children with trauma and attachment disorders that I use in my practice.

The approach is grounded in Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy, which is an evidence-based, effective, and empirically validated treatment.

7795082,1,0982288301,"Don't buy this DVD. I am sure that it contains some useful information. But unfortunately it is packaged into two hours of a guy standing there talking, SLOWLY, without even focusing in on his power points. I got so bored waiting for him to get going that I downloaded the Cook, et al. white paper on this topic (for free) and read it while the DVD mumbled on.  For the price of this DVD, buy a good textbook or two and forget about it!",1254355200,,436,4.190476190476191
