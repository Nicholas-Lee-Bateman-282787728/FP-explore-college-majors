7031369,4,B00UA00GNG,"Long-awaited finale to Season 2 continues in the same vein as previous entries.  Satisfying except for the fact that the ending is abrupt and wide open, leaving the story unfinished and unresolved due to cancellation of the series.",1440460800,,231,5.078947368421052
7031370,5,B00UA00GNG,"I bought the whole series. I was unable to watch it on television because I refuse to pay the outrageous prices Dish network charges for anything above the (mostly infomercial) basic service.  So my only ability to watch the series was by DVD. I bet a lot of people find that the only way they can watch it. The series got cancelled and I read the reasons like time slot and family friendly vs darker storylines. Being of  social security age I can remember studying mythology in school and movies like Jason and the Argonaughts. The writers of Atlantis had the ability to use any and all mythological figures, and add historical figures like Pythagorus. I think they went south and started to lose me with the dark period. They let Pasiphae blaspheme and defy the gods without instant retribution and they introduced the ""gay factor"" in a more than implied fashion and I suppose they did not learn from series like ""Legend of the Seeker"" and did not care about ""family friendly"" or that not everyone wants to actually witness homosexual activity even as basic as same sex kissing. I wanted to see the father of Icarus be Archimedes and considering the massive amount of already well established characters they could work in, I was disappointed with the meager selection. It seemed the writers were zig zagging and not following an actual outline and the episodes of the small band taking on ""dirty work"" and helping the needy were good episodes but to me missed the opportunity to add characters for the later voyage. Imagine if Jason and Ariadne were able to build their eventual Argonaught crew during those episodes and then have Ariadne's brother return to take up the fight against Pasiphae while they were adventuring. The oracle travelling with them would make keeping tabs on the action back in Atlantis viable. Turning Adriadne into a brooding, snivelling doubter of her husband's faithfulness was a real turn off and it was too easy for someone that in love to be believable and it diminished her strong woman appeal. Overlooked was that Madea in this fantasy is Jason's first cousin and they could have had a blood/familial bond instead of sexual attraction. Maybe Jason's dad's brother (his uncle) married Pasiphae's sister and someone let it leak that Pasiphae had them killed to get her brother in law out of the throne succession line. Turning Madea to Jason and Adriadne when she found out would have fit in neat. Madea and Adriadne's brother worked for me as another couple against Pasiphae.  Anyway I noticed there are few one or two star reviews for the rest of the series and I find that remarkable. Instead of grading the show for what it did not contain I am going to overlook the gay factor and give my 5 star rating for the whole series and not just this final installment. The cast was so very good and the chemistry was excellent everywhere that I want to honor that. I have not been as disappointed to see a series get cancelled since Firefly even though I can rationalize the reasons this series was cancelled while with Firefly I cannot.",1440374400,3,3068,4.720149253731344
7031371,4,B00UA00GNG,"So disappointed to see this show come to an end.. Even more disappointed that we will never know how Jason and Ariadne's love prevails, over all the trials and road blocks that were thrown their way. Some of the scenes in Season 2 part 2 were hard to watch especially Jason's heart blackening. However, I was really looking forward to seeing how it all played out for Jason and Ariadne with the help of Hercules and Pythagoras, becoming victorious and ruling Atlantis together..",1440201600,,478,4.771084337349397
7031372,3,B00UA00GNG,"Sad to say...I probably won't miss it.
And the ending was disappointing.

I understand that they were banking on being renewed for many seasons to come.
Hence the whole cliffhanger.
But in my honest opinion if they wanted success there was a lot that could've/should've been handled differently.
Ariadne's sudden ascent to the throne, Telemon(the character), The Whole Ariadne/Jason/Medea love triangle, The introductions of Cassandra & Icarus, The writing off of the oracle(Juliet Stevenson), The re-introduction of Medusa, The whole Jason's heart blackening thing (those episodes were painful to watch and could've been more believable if they went on building it up through  the seasons), and lastly the reluctance to let Pasiphae die. I'm sorry but her just suddenly coming back from the dead-that was annoying.
Also, they could've just scrapped 2x05. Zombies,really?
Better luck next time guys. Merlin was great and this had potential but your rushing the story kinda deflated it for your audience.
If you're gonna try it. Stick to season 1.",1439164800,,1046,5.333333333333333

Like other shows presented by this writer, he leaves us wanting more, waiting to see if he will complete it. Overall a very good series, but like I said, not the end. We all know the legend of Atlantis so be warned this is not the end, not by a long shot!",1443312000,,414,4.0

8704829,5,B00UA00GNG,"I love this series! An interesting take on the tale of Atlantis filled with goofy, heroic, yet flawed characters you can't help but love. Put together by the same creators of BBC's Merlin, this show is definitely worth a watch!",1478822400,,227,4.7

8704831,3,B00UA00GNG,Didn't think this one was as good as the previous - mainly due to the open ending when the series was not going to be continued.  That took a lot away from the rest of this season for me.,1472601600,,187,3.7948717948717947
