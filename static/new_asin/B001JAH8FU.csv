8312471,2,B001JAH8FU,"i don't often post reviews, but when i do, its usually because the item really really sucks.  This DVD is of the worst video quality and the scripting and ""instruction"" is torpid at best, all the while being narrated by some robot using a variety of scripts that read more like made-for-tv ads for companies like Hi-Lift and Ramsey. Shabby, shabby, shabby. Save your money and by a dvd from Andrew St. Pierre White or become a subscriber on his website.  alternatively, Tom Shepard's 4x4 book is probably one of the best out there for an instructional standpoint.  I like video's because they put a real life spin on hardback instructional, but this is most definitely not one of them",1461715200,,684,4.683333333333334
8312472,4,B001JAH8FU,Great video to watch if you have never used a winch before. Lots of good common sense info for new winch owners.,1366156800,,112,4.136363636363637
8312473,5,B001JAH8FU,"I really liked this DVD and will watch it again to make sure I have the recovery techniques down pat. I also plan to buy some of the equiment that those in the DVD use. I appreciate that this did not end up being a commercial, but the products presented  in the DVD make alot of sense and I plan to purchase them and have them available for my next backcountry experience.",1356220800,2,372,4.166666666666667
8312474,2,B001JAH8FU,"There is some good content in this, and it is clear the producers have done a lot of 4x4ing in their time.

However, the production quality is so poor it is hard to watch this DVD.  Honestly speaking, this would fail a basic film course in any Community College in the US.  The narration is monotone and quickly read from a script, and often the accompanying video footage has nothing to do with the content.  The same shots are rehashed over & over again, reinforcing the impression that the makers are long on experience but short on teaching skills.

The makers may want to review Bill Burke's DVDs for tips on how to make a good intructional video on 4x4ing.",1349136000,3,662,4.483333333333333
