The form is shown from a few angles, the self defense applications explained and the movements taught in a classroom situation, step by step.  In a separate section, you are taught how to use the body for each part of  the form.  The tape is well done and Tseng Yun Xiang, the teacher, performs  it so beautifully.  It is worth practicing this snake form even if you are  not interested in fighting, but just to be able to be fluid and flexible.  You really should see this.",963878400,15,549,4.42

7911842,4,B00000J31A,"This video I have had my eye on for a few years now, and when I got it oh boy......it didn't disappoint.....completely. The film production is half assed at best. Master Bob Klien should just butt out of the video series completely, since he is not nice to look at or even seem like he has a clue to what he is doing. Master Xiang's english is very hard to understand and you have to nod your head and watch. But to me that's knit picking. Even though you can't understand Xiang half the time his actions make up for his lack or pronounciation. And the form is from Wudang, so if you ever take it to a tournament, you may have a chance. The angles of the form and the outside sun lighting are excellent. The indoor lighting however is like that of an HD 8 bit videogame from a garbage can that has been pooped on by Oscar the Grouch. The applications of the form make since to, dispite this being an animal style and fighting applications from them are usually impractical. But these applications can be used in self defense or competition....or if you can do it.",1321056000,3,1063,4.32
7911843,5,B00000J31A,"I came upon this DVD by chance and was pleasantly surprised. You can really get feeling of the style and ingest the material. I like that the form is presented in different angles and the slow motion version is especially useful. I found very rewarding to try to emulate the movements at the similar, very slow pace, which is very hard, but truly helpful in opening proper energy channels.
The performance is very smooth and graceful, from my perspective, clearly of the higher class than large majority of other DVD instruction videos I saw.
Yes, it would be nice to have a version with Chinese/pinyin names for the strikes and postures (that can discover a lot to some practitioners), as well as the more detailed martial art applications, including target acu-points. But I don't know such advanced DVD in public sale yet and saw such such level of information presented only through personal instructions.
In my opinion the current DVD is great, 5 star material, for beginner to intermediate audience.",1300060800,,1005,4.91764705882353
7911844,2,B00000J31A,"I just purchased Snake style Kung Fu based on the above reviews and was disappointed.  I suppose you could say beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but are we looking at the same thing?

Here are my specific observations:
1. -The form is presented as Wudang mountain-snake style and it is implied that it is related to taijiquan. This particular form appears to be ""new Wudang"" or contemporary wushu and in my opinion, not particularly good contemporary wushu.

2. The form is not dynamic or fluid as characterizes most wudang and taiji forms. It is also not explosive either. The choreography did not wow me in the least and  I had to sit through the video hoping to see something of value to get out of the experience. Again, disappointed.

3. Tseng's movements correctly originate from the legs and center (most of the time) but he does not carry the movements through his arms effectively.  In other words the power is not correctly transmitted. In fact, he appears to shake and vibrate all of the power out of the movements before they are expressed. For experienced practioners of taijiquan, fajing (explosive energy movements) are expressed through a wave, but the wave is linked and results in a proper alignment resulting in force being concentrated, extended, and reinforced by linear vectors. The start of the vector is typically the legs. The end of the vector is the target. None of this is present.  Tseng's arm movements tend to be partially or even largely independent of what is going on with the rest of his body, and he does not appear to have much root (sometimes hard to determine based on a video.) That is not to say that he is uncoordinated, but rather that his understanding of the form and how to use it as a weapon appears to be limited. It is also likely that the form as it is presented has little direct martial application other than to develop ""coordination"", balance, and fitness.

4. ""Master"" Bob Klien, was slightly more internal than Tseng, but as with his Sword video, just as awkward as usual. He takes on the role of student in the video and continuously does the movements in a heavy and imprecise manner. I actually have no idea why Klien was in the video at all in any capacity other than as a narrator.

5. The scripting in the video was completely useless. I am not sure if they actually bothered to write a script. Klien repeatedly says *""Notice this, and Notice that. (He might have said, ""Notice that master Tseng has two arms and two legs, etc."" ouch) The musical background was completly irritating, but probably because I was disappointed in what I was watching.

Well that's all. It is not my intention to  insult anyone. It is my assumption that Master Klien must have learned a great deal about martial arts and benefitted from his studies over the course of many years. Unfortunately, it has not been well presented in either of his two videos that I have seen.

7911845,5,B00000J31A,"This DVD presents the legendary Wu Dan Mountain Snake Form which was one of the original forms taught by Chang-San-Feng, originator of Tai-chi-Chuan Kung-fu.  (Tai-chi-Chuan means ""Grand Ultimate Fist"" and the term ""Kung-fu"" is used to denote Chinese martial arts in general).

Snake style is very loose, fluid and lighning quick (like a snake's strike).  It will loosen and strengthen every joint in the body.  This is an ""internal"" martial art meaning that it uses internal energy (""chi"") which is much more powerful than muscle tension.  The techniques are unorthodox, unexpected and devastating and include kicking, punching, finger strikes and grappling.

The snake form can also be used as an aerobic exercise to develop flexibility, muscle tone and the sharpness of attention.  This DVD includes demonstrations of the snake form from several angles and speeds, self defense applications of the movements, step by step instructions for each movement and a discussion with Master Tseng, Yun Xiang (the teacher) about the style.

7911846,4,B00000J31A,"I have no complaints about the video itself, I think it is a well done video. It would make a great video if you are using it for exercise intentions only. This particular style of kung fu is not good for defense purposes. He gives instructions and all, but in the real world, it would not be very effective form to use. I've seen the snake style used in movies, so I wanted to try it out first hand. This is not the same stuff I see in the movies.
 Like I said before it's good for exercising and good for anyone who wishes to learn Snake style kung-fu. Some of the moves taught in this form are very graceful. I must give warning! In order to do the whole form your going to need a lot of space. (Possibly outside space). The instructor gives first class instructions, he first teaches you the form and then the application. Not a bad video.",1033948800,4,843,4.203703703703703
7911847,5,B00000J31A,"One could say bad things about the production quality of many a Bob Klein produced video and be quite right, however, the instruction provided by them seems to make up for lack of aesthetics. Mr. Tseng is clearly a talented and experienced kung fu practitioner, but it is obvious that he is unfamiliar with teaching through this medium, he appears nervous at times, most likely because of his infamiliarity with being on camera. Regardless of this films shortcomings there is a lot of knowledge here and anyone who practices kung fu would have no difficulty learning the Snake set presented in here. I certainly recomend this tape if you want a foundation for this animal forms' techniques and basic applications, but have no sifu in your area who teaches this system.",1033516800,2,768,4.870229007633588
7911848,5,B00000J31A,"this video is great! it is skillfully performed by Tseng-Yun Xiang, and is very graceful. the form is explored from a full speed demonstration, to detailed piece by piece instruction, to slow motion demonstration, and its use as self defense (it is also pointed out that the self defense application can be altered from the original form depending on the pracitioner, ex. open hand form movements can be altered to closed fists for self defense,etc.) if you do not have the option of learning kung fu from personal instruction, then this tape is the way to go. it can be learned piece by piece in your own home at your own rate. i have many tapes on different martial arts, i found this one to be one of the best taught and put together.",1031529600,17,737,4.507462686567164
