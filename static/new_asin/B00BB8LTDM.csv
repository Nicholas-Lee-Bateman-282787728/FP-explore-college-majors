5569288,5,B00BB8LTDM,A very good family story and easy to follow. I liked the way it picked up from Nim's Island so even if you didn't see the first one you still knew what was going on and easy to catch onto the story of it.,1371254400,6,204,3.659090909090909

Bindi Irwin is a great actress and the other cast members shine, too. The animal interaction is terrific and this is a story which all young people should see. Lots of action and fun!",1368057600,9,323,4.4

It is a very clean movie, with no bad language and not even any kissing, which is great!!  It's a fun adventure movie that we all enjoyed.  We hope to see Bindi in other movies.  She's a great actress and we are proud of her.",1365206400,9,392,4.038961038961039
5569294,5,B00BB8LTDM,"This film has lots of action, very funny and is definitely great for the whole family to see.

Let's return to Nim's Island to see how things are going with Nim (Bindi Irwin) and her Father (Matthew Lillard). One day they get a message that some people will be buying the island to build an attraction there, but Nim will not stand for it and comes up with some things to do to save what she calls home. She will do almost anything to protect the island and the animals that she loves so well. Everything is going fine until Edmund, (Toby Wallace), comes along to help but brings trouble. Will Nim get to keep and stay living at her personal resort or will she have to pack up and leave?

Return To Nim's Island, a Hallmark Channel Original Movie, premieres on the Hallmark Channel on Friday, March 15, 2013. Following up on the success of Nim's Island, this sequel is a great platform for Bindi Irwin, through her portrayal of Nim, to introduce young people to the importance of protecting our earth and its fragile species.

According to Brianna H. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Nim teaches us ""that you should do everything you can to help the marine and wildlife."" New KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Cassandra H., ""Return to Nim's Island will take families on a spectacular expedition underwater, into dark mysterious caves, and up awfully steep cliffs."" And new KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Jailene A. agrees with the others that the main message in the film is ""don't give up!""

Here's Brianna's review:

I really love this film. It's the sequel to Nim's Island. I love the underwater shoots and the humor. The cast does an incredible job in interacting with the animals and making it all believable. My favorite character is Nim because she is not afraid to speak her mind, and will not let anyone push her around. My favorite scene is when Nim is going on the zip line. It looks really cool to ride and I would love to do it. I love the music as it fits in perfectly with the scenes.

Brendan Maher directs Nim's Island. Author of the Nim's Island series, Wendy Orr, is the inspiration behind this film. Everyone does an amazing job - from the animals to all the cast - it makes an impact with an environmental message. The big message is that you should do everything you can to help the marine and wildlife, if you cannot, please do not harm it. Additionally, it emphasizes the idea to ""never give up on what you want to do.""

I recommend, Return to Nim's Island for ages 7 to 14. Parents will enjoy it as much as their kids. If you love the wild you will love this film.

I give this film an overwhelming 5 out of 5 stars. I love the adventure, cinematography, action and, of course, the humor.

5569295,5,B00BB8LTDM,I really loved this movie just saw it on the Hallmark Channel! It is sweet and adventurous. Bindi was amazing in this movie and so were the other actors. I liked how the dad was overprotective of his daughter with the 14 year old cute boy around. It would have been sweet to see their sweet puppy love blossom. But they made it at the end like it's leading towards a third movie. Like when she sent the boy a message that said that she might come and invade his home island right before the credits.,1363305600,14,499,4.208333333333333

Most likely I will not purchase . I liked the first one a lot... The orginial actors should have done the second one.. Don't know the
actors in the second movie(Return to Nim's Island)! The story just isn't that good & it looks stupid...I am dissappointed w/Return to

5569384,5,B00BB8LTDM,At first I was disappointed that it didn't have any of the same characters.  But the kids loved this fun adventure.  Good story line.  No I don't think it was quite as good as the first but it was still a great movie.  I didn't realize it was Bindi Irwin until half way through the movie!,1382572800,7,288,4.089285714285714

5569388,3,B00BB8LTDM,"Obviously, with a straight to video release and without its A-list original cast, I didn't have my hopes up for this one. But it turned out to be very entertaining, and my son loves it. It has lots of beautiful shots, some funny animal humor, and an environmentally responsible message, so overall it's a good movie for kids.",1377388800,,325,4.620689655172414

5569395,5,B00BB8LTDM,"Mindy Erwin does it all.  This is one of her first full length movies.  It may be her first.  Suitable for the whole family.  It has just enough plot to make it interesting, action, clever animals and cartoon bad guys.  A great flick",1373155200,,233,4.325581395348837
5569396,5,B00BB8LTDM,"It's hard to find movie's appropriate for young ladies.  This movie was a great followup to the original with few changes to make it work.  I was really impressed that the ""save the planet"" was done with class and the the two 14 year olds behaved how 14 should - like friends.  A descent movie!  Well done.
