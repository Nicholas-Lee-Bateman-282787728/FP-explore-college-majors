8355670,5,B00284EM7S,"It is always a pleasure to watch  these old movies ,it is of the era when good movies were made,not like the movies that they are producing now. These movies bring back many memories of a bygone era.",1304380800,,199,4.2368421052631575
8355671,1,B00284EM7S,I think someone at Amazon need to find whoever suggested they list these atrocious prints of these movies with a new cover. In Australia these exact selections have been selling in b grade supermarkets and $2.00 shops for years. I bought one once for $2 and threw it out (kept the case of course). they are unwatchable and Amazon need to take them off the market. They are el cheapo prints of out of copyright movies. Shame Amazon Shame. PS why does one have to give at least a star to something before it will publish???,1301270400,11,521,4.4375
