7953518,3,B00005T7C1,"I was diagnosed with bowel cancer last year. I've been told I have no more than 6 months to live. I plan on proving them wrong.

I read Bernie Siegel's book ""Love, Medicine and Miracles"" last month and it excited me and gave me the hope that I can beat this cancer. So, I wanted to know more, more, more and I ordered this video.

What I received was obviously a copy as it had a photocopied cover on it. Nevermind, that didn't bother me too much. It's the message that counts, right? Packaging, Shmackaging!

I started watching it and found it very good. Very encouraging. And then the tape ran out before it was over. I'm guessing I'm missing about 20 minutes of it.

I paid nearly $40 for it plus paid the shipping to get it sent clear over to Ireland. It's not worth paying the cost to have it sent back, and to tell you the truth, I've got more important things to do.

If I'd been sent the product I ordered I'd be delighted. Instead I got a second rate bootleg.",1178841600,,968,4.210810810810811

There are DEFINITE techniques that survivors of cancer utilize in recovering from their particular type of cancer--GET THIS TAPE and LEARN THEM!!!! Even advanced cancers respond to these techniques. The tape included an advanced lung, blood, brain, & ovarian cancer person who are ALL in remission after being given months to live!! (My oncologist said I'd have ""enough time to get my affairs in order,"" which was like waving a red flag in front of a bull). I have been digging furiously for information since my tumor returned with a vengeance. I was much too complacent during and after my first round of treatment. So don't make this mistake yourself.
There are TWO ""must"" items you should get for yourself or a loved one with cancer: This tape and the book Beating Cancer With Nutrition - Revised. Go read about them--both are rated 5 stars. Order them today and get busy taking an active role in your Cancer experience!! I am determined to prove to my oncologist that there are definite additional things one with cancer can do to augment treatment and assure STAYING ALIVE WITH QUALITY OF LIFE!!",1040342400,25,1105,4.821052631578947
