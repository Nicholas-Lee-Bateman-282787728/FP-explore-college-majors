5115105,2,B007ZKDL1I,Way too easy and too repetitive.  I thought it might be in line with Chalean Johnson or Les Mills but was disappointed.  Would be okay for someone who has never done kickboxing before,1383782400,,183,4.515151515151516
5115106,5,B007ZKDL1I,"Excellent exercise, great cardio, easy to follow, but reasonably one must achieve the stamina to do the whole program, l love it and would suggest it to anyone.",1383696000,,160,4.75
5115107,5,B007ZKDL1I,"This is one of my new favorites for aerobics, though I prefer TaeBo for toning/strengthening. The moves are easy to follow and I am able to keep up with the speed of the workout (slower than the double-time moves in TaeBo). The workout is 60 minutes long, but not that difficult.",1371254400,5,279,4.490196078431373
5115108,5,B007ZKDL1I,I really enjoy this workout DVD. I wouldnt recommend it if you are a beginer but man it will make you sweat!,1369094400,,108,3.9545454545454546
5115109,5,B007ZKDL1I,"This was purchased as a gift, and my daughter loves this workout, as it offers variety, challenge, and different lengths!",1361145600,5,121,5.1
5115110,5,B007ZKDL1I,"This is my fourth purchase of one of Sensei Guillermo Gomez's workouts.  Hubby has even tried them and we agree, if you are looking for excellent cueing, good form, interesting combinations and a good all over workout he makes it fun and very accessible, with vigorous routines that are heart pumping but simple to follow.

I would consider this routine to be intermediate and for someone looking for an all cardio workout, that does not have any knee issues and that is comfortable with high impact (a lot of jumping).  You move from start to finish.  Even the warm up is at an accelerated pace and you are torching major calories doing it. This a good combination of boxing moves, jabs, crosses, uppercuts, hooks, round house kicks and the like.  There is a 6 minute warm up and a 4 minute cooldown, which does some nice deep breathing exercises.  The cardio portion is 52 minutes long, but it goes by quickly.  The combos are repeated enough that you learn them quickly but not so much that you are bored, because soon you learn another set of moves and then later you will put them all together.

I find his kickboxing dvds are my new favorites for this type of exercise.  His style is energetic, without being ""over the top"" and the form and cueing is always top-notch.  I'm definitely a fan after purchasing the first one.  For a quick clip of the workout you can go to collagevideo.com, I usually do that to see if they look like something that will be my style of workout (intensity, set, music, instructor, it generally saves you from purchasing something you later won't enjoy).

Overall, extremely pleased with this one. No drawbacks for me, this one is a keeper!",1339804800,22,1674,4.618243243243243
5115111,3,B007ZKDL1I,"I liked this workout.  It's a decent cardio workout.  I prefer a workout that incorporates some weights and squats, etc. but this was fun and I did work up a decent sweat.",1462406400,,171,4.3125
5115112,5,B007ZKDL1I,"I use it all the time! Guillermo Gomez not only gives great cues, but he makes the workout flow in way that can be as challenging as you need.",1459209600,,142,3.9310344827586206

5115115,5,B007ZKDL1I,Great workout!,1442102400,,14,6.5
5115116,5,B007ZKDL1I,Great workout. Easy to follow. I have several of his DVD's and this one is the most rewarding ones yet.,1439510400,,103,4.2
5115117,5,B007ZKDL1I,"I bought this video on a high: the day after the Rousey v. Correia fight. I had never tried kickboxing in any capacity, so I was both excited and prepared to make a fool of myself. As expected, I stepped on my feet a couple times, knocked knuckles more than a few, and stood there looking dumb while trying to catch up and find his rhythm again. However, I also worked up a mean sweat and burned 400+ calories (per FitBit) within the hour; and, I woke up sore EVERYWHERE the next day. I've done it four times this week so far, and it's gotten a little easier every time. I went from simply trying to move in the same direction, to hearing what he's actually saying and paying attention to my stance and form.

If you're a complete newbie coming off an MMA fight high, like me, you'll laugh, cry, hurt, and congratulate yourself when you've made it through the first workout. (I didn't really cry, my muscles did, though.) I like how he provides direction a step ahead of when you actually perform the move; it makes transitions easy. If you're a bit more seasoned, I would suggest renting it first to see if it's really your speed. It's possible this video is too slow for your taste. All in all, I plan to download his other two videos to mix things up.",1438992000,,1254,4.336170212765958
5115118,5,B007ZKDL1I,LOVE HIM! He is so motivating and he really gets you going,1438905600,,58,3.9166666666666665
5115119,5,B007ZKDL1I,"I felt this was gonna be good the moment you press start- he's already moving and the music is calling you in to move, too.  Guillermo is great- unintimidating, great with pace of moves and cues and has a fun, encouraging attitude. I love the series of moves- easy to master, flows together well and once you've got them down, can really get you sweating.  I actually have only gotten thru about 3/4 of the workout (then switch to a pilates video) and enjoy it tremendously. The 2 women in the background are quiet and unintrusive and the same w/ the actual place it's recorded (doesn't look exactly like some city gym) . I think the music's great. This really is one of the few workouts I could say is great for a beginner (go as far as you can) or more- .  Definitely a great addition to a collection!",1438473600,,803,4.34
5115120,4,B007ZKDL1I,Kickboxing video that will kick the calories quickly.,1434585600,,53,5.75
5115121,5,B007ZKDL1I,"So awesome. Guillermo is such a hunk & that inspires me to work out more often -lol:)) In addition, the instructions are clear and keeping up or moving to the next level is worth it.",1428883200,,182,4.228571428571429
5115122,5,B007ZKDL1I,"I LOVE this guy. He's fun, energetic, and who doesn't want to look at a hot guy while they're working out. It starts out not too fast so you can learn the moves and then half way through he kicks into high gear. It takes a few tries to get the moves down but it's well worth it. Plus I really loved that I didn't have to buy a dvd. It's available on Amazon Instant video. This work out burns around 1000 calories.
So, to recap, fun work out, hot guy, Amazon Instant Video, 1000 calories burned. Totally worth it! Thanks Guillermo. UROCK!!!!!",1426550400,,541,4.262135922330097

5115126,5,B007ZKDL1I,"I love Guillermo Gomez Kickboxing routines.  I have several, and none of them disappoint.  I feel like I can get through them and get a great workout while still feeling like I am having great fun.  There is a good balance of upper body and lower body components.  The workout is about 1 hr, so sometimes I do half and sometimes I do the full session.  Never disappoints.",1419552000,,371,4.397058823529412

5115130,5,B007ZKDL1I,"If you want an intermediate level workout that lasts longer than the current wimpy 20 or 30-minute ones...this is for you!  If you want to be shown Perfect Form in kickboxing, this is certainly for you, as Guillermo Gomez is a Sensei, a martial arts Master.  If you like lots of variety, you've come to the right place.  There are sequential segments that are chained together throughout the workout, but these are broken up about every 20 minutes by total changes in form.  But all the work is done to the upper and lower body, and bilaterally.  It's nonstop for 51 minutes, then it seems that he is starting to slow down, then, SPOILER ALERT!  he takes you back through the whole chain of segments taught one more time!  So the active part is actually 55 minutes long.  You will feel well worked out at the completion of this dvd.",1404000000,9,832,4.5
5115131,4,B007ZKDL1I,"I stumbled across Guillermo Gomez through the On-Demand Sportskool channel over a year ago.  This is one of the workouts recently available, and I became hooked!  I was sad when it expired, but very happy to find this video on Amazon!

I love anything that incorporates boxing!  I would say that this workout is more boxing than kicking.  While there is kicking - and squats, you are doing more boxing combos, and shuffles.  This is a full-body workout that will make you sweat like crazy.  You will know you are burning major calories- and fat!  I especially love what it has done for my arms, shoulders and back.  Ladies, if you want to look good in those halters and tank tops, I guarantee this workout will give you the results you want!

To keep from getting bored, I incorporate this workout with other workouts: at the gym, bicycling, Jessica Smith Cardio Abs (a great HIIT workout, who happens to be the girl on the left in this video- available on Amazon).  By the way, it helps that Guillermo is hot - great motivation that works for me!",1403654400,,1047,4.545454545454546

5115135,5,B007ZKDL1I,This is a great workout to keep fit and flexible with out a gym or workout equipment.  My legs have always been toned but now my arms have become very toned as well.

5115137,4,B007ZKDL1I,"This is a fast workout.  The instructor jumps right into it and never lets up.  It's a solid 60 minutes.  Good cool down, thought the warm up was a little too short.  While I agree with the first reviewer that there are a lot of the same reps, reps bring results and I can really feel this workout in my muscles.  The movements are easy to learn which is good because they are so fast.  I modified a couple of steps to lower the impact a little. although this is really not a high impact workout.  Not for beginners but good for intermediate.  I will probably rent again, probably won't buy, I'd like to have it on hand every 2 or 3 months.  Didn't find it boring, just not something I'll want to do every week.",1392854400,,711,4.169117647058823

8523411,5,B007ZKDL1I,"The instructor is great, easy to follow. Easy to change it up with your own moves and get right back with it. Simple production without a lot of unnecessary breaks. The workout is nonstop, rather than high/low intensity. If you are new to cardio kickboxing, you will get better, kick higher and become more agile so the workout does evolve if you keep at it.

I first took Guillermo Gomez workouts when they were available on demand, I lost 20+ lbs from doing these workouts daily. I recommend finding something you like and sticking with it. Don't listen to the beach body hype. You don't have to do high intensity, jump and lunges or dance. You just have to find something you can follow along for 30-60 mins... it may be good instructor, music, workout style, clothing, or even a cute background model. Just keep up the work outs! It's worth it!!

8523412,1,B007ZKDL1I,Unless you are VERY familiar with these moves and are in great shape already be wary of this video. It's very fast paced from the first second. Injuries could occur.,1493683200,,165,4.533333333333333

8523416,5,B007ZKDL1I,"I rented this recently as I was on vacation and downloaded it onto my Kindle to work out in my hotel room.  Per his usual, Guillermo gives great instruction and cueing throughout, so a preview of the workout isn't needed.  I w.as pleasantly surprised that I was not bored, even though he does do quite a few reps for each segment.  This might be due to the decent music (which is rare in most workout dvds!) and Guillermo himself is very likeable. I would give this a beginner though intermediate workout rating; I would consider myself fairly advanced (I do HIIT workouts, Insanity, Amy Dixon) 6 days a week) and this made me sweat.  I will be buying this to put into the rotation!",1482969600,,682,4.475806451612903
