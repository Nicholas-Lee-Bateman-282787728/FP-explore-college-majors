7860207,4,6304042027,"An upper class woman with no real life skills ends up broke and in the company of a young thief and an alcoholic journalist.  Plots centre around trying to find her husbands money, schemes to get money out of old friends, and ways to maintain an upper class lifestyle.  These goals often end up coinciding with a mystery or event that needs solving or working out (generally these three end up causing more strife rather than accomplishing anything). This show has a great sense of the ridiculous, and each episode is self-contained and full of laughs.",1458604800,,552,4.739583333333333
7860208,5,6304042027,"I loved this TV show when it was broadcast on PBS. I bought the boxed set, and I watch it all the time. I'm a fan of Joanna Lumley, and this series fits her well. I am only sorry the series ended so quickly. Really enoyable, but you also have to like British TV.",1356739200,,262,3.8703703703703702
7860209,5,6304042027,"A fun, light, and witty romp with some very well played characters. Joanna Lumly (The New Avengers, Absolutely Fabulous) and John Bowe (Capital City) are particularly entertaining. The three principals comprise an unlikely group of friends/accomplices joined together by circumstances and mutual need to restore Kate Swift(Lumly) from penniless ex-con to (at least the illusion of) her previous upper crust circumstances, Jack Booker (Bowe)to the the ranks of (semi-)sober and employed journalism, and Gloria (Nadine Gardner) to a life of something other than petty theft. Their antic misadventures whilst coming to terms with their own demons and their growing friendship/sense of family are delightful, if a bit over the top, all done in good fun by consummate professionals. I would definitely recommend this to British comedy fans!",1313366400,,835,5.582677165354331

7860211,5,6304042027,"This aired over the summer when I was like 13 and I loved it!
I laughed til it hurt! The only thing is that my ""wonderful"" country dident bother to air both series, just the first and I ve been searching ages for both (I have the first on a bad copy VHS) I was so happy seeing that Amazon.com sells it!

Anyway, the best thing about this is Joanna Lumley. Shes hilarious! Diffrent hilarious then in Ab-Fab but hilarious. I also love John Bowe and the duck LOL. In all well worth buying and watching again.",1233792000,3,505,4.206185567010309
7860212,5,6304042027,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable, not to mention very, very funny British comedy. Two series were made (fourteen 50-minute episodes in all), and they're both here.  The episode length may preclude this from being a Britcom, but it is sure to be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys shows typical of that genre.

Joanna Lumley (Absolutely Fabulous) stars as self-centred, avaricious Kate Swift, a feisty, vain and very unsympathetic aristocrat, who has found herself cash-strapped since being shafted by her husband, Donald (who had his fingers in a number of less-than-legal pies!). You see, Donald has disappeared, apparently leaving Kate to weather the repercusions of his illegal ventures but without, alas, the consolation of the corresponding cash.

Kate forms two unlikely alliances. Firstly, there's Jack Booker, an out-of-work, asthmatic journalist with a serious alcohol addiction. Jack is an absolutely hilarious character, a nervous coward whose claim to fame (if one can call it that) is that he revealed his sources. Secondly, there is Gloria, a gutsy, street-wise young Australian burglar who is more than capable of taking care of herself--in short, she's everything Jack isn't!

Kate teams up with these two misfits and together they try to find out what happened to her beloved Donald and, more importantly, to his beloved cash. The earlier episodes often involve Kate crossing paths (though swords may be a more apt term!) with Donald's assorted underworld associates. In some cases, they'd like slice of Donald's now-nonexistent monetary pie; in others, it's Kate who wants her (ie. Donald's) share of what she feels is owed. The latter episodes often see Kate coming to the assistance of some friend or relative--even her old nanny.  Regardless of the situation, money is at the heart of the episodes, and Kate will do whatever it takes to get her hands on some much-needed cash.

In conclusion, this is a witty--at times hilarious--series which I thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend to all fans of British comedy.",1103068800,14,2028,5.224615384615385
7860213,4,6304042027,"Class Act is a great show-combining comedy with a detective story.  Joanna Lumley is easily the star of the show portraying the aristicratic and snobbish Kate Swift who goes to prison largely thanks to the cowardly John Bowe-who unlike real life reporters-decides it's better to reveal his sources!  In prison she meets Nadine Gardner-an Australian burglar-who becomes her unpaid live in assistant upon their release from jail-when they meet up with Bowe who has been fired for previously revealing his sources.  Kate's husband-who were never given a lot of information about--but apparently is a bit of a high rolling crime figure-disappears in episode one--which in turn leaves Kate penniless upon her return from her stint in jail.
Though the stories that follow are not very realistic--quite tongue in cheek for the most part--the comedy is great and the adventures of the unlikely trio are quite entertaining.  Lumley is quite lovely as Kate--perhaps her most glamourous role outside of Purdy on the New Avengers.  Bowe is also quite good as the cowardly journalist Jack and Garner's role is also quite endearing.
I wish there was a rating between 4 and 5 for this show--I do recommend it strongly--though a few of the episodes seem to contain a litle filler and we never truly find out what became of Kate's husband--though it is implied that he may have been killed.
Altogether-there are 14 episodes in this series--each about 50 minutes long.  Well worth watching and owning!",1086307200,24,1483,5.057377049180328

There are eight 50-minute episodes in the video boxed set (though the DVD version is nearly twice as long--11 hours as opposed to 6 1/2).  Don't worry that you'll be left in mid-air, however, for each episode is an independent little story.  (Still, I dearly hope BFS will release the other series of episodes for those of us who don't have DVD players!)  This is a witty--at times hilarious--series which I thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend to all fans of British comedy.",1055894400,4,2151,5.117142857142857

This is a really classy series, they should have made more. The casting is perfect and John Bowe has some excellent moments. This is an enjoyable watch for anyone of any age. It's not rude or violent just funny.",974592000,7,333,4.21875
