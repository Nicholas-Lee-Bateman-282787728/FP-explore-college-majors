This copy was coded for European DVD players and I had some difficulty getting it to run, but the effort was worth it for the original movie.  Very funny.  I wasn't so fond of the second DVD, but I'm glad to have it and the price was great!  I'd be happy to purchase from this source again.",1414800000,,326,4.046875
