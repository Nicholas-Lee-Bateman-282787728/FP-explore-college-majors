8578937,5,B000VJNQYC,"The movie is a landmark of comedy of the Egyptian movie industry (100 years old) that came out during its golden era. In addition to Omar Sherif (in one of his rare comedy roles before he got his international fame), the movie includes some of the best Egyptian actors and actresses like Souad Hosny (Cindrella of the Arab Cimena),Yousef Wahby (a landmark in Arabic Theatre and Cinema history), Hend Roustom (Marlene Monro of the Egyptian Cimena), Abd Almouna'm Ibrahim (one of the best comedian actors)and Egypt's soccer goalkeeper Adel Heikal (in a rare movie appearance). The movie story decribed in Amazon Editorial Review does not belong to this movie. Amazon should correct that. The movie story (from the DVD back-cover) is,"" A wonderful romantic comedy about an uncle who is trying to marry his shy serious nephiew to his young outgoing daughter while his wife is trying to marry her daughter to her own hip nephiew"". The movie story is really fun to follow. Hilarious comedy situations are all over the movie. An excellent family fun time is surely guaranteed. The movie is in Arabic language (the Egyptian slang) with English and French subtitles. The quality of the movie is excellent for a movie done in the 60's (black and white era). The movie was digitally remastered during the process of transfer. Sound is clear and perfect. I watched this movie so many times when I was young. The movie is still broadcasted from time to time on Arab local and satellite TV channels. I wanted to own the movie in a DVD format as I like to watch it now and then. You can't go wrong with a movie lived for more than 50 years of success.",1280534400,2,1636,4.684027777777778
