6481538,4,B00LEW3IZW,"for an under budget film, Dragonfyre is fast paced with and interesting twist. Combining modern tactical warfare with fantasy this movie pulls together a unique blend of styles. Little background story was presented to explain why the princess was being hunted, but overall the story was decent and entertaining if you can look past the details. For what the budget was, I think the acting, graphics, and plot where worth the time spent watching.",1417046400,,446,5.04054054054054
6481539,5,B00LEW3IZW,A lot of bang for only a few bucks.  This is a well crafted fantasy with interesting people and some good SPFX. Very Tolkien-ish.,1416182400,,129,4.375
6481540,4,B00LEW3IZW,"A Phase4Films production. What I like about Phase4 productions is that they are not great nor are they terrible, they do find that happy medium and are okay with that. Rusty Joiner (marvel of a man) is the new sentinel who is to stand guard over a portal linking the 9 realms. Basically there it is, there are orcs and elf princesses. Rip-off, sure. But fun nonetheless. The effects are okay, the acting is okay, the story is okay. it's okay. Guns in out realm make him a wizard because no other realm has them. Like I said fun.",1415491200,5,528,4.343434343434343

6481543,5,B00LEW3IZW,"Dragonfyre is a low budget fun film that delivers an entertaining time.  It has a somewhat unique plot where there are gateways between worlds.  The one on the modern Earth (yes where high tech stuff exists: guns, ect....) is guarded by a sentinel.  The gateways open when there is an astronomical alignment so things can pass between the worlds.  The gateway on Earth is set in a small cave in Utah on a private ranch.

When the gate opens, a elf princess who is pursued by orcs runs through the gateway and is protected by the old sentient who dies.  Then a new sentinel is drawn to protect the gateway.

Overall the film is pretty fun.  If you want to see what happens when orcs face a soldier with modern weapons, this is a film for you.  There also is a dragon that gets involved.

The acting is actually pretty good.  Clare Niederpruem has a small role as a real estate agent which is done well.  The other actors all do their best to get into the parts and taht is effective.

Action sequences and pace are good.  There are a few goof ups on some of the weapons systems (lens cap left on a sniper rifle, ect...) but if you look past that the film is entertaining in a ""I love corny action movies"" kind of a way.

Special effects are average.  The dragon is a bit above average, the orc black blood splatters are a bit below average.

Filming is really pretty good with only a few of the jerky hand held effects.

Costumes are adequate.  Some of the orcs are done really well, and sort of scary, others just have helmets on, but the hordes overall are decent.

Plot is fast paced and consistent and fun.

For a low budget film, this is a solid B+ movie.",1411171200,25,1659,4.287096774193548
6481544,2,B00LEW3IZW,"John Norton (Rusty Joiner) is not named John Carter because that would be too obvious. He buys an isolated farm and is an ex-soldier. The farm is located near a cave that is a portal to ""The Nine Worlds."" He has reluctantly obtained the position of ""The Sentinel"" a guardian of the portal between worlds. He is aided by a blind Native American.

He is also tasked in saving the Elf Princess (Masiela Lusha) from an acting career and the hordes of Orcs who desire to capture her for sacrifice, a sacrifice that would open the portals and allow the Orcs to conquer other worlds with their bows and swords. Seriously. Oh yes they also have one Nazgul.

The Orcs looked and grunted convincingly. The fire was all CG, apparently fire insurance is hard to come by. The storyline, as you can tell, wasn't great and at one point I had wished they had copied ""John Carter"" more, however the lack of a budget prevent exotic scenery . The production starts out as if it was going to be a decent film. But then suddenly everything takes place down on the farm. The idea of getting real help to combat an army of Orcs seems alien to John Norton, who would rather fight them alone save for the occasional person who drops by.

This film is in no way connected to LOTR except for the fact it borrows species from it.

A desperation rental.

6481547,1,B00LEW3IZW,"I am generally very objective in my reviews and give equal weight to many perspectives.
Giving this film one star is generous.
I find redeeming and interesting qualities in most films that get poor reviews -- this film simply has none. Not one. Not the actors, not the plot, not the concept, not the photography, not the effects, not the music, not the dialogue, not the props, not the makeup, not the costumes, and especially not the dragon.

It's bad, and no number of positive reviews can change that fact.  It's poorly directed, e.g. it's dark on the other side of the portal, but when the hero approaches it shows bright daylight.  The head bad orc is spared for some unknown reason - by theory is it's for his poor impersonation of the Iraqi Information Minister.  The acting isn't horrible per se, but with this writing and directing it doesn't really matter.

If you take a good long look at it while it's paused you can see that it is none other than Sting, the sword that Bilbo gained the Hobbit and then gave to Frodo in the LOTR.

For unknowns with likely little experience they played their parts well.  The only exceptions are the ""rednecks"".  The ""redneck"" characters lack any acting skill.  I have seen high school plays where the acting was better.  Since the majority of the ""rednecks"" die in roughly 10 minutes they are easy to overlook.

Another thing that I wondered about were the Orcs biodegradable as they disappeared quite fast after being shot.  I guess a short explanation is in order.  There are these gateways between worlds, and these gateways are guarded by Sentinels.  When one sentinel dies another is drawn to take his place.  The gateways are only open for limited time.

6481756,4,B00LEW3IZW,"This is a Syfy wannabe that manages to uphold their low standards in like fashion.  The budget was either sparse to begin with or someone mismanaged their finances.  It looked cheap-cheap-cheap.  The orc makeup/masks was marginal (they'd work for Halloween but not in a movie).  The black blood spatter looked like puffs of smoke from a car.  They could only manage to cough up one witch and one elf.  The dragon appeared very-very late in the story.  I forgot there was even supposed to be a dragon featured in this movie (the main reason I bought it).  The cover art on the DVD is very misleading in this regard.  The story mainly takes place in this world with rare glimpses of only one of the nine realms they keep harping on.  The action is what you'd expect, lots of gunplay and a catapult.  The hero (Rusty Joiner as John Norton) is reluctant and low-key.  The damsel/princess in distress (Masiela Lusha) spends half her time striking fierce poses, the rest of the time she squeaks, reverting to being helpless.  How can you eviscerate someone in one scene then turn all girly and powerless in another scene?  Her behavior was erratic at best.  There are also odd bits of comic relief peppered throughout.  The wicked witch was a bag lady in that she kept her head covered in a bag of sorts while she floated around giving orders.  It's a strange movie that I begrudgingly found entertaining enough.  But it isn't very well made.  It's not destined to be a cult classic.  But.  If you enjoy schlock, you might like this.",1441929600,,1527,4.602230483271375

The waves of orcish hordes are probably played by the same dozen people, and the blood spatter effects were only slightly better than Sparticus or Django Unchained.  And the best acting was probably by the orcs.  Wait'll you see the acting range of the elven princess!!!

I liked the first half.  There were some pretty funny lines like when the princess ran into some hillfolk and one of them said, 'sure I'll help ya princess. And in a non-pervy way'.  It was a little like Army of Darkness and it was fun, despite the bad acting and low budget.  And when the dragon was gonna be part of the story, I was thinking they saved the majority of their budget for the finale...

6481759,3,B00LEW3IZW,"Though the special effects and make-up/costumes were not the best, this movie was quite good. It had a little bit of everything. It had the handsome warrior hero, the beautiful damsel princess in distress, battles everywhere and even a menacing dragon, who did not get enough screen time. If they really wanted us to fear the dragon, then it should have burned a village or something early in the movie, killing children, to make us fear and hate it. It had everything except a tinge of romance. There was none. The princess' peck on the cheek at the end was not enough. They should have gotten closer earlier and in the end when he headed back to our world, the cave should have closed, the princess turn to walk away and then he comes out of the cave embracing and kissing her, maybe spouting some cute quip.

This may be Rusty Joiner's footstep in the door to bigger and better things. I believe he will one day look on this movie and snicker, probably the way Michelle Phiefer does at Grease 2, but he was great as the hero with demons. The cast was good. No, this is not Star Wars, but I hope, but doubt it will get a sequel. For the movie watcher like me, who loves fantasy, action, special effects, I was more than satisfied.

6481778,2,B00LEW3IZW,"Let me be clear. This is a terrible movie. Plot, cinematography, acting - you name it and it's not done very well.

That being said. I gave it 2 stars because it is a great movie to fall asleep watching and the makeup artist obviously spent a lot of time on the movie. It doesn't matter where you pick up in the movie because it's going to be a ridiculous plot point either way. Orcs getting blown apart from a shotgun? No explanation necessary just keep on going. Guy on ATV can't outrun a walking woman. No explanation necessary just keep on going. Crazy rednecks drive past band of orcs? No explanation necessary just keep on going.

I think the clincher for me was when a redneck gets stabbed through the rectum with a giant spear. That's a pretty defining moment in my book.

And hey, you are probably thinking at this point, ""What the hell? It can't really be that bad can it?"" And then you'll watch the first 5 minutes and you will realize, ""Hey, that random Amazon review I read got it right. The movie really is that bad.""",1420416000,,1031,4.359375

The only thing I will give it, is that a few of the songs from the soundtrack are shockingly good, and the composer of this film deserves to work on way better projects.

These stories are based of folklore that has developed and retold through human history  Little people, Dragons, Goblins and Orc like creatures are present in different culture's histories all over the world.  These are not new fantasies, in fact they are quite old.  Its not a rip-off.  It just continues in a long history of folktales.  If it is a rip off... you have to start with something like Beowulf instead of Lord of the Rings. If you study story telling you will learn that there are only 7 types of tales, while some scholars claim only 3. Fun movie, decent plot, and acting could be better.

This Movie is not a waste of time but its not really a great investment either. If you are bored I'd watch it, but if you have something better, i'd watch that.

This starts out pretty typical with a band of orcs chasing the princess and not even five minutes into this you have her run across a ""wizard"" who despite his name does not use magic. You can tell they used actual locations for all their shots - Despite the rough terrain they managed to keep the cameras somewhat steady. The movie does not have great flow, but it works for their budget. One part that bothered me was that the main character buys a house in the first part of the movie. It is hinted that this is his first visit but during the whole scene he clearly knows where everything is. It is just a little off putting.
