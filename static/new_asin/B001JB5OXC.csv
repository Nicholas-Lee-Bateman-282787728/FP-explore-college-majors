8312694,1,B001JB5OXC,"The movie is only like 45 minutes long. You would think for all the places they traveled they would have more footage. The footage looks amateurish. The tricks are not spectacular or exciting. You can find better quality and more entertaining vids on YouTube. The only cool thing they did in this vid was give free bikes to ppl in Africa who never rode one or seen one, and no they were not top of the line bikes. Don't waste your money unless you like blowing your money on crap.",1402704000,,480,4.344444444444444
