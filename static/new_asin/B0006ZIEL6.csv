8044044,2,B0006ZIEL6,This video did not meet my expeectations.  It was hard to follow the steps of each dance.  It is a poor teaching tool.  I will not purchase another video fron this supplier and would not recommend it to anyone.,1490486400,,210,4.333333333333333
8044045,4,B0006ZIEL6,"A very clear, easy way to learn some of the popular celebratory dances!  A mixed-age group (family or friends obviously enjoying themselves) demos each. Narration is given as the dance is shown in slow motion, then  it's done with the music.  This does seem like a homemade production, with not all the dances matching the listing on the cover or everything on the CD, but the band, singers, and dancers are great.  I like that it comes with the CD, convenient to use with kids in spare moments at school or with groups at library community programor in my own exercise sessions!",1439856000,,579,4.647058823529412

8044047,5,B0006ZIEL6,This video was incredible!  I played it for the family and we all learned the dance moves together.  Hours of fun!!,1315785600,,115,4.428571428571429
8044048,3,B0006ZIEL6,"The video was okay.  Not like I thought it would be though.  Alot of repetition for a long set of time.  Too long for me.  I would've like to have seen more variety.  But I still watch and if I can, fast forward to the next parts.  The dancing is wonderful but it's just the time they spend on one area.",1251417600,,303,3.8852459016393444
8044049,2,B0006ZIEL6,"This DVD and cd seem to be the edited 50 minute version of the original 90 minute ""Jewish Party Dances"" recorded nearly ten years ago. ( go read that review before you buy this) At least they cut out the mistakes. I am very disappointed with the quality of this DVD- unprofessional dancers who are still learning how to do the steps (the camera often remains on these people who are still uncertain of the steps).

Your local Jewish/Messianic congregation would have done just as well to record their practice sessions. In fact, if you are into that sort of thing, you can save your money and just learn from your locals. At least you'll be able to look at your instructor's feet without getting too dizzy. The only good thing is that it is a rare find - jewish dance steps on DVD. If you had a group of friends who would learn along with you...it might be worth it.",1164153600,4,866,4.37888198757764
