7809428,5,6301045661,"Narrated by Elizabeth Montgomery, this video documents key events in the growth of the National Security State. It discusses gun-running, drug trafficking, assassinations, and profiteering from covert operations. Some excerpts:

Ambassador Robert White (El Salvador 1976 - 1980):  ""What we saw in the Iran-Contra Hearings, was the exposure of the beginnings of a National Security State which believes it has the right to override the Constitution of the United States in the name of security.""

Rep. Jack Brooks (Democrat - Texas):  ""I think that there was a substantial shadow government trying to run foreign affairs for the United States.""

David MacMichael (former CIA Analyst):  ""These are modern day pirates these guys.  They have escaped, essentially, the control of national governments, but they are available for use by national governments.  Sometimes they move under color of -- and defend themselves as advancing U.S. national interest in this.  But I think that is very secondary with these guys.  They're out to make a buck.""

Professor Peter Dale Scott: ""I think that the real issue was that both the administration and the majority of the people in the committees were frightened that the real scandals, the drug scandals for example, would really threaten any future conduct of covert operations on the scale that they had been handled in the past. And so they were trying very deliberately to limit the damage.  This was damage control.""

John Stockwell (former CIA covert specialist): ""And so they were pulling the punches on all the major questions and issues of what really happened in this thing, what the CIA's role was.  Any time they got into anything that was really sensitive about exactly that, exactly what the CIA's role was and exactly what laws were broken and when, they went into secret session.""

Barbara Honegger also talks about the 1980 October Surprise.",1380326400,2,1894,5.163934426229508

7809430,3,6301045661,"The Iran-Contra scandal, as this video illustrates in the beginning, is probably one of the most ignored events of the 1980s.  The film takes an obvious 'conspiracy theory' approach, which, although sometimes entertaining, sometime relies too much on 'documents' and 'information' that aren't actually seen.  However, the video does create a very valid view on US policy in Latin America, and the possible role of the CIA in covert operations that may not be in America's best interest (at least in the wake of recent events).  There's a link, at least in the video's mind, between a 'shadow' government that might potentially suspend civil rights when dealing with criticism (something we have dealt with recently, in terms of war protestors), and what happened to Japanese-Americans during WWII.  Narrated by Elizabeth Montgomery, this video brings a definite POV of not only Iran-Contra, but of US foreign policy.  It is a video that will definitely spark conversation...which is good, even if you don't agree with all the conclusions presented.",1052870400,35,1048,5.251497005988024
7809431,5,6301045661,"If George W. Bush were to let presidential documents to be released, it would mean the certain end of the Republican Party in the United States.  And this video reveals why.  There were lots of under-handed deals going on even before Ronald Reagan entered the White House followed by many overt and covert operations instigated and approved by the United States government.  The release of information revealing what was really going on during the Reagan administration would cause irreparable damage to George W.'s current cohorts such as Elliot Abrams and John Poindexter, perhaps even to the administration itself.
The only criticism I have is that this video seemed to go on a lot of tangents which were not completely relevant to the Iran-Contra scandal per se, such as the graphic scenes of the bombing of La Penca or linking Oliver North to the training of the Contras.  However, this could be forgiven because information released by the various agencies was meager and they covered what was available.
The REX-84 plan has a remarkable resemblance to the current round-up of so-called unlawful combatants.  The video revealed that REX-84 was a plan to detain aliens from Latin American countries in camps in case of a serious federal emergency or break-down of the government.  The sole deviation from the plan seems to be that it is people of Middle Eastern descent rather than people from Latin America who are being detained.
I would recommend this video as a gift to anyone enamored with Ronald Reagan or the Reagan administration.  They may change their minds.",1048377600,57,1573,5.003831417624521
7809432,5,6301045661,"To understand what the Republican Party stands for, watch this terribly disturbing documentary. It is very pertinent today, in relation to the GW Bush/Enron scandal.",1007769600,33,165,5.64
7809433,5,6301045661,"I highly recommend this film - it should be shown in every political  science course - it really angers me that this sort of thing goes on at the  expense of the US taxpayers - our government tends to meddle in world  affairs, and the Mass Media only tells part of the story - and that part is  filtered and altered.  Watch the film to witness the huge crime the US  Government committed and got away with - it's a real eye-opener.",969235200,29,431,4.195121951219512
7809434,5,6301045661,This is a must see for any fence sitting Democrat or Independent Voter out in America.  If you play the last few minutes of the tape over and over it would be the best Democratic Campaign ad ever made.  The Laundry List will  blow you away.  I was sickened by the murder of the little children.  This  should outrage even the REpublicans.  I wished I could afford to send a  copy to all my friends_and one to AL GORE.,950400000,22,417,4.189873417721519
