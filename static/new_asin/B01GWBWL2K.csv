7768058,5,B01GWBWL2K,"This proves that America was TRULY ""built"" and NOT merely Discovered as the movie infroms us. Great for History buffs!!",1478822400,,119,5.0

7768060,5,B01GWBWL2K,"Just an amazing piece of documentary brought to you in the form of a film.  Not only does this documentary bring you a part of history, but also exceptional cinematography.  The settings and sceneries were breathtaking!  I couldn't stop watching and enjoying each and every character.  The actors completely submerge themselves in their characters and did an amazing job to depict every action.  This is a must have in any movie collection!!!",1373414400,,442,5.083333333333333
7768061,5,B01GWBWL2K,I really enjoyed the series from the actors to the production crew. Well done!,1534464000,,78,4.642857142857143

7768063,4,B01GWBWL2K,"I liked it, but the second episode is a 40 minute recap of the 120 minute first episode.  Skip that episode two entirely.",1533340800,2,121,4.260869565217392
7768064,5,B01GWBWL2K,Awesome narrative in summarizing the life and times of each prominent characters that greatly made an impact of Americas foundation as a nation. Greatly recommend.,1533081600,,163,5.56
7768065,5,B01GWBWL2K,"It's pronounced Car-NAY-gie. C'mon History Channel. Only one historian got it right.

Also, skip episode 2 since it's the same content as episode 1.",1532736000,2,148,5.166666666666667
7768066,5,B01GWBWL2K,"Excellent series. I love how they take a critical look at the Titans of Industry, but also recognize the innovation and drive required to build the legacy they did. The part at the end mentioning how Ford built cars out of Carnegie Steel in factories powered by Morgan's General Electric and running on Rockefeller's Standard Oil was particularly effective.",1532563200,,357,5.067796610169491
7768067,5,B01GWBWL2K,Truly inspirational. A well made series all around.,1532304000,,51,5.5
7768068,5,B01GWBWL2K,"Most people born in the USA have been exposed to people and events in this video during school. For those who were not over achievers in History, Journalism or Political Science, this is a must see. If you choose to do a binge watch, it does a bit too much reviewing between chapters. Some of us are impatient sponges and would appreciate this fantastic history lesson to come fast and furious. I noticed a couple people gave this video a poor rating.  I think they are upset with what happened rather than the quality of the video (don't shoot the messenger). How are you going to make an omelet without breaking a few eggs? I think the video does a great job portraying the events that shaped this country between 1865 and 1905.",1531612800,,730,4.488721804511278
7768069,5,B01GWBWL2K,"Great chronological order of American industry and ingenuity right after the Civil War to the Start of WW1.  People who complained that Trump had a cameo, so did Steve Winn, And Mark Cuban, all to discuss the mindset of people like these men.  Great series!",1531526400,,257,4.688888888888889
7768070,5,B01GWBWL2K,Excellent!,1531440000,,10,10.0
7768071,1,B01GWBWL2K,"Nonsensical puffery, glorifies robber barons.  Trump cameos, as if this rubs off on him.",1531008000,,88,5.285714285714286

7768074,5,B01GWBWL2K,It is actually a Christmas gift. I have seen it on the History Channel several times. It is fascinating every time. The person I purchased it for is from Scotland and he will find it fascinating too!,1509235200,,199,4.405405405405405
7768075,5,B01GWBWL2K,"Every one should get this DVD  so interesting. Loved it. Being British I now understand  the USA ,Well of Couse I am now a Citizen of the USA .",1506384000,,143,3.896551724137931
7768076,5,B01GWBWL2K,"I've seen this on television and it was absolutely outstanding. Cannot recommend highly enough.

One question, however. Does anyone know what the difference is between this item and the 3-disc set (also by Lionsgate) that sells here for $8.34? Substantial difference. Is it identical? Or is the editing more refined (regarding substantial repetition after commercial breaks where viewer is brought 'up to date' etc.) Would really like to know.",1502064000,,443,5.420289855072464
7768077,5,B01GWBWL2K,I have not yet purchased this but have seen it on History Channel and went looking for it because it is a great illustration of how a few people control the destiny of the masses. There are a lot of great lessons in this that we can all learn from and apply moving forward. Very well done.,1495670400,,289,4.087719298245614
7768078,5,B01GWBWL2K,"My family loved this series! Very well presented and engaging. I even gave it as a gift. If you love American history, you will really enjoy this.",1490140800,,146,4.444444444444445
7768079,5,B01GWBWL2K,Really enjoyed it. This is when men were really men. They had no fear and stopped at nothing to attain the American dream.,1484179200,,122,4.3478260869565215
7768080,5,B01GWBWL2K,I love seeing this documentary.  It helps condense the industrial revolution to something visual.  I also use a portion of this for the American Labor Merit Badge for the BSA.  GREAT information and history to learn and re-learn,1482278400,,228,4.947368421052632
8763703,5,B01GWBWL2K,Excellent!  An exciting and engaging look at America's captain's of industry.  I particularly liked the commentary from today's entrepreneurs.,1538265600,,142,6.421052631578948
8763704,1,B01GWBWL2K,"Stories of greed, corrupting politics with money, Making workers kill themselves & taking them away from their family for bragging rights, These People do not need to be glorified they need punishment. These People already have plenty yet still are destroying peoples lives in the name of greed. Its disgusting and still happening today. Imagine if these people actually cared about humanity.....",1537920000,,396,5.403225806451613
8763705,1,B01GWBWL2K,"This is irritatingly repetitive.  There is only about half the content, other half is repeat.  This series could have been good, had they told all sides and not resorted to the historical myth of the grand America becoming ""great"".  Even Ken Burns did a better job of that (although not complete).  This is far from the complete story and glorifies these men with no regard to the social and environmental impacts of their industries.  You'd think these scions of industry hammered every spike, poured every girder, and worked every well.  No mention of the workers, slaves, former slaves, prisoners, immigrants (Euro and otherwise) who poured amazing amounts of sweat equity into building this nation.  Yes, these guys took the risks, invested the money, but in those days it was much easier than now to amass great wealth, as so many industries were new.  The only recent analogues are personal computers/phones and soon marijuana businesses (lot of people getting rich in the legal states).  None of the businessmen interviewed have much in common with the men this series is profiling, so not sure why they are here.  What did Trump ever contribute?  He is a two-bit developer who rode in on his daddy's money and connections, built a couple buildings/casinos and some housing which he was charged with discrimination in renting.  In fact, none of these talking head men were from poor, immigrant parents like the men profiled.  There are too many people with generational wealth or privilege now, for the poor or immigrants to compete with, although there are those that do, like Oprah Winfrey.  Odd that she is not included as a talking head...

The Indian Wars were not even mentioned, once.  Or how the railroad barons and cattle barons got all that land they sold to pioneers, and shoved Native Americans off.  Social Darwinism is the excuse used for ""conquering"" the Native Americans, but in reality, genocidal tactics were used, like killing ALL of the Plains Indians food source, since they wouldn't give up their sacred lands (gold lands!) and go quietly to the reservation.  And when they did, the old, women, and children were massacred, to make double sure they were beaten (the warriors were out hunting, so it was a chickensh*t attack).  They are treated like POWs to this day.

But let's glorify those who built America's polluting industries, who gave no thought to the environment or the workers' safety.  Who got staggeringly wealthy while paying their workers barely enough to live.  Who created depressions and recessions and Wall Street.  We could have been strong without all that laissez-faire business, which we have had to protect and regulate ever since to keep them from continuing to abuse us and the Earth for their profit.  We live in a time in which CEO salaries and wealth are resembling these men's.  Except the talking heads aren't iconoclasts, for the most part, not like the industrial heroes who marshaled the building of America's urban infrastructure.",1536883200,,2994,4.987903225806452
8763706,5,B01GWBWL2K,"Once I saw this on History channel I fell in love. Thankful it's part of Amazon Prime. I think I is one of the greatest shows History channel produces. Story is great,  acting is great and there is no cheesy drama. Quiet bit of repetivnes, but over all great overview of that time and connecting it to our days.

This is almost ""how to be a great entrepreneur.""",1536796800,,361,4.294117647058823
8763707,1,B01GWBWL2K,"They ruined this film with unnecessary violence and gore (vomit scene, gruesome murder scene even repeated !) in episodes 1,4,5.  Also ruined by too much repeating same film over and over , 5 minute introductions every episode and repeated film clips/summaries (so boooring ! )when it normally would have cut to a commercial.  They used ""filler"" of experts, Marc Cuban and Jack Welch were okay, but a Hollywood producer (?), and Donald Trump should've been clipped out all together.  Somewhat loose with facts, episode 3 said Henry Frick built the exclusive club on the lake in Johnstown, but every reference after said "" they"" built it referring to Carnegie also (?).  I don't appreciate trying to learn something if the facts are not correct.  Episode 2 is a repeat of the Rockefeller clips from episode one !  More filler.... It's like unnecessarily watering down good liquor, why ?
  The acting and filming were Grade A.  Instead of 8 episodes with too much filler, they should have made 4 or something for a top notch documentary.  Instead it's a bad tv land grade C series !  WHY ????  BECAUSE THEY WANT TO TURN OUT GARBAGE ? (It's as bad a choice as Henry Frick's methods in 3,4,5.). I never had History Channel, what garbage they make.  They make it ABSOLUTELY PAINFUL TO LEARN !!!  UGH !",1536624000,,1296,4.702222222222222
8763708,1,B01GWBWL2K,"This series seemed like it might've been interesting, given its decent scripting and production values. Unfortunately, during the introduction, Donald Trump's bloviating, bloated, lying-sack face popped up, and I immediately started vomiting blood.",1536451200,,248,6.545454545454546
8763709,5,B01GWBWL2K,"Very well done.  The interviews are as good as the story of these men.  After watching the documentary, I bought a book on the life of these tycoons, it was that interesting!",1535587200,,174,4.40625
8763710,5,B01GWBWL2K,Really good drama.,1535500800,,18,5.333333333333333
8763711,5,B01GWBWL2K,"This is a fantastic documentary. The amount of information given and its presentarion was truly astonishing. These men were portrayed in non-bias way, it describes how they really are but also shows their massive influence on society today. Will highly recommend to watch.",1535414400,,272,5.348837209302325
8763712,5,B01GWBWL2K,"I thoroughly enjoyed this mini-series. I knew about most of the main events presented here, but it was the details that really kept me watching.",1534809600,,144,4.8
