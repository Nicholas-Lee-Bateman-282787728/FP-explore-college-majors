8425414,2,B004DJ1JWW,"AFTER VIEWING SEVERAL DVDS OF WOMEN AND THUNDER, I WAS DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS DVD  THIS GROUP NEEDS A FEW MORE HOURS IN THEIR GARAGE BEFORE ISSING ANY MORE DVDS.",1369094400,,166,4.533333333333333
8425415,4,B004DJ1JWW,This was on PBS and I just had to have it. For fans of Celtic it is a must. Good versitile performers that love performing and it shows. Has been available a while but well worth watching over and over again. Hope they get to do more DVDs in the future.,1359417600,,253,3.980392156862745
8425416,5,B004DJ1JWW,every song was toe tapping and expertly played...the musicians are multi talented...I've seen them in person twice and want to see them again,1355529600,,141,5.173913043478261
8425417,1,B004DJ1JWW,This is the first item I have purchased from Amazon that I thought was a dud.  It comes in a very low third compared to Celtic Thunder and Celtic Woman.  After watching it once I have no wish to watch again and again like I do Celtic Woman.,1342310400,2,240,3.9791666666666665
