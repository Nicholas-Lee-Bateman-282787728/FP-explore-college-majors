2323370,5,B0009UZG3M,"Both of these Barry Levinson films were wonderful!  Diner is a classic and Liberty Heights should be.  If you like Homicide: Life on the Streets, get a more well rounded view of Baltimore.",1208044800,4,188,4.666666666666667
2323371,5,B0009UZG3M,Loved the storyline for both films. Acting and direction where great. A good portrait of how life was for youths living in Baltimore. Liked them so much that I ordered the other two films with a Baltimore background by same author/director.,1201392000,7,240,4.878048780487805

8067102,5,B0009UZG3M,"These are truly great movies from the Baltimore series by Barry Levinson.  There are two other movies in this series ""Avalon"" and ""Tin Men"".  ""Diner"" is the first movie in the series and has a lot of well know actors in their youth.  The movies are ""old fashioned"" and make you feel like you are Home.  If you like old movies, these are the ones to see.",1442793600,,353,4.223880597014926
8067103,5,B0009UZG3M,Fantastic double DVD from my old stomping grounds !!!!!!!! Barry Levinson is the BEST !,1436140800,,87,4.866666666666666

8067105,5,B0009UZG3M,"These two fictional tales drawn from Barry Levinson's childhood memories are a paen to the City of Baltimore. Focusing on ""Charm City"" in the 50's prove to make for his very best films.",1364169600,,185,4.636363636363637
8067106,5,B0009UZG3M,"Oh how I LOVE these two movies. Have watched each of them 4 times and will watch them again I am sure. The stories are so interesting to me, the time frame, the great acting by everyone, the comedy, the pathos....I LOVE these movies. I was out of the loop when they were made and am enjoying them for the first time.",1336348800,2,316,4.112903225806452
8067107,1,B0009UZG3M,"If you can remain awake through either of these two sleepers, you deserve a medal.  These are both painfully slow moving, unfunny, undramatic, and utterly boring movies.  Don't let the cheap price fool you, they are over priced at any price.

The only reason to buy these movies is if you can't get to sleep, watching either of these will have you snoring in no time at all.",1329523200,2,374,4.470588235294118
