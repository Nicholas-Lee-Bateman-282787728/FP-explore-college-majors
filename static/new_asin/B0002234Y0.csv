2055119,5,B0002234Y0,"FINALLY. After waiting for so long.. I am so excited to see that the 2nd DVD is finally coming out. It's a shame that the execs at Warner Brothers cancelled the show. Still - the fifth season did provide closure, and I guess it can't go on forever.
I purchases the first DVD, and I will the second, and any more to come. I hope there are lots of special features and editorials. I love for this series. Even though it has been over for a few years, there is no TV series or movie that has stirred by excitement as much as La Femme Nikita.
Please, everybody, purchase this DVD and show some support! We are already kicking Alias' (the wannabe show) butt .. just check out the Amazon.ca/Amazon.com sales rank. :) There is a lot to be proud of, LFN fans!
Long Live La Femme Nikita!",1086566400,,778,4.263513513513513
2055120,5,B0002234Y0,"Finally, the second season of the best stylistic show ever made can be viewed on DVD rather than recorded-from TV VHS tapes. The first season is great but it only formed the foundation of how far the political intrigue, kill-your-own attitude of Operations and Madeline would go.  This is one show that should have gone on for ten seasons.  The three part arc starts out the season with a hope that someone can actually get the best of Operations (Not!) and ends again with the hope that Adrian can pull off freeing Nikita from the chains of Section One - dashed again.  It is a creative nod to the producers that Adrian was able to come back in a later season.  The characters and relationships are better developed in the second season.  Operations and Madeline, Michael and Nikita, Nikita and Walter, Nikita and Birkoff, Walter and Birkoff, and Nikita and Madeline.  It is a shame that this show has not found a place in rerun heaven beyond the lightly-available Oxygen network.",1086393600,4,981,4.707602339181286
2055121,5,B0002234Y0,"Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I love this show.  It is the greatest and I am excited that Season two is on its way.  Hopefully, the release of the other seasons will be on their way real, real soon.  I own season one and I plan on owning all of them.  Great show!!  I let one of my friends watch it and she likes it.  So if you haven't checked it out, do so.  It is worth it.  Thanks again",1086393600,,393,3.753086419753086
2055122,5,B0002234Y0,"It is hard to explain in words how HAPPY I was when I saw I could pre-order Season 2! It seems like it took forever to come out, but hey, it's all good now because I will very soon be in possession of Season 2 of La Femme Nikita! Youpie!!! I am so anxious for the rest of the Seasons to come out (hopely it will take less time...) and willing to pay whatever the price, so keep them coming! PLEASE!
P.S. I guess I don't have to mention that I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY like this show right? :o)",1086048000,4,491,3.9696969696969697
2055123,5,B0002234Y0,"At last the long wait is over!!  So long now have I and other fans been waiting,waiting,and waiting for the antipated release of a second season of Nikita.  I'm sure fan clubs might have had a little to do with it.  If it hadn't been for the loyal fans doing write-ins the last season of Nikita would never have been produced.  For the life of me, I can't understand why a show like Alias,(in some ways a spin off of Nikita) got all the attention.  I hope this means that the other seasons now will finally follow the release of Season Two.  Just shows you what some campaigning can do can't it?",1085875200,,595,4.267857142857143

2055135,5,B0002234Y0,"La Femme Nikita: 2nd season
What's not to like about this series? Good-looking leads who play assassins (with back and forth sexual tension - they want to be together but can't), a great supporting cast, and decent plots for each episode. If action and assassins are your thing, I definitely recommend this series to you. And great music to boot.",1483315200,,346,4.783333333333333

The first episode is so emotional - finally seeing Michael's emotions - the love he has for Nikita come to light is so satisfying.  Juergen creating a tense triangle I loved.

2055175,4,B0002234Y0,"Great series -- all of the shows.  Interesting and in-depth characters, although much of the series is repetitious. Most of the commando scenes seem to take place in the same location -- some basement of some sort of factory. Peta WIlson is gorgeous, but she is not the best actor/actress in the show. The two villains are worth hating, but their acting skills carry the show. Love scene are cut short, unfortunately, but we see them in unused or edited scenes. Too bad. We need STARZ for the show.",1455148800,,498,4.595505617977528

The first two seasons are excellent and the writing stayed fresh and relatively believable.  I recommend Nikita highly to individuals who enjoy shows such as ""24"", ""Homeland"" and ""Person of Interest"".  Nikita is from the same two who went on to create and produce ""24"".

Fast paced, action packed and hard hitting.
No punches pulled from the first episode to the two episode season finale that's gauranteed to leave you wondering just who 'really is' in charge of Section?

2055237,5,B0002234Y0,Hi! I very much enjoyed all 21 episodes and deleated scenes features. I got a bargain $7 price from Warehouse Deals. The discount made this box set appeal to me. There are 5 complete season box sets in the series. Price is why I bought Season 2. For those unfamiliar with the series I will mention that computers play a big role in the scheme of things. The characters blend together very well in the overall plot. My interest was sustained the whole way through 6 discs. The box set might make a good holiday gift. I recommed this product for a very enjoyable viewing time. Maybe worthwhile to check the rating before purchasing for family viewing.

2055241,5,B0002234Y0,"Season One left you on the edge of your seat for four or five months (can't quite remember!) until January 1998 when Season Two premiered. And boy, was it worth it. Every. Single. Second. Why do you ask? Because a show hooked up its two leads in the season 2 premiere. One of the fastest hookups and extremely daring for a cable show airing on USA Network. Producers pushed the envelope of 'decency' and showed a completely nude scene for the first time (I believe) on BASIC cable. Fans nation- (and eventually world-) wide were shocked, awed, and delighted. Quite frankly we got a nice view of Michael's behind. And a beautifully rendered love scene.

And then they took it all back with the next several episodes. Season two sees Michael and Nikita together in the premiere, and then see-sawing back and forth between love and loathing for the next 21 episodes. It has some amazing character-building episodes: Hard Landing, Not Was, Psychic Pilgrim, and Half-Life to mention a few.

Caution to newbies: Season 2, and every other season in the series, ends on a cliff-hanger. And at least you don't have to wait four to six months to get your fix. So I'd advise, if you're an addict...to buy all the seasons at once. Otherwise you're going to be throwing things at the TV come 'End Game.'",1322265600,,1290,4.6535087719298245

2055261,5,B0002234Y0,"YES!!!! Just like the last season, this one starts with a BANG!!! It's been nearly six months since Nikita has escaped from Section 1, and life on the outside hasn't exactly been what she expected. But that all changes when she is reunited with Michael. Soon after that she returns to Section 1, and the season just never seems to let you catch your breath. It's so easy to see why in it's first two seasons Nikita was the number 1 watched show on cable television.

As spectacular as season 1 was, this season just seems to build upon that solid foundation. A foundation made of characters, storyline, and some of the best dialogue ever written. Every single episode will simply leave your mouth salivating, and begging for more. The character development with Nikita this season was fantastic. By the end of this season Nikita has become so much more than just an operative. She's become something Section truly fears.

Not to mention you get hit with another season finale that makes you wanna go out, and buy the next season IMMEDIATELY!! As a matter of fact the last two disks of this season can only be summed up in one word...PERFECTION.

Versitile and often times predictable but edgy and deep as well. Great season. Highly recommend. Peta Wilson and Roy Dupuis shine as Nikita and Michael. Eugene Glazer and Alberta Watson are cold and somewhat heartless as Operations and Madeline. Don Franks as Walter is a confidant above all others. Matthew Ferguson as Birkoff is excellent as the shy, young computer geek who isn't afraid to help Nikita when she needs it.",1238025600,,539,4.74468085106383
2055263,5,B0002234Y0,"Having praised the first season, I must say, that while the show is still very good, the second season is not as good as the first season.  My overall sense is that the powers that be unfortunately saw only one thing in their very powerful show: the ""chemistry"" between Peta Wilson (Nikita) and Roy Dupuis (Michael).  In many respects season two is a repeat of season one, only with the focus on Roy's character, Michael.  Yes, the stories are different, but the themes and statements about relationships are the same.  As openly stated in the commentaries, they producers/staff were focusing on the ""sexual tension"" that Roy and Peta engendered in their performances--a huge mistake, from my perspective, that nearly stalled the show.  Again, I feel that the best attribute of season one was that the show took a ""hard look at the realities of relationships mirrored by the microscopic world of Nikita."" Sadly, the second season failed to fully build on that foundation, and instead focused on ""teasing"" viewers with the never ending ""sexual tension.""  I personally did not care for the character reversals of Michael and Nikita; indeed, I often felt I was watching ""Le Femme Michael"" instead of Le Femme Nikita.  On the other hand, the second season did incorporate what I believe is referred to as a ""B story line;"" that is, the development of other characters in the Nikita environment: Operations, Madeline, Walter, and Birkoff.  In doing so, they introduced more varied forms of relationships that ultimately--and thankfully--saved the show.  In spite of my stated ""problems"" with the second season, overall the second season still provided outstanding performances, and many of my comments about the first season hold true for the second season.

Please keep in mind that I never saw the show on television, and, therefore, my observations are based upon viewing the episodes from the DVD box set.  As for ""missing"" extras or other ""problems"" other reviewers have found with the quality of the DVDs, I again must state that this is a late 1990s show made on a small budget and packaging/description errors do happen.  Conversely, I would agree that it would be nice to hear a commentary or two by Peta Wilson; but, in the final analysis, it is the opportunity to watch an outstanding television show--sans ads--that is most important.",1204761600,2,2341,4.989717223650386

What happened to the ""Making Of La Femme Nikita and interviews with cast and creators.  On Disc One it says to check out discs 2,3 and 6 for more special features and there aren't any!!!

Then I purchased Season Two and the same thing there, only two or three deleted scenes and that's it!!!  And also on Disc 5 Episode 18 which is called ""Off Profile"" is actually episode 21 which is ""Adrian's Garden"".  Then on Disc 6 I looked at episode 21 called ""Adrian's Garden"" and thought that maybe that would be ""Off Profile"" and it was once again the same Episode ""Adrian's Garden"".  So I have the same episode twice and I am missing one Episode.  I have a funny feeling that these discs are not the originals and I am hoping to get a refund.

I'm confused by the assertion that the delay in its original release was due to Garbage and #1 Crush on the soundtrack, or rather, I'm confused by the claim that the problem was resolved by replacing the song.  Maybe I got one of the old versions by accident, but #1 Crush is definitely on it -- I own and love the soundtrack to Romeo & Juliet and I recognized that song immediately.

I had difficulty locating the Gag Reel, but finally did.  There is an arrow at the bottom of the first screen under Special Features on the last disc.  Selecting it takes you to a second page of features, including the Gag Reel.  I actually had to try selecting that arrow a couple of times before it took me to the second page (my first few tries sent me back to the Main Menu) so keep trying if you're having difficulties.

Roy Dupuis is that rare diamond like a James Dean... but add an utterly unique and captivating masculine expression of strength, tempered by an inner humility that is beauty in motion. Then add an almost yogic-like equanimity about this actor that offs (the bad guys) without hatred, that loves without speaking, that ""is"" so subtly... you can't miss him. He is not acting, he is ""being"" in a way I have never seen done before. Roy Dupuis is able to bring to the screen something that commands you to see a certain nobility, an innocence, and an unspoken goodness, if you will, while managing to survive the loss and oppression that are inherent in being an operative at Section One (especially if you are Michael, the character he plays). Section One being the most covert anti-terrorist group on the planet. In a reality that is as intense as any I've seen in a television series, where life and death hang in the balance moment by moment, he remains utterly untouchable in his perfection, for eyes that have eyes to see... I don't know how else to say it. This is far beyond a sexual charisma, though there is that, but there is so much more than that. Roy Dupuis is a drop dead gorgeous physical being, and sexy because of his combination of looks, intelligence, and an incredible sensitivity in this man that comes through his eyes unlike any actor to date I've seen.  This man can deeply affect you without saying a word, something rather refreshing in a world of too many words with too little meaning.  This man is an extraordinary talent that I have yet to see the likes of... He has an almost spiritual charisma that transcends any performance by an actor that I have ever seen. After watching Dupuis, I find my favorite film actors affecting me like milk toast.  Why?  Because Roy has a combination of things going for him that are one in a million, and this character allows him to put it all together for us.  And the series is the best I've ever seen, mainly due to his presence.  It keeps you riveted to one great episode after another. Peta Wilson is his perfect compliment as Nikita-- together they make this series happen. In my life I have never been so affected by an actor: American, or European as I am by Roy Dupuis in this series.  The undercurrent of tension in his sublimated love for Nikita (that is death to them if revealed), is intensely beautiful to watch played out by this duo.  Roy Dupuis, I am thankful you have graced the planet while I am alive to see your work. Roy Dupuis is able to tap something close to perfection in this character.

2055274,5,B0002234Y0,"USA Network's La Femme Nikita was undoubtedly, ""the cure for the common show."" This tag phrase characterized an entire Sunday night lineup for the network but eventually the words defined La Femme Nikita more than any other program. Yes the show is sleek, smart, sexy and fun-escapism at its best-still it requires more of its viewers than merely sitting in front of the television.  While most episodes could be described as stand alone, there were several episodes that arched a season and eventually the entire series.  Fans of the entire five season run can attest to that.  Though producers and writers insist they never plotted more than a few episodes in advance, their attention to detail and honest awareness of the history of the covert world of Section One and its players produced a seamless continuum as fans experienced thrilling highs and devastating lows wondering what would come of their heroes. Produced in Toronto but set all over the world, La Femme Nikita allowed its worldwide viewers to strike an alliance with the show and its characters which spawned unprecedented loyalty.

Now La Femme Nikita has experienced a resurrection of sorts thanks to Warner Brothers' release of the first two seasons on DVD. Just one day after the release of the second DVD set comes the announcement that fans will get season three after only a short three month wait. Now new fans can experience the series from the beginning inspiring even more loyalty and viewers.  A suggestion bandied about since the release of the first season would be to make the DVD set viewable in places other than the United States and Canada.  La Femme Nikita is arguably one of the most recognized international cable television programs and DVD sales would undoubtedly go through the roof. Considering fans were able to bring back the series after it had wrapped production for an additional 8 episodes to see tortured lovers Michael and Nikita (portrayed by Roy DuPuis and Peta Wilson) reunite once more, it seems inevitable that the voracious overseas appetite for the series will eventually be fulfilled.",1111104000,26,2094,5.002873563218391

2055276,5,B0002234Y0,"Some reviewers, one in particular have been helping spread rumors that the original season 2 set of La Femme Nikita was defective and that is why it was cancelled the first time out.  This is untrue.  The real reason for the cancellation, as I am sure many of you know, is that Warner Bros. was having trouble licensing some of the songs that were on the soundtrack for the originally aired episodes. Check your facts before you put something down for others to read, please, we don't need any more alarmists out there!  The second release of this set coming up, will no doubt feature some new music, as has been done with many of the TV-to-DVD sets, although I don't know for sure.  Warner Bros. may have been able to iron out the licensing difficulties for the original music.  I was one of the lucky ones, and was able to purchase the original set before they recalled them from stores, and I have happily watched much of it, and found absolutely nothing wrong with it technically.  And I am happy to have it, especially since, as a music lover, the soundtrack is one of the many reasons I love this show.  So if you have the chance to purchase the original set used, and don't want any music changes, go for it.  That said, the set itself is rather short on extras, however, fans don't buy it for this reason.  The sound and video quality are great, and the menus and packaging similar to the first season set.  Definitely worth the price.",1110931200,7,1443,4.452471482889734
2055277,5,B0002234Y0,"The Feb. 19th review blames Garbage, but I'm not so sure it's their fault. The song that got pulled was from the ""Double Date"" episode.

2055278,5,B0002234Y0,"Season 2 was literally yanked at the last second because of copyright issues with one of the background songs by a 90s band called Garbage.  Remember them?  Well, they remember themselves and got their knickers in a proverbial snit that they were not reimbursed for the re-release on DVD.  This is not the first time this kind of thing has happened on a DVD release.  The ""industry"" just put out a lot on DVD without taking into consideration the concept of re-release rights for music, and even performers (resolved by the most recent SAG contract negotiations).  While I support artists being paid, Garbage should have been more willing to deal.  Their song was simply removed and the discs remastered.  Had they been willing to sit down at the table, they might not have been left out completely.  Given their relative obscurity these days, their song *could have* inspired a retro craze.

This is a must buy for anyone who likes the series and those that like spy thriller type entertainment.  The actors/actresses give nothing less than their best to make this series deeply moving and exhilirating.  The second season also has some totally unexpected twists that make it not only surprising but original.  This show should have been prime-time entertainment.

2055286,5,B0002234Y0,"I discovered La Femme Nikita while I was working out at the gym one day, of all places, because it was playing on one of the 30 TVs. The next day I remembered to watch the show at home and found myself almost instantly addicted to the series because of the good (beautiful) actors and the gripping story. If I recall correctly, La Femme Nikita ran only 4.5 seasons, but I was lucky to catch almost all of the series over several months on one of the cable channels.

That said, I've got to say that the 2nd is a very important one to the story. After Nikita escapes Section One at the end of season one, season two brings Nikita back to us as an even more empowered and strong willed character. Her shere will to adhere to her own sympathy for humanity clashes harder than ever with Section One while the dynamic between her and Michael grows more complex. In season two Nikita becomes more deeply empowered in herself but still does the things she hates as an agent. Section One, on the other hand, is resolute in becoming even more evil in order to prevent evil. Section One's role grows and develops to become a character player of its own as well.

Since I've seen the series from beginning to end, I remember there are, in this round, a number of very important storyline episodes that add to the final outcome of the series in this round. I am greatly looking forward to the release of season two, Warner willing.",1100390400,9,1419,4.391634980988593

There's a short recording which shows when Nikita and Micheal can't help laughing while acting,I've never seen micheal smile,don't know how to describe it when I see it; and he did something funny too, including shooting with water guns.^_^

As a huge fan of this series, I had hoped to get all of the episodes on DVD. I still have all of the episodes taped from USA, but I love the DVD format. I find it frustrating that I can't get a straight answer about why I can't have this in my possession. The first set I pre-ordered was cancelled and my money was given back when it was recalled. Then, I noticed some on ebay (or half.com) and promptly tried to order one from someone who said that they had retained 500 copies! My money was quickly taken but the item was never sent. So, I am out about $90 and again very disappointed. (by the way, he went by the name singerman books 1979. Don't trust him!) Anyhow, if anyone still has one of these sets at a reasonable price, I am dying to obtain one set.

It is one of the best TV series ever made.

Big disappointment #2 (for the purpose of this post, but it actually happened first.) Gene Roddenberry's Earth Final Conflict, another TV series that I loved when it was on. I was delighted to hear that this series was coming out on DVD, but at the last minute, Universal swooped in and absconded with the rights to the first 2 seasons. I don't remember ever seeing anything about Universal having anything to do with that show, but the company that held the rights to the other 3 seasons released them quickly over a short period of time, while Universal sat on the release of the 1st 2 seasons and never said anything about what was going to happen with that.

As usual with Warner Brothers dvd sets, the transfer quality is ABYSMAL. If you were lucky enough to have quality digital cable when B5 was showing on Sci-fi or TNT, you'd have a MUCH higher quality showing than off the dvds. (B5 mentioned because it is also a warner product that suffers from TERRIBLE transfer.)

Season 2 is highly energetic, with some wonderful sequences.  It retains the usual nobody-really-wins-in-the-end trademark, or at least, without almost 'selling your soul'.(a bit like buying the DVD at auction)  But, most of all, it remains highly entertaining, for those of us who love this sort of stuff.  The characters run true to form, and we get to know them even better.  However, it has to be said that the music worked really well in this Season.

This is a phenomenal program. It was way ahead of its time considering what our country has been facing in recent years!  The story lines are intelligent, suspenseful, and so relevant today, I find astounding and intriguing their covert actions and references to known leaders, terroristic threats,etc.  I am in awe of how this show came so close to scripting scenes that were similar to current events. More than this however are the spectacular performances by Peta Wilson, Roy Dupuis and the rest of the cast. The action, the martial arts stunts, great! Peta is awesome ;I'm mesmerized by her and her role as Nikita...she is so sexy, yet sensitive and convincingly ""tough"".  Both she and Michael add a sensitivity to the harsh reality of their existence and the ""job"" they have to do. The intensity of their unrequited longing for each other; their ability to convey all of the nuances of an enigmatic relationship that the viewer anticipates will be fulfilled; the way in which they bring you right to the edge of a love that is taboo-just as the show ends, leaves you waiting for more....and that's where I am now, waiting for more.  I don't know how I missed this show when it originally ran but I hope all five seasons will eventually be released. This show has been underrated and far outshines the junk on today's TV.

Plus, unlike so many other TV shows on DVD, you can watch all episodes on each disk consecutively without going through any menus -- just pop in a disk and you're set for four to six hours.

TV shows should just stop using popular music in their shows. It's not as if anyone is watching just to hear their music. In this oversaturated media world, artists should be a little more grateful for the use of the work.

Finally, I hopped in the car and drove to some of the stores.....and apparently a lot of other people did the same because they already had a prepared speel..... if I heard one more clerk begin to tell me that they had Alias, I'm sure I would SCREAM! It got to the point where they would say,"" We don't have LFN the second season but we do....."" and before they finished, I would just raise my hand to silence them. I even ran into one clerk that admitted that the E-mail that was released to all the stores actually told them to suggest Alias!

There was an online article this morning which said that Warner Bros' problem was with releases on some of the music. Being an attorney, this made perfect sense. Probably their licensing agreements on the songs didn't extend to DVD issuances (after all, DVDs weren't an issue when LFN was made), and Warner Bros could have faced potential litigation if they hadn't pulled the DVDs. This probably also explains why we haven't (and probably never will) see the ""Charmed"" series released on DVD. Just consider the hundreds of artists whose music is featured in ""Charmed"" and also consider that, unless a prelease waiver was already obtained, Warner Bros may have to negotiate individually with each of those artists before they can release those episodes on DVD.

I was also last to find out when the release date was projected for July 2004. Why doesn't anyone ever tell me anything? Anyway, I'm so excited! I have been a HUGE fan of the show since it first aired on USA--conveniently right after I'd seen the original motion picture that inspired this spin-off.

  Someone mentioned the GAG reel; I've found it on disc 6. It's there, and although short, is very funny.

I only became a fan by watching the first season on DVD, so now I'll have to wait indefinitely to find out what happens after the finale. AGH!!!

I e-mailed Warner Bros. about the delayed release but they only gave me the run around, NO answers. What's worse is that all the sets that made it to ebay and now even amazon.com are priced from 100$-200$. That's ridiculous! Even a big fan isn't going to want to shell out THAT much.

The staff there had no knowledge of the Warner Bros. cancellation/postponement either, so I'm still confused as to what the problem is all about.

2055333,5,B0002234Y0,"I managed to get one copy of Season II for my father (a big fan) during the recall. Since then I have tried in vain to get a second copy for myself. I am keeping my fingers crossed that someday I will get Season II and all the remaining five seasons. Anyway, I just want to say that nothing is wrong with any of the disks. I have watched them all. All of them are recorded with superior quality. Season II sets, characters, plots, and music are better than ever. The Michael and Nikita on again off again love affair begins. Also we get to see the development of the other character storylines also. Season II makes you fall in love again with all the characters and the show itself. As far as the reason it was pulled from release, I have a theory that I heard some ealier discussion. After watching the episode called the ""End Game"", I am convinced that the argument given to Nikita by Operations and Adrianne for invading or not invading Iraq is the true reason this DVD set is not being released. There is a lot of discussion in that episode as to what would happen in the Middle East and in the rest of the world if Saddam was toppled. In addition to that the director and producer makes their comments on that argument, and even comments they may have given Bush the idea. I would say not to look forward to this DVD set to be released until after the election. A certain political party has successfully and repetitively pulled any negative shows off the air that could influence the voting public. Case in point: a Dateline episode that listed the soldiers by name that died in Iraq. This DVD is explosively damaging to the pro-invasion of Iraq argument. A lot of money was probably spent to delay this DVD release until after the election. Maybe even until things simmer down in Iraq. Maybe the estimated date of 2010 is correct. Maybe they think things will change by then. But it is amazing to me that when we were watching this show in the 90s, how we never dreamed much of the storylines in Nikita would come true in the future. Perhaps it's only crime is that it has become too real. What an excellent show and great DVD set! Do what you can to get a copy of Season II. It is worth every penny!

The really bad part is that the orders were canceled without explanation, or a planned day to release the DVD's.  So this leads us to wonder why were the DVD's pulled?  Well, since I can't talk about the quality of the DVD's I may as well throw out my conspiracy ideas.
Conspiracy ideas
1.  My personal favorite is that the last episode of season 2 ""End Game"" was too hot to handle in an election year... especially since End Game was also supposed to have a commentary with it (I don't want to say too much about the show as not to spoil, but it had to do with things currently going on in the world).
2.  Maybe problems with the music in the show?  The show used a lot of music that was indy type, and maybe they didn't get music rights to something.
3.  Maybe it was a distribution issue?  I don't think that was it since some people were lucky enough to get their hands on the DVD set.
Warner Brothers should show a little respect for the consumer, and at least let us know why we are deprived of the DVD set.",1090022400,9,1240,4.150627615062762
2055345,5,B0002234Y0,"I can't believe the studios won't get their act together and put out the entire series in a timely manner.  Meanwhile,  shows currently on-air, but with obviously no shelf-life, are racing to market before the public realizes how inane they really are (how many times will someone watch a reality show or re-runs of Suddenly Susan?).
Another example of this stupidity is Tim Burton's ""Ed Wood.""  The movie was released in 1994 and even starring Johnny Depp, it can't seem to make it on DVD (actually it did for one week and then all the DVD's were recalled with no explaination) this is by far one of Tim's best works (Martin Landau won an Oscar for best supporting actor).
