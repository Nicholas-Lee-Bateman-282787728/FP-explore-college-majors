3052662,5,B0010W4D6Y,"To anyone who is a fan of Jerry Herman's music,this wonderful DVD contains just about everything you could wish to know. Well-considered comment without any of the usual awful showbiz ""gushiness"" that often accompanies such biographies,this film also contains archive footage from some of the original Broadway productions,which if only for that reason alone,makes it a little treasure. Highly recommended.",1204329600,13,406,5.783333333333333
3052663,4,B0010W4D6Y,"I've admired Jerry Herman ever since I became interested in musicals in the early 1970s. In fact, my parents and I saw ""Mack & Mabel"" in previews back in 1974, and later on I went standing room to see ""La Cage Aux Folles"" in 1984. His score for ""Mame"" was one of my mother's favorites, and it's easy to sing five or 10 of his songs from memory, because they stick in your head. These are not ""simple show tunes,"" either -- many of them have complicated lyric structures, rhythms and melodies that make them interesting to listen to again and again. I even am something of a fan of ""Dear World"" and ""The Grand Tour,"" even though those shows were flops, and the scores aren't as consistent as in Herman's hits.

The documentary is poignent both because it looks at Herman's triumphs and failures (and goes into the complicated history of ""Hello, Dolly!"" on the road and because Herman today still seems to love what he does. The commentary from Charles Nelson Reilly and Arthur Laurents is especially entertaining; Reilly offers great early anecdotes about Herman's career, and Laurents' commentaries on Herman's musicals are on target. ""Dolly"" and ""Mame"" are fantasy shows, and it's obvious that Herman believed everything he wrote. Plus, the archival footage is wonderful, from the photos of Herman as a youth to the film clips of musical numbers from long-ago productions, particularly ""Parade,"" ""Mame"" and ""Mack & Mabel.""

This is an especially well-done documentary, containing many delights for theater buffs. And Herman's continued enthusiasm, shown has he coaches young performers, reminds you of why you love theater in the first place.",1200960000,26,1643,4.949275362318841

Sorry I cannot comply with the suggestion that I make this comment ' fun '",1341360000,,171,4.181818181818182
8238751,3,B0010W4D6Y,"I very much enjoyed the music and text of Jerry Herman. I had previously seen a production at the Sheet Music Society with singers who knew him and sang some of his less popular songs. The panelists mentioned the CD, which I knew I wanted.",1324944000,,239,4.333333333333333
8238752,3,B0010W4D6Y,"This DVD is worth the price for the archival footage of Jerry Herman's various shows. The home movies and TV footage are invaluable. The footage of Carol Channing performing Hello, Dolly at the White House is especially rich and priceless.

But as for the documentary itself, it's unfortunately marred by interviews that are facile, and modern footage that is clearly staged and often awkward. The scene during which Jerry goes back to his childhood home is stilted and static. And the sequence in which Jerry works with Actor Jason Graae on a revival of The Grand Tour is painfully self-conscious.

That said, there are some really moving aspects of the film as well, including the segment in which Jerry discusses the death of his long-time partner to AIDS and the fact that he himself is HIV-positive. But along the way, we have to experience quite a number of awkward moments and ham-handed film making.",1275782400,4,907,4.883116883116883
8238753,4,B0010W4D6Y,"""Hello Dolly, ""Mame"", ""La Cage aux Folles - three fabulous Broadway musicals. All written by one fabulous composer - the one and only Jerry Herman. If you love all things Broadway and all things musical theatre, then you will adore this wonderful documentary - WORDS AND MUSIC BY JERRY HERMAN. It gives a rare and candid glimpse into the life of one of the most talented and beloved American musical theatre composers. This is a fascinating look at his childhood, where his marvellous musical talent was quite evident very early on; and then takes us on a journey through to the huge successes of ""Hello Dolly""(starring Carol Channing)  and ""Mame"" (starring Angela Lansbury); to some of his lesser critical and box office gems. To write the Music OR Lyrics to a hit stage show must be a wonderful feeling. But to write the MUSIC & LYRICS must be a truly amazing feeling. Let's hope that JERRY HERMAN makes it back to Broadway with another BIG HIT sometime soon!",1220745600,3,961,4.720238095238095
8238754,5,B0010W4D6Y,"There has never been a documentary on a behind-the-scenes person in show business, that is as perfect as this one.  It covers EVERY aspect of Herman's marvelously productive career.....from early off Broadway shows (PARADE) to the Broadway hits (DOLLY, MAME, LA CAGE AUX FOLLES) to the Broadway failures (DEAR WORLD, GRAND TOUR, MACK & MABEL) to him today (when this documentary was made).  An exceptional story....an exceptional gentleman.....an exceptional production.  One not to be missed, and to be seen again and again.",1219363200,5,525,5.378048780487805
8238755,5,B0010W4D6Y,"Enjoyed it very much. I like Jerry Herman's shows. Mame was the first broadway musical i saw on Broadway. Wow! what an experience! Wish the tribute had included ""Bosom Buddies"" with Bea Arthur.  It covers Jerry Herman's career and I enjoyed the additional features on the dvd.",1218844800,2,276,4.872340425531915
8238756,4,B0010W4D6Y,"Jerry Herman is a musical theatrical genius in the most classical way, and it's obvious in this docummentary that he's also a great person, with interesting things to say, but about the theatre world as of his personal life!
Plus, the chane to see footage from Hello, Dolly, Mame, Grand Tour, La Cage, Mack & Mabel... who could ask for anything more? Well, maybe some more full numbers as extra features...",1208822400,8,406,4.732394366197183
