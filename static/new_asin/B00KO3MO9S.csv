Mia and Me Season 1 Volume 1 DVD contains the first 7 episodes in French and English, that's more than the upcoming Region 1 release PBS is bringing next month (now available as of this review edit). This is the most definitive release I've ever seen despite that it's a PAL Region 2 DVD, but you need a Region Free DVD player or a 2nd External DVD Burner to watch.

According to the back cover of this PAL DVD, it appears that the English version is presented in 5.1 Surround Sound which might be unheard of to consumers.

Inside the case, the DVD itself looks like it was originally planned for a UK release because the subtitle says ""Talking to Unicorns"". That's amazing!
When a DVD release like this has the first 7 episodes, your kids won't get bored when they're watching hours of magical fairytales at a total runtime of 2 hours 41 minutes and of course the full length episodes are uncut as seen in Canada and Europe.

Well the story begins with Mia getting transferred to a new school, given a new fairytale book and bracelet on her birthday before getting access to a 3D animated world of Centopia. Your kids can see what happens next.

Think about this, it's a must have DVD for families if you know what you're doing with compatibility because it's a PAL Region 2 DVD.",1427328000,,1541,4.568840579710145
