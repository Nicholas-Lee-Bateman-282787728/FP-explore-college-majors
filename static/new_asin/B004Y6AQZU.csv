8447936,5,B004Y6AQZU,This is a wonderful collection for the lay person and well studied Buddhist alike.  The interaction on stage is wonderful to witness. The translations are superb and the dialogue wise and entertaining.  I have watched this five times and have yet to take in all the information that is presented.  It also serves well as a daily reminder/devotional.  You know we must feed the spirit  daily. With prayer and wisdom alike.  This is perfect for your library and to share.,1361145600,,469,4.8
8447937,4,B004Y6AQZU,"As a non-Buddhist, some of the religious text was over my head. However, I greatly enjoyed seeing His Holiness interact with the other monks and lay persons on the stage.  Also, one could see his genuine devotion to his belief when he prayed and chanted. It was so refreshing to see him switch from solemn interpretation of some ancient Buddhist text to suddenly laughing and telling an amusing story that initially seems very tangential; then he ties it into the text. This seems a very wise way of making the ancient words relevant to our lives. Despite his devotion to his religion, his open-heartedness to all religions is admirable. The highlight for me was the Public Talk he gave on the last day...PHENOMENAL!! He covered a wide range of issues including the meaning of secularism, global concerns such as war and economic downturns, how to create a healthy marriage and of course, compassion. For a man so revered, he showed us that he is also very human.  Yet, he seems to embody all the good qualities we humans have, and thus inspires us by his actions as much as his words.",1340150400,8,1085,4.675392670157068
