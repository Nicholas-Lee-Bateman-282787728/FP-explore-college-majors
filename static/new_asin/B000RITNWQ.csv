8200969,4,B000RITNWQ,"This is an obscure little British chiller based on a stage play. A couple's young son accidentally drowns while they are making love and this drives a wedge into their relationship. In hopes of repairing things, they vacation at a deceased relative's mansion.

A hearty portion of intriguing dialogue ensues as they find they aren't alone. This film is extremely dialogue driven but I never found it boring. Actually, it crescendos rather nicely in the end. There is no nudity or gore to be had but the supernatural element is strong. I found myself very reminded of The Others with a touch of Don't Look Now.",1386633600,,609,4.745283018867925
