I am not pleased that the product was apparently available at amazon.com for several months while I was continuously being told by amazon.ca that it was unreleased and unavailable north of the border. Had I known about the US source, I could easily have ordered it.

This evening I received an e-mail from Amazon.ca that the product is not and will not be available in Canada. This will be terribly disappointing to my girls. It is not the first time the Amazon empire has pulled this sort of stunt.

An apology is owed faithful friends of Dragon & crew.",1374278400,,713,4.642857142857143
8191811,5,B000PIFA6G,"Absolutely no problems with ordering and delivery. We found ""Dragon"" on the Qubo channel, after cutting cable it is the only children's channel we get. Luckily we love the programming. Dragon was on weekends at 7am and I finally tired of never sleeping in and had the bright of idea of hunting for Dragon on DVD (or streaming) - 2 DVDs on Amazon was ALL that I could find! This Claymation show is wonderful, my toddler loves it. The friends are fun too, characters all very individual; the surfer Alligator, the country Beaver, mail Mouse & Ostrich. The narration voice is calm and steady and pleasing to listen to, the music is delightful. I enjoy these programs that do not bombard my child with flashy fast activity and loud characters. I'd love to find the books! Maybe on a Canadian site?",1327363200,,793,4.631205673758865
