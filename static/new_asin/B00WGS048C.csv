8713344,5,B00WGS048C,Enjoyed watching their journey and what they experienced!  Great for anyone that is planning on touring or has already done a long tour!,1484870400,,136,4.913043478260869
8713345,5,B00WGS048C,"This is a great film. Traveling by bicycle is such a romantically American way to see the country, and this film puts you in their shoes, or bicycle seats, or whatever. (AND, you have to admit, their Scottish accents make everything that much more fun.) You get a sense of what it's like to pedal long distances, from the mundane scenery and chores like pitching a tent, to the dramatic views of mountains, the plains, and big cities. You get to meet people from all different walks of life and from different places, and see the warmth and hospitality of different people. It makes me want to get on my bike.",1438214400,,609,4.495495495495495
8713346,5,B00WGS048C,Just an exciting and engaging read for all adventurous travelers.  Local culture and cuisine highlighted injected with some cute little skits along the way.,1437177600,,156,5.5
8713347,5,B00WGS048C,"When my wife, Jennifer, who did the Adventure Cycling maps for this trip, brought this DVD home, I watched it with great pleasure. An inspiring, humorous and thoroughly enjoyable account of a bicycle trip across the northern United States. Filled with beautiful cinematography, great stories of people met along the way and the ups and downs of cross-country bicycle travel, I was ready to strap my panniers on and head out the door.  While I've always wanted to bicycle across Scotland, these two Scots made me realize ""there's no place like home"". Highly recommended!",1433203200,,569,5.053191489361702
8713348,4,B00WGS048C,"What makes this such an enjoyable watch is the mixture of the great and the small, the epic and the personal. It's about America, about the staggering variety of landscapes the two cyclists encounter as they cross a continent, from the leafy and historic Erie Canal to the wild, open grandeur of the Rocky Mountains, and it's about the American people, whose stories add a human scale to the adventure and throw light on life and culture in the United States.  Our guides, Graham and Pauline, are genial and down to earth, and clearly falling for the country they are exploring; this is a pedal-powered love letter to the U.S. told with warmth and humour. The simple premise, cycling from one coast to another, also gives the film a pleasant pace and the feeling of honest, gentle discovery.

Like many good national portraits, this is told by outsiders looking in, but it also has the merit of being a practical guide. America comes over as beautiful and hospitable, but this film doesn't shy from exploring the risks involved in this kind of endeavour or gloss over the uglier aspects of the country's past and present.  Anyone considering cycling in America, or just looking for a snapshot of a country that goes beyond the obvious landmarks, will enjoy this travelogue.",1433116800,,1273,4.80365296803653
8713349,5,B00WGS048C,"This was a fun video to watch. It has been enjoyed by many of our family members and friends.
What a great idea to travel by bicycle along the old canals in the eastern U.S.--these old
canals are very historic.
The story is adventurous, enthusiastic, and full of a sense of humor...which you must
have to endure such a long trip!
I encourage anyone who is interested in doing this kind of a trip to watch this video!!",1433030400,,417,4.358974358974359
8713350,5,B00WGS048C,"I suppose anyone who goes out on the road feels at least a little anxiety, especially if its for a first long tour.  Its not just the riding or facing the unknown or overcoming the mainstream media message that the world is a dangerous place, theres also the awareness that a cross-country ride is a big investment in time.  When youve been out there long enough to get past the aches and the pains and perhaps the occasional bit of boredom, you find something on the other side that might even be life changing.  This video will give you a good sense of:  what its like to be out on the road, what its like to discover the kindness of strangers, and what its like to get swallowed up in the immensity of a long journey.  The fact that this film was largely put together on the road in the midst of all that effort and discovery is, to me, quite an accomplishment.",1433030400,,864,4.276073619631902

  My wife and I first saw Pauline and Graham in 2011 at a small campground near Shelby, Montana.  Like them we also were heading west, but by car, not bicycle.  I was intrigued by their views on the U.S. and its people, and later my band, Shady Grove, recorded much of the music for Graham's video.
  Sleepless 'Til Seattle is a great outsider's view of the states, and of what it takes to pedal across its 4000 miles.  The filming is first rate, and the story heartwarming.  It provides a fresh look beyond that of the evening news of small town America - its towns, roads, trails, and the hospitality of its people.",1432944000,,649,4.35
8713352,5,B00WGS048C,"From their first-day setbacks to the final-day joy, this is a great ride across the United States.  The hosts share their highs and lows as they make the journey.  But it's the people we meet and the scenery we experience that make this an hour worth spending in front of your television or computer screen.  The videography was excellent and spoke volumes about the beauty of the country while depicting the challenges the cyclists faced.  An excellent video that's appropriate for all ages.",1432944000,,492,4.891566265060241
