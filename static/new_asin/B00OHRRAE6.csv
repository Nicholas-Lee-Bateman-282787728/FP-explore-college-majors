6751397,4,B00OHRRAE6,"Canteen Outlaws/TLA Releasing really knows how to pick the films to showcase and bring out on DVD for the mass audiences to experience thought provoking cinema that leaves a truly memorable experience. The Third One is another one of those films that is emotionally charged and sexually beautiful in the reality of solid performances and striking imagery of filmed perfection. I really enjoyed this film. Its a film that knew what it wanted to do and did not shy away from it. It explores the idea of sexuality and partnership and most of all a different reality of relationships.

This is a Foreign film from Argentina and I really have to speak highly of it for its simplistic reality yet unique and vivid and stunningly sexy, beautiful and most of all very intense in sexuality and the emotional makeup of lust, love and experiencing new outlets on finding oneself.

I loved the reality of the frankness, the in your face approach of love making and the concept of exploring the very recesses of the mnage a trois.

A storyline done in such away the viewer can sense the ultimate desire and chemistry between the players on screen. It showcased brilliant characters. I loved the simple tone of the film. Three men, a place, a bed and the exploration of the human body. This has no huge budget and that is why it is perfection at its best in film making. Clocking in at only 70 minutes, its a film you did not want to end, but yet, when it did, it showcased everything it needed and more to complete a film worthy to recommend and to talk about. It gave a love affair of interesting and truly entertaining characters that left me satisfied and yet so beautiful I wanted more.

6751399,2,B00OHRRAE6,"Plot Spoiler Alert!!
This is an Argentinean film about a threesome. Sorry that might be a bit of a plot spoiler as so little actually happens here. Two guys who are in a relationship do some on line smut exchanges with a young lad and he comes over and they have a meal, some wine, talk about themselves and then get it on.

That is it and even at seventy minutes this still dragged. It begs the question why did they bother making it. There are scenes of graphic sex at the beginning but then the production limitations start to bite; there is only ever one fixed camera angle. There is no music, there is no point.

I can not recommend anyone to see this at all, if you like porn, then there are better ones out there, if you want a relationship drama, then there are loads to chose from and if you want a film that goes nowhere very slowly then there are better ones than this too. It is not the worst piece of film making I have ever seen it is just the least ambitious, and in the total sum of cinema only has a place as an exemplar of what not to make a film into.",1424476800,,1070,4.0663507109004735
6751400,4,B00OHRRAE6,"This story of a threesome definitely requires patience from the viewer, as it puts you in the room as the young man and the middle-aged gay couple he has hooked up with online get acquainted over dinner.  This phase is exciting and interesting for the participants but longer than we're used to as viewers.  Ultimately, they have their sexual encounter, which is shot from interesting camera angles that again make you feel like an in-person observer.  The acting is outstanding and the actors are appealing.",1420848000,3,508,4.952941176470588

8683679,4,B00OHRRAE6,Argentina must produce a lot of gay themed movies. I have watched several since I started streaming Amazon etal. Their movies are more artistic that similar products from the US - at least to my taste. The threesome sex scene was definitely hot as was the cam-chat at the start. Hope to see more like it in the future.,1483833600,,318,4.406779661016949
8683680,1,B00OHRRAE6,"Boring.  Nothing happens. Just a threesome without any interesting conversation or action.  Not interesting, not intellectually stimulating.  Not even sexy.  A waste of time.",1482624000,,174,6.125
8683681,5,B00OHRRAE6,"This is a sexy, sweet, cute dream come true. All eyes are opened to the possibility of a new kind of love. A remarkable film that will have you smiling for many reasons.",1479081600,,169,4.151515151515151
8683682,1,B00OHRRAE6,"This is an incredibly dull and forgettable movie.  If you're looking for a plot, you won't find it here.  If you're looking for something satisfyingly erotic, you won't find it here.  If you're looking for drawn out, useless dialogue (most likely used to make the movie a feature length film), you've found a winner.  If you enjoy an implied sex scene which makes up about a third of a film and contains less nudity than you could see in an FX series, you'll also be pleased by this one.  There are far better gay films out there that are sexually charged, but actually have a plot (I recommend ""4 Moons"").  There's a reason all the references to film festivals on the cover of this movie indicate the movie was a ""selection"" and not a winner...",1454630400,,745,4.481481481481482
8683683,4,B00OHRRAE6,"I found this film refreshingly emotion- and sex-positive.  Interesting that low-rating reviewers complained about the sex.  People are so frightened of how powerful sex is.  In this film it's such a lovely celebration.  It was also sweet how the young man seemed to really be interested in the couple; not just in either of the men singly.  He really wanted to be wanted by the ""Them.""  Just lovely!",1445990400,,399,4.794117647058823
8683684,5,B00OHRRAE6,"The Third One is a daring film.  It has been called soft-core porn.  It is not.  It has been said to be slow.  It is, but the slowness of it, the many long, long single shots, are at the heart of it.  Some  have said it takes patience to watch.  I found it riveting.

It is a movie about love.  Perhaps this may sound like a strange word to use in a film about a threesome.  But there is nothing exploitative about it.  An online conversation initiates it, an ordinary enough event these days, and its concerns are primarily if not exclusively erotic.

But then the young man meets the older couple at their apartment.  They begin to talk, first the two men; then the camera shifts to the young man.  This talk, not quite a conversation since mostly they are learning about one another rather than discussing other matters or concerns, is full of implication.  Each character is revealing, subtly, almost without knowing it, important things about who they are.  Before anything further happens among them, between the two older men on one hand and the younger on the other, anonymity is being stripped away.  They are becoming more real to one another, even the couple to themselves.

In a conversation, a real one,  outside on a balcony, with the city spread out before them, the young man and one of the older men talk more.  The subject turns out to be ecstasy, orgasm, not just as a way of experiencing intense pleasure but of making oneself prepared to die, as a kind of intense awareness and knowledge, a letting go through the experience of physical joy.

What follows then is, in a sense, an illustration of that.  The long scene in bed, while erotic, is not filmed pornographically, whatever that might mean, but balletically, as a sexual dance and exchange among partners.  The important thing to note during this scene is the lack of selfishness in the sexual patterns.  Yes, it is a threesome, but it is a threesome which is not only a sexual playing; it is truly making love.

If there were any doubt about that, it is clarified in the last part of the film.  The film is divided into four parts:  the initial encounter through the internet, the talk and conversation before bed, the bedroom, and the aftermath of that lovemaking.  Each section has its own pace, all slow and deliberate, but the amount of movement in the third, necessary of course, alters the rhythm considerably.  After it, the film moves more slowly again, from andante to adagio.

The last long shot of the film is the slowest of all.  It shows the young man sitting in a classroom not paying any attention to the lecture but thinking back on the night and early morning before.  Nothing is said, except for the overheard, barely intelligible lecture.  Everything important in this extended moment is to be seen on the young man's face.

There is a famous long shot at the end of Queen Christina when Cukor reportedly told Garbo to think of nothing, nothing at all.  Her face shot for a longer duration than ordinary would suffice.  This betters that moment.  It can't be described, so subtly is it acted, a matter of nuance rather than obvious dramatics.  It is beautiful.  It is about a young man slowly coming to understand, to feel, how he has been changed, transformed, moved in a night.  I suppose there must be longer shots in movies.  Straub certainly shot some.  But I have never seen one when so much emotion, so much depth of feeling, is expressed so simply.

Yes, this is an experimental film.  But it is an experiment that works.  I would include it in its patient intensity with a film like Marco Berger's equally extraordinary and even finer film Hawaii.  But comparisons are not to the point.  The Third One stands on its own as an original, inventive film that takes real risks and manages to succeed at every one.",1445040000,7,3816,4.593471810089021
8683685,4,B00OHRRAE6,It really only one encounter. Good movie but left me wanting more.,1442707200,,66,4.583333333333333
