It is the only remaining visible scar among those she acquired one  year ago on the night Vincent discovered her, bleeding and left for dead.  She apparently cherishes it.  This episode has a rather unremarkable main  plot wherein Catherine's boss is victimized (and Catherine endangered) by a  conspiracy of unscrupulous (to put it mildly) lawyers.  But there is a nice  subplot involving preparations leading up to, and the culmination of,  Vincent and Catherine's one-year anniversary celebration.
In 1998 I  conducted a poll among Beauty and the Beast fans asking them to rate the 44  episodes of the first two seasons on a 1-to-10 scale.  31 fans  participated.  ""Temptation"" finished 27th out of the 44  episodes.
