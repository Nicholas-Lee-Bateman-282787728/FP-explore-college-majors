8394625,4,B003D1B07U,The item gave me a far better insight into the history of the rock gods Pink Floyd. Recommend this to anyone who wishes to be better informed about them.,1339459200,2,153,4.310344827586207
8394626,1,B003D1B07U,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!! Unless you want to blow $18 just to listen to a bunch of mealy-mouthed Brit rock journalists yabber-jabbering endlessly about how great the Meddle album was, whilst essentially dismissing the previous albums as failed experiments, and yawning the same old Floyd stories we've all heard before, blah.. blah... They show a few clips from Pompeii and London '66 and the same group shots that are all over the internet. But the real kick in the ass is that they didn't even mention Obscured By Clouds!!! Not even a word!!! I was about to chuck this piece of shyte disc out the window but after I calmed down I wound up trading it in at the same store for $3 which made me feel slightly better. Oh well, $18 down the drain. DON'T DO IT!!!!!",1329868800,2,758,4.460431654676259
8394627,3,B003D1B07U,"If you live in Australia and you already own ""Classic Albums Under Review - PINK FLOYD MEDDLE"" - released by Umbrella Music - then you are wasting your money buying this DVD. This DVD is a copy of the above title and contains exactly the same material (although it is still very good info for PF fans & and I am a big fan). It mainly concentrates on the Meddle album and is by all means the very big turning point in the PF path to greatness.
It could have contained actual interviews of the band members but seeing the DVD is not authorised by PF music, I guess its only opinions of others.",1289952000,5,591,4.192982456140351
