I feel comfortable and happy doing so many moves adapted from belly, latin, and African dance styles, that I rarely notice the time fly by!",1498780800,2,242,4.785714285714286
8558906,4,B00AXMCIIM,"She combines a bit of yoga, belly dance and common dance moves into sessions that are made for the 5 elements, water, fire, air, earth. You can tell which were the first ones done and which one was the last one done by the technical, wardrobe and studio upgrades. I really wish shehad been more consistent throughout the series.",1467504000,2,328,4.576271186440678
8558907,1,B00AXMCIIM,I never received the 5 set DVD. They sent me a different CD which I kept but was disappointed that I was unable to receive the Belly Fit set.  I would like to purchase it if it is available at this time.,1404086400,,203,3.8333333333333335
8558908,5,B00AXMCIIM,"I recently missed the BellyFit tour in Sebastopol CA. To make it up to myself I purchased the DVD's. I love, love, love it. All 5 classes are fun and structured with a touch of spiritual essence that brings me to the roots of my Yoga practice, intentional prayer and dance, love and light, embracing the challenges of life and trying new approaches and their gifts. Classes are indeed challenging and detailed but gentle at the same time. Great purchase....oh and the music is awesome!",1395705600,2,485,4.7176470588235295

The Bellyfit system is a holistic fitness approach designed for women (their tagline is ""moving women"").  The Elements DVD set features instructor and choreographer Alice Bracegirdle.  Each DVD in this set--Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Spirit--offers a combination of cardio dance (drawing on many different traditions, from bellydance to Bollywood), core work, and yoga-based stretching.  Bracegirdle incorporates many Eastern elements into the routines, including meditations and mudras (hand gestures).  As noted on the Bellyfit web site, the workouts are designed to be accessible to all levels and abilities:  Bracegirdle has one of her two background exercisers performing modifications, and she encourages viewers to go at their own pace.

Each of the five DVDs follows the same basic format.  Bracegirdle starts with about four minutes of centering, meditation, belly breathing, and lotus lifts (a.k.a. Kegels) and then moves into an extended warm-up (8 minutes).  Following this, she teaches two separate cardio sequences of approximately six minutes each, ""take it from the top"" (performing both cardio routines together), ""cardio recovery,"" and a brief isolation segment to conclude the standing work.  The last 20 minutes or so of each workout consist of core work and final stretch.  With the exception of the Earth DVD (which was re-released with this set), Bracegirdle instructs all of these routines live, using voiceover for the opening meditations only.  She does mirror cue, but she has her own names for the moves (e.g., ""Honor the Sun,"" ""Shoot the Buzzard,"" etc.), which I found a little confusing to follow at times.  Finally, these DVDs are not chaptered on the Main Menu, although they do have rough chapter breaks at each section (i.e., the start of the cardio, the start of the core work, and the start of the stretch).

I have provided some more specific information on each of the individual DVDs below.

EARTH (62 minutes)

This routine starts with a focus on earth energy.  The cardio moves mainly target the butt, inner thighs, and hips.  The core work features some Pilates-like movements such as half-rollbacks, a variation on the Pilates hundreds, and single leg stretches.  The extended final stretch includes yoga postures such as reclined twist, bridge, double pigeon, seated twist, seated forward bend, and butterfly.

WATER (64.5 minutes)

The opening meditation here focuses on the color orange.  The cardio focus more on the torso and low back.  The core work begins with several plank moves and again incorporates some Pilates-type work.  The stretch begins seated for butterfly, hamstring and quad stretches, mermaid, gentle seated twist, and cow seat, all performed on one side before being repeated on the other.

FIRE (61.5 minutes)

Fire starts with a visualization of the color yellow and a focus on the solar plexus.  The cardio was the most intensive of all the Elements; it targets more of the upper back, shoulders, and arms.  The core work includes cat/cow and elbow plank work.  The stretch incorporates yoga postures such as some easy backbends on the floor (sphinx, updog, and bow), downward dog to warrior two, and a supine twist and reclined butterfly.

AIR (63 minutes)

For this opening sequence, Bracegirdle suggests a meditation on the color green and a focus on the heart chakra.  The cardio targets more of the upper body, including the arms and chest.  The core section was more yoga-focused--e.g., downward dog, standing forward bend, dancers pose, standing side stretch--and seemed to contain just a few core moves (c-sit with shoulder shimmies/shoulder roll and balance in butterfly).  The yoga stretch included seated forward bend, eagle arms, reclined Figure 4 stretch, reclined twist, reclined butterfly, and a short (1.5 minute) relaxation.

SPIRIT (60 minutes)

The opening meditation centers on the colors blue, violet, and pure white as well as the upper chakras, including the throat, third eye, and crown.  The cardio here is intended to target the full body.  The core section starts with several standing balance moves, including warrior 3 pose, Shiva, and standing glute stretch; there is also a temple dancer stretch for the IT band.  Floor postures include full prostration, seated sage twist, side lying quad stretch, and a brief (1.5 minute) relaxation.

Overall, Bellyfit Elements provides a fun cardio experience that is likely to be accessible to most women who are already relatively healthy.  The meditations and mudras add a calming, soothing aspect to the practice, providing additional stress-relieving benefits.",1362614400,8,4775,5.2701986754966885
8558910,5,B00AXMCIIM,"This is such an amazing set of workouts! They are based on the elements of Earth, Air, Fire Water and Spirit. Earth is the same routine that was previously released on its own a few years ago with some bonus new material at the end. Each workout follows the feel of each element it is named for. There is about 30 mins of cardio followed by hip isolations and then a yoga/pilates toning and stretch segment to make a 60 min workout for each . Each routine is different and unique-but follows the same structure. These are tought to perfection by Alice and she has 2 background girls that vary from workout to workout. The music is some of the best world-tribal-techno ever! I am so comepletely satisfied with this set. I already own the original Earth-I do wish they would have re-done that workout, but the choreography would probably have been the same or too similar for the sake of having to re-film the workout. These are fun, feminine and fiesty workouts that you would love if you like Bellydance, Yoga, a little kickboxing/cardio moves and great tribal-techno music and appreciated world traditions and religions with a focus on women or goddess studies. Alice is really a top-notch instructor! These really are workouts that are made for women to feel powerful and strong and feminine.",1362009600,8,1294,4.730088495575221
