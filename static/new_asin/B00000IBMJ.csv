7909720,5,B00000IBMJ,"Some of the clips are dated, especially when they talk about the new technology used by railroads ... must be 30 years ago.
But the sounds and video can't be beat, especially the Big Boy's.

Only wish is a for a little less talking, and a little more sound from the old Steam trains.",1390003200,,283,4.2407407407407405

I don't know if this would be more enjoyed by a novice or an expert, but I got a kick seeing the history of the steam train - and a little sad as well, knowing that I wouldn't be able to enjoy this first hand.",1273795200,,908,4.685534591194968

7909723,3,B00000IBMJ,"This documentary is a well done basic summary of Charles Lindbergh. It does not go into depth or detail about any particular part of Lindbergh's life. There are some excellent movie clips and audio clips that reflect what the 1920's were like including footage of his historic takeoff from Roosevelt field and a few short clips of comments by historians which indicate how little anyone knew about Lindbergh the man. If anyone knew Charles Lindbergh well it would be his wife Anne Morrow Lindbergh, a woman of considerble achievments in aviation and literature who traveled the world with him. She knew Charles the hero, the aviator, the husband, the father and the person. I was very disappointed that the interview with Mrs Lindbergh, was edited down to three very short clips. My advice to anyone wanting to know more about Charles Lindbergh would be to read his Pulitzer Prize winning book ""The Spirit of St. Louis"" and his autobiography titled ""Autobiography of Values"" and the Pulitzer Prize winning biography titled ""Lindbergh"" by A. Scott Berg. All excellent books.",1026950400,11,1073,5.033707865168539
7909724,1,B00000IBMJ,I find that this film spends more time with interviews than showing equipment. The meuseum has over 300 peaces of stock but only spent time mainly showing the FRISCO decopod plus the tape is produced in a slower  speed which reduces the quality of the product.,948672000,4,260,4.6521739130434785
