8471746,1,B005GJTL3M,"This movie is a complete waste of time, film, talent and money. I paid $1 to rent this and I'm mad I spent that much. It never should have been made. The plot line is pointless, the script is a joke and I've seen five year olds with more common sense than these characters portray. I cannot believe that no one told Steven Seagal this movie was trash. Do NOT do NOT do NOT waste your time or money.",1394409600,,398,4.050632911392405
