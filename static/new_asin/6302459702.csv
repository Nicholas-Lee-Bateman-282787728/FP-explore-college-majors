464761,5,6302459702,"White Men Can't Jump is a movie about basketball hustlers but the  characters are multifaceted and this movie focuses on their reasons for  hustling rather than the hustle itself.  Sidney(Snipes) hustles as a means  to get his family out of the ghetto.  He is driven by an undying sense of  family and a desire to be the provider that his family is looking for.  Billy(Harrelson) hustles out of an addiction to gambling and also a desire  to show his girlfriend(Rosie Perez) that he is becoming more responsible  with money.  The basketball in this movie is realistic as is the language  and behaviors of the players.  The real story; however, is one of loyalty,  betrayal and eventually friendship.  This is a smart and funny movie that  transcends the ""sports movie"" genre.",960681600,6,775,4.8538461538461535
464762,2,6302459702,"Most of the court action looked fake.the hustle of the Loot was cool.but this film was two movies in one. Woody had his thing&Wesley was doing his. Rosie Perez? i didn't get her role at all.the film tries to hard to  appeal to everyone. it should have stuck to the Hustle.a so-so buddy,buddy  movie.",950572800,4,299,4.518518518518518

The script the game everything speaks to this. some people have taken the title in bad light, sure white man can't jump and is generally true but the point made was that Evan if you can't jump you can still play ball. both Billy and Sydney teach each other some thing. and that is the beauty of this movie. Movies now a days don't mean anything anymore, they are just digital tricks and advanced computers etc.  this movie demands a deeper thought while providing comedy and great Basketball.

Football, basketball... these dudes were definitely jocks.  Snipes also had his martial arts background to help in his athletic endeavors. Not only a good actor but a gifted athlete as well.  Woody showed he could ball in both his acting and athletic skills.  I was in high school when the movie came out. I remember going to the theaters to see it. Correction, I was 16 and you had to be at least 17 to watch it.  Couldn't get an adult to go with me. The lady carded me and I had no ID. Wouldn't have mattered anyway. I was so bummed. Didn't see it till it came on video. Loved it! Mostly the trash talkin and ballin scenes were the most memorable. My friends and I were always quoting it. Plus, I always felt like shooting hoops after watching it. Entertaining and funny. Put on your high tops and ball!!",1444348800,,972,4.41340782122905

The basic plot is simple (if not a tad clichd) and the performances by the entire cast are uniformly great, with Rosie Perez standing out as the undeniable center of attention (she's on FIRE here).  My only qualm is that the character of Sidney becomes somewhat unlikable and remains that way.  I didn't really understand the friendship even though the chemistry was pitch-perfect.

Sidney is a fast talking, big mouth street baller who only wishes to help get his family out of their run down apartment complex.

Their paths collide on the basketball court and what turns out is a fast paced, laugh out loud, classic basketball movie.

This is not a comedy.  This is a Basketball Jones fantasy.  It's gritty and full of low rent district locales in SoCal: Watts, Venice Beach, South Central L.A., maybe East L.A..  There's a lot of trash talk and mother talk, some of it funny.  This is about a white dude who is black even though he is as white as Gomer Pyle.  And about as smart.  This is about being white in a black world.  It's about being a loser as far as women are concerned.  This is about being a loser period.

Woody Harrelson as Billy Hoyle is the loser.  Wesley Snipes as Sidney Dean is the hotshot, hotdog, street wise hoops hustler who sees some value in an undersized white guy who plays better than he looks, although he can't jump.  In a sense this is a buddy movie, 1990s style.  They team up and hustle two-on-two pickup basketball for cash on outdoor courts with metal nets.  They're good and they usually win.

This is also about their relationship with their women.  Rosie Perez plays Gloria Clemente who is a bit too smart for Billy.  She spends her time imbibing endless trivia in prep for being on TV's Jeopardy.  Tyra Ferrell plays Sidney's wife.  She's also smarter than her man but long suffering in the ghetto.  Some real life hoopsters make an appearance.  I spotted Marques Johnson and Nigel Miguel, both of whom played for UCLA.  Ron Shelton, who wrote and directed the excellent baseball movie Bull Durham (1988) wrote and directed here.  He does a good job although I do have some points to make.

One, you can't hustle hoops in the manner depicted.  The main problem is the officiating.  There is no way to settle disputes about fouls and who touched the ball last when going out of bounds.  I played pickup basketball all over the South Bay area of Los Angeles for decades and I can tell you that when the games were close every missed shot was a foul, and the only way it got settled was to ""shoot for it""; that is, the guy who claimed he was fouled when he missed the shot had to ""do or die"" from the free throw line or (more often in the bigger games) from the top of the key.  If he makes it, his team gets the ball out of bounds.  If he misses, the other team gets the ball.  If you're playing for some serious money, these disputes would go on forever, not to mention the fact that somebody might just lay some hard fouls on somebody and what you would end up with is the bigger, tough guys winning.  In fact, if one team is about to win against a bigger, badder team they might NEVER get a shot off.

A secondary problem is the white ringer deal only works once.

In reality there is enough ego involvement in these pickup games that you don't need to put any money on the line.  Your self-identity as a basketball player is already on the line.  Additionally, most guys who play pickup basketball play it for recreation, for staying in shape, for camaraderie.  And yes there are some VERY serious pickup games with some very good players all over the Los Angeles area, although the best of them are played in high school, JC or college gyms indoors.  Incidentally, by the time this movie was produced (it came out in 1992) most of the games in the L.A. area were played full court, not two on two; and before that, going back to the sixties, the default half court game was three on three.

Well, in a Hollywood movie a realistic depiction of a milieu usually isn't the point.  The point is entertainment, and in this sense White Men Can't Jump does alright.  Snipes and Harrelson, by the way, can play a little, although it's mostly the camera work and the slow-mo that makes them look good.",1250985600,,3756,4.371387283236994

465979,5,6302459702,"Woody Harrelson of ""Cheers"" fame teams up with funnyman Wesley Snipes in a basketball themed movie where the two con their way around LA's basketball courts to earn a living.

My favorite part of the movie is when Billy Hoyle's (Harrelson) girlfriend Gloria Clemente (Rosie Perez) appears as a contestant on the hit quiz show ""Jeopardy!"" and wins $14,000 thanks to categories she had been studying during the first couple scenes of the movie.

This movie will surely get you laughing when you watch it.  I highly recommend it.",1185235200,2,526,4.887640449438202

They make such an ideal couple they did Money Train right after this.  But give the script and directing credit.  This is a simple but well acted and crafted film.  The chemistry is great.  I enjoyed watching it again.  Feels as fresh as it did the first time...",1151798400,,386,4.521739130434782
465981,5,6302459702,"This film has got to be one of the best I've ever seen. Right from the beginning when Billy and Sydney are first introduced to each other it is undeniably pure genius. It has many different elements to it all brilliantly done comedy, drama, romance and of course the best of them all - basketball. I love hearing the trash talking out on the courts.",1130284800,3,349,4.384615384615385
466032,3,6302459702,"On-court scenes are entertaining, even though the Director used an excessive amount of slow-motion.  Snipes and Harrelson are entertaining and believable as basketball hustlers.  However, Rosie Perez pretty much killed this movie for me.  I can't stand her - the way she lounges around the apartment doing nothing expecting her boyfried to support her stupid ""destiny"" to be on a game show, the alcoholism, the three-foot thick fake Brooklyn meets Puero Rican accent, or how she always seems to get her way by taking a seat on her boyfriend's lap.  The scene where whe asks Snipes' wife for a refund is a joke.  Just shoot hopes and talk trash, fellas - leave all of the ""Movin' On Up"" stuff for the Jeffersons.",1092355200,2,711,4.795081967213115
466033,3,6302459702,"Wesleyn Snipes and Woody Harrelson are an unlikely duo in this story of two basketball hustlers. The two take to the courts with Snipes playing the loud mouthed Sidney who is unluckily paired with the dumb looking white boy Billy played by Harrelson. All of the brothers know white boys ""got no game"" and know Sidney will be taken for a ride. Both Sidney and Billy surprise their opponents and milk them for all that they're worth. What a surprise. We have a vanilla and chocolate team that hustles every would be basket-ball players that come as they go from tournament to tournament.
  Most would find this a fun film filled with action, great athletic moves and a sound track out of this world. We can laugh at the foibles of both characters and say right on to their equal opportunity partnership. As pure entertainment we can get our chuckles but a closer look reveals  some deep seated stereotypes and myths.
  Rosie Perez is portrayed as Billy's booze drinking, sex starved, hoochie coochie Puertorican mama who memorizes useless information in hopes of being on Jeopardy. She is insulted by Billy throughout the movie as he continuously loses her money. Why is this woman staying with this man? Perez's talents is wasted in another role of being a sex fiend gal who exhibits no agency of her own.
  For all his talen, Snipe's role isn't so hot. He portrays the stereotypical Black man in the ghetto hustling from one scheme to another supposidly trying to support his family. The chump change that both men bring to their wife/girlfriend is a laugh if you know what it takes to support a family. Essentially the women are portrayed as weak, Black men are shown as full of jive and the white boy is just making his way through the crowd.
  Just what is the point of the movie? Brotherhood? Financing your dreams? Or is it a wonderful movie portraying the basketball skills in the ghetto? You decide.",1045440000,7,1906,4.682634730538922
466034,5,6302459702,"This is one of the best films I have ever seen. I favor its technical side and the very idea itself as well. It depicts a reality that is fictious but it can easily be adopted to the real world. What is the most optimistic about this movie is the fact that a pair of main characters resemble ordinary human beings, like everybody. They need to fight their way thru life and, as it always happens in the real world, they find themselves in better or worse circumstances. The most encouraging thing is their special kind of friendship and their easiness to face whatever life brings. Due to that fact they endear themselves to the audience which turns a blind eye on their hustling activity. Still, they have to have some sort of income and, as long as it does not hurt anybody physically, the audience sides with them. I would very much like to have this movie in my home library but unfortunately there is no version available that is distributed in my region on DVD; and I feel extremely sorry about that; I think I would enumerate this as a main drawback of this movie...

I just love watching his eyes move back and forth when he is trying  to show up Woody Harrelson.  The rap he delivers about hearing Jimi Hendrix  is quite memorable as well.  Woody Harrelson gives his Billy Hoyle  character lots of depth as both his hustler and sensitive side are played  well.  Rosie Perez is cute with her concern over the Stookie Brothers.  Anyway, the story line has many coemdic and action filled moments that will  appeal to a wide audience outside of the basketball world.  Go rent it  today.",968112000,,599,4.580952380952381

Billy  Hoyle (Woody Harrelson) is a street-wise basketball player with something  to prove.  He heads to Venice Beach to hustle big-time players for money.  Hoyle bites off more than he can chew when he meets up with Sydney Dean  (Wesley Snipes) and becomes the victim of a hustle himself.  However, Dean  and Hoyle can't deny the bond of friendship between them, no matter how  hard they try.  When Billy loses his girlfriend because he loses all of  their money and Dean's home is robbed they turn to each other for the  solution...the ultimate pick-up game vs the legends:  Eddie ""The  King"" Farooq and ""Duck"" Johnson.  $2500 to play, winner take  all.  Do they win?  Well, as Gloria would tell you, ""Sometimes when  you win, you really lose.  Sometimes when you lose, you really win.  And  sometimes when you win or lose you actually tie.  And sometimes when you  tie, you actually win or lose.""  Yeah, it's confusing.  But that's the  way it ends.
