6197685,4,B00HQLZC18,"After years of looking for ""The Hot Spot"" with Don Johnson, Virginia Madsen and Jennifer Connolly, I was excited to find it on this disc with three other movies for under $7.00.  I preordered it as it hadn't been produced yet and within a couple of weeks it was released and in my mailbox.  ""The Hot Spot"" is one of those predictable movies but it is worth watching strictly because of Don Johnson in his heyday.  It starts out with a drifter in town who promptly secures a job at the local car dealership and begins an affair with the owner's wife (Madsen), while beginning to have feelings for the young woman (Connolly) who works in the office there.  But there are conflicts and twists and turns and some turn out to be just what you think and others might take you by surprise.  I haven't even watched the other movies on the disc and don't know if I will or not.  I bought this CD for one reason, Don Johnson.  Since this movie appears to be obsolete, or selling for hundreds of dollars, which is ridiculous, I got exactly what I wanted at a reasonable price.",1399161600,5,1065,4.375634517766497

8634366,5,B00HQLZC18,"A Nastassja Kinski admitted fan, I originally purchased this DVD for the 1982 film Exposed (impressive Parisian photography); I considered the other three films a bonus. IMO the 1972 film The Visitors starring James Woods and Steve Railsback (who later played Charles Manson in a multi-evening made-for-television movie) also is a worthwhile film. Yet the two films' plots are not wholly unique: Exposed shares plot similarities with John le Carre's classic novel The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, and in retrospect the 2016 film Jack Reacher starring Tom Cruise shares plot similarities with The Visitors.",1510963200,,607,5.268041237113402
8634367,5,B00HQLZC18,"I got this for Exposed as I am a huge Nastassja fan and this is not available in any other dvd format except for one which will not play in the US. I also love Rudolf Nureav and I loved this film when I saw it as a teenager. Dennis Hoppers The Hot Spot is also awesome. It contains what I believe is Miles Davis only film score and the Visitors is a rare Elia Kazan film also not available anywhere else on dvd. Tough Guys Dont Dance is an oddity but Im glad to have it in my collection. I watched this on my big screen in my playstation and the picture was not that bad at all. It certainly does not have ""lines"" in it as some have said. for 6.00 this was a great bargain and gave me several films I had been really wanting - recommended",1491955200,,738,3.9266666666666667

8634369,3,B00HQLZC18,"First, the good news: MGM/Timeless Media's 'Movies 4 You - Film Noir/Thriller' set (disc, really, as there is just one single-sided DVD) is a very inexpensive way to get four obscure films of reasonably good video/audio-transfer quality.  The bad news?  There's a reason most of these titles have slipped into cinematic oblivion.  Included are:

'The Hot Spot' (Orion, 1990) - Dennis Hopper directed this surprisingly watchable neo-noir featuring Don Johnson, Jennifer Connelly, Virginia Madsen and a number of solid supporting players from the period.  There's an amateurish feel to the thing (think of it as 'Body Heat' Lite), aptly embodied by Johnson's TV-caliber acting, but oddly enough that amateurishness fits THS's dark, sleazy themes and amoral characters nicely, recalling many of the poverty-row noirs of the classic era.  Presented in anamorphic widescreen.  3 stars.

'The Visitors' (1972) - Elia Kazan's violent and depressing low-budget indie (a production of his son Chris's anti-Vietnam War screenplay) wants badly to be Peckinpah's 'Straw Dogs' but merely manages to suggest the depth of depravity and desperation the latter film delivers in spades, and with only a fraction of the dynamic tension.  Notable for the big-screen debut of James Woods.  Also anamorphic widescreen, although the source print is worn and washed out.  2 stars.

'Tough Guys Don't Dance' (Golan-Globus, 1987) - Norman Mailer, in a grand display of egoism, illustrates why novelists generally make terrible screenwriters, and why screenwriters generally shouldn't direct their own works.  Over-plotted to the point of absurdity and wildly unevenly acted (poor Ryan O'Neal and Isabella Rossellini give it their all), TGDD wavers awkwardly between socio-sexual satire and intellectual pretension, all the while wallowing in its embarrassing excesses.  The curious should see it once and never speak of it again.  Picture is clean, anamorphic widescreen.  1 1/2 stars, primarily for a few memorable one-liners.

'Exposed' (UA, 1983) - The lovely Nastassja Kinski and ballet icon Rudolf Nureyev can't even begin to save this dawdling, convoluted mess of a girl-power/romance/espionage/caper flick.  A find for those who look back fondly on '80s cinema mainly for its endless supply of modeling/shopping/dancing-in-your-sweats-to-bad-'60s-music montages; torture for everyone else.  Presented in non-anamorphic widescreen. 1 star.

Content averages around 2 stars, presentation/price (no extras, though no compression-related image or audio problems that I noticed, either) 4.",1435363200,11,2565,5.735449735449736

8634374,2,B00HQLZC18,I bought it for THE VISITORS since this was it's DVD debut. And I was very disappointed with the compression issues the film suffered while I watched it. Placing all 4 films on 1 disc was a major mistake because watching the movie ever so often it resembled a bad torrent download with blurrying in some scenes. This is a true example of the term YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.,1399593600,14,372,4.253521126760563
