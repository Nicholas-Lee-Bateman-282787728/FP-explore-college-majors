2862857,5,B000R9YLIQ,"I am 6 months pregnant and this video is perfect for me, I'm normally a gym rat so when I do 'Yoga Pregnancy' I still feel like I'm keeping in shape without having to worry about the safty of my baby.  I can't wait to do the post-natal workout after my baby is born.",1190160000,9,266,3.925925925925926
2862858,5,B000R9YLIQ,Received as a gift from my sister at the very beginning of my pregnancy (when I was pregnant) did the prenatal AND doing the postnatal parts religiously. Love it. Been doing the postnatal part since the baby was born and I feel as fit as a fiddle.,1507593600,,247,4.276595744680851
2862859,4,B000R9YLIQ,"This is my first yoga DVD. I really like it. And for days that Im not feeling so up to it, they have some options for modifications. I like it a lot but I wish there was more than just the one workout for prenatal. Its a little boring doing the same thing ever day. But other than that, its a good by!",1507075200,,301,3.7936507936507935
2862860,5,B000R9YLIQ,I got one DVD for me and for a friend.  I love it.  We I need a good stretch I follow the directions on the DVD and it helps.  I am not big into fitness and I was hoping to start before I got pregnant but life happened.  This is good for someone out of shape and needing a good stretch.  It also helped me from getting those horrible pregnancy leg cramps.  My friend seems to like it as well.,1506384000,,392,3.8375
2862861,5,B000R9YLIQ,"This is my favorite prenatal exercise DVD. Seiniger is so down to earth and does a great job leading the session. The music is great and I never get tired of the video. My only wish is that there was less cheesy pregnancy talk, like ""Maybe you can think of this pose as a preparation for that... special moment"" ;)  I'm okay with interesting stuff like, ""This pose is great for reducing the pain of back labor"" but the other stuff just breaks my concentration and makes it awkward to do the yoga video with others (I like making everyone I know do prenatal yoga with me). But anyway, back to the positives, because this is a five star review. The flow is paced beautifully, none of the poses ever feel dangerous or too uncomfortable, I find I sleep better, have a better mood, less anxiety. And it's short! 30 minutes is so easy to accomplish each day. I did this video every single day for three months, end of 1st through middle of 2nd trimester. Then I moved and had a lot of unpacking and found myself too exhausted for yoga, but now I'm entering my third trimester and looking forward to getting back to this video. My weight gain has been right in the average zone and right on schedule (in spite of sugar habits I can't quite kick). I've only gained weight in my abdomen and I have better balance now than I did before pregnancy. I could do tree pose forever. Thanks Heather Seiniger!",1501804800,,1391,4.391472868217054
2862862,5,B000R9YLIQ,"I do this every day.  It has helped me with back pain, feeling breathless, anxiety, insomnia..overall body aches.  I can't recommend it enough!",1499040000,,143,5.173913043478261

2862864,5,B000R9YLIQ,The Mama to be will get a good amount of use out of it.  Good for her and good for the baby.,1494115200,,92,3.1818181818181817
2862865,4,B000R9YLIQ,Great for beginners. My son is two and he does it with me a couple nights a week.,1492646400,,81,3.5555555555555554
2862866,5,B000R9YLIQ,"I love this yoga workout. I have been doing the prenatal workout everyday, and can definitely feel the difference in my muscles. Great for strengthening and stretching. I like that you don't need all the typical yoga props, just a mat. I only wish that there was an hour long workout as well!",1491350400,,292,4.528301886792453
2862867,5,B000R9YLIQ,"This is not a workout video, per se. This is a true yoga video meant for relaxation and stretching (great for my back problems and unwinding after a long day). I love it. Her energy is 100% positive, she goes at a good pace, and the moves are easy to follow, and there are options to adjust the moves to suit your capabilities (or limitations, in this case. Let's face it, the bigger your belly gets, the harder it can be to move). If I had one complaint for this entire video, it would be that she says the word ""baby"" way too much...but the point of this style of prenatal yoga is to connect with your body and your growing child, and that is rather beautiful. I'm giving it 5 stars.",1490572800,2,685,4.196969696969697
2862868,5,B000R9YLIQ,"I had an easy time starting this. I have very little experience practicing yoga, and these moves and instructions were so easy to follow. I really feel relaxed and at peace when I am finished. Her calm voice is very peaceful.",1489449600,,225,4.512195121951219
2862869,5,B000R9YLIQ,"Yes, yes, yes!  The actual video quality might be poor, but let me tell you, this is pure gold in terms of a comfortable pregnancy work out that has seriously helped me with back and hip pain as well as keeping me energized!  It's been a consistent lifesaver in terms of pain management and it's not hard at all.  I've been doing this workout my whole pregnancy and I can feel an instant difference in how my body feels if I skip a few days.  I'm also not super athletic, but it's simple enough to do.  Love this workout and I cannot recommend it enough to pregnant women or even people that have back and hip trouble.  It's awesome!",1487635200,5,633,4.277310924369748
2862870,5,B000R9YLIQ,"I started this DVD in the middle of my second trimester to help correct my horrible posture. This is my third pregnancy in 5 years, and man does pregnancy and being a mom take a toll on your posture! This is not a difficult routine and I was bored at first. However, once I had the routine memorized, I could do it with my eyes closed while really focusing on my breathing and posture. It's been very relaxing for me, and I plan on sticking with it through the rest of my pregnancy. Perfect for what I was looking for!",1487548800,12,518,4.19
2862871,3,B000R9YLIQ,"I only watched a few times.  Video was fine, I just wasn't focused on it.",1485907200,,73,3.8666666666666667
2862872,4,B000R9YLIQ,"I have been using this DVD for a few weeks. It is good for a beginner yoga person. I have done yoga just a handful of times. The instructor is good and keeps you feeling relaxed. The exercises definitely focus on and stretch you're pelvic region.
The downside is, it gets boring. There is only one video for your entire pregnancy, no matter what trimester you're in, its the same exercises. Wish it had different videos for different trimesters.",1485216000,3,445,4.6455696202531644

2862874,5,B000R9YLIQ,Great for helping back and joint pain,1473724800,,37,4.428571428571429

2862877,5,B000R9YLIQ,I have done the pre natal workout and it was great. It was not too much of a workout but also not enough. I def recommend.,1470614400,,122,3.730769230769231
2862878,5,B000R9YLIQ,I LOVE this video. It got me through 2 pregnancies with easy deliveries partially thanks to this. She teaches you how to engage your core muscles and strengthen your body while maintaining flexibility. It's a lifesaver in labor!,1465603200,3,228,5.026315789473684
2862879,4,B000R9YLIQ,Really nice workout. Nothing intense and I can't see myself getting super fit from this (that's why I ordered a separate dvd). Will be great for before bedtime. The instructor's voice is nice and she gives good step by step instructions. Recommend for relaxation only.,1462838400,,268,4.977777777777778
2862880,4,B000R9YLIQ,Love that this is a very easy 30 minute workout. I had no previous yoga experience but I felt like it was easy to pick up.,1457913600,,122,3.730769230769231

2862882,5,B000R9YLIQ,"Great pregnancy yoga DVD. Started using it when I was in my 2nd trimester. I have experience with yoga in the past, but only as a beginner. This DVD has great poses that are easy and accessible. I also like the pace, overall. (There is just one part where I would like to stay in the pose just a tad longer than they do on the DVD.) I love Heather's positive comments and I definitely feel happier and healthier after each session. Also, the poses make an absolute difference in the amount of pain I have in my hips at night--my hips don't hurt at all when I've done this yoga DVD that morning.",1454889600,7,594,4.219298245614035
2862883,5,B000R9YLIQ,I'm not a yoga expert but I am into fitness. I found this to be very relaxing and a great way to stretch and overall a feel good while pregnant tool.,1454457600,,149,3.838709677419355
2862884,5,B000R9YLIQ,I suffered from sciatic pain during my pregnancies and this DVD saved me! Prenatal yoga is so great at stretching those achy muscles and allowing me to fully relax. I highly recommend this video as it was perfect for me.,1451347200,,220,4.525
2862885,3,B000R9YLIQ,"It's boring- but the stretches are good. Just can't keep watching it. Recommend it for learning g the stretches and then doing it on your own at a less nap inducing pace. Yoga is too slow for me, but the stretches did help my back while pregnant.",1450569600,,246,4.25531914893617
2862886,5,B000R9YLIQ,"I love this workout! I'm in my third trimester with some lower back pain, and it's the perfect combination of stretching with gentle strengthening. Gentle enough to do every day, and only 30min. I can't get review the postnatal workout, but I'm sure it's great as well. Sometimes I wouldn't mind holding some stretches for longer, but it's easy enough to pause as needed. Not right for someone looking for an intense workout, although a couple of poses do definitely build some strength - but I highly recommend for the stretching. The strength building poses include some squatting and some planks. There are also several poses that include doing kegels. Soothing, nothing really annoying about it (which is great if you are trying to do daily). Highly recommend for women beginner up to very fit (great for rest days if you have a high level of fitness).",1450224000,2,856,4.829931972789115
2862887,5,B000R9YLIQ,I loved this during pregnancy. It was relaxing and easy going exercise. It eases many aches and pains from pregnancy.,1447459200,,117,4.9

2862894,4,B000R9YLIQ,"I have absolutely NO experience with yoga, but now that I'm pregnant, I wanted to try exercising more and yoga seemed interesting.  I really like how easy this DVD is to follow.  Two other pregnant ladies do the poses along with Heather, and one modifies the poses for those in late pregnancy.  I really like that feature!  There's also little unnecessary talking, so there's little ""feeling"" talk to get me annoyed.  I do work up a sweat with this workout, but it is easier than the other DVD I bought (Element: Pre & Postnatal Yoga).  I think it makes a good companion for a harder workout, so I can go back and forth or pick a workout depending on what I'm feeling up to on a specific day.  So overall I really enjoy this workout, and am looking forward to trying the postnatal workout once the baby is born!",1436400000,2,811,4.402684563758389
2862895,4,B000R9YLIQ,"This is good, I did yoga throughout my first pregnancy and then fell off the bandwagon after my first was born. Fast forward 3.5 years later and pregnant with my second I decided to pick it up again and this was a good one to start with. I do wish it was a little bit longer with more variety.",1435881600,,293,3.983050847457627
2862896,2,B000R9YLIQ,"Arrived damaged. I didn't think that the price warranted going through the trouble of returning it, but the disc was actually broken in half when I opened the case for the first time.",1431820800,,183,4.575757575757576
2862897,5,B000R9YLIQ,This is great! I am currently using it nearing the end of my 8th month of pregnancy and it makes me feel great. The workouts are not too intense and it really helps with my circulation and back pain.,1429488000,,199,4.128205128205129
2862898,3,B000R9YLIQ,"Good video but move too quickly from one pose to the next for prenatal workout, probably would be uncomfortable during third trimester.",1429056000,,135,5.181818181818182
2862899,5,B000R9YLIQ,"I love this dvd! The workouts aren't very long but if you're a beginner like me, it's perfect! I hated walking while I was pregnant (it really hurt my back) but I wanted  to stay active and this dvd really helped through out the last trimester! The pace is great and the background music is relaxing.",1428710400,,300,4.357142857142857
2862900,5,B000R9YLIQ,I bought this as a gift for my pregnant daughter. She wanted a Yoga disc to work out with. She really likes this one because it's for both pre & post natal use.,1426377600,,160,3.878787878787879
2862901,5,B000R9YLIQ,"I like this workout DVD. Nothing too complex and the modified moves are perfect for me in my third trimester. I also think the instructor does a good job calling the moves and isn't annoying like some can be. This leaves me relaxed when I finish the portion I can do while pregnant, and has helped with back pain.",1425772800,,313,4.322033898305085

2862904,5,B000R9YLIQ,"I Loved this Yoga work out while I was pregnant, and could do it up until 36 weeks. It wasn't super hard, nor super easy. I have been doing yoga consistently for years.",1422316800,,168,4.121212121212121
2862905,4,B000R9YLIQ,"Low-production quality so if that kind of thing bugs you this will not be the video for you. I enjoy this prenatal flow. It is just what I was looking for: gentle, relaxing, and something I can do every day and easily modify. This is not what I would call a workout, it is more of a daily flow to keep you loose. Lots of side stretching, good hip openers to keep that area free (mine get super tight in pregnancy), and a good focus on keeping pelvic floor engaged. I am 20 weeks along right now, so I can't speak to the postnatal portion, but I would recommend the prenatal flow and am pleased I found this.",1420588800,,607,4.1525423728813555
2862906,5,B000R9YLIQ,"I owned this cd for the last 6 years, and must admit I still use it on the days I need that extra stretch, and have my two girls doing the yoga right besides me. I used the cd for both of my pregnancies and postpartum, and it really helped with flexibility, restlessness, and helped me stay in shape and have energy. The sounds are calming, and her voice is great (sometimes squeaky or hyper voices are annoying when you are trying to relax). Anyhow awesome cd.",1420502400,,461,4.310344827586207

Unfortunately, I sent it back even though the content looked good.",1407369600,,213,4.35
2862911,5,B000R9YLIQ,"The prenatal workout is great! I'm in my 3rd trimester and the stretching feel so good, and helps give me a little extra energy. I bought this DVD when I was pregnant with my first son, but I never did the postnatal workout after he was born.

2862913,4,B000R9YLIQ,"Good for beginner yoga mom to be. Helped with a lot of 3rd trimester aches. I only wish there were more than 1 pre natal yoga workout on the tape because it would be nice to have the option to try others. Nonetheless, good workout for a yoga newbie that helped in the late 2nd and 3rd trimesters.",1406419200,,296,4.120689655172414
2862914,5,B000R9YLIQ,This was the video I found myself reaching for over and over again while pregnant. I had a few others (Complete Prenatal Vinyasa was another favorite) and while others provided more of a workout this video ended up being the speed I liked most. (and I have practiced yoga for many years.) Since it is pretty mellow and only 30 minutes it felt easy to commit to when I didn't have a ton of energy and always made me feel great during and after. I used the video right up to the very end of my pregnancy and would recommend it to anyone - either new to yoga or to use on your lower energy days.,1406332800,4,592,4.112068965517241
2862915,4,B000R9YLIQ,The length of this video is perfect for a working mom to be be. I am just entering my second trimester so it seems a little on the easy side right now but as I progress I think it will be great workout.,1404777600,,202,3.7209302325581395
2862916,5,B000R9YLIQ,Couldn't have asked for a better yoga disc for the person who wasn't in the best of shape and had a rough go to the start of her pregnancy. Very easy yet still a challenge at first. After about a wk or two I cld gold the poses for her length of time. Have had really bad hips and lower back since about 18 wks of pre and I am currently 27 wks pregnant. I started doing this yoga disc half way through second trimester and have had very good luck with getting relief. Would definitely recommend for a person like me.,1402617600,,515,4.0588235294117645
2862917,5,B000R9YLIQ,"I'm a sporadic exerciser, not in great shape, and a yoga novice. I'm also 35 and pregnant for the first time. My obstetrician recommended that I try yoga, and, after reading many reviews, I chose this workout DVD. I'm very glad I did.

Here are some specific things I like:

-There are three women on screen, and one always does modified, easier versions of challenging poses. For anything that requires significant upper body strength or balance, I like to be able to follow her example.

-The instructor offers a lot of information, tips, and reassurance as she goes. After a few workouts, I was easily able to learn the names of poses and understand exactly how each one should benefit me (stretching, strengthening, etc.).

-During the workout, she specifically points out poses that may relieve back labor and briefly explains how some of them help prepare your body to handle labor. I appreciate this info.

-The instructor mentions a couple times that every day is different and you should modify and adjust depending on how you feel on that particular day. This was advice I needed to hear. Some days I end certain poses (plank, for example) much earlier than the three ladies on the video do.

-I'm currently 22 weeks, and I can see myself doing this workout through the end of the pregnancy. (And I'm looking forward to the postnatal workout as well).

Overall, I recommend this to any expectant mom who is in less than perfect shape or is new to yoga. Others will likely find the workout not challenging enough.",1402531200,25,1522,4.742424242424242
2862918,5,B000R9YLIQ,"This is a great video.  I find it challenging even when I'm not pregnant.  I got a headache the day after I did it for the first time @ home.  I think if you start gradually, and don't hold the poses as long it helps you ease into it.  I haven't done the postnatal yet, but the prenantal video is great.",1402272000,,303,3.918032786885246
2862919,5,B000R9YLIQ,"I was recommended this video during my 1st pregnancy and I absolutely loved it.  As a beginner, it went through an even pace that I could keep up with, and I appreciated the variations that I could do depending on how I was feeling in my pregnancy that day.  I also liked the post-natal workouts, which are similar to the prenatal, but gave me more of a challenge.  Now that I'm on my 2nd pregnancy, I went straight back to this work out.  Highly recommend.",1399852800,,457,4.341176470588235
2862920,2,B000R9YLIQ,"This video does have some decent stretches. I would recommend this video if someone doesn't work out very often and isn't in shape to start with. However, I did not feel like I got anything out of the video. It seemed to me like it was WAYYYY too easy. I was 33 weeks pregnant when I first did the video and I was doing the workout the non-pregnant woman was doing. On the flip side, I am a cardio workout kind of girl. I like to sweat and feel that I have been doing something. Again, this has some ok stretches, but I just didn't get anything out of it.",1397779200,,555,4.054545454545455

2862922,4,B000R9YLIQ,"I really liked how the focus was on relaxing and getting ready for childbirth. I can see myself using a lot of these poses during labor. The focus was not on fitness but taking care of yourself, baby most importantly, and getting ready for labor.",1394582400,,246,4.488888888888889
2862923,5,B000R9YLIQ,used this video through out my pregnancy it is very easy to follow. it also has 3 different women in it in different times of their pregnancy for different levels,1393113600,,162,4.433333333333334

The stretching exercises highlight all the muscles most needed during labor and delivery, and the focus on ""creating more space for baby"" was extremely helpful for my comfort and mood.

If you in the first trimester and want some movement but are feeling the morning sickness and nausea that accompanies that particular stage of pregnancy, this is a great way to get some exercise without overexerting yourself. In the second and third trimester (Which I am currently in), this DVD provides a great workout to energize you when you're feeling sore and tired. It's quick (30 minutes) so it's easy to find the time to do it, and it reenergizes you on those days when you're feeling too tired to do anything. Although it's quite simple, if you are someone with a history of practicing yoga, you can find ways to challenge yourself with certain poses.",1388188800,,715,4.682539682539683

Once I started using this DVD I was able to feel results, even though it seemed very basic to me when I first tried earlier on is my pregnancy.
It helped to strengthen, stretch, and calm areas of my body where I did not realize I was holding tension.

I'd always used yoga for strength training before, but this is very different.  This yoga is purely for breath, stretching, and relaxation.  Personally, I wouldn't be satisfied with this DVD alone as a exercise regimen, but I am glad to have it as part of my collection.  It is very relaxing to do, especially at the end of a stressful day.  Also, the picture quality is a little low-budget, but you don't spend too much time watching the screen in yoga, so don't be discouraged.",1380326400,,642,4.6875
2862945,5,B000R9YLIQ,"I'm not a regular exerciser but I have enjoyed yoga in the past. About 2 weeks ago I started getting leg cramps in the morning so I knew instantly I needed to get some yoga in. I am five months pregnant right now and just did my first prenatal workout. The stretches were great, just enough to get everything loosened up without overdoing it. My heartbeat increased but I never felt winded. I would recommend the prenatal workout for beginners and those with some experience with yoga. If you are a serious yoga devotee this workout would probably be too simple for you.

I am happy I got this dvd and cant wait to do it everyday. I can see how each position will come in handy during delivery. I even recommended this dvd to my sister-in-law who is 6 months along and experiencing leg cramps and back tension at night.

I love this video - it just hits all the right spots for me, and the length and pace are good.  One caveat is that the deep squats (and goddess squats) may exacerbate your pain if you have SPD or other public/pelvic pain - I'd proceed with caution.  But those aren't a huge portion of the workout.

It gives a good stretch, and is very relaxing after being cooped up in an office all day.  You definitely feel the burn, but in no way am I sore afterwards.",1377043200,,331,4.061538461538461
2862955,5,B000R9YLIQ,"I purchased this DVD during my pregnancy because I wanted to make sure I stayed flexible, calm and slept well during my pregnancy. I am a former gymnast, 30 years old and a mother to (now) two children. During my first pregnancy I experienced horrible insomnia and wanted to make sure that didn't happen this time.

The first time I did this DVD, I'll admit to being a little bit bored. I felt like it moved too slowly. I'm glad I gave it another chance because it became the best part of my day towards the end of pregnancy. I experienced sciatica starting in about week 20 and many traditional workout moves progressively became impossible for me. I tried yoga because it's low-impact and know that it can help with aches and pains. In the beginning of the video she says ""doing yoga helped me recover very quickly"" which was music to my ears; I wanted my body back.

The video itself contains two workouts- a prenatal and a postnatal workout. They are each about 30 minutes in length, give or take for the introduction. The workouts open with floor moves for about ten minutes, standing moves for another ten minutes and close with cool-down stretching (sorry for the lack of yoga jargon) and relaxation. Soon after doing this video a few times during my pregnancy I decided I would get up early to do it every day to keep calm during the day and do a different video in the evening when my sciatica allowed. I'm not the type of person to want to get up even a second early so getting up earlier was a tall order for me.

There are three women showing you the exercises in each video- beginning, intermediate and advanced. You can follow one gal the whole time or switch depending on where you are in your practice or how you feel that day. Heather is encouraging and reminds you that yoga is not a performance sport.

RESULTS, PRENATAL PORTION:
+ It was much easier to get out of bed in the morning
+ I remained calm during my stressful job
+ I remained calm through the demands of having a four year-old and taking her to and from daycare
+ I maintained my flexibility
+ I maintained my muscle tone and lengthened my muscles as well
+ I got a lot of ""you only look pregnant in your stomach"" and ""I can't even tell you're pregnant from behind"" comments
+ My blood pressure stayed low
+ I felt less physical tension
+ My balance was good al the way through the end of my pregnancy
+ In labor they marveled at my flexibility, called me ""Gumby"" (in an encouraging way) and commented on how calm I was
+ Pushing the baby out was very quick as I had built up the appropriate muscles for labor
+ Within ten days postpartum I was back down to three pounds above my pre-pregnancy weight. My body didn't look the same but it bounced back much more quickly than last time. Strangers commented ""you don't even look like you've had a baby.""

RESULTS, POSTPARTUM PORTION:
+ I can remain more calm juggling a 7 week-old and a now 5 year-old
+ I am becoming even more flexible
+ My body is firming up to where it was before
+ I have an excuse to take some ""me"" time in the midst of my hectic lifestyle
+ I feel better equipped to handle my daily demands

I use the postpartum video every other day as ""rest"" days in between more intense and high-energy exercises and whenever I need to calm down and focus.

Highly recommended. Even if you rotate and supplement with other videos, this video will pay itself off quickly.",1376352000,23,3409,4.3759873617693525
2862956,5,B000R9YLIQ,"I did the pre-natal workout nearly every day during my second and third trimester. At first it may seem easy, but her video provides a range of different ways you can make the poses more challenging as your strength increases. The best part of the routine is how amazingly relaxing it is AND how it prevents CALF CRAMPS! Near the end of my pregnancy I would be sure to get those terrible cramps if I wore bad shoes or skipped my yoga routine, but this workout prevented it.

Also, after a healthy, fit pregnancy with this DVD (and a prenatal pilates DVD and walking) I gave birth naturally after only four hours in the hospital. I *truly* believe this yoga routine contributed to that.

Now I am doing the postpardum workout and it is far more challenging. DO NOT try to do it before your 6-week PP checkup... I made that mistake and boooooy was I sore. It's a great workout and one you can do everyday. I lay my baby out in the yoga mat and have her stretch with me :-)",1376179200,2,970,4.295081967213115

Before becoming pregnant, I was used to doing the P90X Yoga videos 3 times a week.  Compared to that this is much easier-the workout is pretty short and I never feel super challenged by it, but is nice and relaxing to do...The main instructor isn't pregnant but she has two pregnant women doing the workout with her who are pregnant.  One does the same moves as the instructor and the other does modified positions if you are super far along.

What I liked about this DVD is that it's the most like being in a yoga studio.  There isn't some woman on a cliff overlooking the ocean... and I like that!  The instructor is calm and you can tell she's actually taught a studio class.  When you are not that far along, you might find the workout ""too easy"", but as you get further along, it definitely becomes more of a workout.  I still do this DVD a year after giving birth!  Great 30 min. workout when you need to just squeeze something into your schedule that day.  Of all the pre-natal DVD's I bought, this was the best one.",1373328000,,730,4.2773722627737225

2862966,5,B000R9YLIQ,"I did the prenatal workout throughout pregnancy and I am so glad I did. It was relaxing, yet got my heart pumping and muscles strengthened.
This video gets some negative reviews since it is not a fast paced cardio workout, but it does indeed leave you feeling like you did exercise. During the first trimester I found the prenatal routine quite easy, as I had been regularly exercising (mostly walking, biking, swimming and tennis) pre-pregnancy. During the third trimester, this routine was more challenging, and I honestly had to pause sometimes and sip water and nibble a granola bar. Doing this yoga routine in combination with swimming and walking kept me fit in pregnancy and relieved back and hip aches.  I highly recommend this to moms-to-be!

It is too easy in early pregnancy for a fit/experienced yogi but has been an absolute lifesaver in the last two months of both my pregnancies. It is focused and practical and easy to modify for extra or less challenge as needed. It is not too hokey but also definitely helps you connect with baby and pregnancy.,1370390400,,373,4.420289855072464

It's simplistic and basic, but I am feeling the benefits when I'm finished.  I'm 30 weeks, so I wake up feeling stiff and puffy.  This helps to get my blood flowing and my muscles moving.  Until just recently, I was doing the 60 minute P90X Stretch workout.  That worked me from head to toe, but I guess I need to understand that my third trimester demands something a bit more simple.

When I was first recovering from the first term nausea and fatigue, this was all I needed. However, it has started to feel quite repetitive and not quite enough of a workout. So I like to mix it up with some prenatal Pilates :).

I relax with this video after a long day of caring for my toddler. I actually crave this video! I love it when she says, ""yoga is NOT a performance sport."" So many people make such a big deal out of yoga, but I do it with pjs on in my living room and it's the best.

Yoga Pregnancy: Pre and Post Natal Workouts -
-good stretches and flows
-quick, 25 min session that didn't seem long and drawn out
-good hip openers

Element: Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga -
-more spiritual / yogi-ish
-quick, 25 min session that didn't seem long and drawn out

(When I will take out the post-natal workout and screen it, too) I have just been informed of, and now done extensive research myself on diastis recti (DR). Please, please beware, there are too many poses which stretch, twist or work your abs/lower torso for this video to be a completely safe pregnancy workout. Stretching only throughout the range which is comfortable for you, does not protect you from DR. 1/3 of first time moms and 2/3 of second-time Moms experience some form of diastis recti. Even if you have no signs currently, during birth and right after birth (with the counterweight of your baby gone) DR may show up. To protect yourself skip the side stretches, the down dogs, the right angle poses, the twists (and planks). To do that in this video, means sitting out 90% of the video. I can't believe that the choreographer/consultants didn't pay more attention to real health issues when they put this together. A good yoga workout should feel good today, but not jeopardize your future health.",1364860800,3,1132,4.9319371727748695
2862980,5,B000R9YLIQ,"Well paced, pregnancy safe poses, and a modified practice for later in pregnancy.

2862981,4,B000R9YLIQ,"This is a fine prenatal yoga routine, I like that it's only 30 minutes and it's a decent set of poses. I was a little put off that the main lady wasn't pregnant while doing it and I don't find myself drawn to this dvd as much as I'm drawn to my 10 minute prenatal pilates dvd - which as a 10 minute stretch session. This DVD is fine, and a decent prenatal yoga routine but hasn't been my favorite when compared to something like pilates that has more of a workout/relax focus vs. just yoga.",1364169600,,490,4.114583333333333
2862982,3,B000R9YLIQ,"I am four and a half month's pregnant and I find this DVD to be a little too easy. Maybe when I'm futher along it will increase in difficulty for me. I was fairly active before I was preggo, so that may have something to do with it. I find the instructor to be a little boring, but she does have a soothing voice which is relaxing. I would recommend this for those who were not physically active prior to becoming pregnant.",1364169600,,423,4.170731707317073
2862983,3,B000R9YLIQ,"Overall, I think this is a decent yoga video. I love that it focuses on poses that open up the hip and pelvic areas, since I'm tight in those areas and I'm trying to limber up prior to delivery. However, I find that the instructor is really annoying. She repeats the same phrases over and over. I swear the first time I did the video I thought I was going to lose my mind if she said ""Make room for the baby"" one more time. She must say the word baby 30 times during the workout. Yes, lady, I know I'm pregnant and there's a baby in there. You don't need to remind me every 3 minutes.

It's also not a super challenging video (it's fairly short too, around 20ish minutes of active poses), so I do it on the days I'm low in energy and tired.",1363910400,,740,4.034013605442177
2862984,2,B000R9YLIQ,"This DVD includes 2 30 minute work outs: one pre-natal and one post-natal. I found it to be too short and not enough stretching. I now use it after I go for a long walk or hike to stretch a bit afterwards. As a stand alone work out, I think it is in effective. However, it is easy to follow if you are new to yoga. Or if you've had a stressful work day, this would be an easy thing to do when you got home. I am a beginner yogi, 22 weeks, moderate fitness level pre-pregnancy, and 27 years old.",1363305600,,494,3.900990099009901
2862985,4,B000R9YLIQ,I have never been much ood at yoga and this was an excellent start for beginning. The stretches were easily modified. You just will need a yoga mat and yoga ball....which I had to order separately after I found out.,1363219200,,215,4.4
2862986,4,B000R9YLIQ,It's a nice relaxing set of stretches. Before getting pregnant I was used to getting a pretty good workout so this seems very mellow and slow. That being said I do very much enjoy it the stretches really are great for the sore pregnant body.,1362960000,,241,4.377777777777778
2862987,4,B000R9YLIQ,"I bought this dvd well into my 3rd trimester.  I have been exercising quite regularly (running, eliptical, lifting) throughout my entire pregnancy, and needed something to help stretch me out and ease some of my late pregnancy aches and pains.
This dvd seems to do the trick so far.  Since it is only 30 minutes it is easy for me to sneak in a session while my son is napping.  The drawback is that none of the poses are held very long.  There are also quite a few deep squats, which I was told can actually induce labor (I only have four weeks to go, so I don't want to get things started yet).
Good basic dvd for later in your pregnancy if you've been working out all along.  I wouldn't reccomend this if you are looking for a vigirous, heart pumping workout though.",1362096000,3,768,4.305555555555555
2862988,5,B000R9YLIQ,"I highly recommend this yoga video for pregnant moms looking to stretch and do a light workout.  It is a fabulous way to start the day feeling loose and relaxed.  The workout is challenging at times and provides some strength training, but it will not make you break much of a sweat.  It is also a quick workout, lasting only 30 minutes.  I find myself doing it several times a week (currently mid-day through my second tri), interspersed with more vigorous DVDs and jogging.  I find Heather's instructions easy to follow and look forward to the workout.  This is the only prenatal yoga video I have purchased and I'm very happy with it.",1361664000,,637,4.592920353982301

I've used the DVD for 4 months (3 to 5 times a week) and have enjoyed it immensely. The workout is only half an hour, so it's easy to fit into my schedule. I've found that the poses have really helped me strengthen my core muscles and my leg and thigh muscles. It also emphasizes Kegels, which is helpful to me because I often forget to do these on my own. After each session, I feel calm and refreshed. I highly recommend this DVD.",1361232000,,592,4.294642857142857

I definitely plan on doing this video several times a week for as long as I can.,1360368000,2,385,4.216216216216216

2862994,5,B000R9YLIQ,"Just as all the descriptions say, this is a great DVD for someone who has never done yoga before. And it's excellent because in the beginning, the instructor tells you who to focus on for 'modified' positions that may be easier for either a newcomer or someone further along in their pregnancy. I would definitely recommend this. It doesn't have loud music or much visual distractions. It's just a good 'ol normal yoga DVD. And it's just the right amount of time.",1360108800,,463,4.658536585365853

2862996,4,B000R9YLIQ,I was new to yoga and this DVD was both easy to follow and at only 30 min long was a great DVD to start with.

2862998,5,B000R9YLIQ,"I had a baby two years ago but I figure I should make comments on this DVD because it is such a great workout.  I never really workout regularly because of laziness, but I was diligently working out three times a week with this DVD during my pregnancy.  I love the fact that the workout is only half an hour (actually the prenatal yoga was a little less than half an hour).  I was more energetic and I felt better with all the pregnancy discomfort.  The only time I didn't workout was when I was traveling for two weeks, but I walked a lot during that time.  I had back pain and sciatica.  Although it didn't really help with my sicatica, it did make me feel better with my lower back discomfort.  I forced myself to workout and it was all worthed it.  I was able to lose my baby weight fairly quickly (gained 23 lbs and lost 18 lbs after I had the baby for one month).  Maybe because of stress as well, I was able to lose my last 5 lbs (and more) about 5 months after the baby was borned.  I didn't really do the Postnatal part of the video that often but I sweared if it wasn't Yoga Pregnancy, I wouldn't have been able to lose my weight that quickly.  I hope I will be able to do this again when I have my second baby.",1359331200,2,1221,4.045833333333333
2862999,5,B000R9YLIQ,"This DVD is slow paced, in a relaxing way. It is much more about calming down and stretching than getting a work out. There were a few poses that were challening (Warrior and Goddess poses).  I think this DVD would be great for someone new to yoga, as it breaks things down very well and does not assume the viewer has prior knowledge or lots of great yogic abilities. I enjoyed it and it was exactly what I was looking for in terms of relaxing and stretching.",1359331200,,460,4.287356321839081

I knew this video was going to be ""slow"", and that was fine with me because I was looking for something relaxing and for good stretches. Well, I hate this dvd. It made me feel nothing at all. It is way too easy for anyone with yoga experience and it's boring, but more importantly, it's not even a good stretch, which is what I wanted to get out of it. I literally felt nothing during and after this ""workout"" (aside for frustration), and wish I haven't bought it. Maybe it's good for women who want to start practicing yoga now that they're pregnant, but that's about it. I would not recommend this to anyone with yoga experience.",1358380800,4,798,4.291390728476821
2863003,4,B000R9YLIQ,"I did this dvd for the first time at 19wks pregnant with my 4th child.

I'm fairly new to yoga, I'm a pilates girl, and this dvd was definitely quite simple and perfect for those unfamiliar with yoga.

It got my heart rate up, warm feeling, and I could feel the burn at times - but I have not been doing any exercising up until now in my pregnancy - it did feel a little too easy which is the reason I docked it 1 star.  However, it's hard for me to even take that 1 star off because I am one who suffers from Pre Term Labor and this workout, while I did feel like it was a little workout, it did not cause contractions - so I LOVED that about it.

I love the squat poses, they are so good for your pelvic floor and my aches in my back and neck were definitely feeling better after this workout.

I wish it was a little longer, probably because I really liked it that much.  I think what I loved the most about it was how Heather (the instructor) stressed how important it is to listen to your body and only do what you feel you can do for that day since how you're feeling during pregnancy changes every single day - and that it's ok!

Soooooooooo relaxing at the end, I didn't even want to get up from my mat!

I would recommend this to a friend - but probably not to someone who does yoga regularly, they would probably find this one way too easy.",1357862400,3,1350,4.0111940298507465
2863004,1,B000R9YLIQ,"Calling this a workout is a joke.  It is very slow paced, with about 10 minutes of stretching, followed by 3 (easy) yoga poses, then 10 more minutes of cool down stretching which is remarkably similar to the warmup stretching sequence.  I am 5 months pregnant, was only moderately fit prior to pregnancy, am not a regular yoga practitioner, and this video did not affect my heart rate, breath, or body temp in the slightest.  I was far closer to falling asleep than burning calories.  That being said, it was quite relaxing, so if you're looking for a pregnant yoga pre-bedtime routine, then this is the one for you.

The prenatal workout is great for stretching out those muscle you will use during labor, yet strengthen those muscles holding baby in place.
I haven't performed the postnatal workout, since I am within my second trimester, but I did watch it. And it seems to be a great workout to get those labor muscles back in shape for a stronger workout.",1357084800,,580,4.586538461538462

2863012,5,B000R9YLIQ,"I did this daily during my pregnancy.  I really liked this dvd.  I haven't done the post natal workouts because free-time isn't exactly a norm when you are a new mom.  So my review is only of the pre-natal workout.

I was having back pain starting around 20 weeks and this almost instantly resolved it.  In fact, I found that if I didn't do the workout I was uncomfortable, slept worse, and started to have pain.  So it became a daily necessity for me.  I don't regularly do yoga but I found the workout totally doable.  I skipped the downward dog because I just didn't feel comfortable and had the threat of hypertension in my pregnancy, but that was the only one I skipped.  The rest of the exercises got easier and more beneficial each time I did them.  I liked that they showed 2 other moms doing the exercises and one was modified for easier ways to do each pose.

The workout was a perfect length, not too long and not so short you wonder if you did anything.  There was a little bit of hippy-dippiness but nothing over-the-top.  I even liked the breathing part at the end where you visualize your baby and have a little meditation moment.

I would recommend this for anyone who wants a pretty easy intro to pre natal yoga and isn't looking for a major workout, just a way to work out the kinks.",1354924800,2,1301,4.344398340248962

2863014,5,B000R9YLIQ,"I read all the reviews on all the prenatal yoga dvds I could find and finally decided to try this one.  I'm glad I did because this one is exactly what I was looking for.  I had only been doing yoga for about 6 months before I got pregnant.  I've tried different kinds but my favorite kind is what I refer to as ""nice"" yoga.  Relaxing, stretching, breathing, meditative.  So that's what I was looking for and this fit the bill.  It has a nice pace and the instructor has a soothing voice that easily and clearly walks you thru each movement.  If you like the more energetic yoga with more challenging poses than this is probably not for you.

Just an update to say that I had my baby on May 4th.  It ended up being an emergency c-section (my second) but I was back on my feet fairly quickly.  I had a number of nurses comment on my leg and core strength and when I told them I'd been doing yoga they said that's what was really helping me out.  They were impressed and I was thankful that it helped me to feel better so much quicker.  (I didn't workout much at all with my first pregnancy and definitely wasn't as mobile as quickly.)

I am now doing the post-natal yoga and I love it just as much as I loved the pre-natal yoga.  She's still my favorite instructor.  I looked for other yoga videos by her but couldn't find any.

This presents a workout (nothing fancy, I'd say beginner's level) that is more about the yoga practice than it is about the pregenancy label.  So while there is an extremely pregnant woman to follow, very little of this is overly simplified catering service.  This program is reasonable, seems safe for a normal and healthy pregnancy, and keeps up at a good pace for a wonderful workout.  The post-natal workout is a little more intense, and even though I'm still pregnant, I'm impressed by it; it's nice to have a yoga DVD one can use for longer than 9 months.  The instructors carry no bells and whistles--it's relaxing to watch without getting too crunchy, and I finished this pregnancy-friendly program without feeling I was overworked but rather had an effective workout.",1346716800,,856,4.835616438356165

Different variants of poses are given so you can do what is comfortable for you.  I highly recommend this DVD. It is one of my favorites.,1336867200,,435,4.657894736842105
2863027,5,B000R9YLIQ,I bought this DVD during my 3rd pregnancy on first trimester and had been using it until I had the baby. This dvd is not hard to follow and it is very relaxing because it strengthens your muscles and soothes your mind. I have a lot of energy during my pregnancy using this dvd.

Now that I am pregnant I find myself reaching for this dvd more than anything else. The stretches help me avoid leg cramps and ease away all back pain. The prenatal workout is about 30 minutes long, perfect for even the busiest of moms. I have not tried the postnatal workout yet, as I am not there, but if it is anything like the prenatal it should be perfect. Not too hard.",1334361600,,499,4.319148936170213

It's not especially challenging - this isn't a DVD that gets your heart pumping.  But, it's great for stretching and relaxing, and I always feel great after completing it.  Some reviewers complained about how much the instructor talks, but that hasn't bothered me once!  Throughout each week, I rotate between this DVD, a sculpting prenatal DVD, and walking, which I feel like gives me a well-rounded prenatal workout routine.",1333756800,,587,4.83

It isn't a taxing workout by any means, but it has gotten more difficult as I have gotten further into my pregnancy (and larger!). The instructor moves at a relaxing, slow pace and has two other women to watch for alternative moves as you get into your third trimester.  Has been a perfect yoga solution for me.",1319068800,2,473,4.363636363636363
2863038,5,B000R9YLIQ,"I was hoping to find a more relaxing prenatal yoga program, but was delightfully surprised with this one. I really enjoy the yoga instructor and it is not a very difficult yoga workout. Plus, they show 2 other pregnant woman who use modifications of poses in case you are unable to do the full pose. The instructor also modifies almost all the poses so that a pregnant woman can do them. I have been doing yoga off and on now for 2 years and I didn't think this was too hard or too easy. It's right in the middle. There is also a postpartum workout for when after the baby is born but I am not due until January and so I haven't tried it yet. The total workout itself is only about 30 minutes, which I find very convenient. But like I said, it is not the relaxing meditation yoga, it's definitely more on the workout side. Most all of the poses she uses, both my doctor and doula recommended in order to prepare the body for childbirth. So this DVD is lined right up with what really does work best for your pregnant body. I absolutely love it and would definitely buy another yoga DVD with this instructor.",1317340800,2,1107,4.276190476190476

2863041,4,B000R9YLIQ,"I have done yoga on and off for 2 years, using DVDs and going to a studio.  I feel like I have moderate knowledge of the practice and experience with many poses.  I was looking for a moderate yoga DVD (not too difficult, not too easy) to start in my second trimester.

I bought two DVDs for prenatal yoga, Yoga Pregnancy and Elements Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga.  I'll review both as a comparison.

1. Yoga Pregnancy - I enjoyed this DVD as a reintroduction to the practice and it was easy enough that any novice can follow along.  I appreciated that there was no voiceover (they can be annoying) and Heather was giving direction in the studio.  I love that there was a model for each trimester so I could follow exactly with the modifications I needed.  The 30-minute practice was the perfect length of time and I appreciated that she touched on Kegel exercises, although they are harder to do while in a squat.  It was a little slower paced and only touched on some yoga poses that build strength, which made the DVD lacking for my needs.  Because this DVD focuses mostly on stretching, I would enjoy it on days that I'm lacking energy (or motivation) or perhaps later on in my third trimester.

2. Elements Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga - I enjoyed this DVD much more that Yoga Pregnancy.  It was moderately paced, a perfect 30 minutes in length, and was more of an actual yoga practice that I am used to.  Elena looked to be toward the end of her second trimester (maybe beginning third!)  and the modifications for yoga poses felt perfect for my body.  There was a voiceover for guidance, but it wasn't annoying like previous ones I have encountered.  I appreciated that there were enough poses to build strength and they flowed well together.  The practice ended with enough stretching for the time allowed.  I would have liked to see a model for each trimester, but I managed without it.",1311379200,42,1888,4.551928783382789
2863042,5,B000R9YLIQ,"Okay, I admit it...the title almost got me...not to watch the DVD.  It just struck me as a bit....boring?  I finally watched the DVD not expecting much.  I am so glad I tried it! Her instruction and talking through the moves is almost hypnotic.  I own many yoga DVD's including Prenatal Yoga with S. Rea.  As good as that one is...I loved this one more.  It feels like a personal studio session.  You feel like she's talking directly to you and her teaching and breath work is exact and applicable.  Even though I have done alot of yoga, I still learned things from her on this DVD.  My gain for watching it and I encourage anyone else to do so as well ;).",1309996800,,656,4.2682926829268295
2863043,4,B000R9YLIQ,"I bought this dvd after reviewing a number of others on Amazon & thought this one seemed the most yoga-newbie friendly. I've never done yoga before, but at the recommendation of my ob-gyn who said it would help with my stress level, I wanted to give it a shot.
This dvd is very friendly to a person who's never tried it before. Truthfully, I thought it was a little slow & that's coming from someone who's never done it. It may be way too slow for those with a little more experience. But I liked the way the instructor easily transitioned from one pose to another & was very reassuring. Only do what's comfortable for you. It was nice to see one of the other women in her 3rd trimester doing modified poses. I'm only 6 months, but I often looked to her as I'm not quite as flexible with some of the movements.

All in all, I thought this was a great introduction to yoga & look forward to doing it again. It's not so easy with an energetic 2 year old running around, but I'll find a way to make it work! :)",1305158400,3,1007,4.164102564102564

I needed something a bit more centering and challenging.  I absolutely LOVE Perfect Pregnancy Workout Vol. 1.

I am looking for a video that is a little more challenging but I think this one is great and I will keep it in my routine as my pregnancy progresses. I also this the postnatal will be great once I start slowly getting back into shape!

2863055,4,B000R9YLIQ,"This is the second yoga DVD I've ever used, and I like it a lot. The stretches are gentle and easy to follow, and I appreciate that there's always one person who shows the gentler version of each stretch for third trimester or immediately postnatal women. This is not for people looking to sweat. But you do feel more awake and balanced by the end.

My only quibble, which I found with the other DVD I've used, too, is that I'd like the instructor to hold some poses a bit longer. But I guess they're trying to keep to the 30-minute thing. My husband suggested playing this on slow motion... hmmm...

I enjoyed this during my pregnancy, but what I really appreciate is the postnatal part. Sadly, my pregnancy ended early, at 7 months. I want to get back in shape but I was worried it would be hard to find a workout that didn't emphasize -- or even include -- babies. This postnatal yoga sequence focuses on the woman, with only one passing mention of 'pushing a stroller'.

There aren't many resources for women who are post partum with no baby, so I did want to mention it in this review.",1298592000,30,1090,4.3861386138613865

It's my first baby, so I want to prepare as much as possible for labor, delivery, and post-partum--mentally as well as physically.  I'm no Olympic athlete, but before my pregnancy I was into running, yoga, Pilates, a little bit of weight training.  Now my focus is shifting to mostly yoga and a lot of walking, not just because it helps my physically, but because I need to be able to calm myself and find some true relaxation when I'm going to need it.  I purchased this and Shiva Rea's prenatal yoga workout, and as much as I like Shiva's calming voice, I liked this workout a little better.  It's shorter, but the instructor guides you through every move, and seems to know exactly what you're feeling as you do it.  I try to do yoga within a half hour of waking up in the morning, and within minutes of starting, I can feel aches and soreness (that I didn't even know I had) start to fade.  This is a really good option if you want to be able to practice yoga on your own schedule.  (Disclaimer:  I haven't done the post-natal workout section yet!)",1298073600,2,1113,4.364077669902913

I've done yoga here and there in the past, but am not a regular to it my any means.  Plus, my first 18 weeks or so of pregnancy were pretty tough with lots of sickness so any exercise was few and far between, but I knew that I needed to get on an exercise program to help me through the rest of pregnancy.  This DVD ended up being perfect for me.  It's a quick 30 minutes, no worries that I'm doing anything that might hurt baby and I feel a great burst of energy afterward, which is a welcome change from my earlier pregnancy.

I felt really well stretched out by the end of the video, and quite calm, just the way a prenatal yoga video should make you feel.

It's true that this workout will not raise your heartrate much. The poses are more for strength or flexibility building. I always feel great after and that's what keeps me coming back to the DVD day after day.

I feel energized afterwards instead of run down and out of breath (the last video I bought was for a much more experienced person).  It's also only 30 minutes long, which lets me sneak in the workout while working full time and taking care of my family.",1239667200,3,351,4.223880597014926
2863094,4,B000R9YLIQ,"It is a good video. But I feel a little disappointed. I do not feel it is made for pregnant women specially. There are only a few movement about the pregnancy, not enough.",1239235200,,171,4.212121212121212
2863095,5,B000R9YLIQ,"I did yoga for stretching and relaxation fairly often before becoming pregnant. Once my doctor discouraged my regular yoga class, I decided to try a prenatal video. This is one of several I've tried and by far my favorite. It is only 30 minutes but still feels like a good yoga workout - you feel relaxed, flexible and centered at the end, not sweaty or exhausted. The queing is good and I find Heather's voice relaxing. There's also a postnatal workout on the dvd that I plan to put to use in a few months.",1236556800,,507,4.347368421052631
2863096,5,B000R9YLIQ,"This is my second pregnancy and I am definitely out of shape. This video makes me feel like I can get exercise back into my life. I felt great after doing just one workout. It was very relaxing and the stretches were just right for being pregnant. the 30 minute routine is also a wonderful thing, because its easy to fit into my schedule. I highly recommend this video!",1232236800,,369,4.36231884057971

Im 8 months now & got the video about 1 1/2 ago, along with pre-natal yoga classes I do once a week, I do this video 2-3 times in addition, and find it extremely helpful in loosening up tight muscles and especially the hips!!! Its only 30 minutes which I like esp when you just need a quick relaxation and stretch! I recommend it for all prego moms out there !",1231200000,,381,4.093333333333334
2863098,5,B000R9YLIQ,This is the only video that I really loved doing while I was pregnate.  It is easy to follow and not too difficult for a beginner or intermediate.  I plan on using it again for the next one or loaning it out to other moms in the area.,1228262400,,234,3.8541666666666665
2863099,5,B000R9YLIQ,"This is my favorite workout in my third trimester.  It keeps me feeling good.  I attribute this workout and the others I do to the reason I am still so mobile and able to do things almost like I usually do. It completely loosens everything up.  Say goodbye to backaches and all those other pregnancy aches. I really like the prenatal modification for sun salutations, it is much more effective than the versions on my other workouts.  This is a little slow for first and second tri if you usually exercise.  If you want a more challenging 1st and 2nd tri workout try Kira Landgolf's Total Body Tone or Erin O'Brian's Prenatal Fitness Fix.  I learned the hard way to stick with prenatal workouts in pregnancy, regardless of how good you may feel.  I tore a muscle from overdoing (tricked by the relaxin I guess) during a regular workout.  It took over a month to heal.  I haven't tried the postnatal workout yet, I'll add a review when I get to that point.  This DVD was very worth it.  Other good prenatal workouts include Shiva Rea's prenatal yoga and Crunch Yoga Mama.  They are good quality, I used them during both of my pregnancies. If you are an experienced exerciser, they are really best for third tri.  Try the ones I recommended above for the earlier days or just go for brisk walks (Leslie Sansone's walking workouts have been great too!)",1226793600,8,1349,4.547717842323651
2863100,2,B000R9YLIQ,"I bought this in my 3rd trimester and only did it once.  I am a big workout DVD fan but this just didn't do it for me.  It was boring and I found it to be of poor quality and a little too ""fruity"" for my liking.",1226534400,3,211,3.4680851063829787

2863103,3,B000R9YLIQ,"This did not feel like a workout to me at all. It felt like a really good stretch.

2863105,5,B000R9YLIQ,"Let me be honest. I'm not a huge fan of exercise, and it's hard to make myself do it. I'm overweight and out of shape. But I actually really enjoy this DVD.

The instructor is very positive and soothing. She emphasizes positive thinking and not judging yourself.

I can manage almost all of the movements in the pre-natal workout without problems (can't do a few of the deep-knee-bend movements because of bad knees). However, it's just challenging enough that I really feel the stretch. I feel extremely energized after finishing.

This might be too easy for someone extremely fit. For the rest of us, it's a great disc.",1209168000,19,621,4.731481481481482

It is a great mix of beginner and moderate poses in an easy 30 minute time period.  Focuses on stretching, balance and core strength.  This video would be great for whatever your yoga experience is.

It's a quick and relaxing way to stretch and maintain my flexibility during this pregnancy.  It's not much of a workout (you won't be sweating or breathing heavy) but that's not what I was looking for.

I also have gestational diabetes and that makes it hard for me to do long workouts.  This DVD was a comfortable 30 minutes.  And I was happy with all of the common yoga forms I could still accomplish with my big belly.  This is not a vigorous workout, but I was still happy with the results.  I did not feel strained or stressed.  I loved it!",1204761600,2,441,4.141176470588236

So, yoga's not my usual thing but this is good for beginners to the concept of yoga without being too physically easy (not that it's too tough).  I also like that the workout is only about 30 min.  I already have a 3 year old and a long work day so getting it all in without chanting and meditating is perfect for me.",1204588800,7,398,4.012658227848101

The leg exercises not only helped while doing the video, but I used them later while laying in bed to ward off leg cramps and haven't had a single one since using them. I have not quite delivered yet, but am still able to do the workout in my 8th month. I am looking forward to trying out the postnatal workout to get back in shape and using some of the techniques during childbirth.

The instructor, Heather Seiniger, has a soothing manner and keeps the class moving along nicely. There is a good, logical flow between the postures.

The sequencing is approximately as follows:
10 minutes of warm-ups: side stretch, gentle twist, cat/cow, plank, downward dog, child's pose
Squats and prenatal sun salutes
Tree pose
Standing poses: warrior II, extended side angle
More squats
Side stretch, gentle twist and savasana (final relaxation)

Honestly, my back and hips have never felt better and I am a week shy of 9 months pregnant! I also would recommend buying a prenatal pilates DVD to go along with this yoga DVD. Its called ""10 minute Solution Prenatal Pilates.""
