8560620,5,B008VF14G0,"This is a tremendous journey through almost the entire Schubert sonata works, even three ""earlier""ones (as if anything involving Schubert could be called ""late""). For anyone looking to compare this set with Brendel's filmed versions from the mid '70's, three  sonatas are included only in this set (D 537, D 575, and D 664) plus the Hungarian Melody D 817, whereas Brendel includes non-sonata pieces (impromtus & klavierstucke, Moments Musicaux, and Wanderer fantasy). The introductory comments in both sets are wonderful and each has its own point of view, so they are hardly redundant. The same can be said about the performances - you will want to have both if you love this music, as clearly both performers do, and the experiences of each make their own impressions. Shapiro adds introductory remarks about Schubert and his music that provides an informative and insightful context for these works. The recording and video quality is excellent. Sit back and enjoy!",1453075200,,969,5.132911392405063
8560621,5,B008VF14G0,Daniel Shapiro was my teacher when I was a student at the Cleveland Institute of Music. He is a great musician and able to play all Beethoven and Schubert Piano Sonatas. Watching this set of DVDs reminds of the years of studying with him. The performance and the commenteries on this set of DVDs are really fascinating.,1350172800,,319,4.614035087719298
