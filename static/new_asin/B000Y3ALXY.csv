3011619,4,B000Y3ALXY,"The Way I Spent the End of the World (not a title to roll off the tongue) is a lovely little film with its heart in the right place. It's about the lives of high-school kids just before the overthrow of Communism in 1989 Romania. These kids want to get on with life only they are surrounded by a crazy sense of censorship and they lack a connection to the outside world so they decide to look for a way out. The idea is that they want to swim across the Danube (like many did in real life). Doroteea Petre convincingly plays the role of the central character, a girl who's looking for more.

The recent interest in Romanian cinema has meant that films like The Way I Spent the End of the World are now available to an English-speaking audience. It shows a general quality in Romanian film-making. I would say it's an honest type of film-making, willing to show the day to day lives of real people and their situations. Although not a visionary piece (such as 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days or The Death of Mr Lazarescu) The Way I Spent the End of the World comes recommended if you're in the mood for original, heartfelt cinema.

3011620,5,B000Y3ALXY,"This film is beautifully made. With just a small understanding of Communist Romania, a viewer can really enjoy the creativity in telling this story. The main character is a strong heroine, but the characters around her add a lot of entertainment and give ground for reflection. I like that the film focuses on a neighborhood with its share of normal problems, while in the background communist control is falling apart.",1200182400,22,419,5.0

8230840,5,B000Y3ALXY,Another great Romanian movie. Tough and hard to watch at time but true and real.,1470787200,,80,4.4
8230841,5,B000Y3ALXY,"An interesting tale of life under a dictatorship as seen through the eyes of a pair of siblings; the older being punished for accidentally damaging the bust of the dictator and her attempts to get away from this dictatorial rule by crossing the Danube and the younger simply too young to understand the realities and complexities of the situation but old enough to realize that the problems he sees concerning his sister and others must be the fault of this evil man. So little Lali got some of his friends together and schemes a way in their imaginary minds how they can put an end to this man. Fortunately Ceausescu's dictatorial reign came to an end, and with little Lali narrating we begin to see him and his sister entering a new ""world"", a world that has no fear; a world of peace and harmony.",1461715200,,799,4.517241379310345
8230842,5,B000Y3ALXY,"The Romanian New Wave is arguably the most significant wave or movement in all of world cinema since the French New Wave due in no small part to Catalin Mitulescus sublime first feature, The Way I Spent the End of the World, which did not garner as many accolades as The Death of Mr. Lazarescu or 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days but was equally instrumental in affirming Romania as a premiere incubator of formidable young talent. Mitulescus film immerses the viewer in communist-era Romania even more thoroughly than the aforementioned masterworks and with lighthearted tone rare among the films that belong to the new wave. Unlike the two aforementioned masterworks, it is not exhausting and bleak. 17-year olds Eva and Andre ambitiously intend to swim across the Black Sea to Yugoslavia and out of the dictatorships clutches upon killing the dictator, Nicolae Ceasescu, when he visits their school to see the choir sing in his honor. The Way I Spent the End of the World is the most entertaining of all the new wave films, effervescent and even at times dreamlike in the teenagers fantastical notions that drive their stories. Like the films of Cristi Puiu and Cristian Mungiu it frequently employs long takes and a more realist aesthetic that neatly complements the teens outrageous plans. The Romanian New Wave is much more than the towering works of Puiu and Mungiu that took top prizes at the Cannes Film Festival; understanding the Romanian New Wave and concurrently contemporary European cinema, of which Romania was not a part of until 2001 (a white spot on the map of world cinema), renders The Way I Spent the End of the World an essential title.",1414368000,,1655,4.830985915492958
8230843,3,B000Y3ALXY,That's for sure. The movie was a bit all over the place though. It portrayed real Romanian life and real event during Ceausescu's fall but the plot was a little hard to follow with no real point. I still enjoyed it but I wouldn't say it's GREAT.,1394150400,,245,4.23404255319149
8230844,5,B000Y3ALXY,Enjoyed this realistic movie. A piece of Romanian history with its dark communist past.  Great details and acting! Must see movie!,1390348800,,130,5.190476190476191
8230845,5,B000Y3ALXY,The colors on the instant video are muted and rather dark.  There is very little contrast and should have a button on the unbox to make a sharper image and give the movie more contrast.  Otherwise the movie is fine.,1373414400,,215,4.35
8230846,5,B000Y3ALXY,"Set in 1989 Bucharest the film transfers us to the last year of Ceausescu's dictatorship.
17-year-old Eva and her boyfriend accidentally break a bust of Ceausescu at school and after confessing their 'crime', Eva is expelled. She's continuing her studies in a special 'reformatory' institution where she meets Andrei. Together they decide to escape the hostile Romania. Finding out about this plan, Eva's younger brother Lalalilu blaims Ceausescu for taking away his sister and makes his own plan of revenge.

This is a very heartwarming and passionate first feature from Romanian writer/director Catalin Mitulescu. It's a personal story, that doesn't focus on the life under communist regime, but rather gives an insightful and intelligent portrait of the turbulences of one family' life.",1294099200,4,789,5.467213114754099
