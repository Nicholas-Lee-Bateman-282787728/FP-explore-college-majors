8275822,1,B001A33ZI0,I do like that the video is 16:9. If the audio would have been 5.1 surround sound then I could have said something else good about this movie.,1518998400,,142,4.107142857142857
8275823,1,B001A33ZI0,Jake Bucey is an accomplished actor and deserves better roles. I however dislike movies - books that jump back and forth . so thumbs down on this one.,1504742400,,150,4.392857142857143
8275824,2,B001A33ZI0,"This would have been a fine, creative essay on war, grief and PTSD, if it weren't for the stupid ""mad scientist"" plot device that screams that the writer and director had no faith at all in their ability to craft a fine, creative essay on war, grief and PTSD.

The production values are mid to high, though, and Jake Busey, while creepily looking exactly like his father circa 1975, has a greater acting range than papa has displayed in his later, regrettable ""Gingerdead Man"" career.

Here, Jake turns out a sensitive, yet fearless performance reminiscent of ""Big Wednesday""-era Gary, and it's a pleasure to watch.

Just wish he were given a better movie to perform in.",1381536000,,670,4.758620689655173
8275825,3,B001A33ZI0,"3 of 5 stars for the high-speed suspense movie Time Bomb. This movie starts off fast, in fact, I thought I was starting near the end as things were crazy. The plot centers on terrorists who have planted time bombs around a football stadium set to go off at the end of a big game. Up front, these terrorists take over a bar and set a bomb to kill all those inside. The story follows the bomb squad and an FBI detective. Of course, the guys wife and kid are at the stadium and of course the bad guys are somehow able to watch his every move.

This is a high speed movie that never stops with the action or suspense. Frankly it is a bit tiring. There really is no let-down during the story; it just keeps coming at you. There are plot twists but they are predictable and the plot surprises are guessable. So this is a good movie, but, not a great movie. I do recommend it.",1261353600,,869,4.1117647058823525
8275826,1,B001A33ZI0,go to a ballet with my wife than sit through this train wreck again.  I can't decide what was worse the plot or the incredibly horrible acting.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie like the plague.,1215043200,3,202,4.2894736842105265
