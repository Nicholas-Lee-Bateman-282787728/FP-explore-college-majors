2654426,5,B000ICLRL6,"Do you love it? I sure do. Nicole and Paris are so adorable, they play stupid really well. I could watch these episodes all day! ""Do you have any gerbils?"" -Nicole! That has to be my favorite line ever! Loves it!!!",1164758400,6,214,4.2439024390243905
2654427,4,B000ICLRL6,I am huge fan of SIMPLE LIFE. I will have to say they make idiots of themselves and make you laugh! This season is not as funny since they are not working together. When they work together they feed off of each other humor and stupidity.......Some of the smallest tasks they are given they turn into the biggest things. Then there are others that I would never have thought of adapting to. I will still add SIMPLE LIFE Season 4 to the collection of 1-3. These are things you can watch over and over and laugh as if you have never seen them before!!! Nicole needs her own TV show!!!!!,1161820800,6,583,4.3090909090909095

2654471,3,B000ICLRL6,this one wasn't my favorite. in this season paris and nicole are enemies at the moment and so they take on households one at a time to prove who's better or whatever..I personally think it would have been more entertaining to watch them in the same house together at the same time competing.,1385596800,,291,4.509433962264151
2654472,5,B000ICLRL6,"This season splits the girls up due to a dispute that had (which I have yet to figure out). They take turns being a housewife in different cultures and lifestyles. They are put in binds that the every day person goes through like getting kids dressed for school, making dinner, child's birthday party, and trying to pencil in a vacation which they have never done before. I like this season due to the different concept the girls come up with rather than traveling across the nation in a truck (Season 1), work enough hours so they can get to the next milestone (Season 2), or even trying their hand at being interns (Season 3).

I highly recommend getting this season if you love the show and see how they can mess up such a simple task.",1371513600,,738,4.426470588235294
2654473,4,B000ICLRL6,"I love love love the simple life! This season is my least favorite, because the girls are feuding, but it still is incredibly hilarious and worth the buy!",1370649600,,154,4.535714285714286

2654475,5,B000ICLRL6,"This is my favorite season of the series. When the series began Paris was touted as the  star and Nicole her sidekick.  However, episode after episode, season after season, Richie with her dry, sarcastic sense of humor, her blunt delivery, and her evolving style(and appearance) upstaged Hilton becoming the star. Richie, now a married mother of two, is a successful author, desinger, and Fashion Star mentor",1360886400,,408,5.166666666666667
2654476,5,B000ICLRL6,"This show is funny if you are not looking for mental stimulation and just want some mindless fun.  I don't take it too seriously, good for some laughs.",1356652800,,151,4.392857142857143
2654477,5,B000ICLRL6,One of the funniest videos I have ever seen. A must have for anyone that likes a good laugh. Get all 5 seasons and enjoy. For being non professional woman Paris & Nicole are up there with the best of natural comidians. Buy without regret and enjoy.,1354838400,,248,4.297872340425532
2654488,4,B000ICLRL6,"I've seen the first 2 episodes of this show and so far it's a real surprise. I never liked Road Rules, so I went into it a little apprehensive considering the two shows share some creative blood. Plus, the girls (especially Hilton) are really fun to look at.",1341100800,,258,4.395833333333333

2654490,5,B000ICLRL6,Young and inexperienced wealthy socialites that are put into a homemaking situation and mess everything up. Perfect for a person who loves pointless reality entertainment Tv! I really enjoy watching Nicole Richie make a disaster of things. Very entertaining!,1297036800,,258,5.641025641025641
2654491,1,B000ICLRL6,"With the exception of 'The Simple Life Goes To Camp', I've seen every season of the show, so I feel pretty confident when I say that this was, by far, the worst season out of all of 'em. Not only was it unbearable to watch, but quite insulting as well. Insulting to the families - many of whom were minorities - and insulting to the viewers that E! obviously counted on to watch and buy what they were seeing. It's easily the worst season of anything they've ever broadcast and how it managed to survive for all 10 episodes without getting cancelled is beyond me.

For this season of the show the girls took turns playing housewife to a different family each week. Typical chores included cooking, cleaning, looking after the little ones and keeping an eye on the husbands. But what overshadowed everything was the fact that Paris and Nicole were locked in a nasty feud with each other. Since the two weren't talking, they refused to appear onscreen together. (They do briefly share the screen in the first and last episode, but even then all they do is sling insults at one another and glare at each other with blank, hateful eyes.) To get around this technical difficulty the producers used split-screens to show each girl arriving at the house and greeting the family, before switching back and forth between Paris' week and Nicole's week with the family. There were so many split-screens I felt like I was watching a DePalma movie. Out of the 10 families only 2 really stood out. The first one was about a lush of a husband (who bore a passing resemblance to Ray Winstone) who actually called himself ""Captain Tequila"". While Nicole was quite eager to pour him shot after shot, Paris wanted to focus on his other hobbies, which included golf. While at the club, Paris begs him to buy her a pink golf bag that cost $3,977. After he does, she promptly ruins it by driving their golf cart into a lake. During Nicole's week, she convinces the husband to make a sexy calendar for his wife. Good ol' Tequila is only too happy to strip down and pose for 12 provocative shots. It's pretty funny actually and easily ranks as the best episode of the season. The second best features a prissy husband with a voice that rivals Richard Simmons. He's an OCD freak who demands an immaculate house and who has no qualms telling people off when they don't live up to his high standards. There's far too much dumb Paris stuff in the episode like her overflowing the washng machine and using a leaf blower to get rid of the excess bubbles or smashing all kinds of breakables in a futile effort to kill a cockroach. She does have one funny moment - in a strictly sadistic way - when she falls off a Segway after getting the bright idea to drive it over a freshly scrubbed floor. The real highlight of the episode comes when Nicole takes the family to a clothing store and gives them all makeovers. She dresses the dad up as a pirate and, given his effeminate mannerisms, it's one of those things you have to see for yourself to truly appreciate how funny it is. These were the only 2 episodes I found enjoyable. The other 8 are too outrageous to get into. The most offensive moment came when Paris, babysitting a Mexican family, took the kids to her mansion without telling their parents. Along with her aunt (who's just as rude), Paris watches as the kids raid her closets and swim in her pool. When the worried parents finally track down their kids and come to pick them up, Paris and her aunt actually laugh in their faces. This is only one of the many instances throughout the season where Paris proves just how vapid, talentless and rude she actually is. For one thing she speaks in her annoying baby voice the ENTIRE time. Also, she seems like she was already rocking the nose candy. There are 2 scenes in particular (one featuring Three 6 Mafia) where she seems under the influence. Maybe Nicole had the right idea ditching her because nobody should have to put up with her despicable behavior just because she's rich and famous. Plus, she has gross hands. Unfortunately, Nicole doesn't look all that great either since this was during her emaciated frame time. Even though she's painfully frail, she proves once again how witty and lightning quick she is. She provides all the laughs this season through an endless supply of one-liners. Being freed from Paris may have been the best thing that ever happened to her since she seems more relaxed and confident enough to reveal more of herself than on any other season. Many of the families agree that she'll make a great mother one day. It speaks volumes for Nicole that she's settled down in a committed relationship and become a mother twice over while Paris is still sleeping around and getting busted for possession in a desperate attempt to remain in the spotlight.

A month ago I wrote a glowing review of Season 3 claiming it showed a different side of Paris. I singled her out instead of complimenting Nicole enough. I wanted to correct that and this season did it for me. Paris reverted back to her old ways and Nicole finally claimed the spotlight she's rightfully deserved this whole time. The only incentive I have to watch Season 5 is to see how the ridiculous cliffhanger ending from this season gets resolved. It doesn't seem worth it. Just stick with the first 3 seasons and divorce yourself from this one entirely. Truly disappointing.",1289088000,5,5392,4.598130841121495

2654493,3,B000ICLRL6,"...as stupid does. Of course I have no idea if these girls are truly dumb, but if I had to base my opinion on these movies I'd have to say 'yes'. That being said, the series is pretty entertaining. I find amazing the way these girls treat people, the people who open up their homes to them and just folk in general. They act like teen age kids who have had no direction or parental influence in their lives. Just because you are extremely well to do does not mean that you should not have basic manners or social skills. I understand that this series is meant as entertainment and not really a look at the girls 'real' lives, but it sure serves as a clue what those lives must be like. And hey, if I inherited a ton of money, who's to say I wouldn't become just as irresponsible? I will note that in the later series, the girls often gifted the families they stayed with with some pretty nice stuff, so I suppose all is not lost. So, 3 stars for entertainment, -2 for embarrassment suffered while watching.",1219968000,,1006,4.3
2654494,3,B000ICLRL6,"I must say first off that I gave this season 3 stars because it is definately worth watching and owning if you are a fan of the show, BUT if I was rating it against the other seasons I would have to give it 2 stars.  Was it the fued between the girls that brought this season down?  Was it that the show was picked up by E! and left Fox?  Was it that this season seems to start to make the girls shananagans a little scripted?  I'm not sure, but it's still Paris and Nichole and they are still making me laugh, a little.  Can't help but love 'em.",1207612800,,546,3.9272727272727272
2654495,5,B000ICLRL6,"New elements have been added into this latest season 5, they are selling their inner heart, caring, to me this is done in order to show the other side of the girls, forget about the party animal, the drink and drive or the jail things, they are back with the brand new images and new way of works thing out, no matter what is the true reason behind, just enjoy the show.",1202774400,,370,4.152777777777778

2654497,3,B000ICLRL6,"Admit it - people who watch this TV show is to watch Paris, it is just simply the fact!

It is definitely not a smart TV show in terms of the contents, but we sometimes just like to watch a stupid show, why not? As long as we are just the watchers who can have a great laugh, rather than the actors who have line of problems due to behaving dumb!",1200700800,,346,3.8732394366197185

2654514,3,B000ICLRL6,"This DVD gives a good laugh to all ages, young or old. But it has no meaning to it, really. This meaningless humour is what keeps people wanting more and more. No one will get enough of them :)",1178496000,,193,3.9743589743589745
2654515,4,B000ICLRL6,"I'll admit it.  I have watched every season of ""The Simple Life"" since the show's premier on FOX several summers ago.  I wasn't going to watch the show, but thanks to the no-mans-land of repeats I found myself watching the premier with my mother one evening, and the strangest thing happened: neither of could stop laughing!  We watched the entire season cracking up and actually looking forward to the next mis-adventure.  The following summer with the double-long ""Road Trip"" season the same thing happened.  I don't know how or why but we found this wildly entertaining.  Although by season three it was more of the same and things started to get stale.

While people critisize this season because the girls are rarely together, that is the part I liked the best.  You were able to compare and contrast the girls two vastly different styles and wild-scheme.  The Simple Life 4 is by no means appointment, or even ""good"" TV, but it is a very worthy waste of several hours one afternoon.",1178496000,3,988,4.730994152046784
2654516,1,B000ICLRL6,"the 4th season is a complete disappointment. but, wait till next season. when paris is sentanced to 45 days in jail, she turns to her lawyer and asks, 'is that a place that sells ale ??' then we get episodes of 45 days and nights in a california 'spa cupcake' with color tv, air conditioning, low-fat no added salt chicken diet, paris drinking her first cup of jail brewed 'buck', and nicole visiting. then again, the judge should have sent paris to the arizona maricopa county tent jail. the episodes of paris working different jobs on the 'chain-gang' would be much more entertaining, especially with nicole crusing by in a limo.",1178236800,5,631,4.693693693693693

2654518,1,B000ICLRL6,"Being a loyal fan of the twosome, and the entire series, I thought it obvious to purchase the fourth season.
