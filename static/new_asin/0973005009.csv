179811,3,0973005009,"There are some good moments in this DVD.  It's intresting watching the ""four horsemen"" of the sasquatch hunt (Rene Dahinden, John Green, Grover Krantz, Peter Byrne) in interviews and puzzling how none of them get along anymore. Mostly I was disapointed by the extra features on the DVD and the way the producers were subtly poking fun at the subject.  All the DVD extras consisted of were opinions on the patterson footage by hollywood make-up artists, not educated scientists or anthropologists.  Also, I had read somewhere this DVD contained the complete patterson film, enhanced and uncut. This is not the case.  You will only find snippets of the footage throughout the feature as in many other bigfoot documentaries.",1114732800,12,721,5.084745762711864
179812,5,0973005009,"I bought this  when it was released on video tape and have watched it at least 10 times. This is an excellent documentary that places it's focus, not so much on bigfoot, but on the people who have made a name searching for it. At times it is humorous (especially the segments with Rene Dahinden), and at others times very serious. It shows the directions the four ""old men"" of bigfoot search and research have taken since working together as young men, and the contempt they seem to have for each other now. I found myself feeling sorry for the men when they realize they are getting old and have never seen bigfoot and probably will not live to see it. But it is encouraging to see younger people take up the search in an attempt to carry on.

I, for one, am a believer and hope that one day proof positive is presented to the sceptical world, but at the same time I hope bigfoot is left right where he is. One of the viewpoints brought up is that bigfoot does not have to be shot and the body dragged in for us to realize he exists and always has been out there.

This is a great bigfoot film, and you should buy it, if you're interested.",1114646400,25,1140,4.220183486238532
179813,5,0973005009,"I saw this documentary originally on video, presented as the original 70-minute documentary shown on television. This DVD, while it presents the original documentary, also has new segments, such as 3 short vignettes with Stan Winston (""Aliens"", ""Terminator 2"") with him commenting that the Patterson/Gimlin film is most likely a brilliant hoax. There's a new question-and-answer segment with Bigfoot researcher Richard Noll in which he discusses his thoughts on Bigfoot and the Bigfoot field in general. It also shows him in the field finding a set of tracks. There is also a photo gallery featuring the four principles of the documentary. This documentary features the story of the four Grand Old Men of Bigfootery, John Green, Rene Dahinden, Peter Byrne and Grover Krantz, featuring rare classic footage of each man, which tells the story of each man's quest to find the Sasquatch. Two of the men (Krantz and Dahinden) have passed on since the filming of the documentary, but of the four, only Green continues to be semi-active in the hunt. Byrne is semi-retired and largely out of the public spotlight. This documentary is highly recommended for those who want to know more about the personalities in the field of Bigfoot research.",1104969600,3,1234,5.1138613861386135
179814,5,0973005009,"Sasquatch Odyssey is the best documentary ever made about the lives, times and personalites of those four most famous investigators in the sasquatch world. They are Rene Dahinden, John Green, Grover Krantz and Peter Byrne. Sasquatch Odyssey is a must-own for anyone who wants to understand the proposed scientific basis for the existence of this animal.

Director Peter von Puttkamer has documented an aspect of sasquatch research that is seldom seen in other documentaries. While there is a large and healthy dose about sasquatches themselves, much of this fascinating documentary is a look at what made the socalled ""Four Horsemen of Sasquatchery"" click. Each individual investigator is given an opportunity to candidly speak their mind about their own perspectives in the world of sasquatch. This is a trememdously interesting and absorbing exercise as it allows the viewer to see what truly makes these men tick.

There is also a healthy dose of skepticism and exploration of alternative viewpoints on the likely or unlikely existence of sasquatch.

Also included in this premier DVD is perhaps the clearest and most vivid footage of the Patterson/Gimlin film from October 20, 1967. This particular version of the film is brilliant in colour, contrast and detail and is must for anyone seriously interested in seeing the incredible anatomy and musculature of the unknown cryptid depicted in this seminal footage.

Having seen the original 48 minute version of the documentary, I was very pleased that the new 70 minute version is even more absorbing. The other extras such as the photo gallery, interviews with a well-known skeptical special effects and costumer, as well as a questions and answers segment with Rick Noll, one of the leading lights in this generation of sasquatch researchers, make this DVD a must ahve for all who ahve a curiosity concerning the unknown bipedal hairy hominid that stalks the montane forests of North America.

I thoroughly recommend Sasquatch Odyssey to all who would harbour  a desire to come to know the subject of sasquatch more scientifically, intelligently and thoughtfully.

Two thumbs up!!

179821,5,0973005009,"An abundance of information collected throughout the years of researching sasquatch. The researchers are filled with character and knowledge. A must for any bigfoot enthusiast. I would like to add, however, watching this documentary and the 4 legendary Bigfoot researchers in action are priceless. Time has taken some of these researchers away and, even though new reseachers are on the up and rise so to speak, remember this....they are building on the big 4's (John Green, Rene Dehinden, Peter Byrne, John Bindernagel) informational research. They were researching when nobody else would listen!!!!!! Grover Krantz as well.

179822,5,0973005009,"This documentary perfectly captures the passion, humor, and animostiy of the main champions of Bigfoot in his modern form.  Rene Dahinden (now deceased) is his gruff, yet cheerful self as he gleefully explains why the other three ""elders"" have failed to produce definitive proof.  One gets the impression that for Dahinden, Bigfoot is primarily a vehicle to tear down people of percieved authority, while sticking up for the underdog.  He was a fascinating character, and one of the first to seriosuly hunt the legendary being.

Next is Peter Byrne, who treats the whole affair with quiet, bemused reservation. He entertains nerdy kids who want to study ""migration patterns"" and talk about Bigfoot living underground.  Hey, if it fosters an interest in the natural world among our increasingly sedentary, urban youngsters, more power to him.  Byrne seems to realize that there's probably no way he'll prove Bigfoot exists, so he's content to retell stories of yore and enjoy short excursions into the woods...nothing wrong with that.  Byrne seems like the best adjusted of the group.

John Greene, the Canadian journalist is on hand to explain why he's right and every single scientist in the world is simply a lazy, good-for-nothing, office-bound nay-sayer when it comes to Bigfoot.  He seems like a tired, bitter old guy who's sick of being ignored, or worse, mocked by those who don't take his every word as gospel when it comes to giant ape-men. Not the kind of guy you'd want to have over for dinner.

Finally, Grover Krantz (also deceased) is highlighted.  He refuses to acknowledge that footprints can be faked, films can be hoaxed, and maybe, just maybe he's not as smart as he thinks he is.  Dahinden exposes several faults in Krantz's previous analyses of evidence, but this doesn't phase Krantz in the least.  He's a kindly fellow, a bit gullible, and perhaps arrogant, but in the end, he's a tragic figure who died without seeing any of his theories even remotely supported by hard evidence.

The documentary also includes footage of various loonies, oddballs, kooks, and amateur enthusiasts in an amusing, and not at all mean-spirited send-up of the collage of personalities that is Bigfootery.  Overall, this doc is EXCELLENT!  Highly recommended for fans, believers, and skeptics alike.  You'll learn a LOT about the culture of Bigfootery and perhaps gain a bit more understanding of why it seems to thrive depite having very little material support for the hairry monster's existence to go on.

There are plenty of eyewitness accounts relived and a bit of comedy in the long journey over the years. For any new comers or seasoned Sasquatchers, I highly recommend this video. This DVD takes you from the early beginnings of the hunt in the Hemalayas in the 1950s, then the 1958 launch of bigfoot in the U.S. and the patterson film in 1967 to present day. This is a very good journey to take by all who maybe interested in the Bigfoot phenomena.",1217289600,,592,4.701923076923077

Bigfoot is not an ape but resides in the realm of the paranormal.
We've cataloged every single living thing down to the size of a microbe in North America. How does an 800 lbs. ape escape for so long without being cataloged. Surely we catalog microbes in the farthest reaches of the forest. When Bigfoot dies does it bury itself?This creature has been seen on the edges of major cities but has never fallen off of a ravine,never been hit by a car and killed,never had a heart attack.....never......
So we don't find dead bears?
Then why do we have dead bear bones?

179828,5,0973005009,"As other reviewers have noted, this humorous and entertaining documentary is less about the big guy and more about some of the personalities, most of which are quite familiar to those of us who have had an interest in this for very long, a little history of the search for evidence and the culture surrounding the mystery.

There are interesting interviews with John Green, Dr. Krantz, Peter Byrne and Rene Dahinden among others as well as with Rick Noll in a featurette.  What you won't find here is revealing new evidence supporting or refuting the existence of bigfoot although the veracity of the Patterson footage is again re-hashed by seemingly cursory examination of the film by effects artists and a brief summary of a scientific evaluation of the film.

My wife, who forces a nervous smile, avoids eye contact and slowly backs out of the room when she discovers her normally sane, intelligent, logical and pragmatic husband poring over his bigfoot ephemera like a fevered brain case, actually sat down to watch this and got a big hoot out of it.  So did I.

179830,4,0973005009,"As stated by others, this documentary is about two things - bigfoot and the four horsemen of sasquatchary (John Green, Rene Dahinden, Grover Krantz, & Peter Byrne). This is a well done piece, giving time to each of the four men. They talk about bigfoot and Dahinden tries to give an explanation of why the four of them didn't get along. Their in-fighting is amusing and their personalities come out here. Krantz the scientist, John Green the journalist, Dahinden the seemingly bitter every man, and Byrne the playboy hunter. Two of them are dead now (Krantz and Dahinden) and the other two (Green & Byrne) are getting on in years. Most amusing is how all four of them dismiss John Lesparitis as a dimwit regarding bigfoot.

Among other personalities in the show are Ray Crowe, Larry Lund, John Lesparitis, State Trooper Hastings, John Bindernagel (seen but never heard), Robert Pyle, newcomer Henry Franzoni, and Byrne disciple 15 year old Matt ""and stuff"" Dunlap among others. We also get FX designer Toby Lindala's input on the Patterson film creature. It's a good solid show for the subject matter.

Special Features for the dvd include a 10 minute segment on bigfoot background guy Richard Noll (now coming to the forefront as the Four Horsemen are departing us). Also are three brief opinion segments including FX designer Stan Winston and an old movie actor that impersonated gorillas.

Overall, very good show but more about the Big Four than Bigfoot.",1154304000,5,1458,4.91869918699187
179831,4,0973005009,"It's always good to see the comedy side of mostly serious topics, bigfoot being a fringe subject with not alot of lighthearted humor surrounding it. We believers take this subject seriously in an enjoyable way that lets us believe that there is still mystery in the world and we are not complete masters of the universe just yet. This dvd is very entertaining if not to informative and gives insight into the four men who started serious investigation into the bigfoot phenomenom. Bigfoot songs, excerpts from d-movies{pretty campy stuff}, and a host of interviews from real reseachers are not well edited together but it adds to the fun of dvd.

I disagree with another reviewer who described Green as a mean & bitter old man. Not so. (Rene Dahinden...kind of.) Still enjoyed seeing the old firecracker Dahinden in action.
Green, Dahinden, Krantz and Berne were the guys who spent years and years (and lots of money) studying and searching for the Big Guy. I gotta give them their props, although Berne is a too much of a dude for my taste. Hes the guy who liberated a yeti finger from the monastery in Nepal. In other words, he stole it after he had gained the trust of the monks there. Not nice. Bad karma.
