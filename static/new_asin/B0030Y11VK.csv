She finds 1, 2 or 3 songs which tie in with a lesson topic.  Many residents appreciate the variety of singers and their Christian witness.",1266883200,2,264,4.458333333333333
4047102,5,B0030Y11VK,"""Reunited"" is a continuation of ""Better Day"".  Filmed at the same concert.  They just broke up the concert into two videos.  Both are outstanding. No songs repeated.  ""Reunited"" has humor and great solos.",1266796800,10,204,5.090909090909091
4047103,4,B0030Y11VK,"I love the Gaither Vocal Band. However, I was disappointed with the ""Reunited"" CD, so I was leery of the DVD. Well, after watching it, the only thing similar to the CD was the title. Honestly, this DVD of a live concert was so wonderful in so many different ways. It will be a blessing to you.",1264723200,14,293,4.157894736842105

4047106,5,B0030Y11VK,of course its low budget but the acting is great and the message is SUPERB!! i recommend this movie to anyone wanting to watch something that doesnt have profanity and the usual garbage included in most relationship movies.

4047108,4,B0030Y11VK,"Pretty good movie about HIV/AIDS and the stigma the carriers relieve from people once they find out. Angel was believable, except when she was suppose to be crying and not a tear was to be found. I like the fact that the film gave factual information about the disease.

I would also like to point out that the music throughout the movie was great. Reading through the credits I saw that the same artists were used for different songs, I will have to look up some of them to download their songs later.",1486771200,,502,4.397849462365591

4047113,4,B0030Y11VK,Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It was obvious some of the acting needed a little polish but it did not detract from the film's thematic elements nor its deeply personal challenge issued to every viewer.  This is definitely a movie I'd watch again and pass along to someone else.  I hope Ms. Priscilla is able to continue to have opportunities to let her light shine and to produce additional films in the near future!  Hats off to her for this production!,1486166400,3,456,4.6625

4047178,5,B0030Y11VK,"Priscilla Adams wrote, produced and starred in the romantic movie about a couple who through a set of circumstances reunite.  I must say, this was a really nice straight to DVD movie that I could imagine making it big on the big screen.  I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't  viewed it but it is one of those feel good movies that keeps you thinking afterwards and makes for a good conversation.  The characters were believable and relatable.  I loved the songs/soundtrack and wish there was a CD included; songs I would definitely want on my playlist in heavy rotation.  Good R&B music that we don't get to hear to often, nowadays. So, hats off to you Ms. Adams for a job done exceptionally well!  And to all of the actors who starred in the movie - extraordinary cast!  I hope you continue to make wonderful, realistic movies for all to enjoy.  I will be spreading the word on you, younglady!",1476662400,,911,4.472727272727273

I already have David's music, but have since bought Michael English's CDs also. Thank you, Bill Gaither for bringing these great voices to us. The selection of songs were exceptional, also. If Amazon had a 10-star rating, I would give them it.",1281139200,5,391,4.850746268656716
4047311,5,B0030Y11VK,"Wonderful messages for this time in history. I really like this dvd. They individualize more than most singing groups, and yet when they harmonize that is top notch too. These guys are such pros.

For folks like me -who do not have a church these DVDs are wonderful ways of reminding ourselves that we too need food for the soul. Bill Gaither is a very special individual and deserves this feast, I say, and so do we. What a great group of wonderful, God-loving singers.

At first I thought I could do without this recording, but then I heard them on the Saturday Daystar program, and I bought both. I just wish I could send one to each of you, and send them a rainbow for the joy they bring. God bless us all, and help us remember who holds tomorrow.

While the film has it's heart in the right place, every other bit of dialogue feels like a poorly worded speech or a first draft of a script. The film's pacing also feels too stretched out even for 90 minutes. Better luck next time I'll say but it's also hard to believe this is distributed by Maverick Home Ent. given how this is a film way too easygoing for a studio that often pushes out ghetto, gangster or exploitation based garbage annually.",1505088000,,590,4.5233644859813085
