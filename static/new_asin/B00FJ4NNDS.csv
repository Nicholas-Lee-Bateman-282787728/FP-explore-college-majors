5993367,4,B00FJ4NNDS,"True to its message thru all lenght, yet not perfect because relied too much on deadbeat tropes instead of going deeper on the reasons why her life was meaningful when she had a family.

Milldy Spoilers ahead.

No Need to show her former manager shenanigans or her replacement.
No Need for medical subplots.
No Need to surprsie family show up.
Just more of heart.",1495238400,,363,4.65625

Some of the music was OK, which is the only saving grace of this ""movie"". And, yes, the religious ""message"" is hammered in so hard, it can only be measured on a seismic scale.
If you enjoy religious stories entirely devoid of any relevance or resemblance to reality, you might like the movie. To everyone else I recommend just googling the soundtrack.",1483660800,2,485,4.855421686746988

By that time, I hadn't found a single redeeming feature of anyone in the show, especially the spoiled brat who played the lead. To draw the audience's attention, there needs to be some reason we empathize with the main character. They could have achieved this by showing what a good person she used to be, for instance, or showing an act of kindness. Something. Anything. Instead, all we got was a bitchy brat.

Add to that the poor plot devices. And the poor dialogue. And the poor filming. And the cliches.

There are so many actors, thats are chrisitans that could do 1,000 times better.  Same for the other actors too.  All poor choices.  And the camera shots were terrible.

5993428,2,B00FJ4NNDS,"While the story line is there, the main character was lacking in depth and completely unbelievable, so only watched a quarter if that of the movie before switching to something else. Which I found disappointing, as I've watched some really good movies that others would deem B movies, but I found interesting because of the storyline or a few good characters, which this has, just not enough to go through watching till the end. Not to mention the ""growth"" portions that should have been more in-depth -  a slowly changing or metamorphosis of a young female into the woman she would become, was just missing. It was as if, the first day was the longest day in the history of humankind, and in the 10 -15 minutes from the time she threw her tantrum and walked out, met a family and just had an epiphany on music, life, etc. (Picture child wants cookie, throws tantrum till receives cookie...just without the drama or emotional toll of really wanting that cookie)",1457308800,,961,4.686390532544379

5993447,1,B00FJ4NNDS,"The script left a lot to be desired. This attempt at a Christian film in many ways hurts the genre. The actors are very inexperienced and that shows on screen. Filming was done by thoroughly inexperienced camera people, shots were too close up or too far back. Edits and pacing were tragically sloppy. It looks as if the tragic pop star here was the director or some writer who naively thought their interpretation would feel sincere to any audience. As a viewer and a Christian, I wanted to believe this story. I hoped to be inspired and instead felt like I was being hoodwinked. It was as if the story was literally being tossed at me by a con-artist (who believed nothing they were taking about) hoping to convince and failing in the worst way.

5993455,1,B00FJ4NNDS,"I'm not here to bash anyone's project, especially if they managed to find someone to pay them to produce this, but this movie was overly bad.  Firstly the storylines pushes Christianity into not just the viewer's face, but that of the main character.  The family she lives with is almost a cult who do not allow TV, radios, video games, internet (and therefore no computers) and insist on homeschooling.  I got the skeeves just watching the awkward family scene with the child characters delivering such stunted lines I didn't know if they were bad actors or hinting that if they don't say the write overly-sweet pro-christain-way-of-life BS they'ed get beaten latter.  The main character is terribly written two dimensional grown woman whose lines were either copying a 5 year old or written by a 5 year old.  My evidence comes from the first encounter with the main character where she repeatedly points out how everyone works for her, how she's the star, and people need to just do what she says or get fired.  Terrible dialogue writing.  The plot holes are big enough to drive a yacht through, especially concerning the fact that an nationally recognized pop icon comes up missing and somehow the media does not get alerted (apparently she has no friend, no family, no fan club, no media engagements, etc, like a real star would) for THREE MONTHS.  But like I said: someone convinced someone to allow them to make this entire movie and they got paid for it so good for them.  Whatever.  It was background noise while I did homework.

5993458,2,B00FJ4NNDS,"I give this movie two thumbs up, but only in the event that I had one hundred thumbs.  The two thumbs would be used to gouge my eyes out after sitting through this.  I get that the movie means well.  That doesnt make it ok.  Id say spoiler alert at this point, but lets face it you're probably not going to watch this movie, at least not any more than you are going to read this review.

The problem with this movie is that it does not make sense and that after going on for three-quarters of the movie, the director decided to throw in every possible additional subplot imaginable.  During the course of this movie, the star  aptly named Star (I see what you did there, Director)  takes a sabbatical from her onstage singing career and decides to be a vagrant into some strange town where people from non-traditional families are looked down upon.  In particular, this movie seems to judge negatively anyone raised in a foster family.  Im pretty sure that the town from Footloose was just repackaged for this movie, minus Kevin Bacon.  I wish you were in this movie, Kev!

Anyway, when our main character comes to Footloose Town, certainly not to be confused with Funkytown, she is greeted by numerous people who seem accepting of her, but clearly look down on her, for her apparent lack of, well, Jesusiness.  One townswoman remarked that our main character looks like a relative of another family in town, stating that the main character favors the Johnsons.  Of course, I took this as a hilarious penis joke.  Kudos to the Director if that was the intent. I laughed so hard I spilled my Capri sun all over my jorts.  The main character is taken in by one of the Jesusy families and they talk about their lack of a need for television and internet and also discuss their diet of complex carbohydrates.  I was told there wasn't going to be a food pyramid quiz.  Well folks, enjoy your Quarry cereal and lack of Twitter.

The main character then visit a shaman, but much to my surprise she is not murdered by said shaman and instead suddenly changes her perspective on the town and material things.  I assume she was hypnotized by the shaman or otherwise drugged.  This subplot is not further explored, however.

We then are introduced to the main characters love interest, Tom, played by Joseph Logue, who Im guessing was taught acting skills by Donal Logue, of Gotham (its a show on Fox that had 492 episodes in its first season).  Tom is apparently a quasi-journalist/quasi-internet caf barista/manager.  The main character is introduced to Tom when Tom creeps on her when she uses the internet at the caf.  Tom unsuccessfully hits on her and then tries to check her internet history but has to ask for help from a colleague on how to do so.  How does he not know how to check an internet history?  Thats like a mechanic having to ask Jeeves how to turn on a car.  It was at this point I felt bad for Tom, an obviously phenomenal actor with a poop script to deal with.

Later, our main character becomes frustrated with her situation, steals a car, and gets in a car wreck.  Its the car of the family shes been staying with!  The family she had been staying with then visits her in the hospital and Tom arrives too.  Tom gains access to her hospital room and NO ONE questions who he is, why he is there, or anything.  Anyone heard of HIPAA?  I figured Tom was some angel-of-death ready to pull the plug, but again I was wrong.  Maybe Tom was not real all along?

This is when all hell breaks loose.  The townspeople are told that their church will be destroyed unless they can raise a boat load of dolla dolla bills, yo.  You see, the church is built where a road expansion project is planned.  So they have a concert showcased by our main character and raise the money to move the church about fifty feet so that the roadway can be expanded.  So this movie was about moving a structure fifty feet but also about taking a cinematic dump on people that do not live extremely conservative lifestyles.  Makes sense.

By the end of the movie, we see our star character in a concert hall performing and being conducted by her long lost grandfather who lived all along in the Footloose Town and didn't know he had a granddaughter.  Sure, just shove new storylines down my throat in the last twenty minutes, see what I care.  Oh yeah, and creepy Tom is in audience at the concert hall ready to propose.  He claps for her performance while there is a rose in between his hands.  What toughness to absorb those thorns whilst clapping.

By the way, Stars manager is this eight foot tall behemoth with the worst accent in the history of time ever ever.  I hate that guy so much.  He sucks and I had nowhere else to talk about him.  He makes me so angry all over my body.

All in all, if you can get past the plot holes, behemoth manager dbag, judgy Jesus people from Footloose, and several montages, you still will likely not be able to get into this abomination, except for the extremely masterful performance of Tom, again played by Joseph Logue, a national treasure on my Mount Rushmore of Americans along with:  Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Edison, Warren G. Harding, Warren G., Arthur Fonzarelli, Flava Flav, and Barry Bonds, though no performance enhancing drugs were needed to play creepy Tom.

I wish the money I spent on this movie could go toward moving the church in the movie back to its original location in the bulldoze zone.  Good day to you, readers, even those of you that favor the Johnsons.",1444867200,5,5497,4.498989898989899

Sure it was a little slow and on the hokey side at times, but maybe it's just the little foster girl inside me. Without going into detail or giving away the plot, let me just say I enjoyed it & was really pleased with the little foster girl's happy ending.",1434844800,2,472,4.197802197802198

8615996,4,B00FJ4NNDS,"I don't know why everyone's being so mean about it. I mean, clearly it's some low budget stuff, like someone was doing a film product for class with X amount of dollars and this was the directors cut. Clearly it's not some next level Hollywood film or nothing, but it's not like it's terrible. It's got a nice story and it's decent enough. Look, if all you care about is bright flashy scenes, and this perfect little Hollywood magic, and A list actors with the top directors and all, then you probably won't like this. If you're cool with things that were done with probably no budget, and obviously isn't the sort of thing that'll go out and win Oscars, then sure. This is a nice little indie movie. Jeez. Don't hate it till you've watched it. It doesn't suck that bad. I mean, I made it all the way through, without any distractions.",1530403200,,835,4.428571428571429
