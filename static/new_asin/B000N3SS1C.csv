8174500,5,B000N3SS1C,"""Lady In The Dark"" was and still is a classic. Wonderful acting and storyline. I saw the movie 50yrs ago and still remember it.",1446249600,,127,4.333333333333333
8174501,4,B000N3SS1C,"I really enjoyed watching the 13th guest (best of the bunch) and Heartbeat; however, the Groom wore spurs was a bit much even for me.  However, for $5, it's a treat and the condition of the movies isn't horrid...a bit scratchy for Heartbeat and excellent for 13th, and I just don't care to watch the other one again...so even though the quality was alright, eh, it doesn't really matter.",1233532800,15,387,4.608695652173913
8174502,3,B000N3SS1C,"I bought this item because I am a great fan of Ginger Rogers. I had no information on what was on that DVD and I found that I already owned The Thirteenth Guest and Heartbeat. The only new one, for me, was The Groom Wore Spurs - witch is not the best comedy with Ginger Roger - but not a bad movie for a rainy day. In Heartbeat Ginger plays a young girl (a lot younger that she really was) as she did a few other times in better movies as Kitty Foyle and The Major and the Minor. But this movie has a few good scenes - in the pickpocket school for example. The Thirteenth Guest is fine a murder mystery but the image on the DVD is not very good - I don't mind because I love old movies but you must know it before you buy it.",1211414400,32,725,3.84

  I really recommend this collection. I love Ginger Rogers and she is her usually beautiful self fun and exciting.",1210982400,9,279,10.12
8174504,3,B000N3SS1C,"When I purchased the DVD, I had no idea what movies I was actually going to end up with.  I am becoming a big fan of Ginger Rogers and have a few movies in mind for what I want in my collection.

The movies on this DVD are: The Thirteenth Guest, The Groom Wore Spurs, and Heartbeat.  The 13th Guest is a rather corny who-done-it mystery.  This must have been one of Ginger's first movies.  I will admit that I couldn't figure out the culprit, but the acting is really bad!

The Groom Wore Spurs is more up to par with a Ginger Rogers performance. She is paired with Jack Carson (who shows up in a lot of Doris Day movies, another favorite actress!) in a classic whirlwind romance that takes place (from what I could gather) over approximately a week's time.

I haven't watched the final film yet but am looking forward to it.  It is also the ""latest"" movie of the trio. It came out in the 1950s.

Overall I am not disappointed with the movies (or the movie quality). If you don't already own these movies, it would be worth having in your catalog.",1179705600,145,1047,4.274111675126903
