873784,4,6304429681,"""Comes a Horseman,"" an ambling, leisurely paced western that quietly debuted in 1978, has never received much acclaim. Perhaps a film loaded with so many extraordinary talents should have soared to great heights. Most contemporary critics were bored.

He describes previews of ""Comes a Horseman"" as being failures and details his frustration at bankrolling what he considered to be a mediocre film.

Perhaps. I first saw ""Comes a Horseman"" at the theater the week it opened and have never forgotten it. I was touched by its gregarious nature and winsome style. There's a salt-of-the-earth quality here, perfectly symbolized by the star-making performance of Richard Farnsworth as an old-time cowhand limping towards his final days. Alan J. Pakula, a brilliant director known for his fascinating suspense thrillers&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Klute/dp/B00005U2KC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Klute</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Parallax-View/dp/B00000IRE9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Parallax View</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-the-President-s-Men/dp/6304696493/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All the President's Men</a>, oddly took on this project. I believe most directors dream of making westerns, having been raised on the epic works of John Ford, Howard Hawks and George Stevens. Pakula tried on this hat with great earnest and created a film that realistically portrays the rigors of ranch life. There's authenticity in every scene and, in many ways, it uniquely documents a closing era of the western legend.

Buck Athearn (James Caan) is a returning WW II veteran who purchases some land to start a ranch. The locale is never mentioned though, while beautifully filmed in Colorado by the legendary Gordon Willis, it could easily be Wyoming or Montana. Asleep next to a campfire, he is attacked and left for dead by men working for local ranch king J.W. Ewing (Jason Robards). Over a period of several weeks, Buck is nursed back to health by Ella Connors (Jane Fonda), a neighboring ranch owner immersed in a bitter land war with J.W. Ella, a prickly tomboy carrying the scars of a tough childhood, has a lone ranch hand in Dodger (Farnsworth) and, against frightful odds, they are trying to stay afloat. After a talk with Dodger, Buck decides to work for Ella.

Caan is perfect as Buck, a no-nonsense loner who must have been a fearless soldier. This was near the peak of Caan's career and his stoic presence is a fascinating accompaniment to Fonda's. As Ella, Fonda is an uncomfortably stubborn woman with rage bubbling beneath the surface. Caan and Fonda have a classic scene together, when they quietly read at a table while eating dinner, that is a subtle testament to their great talents. Farnsworth, who was nominated for an Academy Award, is unforgettable as Dodger. He's an old-time cowhand (who appears to be the only extrovert in the valley) with memories of long-ago drives and bones that crack each time he mounts a saddle. Robards has the difficult role of J.W., a weathered monument who sees the days of his ancestor's myth closing fast. In addition to his feud with Ella (there's a secret between them), his irritating business associate is interested in the newfangled idea of drilling for oil. J.W., of course, considers this a rank abomination.

All of these familiar dramas, including Buck and Ella's growing attraction, play out languidly. Viewers, however, are treated to extraordinary images of the relentless glory of ranch life - swirling dust, matted sweat and the blue smoke of branding iron fires. There's also an amazing shot of actual lightning on the horizon, something I had never before seen in a movie. When I first saw this at the theater, it took my breath away. Sadly, it doesn't play as well on TV, but no matter. It's real.

I could have done without the concluding dramatics, when J.W. and his elderly hands (an intentional choice by Pakula, I'm sure) ride upon Buck and Ella with rifles blazing. It's an old-time gunfight, akin to Sam Peckinpah's finale in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ride-the-High-Country/dp/B000BT96DW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ride the High Country</a>, that serves more as a tribute to the western than anything that would have realistically played out. I love the final long shot, returning the film to its gentle track, when Buck and Ella slowly begin to unload wood from the back of their 1930's-era truck. They are rebuilding their lives, and we realize how much we care about these characters, wondering if their children are still working the land to this day.",1237593600,5,5868,6.451080050825921
873785,2,6304429681,"...but great cinematography.  This film is beautiful to look at, but you can't help but know what's going to happen before it happens.  Robards character is nothing more than a big baby who literally throws hissy-fits when he doesn't get his way.  The idea that this man is free to just kill who he wants whenever he wants-including bankers-is a little extreme.  In the climatic scene-you can help but wonder how on earth this man thought he was going be able to get away with what he was doing?  Getting rid of Julia no longer benefited him.  He didn't owe the land.  The bank did.  And getting rid of the banker doesn't get rid of the bank.  Silly.  Still I liked Dodger, though you knew his number was up the minute he showed on the screen.  I can't really recommend the movie, because I wasn't overly impressed with any other performance and the script was written by someone who apparently sleep walks.",1187827200,2,907,4.537037037037037
873786,4,6304429681,"The story is about a sweeping passion that you don't see much anymore --the grab for land, the insistence that a way of life stays the same.

This movie is additionally noteworthy because it garnered the late actor Richard Farnsworth an Academy Award nomination for his part as the steady and honest ""Dodger."" Farnsworth turns in a fine performance that is plainly and comfortably delivered.

Fonda does a great job playing the part of a tough, unsentimental, and unlikeable but tenacious hard scrabble landowner --a rarity in today's wanna-be-liked movie making machinery. Caan matches her character with an easy going but as hard driving manner, and Robards is an example of menace by long stare. The pacing of the movie is slower than anything made today, so wrap your head round 1978 and just take it in.

One of the greatest reasons to watch this movie is the horsemanship. There's some hard riding here, exemplary riding of the sort you don't see as much these days. Farnsworth had a wonderful riding style, straight and graceful. When you see him in the saddle, you miss him. Iconic, you realize how much he carried all the Westerns made from 1937 and on. This is one of those movies where the three leads seem to be easy with horses.

For sure, there were things that could have been done to give it more authenticity. But that's not how they did the Western in 1978. So to complain about it now is futile. This would make a great movie to remake if only they could find some actors who really knew how to ride like Farnsworth, Fonda & Caan.

873787,4,6304429681,"COMES A HORSEMAN is a romance wrapped in a western.  The local cattle baron (Jason Robards) wants to drive out rancher Jane Fonda, who has hired on local wrangler James Caan to help her make it through one more hard year.  Complicating things in this World War II era tale is the oil company that wants everybody's land.

  With some truly beautiful wide angle photography, a plethora of establishing shots and a dearth of tight close ups, COMES A HORSEMAN is an more an actor's than an editor's movie that works as well as it does because it has an excellent cast at the top of their game.  Director Alan Pakula often pulls the camera back and allows his actors room to discover their character and the meaning of the scene.

 I only had two problems with this movie.  I felt the ending, the final confrontation between bad guy Robards and good gal Fonda, was a bit contrived .  The other problem was a puzzler - weren't their any doctors in cattle country America in 1945?  A couple of characters get busted up pretty badly in the course of things and they're dumped into a bed with a damp handkerchief on the forehead with nary a doctor in sight.  It didn't bother me much when Caan was laid up without professional medical care, but I hated to see poor Dodger (Richard Farnsworth) treated in such a manner.",1095984000,13,1310,4.481012658227848
873788,2,6304429681,"An okay movie that could have been a great one.  Certainly, the cast is not to be faulted.  ""Julia"" co-stars and co-Oscar nominees Jane Fonda and Jason Robards again ignite sparks as cattle ranchers battling nature, economic changes, and - most notably - each other in the closing years of World War II; James Caan offers one of his most sensitively understated performances as the newcomer who becomes embroiled in their conflict.  And the supporting cast is beyond reproach.  There's fine work from stage and screen veteran George Grizzard, Jim Davis (Jock Ewing on TV's ""Dallas), and Mark Harmon; and a particularly touching performance by the marvelous Richard Farnsworth as Fonda's aging sidekick and former mentor.  Other big plusses are some gorgeous locations and stunning set decorations, all beautifully photographed by cinematographer Gordon Willis.
Now ... if only the film editor had been more alert!  Because Willis' breathtaking camerawork eventually turns out to be a near-fatal liability in the wrong hands.  There are many instances in which the film needs to cut to a series of close-ups or at least a medium shot of the actors so that the audience can stay connected to the human drama; however, the editor remains resolutely focused on the grandeur of the scenery, leaving the viewer emotionally distant and uninvolved.  This problem is compounded by the inappropriateness of Michael Small's musical score.  Too often the music seems to be desperately competing for the viewer's attention, always at the expense of the actors and the screenplay.  Halfway into the two-hour running time, the unrelentingly majestic visual and aural backgounds were becoming annoying irritations; before the closing credits they had developed into full-fledged nuisances.
On balance, I have to admit that the film is worth a look ... especially in the widescreen format offered on the DVD release.  The disc includes the Original Theatrical Trailer (which, by the way, does offer some great editing!), and a very high quality film-to-video transfer with clear, crisp sound.  If only the film could be recut and rescored, then reissued as a ""Director's Special Edition"".  Unquestionably, there's a pony buried somewhere underneath this mess!  **-1/2 stars",1008115200,23,2256,5.300561797752809

873949,5,6304429681,"There aren't enough stars for this movie!  Comes a Horseman gained a nomination for Fonda as best actress, but this film actually was Oscar material all the way through.....The story of widowed, Ella Conners (Fonda) working to the bone to keep her ranch afloat just one more day is haunting in it's simplicity and should be appreciated for it's stellar dialog between the characters. The movie is gut wrenching and unforgiving, as Ella and her rugged foreman Dodger, played by Richard Farmsworth fight every hour of the day to eek out a living working cattle.  Farmsworth was cast perfectly as the wily, concerned and trail hardened teacher of Ella who now has to shoulder the chores and concerns of running a failing ranch.  When her ranch and life are threatened by wealthy rancher, Jacob Ewing, and Dodger is hurt in a questionable accident, she turns to  neighbor, Frank Athearn  played by James Cann.  Together they battle Ewing through stampedes, sabotage  and attacks and in turn find a deep understanding love.  In my opinion Cann plays the roll of his lifetime. Even the pauses in his speech fill emotional volumes.  He is the understanding and non-judgemental  man that Ella needs in her life to help her thru the trauma of her young life and former association with Ewing.  He is the stable low keyed man who silently wiggles his way into Ellas' heart.  This film has all the adventure of the day to day grind of a ranch but what stands out is the quiet talks between Frank and Ella.  I can't say enough about Jane Fonda and James Cann's acting, it is over the top.  Comes a Horseman  is an slow emotional rugged movie that will appeal to both men and women.",1476057600,,1669,4.667808219178082

874181,5,6304429681,This is a great western era movie made in more modern times. The footage of Jane Fonda on horseback proves she is quite a horseperson - she is a great rider - as is James Caan. I only wished the movie had lasted a little longer.,1359504000,,228,3.9782608695652173
874182,1,6304429681,"This is a boring, silly movie made by people who didn't care to learn about ranch life or exploration for oil (and didn't care about the the truth).

A.  Seismographic exploration:  The movie shows a large explosion above ground as part of a seismographic exploration.  Seismographic exploration uses relatively small explosions underground in a hole drilled for that purpose, not above ground.

B.  Chasing cows:  ""Cowboys"" spend much (a lot) of the movie chasing cattle at full speed, roping them up in the mountains (far away from any corral or branding iron fire).

1.  You don't round up cattle at full speed.  Cattle naturally herd together.  For the most part, you just drive them along at a walk and control any strays.

2.  Why would you want to rope a critter far away from a corral?  What do you do with it once you have roped it?

  Tie the cow/bull/steer up until you can rope the rest of them?  (you would have to drag them so they are somewhat near each other)  When you are ready to move the herd, you untie each one.  It stands there patiently waiting for you to untie the rest of them and start the drive?

  What do you do with all the ropes after you have untied all the cattle?  Don't be silly.  You put a halter on the roped animal.  That way you only need one rope. But wait!  What do you do with all the halters?

You do not rope cattle out on the range unless you have a good reason.  You drive them to the corral.

3.  How will your horse handle chasing cattle at full speed and dragging them all day?  Maybe movie ranchers just use lots of horses.  How many horses would you need?

C.  Late in the movie, a buyer says his offer to buy the cattle is low because they were damaged by being tied up.  ???  ????  Why would any movie maker call attention to the absurd image of lots of cows all tied to trees, bushes? Did someone sabotage this movie?  The making of the movie may have some interesting history.

Maybe the movie spends so much time on chasing cows because the writers and director didn't have enough material to make a decent movie.  Maybe they lost some of the script?",1358035200,4,2107,4.341085271317829
874183,4,6304429681,"The movie itself takes place during the closing years of WW2 in western cattle country.
The old story of the small ranches trying to survive the big tyrant rancher and oil interests.

Cast is excellent with James Caan, Jane Fonda, Jason Robards and Richard Farnsworth.
Fonda's performance is amazing as a damaged woman full of hostility.  Scenery blows
me away.  Great story and acting in this 1978 obscure film.  Filmed in Arizona mountains.

My main criticism revolves around the marginal transfer on standard DVD.  This could look
amazing on blu-ray if done correctly.",1342137600,,571,5.086021505376344
874216,5,6304429681,"I saw this movie in 1979 and was drawn to the beauty of the high country and the setting of a modern western with the trials of one woman and her will to keep her ranch. The scenery is spectacular on the scope of a Kevin Costner western. I highly recommend this movie even if you have a negative attitude toward Jane Fonda. NCSI's Mark Harmon has a bit part in the movie wearing a tall brow cowboy hat, I guess that was the style back then. Jason Robards gives a outstanding role as the one who wants the ranch. I think you won't be dissapointed.",1341878400,,546,4.160377358490566
874217,4,6304429681,"Fonda, Caan and Robards put in great performances.  This is personally my favorite James Caan performance.  Farnsworth is Farnsworth was one of those actors that was so unique you figured it had to be a lot of his true character in the performance.

The horsemanship sequences in this movie are unique.  The things they do is some scary stuff.  If I had to choose between riding a bareback horse in a rodeo, riding a bull in a rodeo and riding the way they do in this movie, I'd choose in that order.  Riding a horse in the woods at full gallop is scary enough without adding roping cows. The thought of roping and chasing cows full gallop down a hill makes my palms sweat.  There are reasons cowboys try not to chase a cow like that.  But it makes for some fantastic horseman footage.  It can be done, but it isn't something you would see on a daily basis.

Every story I've heard with horse , man and tree. The tree has always won.

So the stuntmen played a big role in this film and deserve some credit.",1338163200,,1006,4.297872340425532
874218,5,6304429681,"I first saw this in a theater when it first came out and it has stuck with me ever since.  Although the special effects in one scene leave something to be desired by today's standards, it remains one of my most favorite films.  The acting, cinematography, music, and theme of individuality and integrity are first class, but above all this is a story of romantic love that still gives me goosebumps.  In the scene in which Ella is relating to Frank those things in her past of which she is most ashamed, he reacts with a gentle touch and words that are examples to all men as to how to behave toward women they love.  Also,  I find that the movies that I have enjoyed the most in my life frequently are like this one in that the most moving scenes often have little or no dialog and make maximum use of the audiences imaginations.  I have spent considerable time in the high Colorado valley where this was shot (in fact I was in the valley when it was shot) and they did the incredible Sangre De Cristo mountain range justice- it really is that beautiful in person.  Buy this and watch it over and over.",1337040000,,1103,4.325242718446602
874219,5,6304429681,"I first saw this film when I accidentally stumbled onto it on a cable TV western replay in 2010. Had I known it starred Jane Fonda I would have given it a pass because I can't stand her in real life, but she was perfect for this tom-boy bitchy female part. I was drawn into the story by the excellent casting and superb filming of the settings, especially the dramatic skys. Caan played his part of the soft spoken but smart and tough-as-nails ranch hand perfectly. The photographers knew what they were doing. I can't elaborate on what the other viewers have already said and won't try. To make a long story short, I bought the DVD so I could review it over and over for oil painting ideas. I have sfopped the film on single frames, photographed the frames, and printed them for use as scenic references. The panoramas are that strong. Also the cattle roping and branding scenes.

During the DVD replays I continually made dialog discoveries I missed on previous replays. The story line and uneducated cow hand dialogs in the screenplay are extremely well crafted and acted. This is not a formula movie, or at least it doesn't come across as one to me.

The only error I caught was the depiction of a  North American Navion light plane which didn't exist until after WW2 was over and NAA needed a civilian light plane to take the place of the wartime P-51 production lines.

Some may not know that Robards' stunt man was killed filming one of the final scenes where Robards' character (Ewing) got a foot caught in a stirrup and was dragged by his horse into a post. The producers left the scene in but cut away just before the stunt man hit the post and was killed.

This film was classified as a flop at the time, but I see it as an unrecognized masterpiece and never tire of re-watching it. I live in Texas ranch country where cow hands go into WalMart with their spurs still on and their saddled horses waiting in trailers outside. The brief references and camera shots of Beechnut and Copenhagen chewing tobaccos just added further touches of realism.",1309564800,4,2056,4.53099730458221
874220,5,6304429681,"I spent the Summer of 1978 working for the Forest Service in Idaho. Later that year, back home in the Midwest and missing the mountains, I saw this movie when it was first released on the big screen. I drank in all the scenery, it is beautifully shot, but was won over by the incredible acting of Fonda, Caan, and Farnsworth. Fonda is really excellent, but Caan gives a powerful performance that is about 100 times better than his work in The Godfather. I just saw it again, 33 years later, and still think it never got the credit it deserved. There is a moment in this movie where Fonda confesses her most humiliating experience to Caan. His reaction to her final breaking down of her emotional barriers at this moment is breathtaking. I thought so 33 years ago as a very young single girl, and I still do even more so today as a mature woman married nearly 20 years. In a series of casual movements and quiet conversation, he finds a way to let her pull herself together, yet at the same time reassure her what she has just confessed to him has not changed how he feels about her. I know many found fault with the pacing of this movie, but back in the seventies, the world had a longer attention span. Turn down your modern electronics and let yourself get caught up in the hardscrabble existence of decent people fighting impossible odds in a changing West in the 1940's.",1308873600,7,1374,4.434782608695652

The villian played by Jason Robards was as hated a character as I have ever seen. This movie was absorbing and entertaining. I recommend it highly.",1299974400,2,465,4.682926829268292
