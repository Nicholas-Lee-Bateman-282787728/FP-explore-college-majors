5201636,4,B0090JBFE2,"This movie will not win any Oscars, I would guess, but it's a heck of a lot of fun.

Jeff Bridges was great, and It's nice to see a female star who is played as just smart, attractive and solidly in control rather than a brainless bimbo.

Ryan Reynolds does a solid job too. Great special effects.

I'd say a cross between Dead Like me and Men In Black.

Don't listen to the critics, this film was a blast to watch.",1374364800,126,415,4.08641975308642

So, the movie starts off with Nick (Played by Ryan Reynolds) and Roy (Played by Jeff Bridges, I believe he's found his calling) chasing a very large CGI Scottish man, that makes Fat Bastard look attractive, and we're told that just 4 days earlier Nick had no idea he would be doing this.

Cut to the next scene and Nick is digging in his back yard and we see that he buries what appear to be pieces of Gold and marks the spot by putting an Orange tree on top of it (An Orange tree in Boston? Hmm).  The movie then cuts to a scene where he's waking up and his girlfriend is telling him there's an orange tree and the back yard.  Nick then goes to work as a member of the Boston Police Department where he tells his partner Hayes (Played by Kevin Bacon) that he cannot keep the gold and he's going to turn it into evidence.  Hayes says, I've been feeling the same way and I'm going to do the same.

Next up, the two partners (Nick and Hayes) are leading a raid on the biggest Meth House in the city.  One thing leads to another and Nick goes chasing the kingpin of the Meth operation up several flights of stairs where, he runs into Hayes who tips him off that he's the kingpin, tells him he cannot let him turn the gold in, and then proceeds to shoot Nick in the face where by, Nick falls 3 stories to his death.  Upon his ascent to judgement Nick is intercepted by the R.I.P.D or Rest In Peace Department where, he is told that this is his only chance to redeem himself of being a crooked cop and he agrees.  Before you know it, he's being partnered up Roy who coincidentally was also murdered by his own partner.

THE STORY AND SCRIPT

Keep in mind, we're still within the first 20 minutes of the movie and we've already set the stage for what will be an interesting story that comes off without being predictable even if it doesn't have many plot twists.  The partners and their lines are both colorful enough and yet different enough to keep you entertained.

The Script itself, has few holes, plenty of action, some very funny dialogue, and as I said before it is overall very entertaining.

THE CHARACTERS

Nick seems to me to be just another Ryan Reynolds part where more of Ryan comes out than Nick but, over all he doesn't distract from the movie.

Roy is a sober version of Rooster Cogburn but, I seriously welcomed this as that role was Jeff Bridges best acting job in my opinion!  I very much like that he brought this presence and atmosphere to this movie.

Hayes has a bit of a two faced edge two him and honestly comes off with a little bit of a Tyler Durden leadership presence without the multiple personality disorder.  Not a bad job here by Kevin Bacon but, not up to his acting in X-Men First Class.

THE EFFECTS

I don't know why but, CGI has been annoying the heck out of me lately and this movie is no different.  I think the problem with CGI is that it is an attempt to bring to life the visions we all had as kids but, it does this through computers that are clearly missing something. So, for me, my imagination just always seemed more real growing up and these effects just aren't living up to the presence that the likes of Lucas Arts, Industrial Light and Magic, and many other effects groups brought to the table.

So, were the effects bad?  No but, they weren't realistic either.  Kind of like the way Lou Ferigno's hulk was very realistic and the latest Avengers version of the Hulk looks good but, he's clearly animated and nobody would ever question that.

OVERALL

I really liked this movie, it was entertaining and fun without being too serious.  Was it like Men in Black?  I thought it was going to be at first but, to me the story wasn't as far fetched and neither were the villains.  I would also sooner believe that Bridges is a Frontier Lawman and Reynolds is a modern cop before I would believe that either Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones were any serious lawmen.

Should you see this movie?  If you're looking for an entertaining escape from reality?  Sure I would say go see it but, if you're the type that hates all things fantasy, then you might want to pass this one up.

for the record, I would not say this is a 4 star movie but, it doesn't deserve a 3 either so maybe 3.5 stars would be more appropriate or 7 out of 10 as it was a good movie but, not a blockbuster.",1374278400,8,4319,4.271832718327183
5201639,1,B0090JBFE2,"There are several signs that a film is destined to fail.  First and foremost, if the film in question doesn't allow for advanced viewing by critics, it's usually a tell-tale sign that the movie studio knows it's bad and doesn't want negative reviews to damage the opening weekend numbers.  Secondly, a massive budget is difficult to overcome, even for an average film with an A-list actor starring in it.  For instance, Green Lantern and Catwoman - two incredibly popular comic book characters - both managed to crash-and-burn at the box office despite the A-list star-power.  Thirdly, if a film looks like a recently released film, potential moviegoers will often balk at seeing the same thing twice.  This is the recent Olympus Has Fallen vs. White House Down predicament.  Finally, if there is other films debuting on the same weekend, odds are the audience will be split amongst the variety of choices, ultimately leading to lower than usual viewers.  Naturally, every one of these factors is weighing heavily on the sure-to-fail comic book-to-film adaptation, Rest in Peace Department (R.I.P.D.).

Directed by Robert Schwentke (RED, The Time Traveler's Wife), R.I.P.D. stars Ryan Reynolds as Boston police officer, Nick Walker.  After a drug bust with his partner, Bobby Hayes (Kevin Bacon), the pair decides to keep a handful of valuable gold pieces.  However, Nick feels guilty about his misdeed and prepares to do the right thing by putting the gold into evidence.  However, before he can do so he is unexpectedly betrayed and murdered.  Now a member of the afterlife, he is given a choice to become an afterlife police officer or face his final judgment (as a dirty cop).  Now teamed with a new partner, Roy Pulsipher (Jeff Bridges), the duo must work through their differences to stop an ancient artifact from being constructed, which would allow the dead to return to Earth.  Mary-Louise Parker, Stephanie Szostak, James Hong, and Marisa Miller also star in supporting roles.

From the second the first trailer debuted, R.I.P.D. has received an endless amount of criticism for resembling the storyline and characters featured in Men in Black.  While the premise of R.I.P.D. is sound, it does play off Men in Black far too much for comfort to feel like a fresh idea.  Clearly, the story was inspired by a concept of ""Men in Black meet the Ghostbusters,"" but in the weak (and brief) defense of R.I.P.D., most of the films being released these days resemble some other film that's been previously released.  It's fairly easy to cope with the fact that this film is an utter knock-off (intended or not) as long as it provides for an interesting story, intriguing characters, and a plot that doesn't seem too ""off the wall.""  Sadly, R.I.P.D. fails in each and every one of these categories, leaving a completely disingenuous and unsettling feeling of being ripped off.  Like the previously mentioned comic film failures, Green Lantern (also starring Ryan Reynolds) and Catwoman, plus the easily comparable Jonah Hex, it's easy to imagine the sound of money being flushed down the toilet about a quarter of the way through this film.  It's just that nostalgically predictable.

Easily the brightest spot of this film is the acting of Academy Award winner, Jeff Bridges, who once again adopts the ""True Grit"" accent, portraying a western lawman with an overzealous attitude and habit of ignoring the rules.  Like the majority of his roles over the course of his career, he's extremely likeable, full of charisma, and playfully humorous.  He fits into the role of the cranky westerner quite well (much like Tommy Lee Jones in Men in Black), adding the majority of the humor to this film in a sarcastic, and occasionally jumbled manner.  On the other hand, his partner (Ryan Reynolds) doesn't fare so well in the role of the ""sympathetic"" lead, often coming off as bland and stale.  Truth be told, Ryan Reynolds needs to lay off the comic book films for a while and stick to serious roles.  For a guy that came into the business doing comedy roles, Reynolds is hardly ever funny anymore.  Somewhere along the way he lost his flair for comedy, and is much more suited for roles that resemble his characters in Safe House or Buried.  However, many of us are still holding on to the small shred of hope that a Deadpool movie is still in the works (yes, he should get a hall pass to make that film).

Overall, R.I.P.D. will leave a mostly negative impression on the few people that do end up watching it - for a wide variety of reasons, starting with a predicable story, weak villainy, and sub-par CGI.  The film does have its moments of action and comedy, but this sub-genre of sci-fi action, mixed with the premise of new partners bonding while killing aliens needs to be given a rest.  Like the first Men in Black film, R.I.P.D. would have easily been a hit if it was released in 1997 - but that was 16 years ago.  The rookie being partnered with the cranky old man ""bromance"" has run its course, and that's never been more evident than after watching this film.  Actually, it was pretty evident after watching Men in Black III, too, but somehow that film still managed to be commercially successful.  In any event, there are better things to do with 90 minutes of your life than to watch this film, and depending on how desperate you are when this film hits home video, it might garner a sympathy rental - but, absolutely nothing more.

5201640,4,B0090JBFE2,"I'll say right up front I've never seen a Men in Black movie (Will Smith leaves me VERY cold as an actor) so I don't know nor do I care if this film is similar (how many 'Hangover' type films have come out in the last few years, several of which are as good or better than the original?) but this film was quite enjoyable.  Jeff Bridges is a hoot!  Mary Louise Parker and he work so well together that I wish the movie had actually centered around them.  Not to say that Ryan Reynolds isn't good here but there a reason he hasn't become the big star that many folks thought he would after The Proposal.  He just doesn't bring enough depth to a role.  I liked the humor and the silly plot didn't bother me a bit.  Kevin Bacon's role seems a bit slight but Bacon is a very good actor who's had many underwritten roles and he knows how to overcome them.  I wish James Hong and Marisa Miller's roles had been a bit expanded but the notion behind their roles is a pretty good one.  This isn't a great film but it's a pretty good way to spend an hour and a half.  I hope Bridges and Parker team up again soon in another movie.  Recommended.",1374278400,27,1134,4.113636363636363
5201641,4,B0090JBFE2,"""Un-dead police officers?"" Really? C'mon! This PG-13 action-fest once again had me scanning my mental Thesaurus... Absurd? Ludicrous? Preposterous? Ridiculous? Outrageous? Goofy? Hilarious? I think you get the picture. If you've seen the ads you know a recently slain cop joins a team of undead police officers in the Rest In Peace Department.

This goofy comedy, written by Phil Hay/Matt Manfridi (""Clash of the Titans"") and directed by Robert Schwentke (""Red"") is a sure-fire winner, full of action, comedy and Computer Generated Imaging. I freely admit that there were times things got too, too silly and my interest faltered, but then the story rallied again.

We watch:
  * Jeff Bridges (""Hearts of the West"") is Roy, wearing a Buffalo Bill beard and mumbling like he has a lower lip full of chewing tobacco; he's an old-time lawman on the third sixty-year extension of his assignment.
  * Marisa Miller (Victoria's Secret model) in her slinky gold dress, is Roy's avatar when he walks among us.
  * Ryan Reynolds (""Chaos Theory"") is Nick, slain by his trusted partner and stunned by this new turn of events. He quickly adjusts to the idea that he can't be killed any more, at least THAT is a relief!
  * James Hong (""Safe"") is Nick's avatar.
  * Mary Louise Parker (""Red"") is Proctor, the R.I.P.D. orientation officer in her short black uniform and white knee-length go-go boots...she made me think of Diana Rigg.
  * Kevin Bacon (""Frost/Nixon"") is Officer Hayes, ready and willing to comfort his partner's widow.

The CGI technicians had a blast and the audience saw blowie uppie stuff galore! Our poor heroes are really up against big-time trouble: Global Warming, the Black Plague and bad cell-phone reception. At least Amazon will tell us when the DVD is available.",1374105600,51,1775,4.969491525423729

If the target audience are teenagers and younger, they might enjoy it...but I don't think adults would like it (though, seeing the all the positive reviews....???).  And I'm trying to be nice here.  If you like MIB, OR Ahm...<cough cough> er- someone is paying you to like this movie and write a stellar review, then you might like RIPD.

My rant, (feel free to skip):
1. I am reviewing  the streaming video. I had no issues with the playback.  Though I think it depends a lot on the connects, ISP quality, etc.
2. Good cast but there are some problems.  There is no chemistry between RR and JB. Suspected reasons: I don't believe RR was having a good time making the movie.  Was it poor direction, or he didn't have faith in the story, or having to deal with all the junk that goes into a movie so heavily CGI...who knows.  Contributing to this, JB just does not come off as a Texas Ranger cop or gunslinger, whatever. I've seen him try this before in Hell or High Water...I didn't like his effort there a whole lot either. Plus, it seemed like JB got the online gunslinger training, instead of some professional gun handling.
3. There are plenty of animated shows that generate more excitement than this soupy mix of cartoon and live action...oh sorry, should I call it CGI?  Ok, ok,  again, to be fair, not every movie can have a Star Wars budget (though it does seem like quite a few in recent years).  But big budget CGI  alone do not make a good movie (and we've been getting a lot of big budget crap, too, especially SWTLJ, just tossing that in there :)).  There are plenty of low budget movies syfy and otherwise that are great to watch.  Getting back on point, the effects are poorly integrated into the live action.  The actors seemed stiff and uncomfortable trying to act in whatever stage that is conducive to all that CGI work.
4.  The core concept of there being a heavenly police force?  I like the idea.  This reminds me of the movie ""Life Less Ordinary"", I'm not comparing that movie to RIPD, just the Heaven PD similarity.",1524873600,,2074,4.439153439153439

5201982,5,B0090JBFE2,"-----------------A NO-SPOILER REVIEW ZONE. -------------------
Absolute fun riot stuffed full of both easy jokey lines and deliciously twisty, weird semi-demi-philosophical banter that I could not get enough of! Nearly non-stop *big* action and real-enough paranormal effects...plus outrageous, terrific acting by Ryan Reynolds, Jeff Bridges, Mary Louise Parker, Kevin Bacon.  By 2013 I'd pretty much had my fill of Zombie movies, and this was a fun, genius take on other possibilities for dead dudes. And dudesses.

The bizarro rules of RIPD's universe of (sort-of) resurrected cowboy lawmen, corrupt cops, invading ""Dead -Ohs"", and the comically efficient bureaucrats of some Eternal Mystery Management Team/ God/s actually had enough logic to anchor the ongoing outrageous action sequences, side stories... and Looming Cosmic Battle. I watch this movie every Christmas/Hannukah just to keep the Holiday drama in perspective.

And nope, it certainly is *not* a repeat of GHOST BUSTERS, as a couple of critics said back in 2013. They had clearly forgotten GB to come up with that. My take on the panning of the film was that RIPD was so outrageously different in its paranormal horror, thriller, comedy mashupness, that many critics were too lazy to abandon their rubber stamp classification routine. RIPD --like Jeff Bridges' other great dark comedy hit THE GREAT LEBOWSKI-- violates simple categories.

I can see how this film might send a little DID I JUST SEE THAT??!!! shock up the spines of both absolute atheists and fundamentalist Christians. I think that's a good thing. And it's why I suspect there was some boycotting of RIPD.

AND THEN THERE'S THIS DEPT.: Jeff Bridges' resurrected cowboy lawman has genius and often showstopper lines; he carries the movie. It's because of the accuracy of the 1870s cowboy lawman lingo --more wordy in the kind of near-Biblical way of speaking, kind of Mark Twain, that I think it's hard to catch the jokes-within-jokes and multiple irony going on. Back in the day, many Americans living on farms and ranches learned to read from the King James vers. of the Bible. You can see it in newspapers from that era, as well. They didn't talk like comic book and vid game characters then, so R.I.P.D. has some historical accuracy built into this rich, character. The aging lawman also has a bit of kink going on with his supervisor...which spiced up the cop-buddy film aspects to keep it interesting on a whole other level.

Don't miss RIPD.  It was great action + hilarious writing + some of the best pacing in any film, make that any kind of film, ever.

SIDE NOTE FOR EDUCATORS: If you teach philosophy, religion, or film, I'm betting you'd generate great discussions by screening or assigning RIPD for your class.",1482710400,,2756,5.095343680709535

5202036,5,B0090JBFE2,"I'll just make this short and sweet - (Minor Spoilers) I had never heard of this movie until it was on a premium cable station some time back and fortunately I caught it right at the beginning (Ryan Reynolds is always someone to catch your attention). I honestly absolutely loved it! Is it totally stupid and cartoonish? Yes! Are there stupid yet clever jokes throughout? Absolutely. There's even a silly little love story (not Ryan's with his wife) for Jeff Bridges. The point is, this movie isn't supposed to be realistic in any way - like that stupid ""Pixel"" movie, except this one was actually funny. It's a funny ride of Ryan wanting revenge for his own death, Ryan and Jeff learning to work together, Ryan and Jeff in their alter-egos (some of the funniest moments are Jeff in his ""woman"" alter-ego), Jeff's ""secret crush"" on the woman in charge of him, and them trying to chase down and send the ""dead-os"" back to where they belong while they stop the worst Dead-O, Kevin Bacon. Quite honestly, I'd love to see a sequel made but I don't think it made enough money. Is this movie for everyone? Absolutely not. I generally hate really stupid-funny movies but this had me laughing all the way through. My husband absolutely hated it, I loved it, so you'll have to judge for yourself (as you can see, the star-counts are pretty equal down the column. I've been wanting to buy this but now that it's out on 3D and we have the 3D equipment, it's being added to my collection.

For me it was hilarious and in a way mildly thought provoking. When I want just fun in a movie this is one of those I go to.  I thought Jeff Bridges character was a hoot!  Ryan Reynolds was as usual fantastic and carried off his character's with just the right amount of guilt and tenderness.  Kevin Bacon was a surprise for me and I enjoyed his character.

5202352,5,B0090JBFE2,"I've seen this movie several times already.  It is true that it has some resemblance to 'MIB' (Men In Black) but not much! So much of the dialogue is spoken absolutely dead-pan, no over-the-top hipness or larger-than-life characters like Rip Torn. Jeff Bridges does sport a twangy drawl, as did Tommy Lee Jones. However, the similarities stop there.

There is a running gag throughout the movie about what the Jeff Bridges character finds sexy in women. It has to do with the time he lived in (the 1800s). The body he gets on earth this time around is wasted on such a character.

Ryan Reynolds is perfectly paired with Bridges. The very last scene is so funny, such a fitting ending and new beginning, for both characters.

The truly wonderful thing about  'RIPD' is its pace. It rambles along, like the shoot-em-up lawmen these characters are. There aren't any slow patches, there aren't any speedy segments. It is just like a wonderful comic book read - and that is where the story comes from. Good work!",1464220800,,1007,4.698863636363637

5202396,4,B0090JBFE2,"R.I.P.D. isn't they type of movie that you wonder why it never won an Oscar for or is even one you'll probably remember much about months after you've seen it, but it is a decent enough, and fun at times film to pass an hour and a half.  It is a pretty similar concept to M.I.B. This time round the unknown to most humans world consists of the dead who are still on earth, not wanting to receive their judgement.  The agents are ex police officers who have died and also may have done something while alive that makes them not real sure about wanting to receive their eternal judgement yet either.  So they can do their time with the R.I.P.D. that will help their case.  Ryan Reynold's character is killed in a raid, and is teemed up with Jeff Bridges who is plays your typical gets results cop who doesn't want a partner.  The movie also has Kevin Bacon in it.

On the negative side, some of the dead monsters look like really simple and bad CGI.  As do some vehicles and other props. Jeff Bridges is a little hard to understand, at times it sounds like his tongue has swollen up when he's talking.  But still you can live with it.  It's the type of movie you don't have to think about, but just sit back and watch.  This is the sort of movie that will probably have a sequel or two but with less well known actors playing similar characters in the same situation.",1461283200,,1365,4.276264591439689

It's one of those crazy movies that you can't stop watching. The action continues to keep you entertained without boring parts. I don't know how someone could compare it to MIB. This is an entirely different story line. I think that this movie will be a classic that is watched for years. I know that it is already one of my favorites.

This didn't seem to be the case here, as the scale/scope of the story, the beasts brought to life were ginormous but didn't overwhelm the story.  The little homage element to ""Dead Like Me"" ( a theme from earlier in our common European ancestry of Halloween being the day the dead show their true faces) of seeing the characters' duel presence (""Roy"" looking like someone off the cover of a glossy fashion magazine in a grocer's checkout lane) was clever, used to good effect.  The amount of gold rounded up, and by whom, and over how much time could have been good backstory.  Overall I liked it, it was a useful diversion from Fall 2015s, debates, emails, ISIS, all that.

5203611,3,B0090JBFE2,"I can really add nothing more.  It's as funny as it sounds like it can be in many places.  And then again in many places it's not.

Kevin Bacon, Mary Louise Parker, and Jeff Bridges were great and used their material to its fullest.  Ryan Reynolds was a little too intense and I wish his lighter side had come through somehow.  Maybe he saw the reviews for Green Lantern just before filiming RIPD.  I don't know.

One brilliant thing was that neither RIPD agent appears like himeself to living people.  Ryan Reynolds usually appears like himself to us the viewer most of the time, but then when we see him in a camera or reflections, the veteran character actor James Hong (holding a banana instead of a firearm) takes Reynolds' place.  I wish we had seen more of the movie from that point of view actually.  When I imagine the dialogue delivered by James Hong instead of by Reynolds, it becomes much funnier and I think the absurdity of those re-shot scenes might have lightened up the weaker parts of this movie.  It probably would have been much funnier frankly.

Great special effects. 3D was worth it.",1435536000,7,1106,4.558375634517766
5203612,3,B0090JBFE2,"It was plenty entertaining, I don't regret spending the money to rent it by any means but not a spectacular movie.

I like Ryan Reynolds but Jeff Bridges makes this movie. More or less, he's the only thing you're really watching for. He's incredibly entertaining in the roll and does a great job as always.

However, 3 stars because while it was entertaining which is the most important thing a movie needs to do, it has some problems. The blot is very contrived and doesn't keep you very interested. Again, Jeff Bridges is great and entertaining but there's no character development in the sense you don't really give a crap about the characters which makes the ""get the girl back, punish the betrayer"" plot very thin on top of cliche.

The story goes from point A, to B, to C in as simple and obvious of a fashion as it could. It was a really interesting idea and maybe was too big of a concept for a short movie to explore but it could have made it better. The most interesting parts of the movie (the RIPD itself, the afterlife stuff) is entirely incidental to the movie. It's the same story, same characters, same plot that's been told a million times. Great movies manage to tell that story in new and interesting ways. This movie does not.

I rated it as ""it's okay""/3 stars almost entirely because Jeff Bridges is awesome to watch and carries the movie.",1435363200,,1361,4.497975708502024

Directed by Robert Schwentke.
Nick (Ryan Reynolds) is chasing after a super-human monster in the streets of Boston. It is not his day.
The story goes back to 3 or 4 days ago. Nick is up in the middle of the night. He dug a hole in the ground of the backyard to hide some evidence. It is pieces gold. Then he plants an orange tree over it.  The next morning, his wife, Julia (Stephanie Szostak) is surprised by the orange tree, but she doesn't think it will make it through the winter. Nick arrives at work at the Boston Police Department. Officer Murphy (Larry Joe Campbell) loves to remove his towel in the locker room to show the officers his nakedness and what he has. Nick whispers to his work partner, Hayes (Kevin Bacon) about hiding the evidence. Suddenly, they are wanted to go to a drug bust.
  Nick falls from a catwalk and lands on his head. He wakes up to discover he feels no pain and the world around him is standing still like a freeze-frame. He is sucked up into a funnel cloud in the sky. Next thing he knows, he is in an office chair with a Proctor (Mary-Louise Parker). He has the choice of facing Judgement or to join the R.I.P.D. (Rest In Peace Department) and go back to earth.
His new partner is Roy (Jeff Bridges).

The jokes make you go, ""heh"" and not really laugh out loud, and the story is interesting but hollow with many opportunities for elements to lead to smart decisions so missed, you wonder why those story elements were there at all. Character development is fun but it all seems to happen behind the scenes, like there was a scene cut from the movie that explains why the two partners are suddenly friends again. Monsters were cool looking and reminded me of the old Ghostbusters figures and cartoon, but most of the movie is spent moving so fast you don't really get to see them and I kept wondering why ALL of them had to be CGI. Most of them could have been done with makeup, but instead they chose to animate all of them and so no matter how cool they looked, you really didn't buy them in the scene. In the end I paid attention, I laughed at moments, I went, ""coooool"" in a couple shots, but after I turned it off I didn't remember a single thing about it.",1414368000,,1111,4.295238095238095

5204407,5,B0090JBFE2,"I love it when a book or movie has, as one of its focuses, the afterlife, and how characters get a second chance to improve their lot, even if I don't believe that we get a chance after death quite like this movie shows us.

Nick and Roy, before the beginning of the movie, found some gold, and rather than turning it in to evidence, they each keep half. But Nick has afterthoughts, and decides he is going to turn in his gold. So, we might say that his soul is, perhaps, approximately 50% evil and 50% good, so after his partner Roy kills him (to get the gold), he finds himself offered a chance to help the Rest In Peace Department (R.I.P.D.) for a hundred years before judgment.

This is a theme of other literature. In the Incarnations of Immortality Series by Piers Anthony, souls who die with a 50% balance on their souls get a chance to assist that major Incarnations in Purgatory, while waiting to see if their balance can change.

I would assume that in both cases, the balance is affected more by what we do in life than by what we do after death, so even if you believe that we might get a chance to improve our chances at judgment after death, we must be aware that making the right decisions DURING LIFE will have a much bigger effect on our soul's balance than what we do after death.

Nick and Roy, his new partner in R.I.P.D., work together to bring escaped souls back to justice, not earthly justice, but heavenly justice, but they do have the ability to be judge, jury and executioner when they need to be, when it is obvious that a soul has no redeeming value, using a white bullet that removes their soul entirely from the cosmos, never to return again.

This is an excellent film that gives us one view of the Afterlife.

Defending Your Life is another great film that shows us the Afterlife.

Pier's Anthony's eight book series, The Incarnations of Immortality, looking at humans becoming and serving as the incarnations of Death, Time, Fate, War, Mother Earth, Evil, Good, and Night, is another excellent resource. (As you might guess, Incarnations is one of my favorite series of books, I've read the first book, ""On a Pale Horse"" at least eight or ten times.

5204499,3,B0090JBFE2,"R.I.P.D. is... a complicated thing.  It's based on a Dark Horse comic, but it's also kind of a rip-off of Men in Black.  Men in Black the film, not the comic.  It looks like they intended to achieve the same success as the MiB not by following the same procedure and adapting the story in a way that'd be more fitting and interesting for its world, but by simply redoing MiB but exchanging ""aliens"" for ""dead people"".

But I'm getting ahead of myself.  The film stars Ryan Reynolds as Nick, a policeman who steals gold from a drug bust with his partner Bobby (played by Kevin Bacon, which sort of ruins any suspense into realizing who's going to be the villain), but then he gets second thoughts and wants out.  Not wanting to take any chances, Bobby murders Nick in the middle of a firefight.  After he hits the floor, Nick is lifted into a portal to the afterlife, where he is taken to the R.I.P.D., a place where he's given the opportunity to use his skills as policeman instead of going to purgatory.  There, he's joined by Roy (Jeff Bridges), former Civil War fighter, as his new partner, in order to pursue and arrest ""deadoes"", renegade souls who refuse to go on and so turn into monsters.  But then they're dragged into a plot by the deadoes to escape hell and invade the Earth and Nick's stolen gold is a key element.

So, let's check onto the list of cliches, shall we? Buddy cops who can't stand each other at first but warm up to each other at the end? Check.  Trigger-happy cowboy with an accent who shoots first and aks questions later? Check. Policeman runs into catastrophic scenario in his first day? Check.  Guy who wants out from a crime and doesn't even suspect he might be killed for it? Check.  Villain who lets himself be easily captured so he can wreak havoc at the heroes headquarters? Check.  Kidnapping the hero's girlfriend at the climax? Check.  And many, MANY more.

Then there are the specific rip-offs.  Besides the obvious MiB vibe, there are obvious plot points from Ghost, and the whole ""dead souls refusing to move on and staying to wander on Earth, turning into monsters"" is something I vividly remember from somewhere else, but it's killing me that I can't remember where it's from.

But maybe I'm being a bit unfair.  Movies take plot ideas or even entire scenes from other ones and put a new spin on them, or the characters are interesting enough that we don't care about the lack of originality.  But the sad truth is that R.I.P.D. doesn't even try.  The characters are all stereotypes played with no real interest by their actors.  The situations are generic enough that you're easily able to predict the next thing with great accuracy.  How about the comedy?  Well, you need jokes and funny situations for that, and this movie only acts like there are, but most of the time, there aren't.  Well, then, ""What about the action?"", you might ask.  Unfortunately, that is lacking too.  There are very few action scenes, and they're either uninteresting, downright boring or hard to look at seriously due to the terrible CGI.  The very first scene in the film shows some CGI so bad you'd swear someone photoshopped a PSX cutscene in the middle of a live-action film.

I'm not gonna lie, there are a couple of interesting ideas on the film.  Dead people are unable to communicate with the loved ones who they are, so they look and sound different, and their speech mangles if they try to say who they are.  They all appear to other people as different humans.  Nick shows up as an old asian man and Roy as a blonde, attractive woman.  Indian food reveals the monsters' true aspect.  But in general, there's really not much good going on here.  Reynolds looks completely uninterested and Bridges accent is so terrible it makes you uncomfortable hearing it every time.

I really can't go and say this is a BAD film, since there's really nothing that's insulting, stupid or doesn't work for its premise, but there's an inherent laziness to the film.  It's like a made-by-numbers movie, as if they chose the plot, characters, setting and dialogue by throwing darts at a board and so it's hard to recommend, but I can't just tell people to avoid it.  It's really not hard to make an attractive film working almost exclusively with stereotypes (look at, say, Avatar), but you need to give your movie some appeal, which this film lacks.  Ultimately, it's not a bad experience, but it's a forgettable one.",1408665600,2,4433,4.6130268199233715

5204693,2,B0090JBFE2,"I've just seen the movie. Not too bad. I can understand the many negative reviews. I guess it's just that we the world audience have been subjected to so much of special effects & cgi thrown into movies since maybe 1991, when 'Juraissic Park 1' first enthralled us all with its eye opening marvellous special effects and dinosaur cgi. Then the amazement quickly subsided when the 3rd instalment of
'Jurassic Park 3' was unveiled.
If RIPD had been made about 15 years ago, it may have been a box office hit. But in the present day, and with its story and monsters a little similar in look to the MIB series, RIPD sadly did the way it did at the actual box office; a flop.
Audiences are so weary of all these major special effects, and also of that silly shaky camera, quick action editing fad which some silly film directors are so set on.
They want thrill and excitement together with these special effects, which I guess, RIPD sort of lacks even in its most exciting action scenes.
There is no thrill even in its most intense action scenes. It's like we have seen it all too many times in the other thousand movies.
The ante is set upon the film writers and makers to give us 'heart pumping and spine tingling' action and storylines more than ever.
Hard luck to these film industrial guys as they really have to work harder, and not just churn out perfunctory action movies with mega budgets.
RIPD is an ok so-so lazy afternoon movie, but it will be forgotten by many as time fleets by. Rating 4/10.",1404259200,,1500,4.458181818181818

Whenever it tries to be action, it's hardly ever very exciting and is instead insanely whacky.  Whenever it tries to be sincere and emotional, the silliness that occupies the concept makes the few moments of emotion seem limp and forced so you end up not really caring about these segments either.  The storyline suffers as a result of the movie not really knowing what it wants to be, or rather, it constantly goes off in too many directions but never really feels concrete.  Basically Jeff Bridges being an obnoxious lawman makes this movie watchable.  Otherwise it's just constantly goofy.

Anyway, the story.  Ryan Reynolds and Kevin Bacon work together in the police department and end up stealing several gold bars from thugs.  Ryan suggests turning the gold in.  Kevin pretends to go along with it, until the perfect opportunity to kill his partner arises during an indoor shootout with Kevin's character knowing he can get away with it without anyone noticing.  Ryan dies as a result, and after winding up in a mysterious place outside of heaven he makes an agreement with a lady in charge of people's fate and comes back to his home city of Boston.  He soon finds himself teaming with Jeff Bridges character as the two of them work on cases around the city while occasionally stumbling upon Kevin Bacon's character communicating with Ryan's wife (concerning the gold and Kevin making an effort to cover his murder crime).  Yes Kevin Bacon plays the bad guy!  I hardly ever see that in movies he plays in.

However here's the catch- people can't SEE Ryan Reynolds the way he looked when he was alive.  Instead people see a hot supermodel.  The same goes for Jeff Bridges character.  This leads to several scenes that are supposed to be hilarious but never made me laugh one bit.

The animation is unusual.  It reminds me of Who Framed Roger Rabbit or perhaps Shrek in that real people interact with comic book-style animation in a way that makes the monster-like creatures really look like a part of reality.  Expect to see animated monster creatures walking sideways across the outside of building walls as Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges attempt to shoot them down.  It's... odd.  The interaction between real people and animation was odd in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and it's odd here.  The storyline of fighting crimes in a city is similar to Who Framed Roger Rabbit as well.  You will notice similarities between the two films from time to time.

Otherwise this is a tolerable action/adventure film but nothing worth going out of your way for.  I recommend waiting for it to come on TV and not actually purchasing the DVD.  It's not interesting enough.  Most of the children watching this probably won't be able to detect the inappropriate references anyway and will instead focus on the monsters so no worries there.",1403049600,,3235,4.871794871794871

5204757,3,B0090JBFE2,"This film isn't, by any means, perfect, but who cares? I had fun watching it. Just so you don't have any unrealistic expectations, I'll put this here: If you're watching this, you want to watch Jeff Bridges. He is far and away the best part of the film. The story is so-so, Ryan Reynolds is... well, Ryan Reynolds, likable in a very generic sort of way, and Mary-Louis Parker steals every scene she's in, but that may be because she's only in about three of them. Kevin Bacon is always good for a laugh, though. As the film goes on, he seems to realize that this isn't going to get him an Oscar, so he just hams it up. It's great.
Overall, I wouldn't recommend that everyone buy this film, but it's certainly good for a laugh, and I think it would be worth renting.",1402876800,,765,4.2827586206896555

5204763,2,B0090JBFE2,"This, too, shall pass, Ryan Reynolds - but what the hell were you thinking? Somewhere lurking beneath the awful suck that is R.I.P.D. is a rollicking film. But something got lost in translation from Peter M. Lenkov's fun comic book out of Dark Horse to its silver screen adaptation. The faults comprise a wealth of poor choices made, ranging from choppy storytelling to crap CG to too obvious cribbing from Men in Black, Ghostbusters, and the Frighteners. Somewhere, Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith aren't sweating it.

Our entry point character is Boston's finest Nick Walker (Reynolds), latest recruit to the Rest in Peace Department, the afterlife police force dedicated to safeguarding the living from them restless undead what have lingered past their mortal coil. Nick, baffled hombre murdered moments ago, is given a choice between final judgment and joining R.I.P.D. for one hundred years. You and I, with skeletons in our closets, most likely would've done what he does next. Comes that law badge manifesting, charring, on his chest - a pretty cool visual. Off he goes to track down the dead who've slipped thru the cracks, whose stay on Earth have rotted their souls.

Nick's joined up just when R.I.P.D. needs him most. He's partnered up with Roycephus Pulsipher (Jeff Bridges), an ornery U.S. marshall whose heyday was circa 1800. In the midst of Nick's orientation, they sniff out a conspiracy amongst the undead in Boston, a nasty scheme that, if successful, would make the dead rain down on Earth. There's a 3000-year-old artifact served up as the McGuffin. There's Indian takeout food to give the dead away. There's Bridges' dusting off his Rooster Cogburn accent. There's Steely Dan music getting piped into the R.I.P.D. office (it's never explained why).

Remember when Amazon used to pimp its Listmania feature? I hadn't seen that in a while. But right now I've this urge to make a new list, the theme of which is Worst Comic Book Movie. And on that list R.I.P.D. would've just gone toe to toe with Jonah Hex, Catwoman, and Son of the Mask for top honors. And yet, in spite of the film's massive clunkiness, Reynolds does his best to anchor things. Bridges, for his part, is always interesting to watch but he just may have been too clownish here, so over-the-top I didn't much care what happened to him. I did like the playfulness between him and Reynolds and that their investigative methods tend to inch toward the maverick side.

The R.I.P.D. trailer presented a hilarious gimmick that right away became THE hook for me. The gimmick proposes that the universe, in its sagacity, prefers to blindfold the living. It projects the R.I.P.D. peacekeepers as something other than themselves to mere mortals. So, back on Earth, Nick Walker appears as this old Chinese guy (James Hong) with a banana (but, really, his gun) and Roycephus resembles a voluptuous blonde bombshell (Marisa Miller). And while the film does occasionally make good use of the gimmick, I think it could've explored it even more, for even bigger laughs. Hell, I wanted extended scenes with Hong and Miller. I feel it's only one of several missed opportunities, just another botched element. The film tries but fails to ape what Men in Black did so well, which is strike a balance between its moments of levity and its dramatic beats. There's nothing much here to invest you emotionally, and this is factoring in Nick's pining for his grieving wife (Stephanie Szostak) and his maddogging of his erstwhile partner in Boston PD. Kevin Bacon and Mary-Louise Parker are wasted. There's this sense that plenty of Parker's material was excised, that we only catch a glimmer of her character's quirkiness. And the Bacon, he's just dull in a dull role in a dull movie. The CG is so obvious and overused it takes you right out of the film (okay, some of the bullet time effects were cool). R.I.P.D.'s referencing the fugitive undead as ""deadoes"" is numbingly lame. The deadoes tend to look more cartoonish than menacing. One doughy deado looks like the Michelin Man and Mike Myer's Fat Bastard had a late night encounter. Also, as someone typing out a review, I resent that there's so many damn periods in the film title. So, yeah, R.I.P.D., neutered and soulless, not only appropriates an hour and a half of your life, it may give you carpal tunnel as well.

Bridges is a lawman from the old west while Reynolds is the newest recruit to try to stop the dead from returning to the land of the living. Of course once dead, they don't look anything alike and since Reynolds has left his fiance behind, he is desperately trying to get a message to her even though he looks like an old Chinese man. The best actor in this fiasco was Kevin Bacon as Reynolds partner who double crosses him and is attempting to open the gateway allowing ALL the recently dead, and not good, guys out of their true destination...up or down.

My first complaint is that Ryan Reynolds's character is bland at best.  I didn't even hear any real emotion from him when he arrived at RIPD and was told all about the organization, his proposed role in it, and the benefits he could expect from joining up (I mean, the man literally just died...you'd think he'd need a little time to get used to everything.  Sure, there was some emotion at the funeral, but that was forced at best and dealt with with way too quickly.)  While this film employed a lot of the stereotypes of buddy cop films, its premise is interesting and the stereotypes that are employed mostly work...Lord knows I've seen plenty of films that did much worse in this area.  I do think things with our leads' new partnership were rushed in the beginning.  I get that, real or dead, new officers in a department aren't given days of orientation and instead ""learn on the job"", especially if they already have some police experience in their backgrounds...that is what senior partners are meant for.  But our buddy cops went from agreeing to be partners to trying to aclamate to one another to totally dissagreeing with one another to coming to terms and starting to work together on the plot's main case in the space of about fifteen or sixteen minutes...I know the movie's not in real time, but couldn't a little more of its ninety  or so minutes have been devoted to developing this relationship?  A single episode of Law and Order where a new partner was introduced spent more time on things like that.  Some of the jokes just fell flat (""Eternal Affairs"" for example (also did they refer to it as ""internal affairs"" when Jeff Bridges character was first introduced?).)  Also, some things were hastily explained at the last minute as though the script writers just suddenly realized that the plot wouldn't make any sense otherwise (the Saint Christopher medal for example) and some things are mentioned once and then never explained at all (""blood of thyn enemy"" for example.)  And what was with the guys' ""catch phrase, ""Relax, body""...does anyone see that catching on?  Again, this could have been a much better film if everyone had just put in as much effort as Jeff Bridges and Mary-Louise Parker, the only enjoyable and truly memorable parts of this picture.  I'm led to understand that this film was based on a comic series.  Well, we've all seen the hits and misses of comic book adaptations.  If you're a fan and you want this film to complete some kind of collection, go for it.  If you're a fan and you want to preserve what you love about the comics and not watch the film, that's fine too.  Maybe you're not a fan at all...I'll leave the purchasing decision in your hands no matter what.  Enjoy.",1399075200,,2836,4.611553784860558

I do think it's entertaining, and intelligently funny. I was completely surprised to see who else was in it, and that made it even better. It was a bit like MIB, but in a good way, and not so much that it ran over the plot of the movie. The ending was somewhat predictable, and yet not entirely, so I walked away feeling good about it.

What in the world is either wrong with Jeff Bridges or his acting style lately?  It would have been a lot more enjoyable had he not opted to take the role of a speech impediment ridden cowboy for this role.

The plot that motivates the evil ghosts is a bit hard to take and the idea that they could escape from God's custody is absurd. The way these undercover ghosts are unmasked, ridiculous! It depends on acceptance of a judeo-christian narrative of God, heaven & hell and then suspends accepted tenets of that traditional belief structure to advance the plot. They would have done better to simply accept the common belief in ghosts, that wander the earth after death, and go with that, leaving God & judeo-christian traditions out. I'd like to see it played straight or comedically. The first half is a little slow as Ryan Reynolds seems uncertain how he wants to play his character. Jeff Bridges is a complete and totally satirical character from his first scene. I found Reynolds' angst, over his lost chance at an life based relationship, difficult to buy into. His sincerity seemed as though it was shot for another film, juxtaposed with comedic performances & ghostbusters style antagonists bursting through walls & spouting one liners. The second half, as both Jeff Bridges & Ryan Reynolds find their chemistry as comedic characters is fun. Kevin Bacon, a pleasant surprise. I followed him from subtle to intense to comedic and believed all the way. Mary Louise Parker's quirky performance was great, potentially iconic. I'd like to see a second film that follows up on these guys.",1393891200,,1602,5.386454183266932

5205443,5,B0090JBFE2,"I know this movie got some bad critical reviews and may not have been a box office success, but that's just the critics' problem, because it's a fun movie.  With a touch of Ghost and more than a bit of Men in Black with some of The Frighteners thrown in, it's an entertaining romp of two pair of unearthly lawmen trying to prevent a group of ""deados"" from amassing all the pieces of the Staff of Jericho which will unleash all the souls in Hell back onto the world. When policeman Nick and his partner get their hands on pieces of the Staff and Nick decides to turn it in instead of keeping it, the story begins.  No mention is made of where the two get the fragments, except that it comes from an arrest and should be in the evidence locker instead of in their possession. The story's a little reminiscent of the TV series Reaper in theory but the determination of Nick to bring his murderous partner to justice as well as see his grieving wife one more time offset that.

I thought it was a good movie. Jeff Bridges is great as a Wild Bill Hickok look-alike named Rucifus (""Call me Roy"") who becomes Nick's reluctant partner.  Ryan Reynolds is more serious as Nick but still perfect for the part. There are some wild special effects. I think it'd make a good TV series,,,but what do I know?

5205691,2,B0090JBFE2,"This supernatural buddy cop actioner never takes us anywhere we haven't been before.

The problem is there's not a whole lot of originality here and not much we haven't seen before done better. R.I.P.D. is major parts ""Men in Black,"" with liberal sprinklings of ""Ghost,"" ""Beetlejuice,"" ""Ghostbusters,"" ""Always,"" ""Blade Runner,"" a short-lived 1998 TV show called ""Brimstone,"" and probably many others.

Ryan Reynolds plays a Boston cop who's having second thoughts about his recent decision to keep some gold he and his partner, Kevin Bacon, discovered on a recent drug bust. But before he can do anything about it, he is betrayed and killed. He is intercepted on the way to eternal judgment by an offer to join the ""R.I.P.D."" and reduce his post-mortal punishment through his service. The supernatural police department tracks down and eliminates dead folks, or ""deados,"" who have avoided judgement by secretly hanging out on earth. Reynolds agrees and gets teamed with a feisty 1800's lawman turned afterlife crime fighter played by Jeff Bridges. Thus they embark in adventures that eventually lead back to Reynold's killer and a plot for the dead to take over the world.

So Reynold's character gets assigned back to Boston  and he thinks this is the perfect opportunity to reconnect with his wife, but it turns out that live folks see him and his new partner totally different than his previous appearance and devine internvention keeps him from actually telling his wife who he really is. Reynolds appears as an old Chinese man, played by James Hong (who is a much better actor than this outing lets him be), while Bridge's crusty western lawman appears as a hot buxom blonde played by Victoria Secret Model Marisa Lee Bertetta.

It bothers me that there's several things never explained - besides why they couldn't come up with a better name than ""deados."" When Reynold's character dies, he seems to have no choice than to head towards judgment. So how did these other folks manage to stick around? There's a particular kind of ethnic food that pursuades deados to reveal their true form, so how does that work, or is that just the writers exposing their prejudice? If these are just dead people, why are some of them monsters with multiple limbs, fingers, or even heads?

Bridges' character seems a lot like his Rooster Cogburn from True Grit, except this time he has both eyes and a lot more drawl. He often steals the show with Reynold's rookie playing the straight man.

The extras on this disk aren't all that strong, There's some minor deleted or extended scenes, a blooper reel, and a making of featurette which details how the R.I.P.D. concept was first hatched in the late 90's, and was a comic book before becoming a movie.

5205757,3,B0090JBFE2,"though it has much the same feel to it.  This movie is not to be taken
seriously, and makes no attempt to be serious.  Ryan Reynolds, best
known for his comedy, has the leading role here as a policeman who is killed
by his ""best friend"" in order to keep a dirty operation secret.  Arriving
at...umm well, almost a judgment day in which he'd apparently be going
downstairs, a rather bureaucratic angel informs him he has a chance to
avoid that unpleasantness: become a cop on the ""other side"".  Prevent
bad spooksies from influencing life on earth in a negative way.  And he
is made a partner to someone who'se been doing just that for a very long
time (Jeff Bridges) as an old Western sheriff who was given the same task
when he died too.  In the tradition of cop-partner films back to Dirty Harry
and even earlier, of course Jeff Bridges WANTS NO PARTNER, least of
all some wet puppy who has no idea what he's doing.  But neither of them
has a choice.  Boss tells you your job, and you have to do it.

Jeff Bridges is clearly hamming up the role of the crusty Western sheriff,
to about 125%.  Reynolds is more restrained as the new kid on the beat.
All in all, it does feel a lot like ""Men in Black"" if you replace the earthly
operatives with police-ghosts, and replace bad aliens with bad ghosts.
If you like that kind of thing you'll probably like the movie.  I didn't experience

5205812,2,B0090JBFE2,"a buddy film with a supernatural frame. neither the buddy story or the supernatural story were totally successful probably because we didn't learn much about the individuals before they hooked up. the modern officer was murdered by his partner and after he died I thought he'd go to heaven cause though he gave into temptation to steal gold in the course of doing his duty, he regretted it and intended to rectify his mistake, and then he was killed. I thought that given his intention to make things right he should've gotten a heaven pass.  the proctor insinuated he'd made additional mistakes. his partner, the actor's name I forget but who I really like, was more interesting in that he was an old time officer whose life experience and murder at the hands of his partner and the eating of his body by coyotes, hadn't exactly prepared him to be a mentor, so he was rough around the edges, and funny in his total mentor ineptness. as bad as watching a swimming instructor teach someone to swim by kerplunking them off a boat into the sea 20 feet from shore. I also liked that the heros's human bodies were so different from their heaven bodies; it was extremely funny seeing a man respond to flirtation/sexual invitation from other men and wrongly interpret it as sexism. it wasn't sexism because of the context. also unbelievable that men in a business meeting, with a beautiful woman suddenly appearing through a highrise window, would immediately have sex on their minds. in today's world, more believable that men would interpret such behavior as terrorism. the villain and his crew were hugely underwritten and the movie seemed the comic book it was. liked their boss, the proctor. very good acting all round; story and execution wasn't up to the acting but film wasn't a total fail. 2 and a half stars.",1391040000,,1811,4.731012658227848

5205898,3,B0090JBFE2,"Not something for the library, but for big budget Hollywood it has it's moments.  I haven't read to comic, so I cant make any comments on the adaptation.  The film definitely tries to reach out to great many fans; Ryan Reynolds, Jeff Bridges, fans of comic/comic adaptations, big screen effects, and speckles of humor and comic absurdity (which out does the effects in my opinion).

Jeff Bridges performance is great, something of a recreation of his country persona (see Wild Hearts and True Grit) and is the highlight of the film.  Partially the reason Bridges sticks out is against Reynolds' cold demeanor.  Either a reflection of the characters or the choice of the actors, the Bridges/Reynolds pairing does work.  Ryan Reynolds' ad libs are always hard for me to get past when they aren't incorporated right.  While they stick out at times, his performance is not worth too much criticism, positive or negative, other than provide an apt straight man for Bridges.

Now for Bacon.  Kevin Bacon, more and more, seems to appear as a villain, even super villain.  But, while trying to adapt a South Boston accent, he's more akin to a Batman Forever villain.  All though there are a few decent twists with his character (for someone who hasn't read the comic), the pay off as portrayed by Bacon isn't quite a ringer performance.

The animation isn't top grade, which angers most comic fans as a sign of not honoring the comic's art.  While the evil beasties (which shall remain nameless) are bit more comic than graphic, when applied to massive a scale it has some qualities that inspire a bit of awe.

Like most Hollywood films, it doesn't try to delve too deep into too many issues, instead relying on the star and animation.  But it does inspire a few decent drunken discussion questions and things to work out for yourselves: such as who runs the RIPD?  What exactly is in those bullets that make them do what they do?  Is there anyone else snatching souls, and what are their plans?  All of which leave room for the possible sequel (which their is in comic form).",1390435200,,2068,4.713091922005571

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Brimming with wildly fantastic CGI marvels, extravagantly sensational action sequences that'll have eyeballs popping out viewers' heads, and a dazzling host of colourful characters, 'R.I.P.D.' 3D is a good shoot em' up film with plenty of action to add to the ambience of the film. It's a bizarre but admittedly imaginative blend of 'Ghostbusters' meets 'Men in Black' with heavy dabs of the supernatural, dashes of the western and a pinch of sci-fi that the 3D image makes the film look good.

Very loosely based on the comic by Peter M. Lenkov 'Demolition Man' and the script by Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay, the same tag-team that brought us such gems as 'Clash of the Titans.' The filmmakers inject the story with a series of excitedly over-the-top jokes, puns, and lots of visual gags. Yet, the entire film has at some parts of the film good humour and a witty spirit.

Ryan Reynolds, who looks as if he's breezing through the role completely bored out of his mind. The generally reliable actor spends much of his time staring at action occurring around him with an uninterested gaze, as if he's confused about the reasons he agreed to be in this. In the few moments in which he suddenly wakes up and shows mild interest, it feels as if he's reminded that he signed on because the pay check was good. His usually a lively personality and impeccable comedic timing are missing entirely, walking from one scene to the next in a lifeless daze, making the character quite unlikeable. Even the attempt at having Nick Walker [Ryan Reynolds] is a crooked cop with a heart and a loving wife Julia Walker [Stephanie Szostak] does little to improve the actor's noticeably stale and listless performance.

The only light at the end of this dark tunnel is Jeff Bridges doing a mix of Jeff ""the Dude"" Lebowski and Rooster Cogburn as Nick's new partner, Roycephus ""Roy"" Pulsipher. Showing him the ropes in the afterlife police force, such as how to expose ""deados,"" where the dead  trying to evade final judgment and with threats of Indian food, Jeff Bridges's surly, old-timey U.S. Marshal is a hoot, excited at the sight of ankles and sometimes incoherently grumbling moans about his physical death. He has just reason for hating those darn coyotes.

The character serves as blatant comic relief but feels more like the main attraction, yet he's relegated to sidekick duties. Nick Walker dupes one of Roy's informants into revealing Bobby Hayes as his contact. They follow Bobby Hayes to Nick Walker's old house, where he ""discovers"" Nick's stolen gold. After arguing over the gold, R.I.P.D. Chief Mildred Proctor [Mary-Louise Parker] receives orders to remove them from the case and from active duty due to this exposure. Mildred Proctor [Mary-Louise Parker] learns from Eternal Affairs that the gold could be used to construct the Staff of Jericho, which will reverse the flow of souls from earth to the afterlife.

Director Robert Schwentke does what he can with the material, like getting the best from Jeff Bridges, but also delivers a good chunk of the action and the story's most dazzling moments with little sense of purpose or urgency. The screen is a flurry and commotion of dazzling effects that ideally should excite and thrill, but much of it feels like a waste of energy because we don't care a lick for any of the characters, except for the wily Roy. Other than Ryan Reynolds' vapidly dry presence, we suffer an emotionless Mary-Louise Parker as useless commanding officer Proctor and Kevin Bacon is nothing more than a real dead weight and a really bad actor. 'R.I.P.D.' But overall despite all the reviews I have read gives it a thumbs down, but I personally enjoy it very much and had a few good laughs on the way, but what helps this film is the 3D on this Blu-ray disc, but when I saw it in 3D at the cinema it was so very bad and at times totally unwatchable, I wish I had seen it in 2D.

Blu-ray Video Quality  'R.I.P.D.' 3D Blu-ray with a first-rate 1080p encoded image that often amazes with a variety of highly-detailed scenes. Shot digitally, the freshly-minted transfer reveals the tiniest wrinkles in Jeff Bridges' aging face and exposes every pore on Ryan Reynolds' mug. Mary-Louise Parker, of course, looks flawless, but a couple negligible blemishes are apparent, especially in close-up. Every hair and whisker on various characters is razor-sharp, and fine lines in buildings, clothing and furniture are distinct. However, I also detected a smidge of aliasing around a couple objects here and there, a few scenes seem suspect of artificial sharpening, and some sequences are a tad softer than others. Presented in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio, the video comes with a varied and full-bodied colour palette. Primaries are quite energetic, adding to the movie's comedic feel, while secondary hues are very bold with plenty of warmth. Contrast is generally spot-on and well balanced, but in several moments the highlights run a bit hotter than normal, which tend to clip the whites in a few spots. Black levels could have been much stronger as they are, for the most part, pretty dull and lacklustre. The high-definition transfer is not a complete loss, but it falls short of perfection, but the 3D helps to bring the action to the screen so much better, than watching it in 2D.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  On the audio side of things, the supernatural comedy arrives with a highly enjoyable and often immersive 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. The surround speakers are often quite active and bustling with the noise of the city, the chatter of a crowd or the hurried pace of a busy afterlife police station. Many of the quieter scenes come with some mild effects for ambience, but the action sequences are the real showstoppers, as a diverse assortment of sounds spread all around and envelope the listener with discrete directionality. Debris from explosions spread overhead, bullets whiz by discrete from the front to the back of the room and helicopters circle the room with flawless panning. In the fronts, imaging is a broad wall of sound, aided by the engaging score of Christophe Beck, which spreads evenly across the entire soundstage. Channel separation is incredibly well-balanced, as activity moves from one side of the screen to the other smoothly, and dialogue reproduction remains crystal-clear and precise in the centre. The mid-range is not hugely impressive or exceptionally dynamic, but it's detailed and distinct, allowing for every clang, pop and crack to be perfectly heard. The low-end is probably the most disappointing aspect because it often seems lacking compared to the action on screen. There's still plenty of bass to give the scenes a bit of oomph and weight, but it also seems pretty mild and tamed. Nevertheless, many find it quite exciting and I sure did.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Alternate Opening No. 1 [1080p] [4:36] This is an alternate opening to the film is presented here, with Jeff Bridges' character locating and dealing with a ""Deado"" to establish the parameters of the film's world. This opening actually works a lot better than the one that was used to open the theatrical cut.

Special Feature: Alternate Opening No. 2 [1080p] [5:29] This is another version of the alternate opening we just saw. This version gets a bit more involved and the confrontation goes a bit farther. But the end result is the same, and frankly, the first version works better.

Special Feature: Deleted and Alternate Scenes [1080p] [7:15] Three alternate versions of existing scenes are presented here, along with one completely deleted moment. The material can be viewed individually or via a ""Play All"" option.

Special Feature: Gag Reel [1080p] [3:47] Just under 4 minutes of takes are shown here, usually involving a physical gag going wrong, followed by the actors cracking up or breaking character to make appropriate comments on the situation.

Special Feature: R.I.P.D. Motion Comics: Bringing the Avatars to Life [1080p] [6:08] This is really just a collection of animated storyboards for various sequences in the film.

Special Feature: Nick's New Avatars [1080p] [1:00] This is just a collection of alternate punchlines for the film, involving what face will be given to Ryan Reynolds' character to allow him to move in the world of the living.

Special Feature: Transferring and The Making of R.I.P.D. [1080p] [8:18] This is a basic feature about the origins of the film and the casting of the roles. Ryan Reynolds, who championed this film all along, notes how happy Ryan Reynolds that Jeff Bridges agreed to play the role assigned to him.

Special Feature: Filming the Other Side [1080p] [6:29] This feature covers the CGI work done to establish the Rest in Peace Department as well as the various ""Deados"" in the film.

Special Feature: Walking Among Us: Deados & Avatars [1080p] [7:25] This feature deals with the work done to create the various grotesque ""Deados,"" and all also takes some time to talk to the two actors who play the ""Avatars"" for Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds' characters.

Special Feature: Anatomy of a Shootout [1080p] [7:59] This feature covers the extensive work that went into the climactic confrontation between heroes and villains for this film.

Finally, this is very loosely based on the comic by Peter M. Lenkov, 'R.I.P.D.' and is brimming with wildly fantastic CGI marvels, sensational action sequences, and a dazzling host of colourful characters. Unfortunately, the supernatural buddy-cop fantasy is a joyless, comatose mess with leaden performances from Ryan Reynolds, Mary-Louise Parker, and Kevin Bacon, leaving Jeff Bridges to carry the film as the story's only highlight. The film debuts on Blu-ray with excellent picture quality and a great demo-worthy audio presentation. Universal provides a decent but small assortment of supplements, most of which are exclusive to the format, which really makes this Blu-ray a fun film to have and again despite all the negative reviews I have read, I personally really enjoyed the film, especially in the lovely 3D, despite some of the more wooden actors that appeared in the film and I am pleased it has now been added to my Blu-ray Collection, especially with the wonderful stunning designed 3D slip cover. If you are not sure whether to purchase this Blu-ray disc, then I suggest you rent it out to see if you like it. Highly Recommended!

Plot-wise (the entire movie is based on a graphic novel), I enjoyed how normally serious subjects where treated humorously, which prevented the film from being too dark.  The performance of Jeff Bridges was especially entertaining.  The only reason I don't give the film 5 stars is because it can occasionally come off as not serious enough.

5206272,4,B0090JBFE2,"I had read a review or two that mentioned that this a lot like a Men in Black story and sadly I might have to agree a bit, at least at its bones.  It is two guys with guns fighting hidden monsters that are trying to bring about an end of the world event.  Does this make it bad, to me, not really, it is just another story in a style that I have come to enjoy.  The actors are great in my opinion but they were not given very meaty roles to pull off like I would have liked them to do.  A few of the concepts are neat but alas, not very new in comparison what it might have been, though I don't by any means think I would have done better.  The movie looks good, the laughs where short and forgettable but the idea is still a fun thing and after seeing this I might have to hunt down a graphic novel and see what else is in this world.",1389744000,,835,3.8034682080924855
5206273,2,B0090JBFE2,Given the caliber of the cast I expected the film to be better. Plot left much to be desired. Back and forth banter between Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges was subpar. At times it seemed like a lot of material was cut out because scenes would jump with little connection. Jeff Bridges over sells the 1800s cowboy. Overall not great but no where near as bad as Grown Ups 2 so they got that going for them which is nice.,1389744000,,417,4.225

5206277,2,B0090JBFE2,"My title says it all. Potentially very entertaining movie from the beginning but the plot, special effects and acting couldn't keep my interest after about 20 minutes. Jeff Bridges didn't fit his character at all (or the other way around) and in fact, he was somewhat annoying for the duration. Nothing ""special"" about the special effects as the CGI character execution was strained and dull. Neat idea for a movie that was depleted by typical creativity.",1389657600,,455,5.0

5206347,2,B0090JBFE2,"R.I.P.D. is one of those films I was really pulling for. Like the kid with the limp in gym class, you know hes not going to win the race, but you cant help but hope hell surprise you. Unfortunately, this movie is more like a racehorse with a broken leg and it should be put out of its misery.

The movie begins by introducing us to Boston cop Nick (Ryan Reynolds). Nick is having second thoughts about some gold that he and his partner Hayes (Kevin Bacon) took from a bust. He tells Bacon that he is going to turn his share in, but Bacon can do whatever he wants and Reynolds won't rat him out. Anyone who has ever seen a cop movie before knows where this is going.

Yep, Reynolds is killed in action. Boy, I wonder who pulled the trigger. He is taken up towards Judgment by a giant inverted cloud/volcano thing and is recruited by the R.I.P.D. The R.I.P.D. or Rest In Peace Department is an afterlife police force tasked with making sure that the dead make it to their final spiritual destination and do not stay behind on earth to plague the living. Some of the recently dead slip between the cracks because so many people die these days, and the system wasn't designed for this kind of volume. That seems like a major oversight, but never mind. Why do they need detectives if they know everything about everyone? For that matter, who founded the R.I.P.D.? How are they funded? Is it God? The government? I think its Bugs Bunny. Hey, its more explanation than the movie gives you.

From here the movie is one long list of clichs and bad special effects. The plot is fill-in-the-blanks screenwriting at its worst. Reynolds is the young wise-cracking rookie, and Jeff Bridges is the gruff, old-timey lawman who works alone and doesnt play by the rules. Bridges dialogue consists almost entirely of one liners pulled straight from the Wild West Clich Handbook. The humor in the film usually revolves around the fact that, to the rest of the world, Bridges and Reynolds do not look like themselves and are masked by, umSpiritual Camouflage, I guess. To every one else, Bridges looks like a Playboy Playmate, and Reynolds looks like an elderly Chinese man.

This sounds funny and could have been, but I am struggling to remember it being funny. There is one moment when it is amusing. A talent agent, seeing Bridges as a sexy blonde, tries to recruit him as eye candy in a music video. Bridges feministic tirade is actually pretty funny, but it is dragged down because we see Bridges and not the attractive woman the agent sees. It seems like every time it would have been funnier to see Bridges, they showed the blonde and vice versa. Reynolds Chinese disguise is a throw away gag and hardly figures into the film. There is a truly awful scene where Bridges eats with his mouth open and it is offensive on almost every level.

The effects in the movie were surprisingly cheap. The C.G. would have been dated in The League of Extraordinary Gentleman ten years ago, and to see it now is just insulting. They must have blown the entire budget on Kevin Bacons scenes near the end of the movie, because those were the only ones that seemed finished. The rest of the movie looked like test footage, with the exception of Reynolds death scene near the beginning where the visuals are actually quite nicely done. Unfortunately, his total lack of response to what would be an astounding moment for any human being makes the whole scene feel like what it wasan actor staring at a green screen.

R.I.P.D. seemed like a fun conceptan action/comedy amalgamation of Men In Black and the SyFy series G vs E. Ironically, if this had been a TV movie it might have been charming in its badness and fun for its attempt at camp. As it is, the fact that I can even compare it to movies made by The Asylum should be a huge red flag for a big budget movie. Let this one stay buried.",1389571200,,3857,4.502857142857143

5206349,1,B0090JBFE2,"This movie would have been ok if Men in Black was never made.  Same story, and not a good one at that.  I think both actors are great,  this is just a bad rip off of Men in Black",1389571200,,178,3.5128205128205128

5206497,3,B0090JBFE2,Jeff Bridges being in this made me hope this was going to be a very good movie but it is bad on so many levels. The CG in a lot of places looks like they never even tried to get past the first 2 or 3 passes. The story is challenging to follow. The chemistry between the lead characters is awful.

As I said in the headline of this review it had a few moments that I got a chuckle out of but that was it. The CG I was all over the place and very noticeable, mostly disappointing and aside from the obvious rip off of MIB it still could have been a really fun movie. Just to many flaws in it for me to enjoy. I wanted to give it 2.5 stars but I could only select whole stars so that's why it got three instead of two, however still not sure if I should give it two stars, I do think some folks will enjoy this movie, because we are all so varied in our likes and dislikes, it won't be someone that knows movies or has",1389312000,,745,3.9078947368421053

5206559,4,B0090JBFE2,"I haven't read the other reviews but I hadn't heard anything good about this movie before I watched it.

Those people have no idea what they are talking about.  This movie is FUN.  Jeff Bridges is awesome & Ryan Reynolds was a blast.  Mary Louise Parker was hilarious.  If you like stories with their own mythologies and slightly darker humor, then this is for you.",1389139200,,365,4.553846153846154

5206591,3,B0090JBFE2,"I've never been keen on movies that begin with a narration that sounds more like a disclaimer, detailing very little before throwing in a new timeline.  In essence, saying never mind what little you just saw and couldn't possibly understand because this story actually begins ""3 or 4 days ago.""  This begs the question, what's wrong with starting a movie where the story begins and forget about having to backtrack to another point in time.  What are you hiding, a bad plot perhaps?

This is, at all times, an odd movie.  Not quite supernatural, never really a buddy-cop flick, little to no sci-fi content.........there's just barely enough action to qualify it as some sort of a crime piece.  Where Ryan Reynolds (as Nick Walker) goes from one bad partner (Kevin Bacon) to another one (misplayed by Jeff Bridges) in order to save the balance of the world, or something.  You see, there are these deados who want to take over the world with the Staff of Jericho...............

This movie wants to be a lot of things it isn't.  The story needed a few more rewrites.  Someone should have told Jeff Bridges to tone it down and try to enunciate clearly.  Ryan Reynolds took being dead to a level of certainty that makes most method actors look like pikers by comparison.  Only Kevin Bacon and Mary-Louise Parker seemed to be having any fun.  And the special effects were nice.  I won't say it's absolutely abysmal because I managed to sit through the whole movie and didn't feel any worse for the wear and tear it put my poor brain cells through.  Who knows, I may even try watching it again sometime.",1389139200,,1598,4.6571428571428575

5206697,2,B0090JBFE2,"Maybe it's because I didn't sit through the entire thing (I got through maybe 20 mins of it) but I just wasn't feeling it.

5206757,3,B0090JBFE2,Some very funny scenes but overall I was not impressed. Bridges plays a rough cowboy and tends to shoot anything that moves. Ryan Reynolds character is good but overall sad.,1388793600,,173,4.8

5206820,1,B0090JBFE2,Couldn't understand half of what Jeff bridges said and not the role you'd expect to see Ryan Reynolds in . Reynolds was not funny in it at all and that's not what you would expect in one of his movies. Easily one of his worst movies ever ! Terrible MIB knock off !,1388707200,,264,4.0

5206826,3,B0090JBFE2,Not bad but a little unrealistic for my taste. Kids liked it.  Kinda like Men in Black. Too much computer animation for me.,1388620800,,123,4.3478260869565215

5206898,1,B0090JBFE2,"In the history of the world no one can waste money like Hollywood, and boy, does this movie prove it. There is literally nothing to like about it. The script is aimed at a 6 year old. It's not funny - not once, even by accident. The acting could best be described as phoning it in, with the exception of Jeff Bridges who over acts so badly that he does everything short of tearing off all his clothes, and screaming repeatedly ""Look at me, for the love of god look at me!""
The highlight of this laugh-fest is when we find out that the main characters ( dead police officers ) appear as other people to the living. Ryan ""I've never made a good movie in my life "" Reynolds appears a an old Chinese man, and Jeff Bridges appears as a beautiful blonde . My ribs are still aching at that piece of hilarity.
No saving graces, absolute trash.",1388620800,,835,4.225

Not all that inspirational or life changing but a decent movie to zone out and not have to think too much.  Bridges, Parker, Bacon & Reynolds all deliver believable performances and the humor although a little dark is appropriate for the topic.

5207068,5,B0090JBFE2,"Now this picture is Fun! Sure, some movie critics said it was a MEN IN BLACK knockoff but don't let that sway you. No time is wasted jumping into the story and then it's into solving what all of the stolen gold components are for and how they're essential to the plot. The characters develop quickly and the location photography in Boston looks great.",1388275200,,351,4.5
5207069,3,B0090JBFE2,"Basically, the premise was good. I enjoyed some of the places in the movie. The real big area was that it was obvious the acting was at a far lower level than the chosen actors normally perform. The fake accent of the ""cowboy"" actor, the strained acting of the ""boss lady"", was just enough to bring this down from a 4 star rating.

The special effects were good, no not on a par with ""Enders Game"" and others. While there was life (or should it be said ""death"") in the CGI characters, even there the acting was not up to par with what I like to think of as a ""name brand"" production.

For whatever the reason, the movie fell far short of what I expected it to be. I really feel like I'm stretching it with a 3 star rating, but I'm trying to be objective in a world that is at best rated on subjective terms.",1388275200,,807,4.10126582278481

5207073,4,B0090JBFE2,"Sure it bombed at the box office and was generally dismissed by the critics.  For certain it's derivative of other better films like ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Men In Black"".  There's also a certain messy uneven quality to it but that's the charm of it.  The film's real selling point is Jeff Bridges whose comic energy is infectious.  He must have read the dog eared script and mined it for all its potential.  Ryan Reynolds, Bridges' co-star whom I generally find to be wooden, must have been influenced by the Dude because he even seems to be having a good time.  The erratic nature of this venture proves that all Summer flicks don't have to be made from the same cookie cutter.

I never listen to critics on their bad reviews about movies but after watching this movie, now I can understand why it had so many bad reviews. This movie was if the Ghostbusters and Men In Black movies were put together. The storyline was ok. I felt this movie was lacking more humor since Ryan Reynolds is in it.

5207163,1,B0090JBFE2,"As an undeniably straight-up rip off of Men In Black, Ghostbusters and Beetlejuice, it fails to recognize the comedy, pacing and story-telling capabilities of any of those classics and delivers an unwatchable mess. This was the worst film I saw in 2013, a year full of forgettable box office experiences, and in between Jeff Bridges' accent and the continuing woodenness of Ryan Reynolds, this limped along for two long hours before a finale that would be written out of a TV show for being too bland. There's not single positive about this horrible flick - did I mention the poorly scripted dialog, predictable terrible pacing or low-quality CGI? It's also one of the worst movies about the afterlife which is usually a hugely creative topic for Hollywood. Avoid this one even if it's running for free on Netflix.",1388102400,,814,4.905797101449275

5207165,3,B0090JBFE2,"The service of getting this movie was really great.  It was exactly as advertised, but that could be because I ordered it when it just came out. LOL  But overall the company that sold me the movie, is one that I will actually use again.

The movie, however, was not all that great. As I put in all my reviews, I will not disclose a lot of detail because I feel that it could ruin it for others.  With that being said:  At the beginning it started out really good. The middle was okay and the ending was extremely flat. You have a little bit of humor, and you have some pretty good action.  The storyline itself was just okay. There was a decent buildup throughout the movie and then when you start to really get into it, the movie ends.

I was really disappointed with this movie. But maybe that was because of the reviews that they showed prior to the movie coming out, they were pretty hyped up and showed some really good parts.  So, by the time you watch the movie, you pretty much have seen the best parts.  But overall I would not recommend this movie unless you really don't have that much else out there to watch. As for it being in 3-D, don't waste the extra bucks and just go with the 2-D version.",1388016000,,1207,4.21304347826087

I only subtract a star because the jokes and visuals would quickly get stale upon repeat viewings.  These actors are certainly in their element and even Kevin Bacon makes a good dirtbag cop villain.

5207459,3,B0090JBFE2,"RIPD is a movie about a recently slain cop (Reynolds) who joins a team of undead police officers working for the Rest in Peace Department and tries to find the man who murdered him.

Realistically this movie could have been called Men in Black 4 as it would have easily fit into that series of movie as it basically copies the idea of the original Men in Black and changes the aliens to dead spirits. Even the weapons used seem to be similar. The only things missing of course are Wil Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. Through most of the movie, I kept comparing the 2 in the roles to Smith and Jones and felt that the movie would have been better with them in the role instead of Reynolds and Bridges. I am not saying the movie was bad but felt it was decidedly average and could have been better. I also felt like the chemistry wasn't really there between Reynolds and Bridges. There are moments that they try to be funny but they seem to fall a bit flat in almost like a been there done that or seen that kind of way. For some reason at least to me, Reynolds brings a movie down as I still a bit irritated at his portrayal of the Green lantern which I feel ruined its chance as a superhero franchise.

The movie does try to have a bit of heart though with its almost Ghost like portrayal between Reynolds and his wife but it comes across as more weird than sweet and kind of dampers the heart that it tries to give the movie.

All in all, it is an ok movie to watch but really brings nothing we haven't already seen, especially if you are a MIB fan. The copied storyline and the lack of chemistry between characters brings this movie down to an average at best movie that some people might not feel worth to watch.

As it turned out, even that very talented actor could not rescue this turkey from its own self destruction.  It wandered somewhere between Men in Black and Ghostbusters but failed to come even close to those far funnier and more entertaining films.  I have given it a two star rating, but only because of Jeff Bridges who tries mightily to pull this thing out of the muck.  It tries so hard to be funny and fails miserably at it except perhaps, for the very final minute.  Actually, I think I might have chuckled (lightly) twice in the whole movie.  I was not really particularly impressed with all of too cartoonish-like CG characters  running around, either.  This movie was as dead as its characters.

But the movie did get me thinking.  I was wondering in the first parts why two out of the first three Deado bad guys they gave names to had Polish surnames (Nawicki and Pulaski).  I then watched credits to see who wrote this and why would they do that?  Then I started waiting for the next Deados and wanted to know if they'd be named and if so what name.

Maybe he did, I don't know, but if you're an actor you WANT people to understand your lines, otherwise, what's the point of speaking?

5207720,3,B0090JBFE2,"This movie is based on a comic book and it also feels like a retelling of that other comic-to-film franchise Men In Black. Ryan Reynolds is a corrupt cop with second thoughts when his partner and co corrupt buddy Kevin Bacon kills him.
He teams with Jeff Bridges channeling Rooster Cogburn as two paranormal cops in New bodies hunting Deado bad guys who are messing up stuff.
It's far from a perfect movie but if you revel in awful popcorn cinema like Expendables, Transporter, Transformers, Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters or Van Helsing portrayed by Wolverine, you will like this movie as well. I'm not saying films like those are bad things but they aren't high brow and are films at their dumbest and entertainment onliest, as opposed to films that try to stretch the action genre.. so grab a bowl of popcorn and shut your brain off while having dumb fun!",1385942400,,858,4.651315789473684

The plot is, as already implied, the dead(ish) version of Men In Black's aliens, except even more predictable.  Yeah, I'll let that one set in for a moment.

Somehow, though, it doesn't quite come together... The comic book approach isn't consistent--the film tries to keep Ryan Reynolds' character as kind a a straight man/outsider, rather than letting him have the dark edge that the character clearly wants.  As is, movie could really use a subplot or two, and maybe more of a supporting cast to flesh it out. So, as an action romp with good jokes, it's solid.  As a new MIB or Watchmen, eh.

5208197,1,B0090JBFE2,"I can't understand how anyone could give this movie more than one star.  I would give this movie NO STARS if I could...or maybe even a NEGATIVE star!

This movie, in a word, stinks.  I can not think of one good thing to say about it.  Okay, maybe Mary Louise Parker.  She's always interesting, for some reason.  But that's about it!

Where do I begin?  You all know the premise:  Ryan Reynold's, a good cop, ends up dead and working for the RIPD (Rest in Peace Department).  He is partnered up with Jeff Bridge's character; a gruff gun slinging lawman from the 1800's.

Their mission is to find and kill ""deados""...bad dead guys who are hiding out on earth to avoid ""judgment.""

Okay.  This movie is supposed to be a comedy, right?  Then....where were the laughs?  This movie was not funny.  It was not funny in the least.  Yes, it felt a little like Men in Black...but without any of MIB's charm, humor, cleverness....or good character development!

Ryan Reynolds as the main character is soooo bland!  Bland, bland, bland!  Nothing likable there at all.  And Jeff Bridge's character?  Well, I just found him irritating.  He's like a one trick pony.....always bringing up the past, and living up to his tough old west gunslinger clich of an image.

The two partners have fake i.d.s that determine how others see them.....Ryan Reynolds becomes a little old Chinese man, whereas Jeff Bridges becomes this (supposedly) hot blonde.  The so-called humor of these fake i.d.s is so juvenile!  Unless you are under the age of 17, you probably won't find this ongoing joke very amusing.

The ""deados"" in this movie also have zero charm.....at least the aliens in Men in Black and the ghosts in Ghostbusters were FUNNY!  These creatures are just flat out rubbery looking messes.

Wow.  I hate to be so negative.  I wish I could think of something good to say.  Well, the best thing that comes from me watching this movie is the ability to warn you NOT to!",1384560000,2,1946,4.648967551622419

There were moments that I enjoyed but it was hard to get past Jeff Bridges mouth full of something when he was talking. This is one that I wish I would have waited to watch when it is a free choice.

He does a very good job with that voice and characterization.  Didn't really think I'd like the movie as much as I did.  Sometimes, movies are just over the top with special effects and supernatural stuff.  But, this was greatly comedic.  We laughed quite a bit. ""We"" consists between 36-75 years of age.  We loved the message tubes and containers.  I know it's fantasy and crazy.  I still have a tad bit of difficulty w/characterizing after-life and God in the way this characterizes it and Him; however, for a fantasy funny move - great.  I do think there were some curse words in it ... been a few days since I watched it and I've forgotten.  We will probably watch it again sometime. Some characters are rather gruesome.  One of the ""monsters"" wasn't as ""monstered up"" as the other ones, kind of odd about that.  If you watch it, you might see what I mean.

In this movie, if you die evil, your escorted to your final doom. If your a person that has managed to live without any real evil done in life, your escorted to your final reward.

Also, had they dealt a little more than superficially with the metaphysical question of good vs evil (It would have been much better had there been more variation of the manifestations.)  Still, as a graphic novel film, it was more enjoyable than so many of the negative critics have written.  It does indeed pack some good laughs.",1383868800,,648,4.649122807017544

5208446,2,B0090JBFE2,"RIPD(released July 2013)stars,among others,Jeff Bridge,Ryan Reynolds,Kevin Bacon,Mary-Louise Parker and Stephanie Szostak. I had high expectations for this film. I generally love the work of its two main stars and the totally off the wall concept was intriguing. But the execution was far from what I was hoping for. This has the same look and feel of Men in Black,but with jokes that fall flatter than yesterdays pancakes,S/Fx,especially where the ""monsters"" are concerned,that look SO fake,and a very poor and predictable linear script.
The story takes place in Boston. Reynolds is a cop and his partner is Bacon. It seems the two had a bust where some gold almost fell into their laps,and at first Reynolds went along with his partner and kept some. They were about to retrieve more when Reynolds backs out. At a big bust with cops and bullets flying everywhere,Bacon wastes Reynolds. Reynolds,now dead,is taken skyward and lands in the office of Parker. She offers him two choices:he takes his chances with judgement or he joins the Rest In Peace Department. He takes the latter,and is immediately teamed up with Bridges.
Bridges is a crotchety guy from the western 1800s period. They do not hit it off at first,but you know by movies end they will be the best of buds.
During their first bust together,the suspect gets away. After a lengthy chase they get their man. They recover a piece of gold,which happens to be of the same type Reynolds and Bacon had been trying to obtain in real life. Bridges tracks down a lead at Fenway Park. They don't get much info,but Reynolds plays a hunch and leaves the gold with him. Sure enough,as the two sit outside,the suspect also comes out and gives the gold over to Bacon. Bacon goes to Reynolds home and recovers another piece of gold there. He then leaves and goes to the bus depot where Bacon hands over what gold he has to a ""deado""(the dead who illegally walk the Earth).They grab the deado but he also gets away,and in fact is seen all over the city.
Back at RIPD headquarters,the two are suspended from the case. They find out the gold is in fact part of an old artifact,when put back together can create a vortex which essentially rains dead people down on Earth for eternity. Bridges and Reynolds most likely will be terminated in two days time,so the two do not sit around. They track down Bacon and as it turns out Bacon is also a deado in disguise. They bring him in,but while they book him,a silver sphere taken off of him joins together and its effect slows all but the criminal deados down. The deados all escape and head for the top of the Commonwealth building,where they assemble the artifact to create the vortex. As the vortex starts to open,Reynolds and Bridges start shooting their way through the deados to take the artifact apart. They make it and save the world. Back at HQ the two get pardoned and the film ends as the two drive away.
You gotta be kidding me? Oh,you aren't are you? Deado's!!?? How simple,familiar but juvenile a term is that? It sounds like Deadites from ""Evil Dead"",doesn't it? Geesh,were Bruce Campbell in this movie to give it some umphhh! While I was happy to see Bridges,I was not impressed with the chemistry between he and Reynolds. Nothing seemed to click,as between Smith and Jones in Men in Black. Speaking of which,this movie has Men In Black all over it,but it just doesn't have a quarter of the imagination and fun that MIB did. In that film the two main stars,as you recall,were hunting illegal aliens. Here we have the stars hunting illegal deados. As a matter of fact,if you listen closely to Bridges affectation of an 1800s lawman,it sounds VERY much like Rip Torn,Smith and Jones's boss in MIB.The so called""jokes"" are nothing but. I laughed not once,but NEVER.Bridges and Reynolds had avatars,which is what mortals on earth see when looking at them;Bridges a sexy lady and Reynolds an old Chinese man. At the end Bridges gets a new identity for Reynolds,a girl scout with braces,wearing an appliance. Hilarious......not! The S/FX,as I said,are old and stale. In fact it is one thing that deters from the movie,big time. The deados are absolutely fakey looking all the way through. All that big budget spent on CGI...a waste.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s w/r of 2:35 :1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include and featurette, deleted scenes and a gag reel.
All in all a BIG disappointment. The cast does the best with what tepid script they got,but it is to no avail. The jokes fall as flat as the S/Fx. It is a poor mans Men In Black. Sorry to say,give it a pass amigos!",1383868800,,4592,4.6844059405940595

Their seems to be a trend in the industry to do this and then 6 months later release the extended version which is what the director really wanted us to see.  So if you really like a movie you end up buying it twice!  This feels like they cut out some good plot material.

It's an average action movie that heavily takes from Men In Black, and is worth watching if you are looking for something to rent, but I would agree with the critics that the movie missed its mark. Ryan Reynolds, Jeff Bridges, and Kevin Bacon are all good actors, but the pieces didn't quite fit together.

It was so much less than fantastic. After about 30 minutes I lost interest in what was going on and was tweeting and reading articles online while still kind of watching the movie. It was shooting for that comic book, far fetched, crazy amazingness that is pure fun but it missed the mark. The movie just felt a bit ridiculous and boring.

Really...who needs half a dozen vomit jokes, fake splattering guts, etc. before you even take the time to develop an interesting story line? I love Ryan Reynolds, but this part just left me flat. Bridges (another fave of mine) tries too hard, so his characterization of an old western lawman is too over-the-top. We've wasted too much time watching movies that we didn't like - so our new rule is ""if, after 10-15 minutes, we don't care what happens, we turn it off.""

Cop dies, given a chance to forego final judgement by working for the RIPD to police dead folks, ensuring they stay dead.  Cop gets trained by seasoned vet of the job.  Friction between the two, one-liners, gun fights, bad guy chases, end of the world plot...  Overall, not a bad film.  To be fair, I am favorable to it because I do enjoy seeing Jeff Bridges in most things, even if he is partnered with the guy that groin-kicked the Green Lantern name.  lol

The only issue I would have with any part of this movie was Jeff Bridges accent.  His accent and speech mannerisms put me off.  His acting was good except for the accent.  Over all I rated this movie with five stars because it is a good straight man type of comedy, not slapstick or overly in your face type of comedy.  Moreover, it has an interesting plot but not complicated enough to get in the way of enjoying the comedy.

I like to compare films to chemistry, so when I say it was a good chemical mixture, I don't mean that it was a great mixture.

The deadpool guy needs to learn some other type of acting other than ""Smart alecky guy who thinks he's too good looking to actually be serious in ANY role"" but he does an ok job in this film.  Hard to tell if its his fault, 2 guys an a pizza parlour plus various plot changes fault or the fact he's acting opposite Jeff Bridges and just doesn't compare.  If only they had stitched his mouth closed in this one....

Jeff Bridges, the Dude, Starman, The Fisher King, Tron and countless other films man this guy delivers in.  Here he's pretty good in a film that's more Men in Black meets Ghostbusters (both in plot and depth, or lack thereof) and the best parts have to be the banter between him and that actress from Weeds.

As for her, barely know her work but love the gogo outfit she's working in the film, and as I said about the back and forth relationship she has with Bridges.

The funniest aspect of the movie is the concept that our two main protagonists (played by Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds), look like a hot blonde model and an old Chinese guy when they're on earth chasing down the dead - a fact that is played up in the trailer.  Yet in the movie what could have been a comical tour-de-force in using this concept is hardly used at all, with little screen time and speaking parts given to the actors who play Jeff and Ryan's covers.  In addition we get a particularly sad script and plot with most of the focus apparently given to creating action sequences with equally sad looking CGI-created dead.  A definite thumbs down to what could have possibly been an extremely funny movie.",1383350400,8,804,4.555555555555555
5208980,5,B0090JBFE2,"I noticed most of the negative reviews are from those who are comparing R.I.P.D. with other films.  This isn't Ghostbusters or Men in Black it is R.I.P.D. and it is a great fun film.  If you want those other movies, then watch those other movies and stop the negative comparisons.

Yes you have seen the story a thousand times before and will probably see it a thousand times more.  It's the good guys against the bad guys with the fate of the world in the balance.  Of course the good guys are newly partnered and don't like each other in the beginning of the film, but are best buddies by the end.

If you are looking for an amusing, enjoyable, and entertaining way to spend about an hour and a half I would highly recommend watching R.I.P.D.  It has a great cast, a crazy twisted plot, better than expected special effects and lots of snappy winsome humor.

This film isn't going to win any Oscars or a Nobel Prize or change the world in any significant way; however it will take your mind off your troubles for 96 minutes and add a little fun to your day.",1383350400,6,1059,4.340101522842639

The evil ""deados"" are attempting to reverse the flow of the tunnel that brings the dead into the afterlife so that they remain on Earth forever, and the dead in the afterlife (heaven and hell) come back to Earth forever.  Vick Walker (Ryan) and Roy Pulsipher (Jeff) -- an unlikely partnership -- must stop the deados from destroying the Earth as we know it.

If you are absolutely in love with Ryan Reynolds, ok, rent it and turn the sound down so you can at least get some kind of visual thrill because I can't imagine any other scenario that would have someone walking away from this and saying even something mediocre about it like ""Hey, not bad"".

I saw it at the movie theater.  I took my 10 year old son, who loves the MIB movies (yes the plot similarity is definitely there, just not the entertainment aspect) and he asked me about halfway through if we could leave.  He thought I would be upset for spending money on it and hearing him complain.  In actuality, I was thrilled for the opportunity to not waste another hour of my life watching this garbage.  His words, ""That's the worst movie I have ever seen"".  Folks, he's 10.  Until this, he had never seen a bad movie, because young kids RARELY think ANY movie is bad.  But he was right on about this.

Wait, I have one positive.  Jeff Bridges character could have been great.  In fact, it should have been great.  But the rest of the movie failed all around him so completely that it reminded me of the old saying ""If a tree falls in the woods and nobody is around, does it make a sound?"".  Jeff Bridges was the tree, and NOBODY was around him.  His parts were so isolated and disassociated from the attempted meaning of the movie it made me shudder.  Don't rent this.  Watch it for free on cable if you recently made a home movie and are thinking you made the worst movie in the history of movies.  It might make you feel better.",1383177600,2,1642,4.275974025974026

5209103,2,B0090JBFE2,"This sounded like a fun premise: a murdered cop gets the chance to wipe some stains off his record by serving with a group of afterlife policemen who hunt rogue ghosts. A bit like a supernatural ""Men in Black,"" really. Unfortunately, ""R.I.P.D."" didn't live up to its premise.

Nick Walker (Ryan Reynolds) is a cop with a secret. During a drug bust he and his partner turned up some mysterious chunks of gold which, in a moment of weakness, they hid instead of turning in. He wants to use the gold to make a better life for himself and his wife, but after a conversation with her, he decides to do the right thing and turn it in instead. But before he can do so, he's murdered by a close ally and finds himself shanghaied into the R.I.P.D.--the Rest in Peace Department. There, he's paired with sarcastic, out-of-control old-timey sheriff Roy (Jeff Bridges) and set to the task of hunting down rogue ghosts, or 'deados,' that plague humanity.

All of the characters are one-note: Nick is the freewheeling Action Good Guy, Roy is the Acerbic Old-Timer with a Hidden Tragedy, and it never gets any deeper than that. Mary Louise Parker is probably the most appealing as Proctor, the sarcastic Tough Police Chief, but she wasn't given nearly enough to do and seemed to exist mainly to prop up Roy and Nick. Kevin Bacon is Hayes, Nick's former partner, who I'm fairly sure was sleepwalking through 90% of the movie.

The story never moves beyond plain action movie setpieces with a minimum of supernatural trappings on top. I have a high tolerance for silly and insubstantial action, but ""R.I.P.D."" just felt mechanical. You could almost see it checking off the to-do list. ""Okay, we have the high-speed chase . . . the moment where the stakes are raised because oh *#&$, the heroes messed up . . . the egregious slow-mo . . . Done. You're entertained now."" No, ""R.I.P.D."", I'm not.

He is now a member of the R.I.P.D. and along with his new partner Roy (Bridges) they set out to capture the Dead-O's that roam free. When Nick finds a connection between the Dead-O's and his death things turn personal. I have to start off by saying that I wasn't really expecting this to be good at all. I'm not sure why but when I say the preview I immediately expected another Men In Black and didn't think it was needed. While I won't say this wasn't Men In Black like, it was much better then I expected and did laugh and was entertained most of the way through. This is very much geared toward a young teen crowd but I still found it funny. I do have to say though that without Reynolds and Bridges this may have been unwatchable. I did like it and am glad I saw it but this isn't something I'd watch again, but keep in mind I expected this to be as bad as all the reviews it got.

5209332,1,B0090JBFE2,"Saying that RIPD is one of the worst theatrically released films I've seen this year doesn't really say much since I avoided seeing all the ones that looked truly, unbearable horrendous (ex. Grown Ups 2, After Earth, The Hangover Part III, Epic). I'll be the first to admit that when I saw the trailer, I thought the film didn't look good; the CGI looked atrocious, Ryan Reynolds just looked like he was playing Ryan Reynolds, and there was also the fact that it essentially had the exact same plot as Men in Black (And I am the millionth person to make that comparison, too). It didn't look good, but man, it looked like fun. There are plenty of obviously bad movies that are fun and entertaining, and I thought this was one of them.

No, it's just a generic, bad movie. While I can think of other bad films I saw this year that technically were more flawed in terms of story-telling, they were still sort of ""interestingly"" bad; like the kind of bad movie that I can list and explain in detail why certain things about the plot did, and did not work. This film... it's just generically bad. It's completely predictable, full of cliches (Such as the cop main character being betrayed by his partner who turns out to be the big bad, or one of the big bads) that are handled exactly as you expect them to, never does anything new or intriguing that makes this universe different than any other universe with ghosts and dead people, and never evolves or becomes anything more than ""Men in Black with ghosts"".

The only enjoyable part in the film is Jeff Bridges, and granted, he was fun, but one character can't save a whole movie. All of the best parts, all of the best jokes are in the trailers (And honestly, the trailer was funnier than the film).

I'm probably harsher on the film than I should be, since it wasn't annoying or insulting to my intelligence; and honestly, I don't hate it. I was just disappointed in how joyless the whole movie was. It was bland, boring, and predictable; there's really nothing else I can say about this film.

Even if you somehow manage to get this movie for free, it would still be a waste of your time. Use that 90 minutes for a better movie.",1382832000,4,2180,4.456140350877193

5209467,4,B0090JBFE2,"""R.I.P.D."" is yet another example of a film killed by early bad press. Based on the Dark Horse comic book, this supernatural action/comedy is quite a bit of fun. Is the storyline predictable and recycled from other films of this nature? Of course it is; but you don't stop riding rollercoasters just because one has the same amount of loops another one does at the other end of the amusement park.

After meeting his own demise, a crooked Boston cop (Ryan Reynolds) is given a choice in the afterlife. Join the forces of the ""Rest in Peace Department"" and hunt down Deados or take his chances on Judgment Day. He partners up with a former Wild West lawman (Jeff Bridges) to hunt down criminal souls who refuse to vacate the Earth after death and face their eternal punishment. The two discover a plot to reverse the tunnel to the afterlife, allowing millions of corrupt and angry souls to invade the world.

Jeff Bridges pours himself into the role of an old-fashioned Wild West sheriff struggling with the modern excesses of the world. Ryan Reynolds looks like he's having a good time, as well. You can tell Kevin Bacon loves playing a bad guy and he shows it here.

The DVD version of ""R.I.P.D."" includes a few bonus features. There are deleted and alternate scenes accompanied by a gag reel. A featurette entitled ""Transferring 'R.I.P.D.' - The Making of"" takes viewers behind the scenes of the film.

""R.I.P.D."" is rated PG-13 for violence, sci-fi/fantasy action, some sensuality, and language including sex references. I agree with all of the above warnings. Also, the monsters in the movie are rather cartoonish and not as scary as one might think. There's nothing too over-the-top visually to be found. It's as safe as any of the ""Men in Black"" movies.

As you would imagine, any references to God are removed from ""R.I.P.D."" Instead, Jeff Bridges' character refers to the ruling power as ""The Universe."" However, there's nothing I would say is religiously offensive as far as content is concerned.

Although the CGI shows its limits quite a bit, it's not enough to rob ""R.I.P.D."" of the humor, wit, and energy it exudes. If you long for a light-hearted supernatural adventure you can enjoy while veg'ing out on the couch and eating popcorn, this is your movie. It very much wears its influences on its sleeve - a nice mix of ""Men in Black"" and a tamer ""Constantine."" Basically, just replace aliens with dead people who mutate into monsters and you have a good idea of what to expect.",1382745600,28,2491,4.741339491916859

5209554,3,B0090JBFE2,"Based on a Dark Horse Entertainment comic book by Peter M. Lenkov, ""R.I.P.D"" looks like a ""Men in Black"" with a twist. One rookie cop teams up with his veteran partner, tracking down the ""monsters"" in the human's world. The difference is, all ""R.I.P.D"" officers are dead people.

Ryan Reynolds is a young Boston cop Nick Walker who gets killed during a raid on a warehouse. In the afterlife he is recruited by Mildred Proctor (Mary-Louise Parker), head of the Boston division of the Rest in Peace Department, and starts working with a former 19th century US marshal Roycephus Pulsipher (Jeff Bridges).

So far the story is not bad. But the film suddenly loses momentum there. Capturing (or hunting down) CG-created ""Deados ""is not interesting enough. The main plot needs something more than Kevin Bacon's antagonist and the secrets of ""gold."" The ""Ghost""-like subplot about Nick's wife Julia (Stephanie Szostak) is weak.

Actors all did great jobs. Bridges and Reynolds are just terrific. Watching deadpan Mary-Louise Parker is really fun. It is just that director Robert Schwentke (""Flightplan"" ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" ""Red"") doesn't seem to know where the story should be going.

The movie is good. Just good. But we know this could have been much more fun, and those characters deserve a much better story.",1382140800,5,1312,5.032258064516129

5209588,5,B0090JBFE2,"RIPD is a very entertaining movie. The plot is fresh and new.  Ryan Reynolds is a police officer who is shot by his partner, Kevin Bacon over some gold.  Next, we see Ryan being pulled upwards into the sky and continuing on through a tunnel that opens within the clouds.  As he's spinning around in this tunnel within the clouds, he sees other dead people all around him also being pulled upwards through this tunnel. The tunnel pops him out and into the office of Mary Louise Parker. She gives Ryan a choice of either going to face judgment or joining RIPD Boston. She says the tour is 100 years, after which he'll face judgment but with a good recommendation.  Ryan accepts and is introduced to his partner, Jeff Bridges.  Jeff's character is a law man from the 1800's who was also shot dead by his partner.  The two go after a ""dead-o"" and stumble onto a plot to reverse the tunnel that takes the dead up to judgment.  If the plot is successful, it would cause all the dead people to rain down and pollute the earth.

A reviewer said he thought RIPD was too similar to the Men in Black series.  I disagree. In the Men in Black movies, the partners are people who are alive and are enlisted in an organization to capture aliens. In RIPD, the partners are people who are dead and are trying to capture dead people who have escaped judgment. Also, the plot in RIPD is about Ryan and Jeff stopping this tunnel from being reversed.  So I don't think RIPD is similar to Men in Black at all.  The plot is fresh, new and very entertaining.

This can be ruined by his love for his hat that he won't shut up about. Ryan Reynolds plays the same character he plays in all of his movies, so if you love him anything you'll love him here.  The worst problem with the film is that Jeff's and Ryan's characters, when seen through the eyes of a human-living or dead-they are shown as a attractive blonde female and a creepy old Chinese man. Yet when the dead-o's (what they call the souls that won't go through judgement) pop and become monsters, THAT can bee seen by everyone no problem. Even worse is that the dead-o's cause plants to die and electronics to fail, including light bulbs flickering when they pass by and yet no one seems to go ""When the creepy guy walks by my stuff breaks.""

It was boring...boring...and boring.

I thought it's an action comedy film and it failed on both aspects.

The idea of a dead cop coming back to life and hunting devils was new to me. I liked it. However, there were very few funny jokes to make it interesting. The scene where Ryan Reynolds found out what he looked like as an undead cop was hilarious. Jeff Bridges delivered a couple of funny scenes too. Ryan could not make the movie funny or exciting.

In terms of action, nothing was special. The actions scenes looked more humorous than serious. I accepted that because it was an action comedy. The problem was the action scenes looked comical. All the demons looked like cartoon creatures. They looked fake and funny rather than realistic and scary.
The first 60 minutes were boring with three or four short-lived funny jokes and bad action scenes. Then things got more action packed till the end. However, they looked comical as I said above.

5209670,1,B0090JBFE2,"About 10 minutes into the movie, I began to realize why this movie had gotten such bad reviews - Ryan Reynolds can't act, and Jeff Bridges was grossly over-doing it with his Brando-esque cotton-in-the-mouth bad imitation of an old fashioned Western sheriff.

Reynolds is one of those Hollywood casting puzzles - he's been successful in those light hearted comedies where his main strengths - tall, clean-cut, pleasant looking guy with a nice smile - work well, such as in movies like ""Just Friends"", and ""Waiting"".

How the heck he came to be cast in a series of these super-hero/supernatural roles (""Wolverine"", ""Green Lantern"", ""RIPD"") is just beyond me - none of them have been anywhere close to being successful.  Kinda like Hayden Christensen's succession of bad movies.

For a guy whose acting range never gets beyond smiling and looking serious or slightly worried or sad, it's a major leap of faith to expect him to put any life into a super-hero (or supernatural) role.

Jeff Bridges - what to say except that he's been a great actor in other movies but just added to the wreckage of this movie with his awful caricatured performance.  It got to be really annoying just trying to listen to him talk through all that stuff he put into his mouth.

Kevin Bacon? - deju vu on his one-note villain performance - he seemed to be just playing a rewind from his villain role in ""X-men: First Class"".  I couldn't tell the difference.

I was wrong.

It's hokey; the CGI is awful; they do a horrible job trying to explain the mythology of their concept; there's no chemistry between any of the actors; every ""twist"" you see coming from a mile away- it's just top to bottom awful.

The plot, inane as it was, had some good MIB potential. Indeed they did spend money on special effects. The main problem was that the main characters were more annoying than entertaining, especially Bridges who down right prated on my nerves. Reynolds didn't impress and neither did his mousy wife (Stephanie Szostak). Kevin Bacon did what he could with his role. The characters and dialouge had no hook. Mary-Louise Parker had some snarky lines, but wasn't on the screen long enough.

This movie is about a guy named Nick (Ryan Rey6nolds) who has a good wife and works for the police department. He also has a good partner (he thinks) until his partner wants the gold that Nick has so he kills him. Nick then works for the Rest in Peace Department and he is paired with a new partner named Roy (Jeff Bridges) who is a cowboy. Nick and Roy have to save the world from a guy named Hayes (Kevin Bacon) who is going to build something to bring the dead back to life!

The main characters in this movie are Nick, Roy, Hayes and Julia. My favorite character is Roy because he is really cool, good at fighting and hilarious! He is so funny and is just a really weird guy. He does some things you wouldn't think he might do and it makes everyone laugh.
My favorite part in the movie is when a big fat guy gets shot in the butt with a grappling hook by Roy. He was flinging him all around and trying to kill the bad person that's technically already dead. I just thought it was really funny.

I would recommend this movie for ages 10 and up because there is a lot of violence in this movie and it's rated PG-13. It also has some stereotypes that might not be the best message for kids.

They could had made it a few more scenes with jokes too. There was just so much potential there and they wasted it.

Another part I felt was lacking was the background story to the old cop or more details about R.I.P.D. We really don't know that much about either. I don't know about you, but they really could had added more depth to the both stories than what they did. I only say this because the audience needs to actually care about those characters and to do that, they must give us details on what/who, they really are. Why they do the things they do? We barely cover the surface of the rookie cop, old cop, or the R.I.P.D. I say it's just not good enough! So, who would care if they died for good? So, why should I watch this movie again? It's not worth seeing, if you don't make me believe in them in the first place.

Let me give you example on how fast this movie really was. Towards the middle to middle-end of the movie, there a HUGE problem with the after life. This is supposed to be the main agenda that the bad guys has been working towards achieving throughout the movie and the good guys are still a half a step behind. So, all hell breaks loose and you want to know how fast they solved the main agenda? The problem that would end of world/universe as we know it? That just so crazy how they solved the so disastrous problem. It only took them 10 mins to figured it out and saved the world. Apparently, it wasn't as crazy to solve as they made it sound out to be.  It was just way too fast with no details on how they got it to work out in the end. What's more is, the bad guys said, it took forever to set everything in to plan; decades of work! All those decades of hard work and planning for nothing! The bad guys made me believe it took them FOREVER to get to that point, where they can turn the ties of power in their favor finally. But, for the good guys to fix everything was not convincing at all.

Now do you want to know what the good guys did to fix everything? Well, it didn't take much at all. It took the good guys to solve the problem within 10 mins and they didn't explain how that would even work. What a waste of story time. They just can't expect me to take this seriously, when they solved the crisis within 10 mins. They really didn't need to do that much to solve it. It was like any untrained man off the street could had done the same thing, he had no idea of what he needed to do or what was going on. But, he just goes there and just does it. Man, what the heck was that!

So, they didn't do anything more with the story and it failed. Also, the jokes were not as good either. Most of the time, it seemed forced and didn't even get me to smile. Some would say it was too cheesy. Finally, the ending didn't mean anything to me as I didn't care for the characters.

I don't feel like this movie is worth buying or watching for that matter. So, just pass on this one.",1375056000,7,3560,4.098995695839311

5209701,5,B0090JBFE2,I don't know why so many people are saying bad things about this movie I loved it. It was a perfect mix of comedy and action. The cast is amazing and i can't wait to buy it:),1374969600,9,174,3.72972972972973
5209702,1,B0090JBFE2,This film is a real dud.  Waste of Jeff Bridges and kevin Bacon in this one!  They must have needed the cash because it is a mixed up mess.  Does not make sense-stupid comedy and a waste of talent.  Bridges is a great actor and does not need to be in stuff like this.  He is an oscar winner and Bacon is close! They should be making movies that make the most of their talents but this one sure doesn't.  I almost walked out half way thru. Go see Crazy Heart and any movie Bacon is in to enjoy film making. Stupid stupid comedy!,1374796800,7,527,4.019230769230769
5209703,5,B0090JBFE2,This movie is awesome. I have never heard of the comic books until I saw this movie. i'm a huge comic book movie fan and I absolutely loved this film. not only because it is based on a comic book also because ryan Reynolds and jeff bridges were awesome together their team work made the film. the movie had excellent effects but that does not count for good acting and chemistry. and kevin bacon was awesome as well. the movie is a lot like men in black but with ghosts and demons instead of aliens. but all in all it was a awesome movie. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1374796800,6,594,4.129310344827586
5209704,1,B0090JBFE2,"""R.I.P.D."" happens to be one of those movies that could have been something great had some fatal decisions not been made. The premise is a decent one.  A recently slain cop joins up with a band of undead police officers to police the undead who didn't want to leave earth, all the while investigating his own death and parting ways with his existence.  The first big problem that came out glaring from the get-go is the sickeningly close resemblance to another movie that also used an acronym as its title; ""Men in Black"" aka ""M.I.B."".  Once Reynolds character, Nick, passes over, you can't help but feel like you've been here before with the strange characters and the weird partner and the white walls, etc. etc. etc.  They copied ""MIB""'s style, look and replaced aliens with ghosts and you'd think they could have at least not used an acronym as well.

Then there's Jeff Bridges playing an old west sheriff named Roy.  The movie tries to be as funny and quirky as ""Men in Black"" but only once or twice does the comedy actually work.  I was thinking that maybe some more of the comedy would have worked had we actually been able to understand Bridge's mumbling incoherent words. He sort of did the same thing in 2010's ""True Grit"" and I remembered thinking the same thing then, although this time, it was even worse. If this is his normal voice, which it may be, then his career is in trouble.

As ""Men in..."" err, ""R.I.P.D."" plays out, the story is actually a really good one and it's a terrible shame that the creators didn't brainstorm a little longer to try and be more unique, but they didn't. In fact, the finale of the film is absolutely fantastic and the best part of the movie.  In the movies final moments the effects are outstanding and the emotions of the characters are fleshed out, giving ""R.I.P.D."" at least one thing to be positive about. Unfortunately, it took a long and painful time getting there.

Bottom line, this movie was poorly handled by director Robert Schwentke. A perfect example of how poorly it was handled is the use of one of the best gimmicks in the film. Nick and Roy don't look the same when they are earthbound. Nick looks like an elderly Asian man and Roy looks like supermodel Marisa Miller. It is a funny gimmick but even this is poorly used. There are many moments where it would have been better to have had Marisa Miller delivering the lines instead of Jeff Bridges. Regardless of how poor of an actress she was or is, we could have understood the words and it would have been funnier having her deliver some of Roy's lines. There's no excuse for wasting such a great gimmick. None.

Thanks to only being able to understand half of one characters dialogue, a funny gimmick that was horrendously handled until the final thirty seconds of the film and the obvious comparisons to ""Men in Black"", ""R.I.P.D."" is the hands-down front runner for the 2013 razzie awards. Will and Jaden Smith and their ""After Earth"" are thankful, as well as Robert Deniro from ""Big Wedding"".",1374451200,15,3011,4.598880597014926
