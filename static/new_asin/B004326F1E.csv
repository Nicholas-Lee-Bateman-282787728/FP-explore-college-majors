8414076,3,B004326F1E,The cover was very misleading . The cover shows a Iowa class Battleship. This documentary is about the Canadian coast guard ship. But it was cool never the less.,1478995200,,161,4.586206896551724
8414077,5,B004326F1E,"Discovery Channel Canada documentary from 2003 on the Persian Gulf deployment of Canadian frigate HMCS Winnipeg.  We see the halting of a rogue tanker by her boarding party, and their training.  We also see a maneuverability and propulsion demonstration, weapons drill, fire drill, communications systems, control systems and living conditions.  This is a real eye opener of recent naval warship design.

This is manufactured as a DVD-R.",1420675200,,437,5.477611940298507
