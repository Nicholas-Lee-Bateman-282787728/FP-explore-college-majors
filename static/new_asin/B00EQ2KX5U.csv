5933919,4,B00EQ2KX5U,"These are all good movies.  The Jekyll-Hyde story, haunted houses, unidentified bones, April Fool's pranks, stealing human organs, spooky stuff.  The only one I didn't really like was ""The Nines.""  I understood what they were doing but I didn't see why.  It left me confused about why I was watching it, and the ending didn't clear it up for me.

This is a good collection and a great bargain.",1453939200,24,393,4.63768115942029

5933929,2,B00EQ2KX5U,REALLY disappointed with this one.  Expected a collection of horror movies but really only a couple fit that description.  The Nines is a joke.  Might have been received better if it was not included in this collection.,1473811200,3,219,4.864864864864865
