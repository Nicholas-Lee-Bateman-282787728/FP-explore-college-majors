7912290,4,B00000JKYI,"I use this DVD in my leadership and employee training programs (w permission from PBS) and it's very well received. The 1 star reviewer should understand that Goleman was deliberately making the topic relateable, useful and reasonably entertaining to a non-scientific audience. I'm writing this so that others considering purchasing this for their own personal understanding of emotional intelligence, or to use an as educational aid for older children, teens and adults should nor be dissuaded from purchasing it.",1364688000,4,514,5.518987341772152
7912291,1,B00000JKYI,"For some reason I thought that since this was a PBS documentary that it would be science based and address how the brain interprets emotion or something social science related. Instead, it was a motivational speaker using anecdotal evidence as if it were real science and then telling me not to be afraid and that everything will be ok.
I guess I'll give ""this emotional life"" a try, but this one wasn't worth the time.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Emotional-Life/dp/B002Y7ZELW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Emotional Life</a>",1283040000,8,573,6.175
7912292,5,B00000JKYI,"I find this video in line with other informational psychology videos. It provides a broad overview of EQ. Some of the information is TMI for most audiences--the video is 45 minutes long. For the price, it's a good introduction to emotional intelligence.

I also use the BRAINS! video which, though it's far more expensive, has a faster pace and more engaging content (Hollywood movie clips and such). BRAINS! also comes with hours of activities to lead a group, so I imagine that's part of why it's so pricey.",1142553600,3,509,4.784090909090909
7912293,5,B00000JKYI,"I tried this video with a group of adults this week, dividing it into two days (the tape is 70 minutes). It was VERY popular! The material is well-presented, lots of plain-language information backed up by ""For example..."" stories and research, and the presenter is animated and easy to listen to. It's not a dull, droning lecture. Nearly the entire group of adults responded well, and even asked for information on ordering copies. Among the group were individuals with PTSD, substance abuse, depression, panic and anxiety attacks, work stress, marriage stress, etc., and this film had something relevant for each of them.",1094774400,9,623,5.117647058823529
7912294,4,B00000JKYI,"With the much better quality and convenience (it can be played on the road on a computer notebook for example) of DVD, it is surprising that there is no DVD edition of this tape. Is this intelligent?",1036540800,,199,4.405405405405405
7912295,4,B00000JKYI,"Dr. Goleman summarizes research linking ""Emotional Intelligence"", E.Q., to success in relationships, work, etc.  His presentation is engaging and humorous.  He reduces E.Q. to five dimensions: Self-awareness, Managing Emotions, Motivation, Empathy, and Social Skills.  For each dimension he explains its significance and provides useful examples.  The presentation ends with useful tips for applying the material in real life situations.  I found the research thought-provoking and practical.",980899200,53,492,6.393939393939394
7912296,5,B00000JKYI,"I purchased this movie for my intro psychology class. It has been a real hit with the students. It is practical application of important information. I use about 45 min from the middle of the tape for the most important concepts due to time constraints. If you have time, the whole  tape is very useful both personally and professionally. A great find for  psych and soc instructors. The presentation is clear and engaging. It is  fast paced for notetaking so I made handouts of key concepts. I say, ""Buy it! We all have  friends and family who can benefit from it!"" The books by Goleman are  also great buys on Amazon!",954633600,80,619,4.54054054054054
