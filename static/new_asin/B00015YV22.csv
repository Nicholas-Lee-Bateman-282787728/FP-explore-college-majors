8007091,5,B00015YV22,Great story line and I love the simplicity of the story that made you easily follow the story line. I can watch it again and again.,1389312000,,131,4.076923076923077
8007092,5,B00015YV22,"This film deserves a wider audience.  It's a good view of contemporary Japan but reminiscent in some ways of classic Japanese films by Ozu, Kurosawa, etc.  Moving.",1363046400,,163,5.0
8007093,5,B00015YV22,"It's hard to explain why this film moved me as much as it did. I found myself thinking about my own family, about the fleeting nature of the time we have with the people around us. The director allows the story to unfold slowly, yet the film rarely drags. An unexpected pleasure.",1253491200,,279,4.384615384615385
8007094,4,B00015YV22,"Objectively speaking this movie doesn't cover new ground. Rebel youth gets sent away to relatives in a 'healthy' environment(this time the countryside) to learn responsibility.

However.. The way the movie tells its story is incredibly moving.
Likable yet spunky characters, some fine acting and beautiful photography bring Firefly Dreams' world alive and within minutes you're drawn into the story.

Sometimes the old stories just work. I mean if it ain't broke why fix it?
This film is a great example of this. Recommended to fans of fine (coming of age) drama.",1216166400,,563,5.175824175824176
8007095,3,B00015YV22,"According to American director John Williams, the firefly, to Americans, is just a bug that lights up.  But in Japan, the firefly is a symbol of nostalgia.  Nostalgia plays a big role in this Japanese 2001 film where a 17-year old rebellious city-girl makes a transition and cares for an elderly woman with Alzheimers.

The character, Naomi, was based on his own experience and he said a few years after coming to Japan, he met a rebellious young girl and it reminded him of his own youth.

With her parents in a troubled marriage, Mom suddenly leaves; Naomi is sent to an work at an aunt's hotel, is  clearly unsatisfied and the aunt sends her to care for an aging woman with Alzheimers.  It is during this time that the two bond, share secrets, reminisce the past, embark on self-discovery, coming-of-age, etc.

Yoshi Minami, an 84-year old Japanese actress plays Mrs. Koide, an actress of the past who now has signs of Alzheimers disease.  Naomi is intrigued with the old actress and pursues a search for the film she starred in.

Although the theme about young kid forced to stay with elderly isn't new in Japanese film, the movie brings to mind the Korean film The Way Home, about a relationship between a bratty kid and his deaf and very patient grandmother.  To me, The Way Home offered much more and was more entertaining.  Firefly Dreams moved slow and wasn't memorable.

See Firefly Dreams also through the eyes and ears of the commentary feature by the director.  You will learn more about the symbolism and themes in the film.  It is helpful.  An interview with the director is also included on the DVD.

Cinematograpy was stunning!  .....Rizzo",1165449600,3,1656,4.714285714285714
8007096,5,B00015YV22,"Firefly Dreams is touchingly observed, lovingly filmed and depicts nuanced characters whose dramas will resonate beyond the rural Japanese setting. Other reviewers will give you the storyline; the director (not an English teacher, a Welshman teaching Film in a Japanese university) was nominated for a Best Director Award by the Japanese Academy.  The critical acclaim and international awards deservedly heaped on Firefly Dreams show why his second soon-to-be released feature is already creating a buzz. This is a filmmaker whose career is about to go stellar, and a look at this moving, assured debut will reveal why. The last shot is one of the most cathartic moments I have ever witnessed on film. This is a must-see film for fans of Japanese and international cinema.",1130112000,,773,5.184
8007097,4,B00015YV22,"...subtle, slow-moving, so beautifully shot, with understated humour and sparse dialog so you have to read between the lines (a bit *too* much, hence the lack of a 5th star).

I watched it twice straight through, the second time to hear the director's voice-over, which is pretty interesting too.

It is a film of its time - its time being the late 90s or early 2000s (Oh that hair! Those fashions!) - but the basic messages are eternal (as are the whining complaints by the girl...).

It's a good ""Coming-of-age"" film for teens, as well as for those who are nostalgic for Japan.

The story is described in other reviews, so never mind that, but although I like that you have to work harder to understand certain things that happen in the story-

 (at some point I thought, ""God he's making us really work for this, he MUST be a teacher!"" and indeed he is...)

-I was left especially frustrated re. the father and what happens to him. A bit too oblique.

All in all a lovely film though. Nice to see a bit of unspoiled Japan as well!

I have heard that, and can understand why, there are those who wouldn't be able to sit through it out of boredom. It's not an action movie, and don't put it on if you're feeling any pent-up aggression!

But it's a great film.",1121817600,6,1260,4.392241379310345
8007098,4,B00015YV22,"Marvelous in many ways, this film is confusing at times -- intentionally, pretentiously so, according to the director's own commentary.  If any director was poised to make a film based on both an intimate knowledge of Japanese culture (from years teaching in Japan) and an understanding of what the person in the West understands about Japan (and what needs explication), that would have been Williams.  It's a shame he did not take that opportunity but instead tried to make a strictly Japanese film (of a subject apparently already well covered recently in non-exported movies).

""Firefly Dreams"" is essentially a Japanese version of the Korean ""The Way Home""  -- bratty, spoiled, modern teen Naomi (Maho Ukai, credited as Maho), with her orange knit dress and bleached hair, is sent to help her relatives who run a country inn when her parents' marriage is on the skids.  She must cope with a simple cousin Yumi, and gets the task of helping the elderly Mrs. Koide (Yoshie Minami) who is losing her memory.  In the process she become .. adult, human.

Many sad things ensue, which I won't detail since that would give away what plot there is.  In spite of it all, Naomi makes a genuine friend of Mrs. Koide (as well as cousin Yumi), intrigued by her mysterious past, including a possible appearance in an obscure film, ""Among the Fireflies"".  The interplay between newcomer Maho and veteran stage actress Minami is a pleasure to behold. As the film ends, Naomi has found a copy of this film and we watch her watching the young Mrs. Koide.

Despite its lack of originality, the story is touching nonetheless and holds the interest.  The acting is good to excellent, and the cinemetography of the beautiful, unspoiled region of central Japan, Horaicho (in Aichi prefecture, only a couple of hours from Nagoya; definitely on my list of hoped for vacation spots!) is a joy to watch. The DVD commentary track is educational, both of the director's ego and of background for the film.  (Most of the cast,incidentally, was made up by local casting.)

Despite my carps this is an enjoyable and beautiful film.  You might want to wait until it's on the 5-day rental shelf, though (or,heck, go out and buy it), so you have time to watch the film, the commentary, then go back and watch the film again.",1094688000,5,2294,4.774683544303797
8007099,4,B00015YV22,"What an absolutely treasured find!
This exquisite piece from an English teacher in Japan (making his film debut) is a somewhat slow, simple tale that nonetheless captures the gorgeous environs of Horiacho -- a relatively untouched, uncommercialized region of Central Japan -- with a warm and captivating glaze!
The theme is fairly unpretentious. Our protagonist, Naomi, is a forlorn, rebellious seventeen year old girl from just about any Japanese city (in our case, Nagoya) whose parents bear the brunt of urban filial discord so common in contemporary Japan. She smokes, dabbles in forbidden activities (not uncommon for teenage girls in Japan), plays truant from school, and rattles off obscenities in front of her parents when they question her actions.
As a corrective penalty, she is packed off to spend some time with her grandmother in the countryside. Which naturally she initially detests. But things come around, she comes of age and to terms with her world, and discovers the follies of her own rebellions.
The movie's delicate handling of old versus the new is fascinating. The moments when the girl and her grandmother interact brim with common wisdom and affection. The girl's actions, though alarming to people not in the know, do not come across as cheap or startling. You end up caring for pretty much every character in the film, including a village boy who delivers chicken.
John Williams' script and direction are focused and allow the natural grace of the tale to unfold. But what absolutely swept me off my feet was the stunning cinematography of Yoshinobu Hayano that bathed the quieter, more introspective moments with glowing light and deep shadow. Not something you'd expect from a semi-indie banner, especially in a debut!
Overall, while it may be a somewhat lax-paced movie for modern tastes, I found that it unfolds delectably and reaches its credible resolutions quite effectively. Highly recommended if you're in any way interested in Japan.",1084233600,12,1973,5.16875
