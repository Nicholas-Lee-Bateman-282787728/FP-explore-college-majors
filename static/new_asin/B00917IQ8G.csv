5240755,5,B00917IQ8G,To me it's a very interesting and informative documentary.,1414713600,,58,5.555555555555555
5240756,3,B00917IQ8G,Fairly good documentary.  Thought that it was disjointed at times.  It does serve a useful purpose to inform.  I enjoyed it.,1401753600,,124,4.809523809523809
5240757,3,B00917IQ8G,"there is more to this story than just the evil empire under Putin and his minions. how did Khodorkovsky acquire his wealth??? really, how? behind every great fortune is a great criminal. tell us the whole story, not just parts of it.",1397520000,6,233,4.571428571428571
5240758,5,B00917IQ8G,"Well-Researched, In-Depth Reporting, Live Interview With Khodorkovsky From The Cage During 2nd Trial, Live Interviews With Former Yukos Lawyer And Other Former Yukos Managers. I think the documentary leaves no stone unturned.",1392508800,,225,6.0625
5240759,5,B00917IQ8G,"This is a difficult subject for documentry, yet it was done with fairness and completeness. I believe Khodorkovsky lies somewhere between Ghandi and Rockefeller. Perhaps this film will help ensure his release in August 2014.",1385078400,,224,5.428571428571429
5240760,4,B00917IQ8G,"Depending on who you believe, Khodorkovsky was either a villainous oligarch who profited unconscionable from the great privatization spree overseen by Boris Yeltsin after the fall of the CCCP or he was an overly brave reformer who, after seeing where corruption inevitably leads, decided to spearhead a campaign to clean up Russian commercial and political life.

The facts are pretty straightforward: Yukos, the oil company he controlled, was dismembered by the Russian government on the orders of Vladimir Putin and Khodorkovsky was found guilty of crimes so poorly defined and glibly presented that even Robert Mugabe's tinpot regime would have been embarrassed by such overt political strong-arming of a private citizen. Khodorkovsky remains in a Siberian prison camp to this day because Putin deems him too dangerous to release.

The most interesting thing, for me, was watching Putin himself. If ever one had any doubts that the President of Russia is nothing more than a little thug who is utterly out of his depth, this documentary dispels them completely. The scene in which Khodorkovsky, at the annual ""meet the President"" jamboree in the Kremlin, raises the issue of corruption is fascinating. Putin is clearly aware of the fact that in comparison to the businessman who has the audacity to wash dirty linen in public he, the nominal President, is merely a non-entity. Intellectually dwarfed by the Yukos' boss and incapable of grasping the importance of the problem of corruption in Russian life, Putin reacted by jailing the man who was willing to confront it. Out of sight, out of mind - this is the best Putin is capable of.

Russia's tragedy is that it is controlled by a venal and rather stupid clique incapable of grasping the fact that rent-seeking ultimately destroys the entire economy. No doubt Putin imagines himself Russia's savior. In reality he's its destroyer. Fortunately for his ability to sleep at night, Putin lacks the intellectual capacity to comprehend what he's done to his beloved country.

Meanwhile, the man who was able to grasp the issues and propose the most plausible solution remains to this day in jail, ignored by the West and suppressed by his own government. Russia, so full of intellegent and capable people, is doomed to stagnate and rot until nothing much is left. This documentary is simply the presage of things to come.",1366588800,,2372,5.074358974358974
5240761,5,B00917IQ8G,"Captivating story of a fascinating individual who is still imprisoned due to Putin's vendetta today. A depiction of a story that watches more like a movie, than a documentary. Well directed, unbiased and informative.

Great for watching at home or as a class movie for educational purposes.",1365379200,,290,5.170212765957447
5240762,4,B00917IQ8G,"The filmmaker scored some good interviews with colleagues of Khodorkovsky and his personal reflections added some character to the film. The computer generated interludes in the style of a graphic novel were a somewhat quirky but stylish touch that kept things interesting. If you want a better feel for Russia today, a good way to spend a couple hours.",1360454400,,353,5.0
5240763,5,B00917IQ8G,"This is one of the best documentary movies I have seen lately. The story of Mikhail Borisovich Khodorkovsky, the most powerful oligarch who became the most prominent prisoner and who remains a large thorn in Vladimir Putin's side is like the stuff of myth and dark age history. Yet it is the story of contemporary Russia, dexterously captured by the filmmaker Cyril Tuschi. As a close portrait of Khodorkovsky it shows a man of pride and many flaws but also a man of bold virtues. The documentary works also on a personal and microscopic level: all history and tragedy set aside it is the story of a dedicated young journalist who arrives in a country which usually does not welcome the press, armed with a camera and a notebook and who experiences all ups and downs of such a journey. Well as you can probably guess by now, I liked this documentary. But if you aim for a deeper understanding of the modern post-cold-war history and the political atmosphere in current Russia - this is the ticket.",1352246400,4,997,4.638418079096045

8533832,5,B00917IQ8G,"Excellent film, an outstanding example of political corruption and using whatever your system is to enact whatever the leaders want. I in particular
liked the part where the guy was relating the importance of human rights in a ""you've got to be joking me manner"". This is the real world. What a
big, rich (at one time), idealogical, stubborn, beautiful fool. Thank you Cyril for bringing this story forward.",1477785600,,407,4.913043478260869

8533839,2,B00917IQ8G,"Gave it two stars because if nothing else it was well produced agitprop. As it stands, this video was more like a one sided campaign ad for Kodorkovsky then a serious documentary.
If every convicted criminal was a billionaire we would probably would see many more self serving docudramas.
An unbiased movie which showed from where and why the ""oligarchs"" obtained the capital to loot the assets of the former Soviet Union would be fascinating and perhaps shed light on many of the international intrigues and conflicts which still threaten the world.",1415145600,3,550,4.989130434782608
