4080654,5,B00379AFXS,I always like funny movies on criminals. This movie is another one. I like the simplicity of the movie. It didn't try to be bigger than life. Tim Allen was humble in this movie and that shows his talent.,1277769600,3,203,4.230769230769231

4080656,3,B00379AFXS,"I bought this movie from Target and have never heard of it before. I only bought it because Tim Allen is in it. This movie boasts a real funny plot from the cover, but is hardly funny if not at all. The movie does not have a strong plot at all, he suppose to be out of prison, but the movie fails to push the issue and explore a little more deeper. It's missing a whole lot and I would recommend renting it first, before spending $20.00. It's ok to watch, if you are a big fan of the cast and love anything they do. Other than that you will be dissappointed!",1271894400,7,558,3.9910714285714284
4080657,2,B00379AFXS,"It's sad when the idea for a film ends up being better than the actual film. ""Crazy on the Outside,"" the directorial debut of Tim Allen, centers on a man who wants to get his life back on track after being released from prison, only to find that everything is much more complicated than he thought. As far as movie pitches go, this sounds pretty good. Not great and certainly not original, but good nonetheless. So how could it have gone so horribly wrong? On all levels, this movie is not even remotely convincing. The story is painfully contrived. The characters are flat and annoyingly quirky. The comedy is incredibly broad. Because this is Allen's first time in the director's chair, I can only hope that he will learn from his mistakes. That's assuming, of course, he's fully made the transition to film director. I have my doubts.

Allen has cast himself in the lead role, quite possibly because both he and his character have jail time and parole in common. This in and of itself is fine, although I fail to understand why it had to be depicted in a film with such a bizarre sense of humor. He plays Tommy Zelda, who has just served a three-year sentence for pirating DVDs; when he's released, he's brought back into the life of his sister, Vicky (Sigourney Weaver), who's awfully misguided in her attempts to make everyone happy. Their grandmother, for example (Helen Slayton-Hughes), has been led to believe that Tommy's three-year absence was because of an extended trip to Paris, where he got engaged to a beautiful French woman training to be an astronaut. Jeez Louise, if you're going to lie, at least come up with something plausible. This is but one of many lies concocted by Vicky, and while they aren't quite unforgiveable, they do come dangerously close.

Branching off of this are a number of subplots, each more chaotic for Tommy than the last. As part of his parole, he must find employment, and lo and behold, he's given a position at a tacky pirate-themed burger restaurant. Unfortunately, this conflicts with his master plan of rebooting his father's long-forgotten painting business. Meanwhile, he finds that he's still in love with his old flame, Christy (Julie Bowen), who's just shallow enough to believe that she can divide her time between Tommy and her fianc, a barely-seen electronics celebrity (Kelsey Grammer). And then there's his old partner, the snaky Gray (Ray Liotta), who continuously tempts him back into pirating with lavish gifts and promises of money and security.

But the silliest subplot of all involves Tommy's parole officer, Angela (Jeanne Tripplehorn), who falls in love with him against her better judgment. It's bad enough she's developed through contrivances, but to have a young son pressuring her to remarry, that's just plain wrong. Why do we think it's cute when a fresh-faced youth interferes in the love life of his or her parent, as was the case back when ""Sleepless in Seattle"" was released? It's not cute. It's manipulative and controlling. But never mind. In ""Crazy on the Outside,"" the kid's name is Ethan (Kenton Duty), a plucky little-leaguer who takes a liking to Tommy from day one. This doesn't make much sense given the fact that Tommy introduced himself by pushing Ethan off his skateboard. It seems that today's fatherless kids have drastically lowered their standards.

There are plenty of jokes all throughout, but I'm hard pressed to say that any of them are funny. Many of them can be traced back to Weaver's character. Do you see the humor in perpetuating a ridiculous lie to an old woman with a heart condition? Or in saying someone is dead when in fact that someone really isn't? Or in convincing someone that someone else has disappeared and needs to be searched for? The film passes all these off as lovingly sneaky acts, but in reality, this would be considered a form of cruelty. As well it should be. Some actors are too good for this low level of humor, and Weaver is one of them; she's both miscast and misdirected, and she seems to be under the impression that her character is somehow sweet and caring.

Other jokes, like the shenanigans of two of Tommy's fast-food coworkers, are equally dumb. They're also expected, since, apparently, all comedies these days must include one-dimensional side characters. Not expected is the idiocy with which the screenplay was put together. Did writers John Peaslee and Judd Pillot honestly believe that this movie could believably alternate between broad comedy and sappy drama? Successful comedy dramas are much subtler than that; they rely on actual plot development. ""Crazy on the Outside"" might have worked had it not gone in the direction of a comedy, playing up the friction between Tommy and Vicky and eliminating the ridiculous romance with the parole officer. Tim Allen is a decent enough actor, but if he ever wants to continue directing, the first thing he has to do is learn how to turn down a bad script.",1271635200,8,4945,4.840425531914893

4080692,2,B00379AFXS,"This a movie that had potential with quite talent pool in its cast, many of which have been on big TV show comedies, so if the writing was good, could easily have delivered. However the story-lines involving each of them don't take up much screen time, instead the majority of plot we see revolves around a love story between Tim Allen's character and his parole officer, played by an actor you likely haven't heard of who they know isn't going to influence anyone to buy this or not as she doesn't even make the DVD front cover image which has seven characters on it.  Movies of course have to suspend belief to some point, but I'm pretty sure it's against the keeping your job rules, for a parole officer to date an on parole inmate. Let alone how stupid it would be for a parole officer to have their kid hang around the reception area or an hallway lift foyer.  If an inmate doesn't want to go back to jail for not doing what their required or doing something wrong, there's someone you can threaten harm of right there. Yet the should or I shouldn't I romance is what this movie is all about, yet no character even mentions she could lose her job over this.

For me if the movie had gone with any of the other teaser plots it would have worked.  It could have gone with the sister's family doesn't really like brother out of jail storyline where everyone is lying to the grandmother that thinks he was in France engaged to a European astronaut instead of doing time.  But we hardly go there and you've two big names in J.K. Simmons and Sigourney Weaver in that house.  You've got two kids who I even forgot were in the movie and wondered who that guy was at a BBQ in the backyard before realising oh right he's the son, they had kids!

The demeaning have to dress like a pirate, fastfood restaurant work environment with two other parolees that rival the criminals from Home Alone in being stupid, could have been an entertaining one too.  Throw in an angry talking down their nose customer or two trying to con free food not realising the staff are ex cons and stuff like that and it could have been fun.  Combine it with a much more expanded girlfriend who has moved on to date the rich TV celebrity salesman (Kelsey Grammer) who your sister told you was dead and that's your movie right there.  Julie Bowen (Modern Family) although even with her character's faults looked way out of Tim Allen who looks every day of his age's characters league, but still if this was the movie it would have been a better one.

Even the Ray Liotta former partner who escaped doing jail time and wants Allen's character to pick up where he left off storyline could have had more time.  Granted I didn't really see why he needed Allen's character as it was just pirating DVDs and surely anyone could have done that or gone to San Francisco to pick them up, it would have made more sense if the crime was making meth or something and Allen was a Walter White style gourmet drug chef, but still this would have been a lot more interesting storyline with instead of the romance plot with the parolee it would have been him trying to do it under her nose without her finding out.  Perhaps her son could have found out and be blackmailing or getting Allen to do stuff for him so he doesn't tell his mother. Which would have made more sense then him instantly wanting Allen's old enough to be his grandfather character as his new daddy, after being pushed into a wall after providing directions and simply asking what he did to go to jail before Allen's character finds out he is the son of his parole officer.",1485043200,,3593,4.409365558912387

He pursues her and they have a wild night of passion, then he discovers she's getting married to Kelsey Grammar - a rich appliance-store owner. Guess what - eventually Tim tires of his old flame and falls for his parole officer! Ho hum.",1390608000,,603,4.69811320754717

It's a ""feel-good"" comedy - one of many that I have seen over the last 78 years that Hollywood has made but I've never experienced in ""real life.""

4080840,3,B00379AFXS,I expected this story to be a bit funnier.  Tim Allen acts a bit wooden throughout the entire movie...actually  he acts as if he is quite disinterested in the entire process.  The best scenes are with Sigourney Weaver interacting with Tim Allen and her extended family.  It is a movie best viewed on a rainy week-end day.,1368489600,2,321,4.578947368421052

4080847,5,B00379AFXS,This movie captured my attention. Very good plot and I wasn't offended by political correctness and unnecessary sexual content. Tim Allen showed he is still very funny. The cast was exceptional. The movie starts out sort of slow but builds up and I was absorbed toward the end.,1347062400,6,277,4.791666666666667
4080858,2,B00379AFXS,...But it wasn't.  Not a bit funny.  I was so disappointed in this film because I expected more from some of these actors.  Very bad writing.  Fake sets.  Acting sub-par.  Good premise gone awry.,1345075200,,195,4.588235294117647
4080859,5,B00379AFXS,this is a excellent no brainier laugh out loud comedy. excelllent Tim Allen with supporting Sigorney Weaver. Was a real pleasant surprise,1323388800,2,137,5.2727272727272725
4080860,4,B00379AFXS,"I've had actually quite negative initial approach to this movie, regardless Sigourney Weaver's involvement who is my favourite actress. That was mainly caused by many extremely negative reviews. It's shame on me as usually I try to judge all movies myself and never based on the reviews of critics who are very often doing weird statements. ""Crazy on the outside"" is an another example of underrated movie, totally crushed by critics.
I have really enjoyed that movie. It's a debut of Tim Allen (Galaxy Quest, Toy Story) as a director. He is also playing a guy, Tommy, who has just left prison and wants to start new life, far from criminal past. The story shows that it won't be very easy for him. He is fully supported by his crazy sister, played by Sigourney Weaver (who teams up with Allen again, after brilliant performance in ""Galaxy Quest"", 1999). And actually Sigourney, who isn't main character in the movie, is one of the best, if not the best element of ""Crazy on the outside"". Also watching Allen/Weaver scenes are very enjoyable. They are great comic team.
Of course story isn't brand new, dramatic conflicts are obvious, but this movie is great fun and provide solid, not stupid dose of humour.
DVD release contains good sound and picture. Lack of extras but it's really worth of your time.

4080861,5,B00379AFXS,"Great movie, Tim Allen is great as usual with his brand of comedy! Tim Allen has a spark, a something that keeps you into whatever he is doing.....not to mention this also has Ray Liotta, Sigourney Weaver and a few others.

Not a great plot by any means, and ex con trying to make it......but Tim Allen did actually serve a little time many, many years ago so he actually brings that to the role which most actors never do (and not that its a bad thing the other guys have not been to prison...it just makes his role more believable). Lots of silly childish humor with no real point other than cheap laughs.....which is refreshing!

So many movies today have to be big budget pieces of crap that want to teach you something or put out a message. I don't want to learn anything or hear any messages for that 90 minutes or 2-3 hours or whatever it is! I want to be entertained and forget about all the BS I deal with, am dealing with, will be dealing with, and so on.

That is what this movie does, it entertains you!",1310083200,6,1015,4.248704663212435
4080862,4,B00379AFXS,"I'll call this 'The Little Movie That Could', as in making my entire family laugh while coming out of nowhere. I think the funniest part of this film is Tim Allen's relationship with his off-the-wall and hilariously unhinged sister, Sigourney Weaver (paired again since ""Galaxy Quest""). The two of them had us in stitches from the minute she picks him up from prison and takes him back to her home to put him on a farcical familial display.  Everything she does is cunning, calculated, and definitely not the whole truth.

The tall tales she's compulsively spun, while her brother was away in ""France"", cause them both to trip-up constantly. She is so caught up in her own world of lies that I think she even believes them herself; she actually cannot control herself.  Her brother being in another country, and not prison, is what she starts conning the family members with. These hilarious excuses never cease, they just get more and more absurd.  She has his life all fashioned out everywhere and in every possible situation to save face for him and to account for his years in away.  The hardest part for him is that he has no idea ahead of time what excuse or the reason she has concocted while he's walking into these impossible scenarios clueless.  It's all ludicrous and wildly funny.

Allen underplays all the overtly comical parts in this film.  He seems to let all the rest of the cast shine, and they do as the cheap shots are abounding.  I hadn't even heard of this movie being released to theaters, let alone for a rental on Amazon. I just wonder where this one was hiding out. You get what you pay for with this one, and that's one funny time with a movie. We all loved it in our family (we do enjoy Tim Allen's humor).

There is a full ensemble cast in the movie (Ray Liotta, Kelsey Grammer, JK Simmons, Julie Bowen, Jeanne Tripplehorn, among others).  It was unexpected, although extremely inviting, to view each new actor come into play along with a witty script backing all of them.  Each and everyone shows up for their roles in good measure and good company.  A fun go-to movie that you will not regret if you appreciate the comedy of Tim Allen or are just beginning to.",1309651200,31,2191,4.558673469387755
4080863,4,B00379AFXS,"I don't understand my family's sense of humor or lack of it. I thought it was funny, and watched it a couple times. My wife loves to watch Tim Allen in movies and TV sitcoms, but hated this movie. I thought Sigourney played the crazy sister part well, and this was better than watching her chase aliens popping out of people's stomaches in space. Tim pulls off a serious role and throws in comedy in the same movie and makes it work, I guess I just don't know why it wasn't a big hit everywhere else?
Amazon on Demand on my Tivo and no worries, you don't like it, you don't own it, just the rental fee. works for me!",1297468800,3,616,4.141666666666667

4080865,3,B00379AFXS,"I expected more from Tim Allen. At least from the movies I've seen, he has put out some classic comedy. In this case, the movie has all the right stuff, but just doesn't come off that well.

The cast was great with Sigorney Weaver and Jeanne Tripplehorn, but every step was predictable. I was not surprised once. I don't mind that at all, but at least there should have been funnier gags to go along with it. In this case, it was at best mildly amusing. It didn't really have an ""at worst,"" which in this case isn't really a compliment.

I can say I've wasted time on far worse movies.

If you are into very mild rom-coms, I'd recommend it. If you are expecting more, I'd look elsewhere.",1288224000,3,687,4.310077519379845

So many bad reviews.
OK, we rented this movie for 99 cents.
In the first few minutes we both agreed that we had already gotten more than 99 cents worth of laughs.
It's not ""Theater in the round"" but, we really thought it was a funny movie.
Granted, it was  a bit predictable at times but:

the characters were great (4 out of 5 stars)
the plot was entertaining (3 out of 5 stars)
it was funny (3 out of 5 stars)
it was acted well (4 out of 5 stars)

I never would have paid full price to buy it new, but I paid very little and the entertainment value was ok. Tim Allen is much funnier on Home Improvement than in movies, at least for me. His comedy seems to work better there. But there are always funny moments so it was worth buying used, watching once, and then passing on to a friend or putting in a yard sale. Not something I would watch over and over. Sigourney Weaver was a pretty funny character in this movie. It's worth seeing once.",1278979200,6,641,4.219512195121951
