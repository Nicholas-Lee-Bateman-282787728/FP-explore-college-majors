6447782,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"Anyone (anime fan or not) who hasn't seen Steins;Gate is really doing themselves a great disservice. The overall plot is entertaining enough to hold you through until the real story kicks in and blows everything the show spent so long conditioning into you right out of the water. The characters are some of my favorite (while not necessarily the best) and are given great justice by the Funimation dub. The animation is clear and the ending song is one of my favorite songs in anime. Plus, to get a Blu-Ray/DVD combo for less than $50 a part? This is an excellent deal, for sure.",1410134400,6,580,4.586538461538462
6447783,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"If you haven't seen this series yet I won't spoil anything for you. All that you need to know is that you need to watch this series. Oh and Funimation did a great job dubbing this series, it's one of the few times that I would tell you to watch the dub over the sub.",1410048000,4,266,3.8545454545454545
6447784,1,B00KU3Y5CG,"I found this anime movie to be a dragged out plot that was stupid and boring as heck. I can deal with the corniness and comic relief, but it gets ridiculous after almost every scene of pure annoying hell. I can go on and on, but this is all I can say except...the graphics are great though......",1410048000,7,295,4.192982456140351
6447785,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"Steins;Gate follows Okabe Rintarou, a self-proclaimed mad scientist and his other fellow 'lab' members. But Steins;Gate is so much more just that. The reason I'm not posting a better description of this anime is simply because it is better to go into this show knowing little or even nothing about it.

The mix of the tones and themes of this anime feel completely original. Everything feels fresh, new and downright amazing.

From the realistic art to the good voice acting to the interesting characters to the amazing plot and to everything else, everything in this show I had no legitimate complaints about.

The only regret I had is aimed at myself for being too impatient and buying the two separate Blu-ray collections instead of saving money on this ""Anime Classics"" release. Just because I love this show so much, I might 'double dip'. Who knows?

Since the discs in this release are the exact same as the other discs in the other release, I might as well say how great this is on Blu-ray. In short, Steins;Gate looks and sound great on Blu-ray. Case closed. Stamp of approval by a Blu-ray collector.

All in all, I recommend that you watch this show right now. 10/10... best anime ever.",1408924800,101,1195,4.725961538461538

6447789,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"This is not your typical anime! Steins Gate explores the concept of time travel and is filled with all different emotions that will leave you wanting more. The first couple episodes are a little rough to get through since you have no idea what is going on, but if you have patience, you will not be disappointed! After you finish the series, make sure you watch the movie for the conclusion the shows creators originally intended!",1526256000,,430,4.671052631578948

Out of all them, after serious thought I give Steins Gate the #1 spot. I have watched and re-watched this series 4+ times and I cannot emphasize enough on how good the characters are and their development works. The story is full of interesting moments and twists. The humor is spot on and the art is great. The dubbed voices were also very spot on.

I whole-heartedly recommend this anime.",1525996800,,546,4.571428571428571
6447791,4,B00KU3Y5CG,"Absolutely love this series. One could almost call it, ""Time Travel, Practical Application""

6447795,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"I bought this because the show came recommended to me. The case and slipcover are very pretty, very sturdy. The picture quality is crisp and the sound comes in clear and nice.

I marathoned it all in about a day, 7 months ago, and I can honestly say it is one of the BEST anime of all time. Yes, I personally put it above Fullmetal Alchemist. There is not a single completely unlikeable character, the story is incredibly well written - Time Travel plots are especially tricky to nail, but this one is solid through and through. I can't think of a single series-breaking plothole. This show will bring you to hilarious heights, bring it all crashing down, drag you to a lower state than you thought possible, give you a glimmer of hope, crash you back down again, and then finally, finally lets you earn that happy ending.
It's incredible, and I reccomend it to everyone I see. I PROMISE you, you won't regret it.",1524268800,,913,4.5

6447797,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"I absolutely adore this series! The blu ray is barebones standard, as is nearly every blu ray from Funimation. Very simple menus are almost Funimations calling card, as well as a typo in subtitling here and there. I haven't watched through THIS blu ray so I am unaware of there are any errors, but if you love Steins;Gate then it is worth adding to your collection.",1524096000,,365,4.545454545454546

6447803,5,B00KU3Y5CG,Wow!  A great science fiction story.  I highly recommend it.,1521417600,,60,4.9
6447804,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"Hah, well... this came as an unexpected surprise. I rate most stories these days based on how much food-for-thought they supply me and Stein's Gate does not disappoint. As a fan of Attack on Titan, I was thrilled to find that the voice actors of Commander Ervin and Mikasa Ackerman are that of the protagonist and lead actress in Stein's Gate.

So, time travel is at the center of this story. No matter how it's told, there will always be unresolvable paradoxes. Stein's Gate takes a multi-verse approach to the subject which I found to be fresh and intriguing. Is it entirely believable? Hell no. But the story holds start-to-finish and the characters truly shine. All things considered this has become one of my favorite animes for the time being.

Highly recommend!",1521072000,,768,4.8106060606060606

The DVD was really good, and the quality it is what you got when this type of format. The Blu Ray is far superior, and the disks themselves look a way cooler too. The box is nice and as I previously stated not having a blu ray (planning to buy a PS4 in the future), was a very good plus to have the DVD version to be able to re watch the series.",1515456000,,480,3.6699029126213594

It peaked my interest that I sat and watched the show from episode one to end because the story will keep you hooked. It is a rare treat to find a show like this. I give it a perfect score and will recommend this! By the way I only watched it with SUBs so I have no idea of the DUB voice acting quality ( I know that this is a thing that can make or break a show if the DUB was good or bad ) Japanese voice acting was very good and the SUBs were very well done.,1515196800,,550,3.630252100840336

The twists and storytelling is so compelling that I've recommended this to several friends who weren't fans of anime to begin with but quickly loved the series when it was all said and done. The blu-ray set has impressive visual fidelity, a handful of features (commentaries and trailers mostly) and 5.1 English audio with Japanese original audio in 2.0.",1513987200,,511,4.885057471264368

6447838,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"If you haven't seen this show, stop reading reviews and BUY IT ALREADY!!! I can't see anyone watching through the entirety of this show and not absolutely loving it.

When I first saw this, I only watched the first 4 episodes when the aired in Japanese. Unfortunately, it uses a lot of scientific terminology, and the characters can speak fast sometimes, so I feel like I was lost trying to follow the sub. I couldn't get into the characters because of this language barrier, so I stopped watching.

All these years later, I finally went back and watched this show in English. Let me start of by saying, the cast is wonderful, and they put so much emotion and life into the characters. The story picks off a little slower, but it doesn't take long before you find yourself trying to binge watch the entire series in one day! I haven't played the game (yet), so I can't say how the story matches up to that. For the show, the art is gorgeous and flawless. The writing is just so good. I can't say enough good things about this show! You'll want to keep watching this show over and over again!

This particular set is a steal. It comes in a nice case, as well as a slipcover, and there is nice artwork on the inside of the case. The spine makes it look beautiful on my shelf. And the price can't be beat when you consider you get both DVD AND Blu-Ray. This could honestly sell for more than $50 and it would be worth it.",1507939200,3,1418,4.303370786516854

6447848,5,B00KU3Y5CG,I love and adore my complete series. This set provides you the blueray and dvd set both. This anime is terrific especially if you love mind benders and perplexing situations. It is constantly changing and holds that powerful dynamic that brings you to focus in a way that becomes second nature. There aren't really any cliff hangers but the evolution of the story and it's plot are designed lure you in because to get many of the references and twists you have to watch the next episode.,1502928000,,487,4.609195402298851
6447849,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"I'm generally not a fan of time travel stories, but this is just too good. One of the best anime series I've ever watched, with a beautiful presentation and great sound in this set. The English dub is really well done as well, and manages to capture the characters and emotions appropriately without having every character yell about everything to do so. I can't recommend this series enough, even if time travel makes you roll your eyes.",1502841600,,438,4.701298701298701

6447852,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"Steins;Gate is a series I was introduced to suddenly, and I subsequently binged every episode. I imagine I am not the only one.
At first glance, it's a modern sci-fi about time-travel, and while that's not wrong, it barely scratches the surface. Steins;Gate is more about the relationships the cast have with one another and how even the slightest change in the past can severely impact them and their futures. It's also about how Rintaro Okabe, the self-proclaimed mad scientist (and protagonist of this series), will do anything to ensure that the future has room for everyone - even if he has to keep trying again, and again, and again, and again.

There's so much to love about the entire cast, and the English voice talent is spot-on. The original Japanese audio is also available, along with English subtitles, so if subs are more your thing over dubs, you shouldn't be disappointed here.",1501718400,,894,4.8431372549019605

6447864,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"This is a great complete sci-fi time manipulation story that left me wanting more.  I didn't feel the predictability as seen in other anime.  The English voice acting is great and all the characters have some development  The series tries to incorporate some modern events, which even helps bring more of the story to life.  I am so glad that I purchased this and that I didn't have the plot spoiled from reading too many reviews.  It starts out slow but toward the end, I could not stop watching.

It is great that it comes in both DVD and Bluray.  I can take the low res DVD with me for small screens and the Bluray goes into my home theater system.  I only wish that the cardboard sleeve around the discs were a higher quality, I really like the series that much that I wanted it to feel more like a collectible.",1500336000,,815,4.315789473684211

Some damage on the side, and even worse a large barcode sticker was placed on the back, very hard to remove without damaging the box further.

6447869,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"This is a truly special series. I don't want to spoil any surprises, so I'll try to be vague but clear: Steins;Gate approaches time travel in a different way than I've ever seen before, and the characters show real, meaningful growth. The main character, in particular, can seem a over the top and perhaps even a bit annoying at first, but his depth is revealed as the show goes on. Starting out pretty light and funny, the series has a major tonal shift and adds emotional depth to the intriguing thought exercise of the time travel.

The animation is spectacular, the voice acting is excellent, and the plot is original and thoughtful.

The journey is amazing and the ending is extremely well done. From start to finish, this is without a doubt one of the best shows I've seen in years (anime or otherwise).",1498262400,,809,4.611111111111111

6447872,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"Just finished watching ""Steins;Gate - The Complete Series"" released by Funimation.
""Steins;Gate - The Complete Series"" is a delicious smorgasbord of an anime that breathlessly delves into time travel, conspiracy theories, murder mysterious, and the desperate attempt to change alternative world lines in an attempt by Mad Scientist Rintar Okabe, founder of the Future Gadget Lab, to save the two people he cares the most about - his childhood friend Mayuri Shiina and neuroscience researcher Kurisu Makise.  Because Okabe has accidentally turned the microwave into a time machine and has been using it rather innocently to change occurrences in the past, both Mayuri and Kurisu are slated to die horrific deaths unless Okabe can undo the damage done in alternative time lines and find the one time line that has zero divergence.  Only Okabe is able to reset the timeline because he has the unique ability of Steins;Gate - the ability to remember what happened before a timeline changed.
I was thoroughly engrossed by this anime series which was an excellent exploration of what happens when you carelessly play around with time travel.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

6447876,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"Taking place in Tokyo, Japan during the summer of 2010, Steins;Gate mainly follows the character Rintaro Okabe (J. Michael Tatum), a university student and self-proclaimed mad scientist. He is the founder and head of the Future Gadget Laboratory, a small organization based in an apartment dedicated to creating new technologies. Along with him are his long-time friend from childhood Mayuri Shiina (Ashly Burch) and expert computer hacker Itaru ""Daru"" Hashida (Tyson Rinehart). Rintaro is interested in the possibilities of time travel and attends a conference on the subject, but some strange events start side-tracking him until the whole world seems to change. However, only he can remember what the world was like before the change. Things become even more confusing for him when he encounters the young scientific genius Kurisu Makise (Trina Nishimura) whom he had previously seen dead before the world changed. Meanwhile, at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and Daru's experiments on a microwave oven seem to have given it the ability to send text messages into the past.

I first heard about Steins;Gate a few months ago through the original video game, originally released in 2009, that is available on Steam. I have always liked time travel as a mechanic in storytelling and the video game interested me. After playing through it, I was not disappointed and immediately fell in love with the interesting and complex storyline and the characters. It was inevitable that I would eventually check out the anime adaptation.

The anime adaptation follows the game's story fairly closely, though there are necessarily some scenes that were eliminated and details left out for timing. Still, the core story, following the ""true ending"" in the video game, is followed faithfully. That is the main attraction of a series like this. It is difficult to really talk about the brilliance of the story without going into spoilers, but I will give some idea as to what this story is about. As mentioned earlier, time travel is one of the main themes of this series. Rintaro uses this technology to make alterations to the past and notices what kind of effects they have, though not everything goes according to plan. Throughout the story there is the question if what they are doing is ethically correct, so there is a sort-of philosophical element to the storytelling. I also really enjoyed the integration of real-life elements in the story, most notably by making the story of John Titor (an individual famous for making postings on the Internet in the early 2000s claiming to be a time traveler from the future) an essential part of the plot. While some aspects of the show may be a bizarre to the Western viewer without a decent knowledge of Japanese pop culture or anime in general, it does not really detract from the story too much. The science fiction element and emotional responses of the characters are what really drives the story.

That is another bright spot of this anime: the characters. The cast itself is rather minimalist with only around a dozen characters, but they are well-written and memorable. Almost all of the characters go through their own journeys and experiences that reveal more about them than first appears and this keeps the show interesting. To take a few examples there is the main character of Rintaro who starts off by acting obnoxious and immature, but as the events of the story go on and he is tested again and again as he experiences the consequences of his decisions you find yourself rooting for him to ultimately succeed. Mayuri comes off as an airhead in the beginning, but as you learn more about her background and her relationship with others you start appreciating her good heart and honesty. Moeka Kiryu (Jessica Cavanaugh) is introduced as a rather mysterious person and socially inept, but her presence in the story becomes a major turning point and, despite what she does, by the end you sympathize with her as well. These are just some examples I can talk about without spoilers. Make no mistake, by the time you finish watching this series each major character will leave their mark on you.

When it comes to the animation itself, I am at a disadvantage since I am not that familiar with anything comparable. Aside from some Japanese anime films, this is the first anime television series I have watched since my days of watching things like Pokmon and Yu-Gi-Oh! when I was younger. Overall, however, I enjoyed it for what it is. This is primarily a character-driven story so there are no big action sequences. Still, as a means of telling its story, it comes off well.

The music is generally okay, though I must say it felt inferior to the superlative music composed for the video game.

This box set itself contains the complete series on both DVD and Blu-ray. This includes all of the original twenty-four episodes of the series plus a ""bonus"" OVA episode that acts as a postscript to the main story. There is the option to watch the dubbed version done by Funimation or the original Japanese voice work with subtitles. The original Japanese is a treat for those that have already played the video game as the main cast from the game reprises their roles for this anime. The dub is also pretty good, though with the usual adjustments for cultural differences. The Blu-ray version, which is the one I viewed, looks absolutely great with a nice, sharp image. I suppose the only disappointment here is the lack of bonus features. Aside from some trailers, the only bonuses to speak of are some audio commentaries on four random episodes done by the English voice actors and some other crew at Funimation. I usually like commentaries because of the insight offered into the creative process, but in this case it is overwhelmingly uninteresting as they just talk about voice acting and their own backgrounds.

In conclusion, this is a fantastic series that is likely to be enjoyed by those that like science fiction stories involving time travel. Indeed, this is easily one of the best time travel stories it has ever been my pleasure to experience.",1494892800,4,6106,4.899419729206963

6447881,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"Generally speaking, I don't really like animes with darker color palettes.  I also generally don't like psychological/thriller types of programs.  This anime is the glaring exception to those rules.

I love this anime.

The characters are just wonderful.  And their wackiness pairs well with some of the peril and the darker themes that are presented.  All the characters mesh well and are solid.  The only one who seemed a big weaker to me was Moeka.  But even she works well to drive the plot and doesn't take anything away.

I still have to admit that the color palette isn't my favorite, but it is well-suited to the overall theme and tone.

The music is wonderful.  That opening theme will get stuck in your head, but you probably won't mind.  Writing this review has got me thinking about it and I'm listening to it right now.

The dub is pretty good.  The first time I watched the series I stuck with the dub for about the first half.  But I still definitely prefer the sub.  As often happens, some of the voices of the American voice actors bugged me a little.  But these voices are much better suited than the voices for a lot of anime, so I can definitely recommend it for people who don't want to be reading subtitles the entire time.  The translation is also very good.  Very little is lost between the sub and the dub.

And not for the plot.  The plot is absolutely my favorite thing about Steins;Gate.  I will avoid spoilers.  At the beginning of the series Obake and Mayuri are going to a talk on time travel by a respected scientist.  Someone ends up getting stabbed and dies, but then almost immediately afterward they run into her just fine.  Some other strange things happen, and it turns out that Okabe and his partner Daru have invented some sort of time machine.  The rest of the series revolves around this time machine and the problems it solves and creates.  But that description doesn't even come close to doing it justice.  It is also a love story.  And the second half is very emotionally driven with Okabe showing just how far he is willing to go for the people he cares about.  The series finale does a wonderful job of bringing everything full circle, referencing the very first episodes that you will probably have forgotten about by then.  And the OVA that is also included is not strictly necessary, but it does a lovely job of tieing together the series in a way that is eminently satisfying.

Time travel is a very difficult subject to handle effectively in any medium.  But Steins;Gate finds ways to handle it with grace.  Very little about the time travel feels contrived and anything a little strange is easy to overlook, especially the first time watching.

I appreciate that this set comes with both blue ray and DVD copies.  Right now I do not own a blue ray player, but I know I will get one someday, so it is nice to have those disks to be able to watch then.

As I mentioned in the title of this review, Steins;Gate is my favorite anime of all time.  There are a lot that I like, but none so much as this one.  Hopefully my review has given you some idea of why that is.  I definitely suggest you buy it and watch it right now.",1494288000,,3172,4.448695652173913

The destination of the time travel is part of the goal but that's not the main focus of the show.  Most other shows (whether they're anime or live-action) don't go into detail about how their time machine works or if they do it's only a little bit.  This goes into more detail than most, but not enough to build one in real life, unfortunately :P.

If you like sci-fi ans suspense, this is the Anime for you. Steins Gate has a very in depth story that is even more rewarding the second time you watch it. That is not because its super hard to understand, its just good to see the details that the writers and animators put in details that could be easily not noticed that are used later in the story. Good visuals along side with a compelling story make this a must watch.

Overall, this sci-fi, suspense, time travel story is a great watch and is highly recommended.",1488931200,2,535,4.448979591836735
6447900,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"PROS:

- Cast of likeable characters.  Even the ones who do terrible things, you learn to care about.  More than anything else, I'd say the characters are what will pull you into the show's plot and keep you loving it, even after things really hit the fan.

- Intriguing mystery right from the very beginning.  Without spoiling too much, the show starts with one of the main characters being brutally murdered.  Then, with a simple text message, suddenly that character is not dead.  From there, things get really complex and interesting.

- Mostly lighthearted show (feels like a slice-of-life or even at times a sitcom), but there's a very dark current underneath.  Horrible things happen, but the show balances that with some lighter moments.

- Beautifully drawn.

CONS:

- As I mentioned above, the show does take some very dark and horrific turns on occasion.  Because you care about the characters, it is shocking and tense to see what they have to endure.  Be ready to have your heart broken a couple of times.

- Because of the intricacies of the plot, if you aren't paying careful attention, you will likely miss some details early on, and those details are likely important.  But that will just make you want to rewatch it to see what you missed.

OTHER THOUGHTS:

In case the show's description doesn't mention it, this show is about time travel.  It reminds me in some ways of The Butterfly Effect and Groundhog's Day.

I don't recall ever hearing of the real life internet meme of John Titor, but the show does a brilliant job incorporating it into the plot.

My suggestion:  give it a watch.",1488758400,19,1606,4.701438848920863

6447958,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"- Synopsis: An anime that starts off with friends hanging out trying to discover the method to using a time machine. One day, they accidentally discover it. At first, it turned out to be just for fun as they continued to humor themselves, but then the group starts heading into dangerous territory as they dig deeper into the unknown. They find many shocking secrets that they cannot go back on; as they become targeted by various and shady organizations. Curiosity killed the cat. A saying that the main character will painfully come to understand as he attempts to reclaim the life he originally had.

===========================================================================================================

- Comments: This anime is very suspenseful. Moreover, the characters are pretty likable. Which makes it easier to develop sympathy and empathy towards them. Because like many things in life, not everything is so cut-and-dried or black and white. As the anime becomes more serious, you can't help but sympathize with the main character. It's very well done. Even though they are fictional characters, this anime in particular effectively absorbs the audience and leaves them in suspense. Like an addiction: wanting more and more.

- Analysis: I also liked how they touched up on concepts such as time travel. I'm sure many of us, especially as kids, fantasized about this. So, it was pretty cool how they were talking about this concept but in a more nerdy and scientific way. Further emphasizing or playing around on the idea that it may exist; we just don't have the knowledge or means to go about it.

- Features: English and Japanese audio, as well as English subtitles. Includes 25 episodes on 4 Blu-ray disks and 25 episodes on 4 DVDs with a run-time of about 10 hours. Rated TV-14 for violence, and sexual content.

- Conclusion: An anime with lots of exposition which is suitable for more mature audiences. Reminds me of the Twilight Zone in many ways.

In general, all of the characters are likable, if a bit frustrating to watch at times. You will find yourself getting frustrated with their inane banter, with the use of pseudonyms, with the repetitiveness of much of the plot, and for gods sake, with all the texting they do during the series. Despite this, the voice acting, and to a lesser degree, the very plot itself leads you to feel for the main protagonist as he tries to right the world and save his childhood friend (and then his love). You see just how much stress he is under. You hear just how anguished he is as he struggles time and time again to save her. You see how the outside machinations of the evil SERN lead him to heartache and grief.

Despite the fantastic emotional expression and some interesting concepts, I have to call this one a near fail for the needless perversions and fan service sc porn thrown in here and there. Also, the almost 5 episodes dedicated to the time traveling trani leave much to be desired
.
Despite these reservations, I still have to give it a four out of five for the exception expression of just how dangerous time travel would actually be. Additionally, the voice acting is very good.",1476489600,,1461,4.637065637065637

He suggested we watch start with this one, which is one of his favorites and I thought it is a good starting point into anime since it's relatively short (24 episodes in all plus a bonus clip).

I wasn't expecting to enjoy it this much, but this is one of the best animated shows I've ever seen. The characters are engaging and funny and are just all-around good people, and the story is complex and unpredictable but also makes complete sense in retrospect.

It's hard to write a time-travel story that stays consistent. (For example, I enjoyed ""Looper"" but there are some paradoxes that they don't resolvemost stories involving time traveling have similar issues.) But they really nail it with this one.

And the animation is beautiful. It's slow moving, but this seems to be an intentional choice by the animators to capture the beauty of the world that they created.

6448123,4,B00KU3Y5CG,"The show is fantastic. If all that needed to be rated was the video and plot it's easily 5 stars. But there are a couple things that have disappointed me after I had, honestly, sky high expectations for this blu-ray.

- The video quality is superb. This is to be expected. But it's worth noting because this is a great looking show. It's not super action packed or flashing. But there are some really beautiful scenes.

- The dub is very good quality -- for a dub. None of the english voice actors are painfully annoying. Some of the actors are actually quite good at times. But near the end I found the dub's translation to stray too far from the true dialog, which I was already familiar with. I had to finish the series with subbed Japanese audio because it is really that much better. I found the main character, Okarin, to be less endearing overall when watching the dub, but it was usually bearable.

- The subs are very good but not perfect. I have seen better subs for this show on a web stream. There are some annoying minor grammatical errors. And there are also parts where I think the sub translation is either not completely accurate or the sentence structure was poor enough to interfere with its interpretation. But overall, as stated first, the subs are good. Among all translations I have seen of Okarin's playful title for Daru, ""hakka"" . I believe the blu-ray subtitle translation to ""haxor"" seems the most correct with the context provided by the show. The dub translation has Okarin referring to Daru as a ""hack"" which is more derogatory.

- I haven't yet viewed all of the bonus material in the collection, but I am happy with the amount of content provided. It seems like there is commentary on almost every disc (though most episodes do not have commentary). There are a lot of trailers for the show too. And seemingly all variations of the intro/outro songs are included on the final disc.",1461369600,2,1914,4.571428571428571

6448142,3,B00KU3Y5CG,"I used to be a big fan of anime. Not so much anymore. I find I can't stand most of the stuff that is popular with the otaku crowd since DBZ became popular in America. The anime I tend to like is usually obscure. Steins;Gate isn't that, but it's also not championed by man-child weeaboos with bad taste. After reading the story synopsis on the back of the box (and else where), I was given the impression this was going to be one of those crazy over the top out of control Japanese sorts of animes that I would like.

I won't lie, the price for the complete series on DVD + Bluray played a big role in convincing me to take the plunge.

Unfortunately what I wound up watching is a hot mess in terms of story. Steins;Gate is very slow to build up. It only really begins to get interesting/exciting when you reach the second disc. As soon as it seems things are going to go full on crazy sci-fi time travel conspiracy, it suddenly back pedals and becomes a Groundhog Day like character drama. Just about everything the story builds itself upon in terms of background and development is discarded and the time travel aspect becomes a plot device for going back a few days over and over to break a seemingly unbreakable fate involving a character who becomes destined to die. This causes the plot to shift focus away from where it seemingly was going, and it becomes a character drama. A somewhat stereotyped one. If you aren't expecting the show to do this, and are expecting it to live up to being some sort of sci-fi thriller, it is an extremely disappointing experience.

Steins;Gate does set itself apart form other anime by being different and unusual, however its too inconsistent to recommend. Frequently the plot loses track of itself, and sometimes it seems like the writers didn't quite know how to handle their story in terms of transition. As I said above, it starts out with a goofy foray into time travel stuff, kind of sets itself up for something more serious involving a conspiracy, and then it very quickly moves away from that and begins devoting whole episodes for each side character with preventing the unbreakable fate serving as the story arc for half the series. When it returns to serious conspiracy time travel, it feels disconnected. Its abrupt and not a smooth segue.

overall Steins;Gate is okay. Its not something I'd tell anyone they absolutely have to watch. Its not bad either. Its one of those you won't miss anything if you never see it, but if you do see it, it'll be entertaining enough to watch all the way through, but be one of those watch once never watch again affairs.

I will say this about Steins;Gate though. For something that takes place in Japan, it makes an insane amount of references to American culture in regards to both consumerist and internet culture. Its so tied up in it, I couldn't shake the suspicion out of my head that the basis for this anime is completely inspired by Americans, but is set in Japan with Japanese culture because the writers don't have much to go on with American culture outside of Dr. Pepper, John Titor, and 4chan.",1458604800,7,3095,4.56936936936937
6448143,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"I decided to pick up Steins;Gate after seeing many recommendations all over Reddit, and the hivemind did not disappoint. The show starts off a little silly, quirky, and fun, but whenever the storyline gets serious, it does not let up -- I was positively glued to the screen (and shouted at my television a little more than I'd care to admit) from the halfway point on. If you're a fan of time travel stories involving parallel worlds and paradoxes therein, you are sure to sink your teeth into this story and its wonderful characters within.

As an added bonus, the English dubbing cast did a wonderful job reinterpreting the dialogue -- honestly this is one of the few animes that I have seen where I can say that I preferred the English dub more than the original Japanese with subs.",1458432000,,785,4.607142857142857

The plot itself intrigued me (although nothing original) as it deals with the concept of time travel. However the thing that ultimately made me take this out of my blu ray player and print out the return label were the characters. The male characters specifically are pretty sexist, creepy and just overall cringe worthy and there's absolutely nothing that makes them standout. The female lead seems interesting and probably the only good thing about this show however isn't able to live up to her full potential because of the objectification of women this series loves to implement. I won't bother with the other female characters because it just so much more worse with them.

Now, I don't go looking for anime based on whether it's feminist, politically correct, has an insane amount of diversity, etc. but when it goes to the lengths that Steins;Gate does with the objectification of women is just simply unbearable.

6448149,4,B00KU3Y5CG,"My first impression, after starting the show, was that it was going to be one of those, people just act nuts, type of shows. But once you get past the first few episodes, the show really starts to get good. I think my problem with the first few episodes was, that it was a lot of him just running around, acting like he is a mad scientist, and just acting kind of crazy and stupid. All this does tie in later in the show, so it does make sense, but it just kind of mundane at first. I think that if they would of put more of a story line, and plot type of thing, in them, then it would have been good from the start, but those first couple seemed more like filler episodes, then main show ones. After those first few though, the show really started to get good, and kept me coming back for more..

Basically, without giving too much away, this is basically about this guy, that claims to be a mad scientist, but in reality, is a broke guy, that relies on his friends to get stuff done. He is smart, and does have a good interest in science, but if something needs done, he is always having others to things to get them done. Later on in the show, he starts to get more interacting with what is going on, and less crazy. He also has this obsession with naming other people things to suit him. I think he just can not remember their names at first, and it is easier to give them a nickname. Well, he, more kind of like, stumbles on time travel, and how it all works, then discovers it. Different stuff all working together, just happen to be at the right place, at the right time. So they do a lot of experiments to see what happens, and to see if they can make things more stable and reliable in the experiments. and killed a lot of banana's in the process. Add in big greedy corporations that will do anything to get this info, changing time lines, etc, and that about sums it up.

Overall, I got to love the show once I got into it, and got past the first few episodes. I probably would have stopped after the first couple, if I had not bought the show, but since I did, I figured, mine as well watch the whole thing, and now, I am glad I did. Just know, if after the first couple episodes, you get bored, or feel it gets mundane, keep going, it gets a lot better. I think when it really starts getting good, is when they start getting more people in the group too. They start off with 3 members, and by the time they are done, they have more like 7 members.",1457568000,,2459,4.11018711018711

Whether you like anime or not, this show has a depth and entertainment value that rivals even, in my opinion, Oscar winners.

I was somewhat skeptical when some friends of mine recommended this series to me and said it was among their top five anime series. I started watching it, and it starts out somewhat slow at first, but it serves to introduce the characters and really let you get to know them on a personal level. I found myself many times laughing out loud or smiling at the character's dialogue and even rewinding some scenes or rewatching episodes to make sure I understood everything going on. Really, this series is amazing. Engaging characters, a story that will keep you interested till the very end, a heavy science influence (I'm in engineering school so I love it :3), and some philosophical elements that bring it all together to make it one of my favorite series I have ever seen.

Im a fan of animes like cowboy bebop, outlaw star, claymore, elfen leid, and to my surprise steins gate surpassed all of those shows.

6448169,4,B00KU3Y5CG,"Aside from the VERY casual anime fan, just about everyone knows about Steins; Gate at this point.  Many an anime fan are calling it one of the greatest series ever made.  And while I highly disagree with that assessment, Steins; Gate does several things impeccably well, despite a few major shortcomings.

Getting the shortcomings out of the way: Steins; Gate was originally a visual novel/dating sim.  Granted, it was a very good one, but the translation of a dating sim to a series has always presented problems, and Steins; Gate does not escape these trappings.  Primary is the issue with series structure.  You are the protagonist.  There are girls.  You get to know the girls.  Etc.  In the game you go down routes, and each route you get a short feeling out period for all the girls before you go full swing into one's story.  The issue with bringing this to a series is, well, either you're cutting out most of the girls at the expense of one, or you're trying to cram in everyone's story.  Steins; Gate, like most, chooses the latter route, and at this point, there are two more possibilities: trying to cram in a little of each girl each episode (which is more real to the world, but stalls pacing), or focus on one at a time, in arcs (pacing is maintained, but the rigidity in the storytelling and plot convenience which arises is highly unrealistic).  Steins; Gate goes with the latter.  During the first half (literally exactly the first half, 12 out of 24 episodes), we're introduced to each girl one at a time, and a ""problem seed"" (as I'll call them) is planted for each one.  During the second half (last 12 episodes), our protagonist deals with each problem, one at a time, in reverse order.  There is a reasonable excuse for why the second half is set up the way it is due to the plot, but the first half has none.  It's formulaic because the formula is easy and sets up the second half, which is unfortunate.

The other major problem is that, also a common major problem in visual novel adaptations, is characters.  We get one AMAZING character, a solid foil, and a bunch of stereotypes with the supporting cast.  Mayuri in particular is such a blob of moe nothingness that it's actually a little aggravating that she's the protagonist's main motivation.

Now, on to the good stuff:

As I mentioned, we have one AMAZING character, and that's our protagonist, Okabe.  He's hilarious, insane, brilliant, and caring.  And since he is VERY much the focus of this series, many of its shortcomings can be forgiven.  Watching him experiment with time manipulation, the scenarios presented to him, the highs and lows, the choices he has to make, how he reacts to everything, is what makes this show special.

Makise Kurisu (or ""Christina"", as Okabe calls her) is a solid foil to his zaniness, and the girl we undoubtedly spend the most time with, as she assists Okabe in making right all the wrongs his experiments have caused.  She's cool, calm, and collected, and one of two characters to really come across as being human.

Lastly, perhaps what the series is most lauded for, is its historical and theoretical accuracy.  I don't wish to spoil much, but the series implements real world ideas and events into its plot and explanations not only better than any sci-fi anime, but better than most sci-fi period.  Pseudo-science bulls***, this is not.

So, how much you like this is, as always, going to depend on who you are.  If you're a writer obsessed with intricate plot structure, this ain't gonna scratch that itch.  If you're a science nerd, it will.  And if you think Okabe is the s*** (he is), it will.  All in all, this is definitely worth your time, if not the flawless masterpiece some would have you believe.

6448172,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"This anime is adapted from a visual novel, which I just finished playing a few days ago and which totally blew me away. I decided to watch this series too, and it turns out it is also very good and enjoyable. Some of the episodes might seem boring, but your patience will be rewarded as the last few episodes are spectacular and completely worth it.

However, it is disappointing to see how much was cut out to fit the 24-episode format of the anime. We see a lot less of the protagonist's internal thoughts (which make for some very powerful scenes in the VN), we miss out on backstory for several characters, we miss out on a lot of the theoretical physics and highly detailed time-travel logic, and we don't see the five alternate endings of the VN, which were all just as worth seeing as this ending.

I do not think the anime is as visually impressive as the VN either. Ironically, the anime characters show much less emotional range through their facial expressions than their VN counterparts, and the anime backgrounds are so plain it often feels like you are watching a slideshow. These elements limit the potential of the emotionally intense moments of the story.

The anime does add to the source material in some small ways, through added flashbacks, recurring visual motifs, usage of multiple perspectives to tell the story, and a fuller visualization of the cast and the setting of Akihabara. There is also an OVA (Episode 25), which is a story unique to the anime. This story is very charming and provides some much-needed closure after the viewer's long journey. In preparation for the sequel Steins;Gate Zero, a teaser alternate version of Episode 23 has also been recently released. It is worth checking out after watching this entire series.

Overall I enjoyed both, but the anime is simply good while the VN is absolutely great. The visual novel is a more complete and emotionally impactful experience, and I believe it is worth it to play that first, completely unspoiled. But whatever you do, at least check out one of these two options, if not both!",1454198400,,2071,4.728531855955679

Even when the main mechanism of the story kicks, things still seem whimsical until the third act, when everything gains an edge.  I have not been able to go through the game yet, so I don't know how much is new to what the anime brings, but I appreciate how low-tech (and more realistic!) the initial machine is, even as things escalate past where I feel possibilities end.

This anime is top notch, I finished it recently and to say ANYTHING negative is really, really, really looking at under a 100x microscope and based entirely on personal preference. The description for this show does not scream its sheer amount of perfection at you and I beg that even if you do end up watching this somewhere else..This is one of those things we need to fight for... Listen,

The voice acting here is spot on. The artwork is very good. The characters here are all vastly separate from each other, and their interactions are believable. The story is told in a masterful way, as just writing a story like this can be close to an impossible task. The story itself is one that can only be seen as great, regardless of belief.

But what really got me here, is how well the characters are portrayed. They in themselves are believable at every moment in the show, they stick and stay true to who they are, regardless of the situation they find themselves in. When something terrible happens, someone doesn't flip out and change characters is a non believable way, or when something great happens it doesn't turn our mad scientist into some cute impersonation of a children's show actor.  All of their reactions to this fantastic story, hold this fantastic story up into one that needs to be seen, it should not be a question to you.

Sure, you don't know me or my tastes here, but your going to have to trust that I do not write reviews for anime, I do not recommend anime as here in America its generally looked upon as a bad thing, and I rarely find any anime anymore that tells anything but a ""David vs Goliath"" story of ""oh im weak"" ""Not anymore because passion anger rage depression! D:"" and when I do they are rarely good stories.

This one..needs to be seen. It doesn't matter if you like anime, or if you hate animation or cartoons for some reason or have some bias towards live action or sub or dub, ive watched both, and they are equally impressive to me.

If I could, and still may, I would stitch every episode together to watch this show in a single sitting without breaks if my time would allow. Once you see it, you will understand that this is not your common anime, and it saddens me to know I have to go back to the simplicity of the anime I know, or the tv shows and movies I watch, because whereas for things I love I don't normally allow to finish to allow me to rewatch them again and again, I needed to know what happened.

If your interested to see something someone could review in this manner, regardless of if you buy it here, and im certain after seeing it youll be screaming money out of your lungs at your screen to get it, then you have to watch this.",1449705600,,2964,4.355072463768116

6448199,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"Quirky, oddball, perhaps even slightly mad but ultimately endearing characters make yet another cautionary tale about the consequences of time travel into one of the most memorable, heartrending tales you will ever watch because this isn't just a story WITH time travel, but rather a story ABOUT time travel, about how it can go horribly wrong.  Self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintarou Okabe attends (and disrupts) Dr. Nakabachi's seminar on time travel and has a number of unsettling experiences that will eventually mean much, ending with seeing Kurisu Makise lying in a pool of blood.  His almost inadvertent text to ""Daru"" Hashida, who was conducting experiments with his cell phone hooked up to a microwave at the time, triggers the first temporal anomaly, in which past events have changed leaving only Okabe to remember them.

What follows are several mostly lighthearted episodes in which Okabe, Daru, and a very much alive Kurisu Makise conduct experiments first to prove and then to understand and improve upon the time travel mechanism they have stumbled upon, including allowing some of their friends to try to alter past events more to their liking.  This builds slowly to a cataclysmic event at the end of episode 12 and several shocking reveals.  Now the show's tone grows increasingly dark as an increasingly frantic Okabe, who is the only one able to fully remember all the time changes, attempts to undo the horrific events he unintentionally unleashed or caused to be set in motion.  With the aid of a Kurisu Makise he must repeatedly explain the time changes to, can Okabe leap backwards through time carefully enough to fix the mess he has created?

And can he bear the ever increasing emotional cost?

IMHO these last two are nice-to-haves fans will wish to watch at least once, particularly the movie as it first presents another obstacle to a HEA ending and then pretty cleverly resolves it while tying off a few loose ends left over from the show.

Note: Steins;Gate began as a visual novel available in various formats.

Note: A new visual novel Steins;Gate 0 and a new Steins;Gate 0 anime series will be coming out that begins with an alternate version of episode 23: SG0 OVA: Episode 23(Beta) Open the Missing Link, in which Okabe gives up in despair where in the original he pushed on to change from the Beta Attractor Field world line to the Steins;Gate world line.  Presumably this will turn out to be the Okabe who will actually build the C204 time machine and send the video D-mail that inspires his earlier self NOT to give up.

Note: There have already been a couple of visual novel sequels to Steins;Gate that have never been given anime versions and probably never will because their target audience of true blue fans who love any additional material about these characters is too small.  One of these is ""Steins;Gate - Darling of Loving Vows"" a largely lighthearted romp taking place on the Delta World Line, where SERN and WWIII are not threats, no one is trying to kill anyone, and the greatest choice facing Okabe is who to fall in love with.  Based on viewing some game play videos, the choices and endings are a mixed bag: Ruka's and Moeka's are downright cringeworthy (because the authors apparently couldn't come up with a plausible plot), Faris' is the weirdest (picture ALL of the feminine characters in cat maid costumes and Kurisu as the Hell Maid, all tsun, no dere), Kurisu's is the funniest (she invents a future gadget, ""Darling Is an Idiot"", that forces she and Okabe to stay within a meter of each other at all times and not to argue on pain of electrical shock WITHOUT providing an off switch), Suzuha's is the odd man out (she must deal with the catastrophe of Daru falling in love with her rather than with her mother he is supposed to be meeting in just a few days), and Mayuri's is the most moving (her character, previously noted for her general ditziness, displays more complexity and emotional depth in this story than she has in anything else I've seen; the childhood friend flag has definitely been activated!)

The other is ""Steins;Gate - Linear Bounded Phenogram"" a collection of scenarios set during and after the original visual novel's story line, but in different world lines.  Based on viewing some game play videos, the scenarios and endings are once again a mixed bag, but what makes these short stories rather unique is that unlike all the others which are told from Okabe's POV, these are told from the POV of the main character.  Several of these are hero's journeys: Daru's, Faris', even Moeka the Rounder gets one.  Kurisu's contains the clearest statement of her feelings about Okabe.  Suzuha's is a weird one with three versions of herself showing up.  Okabe's first one and Tennouji's are more than a little cringeworthy until their shock endings.  Ruka's and Mayuri's veer from expected paths into surprise endings.  Okabe's second involves the first failure of a time leap to fully transmit memories into the past and the confusion this causes, and Nae's seems unfinished.",1447459200,5,7435,6.124038461538461

6448202,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"A must see, and not just for anime fans. Though starting out one must keep in mind that the story is written as a whole with the end in the creator's mind from the beginning and you will not get a true appreciation for this work of art until you have seen the whole thing. It is worth watching a second time to appreciate that aspect. The characters are also somewhat annoying at first, but not because they are bad characters. Rather they feel human; they have their own flaws and motivations and histories right from the beginning and the anime does not take time for exposition into these, rather they let the characters and their actions speak for themselves. Since the characters are all ""human"" there is no go to relate-able character whose shoes you can put yourself in. This is exceptional, unique and makes for a fantastic stage for such an amazing story to take place. The world is internally consistent (they don't break their own rules set from the beginning like some science fiction) so the world feels like our own. The ending feels like the product of the characters, the world and their positions in the world when they begin. Everything follows logically from the scene before it yet it does not fall into the trap of predictability or cleche. There are some fantastic twists and reveals to be had.",1447200000,,1316,4.628205128205129

Once you begin watching this , you never can stop it .
You will feel fear , sorrow , despair , and finally  catharsis.
 I could not help crying when I knew how kind Okabe was to his companies.

If you are any fan of anime, whether just a casual DBZ/Naruto/AoT fan or a hardcore otaku who has seen the sun more on your television than real life, this show is a must watch. Between an absolutely brilliant cast, a very well done English dub (won't comment on the Japanese dub as I have not watched it), and one of the best stories you will find anywhere, it's an absolute rollercoaster that you won't want to get off of. Granted, the first few episodes can, and probably will, leave you feeling slightly confused. Fight through it. Once you reach around episode 4 or so, the story starts to fill in the gaps you feel were there and by that point, you're already gonna be addicted. Also, this series alone is worth buying just to hear ""Doo do doo"" (or ""Tuturu"" for the sub viewers) every five minutes or so. Seriously, why are you still reading this?

There are many instances of ""u"" instead of ""you"", words that spelling is similar but don't sound alike and various basic grammar issues (Japanese version English subs). My problems are with the subs not the translation. If you are going to sell something make sure you don't use text speak..

That being said it's a great show reminiscent of Donnie Darko in its lightness then ramping up to dark. It mixes some science and philosophy (sometimes accurate sometimes not) for an exciting show. It's wordy, not an action anime and requires some thought. I would suggest the anime if not the subs",1440547200,,723,4.830645161290323

6448233,1,B00KU3Y5CG,"I watched the series and was disappointed.  For those who value their time, my humble advice.  After viewing the first few episodes you'll get a sense if you want to hang out with these characters for another 9 hours.  If you do, go for it!  But if they annoy you, don't expect the second coming when the plot/ story kicks-in because, even then, you'll still be sitting around most of the time hearing and seeing these folks interact; which can be grating if you don't like them.  I kept reading reviews, everyone pointing to the halfway mark (5hrs in) where it gets better.  While true, you're still stuck with these characters and their incessant dialogue for another 5 hours; don't expect it to turn into an action fest.  What I'm saying is, It's still largely a dialogue driven affair, for better (if you like them) or worse (if they annoy you).  So use your time wisely.

Summarized pros/cons:
+
Good voice acting (English dub)
Awesome theme song
Good job explaining the time travel, easy to follow
Animation
Gave you a sense you were part of their lab (team member)
A few episodes kept you interested in wanting to know what would happen next (cliffhangers)

-
Overly dramatic, mushy, cute
Too much dialogue (getting to know characters), too little story
The basic tenets of storytelling (5) were imbalanced in this series:
 70% Dialogue (What are they saying?)
 10% Inner Monologue (What are they thinking?)
 10% Action (What are your characters doing?)
 5% Exposition / Narrative (What other information does the narrator (you) want us to know?)
 5% Description (What are they seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, and smelling?)
Took way to long to get to crux of story, characterization is VERY SLOW (5hrs before things get going)
Characters too quirky, goofy, unbelievable (young cute friend, weird FB agent)
Conversations seemed overly silly, corny and cheesy.  Generally comedy wasn't funny.
Motivations seemed fake (a Dad attacking his daughter, FB agent)
Unlikable characters (Main character, Main female lead, best friend, downstairs neighbor, etc)
Too much focus on Anime/Otaku culture, took away focus from main plot (time travel)",1438387200,6,2146,5.036827195467422

I don't want to say much about the story, but I will assert that it is complex, to say the least.  It may even take a second viewing to fully understand everything that's going on, but once you do, you'll see why it's like nothing you've ever experienced before.  If you choose to watch this gift to the anime world, I highly recommend the English dub, which is something that can't be said about most other anime series.  With an all-star cast lineup including J. Micahel Tatum and Patrick Seitz, the voice acting positively impacts and amplifies the mood of every scene, which in turn adds to the value of the series.

The quality of the DVDs is good as expected, and while I haven't checked out the Blu-rays yet, I expect them to be just as good.
The box is actually more compact that it seems, with 4 DVDs and 4 Blu-rays neatly packed inside. The menu is easy to use, and in case you didn't know, there are both Japanese and English Dub (the English Dub, in Kurisu's case, could've done better).
The paper cover was scratched at the edge, which made it look like it had been used when I received it. :(
And the synopsis of the story (behind the box), despite being catchy, is not what I would call an accurate introduction of the story. It did an ""okay"" job at omitting major plot points, but it gave quite a wrong impressions to the series that, I reckon, could have been intentional.

Once they all start tampering with time things start to go awry though, and that is what the bulk of the story focuses on. Between the start and the end you will laugh, cry, and be surprised by all the turns this story takes.

The Anime adaption pays great tribute to the VN it's based off of, but the time constraints that it works with leaves some of the relationships underdeveloped which is a sad but necessary truncation of the story. There is even an extra 25th episode that will surprise those who played the visual novel.

6448263,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"This is a pretty amazing Anime. The show also started out really slow, and looked pretty aimless.
Let me reiterate : It started out really, really slow. And weird. Not as weird as the paragraph at the back of the DVD box is, but pretty weird, and random. Everyone in this movie is eccentric.

Only after it reaches halfway point did that investment in the first half pays off. The effect of time travelling hits home. And the action picked up. I couldn't stop watching as soon as the pace picked up.
And the love story here was also so enjoyable.  Honestly, if you like good quality animation like death note, or basilisks, you'll love this too. Because its well written, and well thought out. In fact, I think the time travelling element here is better thought out than most time travelling movies - so much so it didn't leave me with an obvious paradox or circular reasoning questions at the end of it.

And if you love the romance in the movie, you should pick up its epilogue (not required), which is this here :

6448267,4,B00KU3Y5CG,"Now, I am not marking this 5 stars because of 3 things.

1. Funimation in the English Dub and English sub translation modified the humor to appeal to American and Western audiences. The actual humor from the Jap disk, is rather different and kinda ties in to the darker elements in a weird way.

2. Being based on a visual novel, much of Okabe's inner dialogue and the science connections were left out. The anime protrayed the science as good as it could and was very consistent. However, compared to the game, the sci-fi elements felt rather simplified. Some of the pyschological effects of time travel and the theories behind it were a bit simplified due to bring in more variety of age groups.

3. The repetitiveness. Sadly, the anime did get repetitive but cut it short enough to not drag on. Sadly though, each time a cycle was repeated, it was not kept fresh enough. The freshness that the game introduced could not be brought over for time restraints, and thus each cycle of time travel repeated, seemed repetitive in the anime.

Now I am not going to say steins;gate is bad. It has probably one of the best plots of time travel I've seen in a long time that can fit in to 26 episodes (compared to a show like Doctor Who, which had over 50 years to build the world). Repetitiveness is somewhat the nature of Time Travel stories and was not a killer. The tone switching was not bad, because using time travel in a real sense can screw up history by just one small incident. This is explored by the whole butterfly effect concept. And so the show starts off innocently and in a comedy tone because it wants viewers to believe that messing with time is not serious. But the show will swap back and forth making you a bit more unsure each time until it throws in a hard lesson that, messing with time/history IS NOT a good thing. This is the show's major strong point. It's the message and how effectively it is presented and executed throughout the whole show.

An overly complex show with overly complex theories can eventually ruin the writing and make the over all message harder to present and be meaningful when a series is NOT trying to be episodic. Steins;Gate avoids the problems well, but it does have its flaws in the science, and part of the reasons are what I listed above, and other is just that no sci-fi on time travel can be perfect since its all a ""thought experiment"".

If you want a show has light humor, a serious plot and message about time travel, with the science a bit simplified, then you are here to the right place. So go watch it.  For the no-Sayers out there, this is more like an introduction piece to the steins;gate universe and if one is interested to wrap up all the loose ends and holes that the anime presented. I will recommend you take it for another spin by buying the game.",1431907200,3,2818,4.449612403100775

The fact that as of now it is in the top 10 (#6) for anime in the department is truly great! I just had to get this because it is one of my favorites and if you love science fiction and all the hubbub you will love this, with each episode leaving you with a cliffhanger. I would recommend to find a good day to watch it because watching this in bursts will not work out in your brain and basic functions in your life will be bogged down with what will happen next in the episode... In short; super awesome anime for all science guys and casuals alike, the story is great and will leave you with more to watch after each episode. You will end up watching it in one go, unless you time yourself.. But, we know that not going to happen. It is just that great! :)",1429142400,2,927,3.989247311827957

You'll really want to buckle down and get to know the characters better rather then try and figure out where the stories going.

The story is about time travel and, while the answer to time lies in Stein's Gate, there are some interesting side issues thrown in, such as the 'mad scientist' being in a dimension with his earlier self.

6448331,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"This is a great anime!  I am rather picky about the shows that I enjoy, and few are as well thought out, entertaining, and sweet as this show was. Instant classic.
As others have mentioned, it follows a self proclaimed mad scientist who stumbles across something stranger and darker than even his craziest imaginings could take him, and he must figure out a way to save the world and his friends from the cruel hands of time itself.

The pacing reminded me a lot of Trigun where the first half is a lot of fun and fluff, but when the crap hits the fan then things start moving quickly.  With this show it is very easy to watch one or two episodes at a time in the beginning, but once you hit the 2nd half then clear some time for some binge watching because it is difficult to stop.  I am certainly going to watch it again (and again) to see if everything works out plot wise with the time travel, but on the first pass watching primarily for story it was pretty convincing, and it is nice to see a story that actually works with time travel.  Only minor complaint on the story is that (as with most time travel shows) some episodes get a little repetitive, and there are 3 'endings' to the show before it finally stops.  Still, great handling of time travel, and each ending is pretty good, and the final ending is nice.

From a quality perspective it is really rather hit-or-miss.  The show certainly suffers from some bad compression causing color stepping along lighting gradients, which I find extremely annoying, but most of the time it is not really that big of an issue, but that is the extent of my complaints.  The Japanese cast is top-notch, but I really enjoyed how the English cast really overplayed their parts as it really fit the feel of the show.  I typically watch anime in Japanese, but this is one where I would suggest people watch in English... it is not 'better' but it was certainly more fun.",1425513600,,1916,4.417613636363637

6448338,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"I want to start off and by saying anime is a hobby of mine. Iv watched anime since I was 12 and my older cousin had a large collection and he would lend my a few here and there.

13 years later I'm still a huge fan. Iv seen countless series, I have a membership threw crunchyroll and watch anime airing in Japan as it airs. You can't see much newer anime then that. Out of all the anime iv seen I have seen some I disliked, hated, enjoyed, loved and some that are so good they make me thankful for being a anime fan.

This is one of thoses series. In all my years I have seen very few anime's as good as Steins;Gate. Its generally considered a masterpiece among anime fans. Its not quiet mainstream (yet) but its growing in popularity each year.

The website myanimelist.net ranks anime's based upon user reviews. In the top 10 section Steins;Gate is ranked #2 with 230,000 reviews and a average rating of 9.3/10 (keep in mind only 1 other anime is ranked higher). This isn't a critics review website this is users. That's you, me, your friends, that guy down the road. With such high ratings you know it will be great.

Steins;Gate is a Psychological thriller. Its a thinking anime, they will not always put everything out in the open they expect you to do some thinking too. Parts can be confusing but they do a good job of giving you multiple angles of the story at different points. It can be an emotional rollercoaster. The good times are great the sad times are depressing.

I don't want to go into an extensive review of the anime tho. If looking for a detailed review please head over to YouTube.

As for value, it simply can't be beat. Funimation has treated us very well here no doubt. 25 episodes, Bluray & DvD for $30 is a excellent deal. Anyone who collects anime can tell you its not a cheap hobby. I had a 4 disk (DVD 1 season) set of arpeggio of blue steel. Not a highly regarded anime average at best but I enjoyed it. I payed $50-$65 for each DVD (total of 4) I have over $220 in this 1 season of a average anime. Nothing special about it either.

For $30 you get 4 DVDs, 4 Blurays 2 seasons and 25 episodes. Keep in mind this is a very popular anime. Compare that to the $220 I spent on a 1 season average anime and you can see how good of a deal this is.

$220 for 4 DVDs 12 episodes vs $30 4 DVDs and 4 Blurays 25 episodes.
Funimation could have easily done the same exact thing and people would have still bought it plan and simple. For this fact I'm very pleased with Funimation.

Its a very reasonable price.",1424822400,10,2532,4.214876033057851

For moments, it seems like SHELDON COOPER wrote the screenplay. It's filled with the lamest humour I've ever seen --Oh and perv also! The concept is very good, don't get me wrong, but the execution is very poor: the plot moves forward excrutiatingly slow because of the dumb comedy. Seriously, the script has so many flaws...

6448343,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"I'm picky about my anime. I cut my teeth on Shinichiro Watanabe's Bebop and Champloo before discovering classics like Evangaleon and Gundam, and I usually wait a while and gather references before giving an anime a chance. That said, I have never before had the kind of exciting page-turning experience that I had with Steins;Gate. Seriously. In the first few episodes I was skeptical of the goofy main character and his mandatory doe-eyed-sweetheart sidekick -- an archetype that I can't stand -- but in my experience it typically takes about 6 episodes for an anime to warm up. I'm glad I stuck with it. By ep. 9 you're hooked. By ep. 12, you had better have time to spare because you will want to binge. I hate to compare a show against my nostalgia-goggles Bebop, so I won't. Instead, I'll just say that this anime is easily the most thrilling I have ever watched, and is definitely among the very best.

Cons:
-Slow warm-up (9 episodes to get really interesting)
-Annoying main character at first
-Dull ""moe"" sidekick (sweet, submissive, pure, loves everyone). Works for some, but really grinds my gears.

Pros:
-By episode 12 you won't want to stop
-Main character grows up

6448349,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"I don't watch a lot of Anime.  While I consider myself an Anime fan, not all Anime series' are created equal.

I'm very selective about what I purchase, being on a budget.  Something told me this was going to be good.  It had been on my wishlist for almost a year when I finally had the extra money to purchase it.  Best call I ever made on an Anime series.

The plot is spell-binding.  The twists and turns, exciting.  The story, full-steam ahead.  The art, phenomenal.  Witty banter.  Clever stream-of-conscious dialogue.  Colorful, endearing characters.  When they laughed, I laughed.  When they cried, I cried.  The roller-coaster of emotions the cast took, I was along for the ride.  My desire to finish watching was insatiable.  Heck.  I want to watch it again.  Soon enough, I've no doubt I will.

Seriously, if this show could have gone on another ten seasons, I'd have jumped on the bandwagon.  This is a Sci-Fi mind-warping tale on hyper overdrive strung out on speed.  Episodes were over before I knew enough time had passed for an episode to be complete.  Closures would occur before I realized there could even could be one.

Admittedly, it feels like there are 3 endings to the series, and each time, I could easily have let it got at that.  But, somehow, what poured forth from the cerebral cortex's of the people who created and wrote Steins;Gate captured my attention anew.

Okabe is reason enough to watch this series just to hear him speak.  Daru's cool.  The female characters at first feel like just plain ol' eye candy.  However, within mere moments of each of their introductions, they become so much more.  The fact that they're animated to be cute just makes everything even easier.

Having said that, there's nothing I'd really truly consider ""Fan Service"" (barring, perhaps, Faris), one reason I don't really care for some Anime series' to begin with.  I prefer real women as opposed to animated ones I could never have...  But, cute is cute, and the females in this series are every bit.

Far beyond that, though, I get back to the story.  The plot.  The characters.  All worth every penny you pay to get this.

If you want a fantastic, solid series you can truly enjoy, this is the one to get.",1422662400,5,2222,4.645994832041343

Steins;Gate is an amazing psychological thriller from start to finish. The story is top-notch, the characters are deep and well developed, the animation is beautiful. Also one of the best English dubs out there for those who don't like subs. (I watched it the first time with subs and then again with the dub and I actually prefer the English voices for some characters.)

I've attached some pics so you will know what to expect. This set includes 8 discs; 4 DVD's and 4 Blu-Ray Discs. Personally I could have done without the DVD's as they make the case kind of thick, but hey, they're in there.",1422576000,157,727,4.592307692307692

6448353,3,B00KU3Y5CG,"Steins;Gate is part sci-fi thriller, part harem comedy. Overall, it's not a bad show... it certainly has a lot of intrigue to get viewers interested in the premise, which as far as anime premises go is actually pretty damn smart. Unfortunately though, the show's more interesting thriller aspect falls to pieces midway through when they start pandering to the harem side of the show.

If harem's your cup of tea and you also like sci-fi, then you'll probably love Steins;Gate. If you like either harem or sci-fi but not both, then you might still enjoy S;G... but just a word of caution: They create a massive plot hole for the sci-fi side of the show midway through. I'm not going to spoil the show for you by detailing exactly what the plot hole is, and chances are even pretty good that you might not even notice it. But suffice to say, due to the fact that the plot hole effectively changes ""Cause -> Effect"" to ""Effect -> Cause"", it can ruin the show for you if you're watching it for the sci-fi aspects and do happen to notice this particular flaw in the show's logic.",1421884800,2,1074,4.507692307692308

But this anime is one of my favorites because of its intriguing and engaging storyline. Of course the premise that a microwave oven can somehow be transformed into a time machine (oops, but your need to watch it to REALLY see) is more than a stretch, but it's how the storylines revolve around that and its FUN. Like Tinkerbell says, just believe (or at least go with it). Then character development and all the complications that happen along the way plus the conspiracies with numerous plot twists -- all FUN.

6448360,2,B00KU3Y5CG,"Other reviews have commented that this is one of the finest anime series they have seen in a long time - clever plot, humorous and original, earning it a place in the top ten of many best anime series polls. That prompted me to take a look, not least because reviewers believed the script explored time travel theory in some detail. Well, I didn't find any of that to be true. The series really doesn't start to get going until half way through the second series. I think this Anime is aimed at younger teens as opposed to any other age group.

Basically, a student rents an apartment above a TV repair shop and, eventually, one day discovers that he can switch his phone on while his microwave is on and, so long as one of the TVs is turned on in the shop below, he can send so many seconds of his most recent memory back in time to himself to alter how events unfold. Later on, the daughter of one of his flatmates shows up, from the future, arriving in a time machine that her father built, requesting help to change events to avoid a future world war three, which she has lived through.

With the time machine, the student and the girl can travel back and forth in time together to, hopefully, avert world war three and the death of fellow friends. This is the place you find yourself at mid way through season two.

The plot is quite simple and uncomplicated, the theory and practicalities of time travel are really only vaguely touched upon and are not explored in any real depth. They remain largely unexplored. Until half way through the second season, the student spends all his time doing the same thing over and over again, as he sends memories back in time to help his former self prevent the death of his friend. Each time he attempts to prevent the death, it still happens, just in a different way. So, for the most part, this anime is relatively boring and repetitive. If the series was to be so short, really things needed to move along at a much faster pace to progress and extend the story.

In comparison to Death Note, I would not say this series is even half as intelligent, detailed, complex or interesting. In summary, this is one to avoid - watch it on YouTube or something. It is certainly not worth spending more than $9.1 USD on! ;)",1421020800,2,2259,4.3971291866028706
6448361,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"I cannot say enough nice things about this anime!  It is awesome.  Whether you are an anime fan or just love great writing, Steins;Gate is definitely a show that should be watched by any and all people.
The plot is a bit slow in the beginning, but completely necessary for it's buildup to episode 13.
Not to mention that the Funimation dub is literally dubbing gold.  J. Michael Tatum did a fantastic job adapting the script for an American audience, and nerdy references will not be lost on any fans of the science fiction and time travel media.

The boxed set is nice, having both DVDs and Blu-rays, definitely an A+ if you plan on forcing your best friends, SOs and co-workers to watch this anime.  The commentaries and such are a nice addition for the devout fan.",1421020800,,767,4.528985507246377

6448366,5,B00KU3Y5CG,Awesome,1420588800,,7,7.0
6448367,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"Probably the best time travel story I've ever experienced.

The main character can rub you the wrong way in the beginning with how unbelievably over the top he is (even for anime...) but his character really develops through the course of the series and you sympathize with him as his layers start to peel.

The story might start a bit slow to some/most (I had no problem with it personally), but if you can make it to past episode 11 and get to 12, then you're probably going to have trouble turning it off. It really hits the fan from ep 12 on and you'll be taken on an emotional roller coaster almost to the very last minute.

The dub is great, there are aspects of it I prefer over the Japanese audio version. The main character being one (he's far less annoying early on in the English dub) and the localized references are a welcome change. I say this as someone who prefers subs and got most of the Japanese dialog references.

Animation is consistent, with the style and color pallet being both unique and appealing.

This series really is great and I feel like it's a must have for anime fans that like something a bit more cerebral. It has plenty of cliches and tropes in it for people that like harems, tsundere, trap and moe characters BUT it pretty much turns all of this on their heads and isn't resting on them at all, which is I liked a lot because I'm tired of cookie cutter anime and manga.",1420416000,,1408,4.358778625954199
6448368,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"THE GOOD:
The anime is among the best I've ever seen, with an interesting story, great characterization, and an a sense of humor that serves to compliment the seriousness of the show instead of undermining it.  I received this series yesterday, and I stayed up the entire night watching it; I couldn't put it down.  The show contains all 24 episodes as well as an OVA listed as a 25th episode (a decision I completely agree with, as the events of the OVA help answer some lingering questions that viewers might have).

I especially enjoyed having the show on both DVD and Blu-ray.  I don't have a Blu-ray player so it was nice to be able to find an anime that was not only on Blu-ray.  The art on the discs look very nice, the box art is beautiful, and the case holds the discs very well, I am not afraid of the discs popping out of their trays.  Overall, the combo pack itself was very good.

THE BAD:
The only complaint I have with the show as presented on the discs was the sub.  Overall, the sub was very well done, but there were a few times where there was a slight discrepancy between what was said, in Japanese, and what the subtitles said.  For example, at a point in the anime where one of the characters reveals that their online screen name was ""kurigohan and kamehameha"", the sub changes it to ""Chestnut Rice and kamehameha"", which, spoils part of the reference to Dragonball.  Other times, the main character calls his ""assistant"" the name Christina rather than Kurisu (basically adding a 'tina' to the end of her name).  She responds by saying something like ""there's no 'tina'"", while the sub translates it as ""that's not my name"".  These kinds of things don't happen too often, and are not very significant to the show, but it was something that was annoying to me.  However, because this was infrequent and didn't affect the story too much, I still gave the show a five-star rating.

CONCLUSION:
In conclusion, the anime is great, the box set is great, but the subs are slightly lacking.  This collection is definitely worth purchasing.",1420329600,3,2054,4.55858310626703

As a long time anime fan ranging all the way back to Yu Yu Hakusho, Dragon Ball, ect, I can say that I am very happy with what I got here.  As an Amazon Prime member I got this package for an easy $25, which is much less than what I could have gotten it anywhere else.  The visuals running at a beautiful 1080P gives the anime a nice needed look, as the streaming site (Netflix, Hulu, wherever you might watch it originally) does not do this anime justice.  So many times have I paused the show just to enjoy the visuals and what I was looking at.  The anime itself is amazing, it's literally my favorite which is why this is the first that I added to my Blu-ray collection, if you have not seen it and are interested in checking it out, do not shy away of spending the money on this.

The package includes:
-Blu Ray sleeve over the actual blu ray package
-4 DvD disks of the series
-4 Blu-Ray Disks

The package is about the side of maybe 2 1/2 standard blu-ray boxes stacked, so you won't be losing a lot of room on your shelf, and the design is sleek and simplistic.  Might I add that the HD audio is great too, you can hear a lot more details that you couldn't hear before!

But wait I did put up 4 stars!  Well I did decide to view the second disc - and like others have mentioned before - episode 12 is the turning point.  From there on I had to finish off discs 3 & 4 in one sitting!  Amazingly well written anime!
Okabe still is annoying with his ""theatrics"" but then you see another side to him - his anguish as he tries to figure out the puzzle to saving his friend(s). He becomes an unlikely hero in his unrelenting quest.
Although this is a stand alone series - in that it has a beginning, middle and an end.  This is supposedly the second in a trilogy.  And how did I come to this conclusion you ask?  Well I am working my way backwards as I actually started with the last in the series: ""Robotics"". That is another good anime series which in the extras includes commentaries.  One of these commentaries has a discussion panel, the topic of which is ""Robotics"", """"Steins;Gate"" and ""Chaos Head"" and how they are distantly related to each other.
Well then ... two down, one more to go.
11/16/2014: Just ordered ""Chaos Head SAVE"" thru Amazon (pre-order).  At least in a couple of months I'll have the final (or actually the 1st) in the trilogy!

6448405,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"Although the box does have some minor flaws, I'm going to ignore that and rate this based on the quality of the show instead. Steins;Gate is one of my all-time favorite shows. It has (arguably) the greatest, most eccentric protagonist to ever grace the anime medium. It's about as unique as they come, and has extremely high entertainment value.

The first half is like a slice-of-life with time travel and has a lighter feel to it. The second half is more serious, but still has some of the great comedy that the first half featured.

All-in-all, this is a must watch for anime fans and time travel fans alike.",1414281600,,611,4.5963302752293576

6448407,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"Finally finished this series, and holy gel-nanas this is definitely one of the best animes I have seen in a while. 2011 really was a great year for anime, and I don't understand why it took me so long to watch this. You can read reviews everywhere about this series, so I'll keep it short and relevant.

  Basically, this is a perfect balance of comedy, seriousness, sci-fi, and a touch of romance. Very emotional, and really gets you thinking about what it would be like to go through the same things as our main character Okarin. This really touches the heart, and is superb in its execution of thought-provoking situations. This literally touches upon everything you want to see in an anime as far as theme, plot, character development, with modern comedy skits that don't distract from the show or the flow of the story at all. They actually add great depth to them.

  The idea of time travel is always going to be a hot topic, but the way this series goes about it is fantastic, and better than any other time-traveling story I have ever seen or read about. It doesn't over-complicate, but it still gives a thorough explanation and reasoning as to how it would work, and what would essentially happen consequentially.

Definitely pick this up to add to your collection. Can't recommend this enough, as it is a must-have for your collection - no matter what set you decide to purchase, get it quickly as this is just top-notch.",1413936000,,1432,4.636363636363637
6448408,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"Simply one of the best shows I have seen in a long, long time. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE anime and it's pretty much the only thing I watch and it's mostly all really good, but Steins;Gate is unbelievably brilliant. The story itself is pretty mind blowing. The twists themselves may be slightly predictable once the story unfolds, but as a whole it is genius.
 One of the things I do love most about this show are the characters. Character development here is very quick, precise and real. I say real because anyone could easily know these people or even be these people. I know people like these characters, they are all so very genuine and many people out there can easily relate to any of them, and you begin to love them all immediately.
 There is a great mix of comedy and tragedy. There is a wonderful air of real life modern culture. I will also mention that it shouldn't be surprising that there are even a few Doctor Who references sprinkled throughout. The back of the case mentions The Big Bang Theory mixed with Donnie Darko. I say add in The Butterfly Effect and that is a perfect description.
 I really can't begin to say how much I LOVE THIS SHOW! Not only will I highly recommend watching it, I recommend watching it more than once too. On your secondary run through, you will see things that were there all along...",1413936000,,1332,4.450819672131147

""Steins;Gate"" answers the call for that something new, something fresh, and something entertaining.  Layered in Mystery, Tragedy, and Comedy overtones covered with wit, this time-traveling story hits the marks where it counts - a feat so few titles can pull off well (last one to come to mind was ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"").  The ONLY gripe anyone may actually have with this is the somewhat slow start-up pacing the first few episodes (unless you weren't hooked from the humor).  As plots and characters progress, once things start heating up OH BOY does it go.  And its allure is so sneaky, you won't even notice that you're playing that second/third disc... until it's too late!  This is a MUST for any otaku's library.

The set is also very nice as well, it looks very nice in my collection.

Honestly it wasn't easy at first, and seriously the best of tales aren't; this one starts somewhat broad elliptically with story building elements, then as you move forward or as the case may be, backwards in time, the shifts come quicker along with the absorption of what actually going on, keeping track or scorecard can be a tad mind-numbing but not that I own this specific collection I can pickup on all nuances missed and bounce back when everyone is talking and missed the subtitles (not always exact, but try listening to the english w/subtitles that is even stranger, though I appreciate and understand they work hard to maintain context and interest).

6448415,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"The headline does not do this anime justice.  It is more like the Butterfly effect meets Back to the Future with the comedy of the Big Bang Theory. It is rare when a book, show, or movie comes your way and becomes instantly memorable.  This is one of them

The story from start to finish is interesting.  Some people would find the first 4 episodes as lower paced than the rest of the series but it is worth watching even if you are not into anime.",1412553600,2,448,4.174418604651163

The package itself had a few very minor bends on a couple corners of the cardboard sleeve, but they're hardly noticeable so its not a problem. If you're looking for a quality BD of Steins;Gate that has a price tag that doesn't devour your wallet, this is probably your best bet.",1412294400,,464,4.470588235294118
6448418,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"A great series in both sub and dub. A lot of the humor from the sub are the engrish scenes of the characters talking. In the dub these scenes are hit or miss as it's just them talking normal without the funny japanese trying to speak english jokes. I would say this is about the quantum leap of anime in how one episode can be lighthearted and joking. Then have the next full of dark themes and psychological trauma.

The box arrived in great condition as well so that is always a plus.",1412294400,,486,4.225806451612903
6448419,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"The show is awesome enough said I'm not going to go on about why it's awesome because SERN may be watching and an agent could be hacking my computer at this very moment. Instead I want to talk about the product itself and how it fails to live up to this great show. First off I should have know better than to order from Amazon as all the anime I order from here come in damaged; I've only had a few orders actually come in pristine condition. I should have ordered from rightstuf ($32), but whenever I order from them I'm forced to wait weeks because of where I live. So being the impatient man I am, I bought it through Amazon and it came in fast with prime, but when I opened it I found discs everywhere and the plastic for the case cracked in various places not to mention the cover looks like stickers were peeled off by someone and the paint on one of the discs is over painted causing lumps to form. In short reckless shipping and terrible packaging really bring this down. The plastic is so cheap and the discs barely stay in and it just feels like it's going to fall apart at any moment if you hold it in the vertical position. The lumps of paint on the disc I have honestly never heard of until today and I am terribly disappointed at the quality control that went into this as this is to me as well as many others is a crazy good show.

Everything about this could have been done better, but what can't be beat is the price. This will save you about $30 or so compared to buying part 1 and part 2 separately. I'm a pretty nit picky guy so this packaging problem really bothers me, but to send it back to get another is just too much trouble and it'll probably come in just as damaged.

I would recommend buying from rightstuf as they have better packing methods which will hopefully minimize damage to the already weak case. Plus I think if I saw correctly Amazon's price is now $49.99 which is $17 more than rightstuf. Weird as just the other day it was $31.99. Anyways go and add this wonderful anime to your collection, just be wary of Amazon I'm now logging out before they catch me until we meet again at Steins Gate El Psy Congroo!",1412208000,,2148,4.223844282238443

6448423,2,B00KU3Y5CG,"The series would get a 4.5/5, but the packing itself is disappointing and not well made. The slip case is EXACT same image used on the actual cover (both the front and back). The 8 discs themselves have cool designs on them that remind you of Steins;Gate, but are crammed into the box. These discs are so crammed in that as soon as I opened this, one of the center pieces that holds the disc broke off. Now, that was RIGHT AFTER I OPENED THE BOX. With this flimsiness, I worry if the discs will be safe from the frail packaging. I guess I got what I got for $30, but I would spend much more to ensure that I would receive nice packaging that would not break in 10 seconds, and packaging that is visually appealing. If packaging does not bother you as much as it bothers me, well spend away.",1412035200,13,790,4.203947368421052
6448424,5,B00KU3Y5CG,"When a anime consist largely of a bunch of characters sitting around in a room discussing the ins and outs of time travel, and yet it keeps me coming back episode after episode, unable to wait to see the next until the late hours of night, until I absolutely must go to bed or risk being a zombie for work, I know I've come across a good anime. Seriously, the characters were so interesting that it was easy to get absorbed in their lives and want to know more about them. The plot of this show was something quite unique. You really could not guess where it was going to go with it. Although, I'll admit that I did see the end coming when a couple episodes away from the last episode, but still, throughout, it just kept you guessing, and in the mean time, it really pulls on your heart strings. It really makes you feel for the characters. You care about them. Even some of the bad guys, you couldn't help but really feel for them because you knew so much about them and could understand them. It's a little hard to describe this show. The best way to describe it is like this: It's a very character driven story that focuses on the concept of time travel, but really, it's about people. How people deal with life. How they deal with challenges. How they deal with tough decisions. How they deal with pain. It's about the true power of love for one's friends. It's about friendship. It about people that embark on a journey that draws out their true selves and brings them closer together forever after.
At times, elements of the story seem preposterously ridiculous until suddenly it all makes sense and feels completely believable. Truly an excellently crafted story, but more importantly, what really makes this series great is it's magnificent characters because they are what truly make the story. They are the story. They are so passionate and enthralling. Really... it's hard to describe why I liked this anime so much. It's simply has to be seen to fully understand it. I'd recommend this series to anyone who loves good sci-fi or anime or good characters or good story telling in general. To just about anyone. Just don't go into it expecting an action show. Not that it doesn't have some action, and it is filled with suspense, but this adventure is a discovery of the unknown reaches of time (not space) and people. Just watch it! That's honestly the best way one can understand what this show is about.",1411689600,118,2416,4.543577981651376
