2875919,5,B000RWDYCC,"Written and directed by Coline Serreau this is an atypical French film - fast, witty, irreverent and with an unconventional beauty at its centre.

Revered French film actor Daniel Auteuil (Manon des Sources, Un Coeur en Hiver) turns in a pitch-perfect comic performance as Romuald, a thriving wealthy executive, who is on top of the world having just been made President of his company. Firmine Richard is Juliette, the office cleaner, whose virtual invisibility to the office workers has made her privy to the plotting of the jealous colleagues.

Romuald dismisses Juliette's warnings until he finds himself implicated in a food poisoning scandal and framed for fraud, only Juliette can save him from jail. Hiding out with Juliette and living cheek by jowl with her and her five children, in her small apartment, he sees how the other half live. But Romuald is so focused on trying to exonerate himself and get his old life back that his gradual awakening to what is really of value may have come too late.

Rich in detail and character, this film explores the potentially divisive issues of race, class and sex wars with a delightful lightness of touch. Intricately plotted and crafted, and invested with real humanity, this is one of the best love stories ever made on film.",1245542400,4,1277,4.902777777777778
2875920,4,B000RWDYCC,"I am a French teacher, and I have used this movie first just for the passage when sick people are asked if they ate yogurts (because of the form of the past tense). My students always beg to see the movie, and they love it! It's clean, it's sentimental, it gives you another view, non violent, of racial interactions. Like Three Men and a Baby by the same director, it has heart. One of the favorite scenes is the little boy who comes in to his mom's room and says about Daniel Auteuil, ""But he is white!"" This romantic comedy is a must see.",1244937600,3,541,4.211538461538462
