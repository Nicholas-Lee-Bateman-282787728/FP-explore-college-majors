4287841,5,B0049EOFCC,"I just saw Mao's Last Dancer. It's a true story about the defection of a dancer who grew up in communist China. Awesome views of the Chinese countryside and an eye opening look at the education system under Mao. If you enjoy ballet, you'll love this movie!",1286841600,5,256,4.468085106382978
4287842,5,B0049EOFCC,This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time!  Can't wait for the DVD to come out!,1286323200,5,93,3.4285714285714284
4287843,5,B0049EOFCC,"A true story of survival and perseverence of a young dancer from China during and after the cultural revolution, this is a heart warming account of a young artist who enjoyed the freedom to live and dance in America. The cultural aspects and the short clips of the beautiful ballets were well presented. The most touching scene was the curtain call when the son was reunited with his parents after years of separation. Instead of big hugs and kisses, he simply knelt before his parents and the proud father's comment was ""Why did you dance without a shirt on ?""

This beautiful bi-cultural movie will be a classic for years to come.",1284422400,11,632,4.642857142857143
4287844,5,B0049EOFCC,"This review is for in theaters version only, not the DVD.

This inspiring film is based on the autobiography of Li Cunxin, principal ballet dancer who defected to the United States in 1981.  It includes the suspenseful account of a 21-hour international incident when Li was held hostage in Houston's Chinese consulate.

The film begins with his childhood in Maoist China.  The first portion of the movie was actually filmed there.  Li was taken from his family to train at the Beijing Dance Academy while he was still a young child.  After harsh, rigorous training, he was chosen for a dance scholarship with the Houston Ballet Company in a cultural exchange program.

There are comical moments as Li adjusts to the soaring skyline of Houston's modern buildings, ATM's that dole out cash, and misconceptions about english words.  Actor, Bruce Greenwood, does a great job portraying the artistic director of the Houston Ballet, Ben Stevenson, who takes the young dancer under his wing and helps him adjust to his new life in the United States.

The casting for this film is miraculous!  Chi Cao plays the extraordinarily talented Li.  Wowee! This is a film where the camera man does not have to fake the quality of the dancing.  The performers are exceptional!  The Australian Ballet's prima ballerina, Madeleine Eastoe, plays Li's dance partner.  This beautiful film is a Must See for dance fans.  Lavish scenery and costumes were provided courtesy of the Australian Ballet.  There are scenes from the Rite of Spring, Swan Lake, the Don Quixote pas de deux, and a political ballet from the Maoist era, ""The Red Detachment of Women"".  The viewer sees long choreographed sequences instead of chopped up bits and pieces.  The carefully chosen dance scenes help mirror the sentiments of the ongoing storyline.

Excellent acting from many cast members, superb directing...an excellent film.
Some of the scenes have spoken dialogue in Chinese with English subtitles.",1283040000,20,1961,5.071875
4287845,5,B0049EOFCC,"The film, by the director of ""Driving Miss Daisy"", was wonderful to watch on many levels.  The political background was softly done because the main story was the success for this young man who was arbitrarily picked for classical ballet training by the Chinese government during the Cultural Revolution (thus, the title).  The dance sequences were marvelous and I had wished for more.  The young dancers who portrayed Li, Mary and others are truly gifted and I hope to see Chi Cao on stage in the near future.  It is interesting to note that Li, whose story this is, after 15 years of professional dancing, is now a stockbroker .... how different his life might have been had he been an eleven year old now, with more freedom to choose careers.  One of the ironies in his story is the fact that he had no choice, and yet through tremendous determination and talent, he danced on the world stage for many years.",1275091200,12,911,4.598765432098766
4287846,5,B0049EOFCC,"This film is complex: it operates on many levels. There is more to it than is initally apparent.
It is the adaptation of the autobiography of the dancer, Li Cunxin, who grew up in China, and against all odds, was chosen for training as a classical ballet dancer. Li was the sixth son of a family who came from ""peasant"" stock for several generations. Li ultimately went to Houston for summer school with the Houston Ballet. During this time, Li fell in love with an American woman, who having a hidden agenda, married Lei in the hope being accepted into the Houston Ballet, as a fellow artist. Upon the expiration of Li's Visa, he learned that China would not extend it. Li was expected to return home to serve his government. It was then that Li and Liz secretly married. With his newly acquired American citizenship, returning to China was out of the question for some time for Li. The Artistic Dircetor of the Houston ballet arranged for Li's to vist him in America and see their son perform for the first time.
The marriage dissolved when ""Liz"" finally left Li to audition for a ballet company in San Francisco.
Li ultimately married Mary, a Prima Ballerina with the Houston Ballet and his dancing partner. Together, with other members of the Company, they returned to China and Li was able to visit his family.
The couple now reside in Austrailia with their children.
This movie is about triumph: making that which seems impossible, possible. It is awesome and inspiring. It is about the triumph of hope over adversity.",1274227200,36,1524,4.690298507462686
4287847,4,B0049EOFCC,"A lot to like about this film. Authentic background, though a little light on his early years and the incredible hardships of family life as the sixth son, and which makes the reunion with his parents after he is a success a little strange, though his humility and love for them is now made apparent. Wonderful ballet sequences topped by Stravinsky's music in 'Rite of Spring'. I hope American audiences can meet this film with an open mind.",1274054400,15,441,4.666666666666667

4287860,5,B0049EOFCC,"Excellent movie.  Surprising moments at every turn as to decisions that were made and the results that took place.  Based on true events, a Chinese ballet dancer visits the United States from China only to fall in love with a woman that manages to make him want to stay when he originally agreed to follow communist doctrine to avoid the democratic life styles.  He couldn't resist the freedom he received as he had none while in China because he was taken away from his family since childhood to be trained as a world class ballet dancer.  He hasn't seen his family since childhood and can possibly lose his entire family if he decides to stay, all for one woman and his freedom.  Should he risk losing his family for his own freedom and for love?  This movie makes you wonder.  Would we make such decisions as he did?",1501718400,,819,4.493243243243243

4287887,4,B0049EOFCC,"As a dancer in my youth I thoroughly enjoyed Mao's Last Dancer.  The story was very good, the history was very good, and the dancing was a delight.  I crosses so many borders and  brings to light what we Americans take so much for granted and that is the freedom to express, to dance, to let the beauty within to shine outwardly.  Very nice, enjoy all who watch it, and thank you Amazon!

4287902,5,B0049EOFCC,"A true story about a boy only eleven selected from his very poor rural Chinese village to learn ballet at a special school in Beijing just about the time that President Nixon opened up sports and cultural exchanges with China in the early 1970's.  The movie showed how he managed to adapt to the strict discipline and rigors of the school, made friends, and found a ballet teacher who encouraged him and believed he had the talent to be a a great dancer. Li Cunxin becomes one of the top dancers in the school and is chosen to go to the United States on a scholarship at the Houston Ballet.  He becomes an acclaimed dancer there.  Then the movie turns to his struggle with the communist ideology preventing him from being as accomplished and creative as possible. He realizes that the freedom of expression offered in America at the Houston Ballet provides him more opportunity to become a better ballet dancer and reach his potential.  At that point, near the end of his scholarship, he decides to defect and in turn loses the support of the Chinese government. He's also separated from his family and believes he'll never be able to return to China.  He discovers love, deep personal relationships, and even marries a young former member of the ballet company.  What I loved most about the movie is that it rings true and reflects accurately the struggle that I've seen among students from other very different societies and how people learn to balance their dreams and desire for  achievement with what more traditional societies expect of them.  Generally, they learn to be independent, strong, and become fulfilled members of their new, adopted societies. Time also allows them to reach out and rebuild family relationships as well as the ability to go back to their native lands.",1493424000,,1785,4.791530944625407

4287905,4,B0049EOFCC,"I have zero interest in ballet but this was an inspiring movie well worth the time despite the ballet scenes.  While there is substantial Mandarin Chinese spoken there are subtitles and the majority of the movie is in English so it is easy to follow.  It is quite an amazing story about a child in Communist China and his upbringing in the home and in the cultural school far from his family, then his transforming visit to the USA.  Despite the them centered around ballet it was not a boring movie at all.  Well worth the time to watch this.",1493164800,2,543,4.4
4287906,5,B0049EOFCC,"If you don't appreciate the ballet...you might change your mind after watching this spectacular movie. Amazing true story. It's an overwhelming feeling, to watch something so physically demanding and difficult, look like floating on air. (Just google ""ballerina's feet""...uh....wait...no...it will ruin the beauty of the dance) All of the dancing was incredible, but my favorite, was a simple dance on a ballet bar...so lovely, and romantic. I think I'm pretty lucky. I can enjoy a well made horror movie...history documentaries...classics...and shoot em up/ blow em up's, but this will be one of my many favorites.",1492905600,3,615,5.484210526315789

The movie is wonderfully done both artistically and with integrity to those un-imaginable times during Chinese history. I felt the horror of his nightmares of his parents being executed because I know people who ended their no-wrong-doing life that way during the Chinese Cultural Revolution.

4287925,5,B0049EOFCC,"Wow.  I was pleasantly surprised a how good this film was.  It's amazing how the screenwriter and director did so many things at one.  This film succeeds as documentary of a life, sociopolitcal flashback to an earlier  period of time, a love letter to art, ,action/drama and even romance.  See what I mean?  This ifilm hits an interesting theme relating to the intersection of art and freedom.  Does politics make the art?  (It tries to.) Or, is art greater than politics?  (Maybe.) Not to forget: this was the BEST choreography of the Rite of  Spring that I have ever  seen performed.  The dancing is top rate, too.  Capably acted by both American and Chinese casts as well.  This film gets better and better as it evolves the narrative and so does the dancing!",1486166400,3,762,4.631578947368421

S. and mainland China is just gettting underway.  I cannot discuss its particulars without giving away key plot points.  Suffice it to say, it is fine until perhaps the last 20 minutes, when elements of the dancer's life seem a bit rushed and glossed over--almost as if they were on a time budget and ran out of time.  Still, it's fun to watch.  The actor is mesmerizing.",1474243200,,512,4.719101123595506

Having lived in Houston during this time period more than likely contributed to our enjoyment of the film. Houston has a world- renowned ballet company, and this film gives you insights as to why. This movie based on a true story provides a striking contrast between life in communist China (1970s - 1980s) and the luxurious world we live in here in the U.S. It brings to life how hard these performers work to be the best in their art form...their passion being ballet, and the difficult sacrifices they make.",1464912000,,589,4.673076923076923

I was looking for it and finally decided to buy it on Amazon.  The story is really motivating as you immediately cheered for the child as he was passed over at first.

his coming to America and turning into one of the most incredible and foremost dancers.  The love some people had for him just really made you cheer for him.  Even when he made a mistake, you really wanted him to succeed.

This ONLY comes in Region 1 which is for NORTH AMERICA ONLY.  Doesn't work anywhere else.

4288940,5,B0049EOFCC,"This is the true story of Li Cunxin, a ballet dancer who defected to the United States in 1981 from Maoist China where he was born. We share his journey from his youth in a small village in the Shandong province, to when he is taken away at age eleven from his family to where his training at the Beijing Dance Academy begins. His training is seven years of grueling 16-hour days, which he attended for seven years. Li was not the best student at first because he did not yet understand why he was chosen and what true interpretation of dance is, yet as he matures he begins to take on a different attitude, one which prepares him for the incredible journey of his life. One of his teachers, who is removed from the school because he stood for classical ballet versus a political ballet, gives him a VHS tape of Baryshnikov and when Li sees it, he begins to understand that it is about strength as well as dance. A poignant moment is when they walk together and his teacher shares the story of the archer, and then the finale of the film where his dance ends in an archers pose, and his strength is truly apparent. This beautiful film takes us on a journey of understanding and manifestation of his strength as he moves through adjustments coming from Communist China to America. It is a gorgeous and visually stunning film and filmed in such a way, we are enchanted and we are engaged as we are entertained. The dancing scenes are beautiful and complete, the autobiographical story shows us bravery, tenacity, integrity, strength and success from the heart and soul. The casting is wonderful and all around, this film (and life story) deserves 10 stars. Brilliant!",1423094400,,1665,4.5719063545150505

Years of hard training follow and Li becomes inspired from senior teacher Chan to overcome his weakness deficiencies, rising to stardom level.

Then he falls in love with an American ballet student, marries, and decides to remain in the U.S. - defecting from China, losing hope of returning there to visit, and worrying about revenge being taken out on his family.

4289167,4,B0049EOFCC,"'Mao's Last Dancer' is the true story of ballet dancer Li Cunxin (played with real heart and soul by Chi Cao, also a brilliant dancer), who at the age of 11 was pulled from his family and poverty-stricken village as one of a group of young boys trained to become ballet dancers in order to serve their country.  Always seen as mediocre but with promise, Li Cunxin pushed himself incessantly, until as an adult his talent finally earned him the chance to dance with his company outside of communist China ... specifically leading him to the USA.  Communism and a contempt for the decadence of American life leaves Li confused and anxious upon his arrival in Houston, but staying with the Houston Ballet's artistic director Ben Stevenson (Bruce Greenwood) and falling for a beautiful up-and-coming ballet American ballerina both contribute to Li's slowly evolving views on this new and freer life ... and when he finally begins debating the idea of possibly defecting, after becoming something of a celebrity dancing here in the 1980s, even viewers absolutely sure of where the film is going from there still have a couple surprises in store.

The film is a bit long, but no less involving for Li Cunxin's journey and his evolution as a human being, dancer, and as a man.  Chi Cao deeply and honestly expresses Li's confusion, initial fear, and ultimate bravery in a performance that never feels like a performance ... and whether you like the ballet or not, the dramatic story of Li Cunxin's journey makes for an involving - and wholly inspiring - story on-screen.",1374883200,,1563,4.82089552238806

I never really knew the struggles he faced in not only becoming a successful dancer but also finding his passion for it and for his new adoptive country.  The movie brought it to light in a very elegant and humanistic way, while also weaving in the kinds of internal struggles that arise from Chinese culture and modern history.

As he grows older, he has the intuitive sense that dancing is the way to escape the poverty that has been the fate of his family.

This little boy was taken from his family (an honor to them and opportunity for him) and given an extremely structured/strict life - no visits home, no smiles and hugs from his parents or siblings, just years and years of constant training. Fortunately ONE of his teachers had a good heart and gave him compassion and confidence and a passion for this profession he had no say in but came to love and excel in.  It's a good story.

When you see the situations some of these great artists were made in, it's no wonder why some defect when they get a taste of freedom and fame in America.

There are several reasons but mostly because it's a full, true life story, that is told without all the bad language and gratuitous body parts shots that are not even necessary in most movies but are still added, for rating I expect. Also, although the story isn't very intriguing, which is to say exciting/suspenseful, it is a story of determination, hard work and success. And finally, there is the breath-taking dancing done by the young lead actor. The man can practically fly!

4289288,4,B0049EOFCC,"Mao's Last Dancer took me by surprise when I watched it the other day. Given only a two star recommendation from the critics, I was expecting a schlocky cornball bit of fluff. It was instead a joyful celebration of the human spirit that avoided going too far overboard. Sure, the ending was a deliberate tug at the heartstrings, but the rest of the movie was a touching motion picture about determination and difficult choices.

Mixing in flashbacks of his discovery in a small village through his training in Beijing with his initial eye-opening voyage to the United States and his instruction in the differences between eastern and western ballet styles, the story gave the uninformed (like me) enough ballet insight to stoke my curiosity but never smothered me, thus allowing me to appreciate the physical and mental demands of this art form without getting bored. Bruce Greenwood, playing against his usual nasty type, does a fine job as the ballet director and Joan Chen provides poignancy and strength in her limited role as Cunxin's mother.

Mao's Last Dancer was a lovely film about courage, hard work, sacrifice, and conscience. Despite some of the more rhetorical and argumentative reviews, it is not a movie about politics. Many have criticized the movie as pro-American propaganda, but I didn't see that. To deny that China went through a dramatic period of change over the years the story takes place is an understatement, but I saw nothing heavy-handed about either side.  The characters are the focus of Mao's Last Dancer. Certainly the comparisons are evident and a minor plot device, but to see this movie or even the story of Li Cunxin as strictly about the differences between Chinese and American methods of government is to be myopic and thus miss out on the beauty of the larger story.",1339977600,2,1807,4.918032786885246

I'm not a dancer, but I am a fan. I also loved the scenery from China, and travelling on the life journey of the lead character from a starving, rural peasant to an accomplished dancer.

Then, it also hows the current dramatic moments plays into how Li past experience relates helped him become a great ballent dancer.

I like seeing Li go from knowing few English words to speaking full on sentences with no accent at the end of the movie.

There were only a few things I didn't like was when Li got into a fight with Liz over something very small. Then, all of a sudden Liz leaves. To the audience this is the first fight they ever had and she ends up leaving? Really? Also, we don't know if Liz would ever come back. But, it seems like they got a divorce or something because we learn that Li married his new partner later. Another thing that Li new partner didn't even show much of a connection to Li and we find out they are married at after the movie ends??? Wow!

4289309,5,B0049EOFCC,"Inspirational, excellent film based on a true story of a young boy taken into the Communist ballet school in Beijing of Madame Mao who strives to excel in a dance form totally foreign to the children in these classes.  The ballet master manages to inspire Li to learn the complicated ballet moves from his own story of an archer who lifted logs for one year to become strong enough to bend a bow.  He is allowed to come to America for a summer class with the Houston Ballet Company where he falls in love with an American dancer and defects through marriage but endeavors to persuade the Chinese authorities to allow him to stay in America and not take retribution upon his family still in China.  The Chinese attempt to kidnap him and return him to China but diplomacy intervenes and he is allowed to stay in Houston.  Of course the Chinese will not allow him to return home EVER to see his family which he reluctantly accepts.  I've always like Beresford's other films and this one is right up there with Breaker Morant and Driving Miss Daisy, etc.  The dancer, Chi Cao of the Birmingham Royal Ballet is the mature Li and has won the Gold Medal of the international competition in Varna, Bulgaria and his dancing is just thrilling.  The film is a well acted ""documentary"" based on Li's book about his life in China and in ballet.  Oddly, his parents were teachers of ballet and Chi Cao one of their students.  Li chose him to act his life in the movie which was certainly appropriate.  Joan Chen is wonderful as his mother - all the acting was very good and believable.  I felt the bargain price of Amazon's Prime offering a MUST HAVE THIS IN MY BALLET COLLECTION.  I've shown it to friends who are not ballet fans and they have all loved it!!  Many people who have not been exposed to great ballet dancing are often amazed at the required athletic ability.  Those who know of ballet appreciate Chi Cao's artistic accomplishments and enjoy the dance sequences very much.  The dance excerpts are quite short in nature but fit into the movie exactly right.  Kudos to the creative artists and crew involved in the making of this film.  A pure joy to watch - don't miss the significance of the final lift at the end of the film.  The culture clashes are well presented and the change in China's society quite remarkable in a short period of time.  The story is set in the 70's and 80's - China today is a much different place and all the better for it.  Ballet fan or not - this is a terrific film and so enjoyable for the entire family.

Family, one's life, country, etc.  I think one thing that should come out is that even though the Chinese communist goverment is awful and lies to its citizens - they at least allowed in the end for many things that a lot of other countries would not have.  I am not going to spoil the story by getting into it, but the point is that some of the horrible things that were thought about the Chinese didn't turn out to be true.

4289335,4,B0049EOFCC,"Realizing that movies will often take liberties with the facts I was curious how close this movie reflected what really happened. The name and story of Li Cunxin was already familiar to me as my daughter was a student there at the time Li came to Houston and actually married a young dancer who had been brought in from Great Britain the same way Li Cunxin had been brought in from China.

Being part of that same group of young dancers gave my future son-in-law many opportunities to get to know Li so I was curious to ask him how faithful the movie was to the facts as he recalled them. He said first of all that he enjoyed the movie and found it followed the facts reasonably well. He also remarked how extremely poor Li's family in China had been as Li seemed to reflect on that part of his life to the other dancers to try and help them understand the vast differences he was experiencing in the USA.

One point he mentioned had to do with the scene near the end of the movie where Li has the opportunity to dance while his parents are present. He said he was not present at that performance but has a good friend who had attended who told him Li's parents did not go on stage as shown. In addition he believed the performance was of a different ballet but Li was dancing the main male lead.

Overall he was enthusiastic about the movie and I too found it of interest. If you are a fan of ballet you will probably enjoy this one.",1316390400,5,1434,4.226277372262774

4289345,2,B0049EOFCC,"I had really liked this movie for the first 30 minutes or so. However, I quickly became aware that this film was a narcissistic autobiography that was also serving as anti-Chinese, anti-communist propaganda. I am not Chinese and I am not pro-communist, let me get that out of the way now! However, when a movie highlights all of the flaws of one side, and only highlights all of the positives of the other side, that is a big giveaway that a book or movie is propaganda! Li Cunxin literally thinks the grass is greener on the other side. You can see how he preferred Western women over Chinese women and preferred American architecture, lifestyle and culture. He did come off as selfish in the movie. Let's be honest, he would still be a peasant in rural China if the Chinese government didn't train him as a ballet dancer. He wasn't grateful to them for helping him in his formative years. He abandoned his own country and his family after spending 3 months in America. I don't know, maybe he was brainwashed? Texas is a very Republican state. Perhaps he knew he was special and resented Communist China for not properly compensating him? I did further research while watching the movie and realized that Li eventually became a stockbroker. I know I might be generalizing, but that profession speaks volumes about what kind of personality and political views a person has. I know of another movie by a stockbroker who also portrayed himself as some wonder figure, the guy who wrote the book ""The Pursuit of Happyness."" I started to realize that the movie was all about what a great guy Li Cunxin was, and how he's better than everyone else and why China is such a bad place to live.

I really wasn't expecting to be hit with the propaganda sledgehammer when I rented this movie. The message is also anachronistic, because China is very modern and capitalist now. There was also a lot of hypocrisy. He appears to criticize the Chinese government for making ballet dancers dance with guns and perform propaganda shows, but doesn't also realize that America is also obsessed with guns and war movies? Does he not realize that he also created propaganda himself with his book and movie?

If you want a sappy, feel-good, biased pro-America movie that ignores the facts and reality, this movie might be for you. If you are educated enough to spot blatant propaganda and hate being emotionally manipulated, skip Mao's Last Dancer!",1315180800,5,2424,4.741706161137441

4289361,5,B0049EOFCC,"In Mao's Last Dancer, an eleven year old peasant boy is selected to study ballet in Beijing, China.  Then, he is taken away abruptly from his worried mother and father and many siblings.  Against his will, he discovers his true talent in dancing.  The young boy wonders if he will ever see his family again.

Against the backdrop of the cruel and callous communism movement the young boy develops into a powerful yet graceful ballet dancer.  All the while, he thinks of his family and questions whether dancing is his destiny.

Despite the Red Army's insistence that he is not ready to travel to America, his stern and often criticizing teacher picks him as the one to go to America.  There, he falls in love and is befriended by American dance instructor who helps propel him to international stardom.  He discovers freedom and his dancing skills expand along with his mind.  Every time he performs the crowd is silent as they witness someone performing what he was born to do.

Good things never last, as the young Chinese ballet dancer realizes when he falls in love and has to choose between his girlfriend and his family.  A political conundrum ensues at the American Chinese consulate which leaves everyone wondering what will happen.  I won't give away the ending but I will say this, the love and hope of a mother and father is more powerful than any government, foreign or domestic.  This incredible chronicle is based on a true story; Li Cunxin has loved, suffered and lived the American dream.  That is, to persevere against all odds while preserving one's integrity and believes.

Fate and an arrow shot this young boy from the strongest bow, giving flight to a strong willed man. His arrival as a guest student in the US provided him an eventual path to freedom.

4289369,4,B0049EOFCC,"'Mao's Last Dancer' is an overall enjoyable film about true events in the life of Chinese ballet dance Li Cunxin that in my estimation makes it more watchable then if it were fiction. The dancing scenes sre amazing, but I found the acting to be rather stiff and the relationships explored dull and unemotional. Being based on a true story the plot also suffers from the same malaise that all such actual accounts do, the ending is already known so the possibility of manufacturing any cinematic tension, or anticipation is difficult if not impossible.

My favorite segments of the story where those based in China showing Li's early years of training and the brief glimpses of what life was like during the Mao regime. Definitely the best part of the film.

My rating: -3 Stars- as far as entertainment value goes / -4 Stars- as a true story and associated social commentary.",1309910400,,875,4.75
4289370,4,B0049EOFCC,"On the recommendation of a friend, my wife and I picked up this film and settled in for a cultural experience. In the late '80s, I traveled in China and saw the hints of change happening as Maoism gave way to more modern forms of communism--not that freedom of speech has ever been fully accepted to this day. I was curious to see how this film addressed that time period.

""Mao's Last Dancer"" is based on the true story of Li, a male ballet dancer pulled from a small Chinese village to represent his country and government in the arts. He grows up in an institutional environment, basically raised by the state, just as many Chinese athletes still are to this day. Told in flashbacks, we see how he grew mentally and physically, and when at last he gets a chance to visit America for three months, we see his struggles to reconcile his anti-capitalist upbringing with the freedoms he finds in Houston, Texas. Li's eyes are opened to a world of opportunity and free speech. Even as his Chinese controllers hope to draw him back from the brink, he makes choices that will affect his future as a family man, dancer, and human being.

The flashbacks are done skillfully, making the story easy to follow, and the dance choreography is incredible. Although the film seems long, it is bolstered by its true-to-life source material, and the depictions of Chinese thinking seemed spot-on. My only complaint was a highly manipulative scene, in which the director attempts to fool the audience into believing something that we later find out is not true.

4289372,5,B0049EOFCC,"This recently made very moving film is based on the auto-biography of one of the world's best ballet dancers, Li Cunxin. When he was eleven years old in China, living with his parents and six siblings, a delegation from a Beijing dance academy selected him to study ballet in Beijing far from his family. Mao was the dictator of China at the time and the people lived a cruel, impoverished, ever-fearful life. Li suffered in the academy because of homesickness and harsh treatment. But there was one compassionate teacher at the academy who gave Li advice that helped him become one of China's greatest dancers. Then, he was given the opportunity to dance with a ballet company in Houston, Texas, with the proviso that he must return to China in a month. Li was enchanted by the freedom in America and by the people he met, including a beautiful woman, a member of the ballet company but, unfortunately, not a very good dancer. The film tells what happens to Li when he tells the Chinese officials that he wants to stay in the US, how they kidnap him, what a Texas lawyer does, how he is told that he can never go back to China and never see his family again, how at an emotional moment at the end of a ballet....

4289374,4,B0049EOFCC,"This is an amazing true story based on Li Cunxin's autobiography of the same name. As other reviewers have noted, Li Cunxin grew up poor in rural China as one of 7 sons. He was chosen as a young boy to move to Beijing to participate in a grueling full-time ballet training program. He grew up to become one of China's finest ballet dancers, and was invited to be a guest student with the Houston Ballet in the 70s by then director Ben Stevenson. He fell in love and married a young American dancer, and defected, causing an international incident.

This movie documents all of this beautifully, as well as some subsequent events. The flashbacks to Li's childhood, both in rural China and his later training in Beijing, are very well-done, and are fascinating in their portrayals of China at this time. The dancing is fabulous, especially Li's 'breakout' scene, where he fills in for an injured dancer during an excerpt of Don Quixote. If you like ballet and/or history, you will love this movie.

The only reason I just couldn't quite give it 5-stars was because some of the acting and writing was poor. The scenes between the Elizabeth McCay character (the young women Li initially marries) and Li were very cheesy, and when she leaves for San Francisco, it was not clear they were separating for good. Equally fuzzy was his new relationship with Australian dancer Mary McKendry, whom he eventually married and had (has) a family with in Australia. From what I have read, this actually occurred many years after the break up with Elizabeth McKay, but it was all a bit fuzzy and hard to follow in the film. I also found the final scene, in which Li and his wife visit China and dance for his village, including his once imprisoned early ballet teacher, over-the-top cheesy.

These were small bumps overall though, in an otherwise excellent movie about a fascinating life.",1308614400,3,1871,4.733128834355829

4289388,3,B0049EOFCC,"Mixed thoughts:
Positives:
Great dancing performances and choreographies and as they should be are always going to be engaging. Location scenes were well selected and nicely modified to resemble period village and dance studios.

Negatives (admittedly a few are nuances):
(1.) As someone who tutors exchange students from China I found personal fault with scenes that show the process by which a Chinese limited English speaker would handle English language acquisition as being totally incorrect. That the main actor was already fluent in English and the crew clueless did not help.
(2.) The important cultural respect of presenting gifts such as tea or red good fortune knots were not shown and, alternatively, the behaviors such as handling the personal items of the host without permission were shown. The immense cultural history of China was ignored yet the skyscrapers of Houston were idolized.
(3.) Weak examples of folk morality tales were presented e.g. of the countless frog-in-the-well variations the directors chose the one that is not storytelling strong.
(4.) Although Mao's visage was commonplace I felt that the directors went overboard in using it to showcase the political differences between our two countries; usually associating it with cold heartless mean spirited Communist Party members. It is difficult to compare ideologies that in one case emphasize participation as an honor, not necessarily just for oneself, but for the community and another that promotes it as self-fulfilling personal gain.
(5.) So much movie time was spent on the politics that the most important aspect of being an athlete which is the hard work of training was either not shown or shown briefly and often weakly. As a counterpoint, to show how difficult the training can be, both ""Dancing Across Borders"" and Maria Tallchief's life stories provide a more accurate insight into ""what it takes"".  Relatedly, the coaching sequences were the worst I have seen for any sport. If those techniques were used on real athletes they would have gotten no where except maybe out of their sport.
(6.)  Strange that there was no interview of Li or family members in the Special Features and no indication as to the degree to which he collaborated in the filming.",1305417600,10,2251,5.178571428571429

Adapted from the autobiography by the same name by Li Cunxin and adapted for the screen by Jan Sardi and directed by Bruce Beresford (Driving Miss Daisy, Bride of the Wind, Breaker Morant, Double Jeopardy, etc), this story gradually unfolds in both China and America and is in both Chinese and English.

In the author's own words, 'In a small, desperately poor village in northeast China, a peasant boy sits at his rickety old school desk, interested more in the birds outside than in Chairman Mao's Red Book and the grand words it contains. But that day, some strangers come to his school - Madame Mao's cultural delegates. They are looking for young peasants to mold into faithful guards of Chairman Mao's great vision for China."" ""The boy watches as one of his classmates is chosen and led away. His teacher hesitates. Will she or won't she? She very nearly doesn't. But at the last moment, she taps the official on the shoulder and points to the small boy. ""What about that one?"" she says."" This is the true story of how that one moment in time, by the thinnest thread of chance, changed the course of a small boy's life in ways beyond description. One day he would dance with some of the greatest ballet companies of the world. One day he would be a friend to a president and first lady, movie stars, and some of the most influential people in America. One day he would himself become a star: Mao's last dancer and the darling of the West.'

The film opens when Li Cunxin (Chi Cao, who joined Birmingham Royal Ballet in 1995 and was promoted to Principal in 2002. Trained at the Beijing Dance Academy and the Royal Ballet School. His parents were two of Cunxin Li's former teachers at the Beijing Dance Academy. Li wanted Cao to portray him) is only a peasant boy of 11 (played at that stage by Wen Bin Huang) and proceeds to show us the above described aspects of his life, as a teenager (played by Chengwu Guo) during his training in Beijing, and finally in his visit and eventual defection to America in 1979 - 81. Representing the American aspect of the story is the kind generosity of Houston Ballet choreographer Ben Stevenson (Bruce Greenwood) and dancers and members of the support teams for the ballet. Once in America Li discovers his true talent in classical ballet and wants to remain in America, but the Chinese consulate refuses to let him remain in America, even though Li has met and fallen in love and married. Li is torn - between his love for the family he might never see again (Joan Chen is remarkable as his mother), his love for his wife, and his need to remain where he can polish his gifts as a classical ballet dancer. The well publicized hostage situation in 1981 is included in the film as is the gradual transition of the Chinese growth after the death of Chairman Mao. The ending is a bit saccharine, but by the ending the audience is so enraptured with the story that it all works well. Grady Harp, May 11",1304726400,39,3128,4.49560632688928

4289391,5,B0049EOFCC,"Great insight into how communist China developed dancers for their idea of ballet. The main character (Li) is taken from his family as a young boy and trained by the State for a dance troupe. The head instructor is removed for antiparty sentiments, but not before influencing his favorite pupil.  When a chance to go to America comes up, Li is picked to go. Once he performs with complete freedom to express his creativity, he doesn't want to return to China. It's an inspiring story with a good ending. Dance lovers will thoroughly enjoy the dance scenes.",1304553600,2,556,4.731958762886598

So I was finally able to get my own copy yesterday and watched this incredible movie last night.  For those still looking for the USA market DVD or Blue Ray versions, look no more and go to your near Target and buy your copy.
I usually don't promote other sellers on Amazon's website and I'm quite loyal to them as they are the best vendors in the planet and I get all my movies, books, and cds from them, but I know how frustrating it is when you're looking for something and can't find it anywhere, so I'm making an exception with this product, hoping that Amazon won't mind.

4289418,5,B0049EOFCC,"While so much attention was being focused on ""Black Swan,"" a truly splendid movie about ballet was being virtually ignored in the U.S. The movie is ""Mao's Last Dancer,"" based on the life of dancer Li Cunxin. The film tells of his early years growing up in one of those repressive communes that dotted China's landscape during Mao's reign of terror. Selected for the Beijing ballet, Li trains himself to be a technically ""perfect"" dancer, and gains party approval for his performances in politically saturated ballets glorifying the Red revolution. But when Li is permitted to travel to Houston as a guest artist, he discovers a whole new world that puts him at odds with his Communist background. The film goes on to record his successes in the U.S., his marriage to an American dancer, the attempt of the Chinese embassy to kidnap and return him to China, and more. If you think you know where this film is going, you haven't given it enough credit for providing unexpecteed twists and turns.  The cast is uniformly first-rate, especially Chi Cao (as Li) who is superb as actor and dancer. Director Bruce Beresford handles the narrative masterfully. The musical score by Christopher Gordon combines Eastern and Western music; in itself it is worth the price of admission. The dance sequences are spectacular.

4289424,3,B0049EOFCC,"Australian biopic ""Mao's Last Dancer"" is based on the autobiography of former Chinese-Australian ballet dancer Li Cunxin. Born in mainland China, Li Cunxin was sent from his impoverished village when he was 11 years old as a hopeful candidate for the Beijing Dance Academy. It was the time of Chairman Mao and ""Gang of Four."" He passes the test, and later joins the Huston ballet company as an exchange student. In America, now a young dancer hoping for the future, Li Cunxin has to make a decision that will change his life forever.

""Mao's Last Dancer,"" directed by Bruce Beresford (""Driving Miss Daisy"" ""Tender Mercies""), shares the central theme with another coming-of-age tale ""Billy Elliot,"" but the Australian film is also about the protagonist's conflict between the two different cultures against the backdrop of the changing political climate in China. The script by Jan Sardi (""Shine"" ""The Notebook"") tries to show the young boy's emotional growth by using several episodes in the academy, but what really happened, I suspect, is something less melodramatic than is depicted here. Perhaps we should read the book.

I am no expert, but the ballet dancing scenes are beautiful, strong and convincing (in spite of unnecessary use of occasional slow motions). Chi Cao, principal of the Birmingham Royal Ballet in real life, plays the adult Li Cunxin. He is obviously no professional actor, but he shows what he can do on the stage. Unfortunately, Li's romance (very important even in his life, as it turns) is not very interesting, even emotionally vapid, despite the best efforts from Chi Cao and Amanda Schull (Center Stage).

Bruce Greenwood (""Star Trek"" ""Thirteen Days"") plays Ben Stevenson, artistic director of Houston Ballet. Kyle MacLachlan (""Desperate Housewives"") appears as Li's attorney Charles Forster, but his role (though second-billed) is more like an extended cameo. Joan Chen plays Li Cunxin's mother Niang; Wang Shuang Bao plays his father Dia. Also, the cast includes Jack Thompson in the blink-and-you-will-miss-it cameo.

The film certainly has a good story to tell, which is nearly ruined by clichd storytelling. ""Mao's Last Dancer"" captures the beauty and elegance of ballet dancing, but as to the protagonist's emotions, it does almost.",1296518400,22,2268,5.222527472527473
