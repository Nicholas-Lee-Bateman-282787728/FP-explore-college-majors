4981290,4,B006A4Z8E8,Good movie.  I live on Long Island and this movie was close to the facts.,1472169600,,73,3.8666666666666667
4981291,4,B006A4Z8E8,"This film did something that many films based on true crime don't always do: it humanized the victims.

The killer was chilling...I would have liked to see more of him. Being as the actual killer was never caught, it was interesting to see someone else's perspective on his motives, and his insanity, and the guy portraying him would have made the film much better, had he been in it more.

It is seldom shown why a call girl becomes a call girl, and Jennifer Polansky was excellent at doing just that. The john obsessed with germs made me laugh, a nice surprise since the subject matter is so serious.

I bought it. Glad I did.",1449619200,,628,4.443478260869565
4981292,1,B006A4Z8E8,"Awful.  The dialogue is very unrealistic (prostitutes, law enforcement and killer alike engage in philosophical narratives about the nature of life, death, social inequality, etc.) as the writer seems to want to make a point about society's problems but uses the wrong platform for that message. This was such a distraction I couldn't get past the first 40 min. In one scene, a john w/germ phobia instructs a prostitute in step by step detail what he wants her to do while avoiding any ""contamination"".  While I understand there are individuals who live in that world, I found the inclusion of this scene prurient; it does not forward the plot and is little more than gratuitous, to keep you watching. So many other, better films out there about serial killers, crimes & their sociopathic personality disorders behind their motives: The Hunt for the BTK Killer; Dear Mr. Gacy (about tragic teen, Jason Moss, who 'befriended' imprisoned Gacy via pen pal), Ed Gein ( w/ actor Steve Railsback), The Capture of the Green River Killer, and last but not least,The Stranger Beside Me - Ted Bundy.  Try the A&E documentary on the Long Island Serial Killer - it's much more satisfying than this film.",1449187200,,1191,4.8861386138613865
4981293,5,B006A4Z8E8,"A contemporary film based on the still-at-large serial killer preying on women, largely prostitutes, and discarding their bodies at Gilgo Beach on Long Island bears the potential of being exploitive and offensive to the families of the victims. Writer-producer-director Joseph DiPietro avoids the tacky trappings of the true crime cash-in subgenre and has instead created a compelling and well-drawn examination of the women targeted by the killer. Because of their backgrounds as sex workers, law enforcement, the media, and the Long Island community surrounding the beach have routinely dismissed the victims and shown decreased interest in investigating their murders. DiPietro reveals a fascination with these women, painting them as flesh-and-blood human beings with personalities, families, and a variety of motivations for their work in the sex industry. This provides a unique and provocative aspect to what could have been a simple stalk-and-slash exploitation flick. It's so much more than that. DiPietro's film recalls the kind of thoughtful intelligence found in 1970s adult films from Gerard Damiano and Roger Watkins, films that take equal care with characterization and performance, and the filmmaker even goes so far as to score his work with memorable library music cues from the KPM library. It adds an air of welcome retro atmosphere to what is still a chilling and contemporary story.

Bringing the story to life is a uniformly solid cast of actors and actresses, led by Jennifer Polansky as Tina, a young girl interviewing call girls to learn more about their experiences and philosophies who finds herself tempted to experience the life for herself. Polansky is immensely likable and moving, leading to heartbreaking developments as she picks the wrong client and is forced to beg and fight for her survival. Also of note is Renee Kay as an escort who vanishes in a bizarre turn of events, Dewey Wynn as Kay's dealer searching for her to clear his name of her potential murder, and Chrissy Laboy as one of the killer's pleading victims who shouts devastating reasons why she wants him to spare her life. Adam Ginsberg (who also produced the film) is appropriately disturbing and surprisingly layered as The Killer, and it's a wonderful surprise to see legendary adult film and video actor Rick Savage in a cameo.

Having seen the original full-length director's cut during its theatrical premiere at Anthology Film Archives in New York City, I was concerned about the film being edited into a considerably shorter version, but the finished product still flows beautifully and, most importantly, does not remove the key scenes of characterization and story that make the film so successful in the first place. A large helping of the deleted scenes included on the DVD represent some of the more intriguing moments removed from the original version, so you can get an idea of what was cut out, including more very welcome footage of Renee Kay. The original opening credits are especially worth seeing. You also get two audio commentaries, one with director DiPietro and star Polansky and the other with co-editor Dave Campfield and producer-actor Ginsberg, which really get into the nitty gritty of shooting a low-budget feature film with a tight budget and an even tighter schedule. All things considered, LONG ISLAND SERIAL KILLER is even more impressive when you learn about its breakneck production.

Kudos go not only to DiPietro, Ginsberg, and their very talented cast and crew, but to Wild Eye for bringing this film to a wider audience at long last! This one is absolutely worth your time, and head and shoulders above the usual direct-to-video horror nonsense churned out to make a quick buck.",1444780800,3,3722,5.169154228855722
