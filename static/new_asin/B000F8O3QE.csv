8118999,5,B000F8O3QE,"Brilliant dark comedy with transcendental moments and some truly memorable ""musical"" elements.  There is nothing like this series.  It has something in common with SNL but pushes the envelope much further and is entirely out of the box and not politically correct.  Features some of the most talented actresses and many truly inspired bits.  The anime interview music videos are outrageous.  Virtually everything about this series is groundbreaking.  Note of warning, if you don't get the humor the entire project will not make sense to you.",1360972800,2,541,5.232558139534884
8119000,1,B000F8O3QE,i cant give a review cuz i didn't get the dvd yet it been almost three weeks now. what happened?,1220227200,,96,3.85
8119001,1,B000F8O3QE,"As this is now on On Demand, I thought I would check out the first 'episode'.  I'll admit, I did sit through the whole thing.  Not because it was good, but because I was trying to 'get it'.  Then I realized that there is in no way enough drugs for me to 'get it'.  Really.  It's awful.  It's almost like it's a Japanese view of what America thinks that Japanese TV is like.",1213660800,,373,4.041095890410959
8119002,3,B000F8O3QE,"If you are a fan of random humor and the kind of colors that are meant to be viewed while inibriated, you will love this. It's not quite as erotic as the name implies, but it's fun to watch. Once or twice.",1182902400,,205,3.9047619047619047
8119003,1,B000F8O3QE,"I bought this thinking I'd see something original.  I was only able to sit through 3 or 4 skits before I had to take this DVD out and properly dispose of it.

Most of what I saw was subtitled, you can't get to the english audio.  The Fuccons, which I thought would be funny was utterly stupid!  In the 2nd scene we watch to scantly dressed women poke other women in their bottom with toy hypodermic needles...  then watch them scream, and they all put this to a dance tune.

Anyways, you might like this if you're 13 or grew up in Japan where you can understand this humor.  I found 'Jackass' to be much more entertaining, at least with Jack I was able to wonder just how stupid the participants were, with this DVD, I just can't figure out who was drinking more, the writers, the director or the whole entre cast has too much saki!",1151280000,2,832,4.261146496815287
8119004,5,B000F8O3QE,"I love this DVD -- Some parts are still in Japanese w/ English Subtitles, even when you select English. The best part is to see The Fuccon, but it's subtitle, so it loses some of the effect if they spoke English. It takes awhile to get the Japanese viewpoint, but this is a great dvd to watch if you are having a party. Your friends will love the One Point English Lesson part of the show. I can't wait for Volume 2 to come out.",1151020800,8,428,4.047058823529412
8119005,5,B000F8O3QE,"You have to give a loud applaud to this series! Truely a work of art but highly entertaining and funny. Best way to describe it is like a Japanese take on SNL mixed with modern art! Sometimes very funny, but some skits a tad bit strange. If you love ""The Fuccons"", also released by ADV films, they also have new shorts that are only shown here on Vermillion Pleasure Night. Highlights inculde some fun claymation, an assassian chick, with another assassian living inside her (who then attacks by opening zippers on the first girls body and reaching her weapons out) and some shorts skits that are a mix of Monty Python meets the Blue Man Group. Basically I would recommend it to anyone to atleast watch once to see if they like it.",1150675200,10,731,4.503759398496241
