2531864,5,B000ERVKB2,I can't tell you what this movie was about even thought I did watch it.  What I do remember are parts with Bo and that was just fine. Bo knows how to show off her talents.,1361750400,,171,3.75
2531865,1,B000ERVKB2,"really amateurish- home movies these days are better. A total waste of Bo
Derek's beauty.",1277424000,2,89,5.0
2531866,2,B000ERVKB2,"This was Bo Derek's first movie, filmed some time in the mid-1970s, but released after her success with ""10"". It's interesting for Bo Derek fans to see a young, dark haired Bo Derek. And she's charming as always. But there's really no other reason to see the movie. There's hardly any plot, so the movie gets dull pretty fast.

""Fantasies"" is for Bo Derek completists only.",1187481600,4,373,4.651515151515151
2531867,4,B000ERVKB2,"Bo Derek was only 16 when she starred in this beautifully photographed ""coming-of-age"" film.  As with most of her films, the backstory is more fascinating than the actual movie: A pretty young model (named Cathy Collins) is whisked away to the panoramic Greek island of Mykonos to star in a romantic indpendent film.  She falls in love with director John Derek, a handsome, married, former matinee idol who is 30 years older than her. He eventually marries her and transforms her into the first screen sex goddess of the 1980's. This film showcases Bo's young beauty as Anastasia, the rebellious Greek orphan who lives most of her life like the literary character Walter Mitty, in a complete fantasy world (hence the title). She sails around with her older ""brother"" Damir, played by Peter Hooten, looking for the opportunity to open a resort on the small island where they live. As they discover that they're not really brother and sister, a strange, uneasy love begins to blossom. This is a lovely, sincere film with an odd element of reality slipping in some scenes (note the older photographer who visits the island and creates a 70's fashion photo montage with Bo! The photographer even tells her,""One day, the whole world will want to take your picture!"" He got that right!) There is some incidental nudity, but nothing too extensive like in her later films. This is one of those innocent, sappy movies that helps everyone to fantasize that sometimes, love really does conquer all...",1098230400,20,1489,4.904761904761905

2531892,2,B000ERVKB2,"I have always enjoyed watching Bo Derek (along with most of the male population, I suspect). This however I cannot recommend. It is just about the worst peace of junk B.D. EVER appeared in. So fans, save your dough for another time.",1420761600,4,232,4.5476190476190474

I can't watch entire movie.

8113672,1,B000ERVKB2,"WOW. I understand that this was probably Bo Derek's first film role, but the movie made no sense at all. And why was it dubbed so poorly? Both lead actor's are American. There was no need to dub their voices. The storyline was awful. The acting twice as bad. If it wasn't on Prime, I wouldn't have even given it a second glance. I am putting this down as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And I have seen some stinkers.",1504828800,,427,4.095238095238095
8113673,1,B000ERVKB2,"Worst movie I think I've ever seen. The plot was non-existent, the male lead was idiotic, the Grandpa was a pervert who ripped off Bo Derek's nightgown exposing her boobs. To top it off, Bo laid around sucking her thumb. Avoid at all costs!!!",1501027200,2,242,4.5227272727272725

8113676,2,B000ERVKB2,"The music is insipid, the guy is insufferable, the story is lame. Bo Derek is beautiful, but that's the only good thing about this film since she can't act.",1497139200,4,156,4.413793103448276
8113677,1,B000ERVKB2,"This is close to the worst movie I have ever seen.  The dialog is horrible, the plot is weak, if your looking for a little Bo Derek soft porn, it ain't here either.",1492387200,5,164,3.9696969696969697
