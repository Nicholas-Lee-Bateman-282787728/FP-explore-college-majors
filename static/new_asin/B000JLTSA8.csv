8151869,4,B000JLTSA8,"When I first got THE NAKED GAMES 1 & 2 and discovered that nobody told the babes that they're ALL supposed to be naked ALL the time, I was kind of irked. However, the DVDs have grown on me to the point that I've given them both 4 stars, since the girls ARE very sexy and in sexy outfits when not naked, and the whole thing is lots of fun too. This Volume 2 has a good deal more nakedness on it than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Naked-Games-1/dp/B00065TZSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Naked Games 1</a>&nbsp;does, though. This actually is a series of outdoor games with teams of girls from several countries competing. The games range from silly to fairly serious. In Volume 2 they start off with some calesthenics to warm us up, then we have a bit of shooting basketball (where some girls get totally naked and some topless), then Banana Bull (like a bucking bronco, only here it's a big banana, and the girls get topless here so jiggle jiggle), then Stripper Pole action (ALL get naked!), Rubber Ducky (pushing rubber ducks across a pool - many girls naked or topless), Mini-Trikes Race (little bicycles, no nudity), Lil' Horsies (riding rubber horses, again no nudity), Hot Tubbing (this gets quite hot as naked girls caress!), and Inchworm (sliding on a slick mat, lots topless). There's some nice Bonuses too: Meet the Teams with data and short interviews with each contestant, Trampoline (partly naked), a longer Hot Tub segment (naked), and Outtakes that's mostly funny stuff. As I mentioned, there's a good deal more nudity in this Volume 2 then there was in Volume 1, though still not total. The hot tub scenes get pretty wild, bordering on X-rated. The run time of the main program is about an hour, with the extras running a total of about half an hour (I'll have to time it to be more exact, sorry). All in all, it's a very fun show, and I've watched both volumes of it a bunch of times.",1340496000,4,1943,4.820359281437126
8151870,4,B000JLTSA8,"A fun spoof of the olympics. Naked Games features four teams of women ,representing France, Russia, Japan, and USA, competing in five events. The games are banana bull(banana shaped mechanical bull), rubber ducky(women in pool push rubber ducky with breasts), mini bike race, rubber horsies(inflatable ball that women bounce up and down on), and inche worm(women crawl without using their arms on cream covered tarp). As benign as those events sound, due to intoxication, the women almost always wipeout, crash, or fall and hit head. In between each event is a segment of the  Naked Games cheerleaders disrobing and making out with each other. The hosts Wee Man and Tom Flynn are hilarious.",1337990400,,690,5.106194690265487
8151871,3,B000JLTSA8,"This video wasn't a total disappointment. It was actually kind of funny. The girls were pretty, and many of them were topless at least part of the time. The events are kind of ridiculous. Think drunken beach games, not actual sports.",1234915200,6,233,4.7073170731707314
