8677895,1,B00NGAJAFM,"I saw the Blu Ray version available for sale and bought it based on the description on the cover. The overall approach in the film is to show a short clip from a movie and have a quote from a director or a short excerpt from an interview with the director. The clips are so short that you don't really understand the intent if you haven't seen the movie already. There is no overall narrative or voice-over that guides the viewer along. Instead, you have a series of disjointed statements and clips with no overall flow. Most of the directors are not well-known and some are just plain weird. I watched it all the way through and the only thing that I learned was that there are really weird creeps that exist on the periphery of cinema. I love watching movies but this is definitely not for me. This production must have been targeted for hard-core, film-obsessed people in the industry and not for the normal viewer.",1440806400,,918,4.502994011976048

8677897,4,B00NGAJAFM,"If the name of the Director of this 78-minute film (produced in 2013)  Chuck Workman  sounds familiar it is because it is Workman who creates the tightly edited film montages which used to open the Annual Oscar Awards (before they were replaced by musical comedy numbers) and is probably still responsible for the IN Memorium segments for the Oscars, Emmys and Tony Awards. Hes an expert at editing clips to a musical soundtrack. I always loved his work and thats what brought me to this BD from Cohen Media Group.

Yes, there are clips from films you know like Vertigo, The Smiling, Bonnie and Clyde and, even Michael Moores Roger & Me.  But thats about the limit for mainstream films. Workman is more concerned with foreign and, even more, experimental films. The opening interview is with David Lynch and then Jonas Mekas takes over the screen. We see a lot of films from the French New Wave and there is a lengthy discussion of both Japanese director Akiro Kurosawas classic film Ran and French documentary about Kurosawa (A.K.) by Chris Marker. Workman uses both archival interviews (Alfred Hitchcock, Robert Altman) with new interviews with Mike Leigh, Moore and quite a few independent directors who were new to me.

If you are a fan of classic foreign films or experimental films (which are all about images and not a plot) then youll definitely want to see the film and get the Bluray version. The reason is that there are 10 experimental films (some excerpted in the documentary) that go back as far as the 1930s included as a bonus. Together, these bonuses run nearly two hours!

If you have a general interest in film as art, I think youll learn about new, lesser known filmakers.
But if you are looking for the kind of short collages that Workman makes for the Awards shows, I think you might find this film a bit boring/ Its certainly not mainstream.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
