7955463,3,B00005UQ8B,A interesting set of videos. It is not one that I will play often or share with my friends or family.,1400803200,,101,3.857142857142857
7955464,3,B00005UQ8B,"This was a good script that needed development. Great comedy about an Irish Catholic family with a mother who is on the wagon and imposes her abstinence on the rest of the family, cousins that want to marry, a daughter that wants to divorce, and a gay son. Plenty of fertile ground that they really didn't know what to do with. Movie comes off more as a student film project than a professional film.",1364256000,,400,4.418918918918919
7955465,5,B00005UQ8B,Lots of family interaction and true to life.  Fine job by all.  Piper Laurie is wonderful as the mother.  A fine ending as well.,1356480000,,128,4.25
7955466,3,B00005UQ8B,"This film is not for the average person.  It is full of continuous conversation and small talk, so be sure you like this kind of film before you get it.  That said, it is about an Irish-American extended family who gather together at one of the relative's houses to celebrate St. Patrick Day.  The film displays some Irish customs in the way that My Big Fat Greek Wedding displays many Greek customs (the latter being a much better film).  I bought this film hoping for it to be something good to watch as a family, with my young daughter.  Fortunately, I previewed it alone before allowing my daughter to watch it (it's rated PG-13, and my daughter is 10).  More than anything else, this film explores the sex lives of three-quarters of those at the family reunion, meaning from young adults through retired oldsters.  They have done a good job of it, with some sensitive portrayals, marriage conflicts (that would be most appreciated by those married 15 years or longer), some good Irish music, and a few humorous moments thrown in.  I don't feel it's an appropriate subject for watching as a family, except perhaps with older teenagers, or adult children.  I bought this film, but it's not one I'm eager to watch again.",1080864000,2,1222,4.672897196261682
