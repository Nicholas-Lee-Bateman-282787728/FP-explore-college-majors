8331427,5,B001OSC4GU,This will educate you. It will amaze you. It's done exactly that for our daughter who's been watching this since she was 3.  She's now near 12 and still loves it.  So do her parents. We've gifted this to family and friends. The love it too.  All National Geographic dvds on human and animal development are superb.,1477699200,,314,4.473684210526316
8331428,5,B001OSC4GU,I purchased this DVD for my science class. It has a lot of interesting facts which proved a discussion in my class which is what I wanted.,1470960000,,138,4.148148148148148
8331429,3,B001OSC4GU,"Maybe I've watched too many ""In the Womb"" shows, but somehow this one was not as interesting as ""Multiples"". I was expecting much more information on identical twins.",1328054400,3,166,4.964285714285714
8331430,3,B001OSC4GU,"I thought the DVD would be more about the interaction between the twins in the WOMB, before they are born. But it's mosty about how they end up looking different, and acting different through out life, and in not too deep of an explianation.",1320105600,4,241,4.5
8331431,2,B001OSC4GU,"Being pregnant with a rare type of identical twins (monchorionic/single afterbirth), I had high expectations of this video.  I paid for extra shipping because my husband and I wanted to watch it so badly.  VERY disappointing.  This video does not focus very much on the actual science and miracle of twins.  But rather, the studies on homosexuality of one twin verses heterosexualism in the other.  It went off on a huge tangent about this study.  Don't waste your money, plan to catch it on tv for free so you can only watch the parts that ARE ACTUALLY about twins instead of their sexuality theories.",1298851200,10,602,4.740384615384615
8331432,4,B001OSC4GU,"The images and depictions of the various stages of development are incredible.  I would recommend this for any life science, biology, or similar instruction.  This would be great for high school with guidance from the teacher.",1258761600,2,226,5.25
8331433,4,B001OSC4GU,"This documentary shows how identical twins are created.  However, it discusses many pairs of identical twins who look nothing alike.  For example, they showed identical twins in which one twin was just half the size of the other.  The point is that numerous factors during pregnancy can affect the twins differently.  As a person who hates science, I found this work friendly, rather than science-dorky.  I would consider giving this as a gift to people who are twins.",1254700800,4,468,4.948717948717949
