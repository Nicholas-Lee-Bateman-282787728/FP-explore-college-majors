This burlesque-style TV special featured Don Rickles, Don Adams, Carol Wayne and a cast of unknowns in a variety of blackout skits, musical numbers and comedy routines. Of interest now primarily for its two stars, who were not only close friends but worked well together on stage. (Ap. running time: 40 mins.)
