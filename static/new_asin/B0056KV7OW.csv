4592444,4,B0056KV7OW,"This is an enjoyable DVD, and a good addition to my collection. However, it is not as enjoyable to me as some. I do have The Old Rugged Cross, which, I believe, was done at the same time, and I think I like it better, but I would not want to lose either of them.

I realize that this is not much of a review, but there was nothing sufficiently specific that I can mention. Mostly, this DVD received five stars, so someone disagrees with me.  I think that the Gaither's do a good job of giving us variety, and I do have a couple of their other DVDs I seldom play. Yet, considering that I have about 64, this is not bad, huh?",1405296000,2,623,4.016129032258065

I am so disappointed and will never buy anything from the Gaither's again.  We have never had this problem with amazon in the past, and I am partially to blame for not playing it sooner.",1404172800,,448,4.045454545454546

4592498,5,B0056KV7OW,"Every now and then, Gaither Homecoming has some remarkable double programs.  And this unique concert was recorded at the Billy Graham Library, in North Carolina.  You will get a tour.  Surprisingly, two elderly guests who performed with Graham are here, Cliff Barrows 89, music and program director for the Graham organization, and America's beloved gospel singer, 104-year old George Beverly Shea.

It is great to see some of the old timers included in the 140 of gospel singers, namely Ben Speer.  This wonderful program recaptures the spirit and fun of the old fashioned tent revival gospel music.

The performers have replicated the dress of the 50's and 60's, complete with the huge tent and sawdust on the floor.

To start the program, one of the first songs of the Gaithers that introduced me to the Homecoming Friends...and that is ""Yes, I Know"", a long-time favorite.  I love the upbeat ""Jesus Hold My Hand"" and one I had not heard before, ""Down to the River"".  Enjoy the classic ""When the Saints Go Marching In"".

There is a person, new to me, and her name is Taranda Green.  If you enjoyed her singing, she does have a strong presence here thoughout.

8459734,5,B0056KV7OW,"I love this dvd. Almost all the songs here speak to my heart...it might be because I reside in Korea, which is populated by so many atheists and Buddhists,  whose culture and way if life are so far and different from what I believe is a lifestyle of love for and worship of God.
This dvd brings lots of gospel favorites and the Gaither family just have a wonderful way singing ,it just gives me and my little kid joy to watch them perform, over and over.",1507593600,,454,4.218390804597701
