3175657,5,B0017VG67W,It hearts my heart to see the show cancelled on the 8th season i beleve the ratigs dropped when jill marie jones left i think they should of brought her back on the show and made some kind of deal to get her back she and todd bought more drama to the show  i heard there supposed to be a girlfriends movie yep thats right a movie there getting calls about doing the movie to girlfriends if she was on the show it would stayed on the air on the cw channel why it had to end.,1210809600,10,473,3.8762886597938144

Every episode is funny, heartwarming, and surprisely real. I agree with the reviewer above mine, this show was unfairly cancelled in the middle of the 8th season, I hope the network gives these talented ladies a proper ending to this funny show. I highly recommend purchasing this fabulous show, you'll love it!",1210032000,14,470,4.7439024390243905
3175659,5,B0017VG67W,"Most of the Girlfriends fans are hurt that the show was cancelled in the middle of the 8th season ending just right after the strike was officially called off. And after Jill Marie Jones withdrew from the show, the ratings declined, plus of un-proper promotions. I did hear talks about the final ladies (Tracee, Golden and Perisa) filing a lawsuit because of the 22 episode order that was originally stated in contract hasn't been completed. Only 13 were broadcast.

On a positive note, I don't know if anyone has seen the box art cover to season 4 of Girlfriends on TVShowsOnDVD.com but it's hella hot, hella, sexy. It's still unclear if there will be any special features, at least CBS/Paramount cared enough to still produce Girlfriends on DVD.

In fact, NONE of the original music used during the original broadcast was included in these DVD's, except for the opening & closing theme song. The opening theme song (included in the DVD) does have the original singer Angie Stone singing however, it sounds more like she is singing through a long hallway with a terrible echo and this is not the same poor quality found in the original network broadcast. It's a shame that this show was never given a proper series finale and it appears that they put the same lack of consideration to their DVD distribution.

3175688,4,B0017VG67W,This season is pretty funny but the fifth season is better. I love this show. It became more mature in the fifth season.,1380931200,,120,4.260869565217392

3175707,5,B0017VG67W,"I happen to misplace this whole season, so I ordered another one. I love this show because they are the everyday women that I can relate to. They kept me entertained and intrigued. It's one of my favorite all time shows.",1355702400,,220,4.390243902439025

3175709,5,B0017VG67W,"This season was really great, the cast chemistry and strong storylines kept my interest. My favorite storylines were:

*Joan falling for Ellis' agent Brock - the chemistry between Tracee & Malik Yoba was/is off the hook.  The instant attraction between the two characters is magical or ""enchanted"" and believable whereas I NEVER got the Joan/Ellis pairing;

*Toni & Todd's marital woes as they struggle to get to know one another;

*Maya adjusting to the single life and

*Joan's career detour

I also have to give a shout out to the supporting cast members:  Lamont Johnson (Maya's cousin, Ronnie) - he is hilariously OTT; Shawn Harrison (Peaches) - although OTT in his portrayal as a flamboyant gay man, he made me LOL when he worked as Joan's assistant; Phil Reeves (Mr Swedelson)- so inappropriately oblivious in his comments; Ann Marie Johnson (Sharon Upton Farley) - so perfectly cast as the uptight new senior partner and finally the incredible Jenifer Lewis (Verreta Childs, Toni's mom) - always sassy she doesn't bite her tongue for anyone.

The only negative comment I have about the set is the lack of extras which were abundant in previous dvd seasons.",1344038400,,1164,4.963917525773196
3175710,3,B0017VG67W,"This season had its highs and lows, but the thing that stands out the most to me is the terrible writing for Toni.  Toni is HORRIBLE and even more of a shallow beyotch than she normally is.  I literally roll my eyes everytime she starts to talk.  I still like Toni the best though.

Joan is so annoying and too tense.  I don't see why any fun person would want to be around her tense anal butt.

Another issue I had is that Toni and Todd have NO chemistry whatsover.  When Todd is around Toni he looks beat down and weak.  These two should have never been paired.

Finally, I like that the weaves have gotten better.  Toni's weave is banging and so is Maya's.  One crazy episode was Maya not wanting to date a SECURITY GUARD.  Her ex husband is a baggage handler; she really has no room to be bougee.

Update: I spoke too soon.  Toni wore a wig after the banging weave and then had some sort of hairstyle that doesn't match her personality.

Highs of this season:
1. The realism of Joan not being fulfilled in her job and quitting
2. Toni deciding to get therapy and her mother making her choose Todd finally.

Lows:
1. Toni's personality is horrible.
2. William's corny personality is horrible.
3. Joan would drive a priest crazy with her over the top personality.

HIGHLIGHTS:

1. Thelma from Goodtimes was the object of Williams desire.  I hadn't seen her in 20 years and was happy to see her.
2. Lamont from Sanford and Son is Lynne's father.  I hadn't seen him in 20 years and was glad to see him.",1305849600,,1502,4.315412186379929
3175711,5,B0017VG67W,I loved when Girlfriends used to come on air. So when I saw that they had it on Amazon for a very good price i had to get it. The DVD came on time and it had no scratches I was very pleased.,1302480000,,190,3.441860465116279
3175712,5,B0017VG67W,"There was NEVER a show whereby I LOVED EVERY SINGLE CAST!!!  NEVER!  EVER!!  I love every single star on Girlfriends.  It's true to life, the only ""Reality"" show there ever was.  We've all been through the same life's dilemmas as these girlfriends, and they always have the right problem-solving techniques.  It's a learning experience in comedy format.  It was my favorite show EVER, and I STILL watch them on my DVDs.  I know virtually every word.  lol  The best TV investment anyone can make; whether you're black, white, Latino, Asian, Jewish, whatever.  We all have similar life events.  I wish they would bring it back; same cast.",1288569600,,636,4.841121495327103
3175713,4,B0017VG67W,"I loved every moment of this season! I got the DVD for Christmas and watched it all in about a week. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 starts is because I wanted more extra's in this DVD set. Season 3 shared behind the scene's interviews about the cast and their fashion and I wanted more of that in season 4, but otherwise it was funny, it was sad, it was Girlfriends at it's best. I look forward to buying season 5 soon.",1265155200,,427,4.035294117647059

3175715,4,B0017VG67W,"Girlfriends The Fourth Season is not as surprising and funny as seasons 1 to 3 were, but I enjoyed the series yet again.

Great for a marathon session of man trouble, quirky girlfriends and good laughs!

Fortunately both seasons 4 and 5 work just fine on my region-free Dutch dvd player.",1233619200,,287,4.607843137254902

3175717,3,B0017VG67W,"its a good season, i have bought 4 seasons of this series so far, and every season had an error on one of the disc, I have missed at least 2 of the episodes per season to this fault. But other than that its good for a laugh.",1222992000,2,224,3.6875
3175718,5,B0017VG67W,"great series, i liked it. the only thing i didn't like was the main character female. grossly unattractive, forehead was too big, eyes bulging, looks like either a fish or BOZO the clown, made my headache just seeing her. i think her name was joan or soemthing like that. other than that, the show was pretty smooth...",1221955200,,318,4.5964912280701755
3175719,5,B0017VG67W,My only regret is I have gotten nothing done since the arrival of season 4 in my mailbox.  I can't stop watching.  The acting and writing on this show are truly brilliant.  I just want to know when season 5 will be available?!,1218412800,,226,4.209302325581396
3175720,5,B0017VG67W,"I don't care what nobody say about Different World, 227, and Living Single, Girlfriends was ONE of the shows of my prime that I totally enjoyed! I enjoy the other shows as well but I'm glad their bringing out the DVDS now because the show was just GREAT!! Even when JILL MARIE left the show It was still great and I hope they do get a respectful ending because this show was NUMBER 1 in Black households for seven(7) years and to come because It's on DVD!!! Before DIFFERENT WORLD 227 & LIVING SINGLE!!",1217289600,,502,4.351063829787234
3175721,5,B0017VG67W,"I cannot wait for this release.  I might hang the expense and get fast shipping for it.  I think each and every season gets better and better.
The first episode in season 4 is one of my absolute favourites in the entire series.  It's called Some Enchanted Evening and Joan is trying to get out of the rain and shares a doorway with a stranger.  Later she finds out that he is her boyfriends agent, Brock.  One thing leads to another and they kiss and end up at Brocks place.  He won't sleep with her while she is still dating Ellis so she agrees to break up with Ellis.  However, she has always wanted Ellis to declare his love for her and what do you know; he does.  Toni and Todd are having trouble in their new marriage and she finds out that he is deep in debt and leaves him.
I cannot say enough good things about Girlfriends.  It's always funny yet it has it's 'dramatic' moments too.  It's very relatable to many women out there trying to find themselves and trying to meet Mr Right or to make their own relationships work.  I love the friendships these girls have with each other and they always have each others back.  I truly feel that it's very very underated and that's sad.  This is such a great comedy that should appeal to so many people and should never have been cancelled.  I cannot wait for this to arrive and I know I'm going to enjoy each and every minute watching this (and re-watching it too).",1214870400,13,1416,4.29433962264151
3175722,5,B0017VG67W,"I am super excited to watch girlfriends this summer. It's the perfect release time because most of us students are on vacation and need some drama in our lives until school is back in session!! However, I have been watching this show since I was a freshman in high school. I hope they release all of the seasons including season 8 although it was abrutly cancelled. The release should be done on the behalf of all the dedicated fans such as myself.",1213574400,9,448,4.475609756097561
3175723,5,B0017VG67W,"I've been a fan of Girlfriends since day one and was so disappointed when they canceled the show. Those were my girls. I have Seasons 1,2 and 3 from here and Seasons 7 and 8 from itunes. All i need are 4, 5 and 6 and my collection will be complete.",1213401600,8,248,3.8823529411764706
3175724,5,B0017VG67W,"I am so happy that Girlfriends season 4 is slated for release this summer. It is definitely a must have for me.  Although, I am a huge fan who still supported the show, I must admit that the episodes were not as interesting or as entertaining without Jill Marie Jones in the midst of things. In my opinion, I don't feel that this show could have survived even if Jill had stayed, and one of the other main characters had left. For me, Girlfriends was at its best when all of the original character's were front and center. I love Jill, Golden, Tracee, Persia and Reggie because all of them are so talented and their characters worked so well together, and made the show a hit. It is just a fact, having the right ""chemistry"" means everything and when the ""chemistry"" is altered then things just don't gel together as well. With such a talented cast of individuals, for me it is a major disappointment that the SOMEONE'S at the CW network did not make an intelligent decision to take care of this  wonderful cast and allow the show to ""go out in style, and on top."" I hope the Girlfriend's fans can get the finale we truly deserve!!",1210896000,11,1131,4.4066985645933014
3175725,5,B0017VG67W,"I am trying to understand the logic behind releasing more seasons of a show that was recently cancelled in it's mid season while great, pioneering shows such as ""Living Single"", ""A Different World"" & ""227"" are still on season 1 as releases. I love ""Girlfriends"" but the frequency that they release ""Girlfriends"", there isn't going to be a complete season 8 and let's face it, not many people are going to buy it after the season that Jill leaves.",1210896000,9,446,4.658227848101266

2. Lamont from Sanford and Son is Lynne's father.  I hadn't seen him in 20 years and was glad to see him.",1305849600,,1502,4.315412186379929
3410208,5,B0017VG67W,I loved when Girlfriends used to come on air. So when I saw that they had it on Amazon for a very good price i had to get it. The DVD came on time and it had no scratches I was very pleased.,1302480000,,190,3.441860465116279
3410209,5,B0017VG67W,"There was NEVER a show whereby I LOVED EVERY SINGLE CAST!!!  NEVER!  EVER!!  I love every single star on Girlfriends.  It's true to life, the only ""Reality"" show there ever was.  We've all been through the same life's dilemmas as these girlfriends, and they always have the right problem-solving techniques.  It's a learning experience in comedy format.  It was my favorite show EVER, and I STILL watch them on my DVDs.  I know virtually every word.  lol  The best TV investment anyone can make; whether you're black, white, Latino, Asian, Jewish, whatever.  We all have similar life events.  I wish they would bring it back; same cast.",1288569600,,636,4.841121495327103
3410210,4,B0017VG67W,"I loved every moment of this season! I got the DVD for Christmas and watched it all in about a week. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 starts is because I wanted more extra's in this DVD set. Season 3 shared behind the scene's interviews about the cast and their fashion and I wanted more of that in season 4, but otherwise it was funny, it was sad, it was Girlfriends at it's best. I look forward to buying season 5 soon.",1265155200,,427,4.035294117647059
3410211,5,B0017VG67W,"A truely great searies with talented individuals that offer laughs and fun, with authentic and timeless material. I love the combination of characters and how they contribute to the message of each episode.",1251676800,,206,5.2727272727272725
3410212,4,B0017VG67W,"Girlfriends The Fourth Season is not as surprising and funny as seasons 1 to 3 were, but I enjoyed the series yet again.

Great for a marathon session of man trouble, quirky girlfriends and good laughs!

Fortunately both seasons 4 and 5 work just fine on my region-free Dutch dvd player.",1233619200,,287,4.607843137254902
3410213,5,B0017VG67W,"Even though all the girlfriends are having a tuff time in this season, they still make you laugh and cry in the same episode. I can not wait for Girlfriends season 5 to come to me in the mail!!!",1230595200,,194,4.0
3410214,3,B0017VG67W,"its a good season, i have bought 4 seasons of this series so far, and every season had an error on one of the disc, I have missed at least 2 of the episodes per season to this fault. But other than that its good for a laugh.",1222992000,2,224,3.6875
3410215,5,B0017VG67W,"great series, i liked it. the only thing i didn't like was the main character female. grossly unattractive, forehead was too big, eyes bulging, looks like either a fish or BOZO the clown, made my headache just seeing her. i think her name was joan or soemthing like that. other than that, the show was pretty smooth...",1221955200,,318,4.5964912280701755
3410216,5,B0017VG67W,My only regret is I have gotten nothing done since the arrival of season 4 in my mailbox.  I can't stop watching.  The acting and writing on this show are truly brilliant.  I just want to know when season 5 will be available?!,1218412800,,226,4.209302325581396
3410217,5,B0017VG67W,"I don't care what nobody say about Different World, 227, and Living Single, Girlfriends was ONE of the shows of my prime that I totally enjoyed! I enjoy the other shows as well but I'm glad their bringing out the DVDS now because the show was just GREAT!! Even when JILL MARIE left the show It was still great and I hope they do get a respectful ending because this show was NUMBER 1 in Black households for seven(7) years and to come because It's on DVD!!! Before DIFFERENT WORLD 227 & LIVING SINGLE!!",1217289600,,502,4.351063829787234
3410218,5,B0017VG67W,"I cannot wait for this release.  I might hang the expense and get fast shipping for it.  I think each and every season gets better and better.
The first episode in season 4 is one of my absolute favourites in the entire series.  It's called Some Enchanted Evening and Joan is trying to get out of the rain and shares a doorway with a stranger.  Later she finds out that he is her boyfriends agent, Brock.  One thing leads to another and they kiss and end up at Brocks place.  He won't sleep with her while she is still dating Ellis so she agrees to break up with Ellis.  However, she has always wanted Ellis to declare his love for her and what do you know; he does.  Toni and Todd are having trouble in their new marriage and she finds out that he is deep in debt and leaves him.
I cannot say enough good things about Girlfriends.  It's always funny yet it has it's 'dramatic' moments too.  It's very relatable to many women out there trying to find themselves and trying to meet Mr Right or to make their own relationships work.  I love the friendships these girls have with each other and they always have each others back.  I truly feel that it's very very underated and that's sad.  This is such a great comedy that should appeal to so many people and should never have been cancelled.  I cannot wait for this to arrive and I know I'm going to enjoy each and every minute watching this (and re-watching it too).",1214870400,13,1416,4.29433962264151
3410219,5,B0017VG67W,"I am super excited to watch girlfriends this summer. It's the perfect release time because most of us students are on vacation and need some drama in our lives until school is back in session!! However, I have been watching this show since I was a freshman in high school. I hope they release all of the seasons including season 8 although it was abrutly cancelled. The release should be done on the behalf of all the dedicated fans such as myself.",1213574400,9,448,4.475609756097561
3410220,5,B0017VG67W,"I've been a fan of Girlfriends since day one and was so disappointed when they canceled the show. Those were my girls. I have Seasons 1,2 and 3 from here and Seasons 7 and 8 from itunes. All i need are 4, 5 and 6 and my collection will be complete.",1213401600,8,248,3.8823529411764706
3410221,5,B0017VG67W,"I am so happy that Girlfriends season 4 is slated for release this summer. It is definitely a must have for me.  Although, I am a huge fan who still supported the show, I must admit that the episodes were not as interesting or as entertaining without Jill Marie Jones in the midst of things. In my opinion, I don't feel that this show could have survived even if Jill had stayed, and one of the other main characters had left. For me, Girlfriends was at its best when all of the original character's were front and center. I love Jill, Golden, Tracee, Persia and Reggie because all of them are so talented and their characters worked so well together, and made the show a hit. It is just a fact, having the right ""chemistry"" means everything and when the ""chemistry"" is altered then things just don't gel together as well. With such a talented cast of individuals, for me it is a major disappointment that the SOMEONE'S at the CW network did not make an intelligent decision to take care of this  wonderful cast and allow the show to ""go out in style, and on top."" I hope the Girlfriend's fans can get the finale we truly deserve!!",1210896000,11,1131,4.4066985645933014
3410222,5,B0017VG67W,"I am trying to understand the logic behind releasing more seasons of a show that was recently cancelled in it's mid season while great, pioneering shows such as ""Living Single"", ""A Different World"" & ""227"" are still on season 1 as releases. I love ""Girlfriends"" but the frequency that they release ""Girlfriends"", there isn't going to be a complete season 8 and let's face it, not many people are going to buy it after the season that Jill leaves.",1210896000,9,446,4.658227848101266
