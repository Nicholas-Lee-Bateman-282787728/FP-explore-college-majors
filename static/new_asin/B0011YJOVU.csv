8242927,5,B0011YJOVU,The Digital 5.1 was fine on my DVD.  I mainly bought the DVD because there are so few DVD's featuring Saimir Pirgu.  The acting was very good as was the singing.  I enjoyed it enough to purchase the CD as well.  There are mp3 samples to listen to under a different listing which I would recommend and yes I would recommend this DVD if you enjoy lighter comical works.,1369526400,2,367,4.27536231884058
8242928,4,B0011YJOVU,"My DVD is fine, everything in sinc, and the performance while not perhaps great is certainly better than 'not very good' - the female lead is very good with her main solo near the end, and overall it moves along well, with very distinguishable signs of the later works of Rossini appearing all through the music - quite enjoyable overall. Maybe not quite a 4, but more than a 3.",1367020800,,378,4.414285714285715
8242929,1,B0011YJOVU,"Dr. J. J. Kregarman is correct in his comment that the video is out of sync. Our copy purchased in late November 2008 is similarly defective.  No great loss as the singing and staging are way, way below that of another easily available dvd by EuroArts conducted by Gelmetti, directed by Hampe staring Del Carlo, Hall, Rinaldi and the always appealing David Kuebler.",1227225600,6,365,4.7936507936507935
8242930,3,B0011YJOVU,"On my copy of this DVD the Dts track was way out of sync - over 20 seconds ahead of the picture.  Naxos was contacted but was not very helpful. The stereo track, on the other hand, was quite all right.  I do not know if all the DVDs of this opera are the same.  Buyer beware & check yours early!",1222905600,9,295,3.80327868852459
