487220,3,6302637899,"The Blu-ray-Disk works perfect, the ""Show"" is GREAT and is exactly what I expected.
So why only 3 Stars???
1) I have a MacBook Pro that does NOT accept Blu-ray-discs, so I had to buy a separate Blu-ray-player
2) In order to play the disk I had to bought an additional software
3) I live in Germany. It is NOT possible to buy the ORIGINAL Rocky Horror Picture Show in this country without some manipulations on the disc, therefore I bought it in the USA (AMAZON.COM and NOT AMAZON.DE)
4) In the box of the Blu-ray-disc Century Fox announces: ""instantly stream and download"" ... a) go to FoxRedeem.com, b) enter your redemption code, c) select you preferred service. By doing this the system answers: this is only valid in the USA, for other countries use code xxxx. So I entered that code. Answer again: this does not work in Germany. If you need help contact: xxxx@xxx So I contacted that email address.
After a few days the answer of ""20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"" came in: a long and friendly text telling me in German that the service offered in the box of the product I bought is not valid outside of the USA.
CONCLUSION: if you buy products of ""Century Fox"" be careful because they offer services on the box of the product you bought which might be limited to certain countries only although this is NOT MENTIONED ON THE PRODUCT. So in fact you are paying for a service which in reality eventually you can not use.",1509321600,,1426,4.5096525096525095

487253,5,6302637899,"Outrageous.
Over the top.
Campy.
""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" is all of that and much more. A little dated now that it's more than 40 years old, it's still wonderful both for the singing (Tim Curry could really wail in those days) and for its flaunting of the uptight, ""greed is good"" mindset of the United States in those days. I mean, this movie came out at a time when suit-clad men and women went to work 60 hours a week not to feed their families because their wages were so low but because they wanted to be the first on their block to buy a BMW. It hit theaters at a time when conservative politicians were deregulating banks and allowing industries to ship jobs overseas while still giving them massive tax breaks, Those were gray days and there are those of us who think the United States has yet to recover from them.
And yet, somehow, ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" burst like a stockings-and-garter-belt bomb into the midst of those grayest of days. It celebrated  - and still does - individuality and freedom of expression. It thumbed its nose at convention and poked fun at the ""straights"" who believed then - and still do - that the world is theirs to do with as they please.
And it was - and still is - great fun.
The wonder is that this movie was not only made by a major studio - 20th Century Fox, which is now under the thumb of arch-conservative Rupert Murdoch - but widely released. More than four decades later it's still playing in theaters around the country.
There must be a reason for that.",1504137600,,1520,4.409252669039146

487260,5,6302637899,"The Rocky Horror Picture Show, based off the Broadway musical of the same name, is one of the best films in the history of cinema. The story is all kinds of clever and worthwhile, the content is the best kind of weird and iffy, the characters have loads of variety and are highly quotable, the cast was very well picked and are really good singers, speaking of which, the songs are beyond excellent and well crafted (I went as far as to memorize the entirety of ""Science Fiction Double Feature"" for hype and preparation for the film). If you enjoy things like musicals, weirdness, transylvanian-inspired architecture and set design, or are wondering who Tim Curry is, here you go. I recommend giving this film a look.

487808,4,6302637899,"The RockyHorror picture show 1975 is by far the best films ever , along with being one of the best I guess you could collect call classics ever made also. So after seeing the new one with Laverne Cox , which I actually was thoroughly impressed with that I gave that five stars. So I highly recommend checking it out , it's revamped a little bit statically for the new era. It's kind of lost that universal look to it in some areas not entirely . Anyways it's just modernized as far as some of the Lipsko , plus I love the back that since it is about a transsexual the new one actually has AME nominated transsexual/transgender actress who is amazing , just like Tim Curry . Anyways back to this original version of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, the new remastered version especially in HD looks phenomenal. Especially on the scenes like when they bring Rockyville life, when the popcorn thing is happening where they throw it like rice over them as if they got married. It's almost like they turn that into a 3D at back so when you watch it HD it's coming out of the TV . Maybe they changed it also, because when you go to see it in theaters people interact with the movie . That could also be why it looks different than what I used to have . But it's hundred percent improved by far from even the 25th for Shannon , the 35th anniversary version . So when they put it on Blu-ray , and then made it also available in HD . Everything is so vibrant and , the parts that sparkled slightly in other formats look so three-dimensional and it's not a 3D film as anybody that CNET knows , will be blown away at how well they touched it up. Anyways , the reason why I'm giving it four stars even though I gave the other 5, I agree with the top reviewer , or the person that's on top right now , which is the audio at least on my system when I played on anything without headphones is very glitchy . Almost like it fades in and out as if it is already hooked up /program to play on the sound system which it's not and any other video I bought in standard or high-definition will still play in a different type of audio like another video service I can't mention on here , and not sound like that. Other than that it is fine if you have a sound system and amplifying so that's the only reason why gets for as it's not 100% perfect , it's 85 :-)",1477353600,4,2334,4.131868131868132

But with that being said, the sounds quality on the version they rent is pretty bad. Super quiet dialog, but then when the music kicks in it's super loud, and sometimes it alternates within a song. Tried changing settings on the TV, but that didn't help much. Definitely would have gotten five stars from me if the audio had been better.",1476662400,19,498,4.423913043478261

487947,3,6302637899,"There's a reason movies like RHPS still have such a loyal and dedicated fan base over 40 years after its release.  The performances, sets, costume design and general themes were years beyond the mainstream, and probably especially shocking (and fun!) for audiences back in the day.

While it's beloved for its campiness, it does contain solid acting, particularly from the great Tim Curry. Never has a man looked so sexy in a corset, thigh highs, platforms and oversized pearls. He makes me want to slap on a pair of pink latex gloves! He even works his curly 'fro, which is not a look easily pulled off by anyone.

Rated R for mature themes, sexuality and some language.

My only complaints are Eddie's (Meat Loaf) too-few screen minutes and Columbia's chipmunk voice--nails on a chalkboard, anyone?

Still, love it!  #DontDreamItBeIt",1475539200,,835,4.971223021582734

Both this 35th and the following 40th anniversary edition contain the authoring flaws pointed out by reviewer Danny in 2010:
1. For unknown reasons Science Fiction is LETTERBOXED ( within the 1.66 frame which the Fox logo and the rest of the film is in), cutting off the top and bottom of the lips during parts of the song. The entire film was 1.66 on the dvd so this blunder on the Blu-ray is unforgivable.
2. The blue tint from Brad's bedroom scene has been removed. The blue tint from the Timewarp flashback has also been removed.

Also, they used the wrong take of one of Janet's songs so that the 5.1 channel version is out of key but the mono version is good.",1472947200,7,702,4.392307692307693

Of course they find a huge hulking castle and try to use the phone. Rather than be your typical 90's horror flick, Brad and Janet encounter quite the strange and wondrous group of individuals from the planet of Transylvania. Trust me - it is well worth your time to watch this amazing piece of reckless careless abandon. It's enjoyable, hilarious and ridiculous.

I've always fallen asleep after the Sweet Transvestite song, which I found to be the best part of the musical. Time Warp and Dammmit Janet were two others that were also excellent. After Sweet Transvestite, I always fell asleep, but what else did a young man do back in high school back when the drive-ins were full and the bowling alleys were closed. The better movie was the Saturday Night ""The Song Remains the Same"" midnight movie.  RHPS could have been a Grease, but the second half was a snoozer. I woke up when the end of the creation speech because everybody had their noisemakers and the best part was when everybody would throw Scott toilet paper for the ""Great Scott"" line. This was almost 40 years ago, I wanted to see if I could stay up for the whole movie. It's still a snoozer, and puts me to sleep like a baby.

488205,5,6302637899,"It's hard being a parent.  All parents know this.  You have to teach your kid to think for himself, how to decide what's right or wrong, when to stay quiet and when to speak up...the list goes on.  And those are just the black and white things.  There's all kinds of ambiguity.  How do you explain the times when speaking up isn't enough, not because it isn't right, but because there aren't enough people ready to listen?

Let's address the cause and not the symptom.

The honest answer is complicated, but one of the simple parts involves popular media.  Once my kids were old enough to understand the underlying themes, we watched Rocky Horror.  Yes, because it's fun and campy, and you hum the tunes, but also because 40 years after the fact (40!  I am so old!) we have the luxury of perspective.

How did I explain to my kids that when I was little a ""transvestite"" might as well have been from transsexual Transylvania: so threatening he must be a mythical creature akin to Dracula or the bogeyman?  (How did I watch them grasp the mockery of normal people fearing someone so different they must be an alien and not hurt a little bit because they can even understand that at all?)

I didn't sit down with my kids to watch Rocky Horror so we could laugh.  (Although we did.)  I didn't watch it with them so we could sing along.  (Although we did.)  I watched it with them so I could watch them watching it.  I watched it with them because I knew they would appreciate it for all the simple reasons, and then they would realize it wasn't that simple.

Explaining satire is like explaining irony.  You know what it means, but it's hard to convey that in a way other people, especially young people, understand.  It's a lot easier to show them.  We watched this movie, and then we talked for hours about the social perspective it represented.  Understanding the place those perspectives come from is the first step in deciding whether they're valid.  It helps us decide whether they should shape our future.  Sure, I could lecture my kids about my personal feelings, but I'd prefer they develop their own beliefs.  A farcical treatment of a relevant social issue is exactly the nonthreatening format that lets a kid, or young adult really, evaluate that issue in as close as we can come to a neutral environment.  After all, this is only a movie.

Now fast forward a few years, and my kids notice Rocky Horror is available for streaming.  They come running to tell me the same way they would have thundered down the stairs years ago to tell me there's a new Green Lantern comic coming out, and I'd better preorder it so they can read it at the same time as all of their friends.

That makes me feel old, but it also feels like a victory.  In their minds ""Transsexual Transylvania"" is as remote as a comic book world.  Today both of them are advocating on the local and national level to eradicate the prejudice that made trans people seem like aliens.  I can't take credit for that.  My kids had to embrace that mindset for themselves, and Rocky Horror is one of many things that helped them do it.  The movie is campy, fun, kind of lame, full of catchy tunes, at once weird and hysterical, and totally reflective of a time gone by.  Those things together make it awesome.  Today when we watch it as a family we appreciate the humor, but we also appreciate the social commentary and the ongoing need to embrace our fellow (wo)man in all his (or her) diversity.

If you've never watched Rocky Horror, be prepared to watch it twice: once because it's a cult classic and once after you realize what it's about.  Same goes if you've watched it before: watch it again and appreciate it in all its glory.  Appreciate it even if you've only watched it every Halloween in a theater wondering why everyone else dressed up.  Watch it imagining you're dressed up...like an alien.  Watch it imagining you're so different people can only understand you as a character, not a human being.  Now imagine what it's like to be yourself, a regular person, and realize you might as well be an alien.  You don't even have to be an advocate (or supporter) of transgender people.  Imagine you need to either be laughable or ready to defend yourself because people think you're an alien monster.

That can apply to a host of things: gender issues, religion, disability and so on.  Anything one person sees as a reason to decry an individual as ""other"" is a reason for the rest of us to stop and think.  And that's the real value of this movie: it makes you stop and think.

So stop.  Think.  Enjoy.

It seemed old and campy and I didn't know any of the ""talk backs"" and audience participations and such. I still don't. Watching the DVD last night, I was amazingly entertained. Tim Curry explodes all over this production with the most outrageous, outsized, campy performance possible. He was born to play the role of Frank and he's funny as hell. The songs are goofy and catchy. This production does not take itself seriously and honestly it doesn't ask you to either. Is it cheap looking, goofy, non sensical, absurd, and often in poor taste? Absolutely. Is it about having fun with movie stereotypes while singing catchy tunes? Yes. Is it an allegory for living life to the fullest and having a good time, no matter how hard it is? That is for you to judge. There is actually a reason people like watching this movie over and over and only a small part of that has to do with drugs and alcohol. ""Rocky Horror"" says that it is okay to just have fun for an hour and a half while sitting in the dark and in these times in which we all live that still has some value.",1455840000,3,1186,4.322869955156951

Michael Rennie was ill, the day the Earth stood still, but he told us, where we stand,
And Flash Gordon was there, in silver underwear,
Claude Rains was the Invisible Man,
Then something went wrong, for Fay Wray and King Kong, they got caught in a celluloid jam,
Then at a deadly pace, it came from outer space,
And this is how the message ran:
Science fiction, double feature.

The above comes from the opening (sung by disembodied oversized female lips with a male voice) of this completely different musical comedy horror film thats a satirical tribute to science fiction and horror B movies of the 1930s through to the early 1970s.

It is based on the 1973 musical stage production, The Rocky Horror Show by Richard OBrien (who acts in this movie as the character Riff Raff).

The story centers on a young engaged couple Janet & Brad (Susan Sarandon & Barry Bostwick) whose car breaks down near a castle called the Frankenstein Place where they seek a telephone (no cell phones at this time) to call for help.  The castle is occupied by Strangers (notice the capital S) in elaborate costumes celebrating the Annual Transylvanian Convention.

They discover that the head of the castle is a Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), an apparent mad scientist who is a transvestite.  (Yes, thats right, a transvestite mad scientist.)  Dr. Furter hails from (you guessed it) Transsexual, Transylvania.  (Well, maybe you never guessed it.)

The singer Meatloaf has a small part in this movie as Eddie.

A criminologist (Charles Gray) narrates the story.

The twenty songs found in this movie are quite good and catchy.  And Susan Sarandon sings!

When this film was first released, it was largely critically panned.  But thanks to midnight movies, this movie now has a large international cult following.  (Critics might like to know that this movie has earned almost one hundred times its original budget!!)

Not surprisingly, this movie was selected for preservation on the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress on 2005.

Finally, the DVD itself (the fortieth anniversary edition released in 2015) has six extras.  One of the extras gives you a choice between the U.S. or U.K. version of this movie.  The movie on this disc has been digitally remastered meaning that there are no blemishs or artifacts.

In conclusion, if you're looking to view something completely different, this is the movie to get!!  And whats the lesson learned from this movie?  One possible lesson is:

Its not easy having a good time.

(1975;  1 hr, 35 min excluding end credits;  wide screen, 35 scenes)

488747,3,6302637899,"I don't feel entirely adequate to write this Rundown for The Rocky Horror Picture Show. I don't think its a movie thats for me. Come to think of it Im not sure who this movie is for. I know that it has legions of fervent fans, so it clearly connects with people on some level, but what I wonder is, if you're the person sitting down to write this movie, who do you envision watching it? What audience are you aiming for?

On the one hand it seems like its trying to be controversial or even offensive to uptight prudes like myself. Surely you cant make a movie in which Tim Curry in drag struts around a brightly colored set singing about how great it is to be a transvestite without trying to make some kind of statement, can you?

Except, if its aims are political or social, Rocky Horror doesnt seem particularly combative. It is not mean-spirited, or even preachy. Brad and Janet could have easily been portrayed as a couple of judgmental shrews, but instead they stand in for the audience, watching the spectacle unfolding before their eyes in slack jawed confusion and horror.

By contrast, Frank N. Furter, the transexual transvestite, is a pretty despicable guy, at least on paper. After all hes a rapist and a murderer, which would seem to preclude the possibility of this being some sort of pro-acceptance LGBT anthem.

Though as I say, hes despicable on paper. In practice hes the most interesting character in the movie. His unbridled flamboyance is utterly compelling. He is the Frozens Let it Go taken to its logical extreme.

Maybe who Rocky Horror is for is precisely not the point. Maybe all the weirdness, all the colors and songs and guns that don't matter, exist for themselves and themselves alone.

Maybe the point is that Rocky Horror doesnt care how you feel about transvestites, or musicals, or the fact that Meat Loaf just crashed through a wall on a motorcycle. Much like the character of Frank N. Furter, the movie is having fun just being itself, and even if you're put off by what its saying, you cant help but admire how its saying it.

The level of craft on display here is incredible. The colors are brilliant and bold in a way that evokes of Jodoroskys The Holy Mountain. Scenes are framed simply, but with powerful intent.

And nearly all of the songs catchy.

Add into all of that the cult following this film has garnered over the years, and youll see that The Rocky Horror Picture Show, much like its antagonist, just really wants to have fun. And just like Brad and Janice, you cant go through it without being changed.

Every vocal inflection and facial expression spoke volumes while he sang and performed. The rest of the actors and singers were excellent as well and were pretty perfectly cast. And the songs... I find myself singing them to myself for days after watching. And I mean every song. Just great music. I can see where this film would have scared the bejesus out of the average American back in the mid-70s with parents thinking their kids were going to begin dressing in teddies and having wild gay sex after watching. It's much less scary now, but the performances and music hold up so well. A true classic.",1434672000,,762,4.7368421052631575

489034,3,6302637899,"The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a film that tends to polarize its viewers. Each time after I've seen it, it's left me in the neutral camp with the view that some aspects of the film are very strong while others are very weak. Tim Curry is BRILLIANT as Dr. Frank-N-Furter, the shamelessly sensual firebrand transvestite. Calling him a diva would be an understatement. Patricia Quinn as Magenta is another scene stealer. Her portrayal of a gorgeous, vampish maidservant making good use of her slinking, cat-like movements makes her impossible to ignore. Rocky Horror creator Richard O'Brien plays his stony-faced, cadaverous manservant role to a tee as he woefully lurks about the primary setting of an old, remote castle. He often kept me wondering what evil deeds he was capable of committing. Although not exactly interesting cast picks, Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick deliver adequate acting performances portraying a timid, nave couple as they do their best to fit in to a masquerade-like subversive society. The film's visuals are strikingly impressive, colorful, and boldly showcased under flawless lighting. The makeup and costumes are expertly designed for conveying a sense of surrealism and otherworldliness necessary for making the film believable. The music is undeniably one of the film's strengths. Thumping, electric songs like ""Time Warp"" and ""Sweet Transvestite"" help to propel the movie into something powerful, interesting, and unique. Coincidentally, when new characters Rocky and Dr. Scott are introduced, that's when the movie begins losing direction. Characters are here and there, standing around without much purpose. Meat Loaf (as Eddie) slips in and out of the picture with little consequence. Up until the end it seems as if the director is just stringing the characters along, hoping to make the feature-length cut. It's campy, outlandish, and fun until the film loses focus.",1429920000,,1907,5.338870431893688

However, it has been decades since I saw it before.  The commentary was rather a disappointment. I only watched about 10 minutes of it because Patricia Quinn was monopolizing it and was talking about herself mostly. But I didn't buy it for the commentary.

Some high schoolers and college kids attended in costume, some brought props to toss in the air at certain trigger words,  and others .... wait for it ... chanted at the screen. Of course, this part of the magic is lost at home . . . unless you have a Rocky Horror party. And with today's big screen TVs, the drama is not lost at home.

I use to go see this one when I was a kid at the midnight movies and watch the audience perform all the lines. So much fun.

489245,5,6302637899,"I actually saw the stage musical last October and fell in love when it was over.  It made me want to see the movie and I got my wish when Logo aired it Halloween.

This is one of the best musicals I've seen.  The settings are awesome the costumes are cool and humorous, the musical numbers are numerous and great.  And Frank 'N' further is one of the best characters ever created.

Now despite the name Rocky Horror, this isn't actually much of a horror film.  It's actually called this because of the character Rocky Horror, Frank's creation.  However this does not change my mind about the movie because it's just so fun to watch.

This DVD contains three versions of the movie.  One for the U.S. version and the U.K. version.  However, the third is accessible by an Easter Egg (I won't tell you how to access) that has the movie start out in black and white until Brad and Janette meet the Transexuals.  This version is very similar to Wizard of Oz when it only reaches color when Dorothy gets to Oz.",1419206400,,1003,4.396739130434782

489914,5,6302637899,"The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) is a quirky, yet fun film that continues to defy logic almost 40 years after its debut. Primarily known as a midnight movie, it has nevertheless gained a cult following of immense proportions. What makes Rocky Horror so likable? As I alluded to, it's quirky; it's a film that depicts horror, comedy, and has lighthearted musical numbers to accent its strange plot. Add all of this up, and what you get is a film that's just plain fun to watch. This film is anything but dark or scary, just to clarify. If you like unusual characters doing very unusual things, then Rocky Horror is for you. The special features have a commentary, as well as a neat theatrical experience that shows audience reactions. Also, there's a prompter within the subtitles that signals various commands during audience participation. I really enjoyed this flick; it's unlike anything seen before or since its inception.",1413158400,2,930,4.929936305732484

490039,5,6302637899,"I was determined to obtain an upgrade from my old VHS 25th anniversary release. More for the original mono mix soundtrack than anything. The mono soundtrack seems to be included on all releases since, but since I don't plan to get a Blu-ray player anytime soon, if at all, this was the best and most deluxe option. The packaging is beautiful, with a high gloss surface and includes movie quotes and high quality photos on every surface. The picture quality is perfect for a DVD of this age. It was cleaned up well in the remastering. Nice crisp picture and bright colors. I'm grateful that it's presented in its original aspect ratio; no chopping off of the top and bottom or sides. I'm a firm believer in keeping films and music as original as possible (no stretched and distorted aspect ratios displayed on widescreen TVs for me).

Which brings me to the mono mix soundtrack (accessed in the Language Selection option on the main menu). I'd been hearing bits and pieces of it in clips on the internet and I was intrigued. I always seek out original mono mixes of some of my favorite music, especially from the 1960's as 45 rpm singles. So, this was no different for me. If there was any way for me to obtain an old film print and a movie projector, I would have gone that unfeasible route. Viewing and listening to this film with its original mono mix is a whole different experience. More of the subtle sound effects and atmosphere seem to be more prominent than in the stereo mix. The more prominent echo of Frank's vocals at the beginning of Sweet Transvestite feels more...correct...because after all, they are in a big, old echoey vestibule by the stairs projecting towards the ballroom. Riff's vocal being the most prominent during the chorus of Time Warp is more quirky (and original!) than the overproduced stereo mix which has the vocal removed almost completely. The bass guitar in Time Warp and especially during Columbia's solo just punches you in the face. Again, it's gone in the stereo mix, or moved so far to the background that it's barely there. You can even pick up on other characters' individual vocals (Magenta, Columbia, etc.) throughout these and other songs that just don't seem to be there in the stereo mix. The mono mix just has a more punchier sound to it, as does most music that was originally intended as a mono mix. It's also a lot nicer to your 2-channel stereo speakers or TV speakers because the dialog and music are at a more even/equal volume as opposed to the stereo mix where much of the dialog and vocals are pushed to the background. Not much playing with the volume control is required compared to the stereo mix which can sound like your speakers will explode when the music kicks in. Not that I would give up on the ""cleaner"" stereo mix completely. It's very much a part of the history of the film being that it was how it was first released in an audio only format, and I'm all for keeping history intact. The mono soundtrack is just a new/old way for a lot of us to enjoy it if we're not old enough to have been around for its theatrical heyday, and for the ones who were there to experience it as they remember. I learned that it was a touchy subject among some ""purists"" during my internet research of the different mixes, which I guess I'm one of those purists. So, a big ""thank you"" to the big guys in charge for making the original mono mix soundtrack a permanent option now.

The two discs are crammed with extras, enough to have kept me glued to the screen for days in any spare time I've had since I've received it. The commentary with Richard O'Brien and Patricia Quinn is fun and informative. Includes other options for enjoying the movie in new(er) ways (prompter for audience participation, ""The Theatrical Experience"" for viewing as you would in a theater, complete with audience participation and performers in front of the screen), a documentary, deleted scenes, long and enjoyable interviews of cast members, etc., etc. Just too much! Just enough!

Unfortunately, the DVD-Rom extras for computers, which are supposedly games, trivia and more, don't seem to be compatible with Windows 7 and even XP. Either they're both just too new to run it (""requires Windows 95 or higher""), or my XP's DVD drive is failing. I just couldn't get it to run at all on the XP machine when other DVDs did work when testing it. The program did install to Windows 7 but only loaded to a blank screen. Though I was able to get deep into the files and retrieve the oh-so-90's, crude and fun screensaver. It's an image of Dr. Frank N Furter's castle with lightning bolts and flashes in the background and alternating movie quotes appearing on the screen.

Other than that one minor drawback, the 25th Anniversary release is an awesome little package, worth owning for anyone not planning or not ready to upgrade to a Blu-ray player. Highly recommended.",1409875200,,4892,4.626006904487917

The BluRay is PACKED with awesome features, including commentary, alternate cuts, and, get this, a Picture-in-Picture shadowcast. For those of you new to Rocky Horror (or similar midnight movies) a shadowcast recreates the sets, props, and costumes of a film and performs the film live as it plays (NO, they do NOT look at the screen). It's insane, hilarious, and endlessly entertaining. Or, so it seems, as they've been going on around the world for 39 years and counting. The BluRay even includes two documentaries: one about shadowcasting and the other about the process of selecting the cast for the Picture-in-Picture. An absolute MUST-HAVE for any movie or alt-cuture fan!!",1407715200,,758,5.170731707317073

I won't review the movie itself because obviously I LOVE IT AND ITS AWESOME. But it is very weird so I understand that with some people it's going to be a hit or miss.

Really, this sort of thing does not work watching it on a television screen.  Maybe in a movie theater, or on a stage, but it's all flash and glam and noise, and it lacks the amusement or wit of ""Little Shop Of Horrors"".  Here, we're supposed to view all the weird people and their weird behavior and be wowed by it.

490566,4,6302637899,"""I DIDN'T MAKE HIM FOR YOU!""

If someone were to argue that RHPS (Rocky Horror Picture Show) is about sex, I'd have to disagree.  While that is one of the crisis elements of the plot, I think Frankie spells it out in his 'Sweet Transvestite' song,  he says, ""don't judge a book by it's cover.""  And this guy who can make a man for you, is also THE minister at the wedding in the opening scene.  His servants are there too, in American Gothic regalia.

It's really supposed to mess with your head, his alien agent status combined with his obsession with human eroticism and religious cultural icons.  (Zen Buddhism, Satan in physics,  recreational drugs).  Because RHPS is derived from a musical, the songs are literally spelling out the story as it progresses.  If I've got any favorite songs in this spectacle, there's one with Richard O'Brien and Susan Sarandon singing solos, ""Over at the Frankenstein Place"" (There's a Light).  Also the ""Floor Show"", where Frankie uses mind control to set the performers singing as automatons.

Tim Curry makes the antagonist of RHPS come to life on the silver screen.  Great voice, sensuous of gaze, inappropriate gestures into everyone's personal space, and totally narcissistic.  He's everything your mother or father hated the thought of you ever meeting in a shadowy grove.  And ultimately, he's a dead-ender.

My parents didn't raise me to perpetually be 'in heat'.  But they weren't the only ones to warn me that whatever a relationship may be at face value, there's always the real person at home, locked up in someone else's castle, you never really see them until you live with them.",1392768000,,1631,4.830324909747293

So this was the next best option. Honestly the movie version I think is over hyped. I mean it's good, don't get me wrong, but it's a bit over hyped. However it won't stop me from watching it on Halloween nights and such.

Got this at a steal too for $13. So it wasn't all bad",1390608000,,565,4.0

490652,5,6302637899,"It's astounding, time is fleeting
Madness takes its toll
But listen closely, not for very much longer
I've got to keep control

I remember doing the Time Warp
Drinking those moments when
The blackness would hit me and the void would be calling
Let's do the time warp again...
Let's do the time warp again!

It's just a jump to the left
And then a step to the right
With your hands on your hips
You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane,
Let's do the Time Warp again!

It's so dreamy, oh fantasy free me
So you can't see me, no not at all
In another dimension, with voyeuristic intention
Well-secluded, I see all
With a bit of a mind flip
You're there in the time slip
And nothing can ever be the same
You're spaced out on sensation, like you're under sedation
Let's do the Time Warp again!

Well I was walking down the street just a-having a think
When a snake of a guy gave me an evil wink
He shook me up, he took me by surprise
He had a pickup truck and the devil's eyes.
He stared at me and I felt a change
Time meant nothing, never would again
Let's do the Time Warp again!",1389744000,,1122,4.109589041095891
490653,5,6302637899,"I first saw this movie back in 1978, in a couple of different really crappy little independent theaters with crappy sound systems. When my son grew up, I took him to where it was showing locally, in another crappy-sounding independent theater. I don't know if the movie prints have ever been remastered, but it looked and sounded exactly the same way as it did in the 70's.

So when I popped this into my bluray & home theater system, I was hearing background noise I'd never heard before! I was all ""wait, that wasn't in it originally...""; but it was. I just could never tell.

The movie was filmed before there was 'high def' or anything, but I love the look of it! I haven't checked out the commentary or anything yet, but I plan to.

Tim Curry is hilarious in his iconic gender bending, pansexual role as Dr Frankenfurter (think bugs bunny in drag for adults).  There is a reason this movie is played still as a midnight feature (especially around Halloween).  It has withstood the test of time and done the Time warp once again!  The only negative thing I have to say is that I was misled by this movie,  I did NOT SEE androids fighting Brad and Janet! >: / I mean COME ON  I was waiting for that! I mean how awesome would that be!  But NOOO they didn't have that scene in the entire movie!  _

With Susan Sarandon, Tim Curry, and Barry Bostwick, it combines great acting with a delightful musical score (""Time Warp"" and ""Dammit, Janet"" among other songs.)  Definitely not for the kiddies, but a great Saturday movie night choice!  I originally saw this in the theatre on my college campus, and I love being able to relive that fun in my own home!

It's rare to see a Bluray Book aside from the ones released by Warner, and this is a good example on why Fox may not release more movies in this format. Even when the photos in the book are great, the fact that the disc must be slide into the book is really a shame, and also the lack of extra liner notes or essays on it.",1386288000,,356,3.824324324324324

The Blu-ray version cannot fix all the technical limitations from the original film, but at least now you CAN see all those limitations in high definition!

But that would overlook the brilliance of the songwriting; both the musical cues that satirize Hollywood and Broadway simultaneously as well as the very witty lyrics and catchy melodies. It would also undermine the truly great acting that's going on. We're not only introduced to the genius that is Tim Curry but the equally great comedic turns by Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick, not to mention the over-the-top Meatloaf. O'Brien had lightning in a bottle with this one and to just think of this film in terms of what costume one should wear while watching it, or when to squirt your water gun, would miss the point: this film is a cultural milestone that delivers in all the areas in which a great film should.",1383091200,,861,4.633986928104576

491035,5,6302637899,"The original, perhaps best, Midnight Movie, presented in DTS 7.1. There are options that stagger like a black and white intro (more like 16 minute) that perfectly fits the intro song (most of the films it references were black and white- except Forbidden Planet with Anne Francis-long before she was Honey West). There's the British  version that has ""Heroes"". There's, to me, a really useless little book the blu ray comes pacjked in- but it IS cute I guess.
The movie is FUN-a Susan Sarandon you can accept as virginal. A Tim Curry who MUST be an alien. Richard O'Brien who created it in a great role (sneering Time Warp beautifully)....and more, much more.
Hard to believe that it made little money before finding the Midnight circuit.

I'll talk about the extras and discs instead. There are actually two versions of this edition--one is printed in Canada, and the other in the USA. The Canadian version has a very different disc design. It's in solid black with red ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" as well as a photo of Frank N Furter. The Canadian printing is weak and the colors of the digipack case is sort of fade-ish? The American version, however, has fantastic printing/coloring. For some reason, the cardboard paper and ink used for the case is better. The color is more vibrant. The discs also have a different design--tracing the outline of the digipack case's design!

I actually ordered this in 2010, and I accidentally ordered this again just last week (2013). I had the American version first, and the one that I accidentally ordered says ""made in Canada."" I opened it just to see if it's any different, and it bloody is.

Looking back to 1975, it's still fun to see just how heart-stoppingly beautiful the young Susan Sarandon was.  My teenage libido was seriously inflamed by ""Touch-a / touch-a / touch-a / touch me...""  Although many of the actors in this film later regretted their roles because the movie type-cast them for any later work, I contend that it's better to have acted in one masterpiece than in 20 mediocre movies.

The movie is hotly criticized for being campy, twee, and far too long. Whatever sexual gospel the movie is trying to preach also confuses or offends many viewers.  Despite the justice of the criticisms, the movie prevails with its wonderful soundtrack and over-the-top characters. If you've never seen it (What, you're a VIRGIN??!!), then not to be missed.

491965,3,6302637899,"I've been aware of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" since about 1980. I remember the date because that's when I got into running and the friend that introduced me was a RHPS fan. He'd go to one of the local art theaters every weekend and take in one or two of the midnight showings. He said the people (in the theater) wore costumes and participated in the lines of the movie and sang along with the songs. He said it was a blast. Ummm, it just didn't sound all that interesting to me, but I once went by the theater as people were waiting to get in and there was a rather hugh crowd of rather strange-looking people standing around. I was amazed. The local paper commented about it and said it had probably saved this particular art theater from closing down. And this thing ran for years. Well, beyond that point in about 2003, I had an internet lady friend who went by the user name of Janet Dammit and she explained that the name was from a character in the RHPS. Nice lady, I might add. A bit strange, but what the hey? After a while, Janet Dammit revealed to me that she was really Chan Marshall (Cat Power), and she was! Now that was really strange! I ended up buying and reviewing a few of her albums and liked them very much.

Alas, what next? Well, I'd pretty much forgotten most of this until I was browsing the Wal-Mart five-dollar DVD rack and a copy of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" was sitting there. Out of curiosity, I bought it. I watched it last night. The movie was proceeding along with a wedding of a really straight couple and then they left through an increasingly intense rain storm. Finally, they got stalled and a tire blew out and there was no spare. They were forced to walk back a couple miles in the rain to a castle they had passed by to search for a phone. Well, they got to the castle and a really creepy fellow answered the door. Finally, they were let in. Okay, from that point, the movie made little sense with me. It was a parade of some of the stranger characters I can remember seeing on the screen and it was all set to some rather good music. I guess you'd say it was a musical, but it was the most bizarre musical I can ever remember seeing, it made no sense at all and then it ended in a very strange way. I guess I'd just have to watch it all over, maybe several times, to try and comprehend.

Well, one of the ways to gain some understanding would be to go to the bonus features. You guessed it, they didn't work. None of them. I tried over and over. It must have been a defective disc, and I not a lot of other reviewers have had similar problems. Well, I'm left to rate a somewhat enjoyable but very strange movie. I'll be trying again at some later date.

Gary Peterson",1342828800,,2719,4.225
491966,4,6302637899,"First time I saw it was in 1981, at a small theater; I had managed to talk a visiting friend(s) to go with me.  The theater had some folks dressed up as ""The Dream Police"" (talk about a flashback!) who were actually policing the line of Rocky Horror fans.  Great kitschy movie, I have to say.  I just recently found it at Walmart for $5.00.  The extras are great, but if I have to quibble - the DVD-ROM portion does not work.  Okay, so pick at me because I like downloading screensavers and playing the silly games. The DVD-ROM portion wanted me to download/install something called ""PCFriendly.""  Well, it doesn't work and any of the players to download to even attempt to get it to work are major trouble (FYI - stay away from those!).  I just want the DVD-ROM features!  Perhaps I am not computer savvy enough - sigh.

That said, the hints on when to ""interact"" are great.  As for the footage of the fans, it seems hit or miss.  Some is great; some looks like just some random goof in the audience filming on his camcorder; but, I suppose if one wants to imagine what it would be like being in the audience, one could give it a pass.

If one just wants to watch the movie and have hints when to interact? It's great! If you want an evening of silliness and can enjoy the whole kitschiness of it all, get your popcorn, newspaper, squirt guns, etc, and have a blast!",1342656000,,1367,4.317647058823529

There could be more but those are the two that stuck out like sore thumbs to me.  Someone apparently decided that this new master made from the original negatives would be better off somehow with different takes of songs, but I'm failing to see the logic here.  Since the most popular reviews fail to mention this major flaw, maybe I'm the weird one for thinking that any tampering of a soundtrack that arguably defines an entire movie is a very, very bad idea.  This release could have had five stars easily.",1341792000,,710,4.5234375
492009,5,6302637899,"The MOVIE gets 5 stars, the DVD gets 2.

The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a movie that passes from generation to generation. There is an undoubtable power within the film that manages to keep drawing in viewers almost 40 years after its initial releasewhich technically has not ended. For me, Rocky Horror is not just ""another great movie"", but a way of life. It has been a way of life ever since I first saw it 5 years ago when I was 14. I also have the lips seen on some of the posters tattooed on my chest.

The plot is a parody of science fiction and horror movies of the 1950's. Brad and Janet are a newly engaged couple who become stranded after a tire blowout on a road trip to visit their ex-tutor, Dr. Scott. They walk a few miles down the road to a castle they had previously seen to use a phone (true fans of RHPS know castles don't have phones) to call for help. They are denied the use of a phone, but they have arrived on a rather special night. It is an hour and 40 minutes of pure decadence and rock n' roll music. Yes, this is not only a comedy-horror parody, but a MUSICAL. I don't even like musicals!!!

The Rocky Horror Picture Show has a strong LGBT following for many reasons. However, I feel that RHPS has something to offer for every kind of person. I see Rocky Horror screenings as gatherings for people who are misunderstood, a chance for them to go wild and just have a good time. I've gone to see it many times in the theater (many more to come) with many different people, and portrayed Rocky in shadow casts. For the record, ""shadow casts"" are a group of performers who act out the movie in front of the screen when it is being shown for a crowd. It is pretty much a huge party in a movie theater. Check online for Rocky Horror screenings in your area! They are still there, you just need to find them!

Overall, The Rocky Horror Picture Show is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, but it's sad how the DVD has no good special features. I highly recommend that every single person watch RHPS at least once in his/her life.",1338508800,,2061,4.223350253807107

The picture has been fully restored from the original camera negatives and the film appears amazingly crisp and sharp.  Any other version you own needs to be replaced by this.  The video really is a revelation.  From beginning to end the colors are bright and true, flesh tones are very realistic, black/white ratios are superb and the clarity is amazingly crisp.  How they got the film to look this good is miraculous.  Every classic scene will be as if seeing it for the first time for it is so vivid you will notice everything in each picture frame.  At times it is as if the characters are jumping out the screen.  And the audio is even better.  It has been enhanced to DTS-HD 7.1.  The film was originally done in mono and you must get used to the difference in levels with dialogue and the music.  The dialogue can still sound a little canny due to its original source but the music comes to life gloriously.  The music as well as the vocals bounce from all the speakers making magic.  And this film is about the music.  Each amazing track comes to new life.  You will quickly adjust to the dialogue being at a slightly different level and then see THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW as never before.

If you are a fan, this purchase is a must.  It has the US and UK versions, comes in a glorious digibook with pages and pages of color pictures and also has extras galore from the famed live experience to deleted musical scenes and outtakes.  Many think this film is only truly magical when viewed with the midnight live audience participation but that is not true.  With the quality presentation it has here it can be enjoyed alone or with friends.  This is truly a magical gift to fans of this cult classic.  And if this film is new to you and you love high class campy fun this is for you.  Take a look at the hot pics of Tim Curry.  If that entices you, then you will love this film.  Highly recommend.

Another detail really nice to be mentioned is the fact that this Blu-ray, one of those all-in-one BD-books with photos and a lot of extras, has also Portuguese subtitles I usually don't see when I import something to my country - Brazil. And have you ever noticed how haired is Rocky's chest and body? I haven't until this accurately and highly contrasted edition. We are now honored to finally be able to see both UK and US versions. There's only one thing that makes me sad while I play this BD edition and it's the unhappy situation of my not being part of any cast, or shadow cast, for that matter. As Sal Piro welcomes you in a little inviting card, that comes separately in the first pages of the book, if you haven't seen theater exhibition - with shadow cast, screen talkers and flying food - you're still a virgin. So, I'm still virgin, but one who is constantly introducing the Rocky Horror spirit into other's life. However, let me say I'm still working on a theater RHPS project...

It definitely does help that it stars Tim Curry, who I admire for his extensive repertoire with acting and voice acting (in videogames no less!!). Anyways, for the movie itself, I believe that a MAJOR factor into liking a musical is if the music is in your taste and the actors can actually sing, and Rocky Horror delivers. And this being he Blu-Ray rendition, it only improves on the audio quality, the intro song just sounded awesome as is the rest of the film.

The extras are definitely worth checking into, including bloopers and other bits that help immerse one into the cult that is rocky horror.

IN SHORT: if you've owned other copies of this film, it's worth dipping in again for Blu. For those who have never liked musicals, I still say give this a shot, if you can rent it or ask a friend to borrow their copy, do it. OVERALL GREAT PURCHASE!",1316476800,,971,4.418994413407821
492176,4,6302637899,"I'm speaking as somebody from the outside. I have seen the movie in theaters. I have even attended a couple midnight showings. However there is a difference between a casual observer and long term participant, so I am speaking to all of you who aren't the ""freaks"" or ""misfits"" (badges of honor for those in the know) who have intimate knowledge of this film. The Rocky Horror Picture Show is probably the most notorious cult movie in existence. Not because of overtly controversial content or the film being connected to some kind of scandal. It's this way because this quirky movie hit a soft spot for a whole cultural set of people all over the world. The movie is hard to categorize, but in it's pure form it is a musical (such as it's based on the musical of the same name). It's a crazy horror/comedy/sci-fi/50's tribute kind of musical. But a musical nonetheless.

The movie (and original musical) was the brainchild of Richard O'Brien, who set out to make a parody of the B-Movies of the 40's and 50's. What the end result was the craziest of mismatches. You have elements of the mad scientist and his creation along with aliens from another planet all mixed in with bizarre love triangles and unexpected tangents no other cult movie has pulled off since. You want it in one word? Wacky. Two words? Perverted wacky. Not in a softcore adult film kind of way, but in a lets-poke-fun-at-as-many-sexual-taboos-as-you-can sort of way. Aliens from the planet Transexual? Transvestite mad doctor who creates a boy toy while seducing a straight couple? Incest (alien incest at that)? Cannibalism? Sounds like a horrible movie, but all of this... ALL of it... is done tongue in cheek and often times in song and dance.

The script and acting all delve into the melodrama of the very movies Rocky Horror parodies. The writing makes the perverted wackiness vehicles for either quick B-movie styled shocks or peppy rock and roll musical numbers. It helps having a stellar cast. Tim Curry cut his teeth doing the musical version of this movie on stage, and got a name for himself as the absolutely over-the-top Dr. Frank-N-Furter. Meatloaf lends his charismatic singing chops as Eddie in a motorcycle riding musical number. Rising stars Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick both play the straight roles with much intended camp. Even creator Richard O'Brien serves a supporting role as the creepy Riff Raff. You can tell the whole cast was having a blast making this film.

As a musical the songs are just as much important as the script. As this is a tribute to the 40's and 50's era drive-in type film the music is very much rockabilly and Grease-style songs. You get some high energy songs running the gamut of emotion and even absurdity. You also get some more musical-type songs as well. All the while you get lyrics that are peppered with references to various 40's and 50's movies that move like a love letter to the era. Then they throw in a song like Sweet Transvestite and you're back in the crazy fray. As a movie from the 70's mocking movies from yesteryear the incidental things like special effects are intentionally cheesy. The sets, however, scream atmosphere in both the elaborate settings and the more simple ones.

This Blu-Ray release marks the 35th anniversary of the movie's release and as such makes the best send off to date. Visually it won't get any better with this disk sporting an almost pristine transfer from the original film negatives. There almost zero compression on this transfer. Audio is an even better treat with DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 surround. Even though the movie was originally done in mono they really do a bang up job with the surround. Just wait until you hear the musical numbers on this disk (in surround sound). It will blow your mind.

There is also a very nice array of extras, including the stuff from previous DVD releases. One of the sweeter features is you get both the U.S. and U.K. versions of the film (that means the Superhero ending is available). Here is the breakdown of the bonus content (in 1080p unless noted):

- Commentary by Richard O'Brien and Patricia Quinn

- The Midnight Experience: This needs a bit of explanation. There are a series of options you can tag to the film that gives trivia pop ups, vintage call back track (what you scream back at the film during the midnight showings), Picture-in-Picture view of midnight showing shadowcast members acting out with the film, even something they call a Prop Box for throwing virtual items on the screen.

-  The Search for the 35th Anniversary Shadowcast: You that part of the Midnight Experience with the shadowcast playing out the movie? Well here is an hour long documentary on getting that cast together. Apparently they went all over the world looking for the right people.

- Rocky-Oke: Sing It!: It's Rocky Horror karaoke. You get a lyric sheet to sing along with the scores of musical numbers in the movie. You can even take out the original singing and have essentially an instrument track much like your standard karaoke.

- Alternate Black and White opening scene

- Mick Rock (A Photographer): A quick documentary on the on location photographer. This feature is in 1080i.

- Mick Rock's Picture Show: A photo gallery of Mick Rock's work.

All the previously released features are in a section called A Few From the Vault. Included in the vault is a high definition pressbook that allows you to read all the material along with a poster gallery. The rest are all still in standard definition. Here's what you get:

- Rocky Horror Double Feature Video Show: A retrospective running a little over a half hour.

- Two deleted musical scenes

- Alternate outtakes: 11 of them to be exact.

- Alternate end credits

- Beacon Theater 10th Anniversary: Footage from a crazy midnight showing.

- Theatrical Trailers

Really the only way to experience The Rocky Horror Picture Show was to see it during it's heyday on one of the many midnight showings. Then again you may not have caught all the subtle nuances of the movie what with all the raucous going on. If that's the case then this Blu-Ray is the next best thing with amazing sound and visuals and a slew of good features. I have to admit this movie is an acquired taste and you have to be able to see it for the parody it is to appreciate it. If you are, or could be, a fan of camp then get ready for the most outrageous camp that ever came out of the 70's.

492210,5,6302637899,"Based on a stage play, THE ROCKY HORROR SHOW, still occasionally revived in London and New York, THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW now holds the all-time record for theatrical release---35 years! A flop in general release, ROCKY was saved by a bunch of intrepid New Yorkers who convinced the Waverly Theater, of blessed memory, to run it as ""the midnight double feature picture show"" in 1977.

Not long after ROCKY was rescued, it became an audience participation film. How, why or when is lost to me, but audiences were soon shouting scat dialogue back at the screen, as in:

""I really admire the way you beat the other girls---""

AUDIENCE: ---With a whip!---

""---to the bride's bouquet.""

Scenes became cues for audience actions. A rainstorm onscreen led to the firing of water guns. A mention of prunes meant that the eponymous fruit was thrown at the screen; and so on.

The Waverly was a mess afterward, but the cleanup was worth the gate receipts.

Other area theaters, mostly grindhouses, soon picked up on this practice, and kept themselves in clover showing ROCKY at midnight along with such forgotten classics as PELVIS and THE CARS THAT EAT PEOPLE, or occasionally, on a holiday weekend, THE GRATEFUL DEAD MOVIE. That was a classic double bill!

Eventually, this phenomenon spread across the country and now overseas.

I can remember being seventeen and standing night after night, hands in pockets and breath fogging the frigid air, in line with hundreds of other dedicated nutcases waiting for the Mini-Cinema in Uniondale, New York to open its doors for the midnight show during the freezing winter of 1977-1978 just so we could see this unique and bizarre film for three bucks a viewing. (A friend just wrote to tell me that the Mini-Cinema is now a church. Oh, the grand irony of it!)

Bottles of cheap wine and rotgut and other oddities were passed freely up and down the line along with various smoking mixtures that were imbibed, ingested and inhaled as need be, partly to get in the mood and partly, simply, to keep warm as the temperature thudded down to around zero. Sometimes it snowed. It sleeted. Who cared? We were engaging in a tribal rite.

Occasionally, someone overdid it and barfed prodigiously, to the disgust and amusement of the rest of us.

My first ROCKY (aka ""losing my virginity"") occurred the same night as April's 100th viewing, and so the audience of regulars was in full war cry, dressed (or downdressed) to the nines. Having been brought along by a friend who had not forewarned me, I soon found myself in a heaving mass of humanity, men dressed as women, women dressed as men, and a few souls, God knows what, dressed as God knows what. The regulars would burst into song, and occasionally, the line contracted obscenely upon itself. ""What is it?"" I yelped.

""It's the pelvic thrust..."" somebody, dressed as a DuMont television set, told me.

""That really drives you insane..."" a fright-wigged boy wearing cat's-eye sunglasses added.

""Let's do The Time Warp Again!"" everybody shrieked.

My friend said, ""You'll get it.""

And get it I did as I became a ROCKY regular, topping out at (thus far) 129 viewings. At age 50, I'm still keeping count. Not as many as many, and I never dressed the part, but it was worth the cold nights and the occasional overindulgences. That was the winter I got pneumonia. Of course, I also weighed 135 pounds soaking wet.

I caught ROCKY on Syfy at Halloween, and enjoyed reminiscing, as they ran it fourteen times in twenty four hours (I watched it twice or maybe thrice that day). Something seemed to be missing, but I didn't know what. But the other day, an old ROCKY fanatic invited me over. We watched the ""UK Version"" and everything fell into place. Since my friend and I both now write for movies, TV and publication, we got into a discussion about THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW that has led me to this review.

After 35 years and a remake on TV's  GLEE, ROCKY isn't outre anymore or particularly shocking. But Rocky is definitely an acquired taste. The film is popular among young middle-class white kids primarily, because it allows them to vicariously experience a wildly nontraditional lifestyle. ROCKY is replete with transsexualism, transvestitism, pansexuality, bisexuality, homoeroticism, heteroeroticism, and almost every other form of sexual expression, almost perfectly geared for adolescents who are first discovering their primary gender and sexual identities.

Leavening all this mix-and-match sexuality, ROCKY is framed in an amusing pastiche of genres: It heavily draws on James Whale's classic FRANKENSTEIN. It references memorable low-budget 1950s Drive-In Sci-Fi favorites like TARANTULA and DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS as well as classic Sci-Fi such as FORBIDDEN PLANET and KING KONG. It throws in an homage to Rock 'n' Roll, layering it with Burlesque Theater and Busby Berkeley's carefully choreographed water ballet musicals.

ROCKY's own odd songs (including its signature song, ""The Time Warp"") run the gamut from the amusing (""Dammit, Janet"") to the frankly sexual (""Toucha-Toucha-Toucha-Touch Me"")  to the frenetic (""Hot Patootie! Bless My Soul"") to the moving {""I'm Going Home"") to the truly dark (""Superheroes"").

Almost everything in ROCKY is done to a fine turn and to excess: Crotch-grinding seduction is punctuated with a murderous ice hammer attack, and a formal dinner, singularly ""lacking in bonhomie"" is revealed to be a cannibal feast.

Despite a dire introduction by a noted Criminologist (Charles Gray), ROCKY starts out brightly enough. Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (or, to the audience, ""Vice!"") (Susan Sarandon) have just gotten engaged and are off to share the good news with their friend, Dr. Everett Scott (Jonathan Adams). On the way to Dr. Scott's home they get a flat tire, and are forced to take shelter in a nearby castle, where they are greeted by Riff Raff the butler (Richard O'Brien) and Magenta the Maid (Patricia Quinn), who take their wet things (leaving them standing uncomfortably in their underwear).

They are shocked when a roomful of weirdly dressed people begin doing ""The Time Warp.""

At that moment, they are introduced to the flamboyantly cross-dressing master of the house, Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry) who explains to them in lascivious song that he's ""a sweet transvestite from Transsexual Transylvania."" After inviting them, ""up to the lab to see what's on the slab,"" he explains that he has just created a muscular male love slave, Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood), whom he then animates, and takes off to a specially prepared ""bridal suite.""

Rocky is not Frank-N-Furter's only conquest that night. Despite their clean-cut rather uptight ways, both Brad and Janet fall easy prey to Frank's sexual blandishments. As the evening progresses, we discover that the good doctor is a complete hedonist, dedicated to giving himself ""over to absolute pleasure."" His seductions include the rock `n' roll biker Eddie (Meat Loaf), Columbia, a house servant (Little Nell Campbell), and others. And although he is just entertaining himself with Brad and Janet, both of whose virginity amuses him, things take a much darker turn when Dr. Scott arrives at the castle looking for his nephew, the missing Eddie. Dr. Scott (aka Dr. Von Scott) is revealed as a former Nazi scientist working for ""our side,"" who knows the truth about Frank-N-Furter's origins on the PLANET Transsexual in the GALAXY of Transylvania. But even Dr. Scott surrenders to his own fleshly impulses. And so it is left to Riff Raff and Magenta (who are revealed to be Frank-N-Furter's alien companions) to stage a coup---""Your lifestyle's too extreme!""---and return to their home planet, leaving the Earthlings dazed and irredeemably corrupted.

Despite its seeming idolatry to excess, there is logic to the movie. ROCKY is a cautionary tale. It is instructive that the only two people not destroyed (physically or spiritually) by Frank-N-Furter are Riff Raff and Magenta, who, though they have served him, have never been seduced by him. And it is also important to note that despite everyone's protestations of innocence, not one human being seduced by Frank-N-Furter was forced into anything. They have all been willing participants in their own undoing, even though like Brad and Rocky Horror himself, they may be completely unequal to accepting that responsibility. Like addicts, they have numerous opportunities to reject what they are being offered and to turn from the path of ruin that lies before them, but not one of them does.

This lesson is driven home in the show's final song, ""Superheroes,"" though many younger American ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW fans may have missed this song, as it appears only in the ""UK Version."" Some years ago, ""Superheroes"" was cut from the ""US Version"" as being ""too depressing."" I remembered it from my early viewings and missed it without knowing what I was missing. Its exclusion is an unfortunate mistake, even if most of the film's younger audience overlooks the point:

I've done a lot; God knows I've tried to find the truth. I've even lied.
But all I know is down inside I'm bleeding...
And super heroes come to feast, to taste the flesh not yet deceased.
And all I know ... is still the beast is feeding...
And crawling on the planet's face, some insects called the human race...
Lost in time and lost in space
And meaning.

For a film that ""failed"" ROCKY's cast is singularly impressive. The well-known Susan Sarandon is cast opposite Barry Bostwick and Tim Curry, both veterans of many movie and stage roles. Richard O'Brien, the show's creator, still works in the London theatre, and Patricia Quinn, Lady Stephens, is a well-respected Barrister. Both Jonathan Adams and Charles Gray had long acting careers prior to their deaths. Peter Hinwood now deals in antiques, while Little Nell Campbell teaches music and dance. Meat Loaf is still a musical celebrity.

The many DVD extras give us disturbing confirmation that ROCKY has become institutionalized. A ""Rocky-oke"" sing along segment and a ""cued"" version of the film (""Now throw playing cards"") indicate that the spontaneity that created this one-of-a-kind audience participation experience has been ossified by the studio into regimentation. I would much rather my ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW inheritors discover this film the way it is meant to be discovered, in company with their peers. And I promise to laugh if someone yells, ""Cerebral Palsy!"" at Brad when he asks, ""What's come over me?"" That was my own line, shouted for reasons known only to myself and anyone who has seen me walk.

Here's more to make you shiver with an-tic-i-pation: two new musical numbers!!! ""Once In A While"" and ""Superheroes.""  Neither seen theatrically or available on home video.

It all begins when rain-soaked Brad and Janet take refuge in the castle of Dr. Frank-N-Furter just as he's about to unveil his greatest creation!  But he's open to having a bit of fun with his unexpected and very reluctant guests.

What more can possibly be said than press release retro lingo?  ""So snap your garter belt and pop into the lab.  See what's on the slab!  Oh, it's The Rocky Horror Picture Show Special Edition! It's all here in this twisted salute to sci-fi, horror, B-movies and rock music, all rolled into one deliciously decadent delight.""

The party includes Tim (the sweet transvestite from Transilvania), Barry, Susan and Meat (as in Loaf).  Is this the most popular cult classic of all time?

492353,5,6302637899,"I'm not reviewing the Rocky Horror Picture Show itself, as that's been done many times. I'd like to review what makes the 35th anniversary blu-ray edition of RHPS so great, and that is all the extras. Especially great are the options for:
1. Trivia pop-up
2. The words to scream back at the screen - very useful for virgins who haven't attended a showing yet, and nostalgic for the old-timers, even if the words might not match what you know. They are an amalgamation of the most common phrases, so for example, while we used to say ""What do you do with Smurfs?"" apparently the common phrase was ""How do you kill cockroaches?"" Also, they never use the phrase ""Castles don't have phones!"" which was surprising to me. Be warned that the language is the same as used in the theatres, which means rated R+ :)
3. The shadow cast actors are very good! Especially the girl who plays Janet, she was amazing. Brad and Magenta were the next best to Janet. The guy who plays Riff Raff has more ""freedom of expression"" than I'm used to, though.
4. The option to ""throw"" stuff at the screen is kind of funny, at least for one time through the show.

There is a two-hour featurette (in two one-hour parts) that shows the Making and Casting of the Shadow Cast. I really enjoyed that also.

You won't be sorry to get this edition even if you have prior editions. I've got the 15th anniversary Laserdisc edition, the 25th anniversary DVD edition, and now the 35th anniversary blu-ray edition, and the new one is the best yet :)",1289952000,2,1510,4.487272727272727

492357,1,6302637899,"I first saw this movie with a group of friends back in high school at the Midnight Movies in the mid-80s. Back then I remember it being a fun but odd experience and interesting to see the audience participation, but when I recently caught this film again on TV, I really couldn't believe how truly dreadful it was. Like many others who give this movie low ratings, I do not understand the cult following of this film. For such great talent (Curry, Sarandon, Bostwick and others) to be a part of something on this low level is pretty surprising, even this early in their careers, (with perhaps the exception of actor Charles Gray who has no excuse for this - ANY role he's done is ALWAYS played the same way, with no range at all - his best role you'll find is probably his portrayal of Blofeld in the '71 Bond film Diamonds Are Forever). As an adult now, I find Rocky Horror to be boring, and actually repulsive in many ways, and probably even worse as a musical production, and just plain stupid in many parts. At one time it might have been fun at the high school level, but overall, it really is an awful movie that is really only watchable in the context of a Midnight Movie-showing atmosphere with a lot of people joining in with singing and lots of interaction with what is on-screen. But on its own, it just doesn't stand up.",1288656000,12,1332,4.396761133603239

Enter Blu-Ray.  WOW!  The video is absolutely flawless and the audio is amazing.  This is how RHPS should be seen.

Do not miss this release!",1288569600,,298,4.25
492399,5,6302637899,"I could not be more pleased with this purchase.  This is truly the ultimate fan service for anyone who loved The Rocky Horror Picture Show!  The 1080/24p remastering is astounding.  Most of the movie looks like it was filmed this year.  You can see immaculate detail.  The color has been improved, and some of the costumes in the film pop out in startling fashion!  Some scenes (particularly the criminologist scenes) do seem a bit soft, but for the most part the film looks perfect.

The 7.1 surround sound mix is just crazy good.  The songs sound deep and sharp, and you'll notice several nuances you never heard before.  I've never heard the movie sound this clear.  One thing I did notice is that the songs seem louder than the rest of the film, however.  Also, ""Over At The Frankenstein Place"" has a minor flub, as a different take of Susan Sarandon's vocals was used.  It's not super-glaring, and it doesn't sound bad (despite what other reviews say) but hardcore fans will definitely notice it.  The mono track is the same as the original film.

The special features, sadly, are nothing to shout about.  The Blu-ray still contains both the US and UK version of the movie (the UK features the song, ""Superheroes""), which is a real treat.  Further, you have the option to view either version with the alternate opening.  This film was originally intended to be in black-and-white up until the ""Time Warp"" scene where it would burst into color (like The Wizard of Oz), but back in 1975 it was too expensive to do and it was never released this way.  Now you can view it like this if you want, and it's selectable from the main menu as opposed to being an Easter Egg like the DVD version.

The packaging is just beautiful.  It comes in a glossy book containing some great pictures and quotes from the film.  The disc is on the inside back cover in a recess.  It truly pays homage to this classic film.

As for the movie itself, well, if you're buying this set you probably already know what it is.  At the time of its original release the movie was a huge critical and commercial flop.  But over time it's become hugely popular and currently holds the honor of having the longest theatrical run in film history!  The film is a rock opera about two unsuspecting lovers who stumble across an old castle inhabited by a transvestite mad scientist, his servants and his creation (a blond muscle man).  The songs are actually really great, and despite the loose plot, this is one of the most entertaining films of all time!  Highly-recommended!",1288569600,7,2541,4.599109131403118

492401,3,6302637899,"I attended a performance/screening of this because friends were involved in the local production. Then I watched the video for the first time on Amazon On-Demand. I found both experiences pleasant, and I really enjoyed dancing during the audience participation and having rice and cold water thrown at me (mild adrenaline rush!). On the other hand, I didn't find much of the humor in the audience participation to be actually funny--mostly tired and harsh/crude. But overall I definitely enjoyed being there with friends and the local community, the outrageous costumes and safe shedding of inhibitions.

I also enjoyed seeing the movie for the first time so that I could actually catch the dialogue/lyrics and experience the characters as intended. Again, a lot of things didn't ""work"" for me about the movie--especially the lack of plot, point, or sane character development--but a bisexual caste prancing around in garters made up for a lot of that, as did the memories of audience-participation. I feel pretty ""meh"" about the soundtrack overall, but some of it adds a lot to the ""coolness"" factor.

If you're not already a Rocky Horror fan, don't grab this expecting it to be brilliant. Try to experience the audience participation, or at least think about whether this is the sort of spectacle (it's not much of a story) you'd like.",1288396800,,1337,5.04524886877828

Now that I know where ""The time warp"" comes from, I think I could die without hearing that song ever again.  There is absolutely NO story line, the characters are NOT relatable and stupid, and the songs all SUCK!  What is the big deal about this junk!?  I mean c'mon people!

It always bugged me that the stereo mixes on the older versions dating back to VHS and laserdisc merely used the original soundtrack album recording dubbed over the movie soundtrack.  This was most notable during the ""Time Warp"" when Magenta would sing.  The vocals in the movie are completely different from the vocals on the album.  The movie has more of a ""sung live"" sound while the album is definitely a studio recording.  I'm so happy to be able to hear Patricia Quinn's vocals from the movie now on Blu-ray!  Also, the picture is so sharp that I saw numbers written on Tim Curry's thigh that I never noticed before and I've seen the movie well over 100 times.  My only concern is an odd little ""beep"" that happens during the ""Time Warp"" when the party-goers ""bring their knees in tight.""  It's a very strange little sound that happens every time the knees come together.  I don't know if this is something only on the 7.1 track as I haven't listened to the other versions yet, but it was odd and I hope not a problem with the audio since it is superior to any other version to date.  The disk also includes the US and UK versions as well as the option to see the first part of the movie as it was originally intended - in black and white!  That was a hidden easter egg on the last DVD version, but it's much easier to access now.

The Double Disc DVD was exceptional...with fabulous bonus features.  This Blu-Ray has a load of new bonus features that unless you are in them are ridiculous by comparison.  The VH1 feature from the last set which had Richard O'Brien strumming his acoustic guitar and walking through the house singing tunes and talking about the movie...GONE! Instead we get 3 minutes of a barely coherent Mick Rock who says quite rightly, that while others say he took the best shots ...he actually took the ONLY shots!  The 1 hour casting of the shadow cast....dreadful.

Lets get to the movie itself....because a stunning transfer would make me forgive at least some of this...and  sadly , perhaps its the source material, but it has good patches and bad patches. This is a seriously overpriced ,over hyped ,  bloated with lame special features edition.

Therefore you can imagine my surprise when I popped in this blu ray and felt like I was watching a 2010 remake.  The picture quality is STUNNING!  Details pop out vividly that went by unnoticed in standard definition and colors blast the screen in absolute perfect clarity.  I cannot go on long enough about how perfect the picture looks.  I'm not new to blu ray and I know how much data 35mm film holds, but releases like this still blow my mind and remind me how amazing a good 1080p transfer is.

Likewise the audio transfer is a miracle.  Whatever restoration they used is beyond wonderful and sounds 1000000x better than my old CD soundtrack.

My only complaint is that the song ""There's a Light (Over at the Frankenstein Place)"" is noticeably different from the versions I remember.  I don't know how or why this is (maybe i'm just not used to hearing it in surround sound?) but the backup chorus sounds really awkward to me.  If anybody knows why this is I'd be interested to find out.

Overall - A+++ transfer! If you have any love for this movie or have never seen it before you owe it to yourself to purchase it on Blu Ray.

The fact that they couldn't even offer a sub audio track of the original SAL PIRO audience Participation LP is MINDBLOWING.

492445,5,6302637899,"THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW. Few films have earned such an enormous cult-following as this campy classic from 1975. Set to an assortment of electrifying rock numbers and huge power ballads, ROCKY HORROR is an operatic Horror Comedy that is unlike anything else in the cinematic landscape. No stage could have contained this crazed adaptation, and few films since have reached the same level of energy and insanity! Upon being stranded on the side of the road, the newly-engaged Brad and Janet are invited to stay the night in a manic mansion where Rocky is celebrating his first birthday. You see, the diabolical Dr. Frank-N-Furter has just created the perfect man, and everyone is celebrating by putting on an elaborate stage show! To reveal any more would spoil much of the fun, as ROCKY HORROR is simply a spectacle that must been seen to believe. The film puts together a strange and unusual collection of characters, featuring Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick as the straight-laced lovers that are caught in the middle of Dr. Frank-N-Furter's sexual experiments and all of the confused excitement. Tim Curry's transgendered Transylvanian host is as iconic and memorable as Dracula or The Wolf Man, and his ghoulishly over-the-top character has become instantly recognizable in cultures around the globe. Having obviously been influenced by the stage productions of the earlier plays, ROCKY HORROR incorporates many garish costumes and wildly exotic sets that perfectly fit the on-screen absurdity. An astounding 35-years after its initial release, THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW continues to shock and entertain audiences at midnite movie houses spanning the world over, making it the single longest-running theatrical release of all-time, and quite possibly the most enjoyable!

AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE... FOR 35 YEARS

New High Definition Transfer Of Time Warp Cult Classic Debuts On Blu-ray Disc October 19

LOS ANGELES, CA. (Aug. 4, 2010) - Let's do the Time Warp again!

Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment celebrates the 35th anniversary of the pop culture phenomenon The Rocky Horror Picture Show with the Blu-ray Disc debut on October 19. The greatest cult film of all time and still in limited release, The Rocky Horror Picture Show is the longest-running theatrical release in film history.

A divine film adaptation from Richard O'Brien's British musical horror comedy/rock opera, produced by Lou Adler and Michael White, The Rocky Horror Picture Show features revered performance by Tim Curry (Clue, Home Alone) as a bizarre and self-proclaimed ""sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania,"" and Susan Sarandon (Dead Man Walking, Thelma and Louise) and Barry Bostwick (""Spin City""), as Brad and Janet, a couple who find themselves lost on a cold, rainy night. The madcap, musical mayhem begins when the couple takes refuge in the castle of Dr. Frank-N-Furter as he is about to unveil his greatest creation - and have a bit of fun with his reluctant guests.

Boasting a newly-restored high definition transfer and 7.1 audio sure to make fans shiver with an-tic-i-pation, the anniversary edition Blu-ray truly brings the Midnight experience home wtih exclusive new content including Rocky-oke: Sing It!, Picture-In-Picture Shadowcast Performance, Vintage Callback Track (Unrated), Prop Box, Shadowcasting documentary, as well as exclusive new content including BD-LIVE: Live Lookup(tm) Powered by IMDb, Photo Galleries, as well as Deleted Scenes, Audio Commentary and more. For a limited time, The Rocky Horror Picture Show: 35th Anniversary will be packaged in a collectible 24-page book featuring legendary photography from Mick Rock, best known for his iconic shots of rock and roll artists. Rock served as the chief photographer on the film.

Arriving in time for Halloween, The Rocky Horror Picture Show: 35th Anniversary Blu-ray Disc will be available for the suggested retail price of $34.99 U.S. / $37.99 CAN. Pre-book is September 8.

Selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant,"" the film gained notoriety as a midnight movie when audiences began participating with the film in theaters. The film has entered the pop culture lexicon for its many iconic and memorable scenes, including the song ""The Time Warp"" which has been covered by handfuls of artists and the often quoted phrase, ""Dammit, Janet.""

The Rocky Horror Picture Show: 35th Anniversary Blu-ray Disc release is just one aspect of Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment's yearlong campaign to honor the studio's 75th birthday. This year the division will debut several select fan-favorites on Blu-ray for the first time ever including The Sound Of Music 45th Anniversary Edition, William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, Moulin Rouge!, The Last of the Mohicans and the Alien Anthology.

Of course there is a fair amount of deviant activity in the movie including but not limited to: infidelity, drug use, cannibalism, incest and bioengineering a human being for sexual pleasure. What proves interesting is that over the past 25 years our society has embraced many of the things considered outlandish when the movie first hit theaters such as: homosexuality, bikers, cross dressing and tattoos.

I explain to the class that when the movie originally came out it bombed. For the very reasons it failed at first, I encouraged my students NOT to watch the Rocky Horror Picture Show for the first time at home alone. It is an experiential movie, and an experience best enjoyed at midnight with a crowd of zany folks dressed in costumes from the show, singing, dancing, hurling toast and whatnot, all while exchanging dialog with the movie.

Rocky Horror fans probably are interested in the DVD extras. Honestly, they're kind of a bust. Otherwise the culmination of a B-movie plot, outrageously compelling characters and trademark music make this flick worth adding to your collection.",1278374400,,1139,4.958115183246074

492525,4,6302637899,"Don't dream it, be it!

That is the motto of the hedonistic main character and self-proclaimed ""Sweet Transvestite"", Frank N. Furter, (the incredible and unabashed Tim Curry), in the cult classic film The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  What started out as a Broadway play in England became, (after we here in the States warmed up to it a bit), a widely-loved and highly re-created piece of glitz, glam and transvestites that parodies the worlds of science fiction and horror.

Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon star as Brad and Janet, a newly engaged couple who end up at Dr. Furter's mansion after their car gets a flat tire.  They just want to use the phone to call for help.  They don't realize that as soon as they step through the door, their lives will be changed forever!

Richard O'Brien, who wrote the screenplay, the script and the music for the film, stars as Riff Raff, Dr. Furter's assistant and ""handyman"".  He and the rest of the group harbor a deeper secret that will evolve into the science fiction-like conclusion of the film.

Magenta, (played by Patricia Quinn), is the mansion's maid and Riff Raff's sister, with whom she shares an unusually close bond.  She also shares her bedroom with Columbia.

Columbia, (Nell Campbell), is a groupie to the clan and was apparently brought to the mansion by, and had a former relationship with, Dr. Furter.  She was also involved with Eddie, (Meat Loaf), an ex-delivery boy who has been frozen somewhere in the mansion after a portion of his brain was harvested for Dr. Furter's human creation, Rocky Horror.

Rocky, (Peter Hinwood), is Dr. Furter's creation and his embodiment of all that he believes to be masculine and muscular.  Furter will stop at nothing to protect his prized creation.  Rocky is mute, save for his brief participation in musical numbers.  He allows himself to be seduced later on by the no-longer-as-uptight Janet, much to the chagrin of everyone.

Dr. Scott, (Jonathan Adams), is Eddie's uncle and Brad and Janet's former teacher.  He shows up at the mansion when he realizes that Eddie has gone missing and suspects that this is where he may have ended up.  Unfortunately, he's a bit too late.

The group believes in pleasure to the highest ilk, from pansexuality to lavish musical numbers, anything and everything goes.  And we get to learn about these events through the narrator, the criminologist, played by Charles Gray.

The soundtrack is filled with catchy, high-powered gems.  ""Time Warp"" will have you dancing right along, the criminologist giving you the steps as you go.  ""Hot Patootie"" is Eddie's only number but a toe-tapper nonetheless.  In ""Rose Tint My World"", Frank puts on a floor show and here we see the final stages of the transformation of Brad and Janet.  Dr. Scott even allows himself to loosen up!  ""Science Fiction, Double Feature"", the film's opener, lists some of the classic horror and science fiction films that, no doubt, helped to influence this production.  There are many more delightful tunes in this film that will hook you, even if the story seems a bit ridiculous and the ""special effects"" seem a tad dated.  This is playing dress up at its best!",1250726400,,3166,4.845437616387337

We'll just say that it took a few years for it to really grow on me, and one day, it just clicked. Now I love it. It's one of my favorite musicals. I love how no-holds-barred weird it is...and it is WEIRD! I mean, you have an obvious homage to B-movies, sci-fi, and horror all rolled into one crazy storyline - and some of the strangest songs ever written - all thrown up on the screen, and right in your face. Speaking of the songs, they're all great. Ridiculously goofy, but great! You have all of these elements tucked in to the creepy haunted house/laboratory atmosphere, and it works in it's own strange way. Most of it looks incredibly cheap, which compliments the film.

And then theres the cast. First of all, Tim Curry tears up the screen. I mean, he chews up every bit of scenery in which he is present! The other actors don't have time to breathe around him, although they are excellent as well. Susan Surandon and Barry Bostwick play our ""hero"" and our ""heroine"", Brad and Janet - one of the nerdiest couples ever committed to the silver screen. You've got to see it to believe it. Back to Tim Curry. I don't know whether to call his performance Oscar worthy or not, but it sure comes close. It takes a REAL MAN to dress up in a teddy and fishnets they way that he does...once you get over the initial shock of his character, you end up laughing your head off. He's hilarious...and he really gets in to it!

Strangely enough, I prefer Rocky Horror on it's own, without the audience participation. I tried that one time. Had no idea what I was getting in to at the time. I went dressed in khaki pants and a button down dress shirt, very spiffy. I felt so out of place. People kept staring at me. I found that I couldn't enjoy the film what with all of the screaming and yelling. However, I did like the fact that we got to throw rice and shoot water guns in the theatre. That was the only part of the interactive experience that I enjoyed. I'd much rather watch it on my own, late at night, preferably with a thunderstorm booming on outside for the sake of ambience...

It's one of the great camp classics of all time, if you can just give in to it! It really depends on who you are. If you are easily offended, you'll cut it off within the first 20 minutes or so. If not, you'll love it!",1239580800,2,2392,4.26431718061674

I'm telling you, the experience of seeing it at midnight with a bunch of...well...anyways, it was almost as big an experience as the movie itself, but this is not a review of the time I had, but the film so I will refrain from anymore details.

The film is a total head-trip, but in a good way; a great way even.  Janet Weiss and her boyfriend Brad Majors are stranded and need some help so they stumble onto a mansion that looks promising, but instead they are introduced to a slew of creepy creatures from the Transylvanian galaxy that show that a romping good time filled with singing, dancing and some naughty after party action.

Like I said; head-trip.

I really don't know what else there is to say about this movie because it's less a movie and more an experience.  Sure it has a campy sci-fi plot and it executes it well (complete with monster creations and alien banishment) but that is not the point.

You have to experience it to believe it; seriously.

The acting is flawless throughout, especially from the two leads; Curry and Sarandon.  Susan Sarandon, one of our most capable actresses working today, or ever, is amazing here.  This is one of her earliest roles.  She's young and stunning and commanding in every scene; and what a voice.  Tim Curry tackles what may be considered one of the most fearless roles in the history of cinema as Dr. Frank-N-Furter.  There is no hesitation in his step for he is fully confident and comfortable in his platform shoes.  Without that confidence this performance and this film would have tanked, big time, but Curry carries it on his shoulders flawlessly.

Why can't Oscar recognize greatness like this?

In the end I highly recommend this film.  It is not a film for everyone, but it is a film that everyone should experience at least once.  There is nothing else out that even comes remotely close to this film, in subject and in execution.  These are those rarities that will never be repeated.

492659,1,6302637899,"In 1975, if memory serves, Rocky Horror was invented and the musical comedy, no doubt to your knowledge became a super-cult crave following all over the globe. Transients, drug users, queens and flamboyant lots, eccentric film buffs of all shady styles, cross dressing wall street stiffs, kids at heart, Parrotheads...that common bond that can make Rocky Horror have a very broad flavor of fans.

Perhaps I never grew onto the 12 midnight showings of this film during my early twenties, or the live stage shows, because well, its like Gallagher, why would anyone be interested? The groupies that abound RHPS type events are all whack-jobs.

I love musicals, I love nutty, insane, brilliant and not so brilliant films. Love Oliver!, Love the Sound of Music, even the sleeper Newsies, love the 'can't sing for squat', talented Rex Harrison in Dr. DooLittle, even sort of loved Moulin Rouge, not quite, but almost and of course Willy Wonka. (Wilder, not Depp)

Rocky Horror is the kind of movie that wants to sit next to films like 'Donnie Darko', 'Something Wicked This Way Comes', 'Almost Famous', perhaps even next to 'Queen's Live at Wembley Stadium', (for the cult appeal), however the only place it will find a spot in my heart for is a review on Amazon. Richard Obrien and Tim Curry's talent not withstanding, let the mess of this film have its bloodbath of rave reviews from gender-bending, egotistical, self centered, pompous jerks, who parade around like its Carnival in Rio; and the tacky, boring, mindless film can attest to that following and lend its hand onto perhaps a new, more accepting myspace, emo culture who will eat it up and ask for seconds almost immediately.",1222041600,8,1681,4.911971830985915
492660,5,6302637899,"The Rocky Horror Picture Show has been around for 33 years now, and I still hear people ask ""What's the appeal to this?  It looks dumb!!""  Well, my friends, the only way to find out is to be willing to overlook the stupidity, and allow yourself to simply enjoy the ride for what it is...an iconic mosaic of insanity.

Back in 1981, I had the priviledge of seeing this movie for the first time...6 years after it's emergence.  I was 16 years old, and knew absolutely NOTHING about it...with the exception that it was THE movie to see on a Friday or Saturday night.  Pretty much everyone in my high school had seen it, and I wasn't about to be left out, so off I go, into the unknown.  I didn't know about being called out as a ""virgin"", or being ""lei-d"" until I got there and one of my friends spied me (she turned me in to the ""cast"").  From the moment I was marked with that huge V on my forehead, I was hooked!!!  What was to be just a movie experience turned into one of the wildest rides of my life!!

Now, it's 2008, and I STILL go to live shows of RHPS.  I am proud of the fact that I know every word, both in the movie, and of what the audience says in return.  I am proud (even if a bit dumb) that I've seen this movie in that way 34 times, and will be making that 35 this Halloween.  I do dress up...I fully participate...and once again, I enjoy that wonder I felt from that day so long ago.

Perhaps it's a bit childish, but the originality of the whole story remains after all this time.  Since there are plenty of reviews that explain the basic story plot, I won't bother you with all that.  These days, most people have seen at least part of this movie, and the story line is out there for anyone wanting to learn more.  And yes...to be honest, the story line sucks, and yet...it's wonderful at the same time.  It's a spoof of old horror films, and that's it.  Yet, this spoof has outlived some of the more classic films that have fairly good plot lines (The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby), and it's done it BECAUSE it's a spoof.  It's never been intended to be taken seriously, or to truely frighten.  Au contraire...it's a complete farce, yet one that gives rise to the feeling that, if you don't pay close attention, you might miss something important.

The DVD allows those who, for whatever reason, haven't seen a live showing, to get the feel of what is meant by audience participation, and that alone gives it great value.  Seeing this in the privacy of your home won't allow you to truely experience what RHPS is, but it WILL get you pretty close.  For those who live in areas where you can't catch a live show, this video allows you to enjoy, not only the movie, but the hilarity of making fun of it.

In 1976, it was rereleased, and not only was the verdict reversed, but to this day has a cult following. This is an interesting work of art in that it combines music, comedy, horror, and tragedy. The movie starts with a wedding. And then we see that Brad and Janet decide to get engaged. The movie actually starts happy, but there are some bad omens as well. (Such as them singing of their love for each other in a graveyard, and when an empty coffin is brought into the church.) They then have some car trouble, and go into the castle for help. This is when the trouble begins. To make a long story short, they are introduced to different monster type characters like Magenta, Riff Raff, and Dr. Frank N Furter. Poor Brad and Janet find themselves in a 'hell on earth.' Brad and Janet are not often seen in a favorable light. But think about it! They had some car trouble; and all they really wanted was to borrow the telephone to call for help, and they  end up corrupted and violated. The big tragedy here is that most of these characters are driven by their own pleasures and desires with no real moral brakes so to speak. (The boundaries of 'this far and no further' are most certainly crossed.) And even the innocent and sympathetic Janet becomes corrupted in this environment. One thing that makes this dvd so interesting is that we have an interesting paradox. We have  characters who fall on tragedy, but music that is lively and energetic. The movie also ends with a major bang, but there is notable tragedy in that no one really gains any insight into human nature, and even the few characters who come out alive don't go through any real growth. The movie  seems to be a hell on earth where the party eventually ends (in a very tragic  manner for some) while the survivors just want to party more.  The dvd has some interesting extras such as a commentary with Riff Raff and Magenta, and prompters if you wish to participate in the show. This is not only an interesting cult movie to follow, but it is a nice way to have a 70s night. It is also good if you want to see a tragic musical.",1220313600,2,2225,4.37772397094431

I've seen both releases and they're the same. Take one of the early tunes, 'Over at the Frankenstein Place', it has an echo to it, making the music itself sound signifcantly different. I own the soundtrack and the VHS tape and they're the originals. I'm amazed that no one has commented on this before.

492695,5,6302637899,"A biazarre film and a work of genius.  It pokes fun at virtually everything including old science fiction movies; horror movies; transvestites: homosexuals; incest; professional spokesmen; sexual innocence; UFO's; cannibalism and even Nazi Germany.

Franknfurter, or  whatever his name is, has the qualities of a transvestite, bisexual Count Dracula and Dr. Frankenstein.  He's also an ""evil"" person who seduces both Brad an Janet.  He's also quite a scientist and has produced the perfect man--""I've made me a man with blond hair and...a tan to ease my tension.""  This has elements of Nazi racial theory.  ""It's a triumph of your Vill!!! an excited Magenta emotes [Triumph of the Will by Leni Raftenstein on the up-and-coming Adolf Hitler].  Unfortunately, this blond superman is used for Frank's carnal purposes, another slap at Nazi theory.

Anyway, it's all a lot of fun right up until the very end when the persecuted and  Igor-like Riff Raff, dressed like a rather extreme Flash Gordon character, and Magenta, with white streaked hair reminiscent of the ""Bride of Frankenstein"", show up to blast Frank and his one-time girl friend Columbia, with absolutely ridiculous ray guns.

It's all unbelievably stupid which makes it a near perfect comedy.

Now I have a question for all those who read my review.  A couple of years ago I saw a rather bad movie called ""Return to the Valley  of the Dolls"" produced, I think, a year or two before ""Rocky"".  It has many for the features of ""Rocky"" and I wonder if ""Rocky"" ripped off ""Return"" or vice versa.  Does anybody have the  answer?

The performances, the music, the costumes, and the dead-on parodies of various horror/sci fi movie clichs are perfectly enjoyable on their own...but, of course, the film lends itself to collective experience in a way none others have before, or since.

All the performers seem to have a sixth sense about how to play their roles - no small feat considering the rather offbeat material - but for me, it's all about Tim Curry. With the wrong actor playing Frank, the film would have crashed and burned (actually, with the wrong actor playing Frank, the original play would never have had a life past its initial run in London's Theatre Upstairs). He became a true film icon with this role, and it's easy to understand why. His performance is a delicate balancing act - feminine flounce with masculine power; outrageous but always controlled. His Frank is gorgeous and unbelievably sexy, with a voice from the gods - both speaking and singing.

The movie, based on the stage play Tee Rocky Horror Show, it is filled with memorable songs and lines, and great early performances from Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick (the mayor on Spin City), Meat Loaf and Tim Curry.

This edition comes with both the UK and the US versions of the movie, but the only difference is the UK version has an extra song, which isn't that great and it is at the end of the movie when you are ready for it to be wrapping up.

Because it's God-awful and stupid. It was only after many years of playing as a 'midnight movie' that it finally made any money. Even then, the show was frequented by high school drop-outs, hippie wanna-be types and other losers who had nothing better to do than try to act like the idiot characters on the screen. Jeez....not even 'I Spit On Your Grave' or 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' were this bad.

With a sincere apology to Tim Curry, who is an otherwise fine actor, but here, he is just one VERY ugly alien transvestite singing silly songs. And his name...Frank-N-Furter? Ooooh...how original. I wonder how many functioning, non-drug addicted brain cells it took to think that up??

But it is and you can just see some of the actors baffled as to the sheer stupidity of what their doing. Some such as Tim Curry revel in the sheer nonsense this film provides. But seriously, those songs are beyond awful. My hatred for them rivals having to listen to Kate Bush's Wuthering Heights and that's intense. But Kate Bush has made some great songs so that's OK. This however, is the movie equivalent of getting an axe through your spinal cord. How it's achieved cult status is something that will have to go down on the peculiar habits of humans.

One to buy if you're an eccentric soul who loves to hear people singing out of tune, out of key and with little regard to anything other trying to sound funny when it clearly isn't. In short if you like those Simpsons episodes where there's not 5 seconds without launching into another song.

492904,5,6302637899,"If one were to ask a film critic what they consider to be the greatest movie ever made, ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" would most likely not be a popular answer. If you look at this madcap rock 'n' roll musical from a purely cinematic point of view, it's easy to understand why: an amateurish attempt at a story, less than stellar performances, virtually nonexistent production values, and some of the cheapest special effects ever captured on film (even for the year 1975). When caught up in technicalities and a longing for mainstream purity, then one would have a perfectly good argument for ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" being one of the worst movies ever made.

But if one were to ask a fan of the film why they love it so much, I guarantee you that their reason has nothing to do with production values or mainstream desirability. Quite the opposite--it's a film that's shunned by most audiences. This hasn't stopped it from becoming one of the most successful cult films ever made, grossing to date over $100 million (this is over a thirty year period, mind you; it's initial release was a disaster). This is because ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" is not just a motion picture. It's a pure social and cultural experience, one that has liberated numerous people labeled by society as ""misfits"" or ""outcasts"" with its message of, ""Don't dream it, be it.""

It's also a ritual that warrants midnight gatherings on Fridays and Saturdays dressed as one of the film's characters. The fun is enhanced through the use of props (such as rice, water pistols, and toilet paper, all of which are used on cue) as well as by the act of shouting vulgar lines back to the screen. This trend of audience participation has remained a staple in ""Rocky Horror""'s successful history and only adds to its appeal. Can you imagine how uninteresting it would be to view this film in the privacy of your own home?

Above all else, it's an opportunity to have fun, allowing for (and often encouraging) the release of the party animal within us all. Only at a ""Rocky Horror"" showing would no one blink when seeing an audience decked out in fishnet stockings, glittering corsets, and pasty makeup plastered on their faces. Everyone is uninhibited and no one cares what others may think. What a great excuse for a year round Halloween party.

""Rocky Horror"" is also about the music, with some of the most classic songs ever recorded, including the show stopping ""Sweet Transvestite,"" the delightfully sappy ""Dammit Janet,"" and ""The Time Warp,"" the film's signature song (which prompts the audience to get up and dance along with it). In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the very fabric of the film's greatness depends on the music. And why not? The oddball mix of science fiction, horror, sex, and comedy just aren't enough; all that can be seen in plenty of other cult films. Give us something more, something that would leave a lasting impression on the ones who took the time to see what this movie was all about. Through music, ""Rocky Horror"" does that, and does that well.

Of all the performances in this film, Tim Curry as the transvestite mad scientist Dr. Frank N. Furter is the most memorable. His decadence and sexual overdrive hits us like a ton of bricks and never lets up. (And who really wants it to?) In the tradition of Frankenstein's Monster (who has just come out of the closet), Frank actually creates a muscle man named Rocky for the sole purpose of ""relieving his tension."" The Middle American, wholesome young couple Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) couldn't be more out of place in the world Frank lives in, which makes the situation they're in all the more entertaining. Things only get weirder when you throw in a houseful of servants with quirks of their own, such as hunchbacked butler, a voyeuristic maid, and a tap dancing groupie. Top that off with the film's sinfully twisted story about the night that Brad and Janet spend in Frank's castle, and you have all the ingredients for a cult classic.

Like such offbeat films as ""Forbidden Zone"" and ""Pink Flamingos,"" ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" is a film that is experienced, not seen. From its humble beginnings as a London stage play to the creation (and initial failure) of the movie we all know today, ""Rocky Horror"" has given story creator and Riff Raff portrayer Richard O'Brien a godlike status among fans. The film is pure camp from start to finish: fun, cheesy, and entertaining. Whether you've seen it 1,000 times (some have actually seen it more than that) or are seeing it for the first time (which would label you as a ""virgin""), it remains to this day a very unique piece of celluloid history.

Well, what are you waiting for? Pop in the DVD. Don your garter belt, spiked heels, and party hat. Get your water pistols, newspapers, and lighters. And above all else, let's do the Time Warp again!",1138752000,44,4900,4.69732246798603

So with a reputation like that, it would seem that ROCKY HORROR is damn near flawless.  But as a pure film, without the fun of the audience participation, that's not so.  The first half nearly jumps out of its socks with excitement and music.  By the time you're into the latter half, it has slowed to an almost comatose level.

Genre Grade: B+

Final Grade: B

My friend Nicki has been pestering me for months to watch this movie so I finally did, and I think she is going to kill me when she reads my review of it. I think I'm being fair in giving it the grade that I am.. Keep in mind that this is only MY opinion of the film, and I can definitely see why this movie has such a large cult following. It is extremely original and very unique, not to mention risque for its day and age.

This is one twisted movie. The music was interesting, the costumes and characters outrageous, but I think this movie faltered greatly in having a strong story. It jumps all around between a transvestite who owns the mansion, the newly engaged couple who originally just wanted to find their friend Dr. Scott and tell them the happy news, to the Frankenstein-esque monster named ""Rocky"" who looks like he's an anorexic steroid-addict. Between the high-pitched singing, the wild sets, and the annoying characters, this movie is probably one of the most ""out there"" movies I've ever seen.

And thus is the reason why I think this movie is respected so much. While I was not crazy about it, I do think it was well-made (the cinematography is very Kubrickish) and did entertain despite its seemingly random plot. I suggest this film to anyone who enjoys musicals, because I swear you've never seen anything quite like it. I might compare this movie to Hedwig and the Angry Inch, but in reality they're nothing alike. And...I actually enjoyed Hedwig a little more.",1116979200,3,1556,4.664233576642336

It's not supposed to be taken seriously like those straight Hollywood movies. It's a movie for the audiences to sing along and dance along, and put on some makeup and a wig if you dare,'cause Tim Curry is just a Sweet Transvestite! Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick had no idea what nightmare or crazy party they were about to experince when they entered Dr. Frankfurter's mansion, played brilliantly Tim Curry.

492930,5,6302637899,"Well, here you have it, people. The greatest cult phenomenon of all time, a film that will shock you and surprise you, a film you will never forget as long as you live - ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"".

When this silver screen classic was released in 1975 after being performed onstage in London and New York, it was a big flop. However, the film slowly gained popularity when some local New York movie theaters started showing it at mdinight, and the reaction was wild. Audiences brought their own props, they came to the theaters dressed as their favorite characters, and even made up their own dialogue for the film and shout it at the screen.

Now, 30 years later, you can experience this timeless filmon dvd. Digitally remastered by the good people at Fox, you can now experience it all over again. Some people may call this film tacky and even offensive, but don't judge a book by its cover until you look athese features:

See! The huge stars in this film before they were famous. Susan Sarandon (as Janet), Barry Bostwick (as Brad), Meatloaf (as Eddie) and, of course, Tim Curry (as transvestite Dr. Frank - N -Furter) lead the pack of a talented bunch of actors in this inspired combination of comedy, musical and science - fiction.

Hear! The classic songs that are mong the best in musical history. Get ready to do dance ""Time Warp"", bop to Meatloaf's ""Hot Patootie"" and be ""touch - a, touch - a, touched"" by the sweet romantacism of ""Dammit! Janet"".

And last but not least, gawk at the outrageous taboos that were still unheard of in movies from 1975, including homosexuality, lesbianism, tranvestism, nudity, violence and sex. Best not to watch it with kids under 12.

This dvd also comes with intriguing special features. You can watch the film in two different versions, the U.S. and U.K. version (the U.K. version has an alternate ending), audio commentary by cast members Richard O'Brien (who wrote the play) and Patricia Quinn (who played Magenta, the sister of O'Brien's sinister Riff Raff). You can also watch the film with the audience participation. It's as if you were in the theater! PLus, there's much more.

Basically, what I'm saying is to pick up this dvd. I'm sure that anyone with even the slightest bit of good taste will enjoy this film classic.",1111276800,12,2279,4.711055276381909
492961,4,6302637899,"I had to re write this first sentence because I was going to start this review by saying this is one of my few guilty(movie)pleasures.
But I can't honestly say I can feel guilty in any way about this film. It is such a fantastic send up and musical romp of the horror/sci fi film genre done in such a unique manner that I'm into it from beginning to end without a second thought.
Now this is a film I believe that to really experience it you should have seen it at least once at a movie theatre. There you would not only come to understand why it is such a cult phenom but it would enchance your viewing of it in your own home. I have seen it many,many times ""live"" and I always find myself referencing that when I watch it now at home.
I have watched this movie in home with people who had only heard of the film but never had had the opportunity to see it ""live"".Some have liked it but the general concensus is one of either ""huh?"" or ""I don't get it"".The sexual references in the film coupled with the suggestive dress seems to be an off-putting factor that with proper pre theatre exposure would I think in most cases allay their feelings quite a bit.
This review is probably going to be read more by those who are already RHPS converts so this is probably the one review I will ever write that will be preaching,more than any other,to the ""choir"".
However if you are a RHPS virgin,I would recommend you see this film ""live"" first,if at all possible. If you can't, just view it with an open mind and sit back and let IT do the walking and talking. You are in for a totally unique viewing experience unlike any other you will have. The plot is see through to be sure but let the characters and especially the music just wash over you and go with the wonderful flow.

The musical arrangements are very organic and seventies. And the comedy is wonderfully deadpan.

It's true, repeated viewings do help to make some sense of this sexually twisted little musical.  To this day there's something sinister, awkward, and vaguely repulsive about seeing Tim Curry in drag as Dr. Frank.  Brad and Janet, Republican squares, end up at the castle home of the afore mentioned doctor on the night he breaths life into his male blonde Adonis creation, Rocky.  Gender bending and partner swapping ensue throughout the night as Brad and Janet endure sexual awakenings neither planned on nor felt they wanted.  The rest of the denizens of the castle complete the cast, especially the erstwhile sibling help, Magenta and Riff Raff.  Meatloaf entertains as Eddy, the psychotic Elvis inspired biker.  Frank N. Furter's bisexual / transvestite antics could be off putting, even grossly unappealing; but over all the film hits a key with certain societal elements and isn't too bad to take in otherwise.",1110153600,2,1000,5.067073170731708
492964,5,6302637899,"You have to have a special kind of mindset to view the Rocky Horror Picture Show, and it really is a film that either you love it or hate it. Its strengths are its fabulous score and its stagings, which are incredible. If you're looking for a strong plot, however, this is NOT the movie for you, because this is the most plotless of all musicals. It really is a musical for the sake of being a musical and nothing else. If you have a rather twisted sense of humor, a liking for the bizarre and unusual, and are ready to step out of the conventional mold in life, this movie is likely to be the trip you've been waiting for. If not, you'll probably want to sit this one out. It's definitely not for everybody.

It helps to understand that this movie was not a success originally. It was only in later years when in screenings that the audience participated in the showings that it started to gain popularity. At that time, it became a cult film with its own following. Today, audiences view it quite differently than they did when it first came out, with a very different sort of appreciation. It is still a very plotless musical that shines for its impressive score and stagings; most people who buy the movie have a favorite scene or song that makes them want to see it over and over. There's something almost hypnotic about the way it invites people to join in with the fun, which was how it became the popular film that it is today.

Tim Curry plays his part with all his heart and said for years afterward that he was happy to know that there were people as warped as he was, because he owed it to them that the film was such a success and contributed to his later success. The film did prove to be a springboard for his later career. The same could be said for the entire cast, however. Susan Sarandon in the part of Janet Weiss, a rather innocent type who sings in such a pure voice in the beginning, undergoes a transformation in the film much as did the real life Susan Sarandon in her career. Barry Bostwick, Richard O'Brien, Patricia Quinn, Little Nell, Peter Hinwood, Jonathan Adams, and Meatloaf all appear in the film that is solid entertainment from start to finish.

As a performer in two of the role-playing casts in the Boston area (check [...] I've had my share of experiences through Rocky Horror.  Most of them good, and needless to say I got exposed to a lot more about life and other things than I'd ever imagined!

What makes people go back again and again?  A lot of things, but the fact that this film and the theaters that run it are the one place for many that they can go and be accepted for who they are, and without reservations.  Usually.

The film itself is the offshoot of the successful London production, and while it did not translate to the screen immediately, it found its way.

It's really just not the same watching it at home (if that's all you've ever done, you're still a virgin!).  The send up of a long line of bad horror, sci-fi and other flicks that Richard O'Brien was raised on in the 50's were the catalyst, and they've led to a phenomena that cannot be accurately explained.

All I can say is, no matter how bad a film it may seem, it is a classic and a great work to us.

492967,5,6302637899,"After quitting the London cast of Jesus Christ Superstar over creative differences, actor Richard O'Brien needed an activity to fill some idle time.  He started tinkering with an idea for a rock musical play that would combine all the things that ""give you a buzz,"" from horror and science-fiction films to comedy and glam rock.  Impressed by the media coverage of Alice Cooper's recent concert assaults on London, O'Brien created what he initially called an ""Alice Cooper type Frankenstein"" character named Dr. Frank-N-Furter, who would build a blond muscleman for his own pleasure.  The rough idea for ""Rock Horroar"" went into rehearsals as ""They Came From Denton High,"" and was finally retitled ""The Rocky Horror Show"" before opening an intended three-week run (expanded to five) at the 63-seat Royal Court Theatre Upstairs in June 1973.  It transferred to larger theatres and ran for seven years before being revived. After winning major London theatre awards, The Rocky Horror Show was staged in America with Tim Curry at Lou Adler's Roxy Theatre in L.A. in March 1974.  During its ten-month run there, Lou Adler teamed with producer Michael White to produce a film version in England, using most of the English cast (Curry, O'Brien, Nell, Quinn, Adams) and singing discovery Meat Loaf from the Roxy cast.  After the play's failed month on Broadway, The Rocky Horror Picture Show premiered in London on August 14, 1975, and struggled to find its audience.  The film closely follows the satiric tone of the play, deriving its humor from stilted, deadpan sci-fi dialogue mixed with gender-bending imagery and loud rock and roll. It subverts classic science-fiction films by having the innocent Brad and Janet incredulously confront an outrageous alien mad doctor in place of a bug-eyed monster, as though Alice Cooper had renovated Dr. Frankenstein's lab for a musical version of It Came From Outer Space.  The cast is a wonderful collection of cartoonish eccentrics: Tim Curry's androgynous Frank; Richard O'Brien's weird, balding hunchback Riff Raff; Little Nell's squeaking, pink-haired groupie Columbia; Meat Loaf's tenor-voiced biker Eddie; Peter Hinwood's perfectly pumped beefcake Rocky Horror. The film is worth seeing on the big screen, for the ""audience participation"" and Jim Sharman's detailed use of the frame, but holds up equally well on DVD.  Before audiences celebrated their love of the film by vocally including themselves in the experience, there was the film.  By turns energetic when introducing the alien dance craze ""The Time Warp,"" ponderous when satirizing the pomposity of over-serious 50s sci-fi films, and sexually challenging when Tim Curry's Joan Crawford-esque Frank gazes into the camera (in tribute to Jean-Luc Godard, Jim Sharman's favorite director), The Rocky Horror Picture Show works as a strangely seductive musical fantasy, cleverly blending Richard O'Brien's pop culture obsessions into a multicolored collage that holds the secret- to life- itself!",1102204800,8,2994,5.364605543710021

The truth is that this is a totally unique, extraordinary amalgam of many different genres, melded together to make something original which will not be equalled, let alone bettered. Like all great works it actually improves with age, and with repeated viewings. Although I'd noticed, and puzzled over, the late-night queues for it in London's Chelsea for some months before, I saw it first with a live and lively participating audience in New York's Village, round about 1985. It was not a forgettable experience, although I admit to being bewildered most of the time. I bought the DVD about 18 months ago, watched it then, and have just watched it again. Many things come to notice with these repeat viewings. The writing is subtle, and deep. It's the kind of thing that a writer produces once in his life, and then cannot do again. It brings together so many strands of observation and experience, and expresses them, perfectly, in the idiom of the Zeitgeist. That makes it timeless, or, in other words, one for the time capsule. It doesn't date, because it is already dated. The performances are superb: Curry is just fan-bloody-tastic. He's even better than Mick Jagger at doing that thing. All the other characters are exactly right. Who knows what the film draws on: I seemed to see a quote from ""Night of the Living Dead"" in the boy and girl in the churchyard. American Gothic/European Gothic --- all the way from the 18th century. It's like the Marquis de Sade on a milkshake, and infinitely more entertaining. One thing: in the first showing that I saw I thought I remembered Charles Gray shaking a fishnet leg with the best of rest of them, but this scene didn't appear in the DVD (I have the 2 disc version).

The songs are ridiculous and the plot borderline retarded, but the characters are so over the top and the sexual energy makes this an unforgetable viewing experience. One word of caution... At least once in your life you need to go to a midnight screening of this movie with a rowdy bunch of veterans. Only then will you truly appreciate Rocky Horror.

My favorite character is Magenta. The sexy red-headed maid who is the alien sister of Riff Raff. They work for Dr. Frank-n-Furter, a transexual also from the planet Transexual. Magenta is a megababe and she could take me on a flight to her home planet. But I'd have to get her away from her love interest (her brother) before I could stare at the Transexual moon with her on the beach.

Susan Sarandon is very sexy in this movie running around in her bra and panties (Chicken Legs! Chicken Legs! Chicken Legs!). Her sexual energy starts off slow and sims at a low boil until she explodes at the end. She looks awesome in the stageshow finale.

(Unfortunately our theater stopped showing it after the VHS tape came out.)  The amazing thing about seeing people act out the parts perfectly in the theater was knowing they learned it by going to the theater every week...not by practicing the parts at home.

Now on to the transfer: Someone commented about the sound being remixed.  What they didn't realize is that the stereo AND mono mixes are available on this disc, which is wonderful.  Most theaters show the mono version, yet the stereo remix used to be the only thing available on VHS (unless you had the Japanese import...).  And the live clips and audience participation aren't as bad as I thought they would be (that participation album is embarrassing!).

The actual sound fidelity is MUCH better on my hi-fi VHS tape though, although there *could* be something set wrong on the stereo downmix on the DVD players I've used (though I've used more than one and have fiddled with them all, and have tried both the mono and stereo versions).

493006,5,6302637899,"I happen to have seen the original theatrical show in London in the 1970s before ever discovering the film, on VHS first and then on DVD. This is indispensible to understand the new dimension given to the show on this medium, a filmed show on DVD.

The show itself is a myth and the plot is known by heart. Some Extra-Terrestrials came on Earth with their spacecraft in the shape of an old medieval castle that is in fact a laboratory. The master of the place is Dr Frank-N-Furter and he is a re-composition of the never decomposed or decomposing Dr Frankenstein. He studies one emotion known as lust and being an extra-terrestrial he knows no limits.

A young couple going on a trip to visit a professor of theirs, Dr Everett V. Scott as a sort of celebration of their engagement have a car breakdown in the night in a fierce storm. They decide to knock at the door of the castle they see and they get into the ET lab. After many incidents, detours and other adventures in this labyrinthine castle, they will both be initiated to sex by and with Dr Frank-N-Furter. But Dr Everett V. Scott arrives in a wheelchair and kind of saves the situation by explaining us and them what it is all about. At this time the main servants of the castle/spacecraft decide to go back to their planet Transylvania leaving behind Dr Frank-N-Furter dead but his creation Rocky Horror runs after his body and takes it away: he is in love with his maker and he is immune against the laser weapons of the ETs.

The three humans, Dr Everett V. Scott, Brad Majors and Janet Weiss manage to get out of the castle before take off and end up the show in the mud. Brad concludes that ""inside he is still bleeding"", Janet that ""the beast is still feeding"", and the storyteller that ""on earth some insects call the human race lost in time, lost in space and the meaning.""

The show was not erotic but sexy. The film is the same sexy but not erotic. Yet it is a comedy that plays on sexually ambiguous situations, on words tremendously and on all kinds of strange costumes, effects, lightings, music. The proportion of music, singing and dancing is enormous. It is an entertaining story with a slightly titillating content.

Now the DVD, which is the film, made and still makes this play a success beyond the theatres where it was performed.

Apart from the opening wedding scene the whole film systematically keeps a distance from real cinema. It is not a play per se, far from it, but it is not a film either. It is somewhere in-between the two and that's the interest of the film itself over the play.

The first element that is obvious is the filming on location for outside scenes and when it is filmed in a studio the set is that of an extremely vast castle, at least that's what they want us to believe and that vastness is emphasized by the long ""travelling"" of Dr Everett V. Scott in his wheelchair to come to, or be brought to the laboratory. But there are some other scenes that amplify this vast dimension; The action itself takes place in various rooms and these rooms are big and large enough to entertain a dancing body of twenty people or so. You cannot get that effect on a stage. Including several motorcycles and cars, one motorcycle in the main room of the castle too, running and smoking.

The special effects are numerous and all add something to what a stage play would be. Sound and visual effects create the storm and the suspense necessary for the evocation of fear and danger. But there are other special effects that are more subtle and less visible. Yet without them many scenes would be flat. The main visible element in that line is the constantly changing camera shooting angle and probably camera too, and the editing that emphasizes this whirling effect by cutting and pasting small sequences one after the other of the same scene all from different angles. Then you have a lot of smoke, artefacts of all sports, the apparition of a swimming pool where you had not seen it, the falling down of the radio tower of the RKO Radio Picture logo when Rocky Horror and Dr Frank-N-Furter try to climb on it to escape Riff Raff and his sister Magenta, the ET masters of the spacecraft.

Of course we must also think of the special effects needed to turn someone who is dressed into an entirely nude stone statue. That is both special effect and editing. And there are many instances present giving to the film a speed that it could not have on a stage and at the same time an intensity of action and peripeteia that would also be difficult on the stage.

Finally along that line the use of TV screens to put people under surveillance is possible and frequent in the film because of the close-up shots on them that enable us to see what is on the screen, like for example Brad being sexually served by Dr Frank-N-Furter, which Janet will eventually see on the screen, though after the act itself. The film enables us to see these moments which would have been awkward on the stage, or plainly invisible.

The last remarkable element that the DVD and film provides is the storyteller, called in the credits the criminologist, in a private library in a completely different place and atmosphere. That trick is rarely used in films, certainly not that often, at least eight times in the present case. He explains and creates a perspective, which forces us to listen and think a little bit to understand the craziness of the situation.

That provides us with an important question about this film-DVD. The spectator is no longer confronted to a frontal and unmoving picture, but to a fast changing whirling visual spectacle. The music and the singing make it auditory too and the songs have to be understood, which means sung in a certain way which is easier on the screen than on stage since there is no distance between the actor and the mike in the post-production studio. The words are extremely important in the rhyming patterns, the rhythmic patterns and all types of other linguistic means used to give allure, speed, whirling force to the language and that has to charm our ears as well as the visual show charms our eyes.

But at once these words imply a strong effort on our side to enjoy the meaning and there it also implies and requires a certain mental reflective distance on our side. Actually the fun of the situations and language demands that mental reflective distance. This is a common point between a stage production and a film. The original point here is that it is carried by the language as much as by the medium. Constantly the scenes keep such a distance from realistic action, even that of a cinematographic comedy. The acting, the speaking and the singing keep the film close to a stage production.

At the same time the film-DVD contains an appeal on the audience's side to project themselves into the film, into the action, and in a way to identify with some of the characters, though the identification cannot be with one character only because of the numerous ambiguous situations. But we can identify with Rocky Horror when he mourns his ""father"". We can identify with Janet and Brad when they accept sex from Dr Frank-N-Furter provided he does not tell the other: let's keep our lusty episodes for our own selves. We all have done that in life for numerous things and on numerous occasions. Secrets are the keys to peace at times between partners of any type.

Of course the main value of this DVD is the technical side of it. It can reach the whole world since it provides a great number of subtitles, ten languages plus English for the hearing impaired on the Zone 2 edition I have. And that is just the point. A musical in a theatre is always for a geographical and social elite, whereas a DVD for 3 or 4 euros or pounds is an affordable treat for everyone who understands English in the world and for everyone who speaks one of the languages provided by the subtitles. The DVD more than the VHS tape is a real revolution in the circulation, distribution and even exploitation of theatrical plays, musicals and operas, stage productions in one word including concerts.

Also, the words are silenced at ""Oh brad"" (as in when they also say janet), ""Creature of the night"" (all the characters except rocky at the end) Riff Raff's dazzling ""it's all over"" song thingy, and the music at the beginning of the floor show (as frank is prepping the performers) is lowered significantly.
Each Rocky Horror video has it's own charm, everything in a certain place.  The 25th anniversary, for example, has the two songs that were cut.  As for the dvd's, the basic grey covered one I've noticed is exactly the same as disc one of the two disc set, so as far as dvd's go, the two disc set is the way to go (although the dvd version of the movie sucks because the audio tracks are different, it just doesnt seem right, but the extras are great)  If you're a newcomer to the Rocky Horror Picture Show, and you need other people to tell you just how great it is, this video is for you (it does include the movie by the way).",1078358400,3,1308,4.380165289256198
493038,5,6302637899,"If you want to see this film, see it first in a theater where audience participation is a must.  Then buy the movie!  The gothic nature of the film creates a comical balance with the all-american-sweethearts (played by Susan Sarandon and Barry Boswick), when a predictable flat tire brings together the characters of the Rocky Horror Picture Show. During the course of one night innocence is lost, sensuality runs amuck, and the dark humor never ends.  From the moment Tim Curry appears in the movie, I knew I would be a fan for life.  Meatloaf also has his brief moment to shine in this dark comedy.  There is a narrator, so no viewers can loose site of the plot, and some lively costume undressing.  There is a sci-fi undertone, several sloppy choreographed scenes (which play terribly well in this gothic toned movie), and even a dance you are sure to learn and use at your next theater viewing to impress friends that are virgins to the knowledge of this film.
On my second visit to a theater showing, I was fortunate enough to win a collectors item poster of the film.  Though this was the icing on the cake, I later found that my enthusiasm for the Rocky Horror Picture Show was shared with many, making this movie a cult classic.
If you like this film, I reccommend Velvet Goldmine, Hedwig and the Angry Inch, and Trainspotting.",1075766400,,1335,4.6075949367088604

If you have never seen it, and decide to watch the DVD in the privacy of your own home - I can almost guarantee you to hate it, hence the reason why many have given it a 1-star rating. It is a total B-Movie, and failed in 7 of the 8 theaters it premiered.
HOWEVER if you open your mind to some good fun, find out where the midnight movies play in your neighborhood and check out the RHPS as it is meant...  You are guaranteed a good time and would rate this movie 5 STARS!!
I really don't know how to explain it any clearer.  It is a combination of film, live theater, audience participation and dancing in the aisles all in one!  You can't get ANY of this from the DVD, and you wouldn't understand it from the DVD if you didn't see it in the theater.  No need to be so intimidated when you see everyone dressed as his or her favorite character - I've never attended dressed up.  Remember this movie has been popular for 30 years... I saw it with my uncle, and can't wait to take my own kids when they are old enough (rated R).
As for the stars, yes there is Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, MeatLoaf, and Charles Gray.  Yes they were all relatively unknown at the time this was released, and yes many of them have tried to distance themselves from the project since its release.  You would too... unless you fell under the spell of this cult-classic!

The cult status is almost sickening.  Just look at the negative votes on the one-star reviews, no matter how well-written they are.

A monstrous creation brought to life by genius Richard O'Brian, this movie is a decadent amalgamation of sex, science fiction, and horror. Don't worry about the R-rating, kiddies; ""Rocky Horror"" is one of the few provacative pictures that doesn't stretch across the borders of bad taste.  And of course, the film has become even more incredible thanks to its infamous audience participation.

Shades of Warhol and other B-movie horrors of the past abound, as Rocky Horror draws from everything and anything to bring you into its realm.  It flopped in its first cinema release, but thankfully was revived as a midnight movie classic and now verges on its 30th anniversary. Hard to believe.  Susan Sarandon never looked so good.  Neither did Tim Curry.  This DVD is handsomely packaged and destined to be a collector's item.

493093,1,6302637899,"First off, I am not adverse to the bizarre, the freakish, the twisted, or the outlandish, or even the gender-indenty-problem-ish. As proof, I offer that I will soon own MEET THE FEEBLES.
What can I say about this movie? Maybe a lot of people lost their virginity to it at a drive-in. It's the obly explanation I can offer as to why such a huge cult following is attracted to such a cheap, inane, boring, unamusing piece of garbage that goes by the name THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW.
Weird doesn't even begin to describe how far beyond norm this is, but I do not hold that against it, in and of itself.
What I do have against this movie is that, quite simply, it isn't interesting or funny. Tim Curry's performance and the parade of oddities, while certainly shocking, are not amusing, entertaining or funny by any fathomable means and do not serve any purpose except to simply be messed up for the sake of being messed up. It takes a perverse genieus to make so many outlandish, bizarre things seem so boring.
Imagine the BIG LEBOWSKI, with the dude and Walter replaced by a boy scout and his whiney girlfriend wandering around in a haunted house with freakish things happening, minus the wit, humor, style, and worthiness, and you have some idea of what this film accomplishes on levels of stupidity and pure badness.
I offer the musical numbers as an example. ""I'm a sweet transvestite, from Transsexual, Transylvania."" What part of that is supposed to be amusing? Beside the fact that has no wit or subtlety, its also juvenile and immature. If there had been something interesting going on with the transsexual theme, it might be fun, but it's simply THERE, and we're supposed to be amused by it, as if the fact that transsexuality EXISTS is funny in and of itself.
I am aware that film has ahuge cult following. I must defend myself from them. I suppose if I liked the film I can imagine what my positive review would be. But I did not like the film a bit.  The viewing experience it offered probably accounts for a great number of those who value this movie for the nostalgia it offers rather than its content, but as for the rest, I just don't know what to say. Maybe I'm missing something. Maybe there is some greater, ingenieus satirical concept buried beneath this freak show of musical numbers and sex ""jokes"", but it'll be a cold day in he1l before I ever, under any circumstances, use my valuable time on this planet to search for it.",1056153600,38,2447,4.54875283446712
493094,5,6302637899,"Rocky Horror Picture Show, a cult classic that has remained a favorite for over 28 years. Dedicated fans still flock to the theatre each Friday and Saturday night dressed as their favorite transsexual. Perhaps it the music and the excitement, perhaps it is that erotica and utter sexuality that seems to exude from each and every cast member. Whatever draws us to Rocky Horror, it has kept us coming back again and again. This film defines decadence, and I think that for millions of people the movie represents the ghost of an entire era. Years ago RHPS was home to a group of virtually homeless people who, at the time, were not accepted by society. Out in today's world if you walk around wearing almost gothic-like makeup and 7 inch stilettos people are most likely to take one look at you and automatically make a false judgement. Whereas, at Rocky Horror, people are most likely to take one look at you and automatically make a judgement if you AREN'T wearing outrageous makeup, racy laungerie, and stilettos. It's both ironic and intriguing, and the thought of theatre virgins getting initiated at their first RHPS viewing always gives me a kick.
 For close to two hours the audience becomes the innocent and naive Brad and Janet, and we allow ourselves to partake in the forbidden fruit that is Rocky Horror. A combination of glamour, sex, eccentricity, and hidden meaning is combined altogether to create the story line. If you were to search for a moral hidden in this movie, you would find it during the floorshow scene, where a large portion of the cast starts swimming in a large pool, continually singing: Don't dream it, be it.' This expresses the whole purpose and meaning of the movie. Many people in today's society have fantasies (sexual and nonsexual), but are too afraid to act them out. What makes the characters in RHPS differ from us is the fact that they are not afraid to act out all of their perverse fantasies. They are comfortable with themselves and have no shame, much unlike us (the audience). Also, take notice of the expression, 'Rose tints my world, keeps me safe from my trouble and pain.' Each character repeats this after singing a verse at the floorshow. Perhaps Richard O'Brien was trying to portray to us how everyone has something that they use for comfort, some kind of distraction that keeps them going on when times get hard. At the very end of the movie, the narrator says: 'And crawling on the planet's face, some insects called the human race. Lost in time, lost in space, and meaning.' I believe he is saying that yes, we humans are lost in meaning. We have lost sight of what life is all about, having fun and experiencing it to the fullest extent. Whereas, the transsylvanians have not, because they are enjoying themselves and ignoring all consequence and all rationality. They just do what they do and to hell with what others think, and isn't that the way it should be?
To the untrained eye RHPS appears to be a mindless, immature movie that makes no sense. Those who say that have obviously not looked deep enough into this film. Also, you can't enjoy the movie to its full extent if you take it too seriously. Let yourself go, and have fun with it. That is truly what Rocky Horror Picture Show is all about. Whether you view this timeless story at a theatre, at home, or at a play, you are sure to leave wanting more.
RHPS is neverending, and years and years from now millions will still be viewing it. Any true RHPS fan will tell you that it is our absolute duty to keep the spirit of Rocky alive and to be sure that it is not forgotten, no matter how long it has already been around. There are rumors of a RHPS remake with a new cast. We must protest this and boycott this!!! Rocky just isn't Rocky without Richard, Patricia, Little Nell, etc, and most of all...TIM CURRY! He not only portrayed Frank as dangerous and manipulative, but he made him sensual and completely irrisistable as well. Frank N. Furter is that guy that you know you shouldn't indulge in...but you really, really want to, despite your better judgement.
Without Tim, RHPS would never have made it, and whether you're a fan of Rocky or of Tim or of both, we owe it to him to make sure that it is the movie with the ORIGINAL cast playing every Saturday night, not the new one.
This movie is not just a movie...it is an unstoppable force and it has a true life of its own. 50 years from now (as long as I age well) I'll still be dressing up in my tattered fishnets and ghoulishly seductive makeup, parading down the street to the theatre for yet another night of mindless fun and dancing and laughing, reciting each and every word of Audience Participation and each and every word of the original script...which is memorized easily if you've watched the movie or seen it in public over a hundred times (like me, lol).
Those of you reading this review who have never seen RHPS will think that I'm an obsessive lunatic. However, those of you reading this interview that are true Rocky fans are probably nodding your head and agreeing with every word that I am saying right now ...

493097,5,6302637899,"I loved going to ""Rocky Horror"" when I was in college, but watching on home video just wasn't the same.  I'm probably committing heresy but there's a reason why this sci-fi, horror, B-movie satire, rock musical didn't really make it big until theaters started showing it as a midnight movie and fans started attending in costume and talking back to the screen.  The 25th anniversary DVD, with several audience participation options, really is the next best thing to being there.
For the uninitiated, ""Rocky Horror"" tells the story of two clean-cut American youths, uptight Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick of ""Spin City"") and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon of ""Dead Man Walking"") whose car breaks down on a dark, deserted road in the middle of a storm--the classic beginning to many horror movies--and who seek help at a nearby castle.  Castles, as Rocky fans know, don't have phones!  What this castle has instead is a cross-dressing mad scientist Frank-N-Furter Tim Curry, in perhaps his finest performance), two very creepy servants, Riff-Raff (Richard O'Brien, who wrote the musical) and Magenta (Patricia Quinn), and various other hangers-on, including lovers Columbia (Little Nell) and biker Eddie (Meat Loaf).  Brad and Janet walk in on a party celebrating the creation of Frank-N-Furter's muscle-bound boy-toy ""Rocky.""  Bed-hopping chaos soon ensues, until the servants reveal their true identities and take control.
Punctuating this wacky plot are some of the wildest rock-musical songs ever written.  In addition to the classic ""Time Warp,"" there's O'Brien's salute to cult-classic B-movies, ""Science Fiction Double Feature,"" Meat Loaf's ""Hot Patootie,"" and Sarandon ode to sexual self-discovery, ""Toucha Toucha Touch Me!""
So much for the ""Rocky virgin"" portion of the review...  What makes the DVD so exceptional is the chance to experience ""Rocky Horror"" at home nearly like you would in the theater.  The DVD has the option of turning on the audience screen comments as well as another option for viewing members of the Rocky Horror Fan Club performing select scenes before returning to the main movie.  For those less familiar with audience participation, the DVD can prompt when to throw toast, toilet paper, rice, etc., light a match, put your newspaper on your head, etc.
The second disc contains fascinating interviews with cast members, where fans can find out about their reaction to starring in this cult classic.  Meat Loaf's description of not realizing what ""Rocky Horror"" was going to be about and running out of the theater when Tim Curry entered wearing fishnet stockings, spiked heels, a merry widow, and a leather jacket and singing ""Sweet Transvestite"" is hysterical.  Patricia Quinn talks about how her fondness for the opening song, ""Science Fiction Double Feature"" made her want to take the role even though she hadn't read the rest of the script.  What?  Don't remember Quinn singing that number?  In the stage versions she did, but the song got reassigned in the film version--and Quinn makes her feelings about that QUITE clear.  Sarandon makes the interesting observation that ""Rocky Horror"" probably kept a lot of art house theaters in business over the years, since they could count on good revenue from the midnight movie, even if the latest regular-hours offering flopped.  In Bostwick's interview, however, the actor sounds a bit like William Shatner giving his anti-Trekkie diatribe on ""Saturday Night Live.""
The only disappointments on the DVD are that the outtakes really aren't that interesting and actor bios aren't provided.  I would have liked to see what else the ""minor"" cast members did after Rocky, but that information is limited to a few lines in the companion booklet.  Also, some of the audience-participation comments are nearly impossible to understand because fans are talking over each other.  But then that's part of the modern-day theater experience.  Even Sarandon noted in her interview that talking back to the screen has gone from the more unison catechism approach to a loud free-for-all.
What seemed so risqu and shocking a few decades ago seems much more innocent today, but it was great when it all began and it's still great!  If you've never ventured into the theater to experience ""Rocky Horror,"" this is the best way to experience it at home.",1052784000,301,4309,5.1697841726618705

493115,5,6302637899,"""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" is one of the best cult classics of it's time.
Originally this movie started out at a play over in Europe staring a small cast of characters and a very dedicated audience..  Then one day the play director (you will see him as rif raff) decided that he wanted to pass this truelly magnificient gift on to others.. Thus was born ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show""..  When it first came out it bombed badly.. So Bad that it was taken out of the theatres faster then it was placed in them..
Then one night a group of people went to a theatre manager and asked that Rocky be played at midnight.. and WHAM!!  The craze was born.. and the shows went on..,.
What is all the excitement you ask?  Simple.. this movie is a fun spoof on all those olde sci-fi movies that featured outerspace creatures, sex, and strange going on's.. With the excitment of a full broadway musical with such songs as ""Dammit Janet"", ""Time Warp"", ""Sweet Transvestite"" and many many many more songs that lend to the whole ambience of the film..
The acting is not the best but, is carried of quite well by Tim Curry (Dr. Frank-N-Furter), and Susan Sherandon (Janet)..
And if you are trying to find the best version of the film to get make sure you get the ones that feature the deleted scenes and the alternate endings.. You will wonder why they ever took them out..",1036108800,2,1356,4.455645161290323
493116,5,6302637899,"From absolute disaster to international success, few titles have had the roller-coaster ride of THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW.  Originally a low-budget English stage show, it exploded into mainstream popularity and became one of London's longest running musicals--but then died a quick and very painful death in New York.  As an afterthought, the American company played a limited engagement in Los Angeles and once more the show was a smash hit and soon became a motion picture--which received mixed reviews and proved a box office dud.  That probably would have been the end of it, but the film suddenly and unexpectedly emerged as a cult movie phenomena and ascended to international acclaim.
The story is well known.  All-American Brad Majors and Janet Weiss become engaged and rush to tell their mentor, Dr. Everett Scott.  But they take a wrong turn, have a flat, and suddenly find themselves captives of a bisexual transvestite from outer space who is intent on making the perfect boy-toy lover from scratch.  Although the material was considerably softened for the screen, even today it remains surprisingly sharp, and the film contains numerous references to the classic Hollywood horror films that inspired it.  The cast, most of whom played in the stage versions, is truly astonishing.  Tim Curry was little known when the film was made, but he shows tremendous talent in the role of Dr. Frank N. Furter, the bisexual transvestite from outer space; his performance is a remarkable combination of broad farce, sensuality, and dark wit.  While Curry is certainly the show's centerpiece, the rest of the cast is equally effective.  Both Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon are beautifully cast as the goody-goody Brad and Janet; Richard O'Brien (who wrote the stage show), Patricia Quinn, Little Nell, and Meatloaf all give memorable turns as the mad doctor's bizarre associates; and character actors Johnathan Adams and Charles Gray offer considerable drop-dead wit in supporting roles.  Only Peter Hinwood seems out of his league, selected more for looks than talent--but strange to say, this actually works in the context of the film.
If you've only seen this film at an audience-participation showing, you're in for a surprise: THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW is wickedly funny, something you're likely to miss when every one in the audience is screaming at the screen.  Although the material was toned down for the movie--song sequences were rearranged, lyrics rewritten, and script and characters softened--the whole thing still has plenty of bite.  The story, of course, is intrinsically subversive; the script has a uniquely British sensibility; and the songs are catchy, bouncy, and frequently have lyrics that are very clever in an underhanded sort of way.  This double DVD release offers two versions of the film: the American release and the British, the latter of which is slightly different and includes the song ""Superheroes.""  It also includes a version that offers ""prompts"" for audience participation and a version that shows the audience in action.  There are also a mixed bag of videos, interviews, and the like.  I was not greatly impressed with the bonus package--it seemed to me that it was all pretty obvious stuff--but most fans will find something to enjoy.  Whatever the case, THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW has a lot more going for it than cult status; it's a good film in its own right.  Recommended.",1035763200,16,3432,5.129263913824057

FOX is quickly putting their special edition DVDs out of print, and already they've begun to replace this excellent 2-disc set with a much less impressive, plain vanilla 1-disc.

Rocky Horror Picture Show is truly senseless, but still one of the best I've seen. Mr. Tim Curry does an excellent job. His unique accent and some of his various gestures really gives his character a boost. I must admit that they cast the part of Frank-n-Furter perfectly when they chose him. Knowing how Susan Sarandon is today, I could hardly picture someone as uptight as her walking around in her ""unmentionables"" and playing such a off-key part. I barely recognized Barry Boswick, for I am so used to seeing him in Spin City, several Lifetime movies, etc. The one and only complaint I have for the movie is that from what I hear, when performed in a theatre, the character of rocky horror is much more masculine looking. I mean, I know he was supposed to look like a transexual, but the actor who played Rocky appeared so scrawny, sure he had muscle, but still scrawny. But nonetheless, this itself does not take away from this timeless film. The songs are wonderful, days after I watch the film I still find myself humming ""toucha toucha touch me,"" ""fanfare/don't dream it,"" or even "" eddy's teddy."" All together I believe this movie is a must see. Ignore some of the more negative things you've heard about it and give it a try.

There is a definite reason that this became a huge cult classic and still fills a theatre house with the faithful several times each week in many parts of the country.  (and here's a little clue) It's NOT the tightly plotted script or the quality of the acting.
I adore this very silly movie and regularly sing along with the songs, call out the best lines of dialog with the actors.  I do however refrain from toasting bread (""a toast!"") and refuse to shout the more vulgar insults that my kids told me about from their theatre days.

The extras on here are really cool. The cast, the crew and especially the director take you behind the scenes on how it all came together. There is even a very funny tell-all with Susan Sarandon and Meatlaof. It seems no one knew what they were making and no one knew what a cult phenomenon it would be.
The menus are hysterical and the pop up video is also very funny. There are two version of the film on this set one for the American release and one for the UK The Brits are a bit freer. However, in listening to the commentary from the British actors the audience are much more intense and ""mad"" then they are in Europe. You want to see men in drag, toast flying through the air and people screaming at the movie? Go to a late night showing of Rocky.
This DVD is a good piece of history in regards to cult films in general but its worth it just to watch Barry Botswick and Tim Curry - pair it off in fish net stockings and 6 inch heals!

Richard O'Brien, a talented and charismatic man, does some classy busking in the special features and then sits down to do some risible character analysis on his creations, a sign that the whole cult thing has got out of hand. Barry Bostwick claims that he was already jaded before joining the cast. Well, thank you kindly, Bazza, for taking the time and trouble to fly over from the big apple to show us backward Brits how to walk on the wild side. We is so grateful, Massa. Hope our little country ways didn't bore you too much. He then goes on to more or less tell 'Rocky' fans to get a life. His pomposity is worthy of Brad himself. Patricia Quinn is not what you expect, either. One of those loud, pretentious lovey types that appear to be teetering on the brink of desperation. Maybe she's always like that. Curry appears only on stage at the anniversary bash and looks distinctly uncomfortable at his rock star celebrity. Meat Loaf is unexpectedly funny but his motorbike stunt double story is not as scintilating as he clearly believes it is. Susan Sarandon looks amazing crawling through the smoke at the end of the film. Her interview also runs on too long but she comes across as a game lady.

A strong collection of songs from maestro Richard O'Brien drives this Gothic masterpiece, concerning the misadventures of (Damn it) Janet Weiss, played by the ravishing Susan Sarandon and her RoboNerd boyfriend Brad Majors, played by Barry Bostwick.

Frank looked extra glamorous with the enhanced picture. And widescreen is always good! My complaint is with these so-called special features. When I see the word ""out-takes"" I'm thinking some funny scenes where Tim Curry trips on his high heels or something like that. But really, the outtakes are little more than film from unused camera angles. The stuff from VH-1 Behind the Music was interesting enough, but it was nothing new. VH-1 runs Rocky Horror almost monthly, along with the Behind the Music stuff. And the theatrical experience, I think, should remain IN THE THEATER. That's the whole point of audience participation. It's not enjoying it in your living room, it's enjoying it with a whole room FULL of whackos. The cut-scenes were interesting. But that was the only special feature that I really found to be ""special."" So, all in all, the movie is an excellent addition to your library.

The whole point of the Rocky Horror phenomenon was the participatory role of the audience, not the movie, which is as much of a period piece as the movies it attempts to send up.  The extra disc in this set includes a lengthy, turgid, humorless documentary about the making of the play and the movie, with interviews of the director, writer, producer, and various actors--practically everyone associated with the show except the most important contributors--the audiences whose ""appearances"" in the production easily exceeded those of the actual performers.
We are unlikely to witness anything like the Rocky Horror cult phenomenon again.  In Western theater as well as mainstream movies the role of the audience is generally passive, isolated, private and voyeuristic.  Only in the Dionysian theater of ancient Greece or the cult rituals described by Antonin Artaud in ""Theater and Its Double"" do we learn about a kind of theater that amounted to a communal celebration of the daemonic, a liturgical worship with the audience as active celebrants.  But ""Rocky Horror"" rewrote the rules or, perhaps more accurately, the audiences themselves invented a new form of movie, in effect ""producing"" the 20-year-run of a happening known, for lack of a better title, as the ""Rocky Horror Picture Show.""
Throw away the documentary disc and set the movie's alternate sound track to ""audience,"" easily the feature that makes the DVD the one to own rather than the VHS version.

Dammit Janet, The Time Warp, Sweet Transvestite, Hot Patootie, Eddie, and, of course, the solo of those mesmerizing lips in Science Fiction Double Feature are all beautiful!
This DVD truly does the film justice!  The lips greet you at the menu, quoting the movie throughout, and a pair of disembodied, fishnet-clad legs dance around while you make your selections.  The film is presented in widescreen format only, but you have the option of viewing the film with the traditional mono soundtrack or the remixed dolby 5.1 soundtrack.  You also have the option of viewing the US version or the UK version, the only difference being that the UK version contains the Superheroes musical number, which was removed from the US version because it was considered too much of a ""downer.""  There's also a commentary track by Richard O'Brien and Patricia Quinn, an audience participation track, (which is quite funny when you can understand it) a ""multi-view theater experience"" which allows you to view people performing along with musical numbers at showings of the RHPS, and too many other special features to mention!!!!!!
Buy this DVD if you like the Rocky Horror Picture Show!  Don't buy it if you hate the movie or are a homophobe. (in which case, trust me, this movie will creep the hell out of you!)
Pros:
+Great movie
+excellent sound and video quality
+inclusion of UK version
+buttload of extra features

-Not for everyone

Transvestitism is a little less than humorous, and a lot less than humourous when it is the only joke.  Not that I have a problem with transvestites.  Indeed, anybody who decides that being male is not good enough to display publicly dramatically increases the likelihood that a homophobic man will forcibly remove his genitals.  ...  So, transvestites are good.  However, this movie isn't.

493223,5,6302637899,"""I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey."" To describe The Rocky Horror Picture Show as ""a strange journey"" is putting it mildly; RHPS is a full-on cinematic adventure blending comedy, raunchiness, science fiction, and addictive musical numbers. While not as shocking to today's audiences as it must have been to its first viewers in the 1970s, RHPS still packs in plenty of sex, laughs, and rock 'n' roll.
RHPS has something for everyone.  Who can resist a movie starring Tim Curry as a sweet transvestite from Transexual, Transylvania who creates lovers during his spare time like an erotic Dr. Frankenstein? Can anyone keep himself/herself from dancing the Time Warp or singing along to such show-stopping musical hits like ""Toucha-Toucha-Toucha Touch Me,"" ""Damnit Janet,"" and ""Hot Patootie?"" For ladies like myself, this movie contains a wonderfully muscular stud named Rocky clad only in a little gold speedo and matching boots. For the men, a very young Susan Sarandon parades around in her bra and undies. Toss in a hilariously nonsensical plot, plenty of places for audience participation, memorable catch phrases, and a cameo by Meatloaf... Who could ask for more?
The 25th Anniversary DVD contains plenty of extras that any RHPS fan will love. You get interviews, different movie viewing options, an awesome screensaver, and more. Don't forget to search for the hidden ""easter eggs"" on this 2-disc set. You'll love this movie, and be prepared to buy the original soundtrack!",1000771200,,1501,5.1016260162601625

Anyway incase people don't know by now this movie has been playing for over 25 years in theaters ever friday and saturday night at midnight and has become a nation wide cult phenomena. It has comedy, horror, sex, music, sci fi and rock and roll. what else could you ask for in one night?

What gets me the most about this movie is that immediately after watching it I couldn't get the songs out of my head.  After watching this you will be humming or singing these songs for days after.
The songs are amazing, Richard O'Brien is a pure genius to have come up with the lyrics for them, and they are still fresh after 25 years even.  The sets are something to be seen and the story is very smart and the lines are delivered with enthusiasm.  Still on the topic of songs, when I first saw this movie I thought that the singing voices were not those of the actors, but I was amazed to learn that it was the actors real voices that I was hearing.  All the characters are ones that people can relate to.  For instance I related to Riff-Raff the often put-dowm servant to Dr. Frank 'n' furter.

The set is beautifully put together, filled with gorgeous full-color artwork and put together quite creatively.  To be totally honest, I loved this set before I even go to my DVD player.  When I did, I was in heaven.  The picture quality is amazing, so good that I was able to see things that I had never been able to see on my videos.  To get and idea what I mean, I always thought that Brad's tuxedo jacket was lined with black material, but on the DVD I could clearly see that it is maroon!  Then I got to the sound.  The new stereo mix is breathtaking when listened to through a powerful home theater system, but perhaps the best treat is the restoration of the original mono soundtrack that has been MIA for so long (since 1990).  It was wonderful being able to hear every single sound effect that had been missing from the older stereo mixes.  Also included are an interesting commentary by Pat Quinn and Richard O'Brien, a hilarious audience participation track..., and a very fun ""theatrical experience"" which cuts in footage from actual screenings.  I was totally in love with this DVD before I had even gotten to the second disc.  This disc is jammed full of fun extras.  It includes the movie version of ""Once In A While"" as an outtake.  Also there are excepts from interviews with many of the stars of the film, the VH1 specials about RHPS, and a documentary that until now was only available on the laserdisc.  The movie itself is one of my all time favorites.  The performances are incredible, my favorite being Tim Curry as the irresistible Dr. Frank N. Furter.  He just oozes sexuality into the role and commands every bit of your attention.  Richard O'Brien is delightfully creepy as Riff Raff, Frank's unpredictable servant.  Pat Quinn is very seductive in the part of Magenta, Riff's sister/lover.  Nell Campbell is perfectly sparkly and squeaky in the role of supergroupie Columbia.  Barry Bostwick is one of my favorite Brad's... Peter Hinwood is just fun to look at as Rocky, considering that there isn't very much more to his role.  Susan Sarandon is probably the least talented member of the cast which really says something about the cast when you consider that she is an Academy Award winner.  Her acting as straightlaced Janet is perfect, the only downside is her voice,...Meat Loaf makes an electrifying cameo as greaser Eddie, who shows up a second time in quite an unexpected way.  Jonathan Adams is a pretty good Dr. Scott.  The plot is very unusual, but it is a lot of fun.  The music is amazing, even though the arrangements aren't the best...This is just an awesome movie that never feels dated and is never boring no matter how many times you have seen it.  I strongly believe that everyone should see it at least once, and for those like me who have seen far more times than that, this DVD is a must have.",990489600,4,2983,4.549718574108818

I really do like this DVD, but I would actually only recommend it to people who have never seen the movie before. I will explain. As everyone knows, the thing about ""Rocky Horror"" is the audience participation. If you just watch the movie by yourself in your living room, it is fun, but not as fun as hearing people shout witticisms at the screen. With this DVD you can watch the movie by yourself, and take in all the madness..but you can also experience the live aspect with the feature that allows you to hear the callbacks and see a live ""Rocky"" cast performing. I think that's an excellent and necessary feature of a DVD version of such a film.
Now, purists such as myself might be a little disappointed at this DVD. The ""hilarious outtakes"" and such are not different than those which were featured on the 20th Anniversary laserdisc. It kinda nullifies having to buy the DVD, but if you really really want to, it's not a bad idea. Hearing Richard O'Brien and Patricia Quinn's (Riff-Raff and Magenta, respectively) running commentary is worth the price of admission, so go ahead and splurge. :)",974419200,7,1370,4.618852459016393

Disc 2 contains deleted musical scenes (""Superheroes"" & ""Once in a While""), alternate takes, documentaries, sing-alongs, and more.  If you're a fan of ROCKY HORROR, this is a DVD you can't be without.  Frank's throwing one of his affairs, so why don't you some up to the lab and see what's on the slab?",974246400,,737,4.7265625

Why anyone likes it is beyond me,my wife does and she asked me to watch it with her and I tried... I really did,but after about 10 minutes I was shouting at the screen and I don't think it was what I was supposed to be shouting either so she asked me to leave which I did, gladly. I have this annoying thing I do called ""Thinking"" and the more I thought about this movie the more I hated it. The plot (if it has one,I couldn't find it) is a joke, the acting stupid,and it has a good cast too Curry,Sarandon,Meat Loaf. Honestly,whoever made this owes his cast an apology. As I watched this I couldn't help but think we are deep in ""Student Film""country here. If you like a ""good movie"" as this piece of garbage is so often mistakenly called,rent ""Star Wars""either one of them,they are the definition of ""Good Movies."" definitely avoid this though and mabe it will finally go away.",973814400,8,1016,4.347368421052631

I found this movie is so utterly strange and disorienting at first that it was the strength of the music and the viscerally perverse, hedonistic, smirking glee that kept me coming back. Richard O'Brien often has a knowing grin on his face as if he's certain this whole thing is really going places... even if he didn't know exactly where.
 The Rocky Horror Picture Show, made in 1975 and having the cult status it does, doesn't need me or anyone else to 'review' it at this point. I add my comments here only in an attempt to encourage anyone who didn't like it at first to try again. Once it begins to click, you will find it an amazing example of the whole being far greater than the sum of the parts.",973555200,3,787,4.281879194630872
493279,5,6302637899,"The following is a review of the DVD re-release of the RHPS:
This review is easy.  This is the best money I have spent on any DVD.  Ever.
And, this is the best money I've spent on ANYTHING in a long time.  However, I'm biased.  I love this film.  If you like the Rocky Horror Picture Show, this is the collection to get.  It isn't just how they put things on the discs, it's WHAT they put on the discs.  These discs won't be known for their menus (although I like them), there are two things that definitely make this collection worth picking up.
First, disc one includes an audio track that let's you hear a theater full of people shouting back at the movie.  That's worth the money right there.  (This is also a great way to learn what to say and when to say it.)  If you don't watch this film in a theater, turn this feature ON.  The second fantastic inclusion is the subtitle track that tells you when to use props.
This collection is extremely affordable, considering what they give you and how much it costs.
The TWO DISCS also include a musical number that this country (the U.S.A.) has NEVER SEEN!  I couldn't wait to see this ""Superheroes"" number edited back into the film.  The ""theater experience"" is a must for this film and since they  brought some of that to the DVD, this film at home is THAT much better.
I've been a fan of this movie for over ten years and I've seen it more times than I care to mention.  These discs really impressed me.  I would HIGHLY recommend this collection to any Rocky Horror Picture Show, Richard O'Brien or musical fan.
From The Back Of The DVD:
""It was great when it all began...""  Celebrate 25 years of midnight movie madness!  The Rocky Horror Picture Show is an ""erotic nightmare beyond any measure.""  Relive Richard O'Brien's sinfully twisted salute to horror, sci-fi, B-movies and rock music - a ""sensual daydream to treasure forever"" - starring Tim Curry (in his classic gender-bending performance), Barry Bostwick, and Oscar winner Susan Sarandon.  Do the ""Time Warp"" and sing ""Hot Patootie"" with Meatloaf again...and again...and again...at home, or in a movie theater, where it will probably be playing for another 25 years!

493280,5,6302637899,"RHPS is not meant to be viewed at home. The original premise of thise film was as a stage act in the jolly land of england. :) Basically its like this. If you sit at home alone in your crampped apartment with your cat and watch this you will hate this. If you invite ten of your friends over and do it at midnight with a bowl of punch and some popcorn trying to get the ""midnight showing"" feel, you will hate this. If you actually go to a local theatre at midnight and open yourself up and just let loose and have a fun time you will enjoy this film. the film is nothing more than a joke. Its not meant of have a good plot or great acting. Its meant to just have some fun. Its basically just one long pleasure cruise.
The fact that most people call this a horror film just shows how wrong of a direction they have taken. Its not a horror film, its not scary or really funny... its just fun. Its funny when you and your friends go and yell naughty things at actors playing in front of a movie screen.
Check this out in your local midnight showing theatre, have some fun with it and don't watch the movie, watch everyone else!
Note: Rocky Horror is that name of the central character (that cute blond in the golden undies!) its NOT, i repeat, NOT supposed to be a horror film. I repeat... repeat.
anyways.... check it out and come up with some funny add in line...",973123200,5,1362,4.143396226415095

But after 25 years  what has this film accomplished 25 years ago Rock Horror  was a almost dead in the water grossing only $3000 in 1975 until it's creators in 1976 gave it a midnight run at a  theatre in New York and after that the rest was history as  Frank N Furter , Janet , Brad , Rocky , and Magenta would  become household names word is the president of Rocky Fan club has seen it more then 2000 times. So what has the Rocky Horror Picture Show done for it's fans after 25 years it  has done what no other B- Buget film has done it has given  it's beloved and devoted fans a way to leave there problems  behind of indiffrences and come together for a film that  gives people all over a world young and old , no matter  what color or sexual prefrence or what sex to come out  and express themselves in a way that no other film could after 25 years if politicans cant make us see the light  maybe this film can hopefully for centurys to come.",972950400,8,1748,4.064327485380117

All the actors were great, really throwing themselves into it, but I think the plot is ridiculous.  I mean, look at the ending!  Also you can't really feel for any of the characters because Janet and Brad are too dumb and goody-goody and everyone else is too weird.  Overall I'd rather watch something with a bit more plot and a bit less sensationalism.  It actually got (shock, horror) BORING after a while.

Some scenes will stick to your memory like glue for years, and when a film can do that and continue to bring a smile to your face, well, you know its good. Tim Curry gives an outrageous performance as a transvestite alien who just happens to sleep with practically EVERYONE in his mansion, including a young, innocent, American couple, Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick. As you can tell, I'm enthusiastic about this movie, though I'm sure not everyone is- some scenes border on just plain indecent.

Having been a fan of the movies since 1981, and having memorized all the soundtrack since the same time, I was very excited to be able to see the deleted ""Superheroes"" number.  The other extra stuff was fun too.  The audience participation audio track was a dream come true.  Sadly, in the past, I actually tried to sinc up the VHS copy and the Audience Participation audio CD.
Having the subtitles with the props was also a nice touch.  I always considered myself a ""props pro"" but I clearly missed out on some of the ""required"" props.
This is a perfect example of what happens when people that Love a film, get together to create a DVD product.  It is truly exceptional.  So many ""old"" movies often have nothing more than a trailer or two added.  Sometimes an audio track is included.  But this had just about every possible added feature you could want.

493291,5,6302637899,"Finally, 20th Century Fox has done a great job of putting The Rocky Horror Picture Show onto video with this amazing DVD.  I don't want to repeat all of the things that everyone else has said in the other reviews, so here is what I liked about this DVD.  This is the first time that the original film audio track has ever been on a video of this movie in the U.S.  It is selectable by choosing 'ENGLISH MONO'.  The 'ENGLISH DOLBY 5.1' audio selection is a brand new stereo digital audio mix, with none of the lazy mistakes that you can hear on the earlier VHS releases.  Of course, because most of the songs on the stereo track have been re-recorded from the soundtrack album (which is a little different in some places), the 'Transylvanians' (during the TIME WARP) sound more like a choir(on the stereo track) than 'munchkins' (on the mono track) like they are supposed to.  But it sounds great.  The only bad thing that I noticed was when you select the U.S. version to watch; Instead of actually using a U.S. print of the film, they just took the U.K. version of the video and cut out the song 'Superheroes'.  In the U.S. Theater release, the music was remixed so that you couldn't tell that anything was missing, but on this video, you can actually hear the start of the 'Superheroes' music and then a drastic change in the audio where it has been removed.  It is okay though, because the actual U.S. Ending with the properly mixed music is on the Second DVD in the menu under 'Alternate Endings'.  The second DVD in the set contains most (if not all) of the bonus material that (I Believe) has only previously been available at the end of the U.K. Widescreen video of the movie.
This DVD is the only video version of the movie that truly captures the film the way it was originally made and should be part of every Rocky Horror fan's video collection.",970790400,6,1856,4.432352941176471

Get it this is something you need to own.,970790400,,343,4.666666666666667
493294,5,6302637899,"The 25th Anniversary VHS release of ""Rocky Horror"" is almost everything any fan could hope for, and certainly the best representation of the film ever delivered to the mass market.  This video was released to coincide with ""Rocky""'s appearance on DVD, and the upgrade in quality is brilliant.  First, the video transfer is stunningly gorgeous.  The vibrantly-colored sets, costumes and makeup fairly leap off the screen.  This is certainly the best I have ever seen ""Rocky"" look, even in the theater, which makes it all the more frustrating that Fox did not see fit to release a widescreen VHS version.  This is, no doubt, a tactic to induce more fans to buy the DVD, as is the absence of even one of the ""extras"" delivered in abundance on the disc.  Come on, Fox, you could at least have stuck a trailer on there or something - or how about the mini-documentary from the original 1990 release, for those who STILL don't know what it's all about?
But no matter - the real excitement here is the music.  Fox was wisely gone back to the original master tapes and re-mixed the entire soundtrack from scratch, in glorious THX stereo.  I hope I will not be accused of exaggeration when I state that ""Rocky"" has never sounded as good as it does now.  Not even the CD sounds this wonderful.  ""Frankenstein Place"" is ghostly and majestic, ""Time Warp"" is stunningly loud, and ""Sweet Transvestite"" has re-gained the sleazy honky-tonk piano lost in the original stereo conversion.  But wait, there's more - the guitar parts have been mixed forward, giving a wonderfully crunchy texture to ""Hot Patootie"" and ""Floor Show.""  Even the much-neglected ""Planet Hot Dog"" reveals funky organ riffs previously lost in the mix.  And, wonder of wonders, the little-seen ""Superheroes"" number has been re-instated at the end.
On the whole, the picture and sound quality of this new ""Rocky Horror"" video puts the previous releases, even the widescreen edition, to shame.  As a fan this is the version I would want a casual viewer to experience.  Highly recommended!",970790400,,2040,4.838616714697406

If you already know the movie and enjoy it, stop reading and buy the thing.  If you have never seen it or are curious to know what all the fuss is about, then buy or rent RHPS. This DVD is an excellent introduction to the whole RHPS phenomenon.  I love this movie and have seen it live twice and listened to the old participation album dozens of times.

493296,5,6302637899,"They really did a top-notch job with this one- the menus alone are awesome with the freaky talking lips making comments.  I haven't even covered everything yet, but from what I've seen it's great.
The commentary is a lot of fun- two of the cast members Richard O Brian (guy who plays Riff-Raff also creator of Rocky Horror) and Patricia Quinn team up with lots of informative and fun information on the making of the film and the extremely tight budget.
The other commentary boosts a real audience's taunts and insults at the screen- like watching Mystery Science Theater without the fun robots..., but most of the yelling is hard to make out, but when you DO hear it's friggen hilarious, especially during the musical numbers where the audience have some cruel verses of their own.  In another feature you can actually watch the audience dancing in the theater and acting out the scenes with a click of the mousepad.  You'll see- I'm trying to make this clear, but there's too many things to mention!
Also have a prompter to cue you if you want to do the audience participation thing.  The documentary is very good- the VH1 interviews are nice and lengthy- I really appreciated the honesty through the cast and how they'll admit that it wasn't THAT pleasant of an experience- a lot of the conditions were barely tolerable.
The outtakes stink- pointless and boring- none of them slightly funny- they're just alternate takes they didn't use...oh well, everything else makes up for it.  There's trivia, only 7 or 8 photos, but no big deal.  Theatrial trailers.  Alternate ending with the cut ""Superheroes"" song...I can see why they cut it, but it's nice to see anyway.  Also another number that ""Brad"" sings, but it's also pointless and boring.  They were smart to keep this stuff out and smart to put it on the dvd.
Spanish subtitles, Anamorphic Widescreen (1.66:1) great sound and pic quality- didn't spot any serious or distracting flaws.
DVD games too, which I haven't quite figured out yet, some trivia, cast filmograpies/biographies, a guide to audience participation, a nifty little Rocky Horror timeline, web links...hmm- probably forgetting something.  The U.K. and U.S. version of the film are here too with the ""Superheroes"" number in the U.K. version...I guess that's it- need I say more?  Great buy- I'm stoked!",970704000,6,2322,4.88295165394402

It was great fun - you sang along to the songs, yelled out key phrases, and in general had a blast without booze or drugs. What more could a parent want?
The movie isn't about sex, although there are skimpy outfits and Frank's seduction of the two innocents. You see far worse in a Ricky Martin video! It's really about satiring the sweet musicals of the 60s, the campy sci-fi movies, and just about anything in between.

Seeing this cult classic on DVD is a dream come true.  There is also a US version with a deleted scene added right into the feature.  There are tons of extras including the different subtitles.  There is reg. english, spanish and 3 ""others"" versions.  Version 1, subtitle 3 on the DVD, cues you to the things to do during the movie, such as snapping rubber gloves, tthrowing the toilet paper, etc.  Version 2, subtitle 4, shows lips at certain points in the movie that, when you press the enter button, you get greeted by Sal Piro, the RHPS fan club president.  He shows clips of audience reations and fans acting out the current scene in a theater.  Cool!  Version 3, subtitle 5, to this point hasn't done anything, but i am sure it does.  All of this plus more is just on the first disc!  Disc 2 contains excerpts and outtakes from the VH-1 special, including interviews with some cast members.

Upon one viewing, I decided that I was too tired  to really watch, so I was going to fast forward through parts of it.  By  the first song, ""Science Fiction Double Feature"", with those big,  red lips up on the screen, I was hooked.  The songs are very catchy, with  funny lyrics that will stay in your head for weeks to come (a mixed  blessing to some).  Tim Curry gives his all as Frank-n-Furter, a  scientist from another planet who has strange parties in the middle of the  night.  This part showcases his great voice, and his over-the-top acting.

Rocky Horror looks and feels like a budget film and the  only piece of music that stands out is the Time Warp, the  reason being, is  that it has more melody than the other numbers. Tommy on the other hand is  full of quality songs sung not only by The Who, but also Elton John and  Tina Turner. But this is the reason why Rocky Horror has become a cult film  because of its lack of sophistication and the attitude towards the older  horror films and Hollywood musicals.
  Despite making fun of Flash  Gordon, King Kong or the earlier Hammer classics we know this is just leg  pulling and not a definite statement that science fiction films are  rubbish. In this film it is obvious that Jim Sharman and Richard O'Brian  really love the Frankensteins and the Esther William's swimming ballets  because although they can see how corny these characters and stars appear  in 1975, the campy acting of the present cast brings out the absurdities of  the older heroes but doesn't belittle them.  A sophisticated  audience can sense this and the public themselves probably made fun of the  plots and overacting of these fantasy films. Maybe over a few pints in the  pub the picturegoer did an impersonation of Boris Karlof or Christopher Lee  and when they heard that Rocky Horror was doing the same thing the grouped  audience maybe felt some camaraderie and it wasn't long before the word  spread and the local flea pit (cinema) became the place to go on Saturday  evenings after the last call ""Time gentlemen please,"" was shouted out by  the publican at 11 P.M..
  The person who becomes a Rocky Horror addict  is the type of individual that also can watch Casablanca countless times,  and fill in all the appropriate punch lines. These people need a sense of  belonging and instead of tearing up the London Underground trains after a  football match on Saturdays then they instead, let go of their inhibitions  by dancing and singing in a Rocky Horror cinema.  Personally I need a few  years break before visiting a film again. Having seen the live version and  comparing it with the film, there is not much difference. Fortunately to  appear in Rocky Horror does not take a genius because any mistakes can be  quietly covered up just by the amateur campy acting.
  The makeup  artist that turned Tim Curry into a really good looking woman is who I  would call the main star in this film. Tim's lips have a dark outline  around the red lipstick area that I don't believe  was in vogue in the  middle seventies, so Doctor Frank-N-Furter was away ahead of his/her time.  Tim Curry looks a lot like Ruby Wax an American interviewer that has her  own show on the BBC, only he looks much better. This transvestite character  doesn't have much of a chest, in fact quite flat and that's not the only  place he is flat, ouch!
  Although this is a ridicule of Hollywood  musicals and horror films, it does have its part in musical film history  because it does include nearly every cliched scene for example the swimming  pool shots, the unbalanced choreography routines, and the Fay Wray Empire  State Building finale'. Unfortunately one has to be experienced, to put it  tactfully, to recognize these classical scenes.",965692800,,3442,4.681208053691275

493340,5,6302637899,"So maybe this isn't exactly award-winning material. So what? ""Rocky Horror"" isn't meant to be some uptight, emotional, stuffy piece; in fact, it  goes out of its way to be just the opposite. It's a satirical  piece that makes plays on corny sci-fi late night flicks, drippy musicals,  and corny Frankenstein-type horror [ex. Doctor Frank N. Furter, for  example?]
 The movie is packed with get-up-and-dance rock tunes,  overdone acting that seems just right, and a wildly ridiculous plot. Tim  Curry is simply brilliant; from his authoriative-yet-plaintive cries of  ""Oh Rocky!"" to his flashy and utterly corny performance of  ""Sweet Transvestite."" The best scene for me is right after he  transduces Janet, Brad, Doctor Scott, Rocky, and Columbia, sighing heavily,  ""It's not easy having fun...even smiling makes my teeth ache..""  before biting his finger in melodramatic anguish. Other good performances  include that of Susan Sarandon, who scores high as the naive and  inexperienced yet curious Janet.
 ""Rocky Horror"" isn't for  everybody. Some may write it off as ""sick"" while others may view  it as pointless. True, it took me a while to realize the whole point of the  movie and piece together bits of the plot for myself, but this movie is all  in good humor. So, to all you people out there who
a) refuse to see  ""Rocky"" after hearing 5 or 6 people complaining about its  disgusting content
b) have seen it once and, after deciding that it was  ""pointless,"" and turned the movie off immediately...
This I  say to you...

I now appreciate every part of the movie and  how they each build up on each other. Parts that bothered me, like Time  Warp, have really become some of my favorites.
Tim Curry, who is always  interesting, still scares me with his portrayal of Dr. Frank*N*Furter, but  I guess that's to be expected. Susan Sarandon couldn't be better as Janet,  one of my favorite musical heroines ever, and Barry Bostwick is just as  square as Brad should be. The real treats, of course, are Columbia and  Magenta. They are most definitely my favorite characters in the show  because they are undoubtably fun and sexy.
Songs like ""Touch-a Touch-a  Touch Me"" and ""Dammit, Janet"", which I've always loved, play in my head  continuously and other songs, like ""Science Fiction Double Feature"" keep  growing on me and get stuck up top sometimes too. In my opinion, one of the  best moments in this film is the surreal ""Be It"" sequence in the pool. It  is very calming in an extremely perverse way...

It  takes all those late-night science-fiction thrill-omedies and skewers them  mercilessly. A favorite of mine since first-viewing, it's a great musical  and an outrageously fun romp. Misunderstood greatly when it first came out,  this satire preys on cheesy musicals(""Dammit, Janet"" is a  wondeful indication of this), sex-and-science-fiction films(read  ""Flash Gordon"" & ""Barbarella"") and a bit of  society's judgement of man(""Frank-n-furter!/It's all over/your mission  is a failure/your lifestyle's too extreme"") and how we're crucified if  we're not perfect. The performances are on par(including early ones from  Barry Botswick and Susan Surandon) but it's truly Tim Curry who steals the  show(as the transsexual Vampire known as ""Dr. Frank-n-Furter"") in  a role STILL arguably unequaled to this day.

I bought the regular edition on video as soon as I could, and  when I found out about the ""special edition"" I pounced on  it.
Unfortunately, it's not a very ""special"" edition at all.  The original ending with Superheroes is a treat, but it's AFTER the closing  credits in a seperate section.  Why not put it where it was originally, so  you don't have to watch the end of the movie, fast forward, and watch the  end of the movie again?  Boneheaded move on 20th Century's part.
The  other deleted scene, ""Once in Awhile,"" was deleted for obvious  reasons.  It's a great song, but there's only about 5 seconds of new  footage, and the rest is a montage of scenes from the rest of the movie.  If you've got any of the Rocky Horror CDs, you've already heard the song,  so it's no big thrill to have not-quite-matching visuals with it.

493377,5,6302637899,"Richard O'Brien, the creator of the original stage play that spawned this incredible musical satire, and who played Riff Raff in both the original London stage cast and in the film, once said that he wrote the play with  the intent of creating ""something any ten-year-old could enjoy"".  Well, I was ten the first time I saw it, in 1981..the kind of ten year old  who loved KISS,Pink Floyd, comic books, sci-fi films, and, instantly, Rocky  Horror. Now, nearly 20 years later, and HUNDREDS of viewings later, I still  love it.

Welcome to the Horror Show. Richard O'Brien wrote this as a  pastiche of all the science fiction and horror movies of the time. This  shows through in the opening song through to the 'King Kong' esque ending -  with Rocky climbing the RCA tower. The acting is never intended to be  serious. Indeed, Tim Curry hams it up to such a degree that each gesture  can be a joy to watch...or a pain to behold. I fall into the former. I love  the entire feel of this movie, and the songs I still find myself singing  along to in the shower. For those of you interested, we English still  occasionally enjoy Richard O'Brien as the first presenter of the absolutely  bizzare ""Crystal Maze"", and one of the dancers is a (once)  beloved Christopher Biggins - famous for being weird.

Not because I think it doesn't deserve  it, but because many people won't enjoy this, and I seriously think that it  should be watched before buying it. This film doesn't deserve to be taped  over with the latest series of 'Friends'.",926380800,7,1354,4.510288065843621

 The film has a...  Unique style, and songs that are actually _good_ (understand, I usually detest musicals).  The acting is much better than you'd expect, and the story's relatively  deep.  All in all, an incredibly fun film that's worth more than a few  viewings.  None of the characters is really endearing, but you can't help  but love 'em (how could they do that to Columbia?  [sniff!])
 The  Special Edition adds two musical numbers:  Once in a While, and  Superheroes.  Superheroes is in the theatrical version, but Once in a While  is (thankfully) only available here.  The songs are tacked on to the end of  the film, not inserted in their places.",920678400,,755,4.684615384615385

The songs are so much fun to sing to, you can't help but sing and get up and dance to the Time  Warp!!  A must see, not everyone will like it, but it's still worth a try!!",919987200,,298,3.8360655737704916

If you think cannabalism, murder, cross-dressing, and good old fashion rock and roll  are inappropriate subjects for a movie,  pass this one by. For the rest of you, BUY THIS!",919209600,,263,4.695652173913044
493502,5,6302637899,It's the best movie of all time. The first few times you watch it you won't be able to get the music out of your head. Great plot..great music..great movie. Dream it in your living room bit it in the theater.,916099200,,208,4.097560975609756
493503,3,6302637899,"Not quite the worst movie of all time, but that was actually intended . . . The widescreen format is nice, but the ""never before seen footage"" has mostly been in the theaters before, except for the song  ""Once In A While"" by Brad, which is mostly  flashbacks.""Superheroes"" is nice, but rather than include the  ""new"" scenes in the film, they tag them on at the end, which is  just aggravating. ""Superheroes"" actually works well, and the cut  is annoying. Two trailers are also included.",915494400,,486,4.670588235294118

Having it on VHS is great for us former ""show-goers"" who loved the atmosphere and action of the in-house  participation, but now are ""respectable"" family men & women  who wouldn't dare attend a live showing. GREAT STUFF...even on the small  screen......",913766400,,346,5.017543859649122

7828299,5,6302637899,"This is gender bending sci-fi-horror-musical-camp and humor at it's very best. Tim Curry steals the show, but the ensemble cast makes the movie, along with the memorable musical numbers. Low-budget special effects, questionable acting, questionable clothing, questionable pacing, and an off-kilter plot all work together to make this over the top stage-to-screen translation an unforgettable experience.

This Amazon Video rental is of excellent quality given its humble origins. There is good reason why it has been a cult favorite at midnight theater showings for so many years. Let's do the Time Warp again!
