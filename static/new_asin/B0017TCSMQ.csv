3175416,5,B0017TCSMQ,"Excellent videos about Eishin Ryu Iaido techniques, the 3 volumens are very valuables. You must read the book Flashing Steel from M. Shimabukuro to complement this teaching",1290384000,2,172,5.407407407407407
3175417,5,B0017TCSMQ,"This series of videos is a must have for any sword enthusiast who does not have access to in-class training.  The first video shows the new ""practitioner"" how to bow and show respect, as well as gives direction to quite a few simple techniques and katas.  The second and third video allow the viewer to experience progressively more complex forms and techniques.  I have personally read many articles and own several books written by Masayuki Shimabukuro and have found that every product that he and his American student have put out, is of the highest quality.  Great video quality and very informational.  Well worth the purchase.",1280275200,13,633,4.933962264150943

3175420,2,B0017TCSMQ,"Hoping upon hope that this would be a truly ""advanced"" video, but not so much. Sensei's technique is awesome, but that's not what students need to see in an instructional video. We need to see single and two person kata that we can replicate for practice, to improve our techniques. Watching sensei Shimabukuro show off rudimentary Iaido - drawing, cutting and sheathing the katana - and I use the words ""show off"" purposely make this video look like a vanity project rather than an instructional video. Although I haven't found a good Iaido video yet, there are better sword videos - mostly by Aikido practitioners. I recommend passing this one over.",1424822400,4,651,4.873873873873874

3175426,5,B0017TCSMQ,Well done videos (I bought all three) with clear and concise instruction and demonstration. I have learned much and enjoy watching them over and over.

3175427,5,B0017TCSMQ,I have all 3 volumes and wow there is a lot more to just swinging a sword at water bottles etc.  I knew that already but after reading the different reviews on Amazon sword purchases I think every sword owner would benefit from these videos!
