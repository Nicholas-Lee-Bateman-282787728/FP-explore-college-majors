8427082,5,B004EJTGVC,so totally fun. this is a great dvd for play and exercise time - with a great message about all animals and everyone being special in their own way. we started with this since we love the zoo and now we have the whole scooter & me series! kids - even boys! - can do them alone and it's sweet to do with them for family time. the fact that it's an active story and includes life skills makes it super engaging and bonus - educational.  if you've got kids 4 - 7 - get 'em!,1387152000,,470,3.8958333333333335
