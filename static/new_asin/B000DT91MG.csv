Both toddlers are second children and were difficult pregnancies. One mother accused her son of thinking how much he could get away with while at the therapist's office. The therapist reinterpreted the son's smile as saying, ""Come play me, Mom."" The mother said she had to forgive her son first, and then she could play with him joyfully, and he slept through the night.

The second mother was upset that her daughter wouldn't eat properly. She would sit for up to four hours at a time at the table with her daughter feeding her until all the food was eaten. Then the daughter would throw it up and the mother would hit her daughter. In play therapy the daughter wanted to feed the doll pizza for breakfast. The mother objected and insisted on porridge for breakfast. The therapist asked her to let the daughter lead the play therapy. The mother said her own mother fought with her about eating. She determined to let her daughter eat what she wanted, but was only able to let go of about 75% of her food control of her daughter. The daughter slept through the night.
