Between the insipid chinese twang music, different angles of the same character having a smoke, and a million pans around the dining table, I slumped my head down like a dead man, the only visceral reaction caused by this celluloid chang dynasty brochure. When I got this home, I couldn't wait to get it into the player, expecting languid scenes of geisha sensuality. Instead I got a vicious crotch tease! It was so painful I fast forwarded my way through. Next time you make a movie about a brothel, you deliver the goods. Show me the honeys! Don't wanna waste my money!",1013990400,4,595,4.570093457943925
1618576,5,B00005KA83,"After the disappointing job Winstar did on ""The Puppetmaster"" DVD presentation (which I gather may have been due to the poor quality of the source print available to them), this comes as a very welcome relief - the presentation looks to be in the correct aspect ratio this time which is so important given the very careful framing and composition that is a trademark of this director.
There is very little in the way of extras - for Hou Hsiao-Hsien's films that would be invaluable since they do tend to benefit from some background knowledge on the part of the viewer.
As for the film, it's simply wonderful. Check out the opening scene and the amazing way the camera moves slowly and deliberately back and forth to take in different aspects of the action, picking up many nuances (who says Hou Hsiao-Hsien's films are boring to watch!) in behavior and body language. Sure you have to concentrate to get the most out of this film (just like you have to concentrate when watching e.g. Dreyer's ""Gertrud"") but the rewards are there for those that do.
If you have an interest in the very best of world cinema outside of the usual multiplex fare, you just have to see this film.
Now if Winstar or Criterion (or whoever) could pick up some of this director's earlier work (City Of Sadness, Summer at Grandpa's etc.) that would be great.",1003881600,30,1332,4.624472573839663
1618577,5,B00005KA83,"The films that I've seen by Hou Hsiao-hsien have all been ""difficult"" in the sense that their rewards were not there on the surface level. They employ exceptionally long shots, are in a foreign language, have little overt action, and the dialogue tends to be more about day to day concerns than about plot advancement. Nonetheless, I continue to be driven to see his films, since upon reflection or subsequent viewings I feel that I didn't just see an average film, but that I was transported into another world (I realize this is a huge cliche, but I can think of no other director that evokes this feeling so well.)
Flowers of Shanghai probably isn't Hou's best film, (I'd have to say ""The Puppetmaster"" would qualify there) but perhaps it is his prettiest. The film is set exclusively in a turn of the century Taiwanese brothel. The narrative set before us is sketchy (mostly it has to deal with prostitutes dueling over the same rich client) but the detail of the environment is unsurpassed. We see the characters as they gossip about each other, discuss their finances, and talk about the needs of the courtesans. No scenes take place outside of the brothel, so by the end of the film, we feel we have more of an understanding of the brothel's function in that society.
The acting is great, though you'd be hard pressed to pick the professional actors from the non-actors. Hou's style is consistent with most of his work in that we get extremely long shots. In this film, Hou pans almost constantly, always finding something else to look at in the shot. The costuming and art direction are so good that you forget that they have been fabricated to make a film. Basically, everything feels authentic here. By focusing on a small faction of a society, Hou manages to get everything right. The film is a small wonder, and is highly recommended.",1001116800,11,1846,4.683076923076923
1618578,1,B00005KA83,"I bought this DVD on the basis of the single review in Amazon and thought that I would do other prospective buyers a service so that you do not waste money as I did.  So here's my review....
This is the most boring and stilted film it's been my misfortune to watch for some time (and believe me I see a lot of films).  There is nothing to keep one's interest, neither sympathy nor interest for the characters nor the visual aspects of the film. That's not to say that I was expecting a high-octane thriller with car chases and explosions but even the most artful of ""art house"" films should still generate some degree of interest in the viewer.  Having a story-line would help also.  I couldn't discern one here.
The entire film takes place in what looks like exactly the same set but to make it look like somewhere else they have moved some of the chairs around.  After ten minutes you want to press ""pause"" and go to make coffee - you know that feeling, don't you - when a film fails to grip you and drag you into its world.
Anyway, I tried to persevere and not give in to the boredom but after around an hour my girlfriend begged me, (actually ""threatened"" is a more appropriate word) to take it off so I ""threw in the towel"" at that point.  Approximately nothing had happened by then anyway and there seemed to be little liklihood of any developments before the end of the film.
Unfortunately this film tries to make it's main weakness (lack of anything happening) into an asset (Chinese inscrutibility, ""Atmosphere"") and fails miserably.
Save your money and use it to buy some of the better Chinese films which are available, many of which are excellent such as ""Raise the Red Lantern"".",1000684800,4,1691,4.474025974025974
1618579,5,B00005KA83,"(NB this is a review of the film itself not of the DVD) Filmed in Shanghainese and partly in Cantonese, Hou Xiao Xian's ""Flowers of Shanghai"" is an achingly beautiful account of the intimate and, at turns, often tragic world of a flower house, or brothel, in turn of the century Shanghai. Based on a famous nineteenth century Chinese novel (unfortunately not translated into English to my knowledge), it examines the lives of several of the flower girls and their rich clients and examines the cruelty, deceit, hypocrisy as well as the hopes and aspirations of this intimate and highly formal world. In a society where arranged marriage was the norm, the flower houses were often the only place where young men could experiment with romantic love and, contrary to what many people in the West may think, they were not places where the women were simply the victims of male sexual exploitation. Indeed, the women exert a tremendous amount of power and influence over the men and it is often difficult to know just who is exploiting whom. Many male clients were torn between the desire of genuinely finding true love and the fear that their flower girl was just using them to buy herself out, whilst the flower girls feared that they couldn't rely on their male clients - whose declarations of lasting love and support were often only ephemeral and meaningless. Some hoped to marry their rich clients without loving them, some hoped that their rich clients did love them, whilst others simply tried to quietly put away enough money to buy themselves out or support their families. At the end of the film, one's sympathies lie with both the men and the women in equal measure, as one comes to realise that they are all victims of the same stifled and repressive system, where manners and formality reigns and true feelings remain unexpressed. Hou Xiao Xian's film makes use of long static shots (his trademark) and formal fade outs and, together with the wonderfully haunting soundtrack, it is a wonderful, hypnotic, work of art. The whole film creates an illusion of a static and unchanging world, untouched by the events that are going on outside, where the male clients come to escape from the realities of their existence, to smoke opium, socialise, play drinking games and visit their flower girls. The whole film is like a dream, but it is a heart-rending dream in which the women are imprisoned and from which they, one day, wish to escape. Each frame is exquisitely beautiful and the whole effect of this film is to draw you in into this illusory world where time seems to stand still. One gets the feeling that Hou Xiao Xian's visual style and use of camerawork has matured somewhat from his earlier films, as here it is more assured and confident and he has produced a poignant and beautiful work of art. Certainly one of the best films I have seen in recent years, I would recommend this film to anyone who loves film or who simply wants to have an insight into this fascinating and complex culture.",991526400,39,3007,4.729523809523809
1618636,1,B00005KA83,"The 1998 Chinese film is set in a 1880s brothel.  The ""flowers"" are the young women who have been raised since childhood for their profession. Competition for the gentlemen goes on all the time as each woman hopes to become a ""second wife"" to a rich man.  The men also wonder if the love these women profess is real.

Like many Chinese movies, the pacing is slow and stylized.  Sometimes I can enjoy a film like this but this particular story was just not interesting enough to keep me awake, the cinematography used too many shadows and the acting never engaged me.  After about an hour, I shut it off and couldn't bear to go back to it the next day.  You won't miss anything if you skip this one.  Not recommended.",1109376000,5,716,4.378787878787879

1618639,3,B00005KA83,"I was very looking forward to seeing this movie, and I'd bought advance ticket to see it a the VIFF in 98, because it was the first film from Carina Lau since her award-winning film Intimates(Self-Combed). I thought it was going to be her new career high point, but as it turned out, it was just a mediocre ""group-scene"" movie done like a documentary. Not much great acting was generated from the all-star cast from HK, Taiwan, and Japan. I was quite disappointed.

It was very beautiful visually, because they had done a lot of work to the set, costumes and lighting. I found it very hard to follow this film, because most of the actors delivered their lines in Shanghainese, and only Tony Leung spoke some Cantonese for his part. Most of the characters just sit around and smoke pipe and drink tea and wine throughout the movie. There was hardly enough drama to stimulate the viewers. Carina Lau did her best with the way she smoked and poured the tea to her clients, but nothing serious happens that would require her to give more than two or three expressions. I really thought it was wasted her time to be in this movie, considered that she's been in 50 movies and done parts that are so much more challenging than this one.

Anyways, you have to be totally interested in old-world Chinese cultures in order to be amused by this movie.",1102118400,2,1340,4.533057851239669
1618640,5,B00005KA83,"Flowers of Shanghai is a fascinating film, beautiful film, capturing the life n a turn of the century Shanghai brothel. The film is told through key scenes, all of whih are exquisitely shot in low-light.

Some reviewers here complaining about the pacing, but they obviously miss the point. The slow shots, and scenes, help imerse you into what was a very different world than today's West or East, and by the time the film is done, you have been imersed in the language and environment of these characters, and understand the rules and structures they live under.

Yes, there is not one linear story, but in truth several, as each dialogue also talks about other characters, so in that sense, this movie feels like a novel of that time, in which a world is revealed within a diner scene.

The movie is not all style, and in fact, I find more like a dense layer cake, absorbing you into its experience.",1098403200,,901,4.583850931677019
1618641,3,B00005KA83,"After seeing this in the theatre it instantly went to the top of favorites for the year in which it was released & remained there for the duration of the year. I enjoy films that pay attention to detail. And while I did read a few reviews before seeing, I found the film's ability to encapsulate the mores & behaviour to be very convincing. Don't know anything about how much research the director put into the project beforehand, nor do I have any knowledge of the time/location to assess the film's accuracy.  But the sheer attention to detail had me convinced.
While the film is one of the 10 best of the 1990s, this DVD issue is a bit lacking.  There are no extra features (except for an unexceptional trailer).  More information on the director's research & reasons for portraying things in the way he did would have been very helpful (or a doc on the time to go along with the film). The reason why I knocked off another star was for the poor transfer........although the picture seems free of dirt & scratches, the color seems distorted from what I remember in the theater.  Moreover, this version is framed/letterboxed, which shrinks the image down on widescreen tv's/dispays.  As this film is very dependent on the cinematography, this really hinders the ability to enjoy it in its full glory.",1084060800,16,1302,4.668122270742358
1618642,2,B00005KA83,"I love asian films but this is one of the most boring movie made. Throughout the whole movie, i couldn't even see anyones face and I felt like falling asleep.",1052956800,2,158,4.3
1618643,5,B00005KA83,"I can't think of a single film I've seen with less editing. I take that back; Andy Warhol's early b&w films definitely have far fewer cuts (and yes, I know, I know, Warhol didn't really direct most of them). Warhol is probably a good reference point, actually. In ""Flowers of Shanghai"" the camera moves back and forth somewhat within a scene, but never really forward or backward. Additionally, as in those Warhol films, there is almost literally no editing within each scene. A sequence starts, and the camera may continue its gaze uninterrupted for eight minutes or more until the scene comes to its own logical end. I read somewhere that there are a total of only 37 shots in this film, and that seems pretty believable. This style can very easily bore a viewer to death. On the other hand, it can be really mind-blowing. If nothing else, its unusual. It conveys a sense of calm and even stasis, but also belies a foreboding dread. Janet Maslin of the NY Times speaks of Hou Hsiao-Hsien's films as filmed ""with a streamlined ordinariness that amounts to a kind of eloquence."" ""Flowers of Shanghai"" is certainly a perfect example of this. At the same time, ""Flowers of Shanghai"" avoids the manipulation pretty much inherent to film and video - the viewer is not guided by the camera or the editing almost at all, and is therefore forced to take an unusually active role in his or her film experience. This is not to say that we are dealing with a cold, totally hands-off approach to film direction, of course. The music, sets, lighting, camera position, screenwriting, etc. all have an effect on the viewer (I'll let the word 'suture' slip).
All the same, this is an extremely subtle narrative style, a minimal style even. I call it minimal because director Hou Hsiao-Hsien uses so little variation in each of these narrative devices. Take the sets for example. There are no exterior shots at all in this film. In fact, I only noted only one scene in which I could discern any daylight at all. The film is made up entirely of scenes set inside the tight and always poorly-lit chambers of ""Flowerhouse"" brothels of 19th Century Shanghai. Such consistency adds an almost tangible claustrophobia to the already omnipresent feeling of stasis I mentioned earlier. It also lends the film a sense of the everyday (in the sense that Paul Schrader uses the term). I found this really very brilliant and efficient film-making. Placing every scene in one or a few locations is a device not uncommon to theater, but one fairly unusual to film. The Flowerhouse becomes for the viewer a true microcosm, which affords the viewer uninterrupted focus (tunnel-vision even) while, at the same time, prodding the viewer's curiosity about what goes on outside. Watching ""Flowers of Shanghai"", I couldn't stop wondering just what all the men in this film do when they aren't patronizing the brothel? Where do they come by their money? Do they have families? Hobbies? It really isn't addressed, and isn't important to the film either. So long as the viewer is aware that the characters must do *something* else during the day (and Hou Hsiao-Hsien makes sure of this), it is unnecessary to show exactly what that something is.
Outside of formal considerations the film still has a lot going for it. The plot, though relatively low on drama and entirely devoid of histrionics, is engrossing. In brief, the story is driven by the nuances of the close relationships of the wealthy men and the ""Flower"" girls within this insular community. This aspect reminded me in many ways of Mikio Naruse's (excellent) film, ""When a Woman Ascends the Stairs."" Like that film, ""Flowers of Shanghai"" looks at these relationships both in economic and in what can only be desctibed as familial terms. Going far beyond the clear issues of gender, probably the most interesting part of the story is its portrait of the friendships, rivalries, jealousies, obligations, and manipulations just within the 'family' of girls living together in the Flowerhouse, and how these interactions effect the larger 'family' that includes their male patrons.
""Flowers of Shanghai"" is a clear formal masterpiece, and manages to tell a fascinating story at the same time. Certified genius Philip Lopate (who also often writes for the NY Times) calls the film ""one of the cinematic highpoints of the 90's."" The film-fest pass-holder hype surrounding Hou Hsiao-Hsien is well-founded. But be warned that the same stylistic handling that drives me to cry 'masterpiece' will leave some crying of boredom.",1034812800,7,4538,4.902470741222367
1618644,3,B00005KA83,"If you read the review from Yoidy and if you were looking for a skin fest in this movie, you'd be giving a 1 star, too.  :) This one is your basic Asian Art House movie.  Even to an Asian like me, it can be boring and slow from time to time.  The brothel scene and the characters depicted in the movie were very close to what was happening at that time.  If you read the book ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", the relationships and mannerisms depicted in this movie are very similar to the Japanese counterpart.  High price hookers were always prized commodities among the bored whealthies and the second-generation masters.  How the ladies secure their 'supporters/admirers' and accumulate money and connections are the main subject matters in this movie.  So if you were into subtle emotional and gestural exchanges, opulent period pieces, languid pacing, and art house films, you'd enjoy this one.

7942995,4,B00005KA83,"Actually this film is 3 1/2 stars in my book.  I loved the book ""The Sing-Song Girls of Shanghai"" by Han Bangqing on which this film is based.  The film takes such a small slice from the book that it really diminishes the story in the film which is not simple.  I had no problem with the cinematography or the pace, but most of the humor from the book is gone.  The film takes itself a little too seriously and therefore is flat footed.  Most of the characters are missing, understandably, but you get no back story or tangential developments which are very ironic and important to later developments in the book.  Also the piquant and poignant situations involving other key characters are missing.  It is the inter relationships with patron/courtesan, fellow patron and fellow courtesan that are most interesting in the book and barely present in the film.  Having read the book twice I can appreciate the story the movie is visually attempting, but it is too insular and brief.  It will take many more readings to mine the treasures and complexities of ""The SingSong Girls of Shanghai"".  The movie is thin, as the book is not. You can obtain the book through Amazon ""first translated by Eieen Chang,revised and editedby Eva Hung"". It is not easy reading.  All that being said I did enjoy the movie and it is in my library of films, but again the book is the key to understanding the film version.",1328745600,,1399,4.600806451612903
7942996,5,B00005KA83,"The delicate, exquisitely constructed interiors of the late nineteenth century Shanghai brothels - the flower houses - create a serene, idyllic escape for its venerated patrons. Here, in the euphemistic propriety of privileged society, madams, called 'aunts', arrange sexual liaisons for their flower girls through appointed bookings. The Flowers of Shanghai opens to a shot of these wealthy and powerful men, accompanied by their flower girls at a dining table. Within the insular walls of the flower houses, these men create a stifling, dystopic world that revolves around their arrogance and vanity: they amuse themselves with incomprehensible drinking games, idly gossip about the affairs of other patrons, leisurely smoke opium, and indulge in the paid services of women. But these flower girls are far from the fragile, exotic creatures evocative of their names. Pearl (Karina Lau), the senior member of the Gongyang Enclave flower girls, provides helpful guidance to the younger, immature flower girls. Emerald (Michelle Reis), a popular flower girl from the Shangren Enclave, is a willful, determined woman who relies on her intelligence and influence on men to buy her freedom. A fading flower girl, Crimson (Michiko Hada), is burdened with the responsibility of supporting her family. Facing the prospective end of a long-term relationship with her exclusive client, Master Wang (Tony Leung), she accepts the inevitable with dignity and perseverance. When Master Wang decides to marry a younger flower girl, Jasmin (Vicky Wei), to punish Crimson for her rumored infidelity, it is Wang who suffers from their separation. Jade (Shuan Fang), an idealistic woman who believes her patron's empty declarations of love, attempts to ensnare him in a suicide pact, which, in an unexpected turn of events, proves to be a life-altering event.

Hou Hsiao-hsien crafts a visually hypnotic and intricately fascinating portrait of love, power, and servitude in The Flowers of Shanghai. By confining the scenes to interior shots of the Shanghai flower houses, Hou portrays the created, artificial world - the unsustainable illusion - of the flower house patrons. In essence, the flower houses are an idealized reflection of the patrons' own ambivalent feelings between love and passion, obligation and generosity, commitment and fidelity. Inevitably, their hermetic environment of lavished wealth and drug-induced escapism cannot prevent the objects of their affection - the emotionally resilient flower girls - from escaping their tenacious, suffocating grasp.",1278201600,,2555,5.5681233933161955
7942997,5,B00005KA83,"I'm utterly baffled by the critics who weren't at least partially moved by this absorbing, at once sensual and cerebral film.  It presents a question utterly foreign to consumers of Hollywood fare, but also totally fascinating: what are the limits of exchange?  On the surface of the movie, the answer is: there are no limits.  But as the film progresses, the director has an opportunity to slowly unfold, layer by layer, the implications of this statement.  Occurring as it does in a time when the British are introducing the pleasures of ""free trade"" to China (the story takes place in 1888, after the two Opium wars; it's significant that the British are also financing these courtesan houses), it holds up this question like a multifaceted jewel to light, exploring in great detail the possibilities of enslavement and freedom that universal prostitution unleashes.  It turns the men into both objects of consumption and absolute masters; it turns the women into calculating bookkeepers and artists of emotional cruelty, to themselves as well as each other and the men.  All this performed in a highly stylized, exquisite rhythm of ritualized activities (the drinking game, the served meal, the opium pipe, the bookkeeping) where the characters oscillate between sensual abandon and frigid contemplation.

I can see why Eileen Chang liked this story enough to translate it from the original Wu dialect to Mandarin.  As the reigning queen of the Chinese short story, ""Flowers of Shanghai"" contains all the elements that so preoccupied her about the disappearance (or obsolescence) of imperial culture and the struggle of women and men to make a home in modern disenchantment.  The movie pairs well with Wong Kar Wai's ""In the Mood for Love,"" ""2046"" and Ang Lee's recent ""Lust / Caution"" (all of which were directly or indirectly based on Eileen Chang's works).",1227916800,,1863,5.1019736842105265

If you enjoy deliberate and fixated camera work that moves as slowly and intriquitely as the graceful,quiet movements of the girls of the brothels themselves, then read on, watch the film and learn! This film shows us brothel life in the upscale,British-district ""Flower Houses"" of 1880's China. Four ""flowers"" (the girls) are examined in depth through their daily routines, their hopes, their dreams, their motivations, their debts and their customers. The camera work is very reminiscent, IMO, of John Huston's THE DEAD or Terrence Davies films THE LONG DAY CLOSES and NEON BIBLE.The camera slowly,ever so slowly moves as a third party observer;never intruding, but always observing the ""hidden"" world of the liaisons of the women and men. There is nothing sexual about this film. It is all about the contractual agreements and the way business is done;
Opium and green tea are the main ingredients.

The scenes always take place within the British/Chinese decored ""house"" parlours, and the lighting is illumined by the  natural gas and candlelight to recreate authenticity.

7943001,1,B00005KA83,"Well, to put it in the most polite terms I can think of, this film is on my all time 10 worst films list. I think this film definitely has the potential to top that list.

I am a native speaker Chinese speaker. Plus, I am a native speaker of the Shanghai dialect, the same dialect the actors/actresses in this movie are supposed speak. Well let me tell you from a language standpoint, I had absolutely no idea what those actors/actresses are saying. No clue whatsoever.

It was so painful to hear those actors butcher the Shanghai dialect so badly that I couldn't keep myself from burstting out laughing throughout the movie. It was THAT BAD!? For crying out loud, if the actors couldn't speak the Shanghai dialect, at least use do some dubbing and use some voice actors that can actually speak the Shanghai dialect.

The lead male actor in the movie butchered his Shanghai dialect so badly in the beginning of the movie, that he ended up switching to his native Cantonese dialect for the remainder of the movie. God this is embarrasing.

For a native speaker of Chinese, and a native speaker of the Shanghai dialect, I had to read subtitles in order to understand what's going on in this movie. On top of this, I had to read the subtitles in ENGLISH! Yes that's right, this DVD doesn't even include a Chinese subtitle!

I basically ended up fast forwarding through this movie. The director really should have done some serious work in the cutting room. This movie have the potential to be a good 10 minute short film. But at an hour and half in length, this movie is one of the WORST I have ever seen.",1126051200,14,1602,4.491408934707904
