8411171,1,B003ZWT8K8,"This was a horrible production. horrible acting. horrible plot creation, not put to gether well at all and not about the horse. I threw the DVD away and pulled the cover out of the case to use the case for something else. 1 star is much too high a rating for this movie.",1374019200,,270,4.113207547169812
8411172,1,B003ZWT8K8,"The storyline involving a horse seemed interesting so we bought this movie. It was terribly disappointing with bad lines, unlikely buffoon-ish characters, and horrible lighting. I wouldn't even recommend it for young viewers.",1372636800,,225,5.848484848484849
8411173,4,B003ZWT8K8,"I enjoyed watching this with my grandchildren ages 7-11. Great landscape and good story, didn't frighten anybody or make kids worry, but still had some action along with emotion.",1355875200,,178,5.172413793103448
