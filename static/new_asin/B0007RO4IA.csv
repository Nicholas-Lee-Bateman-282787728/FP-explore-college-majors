2238101,5,B0007RO4IA,"I don't understand those who find Alfano's score here ""unmusical.""  There seems to be an increasing number of people who think music stopped being beautiful with Beethoven or, perhaps, Verdi.

Well, call me a sap, but I'm writing this through (yet again) a veil of tears. The entire final act of Cyrano simply overwhelmed me.

Just about every aspect of this production is flawless, and it makes as strong a case for the revival of this opera as I can imagine. First off, there is the Cyrano of Roberto Alagna. We first see him before the opera starts darting down the stairs of the opera house and running through the lobby. Once the opera begins, he makes a sensational entrance from the back of the house, moving among the audience, before hopping up on the stage. There is no way to describe his performance as anything less than simply sensational. The performance finds him in excellent voice, thrilling top notes and with his natural ability in French means the text is sung with

elegance and plenty of panache. Whether running, strutting like a peacock, swashbuckling or hiding from view, Alagna's every move is executed with the elegant grace of a dancer. It is a joy watching someone have this much fun in a role. He executes some fine sword fighting and even as diminutive as he is, makes this character larger than life. His arioso ""Oh! Paris!"" which

ends the first scene begins so hauntingly beautiful and then builds to a crashing, thrilling and exciting conclusion. The call to arms for the Cadets of Gascony (I don't know what it's properly called) is as rousing as one could hope for. I'd have joined the Muskateers, too!

Richard Troxell strikes all the right balances as Christian. The duet between he and Cyrano pledging their alligence to become ""one man"" develops beautifully, and rushes into an breathless finish.

Alfano's music opening Act II is, in my opinion, no less successful than Massenet in Manon at conveying musically, and eloquently, a sense of a specific time without actually resorting to composing 18th century style music.

What a gem is the Roxane of Nathalie Manfrino. Physically and vocally she could be the twin of Christiane Oelze - nowhere more so then in the final act where, with Alfano's so very French music she recalls Oelze as Melisande. Manfrino is a genuine beauty and the voice, a lovely lyric with some wonderful bloom to the top notes, constantly impresses. Like Alagna (and Troxell) her acting felt genuine, one believed her Roxane at every turn. There were times I was a little angry with her shallowness and cruelty towards Christiane, but it all works out.

The physical production is gorgeous - and by Alagna's brothers, David and Frederico, with costumes by Christian Gasc. I don't know how long they all worked on this, but the flow of this Cyrano, the quality of the acting is as fine as one could hope to see in any opera video.

There were plenty of gorgeous musical highlights; the amazing Balcony Duet, with everybody firing on all cylinders; the wordless chorus sung by the soldiers . . . , so many others.

It is, however, the final act that absolutely destroys me. Alfano's score here, so heavy on the woodwinds, descending scales played on flute, the vibrant buzz of the reeds, and with swirling strings, it could easily be mistaken for Debussy (especially with the uniformly excellent French coming from this cast). Alagna's transformation of Cyrano, from cocky now tired and weak, but no less proud is a heartbreaker as soon as he arrives at the convent. As his death approaches, the score grows more and more delicate, passages sung by Roxane unaccompanied, also reminiscent of Debussy, but with Alfano's own stamp (which I'm getting to know better and better and like, more and more). As Cyrano reads the final letter to Roxane, the clarinet takes a soaring melody that shoots right to my heart. I know, some of ya'll think I'm nuts, but this music - this act - I find overwhelmingly poignant.

The efforts of all involved pay off in a wonderfully theatrical and musically exquisite performance. For the longest time I believed Alagna could do nothing better than his performance in that amazing Don Carlos from the Chatelet (also with inspired casting), but this Cyrano really is a creature that touched me as profoundly as anything I can immediately think

of.",1153699200,26,4340,4.817204301075269
2238102,5,B0007RO4IA,"This is a lovely production of a lovely and undeservedly forgotten opera. The performances and fine, the sets and lighting brilliant, and the opera itself is beautiful and lyrical. Some unfairly criticize the opera's music as being average or boring. Not so! While there is little that could be hummed on the way out of the opera house, the entire score is lushly romantic and gorgeous. Forget the humming.

Alagna is riveting in the role. Three cheers!

Do not miss this very fine modern opera!",1142985600,10,495,4.811764705882353
2238103,5,B0007RO4IA,"This is a truly rewarding experience- when the production values including a first-rate French cast headed by Alagna and Manfrino elevate a so-so opera to the highest possible level.

2238104,4,B0007RO4IA,"Once you get over the fact that the score for Cyrano de Bergerac by Franco Alfano is mediocre, at best, with little melody and little to remember, everything else about this DVD stands out for its high quality: impressive set design, fine costumes, great cinematography and outstanding musical presentation from the Orchestre Nationale De Montpellier, Marco Guidarini, conducting. The stand out feature of this DVD, recorded at the Festival de Radio France et Montpellier, in 2003, is that it is a current production, and filmed as you would expect to see in a movie, as opposed to a stage production, even though it opens in front of the curtains. With the exception pf Cyrano's (Alagna's) entrance from the rear of the audience, a technique that I found a little distracting, as I suspect some members of the audience did as well, the rest of this production was perfect in almost every detail. Each scene is set by David and Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rico Alagna with perfection, giving the production a rich feel that is complemented by smart period costumes by Christian DASC and effective lighting by Aldo Solbiati. Robert Alagna is simply brilliant in the role of Cyrano, Nathalie Manfrino is captivating and sensual in the role of desired Roxane, and Richard Troxell is empathetic and compelling in the role of the tongue-tied Christian. The production value of this DVD, and this takes into account the strong acting from a talented cast, is its saving grace, and is reason enough to own it. Indeed, the performances were so strong that I found myself being drawn in, in spite of the disappointing musical score. The DVD contains a brief ""backstage"" look at the cast in and out of costume, and provides some, though not enough, background insight that could easily have made a separate DVD. The quality of the DVD is superb as is the sound. If you own an older version, you might want to update to this George Blume version of Cyrano and see what a fresh approach can do to a story that is as romantic and seductive as this. You won't be disappointed.",1120348800,10,2053,4.818696883852692
2238105,4,B0007RO4IA,"Well no one could accuse Cyrano of being melodic. There are a couple here and there, but nothing you would be able to take home with you. It actually seems that Alfano is doing his best to avoid melody. Lots of lines are chanted on one note. What we have is really an old time Hollywood movie where the music plays an important but subservient role and aids the story. And of  course Cyrano is a good story - I admit I wept at the ending just as I did everytime I saw the film with Ferrer. Alagna is a little young for the part, or maybe Ferrer was too old. But you just can't get over the nose. It's obviously fake and wouldn't be a problem in the audience, but on video it just stands there and draws attention to itself. His singing and acting tho are wonderful as is the rest of the cast.  The production is good - sticks to the original story - no director's tricks. I've often wondered what really happened to Italian opera after Verdi outside Puccini. Cyrano gives us an idea what was going on.",1118534400,8,1001,4.208333333333333
2238106,5,B0007RO4IA,"Well after reading the last reviewer ... a Mr Long , I thought as I am Mr Shortt I had to follow .  I knew the Opera quite well through

recordings but I wasn't prepared for such an emotional and beautiful experience when watching this DVD . If you have a passionate nature you will love this . No arias.. true but it dosent need them, some of the scenes are one long aria in themselves, twisting and searching , never relaxing and pulling at your heart strings .

The production is quite superb . The cast are very very good and Alagna IS Cyrano . The best I have heard him sing for some time .

Franco Alfano is a very neglected composer yet as we all know if his operas had 'hit tunes' things would be very different --( we can say the same about Zandonai to name just one !) It is true  that repeated listenings bring new delights -- evey time .

 I am so pleased that at last the world may hear and see Alfano's

Opera and sincerley hope that his other works follow .  Critics think its fashionable to ' Knock ' Alfano but to me all they do is show thier ignorance of a very good composer . --- Why not try to find Alfano's original Turandot ending ? Its longer , far better and the final pages are unbelievable  (  Josephine Barstow --- Final Scenes ,  DECCA 430 203-2 )

  More Alfano---- Please !",1117843200,14,1304,4.119047619047619
2238107,5,B0007RO4IA,"No need for a lengthy review or discussion.  Alagna is at his best in this performance although his nose does take about six seconds to get used to.  You will never again think of Franco Alfano as the ""man who finished Turandot.""  This opera deserves to be heard, seen and performed and often!  Don't delay.  Buy this DVD !!",1116806400,10,324,4.423728813559322
2238108,4,B0007RO4IA,"This, of course, is a ""must-have"" disc for the opera completist, a work now very much neglected by a composer known best for his completion of Puccini's Turandot. This disc makes a great case for the this work's re-appearance on world stages.  While perhaps not brilliant, there are lovely moments in Alfano's score (the balcony scene and final duet in particular), and is lushly orchestrated.  This Montpellier production is handsome, well-staged and theatrically involving.  Alagna really triumphs in the title role, turning in a performance musically thrilling and theatrically mature - perhaps the best I've seen him do.  Supporting cast is in a second league, perhaps, but all more than servicable (I'm less enthusiastic about Manfrino's Roxanne my colleague below).  Technical aspects are all superb.",1116460800,18,806,5.416
2238109,5,B0007RO4IA,"What joy!

Franco Alfano's opera Cyrano is finally perhaps getting its due, between the Met's premiere of the opera this past week with Placido Domingo and this amazing DVD of a French production starring Roberto Alagna in the title role.

 Franco Alfano (1875-1954) composed this opera in the early 1930's, working with a French libretto by Henri Cain, adapted from the famous play by Edmond Rostand.  The first performance was in Rome in 1936 in an Italian translation, and the opera was done in French in Paris soon thereafter.  Both performances were well-received but the opera pretty much disappeared from the operatic map until recently.  There is an Opera d'Oro recording currently available that resurrects a 1975 performance in Turin, and a sonically far more satisfactory CPO recording of a performance done in Kiel, Germany in 2002 that was well reviewed in Opera News.  But this new performance on DVD leaves these attempts in the dust from all points of view.

 Alfano's music is lyrical, impressionistic, radiant; the opulent orchestral color and sound is full partner to the highly literary text, and propels the drama forward.  The beauty of the music with all its subtleties is more fully appreciated with repeated listening.  Alfano manages to condense all the emotion into music that lasts less than two and a quarter hours - and this from a play that usually runs well over three hours!  Although the play has necessarily been shortened, and some favorite speeches left out,  the libretto text used in this production is extremely close to the poetry of Rostand, even more so than in other performances.  Alagna claims that this version restores Alfano's original concept for the opera, especially in the balcony scene, which had been altered for the first performance because the original version was considered too difficult and not Italian enough.

 But the change in the performance version is not the only thing making this production unique.  It is a special pleasure to have the sung French so understandable and clear, something essential to do justice to Rostand's poetry, where words really do matter.  The mix of volume between the singing and orchestral playing is about as perfect as anyone could ever hope for - both can be heard at all times.

 The film itself is genuinely beautiful to look at, giving a sense of the theatre as well as of the performance.  The sets are striking and evocative, especially in the last act, and the costumes are elegant, aiming at a flowing line and general sense of time and place, rather than a fussy historicity.

 Now to the performances.  Of course, the opera's success totally hinges on the title role.  Adorned with a truly operatic nose, Roberto Alagna has taken on the soul of Cyrano, with all its complexities, nerve, pride, passion and fear.  The result is spectacular, both aurally and visually, throughout the performance.  And nowhere can there be found in any version of Rostand's play recorded anywhere, ever, a more moving interpretation of Cyrano's final moments in which he reads Roxane's letter and soon after dies.  It simply is the best.

 Nathalie Manfrino's Roxane is a joy to the eyes and ears.  The vocal part is not an easy one to make truly attractive, but she succeeds absolutely.  I think the greater weight Alfano gives the part of Roxane, especially in her avowal to Christian of her love for the beauty of his soul (""je lisais, je relisais"") is one of the important things added by the music to the drama.  And her emotion is almost painfully palpable in the last act.

  Richard Troxell is apparently the only non-French main cast member, but his French holds up quite well.  He creates a very sympathetic Christian and really looks the part.  His particular lyric tenor provides a good contrast to Alagna's voice, but having both parts as tenors is what makes the balcony scene possible.  The rest of the cast is equally wonderful in sound and acting ability, especially Nicolas Rivenq as a most elegant DeGuiche.

 All in all, it could be said that this DVD is a real gift from the Alagna family; all of them really are stars here: Roberto of course, his sister-in-law Nathalie Manfrino, and his brothers David and Frederico, who were responsible for sets and direction.  Let us hope that this DVD brings this opera to the fore where it deserves to be, as a most satisfying piece of theatre, that other opera companies will take it on, and that other tenors with the requisite panache will be inspired!  All I can say is thank you, on behalf of Cyrano fans everywhere!

 It is interesting to note that most of the reviews of Placido Domingo's performance at the Met laud the performance (except for the French pronunciation) but tend to dismiss the opera.  Perhaps they just haven't heard it enough to fully appreciate it, and the particular relationship established between the music and the drama.  So much of opera seems to happen in slow motion, but this is not true here with Alfano; he does not often linger to spin out a melody for its own sake.  Curiously enough, in all the reviews I have encountered of this opera and its performances, the last act comes in for praise by some as the best part of the opera, and for strong  criticism by others, as an opportunity squandered, totally missing a fitting climax.  I would say that Alfano simply does not take the more obvious route to effect; this is particularly true in both the restored version of the balcony scene and in the final scene, where the seemingly natural build to a musical climax is broken, for reasons related to the drama and the story.  But in the end the emotion is there, darker, more complex, and even more heartbreaking.

 One final note: baritones who would like to take on the role of Cyrano should not despair - they should look at Eino Tamberg's opera.  It is a gem of a totally different cut, but a gem nonetheless.  True, it is in Estonian, but surely amenable to translation if needs be!",1116374400,15,5978,4.790811339198436
2238110,2,B0007RO4IA,"Roberto Alagna's presence in this production was the only reason I bought it. As usual, he was great. It is just too bad that he wasn't singing to something that sounded like music.

I admit being an old coot way down in the chaparral country of Texas who just doesn't care much for opera written since Verdi, Puccini, or even Wagner. If you really like classical opera I think you might not like this production.",1116288000,9,413,4.506666666666667

8050969,5,B0007RO4IA,"Some people may take issue with Alfano's music, or the many cuts in Rostand's play to pare the story down to an operatic format, but this is a marvelous production all around and a ""must-see"" for Cyrano fans.  My gosh, what a performance from Alagna!  Not only vocally, but his acting is superb as well and he is utterly convincing in the role.  I concur with the other reviewer(s) who've said the letter-reading scene in the last act is emotionally devastating in its effectiveness -- both musically and as drama -- and surely ranks right up there with the best of the stage and screen adaptations.

It's true that Alfano's music isn't full of catchy melodies....  this isn't ""Carmen"" or ""La Boheme"".  But it's quite beautiful in its own, understated way; I also found it reminiscent of Debussy (and ""Pelleas et Melisande"", in particular).",1475798400,,840,4.798611111111111
8050970,5,B0007RO4IA,Not a big opera fan but I love the original play by Rostand. Terrific production. Alagna was amazing. His portrayal of the title role was absolutely spot on. Bravo!,1468022400,,164,4.689655172413793
8050971,5,B0007RO4IA,"This is an astounding opera. It is in the verismo style, which given its fidelity to the play is a given-- otherwise, several arias would have to be interpolated, etc; or else Cyrano would have up to six arias, and the rest-- none. Its faithfulness to Rostand, as I said, is notable; I don't know French, but the subtitles match very closely my English CYRANO; in fact, only a few lines had to be added, to work around the necessary cuts. As it is, it's a 2 1/2 hour opera, rather heavily cut from the play.

The score is, to say the worst, Puccinian. There are, here and there, notes which remind me of Puccini-- but I like this far better than any Puccini I've heard yet. There are places where the music is so right-- truly perfect.

This is my first introduction to Alagna; I am duly impressed. Acting, exceptional, characterization, perfect, singing, very good, not nasal, not effeminate, very right, true to the role. I have read, in reviews of Alagna's singing, that he has not the greatest perfection of technique; I only noticed, myself, a slight tendency to become rather inaudible during pianissimi; on tape, easily ignored. My only objection to Alagna as Cyrano is that he is actually better-looking than the gentleman who plays Christian here-- even with that nose. Now, Manfrino, and indeed everyone else, gets the short end of the conductor's baton here. Her part strikes me as mostly ornamental: ""Go on, Christian."" ""I love you, Christian."" I suspect the costume designers thought so as well. But everywhere else, everything is very much in harmony and much of a piece; what G. K. Chesterton would call 'unity of mood', I believe.

The staging I like very much; much what I would envision. I would particularly draw your attention to the snow in act four, falling from the clouds overhead; this not in a 'movie opera', but apparently on a stage, live.

On the non-operatic side, I ordered used, and the condition was commendable-- scratch-free, no finger-marks, paper insert intact. Even though the disc broke loose in shipping it runs beautifully. I've actually seen fresh-from-plastic discs that were in worse shape. The shipping, also, was marvelously quick; it arrived two days after it shipped.

This one is really fit to add to a serious collection; also for any Cyrano aficionados.",1401321600,4,2304,4.822784810126582

8050974,5,B0007RO4IA,"I had written a glowing review of this superb translation to the operatic stage of one of our most enduring romances, but, somehow, not unusually, I managed to dispatch it into outer cyberspace before it made it to Amazon print. In the interim, I have had time to read the accolades of others, and no longer see the necessity to add to the ebullient reception it has had. Frankly, I don't think the average viewer will care a twig that Alfano is not Verdi, Puccini, Wagner, Handel, Beethoven or some other guy of the very first rank. I would predict that they will bask in a score that gives Robert Alagna, a star of the first magnitude, a chance to create a fine Romantic Opera, suitable for any repertoire. This is a piece, whether on Broadway, in Hollywood, or in their equivalents the world over, in which the Panache, the voice, the articulation, the physical command, manifest by Cyrano, make or break the production. With the excellent help of his brothers,who were responsible for stage production and scenery, the composer, the librettist, an excellent supporting cast, conductor and orchestra, Robert Alagna dominated the action and trumpeted the message of Love, in the bravura fashion intended by Edmond Rostand, author of the original play. He is quite simply a STAR, in every note of  his song and movement of his body. Despite his lack of size and bulk, he is The WARRIOR-POET, as quick with the sword as with the quip.
Yes, once again, I urge those to whom I address myself, the average, relatively naive viewer of opera, to buy (or rent), see, and enjoy, this wonderful evening at the Musical Theater.",1274227200,7,1618,4.73758865248227
8050975,4,B0007RO4IA,"This performance is well sung & well staged. However, this is not a great opera. Alfano is best known for finishing Puccini's Turandot.

8050976,1,B0007RO4IA,"For those who cherish Rostand's work and/or love opera, the only reasons to buy this DVD are:  (1) To have proof of to what extent a masterpiece can be ruined in the grandest (fabulous stage sets) fashion.  (2) To buy as a gift for someone you truly despise. The total lack of melody . . . the endless to the point of nausea recitative . . . negated any glimmer of praise for the creator's sticking to the story line.  In fact, fans of Rostand couldn't care less about Cyrano by the time the first act had ended.  Come to think of it, was there more than one act?  Ultimately, who cares.

True, Alfano's ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" will not be to everyone's taste, but the score is much closer to the romantic lyricism of a Puccini, say, than to Busoni-esque atonalism.  If that helps.  And I can't imagine the opera being given a better production than this, beautifully designed and directed by David and Frederico Alagna, and solidly conducted by Marco Guidarini.  Some other guy named Alagna is brilliant as the titular, long-nosed Gascon.  At turns funny, touching and above all heroic, he sings with such passion and vigor that one can easily overlook his usual slight uneveness in tone and pitch.  (In fact, I feel a little churlish even bringing it up!)  This is, in short, a superb performance.  The supporting cast is equally fine, although Nathalie Manfrino seems to have been cast more for her looks than her voice; even so, she acquits herself nicely.  If you're at all a curious operagoer, by all means pounce on Alfano's ""Cyrano"" -- I'd be very suprised if you were disappointed.",1194220800,6,1097,4.918478260869565
