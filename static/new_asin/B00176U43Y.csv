it was just a psychic reading for a group, I was unable to hear most of the questions.
And you don't even get to see the people she is reading for.
Don't expect to learn anything.
Pretty lame if you ask me?",1302566400,,233,3.875
8265127,4,B00176U43Y,"Very interesting presentation.  The presenter has some valuable information, the only problem is that I could not always hear the questions the audience was asking thus did not understand the conversation flow.  Loved watching the actual technique. It's amazing! Perhaps if the audience had used a mike, we could hear them better???I do hope that this can be fixed at some point.  The technique is very unique  -  awesome!!!",1239321600,3,424,5.086956521739131
8265128,1,B00176U43Y,"I'd really looked forward to this DVD based on the description. I'd gotten a few of this production companys DVD's before and even though generally the quality isn't very good, I have gotten some valuable info from them. However, maybe I'm just not evolved enough for this one because...I don't get it. First I could not understand the speaker because of his accent, there should be subtitles. I really tried but I had to keep rewinding and listening over & over again. Also I found myself laughing when he did the actual techniques on disc 2 after I'd struggled though trying to understand what he what saying in disc 1. This is probably the first time I've ever spoken negatively regarding someone's accent but considering I paid for this DVD to aquire the knowledge they were offering and then the language was so incoherent, I've decided I need to advise others and hopefully some adjustments will be made to this product that will be helpful.",1231632000,2,947,4.745454545454545
