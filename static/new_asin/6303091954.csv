556542,2,6303091954,"""White Cargo"" is a controversial 1942 hit that remains one of Heddy Lamarr's most popular movies. Set in 1910 Congo, Lamarr plays Tondelayo, a half-Egyptian, half-Arab temptress who seduces and antagonizes the white leadership of a British rubber plantation. At the time of its release, ""White Cargo"" conflicted with the Motion Picture Production Code's ban on miscegenation and filmmakers changed Todelayo's ethnic identity from black African in order to avoid code violations. Today, the film plays like a collection of old racial and sexual tropes that have long fallen out of favor and are often offensive to contemporary audiences. Tondelayo is not a well-developed character, but an erotic superficial cut-out whose exotic sexual power drives men to their ruin. Ultimately, ""White Cargo"" is a film about forbidden sex.",1348185600,4,824,5.4453125
556543,3,6303091954,"The setting is a West African rubber plantation circa 1942.  The war has cut off the rubber supply from Malaya, and there is a push to produce more on West African plantations.  That is easier said than done.  There are four white men on the station, the overseer, his assistant, the surgeon, and the missionary.  Intercourse with native women is discouraged.  A river boat brings supplies and mail up the river once every three months.  They are otherwise cut off from civilization, and easily get on each other's nerves.

The film was notable for Hedy Lamarr playing a half-wild, half-native vamp who wants men to buy her pretty things.  She had enticed the overseer at some time in the past and he has banned her from the station.  Now she is sneaking back to seduce his new assistant.

It is not a great motion picture, as such things go, but it is an interesting story  The scenes are somewhat tame by modern standards - nothing sexually explicit in motion pictures of that era.",1287705600,5,983,4.624277456647399
556544,3,6303091954,"Okay, so it's not the greatest flick, but it's interesting for two main reasons: 1) It has some serious racial overtones in that the Hedy character is supposedly not good enough to marry a white man (according to the Pidgeon character), so watching that play out is interesting and 2) Hedy Lamarr is very gorgeous in the role, with her skin color darkened to look like someone who's been kissed by the sun for years.  My only complaint about her character is that she's played as some gold-digging simpleton who wants nothing but beads and baubles, instead of a more complex character in love with and trying to manipulate the Pidgeon character.  The movie would have been much more interesting if they had played out the obvious physical attraction between Hedy and Pidgeon, with him realizing his love for her, despite her race, instead of his bullying her and trying to protect the white guy who married her. Also watch for the scene with Hedy traipsing about with whip in hand--PRICELESS!",1245024000,11,992,4.795321637426901
556545,4,6303091954,"Were it not for the presence of Hedy Lamarr, this film would have been lost in the passing of time.  Other players merely were there to support the latest ""sex symbol""",1243036800,,167,4.387096774193548
556546,3,6303091954,"There's only one reason why I'm even rating this basically forgotten movie, which is VERY dated, and really not any better than an old ""Jungle Jim"" episode. It would probably be  of interest only to old movie buffs, and, as one of those dying creatures, I feel the old flicks are worthy of preservation and viewing. But, the only obvious reason to watch this film is Hedy LaMarr. She (in my opinion) was never really a great actress, but was known for her flawless beauty. Louie B. Mayer imported Hedwig Keisler from Austria, after she literally created a splash in the then unheard of famous nude swim scene in ""Ecstasy"", in the early 1930's. She was married at one time to a wealthy industrialist,  socialized with the likes of Hitler, and had adventures right out of the most imaginative fiction. She also co-invented a device which was used for tracking enemy German subs during World War Two, a fact which only recently came to light.  Though most of her films in her Hollywood career were un-distinguished, she became a top star in the M.G.M. pantheon, simply by virtue of her screen image, and received top billing with the likes of Gable and Spencer Tracy. Her career waned in the 1950's, with even less distinguished roles, and, save for the occasional snippet of various semi-scandalous news in the papers, she dissapeared. In this film, she is so lushly, outrageously, ridiculously  gorgeous, that she makes even someone like Liz Taylor in, for example, Cleopatra,  look like a plain Jane. She is the ultimate ""femme fatale"", a role she basically never escaped.  When I saw this movie as a kid... when Hedy comes out of the jungle and says ""I am Tondeleyo"", well... I think that's the moment when puberty kicked in, because I started shaking at the vision of this impossibly gorgeous, exotic dark  bird of paradise. She is the epitome of the glamorous, other worldy mystique that  stars such as Garbo and Dietrich projected in  1930's and '40's Hollywood, and Hedy in this film rivals even them. Hedy died just a few years ago, in relative obscurity, in a small Florida town. This little old lady was reportedly  a good neighbor and friend to the few people she entrusted, who apparently were aware that their very elderly, sweet friend was, long...long ago, one of the legends of the Silver Screen. A real-life ""Norma Desmond"", though Hedy was, by all accounts, a happy lady in her final years, looked after by her loyal and protective friends.  I can't honestly recommend buying this film for any reason other than viewing the raven haired, shimmering vision of un-equaled beauty that was Hedy LaMarr.",1026691200,36,2614,4.799554565701559
556547,2,6303091954,"Let's be honest: this is not a good film.  Hedy Lamar is beautiful as ever and great at slinking and pouting around the tropical set.  But, unfortunately for Hedy and for Walter Pidgeon, none of the characters or the plot are complex or compelling.  Hedy's character is banal and evil.  The young Brit is just an unsympathetic fool.  Walter Pidgeon is given a little more to work with, but it doesn't save the film.  The film is worth seeing, by the way, for the vision of Hedy in skin-revealing attire.  Just don't pay much for the privilege.",1004140800,4,543,4.536082474226804

I think we will all agree that despite being one of the most gorgeous creatures in the history of film she was not a particularly good actress and I posit that the reason was that she was unable to project the  sexual allure that should come with such incredible beauty.  This film is the exception.  Hedy Lamarr  in the role of Tondelayo could seduce anyone. See it.",1461024000,2,622,4.517857142857143

7836955,4,6303091954,"featuring excellent performances by Walter Pidgeon , a very young Richard Carlson and Frank Morgan (none other than the Wizard Of Oz himself) I was super surprised and disappointed to discover this fascinating film unavailable on either DVD or Blu ray . This is the first film , and I've seen about a hundred + , that can be streamed via Warner Archive Instant but cannot be bought on disc . Dated and peculiar as it was to have the gorgeous Hedy Lamarr portray the mysterious and seductive Tondalayo , the choice only contributes to the film's highly collectible nature . Well worth seeing if you enjoy ""vintage"" films and loath historical revisionism .

races were viewed differently than they are now.  By today's standards, this is racialist
beyond belief, with the ""white man's burden"" in the forefront, but way back when, this
is good escapist fiction.  Have fun viewing one of the most beautiful actresses of way

Riddled with racial and sexual stereotypes, there is something to offend everyone in this seriously dated film. Although it was a hit when it was first released, time has not been kind to this film, which is almost laughable.  Rent it, rather than buy it.",1365465600,,511,4.554347826086956
7836959,3,6303091954,"`White Cargo"" is a 1942 black and white ""sex in the tropics"" story set on a robber plantation in Central Africa in 1910. It was based on a 1912 novel by Ida Vera Simonton called ""Hell's Playground"", then a 1923 play called ""White Cargo"" and a 1930 British film. The author of the play, Leon Gordon, adapted it for this screen version.

Austrian born Hedy Lemarr (1913-2000) was one of the most beautiful actresses of all time, and her American film debut in Algiers (1938) launched her on a 20 year career that included films like ""Boom Town"" (1940), ""Tortilla Flat"" (1942), and ""Samson and Delilah"" (1949). Here in 1942 we see her at the peak of her career, playing a half breed temptress.

Walter Pigeon (1897-1984) plays a cynical manager of the plantation. He appeared in more than 100 films between 1926 and 1978. He's best known for his Oscar nominated performances in ""Mrs. Miniver"" (1943) and ""Madame Curie"" (1944), although I liked him best as Dr. Morbius from ""The Forbidden Planet"" (1956). Pigeon's philosophy was - ""Maybe it was better never to become red hot. I'd seen performers like that and they never lasted long.""

Frank Morgan (1890-1949) plays a drunken physician. Morgan will forever be remembered as the ""Wizard of Oz"" (1939) but this was only 1 of nearly 100 film performances between 1916 and 1950, including Oscar nominations for ""The Affairs of Cellini"" (1934) and ""Tortilla Flat"" (1942).

Richard Carlson (1912-77) plays a nave worker who arrives on the plantation. He's best remembered as Herbert Philbrick in TV's ""I Led 3 Lives"" (1953-6) and from his sci fi films like ""IT Came from Outer Space"" (1953) and ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" (1954).

Reginald Owen (1887-1972) plays a ship's captain. He's best known as Ebenezer Scrooge from ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938) and made nearly 100 films including ""Mary Poppins"" (1964) and ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" (1971). He has the distinction of having played Sherlock Holmes (""A Study in Scarlet"") as well as Dr. Watson (""Sherlock Holmes).

Director Richard Thorpe (1896-1991) was nominated twice for a DGA (""Ivanhoe"", ""The Great Caruso"") and also at Cannes for ""Knights of the Round Table"" (1953). He was famous at MGM for bringing in films under time and under budget. He made 150+ films between 1923 and 1967 and he was particularly skilled in comedies.

1942 was a good year in films - ""Yankee Doddle Dandy"" and ""Mrs. Miniver"" were the clear Oscar winners and at the box office. Other popular films included ""Casablanca"", ""Woman of the Year"", Alan Ladd's ""This Gun for Hire"", Gary Cooper's ""Pride of the Yankees"", and ""Road to Morocco"". ""White Cargo"" fit in well with the escapist nature of many of these films.

All things considered there really isn't a lot of footage of Africa, the sex is merely suggestive (as befit 1942), and there isn't much action or adventure. I'm not sure if modern audiences will enjoy the level of escapism the film provided for 1940s audiences. Bear in mind the famous ""Road to..."" films started in 1940 with Singapore and followed quickly with Zanzibar (1941) and Morocco (1942). Indeed, Hedy Lamarr's sarong seems to come from Dorothy Lamour's wardrobe.

Bottom line - an entertaining look at 1940s escapist fare.",1352851200,4,3224,4.911764705882353
