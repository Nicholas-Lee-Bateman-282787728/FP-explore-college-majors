6208627,3,B00HUAGY6M,"The original Between the Lions DVD is extremely well done and kids love it!  However, this copy has a problem with lip sync when SOME of the people - not puppets - talk.  If we are trying to get children to imitate us as we teach vowels, being out of sync is not a good thing. . . I asked to return my copy for a new one.  The new one arrived and it has the same problem.  I tried to contact someone to explain but could not find an option to do that.  AMAZON TECHNICIAN, PLEASE WATCH THE WHOLE VIDEO AND FIX THE PROBLEM!  In the meantime, I will keep the one I was going to return and you can charge me for the new one you sent.  At this point I will just explain the problem to the kids until I find a place to get a CORRECT copy.",1399939200,10,732,3.80794701986755
6208658,5,B00HUAGY6M,My daughter teaches 1st grade and asked me to order it for her to use in her class. She thinks it's a great book for kids that age. Her class is very diverse and all the kids enjoy it.,1475539200,,184,3.7435897435897436

6208669,5,B00HUAGY6M,"This is my daughters' favorite reading movie.  It is a bit of entertainment (not pure learning) but it makes a great ""reward"" when they have done their other work, and yet they can still learn when I am not home and their dad watches them (he always wants to give them TV when I am not home)>",1425945600,3,292,4.12280701754386

6208671,5,B00HUAGY6M,My 1st graders love these. They really do teach phonics and reading skills. Kids are learning and don't even realize it.,1419811200,,120,4.761904761904762
6208672,5,B00HUAGY6M,My child LOVES this show and it has already taught him so much about reading. I would definitely buy a lot more of the Between the Lions dvds if there were more to buy that were reasonably priced. i don't know why this show is so difficult to find all of a sudden. it used to come on PBS Kids but after PBS stopped airing this it just became nearly impossible to find.  Weird.,1417392000,4,376,4.081081081081081

6208674,5,B00HUAGY6M,"Great show for Pre-K and Kindergarten.  Teaches letter sounds, blending, and touches on things like prefixes and suffixes, etc.  Lots of short segments and a variety of characters and storylines so kids don't lose interest.  I wish more episodes were available, as this seemed to be a long-running series, but I can't find any complete sets or seasons.",1405468800,3,352,5.0344827586206895

6208676,5,B00HUAGY6M,I use to see this on pbs when my oldest child was little but it was cancelled. Now that it's out on dvd I decided to get it for my daughters who are in elementary school. Our youngest is having trouble with reading because of a speech problem and she is doing better with watching this dvd. It's both fun and educational.,1402444800,2,321,4.193548387096774
6208677,4,B00HUAGY6M,"This multi-episode DVD is fun to watch and entertains my granddaughter.  I only wish I could get more episodes, but they seem to be hard to come by, or incredibly expensive.  I wonder why.  They are adorable, they teach in a variety of styles (singing, rhyming, cute situations).  Why aren't more of these episodes available on DVD?  Someone is leaving a lot of money on the table by not producing them in larger quantities.  I'd like to have more for my very curious granddaughter.",1400544000,6,482,4.678571428571429

8635849,5,B00HUAGY6M,"I am an older guy but while I had cancer I was stuck in home and ended up watching some of the PBS kids show during treatment.  The one I loved the most was ""In Between the Lions"", not only because it dealt with a subject near and dear to my heart, which is teaching kids to read, but I love the puppets and the characters that were a part of the show.  I always despaired of ever finding an affordable DVD for the series, and was heartened to find this online.  I am sure I will be playing it in the background when I get home at night if not watching it directly.",1486684800,,565,3.93859649122807
