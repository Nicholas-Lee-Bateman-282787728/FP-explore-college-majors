8567892,5,B00BG1JREC,"Dominated by a volcanic mountain massif on the Southwest corner of Arabia, the Yemen shares the same hot, dry climate as its closest sub-Saharan neighbors, Ethiopia and the Sudan. Though isolated for centuries from the outside world, the Yemen had always been self-sufficient in food. Yemeni farmers still practice a highly sophisticated form of sustainable agriculture, growing crops on intricate terraces carved into the mountain slopes, and harvesting every available source of water. Each farmer is a vital part of an interlinked chain: if one link breaks, the whole system starts to collapse. 'The Hanging Gardens Of Arabia' is the story of how misguided aid projects almost destroyed the delicate balance of Yemeni agriculture - and of the efforts now being made to restore its mountain terraces. One of the most distinctive features of the Yemeni landscape and the secret of its agricultural wealth were the layers of terraces that lay along its steep-sided valleys. Over the centuries these terraces have crumbled away. This program tells the extraordinary story of how a western trained engineer is applying his modern knowledge to rebuild these ancient structures.

Interesting program by DigicomTV with excellent audio and visual quality. A really good educational watch!",1390780800,,1282,5.41
