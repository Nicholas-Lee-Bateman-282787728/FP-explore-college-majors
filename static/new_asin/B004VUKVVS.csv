4484626,4,B004VUKVVS,"I loved this as a kid, and my kids were watching this with me for 2 hours today.  A great, inexpensive way to relive my youth through all these old Hanna Barbera collections.  This maybe a cheesy in the eyes of an adult now but it far surpasses the stuff they are calling cartoons nowadays.",1314489600,9,290,4.254545454545455
4484627,5,B004VUKVVS,"This DVD of Karate Kommandos met, nay, exceeded and obliterated every expectation that I ever had. It is quite simply perfection on a single disc. Having obtained perfection after only 5 episodes, Mr. Norris made the wise decision to be fair to all other Saturday morning cartoons and be cancelled. All 5 episodes are packed with intense action, passionate characters, gripping story lines, and voice acting that makes doves cry. If I could rate this more than 5 stars, I would rate it 20,000 stars... or, 3,000 Norris roundhouses to the fun center of your cerebrum.

I was also extremely pleased to discover the official Facebook fan page of this amazing series. You should go ""Like"" it to be able to further enhance your viewing pleasure. They have quotes, video, pictures, polls, and lots of news and events. Check them out by searching for Chuck Norris Karate Kommandos on Facebook!",1311552000,18,886,4.906666666666666

8444096,5,B004VUKVVS,"I am currently reliving what I enjoyed when I was a kid and now that we live in an age where week day afternoon and Saturday morning cartoons no longer exist, I am so happy that some of the coolest cartoons have now been transferred to DVD. As a kid, Chuck Norris was and is one of my heroes growing up and especially with the words of wisdom that he had to say at the beginning and at the end of the cartoon really carry a lot of weight and I still carry them with me today. Even though the series was short lived, it still means something to me. Also if you take a look, yes, by today's standards, this cartoon would never air because of it's violence. But hey, was anybody stabbed? No. Did anybody get shot? No. So if you're an 80's kid like me trying to relive your childhood and want the whole series all in one shot at your disposal, then this is the DVD for you. A must have for your collection if you're a big fan of Chuck Norris and martial arts.",1422921600,3,955,4.058201058201059
