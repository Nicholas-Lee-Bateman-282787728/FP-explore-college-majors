1808279,3,B00007ELL1,"The Trials of Oscar Wilde, 1960 film

Oscar Wilde was an author and playwright who is best remembered today for his conviction for ""indecent behavior"". This movie provides a biography and shows the trials that ended his public life in Great Britain. This story is set in the 1890s, sometimes called ""the gay 90's"". This era had the worst economic depression of the 19th century in America. Wilde was married with two children when the story begins. He was a gentleman, one who had an income without being in trade. His literary talents are shown by his successful novels and plays. The leisure class of London loved his plays. If you don't know much about Oscar Wilde this is a short history of his life and times.

The film shows Wilde's life as an aesthete and successful novelist and playwright. His spending exceeded his income. [This is a sign of a hidden psychological flaw.] He had a close friendship with a young man half his age, Lord Alfred. Both are gentlemen. Lord Alfred's father, the Marquis of Queensbury (famous for his rules on boxing) strongly objected to their relationship. He left a written message accusing Wilde of ""posing as a Sodomite"". [In England the truth is no defense against libel.] Against legal advice Wilde sued the Marquis. The first jury refused a guilty verdict by failing to agree. The next jury found him guilty. Wilde had to pay the costs of the plaintiff, which bankrupted him. His books and plays no longer sold.

The aftermath is a criminal investigation that ended up charging Wilde with ""indecent behavior"". [The film follows Victorian censorship rules.] The high point of the trial comes when Wilde admits consorting with an ""ugly"" man; this contradicts his pose as an aesthete interested only in beauty! Wilde was convicted of these unnamed acts and given two years at hard labor. His wife was independently wealthy. [Perhaps Wilde's real crime was consorting with lower class thieves, not his social peers. The latter never squealed.] Upon his release he became a ""remittance man"" who received 150 a year from his wife as long as he stayed away from Lord Alfred (and out of Great Britain).

His young friend Lord Alfred is presented as an emotionally disturbed man who would be avoided by anyone with common sense. You can read ""Royal Babylon"" to learn about the aristocratic society of that era. I don't know of any one book that documents the upper class of America in those days. Here are two items. The story of drinking champaign out of a woman's shoe came from a ""resort"" in Chicago (""Sex in the Second City""). Having a nude woman pop out of cake for a bachelor party came from New York city (""The Devil in the White City"").Would there be a market for such a book today? The Muckrakers published stories about corrupt practices, but their magazines were put out of business (""The Brass Check"").
This movie was also named ""The Green Carnation"" after his favorite flower.",1301616000,,2923,4.782178217821782
1808280,5,B00007ELL1,"This excellent film seems to have been missed out by the market.
The storyline is true to history and the production is very good.
With stars such has peter finch & james mason it really should be made available on DVD.",1190678400,13,219,4.365853658536586

1808282,5,B00007ELL1,Brilliant film and could only get it on Amazon.com. Arrived in the UK very quickly.,1449014400,,83,4.6
1808283,3,B00007ELL1,"This is an interesting 1960's view of the Oscar Wilde trial, and might be a good material to those researching Oscar. While not as good as Brian Gilbert's 1997 ""Wilde"" or Moises Kaufman's ""Gross Indecency"", I found the portrait of Constance to be moving. And, when James Mason is the opposing lawyer, you know you are doomed!",1374796800,3,325,4.719298245614035
1808284,5,B00007ELL1,Such a well made film. Cannot understand why it is not available in this country. The cast give wonderful performances.,1364428800,,119,5.0
1808285,2,B00007ELL1,"I was so excited to find The Trials of Oscar Wilde available, and in its original Technirama aspect ratio. However, once viewed I discovered the DVD mastering of this film leaves alot to be desired. Colors bleed, especially flesh tones, around the edges in most scenes, and there is an unnerving jittering in vertical lines (especially when a scene is panning); this also occurs in a scene where a minor character wears a pin-stripe of some sort. Maddening!

As this is a DVD-R, I suspect the source material was taken from video, and not the original film elements. Obviously not enough care was taken in the transfer to DVD. I have to say that at this price ($19.99), I was extremely disappointed in the quality, indeed.  The term ""bootleg"" comes to mind.",1364256000,,757,4.7272727272727275
1808286,2,B00007ELL1,"I did not like it because it was colorized and Peter Finch's face was very pasty and swollen, not at all like the first version I saw in black and white.  Great actors in this production but I wish they would leave  black and white films alone, no coloring them please.",1357948800,,269,4.254901960784314
1808287,3,B00007ELL1,"This is a great movie featuring some excellent performances from top actors - Peter Finch, Nigel Patrick, and James Mason, to name just three.  But like many of these 'manufactured on demand' dvds, the transfer leaves something to be desired.  The picture could be clearer, however, at least it is presented in its proper aspect ratio, which is something.

What I would like to see now is the release of the other 1960 Oscar Wilde film, ""Oscar Wilde,"" starring Robert Morley and Ralph Richardson (it would also be good to see Robert Morley's 1953 film, ""The Story of Gilbert & Sullivan."").",1357603200,3,589,4.811881188118812

7975637,4,B00007ELL1,"Well done portrait of Wilde and Douglas which is often overshadowed by the American film on the same subject and released about the same time.  Of special note, for me, is the fine performance of John Fraser and Lord Douglas.",1501200000,,225,4.625

7975639,1,B00007ELL1,"I have purchased several DVDs manufactured by Nostalgia Family, and this is by far the worst transfer. The reviewers before me who decried the picture quality are not exaggerating. The whole picture is blurry, and the colors bleed. There is absolutely no sharpness to the picture at all. I'm disappointed, to say the least, because I was highly anticipating this film. If it's any consolation, however, the audio is superb.",1496880000,2,423,5.057142857142857
