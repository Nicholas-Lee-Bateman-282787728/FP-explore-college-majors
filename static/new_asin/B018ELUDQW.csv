8742139,4,B018ELUDQW,"This is a pretty good documentary--if you were in the scene back then, it will bring back a lot of wistful memories about how we felt so radical and free, or about how going to Rock Against Reagan or being vegan seemed so subversive. I saw The Dicks probably 10 times back in those golden years, and as good as they were, I never thought that someone would make a movie about them 30 years later. But then again, I never thought I'd still be alive 30 years later, but here I am, so go figure.",1502150400,,492,4.135416666666667
8742140,5,B018ELUDQW,"Fantastic docu that well covers this great band. They emerged from the legendary Austin scene in the 80s with MDC, Big Boys, DRI, B Surfers and others. This is definitely worth buying. Fantastic footage, live shows and great history.",1496793600,,233,5.0
8742141,4,B018ELUDQW,"A little slow at first, but overall a great look at the Dicks. If you like the Dicks, you should watch this movie. If you don't know about them, then listen to 'Kill From the Heart' a few hundred times, then watch this.",1490227200,,219,4.116279069767442
8742142,3,B018ELUDQW,"I recently watched The Dicks From Texas doc. I had tickets to see a screening, but had to give away my tickets due to being sick. I was looking on Prime and noticed it was added.

In anticipation I started watching. The doc came off to me as very amateurish by the filmmaker. The edits and cuts during the interviews were annoying. I also didn't understand why during most of the interviews they played Dicks music behind it. It was hard to make out what was being said. I'd say there were plenty of scene transitions to play loud music, why when someone is talking?

The band's history though was cool. Lots of stories, archived footage and more. If you're a fan of the hardcore punk sound of the early 80s I'd watch it. The content itself is pretty good.",1484956800,,756,4.392857142857143
8742143,5,B018ELUDQW,i cried watching this or better yet brought tears to my eyes. If your from Texas or into HC you will like this. Gary Floyd and his lyrics are so important today as when he first wrote them. Love that guy and the band. So many have been lost during and after this doc and it was good to see. You don't have to know the band to appreciate the dvd. Made me feel very good after the fact,1482796800,,383,3.8607594936708862
8742144,4,B018ELUDQW,I support Gary in almost everything that he does.  Saw him over the weekend for a book signing and he's as gracious as ever (age will do that to you).  Movie is well-done and entertaining.  Must have for Dicks fans!,1478390400,,215,4.325
8742145,4,B018ELUDQW,Pretty good documentary about one of the greatest punk bands ever. It could have benefited from a little more captioning during interviews i.e. who they are interviewing. Amazing live footage. GARY FLOYD!,1466726400,,204,5.40625

One thing is sure about most when it comes to punk rock: you either get it or you dont. Fortunately for me I fall somewhere in between but most people love it or hate it. I can at least appreciate what was being attempted by punk rock even if I didn't enjoy all of it. That being said Im still not quite sure what to make of The Dicks, even after watching this documentary.

The Dicks were a band that formed in Austin, TX around 1980, not a time when their style of music or life was considered accessible by most people. The punk scene in many cities was the same featuring bands who were hailed by the locals and unknown to the rest of the world. Those who stuck it out, like The Dicks, were eventually heard around the world but many were lost to local history. The band was considered influential to the more hardcore punk music being conceived but like most bands eventually imploded and broke apart.

THE DICKS FROM TEXAS is a love letter of sorts to the band. You can tell that the film makers were definite fans of the band and its lead singer Gary Floyd who is featured in numerous interviews taken over the years. It include interviews with the rest of the band members as well when available as well as numerous fans and band followers from their heyday. Each person interviewed has loving stories to tell of the rowdy days when the band played any and everywhere that they could, sometimes to receptive crowds and other times to those more inclined to toss them out. But with each war story a certain amount of respect needs to be offered to the band for sticking it out long enough to be remembered while so many bands are long forgotten.

One thing brought up concerning the band and noted on the back sleeve of the DVD was their refusal to sell out. Rather than sign on the dotted line and become a bigger selling act with a national recording contract they stuck with more regional record companies. While this may have given them great street cred it did little to line their pockets with much needed cash or make their recordings accessible to a larger audience. Ive often considered that phrase, sell out, to be nothing more than an attack on success. It would be one thing for a band to sign a contract and then completely alter their style but just signing and recording under a major label shouldnt be considered selling out.

Not only that but many times its less about selling out and more about evolving. Many bands sounds changed when they were able to afford better equipment or as they developed a stage presence. The fact that they were making money had little to do with the change in sound.

While the documentary definitely loves the band it doesnt serve them well in production values. Most of the film is shot on low grade video and it shows. Sound is also something that isn't served well in portions of the doc either. Pictures of the bands performances begin to be seen over and over again. Live performances from the past aren't up to what can now be done with a cell phone. Surely someone would have recorded the band using something other than the worst equipment possible. If so you wouldnt know it from this film.

Included on the DVD is 30 minutes of live performances by the band. As I said its not the best quality but for fans of the group it gives them something to remember the band by.

My son is a die-hard punk music fan. Hed heard of the band and told me they were worth listening to. He watched this with me and when it finished even he thought the production values on display made it hard to watch. He even told me that there were several points while watching that he almost dozed off. Not a good thing with a movie that only runs 80 minutes. But while watching I thought that the production of this movie was much like the punk rock music of the past. It was off the cuff, volatile and made for the masses without care for perfection or the standards set by others. If you're a punk rock artists of any sorts thats a badge of honor that you wear proudly. Of course as a consumer you might not find it worth plopping down $14 to own that work of art.

With movies like THE DECLINE OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION and SALAD DAYS, both exemplary documentaries about the punk rock scene, my suggestion would be to purchase either or both of those documentaries before this one. If you're a major fan of the band youll want to have this one in your collection. If you're a fan of punk rock music you might want to watch it for historical reasons. For the rest I would pass it by.",1456876800,5,4580,4.378823529411765
