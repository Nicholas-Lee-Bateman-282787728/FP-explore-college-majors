3659785,3,B001JTTJ9E,"*Note that the following review may contain spoilers*

The twelfth set of Naruto starts off with the two episode conclusion of the search for the Bikochu beetle.  Because these episodes are not based on the manga little, if anything, can actually happen to advance the story.  After the conclusion of the beetle arc we are introduced to the next filler storyline, dubbed ""The Curry of Life.""  This is another six episode story involving one of the seven swordsmen of the mist, who Naruto and company hope can provide them with some information on the whereabouts of Kisame and Itachi (all for the purpose of finding Sasuke of course).  The two main villians in this story arc, Raiga and Ranmaru, will remind you of Zabuza and Haku.  Ranmaru's outlook on life is so similar to Haku's that Naruto is actually reminded of Haku and a small flashback ensues.  (At one point Ranmaru, like Haku, calls himself Raiga's tool in which to be used.)  The highlight of this story would have to be the last episode ""Run! The Curry of Life"" in which we get to see Lee's drunken fist again.  After all is said and done no crucial information is gathered about Kisame or Itachi that would assist them in their search for Sasuke.

At this point we have six episodes left.  The episode following the Curry arc is a single standalone episode involving Naruto taking Konohamaru and his pals on a practice survival mission.  Next we have a two-episode story in which Naruto and company are to apprehend a thief by the name of Gosunkugi.  Continuing still we have another standalone episode featuring two would-be imposters who decide to stalk and impersonate Guy and Rock Lee when they are out on a mission for the purpose of infiltrating the leaf village in order to steal the village's secret documents.  Wrapping up the twelfth set we have the first two episodes of another story involving some sort of apparition terrorizing the land of birds.  Naruto and company are sent to the land of birds to investigate.

Overall this set was a step down from the previous and I would have given this set 2 1/2 stars if I could have but felt it was closer to three stars than to two.  The animation is also pretty bad.  There are more than a few scenes in which characters will be running and their faces wobble from side to side like jello.  I can only recommend this set to those who just want their collection completed.",1236902400,,2394,4.617021276595745
3659786,2,B001JTTJ9E,"Don't torture yourself watching these fillers. They really are that bad.
I must start out by saying that I did not believe anyone when they said the fillers were so horrible.
Their had been some filler episodes here and their that amused me.
Then, after Orochimaru changing bodes, and Sasuke getting away, the fillers began. The first two filler arcs, one involving travel to his hideaway and running into trouble there, and then another about that guy who made Naruto steal the scroll at the beginning, the two big prisoners, and that plot seemed pretty good. I enjoyed them.
Then their was a rather boring, poor plot about a bikouchu beetle. Only one episode was good with a summoning jutsu of a giant bee, and Hinata basically taking them out. So maybe 1 1/2 out of the 5/6 episodes then goes for into this box set.
Their is a rather interesting story for about 5/6 episodes about a man named Riaja, who holds a funeral for everyone he kills while they are still alive in the coffin. He is one of the seven swordsman, like Zabuza was and the guy who was traveling with Itachi as well.
While this may sound interesting, it get's very cheesy when Rock Lee continues to go on about ""The Curry Of Life."" It is really, really stupid.
Then their is a further story with Riaja travels with a boy who is his eyes and ears, and a lot about mortality, blah blah blah.
This is a poorly executed story with a good action scene followed by why people hate these fillers so much.
After that, it's just the same thing over and over again. Tsuanade sends Naruto on a mission with some characters; they go fight someone with a plot fit for an episode of Pokemon (actually, no it's not), and it concludes with you annoyed by how bad it is done.
And what's worse is they play on what you want. They are:
1. More Naruto. Who can get enough?
2. To see other characters get more screen time. First it was Hinata, then it was TenTen, both who get near entire episodes devoted to them. This seems to continue to go on.
In the last 9th season (presumably box set 16; it won't end until after that), Gaara becomes the character we NEED to see more. I know I'll end buying that one, but not any of these.
3. Being so-well packaged, with 13 episodes at average, an excellent dub, and playing cards that are really nice.
Do not buy this box set. It is just torture to be teased with decent storylines that go more and more downhill as they go on.
I reccomend box sets 1-11 but not any of these.
Hold out for Naruto Shippenun; at least seasons 1-2 are not filler.",1235952000,,2536,4.363636363636363
3659787,1,B001JTTJ9E,"At has come to this at last. Naruto is right in the middle of filler till episode 220 something. And it mostly reeks. In the 88 episode stretch of bridge-to-nowhere garbage youll find a few episodes that are worth sitting through, and the rest making you cringe. Watch this for the episode with Hinata and the bees, and Naruto trying to find the bug. No episodes in this boxset or the next few take the story anywhere (FILLER!)So buy it if you are a completist. Go in with any expectations at all and you will be dissapointed.",1234915200,4,526,4.43298969072165
3659788,5,B001JTTJ9E,i think Hinata has a secret crush on Naruto but he just doesn't realize it they both we are so good for each other  i like her and her cousin Neji makes me want to knock some sense into his mean hatred towards her.  i think when i bought one of my season's box sets this was in it but i just like Hinata so much  she gets stronger because Naruto cares  its so wonderful  thanks!

3659789,4,B001JTTJ9E,"I, too, have already seen these episodes and they're my favorite when it comes down to the Chunin Exam Arc.  The only downside is the DVD itself.  I ordered this DVD from Amazon's store, waited the week it took to get here, and received my package.  To my disappointment, the DVD only said that it was in English and was the North American edited version.  Now according to the product description, it says that the DVD is in both Japanese and English, and the disc is unrated.  None of that is written ANYWHERE on my shipment.  So I feel cheated out of my time and money.  I know I come off as negative to a four-star rating post, but I only gave it four stars because of the episodes themselves, the disc's product details make it lose that 1 star.  My only reason for buying this disc was to help replace my UNCUT box set (#4; disc 2).  It was a defective disc, and I was outside my 30-day warranty to get it replaced.  If anyone knows where else I can get this disc in Japanese & English and UNCUT, I would really appreciate it.",1208217600,,1032,4.246153846153846
3659790,4,B001JTTJ9E,Great match ups with all the right characters winning.  Awesome skills from our favorites.  You gotta love Rock Lee when he takes off the leg weights and shows Gaara what real speed is!  A must for true fans!,1182816000,,208,4.421052631578948

3659793,3,B001JTTJ9E,"Naruto Uncut Box Set 12 is a three DVD disc set that contains episodes one hundred and fifty through one hundred and sixty-three of Naruto.  This set concludes the Bikochu bug arc, has the entire Raiga arc, the Great Survival Challenge, an arc about a bounty hunter, a story about imposters coming to the Leaf Village, and a search for ""The Cursed Warrior.""

The first item in the extras menu is labeled as ""Production Art.""  This consists of fifteen pages, which are model sketches of some of the Naruto characters.  There is a sneak preview of Naruto Uncut Box Set 13, which runs for roughly three and a half minutes.  Next is ""From Sketch to Screen,"" which contains eight pages of storyboards from episode one hundred and fifty.  For each storyboard, you can choose to see the clip that the storyboard is for.  You can also see the English credits in the ""Extras"" menu.

Next in the extras menu is a selection labeled ""New From Viz Media.""  This link takes you to advertisements for Shonen Jump Magazine, two Naruto pages, and two pages featuring other Shonen Jump manga titles.  A link in the extras menu labeled as ""DVD Trailers"" takes you to a set of trailers.  There are trailers for: Bleach the Movie: Memories of Nobody, Death Note, Hunter x Hunter, and Buso Renkin.  The final link in the extras menu is labeled as ""Game Trailers,"" and it has trailers for: Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 2, Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm, Naruto: Clash of Ninja 2 Revolution, Naruto: Path of the Ninja 2, and Bleach: Shattered Blade.

These extras are what I've come to expect from these Naruto Uncut box sets, but I still feel a little disappointed when I see that no further effort has been put toward the special features on these sets.  However, if you're a Naruto fan that wants to collect all of the episodes on DVD, then the Naruto Uncut Box Set 12 would be a good addition to your DVD library.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1277769600,,2005,4.56145251396648
3659794,3,B001JTTJ9E,"This is a 'must' have, especially if you're a true Naruto fan. It's full of filler episodes, but if you love this series...they're worth it ;) You'll enjoy this item",1272412800,,165,4.533333333333333
3659795,5,B001JTTJ9E,"This was a great box set! It contains episodes 150-163 all of the episodes were wonderful! Some of the episodes kept me on the edge of my seat, while some made me burst out laughing! It was an enjoyable product and I highly reccomend it! It also came with Naruto playing cards! I enjoyed this box set so much I went ahead and bought the next one! ^_^",1252627200,,350,4.161764705882353
3659796,4,B001JTTJ9E,The box set was smashed in on the corner. however the DVD's are still in great condition. Just lost value as a collection.,1247356800,,122,4.3478260869565215
3659797,4,B001JTTJ9E,"Like most people have said, it's filler, so it's not as good as the earlier stuff but I still think it's entertaining and worth a watch if you like Naruto.",1241568000,,155,4.2
3659798,5,B001JTTJ9E,"OK, I am a little old to be into Manga and anime (40 this month *sigh*)... except why let the kids have all the fun? I always enjoyed the themes of the underdog fighting the odds and unshakable friendship and I've yet to grow out of it. Who would want to?

This set of episodes does contain the dreaded 'filler' eps. The writesrs place it after the first rescue mission for Sasuke fails but before Jiraiya takes Naruto off to train. Some people hate fillers, some people love them. Count me amid the latter group. I enjoy the wider scope that the rest of the ninja corps enjoys in this volume. I especially enjoyed watching Hinata challenging herself to grow.

While I do find that these episodes can be uneven (I especially had a hard time swallowing ep #159. The Bounty Hunter from the Wilderness & #160. Hunt or Be Hunted?! Showdown at the O.K. Temple! due mainly to the fact that the writers appear to have forgotten that that particular set of genin had any talent!) I am willing to forgive and forget the occasional poorly executed idea since I loved most of the episodes.

If you love Naruto and would enjoy seeing more of the secondary characters, this is the Box Set for you!",1240963200,,1184,4.472222222222222

If you don't like them becuase there not a lot of blood and fighting in them that's life. These episode of a part of Naruto and they show better side of him. I have seen all these episodes on TV as well as on this set and they just keep getting better. I like it when Naruto is funning. Just give it a look.",1236902400,,469,3.9473684210526314
