5449355,5,B00ALTQRGG,"I am from Ohio. It's strange seeing how a boring life in a harsh cold winter could change.

But of course, it requires a devastating train wreck, evil, secret government activities and

8553402,5,B00ALTQRGG,"I always loved these two suspenseful movies and this is a nice package fro the price. Super 8 isn't just a kids movie. It's moving and extremely well scripted, acted, and the animation is great. Eagle Eye is also well scripted and acted and has a plot that keeps you guessing...at least for a while.",1465862400,3,299,4.454545454545454
