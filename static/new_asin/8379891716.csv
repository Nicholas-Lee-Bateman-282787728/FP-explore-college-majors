1171011,5,8379891716,"In the movie theater, when the film ended and the credits rolled forth, no one moved from his or her seat.  No one.  Other than the classical music from the screen...it seemed like everyone was either in shock or in prayer.  That was a phenomenon quite unexpected.

Ostensibly, the film is about Ida (pronounced  Ee-da), a novitiate who is on the cusp of taking her Catholic vows in an isolated Polish monastery. Her Church name is Anna.  Her mother superior tells her (for the first time) that she has a relative, an aunt, and Ida must see her before she decides to commit her life to the Church.  Ida protests...why has this aunt not contacted her before, perhaps the notices did not reach her.  But she obeys and visits the older woman who was a sister to her unknown mother.

The aunt is a communist prosecutor and magistrate who has seen it all.  Red Wanda she has been called - perhaps because she sent some persons to their death?  Why?  As enemies of the state.  We learn nothing else about the men or women whom she convicted. Initially, the aunt is reluctant to visit with her niece...and baits her with the statement - so you are a Jewish nun?  This revelation stuns the young girl.  Obviously, she has begun her journey to her aunt with no knowledge of the world and probably little knowledge of Jewishness.

The two never warm to each other, except perhaps in one scene where the younger girl comforts the older woman.  They decide to set out on a quest to discover what happend to Ida's Jewish family and find their graves.  Whether Catholic or Jew, such a journey is of deep personal and spiritual significance.

As the two go on their relentless journey, they learn Ida's parents and even Wanda's son were murdered during the Holocaust  The murderer confesses. They confront him - not with invictive..but with quiet disgust.  One of the most powerful scenes follows as the murderer climbs into the victim's graves that he had dug long ago.

This film reminded me of a Dostoyevsky novel, where the entire film is is really about the interior lives of the two personalities in contact with long repressed emotions.  What does it mean to be Jewish to the individuals involved who have not lived Jewish lives.  What does it mean to be Jewish in a Polish society which has destroyed most of the people of that faith and feels no guilt.

What struck me most about the film...more than the gorgeous black and white cinematography... is that this is a movie about silences.  And what those silences may mean.  There are no answers in the film...just the silences and the meaning each viewer gives to them.  Perhaps that explains the behavior of the audience that I remarked upon at the beginning of this review.

The performances are subtle and sparse...but totally believable..  That's a quality I miss in films today...Polish director Pawel Pawliikowsky has renewed my faith in the future of moviemaking.  Postscript...I agree with The New Yorker Magazine that this was ""by far"" the best movie of 2014.",1402185600,4,3012,4.690839694656488
1171012,4,8379891716,"""Ida"" (2013 from Poland; 80 min.) brings the story of a young woman, Anna, who grew up as an orphan in a Polish convent. It's now the very early 60s and before she takes her final vows to become a nun, Mother Superior sends Anna out to meet her aunt Wanda, the only family member she has (but has never met). When Anna and Wanda meet up, Wanda tells her the truth: Anna was born Ida, a Jewish girl whose parents perished in WWII and she ended up as a very young girl at the convent. Wanda and Ida decide to go back to the Polish village where the family perished. Will they get the true story behind the death of Ida's family? Will Ida turn her back on the convent and Catholicism now that she's told she is Jewish? What will become of Wanda? To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from Polish writer-director Pawel Pawlikowski , who brought us the excellent ""My Summer of Love"" some 10 years ago. Here he brings yet another deeply moving story of a young woman, now Anna/Ida. Second, the movie is not only shot in black and white, but on top of that this is not a wide-screen movie (the aspect ratio is close to but not quite 1:1, very unusual). Third, there are several serious undertones, be they emotional, religious or otherwise, in this movie, The tension between Wanda, an alcoholic, non-practicing Jewish woman, and Ida, the shy yet curious Catholic-raised nun-to-be, is explored brilliantly in the movie. Then there is the issue of Jewish survivors of WWII, and the non-Jewish local population's tormented feelings about whether they did enough to help Jews in WWII. Fourth, the B&W photography paints the Polish landscape as utterly bleak and yet beautiful at the same time. Last but not least, the lead performances are simply outstanding, mostly so of  Agata Trzebuchowska  in her big screen debut as Anna/Ida, but veteran actress Agata Kulesza as Wanda is equally superb.

If it sounds like I am gushing about ""Ida"", it's because I simply love this movie, and sure to make my ""best of 2014"" list later this year. ""Ida"" premiered at last Fall's Toronto International Film Festival, to great critical acclaim. The movie finally opened at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati this weekend, and I went to see it right away. The late matinee screening I saw this at was PACKED, much to my surprise but delight. Yes! there is a demand out there for a challenging but deeply satisfying, top quality foreign movie like ""Ida"". In case it wasn't clear yet, ""Ida"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1402012800,159,2643,4.628997867803838

1171014,2,8379891716,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

'Ida' is Polish director Pawil Palikowski's latest contribution to the canon of Holocaust and post-Holocaust 'dramaturgy'. Lasting a brief 80 minutes, 'Ida' is shot in bleak black and white and has been likened to the style of the French New Wave and their iconic 'progenitor', Robert Bresson. The film has garnered one accolade after another and one has to search far and wide before digging up any significant critical commentary. Nonetheless, I will join those few who refuse to jump on the proverbial bandwagon, and praise this film as if it's the second coming of 'Grand Illusion'.

Set in Soviet-controlled Poland in 1962, 'Ida' is the tale of Anna, a young woman who has lived in a convent all her life and on the verge of taking her vows as a nun. Before allowing her to prepare for the ordination, the mother superior informs Anna that she has a long-lost aunt and insists that she meet her. As a girl who's been sheltered all her life, it feels a bit odd that she would insist on Anna seeking out the aunt, in light of the fact that such a meeting could be traumatizing.

Nonetheless, given the extraordinary nature of Anna's parentage, the mother superior perhaps believes that meeting the aunt would be the proper thing to do, vis--vis the Church. It turns out that Anna's birth name was Ida Lebenstein and she was the lone survivor of a Jewish family murdered during the Holocaust. This information is confided to her by her Aunt Wanda, who never revealed her identity to her niece, in all the years she was at the convent.

The Ida plot concerns Ida's quest to learn the fate of her parents and their final resting place. The contrast between the idealistic Ida and cynical, jaded Wanda, couldn't have been put more succinctly put, when a sarcastic Wanda describes the difference between the two, to Anna: ""I'm the slut and you're the saint!""

On the surface, Wanda appears to be a character we haven't seen before: a former state prosecutor, now working as a Judge in a post-Stalinist Poland, who also happens to be Jewish. But despite her semi-prominent position in the Communist party, nothing can help her feel better about herself. In addition to occasionally having indiscriminate dalliances with men, she also has a bad drinking problem. In one telling scene, she's arrested for drunk driving and pulls rank on the local police official who has been processing the arrest, threatening severe repercussions, which could lead to his dismissal (or perhaps something far worse).

Wanda's self-destructive attitude is similar to the character Sol Nazerman, played by Rod Steiger in the 1965 Post-Holocaust drama, 'The Pawnbroker'. Both are 'damaged goods' as a result of their experiences during the Holocaust. Nazerman becomes a total misanthrope but Wanda expresses her contempt through her sarcasm. One reviewer (Dennis Schwartz) aptly describes 'The Pawnbroker' as ""an unpleasant, solemn and overwrought melodrama about an embittered Jewish Holocaust survivor."" This description can also be applied to Wanda. The problem with Palikowski's strategy here is that he wants credit for merely pointing out the OBVIOUS: the Holocaust was a terrible thing and in some cases, had immense, deleterious effects on the survivors. And Palikowski goes further by attempting to manipulate our emotions by having his one-note character (SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD), jump out the window (in effect, Palikowski can't resist 'hitting us over the head', by again stating the obvious: 'you see how bad it was for Holocaust survivors! She even jumped out the window!).

Just as plenty of Jewish people will find this dour portrait of survivor guilt to be obvious (and perhaps heavy-handed), those of Polish heritage may feel equally short-changed. With any good melodrama, you cannot have a tragic victim without a sinister villain. The skimpy way, however, in which Palikowski references the Holocaust may play into a simplistic notion of collective responsibility for Polish anti-semitism during and after World War II. But there were indeed isolated acts of Polish people attempting to help Jews during the Nazi Occupation as well as many Polish victims themselves, at the hands of the Nazis.

After searching for the father, Anna and Wanda discover that it was the son who murdered Anna's family. All we know that he's a villain who killed the family to take over the deed to the house. The narrative suffers from the lack of development of a complex antagonist as we never really get to know much about the son or the rest of the family. Instead, the incident is used to simply explain Wanda's guilt (the revelation of how Wanda's son--who she gave to her sister--is murdered, is perhaps the last straw, that leads her to do herself in!) as well as raising another issue: Anna's decision to forgive her family's murderer (she agrees not to contest the claim to the property in exchange to finding out where her family is buried!).

As for how Palikowski resolves Anna's issues can be interpreted in differing ways. I found it difficult to believe that Anna would suddenly give into her carnal desires given her sheltered upbringing. It makes for a good movie to have a love scene, but the odds that such an idealistic woman would suddenly 'come of age' (albeit so briefly), remains questionable. Does Anna's decision to return to her faith represent a triumph for her--a sticking to one's guns, so to speak? In my view, Palikowski wants us to view her return to the church as a second tragedy. Note how she so flippantly dismisses her lover's idyllic picture of the future. For Anna, marriage and family life can only lead to a mundane existence; so a return to cloistered life, now appears mandatory.

'Ida' is replete with powerful visual images and raises important questions about faith, guilt and forgiveness. This is all at the expense of important character development as well as a tendency toward melodramatic excess. In short, I wanted more.",1401926400,13,5991,4.976023976023976

1171044,4,8379891716,"When I turned on the television the night of the Academy Awards early in 2015, I arrived just in time to see this movie win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. You probably already know the basic plot. On the eve of taking her vows in Poland in 1962, 18-year-old Anna (Agata Trzebuchowska) goes to visit her aunt Wanda Gruz (Agata Kulesza), and discovers that she was born Jewish, named Ida Lebenstein, and survived World War II, though her family did not.

***************Spoiler Alert******************************************************************************************************************************************
At this point, Anna, with the help of Wanda, starts searching for her parents' graves. The smoking, drinking, promiscuous, out-of-favor Communist judge Wanda, throws temptations to Anna to doubt God's existence and give in to sensuality from the start. Among cynical aunt Wanda's early lines:

""So you are a Jewish nun?""
""You have to wear this hood all the time?""
""What if you ... discover there is no God?""

But as Director Pawel Pawlikowski says in one of his interviews in the Extras, Anna's ""faith is unshaken"" by Wanda's words and actions.
Wanda's frustration with Anna's firm self-possession reaches a peak as she says to her one night:

""I'm a slut and you're a little saint ... This Jesus of yours adored people like me. ... Take Mary Magdalene. ... I won't let you waste your life!""

Wanda tries to tempt Anna with the presence of a young man she is giving a ride to, the saxsophonist Lis (David Ogrodnik). Lis is clearly taken with Anna who nonetheless says she will continue to pursue her vocation. Giving voice to the powerful witness of Ida's purity and goodness, Lis says to her one night:

""You""ve no idea of the effect you have, do you?""

When Anna and Wanda are about to part ways, Wanda has clearly been softened by her niece's patient love with her, and gives her a hug. In response to a question from Anna, Wanda says, No, she won't be attending Anna's final vows but she'll drink to her.

After this, the movie takes an unexpected (though not totally) turn as Wanda is shown smoking in a bath, a look of despair on her face. Next, she jumps out a window, committing suicide.

At this point, still not having taken her final vows, Anna comes back to Wanda's house and is also shown at Wanda's funeral. Anna is shown back at the house smoking, drinking, and twirling around in an apparent drunken stupor. Next, she sleeps with Lis. At the end of this encounter, Anna asks Lis what they should do. Lis talks about getting married, getting a house, and having some children. As Lis keeps talking, every time he stops, Anna asks him: ""And then?"" Clearly, Eternity is still what is most important to her.

Though she has delayed her vows, Anna is next shown in her habit, on her way back to the convent. This part of the movie was disappointing to me. After showing such firm virtue for most of the movie, the shock of Wanda's suicide seems to have driven Anna to seek to ""experience"" life before deciding which path she will take. Though possible, the loss of Anna's firmness of will seemed somewhat unbelievable, resulting in me giving the movie 4 stars instead of 5.

The Extras feature fairly extensive interviews with Director Pawel Pawlikowski, whose English is quite good. The film is shot in black and white, which works well. For most of the movie there is very little camera movement. The film is in Polish with English subtitles. Agata Trzebuchowska as Anna/Ida Lebenstein was discovered in a cafe in Warsaw. She had no desire to be an actress and this was her first film. Her performance is excellent. Could a more experienced young actress have done a better job? I doubt it. In real life she describes herself as a feminist and atheist. ""Ida"" is to be praised for its examination of the mystery of suffering and unspeakable evil and atrocity as well as themes of conscience, vocation, and the interior life.

Its young hero is a novitiate brought up since infancy in a convent, as innocent and ignorant of the world as any young person could be. Ordered to leave the convent for a last visit to an aunt who's been asking for her,  in a few short days the wide-eyed Ida is exposed to about every deadly sin, and the whole Pandora's box of the evils of the 20th Century is opened before her eyes. Poland, in central Europe, was invaded by almost everyone, and suffered through fascism, communism, antisemitism, genocide, and starvation. The 1960's, when Ida is released into this world, seems exhausted and hung-over after the previous orgies of evil. Ida was protected from the violence, but observes the results of the trauma, and has only her innocent, innate human goodness to work backwards to not just  learn about the past, but to understand and judge it.

Full of the detritus of recent history, the movie itself is minimalist. ""Ida"" is almost empty of rhetoric, its bare-bones dialect full of gaps and silence. The Polish countryside is stark and wintry in black and white.  This would be grim if not relieved by Agata Trzebuchowska's face. It is clear and free of deceit, but guarded as expected of a young person in a strange world. Instead of language, we understand her through her subtle and fluid facial expressions. It is a beautiful face, simple and minimalist also.

Pandora's despair is softened by the last spirit in the box - Hope. For Ida, hope for the world is found in love, which seems to survive in the crevices of life despite all attempts to extinguish it.",1453507200,,1615,4.712765957446808
1171083,4,8379891716,"I actually saw the film on Netflix. The movie showing on Amazon did not have subtitles and I do not understand Polish. It was dark, interesting.",1453507200,,144,4.576923076923077
1171084,5,8379891716,"Director and co-writer Pawel Pawlikowski has created a powerful yet simple film about chaos in a young woman's life. It's communist Poland in the bleak 1960's and Anna's life is about to be shaken to the core. Anna is an orphan who was raised in a convent. Her faith is strong and she is soon to take her vows as a nun. Mother Superior directs Anna to meet a mysterious aunt that she did not know existed. The seemingly cold and uncaring aunt tells Anna a family secret that will change Anna's life forever. Eventually, the two embark on a journey to the village where Anna was born to learn the fate of her parents. Destiny and fate are about to collide and neither Anna nor Wanda will ever see life in the same way again.
Amazing and astonishing are words to describe this wonderful film. Agata Trzebuchoswka (Ida) had never acted before and was discovered in a caf&eacute;. She portrays Ida with a fascinating devotion and sympathy. IDA is filmed in black and white which automatically sets a stark mood in the dismal days of communist Poland. The camera is motionless until the last few scenes and the movement jars us into reality. The family secret is so overwhelming that it will change Ida forever. IDA is slow moving and the dialogue is amazingly sparse. It's Ida's saucer-shaped eyes that fill the screen as we try to decipher what she is thinking. Her Aunt Wanda played by another actress named Agata (Agata Kulesza) is another character to study. She seems cold and heartless having abandoned her orphaned niece. IDA doles out bits and pieces of information in small parcels so we can try to understand people's actions, especially Wanda's. Nothing in life is ever clearly black or white.
 It can be painstakingly slow at times and in the tradition of European art films, many things are left for the viewer to interpret. What path will Ida take? Will the dark family secret consume her? It's an fascinating study watching Ida experience the world she has never seen cloistered in a convent. IDA is not for everyone but if you appreciate a high-quality, thought-provoking delicious art film, IDA will overwhelm your senses.",1453334400,2,2135,4.739247311827957

1171184,3,8379891716,"This is a rather depressing movie about a young woman, on the verge of taking her vows to be a nun, who is sent by the Mother Superior of the Convent, to spend some time with her sole living relative, an aunt, the sister of the young woman's deceased mother. It has been explained that the aunt was unable to raise her when she was orphaned, but other than that, the young woman (Ida) is given no further details. When she arrives at her aunt's residence, she is somewhat surprised to find out that her parents were Jewish, since that now makes Ida a Jewish nun! But that really doesn't seem to matter, since she is a devout Catholic and very determined to live her life in the service for God.  The Jewish aunt is a former Polish government official who had a high ranking in the Socialist (Communist?) party, but who now seems to be making a living as the next best thing to a prostitute. Not a street-walking type, but one who lives off men who take care of her. Maybe she has a pension - it wasn't that clear. Anyway - most of the movie is spent with the two women searching for the truth about how Ida's parents were killed and where their bodies are buried. It's very bleak (the movie is in black and white) and thankfully it only runs an hour and 20 some minutes.  While I can't say I won't remember the movie - there are some chilling scenes and memorable moments - it's kind of a downer to watch, so just be prepared ahead of time if you're going to invest your time in this film.  There are definitely some unanswered questions as well, and that always bugs me.",1434758400,,1571,4.282828282828283

1171199,4,8379891716,"Possible spoilers.  Pawel Pawlikowski's (""My Summer of Love"") beautiful film won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film earlier this year.  Pawlikowski returns to his native Poland for the first time, taking us back to the early 1960's where the country transitioned from brutal Nazi occupation to the bleak existence under the Soviet influence.

The film features only 2 characters.  Anna (first timer Agata Trzebuchowska) is an 18 year old orphan raised in a rural Catholic convent to be a nun.  Not yet taken her vows, Mother Superior (Halina Skoczynska) sends Anna into the city to meet her only close relative, an aunt and sister of her mother.  Wanda (Agata Kulesza) is surprised to see her niece at her doorstep and even more surprised that the Sisters have not told Anna anything about her.  Invited in, we see Wanda, still with a hangover, shoo a man out the door who had obvious spent the night.  We suspect that Wanda is a prostitute, but rather she's a judge.  Anna then is surprised to learn that she is actually the daughter of Jewish parents.

Inquiring as to what happened to her parents, the unlikely pair begin a search to locate the family's graves.  For a while the film becomes a mystery with clues popping up and extorted with Wanda's influence and persistence.  Along the way, Wanda doesn't hold back on the booze and the flirtations that can come after, much to Anna's discomfort.  But Anna finds solace in the form of a travelling jazz musician (Adam Szyszkowski) who is kind and thoughtful.  Eventually Anna and Wanda find out what happened to the sister/mother and father.  It turns out that Wanda may have also lost her young son at the same time.

The facts of their deaths, while not in question, are never addressed as to why...other than they were Jews.  When Anna returns to the convent and is scheduled to take her vows, she decides she's not quite ready and returns to the city and decides to try out Aunt Wanda's lifestyle, if only once, before returning to a life with the Sisters and Christ.

While the film has a tendency to ponder at times, its 82 minute running time, limits those moments.  An obvious labor of love for Pawlikowski, he even shoots the film in the unusual, for today, squarish 1.33:1 aspect ratio in black and white.  I get the black and white but why that aspect ratio?  I suspect he was trying to emulate the look of European films of that era.  In another unusual touch, many of the shots are framed asymmetrically with just the character shown from the waist up in the bottom quarter of the frame.  More prominent in those shots are windows or pictures or buildings.  I thought it was very cool.  In one of the supplements it's learned that Pawlikowski had to replace his cinematographer at the last minute and used one of the young camera operators (Lukasz Zal) to fill in.  The film was nominated for an Oscar for cinematography.  Recommended.

The Blu ray has a 1080p video resolution and looks sparkling given the dour backdrop of communist Poland.  The images are sharp and clear with excellent detail.  There are other interesting scenes where the characters are shot through windows which provides some unusual lighting effects.  You will have no complaints about the picture quality.  The audio has an excellent DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (Polish) option.  Although there is nothing extraordinary in the delivery - primarily due to the material - the dialog is perfectly clear.  Some ambient sounds are created with the outdoor scenes and in the jazz club.  Subtitles are available in English and French.  Extras include a Q & A with the director, clips from a Polish TV show as well as interviews and a trailer.",1433462400,,3680,4.74015748031496

The whole movie felt gray and depressing, which I believe was the director's goal. It certainly pertains to the time and environment the author is describing, yet at the same time, I feel that the ending is meant to be a positive one as Ida realizes there's nothing for her in ""life"" and is resolved to return to the covenant. I wish we got a better look into her personality though; how did she feel about living in the covenant? Does she hate it? Does she just go with the flow because she has no other choice? Does she feel safe there? Because that would give some much more insight into her final decision of going back. The first three quarters of the movie are rather dull and slow, though the last one is crucial; I wish the director didn't make us sit through all that dullness for so long. Again, it seems that that's the mood and idea he was going for, many cinematographic concepts felt over-used and pretentious.",1430697600,,1064,4.461538461538462

1171262,5,8379891716,"I saw this film at Ebertfest on the Virginia Theatres great screen.  Since the cinematography is spellbinding, I would urge viewers to see the film under the best conditions available to them.

The story is set in Poland in the 1960s.  A young woman named Anna is about to take her final vows at a bleak convent.  The mother superior urges her to meet her aunt Wanda before taking this step.  She does so.  Wanda is a judge (Red Wanda) whose specialty is pronouncing sentences on former Nazis.  She is an alcoholic and she is a Jew.  She informs Anna (now a devout Catholic) that Annas name is actually Ida and that her parents were Jews.  She survived at an orphanage during the war, but her parents were murdered.  Wanda herself lost her son.

Wanda and Ida travel to their old village in search of news about Idas parents fate and their actual burial site.  I do not want to disclose the rest of the plot, but suffice to say that Wanda urges Ida to think long and hard before taking her vows and that each woman undergoes some significant experiences in the films third act.

The director was raised in Britain but directs like a classic European director: slow action, lingering shots, stark black/white scenery and a focus on the human past, human guilt and (limited) human possibility.  The scenes in the Polish forests are particularly memorable.  You can see every limb, branch and pine needle, but nothing moves.  Everything is frozen in time and both menacing and lovely at the same time.  Heavy in both its ideas and in its images, this is a thoughtful, haunting film.",1429488000,,1579,4.602150537634409

What was not explored in previous reviews was why Ida's parents and Wanda's son were killed. To shed some light on those horrible times one can draw several conclusions. Perhaps they didn't want to end up in a concentration camp, or perhaps the neighbor was afraid for his own and his family's life - as this was the penalty  - yet he managed to save Anna by taking her to a convent - as he felt she had a chance to survive due to her appearance and age.

1171314,5,8379891716,"Spoiler alert, with a brief historical perspective

Ida is an amazing film that captures a snapshot of Poland in the 1960s - a Poland that is still healing from the atrocities of World War II, while simultaneously still adjusting to Soviet rule. The movie subtlety highlights the religious tensions that existed in Soviet Poland between the Catholic faith and the Soviet government officials as depicted in the religious tension between Ida and her aunt through out  much of the film. The film also highlights some of the social tension and existed in a post-World War II Poland. The film shows a family living in the home that once belonged to Ida's family. Ida's aunt makes it clear that the current tenants are illegitimate in the eyes of the government, when she reminds
Feliks Skiba who owned the house and land previously and then forces her way into the home. Later in the film, the illegitimacy of the current occupants is further reiterated when Feliks tells Ida that he will show the women where their family is buried if they promise to give up claim to the house. This could be making reference to a German colonialization policy that occurred in Eastern Europe during World War II (Anne Applebaum, Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe 1944-1956, p. 118). Under this policy Jews were forcibly removed from their homes and replaced with members of the Germanic race or those loyal to Germany during the war (Anne Applebaum, Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe 1944-1956, p. 118). Although the act of dispossession that appears in the film does not seem to originate from a governmental source, the outcome is the same - Jews were forced out of their homes, and their homes were given over to either Germans or Poles, and then they most likely were murdered. This also highlights a poignant truth that everyday citizens to some degree were responsible for the mass killings of Jews whether that be an active role, such as the case of Feliks Skiba murdering Ida's family, or a passive role such as remaining silent and not intervening when the genocide was taking place.

Overall this is a beautiful film that captures the cultural tensions, complex social situations that existed in Poland during the early 1960s.",1427846400,,2240,4.874015748031496

Colloquium Response
I thought this film spoke well to the ways that Ida had to juggle both her christian faith and also her family's Jewish background. As she and her aunt try and find more about her parents' death, Ida becomes more confused as to who she is.  We see this especially towards the end after Wanda's death where she is tries on her evening dress and drinks and smokes for the first time.  She also removes her cap and is romanced by the saxophone player Lis.  In the film, remembering the events of WWII and the treatment of Jews is a fragile topic.  The people that Ida and Wanda talk to don't want to remember the past or have anything to do with Jewish people. In The Golden Tradition by Lucy S. Dawidowicz, she explains that the 19th century, many Jewish families attempted to maintain a sense of cultural identity within Eastern European society that was not always accepting of their differences in religion and ways of life.  Jewish school children attended class imbedded with Christian teachings and instruction.  Jewish students were criticized for being different.  I think there's also guilt felt by many by the way that Jewish people were treated, this is apparent in Felik's confession to killing the Lebenstein family.  This film provides the viewer with a look into Polish wartime history and the conflicts of identity and people.",1427587200,3,1368,4.791489361702127

1171326,4,8379891716,"This has been described as an ""art house"" film and I'd have to agree.  I take art house to mean it's the type of film that won't have mass appeal.  The story is serious and quite dark, it's shot in black and white, and what isn't said is just as important as what is said.  The acting is top notch.  It's a disturbing story but also one with glimpses of light.  The main character slowly grew on me, as did the Aunt character.  I gravitate toward foreign film to begin with because I like getting out of my own culture for 2 hours and see a foreign perspective on life.  I know some didn't like this movie and that's fine.

Might seem boring at first if your brand of entertainment is of the ""fast and furious"" genre, but note however, that If you like the shock value of ""Shut the front door!"" bombshells - plot surprises that come out of left field or are at the very least unexpected, Ida delivers at least 1 huge OMG that you just can't see coming and a few lesser shocking reveals that are solid ""whoas!"" on their own.  I cried not during Ida ( I was too busy reading the subtitles), but afterwards, as I searched for angles and explanations of some of the plot twists that I needed more clarification on.  I then had a glimpse of insight into the crushing despair that can linger in the heart of anyone who has ever unfortunately experienced or witnessed this heinous period of modern world history up close;  that along with the mid-atlantic slave trade and many others, forever distorted the destinies of everyday folks who just didn't deserve it.",1427068800,2,1304,4.489451476793249

1171386,3,8379891716,"Perhaps if you missed WWII, this film would be informative, but it there is nothing significant or special about Ida's struggle to find herself or to confront the conflicts of post-war Poland, she reacts as any teenager who has to make the dicision to take religious vows for life or not.  Finding out that she is Jewish does not seem to make any difference. If this is an issue for her, it is not clear.  Compared to other recent films about women who are working out life problems, this film does not offer any insight into her inner struggle, her inner strength, or any real enlightenment on her part.  The nuns at the convent where she was raised are rather are depicted as conventional, one-dimensioal, and appear unrealistc as people who have just experienced a horrific war and the devastating aftermath under Communist rule.  The only character who has any depth is the aunt, who captures the torment of the transition in Poland after the war.  I do not recommend it.

She is escorted by her emotionally distant aunt on a trip to find the place of Ida's brother and mother's burial. Their time together is unrealistically void of conversation, their somber characters have nothing to offer the viewer, never mind each other. Aunt commits suicide; Ida, so pure and clean, finishes the show with a brief moral compromise, then heads down the road back to the convent. It's all too dismal, gloomy and melancholy for me.

Yes, the crime of the Holocaust must be remembered always, however an over focus leads inevitably to a neglect of other historical events. That said, watch this movie. The main character is a young Catholic novitiate on the verge of taking her vows who learns that she is Jewish and her parents and brother died due to Nazi persecution. Excellently counterposed to the young novitiate is a cynical older aunt of hers who, through power with the Polish Communist Party, seeks vengeance against the past. The older aunt's vengeance however fails to heal her inner anguish and she relies on liquor and one-night sex affairs to narcoticize her pain. I loved the ending, where the young novitiate walks down the road and it is undecided which path she will take: Will she become a nun? Will she follow the hedonist path of her aunt? Will she take the path of what is portrayed as meaningless marriage, a family, and old age? That is the question at the end: How will she deal with the existential question of life when it carries the additional weight of the Holocaust horror.",1426636800,2,1193,4.658767772511848

One should not forget that all the worse death camps were built and run by the Germans in Poland because they could rely on the anti-Semitic Poles not to protest the murder of the Jews. The acting was superb. The feeling of despair of a sister left behind to live after her whole family perished was palpable and very real.

1171532,5,8379891716,"""Ida,"" a Polish film directed Pawel Pawlikowski, who co-wrote the screenplay with Rebecca Lenkiewicz, is set in 1962.  Agata Kulesza plays Wanda Gruz, a dissolute, hard-drinking, chain-smoking former magistrate.  Her niece, Anna, portrayed with wide-eyed innocence by the lovely Agata Trzebuchowska, is a novitiate about to take her vows.  Before she does, her Mother Superior sends her to visit her aunt.  What a shock it is for the hard-bitten Wanda to face her sister's eighteen-year-old daughter!  Ida is everything that Wanda is not: young, quiet, inexperienced, and idealistic.

Pawlikowski's direction and superb black and white cinematography capture the dreary and forbidding wintry landscape in Poland.  We learn that Wanda sold her soul to earn a position requiring her to represent the interests of a repressive regime. When Wanda allows the orphaned Ida to stay with her for a while, the two discuss their dead relatives, and Ida learns a shocking secret about her lineage.  Agata Rrzebuchowska is touching as a nave young lady who takes a crash course in Real Life 101.  She goes to a club, drinks, smokes, and meets a handsome saxophonist who finds her attractive.  Will Anna abandon her calling so that she can enjoy the carnal pleasures in which Wanda so freely and joylessly indulges?

The acting is wonderful, and the bare-bones screenplay requires us to look at the characters' body language and observe their facial expressions in order to intuit what they are thinking and feeling.  Who will change more after these two very different women get to know one another--the highly-strung Wanda or the spiritual Anna?  ""Ida"" sensitively raises intriguing questions about personal identity, conscience, family, and the impossibility of completely severing one's ties with the past.",1425427200,,1797,5.307420494699647

Therefore I was prepared to be deeply moved. The coming-of-age story at the center of the film was well acted. But there were no sympathetic Jewish characters. There was never Jewish spirituality, sweetness, or worship to compete with Ida's experience of Catholicism. The survivor Aunt was a repulsive character, who rose in the hated post-war Communist government through her moral coldness--but the rationale behind her behaviors lacked insight, and did not construct a meaningful back story. In summary, the film seemed to say that after the Holocaust, the only good Jew was dead (committed suicide), or had converted to Catholicism. I recommend that the filmmakers re-examine their deepest motivations, and try again to discover the long-term emotional consequences of Polish complicity in the Holocaust.",1425254400,7,978,5.316129032258065

Why is it foreign film directors believe lots of silence and staring have anything to do with the making of a film? And, that it will be considered a good film? Well, I guess someone thinks so, because ""Ida"" did win the Oscar. So, what do I know other than it was awfully slow and boring through most of the movie. The film set in Poland is about a young girl, Anna/Ida (played by Agata Trzebuchowska) who has been raised in a convent and is about to take her vows. She is sent away by the Mother Superior to visit her Aunt, who over the years has refused to visit Ida. The Mother Superior wants Anna/Ida to have some time away from the convent to ensure she truly wants to take her vows.

1171587,5,8379891716,"""Ida"" departs from most  post-Holocaust films in that it tackles both the twin evils of Nazism and Stalinism in Poland.  The year is 1962 and in its wake are the scorched earth left by the Third Reich and a picture of a deceptively benevolent Nikita Khrushchev adorning a bare wall.  Eighteen year-old Anna (Agata Trzebuchowska) is on the verge of making her final vows in becoming a nun.  She receives a visit from Wanda (Agata Kulesza), an aunt she's never met and a former fearsome Communist Party prosecutor now a prominent judge.  Wanda tells Anna bluntly her real name is Ida and that she is a Jew.  Wanda's intentions for Ida is for both of them to locate the remains of family members who perished during the war and give them a proper burial.  Wanda, a self loathing cynic, hopes to gain some semblance of closure while Ida goes along in hopes of receiving answers to the direction her life should take.  Alas, there's no easy way out as the women find out and their past is doomed to define their futures.  On the surface director Pawel Pawlikowski's film would seem slight filmed in stark black-and-white populated with few characters containing sparse dialogue and coming in at an economical eighty minutes but it's because of its simplicity that it achieves resonance.  For me the film brought to mind ""Sophie's Choice"" but you could go decades mining stories from the Shoah and still not run out of compelling ones to tell.",1425168000,4,1437,4.712

1171607,3,8379891716,"I would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could.  One word to describe it: bleak.  The filmmaker seems to be telling us that life under Polish Communism is just as gray as the wintry skies that populate the backgrounds in every scene.  There seems to be no relief.  Ida, a novice at a local convent on the verge of taking her vows is lost and forgotten, and an unknowing 2nd generation Holocaust survivor. She is sent by Mother Superior to answer the question, has she had enough experience to know if the nun's life is truly for her? She meets her Aunt, a successful judge, and cynical drunk, who lost her sister (Ida's mother) and all of her family, including her own son, to the vicious, cruel Polish actors in Hitler's mad, hateful crusade against the Jews, especially virulent in Poland where he and his cohorts didn't have to teach the people to hate their Jewish citizens.

Then during her pre-vow visit to her Aunt, she meets Lis, a jazz musician playing the dining room at the hotel where she and Aunt Wanda are staying while on a quest to uncover the details (and remains) of her slaughtered family.  Does she want to go ahead with her vows and the only life she's ever known?  She has a one-night stand with Lis to settle the matter.  In a post-coital Q&A, he invites her to share his life: get married, get a house, have kids.  To which she replies, ""...and then?"" To which he answers, ""Life.""  The stark contrast of her choices are severely limiting, and she chooses to return to her convent and the only safety she's ever known.  The filmmaker uses ""life"" as a metaphor for the cheerless prospect of living out her days in the dank, joyless socialist existence in postwar Poland. Who can blame her?

The film is made in a style that mirrors that existence. It almost feels like stop-motion animation.  There is no ""life"" anywhere.  It is soulless and penetratingly bleak. We, the audience, know that Lech Walesa is over the horizon somewhere, but that bit of promise is not a part of the narrative here. The film is a satire on the opposing forces of religion and the emptiness of postwar socialist life in eastern Europe.  There is just enough humanity in the characters (Ida's fellow novitiates, the band musicians, even her Aunt who is poignantly lost, bitter and self-destructive) to make us care...but not too much.  We do not quite get to know any of the characters.  Their outward behavior is actually a mask for the inner turmoil-cum-hopelessness that pervades all.  The filmmaker does get us to feel that and makes his point. We feel crushed afterwards.  And oddly, we feel that Ida has chosen about as wisely as she possibly could.",1425081600,14,2646,4.591489361702128

1171661,3,8379891716,"I would give 3-1/2 stars if possible.  Question: Are you watching the film to appreciate it as a form of art, kind of as a critic would, or are you looking for a movie where you can relate to the character(s) to some degree and/or get lost in a story and feel you've had a satisfying movie experience?  To me (not a film expert by any means) it serves more as the former and less the latter.  As a work of art, the crisp, clear black and white is beautiful and perhaps lends greater feeling than color would have to the somber threads from which the story is woven.  Many of the scenes are framed (if that is the right term) visually in such a way that the impact is magnified somehow in simplicity and spareness, such as (**SPOILER ALERT**) the crossroads, the man digging, the open window.  Some shots may be stretched out a bit longer than needed for effect?  I found the story itself quite interesting.  My disappointment is in the performance of the actress portraying Ida.  I wish the director had coaxed or wrung greater expression from her; a different actress may have brought me to a more positive review.  I understand Ida was a product of an environment which was limited in various ways that affected her emotionally, but her persistent flatness became annoying.  I very much appreciated the performance of Kuleza (the aunt) and was moved to tears by her.  Even with a more satisfying lead, I couldn't give it a 5-star because I was dissatisfied with the ending, however, that says more about me, as I personally know other people whose philosophies lean in such a way that they would have found the ending quite satisfying.  In conclusion, 3-1/2 stars as is, could have been 4-1/2 stars with better lead actress.",1425081600,4,1726,4.586319218241043

1171683,4,8379891716,"I'm a bit late to the ""party"" in discovering this film, which last week won the Oscar for ""Best Foreign Film"". I was able to find it on the streaming service Fandor and decided to take a chance. When it first appeared on my TV screen (via my Roku player), I wondered if I had chosen the wrong film. It was in standard 4:3 screen aspect ratio (basically square, not wide screen) and it was in black and white! It looked like a well restored film from the 1950s. And the time frame is also the 1950s so that didn't help.

As the story unraveled I was quickly drawn in - though ""quick"" is not a word to describe this 80 minute film. I don't believe in ""spoilers (if you've read my other Amazon reviews you know that) but I can reveal that the plot revolves around a young nun in Poland  who is preparing to take her vows and then learns  (from an aunt) that she is, in fact, Jewish (she was raised in an orphanage.). I can reveal that because it occurs in the first five minutes of the film. What keeps you interested is in seeing how the nun will deal with this conflict within herself.

There is really not a lot of dialogue in the film but, when there is dialogue, the subtitles are reall easy to read; the large white typeface on the black and white background makes this possible.

No, this is not the best film I've watched all year - and I'm not sure why it beat out the competition for the award, but winning the Oscar brought me to see the film and I'm glad I did.

I did not see the DVD version so I don't know if there are bonus features.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

1171705,1,8379891716,"First, the positive. If Henri Cartier Bresson were making movies , he would use the cinematic language of this cinematographer. It is a work of art in that respect. One would have to reach to the works of Satyajit Ray , and his poetic humanism in b/w to find anything comparable. (The Big City) comes to mind.  However The Big City had a heart the size of the world.
  This is where the positive ends. This is the most elaborately contrived movie I think I have ever seen parading effectively behind the guise of the high art of cinematography. Very strange, the complete lack of warmth in the convent , is in my experience, terribly innacurate in its depiction of the cloistered life anywhere. This is a movie which delights in the suffocating lack of humanity, (which arguably is what post war Poland was like to greater or lesser degree). However, the concentration on so much that is bleak, humorless,lifeless is like a giant vacuum cleaner has gone and sucked everything out of life. There is not one person in this film who seems to have their inner pilot light going, exept for the incredible (my second
 reason for one star ) is the music of John Coltrane, which is something of the deepest richness. I loved hearing Naima, etc,  which Ida is briefly seduced by ,I am stupefied by this directors ""vision"" and find it as interesting and moving , as being given an already chewed piece of gum, or the carapace of a locust, it is visceral, but without taste or inner color.

The filming is very good and the black and white works well, but in my opinion, there's no story of interest here. Also, scenes that you would think you'd see aren't there - for instance, a car runs off the road, and you don't see the car wreck, you just all of a sudden see the car being pulled back onto the road.

1171708,4,8379891716,"The subject - a girl going to take her vows to the church is told to visit her aunt who had always refused to take her in after the war.  Set in Poland in what appears to be the early sixties, it is a simple film with a complexity of purpose and topic.

What does Ida have to consider after finding out her parents were Jews and died in the war?
Who killed them and why?  Where are they buried?
Why did her aunt never take her in?  What did the war do to her to turn her away from her own surviving neice?

Upon spending time with her aunt, she learns about her parents.  Who they were, what they were like, and where they were from all become part of the tale to find their demise.  It is easily seen how the local villagers who knew her parents bear the guilt of what happened to the Jews in their town.  This shame comes out defensively and often in anger.  Regardless of their shame, or possibly because of it, they act aggressively at times to defend their actions.  As one man says:  ""It's my house"" wanting to keep what was taken from others during the war and now either from shame or from coveting things stolen he displays a self righteousness in maintaining it as his regardless of any moral questions.

When you look at the main points of the film, you have to ask yourself:  Who killed her parents and really why?  Who should Ida be in light of the revelations she discovers in her life.
You will see the reasons for her aunts actions an they help to explain who she is.  You will also see Ida learn about her faith and the validation of who she is.  You will see how people act in town that were in Poland after the war towards outsiders or to people who ask questions they don't want to answer because the answer exposes truths they wish to deny to themselves and the world.

How could she have faith without questioning others around her with the same faith that historically committed such acts or deny them now?  How could she consider taking her vows without learning anything about the faith she was born into?  Faith comes from understanding and resolving the questions about origin, God, your religion as well as other religions.

********SPOILER ALERT ********

In the end Ida returns feeling validated in taking her vows which was a great disappointment.  Part of me feels like Hitler won a small victory when she becomes Christian.  Part of me also believes he fails because there is Jewish blood in the church, albeit not continuing for any further generations beyond whom she tutors.

I feel there is an obligation to be the person she was denied and to return to Judaism not only for her parents, but also for all the people who destroyed her culture in the village she was from.  Taking her vows comes across as an act of faith, but also a betrayal of her parents.  It also gives another victory to their murderers in her taking on her murderers faith.

This film is a great example of how many European countries have so many people that did things that are shameful to their own neighbors and justified it in the time of war or in the name of self preservation but never atoned or attempted to right past wrongs.  This shame is the real driver behind many actions which today continue and should just be corrected into doing what is right.

It was just a poorly done shallow film that came across as trying way too hard to be intelligent and thought provoking, for which it did not at all succeed. The only mildly redeemable aspect of this film is the decent cinematography.

The aunt provides the niece with information about her parents who were murdered during World War II.  The story of the aunt develops as they set out to discover what happened to the parents and son of the aunt during the war.  I shall say no more so as not to spoil the film.  The story is very moving and is fully exploited by the filming in black and white which has an impact as it both renders the film quite bleak (the scene in the hotel room for example) but also gently enforces beauty (for example the countryside and the convent).

It painstakingly paints a picture of a crime committed by Polish farmers who hid a Jewish family; Ida's family.

1171774,4,8379891716,"""Ida"" is a beautifully photographed, quiet film about a novice who discovers unsuspected facts about her family background when she is on the verge of taking her vows as a nun.  Despite the shocking nature of some of the information, the characters are unemotional and affectless.  Filmed in black and white, each scene is beautifully shot, however, the composition is static, like a series of paintings; the director doesn't employ much movement in the best scenes, and the transitions between scenes lack any sense of connection, such as common shapes or positioning.  The lack of emotion leads to confusion, in particular, one shocking sequence is inexplicable as there does not appear to be any reason for one character's actions.

The lead character also makes choices that make no sense given her upbringing and level of experience.  One gets the impression that something was left out, or the viewer blinked and missed some critical explanation.

There seems to be some unwritten rule that at least one film about World War Two must be released every year; this one from Poland was nominated for Best Foreign Film, but I'll go out on a limb and predict that it won't win.

Also shot at the standard 1.37:1 ratio of that day, This film looks bleak, gutted, bled from start to finish - much akin to a similar look, that of director Bela Tarr. The story takes us on a journey of a young nun encouraged to visit her only living aunt, relative, local lush, and residing regional judge, hammering down the punishment she doles her alcoholic self daily.

Our heroine, cloistered in the confines of a monastery since birth, walks into an unknown path and swims waters as she and aunt make a bond to recover her long dead parents remains. There in lays her Iliad and Odyssey as they embark countryside in an under communist rein. The additional third essential character is introduced as the vagabond saxophone player hitch-hiker who's role diminishes and increases to moves the narrative along. Suffice to say - If you see only one art house, foreign film this year, or decade Ida must top your list. Flawless filmmaking at it's finest.

There are plenty of nut jobs  all over the internet, who claim that German death camps are a historical myth. You be the judge.

Beside historical one sided slant, I looked at details. For example, the car that was used by the main characters (another thing, Ida is NOT THE character of this story, so why the title?) is East Germany product of the era Wartburg with a 2 stroke engine ( I drove that model way back, so I know how it sounds). Yet, you clearly hear a 4 stroke engine... most of the time. Simply lazy.
Story of a Polish farmers who risk their lives to save Jewish neighbors through the majority of II WW, decided to murder their at the end to.... get their house. YET, one of the Jewish family members who survived the war (where how.... the movie doesn't say) turns into a vicious communist apparatchik (prosecutor) who gets a very scary  Bloody Wanda  nickname (I will not go into politics of this movie, but there are a lot of people not happy about this character either).

Its startling simplicity, the perfection of its imagery, the powerful performances of its actresses, and the strange, haunting emotion of its final scenes set it apart from all others. Its imagery--the emptiness of its compositions, its masterful use of natural light, and the emotional intensity of its incident.  Don't get me wrong. This isn't a tear-jerk-er. It will crawl into your head, and come back as memory.

One of the finest examples of ""pure cinema"", the film has little dialogue, but tells its story with images clearly and strongly.
What a relief!  No messages, no preaching, but in the end it helps you understand a little about people who choose to live a life in the church.

Ida is going to become a nun, but before she takes her vows she is sent to visit an aunt who she has never met. She discovers the truth about her childhood, and must take a journey to discover who she is both inside and out.

Ultimately, I was frustrated and a bit disturbed by the possible message of the film. But I did think about the film a lot (I had the same frustration with The White Ribbon).  Maybe I read too much into the ending, but  the indifference Ida seemed to have re the death of her parents and the grief of her aunt thanks to the Nazis made me think that, since Ida did not personally experience Nazi atrocities, she can easily move on with her life. Ida's lack of compassion disturbs me as history can easily repeat itself and I feel she would do nothing to stop it. She would simply live her supposedly safe, secure life in the nunnery (Polish nuns were also killed/imprisoned during the Nazi invasion).

While Wanda is reluctant to disturb all the memories she's tried to forget, Anna insists on it, she is a novice in a catholic convent about to become a fully pledged nun who doesn't know anything of who she really is, she was raised as an orphan by catholic nuns.
Great acting, portrayal of Anna played by Agata Trzebuchowska. I would give it all five star if it wasn't for, in my opinion, a lack of a better historic context for an American audience, especially for younger people. Although the fact that soc-real Poland of fifties/sixties was very 'Orwellian-like' is totally irrelevant to this story, but it could help to better mark the time line of circumstances, regardless.",1420329600,,971,4.855421686746988

Its been a long time coming for me to find a film whose every aspect enamors me so much that I lay awake at night, a lover recalling the beauty of his beloved. Though my experience of you lasted less than two hours (an economical 80 minutes actually), I remain smitten to my core.  Allow me as I count the ways. If a thing of beauty is a joy forever, then an exquisitely photographed film is no exception, as you will always appear exactly as you do, your graceful features never to diminish. Every marvel of your simple yet elegant form produces awe in me. Shot in b&w in such a way as to remind us of a new wave French film from the fifties (perhaps Bresson or early Truffaut), your stark images are made meaningful through contrast and composition. I long to peruse your every image again and againto live inside the pages of your every frame like a protagonist finding refuge in a revelatory memory. In other words, I gladly leave this world to revel in your rapture. Nothing captures bleakness as beautifully as b&w photography, and so when your oft times bleak landscapes are presented to express your characters spiritual estrangement, you quietly connect psychic subtext to the physical world, merging spirit with place to locate me in a double world.  A reflection of trees rolling over a windshield while just behind a bewildered face stares out as though to ask, Where is my place in all this? and with that look I am joined by your dislodging.
Your soundtrack of Coltrane and Mozart raises the hair on my arms and flavors your atmosphere in such a way as to bring who I am and who I wish to be together in one place.
Your words, which flow from the honesty of your character(s) so effortlessly and without apology even when they are detached or determined to have out, how carefully they assemble your eloquent urgency.
The many faces, which make up your continence, each so expressively without nonsense or tricks reminds me that each moment in life presents a purity I may have confidence in.
Your depth, which pits God and Godless with the tenderness and non-judgement of a child destined for wisdom, astounds and humbles me.
Ida, I adore you. I want to introduce you to my friends and family and hold you in my heart forever.

1171832,3,8379891716,"""Ida"" 2013 directed by Pawe Pawlikowski, is a brief (80 minutes) black-and-white, two-character movie. It is very quiet; you barely need to read the subtitles to follow the slender plot. It is so slow-moving that three times while watching it I suspected that technical difficulties had stopped the film. No; the actor and scene were merely all but frozen. This almost anorexic film takes on huge, sweeping issues: Polish-Jewish relations, Christian-Jewish relations, identity, the Holocaust, guilt, karma, Communist oppression of Poles, and the Catholic vow of chastity for nuns. Reviewers have blessed ""Ida"" with glowing reviews, insisting that this minimalist film makes big points through allusion and suggestion.

I doubt this. I think most viewers who don't know a heck of a lot about Poland will be baffled and bored by this movie. I think sometimes less is not more but really is less. I think ""Ida"" would have been a better film with a more tightly focused and more developed screenplay. Words can lead to misunderstanding but words are what we've got to work with. ""Too many notes!"" a cinematic emperor criticized a Mozart work. ""Ida"" suffers from ""too few words.""

In spite of its heavy subject matter, what struck me most about ""Ida,"" and what I will most remember, is its visual beauty. ""Ida"" is shot in black and white, and it takes place in undistinguished Polish settings in the depth of winter. You see snow-covered fields, corner bars, dingy buildings with cracked plaster. The careful composition of each shot, and the cinematographers' lovely handling of different gradations of light and shadow, transform otherwise dreary locales into works of art.

""Ida"" is about a teenage girl in Poland in the 1960s. She has spent her entire life in convent, and she is about to take her final vows. Her mother superior orders her to meet, for the first time, with Wanda Gruz, her sole living relative. Ida does so, and Wanda informs Ida that she is Jewish. Wanda and Ida travel to the village where their Jewish family hid from the Nazis in a barn. Ida's parents and brother were murdered. Wanda and Ida travel to their grave. This new information causes Ida to reassess her commitment to becoming a nun.

Agata Trzebuchowska plays Ida. Press accounts claim she is not a professional actress. She is given very little to say or do. The camera spends much time gazing at her youth and beauty. A male director ogling a gorgeous young amateur  the director's ""discovery""  whom he does not allow to speak, act or develop as something other than an artistic composition  distracted and offended me. Enough already with females as marionettes of male geniuses.

Agata Kulesza plays Wanda Gruz, Ida's aunt. Wanda was a judge under Communism. Wanda participated in the persecution of Polish anti-Nazi fighters in the post-war era. Wanda is based on the real life Helena Woliska-Brus. Wolinska-Brus participated in the Stalinist persecution of genuine heroes who had fought the Nazis and aided Jews. She was a monster.

The Wanda Gruz of ""Ida"" is not a monster. She is the most fascinating and memorable character in the film. She is the one burning ember in an otherwise inert, black-and-white landscape of monosyllabic Polish peasants and the boring Miss Goody Twoshoes, Ida. Wanda is complex. She is a highly tormented character who drinks, smokes, is sexy and sexually promiscuous, and reveals her superior intelligence through her sarcasm. In the scene where Wanda and Ida are brought to their relatives' graves by a morally compromised Polish peasant, Wanda reveals deep grief. You cannot help but like Wanda.

In a movie that touches on WW II and the Holocaust, I was sickened by how sympathetic Wanda was. Would Pawlikowski have been able to get away with placing a likeable Nazi at the center of such a film? If not, then why did he place a sexy and lovable Stalinist murderess at the center of his film? Answer: Because Stalinist murder does not carry the same taint as Nazi murder. Problem: the millions tortured and murdered in the name of Communism are just as dead as the millions murdered in the name of Nazism.

There are volumes of history and hours of debate transcripts behind the issues that ""Ida"" touches on. Most filmgoers will have no idea of any of this and much of the film will pass right over their heads. Reviews on the International Movie Database reveal this. Sincere and intelligent filmgoers were unmoved and befuddled by ""Ida."" Key pieces of information are never articulated: Poland was occupied by Nazis. Nazis persecuted and murdered Polish Catholics as well as Jews. Some Poles betrayed Jews. Some Poles were heroic and saved Jews. Many Poles were neither heroic nor villainous. Everyone was afraid for his or her life. A thousand years of history preceded the Nazi era, and every word and gesture has history behind it. There are no easy answers.

""Ida"" falls into predictable traps. Its Jewish character, Wanda, is fascinating and verbal, worldly and morally compromised. Its Catholic character is pure, but boring and simpleminded. These stereotypes are trite and unworthy of any serious film.

Towards the end of the film, one major character leaves the movie and the other character is left to pursue an underdeveloped and aborted subplot that serves no end except to add extra minutes to the runtime.",1420243200,5,5344,4.957541899441341
1171833,4,8379891716,"A friend recommended this film.. For the first 20 minutes, I wondered if this film was for me. Poland in the 1960's under the last of the Communist rule is bleak and cold. The film shot in black and white brings a sort of chill to the entire film that is difficult to recover. Pawel Pawlikowski, the director and co-writer, returned to Poland to make this film.

Anna, played by Agata Trzebokowska, is an 18-year-old orphan, raised in a convent and is prepared to take her vows when her Mother Superior insists that first she meet her one relative. That is Aunt Wanda, played by Agneta Kulesza, a former prosecutor with a Communist Party rank. Her life is one of smoking, drinking and one night stands. Wanda also has a secret, and when Anna arrives, all of the old wounds rise to the surface. She wants nothing to do with Anna, but changes her mind, and she picks up Anna at the bus station. Wanda tells Anna that her real name is Ida, and that she is Jewish and her parents were killed during World War II.

Wanda decides to help Anna find her parent's burial site, which brings them to a small village. Through conversation with a local, Anna and Wanda find her parent's burial site and other surprises. 'Ida' is a film of simplicity, shot in black and white with sub-titles. Wanda's relevations opens more doors than Anna can deal with at first. The new people she meets open a new world, and Anna must decide if she is prepared to make those steps. Astonishing acting in this film.

The film brings us back to the world of the 1960's, but not a world known to me.

An adoptee myself, I can tell you that the day you get to meet your birth family - after a lifetime of living with the adoptive family - is simultaneously shocking but strangely lacking in a visceral connection. The birth family members you meet may as well be strangers on an elevator. You see them as if they were on TV where all you need to do to return to your ""real life"" is to change a channel. Unlike an adoptee finding a birth family, however, Ida must feel locked away forever from roots, most of which she cannot even picture. I kept wanting to hear the voices of her dead parents commenting on Ida's new life.

1171898,4,8379891716,"Pawlikowski's Ida is a sombre black and white film set in 60s Poland. Anna (AgataTrzebuchowska) is asked by the prioress of the orphanage convent where she is about to take her vows as a novice nun,to visit her unknown aunt Wanda in Lodz before she takes them . She has been raised in the Catholic convent where she was abandoned as a baby. Wanda (Kulesza) is a former state prosecutor and Communist Party member, jaded,alcoholic, promiscuous. Wanda is unwilling to take Anna away from the orphanage, because she would not be able to provide her with a happy life,when it's really her selfishness and her loose morals,she cares more about. She's devastated by the loss of her sister.

It is revealed to Anna that she is Jewish,called Ida and her parents,the Lebensteins, were killed during WWII.The film is a road trip in which Anna seeks her true identity. Wanda and Anna travel through bleak Polish countryside to the village where her parents lived. A man called Skiba is living in her parent's old house,he pretends not to know the people who once lived there and says he doesn't know where his father Syzmon is,who hid his parents during the war. The cinematography of the scenes is painterly, balanced by the use of natural light. The history and weight of the past is shown by the way each character is reduced to the corner or bottom of a frame in the unusual 1.37:1 aspect ratio and static camera. Sometimes the subtitles get in the way.

Wanda wants Anna/Ida to know her own ethnic identity,and to not sacrifice her carnal identity,before she has experienced it. She has never explored secular life,she is institutionalized,she does not know how to behave in the outside world-although she is given a measure of respect as a nun-she's never questioned the convent's practices because they are all she has ever known. Is the ""family"" of the convent to be her spiritual home or will she find fulfilment through the reality of her family's suffering? I get to feel she decides as a Christian what to do with her parents remains and what to do with the rest of her life,after briefly experiencing sexual love with a man,the saxophonist, who shows her a life she might live.

All the passion and energy is shown by Wanda,Kuleza's performance is riveting, plugging her emotional void with booze, sex, cigarettes and secular Communism. Her sharpness is good at unearthing latent anti-semitism. Anna is the axis around which the film turns,watchful,careful,marvelling at her aunt's repartee,when dealing with most of the people they meet as this odd couple. There is an attempt to create an existentialist new wave atmosphere in the jazz night club which seems a little unreal. Anna's final flight from Lodz recalls the end of The Third Man. My favourite black and white film since Inside Llewellyn Davis.

As Ida searches for her family's remains, she begins to question her decision to become a nun. As Wanda says, she has never explored secular life. That is why she laughs at the dinner table despite (presumably) never havingdone so before. She is no longer institutionalized. She has seen the world and needs to decide who she is on her own. Ultimately, she decides to be the religious, instead of the secular, person--but she does so on her own terms.",1419552000,,3260,4.836917562724015

1171929,4,8379891716,"This is one of my favorite movies of the year, albeit one of the few I've seen.  One of the most striking things about it was its black and white cinematography.  Ordinarily I find this pretentious in any movie made after 1965, but it works here because of the bleak mood of the movie.  Another notable but less obvious feature is the surfeit of dialogue.  Most of my favorite movies have well-developed characters and usually characters are developed through dialogue.  In Ida, much is communicated non-verbally with a facial expression or gesture. And even when the characters do converse, much is communicated in a few words.

Ida is a road movie of a sort.  The two main characters take off together in search of the burial site of Ida's family and her road companion, aunt and only surviving relation, Wanda.  Like most road movies, the two characters are very different.  Ida is a convent raised orphan, who as the movies opens, plans to join the order of nuns who raised her and take the vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  However, before she is allowed to  take her final vows, her Mother Superior tells her she needs to meet her only surviving relative, her mothers sister Wanda.

Wanda belongs to a different order so to speak, the Communist Party and enjoys many of the perks of membership, including a nice apartment and a car.  While Wanda may have taken some sort of vow of obedience to the Party, she definitely has not taken vows of poverty and chastity.  It is Wanda who tells Ida about her family and Jewish parentage.

Philosophically and temperamentally very different, the two take off together to find out about how their family members died and where they are buried. Initially the two find their differences lead to conflict and anger at each other.  By the end, they are able to overcome these differences and in their way bond over the experiences they share.

Im not sure if this is a critique of the actress or the intent of the director, but I found Ida to be an enigma especially compared with Wanda.  With few exceptions, her face rarely showed emotion, and perhaps thats what made her so attractive to Lis, the saxophone player that Wanda and Ida picked up on the road.  This mysterious quality certainly played out at the end of the movie when Ida decides to experience a world that will be closed off to her if she takes her final vows.  Im not puzzled so much about the decision at the end but more about the why she made it.

As we learn early in the movie, Ida was born a Jew.  Her parents died at the hands of one of their neighbors.  Ida survived because her parent's killer decided to spare her life because being an infant and female (and thus not circumcised) her ethnicity could remain a secret.

Ida is a convent raised orphan who survived the holocaust only because as an infant (and female), one of her neighbors leaves here with a local priest, who takes her to an orphanage run by an order of nuns.  When the movie starts, Ida, who apparently knows very",1419120000,2,3008,4.567164179104478

1171933,5,8379891716,"In 1962 Poland a 17-year-old novitiate, Anna/Ida (Agata Trzebuchowska in her film debut), placed in a convent orphanage during the 1940s German occupation, learns she has a living family relative, her Aunt Wanda (Agata Kulesza), a bitter, disillusioned, and hard-drinking communist judge and former Stalinist prosecutor. From her aunt Ida learns she is Jewish and that her parents and other family members were killed in the Holocaust. Wanda and Ida set out to find the specific circumstances of their family members' deaths. Their discovery leads to difficult and tragic choices.

Director Pawel Pawlikowski's ""Ida"" was selected as the finest Polish film of 2013 and is a finalist for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film for 2014. Both Trzebuchowska as the enigmatic Ida and Kulesza are OUTSTANDING in their roles. Bravo! Bravo! Lovely Polish star, Joanna Kulig, steals several scenes with her cameo role as a jazz singer. The icy black and white cinematography of Lukasz Zal and Ryszard Lenczewski is simply jaw-dropping. Pawlikowski and art director, Jagna Dobesz, capture the grim, gray despair of Soviet Poland to a tee

""Ida"" is a poignant story which dares to explore Polish anti-Semitism. Credit Pawlikowski and other Polish artists and scholars for  daring to demythologize the popular and unyielding stereotype of ethnic-Catholic Poles as solely victims and martyrs during the war. Unfortunately, American viewers will have no knowledge of the rancorous national debate and soul-searching over the issue of anti-Semitism that has gripped Poland beginning with the publication of ""Neighbors"" by Jan Gross in 2001. Despite the reconciliatory efforts of some Poles and Jews, bitter feelings remain on both sides. For information regarding modern Polish-Jewish relations see the excellent ""Poland's Threatening Other: The Image of the Jew from 1880 to the Present"" by Joanna Michlic.

""Ida"" definitely does not resemble the typical Spielberg-Disney fare Americans have been weaned on. Millennials and others with sound-byte attention spans and no appreciation of subtlety should do themselves a favor and just skip this. The large number of 1, 2, and 3-star reviews for this film is a sad commentary on the dumbing down of American culture.

This film ends with sadness, tragedy, and resignation and speaks to the human condition. Is there any hope for us? Yes! But humankind's redemption comes neither from the empty religious ritualism and legalism of Anna's/Ida's Catholic convent or from the socialist utopia once envisioned by Wanda. Salvation comes only by the grace of God through faith in the Savior, Jesus Christ.

1171937,5,8379891716,"Set in early 60s Poland, this brooding monochrome portrait of an innocent soul at large in a cold and unforgiving world centres upon 18-year-old Anna (screen newcomer Agata Trzebuchowska), a novitiate nun who is sent to spend time with her only living relative, Aunt Wanda (Agata Kulesza), prior to taking her holy vows. An abrasive presence with a desperation-tinged taste for alcohol and men, Wanda was once a Stalinist state prosecutor who admits to having blood on her hands, something she acknowledges with a mixture of pride and contempt. Significantly, Wanda is Jewish, a revelation that causes Anna (nee Ida) to embark upon an excavation of her own family history, revealing awful wartime truths, long buried, now painfully exhumed.

Described by director Pawel Pawlikowski, previously best known for My Summer of Love, as a film about identity, family, faith, guilt, socialism and music, Ida blends its personal and political meditations with clarity and grace. Largely consisting of compact scenes, many of which cut on a jarring musical juxtaposition, the film constantly places its characters at the bottom/in the corner of its archaic 4x3 frame, suggesting that they are but bit-part players in a much larger drama, their faces struggling to be seen in the landscape of the larger picture.

Certainly, theres a story here that goes far beyond the individual; an account of an appalling historic tragedy of which we were graphically reminded last week by the soul-shaking Night Will Fall. This is a world riddled with guilt; cruel and unrelenting. Yet as Anna/Ida increasingly comes to define her own destiny, so her place within the frame alters, Pawlikowski gradually allowing her to find her own space within his arresting vision, compassion cutting through the tragedy, sympathy and strength tempering the bleakness. For all its sombre subject matter, there is warmth here too; personal, musical, spiritual.",1419033600,,1923,5.281045751633987

However, I really respect the way it's shot, and just how much thought went into the mise en scene as well as how the actors block the shot. Also, this may be one of the most brilliant and efficient screenplays I've ever seen, saying so much with so very little. Thematically, it goes deeper than most films about religion. We have plenty of movies which are about religion, or they're about something but they're REALLY about religion. This movie, however, is about religion, but NOT really. There's way more going on under the surface than just Ida's struggle with her faith in Catholicism.

1171965,2,8379891716,"This film really doesn't work for a foreign audience because it fails to provide even a whisper of the necessary historical background and context. The movie starts in the early 1960s when Ida, a nun, receives word that her sole remaining relative, a rather odd aunt who works as a public prosecutor, wants to see her. Shortly after they meet the aunt reveals shocking news: Ida is in fact Jewish and only survived the war because she was given away to a Polish family as an infant. And what war was that? Oh yes, World War Two, when 90 percent of Poland's 3.5 million Jews died, some murdered by Poles or betrayed to the Germans by Poles. No one talks about this openly in early 1960s but it lies there as a dank rotting secret under the ground. The whole historical significance of this film will be missed completely by those with no knowledge of what happened from 1939 to 1945. Ida and the aunt set out to find out what happened to her parents and stumble across a jazz musician who takes rather a fancy to the newly-minted nun. I won't give away the ending, save to say it is contrived and unconvincing. The characters do not come to life at all. This was a big disappointment.",1418601600,4,1183,4.431192660550459

1172006,5,8379891716,"How many movies is it possible to make about the persecution of European Jews by the Nazis?  If ""Ida"" is any indication, the answer is an ""infinite"" number--or at least as many films as there are people discovering their own Jewish connections while exploring their past through popular sites like ""Ancestry.""  Or as many films as there are school children who are stirred by the suffering, courage and heroism of a tragedy that, even for many Americans, has a greater impact than the more distant--and ""spread out""--horror of slavery.

These two periods of the horror and shame of two different nations--Germany and the U.S.A.-- are strangely connected in this beauitfully composed, economical (in every respect), and memorable ""little"" film.  The film is the antithesis of French New Wave cinema which, in the hands of directors like Godard and Truffaut, favored quick camera set-ups, frenetic pacing and jagged editing.  Students of French cinema are more likely to recognize in Trzebuchowska's deliberative, ultra-resourceful approach the influence of the ascetic and spiritual cinema of Robert Bresson.

Every shot has a purpose yet, unlike the films of Ingmar Bergman, the spectator need not feel he's being ""challenged"" by the director to decode the shot, mining for gold (though graveyard digging is a notable physical action in the movie).  The shots are satisfying in their own right: the composition, the grey-scale, the duration of the shot--all are satisfying and complete.  We feel comfident that we are being shown life, characters, and actions through the eyes of filmmaking artist who knows how to make us see as he sees.

As the leading character, Joanna Kulig has a face that the camera loves, even when much of it--including her hair--is covered by her nun's garb.  But in this film with minimal dialogue, the spectator must listen attentively to the sound-track to understand Ida's ""double-transformation.""  During the story's journey (both literal and metaphoric), Ida's ""worldly,"" chain-smoking aunt, Wanda Gruz (Agata Kulesza), is happy to pick up a hitchhiking musician, who plays alto saxophone, an instrument she praises for its sensual, soothing qualities.  Although Ida expresses little outward interest in her aunt's preferences, she will return to the scene of Wanda's pleasures as she discovers they are her own.

The first critical step in Ida's identification with her partying, hard-drinking aunt occurs when she hears the saxophonist play the haunting strains of ""Naima,"" perhaps the most acclaimed jazz standard by the seminal, spiritual, frequently ""sainted"" tenor saxophonist John Coltrane.  Later, she will return to hear the alto saxophonist play Coltrane's ""Equinox"" and express her love of this music directly to its maker.  For the viewer who understands the origins of jazz, the connection between Ida's Jewish Heritage and the African-American music to which she is drawn is unmistakably illuminating and strong.  Moreover, her connection purely with the music rather than its particular maker (who admittedly is a far cry from the artistry of Louis, Bird, and Trane) helps us understand her actions in the last 10 minutes of the film.

The isolated and ascetic Ida comes to understand that she is more like her aunt than she had initially imagined.  But now she must dig deeper, both as a way of ""testing"" her discovery and of paying her deepest respects to a person with whom she had imagined she shared no personal, spiritual affinity.  Ultimately, she discovers that she can think and feel as her aunt but avoid the self-destructive consequences by returning to her true home.  No mention of love occurs in her ""one-night stand"" with the musician.  The only love that is vital pertains to the music that attracts first her aunt and now Ida.  Therein likes a beauty created out of the suffering of those who have been wronged against--both Jewish and African-American--and that is the impulse that unites the two women.

As in every film that follows the ""hero's journey"" (an archetypal pattern popularized by Joseph Campbell and taught in all script-writing classes), Ida will complete her journey and return ""home.""  But she is not the same person we saw at the beginning of the film--far from it!  She now understands her journey and its destination.  She no longer is God's servant by ""accident"" but by a ""calling"" and a choice.

[Recommended reading: For anyone who is unclear about the connections discussed in this review, James Baldwin's ""Sonny's Blues"" is highly recommended as a short story about the narrator's attempt to understand his self-destructive musician-brother.  Perhaps no better piece has been written about jazz, its origins, and the redemptive role of music as epiphany and confirmation of one's own vocation in life.]",1417996800,,4792,5.21251629726206

I was not, however, impressed with the plot of the movie. It has the characteristics of a modern short story, with no uplift.

This was done ostensibly to protect her from the Jewish persecution during the second World War. She has a flat personality with very little passion.  She is about to make her vows to become a nun and permanent resident of the convent when the head nun insists that she make the trip to visit her only living relative, her aunt. Life becomes a little more interesting for Ida as she experiences some of the more sordid aspects of existence as depicted by her aunt.  There is what seems like a pointless process of discovering where her family is buried and who killed them.  Through all of this Ida seems like a nonentity with little emotional attachment.  Even when romance surfaces and Ida experiences physical affection for the first time, she isn't moved and is drawn back to the almost nonexistence waiting for her at the convent..",1417219200,,998,4.553072625698324

The film is about the events in Poland following the end of the second world war.  Without giving anything away, I would just say that obviously some things that happened then were quite horrible, and this movie aims to give cinematic life to some of them.

The film is first-class.  I saw it around the same time that I saw Umberto D, which I said in another review was on a par with Bergman's best films.  I would give the nod to Ida as being a slightly greater film than those films, although if pushed, it would be difficult to say why Ida is a better film than the Virgin Spring or vice versa, since they are both gut-wrenching, masterful classics.",1416960000,,852,4.529411764705882

1172109,5,8379891716,"In 1960's Poland, Sarah, an orphan, is to take her final vows as a nun. But before she does, her Mother Superior urges her to visit her only known relative, one Aunt Wanda, in the city. Upon meeting her for the first time, Sarah comes face to face with a booze-addled, chain-smoking cynic. Nonchalantly, Wanda offers up some shocking information about her niece: Sarah's real name is ""Ida"" and she is Jewish. Her parents were killed in the war and she was sheltered in the convent for protection. At Sarah's insistence, the two of them go on a journey to find her family's resting place.

Wanda asks her niece, ""What if you go there and discover there is no God?"" At heart, IDA is about this pair's relationship to the world. Committing her life to the convent was perhaps an easier feat when that was all Sarah knew. She emerges in the film as a blank slate on which the world will impress itself as the narrative unfolds. Quite clearly the world-weary, promiscuous Wanda is set up as her opposite, mocking her niece's unworldliness despite constantly falling victim to her own bad habits. Postwar Poland plays heavily into the film's thematic content. The entire population of the country seems to be thinned out, as does its individuals' capacity for joy and hope. Sarah and Wanda's arcs do not take us where we might expect; what the film has to say about virtue and vice, of guilt and the loss of innocence, of crisis of faith, isn't as neat as a conventional film, but that's one of IDA's biggest strengths.

IDA is a quiet and paced film, but it's lean and efficient storytelling. There is an emphasis on sound design, a focus on the little sounds of the world that recalls Robert Bresson. The film doesn't force emotions on us; the camera frequently hangs back in the master (even during some pivotal character moments) and there is a refraining from non-diegetic music, save for the ending. Most strikingly, the director chooses to place its subjects at the low extremities of the frame, leaving them dwarfed by the vast spaces that surround them. In this way, the characters' isolation is accented by their spatial insignificance and we are constantly reminded of the world's influence on them. The film is shot on black and white and in the more ""square"" Academy Ratio (1:33). The monochrome speaks to the setting and the film's themes: it feels stark, cold, dreary, murky, and gray. One also can't help but get the sense that this film was produced a half century ago as there is little in it that gives it away as a contemporary production.

Effortlessly, IDA manages to balance its minimalism with subject matter that is intensely complex, a rare and refreshing accomplishment. The film is on Netflix in its original Polish with English subtitles.",1416873600,,2761,4.747916666666667

And the story which takes place in post-world war II Poland, although sad and poignant, is incredibly uplifting. Agata Trzebuchowska who plays a novitiate in a convent is sublime. She has a luminance that transcends the delicate greys of the Polish winter scenes. Ida's aunt, played by the veteran Polish actor Agneta Kulesza, is the perfect foil for Ida's religious detachment. The music is subdued and delicate, perfectly in tune with the strange not-quite-greyness in which the film is shot. I was enormously touched by the gentle humour which punctuated both image and dialogue. I believe the story is about choices. Those we choose and those that are made for us.

The story is pretty straightforward, nothing groundbreaking, but it's well-told and the understated performaces (particularly from the lead) fit perfectly into the mood of the film. The music (the film has no score, but often the characters either perform music or play records) was perfect, as well. I hope they release a soundtrack. The piano over the closing credits, an adaptation of a Bach chorale, was so sweet that I actually sat through the credits, even though Marvel wasn't going to reveal their next villain at the end of them.

1172258,5,8379891716,"European films thankfully avoid the ""Hollywood"" ending, the ""bang bang,"" the meaningless chatter. ""Ida"" is a Polish film shot in stunning black and white which plays off Catholic religiosity and self denial against the killing of Polish Jews in a montage of a meaningful script,  unexpected occurrences and the artistic camerawork worthy of the photographic assembling of Walker Evans, Paul Strand or Andre Kertesz.

The two Polish actresses, Anna (Agata Trzebuchowska) and her Jewish aunt, ""Red Wanda""(Agata Kulesza), are superb. The minimalist lens and script of Director Pawel Pawlikowski dominate; one memorable scene; a naked ""hung over"" Wanda in bed showing only her thin back and shoulder blades; all preparatory to tragedy. The scene dripping with sensuality does not prepare you for what comes next. Set this off against the visual rawness of this hard edged, pushy, chain-smoking former judge and the viewer finds contrasts unseen on the screen.

Pawlikowski's intriguing angles, filtering and innovative facial screen shots should be required viewing in any American film school. Music Box Films is to be commended for bringing this beautiful movie to American audiences.",1415232000,18,1182,5.483516483516484
1172259,4,8379891716,"This movie came out to great acclaim and was hailed as a kind of masterpiece, and there is much to admire in it. But in my judgment, it suffers from a very serious flaw. I'll get to that, but let me mention its real strengths first. It is beautifully photographed, with the camera held unflinchingly still in many of the longer shots -- and it's through the images that we understand Poland in 1962 -- the country scenes are stark and empty (it IS winter, to be fair), and the urban scenes suggest a place that is still -- 17 years later -- not fully recovered from World War 2. The buildings are drab, there's little sign of life on the streets, and the sense of depression comes through (I should say that it's shot in black-and-white, and that adds to the sense of gloom and anomie). ""Not fully recovered from World War 2"" could also be said to be the condition of the central character, Wanda Gruz (Agata Kulezsa), an early-middle-aged woman who was a powerful judge in the high palmy days when the Communists were wreaking their will right after the war. Red Wanda, she was called -- she sentenced people to death in those days. Now, in a time of thawing relations with the West (we hear the jazz and pop music), she seems to be downgraded to a trivial civil court -- she drinks too much and picks up men when she feels like it. She's a mess, and it is to her that her niece, a young novice, comes prior to taking her vows, because her Mother Superior has asked her to make contact with Wanda, her only relative, who has up to this point ignored requests from the convent to come see her niece. It's clear that Wanda wants no part of this -- and she almost immediately tells the novice that her name is not Anna, as she was called in the convent, but Ida -- and that she is Jewish.

As the movie goes on, we begin to understand Wanda's reluctance to have anything to do with her niece. Doing so means facing again the fact of her sister's death, the fact of her own survival, and the reasons for Ida's survival. The central part of the movie is the trip to the countryside where Ida's family used to live to see if they can find where her parents were killed and buried. Suffice it here to say that they find the place, and the scene in which they do -- thanks mainly to Kulezsa -- is the emotional high point of the film. Wanda's behavior thereafter makes us understand not only why she behaves as she does but why she became after the war the kind of person she became. All of this is done with great economy -- more by images than by speech -- and it's harrowing.

The main problem with the movie is Ida herself -- Agata Trzebuchowska, a young woman with no previous acting experience and so lacking in affect in her demeanor throughout that she begins to seem passive-aggressive to a disturbing degree, and I don't think that's what was wanted. Yes, I get it -- she's inexperienced and shy and devoted to Jesus -- but it's a one-note performance. Some viewers have found the performance moving -- I found it off-putting. What should have been a striking sequence near the end -- which I interpreted as her paying a kind of tribute to her gruff, troubled aunt -- shows her in the same affect-less mode. It's not that I wanted to see her show animation -- I just wanted her to work expressively, and the uniform impassivity was just too much for me. Still -- at 80 minutes, and with a great performance by Kulezsa and a great look, this is well worth seeing.",1415145600,11,3465,4.337442218798151

1172275,4,8379891716,"For me Agata Kulesza's portrayal of the alcoholic 40-something communist aunt was the highlight of the movie.  Her life showed the tragedy of World War II and how some Poles treated the Jews.  Ida's situation seemed more like a sub plot to me.  Also, Ida's character was so inert so as to be zombie-esque.  I got impatient with her mute face for seconds after she should have said something to interact like a normal human being.  I also didn't buy the personal transition that Ida would have had to make, going from the childish innocence of the convent to her interactions with the saxophone player, the drinking, etc.  This was 1961, and she was in a convent.  I didn't buy her transition, and then her reverting back to her habit and presumed return to the convent.  I don't think anyone of her supposed conviction would have acted that way.  That said, Aunt Wanda was superb in every way.  Kulesza so evoked the tragedy of both the war and communism after, and how the war never ended for the Jews or Poles who survived it.  Fantastic cinematography of a backward, yester-decade Poland.  The black and white really works.  Overall I very much liked this film and recommend it both artistically and historically for a very tragic and little known aspect of Eastern European history.",1413849600,3,1286,4.713004484304933
1172276,2,8379891716,"The trailer for Ida had me hooked immediately.  The glassy cinematography, the sullen stares, the instant mood, the subtitles!  This looked like it was going to be right up my alley.  I prayed that it come to a theater near me, but that never happens.  The reviews started to pour in and Oscar buzz was made and every critic was salivating over the film like it was some truly remarkable character study.  The prose was so rich with purpose, so rich with promise.  Finally, I got my hands on this film and rushed to get it into my DVD player.

And then nothing happened.

No, the DVD worked and the movie played, but, like, nothing happenedat all.

Im all for art house cinema, and Im all for a film that relies more on feeling than telling, but there was nothing to really be told here and the climax was so ridiculous in composition that it really made this not only a confused film, but a dumb one.  For a film that is not even an hour and a half long, this felt like an eternity, an eternity of staring at someone staring back at me, with no real depth (at least not when Agata Kulesza wasn't on the screen).  I tried so hard to care, to find the deeper meaning, to find the place where the soul of this film resided, and then the ending came and completely derailed (out of the blue, I might add) any sort of character it had built and basically left us with a ridiculous attempt at telling us something without saying anything at all.

This was like Pawel Pawlikowski (the writer/director of this film) watched the masterworks of Ingmar Bergman, digested all of the depth and just crapped out the elongated scenes and blank expressions that just do not work without the context.

Ida has no context.

Like I said, the premise is one rich in promise.  Anna is a young nun about to take her vows when she is told she must see Wanda, her only living relative, before she can proceed.  Anna, an orphan, was brought up in the convent and is not privy to her past.  When she meets Wanda she is informed of an atrocity that befell her family, a terrible tragedy that will shape the rest of her life.  This story really should have been engrossing, but it is so poorly conveyed that it winds up being miserably dull.

And then there is Agata Kulesza.  As Wanda, she evokes such internal turmoil, and when the tragedy is revealed, it is her reaction to, and subsequent derailing that brings the films only saving grace (you know, other than the stunning photography).  She completely melts into the film, taking the films obvious tone and atmosphere and actually doing something with it.  Her stares MEAN something.  What helps is that she actually does more than that, though.  Where the films lead, Agata Trzebuchowska, isn't really given anything to do but look off and contemplate (and then give us a ridiculous character arc in the last twenty minutes), Kuleszas performance bleeds out a deeper element to this film.  I only wish that it had been her story that remained the focus, because every time she left the screen I was aching for her to return.

Overall, I cant even like this movie, despite such a richly handled performance from Kulesza.  It had so much potential, but it was squandered in a lackluster development and a preposterous climax that left the film confused and ineffective.

Better to have gutted out any of Trzebuchowskas scenes without Kulesza, changed the name of the film to Wanda and submitted it as a short film.  Now THAT would have been worth watching (and rooting for come Oscar night).  If this wins the Oscar, itll be a shame.",1413849600,9,3561,4.527386541471048

The tragic fate of the one in the light of the other's betrayal proves this assumption to be wrong.

1172296,5,8379891716,"""Ida"" is one of more admirable films to come along on Amazon in a long while.  The two main characters played by the professional actress, Agata Kulesza, and the non-professional, Agata Trzebuchowska, who play Aunt Wanda and Anna/Ida respectively give outstandingly nuanced performances.  Ida is a novitiate preparing to take her sacred vows to enter into a convent for the rest of her life.  There seems to be unfinished business in her past life that preceded Ida's upbringing as a convent orphan, and her new reluctant association with her only relative, Aunt Wanda, results in her aunt's help in discovering Ida's Jewish roots.  Their quest for family history together creates a bond between the two vastly different personalities.  It also subjects Ida to unfamiliar lifestyles and temptations unlikely in a convent setting.  Ida is steadfast however, and abrupt plot changes test Ida's resolve to dedicate her life to spirituality.  The force of spirituality dominates this story and presents ironic overlays of past and present.  The youthful self-determination of Ida is not the least of these ironic portrayals.

Just a very strange vibe to the film.  Of course, Art must be experienced.  There is no way anyone could really explain this film.  Once you get the background, the process of the Journey and the conclusion, it is all pretty straight forward.  I don't understand what you are supposed to come away with after viewing this.  What - resolution that life outside the Convent is really course and gross.  Ida discovers this even after trying all the worldly things that life had to offer.  She was literally born and raised in a Convent and that is the Life-pattern that she has become.  The film is very austere and linear.  To me, that is.  I did not find any redeeming beauty or spiritual transcendence.  Just coming to terms with what this beautiful girl came to face with and beautifully dealing with it in a Christ-like fashion.  The film left me just spaced out with so much emotional content to process in 90 minutes.  It is a very quiet and elegantly filmed piece of work.  Unless you are in a really deep mood to watch a somber film, then I would say not to watch it.  Just know that it is very serious and contemplative.

The movie asks profound questions about our reasons for clinging to life, about survival, faith, guilt, and family bonds.

1172311,4,8379891716,"Poland, 1962. Anna (Agata Trzebuchowska), a novitiate in a convent, is told by her mother superior that she must meet her only living relative before she takes her vows. So the pretty but shy soon to be nun ventures from her convent with a broken, beaten up suitcase held together by a belt. When she arrives at her Aunt Wanda's apartment, she's greeted by a woman in her forties smoking a cigarette and wearing a bathrobe, her hair disheveled, while a man gets dressed in the background. Thus the film highlights the contrast between the sheltered Anna and her cynical, hard drinking, sexually promiscuous aunt. And right after meeting for the first time, Wanda tells Anna bluntly that she is Jewish by birth. Anna, it turns out, was born Ida Lebenstein, but having grown up in an orphanage, has no memory of her family and no idea that she is Jewish. Wanda doesn't know exactly what became of Anna's/Ida's family but assumes that they were murdered by their farming neighbors.

Eventually we will also learn more about Wanda's past. In the 1950s she was a famous prosecutor, known as Red Wanda for having sent ""enemies of the people"" to the firing squads. But in the present, De-Stalinization has hit Poland, she is minor magistrate, politically marginalized. Anna and Wanda decide to take a road trip to find out what happened to Ida's parents. Along the way they pick up a handsome hitchhiking musician (Dawid Ogrodnik). Eventually, aunt and niece will learn the terrible fate of their family.

The movie is enticing for most of the times, but the end (without revealing a lot of it) is quite unsatisfying. What the audience wants to know is whether, after the terrible revelations, Ida will leave or not her religious life. The director (SPOILERS AHEAD) takes the easiest choice: basically he gives us two endings with the two possibilities. As Wanda, Agata Kulesza dominates the screen, while director Pawel Pawlikowski deliberately keeps Anna/Ida under wraps as an enigma. Pawlikowski has some questionable artsy tendencies as a director, like using takes that are longer than needed or having the camera close up for several seconds on a character as he or she does nothing. And there are several unexplained bits in the movie, like why aunt Wanda didn't adopt Ida when she was a child, a time when Wanda was a very successful official. The stark black-and-white photography is a plus.",1405555200,3,2393,4.877149877149877

1172313,5,8379891716,"No need to delve into the story or acting, many reviewers have that nailed.

For me though, the imagery and, especially, sounds brought me to a whole new place.  The story necessarily puts us in a convent, where the old stone walls seem to make all sounds far more intense and sometimes very funny.  Large parts of the story take place on a farm, in a quiet hotel and a pub with a dance band; all of these places are brought alive from the sounds that come from them -- if only I knew Polish!

And of all things, I was really impressed by the sound effect of someone sleeping deeply, a light snore really.  We understand what it means, it's part of real world, but how often do we hear it in the movies?

The cars, so much thought went into it.  With so much of the action being, ""on the road"", you'd never have any reason to believe this wasn't shot other than in 1962 in Poland.  And the same goes with the trains, tractors, horse-drawn carts and, even, stereo systems of the time.",1404518400,60,983,4.247311827956989
1172314,4,8379891716,"Poland submitted this award-winning drama (16 wins) to the 2014 Seattle International Film Festival about a young nun who, in 1960s Poland, suddenly suspends her decision to take her vows, because she has just uncovered a long-hidden family secret that dates back to WWII. The Mother Superior wisely advises her to visit her aunt in a nearby village before she takes her final vows.

We watch:
  * Agata Trzebuchowska is Anna, the uninitiated young woman raised in a Catholic orphanage who has never been to the beach, never kissed a boy, and can't count her vows as a sacrifice if she doesn't know what she'll be missing.
  * Agata Kulesza is Wanda, our novitiate's Communist aunt, who breaks the news to her that she wasn't born a Catholic. Red Wanda is blunt and assertive in everything she does; she asks Anna, ""What if you find out there is no God?""
  * Dawid Ogrodnik plays Lis, a saxophone-playing hitchhiker who adores John Coltrane's ""Naima."" His family also suffered during the Holocaust because some of them were Gypsies. He's trying to avoid Army duty, so he observes that both of them are afraid to take vows. BTW do NOT miss him in ""Life Feels Good"" also from Poland!

We explore Poland's collective guilt over the fate of three million Polish Jews who disappeared during the holocaust (their property was quietly confiscated by local families), while we watch a devout young woman question (and then answer) her concerns about becoming a Catholic nun.

This effective PG-13 film is in black and white, so the expert use of light and shadow is obvious from the first frame. This is particularly effective in the nunnery.

I have a universal DVD player so I can play Region 1 or 2 or whatever else may be out there. The story is a compelling tale about postulant raised in a Roman Catholic convent as an orphan who is on the cusp of taking her final vows. Shortly before her marriage to Christ, the Mother Superior calls her into her office for a conference to inform her that she has been contacted by the girl's heretofore unknown aunt and Mother Superior strongly suggests that she visit the aunt before taking her final vows. The postulant discovers that her Aunt was born into a family of the Jewish faith and her deceased parents were murdered by a farmer shortly before the arrival of the Nazis who were destined to murder them. He took over their farm and claims it as his own. In exchange for the girl (Ida) and her aunt's promise to not dispute the ownership of the farm he promises to show them where he buried the family's bodies.

Did IDA win the Oscar solely because of the acting therein, or did the desire to increase the anti-Polish impact of IDA also play a part in the decision?

In any case, the unpleasant aspects of Polish-Jewish relations do not reduce to the standard Judeocentric dialectic of the Jewish victim and the villainous Catholic Pole, as exemplified by IDA. For details, see the comments under the review.
