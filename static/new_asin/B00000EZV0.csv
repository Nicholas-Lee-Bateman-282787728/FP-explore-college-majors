7907422,3,B00000EZV0,"This video is a collection of three short films about the role of women during WWII.  Each is heavy in propaganda, though the last is saved by Katherine Hepburn's narration.
While the video's tape quality was good,  the source was average.  Don't be surprised at the picture quality, as the  film had deteriorated a great deal before it was transferred to tape.  The  sound has suffered, too.
This particular video isn't meant for everyone;  however, if you are interested in the attitudes of the average person, and  how propaganda films were geared to ""guide"" those attitudes, then  I suggest you order a copy now. It is a good choice for a historian's or  feminist's video library.",961977600,4,684,4.818965517241379
