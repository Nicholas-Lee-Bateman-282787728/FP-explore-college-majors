6991379,2,B00SLH734K,"Just finished watching ""The Last Straight Man"" released by TLA Releasing.
I'm going to get in so much trouble on many different levels for this review, so I might as well get started.
As I was watching ""The Last Straight Man,"" I was reminded of the old Alan Alda movie ""Same Time Next Year;"" only ""The Last Straight Man"" almost - almost mind you - crosses the line from soft-core porn movie into a hard-core movie.  While plenty is implied and nothing too much is shown, there were plenty of times that stopped the DVD and gave careful consideration as to if I wanted to continue watching it.  My strict rule is that I will NOT watch and will NOT review pornographic movies.
Now in all fairness, while I'm not a prude; but there are limits to gratiotious nudity and vouyeristic sex - even if its ""simulated"".
So I'm deducting two stars from my review right now.  As readers know, I'm not in the habit of rewarding shock value stimulation; amongst other poor choices/decisions in the creative process.
PRUDE ALERT:  The opening scene with the female stripper and how she picks up quarters from a nose - NOT shown - is going to offend a lot of people,and probably gross them out BIG TIME!
""The Last Straight Man""  is a dramadey about Lewis and Cooper who decided, on the eve of Cooper's wedding night to take their relationship as best friends to the next level - spurred on a bit by shots of whiskey.
CONFESSION TIME: The first dallance between Cooper and Lewis brought to mind when me and a friend from college[who like Jeff-of-the-20th Century isn't on Facebook] were horsing and wrestling around in my apartment and we fell on my bed.  After a minute of nervous giggling, we quickly got up and he left to go study in the library.  He told me years later that he regretted that nothing happened and I told him that if anything had happened, it would have only been a one time event that wouldn't have changed the nature of our friendship. [Of course, I would have preferred that he hadn't had brought this moment of our shared past up in front of his wife.]
Sadly, the only real growth between Cooper and Lewis, brillantly potrayed by Mark Cirillo and Scott Sell, comes near the end of the movie when Lewis realises he has nothing - unlike Cooper who has a wife and child.
Otherwise, I felt I was watching a movie about two bored friends who have nothing else better to do having sex with each other.
ANOTHER CONFESSION TIME:  Jeff H. actually watched the trailer of ""The Last Straight Man"" on YouTube with me prior to its release on DVD.  ""It looks bad Joseph,"" he said.  And he was right because the vouyerstic sex scences are a big turn off.
Sooooo...my verdict:
""The Last Straight Man"" has it's moments where it shines as a brilliant look at friendship and the nature of sexuality and love.  Yet, those moments are downed out by two naughty men getting their jollies.
Recommended only if you want to see sex between a gay man and his straight friend.
Two Stars.",1426982400,4,2966,4.514925373134329
6991380,4,B00SLH734K,"After being threatened  by an Amazon administrator for telling the TRUTH....I had vowed not to write another review. However, this film is remarkable in that it deserves some honest commentary.

As a man whose sexually partners over several years have been 80% ""straight,"" I was drawn to this title and wondered how the issue would be dealt. First,let's get past the poorly written and filmed opening of a bachelor party and the initial exchange between the two extremely attractive leads. The party could have been stage much better and less repulsive, and the first exchange of the ""game of questions"" be tween the couple was simply unrealistic, lacked authenticity, and was lame.

The remainder of the film is EXCELLENT ! There is a slice of real life in every line delivered, every part of the evolutionary relationship, and the the final twist of hopelessness and settling in past decisions, good or bad.

Sadly, many men make these decisions and live the rest of their lives as a big lie, dishonest with themselves and the people who love them. This film is art, for art's sake, and huge dose of reality. I've lived it with too many ""straight"" men. Rent or buy the film, avoid the married men...why, because they are MARRIED and not to you. Denial is a serious DIS-EASE!",1426464000,21,1276,4.786363636363636
6991381,4,B00SLH734K,"The synopsis is that on the night before he gets married to a woman Cooper has a bachelor party and gets a bit squiffy. Then after all their friends go he and his best friend Lewis (who is bi) stay on to play a game of truth and have some slammers. After the questions take on a sexual vibe - they start to `experiment' anyway as the sleeve notes say they get it on and then agree to meet every year for a bit of the same.

This is supposed to be set over a twelve year period but we only get to see them every so often during that time. They change and the relationship develops over that time as indeed does the whole dynamic of their friendship and bedroom activity.

This is not a porno, there is some nudity but the sex is of the simulated sort. The real strength here is the character development and the quality of the acting - especially so from Mark Cirillo as Lewis and there are some touching moments (no pun intended). The limitations of budget are clear to be seen -  it is for the most part filmed in the same hotel room over the entire period and this has to be the only hotel room in the world that never gets a make over during that time. It is also a slow burner which needs to be borne with and despite being described as a comedy; it only raised a smile for me on occasion. Despite that I was carried along by the story and was not disappointed for having watched all the way through.",1426377600,17,1404,4.098181818181819
6991382,5,B00SLH734K,"I have been a fan of Mark Cirillo's for years and always enjoyed his performances. Before seeing this one, The Seminarian was my favorite. Not anymore. This is #1. In previous movies, during the sex scenes, I always hoped I'd get a sneak-peek of his junk.... well, this flick shows more than just a sneak-peek and, trust me, it was well worth the wait... I was not disappointed... rather impressed to the max. Hopefully, he'll make more flicks where all is revealed. As for this flick: the opening scene was inappropriate for a gay flick... and it was way too long. The ending came across as an after thought... seemed almost irrelevant. No doubt, I will watch this video many, many times. I also want to mention that Scott Sell, who was new to me, gave an outstanding performance... He's a stud muffin and I'm glad to say that, he, also, revealed everything...",1491177600,4,861,4.633986928104576

6991402,3,B00SLH734K,"Not much new here. I think there are much better efforts out there on the theme. For example, the Falls by Jon Garcia, parts 1 & 2, The Happy Sad, by Rodney Evans is excellent and well done also. The subject here is the conflicted and confusing world of the guy (or woman) who is a Kinsey ""3"" or ""4."" You know, the individuals who are attracted emotionally and physically to both men and women. While this production adds some much needed and fairly well executed humor, the truth is, these individuals need help...I think, for themselves and all of the lives that wind-up being collateral damage as they struggle through this ""dilemma."" The dilemma isn't just sexual, but for the true Kinsey 3, it is the emotional attachment as well. I am in a little doubt as to the extent of the ""help"" these folks may need, because the issue of having emotional and physical attraction to both genders, is as much or perhaps more about culture and current mores surrounding sexuality, than the individual who experiences attraction to both genders. Depending on the country, as well as the historical and current political and economic climate of that country, bisexual behavior may not be that unusual. Here is the U.S., we generally don't really know what to make of folks who sleep with one gender on the side and marry the other gender. Some have commented that they are just slutty, or just greedy, or just gay people who cannot bear coming-out. But I think that is too convenient. Perhaps, the reality is that few care if you sleep with both genders, but just don't make a commitment (e.g., marriage) to one and sleep around on the side, with the other. That's just bad manners. It is indecent. It is cruel. It is unacceptable. So, that is the dilemma of the protagonist in this story. And I think it is worth a little time to find-out how this character resolves it, but not much.",1462060800,,1875,4.6

6991406,5,B00SLH734K,"The Last Straight Man is probably the most touching, realistic, engaging (and okay, well, hot) movie about love and sex between two seemingly real men that I have watched (and I have watched a lot of them). This is not fantasy but real life in its complexity, heartache, confusion, and power. I love these two guys and miss them already. The comparison by another reviewer to the Before Sunrise/Sunset/Midnight movies is very apt, not just from the device of seeing two people together at different points over the years but from the actual dialogue and interplay between two authentic souls who love each other. Plus, again, well, these guys are hot. Great flick, cool that it's available on line. I hope the people who made this movie make more.",1461024000,10,747,4.7984496124031

The rest of the film, however, was outstanding...complete with very good acting; physically attractive, colorful characters; and wicked hot, but tastefully done, sex scenes.

6991419,5,B00SLH734K,"""The Last Straight Man"" is a kind of jocular euphemism for the ""straight"" claim, attitude, and behavior of one of the main characters - Cooper - who has a one-night stand with his best gay friend Lewis after a night of bachelor party carousing.  The ""boy was I drunk last night line is not used"", however, and the two decide to make it an ANNUAL ""affair"" which goes on for a 12 year period.  There is far more to this story than the preceding sentence would indicate.  What develops over that 12 year period is an evolution regarding the total relationship between these two best friends. Cooper, who keeps protesting that he is straight, is prepared to go further and further in matters sexual and believes he is ready to leave his wife and child for Lewis.  Lewis, on the other hand, sees a bigger picture and must make a key decision that will affect both of them.  Cooper (superbly played by Scott Sell) is a combination of attractiveness and naivete.  Lewis (equally played by Mark Cirillo) is the more practical and experienced one. In the end what emerges is a true love story that does make legitimate sense but must move in the only sensible direction. Cooper admits to Lewis that he is the only man that Cooper has ever had sex with and the desire to do so. This is NOT an improbable scenario.  As stated in the title for this review: Sexual orientation is not an absolute, particularly when it comes to genuine emotional feelings between two life-long friends. The constraints put on the film may make its story seem too simplistic. This is definitely NOT the case even though we only see Coop (as he's called) and Lewis getting together four times in the twelve year period.  The storyline makes the very most of its necessarily limited encounters. A beard on each character is supposed to make them look as if they've aged.  (In one late scene, Lewis is once again beardless which is no doubt the result of filming out of chronological sequence. Indeed, in the ""special features"" section, Scott Sell tells his audience that one of the final scenes was the first one filmed.)  The sex is simulated and even has a humorous moment when Coop (very late in their affair) suddenly puts a halt to his new ""bottoming"" experience because - as Lewis put it - he had ""not properly prepped"" him and then proceeds to do so off camera. The entire story as it unfolds is quite credible and a happy epilogue ending, in my opinion, does not detract but only adds to a subject that is far more complex than most people realize.  This movie has substance, fine acting, a literate and meaningful script, and good looking actors. One cannot ask for more. (A final comment to the reviewer who objected to the hotel room not changing in 12 years. I have been in some of the finer hotel chains - Hilton for one - and their rooms did not change for even a longer period. Perhaps that's why some of them went out of business or had to be sold.)",1436227200,9,2931,4.511320754716981
6991420,5,B00SLH734K,"Grand Jury Prize Winner - Alternative Spirit Award at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and rightfully so, this very involving film from filmmaker Mark Bessenger, ""The Last StraightMan"" is a therapeutic treat for anyone who's been involved in
truncated relationships. From the outset, both leading men are aware of
their feelings for one another. Lewis (Mark Cirillo) is a closeted man
throwing a bachelor party for his straight best friend and secret
crush, Cooper (Scott Sell). However, both realize their
relationship is doomed due to Cooper's upcoming nuptial.
Emotions run high as both men agree to schedule a yearly one
night stand from life's daily grind. During this interlude they
are both allowed to ask three intimate questions to be answered as
truthfully as possible. That opportunity allows
both men to exchange confessions on their true feelings in
addition to giving each other the needed updates they crave just to see
where their relationship stands. You would think that Lewis is
unilaterally suffering through the bulk of heartache this unrequited
love situation is generating. However, much suffering is to be had by
Cooper who is torn between his family and his real belated true love found
for Lewis. This is the type of love that has grown so out of bounds,
Cooper does not know how to deal with his emotions.",1435104000,4,1344,5.058558558558558

The two guys are not at all attractive, but I've seen both actors before separately and not thought that, so it's just something about their pairing in this movie. I cannot believe that anyone would want to spend even a few minutes with either of them.

But that's not all. Every word of the dialog is stilted and coy and totally unnatural, and it's delivered in weird, almost screechy voices that make my skin crawl. On top of all that, the very first scene (and it's a LONG one) is of a female stripper giving lap dances at a bachelor party, with either her boobs or her thonged butt bouncing about six inches from the camera most of the time. That is NOT what I want to see in a gay movie, or anywhere else.
