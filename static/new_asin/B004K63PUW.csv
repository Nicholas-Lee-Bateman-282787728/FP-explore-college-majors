4395471,5,B004K63PUW,I chose 5 star because it was send in perfect condition. I love Bewitched because my young Granddaughters and I watch them together and I know it is great movies that have nothing in them that would be bad for children to watch.,1355702400,,228,4.325581395348837
4395472,5,B004K63PUW,"I actually did not buy this product as a box set. It is cheaper to buy the seasons individually for some reason. I paid $128.00 for all 8. Make sure you buy seasons 1 and 2 in black and white like they were originally produced and broadcast. This is easier than rating each season one by one. These shows are not available to stream for free in their entirety anymore. This is the only way to go. The episodes with Dick Sargent are not quite as good as the earlier ones with Dick York. Sargent portrayed the character with this sublime and inner anger and the tension between him and his co stars was real and it bled into the scenes. Dick York was far better at the part. For any classic tv fan, this set is a must.",1355270400,8,716,4.158273381294964
4395473,1,B004K63PUW,don't know why i have this in my review don't have this DVD someone must have updated the wrong account,1353369600,2,103,4.2
4395474,4,B004K63PUW,"I must say that I haven't known of this series all that long. I first heard of ""I Dream of Jeannie"" (1965-1970) a fantasy sitcom in itselft, which some say is just a mockery of ""Bewitched"" but it isn't!!!!

Anyways, let's get back to my ""Bewitched"" review shall we? When I looked it up on Wikipedia, I was so surprised to see how popular this fantasy riot was back in the 1960s. This series ranked #2 during the 1964/65 season (its first season); ranking only behind ""Bonanza"". The series aired in B&W for its first two seasons, and it ranked 7th for its second year. Season three brings a switch to color, higher productions, and slipping ratings. Though it still ranked 7th for its third year, its ratings had slipped.

For its fourth and fifth seasons, the series ranked 11th overall, however, ratings still dropped. In the show's sixth season, with Darrin now played by Dick Sargent, ratings dropped to #24 for the season. By the end of its prime time run, ""Bewitched"" ranked 72nd, one of the top 15 least watched TV shows on TV at the time.

However, I must admit that ""Bewitched"" does have good humor. It does, however, repeat several other popular episodes from ""I Love Lucy"" and other classical sitcoms. In the final season of ""Bewitched"" there are 8 remade episodes from previous seasons! This should've told writters that the show was burning out.... Hello, ratings were now at the bottom of the charts, and they couldn't think of nothing else to write for our beloved Samantha and Darrin.... and let's not forget Tabitha and the wicked Endora.

Nevertheless, I think that this would be an excellent ""Complete Series"" collection to order. I would also suggest ordering the complete series of ""Gilligan's Island"" and ""I Dream of Jeannie"" and maybe even ""The Addams Family"". Why.... you may ask? Because these are wholesome, non-violent, no-sexual shows with no cussing, sex, or even sexual aimed themes.... just down-to-Earth fun and humor! Enjoy this if you purchase! And think about ordering the other shows I've suggested as well! THANKS FOR READING....!!!!!!!!!!",1351987200,2,2075,4.8696883852691215
4395475,5,B004K63PUW,"In this amazing set fans receive every single ""Bewitched"" episode on eight individual box sets spanning the years the series ran on ABC from 1964-1972. Although this is not an ""official"" Complete Series set if you have not purchased any of the season sets this is a remarkable deal. The only issue I have is that the first two black and white seasons are not included here, just the colorized versions of those years. Still, what a fabulous way to own the whole ""Bewitched"" library of episodes.

 Another important point too is that there are no ""real"" bonuses included, no interviews and no rare ""Bewitched"" commercials that were broadcast back in the 1960's. I, though, am still holding out hope that Sony Pictures will put out an ""official"" ""Bewitched"" Complete Series set with bonuses that would even make Samantha and Endora proud!",1351555200,11,836,4.880281690140845
4395476,5,B004K63PUW,"This is one of the best shows from classic television that is family focused and entertaining to viewers of all ages. Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) is a hardworking wife, mother and a daughter who tries to play fair to her husband, Darrin (Dick York/Dick Sargent), daughter Tabitha (Erin Murphy), and mother Endora (Agnes Moorhead). Being a witch, she promises to Darrin that she will not use her (witchy) powers in the family. But practically this becomes impossible since her mother Endora who strongly despises Darrin, interferes in his personal and professional life, and at the end Samantha has to intervene and undo the damages done. Many episodes begin with Darrin becoming the victim of a spell, and it usually affects his boss, Larry (David White) and his clients, and the nosy neighbor, Mrs. Kravitz (Alice Pearce, Sandra Gould) and her husband Abner (George Tobias). Over the years I have seen many episodes on TV Land cable channel and enjoyed immensely. It has been tradition in my family to watch the Christmas episodes and Thanksgiving episodes during the holiday season. There are five Christmas shows and only one Thanksgiving episode. The thanksgiving episode is one of the best episodes of the series. Other episodes that I highly recommend are, in addition to all Christmas episodes; from season 4; ""Hippie, Hippie, Hooray."" In this story, Cousin Serena has become an ultra-hip girl and is arrested at a love-in, which makes the front page of the newspaper. Larry and Louise think it is Samantha in the photograph, making for another confusing dinner party at the Stephens' home with one of McMann and Tate's clients. From season 2; ""Divided He Falls,"" Samantha wants to go to Miami, but Darrin is too busy with work. Endora then splits Darrin in two (one serious, one playful) so that Samantha can take her vacation with playful Darrin, and she become tired of his fun side, while Larry and a client become annoyed by his overly serious side. From season 3; ""The Trial and Error of Aunt Clara,"" Samantha's living room is turned into a courtroom so that Samantha could defend Aunt Clara against a coven who wants her earthbound. The show saw a major change when Dick York left the show and he was replaced by Dick Sargent. I found Dick York is funnier and better for the role of Darrin.",1348099200,,2308,4.875318066157761
4395477,4,B004K63PUW,"I bought this product not for myself, but for my fiance. She loves classic TV shows, and her favorite one of all is Bewitched. Well, it didn't take long for me to become a fan myself. She would put in a disc, the old familiar tune would greet my ears, and suddenly I would find myself smiling and laughing right along with my significant other. Bewitched is good, solid entertainment, the plot moved along by Samantha's mischief-making and Darren's resistance to accept or tolerate anything out of the ordinary. I must admit though, with the changing of one of the lead actors (Dick Sargent replacing Dick York as Darren), my interest in the series began to fade. Of course, using the same formula over and over also became tiring. Samantha or one of her witchy friends (mostly her mother) use magic spells to cause trouble for Darren. Darren whines until Samantha figures out how to return everything to normal before the end of each episode. That's it.
  Still, Bewitched is packed with laughs that don't rely on poop or fart jokes. There's no swearing, no nudity, no violence. People of all ages can enjoy the program. At least for the first four or five discs, before it starts to get old.",1335398400,22,1193,4.649289099526066
4395478,5,B004K63PUW,I have always liked Bewitched. So I grabbed the seasons when they came out. One paticular Christmas episode I vaugely remembered was loate in the series because it had the second Darrin in it and he didn't come into it until season six. Anyway its a good show.,1331683200,4,260,4.4375
4395479,5,B004K63PUW,its everything I remember growing up with. Good CLEAN comdey like it suppose to be and you don't need parents consent to watch it. I grew up watching Bewitched and now I'll be happy to grow old still watching it,1383523200,,211,4.3
4395480,5,B004K63PUW,"Wife loves bewitched.

I liked a few episodes, but not really a fan

She' satisfied...that's what matters.

Good product as described",1382918400,,133,5.238095238095238
4395481,5,B004K63PUW,"It brings back  my  memories.
I will never get tired of it.
I watch it every day naw.
I love it.",1375833600,,96,3.5238095238095237
4395482,4,B004K63PUW,"It seemed easier to buy the whole set in one go than to click on each season set, whose net savings would have been roughly $5.  Easier to ship as the whole series is shrinkwrapped, and would be less likely to have discs get loose inside their packages.  My set arrived without issue.

""Bewitched"" is a surprisingly clean and innocent 60s sitcom, with the premise of a mortal marrying a witch (Hollywood's version of a witch, not based on historical or real-life witchcraft, because the show would be far different and would offer nothing of humor for Paul Lynde...)  Indeed, the show is great early on, especially as Samantha keeps trying to prove to mother that Darrin is one of the good mortals that is open-minded; the Halloween episode from season 2 is probably a good episode to start people with (or any with Uncle Arthur...)

Paul Lynde was only in ten episodes, which is unfortunate as he stole the show - every time.

All the principal actors treat their material with such veracity that I can believe the silly proceedings.

Later years do get more risque at times (e.g. toward the end of the show's run, Paul Lynde is in an episode where - at a children's party - he gets a spell wrong and conjures up a woman dressed like a bunny instead of a real bunny appearing.  Kids would appreciate the mistake for it going wrong, but adults - especially the dads - will appreciate it for rather a different reason (or two...)  but the show is still riotously funny, if you can get into it and roll along with it.

I will nitpick, though, in that ""warlock""'s original meaning was of Scottish origin and is the name of a person that breaks an oath or covenant.  Somewhere along the line of history somebody thought to replace the gender-neutral ""witch"" with ""warlock"".  I tend to be a fan of original word meanings, and many words to change meaning over time, but keeping in mind that the show was not made to insult or hurt anyone per se, it's easily overlooked.

As for DVD quality:

Pros:
------
Colorization:  I normally prefer the black and white originals, but the people that did this work did a fairly good job at tricking the eye.  Some scenes have me doing a double-take.  I can still tell the differences between real color and colorizaton (hint - gray or white hair isn't even given a color cast, some skin tones are too saturated, and some coats (or skin color, especially by white hair) look like they're in 3D because the applied color didn't (or can't) match the darker tone of the original b/w print) but, for colorization, an A- grade seems not unreasonable.

Sound quality is excellent, given the media of the time.  Grade: A

Cons:
------
Many seasons (season 3 stands out) being of very poor quality - much film grain and other distortion lowers image quality.  There was obviously color restoration done, but not much else.  Grade, depends on the season but on average:  C+

Keep in mind that larger TVs (40""+) will show the DVD compression artifacts, poor source quality, etc, far more readily than smaller sets.  And these shows were originally seen on sets no larger than 24"" (often 20"" or smaller).  I'm surprised they were made on 35mm film, not 16mm, but the fact they're done on 35mm means that a good restoration process could make them look flawless AND candidates for a Blu-Ray release.

Definitely purchasing, if you're a big fan of the show.  Otherwise stick with season sets sold separately, or if you hate the show then there's no need to buy.",1374883200,4,3480,4.60551948051948

4395484,4,B004K63PUW,"Bought this as a present for my wife.  She loves this show.  The only point deduction is that they colored all of the B&W episodes.  At times their teeth look grey.  A little distracting to me, but no one else seems to notice.  Maybe they should have used brown since most people smoked then anyways.  lol",1369180800,,305,4.357142857142857
