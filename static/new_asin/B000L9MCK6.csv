8160377,4,B000L9MCK6,"I recently retired and decided to resume playing golf regularly.  I really struggled, hitting the ball straight was a rarity.  After a few lessons from a local pro there was virtually no improvement.  One day I stumbled across a Moe Norman video on the net and tried his very simple swing,  Immediately 70-80% of my tee shots were right down the middle of the fairway - some even had a little draw.  I looked on Amazon and found this video.  Now I'm playing much better.  Though I'll never play on the tour, I can go out on the course and not embarrass myself.  Sure, sometimes I'll hit one fat/thin, but I'm hitting the ball straight.  I'm back in the 80's and pride won't allow me to play from the senior tees.  You can spend a lot of money on golf equipment and get nowhere.  This video costs less than a 30 minute lesson from most instructors and it is easy to understand.  This is the best investment in my golf game that I've made.  The second best: Comfortable shoes (Ecco).",1394150400,3,981,4.383333333333334
8160378,4,B000L9MCK6,"I have books, and this DVDs (more than 10 items) about Moe Norman's swing. This DVD is one of the item help to improve my swing, after one year of trial. I completely change my swing to this one. My best club is wood. It is dead straight. I have no one to help me, but DVDs and books about Moe Norman. My iron is still not quite good but is improving. I hope that there will be DVD about iron shot from Moe Norman, instead of Wood and Driver. Then my game will be perfect. Before change into Moe Norman swing, I shot around 100. And now is around low 90s. My best one is 87, 6 birdie chances contributed from my 3 and 5 woods.",1370563200,2,626,3.937007874015748
8160379,5,B000L9MCK6,"After watching this CD, I was able to identify and correct three problems with my swing. My grip was not correct, I was standing too tall and my back swing was coming off plane. The PVC drill is very good. If my back swing feels the same as the PVC drill I know my shot will go straight.",1189555200,3,287,3.9655172413793105
8160380,5,B000L9MCK6,"I own a LOT of instructional material in regards to Moe Norman's swing, and this is the most concise and clear instruction I've seen so far.  For someone familiar with Moe's swing, this video answers a lot of questions and clears up a lot of confusion, at least it did for me.",1170201600,2,276,4.3076923076923075
