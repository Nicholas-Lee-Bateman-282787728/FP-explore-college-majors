414435,5,6301995902,"I would give this film six stars if possible, because i truly believe that it is the greatest movie of all time. This tear jerking story of a single mother raising her young daughter in New York is truly heart wrenching.  Also look for outstanding preformances from Tom Selleck and the always brilliant Fiona Shaw. It truly is a spine tingiling classic that pulls at the heart strings and leaves one begging for more.",993600000,,417,4.635135135135135
414436,4,6301995902,"What a pleasant, romantic, thoroughly nice film this is!
Carrying on from Three Men and a Baby, this is set several years later and Mary is now five.  Peter (Selleck) is in love with Mary's mother, Sylvia (Travis) but because of past relationship problems he won't admit his feelings.
Sylvia feels the same way as Peter but wants Mary to have a settled home with just one father instead of three and so when Peter won't commit, she agrees to marry another man.  As he's British, Mary and Sylvia then have to go to England to live.
Does Peter go and get his girls?  It's a romance!  What do you think?
The touching love scene's between Peter and Sylvia are fantastic and the comedy is light and warm-hearted.  A must have film for all romantic's out there.",976838400,3,755,4.481751824817518
414437,5,6301995902,"The chemistry between Tom, Ted, Steve and Nancy is great.  The on  site filming in New York City and England is beautiful.  This film is much better than THREE MEN AND A BABY, and very funny.  The sound track is very good also.  Both adults and children will  enjoy this film.",969580800,,276,4.313725490196078
414438,5,6301995902,"This is seriously one of the funniest movies ever. I've watched it at least twenty times and I still find new and exciting things about it. Above all look for Ellsmith, she is the key to the whole movie. Everything she  does makes one crack up and fall over in sitches. In short a great family  film!",959644800,,300,4.245614035087719
414439,4,6301995902,"This sequel to the original is every bit as comical and endearing as the first one.  Selleck, Danson, and Gutenberg are splendid together, as we watch them ""grow up"" along with little Mary. A well-written film,  this movie will test your powers of observation as it alludes to at least  three other films (Great Escape, Wizard of Oz, and Star Wars-Episode 4)most  cleverly slipped in by the director.  By far, one of my favorite films.",943833600,2,435,4.746666666666667

415001,3,6301995902,"When Sylvia decides to uproot her child by marrying a British actor and moving to England, little Mary's three fathers decide to intervene.

  How could anyone NOT want to see a movie where Tom Selleck, Ted Danson and Steve Guttenberg live together and raise a child together?

  I know that Three Men and a Baby came first.  The sequel is not really all that culturally significant if you think about it.  Full House was already well on its way to becoming a hit program when this movie came out.  Three Men and a Baby had been done.  It's not like this movie invented the ""Mary has Three Daddies"" scenario.  And furthermore,  it was either Three Men and a Baby or Police Academy that had the dubious honor of making Steve Guttenberg a star (so much for it being the Stonecutters).

  Then again, who's keeping track?

  I prefer the sequel for no other reason than a five year old is more fun than a bald, gender-ambiguous, personality-ambiguous baby.  I have to say, though, for a five year old, Mary comes off as more of a trained seal than a child.  She's still kinda cute.

  By the way, while doing some research for this review, I discovered that Three Men and a Bride will probably be coming out in 2012, probably right around the time the world ends...",1325376000,2,1262,4.486725663716814
415048,5,6301995902,"This sequel was just as funny as the first movie as the actors return to bring much laughter into the homes of many American viewers.

In the sequel, Mary is now five years old and about to begin her first school year. The mother, Sylvia, decides that she wants to get married and expand her family, and chooses her present acting director as the perfect candidate, despite the fact that Tom Selleck has a little crush on her, but is too afraid to make a move. She takes her daughter to England for the wedding, and Tom Selleck and Steve Guttenburg follow her there, as Selleck is convinced that Sylvia's choice is not much of a good candidate. His fears are confirmed when he realizes that Mary is about to be shipped off to a preppy boarding school after the wedding and that the headmistress has a huge crush on him and even goes so far as to make a much-dramatic move on him as well!

With Ted Danson as Jack, playing his part as an elderly English vicar to help stall the wedding, the other two are determined to stop the ceremony so Selleck can admit to Sylvia that he loves her, and to expose her future husband for the complete moron that he turns out to be. I enjoyed this movie a lot and is a must-buy!",1296691200,,1212,4.288209606986899
415049,5,6301995902,"Peter (Tom Selleck), Michael (Steve Guttenberg) and Jack (Ted Danson) are now dedicated ""fathers"" to five year old Mary (Robin Weisman). Everything is going along fine until Mary's mother, Sylvia (Nancy Travis), begins thinking she needs more stability in her life and doesn't think any of her roomates are up to the task.

Sylvia doesn't know that Peter has fallen in love with her but is hesitant to act since he feels his best friend, and Mary's biological father, Jack should step up and marry her so she accepts a marriage proposal from the directory of her play, Edward (Christopher Cazenove). The wedding is to be in England and shortly we learn that Edward plans to move Sylvia and Mary there as well. Faced with the prospect of loosing Mary from their lives Micheal and Jack convince Peter to finally ask Sylvia to marry him instead of the unlikable, but willing, Edward and the three go to great lengths to break them up.

In the end Sylvia realizes that Edward is a scoundrel and that she really likes Peter as well so we get the typical and expected happy ending with Sylvia leaving Edward at the alter to return to New York. The guys are back and are fantastic again in their roles. A great movie and to anyone who hasen't seen it.",1263772800,2,1244,4.573991031390134

415053,4,6301995902,"This is the sequel to the smash hit Three Men and a Baby (which was a remake of the French break out hit Three Men and a Cradle).

It is now five years later. Mary, Sylvia and the boys are cohabitating in the guys apartment.  But Mary wants more stability in her and Mary's life.  When the director of her current Broadway smash falls for Sylvia, the happy group is about to break up.  Even worse, Sylvia, Mary and Edward are moving to England.

But the boys think that ""something is rotten in Denmark.""  They run over to England to rescue Sylvia and Mary.  And it turns out that Edward is the rotter that they think he is.  But now they need the proof to show Sylvia.

This is a good sequel but it not a great sequel (great story but too much irrelavant slapstick).  What this movie does is give a vehicle for Tom Sellick (Peter - the architect) to shine.  Tom has always been a nice amiable actor but has never had a role to breakout of his Magnum PI image.  This one showed that he has more than just one character in him.

Ted Danson and Steve Guttenberg return as the ""biological"" Jack (the actor) and other ""honorary father"" Michael (the satirist) but they are just there for the ride.  It is Tom's show. (Athough Ted has a great turn a the fake Vicar.)

Nancy Travis returns as Sylvia and actually is in the entire movie instead of arrive at the end like the first.  And she proves that she has a great sense of time and can fake a British accent almost as good as Gwenyth.

This is a beautiful romantic comedy.  Too bad they stooped to some unneccesary slapstick at times. BUT!!! I recommend this film wholehearted, and it stands on its own.",1199145600,3,1649,4.298701298701299
415054,5,6301995902,"Great movie. Ted Danson, Steve Guttenberg, Tom Sellick lead an allstar cast once again in this charming sequel to Three Men and a Baby. I thought the original was better however. This movie is still loaded with laughs, it tends to get boring at times but the movie gets funnier towards the end.
 Mary is no longer a baby. She's beginning to ask ""questions"", and the guys (Sellick, Guttenberg, Danson) begin to feel cramped even with Mary's mother (Nancy Travis) living with all of them. Out comes a man named Edward who is looking to woooooh Sylvia into marrying him while secretely sending Mary to an all girls dorm called Pylesforth (forgive my spelling). Peter (Sellick) tries to get a grip with himself and wonder if Sylvia is his true love while Jack (Danson) gives his blessing to Peter. While the movie has the same zany humor from the famous 3 of Magnum P.I (Sellick), Cary Mahoney of Police Academy (Guttenberg), and Sam Malone (Danson's character in Cheers) in the orginal, the movie tends to get boring in the middle but it all comes together in a laugh-out-loud riot where Peter, Michael, Jack race to Britian to either be at Sylvia and Edward's wedding or stop it? Will Jack help his friend? It all equals to a terrific ending and a great song to end it with (Waiting for a Star to Fall).

Get ready to be delighted by Ted Danson's debonair character that all the women love, and Tom Selleck's brainy hearthrob that make all the women swoon, and Steve Guttenberg.

You know what my favorite part of the movie is?  You guessed it.  The Little Lady.  Because in Three Men and a Baby, the Baby couldn't have any silly little lines because it was too young (and was a baby).  But now--spoiler alert!--the baby grew up to be a Little Lady, and she says wisecracks that are both precious and life-affirming.

Three Men and a Little Lady is probably the most dramatic movie you'll ever see, and that's including Awakenings, where everyone gets healthy and then sick again.",1154908800,,859,4.568627450980392
415077,3,6301995902,"3 Men and a Baby was a one of a kind comedy that showed three men struggling to take care of a baby girl. Six years later (this sequel was actually made three years after the original) Tom Selleck, Ted Danson, and Steve Guttenberg are raising and rooming with the little lady known as Mary as well as Mary's mother (Nancy Travis) who returns from her brief role in the first movie to play a larger role in this one. Does the sequel hold up to the first? To a degree I can say it does. The humor is good and so is the acting for the most part. I felt, however, that this film was a bit rushed. There were not any major plot holes to speak of but I wish that the movie had of  been a bit longer than what it was. I just want to point out that Leonard Nimoy did not return to direct this film. Plus, the dvd like 3 Men and a Baby has no features though unlike 3 Men and a Baby cannot be viewed in widescreen. 3 Men and a Little Lady is certainly worth viewing despite these minor flaws. While I can see why some people favor the original a bit more, this sequel is a decent follow-up that shouldn't be missed. It would have been nice for another sequel to come out in which Mary is a teenager along with Selleck, Danson, Guttenberg, and Travis returning for a third time. Oh well, I guess that is just wishful thinking.",1152144000,2,1316,4.061538461538461
415078,5,6301995902,"This is one of those rare situations where the sequel is significantly better than the original film.

""Three Men and a Baby"" was a girl flick -- silly plot, cute baby, three men acting like Alan Alda (i.e., effeminate), enough to make any reasonable person want to throw up.

""Three Men and a Little Lady"" is infinitely superior, and funnier. I never thought much of Ted Danson until I saw the final scene in this film, in which he plays a senile Anglican priest -- a comic masterpiece that is alone worth the price of the disk.",1122940800,7,529,4.443298969072165

Three years later,the sequel ""Three Men And A Little Lady"" was released. It didn't score as high as the first film at the box office. Robin Weisman is the 5-year-old little lady Mary in this film. The six-month-old baby in the first film was played by twins Lisa and Michelle Blair. The three men of course,are Peter Mitchell(Selleck),Michael Kellam(Guttenberg) and Jack Holden(Danson). Peter,Michael,Jack,Mary and Mary's mother Sylvia(Nancy Travis) are all living together now. Peter,Michael and Sylvia in one scene are at a meeting with the principal of an elementary school that Mary has been enrolled in. Jack,an actor dressed as Count Dracula,shows up at the meeting late(he was filming a TV commercial). Mary in another scene is taught by Peter the definition of the word ""penis"". Peter and Sylvia are both shocked. Michael was quite amused. There's also Edward,who's an Englishman like Sylvia. Edward directed Sylvia,who's also an actress,in a broadway play. Edward and Sylvia,romantically involved,plan to marry in their native England,taking Mary with them. Edward deceptively schemes to enroll Mary at the Pileforth Academy,a boarding school there. In another scene,Sylvia is extremely angry at Peter because of some comments he made when Edward visited. She slapped him hard in the face. So Sylvia,Mary and Edward head for England. So Peter,Michael and Jack throw a party just like they did in one scene from the first film. Mary was sad to leave her father Jack and his two roommates. So Peter and Michael surprisingly travel to England to visit Sylvia,Mary and Edward. Jack was filming a movie so he couldn't join his roommates. Jack,dressed as the late Hollywood great Carmen Miranda,phones Michael in England. Jack said he wouldn't be able to attend Edward's and Sylvia's wedding. But,Jack,as himself,later arrives in England in time for the wedding,which never happens. As the bogus wedding begins,Peter,Michael and Elsabeth,Pileforth's principal,crash the ceremony with the enrollment list for the next term on which Mary appears. Sylvia had not known about it until this point and she become furious at Edward. I said ""bogus"" because the unofficial ceremony was performed by Jack,made up as an elderly priest. Sylvia decided she's going to continue living in New York and tells Peter,""You can see Mary as much as you like."" Peter told Sylvia that he loved her. So a real certified priest enters the chapel,marrying Peter and Sylvia. Jack catches the bridal bouquet thrown by Sylvia after the ceremony. WAITING FOR A STAR TO FALL,performed by Boy Meets Girl,on hit parade in the fall of 1988,is played during the end credits. By the way,Sylvia's mother,of course,attended her daughter's wedding.

Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg and Ted Danson return in their roles as three bachelors raising a five-year old girl along with her mother, played by Nancy Travis. This time around, we see little Mary struggling with the fact that her family is different from those of her peers, and then her mother, Sylvia, announcing her engagement to an Englishman who is going to move the three of them to England. Then Peter (Tom Selleck's character) realizes that he is in love with Sylvia so he rushes to England to stop the wedding.
This movie definitely has a different feel than the first movie. The latter was more of a comedy of three confirmed bachelors struggling to take care of a six-month old baby. ""Little Lady"" is more of a sentimental, romantic movie. For whatever reason, I found the second movie to be more enjoyable.
