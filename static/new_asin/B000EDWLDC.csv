It shows Del Monaco an Tebaldi at their best. It makes you think how beautiful the sound of their voices must be. I have search for videos of the arias and haven't found another videos with more beautiful sound.",1194480000,,419,4.454545454545454
2516479,4,B000EDWLDC,"The quality of this video is very good considering it is a re-mastered disc of a 1955 soundtrack. Though my copy has a few glitch here and there, luckily both sound and picture are very good when either one of the three principals sings his (or her) big areas, or duets. Just watching those few scenes is more then worth it. The singing (through out the entire opera) was really remarkable. Not just the principals, the entire cast is simply terrific. If one must know how well it was? Thanks to the Editorial Review provided by Amazon, it indicates that Del Monaco had a new coach and changed his way of singing. I took it as saying that Del Monaco does not yell/scream any more. That was one of the reasons for me to buy this video. Sure enough, he did not yell/scream here. That made a whole lot differences. So if you don't like Del Monaco, give him a chance, this video can help you change your mind. I have a 1994 re-mastered CD of a 1964 EMI recording of Chenier. In which Franco Corelli and Antonietta Stella were Chenier and Maddalena, respectively. That is the only Stella's recording that I have. I never seen her on stage nor heard much of her in the radio broadcast neither. Though I read about her in articles, her rapid rising to stardom and fading away early. Anyhow, I had not form an opinion on her so far. In this video, she looks much older than her real age (26 at that time). She had a great voice, a real lyric spinto (fully developed, probably ahead of her age). Her voice blends with the other two principals' nicely. That explains why she was making it so early. What about Taddei? Well, what can I say? He was never wrong in my book. And he is the main reason that I bought this video.
In conclusion, this is a very good video, though not a perfect one, I think it deserves 4 stars.",1181952000,6,1809,4.323529411764706

8108494,4,B000EDWLDC,"I am often amazed at how well these productions from the 50's and 60's were done. This is no exception. A filmed version (in a studio) rather than a recording of a live stage performance, it uses the techniques available to such a presentation to full effect, e.g. close-ups, different angles of the same scene. It helps that the singers are so good: del Monaco may have a stentorian technique, but he looks and acts the part and can sing softly when needed; Taddei looked good in his younger days, acts convincingly and sings with his usual rich voice and characterisation; I have never been a fan of Stella's tone, but she sings well and, like her partners, acts convincingly in a role that can easily be two-dimensional. The conductor Questa really propels the orchestra to great dramatic heights even in limited sound. Actually, the sound is not too bad for a 60-year old movie (the Belcanto print has been transferred using a wider dynamic range than is often the case). What really struck me about this performance was how committed all the singers, chorus and orchestra are. I saw the recent Covent Garden production at the cinema recently and found that there were frequent episodes where the tension sagged - partly the production, partly the singers and conducting. Not so in this old RAI production. One star withheld for the limited vision (it flickers  at one point) and sound; four stars for a satisfying performance of this opera at its verismo best. The notes by Stefan Zucker are an added attraction to this DVD.",1433894400,,1529,4.769811320754717
8108495,5,B000EDWLDC,Mario Del Monaco is wonderful in this part.  Andrea Chenier is a serious opera and it is actually quite moving.  The singing is great but you have to be able to tolerate the imperfections of an old black and white video recording.  I found that after a few minutes I did not notice the imperfections.,1424304000,,300,4.418181818181818
8108496,5,B000EDWLDC,"This is the best Andrea Chenier and the best Monaco I have ever seen. I cannot believe that Monaco can sing this dramatically. He really gave up his usual singing style of screaming. He even smiled. My CD version of Andrea Chenier is by Gigli and Caniglia.  Antonietta Stella is really good. This is the first time I see Giuseppe Taddei. He is at least as good as Tito Gobbi in singing and expression aspect. After all, they all sing well, and their acting is very dramatic and even much better than film stars nowaday.",1398470400,,519,4.463157894736842

8108499,5,B000EDWLDC,"It's doubtful that most of you ever have attended a performance as thrilling as this one. Several now-defunct companies released this performance on VHS. Our DVD version easily surpasses all earlier incarnations, including ours. The images don't look like they come from a kinescope (although they do). Our tech Jonathan Casper restored the audio. Although occasional flaws remain, overall, the results are a joy!

Chnier was the role with which Del Monaco changed singing by introducing a technique taught by Arturo Melocchi, based on singing with the larynx kept low, at the bottom of the neck. It gave Del Monaco a powerful, brassy, thick, muscular, penetrating sound.

In March 1949 Del Monaco sang Chnier at La Scala. His performances excited the public and marked a changing of the guard. Gigli sang his final Scala performances in 1947, as Chnier. His object and that of the tenors he influenced, above all, was to caress you. Del Monaco's was to excite you.

Del Monaco sang La Scala's March 6, 1949 broadcast of Chnier. On hearing it Corelli, already having tried many teachers, went to study with Melocchi. Their lowered-larynx approach has been copied by Giuseppe Giacomini, Luis Lima, Nicola Martinucci and a host of others.

Albert Innaurato, reviewing in The Metropolitan Opera Guide to Opera on Video

""This is the best Chnier on video, and the sound track is thrilling to hear. The producer, Corradi, gives the opera a traditional but imaginative treatment, distinguished by a real sympathy for the idiom and these singers.

""The caliber of these performers is rarely matched elsewhere. The many supporting singers are superb--vocally excellent for the most part, and all totally inside their parts and very inventive. This isn't opera to them, it's life. Looking at the other videos [of Chnier] one could scarcely imagine so much detail was possible. L'Incredibile (Athos Cesarini) is played as an 'exquisite,' Roucher (Franco Calabrese) has an arresting dignity and a splendid voice, the lower-class characters are full of color, unction, and danger.

""Del Monaco and Stella look wonderful. The tenor, youthful here with a rare vulnerability and sweetness, does almost none of the carrying on for which he was famous. His Chnier is above all a person: ardent, needy, and sensitive. It's amazing to realize, but he has a real talent for camera acting. Stella matches him for tenderness and abandon. One doesn't expect to like or believe in the poet and his Maddalena, but these two are so endearing and recognizable as decent humans caught up in murderous events that the opera becomes very moving. They sound spectacular on the sound track.

""Taddei was one of two great Italian baritones of his period (the other was Tito Gobbi). His is an immense voice of glorious impact, and he is a charismatic and detailed actor. He was a short, very chubby man, but like all great actors, uses and transcends his physical appearance. Not for a second is Grard other than a complex, haunting, and unique human being. Taddei understands and projects that Grard's actions are rooted in a profound need for love and belonging. His understanding in Act III that he can never have it, and belongs neither with the gentry nor the revolutionaries, makes his the tragic fate in the opera. He is heartbreaking there.""

Tully Potter, reviewing in International Opera Collector

""Giuseppe Taddei shows his other face (all the more menacing for the rotundity of his physique) in Andrea Chnier, a 1955 film from the same source as the Elisir in black and white. The great baritone is in his best voice and I rate this alongside his earlier sound recording of Rigoletto (under the same conductor, Angelo Questa) as the finest representation of him in a serious part. You can see the conflicting emotions flicker across his face in 'Nemico della patria.'

""Antonietta Stella looks and sounds superb in one of her best roles and the supporting cast includes such stalwarts as Franco Calabrese. Mario Del Monaco looks good as Chnier and sings with his customary panache, though he is more soldier than poet--in tenor terms, more Martinelli than Pertile. The production by Mario Landi is worthy of the terrific singing.""

Joe Pearce, President of the Vocal Record Collectors' Society

""Chnier can be a powerhouse opera with the right cast. This is that cast, all in their absolute prime. The opera is sung gloriously from beginning to end; the acting is excellent throughout. Never a great favorite of mine, Taddei nevertheless sings better here than in anything else of his I've heard. The young Stella is lovely to look at, and she is certainly an affecting actress. She sings beautifully throughout, including some high pianissimos that come as surprises as she certainly didn't use them much in her Met years. She takes that always dangerous and almost always problematic top note in 'La mamma morta' perfectly and is alert at all times to her partners' nuances.

""Nuance is hardly the first thing you'd think about when discussing Del Monaco, but excellent as the others are, this is his show and he brings it off splendidly--better than any other Chnier I have ever seen. He has been criticized for a lack of nobility in his art, and if one only is hearing him that criticism is at least understandable. As with his Otello, however, seeing him is another matter, and I have no hesitation in proclaiming him, at least in this role, equal to the most noble vision to emanate from an operatic stage in my time. (Martinelli was before my time.) From his first appearance through the final duet he is the personification of the French poet. There is not a dishonest or overacted moment.

""While singing up a storm in the 'Improvviso,' he acts with extraordinary restraint, but his eyes blaze forth his rage in keeping with his stentorian sounds. His look of disappointment at Maddalena's frivolity as he sings 'O giovinetta bella' is worthy of Olivier--no joke! I found my eyes welling up with tears as this aria was concluding, a situation I rarely have encountered with pile-driving dramatic tenor voices but one which I experienced twice more here--in the final duet and in the entire 'S, fui soldato!' the latter on a dramatic par with anything I ever have encountered from any singer from a visual standpoint.

""This is a well-directed television production, with the voices nicely synchronized. Once you get into the spirit of this performance all external considerations will dissipate immediately. Very highly recommended!""

A letter from a customer:

""I am an Andrea Chnier fanatic, and this is the most satisfying production of that opera I've ever heard or seen-- and I've seen many. I bought this DVD on the strength of the clip offered on Bel Canto Society's Web page and was pleasantly surprised to find that the clip is representative of the high level of singing in this production.

""Probably the first reason most people will buy this DVD is the interpretation of Mario Del Monaco in the title role. He does not disappoint. This tenor role is a tough one, with a high tessitura, and requires a lot of powerful singing and considerable stamina. Del Monaco fits the bill perfectly. His 'Colpito qui m'avete... Un d all'azzurro spazio' is a tour de force--and the best part is after the 'teaser' clip on the Website.

""Despite the fact that many observers feel Del Monaco is monochromatic and continually loud, this is not the case here. In the second-act duet, 'Ora soave,' he shows some very nice shading and gracefully eases into the initial phrase in a musically sympathetic way. His phrasing is truly incredible! There are several phrases where I find myself (I'm a singer too) going, 'How did he do that?' But this is only noteworthy if you've never heard him sing. Del Monaco was famous for his tremendous support and long phrasing. His acting is more than adequate in this role. He surely cuts a dashing figure as Chnier. Other than the occasional meaningless movement, his portrayal is a committed one and believable.

""To hear Taddei in this DVD when he is young (39) and his voice is in full bloom and his face boyish is a tremendous delight for me. His performance is one of the best reasons to own this DVD. As Grard his voice is powerful and warm, with a very nice legato. His high notes are unforced and free. To me, this always has been one of the best baritone roles in all opera. He's a poor man's hero; he's lecherous; he's a fallen, fallible human being who ultimately redeems himself. And that aria, 'Nemico della patria,' is one of the best collaborations between libretto and music ever to have been penned. It is the best of music and mankind together for a few minutes, and Taddei's rendition truly is enthralling. His acting is overall quite good--although his natural facial expression seems to be one of mirth, so there are a few times where he's not quite convincing as the serious revolutionary. But this is a quibble--overall this is one of the best Grard's I've ever heard.

""I had never heard of Antonietta Stella (I may have just disqualified all my opinions by admitting my ignorance), but I was blown away by her performance as Maddalena. Only 26 when this was filmed, her voice is bright, fresh and equal to the power of Del Monaco's. She also displayed a very nice free and uncovered pianissimo in 'Ora soave.'

""Her 'La mamma morta' is stirring and vocally all that one could hope for. Her voice has a very lovely quality and is very similar to Tebaldi's but with none of the occasional harshness. The last-act duet with Del Monaco also is absolutely spine tingling! They are both pouring it on for all its worth, and the duet really is exiting and fun to watch.

""In addition, all the supporting roles, Roucher, Bersi, Incredibile, etc. are very well sung. The costumes are really beautiful, noticeably so even in black and white. And the sets are some of the most believable I've ever seen and actually help in the telling of the story instead of hindering it.

""The camera work would make Brian Large proud. Despite some infrequent claustrophobic scenes, the person directing or wielding the camera knows the story line well enough to assist in its telling. For example, in the first act, during 'Un d all'azzurro spazio,' when Chnier sings, ' Sol l'occhio vostro esprime umanamente qui un guardo di piet' (in your eyes alone did I see an expression of human compassion) the camera goes from a full frontal view of Del Monaco to pan around the back of Stella's head, so that you see him addressing himself to this young girl--perfectly done.

""Remembering that this Chnier was from a 1955 kinescope, the quality of the DVD is really surprisingly good, and the sound quality is even better than I expected. There are occasional fluctuations in the audio and some blips in the picture but nothing that would prevent the enjoyment of the moment. There are no subtitles, but the booklet provides a very good synopsis, and the acting is so well done that you really don't need the distractions of subtitles. This is a historical recording, in the best meaning of the term, and so very worth owning--you'll never see another Chnier like this one.""

From the Booklet

Rosina Wolf on Stella

Antonietta Stella (born 1929) made her debut, in Spoleto in 1950, as Leonora, in Il trovatore and repeated the role the following year at the Teatro dell'Opera, in Rome. In 1951 she also appeared in Stuttgart, Munich and Wiesbaden and then Florence, Naples, Rome, Catania, Parma, Turin, Lisbon and Perugia. In 1953 she made her debut not only at the Verona Arena but also at La Scala, where she remained until 1963. She made frequent appearances at the Vienna State Opera, Covent Garden, Paris, Brussels and Chicago. Her Met debut in 1956 was as the Trovatore Leonora. She continued to appear there until 1960.

At the time of Stella's debut her middle voice had both darkness and shine, a savory combination rarely encountered. The sound was ample down to D or C below the staff, where she didn't have to use chest resonance. (Most sopranos have no power there without it.) Above high A, however, the sound was less voluptuous. Still, no soprano in Italy had a more resplendent voice, not excepting Anita Cerquetti or Caterina Mancini.

Stella didn't inflect her tone, singing Butterfly with the same all-purpose color as Minnie. When music suited her sound she was hair-raising, as in Respighi's La fiamma (she told me, however, that she had been ""overcoached"" by the composer's widow).

At the time of her discovery Stella was working in a bakery. She never learned to care for her voice. Most singers are fastidious about avoiding certain foods, but she complained to me after a performance of La forza del destino that she would have sung better had she eaten her accustomed salami for breakfast.

A great ""natural,"" Stella lacked the technique to preserve her voice, and by her late 20s it was less luminous, the career fading when she was in her 30s. --Rosina Wolf

Rosina Wolf's repertoire ranged from Carmen to the Queen of the Night to Butterfly, Salome, Isolde, Brnnhilde and Norma. With Stefan Zucker she appeared on RAI, Italian state television, in music from I puritani. She is to be heard on Stefan Zucker: The World's Highest Tenor (currently out of print).

Giuseppe Taddei (born 1916) made his debut in 1936 at the Teatro dell'Opera, as the Herald in Lohengrin. During the war the Germans arrested him, in the Italian Alps, on the grounds that he was a member of the Resistance. In 1946 he made his debut at the Vienna State Opera. In 1947 he appeared as Figaro in Le nozze di Figaro at the Salzburg Festival. In that year he also sang at the Cambridge Theatre, London. He performed on all the principal Italian stages, also at Covent Garden and in Paris, Buenos Aires and Rio. Making his Met debut in 1951, he returned there in 1985 for the title role in Falstaff. A remarkably versatile artist, Taddei excelled not only as a dramatic baritone but also as a buffo. He is the Dulcamara on a 1955 kinescope of L'elisir d'amore (Bel Canto Society #D687 (DVD).",1336348800,,14150,4.842301324503311
8108500,3,B000EDWLDC,"While dramatically this video is all right, there are also quite a few problems that potential viewers must be aware of. As an old film, it is quite good: acting and especially singing are great. Here are the problems.

First: while the video quality is quite acceptable (black and white with some noise), I had some problem with the sound quality on my machine. The enclosing brochure claimed the use of PCM audio that is supposed to be better than Dolby Digital or DTS. That very well may be but I have no problem with Dolby sound disks and I have with this one. It would probably be all right on good systems. But then I don't have the best sound system.

Update: I have upgraded my speakers since writing this review and I have to admit that the sound experience has improved quite a bit.

Second: the video has no subtitles. That was especially irritating as I got it from Amazon description that there were at least English subtitles (they have changed that since I submitted a correction). There are none. You see ""no subtitles"" only after you open the box on the disk itself.

Third: there is a burnt-in logo in the lower corner of the screen. I know, small detail but did they really need to put it there?

So is there anything to sugarcoat the pill? Actually there is. I found the enclosed brochure to be quite informative. For example it mentions that the famous Melocchi method was not so great after all and might have contributed to del Monaco's eventual downfall. It has an interesting essay on singing besides the usual synopsis and brief info on singers.

So here you have it. Make you own decision. Like I said, the film itself is quite good, and soon the aforementioned problem stop bothering you. It's geared mainly towards connoisseurs who are familiar with the opera and like old school style of singing.",1277078400,4,1826,4.585889570552148
