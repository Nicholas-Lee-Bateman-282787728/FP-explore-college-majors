8122220,5,B000FGFBKI,"I never understood why this clever mockumentary did not get more attention.  It was available to stream on netflix awhile back but since it has been very hard to find.  Though one could find grounds for criticism (probably could have been tightened up a bit) and 5 stars is probably a bit overrated, there are so many priceless moments in this little gem that I am giving it this rating to bring it some well-earned recognition.  The group of frozen entree collectors (NBT stands for Never Been Thawed - which of course is necessary to have a truly mint condition frozen entree collectible) is the premise for an examination into their individual life stories.  The leader of the club also has a speed metal band who have transtioned to a Christian band for better marketing.  A very devout Christian gal works for an intercourse prevention hot-line and a gay man and woman get together after meeting in a gay conversion therapy session and realize they both share a strong desire to not burn in the fires of hell.  Amusing situations. Off-beat concepts.",1483920000,,1054,4.763736263736264
