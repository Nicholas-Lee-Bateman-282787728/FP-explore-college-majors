8053588,3,B0007XOAV0,I was expecting more tribal beats and not so much of a documentary.  But I gotta admit it was as advertised.,1376697600,,108,4.142857142857143
8053589,4,B0007XOAV0,"The footage is no-frills and very down-to-earth. There are only one or two camera angles which focus either on the drummers performing or the occasional dancer. It is quite clearly an excellent example of its subject, but comes with little explanation (there is no accompanying booklet in the DVD case) so a good deal of your own research is needed if you're planning to use it in the high-school classroom. One more problem with the DVD is the chapters don't quite line up with the presenter's explanation, so some rewinding is required if skipping through chapters. This is not a DVD for the uninitiated, but truely a great resource if used as part of a larger investigation into African drumming.",1189987200,3,699,4.833333333333333
