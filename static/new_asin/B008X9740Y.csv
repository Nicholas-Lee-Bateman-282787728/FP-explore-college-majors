8531686,5,B008X9740Y,"This is an excellent yoga video for the beginner or more experienced practitioner.  It is challenging at times, but not overwhelming and the 3 participants demonstrate different levels of skill. The instructor has a calming voice and manner. There is something respectful about the video as well.  I have purchased several copies and plan to give more as gifts. I also recommend the program to my patients.",1367625600,,406,5.044776119402985
