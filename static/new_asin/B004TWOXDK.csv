8440972,5,B004TWOXDK,"I sing many of LeGrand's compositions and love this disc.  My opinion mirrors the first reviewer's but would add that I did not like the female vocalists that much, however I loved Patrick Fiori's French version of the Summer of '42 and wish I could get the French lyrics but haven't found them yet.  Highly recommend this as a wonderful video of a great modern composer playing his own music with a great orchestra.",1397952000,2,416,4.608108108108108
8440973,5,B004TWOXDK,"French composer Michel Legrand is amazing! The guy writes film scores you know - ""A Man and A Woman"" may be his most identifiable, but there's ""Brian's Song"", ""Summer of `42"" and even Barbra Streisand's film Yentl! But he's also an accomplished JAZZ pianist! And he sings too - but more on that in a minute.

This DVD captures the full, nearly two-hour, concert he did in Paris in 2009. The 79 year-old genius conducted the concert with fifty years of his film music - from his first film scores with French ""new wave"" directors to the ""populist films like the previously mentioned Yentl. There was a full orchestra plus a smaller jazz rhythm section and - at times - the musicians form a ""big band"". Throughout the performance Legrand conducts and often plays the piano part. On many of the upbeat numbers he improvises. And then - on songs like ""Papa Can You Hear Me?"" from Yentl he sings. Not well I might say, but the guy wrote the songs so bear with him. The vocals, luckily, are not all by the composer. Five French singers - 2 men; three women... none of who were familiar to me - are there. One female - Maurane - belts out the Streisand vocals from Yentl.

The sound is great and the images are sharp. The direction, however, can be distracting. The camera never lingers on one shot or angle for more than five seconds! This may work well in pop ""music videos"" but it is fairly annoying (not to mention dizzying) to the viewer.

The DVD also contains an excellent 54-minute ""Behind the Scenes"" documentary which literally ""shadows"" Legrand from early rehearsals to his entrance on the stage for the performance. There are interviews with the other singers as well as Legrand's son plus a one-on-one with him. The interviews are all in French so you need to turn on the ""English Subtitles"" option. Though there is very little talking in the concert presentation, it would help to use this feature then as well as the titles of songs displayed on the screen are translated with the subtitles.

Those who know Legrand's music well will want this DVD. Those who only know the more popular ones will learn about some more. And any piano jazz fan will love watching the ""maestro"" play. I certainly did.
