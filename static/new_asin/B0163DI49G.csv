7456059,3,B0163DI49G,"I enjoyed the drama, but it could have been much better. The vampires were interesting and complex, as were some other characters in the program. Yet, the leading lady and the feeble attempt at romance detracted from what this drama could have been. She was portrayed as immature, helpless, and consistently rather dopey. The movie placed her in a category which would be similar to a schoolgirl getting a crush on her teacher. This character did not belong in this drama.

The costumes and settings were colorful. It is still interesting and worth watching in many respects. Nevertheless, I really have to wonder with the Korean writers think of women when they portray them them as being so utterly brainless in contrast with the clever and capable leading men.",1444176000,3,763,4.9147286821705425
8735505,5,B0163DI49G,Korea's attempt on vampires and good versus evil. I enjoyed this ensemble of actors and the story line.  have also viewed this series several times.,1494374400,,148,4.92
8735506,5,B0163DI49G,"I loved the drama, despite it's revolting blood sucking scenes. So far it is my favorite role for Lee Joon Gi. I like the personality, his facial expressions and calm manner of the character he plays. There wasn't anything lacking in any of the actors. I think I was most impressed by the lead female actress. The fancy clothing was nice. The vampire teeth didn't seem like a logical design (the ends weren't even pointy like a mosquito or a syringe). The make-up artist seemed amateurish at times, making this sophisticated character seem gaudy with the wrong colored lipstick and too much eye make-up. Some scenes didn't make sense, such as the actress wanting to kiss the hottie while he had blood on his face and clothes. That would make me gag.",1490659200,,749,4.681818181818182

8735514,5,B0163DI49G,"A wonderful vampire drama loaded with top notch talent who followed the manga (comic book) faithfully and created a perfect work of art. The manga has been enormously popular, and this drama is also a wildly popular success in Asia. I am both a fan of Korean dramas and classic vampire works, thus I had high hopes for this show and have been fully satisfied. I have viewed it several times so I can savor every delightful detail!",1445299200,3,430,4.5256410256410255
