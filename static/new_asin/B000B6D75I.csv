8082367,5,B000B6D75I,"Prior to buying this, I only have memory of watching Kids in the Hall on Comedy Central after high school.  I am glad I made the move to purchase these.  Copious amounts of Buddy Cole, Simon & Hecubus, the Headcrusher, Cathy & Kathie, and so on that were brought on by Dave Foley, Bruce McCulloch, Kevin McDonald, Mark McKinney, and Scott Thompson.  While other reviews for each box will inform you further about what each has to offer, my review is to tell you why you should buy this instead of each individually.  Of course, the prices on this and the individual boxes fluctuate, as I purchased this item for approx. $85, while buying them separately would have cost me north of $120.  But overall, if you are going to purchase these DVD's, do it this way.",1141257600,3,759,4.510948905109489
