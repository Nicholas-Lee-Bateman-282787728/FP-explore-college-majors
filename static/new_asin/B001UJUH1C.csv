, which is a good thing. The story features a great ensemble of voice actors (besides the VA who does Kenan..but to be fair...there wasn't much range to work with). Digimon isn't usually known for a strong background score, but this season the production company chose to change that by offering a blend of strong rock/keyboard blend that really works in the tense battles situations. The set itself is designed fairly well and as for the content...while I personally don't prefer Widescreen, it's bearable. Hopefully us Digimon fans won't get the Fox Home video shaft as in the company only releases 13 episodes and then abandons all plans for future volumes.",1244419200,4,1515,8.282208588957054
3802388,5,B001UJUH1C,"I'm glad to see Digimon Data Squad finally gets a dvd release... This is the first Digimon Series to be released on dvd... It's a shame that Digimon Season 1 to 4 never got a dvd release... I'm hoping that sales for Digimon Data Squad do well...

Digimon Data Squad is a excellent series next to Digimon Season 1 and 2... The company that did the dubbing had an excellent cast of well known voice actors and actresses such as Chrispen Freeman... Kids and die hard Digimon fans should enjoy the series... I hope that the Collection 2 DVD comes out soon...",1243296000,2,554,4.431372549019608
3802389,5,B001UJUH1C,"I'm very excited about this new Digimon Data Squad DVD set. There has not been a new Digimon DVD in several years and this series was my favorite. The action, story lines and characters in Data Squad are easily the best out of all the Digimon sagas. I tivo the episodes from TV when possible but have always wanted the series from start to finish. Bring on Collection Two..",1241395200,3,373,4.420289855072464
3802390,5,B001UJUH1C,"I am a huge Digimon fan who grew up with the series and was pleased to watch the series grow up just as fast as I did. It started off as being for children and tweens, but I feel like this season is also really intriguing for teens and young adults who were fans of seasons 1 and 2. Not only is Agumon back (and don't worry, his new voice will become tolerable) but I find this season as being far more dramatic and character-driven than say series 4, which seemed more like a Power Rangers/Digimon crossover gimmick. This is like watching Digimon in a teen drama setting (think 90210ish--I know its a stretch). It deals with much more intense themes like losing a parent, papparazzi intrusion, untrustworthy friends, and others. Granted, the episodes are grossly translated from the Japanese version (even changing Bombernanimon to Citramon - a giant orange), but overall I would say that this season was far better than seasons 3 or 4 and a must-have for any Digimon fan. I, personally, am super-jazzed its coming out on DVD and hopefully if this sells well, more Digimon seasons will be released.(:",1239235200,4,1101,4.680412371134021

I have been a fan of the Digimon series for years, ever since I caught ""Digimon Adventure"" on Fox Kids. The series has always been Americanised when dubbed into English, as one could expect. After all, there would be outrage should a poor defenceless child actually see a cartoon character smoking or getting a grazed knee! But that aside, the dubbed series has always been pretty high quality.
Digimon: Data Squad, however, is a different story. Data Squad is not a good series to use to introduce somebody to Digimon. This dub is, quite honestly, awful. The network who financed the series ripped away everything they could find (including covered breasts, giant cartoon bombs and names of Japanese cities). Not only that, but the director (who did a wonderful job on Digimon Adventure, I'll admit) also contributed to the rankness of the series. The chosen voice actors (for say... Gaomon and 'Marcus') barely fit the characters. Then there is the pure unbearable-ness of the whole thing. Somehow, what was originally a wonderful series of Digimon was turned boring and bland.

This particular series (dubbed) is an aquired taste and I would only recomend it to die-hard blonde childtren of about five. Toon Disney have lowered it to such a low standard.

Personally, I would suggest you spend $200 on Japanese language lessons and import the original, untouched version of the series rather than urinate away the cash for this version. Do you want the banana or the banana peel?",1237593600,3,1507,4.948616600790514

If you love Digimon Series like my self this be good thing to collect it might be really hard to find down the road later on.

To be truthful, I was a bit nervous too given the cheap price. The item arrived promptly and it great condition. We both were pleasantly suprised.

3802427,5,B001UJUH1C,"Digimon Data Squad is unlike any of the other seasons, that's why its so unique. You can hate it or love it but I say this is one of the best. This series drives a bit more to teens because there is some violence and sad moments but its still also for kids. The characters are great and they have AWESOME voice actors. Go check them out at wikipedia! So now a review of the episodes. The first few couple tell you about Marcus and his new digimon Agumon . Thomas(with Gaomon) and Yoshi(with Lalamon) from DATS help him out on these Digimon missions which is to capture wild Digimon that threaten the human world. Then there's other side stories like what most anime have but in most of the series they will be in the Digital World and in a lot of danger and sacrifice. YES I'M A DIGIMON FAN!(I'M 13) BUT THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SERIES . GO ANIME!!!",1286323200,4,851,4.226993865030675

3802429,1,B001UJUH1C,"I was a fan of the original series when I was younger (and me being a dork I still am), and this series is fine for kids, but for anime lovers I would recommend saving your money. The dub sounds lazy, there's no original japanese track on it, and don't even get me started on the editing. Overall this was released and meant to pass as a children's cartoon, not an anime. If you're a fan of the original digimon series looking for a walk down memory lane look elsewhere.",1273363200,14,470,4.233333333333333
