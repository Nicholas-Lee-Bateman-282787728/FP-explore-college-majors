7844277,5,6303337082,"The Fence is a revolutionary new documentary film about making peace between Israelis and Palestinians in the Middle East by keeping them apart. Take a 55-minute journey with 18-year-old producer and director Evan Vanderveer, from Gwynedd Valley, Pennsylvania, as he details the security fence being built by the Israelis around the West bank to stop alleged Palestinian homicide/suicide bombers from entering Israel. This video is an objective overview featuring insightful and exclusive interviews from both sides on the debate of whether the physical separation is warranted, necessary, or simply political, which the Major News Agencies could not attain. The film also features local footage of the current state of affairs, a historical section featuring the challenges in the region that sheds light on the background issues between the groups, and interviews with real people on both sides of the fence whom the separation will directly affect. This is the only documentary film to date on this issue.",1150156800,,1008,5.426751592356688
7844278,3,6303337082,"I was really hoping this movie would be good because I love Billy Wirth and his work.  I have to admit I was disappointed in the whole movie.  While the acting wasn't bad, I just didn't get the sense that things mattered as much to people as they should have.  The love affair between Billy's character and the sister-in-law wasn't developed nearly enough.  I just didn't feel for these people like I wanted to.  In my opinion, not enough attention was paid to character development.",1080864000,,483,4.635294117647059

7844280,4,6303337082,"This was a beautiful attempt at showing the growth of a child who is imprisoned at an early age for killing his abusive father. I throughly enjoyed the establishment of the relationships which Terry (Griff) develops throughout the film. I was pleasantly surprised that the racial over/under-tones were not discussed. The stereotypical is reversed here and only enhances the plot. Sometimes, leaving the viewer to his/her own analysis works for the best, as this movie expertly does. The film shows his sincerity of trying to stay on the straight and narrow and develop a ""new and positive"" life for himself on the outside. However, he seems to be thrown a curve ball once paroled. Even ""the law"" seems to not rehabiliate but hinder, which is a sad commentary of our penal system. The only bright light in his convoluted life is the sister of his only friend in ""the joint"". She accepts him, after some initial reservations with open arms. Alas, no fairy tale ending here, but a surprise or two show up in the last 10-15 minutes...END",981849600,,1033,4.808988764044944
