I ordered the UK ""Monsters We Met"", which is another version of the same show. Both are entertaining and educational, but not the same. The footage may be, but the narrators are the first noticeable differences. Now order each version and tell me which you prefer. This gets a 4, the other got a 5. I may be American, but the delivery was more like what I was looking for in these shows. Both are great, and some will prefer this version. You'll never know until you see them",1402790400,,593,4.256637168141593
8321887,3,B001MUP8JK,"Bought this video for my son and realized that it was a long-winded documentary that tries to use fairly old graphics to describe a world for the first explorers in North America (and the animals they encourtered), Austrlia's Aborigine's and other areas of the world.  The Graphics were probably made in the late 70's/early 80's, so someone who views this as if they were watching the Walking With Series graphics is going to be very disappointed.  It was informative in some aspects, but I wouldn't say that this would be comparable to the Discovery Channel DVD's of Prehistoric Animals.",1328054400,,588,4.929292929292929
