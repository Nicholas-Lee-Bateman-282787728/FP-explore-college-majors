For decades the Catholic church not only sheltered but enabled priests that it knew were pedophiles, moving them from parish to parish and giving them access to hundreds of victims.  Corruption and complicity go to the very highest level - the pope himself.  Victims bravely share their anguish here in hopes of informing others of the danger and preventing damage to others.

Martin Luther left the church because of fiscal and moral corruption - and nothing has changed in the centuries since.  The church is supposed to be the place that shelters and nurtures the flock of faithful, not prey upon them. This film is a cry for justice.",1490659200,,706,4.809917355371901
