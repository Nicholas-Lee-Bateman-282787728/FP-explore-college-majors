5851835,5,B00DS79HK6,Great family story for Xmas!! Shows how families can find a way to become a family again after a tiff.,1387238400,,102,4.15
5851836,4,B00DS79HK6,"Christmas is right around the corner, it's a time for families to come together and enjoy one each others company and to celebrate together, but for sisters Kate and Melanie Christmas hasn't been that way. After a disastrous wedding five years earlier the once close sisters no longer speak to each other. With the pain and absence of Kate and Melanie, their parents marriage is suffering and is close to an end. Kate is determined to put the past behind her and reach out to Melanie to save their parents' marriage. She has a big plan to get everyone together at the house where they grew up, where there were happier memories, the only problem is that somebody else is living there. Will Kate be able to get her family together for Christmas and make amends with Melanie before it's to late?

Norman Rockwell presents Coming Home for Christmas, a heart-warming story of hope and forgiveness during the holiday season. Many times when it comes to Christmas movies you get very cheesy films; however, this one was a sweet story about how important family is, although it has a few cheesy moments overall I really enjoyed this movie and lose the message that it presents. This is a great movie for friends and family to watch throughout the Christmas season.

I received this DVD complimentary in exchange for an honest review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.",1385078400,,1364,4.726890756302521
5851837,4,B00DS79HK6,"While the plot is a bit predictable, the story line is excellent!  It's not too mushy, not inappropriate at all, and was enJOYable to view at home.  The acting wasn't bad, although it was awkward at times.  We're not sure if it was due to the directing in this movie, or the producing, but at times the movie seemed a bit ""off.""  However, we still really liked it and were glad that we watched it!",1385078400,,397,4.253333333333333
5851838,4,B00DS79HK6,"Kate and Melanie haven't spoken in 5 years, not since the disastrous day that Kate walked out of her sister's wedding without explanation. And now their parents are separating, it is up to Kate and Melanie to join forces to bring the family together for Christmas!

A sweet heartwarming Christmas movie, very much made for families with its simple but comforting message of family and forgiveness. I don't want to say too much and give away the story!

This was a clean movie the whole way through, there was nothing that I really thought stood out as objectionable at all, so I could definitely say that it is great for families!

Overall it was a fun, feel good movie, for getting you in the Christmas spirit!

5851839,3,B00DS79HK6,"This is is a heartwarming and fun film that the entire family can sit down and enjoy. I was unfamiliar with the actors involved, but the majority of them are Country music singers from Canada. So, the music in the film is good, and I am glad they incorporated it into the story. I know I usually review faith-based films, so I think I need to mention that is one is not. However, it is family-friendly and clean and one that does cover forgiveness and the importance of family and friends who become like family. There are poignant moments, but also romance and comedy in the mix. It's not a great, sure to be a classic, but it is a good film for your personal dvd library to have on hand to watch with friends and family.

Disclaimer: I received a copy of the dvd from Flyby Promotions for review purposes. I was not required to write a positive review and all opinions are my own.",1384905600,3,882,4.313253012048193
5851840,5,B00DS79HK6,"As long as you have siblings, you are bound to come to a point where conflict ensues no matter how great the relationship. Such is the case for sisters Kate ( Carly McKillip) and Melanie (Britt McKillop) O'Brien who have remain close despite their differences at least while they were young. Kate has always lived in the shadow of her sister Melanie, who was outgoing in school, always had plenty of boys who wanted to date her and has always been beautiful and successful at anything that crosses her path. Quite different from Kate who was shy and didn't see herself as beautiful when hidden behind the glasses she needed to wear. During a family Christmas, the O'Brien family decided to incorporate a time capsule to be opened at a later date. It was during that time that the division in the O'Brien family began. When Kate buried her beloved sisters favorite marionette in the backyard as her contribution. In order to discover the time capsule, all members of the family must be present because they each possess a portion of the clue to find it again.

Only the family never dreamed that years later, their family would be torn apart. When Kate discovers that Melanie's soon-to-be husband is busy flirting at their wedding with a bridesmaid, Kate storms out telling her sister she can't be a part of watching her destruction of the perfect life. Without telling her the specifics, she abruptly leaves and places the parents at odds now that the girls are much older. Somehow the parental authority doesn't hold much weight. When faced with the dismiss of their daughters relationship, even Al (George Canyon) and Wendy( Amy Jo Johnson) begin to fall apart in their marriage beginning when the family home goes into foreclosure and they end up in another home. Now faced with no longer having anything in common, Wendy and Al decide a separation and divorce are their only hope for a future.

However when the girls learn that their parents are divorcing based on the problems stemming from Kate and Melanie's conflict, they decide to see if one last family Christmas in their old home will be just the right about of kindling to fan the flames of restoration for all of them. Only now the family home has been sold to Mike (Ben Hollingsworth) a Marine veteran and woodworker. Is is possible to pull off the ultimate Christmas miracle? You'll have to pick this one up to find out.

I received Coming Home for Christmas by director Vanessa Parise and Fly By Promotions for my honest review and did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review. This is such a heart warming family movie that I believe everyone can relate to. For me, even though my brother and I were close, we had our moments that undoubtedly tested our parents resolve. I love how they are willing to work together despite their differences and try hard to work through things without finding forgiveness with one another first. We see how well that works later in the movie. This is a movie about hope, faith and forgiveness despite how things may initially look on the outside and is a wonderful warm movie to begin the Christmas season with. I'd rate this one a 5 out of 5 stars and will look forward to incorporating this into our Christmas movie time each year. Finally a great movie with a message that is perfect for families.",1384300800,8,3322,4.694682675814751
5851841,2,B00DS79HK6,"I really love Christmas movies and wanted this to be so good, but..........Coming home for Christmas is not a very interesting movie. There is no depth of character. It's like a silly movie about two sisters having a fight and then  the whole family starts having trouble for years. No one is sorry or want to help each other until the parents break up then they start to think about what's been done.
  One thing I did like about Coming Home For Christmas was the girls decided to try to get their parents back together and want to have Christmas in the old family house. Since someone else is living there they have to find a way to get him to let them celebrate Christmas at his house. That was a fun part.
  If you love Christmas movies and just want to have a simple movie to watch you will like this one.

5851842,5,B00DS79HK6,"Kate and Melanie were once as close as sisters could be. Until one day when Kate did what Melanie deemed to be unforgivable. Five years later, the girls still aren't talking, which is taking a toll on their parents, who decide to separate.

Kate decides to make it her mission to not only bring her parents back together for Christmas, but also to restore the loving friendship she once shared with her sister and best friend. Kate longs for the days when her family was close and the fond memories they shared in a house her parents have since lost due to the bad economy.

But will her plan succeed?

Melanie seems to have the perfect life. She married into money, has a 5,000 square foot home, indulges in spa days, and has a seemingly wide circle of influential friends. But is everything as it seems? When Kate discovers her sisters real life, will she be able to convince Melanie to make amends?

Throw into the mix a budding romance with a handsome soldier, some humor, the loss of a father, and the sad background of one who never had a family and youve got an interesting mix meshed into a delightful story.

While Coming Home for Christmas is not a Christian movie, it is a feel-good, fun-to-watch show that highlights some great discussion topics, such as,

Forgiveness  can Melanie ever forgive Kate for what she did? The Bible tells us to forgive others in various passages in the Bible, including Matthew 6:15.

Importance of family  Kate and Melanie grew up in a family that shared a lot of love for each other. They spent time together, sang together, and made each other a priority. God highly values family.

Grief  throughout the story, we see the grief of a young boy who has lost his father. Hes not the only one who has suffered loss. Enter Mike who knows firsthand all about grief and loneliness. The Bible discusses how we can comfort others after knowing firsthand the way God comforts us in our time of need. (2 Cor 1:4).

Marriage  Can Kate and Melanies parents move past their differences and once again experience the deep love they had for each other? Marriage is of utmost importance to God.

I highly recommend Coming Home for Christmas, especially for those mom-daughter nights or movie nights with the girls. It contains nothing objectionable and is appropriate for tweens and up.

Seriously though, was production asleep? Was the script writer incapable of doing a little, tiny bit of research? I cringed when I saw the main love interest wearing ill-fitting US Army dress blues (a uniform), with long hair and a 5 o'clock shadow. Seriously....SERIOUSLY? Can we try for just a bit of realism here, just a bit? Then later he says he was in the MARINES. I had to turn it off. If you're going to make a movie, even a low-budget one, at least put in a little effort. This was just crap film-making.",1418256000,,651,4.4789915966386555

5851869,5,B00DS79HK6,"The was a very well done Christmas movie.  It is very reminiscent of the 'feel-good' Hallmark Channel movies that are produced each year; but whereas I think many of the Hallmark Channel movies have a 'cheaply made' feel to them, as well recycled story lines given they make a dozen each year; I felt this film was a bit better than most of the Hallmark Channel movies.  I think the cast did a really good job, and it really had a nice family story...not the same cliche themes we see recycled with the Hallmark movies.  Don't get me wrong, I do like many of the Hallmark movies, but if they make a dozen a year, I may really like 6 of them, and feel the other 6 are a waste.  I think maybe if they cut back from a dozen to maybe just 6 a year, and put that extra time and money into a bit of a better script and better production values, then they would have more movies like this one here.  Now this film would never win an Oscar, but if you like feel-good holiday movies, I think you will enjoy this one.",1416960000,4,1007,4.11734693877551
