8204598,5,B000S76MU2,"I teach social studies at the secondary level and have two young daughters. My wife came upon this DVD by chance at the library, and our daughters not only loved it, but they learned a lot. My then-four year-old was talking about George Washington and the United States in ways I could never, ever have taught her myself. It's pitch-perfect developmentally for preschool and grade school and is a fantastic introduction to the basics of government, history, and civics. At a time when many elementary schools are less apt to teach social studies in favor of math and science, this is a wonderful primer and opens doors to all kinds of parent-child discussions. Highly recommended.",1382140800,,680,4.921739130434783
