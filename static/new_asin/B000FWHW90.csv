2592899,5,B000FWHW90,"These films used to be on TV all the time. I was amazed at how clever the plots were. I didn't remember some of them. ""Weird Woman"" is my favorite ""B-film"" and I'm always recommending it to people. Movies used to be so entertaining ! It's great to have this collection available to film fans. We can overlook Chaney's stiffness, as the rest of the cast really compensates for it.",1167782400,,379,4.428571428571429
2592900,5,B000FWHW90,"If you were... this is a good buy for you.  The transfer to DVD is excellent, both video and audio.  Inner Sanctum aired at a time when network television was still in its early youth and this mini-series starring Lon Chaney presents a very nostalgic ""look back"" into this era in broadcasting.  It's fortunate these episodes survived their stay in the ""vault"" and are available today in such pristine coindition.",1167782400,,412,4.857142857142857
2592901,5,B000FWHW90,"I had previously never heard of the Inner Sanctume series.  I was on vacation in San Francisco and saw this set at a Best Buy.  I passed on it then but remembered to look it up on Amazon.com.

I must say these are fine murder mysteries.  They have the right atmosphere and the acting and story are well done.  The first one while good, is the weakest of the half dozen.  They only get better from there and the last one on disc two is the best because neither I nor my wife could figure out ""who did it.""

I don't find much on TV these days that I like (Heroes being one) so these old b&w murder mysteries as well as film noir and all the Humphrey Bogart films (many I've never seen before) fit the bill perfectly.  I'm glad these are being made available.  It's a shame that some young people shun them simply because they are old and in b&w, but its their loss.",1164067200,4,863,4.119760479041916
2592902,4,B000FWHW90,"Because I have always had a major soft spot for creepy-crawly B-movies of the 1930s and '40s, and because I was a quick convert from VHS (so ten years ago!) to DVD, INNER SANCTUM MYSTERIES: THE COMPLETE MOVIE COLLECTION is most welcome.  And now that we already have the DRACULA, FRANKENSTEIN, MUMMY, INVISIBLE MAN, WOLF MAN, BELA LUGOSI, and BORIS KARLOFF COLLECTIONS, perhaps next Halloween we'll get MAN-MADE MONSTER (also starring Lon Chaney Jr., with Lionel Atwill in strong support), NIGHT MONSTER (Lugosi and Atwill), THE MAD GHOUL (George Zucco and Robert Armstrong), and HOUSE OF HORRORS (Rondo Hatton and Martin Kosleck) together in another nice set, or the perfectly silly CAPTIVE WILD WOMAN/JUNGLE CAPTIVE/JUNGLE WOMAN trilogy coupled with MURDER AT THE ZOO and THE MONSTER AND THE GIRL.",1162080000,6,799,5.1937984496124034
2592903,5,B000FWHW90,"I had taped a few of these Inner Sanctum films off TV many years ago. This kind of fare is quite enjoyable to me. Now, a DVD compilation of all 6 films at a reasonable price is a real treat. All star Chaney Jr, and most include Milburn Stone (Doc from TV's Gunsmoke), Evelyn Ankers, Brenda Joyce; a sort of repertory company. Most are only a little bit over an hour long, and very easy to watch. The acting is above par (with the exception of Aquanetta in Weird Woman), and my favorite of the bunch was Strange Confession. Lon Chaney Jr. was a fine actor, as seen in his previous filmography (The Wolf Man, Of Mice & Men) and he shows good confidence in these fine little mysteries. It's a career that didn't take off, and it's too bad. I enjoyed these short movies for exactly what they were intended to be: low budget films that held my interest. With all the garbage out there, it's something I know I can come back to when I have an hour to spare and be very entertained.",1161993600,3,975,4.247311827956989
2592904,5,B000FWHW90,"Just in time for Halloween . . . More thrills and chills than you can shake your broom stick at. The best of the lot is Inner Sanctum Mysteries, a six-film collection of death, dementia and darkness based on the spine-chilling Inner Sanctum Mystery radio series of the '40s. All the flicks star Lon Chaney Jr., who really never got his deserved credit, his legacy lost among the huge shadows cast by his father. The stories are puffy and pale, but the suspense holds up nicely, certainly not in the Hitchcock or Luten schools, but edgy enough for you to keep the lights on . . . just in case. This is not to say that the Karloff collection is not worthy. These are ""forgotten"" films, released for the first tike of DVD because they never achieved the success or status of Frankenstein or The Mummy. Yet Karloff personifies the word ""menace."" Lon Chaney Jr. joins him for The Black Castle, but it's Tower of London takes the highpoint. More a film about a horrific time in history than a horror film, Karloff plays a bloodthirsty executioner to Basil Rathbone's evil King Richard III. Torture has never tasted so terrifying.",1161734400,3,1123,4.62
2592905,5,B000FWHW90,"If the Val Lewton box set left you wanting more, then the ""Inner Sanctum"" box set will fill the void very well. Movies like ""Weird Woman"" and ""Calling Dr. Death"" can match Lewton in terms of pacing and visuals; I saw quite a few similarities in all of these movies.
As stated in other reviews the films aren't ""scary-horror"" per se, but more of a psychological creepy horror that gets under your skin and doesn't let go until the film is over. Just like Lewton there's not a lot of budget being tossed around here, but the action  moves quickly and the cinematography is atmospheric and well done.
I enjoyed the 1940's pulp magazine vibe of all the movies included in this box set, and was pleased to see Universal finally return to single-sided discs (thank you!). Take a chance on these films and you will be surprised.",1160179200,5,821,4.547297297297297
2592906,5,B000FWHW90,"Once again, the folks at Universal have given us something to get excited about.  Here are all 6 of the studio's ""Inner Sanctum"" mysteries in one low-priced set.  Fans of Lon Chaney Jr. who were disappointed with Image's recent ""Lon Chaney Collection"" will certainly find much to love here.  I'll readily admit that he lacked the acting chops of his contemporaries like Karloff and Lugosi, but his roles here are varied and give this ""black sheep"" of Universal horror a chance to shine.

Remember, these feature-length (well...most of them clock in at just over an hour) films were based on the popular radio series of the same name.  As such, they tend to be a bit ""talky.""  But the production values are high, and a couple of the stories actually generate some suspense.  In addition to the sharp black & white photography, the best thing about these films is probably the supporting cast.  Frequent Chaney co-star Evelyn Ankers, as well as Universal players Anne Gwynne and J. Carroll Naish are on-hand to lend support to the affable Chaney.  Some of the humor hasn't aged well, but that's hardly uncommon for films of this period.

I hope Universal will continue the trend set by this and the ""Boris Karloff Collection,"" and release more of their lesser-known films from the vaults, such as Man Made Monster and Night Monster.  For now, we can enjoy these almost-forgotten gems from Hollywood's Golden Age.",1159228800,38,1410,4.857740585774058
2592907,5,B000FWHW90,"I purchased these on VHS years ago.  And, over the years, I have watched them several times.  They are some of Universal Studios best short movies and well deserve wide distribution.  I must admit that I am a great fan of Lon Chaney, Jr. and the additional talents of Evelyn Ankers in any Universal production is a definite plus.  Without previewing each episode, I will summarize in saying that these short movies are well worth the money, the time, and I am grateful to Universal for releasing them.  They are a treasure and a collection of movie history.",1150416000,69,557,4.642857142857143
2592908,5,B000FWHW90,"From the silent era to the late 1940's no other studio could do horror and mystery films like Universal.  The lighting, shadows, great sets, music, awesome camera work and actors gave their films a very distinct atmosphere.  They gave us Dracula, The Mummy, The Old Dark House and the Wolfman making legends of Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney, Jr.  Now Universal has opened up their movie vaults once more, to give us another classic collection. The Inner Sanctum films were based on the popular radio series of the same name.

The Inner Sanctum Mysteries Complete Movie Collection set includes the following films:

Calling Dr. Death (1943)
Weird Woman (1944)
Dead Man's Eyes (1944)
The Frozen Ghost (1945)
Strange Confession (1945)

Second- tier Universal releases, but, as always, first-rate Chaney, Jr. performances. The co-stars are also great. Some of these were Shock Theatre televised back in the day.

2592911,5,B000FWHW90,"Very good set of six 40's Universal mysteries, all starring Lon Chaney Jr.  They may be B-type films, but the filming and black-and-white photography is perfect on each film.  Most of the movies start in a spooky-looking study or library with a crystal ball on a table.  A warped looking face floating in the ball starts telling about the story that will soon commence.  The best ones are Weird Woman, The Frozen Ghost, and Pillow of Death.  The DVD transfer is excellent.  Highly, highly recommended.",1453507200,4,501,4.8352941176470585

2592917,5,B000FWHW90,"I just finished watching all 6 pictures in order, 3 on each dvd. And over all found them to be interesting mysteries ( little horror or supernatural) all starring Mr. Chaney in a suit and looking quite dignified in some of the rolls.
  Here are the films with my rating.
 Calling Dr. Death, with the very pretty Patricia Morison as his office nurse 4 stars.
 Weird Woman, with Evelyn Ankers as the villain! Best film with good performances. 5 stars
  Dead Man's eyes, has a good twist and is my personnel favorite. 5 stars
  The Frozen Ghost. Also with Evelyn Ankers and Elena Verdugo ( the gypsy girl from House of Frankenstein and years later on TV with Robert Young in Dr. Welby. ( 1969-1976)  5 stars
 Strange Confession, with pretty Brenda Joyce and J. Carrol Naish as suave villain. And early Lloyd Bridges ( of Sea Hunt TV fame) 5 stars
 Pillow of Death, last and least, although with supernatural element. With Chaney as psychotic killer.  3 stars

 Over all  a very nice collection and I highly recommend it to classic B film mystery collectors.",1425081600,5,1054,4.591397849462366

2592925,3,B000FWHW90,"I have to say I was somewhat disappointed in this selection. Although a fan of Jr's turn as Larry Talbot, most of these movies didn't really register with me. Particularly the selections on the first disc came across as bad soap opera-ish performances from the actors and generally weak stories. I did feel the second disc was better as I liked Strange Confession despite the sudden ending, and Pillow of Death despite the silly title actually kept me guessing who was guilty.

Still, if you like murder mystery movies of this era you don't have a lot to lose. The Amazon price as of this writing is under $9.00 for 6 movies and you will likely find at least a couple of these to your liking. I don't regret the purchase but this will probably be moved to the back of my shelves not to be seen again for quite awhile.

2592934,5,B000FWHW90,"The Inner Sanctum films afforded Lon Chaney the chance to act minus heavy monster makeup & the films have been beautifully restored here on this DVD collection.

""Calling Dr. Death"" is a good, entertaining film featuring Lon as Dr. Mark Steele, a man trapped in a loveless marriage and entangled in a romance with his lovely secretary. Soon, Dr. Steele's wife is murdered & the good doctor is caught up in an investigation that leads to the wrong man being convicted until the real killer is caught.

""Weird Woman"" is another goodie, dealing with voodoo superstitions & of course, murder. Murder would be a prevalent theme throughout the Inner Sanctum films.

""Dead Man's Eyes"" and ""Strange Confession"" were my favorites of the collection. Very strong films & J. Carrol Naish was almost unrecognizable to me at first, I'm so used to seeing him as Daniel from ""House of Frankenstein."" He was suitably slimy in his role & the mystery of ""Strange Confession"" is just what exactly is inside the bag Lon Chaney's character has with him.

The last film ""Pillow of Death"" was a little more routine, but overall, I rate the Inner Sanctum mysteries a full 5 stars.",1374710400,3,1155,4.788944723618091

I admit, his angsty way of acting can grate on nerves for a while, but I still enjoy this type of film and the Sanctum series are very fun to kill time with. The Weird Woman film, I think would appeal to about anyone ---just got the Dementia Vibe going on and the ending, was a good pay-off.

2592944,4,B000FWHW90,"""This is the Inner Sanctum. A strange fantastic world controlled by a mass of living, pulsating flesh, the mind. It destroys, distorts, creates monsters, commits murder! Yes, even you without knowing can commit murder!""

So informs us the floating head and bulbously distorted nose of actor David Hoffman, conveniently placed in a crystal ball in the middle of a table in an empty boardroom at the beginning of the first five (of six) of Universal's Inner Sanctum mysteries. Only loosely inspired by the popular radio series and dispensing with its frequently jocular tone, they veer more towards traditional mysteries and light noirs rather than gothic horrors, all headlined by Lon Chaney Jr. as he neared the end of his Universal contract. The parts aren't exactly within his usual comfort range, calling for brilliant doctors/professors/professionals who have women fighting over them (which may be why he's often recommended having a workout and a shower in the gym in a few of them), but he acquits himself surprisingly well and taken as a whole it's a surprisingly enjoyable if resolutely undemanding series.

Calling Dr. Death is a decent enough little noir with mild horror undertones as Lon Chaney Jr.'s psychiatrist who can see into the mind of his patients but not through the women in his life starts to wonder whether he's broken his Hippocratic Oath and is responsible for the murder of his unfaithful wife after he has one of his blackouts. A tale of hypnosis, amnesia and obligatory stylised dream scenes with much of the opening section of the picture carried by Chaney's voice over inner monologue, it's a slick programmer with a couple of decent twists even if it is straining credibility a tad that the ladies just can't resist him. But it's J. Carrol Naish's detective on the case who makes the biggest impression and has the best moment with his mournful summary of his lot in life: ""Some place at this very moment a crime is being committed. All I can do is sit and wait. I start with death, I look for life and, when I find it, I've got to destroy it.""

Weird Woman is easily the best known of the series, though it's a less impressive take on Fritz Lieber's novel Conjure Wife than the later Night of the Eagle, not least because it ultimately explains away the supernatural element that drives the story and gives the villain a very different motive. Chaney is once again the kind of professor who just drives women wild, returning from a field trip with a superstitious young wife and incurring the jealousy of a former fling. When he spurns his wife's charms and protections, things suddenly start going very wrong for him, but is the reason a witch or a bitch?

For a story built around what people will willingly believe, it's particularly hard to suspend your disbelief enough to buy into every gal on campus chasing Chaney, but that's not the only shortcoming. It's not so good at ratcheting up the paranoia that the story required and the supernatural aspect is poorly served, not least in the opening pagan ritual that looks more like a Luau put on for the tourists, while the ending is a definite copout. But on its own terms it works well enough and you do get a chance to spot Elizabeth Russell, Simone Simon's striking sister under the skin in Cat People, in a more substantial supporting role for once.

Dead Man's Eyes has the most outrageous premise of the series, with Chaney's brilliant artist once again just catnip to the ladies - even his prospective father-in-law thinks he's ""a real man"" and offers him his own eyes as replacements after Lon loses his sight in a freak eyewash accident. Of course, he means after his death, but that comes a lot sooner than he expected, leaving Chaney the chief suspect in his murder...

It's a silly plot played straight, which adds to the charm, and it's nice to see Paul Kelly in a rare non-creepy guy role, though Acquanetta as the model he fancies but who naturally has the hots for Chaney - so much so that she fears losing him if he regains his sight - is a definite liability: she's fine at the standing still bit but not so hot at anything involving moving or connected speech.

The Frozen Ghost is perhaps the most enjoyable of the Inner sanctum movies, yet again offering Lon Chaney Jr. as a tortured hero the entire female cast find absolutely irresistible - all three of them just gotta have him (must be the pencil moustache) - here a rich mentalist who suffers a crisis of confidence when he hypnotises a drunken sceptic he wishes dead into a hypnotic trance only for his subject to promptly drop dead, and on live radio too. Even though exonerated by the coroner, his guilt drives him to ditch his beautiful assistant and fianc Evelyn Ankers and, on the advice of business manager Milburn Stone, seek refuge in Tala Birell's wax museum, which is exactly the kind of soothing, calm environment he needs even if Martin Kosleck's creepy discredited plastic surgeon-cum-waxworks sculptor goes out of his way to make him feel unwelcome. Of course it's not long before Birell disappears after an argument with Chaney, and it's not long before her niece Elena Verdugo - who naturally also has the hots for Chaney - goes missing too and he's once again wandering the streets wondering if he's killed her, and this time Douglas Dumbrille's Shakespeare-quoting detective (""I'm not paid to think!"") agrees with him - if only he could find the body... It's as silly as it sounds, but highly enjoyable in its resolutely untaxing way.

With a seriously wounded Lon Chaney Jr. telling an old school friend and now successful lawyer ""You never heard anything like I have to tell you,"" you can't help expecting rather more from Strange Confession than it delivers. What you actually get is 55 minutes of increasing motive for an eventual murder. Chaney isn't catnip this timed but a happily married research chemist selflessly working for the benefit of all mankind (as he never tires of reminding everyone) alongside Lloyd Bridges as his hearty assistant. Unfortunately his boss, J. Carroll Naish in smooth Edward G. Robinson mode, is dedicated to selfishly cashing in on his discoveries and blacklists him when he tries to stop his work being abused. After years in the wilderness and only able to work in a drug store he foolishly goes back to work for Naish, who promptly packs him off to Africa so he can cash in on an impending influenza epidemic with Chaney's unproven wonder drug and also move in on his wife Brenda Joyce. Tragedy inevitably strikes and our mild-mannered hero finally snaps and, furious that his ideas are in Naish's head, decides he wants them back...

It's an okay entry, but nothing hugely imaginative, confining its ambitions to the ranks of the second feature rather than the main attraction. Once again Universal's DVD offers a good transfer, albeit with the Realart reissue end credits.

Dispensing with the floating head intro, the absurdly titled final Inner Sanctum film, Pillow of Death, is the weakest despite throwing in everything but the kitchen sink. Lon Chaney Jr is once again the object of desire, though he's only got one woman chasing after him - Brenda Joyce's secretary - and his wife is dead before we meet her, smothered in her bed. Naturally, she's not the last to go that way in a mystery involving a bickering family in a rambling house with a chain-rattling ghost in the attic, a Peeping Tom neighbor with the hots for Brenda constantly appearing out of secret passages and a phoney psychic who may or may not be faking the ghost of Chaney's wife to point the finger at him. As you'd expect from a film with a title that ridiculous, the script is rather ragged at the best of times and it has the feel of contractual obligation hanging heavily over it (as well as being the last in the series, it was Chaney's last film as a Universal contract star). The most divisive of the series - people tend to think it's either the best or the worst - it does at least throw in a bit of a surprise revelation at the end by making perhaps the most suspicious character for once turn out to be the guilty party.

2592946,3,B000FWHW90,"The Inner Sanctum Collection from Universal includes all six Inner Sanctum films based on the wildly popular radio show which ran concurrently with them:Calling Dr. Death(released Dec/43),Weird Woman(released Mar/44),Dead Man's Eyes(released Nov/44),The Frozen Ghost(released June/45,)Strange Confession(released Oct/45)and finally Pillow of Death(released Dec/45).All of these films star Lon Chaney Jr.,though I must admit that I have never been a big Chaney Jr.fan;his late father cast a very large shadow he was never able to get out from under. But he does do a credible job throughout and though his co stars were often an uneven bunch,they got better towards the end of the series with the likes of Edward Bromberg,Douglass Dumbrille and future TV stars such as Milburn Stone and Lloyd Bridges. About one of his worst co stars was in Dead Man's Eyes,with Acquanetta playing Tanya. She was as stiff as they come and as her name implies,her acting was certainly all wet!
All of the films start out in a vacated room in which the center piece is a large table. On that table sits a large glass crystal ball,inside which is a disembodied head. The head tells us that WE are as capable of committing murder as those we are about to see. The films are a mixture of whodunits and psychological thrillers. Chaney is always the central character,playing a lawyer or neurologist ,his character getting sucked into events that seem out of his control and which he has no seeming way of stopping. When the plot gets thick he,more often than not,can be heard talking/thinking about what he has seen,is seeing or feeling at that moment. In other words we eavesdrop on his mind.
All the films are about 66 minutes long and would have been part of the filler of the bill in the theaters at the time,along with the newsreels,cartoons and the main feature.
I don't think there are any here that rate any more more than 3 stars,being the B's they were. All have been remastered very well though and look wonderful.

Universal's Inner Sanctum films don't stand in that august company: these are resolutely mediocre movies. In each movie, Lon Chaney Jr.--no great actor--plays a variant on the same respectable bore (a doctor, a professor, a chemist, etc.) who gets caught up in a murder mystery usually involving some vaguely supernatural element (hypnosis, witchcraft, and the like) and sexual jealousy, with little bits of horror or noir thrown into the mix. The plots are laden with predictable turns, contrived silliness--an artist happens to store his eye medication and acid near each other for someone to conveniently switch? uh oh!--and lots of earnest hand-wringing from Chaney. Yet despite their fundamental weaknesses, there's something entertaining about these modest little films, from brief moments of true suspense to interesting turns by some of the lesser-known actors.

2592955,4,B000FWHW90,"I managed to watch all six films in this set over the course of a three-day weekend and was surprised at how different each of them was from the others. There were similarities in the way star Lon Chaney Jr. played each of his roles, of course, but the roles were all different from each other and the plots didn't follow a set formula. Although the series was adapted from the ""Inner Sanctum"" radio program, only the first of the series seemed like it would have played better on radio. In each film, Chaney plays a man of means who is suffering from some inner torment and wracked with self-doubt, all a variation on his signature role of Lawrence Talbot, an English heir who transformed into the title character of THE WOLF MAN (1941). He's quite intense and can be physically rough on his co-stars. Yet at the same time, he's usually the object of affection of two or more women in the films. Chaney was never a romantic leading man, so it's odd and rather puzzling to see so many attractive leading ladies throw themselves at him. All six were marketed as horror films, although the horror elements are pretty mild, when they're present at all. These were B-movies and are pretty short in length, ranging from 61-66 minutes each.

CALLING DR. DEATH (1943) features Chaney as a neurologist who wakes up one morning in his office with no memory of what happened on the previous two days, no alibi, and the sobering news that his cheating wife has been murdered. His loyal nurse, played by Patricia Morison, tries to protect him, but a tenacious police inspector (J. Carrol Naish) dogs him at every turn. Not a lot actually happens onscreen, since so much is described in dialogue and interior voiceover monologues, just like a radio show. But the plot is very much like a Cornell Woolrich novel and the dark, expressionistic lighting is very much in the film noir mode, a full year before PHANTOM LADY (1944) emerged as the first true film noir production of a Woolrich novel, also from Universal.

WEIRD WOMAN (1944): In this one, Chaney plays a college professor identified as an ""ethnologist"" who brings a new bride (Anne Gwynne) from ""the islands"" back to the campus, incurring the jealous wrath of the library administrator (Evelyn Ankers) whom he'd once dated. He recruits a gorgeous young college girl (Lois Collier) to be his research assistant and she falls for him as well. Interesting look at campus politics, something rarely shown in classic Hollywood films, with one subplot dealing with a rival professor (Ralph Morgan) whose latest book has plagiarized the long-forgotten thesis of a dead student. There are five interesting women characters, played by five colorful actresses, and the screenplay, based on Fritz Leiber's novel, ""Conjure Wife,"" was written by a woman (Brenda Weisberg).

DEAD MAN'S EYES (1944) stars Chaney as a painter who loses his eyesight in an ""accident"" that may have been arranged on purpose by the young woman serving as his model (Acquanetta) who just happens to be jealous of his rich fiance (Jean Parker). The fiancee's father decrees that his eyes will be donated to Chaney upon his death, so when the father is found murdered, Chaney is the chief suspect. The solid supporting cast includes Paul Kelly as Chaney's psychiatrist buddy and Thomas Gomez as the detective investigating the case. I have to say I was quite surprised by the denouement.

THE FROZEN GHOST (1945) stars Chaney as a radio mentalist who suffers a crisis of conscience when a hypnotic subject dies on stage during his show. He makes the odd decision to leave his fiance/assistant (Evelyn Ankers) and stay as a guest at Madame Monet's Wax Museum, where Madame Monet (Tala Birell) shows interest in him, as does her cute teenage niece (Elena Verdugo)! A creepy ex-plastic surgeon (Martin Kosleck) who makes wax figures of notorious historical figures like Lady Macbeth and Attila the Hun is also on hand. There's a HOUSE OF WAX vibe that could have been developed with greater care and imagination, but the plot turns ludicrous in the final third and the suspense simply dissipates.

STRANGE CONFESSION (1945) stars Chaney as a chemist who works for a pharmaceutical drug company and has to suffer in silence as his corrupt boss (a particularly oily J. Carrol Naish) takes all the credit, glory and profit for Chaney's wonder drugs. Naish's dirty dealings include sending Chaney on a long trip to South America in search of botanical specimens for a new formula to fight influenza and then wining and dining Chaney's patient, beautiful wife (Brenda Joyce) while he's gone. It all builds up to a gruesome revenge that must have tested the censors' limits back then. As I watched it, I realized that this kind of story served as the template for nearly every revenge tale created in the EC Comics of the early 1950s (e.g., ""Tales from the Crypt"" and ""Vault of Horror"").

PILLOW OF DEATH (1945) is the oddest film in the set, starring Chaney as a lawyer in an unhappy marriage who's in love with his secretary (Brenda Joyce, again) and is a suspect when his wife is found murdered. For some reason, the secretary's set of peculiar relatives living in an old haunted mansion(!) figure in the action along with a charlatan spiritualist named Julian Julian (J. Edward Bromberg). It gets a bit silly at times, but if you watch all six films in order, this one offers a surprise ending that completely breaks with the pattern set by the previous five. It's worth watching just for that.

I would argue that WEIRD WOMAN and STRANGE CONFESSION are the best of the six.",1320019200,3,5576,4.802083333333333

2592957,5,B000FWHW90,"The Inner Sanctum Mysteries Complete Movie Collection is six hours and eighteen minutes long and was released in the stores on September 19, 2006. The Inner Sanctum movies were based on Inner Sanctum Mysteries radio show that ran from January 7, 1941 to October 5, 1952. All six movies are in the murder mystery genre and the only horror or monster is in the movie titles. All of the movies star Lon Chaney, Jr. as the lead actor. In the first four movies you hear him talking to himself and in the first four movies he plays the good guy; which is something of a rarity during his horror film days. It is the last movie which keeps you guessing at the end whether or not he is the murderer since he was driving insane. The only downside to this collecting is how it was put together. The only two choices you have in all six movies are Play and Languages. There is no Scene Selection, Coming Attractions, Bonus Feature, Trailer or Commentary. I would have loved it if there was some special bonus feature as to why the movies were made, why only six and why did they stop making the movies. Granted I am a Lon Chaney, Jr. fan, but why only he got to play the leading role. At least four different actors\actresses play in two of the six movies (see below). The Inner Sanctum Mysteries Complete Movie Collection gets an AAAA++++.

Evelyn Ankers: Weird Woman & The Frozen Ghost
Brenda Joyce: Strange Confession & Pillow of Death
J. Carrol Naish: Calling Dr. Death & Strange Confession
Milburn Stone: Weird Woman, The Frozen Ghost, & Strange Confession

DISC 1
3 Hours and 9 minutes

Calling Dr. Death is one hour and three minutes and was released in theaters on December 17, 1943. The basic story line is that Dr. Mark Steele (Lon Chaney, Jr.) loses his memory during one weekend and wakes up in his office with the news of that his wife, who has been cheating on him, has been murdered. During the rest of the film he his trying to remember that weekend and find out who murdered his wife.

Weird Woman is one hour and three minutes and was released in theaters on March 1, 1944. If you ever heard of the saying: that hells know no fury then a woman scorn; then that is the movie for you in a nutshell. Professor Norman Reed (Lon Chaney, Jr.) has come back from the South Sees with his just married wife Paula Clayton Reed (Anne Gwynne). His one time fling girlfriend Ilona Carr (Evelyn Ankers) wants revenge and will do anything to break up the marriage. This was the second installment in the Inner Sanctum series and the only one that I had a tough time trying to enjoy the movie.

Dead Man's Eyes is one hour and three minutes and was released in theaters on November 10, 1944. Artist Dave Stuart (Lon Chaney, Jr.) accidently blinds himself and his future father-in-law donates his own eyes upon his death. Dr. Stanley 'Dad' Hayden is murdered and the prime suspect is Dave Stuart. During the rest of the movie the search is on for the real killer.

DISC 2
3 Hours and 9 minutes

The Frozen Ghost is one hour and one minute and was released in theaters on June 1, 1945. Alex Gregor aka Gregor the Great (Lon Chaney, Jr.) hypnotizes a drunken person and during the trance accidently kills him. It is found out that the guy was an alcoholic and had a bad heart. Alex Gregor goes into a state of depression because he feels responsible for his death. Alex goes to live with Madame Valerie Monet to get over his depression. Alex and Valerie get into an argument and she passes out and Alex leaves the building. When he returns Valerie has gone missing and he is the prime suspect. During the rest of the movie is trying to find out what happen to Valerie and Alex try to clear his name.

Strange Confession is one hour and two minutes and was released in theaters on October 5, 1945. The main story is that Roger Graham (J. Carrol Naish) puts out on the market Jeff Carter (Lon Chaney, Jr.) unfinished formula for influenza and it winds up killing Jeff Carter's son. Of all six Inner Sanctum Mysteries movie, this is the only one you feel sorry for the character Lon Chaney, Jr. plays. Also look for a young Lloyd Bridges playing Jeff's friend and assistant Dave.

Pillow of Death is one hour and six minutes and was released in theaters on December 14, 1945. Attorney Wayne Fletcher (Lon Chaney, Jr.) comes home from work to find the police at his house. They have told him that his wife has been murdered and that he is the prime suspect. During the film he hears the voices of his death wife trying to convince him that he is the murderer. At the end he is driving insane and kills himself.

I bought the darn thing NEW. Disc Two is SO defective, you would not believe it!

Apparently, that modern UNIVERSAL thing that plays before each film starts is the same chapter linked to all three pictures. When I make a selection, five seconds of that brassy theme plays and then everything freezes. Both of my DVD players go into failure mode.

So, I learned to bypass it by hitting the CHAPTER button the split second that thing starts up. This skips me to the movie and everything seems OK, SEEMS being the operative word.

With THE FROZEN GHOST, there's another failure at about five minutes. So again, I was able to avoid this with the CHAPTER forward, losing about 7 minutes of movie. Miraculously, the disc plays without problem from there.

The second one's a real bummer. (That's STRANGE CONFESSION.) Skip the theme and into the film and everything is OK until THE LAST FOUR MINUTES when Lon Chaney's wife confronts the drug company owner in his home. That's as far as I can watch. Talk about a total tease!

Movie #3 (PILLOW OF DEATH) is somewhat more merciful. The failure happens just before the seance begins. That's at 34 minutes.

His fine turns as the cursed lycanthrope, Larry Talbot, in The Wolf Man, Frankenstein monster in Ghost of Frankenstein, vampire in Son of Dracula and the mummy Kharis, have terrified generations of thrill-seekers.

The Inner Sanctum mysteries show Chaney in a different light---leading (and lightly romantic) leading man. Chaney acquits himself well, with polished performances. There's plenty of solid help, too, from the likes of Evelyn Ankers, Milburn Stone, Martin Kosleck, Elana Verdugo and the great J. Carrol Naish. The Inner Sanctum pictures sometimes get a bad rap from classic monster fans, but their ire is misguided; the films are NOT monster movies, they're melodramas, with a few weird and creepy elements added to the mix.

Lon Chaney Jr who stars in all 6 of the series was a very underrated actor in his day. He seemed to live in the shadow of his famous father not to mention the burden of having the same name. His alcoholism might be attributed to this. Despite all of this I think he carved his own niche in films, first with his brillant portrayal of Lennie in Of Mice and Men and playing the role he would remain famous for, Larry Talbot in The Wolfman. The Innersanctum series are great little thrillers to watch on a stormy night or any night. They are well acted and speed along quite quickly. Evelyn Ankers, his frequent leading lady, is quite good playing against type in Weird Woman. No one made horror flicks as good as Universal and this series shows off some of its best.

According to the superb INNER SANCTUM MYSTERIES: BEHIND THE CREAKING DOOR by Martin Grams (also available on Amazon.com), Universal created a series of six low budget pictures with Lon Chaney Jr. in the lead. Evelyn Ankers was pregnant in one movie, so the film in which she stands behind a sofa and other concealments was done on purpose. The studio would have let her go if the heads had known. Contrary to popular belief, Lon Chaney Jr. did appear as a guest on the radio program (once) but that was a year and a half before Universal began filming so his appearance was NOT for publicity purposes.

STRANGE CONFESSION was a remake of THE MAN WHO RECLAIMED HIS HEAD and the studio faced a lawsuit in the 1940s, preventing that film to be shown on late-night tube TV in the 1950s for such programs as Shock Theatre. The reason you see a head in the globe and not a creaking door was because the studio optioned to buy the screen rights from Himan Brown, the creator/producer/director of the radio program and when he wouldn't sell it to them without a huge ransom, they discovered that he did not even own the name. Brown made an agreement with Simon & Schuster for the use of the Inner Sanctum name, on condition that at the end of each month, the latest paperback novel using the Inner Sanctum name would be mentioned. The publishing company profited through this arrangement. So the studio got permission from S&S to use the Inner Sanctum name and instructed very specific in the press books to theater owners not to make any mention of the radio program to avoid lawsuits. Brown owned the rights to the creaking door and nothing else. Hence the reason why no creaking door in the beginning of each movie, and the on-screen credit to S&S.",1222300800,4,1812,4.592592592592593
2592968,5,B000FWHW90,"I was pleasantly surprised by this series. Very entertaining.
I find ""Strange Confession"" the most realistic and plausible: Chemist invents drug, wants to perfect it yet the boss who takes all the credit wants to prematurely release the drug and this leads to tragic consequences. I can see that happening nowadays...
On the screen, there is a lot of introspection and self-analysis on Lon Chaney Jr.'s Part. Helps the viewer calm down and analyze the facts.
Now the reason for my title: What I found hilarious is how all 6 movies have plots that at least partly develop due to the attraction of some to either Lon Chaney or to his significant other... some being ready to kill because of that attraction...",1200268800,2,707,4.80327868852459
2592969,5,B000FWHW90,"On Sunday afternoons when I was growing up, our local station used to have a program called ""Horror Theater"".  I remember every one of these movies popping up once in a while.  The one that stood out for me back then was ""Weird Woman"".  When VHS released this set a few years ago I nabbed it immediately.  Imagine my elation when I saw this for sale on DVD!  I didn't even know they were releasing them.  This films are moody, funny and sometimes even a little creepy with top-notch production values the only way Universal could do them.  Sure they're B films, each only over an hour in length but they move along at such a brisk pace that they are fun to watch!  I'll pull these out on a late Sunday afternoon (right before dark of course)and have a ball.  Highly entertaining and worth getting.  They are all good but I'll rank them in order of my preference:
1.  Weird Woman  2.  Pillow of Death  3.  Dead Man's Eyes 4.  The Frozen Ghost 5) Dead Man's Eyes and 6) Strange Confession.  Enjoy!!",1189728000,8,996,4.355191256830601

2592971,3,B000FWHW90,"In the days before television really took over, the rough equivalent of TV series were put out by movie studios.  Churned out quickly by ""B"" movie units, these movies tended to be produced every few months and short (like TV shows, they would all run around the same length).  For example, Universal put out a whole series of Sherlock Holmes and Abbott and Costello movies.  Another example from Universal Pictures was the Inner Sanctum Mysteries, a series of six mystery movies all starring Lon Chaney, Jr.  The Inner Sanctum of the title was the mind, which as the Spirit of the Inner Sanctum would warn us at the beginning of every movie (but the last one) was capable of plotting murder.

The earlier Inner Sanctum movies would provide voice-over ""thoughts"" from Chaney to demonstrate his inner turmoil, a gimmick which diminishes as the series goes on.  In general, the movies also are plotted similarly, with Chaney accused of a murder and his attempts to vindicate himself.  Even this storyline would eventually get a little more variety in the final movies.

The first disc in this two disc set features three movies:  Calling Dr. Death, Weird Woman and Dead Man's Eyes.  In Calling Dr. Death, Chaney is a neurologist accuses of killing his wife while having an affair with his nurse.  It also features Patricia Morison, most notable in Dressed to Kill as the villainess who matches wits with Sherlock Holmes in the final Rathbone movie. (Since these movies all featured contract players, actors repeatedly show up in all sorts of Universal movies).

Weird Woman has Chaney as an anthropologist who marries a woman who believes in witchcraft.  When he destroys her magic charms, bad things begin to happen.  This movie also stars Evelyn Ankers, a frequent Chaney costar (including The Wolf Man and Son of Dracula).  In Dead Man's Eyes, Chaney is an artist accidentally blinded; a corneal transplant provides a possible chance at sight, but he is accused of killing the donor.

Frozen Ghost (the first of three movies on the second disc) has Chaney as a hypnotist who believes he can kill with his gaze.  Much of this movie takes place in a wax museum, where death and intrigue occur, and once again, Evelyn Ankers costars.  The last two movies have Brenda Joyce as the female lead.  Strange Confession has Chaney as a chemist developing an influenza cure, only to be derailed by his duplicitous boss.  And while Pillow of Death may have the weakest title in the bunch, it offers a bit of a different plot, with Chaney - as in Calling Dr. Death - accused of murdering his wife to be with his assistant.  This is also the longest of the movies, at 67 minutes.

Unlike the two actors Chaney is often associated with, Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, Chaney comes off as relatively normal, which is why he is often given normal romances; relationships featuring Karloff or Lugosi tend to be either sexless or warped.  As an actor, however, Chaney is just average and these movies are only passable.  There are more than a few cliches in the writing and even at just an hour, the films can sometimes drag.  They're not awful movies and at least they look reasonably good.  On the other hand, with no extras, I can only give the set a low three stars.  If you are a fan of these old movies, there will be some value to getting this set, but there are also a lot better movies available; this set should only be for either novelty value or for completists.",1179014400,22,3455,4.696013289036545

These are 6 VERY low budget movies all starring Lon Chaney Jr.  They're quick (most run only about an hour) move quickly and have some neat twists.

Worth getting especially for Universal horror fans.",1175644800,4,374,4.828125
2592974,4,B000FWHW90,"Little is Better.  This B movie collection is the perfect medicine for staying up a little late to watch a weird little story, but not wanting to short change a reasonable night's sleep or stress out on a heavy duty of serious.

These little gems are just what was intended... escape.  You can imagine the squeaking door if you need, but

for the most part it's sheer pleasure watching some of the best character actors ever in Universal's  B movie business.

Lon Chaney, Jr. has the lead in all five features so I recommend the viewers put a special focus on the Hall of Fame performers that give superb support.  The mixed bag of men:  Milburn Stone, Thomas Gomez, J. Carrol Naish, Paul Kelly, David Bruce, Ralph Morgan, Douglas Dumbrille, J. Edward Bromberg and that creepy little guy who snakes rather than sneaks, Martin Kosleck, are genuine characters.  The gals, Brenda Joyce, Jean Parker, Patricia Morison, Anne Gwynn, Ramsey Ames, and ultimate screamer, Evelyn Ankers, are all accomplished actresses with better than good looks who deserved but never got the star treatment.

I'd give the nod to Weird Woman as the best movie of the lot, but each has its own merits and memorable moments.  It's a wonderful little package for the true classic B film fan.",1171497600,18,1263,4.774193548387097
2592975,4,B000FWHW90,"I am a huge fan of the late Lon Chaney Jr! These films were done not long after his greatest role as The Wolfman. And although some of the 6 stories on this set are not well written, and some of the actors are not equal with Lon, there are some golden moments here for a fan of Mr. Chaney, and it is important that these films are now available. My only complaint would be a lack of any additional material, but perhaps there is little left to add. If you are a fan of Lon, you NEED to see these films. They may not be as important as his roles in The Wolfman, High Noon, or Of Mice and Men, but they are essential to see as part of his work in the 1940's.",1168473600,5,656,3.8666666666666667

8127496,4,B000FWHW90,"It's unfortunate some negative reviews hurt this set. People with outdated DVD players shouldn't be reviewing newer, or compressed discs. The problem isn't with the disc, it's with their own equipment. I've watched every movie on both discs, more than once. Zero skips, zero flaws, zero problems.

Without these inaccurate reviews maybe the set wouldn't have been discontinued. I'm guilty of putting off purchasing it, because I believed the reviews. A big mistake. I had to pay double it's cheapest price, but only half of it's current. In any case, if you were considering it, I'd hurry, before it goes up further and you miss out forever. Just make sure your player isn't an antique. Though I'm not even sure that was the issue. Could be those players were cheap garbage. This is the last time I believe a negative review that could be attributed to use error.

The only negative I have to report is the number of discs. Universal is famous for using the least amount of discs possible. Makes no sense, since they're cheap enough. This set should have been 3 discs. That way the audio wouldn't have been as compressed as it was. It doesn't detract at all from the enjoyment, but it's really bad form, since it could have been better.

In any case, if you're a fan of these movies, or any of the Universal horror movies, I definitely recommend getting this set. You won't be disappointed.",1518307200,,1390,4.711934156378601
