7906200,5,B00000F0YN,"Albert (Zooey Hall) has some serious issues. He believes that all women are ""whores"". He also believes that his mother (Joanne Moore Jordan) is the cause of all his problems. In addition, Albert also suffers from severe WBHS (Warren Beatty Hair Syndrome). Dr. Burton (Frank Whiteman) is convinced that Albert is dangerously disturbed, and should be institutionalized. Unfortunately, Mum won't hear of it. Not surprisingly, Albert begins a killing spree while sporting an awesome Fedora and turtle-neck ensemble! He's working his way to his mother, one victim at a time. After exterminating one woman, he takes her young daughter out for the time of her life. All the while, the theme song, POOR ALBERT plays on- ""Poor Alberrrt! Poooorrrr Alllberrrrtttt!""... Yeah! Just wait 'til you hear Albert's theological discussion on the lake, while flashbacks of his last homicide cut in from time to time! Or his history lesson on their way to a hotel bridal suite! Amazing cinema! I DISMEMBER MAMA is a thoroughly absurd experiment in early 70s misogyny. It wavers and wobbles between being a true tale of sadistic terror, and a goofy parody of itself. The misplaced musical score is a marvel! Albert is at once a repellent, murdering pig, and a boneheaded buffoon. One has simply not lived until witnessing his jumping bullfighter dance routine! Brilliance, beyond this miracle, does not exist. We may stop caring about anything happening before our eyes, but we cannot tear them away! The yelling cop (Greg Mullavey) is particularly memorable. No human soul could possibly prepare itself for the non-finale of crying, screaming, tantrum-induced anti-doom, in which no actual mannequins were harmed! Nope, they just don't make'em like this anymore...",1426896000,,1743,5.228571428571429

7906202,1,B00000F0YN,"'I Dismember Mama' (also known as 'Poor Albert And Little Annie') deserves a better release than what Substance Home Video delivers...a bare-bones, full screen version of the film, with nothing more than a wimpy photo gallery.  If you own a copy of the original VHS tape, save your money!

Back in the seventies, this was one of the ""grindhouse"" classics that screened a double-bill with 'The Blood-Spattered Bride'!  Where's the original theatrical trailer?  I would have enjoyed watching a retrospective featurette on the making of this cult classic with interviews by actor Zooey Hall and actress Geri Reischl!  Hopefully, a reputable DVD company like Subversive Cinema (who released the cult classic 'The Candy Snatchers' in a beautiful digitally-remastered package) or Code Red DVD (who did a wonderful job of releasing 'Girls In Chains') will give 'Poor Albert And Little Annie' the respect they rightfully deserve.",1242000000,8,921,5.324137931034483
7906203,3,B00000F0YN,"I don't know what film the other guy saw, but the movie I watched was made sometime in the early 70s or late 60s, and it's about this crazy dude who thinks all women are sluts. This stems from the unorthodox way he was raised by his mother. He escapes from this mental institution after attacking, and nearly sexually assaulting a nurse. Then goes home, rapes/murders the maid, kidnaps her daughter, and then goes to murder his mother as well. Not a bad movie to watch if you can get past the cheesy disco music and hokey slow motion effects in the final scenes.

I think the title is misleading, because there are no dismemberments or decapitations in it that I can recall. It isn't even technically a horror film. It's more like a drama/suspense thriller.",1095811200,2,757,4.5661764705882355
7906204,5,B00000F0YN,"Can't beat Casablanca in a legitimate contest.  However, if you are looking for a classic B-Rate horror film, then this is your type of film.  It's basically just a bunch of generic bad guys that dismember their mama! Pretty much the title says it all!",1078444800,,252,4.5777777777777775
