8677866,5,B00NG6W1DY,"4 1/2 STARS FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY, THOUGH NOT PERFECT, BORGIA SERIES -- & WHY YOU SHOULD GIVE IT A CHANCE -- FINAL SEASON 3 RELEASED IN EUROPE 29 OCT 2014
SEASON TWO SYNOPSIS NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THIS REVIEW ***I will not give anything away for those who have yet to watch the series***

IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE STORY OF THE BORGIA: It is considered one of the most infamous chapters in the history of Italy and the Papal States. It is the time of Machiavelli, Michelangelo, Medici and Da Vinci. It is the enlightenment of the renaissance, yet great depravity and lawlessness. This series picks up with Spanish Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia as he vies to become the eventual Pope Alexander the Sixth and elevate his family into a dynasty that will influence the whole world. Political intrigue, dark family secrets, and great ambitions of state - all form a natural structure for this partially fictionalized tale.

STUDIOCANAL vs SHOWTIME: This Borgia version from StudioCanal was perhaps lost in the US for two reasons. #1 is that the outstanding Showtime version beat them to the punch. #2 is that the performance of lead actor John Doman is a little uneven (I am being kind) and some have applied that performance unfairly to the rest of the production. To be certain, the Showtime Borgias is superior in production values, budget, glam, and star power. Adding a-z, Showtime's Borgias is the better show and many will argue that point while hating this show. However, there are many points to this show that actually excel individually beyond the Showtime production and make it legitimately many other people's favorite version (""favorite"" being a more subjective term). This show is slightly more authentic than ""Borgias"" in that it follows the Borgia history a little more accurately (though still changed at times). The cast is more European and manage something closer to Italian and Catalan accents when they are not actual Italians or Spaniards to begin with. Some filming is done in the Czech Republic, but much is also done in Italy. The palaces are every bit as extraordinary and lavish; the settings gorgeous and epic; the filming and cinematography exceptional; and the supporting cast absolutely fantastic and equal to any other Borgia productions. The acting outside of Doman really is outstanding if you just give it a chance.

SEASON TWO: Many of the darkest rumors about the Borgia family are realized in this season (whether they are true or not). This series certainly is less afraid to tread deep within the more salacious speculations about the Borgia family. It is equally brutal, sexual, and graphic as the Showtime version, if not more so. Cesare and his father Pope Alexander further their boundless ambition to see Cesare not only a king, but an Emperor. They desire to set him as the eventual ruler of a unified Italy, but there is a long road of conquest and political alliance required for that seemingly impossible fantasy. The siblings Cesare and Lucrezia take a more central role in season two as they come into their own. Lucrezia is particularly interesting as she finds the source of her own power and displays talents and responsibility in her own style. Cesare is sent to deal with the extremist monk Savonarola who has opposed the pope and transformed intellectual and artistic Florence into an ultra-religious state where ""Bonfires of the Vanities"" destroy anything that opposes his view of God's will. In a little role reversal, La Belle Giulia Farnese will need the help of her cardinal brother to maintain her relationship as mistress of the pope.

SEASON THREE FOLLOWS! As I mentioned above, there is a third and final season released on video in Europe 29, Oct 2014. Now that the show is known in the US, hopefully it will be available a lot quicker than this season was. I don't plan on waiting for the US release anyway. Don't let one mediocre performance dissuade you from this very excellent production. It was different enough for me to watch both the Borgia and Showtime's Borgias in close succession and I loved them both! You may find more charm and authenticity in this series. I highly recommend it (for mature audiences only).",1413590400,,4174,4.874647887323944
