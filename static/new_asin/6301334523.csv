325740,5,6301334523,"Vicomte de Valmont (John Malkovich) appears to be the ultimate libertarian in an aristocratic society that would not even tolerate thinking about sex.
Seducing is a game, a way of life, for him and Marquise de Merteuil  (Glenn Close). Their complicity is the background of a diabolic plan  involving seduction of young Cecile de Volanges (Uma Thurman).
While some  people will be stopped by the scandalous and sulfurous aspects of such a  film, others will appreciate the magnificent French style of the XVIIIth  and the fine play of the actors. Really gorgeous!",917654400,4,562,5.065217391304348
325741,5,6301334523,"One of the all time best movies I have seen as far as being able to draw the veiwer into it's world.  The acting by John Malkovitch and Glenn Close and their constant duel is breathtaking and intense.  The emotions of  Michelle Pfeiffer and Uma Thurman are profound and stirring.  And the skill  these actors use, expressing their characters through eyes and voice and  stunning facial expression, is some of the finest I have ever seen.  The  costume design is among the likes of Amadeus and Henry V (Branagh)...it  enfolds the viewer in a profound sense of the time and culture the  characters live in.  It is a sweet feeling of another time and place and  the great game that is played there is one of depth, intrigue, passion,and  the taboo.  Set in the heydey of Parisian Aristocracy, two nobles share an  intense passion of loveplay and manipulation.  They are the greatest of  this game, and their personal desires to beat the other fuel a private  battle like no other.  Supporting their consuming pranks are an innocent  wife of a religious leader, a young debutante fresh out of a convent  preparing to marry, and a brash young music teacher intent on forcing his  way out of the class system.  The way each of these people's own internal  passion struggles intertwines with the other is dizzying and so intense  it's tragic.  The surprises that seem to come from every corner in this  film give it a life and depth that instantly creates legend.  Top of the  line film with great cinemetography, score, editing, and historical  accuracy.",914544000,4,1548,4.7320754716981135

Well, hoping makes foos of us all because the penny-pinching scum who manage the WA releases decided that that release was just fine to throw out on the Archive brand because it's the SAME EXACT ARTFACT-RIDDEN RELEASE WITH THE FUZZY, DIRT-SPECKED PRINT that was on the 2004 release. Even the same piss-poor extras are carried over (but I guess considering how stingy the Archive titles are with extras, that's actually sort-of a bonus).

325775,5,6301334523,"Spoiler alert!  There are good reasons why this is a restricted (rated R) film, and as a Christian, I must say that there are things one might wish to fast-forward past while watching.  However, despite the inevitable sexual immorality of this story, it still qualifies in my mind as a great morality tale about what becomes of the following situations: (1) a situation in which certain aristocrats, endowed with many material blessings, spend more time playing games of social intrigue and manipulation instead of helping those who are less fortunate; (2) the bitterness and anger that ensues when a woman such as the Marquise de Merteuil, played marvellously by Glenn Close, is trapped in a life of emotional and intellectual oppression; (3) the problems caused by arranged marriages in this particular social setting and time period; (4) when a man, the Vicomte de Valmont, rejects his strong Catholic upbringing and chooses to become a libertine; also the burning question of  whether or not he is capable of finding redemption; (5) how the actions of wicked people affect the innocent around them, especially the
extent to which the innocent choose to accept or reject the deceptions they encounter.  The fourth situation is very well explored in this film, although, in the highest irony, Valmont's step towards redemption occurs in the midst of one of his typical affairs.  Whether he is merely sorry for the hurt he caused, or truly repentant, remains a question at the end of the film.

  While the Marquise finally reaps what she has sown, I agree with another reviewer who viewed her with compassion because she was a
product of the oppression of her time.  Actually, I think that she is a product of her response to her time, not of the time itself.  Everything
that happens to her is ultimately brought about by her rage at the disappointments in her own life.

  I found myself most disturbed by what Valmont and the Marquise did to C&eacute;cile de Volanges, the young d&eacute;butante and social newbie in
the film, played wonderfully by Uma Thurman.  It is interesting to compare this film with another version of this same story, the 1989 film
""Valmont"" with Faruza Balk as C&eacute;cile and the inestimable Colin Firth as Valmont.  In the film ""Valmont,"" C&eacute;cile has a little more strength of character, and she learns more from what happens to her.  It's worth noting that in the original short story, ""Les Liaisons Dangereuses,""
 C&eacute;cile is traumatised for life by the events that befall her, and seeks refuge in her faith. She returns to the convent where she was schooled and becomes a nun.  It's also worth noting that C&eacute;cile's surname, Volanges, literally means ""flight of the angels"" in French.

  All of the principals in the film do a splendid job, especially Michelle Pfeiffer as the much misled and wronged Madame de Tourvel who, while a victim of Valmont, also bears responsibility for her own choices.  Again, it is interesting to compare Pfeiffer's performance to the performance of Meg Tilly in the same role in the film ""Valmont.""

  Many people criticise Keanu Reeves for a wooden performance, but one has to consider that this was still relatively early in his career as an actor.  Also, his character lends itself to being wooden: he is the virtuous, brave and ingenuous lover, an average Joe among aristocrats with the old-fashioned, Dartagnan-like sense of honour.  He had to be played with a certain amount of boyish innocence and naivet&eacute;, and I think that Reeves delivers this well enough, and he manages to do it without being insufferably maudlin.  An actor could easily overdo the innocence in this part to the point of making the audience sick to their stomachs.  Reeves doesn't do that.

  The art direction, costumes and score of this film are excellent, especially the musical score.

  There is one more thing I might mention.  It is a temptation to view this sort of film as a commentary on typical French aristocratic behaviour before the French Revolution.  I advise all who read the book or see this film (or the film ""Valmont,"" for that matter), to remember
that the original short story was a piece of propaganda against the ancien r&eacute;gime, written seven years before the Revolution.  There were just as many French aristocrats who truly cared about the peasants working their estates, and who used their resources to help the poor.  Granted, the aristocrats who gathered at Versailles and in Paris could be very out of touch with the working man's condition.  But there were also just as many who were not out of touch at all.  Many of them were too busy keeping their estates going to get involved in the sorts of intrigues depicted in this story. Also, libertines such as the Vicomte de Valmont have been found in all classes of society since the
beginning of time.  I encountered men like him in college!  Also, angry, bitter women like the Marquise de Merteuil can also be found in all
classes of society.  A lack of choice in one's marital life and restrictions on one's intellect and behaviour can make anyone angry and bitter.  So, I caution anyone who wants to view this as a true portrayal of aristocrats and upper class people.

  I recommend this film, but watch it when you've had some life experience.  The R rating is correct: it's not for teens.  Also, watch it with moral and historical discernment.",1493683200,3,5404,4.891089108910891

Because of this I could not rate this movie as a classic. Just as the jerk director ruined 'Sex in the City' catering to that jerk ""actress"" Sarah Jessica Parker, in her refusal to do nude scenes; alienating her actual Star (superior) co-Stars. Amovie is a representation of an event or concept, misrepresenting it for the sake of a monstrously egotistical or self conscious actor or actress is a Crime of the representation. Unfortunately now altered from possibly near perfect beauty concepts, Angelina Jolie (before also being corrupted by delusions of entitled privilege to hide her body when the movie or scene naturally required it) was a true actress for a long time. Why do actresses often forget what made them attractions. Actors often focus on there physical attributes when that made them famous; your Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, etc.; continued to use their bodies to make their careers; where too many and often actresses are fooled into ignoring half or more of their acting value, forgetting Imagery is Acting.",1465603200,,1246,5.112745098039215

Still, for what the story lacks in likability, DANGEROUS LIAISONS makes up in spades with class. Although the satire is still there, I much preferred the biting wit and dialogue in this version. Glenn Close has rarely been better and gets most of the choice lines/moments, but most of the rest of the cast doesn't slouch either. John Malkovich was one of the issues I had with the film. He has played a lot of devious characters before and since, but I didn't care for the way he underplayed his character's malicious intent. To be honest, his performance could have used a little more ""spice."" Still, he did a passable job. The only member of the cast I didn't like at all, although he has a small role, was Keanu Reeves as an effete music teacher and paramour of Uma Thurman. His line readings were awful and showed that he really isn't up to the task (at least not at this point in his career) of performances requiring some degree of dramatic heft. Aside from the sexual politics which, although betraying the period it was written in, were still well-played and explicated, my favorite aspects of the film were the production design and score. For a period piece, this ranks very high in terms of quality and attention to detail. I also liked the harpsichord-heavy score which accentuated the stylization and formality of the time (among aristocrats). The score also had moments of darkness in appropriate scenes, particularly towards the end. Ultimately, I find the idea of the story, with bored aristocrats playing sexual games with each other, to be somewhat banal and passe (not to mention, sexist), but the way it is executed in DANGEROUS LIAISONS makes it a great deal more palatable.",1458604800,2,1919,4.818181818181818

325951,5,6301334523,"What a great movie.  This movie shows what happens when boredom sets in for the privileged in old world France.  How two diabolical people who are made for each get bored and decide to manipulate the lives of people who are in their circle of friends just for the fun of it.  But things as usual do not go as planned.  The count (John Malkovich) falls in live with his prey (Michelle Pfeiffer) unexpectedly and this infuriates his ally in crime (Glenn Close).  So she sets out to destroy him.  Her line of ""war"" is chilling.  But he outwits her in the end and she ends up exposed and humiliated.  Keanu Reeves and Una Thurman give great performances as young lovers whom John and Glenn involve in their wicked scheme just for the fun of it.  I can see why it was an Oscar-winner.  I would recommend this movie highly.  The script and dialogue are wonderful and the actors play it to the hilt.  Enjoy it over and over.  Great period movie with beautiful scenes and costumes.  12-2-2015

326054,5,6301334523,"Dangerous Liaisons has a very particular rhythm which moves like a mathematical calculation. Frears has chosen fantastic music to accompany the style and enhance this aspect of the film. Even the expressions from the actors which are often caught in their playful demeanour are carefully timed in the length of the shot and in the musical cue when needed. There is also a humour constant throughout the film which dramatically magnifies the sting at the end of the story. The script may fraternize with the amoral characters in their sadistic plotting and appalling behaviour but it has a lot to say about the values and weaknesses of all the characters, no matter with whom you sympathize. This is a very multi-layered story structure which is lost on most people because they lack experience and perception on the human condition. I for example only sympathize with Glenn Closes character, who is a modern woman trying to keep her power and individuality in a mans world. This unfair balance in her world is both supported by ignorant men and equally weak, ignorant women. The last scene of Glenn Close is played beautifully by this gifted actress and gets my compassionate vote. I have understood her cruelty throughout the movie and have forgiven her but society is hissing and the end seems near.

I find the style of the film so unique and on its own terms that there really is nothing I can think of to compare in cinema. Dangerous Liaisons is extremely enjoyable and very entertaining but the serious tone and comment underlining the film makes it also a rather masterful experience, which many audiences miss when viewing this masterpiece.",1431561600,3,1648,4.906810035842294

326078,5,6301334523,"I love this movie. It provides a good glimpse into the world/historical time period that the characters lived in and how limited the roles for women were. Their only power was there reputation. Glen Close did a wonderful job depicting how such a strict social environment can corrupt a woman. All of the actors were great. Intrigue, manipulation, malice, revenge and betrayal are all part of the plot. A great movie.

I have to add an update to this review. While I still love this movie, I can't stand movies that scenes have been deleted from. I am very disappointed in the companies that think their audiences have such a small attention span that they won't notice that scenes, however trivial they may seem to the plot, have been deleted. I just bought this movie from Amazon and now I will have to try to sell it and go in search sites that guarantee uncut movies. I have no interest in interviews with directors or actors. All I ask is that the work itself, is preserved in it's entirety, whether it is a work of art or simply entertainment.

Being one who believes that the very best films begin with a truly good morality tale (i.e., telling the truth about human nature and relationships), how much more delightful when THIS GREAT AND TIMELESS ONE was told via an unsurpassedly high level of production - its staging/costuming, scripting, filming and acting!  (No matter how many times I view this film, I'm particularly amazed at the brilliance of Malkovich's performance.) But I'm only repeating what others have said...

326247,5,6301334523,"Is it possible to manipulate the world without manipulating yourself in the process? Dangerous Liaisons is an 80s gem. Forgotten by many, remembered by fans of classical debauchery, Glenn Close, Michelle Pfeiffer, and the star of the show: John Malkovich. Dangerous Liaisons came out in 1988 and was directed by Stephen Frears. This film could pair well on a double feature bill with Wall Street. These films overflow with dishonesty, abuse of privilege, and are essentially allegories about the pitfalls of greed. Dangerous Liaisons is really historic artistic escapism. The story is set in France around 1760. The look, feel, costumes, and place designs all set you directly into the action.  John Malkovich plays the villain role of Vicomte de Valmont to perfection. He is basically a rich powerful man of privilege that uses his influence to manipulate women. Vicomte de Valmont insatiably starts an an affair with every woman within arms reach. Once his conquest quota has met capacity he falls desperately in love. He becomes a spider trapped in his own web and escape is futile.  Lust. Seduction. Revenge.  Take your pick. Dangerous Liaisons is the ultimate 18th century soapopera. This film was a success and remains a worthwhile venture down immorality lane.  Dangerous Liaisons was nominated for seven Academy Awards. It won awards for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Costume Design, and Best Art Direction. If there was an award category for decadence,  Dangerous Liaisons would have ""possessed"" the competition.",1361664000,,1521,5.268595041322314

326254,5,6301334523,"Two wealthy, idle aristrocrats plot to seduce and destroy innocent people for amusement and revenge in this brilliant 1988 movie. The production is sumptious. The acting is compelling, and the story is tight and moves with the speed of a snake strike. The wealthy degenerates are so charming in their dialogue and glamorous in their finery that the viewer at first almost sides with them in enjoying their mischief. However, creator Pierre Choderlos De Laclos was a moralist and critic of the immorality of his time.

France in the 18th Century was becoming more politically unstable because of the income desparity between the classes, and the insensitivity of the ruling royalty. The rich felt themselves superior to everyone else. The high born characters in De Laclo's tale are all upper class, but either ruthless and selfish or naive,innocent or hypocritical victims. Hence, the French Revolution in 1889, when Royalty literally lost it's head.

There are parallels to the go go 1980s when military spending was increased,the rich were favored in government as never before, while aid to the poor was decreased, homelessness increased and the income gap between the classes was widened as never before. No one actually said, ""Let them eat cake"" either in the 1700s (Marie Antoinette was framed) or in the 1980s, but the ruling policies certainly gave this attitude. One can almost picture Valmont or Merteuil stating the 47% remark that Mitt Romney so infamously espoused in that little youtube clip during the 2012 election campaign.

To watch Dangerous Liaisons in the 2010s is to experience what our current government debate is: favoring the highest 1 percent over the majority of lower income wage earners and those unable to find jobs, or disabled. In the film the 1% wins in that Valmont and Merteuil achieve their goal, but at a terrible price to their own society.

The story was filmed once before and several times after scriptwriter Christopher Hampton/ director Stephen Freers' version, but only the South Korean 2003 Untold Scandal by E-J Young rivals 1988's Dangerous Liaisons in style and substance.",1358985600,,2121,5.121387283236994

The movie going public still had Amadeus on their minds, one of the greatest period pieces ever made, and Dangerous Liaisons with its more scandalous storyline, beautiful costumes, sets and music was an instant hit. I don't think Malkovich has ever been better. Glenn Close is perfect. Young Uma Thurman and Keanu Reeves fit their roles of naive pawns  perfectly.

I adore this movie.  I have both copies and without question the blu-ray is an astonishing transfer over to blu-ray.  Everything is gorgeous.  The color, the brightness, the costumes, the skin tones, the scenery all pop with sharpness and beauty.  Some one stated that both the dvd and blu-ray look the same, that is absolutely not the truth.  I don't know what type of tv this person was watching it on but the dvd version and the blu-ray version look completely different.  I watch on a 1080P HDTV... and my opinion (and experience as I have owned 720P HDTV's also) is that there is no other way to watch a blu-ray movie but in 1080P.  Indeed worth every penny to step up to the blu-ray version.

I don't like telling the story of a movie in my review of it but I will say this... It is definitely a head-shaker to watch cruelty in action in this film but it is not far from the truth of how some human beings, in the real world and not just on film, can be and are.  BUT, truly what goes around comes around without question.

A classic.  I admit, I can only watch this film once in a while (due to the nature of Close and Malkovich's character's) but I love to watch it each time I do.",1347926400,17,1361,4.228682170542636

Plus there were plenty of locals like me who were also starving for good stories and good acting.  The movie in his theater was a hit!

326299,5,6301334523,"Glenn Close and John Malkovich are two sides of the same coin in this feature. They are superb at portraying predators: they are elegant, malicious, deceitful and manipulative. Their goals are sexual conquests and/or ruining reputations and marriages. Uma Thurman, on the other hand, portrays an innocent girl who becomes their catspaw. Not only the acting but the directing, the cinematography and the screenplay are all perfection.

The plot is as follows: Close asks Malkovich to seduce Thurman prior to her marriage to Close's ex-lover, who insists on marrying a virgin. Malkovich declines as it being too easy and, besides, his sights are on Michelle Pfeiffer, who is famous for being a virtuous, married woman. Thurman's mother, however, warns Pfeiffer not to believe a word that comes out of silver tongued Malkovich, that he is really a scumbag. Malkovich redoubles his efforts, but as revenge will also go ahead and seduce Thurman. Unintentionally, however, Malkovich begins to fall in love with Pfeiffer and he relates his feelings to Close (he is even beginning to develop a conscience!), totally oblivious to the fact that she is now becoming jealous and angry. So now, Close begins to manipulate and scheme against her former ally. I will not say any more in order not to spoil the movie.",1315008000,,1301,5.051162790697674
326300,4,6301334523,"I Have seen both movie adoptions Valmont and Dangerous Liaisons as well as read the novel which the story is based on. This movie holds *more* faithful to the novel than Valmont which is done in a *lighter* mood in comparison. For Example; ""The Overall Ending, Cecile's hair color (Blonde), Madam de Tourval's eventual fate as well as some others"" Trivial things but yet of some importance.

Overall, this was an Excellent period film with lavish customs and a Higher budget than Valmont and with bigger Screen Names who despite being Miscast in those roles in terms of Physical appearances did a marvelous job in delivering their role believably and convincingly enough to render an Oscar Nomination and hunt the audience.

John Malkovich does a Splendid job portraying the heartless rake in this movie however I believe he is the Most mis-cast character in the entire film. Valmont from the novel is undoubtedly a notorious womanizer without a soul but he had a charming side to him which is very effective in attracting all his victims (ladies) that I think is somehow lacking in this movie. Malkovich is good enough looking but the role needed a more [handsome] actor to play the great Parisian womanizer. Which in this case I'm obliged to say that Colin Firth is a better choice in regard to appearances and more believable as Valmont.

Uma Thurman is another mis-cast this film has made. The Cecile from the novel is a naive, 15 year Old who has been living all her life at a convent and doesn't know much about the world. Uma Thurman just like Malkovich does a very convincing job with what she had but again I'm forced to say that the Cecile [Fairuza Balk] from Valmont was a more believable portrayal of the actual Cecile.

I'm Not sure about Glenn Close's character the MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL, Glenn Close is undeniably good in acting her role but I found myself not believing her as the enchanting seductress the novel had us believe. I also found myself not believing Annette Bening in this role either. Glenn Close although more mature was a bit older for this role and Annette Bening was a bit too soft.

 Madame de Tourvel played by Michelle Pfeiffer was the most convincing and believable portrayal of what the actual Madame de Tourvel would've been. I liked her a lot in this role.

I recommend you watch both Versions Valmont and Dangerous Liaisons and possibly even read the book if you have the time. Rent both films, borrow the book from the library. Then You Can make your own comparison and preferences and can always if you wanted buy the movie you liked most thus run the risk of spending your money on something you might or might not like.",1315008000,4,2664,4.67948717948718
326301,5,6301334523,"This highly-acclaimed Oscar winning film is set in pre-revolutionary France with its costumes, manners, and mind-set of the time, especially the way the French thought about male and female sexuality. A man, they felt, is an aggressor and predator, unable to settle down with a single woman. He enjoys having sex, especially if he can seduce a reluctant woman into submitting to him. Women, they were convinced, are passive, easily seduced, unable to enjoy having sex but enjoying giving it.

 A man and a woman, mischievously played by John Malkovich and Glenn Close, enjoy sex with each other but want to enjoy seeing two women seduced. There is a sexual feeling in this, but also a feeling of control and taking revenge. Both women are beautiful. One is a young virgin who is engaged to a count. Wouldn't it be fun to see the face of the count when he discovers that his virgin is not so! Also, think about the revenge we will inflict upon her mother! The other is a more mature wife of a currently absent husband, a very religious woman. Wouldn't it be fun to seduce a religious woman away from her husband and her religion, all that she holds dear!

 Many viewers will enjoy seeing the somewhat unusual way that the conniving pair go about the seductions. There is lots of humor in their acts and in the reactions of the two seduces. However, it must be recalled that the events could not happen in today's culture as they do in the film.",1311897600,,1443,4.5813953488372094

Yet the movie is an absolute classic that cannot be recommended highly enough to anybody who still cares for great acting and deep meaning on the screen.

The reasons for the undisputed, if a bit neglected, classical status of this movie are chiefly two: 1) the screenplay is much more than mere sexual intrigues; and 2) the cast is downright outstanding, especially the leading parts.

To begin with, the screenplay in the beginning is far from promising, busying itself - and yourself too - with petty games of people who have much too much time on their hands. Yet somewhere in the middle you start having some kind of foreboding. It is well justified. For the movie develops from an innocent social comedy into a dark drama of frightening intensity. This is no period piece, that's for sure. The main theme of the movie is the complex relationship between lust and love, a conundrum as relevant today as it ever was - or ever will be. For all their cunning duplicity and social hypocrisy, both Vicomte de Valmont and Marquise de Merteuil, deep inside themselves, long for the same thing as more or less anybody, then and now: love, affection, companionship. Both the Vicomte and the Marquise have far too intelligent and sophisticated minds as not to realize that passion and lust neither last nor bring lasting satisfaction.

Even though the supporting cast includes fine performances by Michelle Pfeiffer, Uma Turman, Keanu Reeves and Swoosie Kurtz, all these worthies are completely overshadowed by Glenn Close and John Malkovich in the parts of the Marquiese and the Vicomte, respectively. Neither of them may at first strike you as the right choice for a great seducer, of either sex, but both of them (considerably helped by the great script and genius for acting) make terrific roles and remind me that the secret of seduction is in the provocative behaviour, not in the gorgeous looks. The scenes between them are unforgettable, full of double entendres and refreshing frankness delivered with the most deliciously elaborate eighteenth-century vocabulary. No less suave are the innuendos they devise and carry out with the destinies of the other characters. Yet one is never in any doubt that behind the glittering faade there are ruthless calculation and genuine malice quite devoid of any scruples whatsoever. Significantly, both have ''solo scenes'' in the very end of the movie - the duel (with a great dying speech by John Malkovich) and the public ostracizing (deeply affecting performance by Glenn Close without a single word) - and these are among the most affecting moments in the whole movie.

For my part, I did not in the least find the main characters too cold or impossible to sympathize with, as other reviewers apparently did. Quite to the contrary: the icy coldness, which is of course essential for their characters, was finely balanced by sorrows and torments common to all of us. In the end, for all their appalling selfishness, I was sorry for Marquiese who lived to see her whole world destroyed beyond repair, and I definitely found the Vicomte very likeable, even compelling, especially considering his longing for something had never experienced: a true love, an union of souls and bodies entirely devoid of any self-interest.

In conclusion, this is superb movie exploring the eternal war between the flesh and the spirit; if anything, it is MORE relevant today, in our supposedly free thinking but actually abominably loose times, than it was few centuries ago. In addition to great script and some of the finest dialogue ever written for the screen, the movie boasts sumptuous historical sets and costumes, very nice soundtrack, the right dose of high comedy and, above all, stunning acting, particularly by Glenn Close and John Malkovich in the leading roles but also by Michelle Pfeiffer in the most important supporting one. Nobody who cares about cinema as a form of art should miss this movie. It rewards a re-watching also.

P. S. It goes without saying that this movie is on a significantly higher plane than ''Cruel Intentions'', but this is no reason to degrade the latter. It is made as a teen comedy by design and it is a very clever adaptation of a story which was originally much more like a film noir, rather than a comedy. Besides, ''Cruel Intentions'' does not in the least lack some substance, though admittedly of a lighter kind than the one in ''Dangerous Liaisons''.",1308355200,3,4931,5.096534653465347
326314,4,6301334523,"this was a refreshing movie to watch, since it was very well done--the characters were believable, intricate plot, great costumes, and highly emotionally charged.  Two things that keep this from being a great 5 star movie, and there are probably others, but what took me out of the story, i.e., interrupted the ""fictional dream,"" as it's called in literature, is Michelle Pfeiffer's character's initial change of heart that opened the door for Malkovich's character to get close to her.  It seemed like she was repulsed by him, then she wasn't.  It was a quick turn. Part of this is it just being a movie--you don't have a lot of time to show the minute changes that would cause a drastic change of heart.  The other thing was that Malkovich's character changes, realizes he was a really rotten person, and this is probably the climax of the movie, or at the least the beginning of the falling action, if one can separate the two; I felt that Glenn Close's character should have had a similar transformation, and perhaps she did, but it should have been more dramatized rather than through the ending that we are given, only because she and Malkovich are such rotten manipulators that seeing Glenn Close's character own up to her deeds--she is ultimately the one even behind Malkovich's characters nasty deeds--would have been highly satisfying for the viewer.",1300838400,,1360,4.874458874458875

Don't get me wrong, I like historical movies and (especially) British mysteries, but most of them have some redeeming values; however, I could not find any in this film.

326321,4,6301334523,"Movie redeems itself in the last 20 minutes almost making you forgive the first hour and a half that you must suffer through.

Namely you will suffer through Malkovich's gaudy American accent as he goes around deflowering virgins in his flowery French turn-of-the-19th-century attire.  Perhaps this movie would have been better enjoyed with the French voice-over and subtitles. At least it would have lent some credibility to the detailed costumes and sets.

Second, most of the seducing and getting seducted that seems to be most of this movie comes off somewhat forced.  It's hard to beleive any woman could be seduced by Malkovich's character.  His overlong, lingering looks are enough to turn your stomach.

In Dangerous Liasons, you get to see a lot of Hollywood stars back in their prime.  You get to see ""a lot"" of Uma Thurman, almost worth the price of admission alone.  In spite of this, much of the acting is kind of wooden - bland accents not helping matters and the story is rather boring as well up until nearly the end of movie when everything is finally put into perspective, and some of the acting actually gets pretty good (Close in particular).  It takes a long time to generate much suspense or interest. Or beleivablility!  A man who goes through the task of deflowering both Uma Thurman AND Michelle Pfeifer for the sole purpose of getting a roll in the hay with Glenn Close?!  Come on!! OK, I'm joking.  By the end of the movie we have a deeper understanding of the characters (and certainly more than enough time invested in them) and can all the more savor the final ironies.  It still gives me chills to think of the closing scene with Glenn close wiping off her make-up.

Let me just say that prior to the ending of this movie I was ready to give it a whopping 3 stars.  The movie ends so well however that I nearly forgot all the gripes I'd been compiling the first long hour and a half.

326336,4,6301334523,"Dangerous Liaisons
This movie, to say the least, is very different. It is a period piece from the 1700s and takes place in France. Vicomte de Valmont and Marquise de Mertuil have become obsessed with destroying people's life. They find it entertaining and treat it like a sick game. Vicomte was summoned by Marquise to carry out the deed of deflowering a family member of hers, Cecile de Volanges. Cecile is set to marry Marquise's ex-husband and Marquise wants her revenge for him leaving her. Vicomte refuses to accept such a petty task and claims he is on his own mission. His mission is to corrupt another women named Madame de Tourvel, of course by deflowering her and destroying sense of moral. He will be leaving for his Aunt's home to find her soon. The two make a bet that Vicomte cannot finish his personal mission; if he does then Marquise will sleep with him.

Vicomte is one of the most devious main characters I have ever seen. Every move he makes is cunning and used to rip apart his victims until they fall into his arms. Marquise often helps him in his sinister plots to destroy these women. This is one of my favorite villains of all time, and I am happy that he is the main character.

Marquise eventually makes it able for Vicomte to do both assignments by moving Cecile into Vicomte's Aunt's home. Cecile had desired a young man named Chevalier Danceny, played by Keanu Reeves, and Marquise suggested a move into the country with Vicomte's Aunt. From there Vicomte approaches both tasks in hopes to win over Marquise.

The story is wonderful and it continues to amaze you how evil Vicomte really is. He smiles after every single sick move he makes just to show you how evil he is. Before the end of the movie you will see a different side of him though, a side that cares less about Marquise and more about one of his victims.

326338,5,6301334523,"My adoration of period pieces should have brought me to this film a long time ago, truly, but sadly I had never even heard of this movie until 1999 when a certain `Cruel Intentions' blazed its way into my life (I still kick myself for forgetting to include that film in my top ten of `99).  After expressing my devotion to the beautifully twisted film my cousin asked me if I had seen the film that inspired it.  She then proceeded to tell me about this film called `Dangerous Liaisons' starring Glenn Close and Michelle Pfeiffer and suddenly I found myself experiencing heart palpitations beyond normal.  I just had to see this movie immediately.

And I did; that very evening in fact.

`Dangerous Liaisons', based on Choderlos de Laclos' 1782 novel `Les Liaisons Dangereuses', finds French aristocrats (and former lovers) Marquise Isabelle de Merteuill and Victomte Sebastien de Valmont weaving their schemes of betrayal and deceit all over 18th century France.  Isabelle and Sebastien fancy themselves with destruction of the people around them, hurting others for their own selfish pleasures and taking pride in their manipulations and conspiracies.  Issues arise though when Sebastien finds himself falling into love with his latest victim, the young and beautiful Madame Marie de Tourvel, and this spark of genuine emotion derails his tryst with Isabelle and threatens to destroy everything in the process.

`Dangerous Liaisons' is superbly crafted.  Everything from the beautifully detailed set pieces to the stunning costumes and cinematography to the brilliant script and impeccable direction are all top-notch and carry this film to a whole other level.

What really drives it over the edge though is the phenomenal acting on the parts of the three leads.  John Malkovich may not posses the same dashing good looks as Ryan Phillippe but he has undeniable charm and a firm grasp on his character.  The development of Sebastian in `Cruel Intentions' is a different direction than that taken for Sebastien in `Dangerous Liaisons' and so it's truly unfair to compare the two performances for ultimately they are different people all together.  Michelle Pfeiffer is stunning as usual here, but her control and innocence when fleshing out Marie is so mature and flawless that I'm almost tempted to say this is her finest performance to date (but Michelle is so good in everything it's hard to say that for sure).  Taking the majority of the praise and admiration though is Glenn Close who is ravishingly superior in this film.  Her performance is luminous, truly absorbing and commanding and delicious to watch.  She is the ultimate villain; cunning and witty; able to manipulate the audience into loving our loathing of her.  I'm soured by her Oscar loss; but at least she received the nomination.

The supporting players hold their weight, especially Uma Thurman who is able to transcend the confines of her character and stand out as memorable indeed.  Swoosie Kurtz delivers strongly here as well.  Keanu Reeves is an actor I detest strongly.  I have never felt he delivered strongly, except maybe in the first `Matrix' film where his deadpan delivery aided in the formation of Neo.  Aside from that though, he continues to bore me with his lack of talent.  In `Dangerous Liaisons' he manages to entertain me slightly, delivering maybe his best performance (thankfully it's not a focal point of the film) and so I'll refrain from attacking him full on here.  He is far from a good actor, but he doesn't disgust me here (I may be blinded by my adoration of the balance of the film though).

What I love most about `Dangerous Liaisons' is its ability to expose the dangers of love and betrayal, of wealth and greed and selfishness.  At its deepest point, `Dangerous Liaisons' is a film about the decline of morals and the destructive nature of our own carnal desires.

In the end I have nothing but the utmost love for `Dangerous Liaisons'.  If you are a fan of the modern adaptation that is `Cruel Intentions' then prepare yourself for the ultimate treat and rent this masterpiece.  Steven Frears (who should have received the Direction nomination for this) brilliantly crafts a film that embraces its strengths and amplifies them marvelously.  It's a period piece; it's a drama; it's a thriller; it's a black comedy and it's a romance, and it succeeds effortlessly on every account.",1209945600,3,4390,4.990384615384615

Although there is a lot similar between Dangerous Liasions & Cruel Intentions (many of the lines stay practically the same), and Swoosie Kurtz, who plays Madame de Volange, went on to play Dr. Greenbaum in Cruel Intentions (in both films, Valmont seduces her daughter), there's just something magical missing.

326355,5,6301334523,"The period costumes for this movie were sumptuous--I wish I could wear some of the pretty dresses sported by Michelle Pfieffer and Glenn Close!

Anyhoo, the acting is top-notch, from the soon-to-be-corrupted Uma Thurman's Cecile, the moral Michelle Pfieffer's Madame de Tourvel, the sans conscience Glenn Close's Marquise de Merteuil, to the role that would typecast John Malkovich for more than a few movies, his notorious Vicomte de Valmont. (You can see that Malkovich's Osmond in ""A Portrait of a Lady"" channels the pre-repentant Valmont.) The only slight off-casting was Keanu Reeve's role of music teacher/lover of Cecile and the Marquise. Keanu is great in The Matrix movies and in ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure,"" but I don't think this role was his best work.

I have read almost half of the novel by Choderlos de Laclos and will one day complete it (I have a very bad habit of reading several books at the same time and of neglecting a book I had started to read for many months b/f I pick it up again).  There's one scene in the book that was also depicted in the movie that I particularly like.  In order to build ""brownie points"" with Madame de Tourvel, Valmont, knowing full well he was being followed by a servant of Madame de Tourvel, paid the debts of a peasant family who were about to be evicted.  In the book (this book is written in epistolary style, that is, the whole book consists of letters characters have written to each other), Valmont admitted to the Marquise that he felt genuine pleasure and was even moved to tears when he helped save this family from ruin.  He recognized that ""do-gooders"" receive a sense of pleasure from their charity, and that this pleasure has its own value---not of the same vein of the pleasure of self-gratification that Valmont usually sought.  This scene's brief glimpse of Valmont's ""higher self"" would later take root in his sincere love for Madame de Tourvel.  That a blackguard who's capable of abysmal cruelty can come to love the angelic Madame de Tourvel is sight for sore eyes.
Unfortunately, Valmont wasn't exactly clear about his own feelings until the Marquise spelled them out for him.  He had indeed loved the good Madame de Tourvel, and he was attracted to her goodness, a quality not often intact among his other lovers and acquaintances.

Michelle Pfieffer really engaged the audience's sympathies when she broke down after Valmont told her he must end the relationship and that this break was ""beyond his control."" All of her worst fears about Valmont and the warnings she had received against him seemed to be confirmed. However, Madame de Tourvel was informed before she died that Valmont had indeed loved her and that the time he spent with her was the happiest of his whole life.  This aspect of the movie/book is about as far as you can get from cynicism and transcends the other ""nasty, decadent"" relationships in ""Dangerous Liasisons.""  Valmont's eleventh-hour repentance was beautiful, skillfully enacted by Malkovich b/f his death.

The Marquise was devastated when she learned of Valmont's death.  She was booed at a concert after letters of her treachery were circulated (one of Valmont's dying wishes).

On the special features, the actors gave some feedback about their characters. Glenn Close attributed the Marquise's cruelty in part due to the lack of options women had back then.  The Marquise was preoccupied with challenging and violating conventions while keeping up the appearance of them. John Malkovich was less sympathetic towards his character and just called Valmont's life a waste. However, his character's change of heart was better late than never.",1153872000,2,3658,4.9526143790849675

I like technology too much, and I find that human interactions without even a telephone are just too limited.

It is based on a novel of the same title written and taking place in France before the revolution, in the highly decadent upper class society. The same story was filmed at the same time in another very good movie, Valmont.

Apart from beautiful cinematography and great acting, the story is gripping and has wonderful characters, particularly the two main characters (played by Glenn Close and John Malkovich) who are perhaps the best *nasty* characters in any story ever. They are just really slimy. And yet they they can feel love and regret, which of course are weaknesses in really nasty people, and this leads to their downfall.

The ending is so well done and the last shot of Close is perfect.  The setting is stunning, the movie perfectly captures Ancient Regime France and the inner sanctum of the nobility.

326360,5,6301334523,"Dangerous Liasons is more or less an intrigue movie placed in an historical drama setting. While the intrigue and viciousness of the two main protagonists (played brilliantly by Glenn Close and the effortlessly evil John Malkovitch) seems modern, it does in fact have a basis in historical fact. Not that anything in the movie (or the novel for that matter) actually happened, but 18th century France (and most of Europe, for that matter) was a society much different from our own. The aristocracy, revelling in decandence, controlled all of the wealth, power, and influence. As absolute power corrupts absolutely, the aristocracy thought very little of human life besides their own, privileged lives. In this context, Dangerous Liasons works beautifully as a historical drama as the aristocratic Close & Malkovitch play games with human lives- until the game spirals out of control.
  As a period piece, Dangerous Liasons is a beautiful film. The settings, costumes, and cinematography are all splendid, giving the film a truly authentic feel. The script is EXCELLENT, with complicated machinations being attempted by both Close and Malkovitch as each tries to outdo the other. The complex characterizations add a depth to the script that really makes the story compelling to watch.
  The true hailing of Dangerous Liasons though, is the ACTING. Both Close and Malkovitch are SUPERB in their roles- Close is the epitome of aristicratic coldness, while Malkovitch's understated approach rings of evil masked beneath a thin veneer.
Michelle Pfeiffer also delivers the goods, as does virtually all of the supporting cast. The one exception, of course, is Keanu ""Meathead"" Reeves, who is quite possibly the worst actor to ever acheieve success in the history of Hollywood (his ONLY decent performance: Reeves was quite good in The Matrix). Why the producers would have cast him (at a time that he had yet to achieve superstar status) in a movie full of TRUE thespians is anyones guess, but Reeves is hopelessly out of his league here, and is Dangerous Liasons only blemish. Still, as an ensemble cast, the acting in Dangerous Liasons is absolutely FIRST RATE.

Who was the lady (Glenn Close) in the VIP box and what has she done to provoke such a unified response from the audience of the theatre? What followed was the retelling of her story and her infamous endeavours.

Marquise (Glenn CLose) was a stunning beauty, wicked and calculating, strong-willed and manipulating. What she called as a power of struggle between the sexes boiled down to a war for her to win all at all costs. She would rather declare victory over other women who might threaten her (or rather her vanity). People around her, played by John Malkovich,Michelle Pfeiffer, Swoozie Kurtz, Uma Thurman, Keenu Reeves, were all unknowingly her puppets. The one closest to knowing the truth (John Malkovich) was also her vehicle to carry out her vicious schemes and succumbed to her plot.

This was a tragic story because it was a lose-lose-lose situation; everyone (including Marquise) was a victum in the end. True love was not rewarded. Neither vanity and happiness went to any of them. The movie offers fine performance of the star-studded cast and detailed costumes and sets. One of a kind.",1133568000,3,1197,4.805825242718447
326384,5,6301334523,"Marquise de Merteuil (Glenn Close) and Vicomte de Valmont (John Malkovich) are the lead characters in this movie. Both of them were determined to get what they want, revenge for the Marquise, and glory and notoriety for the Vicomte. And together they orchestrated an arrangement that would destroy the virtuous and innocent Madame de Tourvel (Michelle Pfeiffer) and the nave Cecile (Uma Thurman). The plan went off track when one of them fell in love with the prey and what follows was a power struggle between the Marquise and the Vicomte that would lead to everyone's destruction.

Glenn Close gave a marvelous performance in a role she's so adept at playing. She had that ""period appropriate"" spunk and edge that made you believe that she's some sort of society goddess. When she finally got what she deserved in the end of the movie, she magnificently conveyed a person crushed by defeat. And is it just me or is her fate more tragic than the fates of the Vicomte and Madame de Tourveil combined? John Malkovich, the chameleon himself, matched Close every step of the way. His arrogant and assured characterization of the Vicomte was very effective, physically he may not be the most attractive man but he made you believe that he was THE MAN of that time.

Pfeiffer gave a touching and devastating performance. She perfectly captured the different stages of the character's development from the harmless, righteous woman to her struggles to the advances of the Vicomte and eventually of her own feelings, to finally surrendering and allowing herself be part of that ""dangerous liaison"" and finally to being heartbroken of how that liaison concluded. Her best scene was when she was subtly but visibly fighting her own emotions as she was clearly falling for the Vicomte. The guilt, self restrain, and the helpless and inevitable surrender she conveyed in that scene was an acting ahowcase for her. You believe that it was ""beyond her control"".

The number of times this story has been told in movies as well as in other mediums (novel and theater) somehow shows how fascinating the story is. The main structure of the story was brilliantly put into the screen. It's engaging, elegant, and very interesting. The different character intersections with each other through out the movie were nicely done as they used each other to act out their lust, revenge, deceit, and manipulation. The three major characters were all fully realized characters. All of the three's last scene (which happen to be not with each other) provide memorable and powerful closures with Close's character appropriately getting the very last scene as her societal reign was tragically put into an end.

Some of the scenes, with their rich dialog, blow me away, especially the scenes between Valmont (John Malkovich) and the Marquis (Glen Close). The characters in this movie are deep, complicated human beings.  John Malkovich and Glen Close give an outstanding performance.

My two favorite parts in this movie are the opening scene and the final scene.  In the opening scene, the Marquise de Merteuil (Glen Close) brushes her hair in the mirror and smiles to herself, as she sees her reflection.  The final scene is of the Marquise taking off her makeup and looking at her reflection in same mirror.  This time there are tears running down her face.  The Marquis tells Valmont that her desire is to ""win or die,"" as she seaks personal revenge over a society that gave her no freedom as a woman in upper class 18th century France. If the opening scene is of the Marquis ""winning"", we can guess what this final scene is about.

This is a dramatic movie.  However, this film concludes with a brillent scene which quietly and tragically ends the story.  This final scene is subtle, and creates pity for a character who has been a villain through out the film.",1123718400,3,1378,4.625514403292181
326386,5,6301334523,"The two movies, `Dangerous Liaisons' directed by Stephen Frears and `Valmont', directed by Milos Forman are a real anomoly in that they were released at almost exactly the same time and tell almost exactly the same story, based on an old novel, `Les Liaisons Dangeruese' by Choderlos de Laclos. It is a minor tragedy that `Valmont' received so much less attention and promotion than `Dangerous Laisons'. I suspect that had a lot to do with the fact that `Valmont' was released by the company Orion which may have been in its last throes of survival and simply did not have the means to promote the film.

The only bright side of this situation is that the `Dangerous Liaisons' implementation of this story is much better. It is a sign of the value of `...Liaisons' that it is much better than a really worthy movie.

I believe the difference in the quality of the two movies lies directly on the aptness of the casting and the quality of the acting. On all the lesser qualities which go into making a movie such as set decoration, cinematography, editing, music and the like, the two films are easily on equal terms.

The heart of the matter is in the comparison of `...Liaisons' casting of Glenn Close and John Malkovich in the principle roles versus `Valmont's casting Colin Firth and Annette Bening. While Firth is physically much more believable as a Casanova type, Close and Malkovich are far superior than Bening and Firth at playing world class scoundrels. At the secondary level, `...Liaisons' casting of Uma Thurmen and Keanu Reeves as the two young innocent lovers is immensely more satisfying than the `Valmont casting of unknowns Fairuza Balk and Henry Jones. My memory of their relative careers is a bit dim, but this movie is ample evidence of why Uma and Keanu are big stars today and Fairuza and Henry are footnotes to cinema history.

Of the fifth major role, we have `...Liaisons' casting Michelle Pfeiffer versus `Valmont's casting Meg Tilly. This may be the only role where the two movies are close. Tilly gives a great performance as a nave young wife who ultimately gives into Valmont's seductions, but I think Pfeiffer is even better. Here, the difference may have been in the writing, as I suspect Pfeiffer's role is just a bit more strongly written, so Michele had more to work with.

If nothing else convinces you, compare the seduction scenes between Malkovich and Thurmen versus Firth and Balk and the mix of sweetness with darkness in the former versus the pure soft core porn of the latter will carry the day.",1123632000,29,2539,4.761363636363637

Justin Chang from California wrote that he ""didn't completely buy Malkovich as the charming lady-killer"" and that casting him in the role was a ""a small but serious flaw that undermines the whole film"". Bulls**t!

How could anyone watch Malkovich's stellar performance and think of nothing except looks. Hollywood is so full of ""good-looking"" actors and actresses who can't act their way out of a paper bag. In modern times we often value conventional beauty over all other aspects of a person's character. A lot of these Hollywood hunks wish they could act as well as Mr. Malkovich.

I of course saw Cruel Intentions when it had first came out, and thought it was just the greatest thing due to my infatuation with Ryan Phillippe lol. However, after seeing Dangerous Liaisons, I've realized that Cruel Intentions shouldn't have ever been made. I mean honestly why would this guy even think that making a remake as... watered down as Cruel Intentions would even come as close to being as good as the original? Don't get me wrong, Ryan is still hot, but hell no this version is better. I recommend anyone who is like me, and hasn't seen it yet to get this dvd. If you even thought of liking Cruel Intentions, you'll love this.

Just.. one little issue on the other hand. John Malkovich is not the least bit sexy, and therefore I was not completely convinced that he was such the ladies man as he was portrayed to be. I understand ""it's just a movie"" and all, but honetly. I don't know maybe it wasn't his appearance that made him so wanted.

Alfred Hitchcock sated in a famous interview with Francois Truffaut that the three fundamentals factors for a good movie were to his mind: 1)A good script, 2)A good script and 3) A good script. And if also you add the presence of this glorious cast you the obtained result will be by far, still major than the sum of its parts.

This mature drama is a cold bet between two outlaw human beings, far descendents in spirit, evidently of Don Juan. One of them, the female will establish the rules of the game and the other part will have to make the agreement. In this sinister everything will be allowed and the goal will justify the way to reach it.

The seduction has never had such sinister face, understood as the unspoken road to blend two different wills in the final act. In this case, the seduction is just the frame and not the landscape. You can argue all what your imagination, good manners, touch of class, and promises of never ending love the feminine soul can accept. And all this huge effort is done just to satisfy a genuine and perverse fascination: the vanity .

But as you know the life owns much more imagination than us and in this macabre labyrinth the love may be spying on behind our unconscious wishes and twisting our original purposes.

John Malkovich simply remarkable with the role of his life until the date, draws an admirable portrait . Glenn Close is superb too as the perverse, analytical and cold mind. Pfeiffer and Thurman are unequal playing the role of the ambitioned objects of desire.

The dialogues are eloquent; the artistic decoration, design customer, photography and edition are first rate. This film owned all the demanded conditions to win all the possible acclaims and prizes all over the world. If the result was not the expected you will have to find other kind of explanations far distant and certainly not so pleasant.

But the time has always been the best judge to emphasize the supreme qualities of the real masterpieces, and in this case this picture will not be able the exception. You can realize how its cult status has prevailed and even improved through the years and definitively this constitutes a good signal.  Based on the famous Ninon De Lenclos ' s novel until that date had never received such a deep treatment.

Based on Laclos's novel of love as war, the movie, if viewers can allow themselves to view it with the eyes and spirit of its participants, can be wicked fun. The plot, especially at first, is fairly complicated, but soon the pieces fall together, and the maneuvering and scheming wend their way toward their bitter end. And it is bitter.

But it's hard to shake off what we have come to think of love after the Romantics: this is pure calculation for personal gains only, a game as ruthless as any in a high stakes poker tournament. The principals are superb in their battle garb and tactics, but it left me feeling icy all over. Perhaps as it should, but it's good to note that even here true love has its victory and its ultimate revenge, both where they rightfully belong. An excellent production.

326391,5,6301334523,"OK, so Dangerous Liaisons is a little dated.  The story is over 200 years old, and the film is over 15 years old.  So, you might be weary of buying it for its age.  Don't be!

The story, which everyone knows by now, centers around two bored aristocrats, the Marquise de Merteuil (Close) and the Vicomte de Valmont (John Malkovich) who take pleasure in meddling in people's love lives and corrupting them.  The point of the story is that the Vicomte finally falls in love with one of his conquests, Madame de Tourvel (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Close, who is in love with him, struggles to keep him from being with Madame de Tourvel.

An overdone love story?  Not at all.  The complexity of the plot, the power of the acting, and the beauty of the set and costumes provide for a rich, captivating film.  Originally I thought Malkovich was a miscast -- I thought he contrived his role too much -- but eventually I changed my mind, and appreciate his dynamic more now.  Close plays a fantastic Marquise.  Her talent shines throughout the entire film.  She truly makes the film excellent.  The fact that she did not win the Oscar does not matter -- this role was made for her, and she for the role.  There should have been two Oscars awarded for Best Actress that year.  Michelle Pfeiffer and Uma Thurman interpret their roles well, and Swoosie Kurtz plays a fitting Madame de Volanges.  I was amused by the fact that Kurtz also did 'Cruel Intentions,' 10 years later.

The plot of the film was well done, well interpreted.  I was mildly disappointed that the film skips over the Marquise's experience with Prvan, a corrupting mirror of Valmont whom she conquers and then brags about quite explicitly in a letter.  That could have been included.  The costumes and set are flawless -- the three Oscars that the film won for these categories were well deserved.

All in all, a deserving film.  Worth buying and watching twice, at least.",1105056000,6,1927,4.622418879056047
326392,3,6301334523,"Considering that 'Les Liaisons Dangereuses' by Choderlos de Laclos is perhaps my favorite novel (or tied, at least, with 'The Island of the Day Before' by Umberto Eco), I would probably be expected to rate Dangerous Liaisons with a nine, at least, yet I could not do so in good conscience. Frankly, I find this film to be something of an insult.

Anybody who has read the novel understands that its brilliant rests in the sublte nuances of dialogue between the vicomte and the marquise and of de Laclos's familiarity and analysis with the unspoken aspects of falling in love, not to mention the eloquence of the writing itself. Unfortunately, very little of the novel's charm shines through in Dangerous Liaisons. The film's attempts to recreate the wit of the novel often seem stale or childish and, worse yet, the the film fails to build up to its rising action and climax, almost assuming that the viewer already knows the story. Before the film properly introduces the characters, already they're making wagers, and how could the beautiful young presidente de tourvel possibly fall in love with such a clumsy snob.

How, in fact, could anybody fall in love with a Vicomte de Valmont as played by John Malkovich. Although a spectacular actor, Malkovich would come across more natural in a suit or a tank top, something a bit more masculine; the character of Valmont requires somebody more charming, not only to make the costumes work, but to correctly portray the persona. Watching Malkovich in the role of Valmont is not unlike watching Alan Greenspan dance the Macaraina in short-shorts and a Wham shirt. For that matter, how is the the viewer expected to believe that Uma Thurman is a fifteen year-old ingenue just out of a convent, and that Valmont is really so desparate to go to bed with Glenn Close after having Thurman? The film's saving grace in this regard would certainly be Michelle Pfeiffer who was not only the proper age for her role, but as also able to adapt to her character. Also, Kiannu Reeves as the Chevalier Danceny has probably been his best role to date, although that's not saying a whole lot.

Although Dangerous Liaisons fails to live up to the novel of its origin in most respects, the scenery and costumes were beautifully designed. Since Les Liaisons Dangereuses was an epistolary novel, giving de Laclos no reason to go into detail about clothing and furniture, the artists had a fair amount of liberty, and they did spectacular work with it.

Anybody interested in the French Baroque period or interior design should find at least some pleasure in watching this film, and even the average viewer should be mildly entertained. Fans of Les Liaisons Dangereuses, however, may be disappointed. Basing a film on a book is a bit like matching black clothing: if you can't do it perfectly, don't do it at all.

326393,4,6301334523,"'Dangerous Liaisons' is an adaptation of a scandolous 18th century French book. Glenn Close is the scheming, vicious Marquise De Merteuil, who would like nothing more than to see the man that left her punished. What better way to do this than to have her friend (and ex-lover) the Vicomte De Valmont (John Malkovich) seduce her ex-husband's soon-to-be wife Cecile De Volanges (Uma Thurman).

Whilst we're at it, throw in the virginal Madame De Tourvel (Michelle Pfeiffer) whom the Vicomte is extremely desirous of seducing, Keanu Reeves as a musician who lusts after Cecile and the Marquise, and the fact that the Vicomte lusts after the Marquise but she will not allow him to have her. All in all, somewhat confusing and dense as regards to whom is sleeping with whom and why, but still nasty vicious fun.

Glenn Close and John Malkovich are excellent in their respective roles, and the supporting cast help them along nicely, but you will need to concentrate to understand this period piece.",1103068800,,993,4.904761904761905
326403,5,6301334523,"This is a tale about the ancien rgime in18th century France before the revolution in which the moral decadence of the privileged classes rivaled that of Sodom and Gomorrah and the ancient Romans.  The story comes from a novel by Choderlos de Laclos that was made into a stage play by Christopher Hampton.  It is a cynical satire on human sexuality as well as a very subtle examination of sexual hypocrisy and desire, a kind of oh so sophisticated laugh at bourgeois morality that would have delighted Voltaire and Moliere and greatly amused Shakespeare.  It is a tale of elaborate lechery and revenge that backfires because it seems that anybody, even the most jagged rake can fall in love, and thereby become the victim.

John Malkovich plays the rake, Vicomte de Valmont, whose sole purpose in life is to seduce women, rob them of their virtue and then move on.  Glenn Close plays his back-stabbing confidante and one-time lover, the Marquise de Merteuil.  Michelle Pfeiffer plays the coy and virtuous Madame de Tourvel, who is to be Valmont's latest conquest.  Uma Thurman is cast as a teenaged ingenue who is betrothed to Merteuil's lover while Keanu Reeves plays her naive music teacher and would-be lover, Chevalier Danceny.  Stephen Frears, who has directed such diverse films as The Grifters (1990) and My Beautiful Laundrette (1985), after a somewhat cryptic start, does an excellent job of bringing the biting cynicism of Laclos and Hampton to the screen.

I know of two other versions of this film, Milos Forman's Valmont (1989), starring Colin Firth and Annette Bening, and Roger Vadim's Dangerous Liaisons (1960).  Regrettably, I haven't seen Vadim's film, but Forman's Valmont is excellent.  In polite society comparisons are said to be odious.  I shall proceed anyway:

John Malkovich vs. Colin Firth.  Malkovich is widely recognized as a great actor, but he is clearly miscast in this role, yet he brings a predatory dimension to the part that is in keeping with the overall psychology of the movie.  Firth, while not as celebrated for his acting skills as Malkovich, is nonetheless a fine actor, and his charm and playful inventiveness are more in keeping with the character of Valmont, whom women love.  Call it even.

Glenn Close vs. Annette Bening.  Again Close is considered the more accomplished actor, but Bening is sexier, prettier and considerably more charming.  Whether that is a plus as far as the reality of the novel and play are concerned is debatable.  For my part I found Bening a lot more fun to watch.  Edge to Bening.

Michelle Pfeiffer vs. Meg Tilly.  Pfeiffer is a much bigger star and has more experience as an actress.  She is beautiful, but Tilly is more passionate.  Pfeiffer was nominated for an academy award for best supporting actress for her work here, but did not win.  Personally I thought Tilly was more believable and was especially effective in projecting first the repressed passion and then the complete abandonment as she gives herself to Valmont.  Pfeiffer's portrayal of  Tourvel's coy awakening, with just a hint of duplicity, and then her utter dissolution when he leaves her, was star quality.  Edge to Pfeiffer.

Uma Thurman vs. Fairuza Balk.  I loved them both.  Thurman, of course, is a more statuesque beauty with a polished and controlled acting style, but Balk's wide-eyed innocence was a delight.  Call it even.

Keanu Reeves vs. Henry Thomas.  Thomas was cute, but almost too juvenile to be believed.  Reeves seemed just right for the part.  Clear edge to Reeves.

Frears vs. Forman.  Frears's direction was more cynical, especially in the duel between Valmont and Merteuil in which their mutual and complementary debauchery is in sharp focus.  And his resolution was more clearly defined.  Forman's strength was in the delight and playfulness of many of the scenes, especially those relating to the seduction of Tourvel.  His direction was more comedic and he allowed a greater development of secondary characters, while Frears concentrated more on the two leads.  I give a very small edge to Forman, but would not argue with those preferring Frears.

Bottom line: I liked Forman's movie better, but the voters at the IMDb preferred Frears's Dangerous Liaisons, giving it an average of  7.7 stars out of ten to 6.7 for Valmont.

Some bon mots:

Valmont tells Madame de Tourvel as he dumps her, ""My love had great difficulty outlasting your virtue.  It's beyond my control.""

Valmont demands that the Marquise de Merteuil reply to his proposal of a night together, will it be love or war?  He says, ""A single word is all that is required.""  Long pause, and then she gives him three, ""All right. [Pause.] War.""

When Valmont returns from making love to Madame de Tourvel he reveals to Merteuil that for the first time he may be in love.  He relates his feelings to her, ""I love her.  I hate her...""  The camera turns to Close, who yawns.

Valmont's aunt while consoling Madame de Tourvel, who has confessed that she is in love with Valmont and can't help herself, says, reflecting the wisdom of all who have been there, ""In such matters all advice is useless.""

Toward the end, Valmont says, ""I have no illusions.  I lost them on my travels.""",1095206400,5,5209,4.888
326404,4,6301334523,"Stephen Frears adaptation of Les Liaisons Dangereuse draws the audience into the amorous intrigues of 18th century France. Although Glenn Close as Marquise De Merteuil and John Malkovich the Vicomte De Valmont deliver impeccable performances as the principal characters, the whole setting is ruined by the simply atrocious performances by Keeanu Reeves and Michelle Pfeiffer.

 Reeves and Pfeiffer actually have a lot in common in that their mediocre acting skills undermine the historical setting of the film. As is typical with most method actors, Reeves and Pfeiffer are best at playing their own bland personalities without much creativity: this type of training rarely works in period films as the actor tries to incorporate the character's moods and actions into their own personality as opposed to the other way around. The typical result is that the actor fails to follow the proper idioms, mannerisms, and language of such characters. In short, neither Pfeiffer or Reeves have the tact or skill to play a historical character (This is perfectly demonstrated in Reeve's horrible performance in Coppolla's Dracula.) Typically, successful period films tend to be those that have mostly theatrical actors performing the key roles (i.e. Richard Burton, Alec Guinness, Anthony Hopkins, John Lithgow, James Earl Jones, etc.)

 Although I did somewhat enjoy this rendition, I preferred Milos Foreman's ""Valmont"" with Collin Firth and Annette Benning. The film was more faithful to the cultural sensibilities of 18th century France than Dangerous Liaisons.",1091404800,4,1556,5.497907949790795
326405,5,6301334523,"Dangerous Liaisons is a lush and lavish glimpse into the lives of the 18th century French aristocracy.  The Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont used to be lovers and are now close friends, a powerful but restrained attraction still simmering between them.  They are both twisted people who enjoy manipulating everyone around them, but the foundation of their demise is laid when they make a bet - if Valmont can seduce the virtuous Madame de Tourvel, a married woman of unimpeachable morals, the Marquise will give herself to him for one whole night of romance.  What neither anticipates is that Valmont will fall in love with Tourvel, and that the Marquise will become victim to a destructive jealousy.
Glenn Close is marvelous as the depraved Marquise, and ever so subtly reveals to us the insecurities behind the noblewoman's coldly smiling facade.  Malkovich proves that a man does not need to be conventionally handsome in order to be seductive; he exudes serpentine charm and masterfully acts out the Vicomte's slow and astonishing change of heart.

Follow me so far?  The dowager has no intent of letting the bachelor get his wish or fulfilling her promise to him.  It's all just a sadistic game to her.  She wants everyone to suffer.
Unfortunately it is we, the viewers, that suffer the most throughout this movie.  Warner Brothers has done a dismal job on this transfer.

Well acted, this film really captures the nastiness and excessive nature of the two antagnists played so excellently by Glenn Close and John Malkovich.
Michelle Pieffer is wonderful as the woman who helps Valmont discover true love. Lovely and tragic.
I enjoyed both Uma and Keeanu as the young pawns/lovers but I felt they were both too old to play the characters. Uma seemed much to mature to be 15 year old Cecille.
A earlier review mentions the film Valmont as a remake of this film, that is incorrect. Both films were made during the exact same year, unfortunatly Milos Forman waited an extra year to release his somewhat weaker version so it feels like it is a pale imitation of this version. Neither film had anything to do with the other except they used the same novel as their basis.
Cruel Intentions however is a blatent modern day remake and is actualy quiet good with Reece Witherspoon(Pleasantville, Sweet Home Alabama), Sarah Michelle Geller(Buffy the Vampire Slayer-TV), Ryan Phillipe and others.

However, Valmont also wishes to seduce and disgrace a remote beauty (Michelle Pfeiffer), totally uncaring and unaware of the tragic outcome that will envelope them both.

I found the sets that everyone kept on raving about to be colourless and rather dull. Sarah Michelle Gellar was criticised heavily for her portrayal of being cruel and heartless...but Glenn Close...she had no charisma and no appeal.
Uma Thurman was lovely as always but I found the way the director tackled her miscarriage to be depressing and awful.
All in all I would never ever want to watch it again...I wanted to turn it off with each approaching scene but in the end I subjected myself to the torture of watching Malcovich repeating ""its out of my control"" or something like that and the ridiculous end duel scene.",1012694400,11,1107,4.624365482233503
326436,5,6301334523,"There's a certain degree of sinful pleasure hidden beneath the depravity of ""Dangerous Liaisons,"" a film that is perversely elegant in its execution and daringly naughty in regard to its story. Based on the novel by Choderlos de Laclos, the script by Christopher Hampton explores the cause and effect nature of love, betrayal, and sinful intentions in both humorous and serious lights. While the material could be easily morose and unaffecting, director Stephen Frears spices up his canvas with a beautiful cast and a well-constructed production design.
At the center of the story are two people who feed on the misery they cause others as a way to keep their urges for one another suppressed. Glenn Close is the seductively evil Marquise de Merteuil, a self-proclaimed ""virtuoso of deceit"" who believes it her duty to dominate the opposite sex, and avenge her own. Her latest undertaking involves the daughter of her naive friend Madame de Volanges (Swoozie Kurtz), for whom her former lover left her. In hopes of ruining daughter Cecile's (Uma Thurman) reputation, she calls upon beloved friend and partner in evil, Vicomte de Valmont, played by John Malkovich. Valmont, like Merteuil, prides himself on his accomplishments, and prizes the feeling of success that comes with the devastation he causes to women.
But he has different plans in mind, involving the seduction and ruin of one Madame de Tourvel (Michelle Pfeiffer), whose ideals and virtues are the exact opposite of these two wicked souls. His plan is concocted from the most cruel of intentions: to make her want him so badly that she does not relinquish her beliefs, but instead is crushed by them once she gives in to his advances.
Imagine his surprise when he finds that his task will not be as easy as he had at first hoped. When he finds that Tourvel is far more resistant than first expected, he agrees to aid Merteuil in her quest for revenge against Cecile. As the two weave their intricate web of deception and betrayal, Valmont finds himself in a position he never imagined possible, and Merteuil finds herself in danger of losing her grip over him.
As you may have noticed, I've left out much of the important plot points concerning other characters; half the fun of this film is the unveiling of each evil plan, all of which fall into place in a manner that is ingeniously devilish and supremely potent. The manner in which these actions are carried out, and the overall effects they have, are unsettling, to be sure, yet there's a wondrous sense of awe about them, one that stems from the craftsmanship of such detailed revenges that are disturbing and mesmerizing at the same time.
For such a devious story to work, a talented cast is in order, and ""Dangerous Liaisons"" supplies us with precisely that. Glenn Close is outlandish as Merteuil, mastering with incredible wit and sensibility the calculating nature of her character. She wonderfully portrays the physical beauty used to mask the cold-hearted novice with terrific gusto; in Merteuil's ""win or die"" conversation with Valmont, Close sells us on the character, and also proves her worth as an actress.
Mirroring this delightfully evil performance is that of Malkovich, whose delectable wit and cool masterminding of deceit are supremely effective. For his character to work, there must be two key factors involved: we must believe enough in his ability to seduce and destroy, and we must be able to accept the change of heart that comes after meeting Tourvel. Malkovich is able to accomplish both with suave, debonair charm and true emotional feeling within his words.
High praise to the supporting cast as well, who all give well-rounded performances. Pfeiffer portrays Tourvel's resistance and innocence perfectly, as well as the heartache and hardships once she accepts her feelings for Valmont. The two pawns in Merteuil's wicked game, Cecile and her young love, Chevalier Danceny, are played by Thurman and Keanu Reeves with a much-needed naivety and innocent virtue that casts Merteuil and Valmont in an even more chilling light.
In my praise of the cast, I've neglected to mention the superb art direction and production design for ""Dangerous Liaisons."" Some of the best sets and costumes ever designed for a period motion picture reside here, conveying the elegance and aristocracy of pre-Revolution France in a very accurate manner; the bawdy, forceful score by George Fenton also receives high marks.

The first thing that strikes you is how well the film is lit and shot. The period locations and costumes are visually sumptuous and perfect. Better yet, the acting entirely matches the skill of the direction that takes its method from the theatre - emotions are conveyed by expression and not dialogue. Glenn Close gives her best performance on celluloid as the scheming Madame de Merteuil, amorally hellbent on bending everyone to her will, no matter the method or the cost, and John Malkovitch is her perfect foil as the cynical hedonistic but world-weary Valmont. Michelle Pfeiffer engages our empathy as the tortured and manipulated target of Malkovitch's desire and Close's plotting.
The film is basically a morality tale, but one that fascinates in its exposure of ego, vanity, intrigue and the war between the genders, subjects that are timeless in their relevance, despite the period setting.

326444,4,6301334523,"At first glance, DANGEROUS LIAISONS appears to be an extravagant eighteenth-century period-piece, which it is; the powdered wigs and  overflowing corsets typical of the genre are all here, and the  cinematography is appropriately glossy.  But boiling beneath the elegant  surface are the deviously twisted sensibilities of two monstrous  characters--the Marquise de Merteuil (Glenn Close) and the Vicomte de  Valmont (John Malkovich), a pair of schemers (and former lovers) who take  pleasure in coolly manipulating and seducing those around them.  The  Marquise challenges the Vicomte to seduce the virtuous Madame de Tourvel  (Michelle Pfeiffer), but when the latter finds himself genuinely falling in  love with his intended prey, the game quickly turns fatal--with devastating  consequences for everyone involved.
A period-piece?  Yes, but one honed  with a distinctly contemporary menace.  It's rare, for example, to find a  period-piece with such delicious, razor-sharp dialogue (which garnered the  film an Academy Award for Best Screenplay Adaptation).  It's also rare to  find a period-piece that focuses primarily on sex, but treats its subject  matter with so little eroticism.  DANGEROUS LIAISONS is more about power  and one-upmanship; sex merely serves as the weapon of choice.  It's a  diabolically entertaining film, a decadent one even; there's something both  disturbing and enjoyable about watching the two central characters  indulging in their elaborate power plays.
The performances are strong for  the most part (Close, Malkovich, and Pfeiffer all received Oscar  nominations), although the women fare much better than the men.  Glenn  Close does a magnificent job as the evil Marquise, and supplies the film  with some of its most explosive moments--the scene in which she quietly  utters the word ""War"" without batting an eyelash is chilling beyond words.  I didn't completely buy Malkovich as the charming lady-killer (a small but  serious flaw that undermines the whole film), but he does a fine job with  what he's given.  Keanu Reeves, as usual, is utterly unfathomable, even in  a relatively minor part.  The best performance of all is delivered by  Michelle Pfeiffer; as the tormented wife, she bares every inch of her moral  anguish, and the results are heartbreaking to behold.  Behind the  cold-blooded duo of Close and Malkovich, it's Pfeiffer who provides the  emotional heart of the film, and in every one of her pained expressions  lies the evidence of the very human consequences at stake.",965088000,114,2528,5.437823834196891

I have honestly tried to read the book (in English and French) without the success of being able to finish it. Just so convoluted. But the film makes everything clear: it's one of those that - no matter how often you see it - you can envision that it just might end differently!",1518566400,,425,4.605263157894737
