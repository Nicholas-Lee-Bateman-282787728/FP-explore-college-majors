8157848,5,630244764X,Very good combination of actors and singers. And the right touch of scariness versus reality - and the ominous changes in her dress is a stroke of genius.,1357430400,,154,4.535714285714286
8157849,5,630244764X,"Filmed in Czechoslovakia, with a cast that seems perfectly suited physically to the James' novel's descriptions, Turn of the Screw has the added advantage of Britten's ""regulars"" (Peter Pears et al)  providing the music to which the actors flawlessly lipsynch. The atmosphere  evoked visually and musically does full service to both the intricacies and  shading of the opera, and to the psychological ambiguities of the plot and  characters. Truly one of the best filmed, sung, and acted opera videos in  recent memory.",913075200,3,519,5.280487804878049
