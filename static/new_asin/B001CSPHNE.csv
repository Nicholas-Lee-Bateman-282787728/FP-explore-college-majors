8289074,5,B001CSPHNE,"Yurie is in the 8th grade. One day she finds out that she is a goddess. Her friend lives at a local shrine and encourages her to become the local deity. Yurie is a very timid and sweet girl, so she takes some time to fit into her new role. She has a crush on a boy named Kenji. Most of her motivation for trying harder is an attempt to earn his affection. Yurie is an adorable and very likable character. The type of girl that you wanna hug, pat on the head, and say good job kid-o. The different adventures and experiences she has give her a little more courage and confidence. She may adjust to her new responsibility and be able reach the boy she likes.

This anime is great. It is very slow paced and relaxed. At first the show seems like it may be kinda boring, but after the characters grow on you and the story develops, it's a whole lot of fun and a great escape from everyday life. The animation, soundtrack, and voice actors are all very good. You'll recognize Johnny Yong Bosch from Bleach, and Eureka Seven. He plays the aloof, and clueless Kenji. The rest of the voice actors are all pretty good too; they fit their roles very well. I realize that this is an expensive show to buy, but it's worth the price. It's very memorable, uplifting, and wholesome. It is probably intended for girls and teenagers, but it's a pretty clean show. I wouldn't have a problem showing it to an 11 year old. Maybe even younger. Kamichu is great, I'll cherish this anime for a long time.",1356912000,,1481,4.308243727598566

Yurie Hitosubashi is just your everyday average middle school student. Well, until she woke up one morning as a goddess. Yurie isn't really sure how she became a goddess, or what she is supposed to do now, but her classmate Matsuri has some ideas. Namely, use Yurie's newfound divinity to promote he family's shrine and replace their current, rather useless, god Yashima. Now Yurie works hard at her new job, granting wishes, curing curses, meeting aliens, and attending god conventions. All this while attending school and trying to find the courage to confess to Kenji. No one said being a goddess was easy!

This was a very cute, laid-back show. Yurie is a very likable heroine and she handles her situation quite well considering. Her friends, Mitsue the practical and Matsuri the very energetic, work well with Yurie's innocence and cuteness. But my favorite part of the show were the elements of Shintoism that were so prevalent. The many kami, Matsuri's family shine, festivals, and many other things, added an element of the fantastical to what would normally be vignettes of small-town life.

Kamichu! is a slow-paced show full of sweetness and whimsy. Do yourself a favor and give it a try.",1330905600,5,1317,4.950226244343892
8289076,5,B001CSPHNE,"When this was delivered, I opened it and felt as though a different world landed on my lap. The packaging was done with care; and the shipping time was more than sufficient.  Overall, I would say this buyer is great and I would difinitely feel comfortable doing business with them again.",1282435200,2,287,4.627450980392157
8289077,5,B001CSPHNE,"Though it feels like a ton of filler stories of the life of a middle-school god, Kamichu is really a bunch of insights into the life of a wonderfully socially-awkward girl. My wife and I have both enjoyed watching this show, and the odd humor that exists both in front of and behind the camera.",1273881600,3,294,4.363636363636363

8289079,5,B001CSPHNE,"I bought my first Pioneer (Geneon) product back when Pioneer laser discs were nearly the only way to find anime translated into English. Tenchi Muyo was the anime that had me hooked. I was saddened but not surprised when Geneon left the US market, because none of its later offerings, including later Tenchi series, were as good a Pioneer's first offering. I was very pleased to discover Kamichu as one of Geneon's final offerings, and this turned out to be the best anime series the company ever offered. No fights. No giant robots. No sex. No gore. No whacky space aliens. Just three Japanese junior high girls who try to cope when one of them announces that she, inexplicably, has become a god in the Shinto sense. This is a very sweet story, so sweet it may induce cavities or a diabetic coma. The animation is among the best cell animation I have ever seen, with no shortcuts taken, and no mismatching computer animation jammed in here and there. The voice acting, on both the Japanese and English tracks are among the best i have ever heard, and is age appropriate to the characters. If you want family-friendly anime, or a anime series to introduce your lady friend to your anime hobby, this may be the series for you. If all of Pioneer - Geneon's offerings had been the quality of Kamichu, the company might not have found it necessary to leave the U.S. Market. Short, Sweet, and among the very best!",1222387200,28,1408,4.591269841269841
8289080,4,B001CSPHNE,"Saw this last year on Youtube. Animation is very well done,
especially the accurate landscape shots. This a a very cute
slice of life anime with inventive fantasy elements woven in. Yurie's school life is complicated by her two girlfriends attempts to benefit from her new godly status, and Yurie's tentative romantic pursuit of a clueless male
classmate whose first love is calligraphy. A very sweet and
original anime, highly recommended for those tired of mechas, swordfights, and ecchi stuff.
