7131432,4,B00WFDJ5WO,"Okay, just like all of One Piece, Enies Lobby and Water 7 are fantastic arcs. I want to give this five stars, I really do. I took away one star because of how Funimation organized their DVD collection; This includes all the way up to Season 6 Voyage 5, but does not include Voyage 6. Collection 14 is available for pre-order right now, but Season 6 Voyage 1 has been available for purchase for awhile now. Why wouldn't you include Voyage 6 in Collection 13 and start Collection 14 with Thriller Bark? I don't want to have to wait until Collection 14 comes out just to watch the end of season 5, when season 6 is already available.",1445040000,,630,4.3474576271186445
