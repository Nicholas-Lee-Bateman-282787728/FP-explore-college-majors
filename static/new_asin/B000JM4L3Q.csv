8152337,4,B000JM4L3Q,"The Discovery Channel's documentary series Unsolved History presents JFK: Death In Dealey Plaza.  Every known photograph and piece of film that was taken in Dealey Plaza that day is pieced together to create a sequential timeline of the assassination as it happened, from the time when the limousine turned from Main St. onto Houston to the end of the Zapruder film on Elm St.  The ultimate goal of the documentary is to show the area covered by every photograph taken and reel of film shot so the viewer can see the missed opportunities by photographers and people with home movie cameras.  This documentary basically leaves the viewer saying to themselves, ""What if?""  In other words, what if Elsie Dorman hadn't shaken the camera so badly and been looking through the viewfinder?  She could have captured the whole assassination sequence from the book depository overlooking Elm St.  What if Tina Towner had continued to film the limousine after it turned onto Elm from Houston?  What if Abraham Zapruder had pointed his camera a little bit more to the right after the Kennedy limo disappeared underneath the railroad bridge?  He would have captured the area behind the picket fence on the grassy knoll.  What if Orville Nix had used a correcting filter when taking his footage?  His footage would have came out lighter and might have shown more of the grassy knoll area.  The people who took pictures and shot film that day of course can't be faulted in the slightest way for not capturing and/or doing certain things, as they had no idea what was happening and hadn't the slightest idea that if they would have done some things differently, it could have helped the investigation tremendously.  The photos and home movies are what they are.  This documentary, in my opinion, hints ever so slightly toward actually placing some blame on the people with the cameras that day for not capturing crucial moments on Elm St.

This documentary is narrated by Kathleen Kern.  The curator of the Sixth Floor Museum, Gary Mack, is one of the hosts, along with historian Daniel Martinez.  Some of the guests include Mary Moorman, Tina Towner, Orville Nix, Jr., and many others, including a lot of archive footage of some of the people with cameras that day.

Overall, this is an interesting documentary that is well worth watching.",1296432000,2,2324,4.887755102040816
