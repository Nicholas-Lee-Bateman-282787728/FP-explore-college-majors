8278074,3,B001AMSFR2,"I was under the misconception that this was a kundalini yoga routine, in the style of Ana Brett/Ravi Singh or Gurmukh. But alas, it was not. It was a relatively standard hatha yoga disc. I actually found it really relaxing. It began with a chakra meditation. On screen was a slowly dissolving still image with a voiceover. But I had my eyes closed most of the time, so it didn't particularly matter.

Transition from that into a yoga routine with some more difficult poses like headstand and wheel. A woman who may or may not have been the one doing the voice-over performed each pose in a pleasant yard. After the yoga, we moved back into another meditation.

Although I found this very relaxing, I mostly do kundalini yoga, and only keep a select few discs around that aren't in that style. So hopefully the next person to get my disc will love it. It would be good for an intermediate yogi on a slow day. (No modifications are shown.)",1305504000,,937,4.5058823529411764
