8061592,3,B0009J2N1G,"A nice blend of photo history, narration and lovely models (beware:  some nudity) that traces the early days of the medium through the early Twentieth Century.  I was impressed with the overall production value, both technical and styling.  Certainly not for classroom use but, nevertheless, an enjoyable treatment of what could be a very dry subject.",1463356800,,351,5.232142857142857
8061593,3,B0009J2N1G,"This is a pleasant little video about some attractive women dressing up and undressing shooting some nice photographs of each other with antique and re-produced antique cameras!
It's not information packed about the details of process, materials, time for exposure, technique. I would have liked to have seen more of that technical history. I think it's just a guy thing.
Still the undressing was nice :) thanks.",1274400000,,412,5.164179104477612
8061594,5,B0009J2N1G,"This is the second film I have viewed from Sun Films and I must say I enjoyed it as much as the first (""Photography Paris 1920
"").  This film takes you back to the very begining which gives many examples of some of the first cameras that would have been used and touches on some of the processes of the images of that time. Its very well done with the film like feel of the shooting of the examples in the outdoors and on location, and the naration is very well done.

 Like in my other review I am a photographer and a big fan of the early days of photography, (no pun intended).  If you are a fan of this era I would recomend this film. And like my other review I appreciate that there are film makers out there who are interested in showing us what ""was"" in the fields of photography.",1188000000,3,787,4.090909090909091
