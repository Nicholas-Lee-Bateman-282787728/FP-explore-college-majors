2603468,1,B000GAKQF8,The worst dvd i have ever bought. Crappy packaging. No picture on the disc. No special features. There isn't even a menu because get this there are no chapters. Movie looks terrible too,1401148800,,185,4.636363636363637

LEGACY OF BLOOD (1971).

In a bad late-career move, John Carradine has a minor role as the elderly relative whose demise sets in motion a series of murders. A proviso of the old millionaire's will states that his four adult children must spend a week at the family estate if they want to grab their share of 30 million simollians.

(yawn) Hasn't this story been done many times before?

Remember: in order to inherit YOUR share of Carradine's bucks you must stay awake for the whole 90 minutes it takes to see this turkey. Lots of luck and pass the NO DOZ, please....",1341964800,4,1106,4.774869109947644

2603473,2,B000GAKQF8,"You'd better like ham if you plan to make it through this movie. Nutty old millionaire John Carradine dies and puts a stipulation on the fulfillment of his estate on his four children and three servants via a cranky tape recorded will in which he expresses nothing but loathing for everyone and says bizarre things like ""this might separate the rabbits from the alley cats"" then laughs maniacally. They have to spend a week in his house or they will fail to get their share of the inheritance. Every single person in the film is wholly detestable, and by the halfway mark I didn't care how the film ended as long as it was over.

After the kids are ensconced in the house, they all start dying in a variety of odd ways which are all lamely presented: Johnny is killed in a convenient tank of piranhas, another's head is found under aluminum foil on a platter in the refrigerator, a couple are killed by electrocution in bed, one is shot through the head, etc. There are additional features such as Carradine making an adult dress up as an organ grinder's monkey, gratuitous ax to the head action (one of the worst special effects ever), ravenous insects, whipping, a servant named Igor, and overacting the likes of which are rarely seen.

The film plods on, and it's obvious how the conclusion will play out about halfway through the film. A special mention goes to the final line of the film addressed directly to the audience ""And I bet you thought it was the butler all the time"" (which would have not been a terrible guess considering he had a lamp he made out of a Nazi's skin). Also of extreme annoyance value is the closing music, which borders on the unlistenable. I gave this film two stars (generously) for the minor, yet hilariously hammy, performance of John Carradine. Truly a master of horror in his day, but an even greater master of overacting when his day had passed.",1221091200,4,1884,4.571005917159764

8129939,2,B000GAKQF8,"Mr Dean (John Carradine) dies and in his will he stipulates his children must stay in his mansion for one week to get a share of the inheritance, children that he had a hate-hate relationship. The film becomes a 10 little Indians with the killer being too obvious.

Bad acting. In one scene a woman is drying off with a towel while wearing a towel. There is a Philadelphia Eagles pennant above the door in one room while another room had a swastika...filmed on Staten Island, go figure.

Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. Some kinky beating, implied incest.",1487289600,,559,4.636363636363637
8129940,1,B000GAKQF8,"So bad, I can't understand how they made it stick to the tape! I LOVE bad horror. But this -- how can it be so sleazy and so boring at the same time?!! Whew. The old ""rich man dies and his heirs have to spend one night in the house to collect money"" set-up would seem foolproof! I've loved every version of ""Ten Little Indians"" I've ever seen. Every time there is a lull in the action, just cut to waves crashing across the beach!  Money in the bank! How do you screw that up?! Well, writer/director auteur Carl Monson managed it! This film is absolutely repellent! I suppose you could call it ""grind-house"". But so boring!!! I fast-forwarded thru at least half the movie & still couldn't finish it. Ugg, the acting. Richard Davalos, the ""young buck"" of a rebellious son who has constant acid-trip delusions of his father (John Carradine) whipping the manservant and other such crap, looks about 45, has an incredibly ugly 1950's greaser hair comb-back (and this is 1971), and he's fat! The doctor (John Smith), although vastly better looking and with much less strange hair, looks like Davalo's older brother! That's kind of weird. With a movie this sleazy a little nudity might've helped. The red-haired younger daughter (Brooke Mills) was insanely hot! The older daughter Victoria (former hollywood starlet Faith Domergue), was still quite milfy. Merry Anders (?) the older brother's wife probably showed the most skin. And although younger (if you believe the bios) than Faith Domergue, she was looking sorta granny-ish by that time. Which I can do without! Actually I can do without the whole thing! The Chauffeur (John Russell from the old TV western lawman), looked like an aging porn star! Why is a chauffeur wearing designer jeans, scarfs and ascots?!!  John Carradine was maybe in 3 minutes of the movie total. Unless he showed up at the very end -- I couldn't finish it! And I'm not discussing Igor. No sir, I won't do it! Anyway, the film quality and flat unimaginative direction looked like a Brady Bunch episode gone wrong, but the DVD transfer was perfect. Hopefully that's the only reason for the good reviews. But I can't stress this enough -- Yuck! Phewy! Stay away!!!!",1465689600,,2187,4.7678100263852246

No exceptions allowed. Those who die before hand, will split up the remaining amount equally.
Yes, this is a budget rated film but worth watching never the less. If you are a beer or wine or other party favor lover, I suggest consuming before/during/and after - to get that full ""Party Spirit!""",1411344000,,576,4.528846153846154
