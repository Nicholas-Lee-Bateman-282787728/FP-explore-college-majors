5130645,4,B0084FINMU,"I found this to be challenging.  However, I used heavy weights.  I felt it all over, but I will say this is a long and somewhat boring workout.  I usually do Jari Love's weight workouts and I find them a bit more interesting.  I would have also liked to have had more leg moves in this one.  Perhaps if the entire dvd just focused on one or two areas of the body it would have been better.  I would still recommend this to add variety to your regular routine.",1361664000,,459,4.101123595505618
5130646,5,B0084FINMU,"I have several other Amy Bento workouts and was excited to see she had put out another weight training DVD.  This is excellent, thorough, and will have you feeling it the next day.  It will provide a challenge for advanced exercisers but can also work for beginners who choose lighter weights. I'm very glad I purchased it.",1355529600,2,323,4.649122807017544
5130647,4,B0084FINMU,"Strength training is my favorite type of exercise and Amy Bento is one of my favorite instructors.  So I was very excited to get this latest offering from Amy.  This is a 90 minute workout that uses a dropset technique, meaning you start with heavier weight /fewer reps and end with light weights/higher reps. (Note:  the DVD jacket says this workout is 60 minutes, but it is 90 minutes.)

Why I enjoyed this workout:

**The fun twist Amy puts on the exercises.  Each set usually has a different twist, e.g. you start pushups on your toes and end on your knees, or do lunges with arms straight with heavy dumbbells and overhead with lighter dumbbells.

**The variety of exercises.  You will be using dumbbells and also your own body weight.  I love mixing it up this way.

**Amy tells us what weight she's using.  This is helpful as a guide.

**Minimal equipment is needed just a few sets of dumbbells, a step and a stability ball.

There were some things I didn't like about this workout, which is why I only gave it 4 stars.

What I didn't like in this workout:

**I personally don't like doing total body workouts and I much prefer doing splits.  The 3 premixes are not that well suited for splits since they repeat body parts.  You could set up your own splits using the DVD Chapters, but this is a pain.

**Each body part was one chapter, rather than each exercise set being one chapter.  This made it hard to repeat an exercise.

**Amy seems to spend a lot of time talking between upper body exercises.  I didn't feel that I was working that intensely that I needed that much down time.  There wasn't much down time during the leg exercises, which I liked better.

**The music wasn't quite as upbeat as in Amy's previous workouts.  I usually love Amy's choice of music since it always matches the workout and helps me exercise more intensely.

If you're looking for a new and different weight workout, you will enjoy this one.",1344556800,7,1932,4.514450867052023
5130648,5,B0084FINMU,Like Amy's no nonsense style.  Workout is effective and specific to each muscle group.  Video is over an hour but did not seem to drag.  I would recommend this dvd to any fitness level.  Just need to use heavier weights if you are more athletic!,1343520000,,245,4.377777777777778

8525078,5,B0084FINMU,"I loved this workout. I put off doing it because I am doing Body Beast but today I thought I would do this light little workout then do a Beast.  Ha!!  The package says it is 60 minutes but it is actually 90. It said you need three sets of weights and usually the women's videos use 3, 5 and 8. Ha again!  Her first exercise had her using 20 lb weights!!  She went lighter through the progressions but still much heavier than I expected.  The lightest she used was 5 lb.  If I hadn't been doing Body Beast the last month I never would have dared following her weights. Towards the end I had to lighten up a bit on the heaviest sets.  I was working incredibly hard through this video. I am curious on how I'll feel in the morning. My husband commented on the fact that Amy looks like a real person which is a nice change from the super skinny or super muscular models some videos have. She even had a tiny tummy!!  I highly recommend this workout. I'm sure it would be effective for beginners starting at lighter weights but I was thrilled to be able to follow her weight suggestions through (most) of the video. I was cursing her and begging for death which to me is the sign of a great workout.  When I was done I was exhilarated and exhausted!",1428105600,,1245,4.197478991596639
8525079,4,B0084FINMU,"This is a good weightlifting DVD.  Challenging with lots of pre-mixed options.  Downside is the requirement not only for a lot of weight sizes but a full size step.  I do it without the step but some exercises are less effective.  Amy is competent, easy to follow.  Not a lot of bells and whistles but a good solid workout.",1399680000,,323,4.406779661016949
8525080,4,B0084FINMU,"This workout is just what I was looking for to increase strength, and I am very happy with it overall.  It is important to understand what you're getting and what equipment you need, so I'm hoping this review will supplement the product description to help you decide if it's right for you.

The Workout Itself
What I wanted was weight training to make me stronger, and this is exactly what I was hoping for.  You will get challenging reps that target muscle groups for the whole body.  If you are looking for a more choreographed routine like a lot of toning videos, then this will not be for you.  I find toning routines are not as good at building strength and move through positions too quickly to focus on proper form.  This video is simple in it's routine, but you can focus on form and challenge yourself.

The whole video is 90 minutes, with 9 chapters that are approximately 10 minutes each.
- Warm Up (a shorter routine) - Legs (the longest routine) - Chest - Back - Shoulders - Biceps - Triceps - Core - Stretch

As another helpful reviewer said, customizing which chapters you use in a given workout is not that easy.  This is really my main criticism of the video and why I didn't give it 5 stars.  I have another Amy Bento video from the 10 Minute Solutions series that allows you to customize which segments you do and in which order, hit play and you have exactly what you want.  I really wish this one worked the same way.  The 3 premixes that are in the DVD menu are all about an hour or longer.  What I really like to do is 20-40 minutes at a time.  In order to do this, you have to play one chapter, then stop the video, go back to the chapters menu and select your next segment, which is a little annoying.

The Equipment you Need
I think the product description is a little too vague in telling you what you'll need.  They say 3 weights and an optional mat and stability ball.  They don't even mention that she uses a step bench (I have to thank the other reviewer for letting me know).  Hopefully I can shed some more light on what you really need and what ""optional"" means.

- Weights
Each exercise uses 3 weights, but she actually has a selection of 5 to better work with the varied difficulty.  Her weights: 5, 8, 10, 15, 20.  Please note that she is strong, much stronger than me (at least until this video does its job).  I can't imagine using 15s or 20s for any of these exercises.  Initially, I had just 5s and 10s to work with.  I found it hard to work with only two choices and since purchased some 2lb wrist weights to help me scale better.  Now I can work with 5 choices as well: 2, 5, 7, 10, 12 and it has made all the difference.  Wrist weights aren't ideal, but it was cheaper than buying a bunch of new dumbbells.  Plan accordingly before you begin this workout to make sure you have choices to avoid straining yourself.

- Step Bench
They should really mention this in the product description because so many of the exercises use it.  I don't have a step bench but use 2 cube ottomans as a bench, which seems to work well.  Make sure you have something on hand that can be used as a stand-in if you don't have one.  I recommend watching a clip video of the workout on YouTube (there's one that's 5 minutes long) where you can see all of the ways she uses the bench to make sure you have something that will work.

- Mat
I suppose this is actually optional.  If you have a hard floor, it would be nice but not essential.

- Stability Ball
This is used in the Stretch segment.  They say it is optional, but she doesn't seem to regard it as such.  There is no mention of alternate positions without a ball.  I try to use my cube ottomans or a yoga brick as substitutes, but that only works okay.  The balance aspect of a ball and laying your back over a ball are hard to replicate.  This is my other criticism of the video.  They should either say the ball is required, or if it is optional, have her explain how to do the stretch without it.

The Instructor
Amy Bento is one of my favorites for video instruction.  Netflix used to have many options for streaming workouts, so I was able to try a lot of different ones at the time.  Amy is very natural on camera and most closely simulates a class environment.  She's NOT bubbly, annoying or intense; she IS professional and has clear instruction.

Hope this helps!",1397174400,10,4351,4.27172582619339
8525081,2,B0084FINMU,"Not a great workout, and not a fan of the instructor.  There are much better options out there.  I would explore those before purchasing this.",1394582400,,142,4.64
8525082,4,B0084FINMU,I really like Amy's workouts.  This is a full body total workout.  My only drawback is that it is an hour & twenty minutes.  She does each exercise slowly & suggests which weights to use.  Amy is a great instructor.,1382140800,,215,4.3
8525083,3,B0084FINMU,"Basic,boring weight work. They should have invested in a nice set and some good sound to make this workout more appealing to do. As it is, it is just Amy on a cheap stark set doing sets of basic weight training. It will be a dust collector unfortunately.",1369526400,2,254,4.3125
