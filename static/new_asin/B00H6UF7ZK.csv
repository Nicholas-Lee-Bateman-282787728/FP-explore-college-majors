8630353,1,B00H6UF7ZK,"I'm a fan of steampunk. Almost all kinds of steampunk. So a well-executed steampunk retelling of Sherlock Holmes is something that I would normally look forward to...

... unless it was from the Asylum, peddlers of cash-in abominations like ""Transmorphers"" and ""Almighty Thor."" Yeah, I made a noise like a strangled squeaky toy when I saw that.

So guess what kind of quality you get in ""Sherlock Holmes,"" which tries to spice up the canonical Holmes mythos with a ""lost"" tale of robots, dinosaurs, dragons and a giant octopus. The ridiculous sci-fi elements might have actually been entertaining if the acting weren't wretched, the story weren't as holey as moth-eaten lace, and it had a decent Sherlock.

The story is told by a dying Watson during the Blitz: strange animals like a giant octopus and a very small T-rex are popping up around England, and Holmes decides that they must be artificial (since the T-rex stole mechanical components). Somehow this ends up leading them to the Victorian urban legend Spring-Heeled Jack, a person very close to Holmes whose revenge scheme may destroy all of London.

""Sherlock Holmes"" is painful to watch, all the more so because it actually could have been fun in a stupid way if a FEW things had been done right. The entire premise is a ridiculous hodgepodge of everything the Asylum thought would be ""cool"" -- monsters, robots, Spring-Heeled Jack, and a steampunk ""Iron Man."" And, well, it could have been fun.

Buuuuuttt.... they do everything spectacularly wrong. The direction and cinematography are pretty clumsy and sometimes amateurish, the comic relief is PAINFUL, and the story is brain-meltingly stupid (so... Holmes somehow kept the entire story a closely-guarded secret, even though it involves ships, factories and PARLIAMENT being destroyed by robot monsters?!). And since this is the Asylum, the monsters are about as convincing as Chinese street dragons, but less fun to watch.

But the biggest problem by far is Ben Syder. Who is Ben Syder? Well, you probably have never heard of him, because this is his first, last and only role in ANYTHING. And I can't imagine a LESS convincing Sherlock Holmes. Syder is short, weedy, thin-voiced, hyperactive and completely lacking in charisma, like an annoying cousin who keeps dragging you into bad situations.

For some reason, Dominic Keating and Gareth David Lloyd -- both of whom have been in other movies and TV -- are stuck as the perpetually exasperated Watson, and the sleek Thorpe Holmes (yes, a Holmes brother we never heard of). Both look pretty miserable, and neither really tries that hard.

This ""Sherlock Holmes"" movie is probably the only one in existence that makes Guy Ritchie's look subtle and faithful to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's writings. It could have been fun steampunk schlock, but is too pitifully inept to manage it.",1409011200,,2844,5.023354564755839
