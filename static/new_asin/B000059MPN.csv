1407018,5,B000059MPN,"For fans of Helen Hannah, the heroine of the Apocalypse films, there is both good news and bad news! The good news is she is still alive. The bad news is she is to be put on trial by a kangaroo court for ""hatred of humanity"". The prosecutor is the evil Victoria Thorne who wants to see Helen dead and thus has rigged the trial to find her guilty. The defence is Victoria's ex-boyfriend, Mitch Kendrick, a tormented alcoholic filled with guilt and grief over the death of his father - a Christian who refused to renounce his faith and paid for it with his life. Mitch is frustrated by Helen's similiar refusal to renounce her Lord and save her life. In desperation he decides to put God Himself on trial for ""crimes against humanity"". As the truth comes out Mitch has a decision to make that will decide the fate of an innocent woman but will cost him dearly no matter what he does. Will he do the right thing? This film should appeal to lovers of courtroom dramas.  It answers some of the questions nonbelievers frequently ask Christians and thus helps us provide answers for the hope we have in Christ.  You might need a box of tissues handy for the ending as well!",1021334400,,1166,4.393518518518518
1407019,4,B000059MPN,"I enjoyed this 4th installment of the Apocalypse series. It shows a little more character depth than in the previous movies. It also has a wonderful story that can show that God can truly change a man's heart.
In this movie, the Anti-Christ played by Nick Mancuso uses the law to sway more people to follow Satan. While the defense attorney play by Corbin Bernstein deals with his own conumdrum sitting on the fense between God and the Anti-Christ while defending a Christian in court for nothing more than being a Christian. It is a powerful interpretation of the possible events to come in the End of Days.",1005436800,6,608,4.638888888888889

1407021,5,B000059MPN,This movie will thrill you as it gives you a message that could very well change your life. The plot disputes the reality of Jesus being GOD.The movie then gives real evidence to prove the resurrection of Jesus is historical fact.(Proof by Simon Greenleaf-expert lawyer on  valid evidence} - The best movie yet of the Apocalypse movie series!

1407022,5,B000059MPN,"THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!!!!  L.A. Law Meets Left Behind meets The A-Team -- that's what this movie is.  Helen Hannah is back, and I wondered how she'd be alive in this one when that ol buzzard Macalousso killed her off in Tribulation.  I thought she was dead.  Well, as he says, ""So did she.""  I don't see how Nick Mancuso changes his voice for each of these films but he does a good job of it too.  And he was brilliant this time, as before, and a lot more subtle, so subtle I'd almost be convinced that he was genuine!  He's a subtle one.  The character Mitch Kendrick -- I could identify with him in many ways, especially his hatred of God and his wanting proof that God exists.  Corbin Bernsen was great.  And Vicki Thorne's hatred of all things Christian is so vehement she makes an ... of herself at times, even objecting to her own cross (which is almost funny).  I mean, you can just feel her anger and hatred.  And they call Christians Haters?  It was good to see Willie Spino again, and I swear the bloke carried himself -- man was he Mr Cool or what!  Never mind that he was on the enemy's side.  The film had a cool subplot, and boy was Mr T cool in it.  It was a role he was born to play and it brought to mind B.A. Baracus.  I swear the Lalonde brothers must be big A-Team fans, because the attempted rescue of Helen Hannah was done A-Team style.  And even here Mr T calls people ""fools,"" as is his forte.  I loved this movie and I watch it every chance I get.  As Mr T would say, I pity the poor fools who trash this movie!  The subplot brings to mind a verse in Revelation 13 which talks about how ""he that kills with the sword must be killed with the sword.""  Peter and Paul Lalonde must've had that in mind.  If you like courtroom dramas and thrillers you gotta see Judgment.",990576000,4,1787,4.145772594752186
1407023,4,B000059MPN,"This film has had a lot of negative feedback in newspapers and magazines but it is actually very good.  I watched this movie after watching the previous 3 Apocalypse movies and it made complete sense.  The Christians in this movie are suffering and are being persecuted because they are living in the endtimes as prophecied in the Bible.  They weren't Christian's when the Rapture happened and became Christian's after the glorious event.  I think it brilliantly portrays faith conquering fear and persecution.  Not to be taken too seriously I think this film is full of wonderful insights and answers to many of the worlds questions re: the Christian faith and more importantly Jesus himself.  It sickens me when I read people who believe that when you become a Christian it's gonna be a piece of cake from then on... kind of like a get out of jail card.  I'm not saying that we have to pay for our sins or suffer to be saved or get into heaven, to have these two gifts one must have faith in Jesus, but suffering, fear, persecution, strife, poverty, hate and even death is something that our brothers and sisters in Christ suffer daily all over the world, whilst we sit in our comfort zones.  In short, a brilliant movie that touches on many great subjects, and oh yeah!!! it stars MR.T.  A must have for anyone into the endtime message.  Cloud Ten Pictures... more please.",989625600,14,1375,4.644628099173554
1407024,1,B000059MPN,"Some movies are so bad that it is hard to put into words. You wonder how anyone could take part in the movie or allow it to be made. How could they release something like this. The story, well there is no story. The acting is bad, well there was no acting. If God loved us he would protect us from something like this. If there is a God I would hate to have anything to do with this movie and have to face him. I saw some good reviews of this movie here on Amazon. Com. I saw two people gave it 5 stars. I understand that people like different things but my God. I suspect that there are people out there will like any film that puts forward faith in God. If you believe in paying for your sins before you face God, if you think suffering will ease your way into heaven then watch this movie. There are a lot of great films about God, faith and religion out there please do not put yourself thur hell by watching this one. God have mercy on us.",987724800,6,944,4.0

1407111,3,B000059MPN,"Just give up on any movie ever being even remotely like the Bible;  for example, Bible NEVER SAYS that when the Rapture happens, millions of people will just disappear.  Instead, Paul laid out a 'time map' for Church in Ephesians 1:3-14's Greek which is so grim, the picture at the end is that there are few Christians left, when Rapture happens: a kind of winter of discontent, in Eph 1:13-14.  So it happens, because no one will believe, anymore.  I've been documenting how you can prove all that since 2010, see my vimeo paulmeterggs11 channel and watch the videos in order: they go through the Greek text and the FUTURE HISTORY (relative to AD 58) until Odovacer.  For by then, Church is so stagnant, believers are few.  That was back in AD 476!  All the NT books are on the same subject, too, 'tagging' the Ephesians timeline with additions (most notably, in 1 John and Revelation).  Been doing videos showing that, and have only just started proving the text.

UPSHOT: Bible's own version, is that almost no one is left, to Rapture (not like English, 'rapto' in Latin means to SNATCH UP VIOLENTLY, translating the original Greek verb harpazw in 1Thess 4:17, one of the better-known Rapture verses).  Instead, Revelation 11 says that on the first day of the Tribulation, two JEWS show up at Temple to protect the Holy of Holies from anyone entering, with the power to withhold rain, throw fire, all that stuff no one ever believes.  THEY announce what happened, along with an angel flying at high noon.  John writes Revelation following Aristotle's Poetics, so creates what back then would be called a quadrilogy, three tragedies and an ending comedy (as in happy ending, not haha).  So the Greek readers understood him well.  We stopped teaching our kids to read Greek of Bible within 100 years of Revelation's writing (back in AD 88 per John's own dateline in the book).  So we do NOT know how to read it.  So all our Bible movies about 'the Apocalypse' are completely wrong.

So if you want to make a good story everyone will disbelieve anyway, then pick the Real Bible's Real Story.  Not, this junk.

Even so: if you ignore the fact that this movie -- like every other Bible movie ever made, just repeats Bible words, and in reality has little to do with Bible -- if you ignore all that, you'll find this movie thought-provoking at a basic level:  does God exist?  If the God of the Bible were true, and if mankind was sick of Him 'not showing up', what would the world want instead?

The entire Apocalypse series is amateurishly shot (cameraman maybe was badly directed), middling to great acting, hackneyed script.  Left Behind should be left behind in the trash, for the writers wouldn't know Bible if it bit them;  and, for the most part, so should this series: but the acting is worth watching.  The actors did well with the poor material they had.

Judgment itself, is a bit better than the rest of the series, as it aims to also be an amalgam of two very good shorts:  Twilight Zone Season 2 Episode 29 'Obsolete Man' (which Prime members can watch for free online, Amazon Instant Video) and another great oldie starring Vincent Price as the Devil, called 'The Story of Mankind'.  You'll notice that the main 'stage' in this movie, 'Judgment', is about the same.  So kudos to the writers or director for at least nodding to those other two movies.  Much of the bad script can be forgiven, as it too is like those oldies.

Able acting all around, and thank God this time Nick (hahaha nickname for The Devil) Mancuso didn't go over the top with his acting (and maybe he was directed to be so goofball in the rest of the series, so just did his job).  So it's worthwhile to watch THIS film.  The others are too childish and anti-Biblical to be of much use.

Bible's story, however, is actually quite political, as Bible is always persona non-grata even as God and the Jews always are: which of course begs the question, why THEM more than all other religious claims and ideas and books?  Aha.  So maybe this is the right story the actual truth? But it's not a nice or comfortable story, and if the truth, it's one any sane person would want to disbelieve, every day.

No Christian can tell the story rightly, and as a Bible addict who makes videos on the Greek and Hebrew (in vimeo), I'm not sure I can either: for it takes YEARS of understanding the real Bible, to even know what the story.. is.  You can know the story, but telling it rightly is another kettle of fish.  Essentially, God lets you decide if you want Him or not, but if you do, then you have to understand that He's Righteous and you are not, so BELIEVE HIS SON PAID FOR YOUR SINS and you are forever saved from hell, when you die.

What recommends this movie is that in the mouth of Corbin Bernsen, that last sentence was made clear.  First Bible movie I've ever seen which actually repeated the Gospel, correctly.  Hence 3 stars, minimum.

Okay, but what about your life down here?  Seems like God doesn't get involved or care.  That's not true, but you don't know that.  Sooner or later, it should occur to you.. to ASK the ceiling, as it were: and that's when the answers begin.  You are to learn this old book (great lines about 'old book' in the movie), and it seems utterly irrelevant to your current life.  Just the opposite is true, but you won't know that until you've spent a decade or more learning that Book.

So then, the premise of this movie, is quite apt:  WHERE IS GOD?  If He really exists, really paid for your sins, WHY WON'T HE SHOW UP?  Yeah, good question.  And that, dears, is the heart of this movie.  It never answers the question, either.  People ask the question daily, too: complaining.  So, they don't get answers.  We Christians have answers no one wants.  And we don't know the answers any too well, as we like everyone else, don't really ASK as we should.

So maybe watch the movie just to see the QUESTION, and then maybe ask yourself if you too want the answer.  If not, then not.  But there are consequences.  You know what they are.",1427155200,,6050,4.514732965009208

I mean it's about a lawyer, who is not even trying to defend his client, and is also trying to commit suicide. Now everything is well o.k. I guess, but there really is no excitment to any of this whatsoever. All this movie is trying to do is help people get close with God. First of all, I got no problem with that. However, I did have a problem with the acting. The actor protraying Satan really did a very poor job at it, as well as everybody else. I mean it was like watching a day time soap oprea. If you really want to watch a christian film, see ""Passion of the Christ"" now there's really talent right there. Not too dramatic, not too sloppy of writing.",1219708800,3,797,4.181818181818182

Helen Hannah was saved from execution by the antichrist himself so he could humiliate her and show the world what happends to those who follow God.

Will her lawyer come to Jesus or accept the mark of the beast?",1194220800,,527,4.777777777777778
1407166,4,B000059MPN,"This movie is the fourth installment of the 'Apocalypse' series of movies. This movie does not require that the previous movies be watched. But it does start exactly where the third one left of and then jumps a few months forward. This movie is a courtroom drama that happens to have a small subplot of action thrown in. I think this subplot was written in order to give Mr. T something to do.

It is the end times foretold in the Biblical book of Revelation. The Antichrist, Franco Macalusso, has most of the world bearing his mark. Helen Hannah, arrested for her Christianity in ""Tribulation"", is being put on trial in the O.N.E. court of justice. Councilor Mitch Kendrick (whose father, Seth, was an executed hater he defended) is irritated to find, not only that his ex-lover Vicky will be the prosecutor but, like in his father's trial, the whole thing will be fake. Meanwhile, Helen's band of believers want to rescue her, but J.T. Quincy, husband of Selma Davis' daughter, Sherry, wants to use violence to do it. Meanwhile, Helen soon learns that the mark of the beast on Mitch's hand is a black market forgery.

The production value of this movie is the highest of all the four and the courtroom script is good. All of the actors involved in the courtroom do a wonderful job of acting. Bringing their characters to life. And the scenes appeared to be shot in real sets. Looks like they are doubling their budget to make higher quality movies. Watch the movie for the trial.",1190937600,2,1481,4.6273764258555135

Mr. T is da bomb.

I beg pardon? Oh yeah. Colorfuller. Um ... I just made that word up, Your Honor, because I'm trying to express how Mr. T made -- I said MADE -- this movie for me ... Ya dig?",1160092800,3,484,3.9587628865979383
1407168,3,B000059MPN,"I thought the movie had a good storyline, and the actors did their jobs well (although Mr. T had a stereotypical Mr. T performance).

The one thing that really puzzles me is this : The movie claims to be a Christian film, however Mitch (played by Corbin Bernsen) wears a fake mark of the beast on his right hand, and he comes out in the  movie as the ""hero"". The Bible clearly states that anybody who takes the mark of the beast will go to Hell. My belief is that in God's eyes, wearing a fake mark of the beast would be no different than wearing the real thing.

Plus, there are some continuity errors in this film as it relates to the whole ""Apocalypse"" series. In the 2nd film (""Revelations"") and 3rd film (""Tribulation""), the mark of the beast is presented as a 666 burnt into people's hands by Franco Macalousso by way of the ""image of the beast"" virtual reality helmet (thankfully the hokey VR helmet concept did not make it to ""Judgement""). In ""Judgement"", the mark is represented as a different design.

The film is entertaining, but I find the whole ""hero who has a fake mark of the beast is still a hero at the end"" angle to be rather unsettling.",1154131200,4,1156,4.362790697674418

1407170,2,B000059MPN,"Comparing this movie to the previous three APOCALYPSE series movies, this one seemed to drag its heels like the court case.  Jessica Steen made Victoria Thorne a really unlikeable character that you wished you could see her final fate as a lawyer who sold herself to the devil.  (Of course, if you have the DVD, you could see one of the deleted scenes where Franco Maccalusso does send her and the judge, though both of them barely seen, to their final fates -- a scene I wish could have been in the main cut.)  Corben Bernsen's character struggles under both hiding out as a uncommitted person bearing a fake ""mark of the beast"" to avoid death on either side of the battle of the ages, and with the manipulation he seems to be getting from both his former lover and the various One World Nation agents that he comes across throughout the whole thing.  Mr. T's character is basically Mr. T sounding like he's trying to do evangelism in his typical B.A. Barracas style of personality.  Overall, it's too bad that this had to be the last movie of the series, leaving things that started out in Apocalypse eternally unresolved -- imagine the LEFT BEHIND series never reaching the 12th book Glorious Appearing to get the idea.",1139097600,2,1222,4.612903225806452
1407181,5,B000059MPN,"I have read the book before watching the movie. The book scared me LOL. I have recommended this movie to several of my friends the conception is really great. I don't like the way Jessica Steen looks, she looks like she's really against God. But she deserves a chance to prove herself as well as we do. Satan is full of lies as usual. He turns things around and blames God, when he knows he's fully responsible. If that had been me in the courtroom, I would have not even looked at him, neither listen to one word he had to say. A good thing about being deaf! :)

I don't care what others say...this movie was great. The best of the 4 Left Behind series. I don't think they could provide more because they saved the best for last. Hopefully more people will become saved by watching this movie. Too bad none of the actors unless Mr. T? got saved. None of them are even close to even understanding God! A true pity.

I thought they could have done more with that movie, but this movie, Judgement, I actually enjoyed it.  There were a few violent scenes, but not anything full of gore.  Just boom and they're dead, one explosion.  No foul language.  My copy said it wasn't rated, but Amazon.com labels this movie as PG-13, which I thought was appropriate.  It's not something I'd want my 2 year old watching, but wouldn't be horrified if he woke up from a nap and saw a scene or two.

  I'd recommend this movie.  This was apparently a sequel. I didn't know it when I bought it and followed along fine without seeing the first movie.",1103500800,5,788,4.557142857142857
1407183,5,B000059MPN,"I was so happy to find out that our heroine of the Apocalypse series, the only person, besides the antichrist, to survive through the whole series without dying, was back and that she hadn't been guillotined after all. But that slice of life goes much deeper than the antichrist had planned.

A great installment to the Apocalypse series. The other three starring great underrated actors like Richard Nester (Apocalypse) Jeff Fahey (Revelation) and Gary Busey (Tribulation) which have all done good enough to continue me on through the series. The best out of these three being Revelation, but they are all good and must sees. Take it from a Christian, these are just as inspiring as God himself for the fact that they were made by Christians helps me to believe they were made for a good purpose.

After a mis-execution, Helen Hannah (Gorgeous and a great first time actress, Leigh Lewis) has returned to the Tribulation under the mercy of Antichrist Franco Macalousso. After enduring two years of the tribulation, Macalousso decides he might as well make use of Helens existence, and salavage more of the world than before. After all, Satan won't be satisfied until he has everyone under his wing.

As for Helen, still as devoted to God as ever, she is put under a scripted trial with a skeptical lawyer (Corbin Bernsen) who does nothing for her until he realizes she really is innocent. Under O.N.E's power, the prosecuter, a very stubborn and selfish woman (Jessica Steen) will do anything to get Helen Hannah the highest punishment in crime. But little do any of them know that they're all doing the opposite of what was really intended by them in the first place.

Great. Nothing else really to describe it except great. You know, besides Helen, my other favorite character in the Apocalypse series who started appearing in Revelation is Selma Davis, Helens loyal friend and devoted Christian played by wonderful Marium Carvell. It's strange, whenever movies like this come out, even though the acting done by the known actors is good too, the best acting always comes from the unknown actors and actresses. A good example is Leigh Lewis and Marium Carvell. They should really get discovered after doing four films yet they haven't. Maybe God has other intentions for them.",1095379200,5,2279,4.896373056994818
1407184,4,B000059MPN,"It's an end-times movie, at least, it qualifies as one. There's the antichrist(portrayed by Nick Mancuso on par with left behind's Gordon Curie), there's the Christian Minority,and then, there's the rest of the gullible world. Although, it doesn't exactly stick to the biblical endtimes, it projects the same message, the man of sin rules the world for a period, therefore this is an entirely feasible plotline. You also have the person who is on the fence and who witnesses the miracle of faith(Corbin Bensen).

1407185,5,B000059MPN,"Judgement, another film by Cloud Ten picture, continues the story of Helen Hannah and her band of freedom fighters and their battle against anti-christ. This one also stars Corbin Benson and Mr T!!
The christians, who are labelled as haters, are set-up by the ungodly government of the time as being terrorists and are tried in court for their hate-crimes. The trial soon takes a turn when the anti-christ decides to put God on trial! The film then becomes a court room drama and is very interesting to watch.
What really strikes me about this movie is the way the christians are labelled as ""haters"" and how this resembles the world we live in today. In my country there is currently a court case in progress where some ministers are being labelled as ""haters"" because they are preaching the gospel and managed to offend some people. This is only happening because of a ""religious tolerance law"" that has been passed here of recent times. It seems that tolerance only goes one way though, be tolerant of all religions except christianity is the order of the day. We don't have to wait for an anti-christ governmment, it's on our doorstep already.

1407186,4,B000059MPN,"As we find ourselves tumbling into an upside-down world, where misinformation is ""news"" and truth is in scarce supply, this is a thought-provoking film, well acted and scripted, with a few action scenes thrown in for good measure.
It is a B movie with A+ entertainment value, and doesn't leave you with that ""why did I waste my time on that dribble"" feeling afterwards.
Some of the acting is exceptional; Leigh Lewis is excellent as Helen Hannah, who is jailed for ""crimes"" she did not commit, and Nick Mancuso is marvelous as the slithery and suave Anti-Christ, Franco Macalousso, ruler of the ultimate tyranny, a one-world government, who with his velvety-voiced delivery says the qualities he admires in a man are ""self-centeredness, self-pity, pride and vengefulness"".
Corbin Bernsen is convincing as the defense attorney, who has to decide which master he will serve, and get off the fence he has been sitting on all of his empty life, with a bottle for comfort.
Throroughly enjoyable is Mr. T, as a man who realizes that one has to confront the wicked, at whatever cost (""all is takes for evil to prosper is for good people to do nothin'""). Though not a ""master actor"", his charisma fills the screen when he's on camera.
With a fine score by Gary Koftinoff, and well-paced direction by Andre van Heerden, who also co-wrote the clever script with Peter and Paul Lalonde, this is a low-buget film that gives us viewing value, with something to think about while we watch.

1407187,4,B000059MPN,"""God vs. Man"" is the basic premise of this story. Set in the near future, humanity has experienced a devestating incident--millions of people suddenly disappeared worldwide. The chaos that follows unites the nations under a global government led by Nick Mancouso.
The government line is that those who disappeared were reactionary religionists who served to retard humanity's evolution toward spiritual unity and enlightenment. Anti-government rebels claim that the global leader is the biblical anti-Christ of the New Testament book of Revelation, and that those who disappeared were Christians, whom God had taken up to heaven, just prior to a period of great judgment.
Accusations are tossed back and forth, and ultimately Helen Hannah, the leader of the rebels, is captured and put on trial for treason against humanity. However, her defense attorney says Hannah is not to blame--that she is a deluded follower of God--and that it is God who should be on trial.
The dialogue and plot are much crisper than previous ones in this series. The attorneys are passionate, yet cool and persuasive. The protaganist is both vulnerable and resolute--a powerfully nuanced combination that is most believable.
A subplot, in which those in the rebel camp argue over how much violence they can use for their cause, proved a messier storyline. It might have helped the overall product to drop this element, and enhance the main battle a bit more.
Overall, this was an excellent product--the most professional of the set.",1036886400,16,1509,5.2139917695473255
