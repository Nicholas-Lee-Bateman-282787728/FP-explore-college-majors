2961123,5,B000W2C29S,"Pascale Ferran's LADY CHATTERLEY is an exquisitely wrought film. The themes of the Lawrence novel frame the film, but Ferran seems to have put together her own very contemporary treatment despite the literary and time period setting. The photography is breathtaking and is integral to my characterization of the film as ""exquisitely wrought."" The first part of the film moves very, very slowly with almost no dialogue as the luxurious expanses of the country landscape are defined along with the formal and aristocratic settings of the Wragby estate. The obsession, both photographically and from a time duration standpoint, with the landscape serves a significant two-fold purpose---establishing Nature as a primary element in this world and reinforcing the beauty/sensuality of that Nature. That becomes a critical underpinning to the orchestration to the unfolding of the very sensual and sexual relationship of Constance and the Gamekeeper Parkin. If there was a weakness in the film, it would be the concluding section of the film which seemed more simply a patchwork of ideas and actions and not the carefully orchestrated ever increasingly complex visual and thematic development of the first half to two-thirds. However, the ending left everything up in the air as concerns the future of their relationship which I thought was a masterful stroke. There was no smug Hollywood resolution in either direction nor did Ferran give it a particularly French ""affaire de passion"" resolution. The ending seemed very realistic and ""now"" and in that sense probably departs from Lawrence in the most dramatic way. This is a must see film!",1191801600,50,1634,5.288461538461538
2961124,4,B000W2C29S,"A very beautiful interpretation, with a slow, emotionally honest exposition.  Makes one feel as though looking at Lawrence's novel quite afresh, without all its encrusted history of sweaty-palm controversies.  It is situated very convincingly in its era (1920s), at a point of openiing up against the sexual restrictions of its class, society and period.  It shows the slow discovery of the possibilities of reaching for sexual passion and physical satisfaction - especially for the woman (after all, the title of the movie is: ""Lady Chatterley"", without the ""lover"" of the book.).  This is done without any prudish voyeuristic clichs, or romanticized imageries, yet, at the same time, fully engaging with all the power of sex and sensuality, and not avoiding looking at man's and woman's nudity.  The acting is wonderfully restrained and subtle, mostly through looks, gestures, and the characters' postures and movements.",1191024000,38,922,5.419580419580419
2961125,1,B000W2C29S,"This movie is THE worst movie I ever had to sit through. It's horribly long, boring as hell, the story goes nowhere.

2961203,5,B000W2C29S,"Quite superb. Lawrence's works do not easily lend themselves to the screen because so much of their value lies in his dense and poetic prose, as others here have pointed out. However, this film comes closest to capturing the essence of his message and perhaps even outdoes him in some respects, as the characters in this film are so such real and believable people, rather than literary symbols with impossibly rich and sensitive inner lives. It is indeed very long and exceedingly slow, by Hollywood standards, but it is never less than engrossing. Obviously, sex and sensuality and what they mean in human lives are at the heart of the story, so the film necessarily includes some nudity and non-explicit sex. One or two reviewers have implied that it could have been made without showing either, but then it would have not been Lady Chatterley. (The film is based on John Thomas and Lady Jane, an earlier version of Lawrence's better-known novel, Lady Chatterley's Lover.) In fact, the sex scenes could have been substantially more graphic without detracting one whit from the movie's considerable dramatic merits and might well have enhanced them, considering the source material. However, that might still be a step too far for most mainstream audiences. Finally, the performances are all good, but Marina Hands' is quite outstanding - never less than transparent, fluid, and utterly authentic. She is in virtually every scene and carried the film in a way that few, if any, other actors could. Jean-Louis Coulloc'h, as Parkin the gamekeeper, is monosyllabic until the very last few minutes, in which he suddenly reveals a depth of character and feeling that had scarcely been hinted at in the rest of the film.

2961273,5,B000W2C29S,"I grew up during the 1940s-50s in a small town in eastern North Carolina. When, as a young adult, I heard discussions about LADY CHATTERLY'S LOVER (the book), comments ranged from scandalous to unfit to read, to ""delightfully freeing."" Admittedly, though a man (but of a sensitive nature), I did read portions of the novel and was then able to discuss my feelings with female friends and a few other men who, like me, found the book interesting and enlightening.

While watching the movie, I was made to feel a tenderness I have not often felt for a film. Realizing that conventional morality does not accept the relationship of the two principals in the film, I also understand their longing and their meeting of the minds, hearts, and bodies.

At the conclusion of the film, I felt somehow cheated; for I had expected a more realistic resolutioneven one that would defy moral convictions (Chatterly's husband could not be blamed for much, and appears to have given great latitude of behavior to her). Lady Chatterly and her lover did not ""ride into the sunset, to be happy ever after,"" but there seemed to have been an understanding that was both convenient and heartwarming.

In a word, I would call this film ""sweet."" Even the nudity did not come across as salacious or sinful, nor did the physical actions and interactions of Lady Chatterly and the gamekeeper. I highly recommend this film! Although it is quite mild by today's standards, the story depicted is heartwarming and affecting. I was left not totally satisfied, but nevertheless very glad to have watched! Take time on an easy afternoon to enjoy this film. Noel Thomas Manning",1411171200,,1642,4.8362989323843415

Pretty but dissatisfied Lady Chatterley, married to an invalid of WW1, has her passions aroused when she comes upon the gamekeeper having a wash. My main objection was that said gamekeeper (here named Parkin instead of the original Mellors) was not the sex-god I had envisioned, but an older, and seriously taciturn - even curmudgeonly - character.
But I was soon captivated by their increasingly romantic assignations in the hut, or before the fire in Parkin's cottage. The scenery is beautiful, and the passion builds, from an initial quick encounter to hours full of love.
I loved the way the director filmed Lady Chatterley's holiday on the Riviera with her family in grainy footage, making it seem unreal to her, as against the bright clear colours of life on the estate.

2961312,1,B000W2C29S,"I didn't finish watching this movie. I tried, and I kept getting distracted and leaving. It was boring. It is a European film, which means you are supposed to ""contemplate the full silences"" or some such bs. I read the book under the bed by the window of a spare bedroom when I was about 5 or 6 years old, much to the consternation of my mother who didn't know I could even read beyond ""See spot run"". It was on ""the list"" in high school, but I wasn't interested enough to revisit, since it wasn't anything forbidden to me by then. I remember everyone else running around giggling at all the ""descriptions"" and all the dirty words they wanted to use to shock their friends. If this movie got ""racy"" later on, I don't believe I could stomach it, due to the stodginess of those presumably involved. Rather an unlovely film in my estimation, but then maybe as an American I am more used to more epic offerings such as Gone With the Wind, which I saw about the same year I was reading Lady Chatterly  under the bed :-).

From the movie its not clear why main characteres were attracted to each other, after all logic and motivation still exist. Attraction was not really strong or anything and men were past their prime time to be impulsive.
Its kinda like we have periods in moviemaking where mainstream lost its steam about 1970th, and then found action as main idea and then I stopped watching
official TV and switched to independent like Troma or soft core and sometimes to further down all to find gems in a garbage.

2961323,4,B000W2C29S,"""Lady Chatterley"" is a tale of repression, lust and sexual liberation set in post-World War I France. Despite its title, the movie isn't an adaptation of ""Lady Chatterley's Lover,"" the taboo-shattering D.H. Lawrence novel that scandalized the world when it was published in 1928. The film is actually based on a Lawrence work entitled ""John Thomas and Lady Jane"" that came out the previous year.  But the theme and storyline are just about as erotic and provocative as what we find in its more famous successor.

This version features Marina Hands as the beautiful young wife of an aristocratic mine owner who's been rendered wheelchair-bound and impotent by injuries he sustained on the battlefield. Deprived of sex, Constance begins to fantasize about the husky gamekeeper who lives in the woods on the estate, and it's not long before the two of them have consummated their relationship.  Jean Louis Coulloc'h is a particularly interesting casting choice as Parkin, for his scrappy features, thinning hair, linebacker's build and non-matinee-idol looks remove the story from the realm of dime-novel romance and into the arena of sheer physical attraction and lust.  At least for awhile, that is, until the almost inevitable rush of feelings begins to overtake the couple, and the harsh realities of sexual mores, marital bonds and class distinctions that so define the era in which they live begin to make themselves felt.

Co-written by Roger Bohbot and director Pascale Ferran, the movie is long (two-hours-and-forty-one minutes, to be exact!), episodic and deliberately paced, but the lush setting, understated human drama and moving performances keep us riveted for the duration.",1356825600,,1686,5.276119402985074

2961325,5,B000W2C29S,"I had read some reviews before  purchasing the set. What we viewed was a wonderfully and tastefully presented story of a young and vibrant woman married to a wealthy, but due to war injury, impotent man whom she loved and attentively cared for. With some encouragement from her husband who senses her loneliness, she becomes involved with the husband's forest warden.
The relationship with the forest warden changes from pure physical needs and  gradually evolves into a more emotional and caring one, however, all along, she never neglects her husband. Some of the encounters and love scenes with the warden are explicit, but presented in a natural way, as opposed to the way physical sex is being portrayed in todays movies and TV programs. The photography is such that it is believable, but not xxx-rated. All through the movie, it is the characters and their relations that are important - not the few sex scenes.
The set includes a very helpful and important narrative by the director and commentaries about the sexual aspects of the movie, the issues faced by the actors and their acceptance on basis of the tasteful way in which these scenes were filmed.
Anyone looking for a lot of ups and downs, raw or unusual sex will be disappointed. Its an excellent movie, but not that kind of a movie.",1322179200,5,1299,4.794642857142857

2961328,5,B000W2C29S,"My first thoughts when watching Ferran Pascale's ""Lady Chatterley"" were:

1) What a beautiful world to inhabit. Is it a coincidence that Marina Hands looks a bit like Audrey Tautou in Amelie? And that the contrast of her crushed red velvet suit against the lush green forest also seems a bit like Amelie's red/green contrasting color-range? Maybe this is a French sensibility for beauty?

2) Why is it taking so long for Connie and Parkin to touch? I know it is coming. When. When. When. Okay, maybe now. No. Okay.

3) Why is Mellors called Parkin? Why is he built more like a boxer than the thin and young aesthetic man I was expecting?

In answer to my last two issues -- I am glad that the beginning was long and drawn out. The time it takes to get to the first touch builds the tension and lets us in to their experience.

And Jean-Louis Coullo'ch as Parkin won me over in a big way. By the time Constance and Parkin are in the middle of their love affair, I am smitten. The look in his eyes and his inner core vulnerability propel the emotional story.

Also, something other reviewers hadn't mentioned yet, the supporting cast is wonderful, especially in the extended European cut of this movie, where they are given more time to flesh out their roles. No one is a villain. Yes, Hippolyte Girardot's Clifford is cold and distant. But his pride is hurt as much as his body.  I enjoyed seeing his interactions with Mrs. Bolton. With Mrs. Bolton he found someone that would look up to him and who he could mentor and teach, and who would nurture him.

Marina Hand's performance is generous and subtle. She allows us to recognize ourselves in what she experiences. The connection and chemistry between the characters is compelling.

This Constance and Parkin relationship is about the honest revealing of one person to another. With each encounter they learn more about each other.

Director Pascale Ferran mentioned in the extra features that she was going for truthfulness in sensation and being in the moment. That is rare to see in movies, although people are hungry for it. Part of the way it is achieved is in taking the time to inhabit the world.",1301270400,6,2154,4.600522193211488

2961331,4,B000W2C29S,"when i first saw this film on sundance channel last week, i grew impatient with the slow pace at the beginning- i can only compare it to literal shakespeare, you have to get into the mindset to really enjoy it and understand it. once i did that, i enjoyed this film immensely. i love the costume design and the nature scenes and there was real passion and chemistry amongst all the actors involved. i loved the fact that both main characters were older and didn't have the american 'pretty plastic' movie star look about them. they were real. coullo'ch was fabulous with his earthy physique,big masculine hands(he knew how to use them)and expressive face and eyes. hands was wonderfully subtle in her transformation from uptight housewife to uninhibited earth girl. their love scenes are the most passionate i have ever seen. it is quite graphic but not perv or skanky.

so i had to order the extended version dvd.

this version is even better with more detail on the husband's injury and the psychological effect that 'the great war' had on him, i felt extreme sympathy for him, much more than in the theatrical release. also, the nurse has a realisation of what is happening in the extended version.

i have also ordered the book, john thomas and lady jane, the second version that dh lawrence wrote.

update**since i have watched this several times now, i can say that the first part of the film is fabulous, the second part becomes smarmy especially when they are running round the field buck naked. mellors became too sensitive and girlish in the end for my taste. don't get me wrong, i still love the film but only up to the part where they spend the night together in his cottage.",1271289600,8,1687,4.651006711409396
2961332,5,B000W2C29S,"The reviewers who complained about the length of this adaptation of the famous D.H. Lawrence novel need to be reminded that shortening the film would have meant seeing less of the beautiful and adorable Marina Hands, and how exactly is that a good thing?  As to the pace being too slow, that complaint stems from a failure to understand whose point of view we are seeing.  Hint: the title.  The pace is what it is to be consistent with the timeframe of a woman's natural emotional reactions to major life events, especially relative to the period of the film.  The setting is very Eden-like and the protagonists are a variation on Adam and Eve minus the theological baggage, so isn't this a story one wishes would never end?  If anything, I wish the film had been even longer!

As a francophile, I'm probably biased when I say that every romantic story works better in French -- the subtitles are adequate, by the way.  Hearing English names pronounced with a French accent didn't bother me at all, on the contrary, I found it rather charming.  I thought the resolution was appropriate.  Okay, it wasn't a happy ending in the Hollywood sense, but then what are the odds Hollywood would have made a film like this?  Zero.  Which is too bad.

It's also disconcerting to hear everything in French when it takes place in England and these are all supposed to be English people.

2961335,4,B000W2C29S,"Though my favorite adaptation of D.H. Lawrence's ""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" is the 1992 version with Joely Richardson and Sean Bean playing the lead roles, this 2006 French adaptation is well-done too. I just felt that in adapting it in French, the finer nuances of D.H. Lawrence's original English was lost. The movie is also rather long, clocking in at almost three hours [the first hour was extremely slow-moving] and could have done with some editing.

Anyway, in this adaptation, the director Pascale Ferran has adopted an earlier, less scandalous version of Lawrence's work as her source, focusing instead on sex as a catalyst that brings about major changes in the two leads. Lady Constance Chatterley [Marina Hands who went on to star in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly] is an oppressed young wife whose WW I vet and crippled husband, Clifford [Hippolyte Girardot] is unable to fulfill his wife's physical or emotional needs. He moves them to his country estate, Wragby where Constance feels lost and bored. Things change when Constance comes upon the half exposed [waist up] gamekeeper Oliver Parkin [Jean-Louis Coulloc'h] and fascinated, she contrives situations where the pair meet and eventually begin an affair. The sex scenes are very sensual, focusing not so much on the pure gyrations of the act but also on the facial expressions on the two people involved. Both actors really get into their roles, and their vivid facial expressions, especially Marina Hands', convey not just pleasure, but also the dawning realization of the power of sex. There are about six sex scenes in this movie, and there is a sort of chronological development in the pair's affair that mirrors the progression of their feelings for each other - from the first almost clumsy and brief encounter to the development of closeness and eventually love.

Marina Hands plays her role with consummate skill, from an almost naive and relatively inexperienced young woman to one who experiences a thoroughly sensual awakening and a liberation of senses. Jean-Louis Coulloc'h as the gamekeeper Parkin is credible as the rough yet gentle gamekeeper who is aware of the discrepancies in class between him and the lady of the house, yet loves with his body and soul.

Beautifully filmed, ""Lady Chatterley"" mesmerizes with its in-depth characterizations and its sensual portrayal of a passionate love story that crosses the lines of class and rules of society.",1240617600,23,2438,5.1206030150753765

2961337,5,B000W2C29S,"Director Pascale Ferran's award-winning film of D. H. Lawrence's famous-- or infamous novel, depending on your point of view-- is extremely well done and for the most part a joy to watch. The plot is familiar: Lady Chatterley (the perfectly cast Marina Hands) is reduced to taking care of her husband, Sir Clifford (Hippolyte Girardot), a casualty from World War I, in a marriage that is less than perfect on every level. One day she glimpses the gamekeeper Parkin (Jean-Louis Coullo'ch), a masculine, humpy man not in her class, naked from the waist up bathing himself. The rest is, as they say, herstory. Lady Chatterley spends the rest of the over-two-hour film having sex with Parkin whenever possible. What begins as clothed passion eventually becomes naked, abandoned love.

All three main characters are well cast, complex and believable. Sir Clifford, for all his coldness and upper class snobbery, is a sympathetic figure as evidenced in the scene when he stalls out his motorized wheel car and has to depend on the help of both his wife and Parkin as well as when he confronts Constance with her own drawing of class distinctions. As difficult as love may be between classes, particulary in this time in British history, we are left in the end of this beautifully filmed movie believing that it just may be possible. Parkin and Constance engage in some of the most torrid sex scenes you are likely to see.

The film is a little too long and at times gets a little too much like ""Elvira Madigan"" with all those trysts in the meadows. And I kept wondering why Sir Clifford's nurse didn't know what Lady Chatterley was doing when she was so often not at home but always out in the fields with her man. Finally the director shows passage of time with captions on the screen, a tad distracting.

However, the film feels strained.  It is almost unnatural when French actors have English names.  Film editing feels forced and choppy at time.  Prolonged 120 minute production is not helping either.  We do manage to like the two seemingly unlikely lovers who manage to build their relationship well beyond their oposing social standings.  We like them in the purity of their relationship that has no prejudices and to both of them comes natural as the surrounding of forrests, birds, rain and flowers.  Theirs is a romantic love that builds slowly but steadily.  Both are starved for affection and love that changes them both in the ways neither one of them expected it.",1205107200,3,963,5.0

A new take on the famous romance(infamous at the time of its launching), with a focus on a sensual awakening of the heroine compatible with her emotional maturing, as opposed to previous versions, which highlighted a ""sexual"" awakening by itself, without contextualizing it...The photography is beautiful and although it may seem slow in some passages, I think that was the director's intention, as to show that the internal emotional evolution process Lady Chatterley's is experimenting takes time to happen... Also to note that it all starts during the Fall and ends in a Summer, as stages of the ""soul's"" maturity, rippening. Very sensible too in picturing the highly stratified English social system.... The end is not identical to that of the namesake book, but more in sync, maybe, with contemporary times, which curiously, rends it ""timeless"", as it leaves the two soulmates more flexible to whatever the future will bring them individually but conscient and willing to preserve regardless of a format the deep bond they forged together!

This movie does not move. We rarely see motion of any kind. Every now and then, the pretty lady walks through a pretty place. But mostly, people stand, sit, languidly copulate, and gaze. They do not talk, they often do not even walk. It is interminable, taking way too long to linger over the nude bodies and two essentially boring, self-absorbed people. I was always aware that there was a crew with me, shouting instructions like, ""Walk through that gate, then turn and stare to your left."" A phony from start to finish. The scene where the lovers are dancing in the rain? It's a bright sunny day! Never have I seen anything so fake in a film.

Lawrence does a much better job building his characters, making them far less one dimensional. Sir Clifford is a tiny tyrant here. impossible to understand. Lawrence was no such creator.

I know Lawrence is hard to translate to the screen, as his fiery imagination and florid, nearly frenetic, writing work best in the world of words.

2961344,5,B000W2C29S,"DH Lawrence's novels may be tough to translate to the screen, so much of his writing is dependent on the words on the page as they form images of extraordinary beauty and sensuality. His novels are quintessentially British and reflect on the dehumanizing effects of modernity and industrialization, confronting issues relating to emotional health and vitality, spontaneity, sexuality, and human instinct. During his lifetime he was even labeled a pornographer, but that was then and now is now, and under the gifted guidance of director/writer (with Roger Bohbot and Pierre Trividic) Pascale Ferran, Lawrence's exquisite tale of sexual awakening has found what for this viewer is the finest transition of the novel to the screen.

The place is England after WW I and Sir Clifford Chatterley (Hippolyte Girardot) is the paraplegic wealthy husband of Constance/Lady Chatterley (a radiant Marina Hands). Quite apropos for the era, Constance tends to her impotent husband, does needlepoint, and takes walks to while away her boredom. On one of her walks she encounters the gamekeeper Parkin (Jean-Louis Coullo'ch), seeing a partially nude man for the first time in her life. The impact awakens her somnolent sexuality and she manages to visit Parkin daily, gradually allowing her lust to unfold. Parkin is 'below her class' but is a masculine, sensuous embodiment of everything Constance has never experienced. They slowly bond and both of them become passionately in love, finding lovemaking in Parkin's hut, in the woods, in the rain - wherever they encounter. Constance wants to have a baby and convinces Clifford that she can become impregnated and the resulting child would be 'Clifford's' by pact. Constance travels to London, the Riviera, and other ports, only to return home believing that Parkin has reclaimed his ex-wife. But there are many surprises that greet her and the manner in which the story resolves (in Ferran's hands) leaves us unsure of the future.

The film is captured amidst the beauties of the natural world - flowers, trees, springs, brooks - and these aspects of the natural world are an influential part of Constance's sexual awakening. Yes, there are scenes of complete nudity and love making but they are photographed so well by
Julian Hirsch that they become an integral part of the story. The musical score by B&eacute;atrice Thiriet finds the right quality of elegance and sensuality. If there is a problem with this nearly three-hour film it is in the editing by Yann Dedet and Mathilde Muyard that takes liberties with scene transitions that prove disruptive.

But it would be hard to imagine two actors who could match the subtlety and sexual tension that Marina Hands and Jean-Louis Coullo'ch to this film. It is breathtakingly beautiful to experience DH Lawrence's story in the hands of the French crew and cast. Grady Harp, December 07",1196899200,115,2871,5.143468950749464
3195620,5,B000W2C29S,"Pascale Ferran's LADY CHATTERLEY is an exquisitely wrought film. The themes of the Lawrence novel frame the film, but Ferran seems to have put together her own very contemporary treatment despite the literary and time period setting. The photography is breathtaking and is integral to my characterization of the film as ""exquisitely wrought."" The first part of the film moves very, very slowly with almost no dialogue as the luxurious expanses of the country landscape are defined along with the formal and aristocratic settings of the Wragby estate. The obsession, both photographically and from a time duration standpoint, with the landscape serves a significant two-fold purpose---establishing Nature as a primary element in this world and reinforcing the beauty/sensuality of that Nature. That becomes a critical underpinning to the orchestration to the unfolding of the very sensual and sexual relationship of Constance and the Gamekeeper Parkin. If there was a weakness in the film, it would be the concluding section of the film which seemed more simply a patchwork of ideas and actions and not the carefully orchestrated ever increasingly complex visual and thematic development of the first half to two-thirds. However, the ending left everything up in the air as concerns the future of their relationship which I thought was a masterful stroke. There was no smug Hollywood resolution in either direction nor did Ferran give it a particularly French ""affaire de passion"" resolution. The ending seemed very realistic and ""now"" and in that sense probably departs from Lawrence in the most dramatic way. This is a must see film!",1191801600,50,1634,5.288461538461538

It is situated very convincingly in its era (1920s), at a point of openiing up against the sexual restrictions of its class, society and period.  It shows the slow discovery of the possibilities of reaching for sexual passion and physical satisfaction - especially for the woman (after all, the title of the movie is: ""Lady Chatterley"", without the ""lover"" of the book.).  This is done without any prudish voyeuristic clichs, or romanticized imageries, yet, at the same time, fully engaging with all the power of sex and sensuality, and not avoiding looking at man's and woman's nudity.

3195700,5,B000W2C29S,"Quite superb. Lawrence's works do not easily lend themselves to the screen because so much of their value lies in his dense and poetic prose, as others here have pointed out. However, this film comes closest to capturing the essence of his message and perhaps even outdoes him in some respects, as the characters in this film are so such real and believable people, rather than literary symbols with impossibly rich and sensitive inner lives. It is indeed very long and exceedingly slow, by Hollywood standards, but it is never less than engrossing. Obviously, sex and sensuality and what they mean in human lives are at the heart of the story, so the film necessarily includes some nudity and non-explicit sex. One or two reviewers have implied that it could have been made without showing either, but then it would have not been Lady Chatterley. (The film is based on John Thomas and Lady Jane, an earlier version of Lawrence's better-known novel, Lady Chatterley's Lover.) In fact, the sex scenes could have been substantially more graphic without detracting one whit from the movie's considerable dramatic merits and might well have enhanced them, considering the source material. However, that might still be a step too far for most mainstream audiences. Finally, the performances are all good, but Marina Hands' is quite outstanding - never less than transparent, fluid, and utterly authentic. She is in virtually every scene and carried the film in a way that few, if any, other actors could. Jean-Louis Coulloc'h, as Parkin the gamekeeper, is monosyllabic until the very last few minutes, in which he suddenly reveals a depth of character and feeling that had scarcely been hinted at in the rest of the film. Bravo all round!",1439251200,2,1733,4.979310344827586

3195770,5,B000W2C29S,"I grew up during the 1940s-50s in a small town in eastern North Carolina. When, as a young adult, I heard discussions about LADY CHATTERLY'S LOVER (the book), comments ranged from scandalous to unfit to read, to ""delightfully freeing."" Admittedly, though a man (but of a sensitive nature), I did read portions of the novel and was then able to discuss my feelings with female friends and a few other men who, like me, found the book interesting and enlightening.

While watching the movie, I was made to feel a tenderness I have not often felt for a film. Realizing that conventional morality does not accept the relationship of the two principals in the film, I also understand their longing and their meeting of the minds, hearts, and bodies.

At the conclusion of the film, I felt somehow cheated; for I had expected a more realistic resolutioneven one that would defy moral convictions (Chatterly's husband could not be blamed for much, and appears to have given great latitude of behavior to her). Lady Chatterly and her lover did not ""ride into the sunset, to be happy ever after,"" but there seemed to have been an understanding that was both convenient and heartwarming.

In a word, I would call this film ""sweet."" Even the nudity did not come across as salacious or sinful, nor did the physical actions and interactions of Lady Chatterly and the gamekeeper. I highly recommend this film! Although it is quite mild by today's standards, the story depicted is heartwarming and affecting. I was left not totally satisfied, but nevertheless very glad to have watched! Take time on an easy afternoon to enjoy this film. Noel Thomas Manning",1411171200,,1642,4.8362989323843415

3195807,4,B000W2C29S,"I started off dubious on this one. Pretty but dissatisfied Lady Chatterley, married to an invalid of WW1, has her passions aroused when she comes upon the gamekeeper having a wash. My main objection was that said gamekeeper (here named Parkin instead of the original Mellors) was not the sex-god I had envisioned, but an older, and seriously taciturn - even curmudgeonly - character.
But I was soon captivated by their increasingly romantic assignations in the hut, or before the fire in Parkin's cottage. The scenery is beautiful, and the passion builds, from an initial quick encounter to hours full of love.
I loved the way the director filmed Lady Chatterley's holiday on the Riviera with her family in grainy footage, making it seem unreal to her, as against the bright clear colours of life on the estate.
Not a film to watch with your granny (obviously); a wonderful and stirring portrayal of a love affair.",1389657600,3,914,4.865384615384615

3195809,1,B000W2C29S,"I didn't finish watching this movie. I tried, and I kept getting distracted and leaving. It was boring. It is a European film, which means you are supposed to ""contemplate the full silences"" or some such bs. I read the book under the bed by the window of a spare bedroom when I was about 5 or 6 years old, much to the consternation of my mother who didn't know I could even read beyond ""See spot run"". It was on ""the list"" in high school, but I wasn't interested enough to revisit, since it wasn't anything forbidden to me by then. I remember everyone else running around giggling at all the ""descriptions"" and all the dirty words they wanted to use to shock their friends. If this movie got ""racy"" later on, I don't believe I could stomach it, due to the stodginess of those presumably involved. Rather an unlovely film in my estimation, but then maybe as an American I am more used to more epic offerings such as Gone With the Wind, which I saw about the same year I was reading Lady Chatterly  under the bed :-).

From the movie its not clear why main characteres were attracted to each other, after all logic and motivation still exist. Attraction was not really strong or anything and men were past their prime time to be impulsive.
Its kinda like we have periods in moviemaking where mainstream lost its steam about 1970th, and then found action as main idea and then I stopped watching

3195820,4,B000W2C29S,"""Lady Chatterley"" is a tale of repression, lust and sexual liberation set in post-World War I France. Despite its title, the movie isn't an adaptation of ""Lady Chatterley's Lover,"" the taboo-shattering D.H. Lawrence novel that scandalized the world when it was published in 1928. The film is actually based on a Lawrence work entitled ""John Thomas and Lady Jane"" that came out the previous year.  But the theme and storyline are just about as erotic and provocative as what we find in its more famous successor.

This version features Marina Hands as the beautiful young wife of an aristocratic mine owner who's been rendered wheelchair-bound and impotent by injuries he sustained on the battlefield. Deprived of sex, Constance begins to fantasize about the husky gamekeeper who lives in the woods on the estate, and it's not long before the two of them have consummated their relationship.  Jean Louis Coulloc'h is a particularly interesting casting choice as Parkin, for his scrappy features, thinning hair, linebacker's build and non-matinee-idol looks remove the story from the realm of dime-novel romance and into the arena of sheer physical attraction and lust.  At least for awhile, that is, until the almost inevitable rush of feelings begins to overtake the couple, and the harsh realities of sexual mores, marital bonds and class distinctions that so define the era in which they live begin to make themselves felt.

Co-written by Roger Bohbot and director Pascale Ferran, the movie is long (two-hours-and-forty-one minutes, to be exact!), episodic and deliberately paced, but the lush setting, understated human drama and moving performances keep us riveted for the duration.",1356825600,,1686,5.276119402985074

3195822,5,B000W2C29S,"I had read some reviews before  purchasing the set. What we viewed was a wonderfully and tastefully presented story of a young and vibrant woman married to a wealthy, but due to war injury, impotent man whom she loved and attentively cared for. With some encouragement from her husband who senses her loneliness, she becomes involved with the husband's forest warden.
The relationship with the forest warden changes from pure physical needs and  gradually evolves into a more emotional and caring one, however, all along, she never neglects her husband. Some of the encounters and love scenes with the warden are explicit, but presented in a natural way, as opposed to the way physical sex is being portrayed in todays movies and TV programs. The photography is such that it is believable, but not xxx-rated. All through the movie, it is the characters and their relations that are important - not the few sex scenes.
The set includes a very helpful and important narrative by the director and commentaries about the sexual aspects of the movie, the issues faced by the actors and their acceptance on basis of the tasteful way in which these scenes were filmed.
Anyone looking for a lot of ups and downs, raw or unusual sex will be disappointed. Its an excellent movie, but not that kind of a movie.",1322179200,5,1299,4.794642857142857

This filmic adaptation of the famous D.H.Lawrence has been until this date, one of the most sensual and sexist never brought to the sccreen. The nature works out as splendid scebery and at the same time the visual metaphor is more than eloquent. Her marriage is an absolute disaster of isolation and loneliness. the arrival of the spring and the summer reflects the mood of her heart, when at last is loved and considered as huamn being and not a simple gadget in that beautiful castle.

The photography is dazzling and suggestive, as well as the outstanding performances of the trio in question.

3195825,5,B000W2C29S,"My first thoughts when watching Ferran Pascale's ""Lady Chatterley"" were:

1) What a beautiful world to inhabit. Is it a coincidence that Marina Hands looks a bit like Audrey Tautou in Amelie? And that the contrast of her crushed red velvet suit against the lush green forest also seems a bit like Amelie's red/green contrasting color-range? Maybe this is a French sensibility for beauty?

2) Why is it taking so long for Connie and Parkin to touch? I know it is coming. When. When. When. Okay, maybe now. No. Okay.

3) Why is Mellors called Parkin? Why is he built more like a boxer than the thin and young aesthetic man I was expecting?

In answer to my last two issues -- I am glad that the beginning was long and drawn out. The time it takes to get to the first touch builds the tension and lets us in to their experience.

And Jean-Louis Coullo'ch as Parkin won me over in a big way. By the time Constance and Parkin are in the middle of their love affair, I am smitten. The look in his eyes and his inner core vulnerability propel the emotional story.

Also, something other reviewers hadn't mentioned yet, the supporting cast is wonderful, especially in the extended European cut of this movie, where they are given more time to flesh out their roles. No one is a villain. Yes, Hippolyte Girardot's Clifford is cold and distant. But his pride is hurt as much as his body.  I enjoyed seeing his interactions with Mrs. Bolton. With Mrs. Bolton he found someone that would look up to him and who he could mentor and teach, and who would nurture him.

Marina Hand's performance is generous and subtle. She allows us to recognize ourselves in what she experiences. The connection and chemistry between the characters is compelling.

This Constance and Parkin relationship is about the honest revealing of one person to another. With each encounter they learn more about each other.

Director Pascale Ferran mentioned in the extra features that she was going for truthfulness in sensation and being in the moment. That is rare to see in movies, although people are hungry for it. Part of the way it is achieved is in taking the time to inhabit the world.",1301270400,6,2154,4.600522193211488

3195828,4,B000W2C29S,"when i first saw this film on sundance channel last week, i grew impatient with the slow pace at the beginning- i can only compare it to literal shakespeare, you have to get into the mindset to really enjoy it and understand it. once i did that, i enjoyed this film immensely. i love the costume design and the nature scenes and there was real passion and chemistry amongst all the actors involved. i loved the fact that both main characters were older and didn't have the american 'pretty plastic' movie star look about them. they were real. coullo'ch was fabulous with his earthy physique,big masculine hands(he knew how to use them)and expressive face and eyes. hands was wonderfully subtle in her transformation from uptight housewife to uninhibited earth girl. their love scenes are the most passionate i have ever seen. it is quite graphic but not perv or skanky.

so i had to order the extended version dvd.

this version is even better with more detail on the husband's injury and the psychological effect that 'the great war' had on him, i felt extreme sympathy for him, much more than in the theatrical release. also, the nurse has a realisation of what is happening in the extended version.

i have also ordered the book, john thomas and lady jane, the second version that dh lawrence wrote.

update**since i have watched this several times now, i can say that the first part of the film is fabulous, the second part becomes smarmy especially when they are running round the field buck naked. mellors became too sensitive and girlish in the end for my taste. don't get me wrong, i still love the film but only up to the part where they spend the night together in his cottage.",1271289600,8,1687,4.651006711409396
3195829,5,B000W2C29S,"The reviewers who complained about the length of this adaptation of the famous D.H. Lawrence novel need to be reminded that shortening the film would have meant seeing less of the beautiful and adorable Marina Hands, and how exactly is that a good thing?  As to the pace being too slow, that complaint stems from a failure to understand whose point of view we are seeing.  Hint: the title.  The pace is what it is to be consistent with the timeframe of a woman's natural emotional reactions to major life events, especially relative to the period of the film.  The setting is very Eden-like and the protagonists are a variation on Adam and Eve minus the theological baggage, so isn't this a story one wishes would never end?  If anything, I wish the film had been even longer!

As a francophile, I'm probably biased when I say that every romantic story works better in French -- the subtitles are adequate, by the way.  Hearing English names pronounced with a French accent didn't bother me at all, on the contrary, I found it rather charming.  I thought the resolution was appropriate.  Okay, it wasn't a happy ending in the Hollywood sense, but then what are the odds Hollywood would have made a film like this?  Zero.  Which is too bad.

There are also far too many long, long, long tracking shots which add nothing to the story and are not needed at all.  They probably could have chopped out at least an hour of the film just by shortening these.

It's also disconcerting to hear everything in French when it takes place in England and these are all supposed to be English people.

I must also say that Lady C's attraction to Parkin is a bit puzzling, since he really seems more like an oaf than anything.  Puzzling indeed.",1254787200,,578,4.26605504587156

3195832,4,B000W2C29S,"Though my favorite adaptation of D.H. Lawrence's ""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" is the 1992 version with Joely Richardson and Sean Bean playing the lead roles, this 2006 French adaptation is well-done too. I just felt that in adapting it in French, the finer nuances of D.H. Lawrence's original English was lost. The movie is also rather long, clocking in at almost three hours [the first hour was extremely slow-moving] and could have done with some editing.

Anyway, in this adaptation, the director Pascale Ferran has adopted an earlier, less scandalous version of Lawrence's work as her source, focusing instead on sex as a catalyst that brings about major changes in the two leads. Lady Constance Chatterley [Marina Hands who went on to star in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly] is an oppressed young wife whose WW I vet and crippled husband, Clifford [Hippolyte Girardot] is unable to fulfill his wife's physical or emotional needs. He moves them to his country estate, Wragby where Constance feels lost and bored. Things change when Constance comes upon the half exposed [waist up] gamekeeper Oliver Parkin [Jean-Louis Coulloc'h] and fascinated, she contrives situations where the pair meet and eventually begin an affair. The sex scenes are very sensual, focusing not so much on the pure gyrations of the act but also on the facial expressions on the two people involved. Both actors really get into their roles, and their vivid facial expressions, especially Marina Hands', convey not just pleasure, but also the dawning realization of the power of sex. There are about six sex scenes in this movie, and there is a sort of chronological development in the pair's affair that mirrors the progression of their feelings for each other - from the first almost clumsy and brief encounter to the development of closeness and eventually love.

Marina Hands plays her role with consummate skill, from an almost naive and relatively inexperienced young woman to one who experiences a thoroughly sensual awakening and a liberation of senses. Jean-Louis Coulloc'h as the gamekeeper Parkin is credible as the rough yet gentle gamekeeper who is aware of the discrepancies in class between him and the lady of the house, yet loves with his body and soul.

Beautifully filmed, ""Lady Chatterley"" mesmerizes with its in-depth characterizations and its sensual portrayal of a passionate love story that crosses the lines of class and rules of society.",1240617600,23,2438,5.1206030150753765

3195834,5,B000W2C29S,"Director Pascale Ferran's award-winning film of D. H. Lawrence's famous-- or infamous novel, depending on your point of view-- is extremely well done and for the most part a joy to watch. The plot is familiar: Lady Chatterley (the perfectly cast Marina Hands) is reduced to taking care of her husband, Sir Clifford (Hippolyte Girardot), a casualty from World War I, in a marriage that is less than perfect on every level. One day she glimpses the gamekeeper Parkin (Jean-Louis Coullo'ch), a masculine, humpy man not in her class, naked from the waist up bathing himself. The rest is, as they say, herstory. Lady Chatterley spends the rest of the over-two-hour film having sex with Parkin whenever possible. What begins as clothed passion eventually becomes naked, abandoned love.

All three main characters are well cast, complex and believable. Sir Clifford, for all his coldness and upper class snobbery, is a sympathetic figure as evidenced in the scene when he stalls out his motorized wheel car and has to depend on the help of both his wife and Parkin as well as when he confronts Constance with her own drawing of class distinctions. As difficult as love may be between classes, particulary in this time in British history, we are left in the end of this beautifully filmed movie believing that it just may be possible. Parkin and Constance engage in some of the most torrid sex scenes you are likely to see.

The film is a little too long and at times gets a little too much like ""Elvira Madigan"" with all those trysts in the meadows. And I kept wondering why Sir Clifford's nurse didn't know what Lady Chatterley was doing when she was so often not at home but always out in the fields with her man. Finally the director shows passage of time with captions on the screen, a tad distracting.

""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" was one of the books that in its time was considered scandalous.  I was expecting that French director will produce a film that is sensual and erotic.  However, the film feels strained.  It is almost unnatural when French actors have English names.  Film editing feels forced and choppy at time.  Prolonged 120 minute production is not helping either.  We do manage to like the two seemingly unlikely lovers who manage to build their relationship well beyond their oposing social standings.  We like them in the purity of their relationship that has no prejudices and to both of them comes natural as the surrounding of forrests, birds, rain and flowers.  Theirs is a romantic love that builds slowly but steadily.  Both are starved for affection and love that changes them both in the ways neither one of them expected it.",1205107200,3,963,5.0

A new take on the famous romance(infamous at the time of its launching), with a focus on a sensual awakening of the heroine compatible with her emotional maturing, as opposed to previous versions, which highlighted a ""sexual"" awakening by itself, without contextualizing it...The photography is beautiful and although it may seem slow in some passages, I think that was the director's intention, as to show that the internal emotional evolution process Lady Chatterley's is experimenting takes time to happen... Also to note that it all starts during the Fall and ends in a Summer, as stages of the ""soul's"" maturity, rippening. Very sensible too in picturing the highly stratified English social system.... The end is not identical to that of the namesake book, but more in sync, maybe, with contemporary times, which curiously, rends it ""timeless"", as it leaves the two soulmates more flexible to whatever the future will bring them individually but conscient and willing to preserve regardless of a format the deep bond they forged together!

This movie does not move. We rarely see motion of any kind. Every now and then, the pretty lady walks through a pretty place. But mostly, people stand, sit, languidly copulate, and gaze. They do not talk, they often do not even walk. It is interminable, taking way too long to linger over the nude bodies and two essentially boring, self-absorbed people. I was always aware that there was a crew with me, shouting instructions like, ""Walk through that gate, then turn and stare to your left."" A phony from start to finish. The scene where the lovers are dancing in the rain? It's a bright sunny day! Never have I seen anything so fake in a film.

Lawrence does a much better job building his characters, making them far less one dimensional. Sir Clifford is a tiny tyrant here. impossible to understand. Lawrence was no such creator.

I know Lawrence is hard to translate to the screen, as his fiery imagination and florid, nearly frenetic, writing work best in the world of words. But this is a doggy film, tedious, slow and utterly unengaging. It uses nature as a substitute for storytelling (not that there's much story to tell) and by the final famous flower adorning scene, an incredibly vivid and vibrant part of the book, I was bored silly.",1200355200,10,1414,4.720647773279352

3195841,5,B000W2C29S,"DH Lawrence's novels may be tough to translate to the screen, so much of his writing is dependent on the words on the page as they form images of extraordinary beauty and sensuality. His novels are quintessentially British and reflect on the dehumanizing effects of modernity and industrialization, confronting issues relating to emotional health and vitality, spontaneity, sexuality, and human instinct. During his lifetime he was even labeled a pornographer, but that was then and now is now, and under the gifted guidance of director/writer (with Roger Bohbot and Pierre Trividic) Pascale Ferran, Lawrence's exquisite tale of sexual awakening has found what for this viewer is the finest transition of the novel to the screen.

The place is England after WW I and Sir Clifford Chatterley (Hippolyte Girardot) is the paraplegic wealthy husband of Constance/Lady Chatterley (a radiant Marina Hands). Quite apropos for the era, Constance tends to her impotent husband, does needlepoint, and takes walks to while away her boredom. On one of her walks she encounters the gamekeeper Parkin (Jean-Louis Coullo'ch), seeing a partially nude man for the first time in her life. The impact awakens her somnolent sexuality and she manages to visit Parkin daily, gradually allowing her lust to unfold. Parkin is 'below her class' but is a masculine, sensuous embodiment of everything Constance has never experienced. They slowly bond and both of them become passionately in love, finding lovemaking in Parkin's hut, in the woods, in the rain - wherever they encounter. Constance wants to have a baby and convinces Clifford that she can become impregnated and the resulting child would be 'Clifford's' by pact. Constance travels to London, the Riviera, and other ports, only to return home believing that Parkin has reclaimed his ex-wife. But there are many surprises that greet her and the manner in which the story resolves (in Ferran's hands) leaves us unsure of the future.

The film is captured amidst the beauties of the natural world - flowers, trees, springs, brooks - and these aspects of the natural world are an influential part of Constance's sexual awakening. Yes, there are scenes of complete nudity and love making but they are photographed so well by
Julian Hirsch that they become an integral part of the story. The musical score by B&eacute;atrice Thiriet finds the right quality of elegance and sensuality. If there is a problem with this nearly three-hour film it is in the editing by Yann Dedet and Mathilde Muyard that takes liberties with scene transitions that prove disruptive.

But it would be hard to imagine two actors who could match the subtlety and sexual tension that Marina Hands and Jean-Louis Coullo'ch to this film. It is breathtakingly beautiful to experience DH Lawrence's story in the hands of the French crew and cast. Grady Harp, December 07",1196899200,115,2871,5.143468950749464
