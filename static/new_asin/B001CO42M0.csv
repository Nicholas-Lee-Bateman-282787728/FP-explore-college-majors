3515232,3,B001CO42M0,"We just rented this from Red Box, and from someone who happens to enjoy family-friendly low-budget Christian films, Sunday School Musical is a lot of fun.  Very clean, unless you decide to count the brief kiss at the very end.  It's not a high-end theatrical blockbuster, but for an all-ages family movie night we thoroughly enjoyed it.

There's a scene where the main character breaks into song and dance and is getting the others to join in.  My 6-year-old decides to join in too and gets the rest of us to as well.  It made for a memorable night.

Great music.  Great dancing.  Join in and have some fun.

UPDATE:  I was just looking back over some old reviews and I think our standards have changed since I first wrote this one about 5 years ago.  I think I'd be more inclined to agree with the other review by Esther Lindsey in Ohio.  We've seen some attitudes creep up in our kids that we're not that happy about and wish we had been more perceptive to this kind of content back then.",1226707200,7,990,4.3791208791208796

Written & Directed By: Rachel Goldenberg.
Starring : Candise Lakota
  [...]
 Get past the title, And the doors it opened !
This is a very well done musical with no low points like cussing or bad clothes worn by teenagers to sell it to an easy market.
The music is very strong, Dance numbers well choreographed.
The screenplay and direction were done by a first timer, But couldn't tell by results.
Two choirs have challenges and by joining the strengths and weaknesses equal out.
 A moment by outside characters, That was definitely un-christian resolves into a happy ending.",1225929600,3,597,4.881188118811881

3515239,2,B001CO42M0,"This movie is like a mashup of High School Musical, A Walk to Remember, and Gotta Kick It Up... sounds great, right? WRONG. The only reason I'm giving this movie 2 stars is because it has a good message and is clean, other than that, the filming is horrible, the actors' lips don't move with the sound, and it's just a really cheesy movie. I was trying not to be too critical because it's low budget and for a good cause, but it really was not up to par. The description sounded great, which is why I decided to watch it, but I was disappointed. Plus, the acting is really really horrible. Maybe the characters were supposed to act awkward, or they were just given really crappy lines to work with. Props for a good message, but the videography was really not so great.",1372377600,,769,4.347222222222222
3515240,3,B001CO42M0,"The Asylum has gained a bad reputation for making low budget duplicates of Hollywood movies for the home video market. Sunday School Musical(2008) was harmless fun. It's not perfect. A musical number with Zack starts and then nothing happens! The Christian themes are shoehorned into the movie. The film stars...nobody! I am kidding. It stars Chris Chatman and Candise Lakota. It's directed by Rachel Lee Goldenberg. Amy Ganser is ultra cute as Margaret. In Sunday School Musical, two choirs work together to save a church from being closed. Sunday School Musical tries to cash in on the success of Disney's High School Musical movies. Hollywood produced musicals from the 1920's to the 1960's. The genre was almost dead in the 1970's.
Only recently has Hollywood movies and TV shows started a renewed interest in the musical genre with TV shows such as Glee. Sunday School Musical is a fun, B grade musical.",1360540800,,908,4.980263157894737
3515241,4,B001CO42M0,"My eight year old granddaughter checked out this DVD from the library.  She loved it so much that I got on amazon to see if it could be purchased.  I saw all the other reviews and I'd like to add that this movie whether low budget or not, is adorable.

The children are very talented.  Zach's singing voice is amazing.  My grandchild's favorite character is Savannah.  The story line is true to life.  Children must learn how to deal with life's events.  This movie demonstrates their growth.  It keeps the characters real.

I enjoyed it as much as she did.  I think we've watched it about eight times now.
The songs are precious.  My personal favorite is ""You're not the boss of me.""  My granddaughter's personal favorite is ""This little light of mine.""",1328313600,2,754,4.578947368421052
3515242,1,B001CO42M0,"Esther LINDSEY ""esther_in_ohio"" was very perceptive, and you should read her review carefully (even if we have different ideas about appropriateness of kissing).

The movie is indeed full of spiritual problems. The biggest problem is that the Production Company of this film, ""Faith Films"" is owned and operated by a larger company called ""Asylum"", that makes blockbuster rip-offs and produces and distributes hard-core pornographic films. You can look them up on IMDB, or there is a Wikipedia page talking about them.

Do not buy this movie. Your money may go to pay for pornography.",1324598400,3,584,5.202127659574468
3515243,5,B001CO42M0,"It's not a big budget musical.  It's not a glossy production.  It's not filled with superstar actors.  Let's face it:  Disney didn't just suddenly decide to produce a Christian version of High School Musical.

What Sunday School Musical is:  a feel good story, a fun cast, some catchy songs, some energetic dances, and decent production values.  Decent as in ""up to standard"" and decent as in ""any age can see this.""

And SSM also features a bright, wonderful talent...Chris Chatman.  His performance is polished, his singing is top notch, and his dancing is fun.  This guy deserves a career in show biz, and since the film was made in 2008 and I've never heard of him before this, I fear that his career is struggling, or (please don't say it) dead.

No, it's not a Disney spectacular.  It's just a good, independent, low budget film aimed at a Christian audience.  Yet the Christian values are not preachy, and the message is important to everyone...people of all faiths, people who are still searching for faith, and people of no faith at all, just a desire to make their world a better one.

Sunday School Musical is a winner--a little winner, but a winner just the same.  Only a curmudgeon could watch this and come away frowning.",1321315200,3,1235,4.67906976744186
3515244,1,B001CO42M0,"If you aren't ten years old, you're better off not watching this movie. The choreography is great, if you don't know how to recognize truly *good* choreography. The acting is literally painful to watch at times. I know they were low budget, but when you're hiring (mostly teenage) actors, I doubt it'd break the bank to pick ones that could actually act their way out of  paper bag.  Aside from the horrible acting, terrible dances/songs, the kids' attitudes stink! Other reviewers have mentioned this, and I agree whole-heartedly. Not only that, but their emotions don't fit the scenarios. I mean, it seems as if the ""director"" wanted to portray a fight scene somewhere in the movie, and just picked a random scene in which to put it. If I was thirteen, why would my friend fight me because my mom is making me move?
TLDR; don't watch this movie unless you're ten years old and not bothered by plot holes, terrible acting/dialogue, and just all-around-bad movies.",1306281600,,964,4.801204819277109
3515245,4,B001CO42M0,"Sunday School Musical arived quickly and was in perfect condition.

This movie was perfect to show to my ""tweens"" Sunday school class. It isn't always easy finding real life movies where teenagers talk about church and faith. Don't get me wrong, Veggie Tales are great for younger kids and even fun for teens once in a while. As a Sunday School teacher, though, I like to show movies that show people talking about faith and not just shows with asparagus talking about God (sorry Junior!) No, it isn't a high budget production but it does get the spiritual message across. The class loved the dancing and singing and, even though the acting won't win any Oscars anytime soon, they didn't seem to notice or care. They just tapped and snapped along with the music.

The film does itself a huge disservice with the title and the box cover picture that they chose. They opened themselves up to an automatic comparison to a high budget ""tween"" classic. Unfortunately, in that comparison, ""Sunday School Musical"" will not fare well. Standing on its own, however, it is a fun, meaningful movie with a good message: by believing and working together good things can happen.

I guess it all depends what you were expecting. For me, this film was just what I needed.",1305504000,2,1256,4.726027397260274

KIDS WERE DISRESPECTFUL TO PARENTS, BUT THAT IS IN MANY MOVIES SADLY. IN FILMS LIKE HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL KIDS ARE GIVEN MORE AUTHORITY THAN WAS IS ALLOWED IN REAL LIFE. IN SUNDAY SCHOOL MUSICAL THEY DID NOT OVERSTEP BOUNDARIES WITH SCHOOL OR COMPETITION AUTHORITIES THOUGH THEY DID PUSH THE ENVELOPE.
THE ACTING WAS AVERAGE NOT AWARD WINNING, BUT NOT BAD EITHER LIKE A CERTAIN ACTRESS WHO SHOULD BE BANNED FROM FILMS ALTOGETHER. SUNDAY SCHOOL MUSICAL PROVES IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE A GOOD FILM WITH A LOW BUDGET.",1247529600,3,683,4.652892561983471
3515249,2,B001CO42M0,"Two homeschooled families who love HSM sat down tonight to watch this very fun-looking HSM take-off flick.  We didn't mind it was a copy of HSM but were looking forward to it!

As we watched the movie, I heard our 13 year olds remark of the bad attitudes all these kids had during most of the movie.  The movie begins with bad attitudes and hearts as 2 choirs compete and the better choir brags and puts down the other team.  Then when the main character learned he has to move, his `best friend' and him get in a fight and again need attitudes adjustments.  The two main characters also get mad at their parents for something that is out of their control - which is moving in with an Aunt because of a lay-off and the previous death of the mother. My kids noticed that the parents apologize but the teens don't.  These are only a few examples.

Not only that, there was a small kiss at the end by the two main characters and we didn't see any relational commitments established during the movie.  Even though our kids are encouraged to court, they were shocked that two Christian kids would kiss each other with no apparent dating/courting status behind it.  They jaws dropped.  Like it's ""OK"" to just kiss someone on the lips because you like each other.  Where is the self-control?  That can lead to other things.

And the music isn't as catchy as HSM.  It's more old style beat boxing rap with both traditional and gospel choirs type music

But I still gave it 2 stars because there were a few shining moments.  The main character speaks about trusting God, though all along it didn't seem that way.  He grows in grace.  Then he brings the two rival groups together and shows compassion.  The ending song makes up for some of the songs that needed their lyrics given attitudes adjustments.

But for the most-part we were very disappointed with the movie and it is mediocre at best.  There's little talk of God, but a lot of ""God stuff""  You know, the fluff of Christianity but no backbone - until the main character hears a sermon and from that point on, the movie got a little better.  But I'm not planning on seeing it anytime soon.  I mean, how good is it when even my kids were picking up bad attitude, the lack of Godliness in it and at the end said, ""The teens in the original HSM series treated each other better than those in this move!""  For the most part, I have to agree.

One more thing - If this is what most Christians feel is top-notch stuff, Lord help us!  It was VERY watered down Christianity and I felt showed some of the characters hypocrital as well.",1236988800,11,2575,4.40042372881356
3515250,3,B001CO42M0,"ok, this is by far not the best musical I have seen. When it competes against major musicals, cats, phantom of the opera, beauty and the beast, joseph and the technicolor dream coat, or basically the popular music on broadway. or Other movie musicals like willy wonka, Doctor Dolittle, Grease.

Now it may not be that great, but in comparison to movie musical direct to dvd as is our competitor ""High school Musical"" it holds up pretty well.

couple things to keep in mind, first this movie was directed in thirteen days, made by young first timers and unlike high school musical it had kids that were of what appeared to be high school age, it also had a low budget. Not to metion that it had a clear message, be at times watered down (like at the end with the judges decision) but the movie holds itself up pretty well

my favorite songs, I cannot think of the names but, the one in the beginning where zach and his friend from church are fighting, and where the geek with glasses that just happens to be the bully???... fights with the main girl in the choir.

It is a good film as a break from Disney's musical versions that have probably been seen so many times that they get stuck in your head and you end up humming them in line at the post office or at the supermarket.

In the world of tv movies this is a worthy component

in a letter grade of ""A"" being Lord of the rings and
""F"" being Plan 9 from outer space

this movie ranks a solid ""C"", it's not great, but it's not that bad either. In any case if you like the musicals on the disney channel or have kids that do, I highly suggest that you watch this seemly bogus takeoff, it could be better than you give it credit for.",1232323200,5,1684,4.2274143302180685
3515251,1,B001CO42M0,"What a huge disappointment!!  When I saw this movie on the shelves at Blockbuster and read the summary on the back cover I was really excited.
But the only redeeming qualities of the film are that it's clean, and the secondary message about letting go of pride and working together for a righteous purpose, comes through at the end.
  But the MAIN message that comes through is incredibly disappointing-- especially for a Christian film aimed at teens.
The MAIN message that this film sends, is that choirs that sing in a more traditional style stink.  If you want to sound good, then you have to sing in hip-hop or gospel swing style.
 When the main female character sings ""Be Thou My Vision"" with her original school choir, she's off pitch and weak.  When the main male character tells her she needs to sing in a more hip way, all of sudden she sounds like a perfect pitch pop-star. The more traditional hymn-singing choir stinks until they learn to sing with a more contemporary and hip style.  And that message comes through through the entire film.
Only at the end do you get a good message about working together.
  Nevermind the low-budget and less than average acting-- I was EXPECTING that.  Honestly I was.  But I was expecting a GOOD MESSAGE!
The last thing that teens need is adults telling them that music for worship is pathetic and weak unless you stick in a drum machine and some beat-boxing.  Even my 14, 11 and 9 year old kids were irritated by the poor message this film was sending.
  I didn't mind the ""hip"" style of the music at all-- I just didn't like they made the TRADITIONAL more conservative style to be a scapegoat for why the choir sounded so bad.
Two big thumbs down.",1230681600,5,1698,4.542763157894737
3515252,1,B001CO42M0,"Even though it's only a second-rate show with a hodge-podge of key scenes and characters from other shows (GREASE, BYE BYE BIRDIE, etc.), HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL is huge among American pre-teens and teenagers. I'm not a very big fan of the show because it shows such little originality. Anyway, with the massive success of HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, it was only a matter of time before production companies started spewing out their own versions of the movie in an attempt to cash in on the success. SUNDAY SCHOOL MUSICAL is one of these.

SUNDAY SCHOOL MUSICAL was definitely inspired by HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, but instead of taking place in a typical high school is set in a small Christian school. Instead of a New Year's Eve of karaoke, SUNDAY SCHOOL MUSICAL's two stars, Zach (Chris Chatman) and Savannah (Candise Lakota) first meet at a regional church choir competition. Zach is one of the stars of his choir and his group is chosen to compete in the final competition. By a fluke, Savannah's group is also selected to compete in the finals. Later Zach's mom gets a new job and they are forced to move. Zach begins attending a new school, which turns out to be the same school where Savannah goes. Savannah and some of her friends try to get Zach to join the choir, but he refuses because he feels connected to his old choir and doesn't want to compete against his old friends. But a tragedy befalls Zach's friends and causes everyone to reconsider what is important in their lives and where loyalty should fall.

There are one or two songs in SUNDAY SCHOOL MUSICAL that aren't too terrible. Candise Lakota is beautiful and has the attention of every scene she is in. There is no foul language and no violence. The movie tries to deliver a message about the importance of using one's gifts regardless if one is rewarded for it. Those are the good things about the movie.

But, SUNDAY SCHOOL MUSICAL is not a very good movie. It was written, directed, and choreographed by first timers and I try very hard to give first-timers a break. But if a movie is bad, it's bad. SUNDAY SCHOOL MUSICAL is bad. I've seen better acting in middle school skits than most of the acting in the movie. Most of the songs are covered in cheese and schmaltz and have a beat and vibe that sounds and feels like a Carmen song from the late 1980s or early 1990s. Candise Lakota is gorgeous and is quite talented, but she has zero chemistry with her co-star, Chris Chatman. HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL is a second-rate musical watered-downed from other musicals, but much of the plot of SUNDAY SCHOOL MUSICAL is watered-downed from HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL; there's barely an ounce of originality in the whole story.

I did not enjoy watching SUNDAY SCHOOL MUSICAL. In fact, there were certain parts of it that were painful to watch, especially some of the musical numbers. There are some people who would enjoy the movie, especially because there's no foul language, violence, or sexual innuendo and has a fluffy-feel-goodness with a happy ending. But if you actually want to see something that has some originality and creativity, contains decent acting, and attempts to engage the audience, you're better off watching something else.",1230076800,2,3192,4.725314183123878
