2069510,3,B00029IZLK,"This was an okay workout, I didn't like that it was split into 4 different segments.  I prefer the Leslie Sansone walk away the pounds 4 mile challenge to this one.

But I'll do this one once in a while for a variety from LS WATP.",1143244800,4,230,3.9782608695652173
2069511,4,B00029IZLK,"I say it's a little more intense than ""walking"" and it is, but isn't that the point? If you were really really in need of working your way up, you can take it easy with this tape, but they make it so much fun, you want to just join right in!

I'm 38 year old. A few months ago, after trying dietary changes for several months, I was still overweight (w/hypothyroidism) and my doctor encouraged me to ""move a LOT more"" to lose some weight and bring down my blood pressure. Something about this dvd made me want to try it more than Leslie Sansone, who people either love or hate apparently. So, one day I bought it on a whim.

I love this workout! I find Madelein Lewis to be motivating, and the music is very fun to work out to. Plus the setting is gorgeous, not pretentious or anything. The cuing is pretty good, although the first time through I was a little behind a few times, by the second time through it was really easy to keep up (aside from being winded). However, my husband with ""two left feet"" had trouble trying to keep up with it, my 10 year old (who studied ballet for a couple of years) was fine with it.

Two criticisms: There are two other models; one is supposed to do the ""easier"" version and the other the ""most difficult"" version,. However, I think the model for the ""easier"" verson sometimes got carried away and did the ""medium"" version. Also there are a few places that Lewis could have given breathing cues to enhance the exercise but didn't, although she does mention breathing once in a while. Fortunately I used to work out a lot at the gym, do yoga and take aerobic classes so I'm already familiar w/effective breathing.

I started out doing just one segment, plus the cool down as I was pretty out of shape. After a few days, I did 2 segments, and after less than a week of that, I was doing all three. I like the music a lot, and it was my only aerobic workout for almost 2 months. My m-i-l, who takes a lot of classes, tried it when visiting me, and she really enjoyed it, too. Now, sometimes I skip the squatting exercises and do a toning tape afterward.",1127347200,23,2087,4.275949367088607
2069512,2,B00029IZLK,"If you're looking for an intense work-out, this will give it to you. On the other hand if you're looking for fun with your work-out, I don't think you'll find it here. I did not like her cuing and in particular did not enjoy her constant ""grunting"". Some may find that motivating, I find it annoying. I have several Leslie Sansone DVD's and I love her workouts. Some complain about her chatter, I find it motivating. Leslie makes you feel like you can do it and she's right there with you. Her walk kick is a great, just as intense as this DVD but a lot more fun.",1123632000,13,563,4.222222222222222
2069513,5,B00029IZLK,"Great workout.  It could be light aerobics, or it could be termed walking ... and it's up to you!  I use 2lb hand weights and add more arm movements.  I also like to 2-minute leg/balance sequence at the end of each of the three walking sections.  The set is visually beautiful, an outdoor garden area, and the music very gentle, a sort of new-age style.  There is a program mode at the beginning that lets you string together any four workout sections in any order.  Sometimes I just let it run, and other times I'll program Section 2 twice and Section 3 twice.  Then, when that's done, I'll go back and run the cooldown ... making it a 50 minute workout.  I have a number of workout videos and because of the gentle spirit behind this one, I know it will wear well over time.",1118016000,11,776,4.303448275862069
2069514,5,B00029IZLK,"I have been doing Leslie Sansone walking DVDs for a few months now.  I've begun to get bored with hers so I'm branching out to other forms of aerobic fitness.  I found this DVD, which I love already.

It is 40 minutes long, divided into 4, 10 minute chapters.  The first three chapters are cardio.  Chapter 1 is the simplest and lowest intensity--it is the closest to Leslie's workouts.  2 and 3 are harder. Each of the three workouts is self-contained.  They have a short warm-up at the beginning, and some lower body work (squats/lunges) at the end.  The last 10 minute segment is a yoga-based stretch.  Personally I like to do all four segments together for an excellent workout, but you can always just pick on or two if you're pressed for time.  The three workouts are all different, and use different moves/combinations.  So even if I do them all together, I feel like there is enough variety to keep me from getting bored.  Breaking the workout up into 10 minute segments makes the time seem to fly by.

The DVD was filmed in a gorgeous outdoor garden.  It features three exercisers. The instructor, Madeleine Lewis, does intermediate versions of the exercises.  Another exerciser does easier versions, and a third exerciser does the most intense versions.  She hops and jogs through a lot of the workout.  What I like about the instructor is she isn't babbling constantly like Leslie Sansone.  She talks, but spends that time cuing you on how to move your body.  One warning is that the choreography is a bit more complex than Walk Away the Pounds. There is less walking and more moving around in different ways. I didn't find it difficult at all, but a total beginner might want to start with the less intense WATP DVDs.",1117670400,79,1729,4.646864686468647
2069515,1,B00029IZLK,"the images are ok as well as the music / sound but this is a low impact aerobics class and not a rutine for you to exercise walking.

2069516,5,B00029IZLK,"I have EVERY Walk Away the Pounds workout, the 2 George Foreman walking tapes and the Prevention Walk your Way Slim workout.  While I think they are all great workouts, I must say I like this Get Moving, Walking for Weight Loss the best of all. I'm in my early 30's and fairly fit and this video, more than my others really makes me feel like I have had a great workout without jumping up and down. I like to mix up all the walking tapes I have because they all use different muscles to some degree.  If I had to choose just one walking tape, I think I would choose this one.  It seems to combine what I like most of all the tapes and put it into one.  I have lost 15 lbs in 2 months doing my walking tapes without changing my eating habits that much.  I recommend this video to anyone wanting a great low impact walking tape.",1111968000,,826,4.074074074074074
2069517,5,B00029IZLK,"Two years ago, I was 52 years old, a size 22, and could barely move because of  arthritis and osteoporous. My doctor recommended stretches so I bought Madeleine Lewis' AM/PM Stretch and began doing it five days per week. That worked so well, that now (at age 54) I do pilates 3 days per week, treadmill 3 days per week, cardio 2 days, and bicycle 1-2 times a week.  I am now a size 12!

I just bought Get Moving! and love it! Madeleine is a super instructor and has put together another winner! It contains four segments, three workouts and one cool down stretch, each ten minutes long. I like the fact that I can choose to do all four routines for a 40 minute workout or do only a 10 minute workout with a stretch afterwards. This DVD will work for beginners as well as Intermediates.

I have added this DVD to my weekly routine for variety. If you are older like me and need someone who can move you forward gradually in your exercise program, Madeleine Lewis is the instructor to get.",1102204800,100,987,4.318918918918919

It is a very pleasant workout.",1350086400,,331,4.015151515151516
2069520,4,B00029IZLK,"This workout was well done.  It is broken down into 4 segments.  Each segment flows together nicely.  It's challenging without being complicated.

2069522,5,B00029IZLK,"I was looking for a workout tape that wasn't too intense and didn't involve really complicated movements, but gave me a goodwork out. This tape is better than I expected. It is split into three 10 minute segments. The first 8 minutes are cardio - walking, and other movements such as leg ups, etc. The last 2 minutes of each segment work on stretching and balance. The last 10 minute segment is a cool down, which is really nice. I would really recommend this to anyone who is looking for a workout tape that isn't too difficult but will give you a good workout!",1279756800,,562,4.413461538461538
2069523,5,B00029IZLK,"I really like this video--so much that I just ordered another copy since my DVD got cracked because certain family members do not put them away properly! However, I was appalled at having to spend $50 for new or getting a used one, like a did a month or so ago, when I bought a used/like new one for $9.97 from an Amazon-related seller. Then, I found out that the EXACT SAME video has been re-released under the name ""Cardio Burn Weight Loss""--there's a picture of Madeleine Lewis in a pink shirt on the cover. You can get it directly from Amazon for $13.49, or you can get it from an Amazon-related seller, new, for as little as $3.15 + $2.98 shipping. So no need to pay a lot for the old release! As others have said, I like Madeleine Lewis' low key presentation and the background scenery is a treat. It's similar to, but a little more challenging than Leslie Sansone, whose videos I like, but sometimes I need a change. So I'd highly recommend this; just get it under the new title instead!",1265846400,3,994,4.378378378378378
2069524,5,B00029IZLK,"I  am a Leslie fan and have many of her dvd's but find them a little too easy. This video is great, it is the right amount of walking with extra umph. The moves are just a little different to keep it from being boring and it got my heart rate up so I felt great, not exhausted. I actually borrowed it from the library and liked it so much I bought it. If you like Leslie's ""boosted"" portions of her dvd's you will love this.",1262649600,,424,3.9302325581395348
2069525,5,B00029IZLK,I absolutely love this DVD. It gets my heart rate up and i sweat alot and feel like my body gets a great workout. She also has a whole ten minute stretching cool down which leaves your body feeling amazing. I do not believe anyone can go wrong with this DVD.,1259452800,,258,4.078431372549019
2069526,5,B00029IZLK,"I got this DVD not expecting much.  I work out a lot 5-6 times a week.  I do all sorts of excercises and started adding some of Leslie Sansone's videos just to top off a harder work out.  I saw this and thought I would give it a try.  I have never heard of Madeline Lewis but I must say this was a good work out.

This is slightly more advanced than leslie's but not majorly high impact.  I like that she does do toning with actual weights as opposed to belts.

The video has 3 10 minute workouts and a 10 minute stretch.  It would have been nice to have made it a good 40 minute workout but you can customize the workout to do one of the 10 nminute sessions on repeat.

As mentioned before this will get your heart pumping a little harder than Leslie's videos and one improvement I would make is that the creators of this DVD could have put in how many miles you have worked out like Leslie's but on those days you want low impact but a little more challenge this is it.",1257120000,,971,4.041884816753926
2069527,3,B00029IZLK,"SETTING:
First I must say this is probably the best setting I've seen in my fitness dvds...and I have a huge collection I've amassed over the past few years to get in a daily workout. It is a gorgeous park with willow trees, gardens, gentle lighting, and they workout under a veranda (I know it's a park because the camera panned to their feet once and you saw engraved names and phrases in the bricks like parks sell!)  It could be someone's backyard oasis otherwise. Very nice. You don't realize the setting is important til you get to experience such a nice one. If you are buying this to substitute outdoor walks on rainy days, you'll have the gorgeous outdoors now indoors and if you are buying it because you always workout indoors, you get a nice change of pace. It reminds me exactly of the imaginary fantasy setting my Wii game ""AE Sports Active"" has in their background!

CUEING & INSTRUCTION:
The cueing and instruction is simple to follow and directions are clear.

IN ADDITION TO CARDIO:
There is a tiny (and I do mean tiny)bit of strength training thrown in to the indoor walking moves and there is some nice standing ab working via twists she does during movement

QUALITY:
It's highly professionally filmed excercise dvd but the background music is more ""soothing spa-like"" than ""upbeat and energetic"" as is typical to get you revved...but that may be your taste...just pointing it out neither as a negative or a positive.

CALORIES BURNED MEASUREMENT:
That said, the caloric burn wasn't very high at all in comparison to my other dvds. I wear a bodybugg to measure my daily caloric burn and I mention this only so you know what I say is based on scientific measurement rather than percieved exertion. Because of this monitoring, I can measure exactly how many calories I burn in any workout as well as calories burned per minute with the highest accuracy...it was quite low in comparison to my other fitness dvds as well as my other walking dvds. However, if you are just starting out, this means that it's a great way to build up to a fitness routine without strain and it's also good when even more advanced exercisers would like a gentle day after a few days of more intense workouts.

TWO ALTERNATIVES THAT BURN MORE CALORIES:
1. If you like this you should like Kathy Smith's Matrix method walking dvd...a bit higher energy, some really fun moves, and higher calories burned. Although I am not fond of all her dvds, she rocks on the indoor walking ones.

2. Also try Leslie Sansone's walking dvds. She gets some nice strength training in and also has higher energy and higher calories burned in her walking dvds.

AN ALTERNATIVE THAT BURNS ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF CALORIES:
If what you are looking for is a gentle walking workout with less energy and less caloric burn and love this one and want one pretty much just like it, try ""Denise Austin's Blast Away the Pounds: Indoor Walk""

CONCLUSION:
Although the lower calorie burn on this one means I typically pair it with another workout later in the day on the days I use this one, it's still a nice light workout that offers excellent cueing and the best setting I've seen to make the workout a positive experience. Good clear and safe instructions so it's perfect for beginners but still interesting enough for someone more advanced.",1256515200,14,3308,4.670103092783505
2069528,3,B00029IZLK,I bought this thinking it would be a good walking workout - but I feel like it is closer to an aerobic excercise class! I only used the DVD once and put it up.,1255910400,,159,3.7058823529411766
2069529,5,B00029IZLK,"I've been doing this walking workout and look forward to getting up in the mornings to do it. I compare it (I know, not fair!) a lot to Leslie Sansone's walk DVDs, as I have several of hers and do them frequently.

What I like about it:
* Madeleine's cueing is on point and informative. She's not as chipper as Leslie, but that's ok, too.
* I love that it's broken up into 3 walking segments and then a 4th section for stretching. I know some other reviewers didn't like this, but it allows me to decide how much time I want to spend exercising.
* I love Leslie Sansone and credit her DVDs for getting me off the couch, but this DVD is more intense and just what I need right now
* One thing I haven't liked about Leslie's walking DVDs is that she doesn't spend enough time stretching. This DVD has a nice cool down portion and ultra-relaxing stretching that I loved.
* I usually don't care about the scenery/setting, but this one is set in a lush, woodsy kind of setting that adds to the great atmosphere.

What I didn't like about it:
* The only thing I didn't like was that the exerciser in the DVD who is supposed to be the modifier, that is, the one doing an easier version of the exercisers, was working out just as hard - even harder at times - than the exerciser who was supposed to be the more advanced one. Not a big deal to me. I was following Madeleine anyway but I thought this was odd!

Enjoy!",1219881600,5,1407,4.18450184501845
2069530,5,B00029IZLK,"I found I like this DVD better than any walking DVD I have done in the past.  I really like how the walking is increased to a faster pace several times during each segment.  Also, I like the brief exercises at the end of each segment.  This DVD is NOT for sissy, it's harder than it looks but it really give you a GREAT workout!  I highly recommend if you are bored with the other walking DVDs by other instructors.  I wish there were more DVDs like this by Madeline Lewis!!  She not CHATTY like some other instructors I know of.",1215907200,2,529,4.188118811881188

2069532,4,B00029IZLK,"I personally enjoy this workout.  I have been doing Leslie Sansone's walking DVD's and was looking for a variation.  This workout is a great alternative for someone who has been exercising for a while. I really like that you can do just one 10-minute segment at a time if you wish.

If I were new to exercise, I would definitely be frustrated and discouraged trying this DVD.  Even the lower intensity is challenging and it's definitely more difficult than Leslie's DVDs.

If you are just starting out try Leslie Sansone's DVDs first.",1212537600,,534,4.760869565217392
2069533,5,B00029IZLK,"This is an excellent workout especially if you are looking for something more aerobic than just a regular walking DVD like Leslie Sansone's Walking Off the Pounds. It's 40 minutes from start to finish and it goes by quickly. I used ankle weights (5 lbs total) and hand weights (4 lbs total) for added resistance to get a more effective cardio going. With other walking workouts, I have to use my weighted vest to get in my target zone of 145-160 but that was not needed with this workout. If you are looking for a simple walking routine, you will not want this DVD and need to stick with the WOTPs series. However, if you are looking for something more advanced but not too difficult to keep up with, this is an excellent choice. I would also recommend Walk Your Way Thin with Michelle Dozios. This DVD is also more aerobic with three different levels you can choose to follow. I also like Walk, Sculpt, and Tone with Debbie Rocker. This is a simple walking video but gets the heartrate up and the toning sections are terrific. One more favorite of mine is Walk Slim - 4 Fast Miles with Leslie Sansone. This is a far more intense WOTPs video than most of the others. I love all four of these workouts and I would rank Madeleine Lewis' right at the top as one of my favorites.",1207267200,2,1275,4.383966244725738

This is the type of exercise that will work up a sweat without injuring bum knees or over stressing the heart.  I've been doing this workout for over a year and still enjoy it several times a week.  The setting is also beautiful and has just the right touch to aid in reducing stress.

I've been doing walking/aerobic routines for a few years now and with all my CD'S I know how to increase the effectiveness of the workout by using hand weights, or intensifying the movements by light jogging and bigger moves.  So what I look for in a routine is ""likeability"" of the instructor and decent choreography/music so that the time spent doing it relatively enjoyable.  This one is at the top of my CD ""pile"" and was a welcome addition to my 30+ workout CD's! By the way folks, consistency in working out 5+ times a week is the only key to success.  I've seen dramatic improvement in fitness and weight control by working at a moderate level 5-6 times a week. There are no shortcuts to fitness -- you have to make exercising a top priority.

Madeleine Lewis is really spunky and the exercises are interesting and varied... it's not just walking like on a treadmill, but combines some easy aerobic-like moves as well.

Unfortunately, I can't select just one or two; I have to select them all for the feature to work, but I stop the DVD when I've done the ones I want.

I just did this workout for the first time tonight.  All I can say is wow!  There are three separate 10-minute workouts that you can do in any order as well as a yoga based stretch for 10 minutes.  I did the segments in order.  The intensity progresses as you complete each segment.  I broke out in a heavy sweat halfway through the second segment!  The moves are challenging and each segment has a short toning burst at the end.  You can do the toning bursts with or without weights.  I recommended doing the toning without the weights until you get used to doing the moves.  After doing all three segments, the stretch/cool down segment feels wonderful.  You really stretch your muscles and relax your body.

Madeleine's cueing and instruction is spot-on and there's no annoying chit chat like other workouts.

5 stars for an incredibly well put together workout!",1177459200,10,980,4.622093023255814
2069542,5,B00029IZLK,"Madeleine Lewis presents three ten-minute segments of walking/strength training and one ten-minute segment of stretching. The walking is creative enough to keep your attention and the choreography is fairly easy to learn. The workout is designed to take you from a warm-up to a fast-paced walk to a relaxing cool-down.

The entire forty minutes works well as a complete workout where you don't need to walk or bike before beginning the exercises. This is fairly low impact and even the reverse lunges are interesting because they are not static, but free flowing and energizing.

Madeleine Lewis' professional style and motivational cueing makes this highly enjoyable. There are also three levels to choose, so you can follow Madeleine or try some of the more advanced moves like jumping instead of just walking during various segments.

You can add weights to increase the challenge while doing lower body exercises. There are a few upper body exercises, but mostly this focuses on low-impact aerobics and lower body strength training.

2069543,5,B00029IZLK,"After using the various Walk Away the Pounds dvds for several months, I was getting bored and irritated. I found this DVD and totally fell in love with it. Madeleine is a wonderful instructor and offers only necessary instruction without the annoying chit chat. It contains four segments, three workouts and one cool down stretch, each ten minutes long. I always play the entire DVD and am still not bored with it. It's an awesome 40 minute workout that goes by very quickly. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the squats and lunges (and balancing) in between the walking workouts--it helps break up the routine. I especially love Madeleine comparing different points in the routine as getting to the top of a hill, as I know it is going to ease up soon and it gets me even more motivated.

I like the short weight segments after the walking portion of each segment, especially on those days that I know I am not going to have time for my normal weight training.",1156809600,8,344,4.276923076923077
2069545,5,B00029IZLK,This is the best DVD.  It's got me exercising almost every day and I have so much energy!  Madeline is very clear and she's very motivating.  I recommend this very highly.,1155859200,7,171,4.451612903225806
2069546,5,B00029IZLK,"I've always had trouble getting interested in excercising, but this video makes me feel good, and I can feel the burn, feel my heart rate growing, it's great! Madeleine is inspiring, she has great motivating words that keep you moving throughoutthe video! I give this video two thumbs up and five stars! I would recommend it to anyone who is just starting out and trying to get motivated!",1151712000,7,388,4.720588235294118
2069547,5,B00029IZLK,"I was frustrated with the waisted money I have spent on workout DVD's that claim to be for begginers, some were so difficult that I couldn't get past the ""warm ups""! This workout CD is different. It has 3 10 min workouts and 1 cool down and you can do all 3 and then the cool down or you can customize the workouts and do workout 1 and then the cool down. The CD has an option the cutomize your work out this way and its a great option so your not pausing to fiddle with the remote. I did workout 1 and then walked around for a min or two to slow my hear down, thats my one complaint about this cd is that is goes from the workout to the cool down without an actual segment to slow your heart rate down, you can't just stop moving and go into a stretch when your heart is pounding from the workout, so I just paused my DVD to do it my self, not a big deal, but I expected her to do it as part of the cool down. Great buy, great for begginers, I love the outdoor scenery and I like that Lewis and her side kicks aren't perkey and annoying, there just there to work out. Lewis is motivating and keeps your trying and moving.",1145836800,13,1122,3.925438596491228
8024282,5,B00029IZLK,"Get Moving is a challenging workout designed to strengthen and tone you all over. Arm exercises are included throughout so there is no separate section for upper body. The three main segments before the cool down do however include light lower body exercises.

There are four sections:

1. Walking with lower body exercises and weights - 14 minutes
2. Walking with lower body exercises - 11 minutes
3. Walking with lower body exercises - 10 minutes
4. Stretching and Cool Down - 10 minutes

Total about 45 minutes.

You can select the workouts in any order you like. However if you just want to do one workout and a cool down, you still have to select four workouts and just stop when you finish two. A little tricky but I finally figured it out.

The setting of this workout is nice with a garden atmosphere and a huge willow tree. It is nice working out in such a peaceful location.
The instruction is great throughout and the instructor is perky and energetic which keeps you motivated.

I felt this mostly in my inner and outer thighs and core. People with lower back issues or knee pain may find some of the lower body exercises challenging.

8024283,5,B00029IZLK,Great DVD but I already ordered two years ago.  I thought I was getting a new workout and this is the same as the Cardio Burn Workout (just different name and packaging)  I sent back for refund.  It is a good workout and she is easy to watch and listen to.,1473724800,,256,3.980392156862745

8024288,4,B00029IZLK,"I thought I'd add my two cents about this workout. At this point, according to VF standards, it's an ""oldie"", but I think that VFers who like walking type workouts could enjoy it. It is one that I have come back to because I lost a lot of fitness over the past year and I'm restarting my fitness efforts.

There are 3 cardio segments, ""walking"" type movements with a strength move at the end of it. And, there's a stretch. You can play the entire workout or customize it by choosing which segments you want to play.

Madeline is backed up by two exercisers, one does the ""easy"" modifications and the other does the ""harder"" modifications. Madeline, despite saying she'll be the intermediate exerciser is all over the place.

I keep this workout because it seems really well planned to me. It seems to just flow from one move to another. And, I enjoy that. I also can find it somewhat boring some days, so I keep it for the days that I'm in the mood for it.

Instructor Comments:
I really like Madeline as an instructor. She gives good form pointers and she's encouraging, but she doesn't chatter.

Warning:
Get Moving with Madeline Lewis and Cardio Burn are the same workout!  Gaiam loves to re-release workouts under different names.",1422489600,,1234,4.586363636363636
8024289,4,B00029IZLK,"Good, honest workout.  No fancy footwork.  Gets your heart rate up.  BUT Get Moving and Cardio Burn are EXACTLY THE SAME WORKOUT.",1419724800,,129,4.7727272727272725
8024290,5,B00029IZLK,"I was introduced to this workout by my cousin,we had lots of fun and was easy to follow as it had 3 different levels of fitness.
I do it everyday now in my living room which is so much easier than forcing myself to walk in the heat.
Thanks to Get Moving now I am motivated and find myself eager to do it and feel much healthier now.",1393027200,,332,3.8970588235294117
8024291,5,B00029IZLK,"Had I known I was purchasing the exact DVD I have under a different title, I would have saved my money.  It's a good DVD, but I wasted my money and wound up giving this one away.  The DVD is wonderful and I enjoy Madeleine Lewis as an instructor.  They are two other ladies performing the exercises in the workout with each doing a different level.  I would rate it as beginner to intermediate on that basis.",1382140800,,408,4.259740259740259
