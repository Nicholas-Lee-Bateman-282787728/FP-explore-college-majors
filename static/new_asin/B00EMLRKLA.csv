5927761,1,B00EMLRKLA,"Very disappointed that I waited for a ""new"" release on Nov 5th, only to watch an episode we already own from Season 2.  This is deceptive and they should offer a full refund. We love DD, but will think twice before buying a video again.",1383955200,4,236,4.2444444444444445
5927762,2,B00EMLRKLA,"I too fell for this!  I pre-ordered thinking it was new. I already have season 2 DVD & this is the finale.
It is a great show, but my rating is based from the fact that it is NOT a 2013 Christmas show.",1383955200,14,201,3.6744186046511627
5927763,5,B00EMLRKLA,The DVD is good.  The price is no friend to me.  I was greeted at my local Wal-Mart by a big display for $5 each.  I trusted Amazon to have the best price; Amazon failed me.,1383868800,2,173,3.75
5927764,5,B00EMLRKLA,REally enjoying the Duck Dynasty tv show and now having it as a set is awesome..They are funny and respectable to watch and that makes it more fun to watch.,1383868800,,156,4.233333333333333
5927765,3,B00EMLRKLA,"I pre-ordered this DVD assuming it was a new Christmas special.  It's not.  It's the season finale from season 2--  which is a great episode, don't get me wrong, I just already own it along with the rest of season 2.  If you do NOT own season 2 then do yourself a favor and get the whole season for $3.00 more than this ONE episode.  So disappointing.",1383696000,51,351,4.17910447761194
5927766,2,B00EMLRKLA,.This Episode is good but I fell victim to their greed and bought this unaware that it was a repackaging of an episode I already owned.,1383696000,32,135,4.230769230769231
5927767,2,B00EMLRKLA,"After doing some digging, I've found that this is indeed the season two finale, packaged and sold as a stand alone for the holidays.

First let me say that it's a fun episode and runs longer than the standard episodes.  I consider myself a DD fan, but since I already have season two, I wouldn't consider getting this.  My rating here is more a reflection of the price value than the actual content.

I'd also have a hard time recommending it as a purchase for someone else since you can get the entire season 2 DVD for only a few dollars more than the current asking price ($6.99).  At the time of this review the full season is listed at $9.99, so that's just three bucks more for 12 other episodes.  And for the more digital minded, the season two HD digital download episode would be slightly cheaper as well.

I was hopeful this would be new Christmas content, but maybe that will come at the end of the current season (4).  For now I'd recommend to go for the recently released Duck The Halls CD and/or the entire season 2 set.  Both would bring much more DD entertainment value.",1383609600,107,1085,4.385
5927768,3,B00EMLRKLA,"Is this a just a repackaging of season 2, episode 13? As of this date, no running time or contents are listed on Amazon. Could it be an A&E trick to get more sales??? I've already got season 2, so I'm gonna hold off pre-ordering this one and see what shakes...it was a cool hour show though, hate to give it a 3 rating but ...???",1383523200,11,329,4.0

5927963,3,B00EMLRKLA,"Getting a little tired of these guys, and I am also very weary of hearing about how rich they are. I could really give a rat's you-know-what! I will give the show two stars, however, for the entertainment factor only.

Firstly, I believe their so-called worth is over-inflated, over-exaggerated, and not anywhere near the truth. At an average of $40 a pop for a duck call, especially when there is no need for a hunter to continue replacing them on a regular basis, the numbers simply don't add up to millions upon millions upon millions. If a million hunters all bought Duck Commander brand duck calls, that would equal $40 million. However, three things come into play here. Not ALL hunters hunt duck. As a matter of fact, most hunt deer. Duck calls rarely need to be replaced, so there are very few repeat buyers, AND there are other brands out there. Duck Commander is not a monopoly. There are also product costs, marketing costs, overhead costs, payroll costs, insurance costs, tax, etc., etc., etc. Sorry, folks, those are the numbers. These guys aren't as rich as they'll have you believe.

Secondly, and even more glaring, is that not ONE of them has a lick of business sense. They make serious professional mistakes and blunders in every episode--one after another, after another, after another, after another, after another ...

There is no possible way to make that kind of money when you do not receive dedication and respect from your employed staff. I never see the workers buckling down and getting to business. They're always pushing against the grain, causing upheaval, and defiling themselves and their employer. The neighbors and town-folk even have to come in to help, sometimes, because, instead of dutifully performing their required tasks, the idiots in the work area are out making a redneck theme park or drinking beer, while on the clock, and soaking in a pick-up bed swimming pool, or driving a sleeping, bearded crazy-man in a trailer out into the middle of the woods. (That was a lie, by the way. Unless he was drugged, there is no way he could have remained asleep with all that jostling around. Trailers are VERY bouncy).

When you are making millions, there is no time or place for those types of shenanigans. These sorts of behaviors in business do not make millionaires, friends. I would have fired each and every one of them a long, long time ago, especially the boss-Robertson, who lacks any and all authority. He is a pushover in the midst of ill-placed dissension.

I have an MS in business administration and management. I know from experience that this whole show is a big joke, and there isn't a lick of truth behind their income claims.

One last note: If they were so darn rich, they wouldn't have to rely on public/fan-misleading, cash-grabs like this release. The whole thing can be seen on the Season Two release. It's all smoke & mirrors.

Lastly, to candy-coat the misbehavior by having some quiet prayer around a dinner table for ten or fifteen seconds at the end of each sin-loaded episode is hypocritical. As the bible says, people, ""It is better to be hot or cold, than to be lukewarm."" Flaunting wealth goes against all Christian values.

Two stars for the entertainment factor only. Don't believe the lies.",1384992000,4,3261,4.790035587188612
