7765453,5,B01GQIKLHG,"I went in to this movie, not expecting very much. I assumed from the trailers that it would be another regular cookie-cutter ABC family movie that I have seen 100 other times, but I was mistaken. Just minutes into this masterpiece I realized just how wrong I was. The acting was top notch, comparable to movies that are winning grammies. I was blown away by the dedication to emotion and the passionate connections between characters. The movie was well paced, and actually makes you feel like you are apart of a modern day cinderella tale. Completely believable plot line, and honestly felt more like a documentary. The character development gave me chills, never have I before been transported through such committed and pure acting skill. Truly astonishing. I was sobbing by the ending scene, and haven't stopped crying for 3 hours. I would highly recommend this to any viewers looking for a heartwarming, gritty, and new-age take on a classic tale.",1471305600,5,952,4.919254658385094

7765472,5,B01GQIKLHG,"Cute movie, the kids love it. It's pretty much the same story line as all the other ""Cinderella"" movies but
it does have a little different twist. It's all about the music and dancing anyway. Glad to add it to the kid
movies. G.C.P.",1481932800,,232,4.295454545454546

7765475,4,B01GQIKLHG,"If you're a grown-up I guess you have to have young nieces that you babysit occasionally to know that A CINDERELLA STORY has become a franchise. 2016's A CINDERELLA STORY: IF THE SHOE FITS is the fourth and the latest, and it follows that familiar plotline. Tessa (Sofia Carson) is the sweet, long-suffering, subservient girl who at last goes behind her wicked step-mother's back to achieve her dreams. What I like about this particular Cinderella, Tessa, is not that she can sing or dance or that she's kind, but that she's a gearhead. Tessa's dad was a race car driver, and so Tessa'd been around cars all her life, and she's picked up a thing or two. Today, she's a gifted car mechanic. It's a quality that grounds her more than the other Cinderellas. You think being able to fix cars would land her a better room than that tiny closet under the stairs complete with the metal door/gate that locks from the outside (like that's not gonna factor in the story later on).

You should know that IF THE SHOE FITS persists in the campy, over-the-top tone of the previous movies. The humor is broad. It achieves vaudevillian levels of ridiculous. The crux of the story revolves around Tessa's auditioning in disguise - because her step-mother would've shut this down quick - in a casting call for a live musical play about Cinderella. A recording contract is up for grabs, as is the plum part of Cinderella and the opportunity to co-star with pop sensation Reed West (Thomas Law) who will play Prince Charming. Of course, the vile step-mother, Divine (Jennifer Tilly), had brought Tessa's vacuous step-sisters, Athena (Amy Louise Wilson) and Olympia (Jazzara Jaslyn), to also try out. I guess it's not enough shine that their ma had told them they're third cousins with Madonna, twice removed.

Exit Tessa, and enter, uh, Bella Snow, the blonde(-wigged) talent sporting a creaky British accent (""Cheers! God save the Queen... in London... where I'm from.""). Her excuse for being late to the audition? ""It's a bloody shame the trolley broke."" And when asked by Reed West what part of England she's from - because Reed is a genuine Brit - the quick-thinking ""Bella"" says she's from ""Yorkshirepuddingshire"" which is within spitting distance of ""Hogwartsshire."" Huh. Okay, maybe not so quick-thinking. Anyway, Bella wows Reed in her audition.

As intoxicating as Bella is, Reed surprisingly finds himself seeking the company of a certain gearhead. See, Reed and Tessa had crossed paths earlier when Tessa fixed his motorcycle. And it's mutual interest. Because Reed turns out to be a really nice guy, and real.

Of course, the obstacles. Mainly, Tessa's step-relations, all three of whom have sussed out that there's something suspicious about Bella Snow. And there's Tessa having to keep up the charade and having to be in three places at the same time (rehearsing as Bella, hanging with Reed, schlepping for the step-heels). Another problem: Reed is dating a celebrity heiress. Thank goodness for make-up artist Georgie (Nicole Fortuin) who easily steps into the fairy godmother role.

Note that this movie, like the first two sequels, is a musical. It's helmed and choreographed by first-time director Michelle Johnston who also choreographed and co-produced the three previous A CINDERELLA STORY pictures. I don't blame her that I didn't think too much of the songs and dance numbers. It's typical Disney fare, most of which is not my jam. But props to the cast and extras for being so enthusiastic in those numbers.

3.5 out of 5 stars. The two leads are pretty nice. Disney viewers will know Sofia Carson from playing Evie in Descendants. I don't know Thomas Law from Bonar Law, but he and Sofia are good in their scenes together. And the both of them do their own singing and dancing, so extra propers to 'em. IF THE SHOE FITS is not at all meant to be taken seriously. It's tongue-in-cheek and goofy and sometimes the humor gets gross. But it's hard to muster outrage when the mean girl who mistakes bird poop for sunscreen lotion - and rubs it all over her face - is so well-deserving. I liked A CINDERELLA STORY: IF THE SHOE FITS. It's not my favorite; that'd be A CINDERELLA STORY: ONCE UPON A SONG with Lucy Hale. But it's a fun diversion, and Sofia Carson carries the movie with grace and spirit and a winning personality. How can you not cheer on a girl who paints cherry blossoms on her sneakers - or if we're carrying on with the pretense - then, trainers?

If you're curious about the previous A CINDERELLA STORY flicks, here's a DVD set that collects those first three:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Cinderella-Story-Another-Cinderella-Story-A-Cinderella-Story-Once-Upon-a-Song-Triple-Feature/dp/B006X08DZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Cinderella Story / Another Cinderella Story / A Cinderella Story: Once Upon a Song (Triple Feature)</a>.",1480982400,,4897,5.060718711276332
