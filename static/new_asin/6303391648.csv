638317,4,6303391648,Irene Cara & Tatum O'Neal did great in this film & worked great together.,1434153600,,73,4.285714285714286
638318,4,6303391648,"Ever since I first saw this movie, It really fascinated me for some reason despite its flaws. I was so stunned that after all these years of it getting s*** on, its nice to see that this film is slowing getting respect. I think one of the reasons why I'm so fascinated with this movie is because of the chemistry between O'neal and Cara. I thought they really worked well with one another despite how flawed the script was.  In my opinion,  I think of this as the first glimpse close to a female buddy action movie than ""The Heat"" with Sandra Bullock and Melissa Mccarthy. In my opinion, O'Neal and Cara did it first and I think maybe thats why people like the film more today . I hope O'Neal and Cara will reunite on the screen again maybe hopefully a sequel despite that this film didn't do well. if they do it, I can see Scarlet now as a cop and reunites with Tracy after 20 years since the first film where Tracy is a district attorney and they create a small unit where they both investigate ""Certain"" Specific cases and they nick-name their little unit: The ""Certain Fury"" Justice Unit. SO, its like Cagney and Lacey meets Lethal Weapon. I whether see that then a stupid reboot to Lethal Weapon which I hear their doing. Screw that. BRING ON CERTAIN FURY 2!!!!",1403654400,10,1266,4.382978723404255

638320,4,6303391648,Bought this for a friend who had been looking for it for a couple of years. It being used was no problem. It played well and that was all that mattered to her. She was thrilled to be able to see a movie she had longed to see.,1352332800,3,225,3.7083333333333335
638321,4,6303391648,"I kind of gave this movie 4 stars, although i should give it three star! You can not really find this movie on DVD! I gave it four stars just for the simple fact that I like the action that was taken place in this film! The movie was just all good to me! I also like Ms. Irene Cara and can't forget Tatum O'Neal! This movie was ok! It shows a little action, but it is not enough to earn 5 stars and i quote. But i really give this movie a play! Thanks Amazon!

638322,1,6303391648,"This film directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal is only interesting in that it presents two female protagonists, pre-empting his later preference for female actors, eg Barbara Hershey. There is enough rough housing - beatings, rape, fire, flood, rats, drugs, chase, guns - for action fans and the dramatic plot doesn't slow things down too much. However given that the main characters are female, screenwriter Michael Jacobs unfortunately subjects them both to extended humiliations.
The incident which sets Irene Cara and Tatum O'Neal on the lam is poorly if campily staged, a courtroom gunbattle where the police are exposed as clods, and the idea that they have no reason to run since they are not responsible for the gunfire is soon dubiously rationalised by the death of a pursuing policeman.
Jacobs idea of social commentary is having Moses Gunn as Cara's doctor father pontificating ""I can go into an operating room, take out the bad part, and it's healed. How do you cut this off?"". There is also a laugh line in response to his tale of Cara retreating to her room upon her mother's death with ""You probably didn't realise how serious it was"". Plus having two women trying to survive in the sleazy underworld, it's no surprise how many times they are referred to as ""witch"".
The inverted casting of O'Neal as a streetkid and Cara as a middle class student is unexpected, though O'Neal is hardly convincing, given her face and pedigree. Her slumming only extends to having dyed her hair red to go with her name Scarlett, and swearing. Cara is the stronger performer though has little material to shine with - the best she can do is sing the title song over the credits, which she co-wrote. Peter Fonda has one scene with O'Neal, where he calls her a ""spoilt little girl"", and  which ends in disfigurement.
We aren't told about O'Neal's past, how long she has been on the street, and this then makes us question the glamour photo of her that appears in the newspaper. However Gyllenhaal creates an atmospheric candle-lit drug palace, even if we are told it's a place where guns are prohibited, and where someone who has molested one of the heroines and tried to kill the other is suddenly shown concern for a hot predicament.",1005004800,7,2224,4.791666666666667

7845421,5,6303391648,A little cheesy at times but all around fun.  This 80's film has a opening that is bloodier than some of the slasher films of the 80's.  There are a few loop holes in the story but Tatum O'Neal and Irene Cara are good in their roles.  Never a fan of Peter Fonda and he looks creepy and plays a creep!,1504656000,2,300,3.8852459016393444

7845425,5,6303391648,Tatum O'Neal rocks on this low hudget film...her & Irene Cara steal the show as fugitives trying to find justice as they are on the run from the law for a crime they did not commit....5 stars,1490054400,,191,4.1891891891891895
7845426,4,6303391648,"Entertaining trash that features an almost non stop barrage of chase scenes. Tatum O' Neal (""Paper Moon"") and Irene Cara (""Fame"") are fun to watch as two women on the run from the cops (and just about everybody else), for a bloody murder and shootout in a courtroom that they had nothing to do with. Talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time!  Underground sewers, a drug den, and a bridge in the middle of nowhere are just a few of the action set pieces where the two are forced to run their lives. Directed by Jake Gyllenhaall's father---I can't wait to see this again in glorious hi-def. One of the best ""trashy"" action movies ever made!",1482192000,6,651,4.425
