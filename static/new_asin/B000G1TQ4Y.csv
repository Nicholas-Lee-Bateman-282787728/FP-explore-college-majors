8128600,5,B000G1TQ4Y,Very helpful in my review & practice of tae kwon do! DVDs on the palgwe forms are difficult to find.  These are the forms I was trained in!,1442707200,,139,3.9642857142857144
8128601,5,B000G1TQ4Y,"I've seen and used quite a few video's to help me learn my forms, but this one is head-and-shoulders above the rest.  It is well worth your time and investment to get this one if you are serious about learning your forms. It breaks them down, step-by-step, so you can learn them correctly the *first* time.",1165968000,3,306,4.464285714285714
8128602,5,B000G1TQ4Y,"This is an excellent source for those who wish to improve their taekwondo forms. Mr. Rosbarsky shows the forms in full competition speed, step by step and it even shows it step by step from two different view points at the same time with the instruction written in text on the screen so you can easily pause the video and do it yourself. A great resource! My only quibble is that sometimes the sound is a little bit quiet when Mr. Rosbarsky is speaking. I wish I had this video when I was learning my forms!",1160265600,4,507,4.291666666666667
