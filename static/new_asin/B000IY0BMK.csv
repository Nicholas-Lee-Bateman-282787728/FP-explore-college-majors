There are some short performances included also of Buddy Knox when on leave from the Army. Some from movies & others from variety shows on TV.Great to see artists in their heyday doing their songs. Of course,there is lip-syncing on some tracks,but live cuts also. Seller A+-quick delivery.",1252713600,2,391,4.9393939393939394
8147662,4,B000IY0BMK,"This DVD is packed with dozens of (mostly) complete performances from Rock & Roll's early years. I have a pretty extensive collection of music videos, and many of these clips I had never seen before. Most of these performances are live, with a few being lip-synced. The only shortcoming is that the picture quality is inconsistent, with some clips being crisp and sharp, and others being grainy, faded, or copied from videotape several generations removed from the original master. While this may be understandable with many rare kinescopes, it's hard to understand why faded, washed out prints of several Scopitone/Soundies performances were used when excellent quality prints exist, and have been shown on the AMC network in recent years. Nevertheless, I can recommend this DVD to fans and collectors of 50's and early 60's Rock & Roll, because, you won't find most of these clips anywhere else (I know, I've looked).
