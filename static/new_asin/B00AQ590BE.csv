8556059,5,B00AQ590BE,"Weird story here. I bought this DVD for ""Cradle Will Rock"" a terrific movie I knew, and wanted a copy of. While looking for a place to store it, I found the copy I already had but could not find when I looked for it previously. (-8

So I watched ""Duets"" and found it to be an equally terrific, offbeat, serio-comedy, which I recommend to all.

A little while later, I watched ""South Pacific"", expecting it to be moderately entertaining, like ell the other productions I've seen, and was totally amazed by the overwhelming excellence of this newer version; production values, screenplay, casting, acting, direction, all a cut above anything I've ever seen for this story. I will watch it again sometime.

And I am looking forward to watching ""cradle Will rock"" for the third or fourth time over a few years. It is a great telling of a true story.",1390867200,5,845,4.582781456953643
