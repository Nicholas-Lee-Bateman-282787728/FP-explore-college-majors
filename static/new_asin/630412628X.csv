8190549,4,630412628X,"Karate Cop is one of those rare films that boarder on the side of awful fun. Low budget and old plot are the first downfalls of this film. A great  scene in this film is when the Asian cop and his African-American partner  come out of a bar totally intoxicated. The both men head for home - walking  their separate ways. The African-American cop is ambushed - and proceeds to  run about 15 miles in five minutes. He follows this up with what seems like  5000 punches, kicks and whatever else fills time until he finally gets it -  he's killed. I still think that he died of exhaustion rather than brutal  force of the men chasing him. Remember that this guy was totally plastered  coming out of the bar and out of nowhere he turns into Bruce Jenner! Add to  this dubbing of all dialogs and you'll realize why you can't get this on  DVD. I found this movie to be fun, incredibly awful fun...this is a great  Sunday afternoon movie to watch with your friends.",966988800,2,957,4.350282485875706

8190551,2,630412628X,"This is a Hong Kong-made film, starring an actor named Don Wong as a Chinese-American cop in San Francisco (one of the other titles is ""Slaughter in San Francisco"") who is, of course, highly skilled  in the martial arts.  He is propositioned by crime boss Chuck Norris (in  his second and final villainous role) to work for him as an enforcer.  When  Wong refuses, the trouble begins.  The fight scenes are not the calibur of  Norris, Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan, with the exception of the final duel  between Norris and Wong.  Chuck Norris fans should see.  Others needn't  bother.  Also known as ""Yellow Faced Tiger.""  God knows how many  other labels have been taped onto this one.",928368000,3,681,4.661016949152542
