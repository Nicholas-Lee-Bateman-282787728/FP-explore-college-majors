5878296,5,B00DY951Z8,"I purchased for my Dad and he loves it.  I'm glad it's on DVD rather than the usual VHS option.  It's a combination of former Christmas shows and having the old gang introduce segments of those old shows.  It's nicely done and although there is nothing like watching the original shows, we enjoyed this DVD as a Christmas Reunion.",1454371200,4,330,4.559322033898305
