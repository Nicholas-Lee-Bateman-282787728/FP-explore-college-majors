327067,5,6301394429,"Great job telling the story of the American Indians and how they were treated.  It deals with Gen. Howard going beyond his own personal convictions to ""follow orders""  As a U.S. history teacher it vividly shows my students the struggle of the Indians, as well as the struggle of those who wanted them to be left alone.",1164672000,16,318,4.56140350877193

327069,5,6301394429,"It was wonderful to watch this tragic story....wonderful in that the story is truth in the face of our corporate masters tidal wave of Orwellian propaganda. We never hear of OUR terrorism in Gaza, Chile, Phillipines, East Timor, El Salvador, Dresden, Tokyo etc.....I'm shocked to see some truth about the manner in which our barbaric white society slaughtered the tribes who taught us the meaning of Democracy. There are a million stories just like this one that could be told, about American terrorism....I wish they'd all be told....then ignorance would no longer be a valid excuse for our society's disgusting behavior.",1093824000,15,622,5.1683168316831685
327070,4,6301394429,"First of all, I don't know why some reviewers say this film has Kevin Costner & Graham Greene; it stars James Whitmore, Sam Elliot, & Ned Romero as Chief Joseph. This is an accurate, historical telling of the removal of the Nez Perce tribe to reservation land in 1877. When this peaceful tribe attempts to resist the forced removal by travelling to Canada, they are pursued & eventually captured by the military, led by General Otis Howard--a former friend of Joseph(well-played by James Whitmore). This movie is by no means of Oscar-winning calabre. It's a semi-documentary story of a significant event in American History. It is slow at times. The acting is adequate but by no means just wonderful. As a history teacher, I like this movie & it's story--a good story at that. Also, it was made for TV in 1975--it is dated. Movies today on TV are more violent with all sorts of cursing; this movie does not overdo the violence or cursing at all.  It's ""good & clean"" family fare. I highly recommend it for its true story and respectable portrayal of Native Americans.",1039651200,85,1067,4.705882352941177
327071,3,6301394429,"It would have been nice if Costner and G.Greene could have worked a bit of their magic on this one. For those who are unfamiliar with the Great Chief Joseph and the plight of the Nez Perce Peoples...This would be a good eye opener to that beginning of your education. The acting isn't the best...I hope this movie gets remade.....There's a good story that needs to be told here.......For ""We The People"".",986601600,2,404,4.625
327072,1,6301394429,"I viewed this film as part of my Washington State History Class. I watched the unfortuneate actors deliver their sad diologue, and could almost see the pain on their face, caused no doubt by the act of uttering such drivel.  The diologue is awful, the premise is true, of course, but so poorly  scripted and acted out that if I hadn't known better I would have thought  this a comedy. The Indian garments of the Nez Perce are ridiculous, and  amazingly every one of the Indians speaks fluent English. The portrayel of  Cheif Joseph is sad, a sullen James Whitmore speaks slowly, in halting  English. He tries to act outraged and\or sad, but looks rather pathetic  doing it. This film is quite amatuerish and not worthy of more than a  passing glance. Obviously done on a shoestring budget,(which would explain  the poor actors and script-writers), ""I will Fight no More  Forever"" is a sad, rather pathetic little picture. I don't advise  renting or, God Forbid, buying it.",928886400,10,972,4.7604790419161676

327143,5,6301394429,This is one of the most heartbreaking stories I have watch. To watch the indians get pushed off their lands by greedy white men were horrrible. Chief Joseph didn't won't to fight but his people did. And they lost. The truth is told is how white men pushed around the indians and anybody they had power over. A truly sad beautiful movie of a chief and his people who wanted to be left alone. Finally a true story telling how the indians were robbed.,1296604800,2,448,4.345238095238095

327234,5,6301394429,"This film should be reviewed in two parts; The first for its subject matter, and the second; for its cinematic qualities. The latter being irrelevant, due to the nature of its historical content.

American western films often portrayed the Native American Indians as the enemy or as uncivilized savages, but that all changed in 1970, with the release of ""Little Big Man"" (starring Dustin Hoffman in the title role). In each year previous, dozens and dozens of western movies had been released each year, but after 1970 and the release of Little Big Man, Hollywood decided that either it wasn't economically viable to continue making western films, in its prior traditional format, or it was more trouble than its worth to try and depict the Old West as it really was. The end result was that Hollywood has released few westerns after Little Big Man, but the majority of those that have been released, are often far more sympathetic to the reality of the west, as it actually was, during the 19th century.

Those Indian tribes of the Northwest, referred to as the Nez Pearce, was a name coined by the early French trappers (Nez Pearce meaning Pearced Noses), but the tribes, those that followed Chief Joseph and others, called themselves the Wallowa Indians.

Chief Joseph the younger (his father was also Chief Joseph), was more than just a tribal Chief, that fought the US Army, but in reality was truly an American Hero that has never really been correctly depicted in our schools and history books.

In 1873, Chief Joseph had negotiated a peace with the Army, allowing them (the Wallowas) to stay on their ancestral lands (the Wallowa mountains and Wallowa Valley of northeastern Oregon and southeastern Washington), but in the year following the Battle of the Little Big Horn (June 25th, 1876), and the defeat of Colonel Custer and 245 members of the Army's 7th Calvary, many of the US Government's former policies changed. Including those policies regarding ""non-treaty"" Indians of Oregon and Washington.

When Joseph made council with General Howard, he reluctly agreed to move his people from the Wallowas and onto the reservation in Idaho, but ended his meeting with the statement: ""It is my disbelief that the Great Spirit Chief gave one kind of men the right to tell another kind of men what they must do.""

General Howard took this statement, by Joseph, as a direct afront to his authority and demanded that the Nez Pearce non-treaty Indians vacate the Wallowa Valley, within 30 days, and if they were still there on day 31, this would be considered an act of war!

Though Chief Joseph advocated peace over war (sort of an early day pacifist), several young braves had taken it upon themselves to attack and kill 4 white settlers, Chief Joseph then knew that an attack, by General Howard, would happen any moment.

Rather than attempt to negotiate further, Chief Joseph gathered the 800 members (almost entirely made of elderly, women, and children) of his tribe and began a 3-month long running battle with the US Army, all in an attempt to escape the US territories and make it into Canada to join up with the Hunkpapa Medicine Chief, Sitting Bull. During their 3-month flight, the Wallowa tribe, under Chief Joseph covered 1,700 miles and the defensive tactics the Wallowas used are still taught today at West Point.

Less than 40 miles from the Canadian border, the weather turned on Joseph and the surviving Wallowas, but after only a few days of rest, believing they had several weeks before General Howard would catch up, Chief Joseph and his Wallowa tribe were attacked from the North by General Miles, something unforeseen by Chief Joseph.

The actual translation of Chief Joseph's surrender agreement read:

""Tell General Howard I know his heart. What he told me before, I have it in my heart. I am tired of fighting. Our chiefs are killed; Looking Glass is dead, Too-hul-hul-sote is dead. The old men are all dead. It is the young men who say yes or no. He who led on the young men is dead. It is cold, and we have no blankets; the little children are freezing to death. My people, some of them, have run away to the hills, and have no blankets, no food. No one knows where they are--perhaps freezing to death. I want to have time to look for my children, and see how many of them I can find. Maybe I shall find them among the dead. Hear me, my chiefs! I am tired; my heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.""

After the surrender, the surviving Wallowas, along with Chief Joseph, were eventually returned to the reservation in Idaho.

Chief Joseph spent the remaining 25 years of his life, often stating that it was his desire that the injustice of the United States policy toward his people would be corrected and held out the hope that America's promise of freedom and equality might one day be fulfilled for all Native Americans as well. Chief Joseph died in 1904, never having seen the sacred lands of his ancestors again. His attending doctor said that Chief Joseph died ""of a broken heart"".

Though this film is over 35 years old, if viewed as a documentary, rather than a hollywood movie, I believe you will enjoy it much more.

There is a credible rumor that Steven Speilberg is considering a run of miniseries, chronicling ""Great American Heroes"" and the life of Chief Joseph and Wallowa Indians would be his first release. This series of TV miniseries' would be in the same format as his (Speilberg) ""Into The West"" miniseries of a few years ago.",1246579200,,5522,4.725571725571726
327235,4,6301394429,"This movie retraces a crucial episode of the Nez Perce Indians' history, at a time when the Native Americans were forcibly relocated to reservations. Very informative and really entertaining. We are truly moved by Chief Joseph's decision to surrender so as to spare the lives of the children and by the white soldiers' sympathy for him.",1217203200,2,336,5.017857142857143
327236,3,6301394429,"This almost comes across as more of a documentary than a movie. With the narration I found myself thinking I might be on the History Channel. It does in fact give a fairly accurate account of the trials of the Nez Perce in trying to find a way to deal with the influx of settlers to their hunting grounds. Since the US Calvary was given the task to round all Native Americans up and put them on a reservation and many European settlers didn't care about their rights, it was often done with a heavy hand. This is not an easy movie to watch as you will see cruelty and killing, but it is a historically educational movie that everyone should see at least once. Parts of it are fascinating as we see Chief Joseph lead the Calvary for a merry chase through several areas of Iowa and adjoining states, but sometimes it drags a little. Good quality DVD with limited replay. I recommend this as a rental first before purchasing.",1212451200,,922,4.39766081871345
327237,4,6301394429,"I am a high school teacher, ELL, and have been showing this video for the past few years as we study in our text, the NezPerce removal from their lands, by the government.
My students, who are new to this country, tell me the readings in our text come to life when visualized. Yes, there are some severe scenes of violence, shootings, but this is the reality of the history.
Do prepare your students first by reading about Chief Joseph and his people before viewing. I also use a story map, graphic organizer, while the students are viewing, which then we develop into a book report.

327242,4,6301394429,"This film has been a long time coming. Chief Joseph was a charismatic figure who was articulate, intelligent and a wise leader. He found himself, along with many other tribal chiefs in a situation not of his making and about which he could do very little in the long term.

A man who respected the earth and deeply loved the lands in which the Nez Perce lived, he fought hard for his people but inevitably lost the war,gaining however, the respect and admiration of many Americans as the

flight of the Nez Perce towards Canada became known.

His many famous speeches and his profound wisdom put him on a level with Chief Seattle. This film is a good portrait of him and explains well the background and general history of the Nez Perce struggle. It also portrays aptly the difficulties for the pursuing army and explores the attitudes among the higher officers toward the Indians. It is not an overpolished or slick film, and this adds to the feeling of authenticity.

7811381,5,6301394429,"This is a great movie, the DVD just needs to be up-dated. Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce Tribe did not want to be located on a reservation, so they were on a flight fighting with General Howard, Miles and the Troops. They left from Idaho/Oregon through Cama prairie in Idaho, through Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming and on to Montana. Almost make it to Canada, 40 miles from the border and they were capture with a few woman and children left, Chief Joseph stayed with his people. No matter what happen, Chief Joseph never left his people. Remember they also traveled with 2,000 horses too. I admire the Nez Perce, they were of great horsemanship and knowing for the Appaloosa  History has it that Chief Joseph and his people, after they were captured were transfered to South Dakota, Kansas, then on to Oklahoma before years later they were returned to the Northwest, but Chief Joseph never return to his home in Wallowa Valley land in Oregon, instead the government put him on Colville Indian Reservation, Nespelem, Washington State. Now, Chief Joseph is part of history and the Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho, they fought to the end.
