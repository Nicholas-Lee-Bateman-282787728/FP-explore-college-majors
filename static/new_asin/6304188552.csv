7865599,5,6304188552,"Starting in 1921 with the return to his homeland after many years in Europe, this marvelous film gives those of us who haven't had the opportunity to view these amazing masterpieces in person, a glimpse as to the size and scope of these frescoes.
I was fascinated to learn, and see by examples, the influence that Italian Renaissance painting had on his work. In the use of perspective, and the way certain figures are posed, one can see the relationship between Rivera and the Italian Masters, but he transformed it into an art that is 100 % Mexican.
Written by Michael Camerini (who also directed) and Stanton L. Catlin, it's well narrated by Michael Moriarty, with his calm and lovely voice. This terrific video (it feels way too short at 35 minutes in length) will inspire and give you a lot to think about if you're an artist, and will be a treat for those that appreciate the genius of Diego Rivera.",977702400,14,905,4.592592592592593
