1787076,5,B00006LPDT,"Truely a very good dvd, especially for someone like me who doesn't especially likes to watch concerts at home...no the great thing is that you can watch it once or twice-and see Ian astbury's new rap-metal attitude-and then just listen to it(tv off) as the only true live recording of the cult since the lyceum or the hard-to-get Live at the Marquee.
The sound is excellent, the playlist mostly based on new material and songs from ELECTRIC is very heavy and consistant- amazing versions of BREATHE and LOVE REMOVAL MACHINE.
THE CULT is a real rock'n'roll machine on stage, and like I said the tracklisting , the sound but also the performance is one of their best-I own all official live recordings and some bootlegs, and trust me it hasn't always been that great!
If you don't like their last album you still might wanna reconsider your opinion, LIVE, those songs reach a higher level of energy!
Also features some classics like she sells sanctuary, The Witch, Fire Woman, Sweet soul sister, Rain...
Best CULT LIVE ever released and maybe also the last so you(we)better enjoy this one!",1038441600,4,1087,4.787234042553192
1787086,5,B00006LPDT,"I will start with this. This is a Live recorded concert. The sounds are live recordings. Appears the mix may have been alittle off. You cannot go wrong with Billy's guitar playing. Great to see Matt Sorum playing the drums. I know nothing of Mike Dimkich or Billy Morrison but they were holding their own during this show. If you are a Cult fan pick it up but do not forget it is a live recording. The set list is solid. Be prepared to list to Ian ask the crowd over and over ""are you ready?""",1252540800,,492,4.135416666666667
1787087,1,B00006LPDT,"I have listened to The Cult for many years and enjoy many of their studio songs a lot. Ian Astbury's lyrics are often very cool, unique and strangely poignant: ""Time hustles those who wait to die."" ""You've got to bleed a little while you sing... less the words don't mean a thing."" Often they are intriguingly ambiguous-- Ciao Baby seems to be his song to/about a woman he cared deeply for but who had committed suicide. When this concept is combined with the emotion of Ian's uniquely stirring vocals and Billy Duffey's tasteful, driving Les Paul powered riffs results in a strangely romantic, very emotional song (I could be way off on the intent of this song... this sort of ambiguity has fueled some of rock music's most lasting works). I love that Billy Duffy plays a Les Paul-- the coolest rock and rock/blues guitar in the world. Now that you know I really appreciate The Cult's music... In this live performance, the vocals are not nearly as powerful and stirring as in any of the studio recordings they have produced on CD. Billy Duffey's guitar playing is very disappointing to say the least. He does however still look like a rock-and-roll stud with that Les Paul. As a 45-year-old hard rocker since my early teens, I view public profanity as a demonstration of ignorance and stupidity as well as a lack of respect for the audience. I can tolerate occasional profanities during a high-energy performance (although true rock professionals don't need them) but in this show Ian comes across as a hateful, loud mouthed, vulgar punk. I threw this DVD in the trash and am trying to forget it as I go on enjoying the awesome music they produced in the studio.",1229040000,3,1664,4.6825938566552905
1787088,3,B00006LPDT,"As another reviewer mentions, the crowd seems subdued, which takes some of the energy away from the performance. Ian tries to inspire them, but he tends to sound corny with his lectures and cajoling. It also would help if he put more energy into some of the songs - Fire Woman is lackluster at best. However, the newer songs sound fresh and he is clearly more into them. Billy never moves around a lot, but his riffs are still the center of attention. Even with the inconsistent performance, I still enjoyed the DVD. I also appreciate the longer camera shots - I really hate when concerts are edited such that the shot switches every 2 seconds.",1196726400,,644,4.560344827586207
1787089,5,B00006LPDT,"This is SUCH a good Concert and Ian does a superb job. He is full of energy and sounds absolutely great!!! He is a total powerhouse performer and anyone who thinks the music at a concert should sound like the music on a record/cd should stick to those. A Concert environment is so much more energetic and exciting than a record that I wonder why you would want it to sound the same (to those complaining about not every single lyric being sung and not sung exactly in the same way as the record, come on people) Ian looks and sounds  fabulous and seems so sincerely grateful to fans for supporting the band through all these years and allowing them to do what they love. The Cult is the Best!!!",1192838400,2,694,4.338461538461538
1787090,4,B00006LPDT,"I just recorded this show in HD from HDnet on cable, then checked out this DVD via Netflix. Killer show, but this DVD version of the Olympic show pales in comparison video quality-wise with the HD version now playing on cable...too bad they can't release the HD version on DVD as well.",1189296000,2,285,4.5
1787091,5,B00006LPDT,"The Cult are an amazing rock band, one of the best actually.  This dvd showcases how good they are in the live atmosphere.  A great addition to anyone's music or Cult collection.  ROCK ON!",1180051200,,188,4.470588235294118
1787092,5,B00006LPDT,"I often throw this DVD in during my work-outs, and I love it every time.  I know good singing and good playing when I hear it, and Ian's voice is fine- through the whole DVD.  No barking.  No pitch problems.  I've seen them in concert and I only wish the light show and stage were as cool as in this DVD show.  The low ratings are few and far between.  That should tell you something.",1173052800,3,384,4.053333333333334
1787093,5,B00006LPDT,The DVD is great. If you are a Cult fan this is a must,1169337600,,54,2.9285714285714284
1787094,3,B00006LPDT,Singer don't sing like on the cd's. He is showing his age. Other than that the show is ok. Don't expect a rocking concert.,1167782400,2,122,4.125
1787095,5,B00006LPDT,"First and foremost, I must say, I've been a fan of this band for over 20 years.  Ian Astbury and Billy Duffy have made some great music during that time, and it's been a pleasure to listen to their albums and see them in concert. I've seen `em live several times (first in 1991, and most recently after the release of Beyond Good & Evil), so I do have a benchmark to compare this to.  A lot of the reviewers here have commented that this isn't a great performance, and have faulted Ian for mailing it in, so to speak, and for not really belting the songs out the way he does on the albums.  And hey, there's no denying that you guys are right.  He's not in top form here.  If you contrast his singing here with his singing on L.A. Woman Live (his DVD with the Doors), there's a biiiiig difference.  When you compare the two, it's clear that he's not giving us all he can here.

All I can really say to that is: SO WHAT.  This is a great DVD!  Even if his voice is shot here (and honestly, it's NOT), this is a great example of a live Cult show.  Ian's delivery here is still good, and he's a great performer who knows how to please his fans.  There's a number of shots here of the audience, and you can see everyone watching the show is really enjoying it. There are a lot of good bands out there, but the Cult is a great(!!) band, and the Cult on a bad day will still blow most others right off the stage.

Aside from Ian's vocals (which is a small point really), there's nothing else wrong.  The rest of the band is in top form.  Matt Sorum remains a great drummer, and Billy Duffy's an awesome guitarist.  He solos quite a bit here, and it definitely adds to the songs.  The bassist here is Billy Morrison.  Last time I saw the Cult, Craig Adams (former Sisters of Mercy/Mission) was handling bass duties, but Billy Morrison does a great job too.  The video here is clear, and the sound is mixed well.  The songs range from material off the Love album (Rain & She Sells Sanctuary) to six tracks off Beyond Good & Evil.  Overall, it's a good selection of their hits, and they all come across well when performed live.  The extra footage here isn't terribly deep or meaningful, but it's fun to see the band backstage, or hear what the fans have to say about their favorite band.

Soooo . . . . if you're really picky and want to hear pitch-perfect renditions of these songs, then this isn't the DVD for you.  If you want to see and hear a great live performance though (with all the good and bad that a live performance can bring), throw this DVD in your machine, turn your sound system up, and enjoy listening to the Cult tear things up.  Five stars!",1150416000,,2652,4.216269841269841
1787102,5,B00006LPDT,"I've been a huge fan of the cult ever since I picked up Electric and had it as one of my few tapes on some boring family vacation back on march break in the mid eighties.

While I'll agree that Ian mails in some songs throught the concert, and wimps out on some tough notes, he certainly delivers some power vocals for his newer stuff. Rain was quite stellar too, but how could he wimp out on Love removal machine like that?? grrrr:)

Although I'd rather he put a better effort singing some of my classic favs, I can understand why he'd want to change them up after playing them so many damn times. I really liked Peace Dog, despite its differences. He is a bit older but can still put together a great albumn in the studio and belt out the notes when he wants to.

His voice isn't shot!

The intro to this concert is just incredible (Rise), it gives me chills every time I play it. The sound quality is outstanding, and Billy Duffy has never sounded better. Too bad Matt is in Velvet Revolver, I'd like to hear Ian and Billy record another albumn with him.

This concert is a must own for anyone claiming to be rock fans, and anyone even remotely a fan of the greatest rock band of all time, The Cult!:)",1140652800,10,1204,4.240174672489083
1787103,4,B00006LPDT,"Ian - good effort, showing his years.

Billy - you don't have to move when you look that cool.

Matt - is always awesome.  You can tell the guy loves rock.

Others - round it out to make one great sounding live DVD despite sketchy vocals.

Tip - turn Ian down in the center channel so he isn't so out front.  The vocals are better when you tuck them some.  Then rock out.  Who knew a Matchless amp could be that thick?",1137283200,4,418,4.012195121951219
1787104,4,B00006LPDT,"I'm confused at the reviews dogging Ian but still giving it 4 stars. Well, did you like it or not!? I think he does a great job and he's working his ass off to keep that crowd going. In 20 years I've never heard a live recording of Ian where he isn't at times indistinct, out of breath or skipping lines. I cut a singer a lot of slack if their working the stage and Ian does it in spades. I was more disappointed in Billy Duffy seeming to be a wax statue. His playing is great but I don't think he moves from his spot once!

You definitely get the impression that Ian is truly greatful to the fans and you can feel a real sincerity in his performance.

As others have said the footage and sound is stellar. The extras are minimal with backstage footage that, apart from showing how bald Nic Cage really is, is forgettable....but hey it's a concert DVD, what extras do you need!

If you like the Cult through all their incarnations I can't imagine you won't like this DVD. It's a very solid.",1128384000,4,990,4.2
1787105,3,B00006LPDT,"Unfortunately must agree with many reviewers - did not meet my expectations. The show is quite static despite Ian's occasional aerobics. Too static for a band like Cult. Ian sings a lot of something you just can't hear and it's not matching with the rest performed...Of course, there are The Moments like The Witch, but it just can't help overall weakness. Additional/backstage is not very alive/asskicking, either. Think I would rather recommend  Pure Cult Anthology.",1113264000,,468,5.24
1787106,4,B00006LPDT,"Ian Astbury has the irritating habit of skipping every other line struggling with his vocals, but The Cult pull off a few numbers every nicely.

This is where they are at, today - a frankly older, road-worn rock band that has indulged every bad habit. The Lyceum concert is available on VHS if you want to hear what Ian used to be capable of. The songs often feel a bit muted and slow, and may be improved by a speed adjustment on your DVD player.

Ian seems very physically stiff and shouty, almost insecure under his huge bandana, not at all the cool raven-headed Goth-master we remember from the eighties. On MWF he's an angry white James Brown shouting madly at the crowd rather than compelling them.

If you're a fan of this DVD then like me you just know the Cult enough to still care.",1100822400,3,791,4.404109589041096
1787107,2,B00006LPDT,"I'm a longtime Cult fan, from the Electric era and I've got to admit Ian really brings this DVD down.  I've never had the oppportunity to see The Cult live before so I am not sure how this performance compares to others but Ian just seems to yell or speak the lyrics more than sing them and he in my opinion needs to talk way less between songs.  The song selection is awesome, the sound quality is awesome, and Billy Duffy's guitar absolutely rocks on both new and old tracks.  Ian needs to watch something like The Cure's Trilogy DVD for a clue on how to preserve their art for all time's sake in DVD form.  Worth watching for Cult fans but not as good as it could have been.",1073865600,12,677,4.184615384615385
1787108,4,B00006LPDT,"If you like The Cult you'll LOVE this DVD! Though it's true that Ian appears to 'mail-in' some of the older tunes, the energy that the band exudes on the newer stuff more than makes up for it.
Unlike most concert videos, this one is not retouched in a studio after the fact. You get to see the show as if you were there. The music is just like Cult fans like it. . . raw. That means that if Billy D. misses a cord or Ian's voice cracks from time to time, well good, that's what live music is all about. This DVD is well worth the price.",1070409600,2,536,3.926605504587156
1787109,3,B00006LPDT,"I love the Cult and have seen them in concert twice, but I agree that this is not their best effort.  Billy looks like he could care less and Ian tries to impress us with 4 letter words...  It is worth watching if you are a diehard fan, and Matt Sorhum really rocks and so does Morrison.  The sound quality is not the greatest either.  I enjoyed the behind the scenes segment.  The Cult DVD Anthology is better if you are choosing between the two...",1068249600,2,449,4.235294117647059
1787110,5,B00006LPDT,"The only unfortunate part of The Cult's 'Music Without Fear' is that they left ""The Saint"" and ""Nirvana"" off of the video from that night's performance. However, it kicks... The tracks from 'Beyond Good And Evil' kick with the same power as captured on the record. Hearing (and seeing) ""In The Clouds"" and ""The Witch"" performed are two good reasons to own this DVD, but of course, ""Rise"", ""Lil' Devil"", ""Edie (Ciao Baby)"", ""Take The Power"", ""War (The Process)"" and ""Breathe"" are more reasons to make this part of your very own Pure Cult collection. I give it five stars because it kicks... it's the only live DVD of The Cult at the moment and it's better than nothing in the most obvious way!

1787111,5,B00006LPDT,"Having seen the Cult 10 times over the last 16 years, I can tell you that their brand of music is difficult to replicate night after night in a live concert.  Ian's voice does not hold up well if the band plays 3 or 4 nights in a row.  This show sounds as if they were on vacation for about a week before it was recorded and they're literally at the top of their game.
I've seen Ian ""mail it in"" in live concerts before, and either wuss out and not sing a difficult part, or do it haphazardly, dissapointing the loyal fan base who comes to hear his leather lunged howl.  Maybe he knew he was being recorded for the DVD, but the effort to do a good job was there.
I am pleased to report, he doesn't mail it in too often in this particualr show!  ""Rain"" is excellent, he even does the ""Yeah, Yeaayyyyah yeah"" at the end of ""She Sells Sanctuary.""  The crowd is a bit subdued, but let's face it, the Cult's fan base are 30 and 40 somethings now, not exactly the kind of crowd that 'moshes.'
The mix of old and new is quite good and the majority of their classics are present.  It is a little disappointing that ""Nirvana"" was not on the DVD, but then again, I am never satisfied.",1061251200,12,1174,4.104803493449782
1787136,2,B00006LPDT,Do not buy this dvd if you love Ian's voice. He seems to be totally out of it. Stoned cold wasted or whatever.,1058572800,2,110,3.8260869565217392
1787137,3,B00006LPDT,"I have listened to The Cult for about 15 years and they are one of my all time favorite bands. Ian used to have the greatest voice which it sounds like he has lost. It was very dissapointing listening to the vocals on this DVD. If you are a true fan of The Cult you still might want to buy this DVD to get a good visual of The Cult in concert. Otherwise I would rather pull out and listen to the old Love, Electric and Sonic Temple CDs.",1050624000,3,436,3.9101123595505616
1787138,4,B00006LPDT,"The 3rd music DVD I have watched on my new Philips progressive scan machine.  Best sound thus far.  DTS is the way to do music on DVD at least until they come up with something better.  This one is done the way they all should be done,the concert from start to finish or at least everything they didn't edit out.  All the filler and behind the scenes stuff is a separate feature all together.  One star deduction for blurry or out of focus from front camera angle.  Probably would not show up unless viewed on big screen.  Turn it up.  If it's too load, you're to old!",1044748800,,568,4.242990654205608
1787139,5,B00006LPDT,"THE CULT are one of the best rock n' roll bands ever. Period. They stormed the '80's with some of the most imaginative and creative music of a decade where millions of people were ""rocking"" to bands like Culture Club, Tom Tom Club, Flock Of Seagulls and Dexy's Midnight Runners...(not that there's anything wrong with that).
When they split up in the mid-'90's I was shocked because I knew we'd lost a top-notch band. Then when they re-grouped to release (what I consider a 5-Star CD) ""Beyond Good & Evil"" I knew that THE ROCK N' ROLL WAS BACK! Now, with this exciting DVD you too can wallow in the shear sonic pleasure of THE CULT at it's best.
The DVD sounds great. It looks great. And the song selection is a good overall overview of their career. (I notice they didn't include anything from ""Ceremony"" when I thought ""Wild-Hearted Son"" was one of their best). Thankfully, they spared us anything from 1994's ""The Cult"" which I thought was a mess from the get-go.
This is an excellent DVD also in that it includes a behind-the-scenes look at the latest tour. All in all you can't go wrong if you are a CULT fan. I'm partial to ""The Witch,"" but every song is performed well. THE CULT are bare-bones rock n' roll. There's no pyro and huge production on the scale of KISS, but if you just want a wall of amps and bone-crushing sound THE CULT are just the band for you. It's great to have Ian & Co. back...and it's good to have REAL ROCK back too. Thanx guys!!!",1042848000,,1460,4.391143911439114

 Don't hesitate on this one, it rocks. Concert is what you expect it to be - uninterrupted,start to finish. This is a good one.",1041984000,,299,4.0508474576271185
1787141,5,B00006LPDT,"For Cult fans, this is a must have.  Seventeen songs of both new and older Cult favorites.  The recording was made in L.A. just weeks after 9/11, which Ian made reference.
  The video is shot well and sounds fantastic; please view it on a big screen with top of the line sound set up.  My only real criticism of the DVD is the sound in the first few selections.  The sound seemd to ""cut out"".  Not completely, but a noticeable depth of the sound would leave for seconds at a time.
  Once thing that struck me was the crowd at this show; extemely subdued.  Repeatedly, Ian attempted to further excite the crowd, but they were barely heard.  (part of the mix?)
  Keep in mind, we are seeing an older Cult.  Still plenty of energy, but not the same as the early 90's.  Ian's voice was noticeably strained, but I still couldn't control my excitement as I turned up the controls for songs like Rise, The Witch, Sweet Soul Sister, Wildflower (my favorite of this DVD), and the finale, Love Removal Machine.
  Billy Duffy still has his stage presence, and at times I thought Matt Sorum's drums were going to blast thru my screen.  Sound so crystal clear, it's hard to belive!  This is an absolutely great DVD!  As a fan of The Cult for almost 20 years, I know I'll be watching this one for a long tme.  GET IT!  You'll be glad you did.

While not the most animated band, no other rock band  comes close to the pure ""Marshall Stack"" power presented here.  The sound quality is great and the camera work is steady and ""spartan"", without alot of quick all over the stage camera shots that plague alot of other live videos.  We get great camera work during the guitar solos which put me in ""Nirvana"".  Great track selection mixing songs from the recent ""Beyond Good & Evil"" album with classics such as ""Rain"" and ""Lil' Devil"".  Billy Duffy flat out jams; and, although Ian misses a few high notes here and there, his vocals are flat out killer.  If you are a Cult fan, you already own this dvd and most likely are not even reading this review.

1787144,5,B00006LPDT,"""the cult live: music without fear"" provides a fascinating visual accompaniment to the cult's powerful musical texturing. unlike some of their contemporaries, the cult have managed to consistently produce superb material throughout the course of their career.
songs on ""music without fear"" are virtually without peer. ian astbury, while occasionally sounding slightly winded, delivers an outstanding vocal performance, extracting the essence of each song without resorting to stale, note-for-note replications of studio recordings. billy duffy's guitar playing is once again the epitome of taste- alternating between brash blues-rock and subtle restraint. and once again, matt sorum's drumming capabilities are evident throughout. standout tracks include ""lil devil,"" ""she sells sanctuary,"" ""rain,"" ""my bridges burn,"" and ""love removal machine.""  the vague lushness and warmth present on original cult records are somewhat replaced by harsher guitar tones and more straight-forward arrangements- yet not to the detriment of the songs.
the audio and video quality are incomparably stunning.
while other established artists find it sufficient to perform merely mediocre live renditions of their material in an effort to move units and sell tickets, ""music without fear"" is a refreshing example of a band whose proficiency has not diminished with age.",1040169600,3,1348,5.877551020408164
