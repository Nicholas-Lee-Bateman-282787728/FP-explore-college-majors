6925266,5,B00R9O4YNE,"It's difficult to pair Clannad with another anime series...Its intimate story is cute, thoughtful, inspiring, sad and reliving, sometimes all within minutes...Clannad rose to the top of my favourites list of anime, and I think that my distant 2nd place has inched a lot closer to Clannad's throne...and its owner is Pet Girl of Sakurasou.

This series successfully mirrors the emotional onslaught of Clannad...but does it in another way. Whilst Clannad deals with more...imaginative or dream-like subjects like Japanese legends of spirits, The Pet Girl of Sakurasou is rooted deeply within real human experiences...so real, in fact, you cannot but feel for the characters.

Granted, the fan service in this show can be a bit too much SOMEtimes (NOTE episode 7 bath scene...skip 10:30 - 12:25 if you want to escape the worst of it...but you will miss the humorous dialogue)...the humour in this show are beyond gold, and they don't always rely on near-naked situations...Many of them rely on clashing personalities of the characters, the best being Sorato with his sister Yuuko and Mashio. Watch until Episode 10...and guess where the show would go next (hint: its way more depressing AND inspiring.)

Ok, Sakurasou...It's a series that BEGS for a sequel (because it was so good), but is already complete in its story arcs. It follows characters who live in Sakura dorm, a place where the high school they attend would separate 'problem' students from the regular dorm. What we get is a group of students who are unique, quirky, likeable and RELATABLE, and we get to experience they everyday struggles.

So about these characters...one is a hyperactive, bright girl who lives and breathes animation, plus a young, celebrity artist who might be brilliant with a paintbrush, but useless at everything else. Among them are 3 more: a normal boy who was placed in Sakura dorm for keeping cats (against school rules); who fights with jealousy and envy when he witnesses the geniuses around him at work. Another is somewhat a playboy who wants to live up to his true love's high achievements before admitting that love, and a workaholic (but otherwise still normal) girl who wants to become an voice actress. Ok, I separated the main cast into 2 main groups...because the series relies on this skill/ability distance between them to deliver the story: one which centres around the conflict between 'talent' and 'hard work'. The former group are geniuses in their craft, all of which are born with talents; the latter group being those who wishes to achieve their goals through sheer will. Life is unfair to them, as their hard work were repeatedly ignored, this being completely relatable to me.

What I find most striking about this series is Mashio: the genius artist. Her character as a quiet girl with an born inability to properly express her feelings, makes it even more touching when her usually expressionless face leak tears, or a tiny twitch of her lips, which soon reveals a smile.

For that perfect final cry-fest...just you wait till episode 23.

Animation in this series is sort of like Clannad-lite...but its unique colour palette of more bright colours and sequences of blending animated oil PAINTINGs are absolutely PERFECT.

I recommend this series with the same enthusiasm as Clannad; both masterful in their own ways; yet both are impossible to rate above one another for me.",1430006400,12,3387,5.035714285714286

8694692,5,B00R9O4YNE,"A highly under-rated show.  The writing is simply fantastic with excellent comedy and actually some nice character development and arcs including for the side characters. The animation is great. Too much fanservice for my taste, but when it's done, it's done for laughs not just leers and even that comedy mostly hits. It's simply a show that is so well-written that it's hard not to love even if it's a bit male-gazy at times. Highly, highly recommended.",1527984000,,455,4.909090909090909

8694696,5,B00R9O4YNE,"You could call ""The Pet Girl of Sakurasou"" a slice-of-life, romantic comedy, but this terse description hardly does it justice. I went in with fairly low-expectations. I had thought it was going to be a funny sitcom to watch at the end of the day to unwind. While it did deliver on that, it ended up being much more.

The series is about a group of six high school students living in Sakura Hall: a dorm for troublemakers and misfits. They range from the average student to already-established geniuses. All of them, though, are your typical teens: they misstep, get jealous, and even lash out. But they also listen, learn, and persevere. Throughout this journey, all of them grow more with each other than they would have alone. At its core, ""The Pet Girl of Sakurasou"" is about friendship, not just the ""see you next summer"" you write in a yearbook, but a bond that is forged into family through both laughter and tears.

The voice acting was superb. Even though I don't understand Japanese, their emotions rang through the subtitles loud and clear. Matsuoka Yoshitsugu as Sorata (also voiced Kitiro in Sword Art Online) was hilarous and had me laughing out loud.  Nakatsu Mari's portrayal of Nanami was so sweet that I was constantly rooting for her. Kayano Ai (also voiced Menma in Anohana) was beautiful showing Mashiro's evolution. I wish I could go into each character, but suffice to say the entire cast did a great job.  I found myself emotionally connected to the characters. When they laughed, I laughed. When they cried, I cried. By the end of the series, I felt that I had lived a year in Sakurasou with them. I even tried to slow the number of episodes I watched each night because I didn't quite want it to end, but like the closing of their school year, I couldn't stop it.

Personally, my primary (and perhaps only) criticism is that some of the romance aspects of the show seemed a little awkward, but in the end it didn't bother me enough to take away my full enjoyment of the show.

When people ask me why I watch anime, this will be one of the examples I would point to. On one hand, there's nothing ground-breaking about this anime. There are no hidden, deep messages to the show and it won't win a Pulitzer. However, the show tells a sweet story and tells it well.",1487203200,3,2287,4.552311435523114
8694697,5,B00R9O4YNE,"Surprisingly well done series about a charming cast of endearing oddballs. The characters develop nicely, and the plot lines move right along. Similar in tone to ""Maid Sama"" and ""Love, chunibyo, & other delusions!"".",1486080000,,215,5.352941176470588
