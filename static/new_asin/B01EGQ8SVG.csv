8758713,2,B01EGQ8SVG,"Love the film.  Unfortunately, this version is so poor, it's not even worth returning.  It shakes, is grainy and blotchy, but worst of all, this movie was beautifully filmed in anamorphic widescreen, but reduced to some dreadful standard format for this dvd.  No vivid, panoramic Australian landscapes, and the characters have the tops of their heads missing a lot of the time - 'bout like the cover.  Humph!",1485561600,,408,4.955882352941177
