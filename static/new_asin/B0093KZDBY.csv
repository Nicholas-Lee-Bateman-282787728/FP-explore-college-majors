8535242,3,B0093KZDBY,"The film is about giving a stripper drugs that increase her sex drive. It is about 1 hour long. They add extras that appear right behind the film to give it an illusion of being longer. This includes a director's interview, a video by ""No Redemption"" and trailers for other Chemical Burn productions.

The film has a high perv factor. Fetishes include:
Shower
Voyeur
POV lap dance
Solo act
Medical Exam
Rape

I just wish they had someone like Bree Olson instead of Suzy Deakin. Oh yeah, it has deep meaning about taking experimental pharmaceuticals while having a troubled life...I think.  FF Nudity.",1419724800,,600,4.805825242718447
8535243,4,B0093KZDBY,"Having explored the corruption of big pharmaceuticals, this movie was a treat to myself after having done extensive research on that subject.  It is a very smart movie, and I wish it were being shown on big screens everywhere because it might cause more people to THINK about what's going on.",1370390400,,292,4.7254901960784315
8535244,4,B0093KZDBY,"This movie was intelligent, disturbing, and completely paranoia inducing.  Everyone knows pharmaceutical companies are evil, yet no one does a thing. It's very frustrating to live in a society that accepts such evil.  This movie shows an extreme example of such evil.",1368316800,,267,5.333333333333333
