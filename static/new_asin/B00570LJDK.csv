8460106,4,B00570LJDK,"I like these old routines. I have post-polio syndrome with stiff tendons and jumping nerves. My muscles tend to knot up with vigorous exercise. These routines are completely doable for me, with few exceptions. Jack will stop beginners while he encourages the more fit to press on. All the routines are only a few minutes with breathers between. Fifty years ago I was dirt poor and staying fit with Jack via his TV show on my tiny B/W tv. Even my two toddlers would try to do them. His dietary and exercise philosophy stuck with me and in spite of every childhood illness, I am still walking, no heart disease, and no diabetes, though these run in my family. God bless him.",1501804800,2,672,4.516393442622951
8460107,5,B00570LJDK,This is exactly what I remember from watching the show. I like that you get an entire week of exercises on the CD. Shipping was very fast and came to me in great shape. You will definitely get a good work out with Jack LaLanne. Will probably get some more at a later date.,1457740800,,272,4.055555555555555
