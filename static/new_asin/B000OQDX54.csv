The first episode and many following is nothing more than a very low quality effort to brainwash the populace into thinking the natural world is about to end and be replaced with *gasp* farms.  The narrator tells us that all non-human biological life owes it's existence to the few crusaders that created parks and preserves.  Without them, there would not be a single animal or growing plant. That's it. It's predicable that all shows like this would mention that, but it's so exaggerated here as to be almost sadly comedic.  I grew up watching nature documentaries on public tv in the 80s.  I would have hoped that shows of this type would have improved with time, but this video series takes a serious step back and makes me miss the old Mutual of Omaha episodes.  This show's dialog was so elementary that any intelligent viewer cannot help feeling insulted.  The repetition of simple language would make it quite suitable for ESL students.  .",1498694400,,1122,4.832460732984293
8186342,5,B000OQDX54,"This show is like a ""60 Minutes"" show for the nature world.  Great camera work and interesting people bringing up subjects that you may want to follow up on.  These are 30 minutes shows so it is great for those short fill in times instead of clicking through the 150+ chanels with nothing on.  I would rather my dollar go to these products that to a cable company.",1279411200,2,364,4.323529411764706

8186344,2,B000OQDX54,"The product contains a lot of contents as a whole and they are very informtive. However, it is the way the contents are presented which make it a drag to watch for me.

If one is expecting this product to be a movie-like documentary in the league of Wild Africa BBC, Planet Earth BBC or National Geographic Amazing Planet, one could be disappointed.",1234742400,2,349,4.5396825396825395
8186345,4,B000OQDX54,"I felt this series is not as impressive as other National Geographic Nature presentations. It is still viewable, but there are better presentations from the BBC and PBS.",1229990400,3,169,5.071428571428571

8186348,5,B000OQDX54,"I am an advid collector/viewer of the world's wildlife.
As a nature conservationist, I believe the current National Geographic Series of Wild Chronicles which depict animals in the wild should be very interesting to both students and grownups. We need to conserve our wonderful wildlife all over the world when the pressure of increasing human population, global warming and the fast-dwindling forests have created conditions that are so adversed to all existing  mammals, particularly in the savannah regions of Africa, the rainforests of Asia and the Amazon land mass in South America.
I highly recommend the National Geographic Wild Chronicles to those of us who cheerish the suvivability and sustainability of these animals  in the face of adverse changes around the global. They could be here today and who knows if they still could make it tomorrow. Hence, these chronicles would serve as a permanent record of the fabulous wildlife on Planet Earth. So go for the series while stock lasts.
Cheers.",1182988800,10,1003,5.185185185185185
