5732259,1,B00CPKZLRK,This wasn't quite what I had hoped for.  ...a waste of time for me.,1431734400,,67,3.7857142857142856

5732261,3,B00CPKZLRK,...kept me curious to the end although I did do a little fast-forwarding with the slow spots.  Give it a try.,1402963200,,109,4.190476190476191
5732262,2,B00CPKZLRK,The Korean movie has a much better story and much more well done.  This movie ripped off most of the themes and ideas.,1400457600,,118,4.130434782608695
5732263,3,B00CPKZLRK,"just so bizarrely filmed and acted.  I don't know what to think.  It was very melodramatic and filmed much like a soap opera.  Or on a theater stage.  So much overacting.  All the vivid colors and perfect props made it look a tad surreal.  Loved the concept for the storyline and felt it had so much potential, but it actually moved along pretty slow and I'm not sure it had the shocking or sexy effect it might have intended.  I'm not really sure what it intended.  It's a remake of some older Korean movie... perhaps that might have more answers, lol.

Heather Graham plays Amy... a completely deluded, but very well-dressed cook who imagines she is prepping for her own cooking show.  All she seems to do is cook all day long.  And talk to her imaginary audience. The guy she lives with (husband?) has lost interest in barbie gone crazy and is bored to death hearing about food.  They can't even have sex without food being involved, lol.  He spends more time talking to his pretty parrot and prefers the company of his lovely (and sane) colleague.  Bad idea... this is not the happy lady you want to make unhappy.  Not showing appreciation for her dishes is like moving the perfectly placed labels on the shelf of someone with some mad OCD, lol.

All Amy wants is someone to feed.  When the guy she lives with is no longer an option, she takes a more extreme interest in feeding her reclusive neighbor Saffron, who is played by a very corpse-like Carrie-Anne Moss.  Saffron is a former child star AND a bulimic, no less, lol... which is very unfortunate for the nutcase who wants to feed her every 5 minutes, lol.  The depressed and suicidal Saffron is in a dead end career and has become a shut in... boney and draped in black in every scene.  She's not letting anyone in.  I HATE seeing Carrie-Anne Moss look and behave this way!!!!  Dang.  But who can resist the wide-eyed vulnerability and eager-to-please Amy (especially in all those cute and tight little dresses)??  I thought she was irresistible and watched her from beginning to end with a dopey smile... Saffron finds her irritating and continuously closes the door in her face, lol.  Apparently, starving yourself to death makes your genitals disappear.

When these two finally bond (somewhat) about halfway through, I felt the movie picked up a bit.  But it doesn't really go anywhere interesting or deep.  There is one sex scene between these two in the end and it was so bad I wanted to cry.  Blasphemy!!  I'm not even sure how it even built up to that. Huh?!  Amy can't even get delicious food in Saffron's mouth... let alone-  They don't even take off their clothes!  What was that anyway?! lol.  So horribly choreographed.  Like watching those puppets have sex in Team America... having sex, but not really, lol.  Fake, fake, fake (no genitals, remember).... to the soundtrack of melodramatic Dracula music no less. pfft.

These are two of my DREAMIEST women, true gifts from Mt. Lesbos, and I love the idea of seeing them connect.  Not with this script.  Their energies have a fabulous contrast, and in another story where Carrie-Anne actually has a pulse, I think they would have had amazing sexual chemistry.  But Saffron is so drabby and closed off that there really isn't much there.  I would like to have seen Carrie-Anne with Heather together in About Cherry... Carrie-Anne as the pissy girlfriend who has angry break up sex in the hallway with Heather.  Now THAT is the lesbian dynamic I'd like to see these two share.... but I digress....  ;)

I have to sum this one up by stealing a random (but spot on) comment I saw on youtube under their ""lesbian"" sex scene:  I think the writer and director didn't really know how things work...

It's worth watching for the stunningly gorgeous Heather Graham (and her ever-present cleavage)... and I'll watch my beloved Trinity in any flick, however bad... but this one just wasn't as good as it could have been.  And tell me the opening 5-10 min wasn't a homage to the opening of Dexter, lol...

5732264,5,B00CPKZLRK,"Compulsion:  Heather Graham, Carrie Ann Moss
I found this movie to be so hilarious, sexy and erotic.
I was entertained for about an hour and a half.
Gorgeous Heather Graham
It was a delight to watch and it made me hungry with all the food being made by Heather.
                   

If you have a slightly dark side and deranged sense of humor this movie is for you.
Somewhat staged like a sitcom.
A neighbor with a eating disorder that did not speak much through out the movie.  This is a move not to take seriously, but to be entertained.",1385856000,,540,4.285714285714286
5732265,2,B00CPKZLRK,"If you own the books of Brett Easton Ellis, you'll find this total rehash.  His characters' mind numbing gluttony of high fashion is cut and pasted to fine cuisine.  There is also a fetish for nonsexual elements like Cronenberg explored and an ambition for a wide audience and a celebrity friendship like Scorsese's ""King of Comedy.""  The performance itself is like a poor man's Nicole Kidman.",1379289600,,393,4.924242424242424

5732267,3,B00CPKZLRK,"Love me, love my food, a simple rule for life. Amy (Heather Graham) lives in a delusional world where she has her own TV cooking show which openly equates food with sex. Her boyfriend Fred (Kevin Dillon) doesn't share in her compulsion and makes the mistake of openly loving his rare African parrot more than her food. The police (Joe Mantegna) is investigating the disappearance of the neighbor Saffron (Carrie-Anne Moss). Amy claims she knows Saffron, but clearly what she relates to the police is not the reality. Saffron is an actress who has fallen on hard times. Amy cooks for her not realizing Saffron is a closet bulimic, well not actually a bulimic in that she doesn't binge eat.

The film has great scenes of Heather's cleavage, cooking food and relating it to sex, eat your heart out Rachel Ray. Outside of that, the plot displayed weakness. You have a basic idea where the story is going to lead, just unsure how it gets there. Good character portrayals, unfortunately the script didn't measure up. The film is classified as a drama/thriller but is more like a hit or miss dark comedy.

Worth a rental for quirky indie style film lovers.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex. No nudity.",1377216000,19,1190,4.739130434782608
5732268,2,B00CPKZLRK,"You might like this movie if you enjoyed:
Fatal Attraction (1987), Single White Female (1992)

Long Story Short: A young woman (Heather Graham) with an extreme passion for food is suspected to be involved with the disappearing of her neighbor (Carrie-Anne Moss). While she is preparing a meal for the investigating officer she is reminiscing, and the truth slowly gets revealed.

Review: It saddens me to see Heather Graham in all these weird B-movies, but I guess once you did one, you are stuck in this genre forever. The movie starts very appealing by showing many different food shots and colors and Heather Graham in many different Stepford -wife -like outfits, and the story seems interesting, too. But after about 30 minutes it starts getting a little boring, there doesn't seem to be any character development, and I honestly don't remember the dialogues, because they have been so meaningless. It seems like Egidio Coccimiglio had a good idea but didn't know how to breath life into his characters, so it is hard to even feel anything. When the end credits rolled out, I felt clueless and untouched. Compulsion is one of the better movies Heather Graham has come out with lately, nonetheless it doesn't deliver any tension or depth.

This is based on a Korean movie that I've always passed by in my public library, but one which I think I'll try to see to see how it could be done right. Sort of how like The  Vanishing was done right the first time in Europe, but lost something in America. Did I mention Heather Graham looked wonderful?",1453593600,4,438,4.27710843373494

I love the duel plots, flashbacks, and creative plot point narration. THIS is a dark comedy, that is actually truly dark and funny. All of the actors were outstanding. And, if it was a fair world, Heather Graham would be nominated for an Oscar. There should also be a category for most unique...inspired by this film.",1452384000,,442,4.828947368421052
