The time scanners are heading to Machu Picchu to discover how the Incas built a gravity-defying city in the clouds.  And how the city built at three times the height of the worlds tallest building could feed and water its thousand residents.

The above is the introduction to this truly fascinating documentary.

Machu Picchu is the most familiar icon of Inca civilization.

Machu Picchu is a fifteenth-century Inca stone citadel (a fortified city) situated on a mountain ridge almost 8000 feet above sea level.  It is located in the Cusco region of Peru.

The hillsides leading to the city were terraced.  These terraces were built at an impossible angle on an almost vertical mountain face.

One of the worlds best structural engineers with his team of four from the University of Arkansas are here to answer three key questions:

(1) How did the Inca build a city on the side of a mountain?

(2) What was the purpose of the terraces going up the mountain and how were they constructed?

(3) How did the Incas supply the entire city with fresh, flowing water?

The secret weapon the team has to help them answer these questions is a mobile laser scanner.  Data collected by using this scanner gives a 3D perspective and the ability to take precise measurements.  As well, a ground-penetrating radar is used.

This documentary blends engineering (its main emphasis) with history, science, and art to give a remarkable analysis of this sacred city.  I found the cinematography and graphics to be quite well done.

Finally, after the team collect all their data, they are able to give reasonable answers to the questions posed above and by the end of this documentary, they provide the following conclusion:

Machu Picchu is a realization of the near-impossible, a fully functioning city in the sky and a lasting monument to some of the greatest engineers the world has ever seen.

In conclusion, if you ever wanted to know about one of the most inaccessible cities in the world, then this is the documentary to see!!

8727887,5,B013I9RM6E,"35 years ago I had the opportunity to travel to Peru and spend New Years Day at the site of the 500-year-old Inca city in the Andes Mountains  Machu Picchu. Though Ive traveled to many others places in the world this one ranks with the Great Wall of China as the top two highlights. Its one the places that you must see before you die (Im glad I did!)

Everyone I know who has visited this lost city (It sat undiscovered until 1919 when explorer Hiram Bingham came upon it.) has wondered how the still-standing building frames made from  huge boulders were moved into place. (The wheel had not been invented yet). A second question was why were there so many terraces? And, a third question was how did the 1,000 or so inhabitants get water to drink, wash and plant, when the city was on top of a mountain 8,000 ft above sea level?.

There have been studies but now a new form of laser photography can actually provide the answers. This is the goal of the laser photo experts  who call themselves time scanners and they have done these analyses for other historic sites and the results have been the PBS series time Scanners of which this 53 minute episode is just one that has been released on DVD.

I won't tell you  the answers to the three questions above, but I felt that what was proposed made sense. It helped fill in the gaps of what I have read over the years.

If you are an armchair traveler, watching this show will give you a feeling for the beauty and awesomeness of Machu Picchu and might even convince you to visit there during your life.

There are no bonus features on the DVD. It does have English subtitles.

I was provided an advance screening copy in exchange for an objective review.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
