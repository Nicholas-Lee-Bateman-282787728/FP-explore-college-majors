7848524,5,6303491294,I babysit my 3 year old niece and wanted to find something more educational for her to watch than some TV offerings.  I borrowed this video from the library and since then all she wants to do is dance!! I eventually ended up buying her a tutu and slippers AND her own copy of this video.  She loves watching Wishing Well Willie and the three instructors that demonstrate various styles of dance. This is a really cute video!,1080518400,2,424,4.423076923076923
7848525,5,6303491294,its very entertaining and teaches some basic dance moves that preschoolers can follow.  the silly character wishing well willie is humorous. great for getting those precious little girls into the arts and very imaginative play.,1054857600,3,227,5.485714285714286
7848526,4,6303491294,"After reading the reviews here and at half.com I went ahead and purchased this video.  I knew I wasn't getting a full ballet lesson and I knew this would not make my daughter a ballerina over night.  But it did spark more interest in ballet and dance.
Wishing Well Willy is a magical person who helps a little girl make her dreams of becoming a ballerina come true first by showing her three different ballet styles, Classic, Jazz and Modern.  Willy adds humor, which all children video's need.
The moves were very easy to do, they had basic steps and they made it fun for children to learn.  My girls are 6, 4 and 3 and they absolutely enjoy this video and have watched over and over again.  Worth every penny!!!!",1038700800,17,714,4.419847328244275
7848527,4,6303491294,"My 3 1/2 year old daughter loved this film. I think she learned a lot and watched it several times in a row!  As a ballet teacher myself, I was impressed with the kids in this piece and yes, Wishing Well Willie was a bit much to stomach over and over, but she didn't seem to mind! Wishing they would've introduced tap, though....",1032739200,5,329,4.222222222222222
7848528,4,6303491294,"But the video is good & introduces ballet, tap & jazz.  Not as ""girly-girl"" as most ballet videos.  There aren't many ballet/dance videos with boys but they might like this better than most.",1015977600,3,190,4.7272727272727275
