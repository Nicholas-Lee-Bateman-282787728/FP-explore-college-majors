8718123,1,B00YB994XK,"My wife and I loved the show.  But when I ordered it, the DVD version we received was made for a different region than the USA and we had to return it.  Not sure why you all can't sell this series in a version playable on USA DVD players!!!  We'd immediately buy it if available.",1444780800,10,279,4.036363636363636
