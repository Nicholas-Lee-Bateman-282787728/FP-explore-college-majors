4097391,1,B0039UAA58,"If there was a top ten list for the worst movies of all time, this movie would be on it. Very boring, very little action, crass language, you spend the whole movie waiting for something to happen and when it finally does, the movie is over. Wish I have not wasted time watching it.",1269907200,7,281,4.222222222222222
4097392,2,B0039UAA58,"Filmed like a 1970's horror movie, good acting for the most part especially Dexter Fletcher who was outstanding as always but all other aspects feel like the movie was shot for about $500, in a weekend by highschool students, especially the musical score and sound editing.  The lowlight of the film was David Carradine who did a good job showing why he hadn't worked much since Kung Fu.

If you're a big fan of the zombie genre AND David Moody as I am you'll be able to get through it but if you're just looking for a way to kill off a few hours look elsewhere.",1485734400,,562,4.2924528301886795

4097395,1,B0039UAA58,"I would have loved to enjoy this movie. I am either shallow and disinterested in stimulating my mind or this was an incredibly bad film. Nothing about the characters seemed natural, and I could barely see the ""dark"" scenes of which there are many.  Go ahead and give it a try, some folks seemed to get something from their time. I did not.",1472169600,,339,4.380952380952381

4097419,1,B0039UAA58,"I received an email from Amazon asking me to review and rate ""Autumn.""

I would like to, but unfortunately I became so bored with the movie one half hour into it, that I never finished it.

I can tell you one thing, though; there is this bizarre mix of american and british actors, and even through it looks like it's set in England, the cars have the steering wheel in the left side.  I cannot recommend this movie unless you just want some noise in the background while you're busy doing other things.",1464739200,,503,4.387096774193548

4097426,2,B0039UAA58,kinda boring.  pretty typical zombie movie but you don't care for the characters so you could care less if they killed or not.,1464048000,,126,4.478260869565218
4097427,1,B0039UAA58,I started this movie with the best of intentions but it only took about 28 seconds before I realized this movie would be a waste of my life so I never made it through,1463961600,,166,3.911764705882353
4097428,1,B0039UAA58,Awful movie. The acting was very stiff and I'm NOT talking about the zombies. The actors must have had a donut size fake blood capsule in their mouths when they started to bleed. I guess the producers thought it would shock the viewers to see this gore. The movie was just plain dumb.,1463961600,,284,4.377358490566038

4097432,1,B0039UAA58,"Oh, where to begin... The book had to have been better than the movie, if it was a ""cult classic.""  This movie is filled with 1-dimensional characters who are either moping and pouting, or screaming and acting bellicose for no apparent reason.  No character was ever developed enough for me to care about their fate - and because of the lackadaisical zombies the main trio were able to live on and bore me for quite some time.  And I like a low-budget horror film as much as the next guy, but use some imagination.  When they are able to hold the ""hundreds"" of zombies at bay with snow fence - ""we'll build a strong fence!"", one of the men tells the women before heading to the local home building center for a couple rolls of wood snow fence that couldn't hold out a rowdy troop of boy scouts.  Couldn't you have at least stretched the budget far enough for some chain link, or something more believable?",1463875200,,905,4.427710843373494
4097433,1,B0039UAA58,This movie is low-budget and low-quality. There's a limit to how many zombie apocalypse movies anyone can tolerate. This one you can skip completely.,1463875200,,149,5.25

4097437,1,B0039UAA58,Autumn is SO SLOW that it took me three days just to bear to watch it.  I couldn't stomach more than 30 minutes at a time. It's mostly just zombies running around with a bunch of people who are too stupid to get weapons or even make a plan to TRY and save themselves. They couldn't even get to a place that was NOT in the middle of nowhere - even though they have the entire world at their disposal.,1463616000,,399,3.9875

It was sudden, as most movies represent, not a protracted rebirth, at times giving the hint of ""dead"" intelligence.

4097455,2,B0039UAA58,A bit low budget but not the worst I have seen. It was a little different than the average zombie movie in the way things started out.  In the end a zombie movie is a zombie movie.,1463011200,,180,3.864864864864865

Best example: a couple we have never seen before are half naked and zonked out on pills while the stereo plays heavy metal.  The meatsuits wander into their house and frighten them while reaching for the music from the speakers.  End of scene.  What did this little scenario accomplish in the advancement of the story except fill three minutes?  This kind of film editing goes on throughout the length of the film.  Even the final scene is absolutely meaningless.
The second big problem is a complete lack of logic behind the actions of the characters.  I won't second guess the characters actions or try to rewrite the film, but nothing really happens here.  A bunch of people turn into zombies.  A few people comment on it.  Three people move into a deserted farmhouse and then leave.  The end.

They don't really attack humans either, but they love dogs and they fight with each other. They also don't try to get into the house (which is mostly glass).. You don't know what's going on half the time, and it's acted that way too.. Mix of English cockney and American actors mumbling lines (no captions on the dvd, btw). It takes 45 mins for the first bit of action to kick in and even then, it's so bland and quick, then it's right back to the boring soap opera-ish type dialogue.

4097628,1,B0039UAA58,"When I saw all the negative feedback for this movie I though it was because folks were unhappy that Autumn was not a ""balls to the wall"", non-stop zombie feeding and killing mayhem frenzy of a movie! I had read Autumn when it was posted on the web years ago and pretty much liked it... what I really liked was the fact that survivors were given a little bit of head start until the ""dead"" reanimated and began to hanker for a hunk of flesh! So, I disregarded all the negative feedback and found myself a copy of Autumn. Well, the movie was pretty close to what I remember reading, however I don't remember all the back and forth bitching and nagging and arguing that the characters did. Can't think of anything intelligent for your characters to talk about and add depth and development to them, just have them yell and argue with each other! This was a budget movie and it really showed, but that is no excuse cause I have seen some pretty good low budget zombie movies and some really crappy Hollywood big budget zombie movies.  What made Autumn such a bad movie for me was the fact that the filmmakers, who worked with David Moody, the writer of Autumn, in making this movie, didn't seem to take the time to develop a strong script. I think if they had done that, it might of help with some character development. There was almost no character development so I never really cared about any of the characters and never fully got into the movie.
The acting was hit or miss, thankfully the 3 main actors were pretty good actors.  The actors had a thick British accent and it was hard at times to understand what they were saying / yelling at each other. I almost wish the movie had been filmed in the French speaking part of Canada so I could have watched the movie dubbed!  Zombie make-up was hit or miss, mostly on the miss side.
The pacing was incredibly slow in the beginning and then seemed to rush throughout the remainder of the film. And the film jumped all around, I'm sure it was because they wanted to try and stay true to the story, and show the viewer what happened to the other characters that left the community center, but that just confused and frustrated me and I thought it was just a huge waste of film on characters that I didn`t care about and it didn`t add anything to the movie!
To sum it all up, this was too much of an idea / story for the budget that they had.
But on the plus side, this was not the worst zombie film I have ever seen... Horrid and Night of the Living Dead 3-D share that title!",1344297600,4,2522,4.3164556962025316

I've read a lot of z'apo, and this is the first time i've really taken in the PTSD of the people who don't seize weapons and strive to survive.

No gorgeous super-achievers, the characters are just accidental travelers in the wild world.  The actors' similar and very average appearances emphasized their desperate heroism.

The largest problem with this film is that it's very disjointed and doesn't really make too much sense overall. The zombies are wasted.

4097632,5,B0039UAA58,"This Zombie Film was great. It was very unique and creative.
Before you believe the 1 star reviews...please understand
Yes this movie is slow...but that pace is used to build suspense...
The Zombies don't show a need for human flesh...So what...
Why can't a movie be appreciated for it's ORIGINALITY...?
I will admit that if you want to be scared stupid this movie most likely won't do it.
It is not filled with action scenes or loads of gore...
The horror is more in the idea of facing death and the reanimated dead.
This movie is begging for a sequel, because the zombies continue to evolve but never reach that ""Deadly"" status.
The basic premise is a airborne virus spreads over the world and within hours only a select few ""IMMUNE"" people are left alive with everyone else dead where they fell. After a day or so about 3 dozen folk have gathered together wondering what to do now that everyone but them are dead.
After another day or so the dead begin to get up a slowly, plodding around until they bump into something and they turn and mindlessly wander off in another direction. Despite the horror of seeing dead rise, they seem harmless.
However 3 of the survivors take this as a sign to get the hell away from the city and the hundreds of thousand walkers.
They spend the rest of the movie venturing of into the countryside and find a farm. But they have visitors there too.
The rest of the movie is suspenseful horror as the dead begin to react to sound, get more aggressive etc. All the while the group of 3 shell up in the farmhouse and venture into towns to get supplies.
This movie clocks in at about 2 hours so it has more time to develop character and dread. There is always the danger of the dead, but if you're looking for gore and gunfights this is not your movie. It is not an action movie or splatter fest but rather a realistic portrayal of what survival would be like if you were one of the last alive on earth.
The makeup work on the dead is very realistic and superb...there is no CG or bad effects here
There is even a 15 minute scenario where one of the three goes into a town and runs into a lonely man named Philip (played by David Carradine from Kung-fu and Kill Bill Fame) Philip however won't leave because his ""sick"" mum can't come along.
For suspenseful Horror or Zombie fans tired of the paint by numbers gore fests that almost every Zombie film seems to follow...Please try this movie...It is truly great.",1328313600,,2440,4.424444444444444

I don't expect any of these young people to become household names, but this is still a decent effort. Better action would have made this a much more watchable movie, but I still liked it.

It looks like the editor ran it through the Final Cut suite's Color program about 15 times.

There are parts of this movie that literally make no sense. At almost 2 hours, a lot of scenes could have been cut to tighten up the plot. Add in one of the most clumsy and ill thought out dream sequences ever, and you have this bomb. This is on the level of a bad student film.

4097643,4,B0039UAA58,"I haven't read the books. Didn't know there were any. So, I'm not going to compare the movie to the book(s) it was based on.

On its own, this movie stands up pretty well. But don't expect post-28 Days Later hyper-zombies. These are closer to Romero's plodding, brainless zombies (though, by the end of the movie it's a bit of a middle ground between the two).

The basic premise is that a plague strikes the world and nearly everyone dies. A few people weren't affected (either they never contracted the disease or were immune; it's not really stated and doesn't matter too much) and band together to try to keep humanity alive and/or ward off looters / vigilantes.

Then the dead start moving again, it starts out slowly. Eyes open, bodies movie. Eventually they get up and wander about aimlessly. They slowly regain some of their senses and motor skills over the course of the movie, but are still zombies and ""have no pulse.""

I think the movie was executed pretty well. It wasn't a big actioner, so don't go in expecting a super-fast thrill-ride with lots of explosions. There was some amount of chasing that went on toward the end of the movie. But, ultimately it was more of a slow-burn, ever-so-slightly atmospheric movie. In all, I thought it was pretty competently made and accomplished what it set out to do. Even if it wasn't a Planet Terror or Zombieland or Last of the Living...

The David Carradine cameo was a little forced. But it was nice to see him in one of his last roles... Even if the character was a little ""off"" and didn't believe that his mother was dead. ""She's only sick... The dead don't move!""

In the final analysis, despite it being a bit slow to get started and not being an actioner, I found it a likable zombie flick. Certainly better than Dead Meat, at any rate.",1293408000,,1798,4.5510835913312695

The problem is the suspense is built clear to the end of the movie meaning nothing really happens except a lot of talking and crying. After people wander amongst the zombies with no repercussions throughout, by the time something actually does happen one tends not to care. The character and animal you see killed in this movie, by being ripped apart, don't even scream. They just sink down as if going to sleep which is exactly what the viewer is tempted to do. That's right, character and animal, both singular tense. It's that much of a snoozer. Basically this movie resembles what would happen if you took a good zombie flick and edited out all the exciting parts. The result isn't completely horrible but fails at being entertaining. At the end one character is described as having grief larger than his zest for life. This is a perfect description of the film.

The film, well, could have been much better for the budget. I'll not blame the awful DVD transfer on the filmmakers though! Really horrible ghosting during dark scenes (quite a few).

The acting was not so great, but totally fine for the budget.

Makeup (zombies): Quite good! Kudos to the FX crew.

Sound: Very good. Nice ominous soundtrack and decent diagetic sound.

Screenplay: A few issues here with the script. The novels were based in Britain, yet the film was shot in Canada, yet most of the actors were British, accents, speech and all! The Emma character was Canadian or American, so it seemed quite off to hear her using British words. Track instead of road, etc...

Editing: OK, here is where we went from 3 stars to 2. Some scenes were really slopped together, or even transposed. For instance, there is a scene with bodies attracted to the sound of the generator at Penn Farm that clearly needed to go BEFORE the scene where Paul, Mike and Emma first venture out into a town to pickup needed supplies to bring back to the farm. The behavior of the bodies is paramount to this story working. Flip flopping these scenes was ham-fisted and paid no service at all to Moody's material.

Another editing note: Was the clown really necessary?

I'd really like to see this done right, but I doubt it will happen unless the re-releases of the novels build some sort of steam... damn shame, really.",1285804800,17,1555,4.649635036496351

This is the type where the evolution of being a zombie develops with the film story line and so, these are not ""rip you up right out of the box"" zombies - but you can see their evolution is headed that way and so it is a developing world situation that is getting worse day by day and the zombies are developing-too. 5 stars for the nice film quality, not bad at all acting, story development, and cerebral nibbling (by dead mice).",1277856000,6,723,4.077464788732394

I really liked Autumn's different take on zombies. They start off as lumbering and harmless, then very slowly begin regaining motor control, becoming more dangerous as the movie progresses. Yes, it's slow in spots, the acting isn't great, some of the camera work is confusing and the dialog is muddied and hard to follow at times, but the movie does have a certain creep factor going for it because you never know how dangerous the zombies actually are at any given time.

4097657,2,B0039UAA58,"Autumn (Steven Rumbelow, 2009)

It should be noted, first, that while David Moody's Autumn quartet has become a self-publishing success story (including netting Moody a publishing contract with St. Martin's, who are slowly re-releasing all his stuff) and singlehandedly sparked an explosion in small-press zombie literature, the books themselves aren't all that great. Yes, they're loads of fun, retool (if not reimagine) the zombie paradigm nicely, and ask a lot of interesting questions in a meta sort of way. But they're not terribly well-written. Still, great movies have been made from mediocre books (think The Silence of the Lambs here). So I held out some small hope that Steven Rumbelow would take the first book in the series and turn it into some sort of minor masterpiece. More fool me.

Autumn is the story of a small group of survivors who are left behind by some sort of fast-acting plague that wipes out billions of people in the space of a few heartbeats. While the novel focuses on one band that gets together in a school building and then splits off into different groups, the movie, after paying token lip service to the school bit (five minutes or thereabouts, it's a much larger portion of the book), focuses on one splinter group from the original mass: Michael (Kick-Ass' Dexter Fletcher), Emma (Lana Kamenov in her first screen appearance), and Carl (British TV character actor Dickon Tolson; American audiences may remember him from a recurring role on the sitcom Growing Pains). There's tension in the group, as there was in the larger group, and it gets worse when the billions of corpses struck down by the disease get up and start walking around...

This is, in many ways, the basis for every post-Romero zombie movie, though Moody, in his novels, was very interested in shifting things around to make it obvious he was questioning the conventions of the genre. (Most interestingly, perhaps, Moody's zombies do not crave human flesh.) Rumbelow, on the other hand, adapting Moody's novel, feels the need to high-five a number of zombie films, most notably Romero's original Dawn of the Dead. These two things do not necessarily have to live in exclusivity; Rumbelow's zombies don't eat people, either. But it's kind of synecdochic of the way this adaptation goes; wherever Moody zigs in the books, the movie zags, and we end up with a conventional zombie flick.

Not that this would necessarily be a bad thing; conventional zombie films still have a lot of mileage in them, as recent movies like The Mad and Dance of the Dead showed nicely. And these days having no budget is no excuse to make a bad movie, either (think DeadBirds or Lockout as an example of a stellar microbudget release). So what is this creature I have before me? It's a movie where a pretty darned good cast was picked up (including David Carradine in a small but memorable role), put in front of the camera, and wasted. There are some decent performances here; both Carradine and Kamenov are at least competent, though the zombies are more animated than anyone else in the film. Problem is, those performances don't connect to anything. Sticking with the bigger-picture aspect of the book might have helped this a bit, but I think a lot of things were short-circuited by the seemingly minor changes Rumbelow made (for example, the zombie makeup, which is really good, but doesn't belong in this flick; when it's obvious that the zombies are zombies, some of the confusion scenes just plain don't make sense--including the climactic one). The end result is a confusing mess that could have been a really good movie, but is instead one to avoid. * ",1271289600,51,3647,4.875806451612903

You will or won't.  What I mean by this is that this covers the first book of the series and it sets everything up for the later books.  In a nutshell, almost everyone on the planet dies.  There are survivors that don't know what to do.  Several of the survivors that have banded together determine that it isn't safe where they are and leave.  You then follow the story of Carl, Emma and Mike.  This story isn't fast paced but it is very true to the story.  I liked the books and liked the movie.  It is nice when you can see things in the movie that happened in the book.  The scene with David Carradine is important in the series and is downplayed in the movie if I remember right.  Anyway, if you are a zombie fan, you may or may not like this movie.

4097659,1,B0039UAA58,"The positive Amazon reviews for Autumn were paid for, the negative ones voted down by people involved with the movie. It's voted 3/10 on IMDB by hundreds of voters, 'nuff said.

As you probably know, most new zombie films aren't going to be as good as 28 Days Later. But Autumn is one of those movies that doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as the 2002 Danny Boyle classic.

The cinematography is uninspiring, the lighting is awful, and there doesn't seem to be any color correction. The sound quality is poor, the editing is terrible, and the use of slow motion during the action sequences is annoying. There are also inconsistencies like the story taking place in Canada, yet half of the survivors have British accents. Even if this wasn't a low-budget movie, there's one reason why this film will bore you: the zombies aren't scary.

For most of the film, the zombies aren't dangerous. They mill around the town like bored cows, and the survivors casually walk past them. Even when the zombies become aggressive towards the end of the film, they're still not scary. The survivors only have to push them down and briskly jog away to escape. The only character that you actually see killed by a zombie has to stand still and allow them to do so.

I've been a fan of lead actor Dexter Fletcher, ever since his work in Layer Cake as well as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. He delivers a great performance, though it's not enough to save the film. I'm not sure how the budget allowed for the casting of David Carradine, but it's not surprising that he's in the movie for only a few minutes.

It's funny that another reviewer describes it as a brilliant film deserving of five stars. Newsflash: real horror fans don't watch zombie movies for Oscar performances and deep philosophical themes. If the zombies aren't threatening, they aren't scary. Nobody wants to watch a zombie film that isn't suspenseful.

This wasn't even worth a Redbox rental, I can't imagine why anyone would want to own a copy of the DVD.",1270166400,10,2035,4.654596100278551

This is an incredibly boring movie, maybe moreso than any movie I've ever seen, and its attempts at being emotionally and psychologically captivating fall very short.

If you're a fan of whip-smart zombie movies (although the word is never used, come on, they're freaking zombies already, not ""meatcoats""), like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pontypool/dp/B002TZS5G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pontypool</a>, and you have more patience for nuance and sophistication than our young reviewer friend did, then ""Autumn"" is extremely rewarding.

It's light on the scares and heavy on horror...the emotional, psychological horror of death and of the dead.  The way the dead start off inanimate, immobilized (as the dead should be) and gradually, gradually gain the characteristics of the zombies we know from the Romero oeuvre and his imitators is the masterstroke of the film, allowing tension to ratchet up slowly.  And for a low budget film, ""Autumn"" boasts some exquisite camera work that only fleetingly becomes so creative as to be annoying.

Now don't misunderstand: ""Autumn"" is not ""Citizen Cane.""  It is a ZOMBIE movie, at its heart.  But even though it has many of the elements familiar to the genre, the approach is fresh, and the emphasis on psychology rather than mere viscera elevates ""Autumn"" well beyond what the genre usually produces.  I'd go so far as to recommend ""Autumn"" to someone who I don't think would typically enjoy zombie movies, and I would only say that of perhaps three other such movies (aforementioned two, plus&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/B0006A9FKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun of the Dead</a>).

The book was an epic story, similar to the Triffids in its broad destruction and the slow start to the action.  I saw some reviewers didn't like the sudden die-off, but that was the essence of the story if you read it.  One day, everyone died all at once.  The survivors banded together in a helpless group hoping to figure it out before the main characters took off on their own.  That's about it.

My only take away that could be favorable was the one somewhat likable character.  Carl was played decent enough and had a reason for most things he did that I found tolerable.  The other two merely proved something I  have been saying a while now.  Zombies want to eat your brains, and in the cases of people with little brain matter it takes them a while to get around to going for them.  Scarecrow from Wizard of Oz and my buddy at work would be save for years.
Seriously though, what was there to like about this movie?  What was innovative except the zombies evolved into killing machines over months rather than days which most of the genre used?  I found the two main characters more aggravating than worthwhile or likable.  Couple pf points on that.
SPOILER ALERT.
Big strike 1 against the guy in the first couple of minutes.  He is an educator, and when his students start getting sick....he stands there looking only slightly confused.  If all of them had hurled then keeled over a exactly the same time within a 10 second period, maybe.  But the scene took a couple minutes and gave the impression it was even longer.  We hear so often about amazing things educators do, yet this mooch stands there doing one of the better zombie impressions in the movie.  Then sort of saunters out of the place when the bell rings.  I'm supposed to like a guy that is going to let my child die without even a reaction?
Girl buries head in the sand, effectively.  Under the covers with head phones on so she doesn't have to deal with things.  Yet this is going to be our heroine who survives when most others can't?  Of course, all she really needed was to get with teacher and all would be good.  Because Mr. and Ms. Pretentious were going to make a great couple.
See why I called the two of them pretentious?  They said and did a lot of the right things, but did so from a soap box above the mere commoners who must die eventually.  Neither established themselves at any point as being a better survivor than a redneck 12 year old, but still they must be superior...because the author said so?

Okay, enough for now.  The main thing I take away from this and so many of these movies is  that a lot of people are going to suck it in the apocalypse.  Mostly people in the cities and the East and West coast.  Apparently you can include Canada in that grouping now.  At this point I only have a reasonable expectation of seeing a few scattered people that went to Zombieland, a few cockneys (Cockneys vs Zombies...excellence.) and whatever group Sean (of the Dead) was among surviving.  Most of the others are only going o survive until the zombies have finished the brains they can actually find.  The brain dead writers and actors and directors of these lame stream movies get theirs while dude is still trying to find Twinkies.

8392302,2,B0039UAA58,"This is the second time I've seen this film, one that gets totally trashed on various review sites and rates only 2.2 on the IMDb. Since Amazon was giving it free on Prime I thought I'd check it out to see if it was as bad as I originally thought. It actually improved for me on second viewing and I upped my IMDb rating from one star to three. Though even its technical aspects are rated poorly by viewers, I found the cinematography at times quite good, and there are good shots of Autumn leaves and such. The film was made in the Hamilton, Ontario area (on the western tip of Lake Ontario) which explains the pictures of the Queen on the wall, the accents (which actually sound more British than Canadian), and yet the signs in stores in dollars and driving on the right side of the road.

The film is based on the first book of a popular book series by David Moody, who wrote six altogether. If that sounds too long for a basic zombie series, it is. The film, in fact, was technically called Autumn I - they had great hopes here. Autumn gets wildly and totally trashed on book review sites, mostly for poor writing and lots of examples are given so you can't really disagree. But when it was rejected by every publisher he gave it away for free on the internet and it became a runaway hit. In his defense I will say that his later books and book series get better reviews, so he seems to have learned something.

The six-volume origin of the source material explains why it takes a long time for the zombies to literally get moving, do anything but bump into things, and only at the very end become violent and flesh eating. This was my main objection the first time. I expected at least a standard zombie scenario, but here you just walk through h zombies because they don't do anything. The survivors end up in the usual remote farm house and when they decide to fortify the grounds they use a waist-high fence you buy rolled up, the kind of fence you use to keep the dog out of the garden. And it keeps the zombies out. Really! So, yes, it's really lame in many ways. It's also incredibly slow at nearly two hours and the director pads it with irrelevant dream sequences, futile excursions and what all, even though it would have been better as a tighter film. The whole David Carradine sequence must have been added just to have his name. It's totally irrelevant and if it was cut you wouldn't miss a thing. The acting overall is okay, though the way the script has them acting is often illogical and stupid. The zombie makeup is different, an oily mix of red and black all over the faces and lots of bad teeth; it was one of the things that was effective.

So the second time around I sort-of liked it since I knew not to expect a real zombie fest. It's a moody take of a small group's journey into total despair. I'm not recommending it, but if you're in the mood for something like that, it's okay. And having seen a huge number of zombie movies I can assure you there are worse.",1489017600,5,2990,4.32620320855615
