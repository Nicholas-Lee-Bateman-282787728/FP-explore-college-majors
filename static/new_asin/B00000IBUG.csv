1220852,4,B00000IBUG,"I will start off by saying that this is not the greatest anime film/ova that I have ever seen, but it is still pretty good. I suppose I may have a higher opinion of this ova than some others will and that may be because I saw this when I was still pretty young and it was also one of my first expierences with anime. While the plot can be somewhat spotty at times I think that overall if you remain open minded about it you should be able to enjoy it. They story is an interesting twist on the historical japanses warlord Nobunaga Oda and his right hand general Ranmaru Mori repainting the two as demons. What follows in an intriguing story of 3 ninjas from different schools uniting to end Nobunaga's reign of evil. Along the way our three heroes encounter a few intersting allies as well as the Host of Oboro including the 7 Oboro ninja, Nobunaga's top generals/assassins. Again while the plot can be a bit thin at times most of the fights are pretty good. Overall I would probably give this an 8/10, but I may be a little generous with that rating. If you can watch it online or rent it somewhere I would recommend it before buying it if you are unsure about Wrath of the Ninja.",1362441600,,1181,4.276785714285714

*Spoilers*

Unfortunately, it's often easy to tell when an anime movie is a complete series distilled into a single feature film, and ""Wrath of the Ninja"" is a good example of this. The movie starts off well, with the initial and hostile meeting of two of the (as yet unknown) chosen trio of ninjas, only to have their battle interrupted by a new, and frightening, common opponent.

Despite this interesting hook in the beginning, though, the movie quickly rushes into gibberish, falling victim to doing too much in too short a time span. After episodic events such as an enemy attack, the film will leap forward several seasons, with a quick exposition voice over that leaves far too much unexplained for the uninitiated to follow. The result is a film that will be unsatisfying for everyone - fans of the series will be irritated by how much was cut; new viewers will be confused and finally bored with the sequence of apparently unconnected events that leave no real emotional impact in their wake.

""Wrath of the Ninja"" isn't a *bad* movie in the traditional, awful sense - but it's rushed and frenetic and confusing. In order to meet the feature film length, motivation and character development have been almost entirely cut. In its place, the writers have dropped a bunch of cliches and stereotypes to prop up the action, and I suppose if they were happy with a mediocre, cliche-ridden film then good for them, but most viewers are going to be disappointed, and it's particularly infuriating to be lost for the entire movie because the politics and warfare strategies couldn't be explained a little further, but they DID find time to have the Wangsty male ninja hit up on the Serious female ninja with the obligatory ""you're not being feminine enough"" guilt stick. Oh, yeah, and the movie commits the cardinal sin of the ""Bait and Switch Boss"" trope, which is truly bad enough in video games but should never, ever be used in movies.

I wouldn't really recommend ""Wrath of the Ninja"", but it's not the worst movie in the world. Oddly, it's one of the few anime movies where the English subtitles for the hearing impaired actually match the English dubs a little bit, which is pleasant in and of itself.

1220855,5,B00000IBUG,"I love Anime. I bought this DVD version for one reason and one reason alone. So that I would not have to watch or listen to the dubbed version. I cannot stand the English dubbing. My advise to anyone watching a foriegn film; watch it in its original language, no one else can do the characters justice. That is my opinion.
Anyways, that matter aside, let's talk about the movie.
Yes, it has extremely graphic violence, but it states that on the DVD. (Contains brief nudity and Graphic Violence, Parental Discretion Advised). Gore is not what this anime is about. There is actually a great historical storyline interwoven within all its action and suspense.
3 Ninjas from different clans unite to ward off Evil. Each Ninja with their own special sword, come together as one. Evil is rampant, Lord Nobunaga Oda with his evil intentions sends out all his evil artillery to smash the Ninjas and thier allies. His goal, to spread evil and demons throughout the land.
Ayame, is a young girl who sees her life and family shattered before her innocent eyes, yet she is helpless to do anything. Vengeance becomes her lifelong obsession. Ryoma, a Ninja from a neighboring clan, kindhearted and sweet is her companion and ally. And of course, Sakon (my favorite guy) is the Ninja who can feel the treachery of those around him, and sees the battles and evil as never ending.
I will not say anymore, but I seriously recommend this movie. Take my advise and watch this great animated movie. I has everything, including Love.",1039046400,33,1511,4.7272727272727275
1220856,5,B00000IBUG,"Although this was one of the first anime movies I had seen, it has remained my favorite throughout these years.  It has a good plot, though I've heard its still missing some parts that are included in the VHS version.  My favorite character is Ayame, who is both beautiful and skilled.  If you like ninjas, then this movie is for you.  It was really touching, some scenes even brought tears to my eyes.",1037145600,8,402,4.465753424657534
1220857,5,B00000IBUG,"Wrath of the ninja is a good movie purely for the action scenes. The story is average the characters are OK the animation is good I suppose.. BUT THE ACTION IS SWEET!!!! Tons of people complain about the lack of an indepth story. Well it's true. There isn't a ""princess mononoke plot"". but who cares? If you can sit back watch this movie and appreciate it for what it is - not an indepth brain teaser - but a non-stop hack and slash anime you will most likely enjoy it.",1022457600,11,469,4.222222222222222
1220858,2,B00000IBUG,"This movie is very poorly done.  And I'm not just talking about the anime itself, I'm talking about how they took the OVA series (300+ minutes) of this and cut it down into a movie (87 minutes).  I'm glad this doesn't happen to all anime series, that would be for shame.
The movie itself isn't that bad, its just I cannot give this DVD, nor any butchered version of the OVA series a good rating.  The series features 3 ninjas fighting against Nobunaga Oda (an evil ruler at one time in Japan's history) as they try and stop his attempts to take over the world.  The movie is kind of a beast/ninja movie which would fare over well for some viewers, but it failed to capture my interest.
  With all of my personal opinons aside, the DVD itself does include some good extras.  With deleted scenes being the key extras on the disc, it also has a ""meet the cast"" option as well with the traditional U.S. MANGA ""DVD Sneak Peaks"".
  Overall, I'm sad that this could-be great anime was delivered in such a poor way.  If you can overlook the fact that you won't be seeing the entire movie no matter what when you buy the DVD (even if they give you 2-3 deleted scenes), then you should probably pick this up.  Also, if you are a fan of the ninja/demon beast genre it wouldn't hurt to check it out.",1021507200,12,1287,4.2987551867219915

In its original 3-part form, Yotoden is a wonderful, fast-paced anime with a gripping and involving storyline that keeps you hooked to the very end. In this version,  however, over 30 minutes of fantastic (and necessary) footage has been  inexplicably cut, resulting in a movie that is totally disjointed and  difficult to follow. Major plot and character developments have been  removed in a careless and seemingly desultory fashion and scenes have been  rearranged in a futile attempt to tie together the now-jumbled storyline.  Couple this with a horrible dubbing job and subtitles done by someone who  is obviously painfully unfamiliar with the linguistic nuances of Japanese  in reference to historical events and you have a nearly unwatchable anime.

In the year 1580 during Japan's Sengoku period, Lord Oda Nobunaga seeks to unify Japan with the aid of his warriors the Seven Oboro Ninja. His armies are destroying entire clans, but one of his goals is to wipe out the descendants of the Three Shadow Schools. One descendant, a female ninja named Ayanosuke, barely escapes the total annihilation of her people and village. Before her escape, she is given a short sword with a legend. The legend states that the sword will eliminate evil and bring peace. During her travels, she encounters two other ninjas with weapons that carry the exact same legend. -summary

Released in 1989, Wrath of the Ninja is the 87 minute, condensed version of the original three episode OVA Wrath of the Ninja: The Yotoden Saga, which ran for 138 minutes. Unlike other anime films that have been sliced and diced from series into movie format, Wrath of the Ninja is one of the better titles out there, as it still manages to tell a coherent story, and really doesn't feel as rushed as some claim it to be. The anime does manage to tie up its major plot elements leaving nothing left open. Surprisingly, the film is a lot better to me after re-watching it again after so long. In all honesty though, someone who has never seen the original OVA probably won't even notice much of a difference.

Wrath of the Ninja is an action packed fantasy with horror elements, that not only features battles between man, but also against grotesque demons that will be seen feasting on human corpses. To include, one character raises the dead which is made up of headless and torn up bodies to do battle. The anime pulls very little punches with its violence and dark tone. I really enjoyed the dark atmosphere in several segments. It's also a plus that the anime does not at all contain comedic moments to lighten up the mood. This one element actually harms many titles, and sometimes can make it difficult for me to take serious what I'm watching.

Wrath of the Ninja has a pretty straight forward story and plot utilizing the good vs. evil theme, along with old legends bringing together a small group fighting for peace or revenge. The anime does kind of lack in character development though. The three main characters Ayanosuke, Sakon, and Ryoma are well developed for the most part, and I also enjoy how some of the character development isn't completely spoon-fed. I don't prefer my stories or characters motives to be spelled out for me at every turn. However, the villains seem to suffer from the same issues the villains in Ninja Scroll suffer from, which is the complete lack of diversity. They're all completely one dimensional stock bad guys. The secondary cast are very poorly done, and several of them die dramatic deaths. I can't imagine any viewer truly growing a liking to any of them, much less caring about their fates. Believe it or not, despite the longer run length, the OVA makes this exact same mistake.

The animation is pretty good and doesn't have much of a dated feel. The backgrounds are well lit when called for, such as during the burning of towns and villages, and the darkness seemed to fit comfortably when necessary. The action scenes can also be pretty good with a few hand to hand and sword exchanges. There's a real good amount of gore and graphic deaths, such as characters being shot to death with muskets, and heads exploding in very graphic detail. However, there were numerous shortcuts taken with reused cels and stills on static backgrounds. I can kind of forgive this when taking under consideration the age of the title.

I thought the artwork was well done with nice traditional character designs, along with the freakish designs for some of the monsters. There's also a small bit of nudity that is actually within reason. Although I can't say it was great or memorable, the soundtrack did its job by enhancing the viewing experience for me.

The voice acting is a mixed bag here. Normally, I prefer to watch dubs but the English version has several annoying voice actors, and this goes for the villains especially. Although the voices did fit very well with the characters overall appearance. I felt some of them went a little over board trying to be evil and the performances felt too forced. The sub doesn't make this mistake, and the Japanese seiyuu felt a lot more natural, with some of the villains having a menacing feel to them. When compared to the three episode OVA, the story really isn't as engrossing because it feels too by the numbers. The OVA takes a lot more time actually telling a story, and it utilizes a narration covering moments of the war, and the viewer can have a better understanding of at least one of the ninja clans dire situation.

Overall, Wrath of the Ninja is a solid movie, but I only recommend picking up the two disk version. The movie on its own is not something I would consider to be a must see, in fact, I don't consider the OVA to be a must see either, especially for the casual anime fan. I would only recommend this to the most serious otakus.
