1687532,5,B0000633QN,"Wow I just love to be able to pick what episode I want.  The DVD  'extras' are excellent too. This series had a very original creative element I have never seen anywhere before, you could tell the LEXX set designers and wardrobe people were very professional in their creative work making cheesy and tacky look so very out of this world good! The special effects are like a cross between Flash Gordon meets the Matrix meets Austin Powers!  Only it is isn't, it's all LEXX and all original. By the way, saying this is geared towards European teens? is way off, what a lame review!, this is for every Sci Fi fan that ever wanted a break from the typical creature vs. Earth story line, it is more like a psycadelic soap opera set in the future in a galaxy far, far away from every day Earth life, a great way to 'escape' from everyday life.",1086220800,21,837,4.352564102564102
1687533,4,B0000633QN,"4.5 stars.  I just want to note here that there are numerous scenes where the transfer to DVD is less than perfect.  Other times, particularly the special effects shots, the transfer is pristine.  This is possibly, arguably, the most original Sci-fi series ever created and it was a mild letdown to see a flawed transfer.  However, all these episodes are the uncut versions, and I seriously don't remember this much sexual innuendo(oftentimes bizarre sexual innuendo).  But this show always was a little more than left-of-center, which is certainly why it appealed to me so much.  Just when I thought there was nothing original on TV, along comes this weird series in the 2a.m. time-slot like a warm wind filled with fresh air.  For beginners I suggest getting the first series volumes for a more in-depth backstory on these strangely captivating characters.  After that, this is an excellent progression.  The stories are crazy and fun, and each volume here contains over three hours of footage.  This series has great return value, it's just too bad the transfer is less than perfect.",1081900800,38,1086,4.983333333333333
1687534,5,B0000633QN,"It is my opinion that the second series of Lexx is the best of the 4.
In this series you get a collection of stand-alone episodes that only hint at an undelying plotline that reveals itself fully in the last few episodes. The Stand alone episodes bring out the risqu humour this series is known for. Each episode is a new adventure and are well worth spending the time to watch.
The special features are bare minimum. If you purchase DVDs based on the special features all you're really getting is quizzes based on the episodes on the DVD.",1080864000,22,539,4.454545454545454
1687535,3,B0000633QN,"I love Lexx.  The featurettes are cool, the quality of the transfer seems good.  However, I was very disappointed to find that the episodes are not closed-captioned or subtitled at all.  If you are hearing-impaired, you might want to skip the DVD's and see if you can find someone who recorded the episodes from Sci-Fi, where most, with a few exceptions, ran with closed captioning.",1062028800,12,382,4.846153846153846
1687536,4,B0000633QN,"The first season is the best but the second season is quite good. Pay attention to the other ""real people"" that have reviewed it. First of all LEXX was out long before Farscape so the ridiculous line about sound familiar is out of context. LEXX is unique in its approach to SciFi. It is far more graphic in violence and erotic behavior than other series you will see. I have purchased the first two seasons on DVD since I think they are the best. The rest are worth seeing but I am not sure about buying.",1055116800,34,504,4.260416666666667
1687537,5,B0000633QN,"If you can watch the firdt episode (I worship his shadow) and you enjpoy its campy yet well developed story then you will fall in love with the entire series. I have never ordered a DVD of a series before, let alone a sci-fi series, but this set usurps star wars in its campy intrigue and totally overshadows Dune's monopoly on a fairly original story line and immmersive, if less than state of the art, special effects. Many tongue in cheek jokes lend the series to a ""don't take yourself too seriously"" attitude which lets the viewer accept the flick for what it is. A work of sci-fi indy genius which only a few will truly appreciate.",1048896000,11,637,4.452991452991453
1687538,5,B0000633QN,"This is without-a-doubt my favorite show. I don't know exactly how, but from the first episode I saw I loved it.
Lexx is a wonderful series, enthralling, comical, dramatic, (and sometimes a bit naughty) Lexx is a well-rounded series worth a good look. ;)",1035158400,6,254,4.795454545454546
1687539,3,B0000633QN,"First things first. If you have not seen Lexx season 3 at all, do not watch the interview with film editor Stewart Dowds as he completely gives away the major plot theme for season 3 before the episode (which is not on this disc) which actually reveals it. How that got through I have to wonder.
I actually bought my Season 1 (the four movies) DVDs, Season 2 and Season 3 DVDs from a Canadian outfit called Videoflicks with a website of the same name (add a dot com to their name). This would make sense that you can get the entire show new there, as it is a Canadian-German co-production. There is slight variation as I guess by law they have to include French language tracks but I imagine they are essentially the same as the ones sold here. It is funny to hear the cast, especially the Lexx in French as we're not used to it, I guess.
If you haven't seen any of Season 3, probably best to skip this review as I go into some events that occur in the first disc and assume some knowledge of prior events. The first episode (Gondola) starts as the crew of the Lexx pursue Duke and Fifi after the moth attack on Boomtown. An interesting situation has been put forward that by now, people they've met in past episodes and seasons who then died seem to be re-appearing on Fire or Water with alarming regularity, though with new names and no memory of their prior life. So, in a way it makes sense that since Kai died when His Divine Shadow killed him at the start of the first movie, he would have been reincarnated on Water. So, it does provide an explanation as to why there is now two of them. An interesting point to ponder here does that leave the re-animated corpse who is also Kai? Is he an separate entity or just a machine with no free will?
Anyway, ""Gondola"" is probably the best of the three episodes as having crash landed their moth, the crew of the Lexx have to rebuild one of Fire's flying machines to make it back to shelter before the heat kills them. They end up picking up a couple of survivors and then the dilemma is now having too much weight on board, how do they make it across the Red Hot Sea? Not surprisingly death and treachery come into play. We learn that Prince's power extends past just that of mere re-incarnation.
""K-Town"" After a forced landing on a tower called K-Town, we seem to get the impression that the future is full of psychotic Germanic types, in this case who seem to alternate between deep depression and homicidal craziness within a few minutes, the later being particularly bad news for the crew of the Lexx since it involves being chased over bottomless pits and having rocks thrown at them. Keeping with the theme of the show, they do encounter a past character. I won't say who it is, though I guess the recap at the start would make it obvious. What they were supposed to contribute to the season in anyone's guess as they are shuffled out as mysteriously as they were brought in. Though the enigmatic statement is made ""perhaps this is my punishment"" does give a clue to the nature of Fire and Water. You also get to see what Kai wears under his assassin's uniform. Eye opening stuff.
""Tunnels"" has our intrepid heroes trying to make it from K-Town to another tower. Not surprisingly, they are also full of homicidal lunatics. Prince who we would have all pegged as the bad guy by now tries to help though undoubtably there's something in it to him. Given what happened in earlier episodes, we should all have a strong suspicion as to what's happening next
at the end of this episode.
This season is 13 episodes, which is probably why it has been a bit awkward to put onto DVD and why they've gone 4,3,3,3 with the episodes. Assuming technically 5 episodes to a disc isn't possible, preventing 4,4,5. Lexx is available 5 episodes to a set in the UK but each set contains 2 discs which is even weirder. There has been a price cut per disc to compensate for there being less episodes per disc this season. Presumably it will be back to 4 episodes a disc for season 4, which numbered 24 episodes (more friendly to being divided by 4).
Drawbacks with this disc would probably be the lack of material in the extra features. The quiz is the sort of thing you only ever bother with once. The interview with Stewart Dowds is interesting and features about 30 seconds of footage from a Season 4 episode (I'm guessing Apocalexx Now, I haven't actually seen it), but only runs for a bit over 2 minutes. The making of Season 3 is also interesting with interviews with Michael McManus (Kai), Brian Downey (Stanley), Nigel Bennett (Prince) and the Director of ""Gondola"". Some special effects work and design sketches are also covered but there could have been more than the five or so minutes in length it is. So far, the four making of specials spread over the four discs of season 1 are the best so far.  Creatitivity with search engines and looking north of the border in Maple leaf territory will help you find those.
As for the episodes themselves, they seem to be in a holding pattern between the start of the series and what must be coming later. Not a great deal happens, nor does it advance the plot as much as you would expect for the length of 3 episodes. Kai seemed to spend a lot of time throwing himself from great heights to fix himself according to the ""thump the electric gadget to make it work"" school of practice. I'm of the opinion that what K-Town and Tunnels covered probably could have been condensed into 1 episode.
Interestingly enough, these 3 episodes do not feature 790 or the Lexx.",1024704000,12,5548,4.444553483807654
1687540,4,B0000633QN,"An excellent DVD and a brilliant series. A shame the release dates are so far apart.
I never had the opportunity to see series III on TV, so these episodes are new to me. I have found that series three has much more of a consistent plot than earlier series, although all are far more consistent than most Sci-Fi series.
My only complaint was that this DVD had only tree episodes, whereas all prior DVD's had four. I would also like to see the original films released on DVD, if they are not already.",1022716800,2,499,4.319148936170213

Very well done.  The next two episodes are put together like a briliantly twisted and elongated Monty Python sketch.  Very funny stuff but not for eveyone.  Keep in mind it is 100% gratuitious.

1687569,3,B0000633QN,"My review for Season 2 of ""Lexx"" is pretty much identical to what I wrote for season 1.  This is a bare bones release, with no animated menus or special features at all.  No chapter selections or alternate languages or subtitles.  Just the episodes themselves to watch, either all at once with a ""play all"" feature on the main menu.  Or off of a sub menu with the episodes individually listed to view.

They could have made the transfer better if they had simply added more discs and not crammed 9 episodes on the first 2 discs each, and then only 2 episodes on the third disc.  This made no sense doing it this way, it was completely unbalanced.  With less episodes per disc the better the quality of the video would be on each disc, there is no need to fit all that video onto a single disc except to be cheap.  This would have been a better release if they had done it 4 episodes spread out over 5 discs, but I guess Echo Bridge wanted to take the cheap way out and literally save just a couple of bucks by squeezing too much video onto 3 discs.

The discs themselves are not labeled at all with episode titles or any number marking of any kind, until you put them in your player you don't know if you are watching disc 1, 2, or 3.  This will be a problem for people who are not familiar with the show and don't know the episode order.  They could have at least put some effort into letting the user know the disc order to watch in by labeling them ""Disc 1"" and so on..

Very cheap and lazy release just like season 1 was.  The show is amazing and it deserved to be released better then it was here by a two bit hack studio.  Amazing show to watch, but treated very poorly by Echo Bridge, who seem to have put more effort into their opening logo sequence at the beginning of the discs then in the actual disc quality themselves.",1410307200,,1831,4.17948717948718

It's certainly different from any other sci-fi series out there with a cast of three hapless characters and a really bad talking robot head.  Had to leave it to one of the premium channels (showtime) to produce it as I doubt any cable network would have been able to get the ad revenue to support it, much less four seasons of it.  It's one of those scripts where you say ""oh, don't go in there, you'll be caught"" and then they go in there.  Unique?  Thankfully yes, one series like this is more than enough, really.

1687585,5,B0000633QN,"How the *beep* isn't this more famous?

ATTENTION TO ALL SCI-FI FANS LOOKING FOR AN EPIC SHOW: This is the ONE show where they don't spend 99% of the time inside the ship, talking. On this one, we actually discover a wide-range of new, strange, bizarre and original worlds and locations. OH YES.

It's ten times more entertaining, creative and imaginative than every other sci-fi series out there, except maybe for Farscape which I also bought the complete series and will begin watching when I'm done with Lexx.

Really though, I know some effects aren't good but if you can get past that then this is by far the best sci-fi series you'll get. With every new episode they dare to go even further instead of spending 99% of the episode inside the ship like all sci-fi series do and it's just so original you can't help but be enthralled by it. You've got so many: they go to The Cluster, to Brunnis, to Pattern, then to Mantrid's Ice Planet, MedStat (space hospital), Luvliner (space brothel), TV World, the space jury, 791's industrial planet, Nook, Ruuma and Woz, and that's only until season 2. Then you've got the BEST season which is S3 with the epic saga between the Fire & Water planets, plus all locations on Earth in the 4th season, like the stylish Transylvania episodes and the tropical beach in Xevivor, to name a few.

Lexx has something going for it that's rare and even exciting: it's just so damn imaginative. The plot can be hard to follow, the acting isn't always great, and the direction can seem pallid at times... but the art direction and just basic inventiveness and originality are remarkable. What Lexx does so well that few others shows can do is introduce you to a completely new world, something so fresh and bizarre that you can watch the same episode several times in different moods and have different experiences as a result.

And again, the art direction is ASTOUNDING: there are many scenes in this show, particularly the first and third season, that if frozen as a still and mounted as a poster would be better than the art in most people's homes. Lexx is like nothing you have ever seen before, or will again. It's very, very hard to describe it. You have to see it for yourself. You'll either hate it or, like me, join thousands who still think this is a series way ahead of its time, and the best & most underrated and underseen sci-fi to have ever graced the little screen.",1396483200,,2412,4.574074074074074

Kai is handsome, noble, heroic and very Spock like.
Stan is your regular friend who though goodhearted gets himself into a little too much trouble and gets his friends involved in it also. But you can't put it all on Stan. Sometimes Zev's ventures can be very adventurous.
Their hearts are grand enough to win for themselves the grandest of victories and it is delightful to get involved with them as a viewer. We are sad to not see them carrying on today but it is great to remember them in these excellent discs which hold their fine contributions of all involved in this work.

1687603,5,B0000633QN,"Well, you all probably know that 'Season One' was actually four 2-hour movies and featured Eva
Habermann as ""Zev"" the siren of space and...well you know...a sex slave. It also had guest stars,
Barry Bostwick in the 1st film, Tim Curry in the 2nd film, Rutger Hauer in the 3rd film and
Malcolm McDowell in the 4th film.

Oh, yeah, and don't forget the ""undead"" assassin. Now that is irony for you, a dead man that
kills people. I am not even going to begin to wax eloquent on that idea.

In Season Two you will get twenty 45-minute episodes with the overarching story of each one
is about an evil scientist who converts all matter of the ""light"" universe into one-armed 'Mantrid
drones'. The evil scientist is called, Mantrid, by the way. At the end of season Two the Lexx is
sent to the ""dark"" universe AKA, the Dark Zone.

Now the fun is all in between Episode 1 and Episode 20 of the second season. I am not going to
summarize each episode because that has been done here and on multiple web sites. If I were
you, don't bother. As Mantrid pursues the Lexx, the crew is faced with some wonderful and
highly unusual circumstances. There is one cast change and no real guest stars to boast about.

The second episode, ""Terminal"" is the last time Eva Havermann is featured as ""Zev"". In the third
episode, ""Lyekka"", you will find ""Zev"" replaced by ""Xev"", who is still a sexy female type humanoid
character. The episode after that, ""Luvliner"", the crew goes to a space brothel. I will stop here
for the journey is the pleasure with this wonderfully creative sci-fi thriller.

The best part of this series is the discovery of how this crew manages to get through another
episode without getting killed or having sex (well almost). Even with a sex slave, Zev (and later
Xev), on board the Lexx, the anticipation mounts, so to speak.  Well at least the sexual innuendo
and out and out sex, when it happens, is one thing that separates this from other sci-fi.

Season Two comes on 5 disks and is in a full screen aspect ratio of 1.33:1 and Dolby Stereo 2.0
sound. So don't fire up you 5.1 receiver because it won't add much. When you get to  Season
Three the entire season is focused on two planets, 'Fire' and 'Water', and leads to more indecent
and wonderful adventures.

If you like inventive, creative, off-beat, sexy, funny, fun and...did I say sexy already? Well, buy
this season after you watch the first ""season"" of films. It is marvelous fun throughout the episodes.
By the way, Lexx was voted, in June 2009, 23rd in a poll by SciFi magazine in the '25 Greatest SciFi
TV Shows'.

I gave it 5 stars because of its style, plots, writing, and art direction. Excellent fare for the child
within that can't get enough of adult science fiction. It is a pleasure to behold.

Kai, last of the Brunnen G, killed 2000 years earlier by His Divine Shadow and made into an indestructible undead assassin to serve His Shadow.
Although it isn't required to understand season 2, I recommend watching the 4 movies that make up season 1 as it will give a better understanding as to who these people are and also of things referred to in later seasons.
Lexx is made for adults TV as there are a lot of sexual jokes and innuendo and some minor nudity throughout the series. It is fun and very different. It may seem strange at first if you don't know the back story of season 1, but it was that same strangeness that kept me watching until I was completely hooked. An acquired taste..

I was thinking of returning this after reading a negative review for the season 4 echo bridge set, however I decided to open it and give it a try.  Picture quality is fairly good considering 9 shows are squeezed on disc 1 (no worse than I remember when it originally aired on the sci-fi channel and the digital Lexx and space scenes still look great).  Its true the discs are not labeled but they do have different colors and the number next to each bar code is different, its not a big deal - just pop one in the player to see the episode list.  I've since picked up season 1 and 3 and not much interest for the 4th as that year is forgettable other than for the final show.

When Lexx originally aired it was considered the evil twin of Star Trek, much darker in tone and theme.  Although I still find the characters interesting, music great, and the humor from 790 and Kai over the top.  Too bad many of the story lines don't hold up quite so well.

If you have seen Season 1 and really like the woman, you're out of luck.  She's gone by episode 3, to be replaced by a new actress.  They make modifications to the outfit, so it's not nearly as short a skirt and less exposure, if you're concerned with that.  There is mild nudity, but I recall no scenes with the main actress exposed.

Anyway, the show is about an oddball crew that ends up in possession of the most powerful ship, the Lexx.  They fly around the universe mostly trying to find a home or a good time.  There is an arch nemesis, but he's mostly absent from much of it.  The stories are generally interesting, though sometimes are a good idea for 30 minutes stretched to 45.

The most striking thing to me is the sheer number of deaths.  Aside from a planet/station/ship being blown up almost every other episode (not always their fault), just about everybody they meet dies at some point in the series, often fast, sometimes a few episodes later.  I enjoyed the campy nature of things, but if you have a young kid at least screen the episodes first to see which ones have objectionable material; if you count sexual innuendo it's pretty much all of them.",1338854400,,1370,4.410358565737051

A wild romp through-out the known and unknown universe with a cast of characters escaping the evil forces of the ""Shadow"" by stealing the organic, living starcraft known as ""Lexx"", also the most powerful weapon in the universe.  The unlikely Stanley Tweedle basically a very low-level type in the society of his planet (more or less a janitor) obtains the bio-electric code which allows him to control Lexx - the code is transferred to his hand and he activates Lexx by placing his hand onto a control panel and the living craft responds to his commands (one of my favorite characters is the ship itself, Lexx).

Tweedle's shipmates include Kai a undead assasin, Zev a former very obese woman transmuted into a svelte pleasure slave with amazingly violent tendicies and a robot head which remains enamored of her, and of course, Lexx the sentient craft.

During the series various planets are visited as they flee the forces of the ""Shadow"" with some zany escapades as they land on planet after planet.  The series is full of cameos by various actors.  There is quite a lot of ""tongue-in-cheek"" humor to many of the episodes and the ever present dangers they encounter.  Tweedle is a very unlikely hero filled with human character flaws, Zev is gorgeous and hungry for sex with Kai who rejects her advances while the robot head is infatuated with her and constantly remarks and attempts to act on his obsession for her.

I thoroughly enjoy the series and take exception to comparisons to a poor copy of Star Trek - I just don't see it.  In my opinion FarScape is a copy of this series to a large extent.

Now about the dvd set.

This is a wonderful series, the actors in this show do a wonderful job! season 2 picks up where the original mini series leave of ""Tales from a parallel universe"" Eva Habberman is in the first two shows then Xena takes over the role of zev. the season is mostly about mandred, and has some really good shows in this season. The writing staff did a great job making this series as awsum as it is and the actors did a great job portraying their roles in Lex.

The set is totally uncut and un censored, so i would not recomend kids seeing this show, there is partial nudity and alot of sexual inuendo. it is a scifi campy type show but its so well in being blended together it feels really unique in how it all plays out, making it feel totaly original, and very unique.

packaging, the set is packeged in a wierd fashion, some of the dvd's are difficult to set in the set case and oftem come loose. the first dvd in the set the transfer seems a little grainy but the other dvds seem fine.

Also, anyone paying attention to the series will eventually see various actors return in different roles throughout the series, probably the highest rate of such phenomena in any given TV series. Includes some relatively famous guest actors. The scores are still good, too. (includes a strong musical episode, a good three years before Buffy did it). Still plenty of social commentary and satire to go around, too. Some episodes are better than others, and that's what sites like geos.tv are for.

The three movies that came out first set the tone and layed the foundation.  It is unfortunate that they cann not be purchased affordably on DVD at this time.  Howerer, all of the main characters in their splendor appear here in their own very complete, unique and comical form in the Comlete Second Series.

Too bad the last two seasons ended so horribly.  In my opinion the last few years of the show were as painful and horrible to watch as most anything else now on commercial TV.  Having gotten that off of my chest, the movies and the second season (which I am highly recomending here)remain well worthwhile, full of creativity, wonder and adventure as few shows on modern TV have been able to capture in the past ten years.  Not recomended for the Moral Majority, it is no wonder the show appeared during the Clinton Administration and was hindered during the last few seasons by a lack of creative writing, money and what seemed to be an effort to make it ""politically correct and sanitized for our protection"" in the end.

Worth the price & very enjoyable.",1185580800,4,691,4.164179104477612
1687678,1,B0000633QN,"There are some interesting aspects to this series, but to say that it's ""good"" is misleading.

The background of the show is creative and interesting, and to some people it's worth a look just for that.  But the scripting and directing are really terrible.  A lot of the time the actors just stand around looking like they're trying to fake it while they remember their lines. There is no emotional immediacy or suspense, and you never worry about the fate of any of the characters because they themselves only seem mildly interested.  The characters often seem to be acting at random.

The special effects are a lot better than the guy in a gorilla suit of yesteryear, but aren't up to modern standards.  My recommendation would be to try the pilot movie (I Worship His Shadow) and if you like it enough to want to watch a series that is only about half as good, think about it from there.",1163203200,6,890,4.53125
1687679,4,B0000633QN,"I missed _Lexx_ on cable so I saw all of Season 2 within the space of a few days.  I couldn't stop watching once I started.  I was a huge fan of the original Star Trek (but not of the Next Generation) and Lexx, described by some as ""Star Trek's evil twin,"" does all the things you (or at least I) secretly wanted the Enterprise and its crew to do but they never did--like blow up planets, talk about sex continually, and have no ethics whatsoever.  If you had a crush on Mr. Spock (which I did), you'll cream for Kai, the sexy dead guy with the beehive hairdo, who sings this one song repeatedly that you'll be wailing in the shower by the time the season's over!

I can't say the dark humor was enough to make me laugh outright (except for a few scenes in the final battles with Mantrid in the last episode), but I did grimace with appreciation many a time throughout the series, and I found all of it extremely creative and original, and compelling enough to addict both me and my best friend through this season and the following two.",1148601600,8,1037,4.275510204081633

7958486,5,B0000633QN,"Lexx is a weird TV show. And I loved it. The only show that even came close to the weirdness on display in Lexx was Farscape, also a four season sci-fi show. There is nudity in Lexx, but not in Farscape. The first actress playing the Zev character, Eva Habermann shows her breasts. The second actress playing the Zev character, Xenia Seeberg, from season two to four, doesnt. Other women are shown nude, but not Seeberg. Her character teases the Stanley Tweedle character for three seasons, but never gives the poor guy any relief. Bad Zev.

The best character is Kai, played by Michael McManus. Jeffrey Hirschfield and Tom Gallant also do outstanding work voicing the fourth and fifth characters, 790 and Lexx, respectively, and many other fine actors and actresses appear, including Rutger Hauer playing an absolute evil dweeb character.

Most sci-fi shows don't contain any nudity. Exceptions are, the pilot of Stargate SG1, Odyssey 5, some episodes of the second Outer Limits series from the nineties, Westworld, etc. Theres plenty of good stuff out there if you want to avoid nudity, but youll be missing out on some great sci-fi.

When Im not watching sci-fi and fantasy shows Im reading sci-fi and fantasy. Authors I like include Douglas Adams, Taylor Anderson, Isaac Asimov, Paolo Bacigalupi, Jack Campbell, Orson Scott Card, Arthur C. Clarke, Earnest Cline, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Joe Haldeman, Robert A. Heinlein, Frank Herbert, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Larry Niven, Andre Norton, Patrick Rothfuss, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, John Steakley, and Andy Weir.",1491091200,,1581,5.143968871595331

Both the regular cast and the guest cast do an amazing job of making the crazy premise work. Also features some great non-traditional music and some quirky special effects.,1435536000,,305,4.666666666666667
