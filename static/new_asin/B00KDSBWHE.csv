6422214,2,B00KDSBWHE,"This review is not about contents of The Layover. Before I ordered the DVDs, I already watched all the episodes on TV and enjoyed them. There are two disks. My disk one simply won't play. Disk two takes longer to load then normal. The product did not come with an invoice so there is no instructions on return policy to be found. There is no labels on the disks or on the DVD case. So there is no way to know what layover destinations are included in season 2 and on which disk. These DVDs are made on demand when someone orders them. I understand that it's an efficient way to sell products. However, given that one of my disks is defective, and there is no labels of episodes, and no invoice came with the order, I feel this transaction was done without customers' interest in mind. I was excited to know season two of the show is on DVDs, but was very disappointed with the poor quality of the DVDs.",1403568000,3,902,4.280701754385965

I just asked for a Replacement to be sent to me; so let's see how this one Plays once I receive it.",1532908800,,214,3.9767441860465116

8657930,5,B00KDSBWHE,"Here is the list of episodes for The Layover - Season 2:

Disc One - Sao Paulo, Paris, Dublin, Atlanta and Taipei

Disc Two - Seattle, Chicago, Toronto, Philadelphia and New Orleans

The locations seem to be less exotic than Season 1 as many are U.S. cities. But the content is excellent.

Here are some thoughts on some of the episodes:

Sao Paulo - according to the locals you need a friend to show you this city. Your first stop should be at the public market to get
a special sandwich that they are famous for.

Paris - according to Tony you should skip The Louvre and The Eiffel Tower. Instead get an ice cream cone, walk around, get some
bread, meat and stinky cheese and go to the public park with the locals. This is a better way to see Paris.

Seattle - Tony tours the best bars and restaurants in Seattle. He gets some coffee and donuts. They go to the Public Market.

Chicago - Tony goes to some of Chicago's most famous bars. Is deep dish pizza only for tourists? Tony has some Chicago hot dogs and
an Italian beef sandwich. They discuss the difference between White Sox fans and Cubs fans.",1431734400,8,1102,4.341463414634147
8657931,4,B00KDSBWHE,If Anthony Bourdain wasn't so annoying and vulgar I'd give the show 5 stars!  Would you believe there's a host more annoying than him?  The Street Food host!  Unbelievable!,1430611200,,172,4.862068965517241
8657932,4,B00KDSBWHE,"Bourdain continues to be great in pretty much everything he puts out, I bought this for the Taiwan episode as I have a soft spot for the country, the rest of the package is generally Americas based. Good show.",1426982400,,209,4.384615384615385
