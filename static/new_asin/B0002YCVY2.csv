2144340,5,B0002YCVY2,"I caught this show when Cartoon Network aired it as part of Adult Swim. At first, I thought the animation left something to be desired, but I soon stopped caring about how the show looked because the real meat of the series is the dialogue. Listening to a cartoon has never been so much fun. The near improvised exhanges among all the characters are very funny and many of the situations were highly amusing. Coach McGuirk always managed to get a laugh out of me and the music written and performed by Brendon Small is nothing short of awesome. I cannot wait for the DVD as I was saddened by the show's cancellation.",1095206400,9,616,4.460176991150442
2144341,5,B0002YCVY2,"Home Movies is perhaps one of the greatest series to ever be aired on television.  I have been an avid fan of the show since my disovery of the show two years ago.  Sadly, the showing of episodes has slowly decreased over the years, but that will soon change (at least on my television!) with the release of the first season!  I can't wait!!!!",1094947200,7,343,4.328125
2144342,5,B0002YCVY2,"Home Movies is a gem that has been kicked down the block so many times it simply gains more character and value with each booting.

Originally aired on UPN it lasted all of six episodes.  Way to go, UPN.

This is one of the few animated shows that somehow missed mass appeal for Comedy Central's animation block years ago.

Bob & Margaret and several other feeble shows kept Dr. Katz at bay and Home Movies didn't make the cut (thank you Comedy Central Network Programmers for putting such garbage on the air so I can get back to my life and turn off the TV...on occasion).

Luckily, HM found a home on the Cartoon Network next to Futurama reruns.  The episodes were continued in Flash rather than the Dr. Katz trademark Squigglevision.

For some reason, Home Movies was banished to once a week Sunday viewings on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim.  Possibly due to the DVD release.  Why let them see it for free if they can pay?

From 'Get Away from My Mom' (episode 101) to 'Focus Grill' (episode 413) Home Movies is a 22 minute therapy session without having to pay for the whole hour.

Who didn't love that analogy?

The extras on the DVD are worth the retail cost even without the episodes.",1094342400,10,1190,4.4837209302325585
2144343,5,B0002YCVY2,"Along with the release of Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Sealab 2021 this show is another masterpiece of Adult Swim.  This show was on another station prior to Adult swim (AS), but AS is when this show finally took over and became known.  Being 22 years old I laugh at the witty remarks of Brendon Small (the main character), the lazyiness of Coach McGuirk and the stupidity of Jason just to mention a few of the whole plethora of characters in this show.  For adults who like comedy then this is for you.",1094083200,6,501,4.365591397849462
2144344,5,B0002YCVY2,"This show is so good! I can not emphasize enough how hilarious the characters and dialogue is! It just feels so natural and ad-libbed which a lot of it probably is from my understanding. But above all it is too funny. Brendon Small is perfect as our hapless director-wannabe protagonist 'Brendon Small'. H Jon Benjamin is absolutely fantastic as the the always awkward 'Jason' and the surly and loud mouthed 'Coach McGuirk'. And the rest of the cast is bang on! Hopefully this release will lead to a quick release of the following seasons. This first season is really, really good but the following seasons got even better. With more polished art and animation and of course the introduction of 'Walter and Perry' the scariest (and funniest) childhood duo since those two twin girls in The Shining. I cannot recommend this DVD set enough. Definitely worth picking up.

2144433,4,B0002YCVY2,"I like this show a lot, although it took me a few episodes to appreciate it. The group who produced and put it together didn't make much, if any, money, but they had a lot of fun making it. The characters grow on you after a few episodes and the wiggly effect ceases to be so noticeable. The budget was very small, so they did their best and produced a fun show.

Coach McGerk has since gone on to transform into Bob of ""Bob's Burgers,"" so he isn't portraying an overblown, pathetic, irritating character anymore, something he was good at in this series.

Brendon Small, who plays the main character of the same name in this series, has since gone on to make ""Metalacalypse,"" which I don't care for at all.

Lots of extras on this and following seasons of ""Home Movies"".  I enjoyed seeing what Brendan looks like in one of the extra featurettes on disc 1 of season on; we get to see him as himself and in an actual home movie (basically a fake ad for TV) he made purportedly demonstrating (in heavy metal drag) how to play heavy metal guitar. There are other featurettes, like an interesting  interview with Loren, the producer who created ""Dr. Katz"" and ""Home Movies,"" and more. Loren provides all you need to know about the history of this series, how the cast came together, and about the laborious making of the show.

It's a classic show, all 4 seasons. It's not wildly hilarious, but the concept and execution are endearing. The cast, even the normally-intolerable (for me) Emo Phillips as a smart-mouthed bully, did a good job for this show. It grows on you!

1.""Get Away From My Mom"" 7/10 -this is the first of the first so i understand if it's not up to it's standards yet but.. i found the whole thing just a little boring. but it was the first so i'll give it a chance.

2.""I don't do well in parent/teacher conferences"" 10/10 - way better. the movie they made in this movie was to funny for me. also brendan's mom starts cursing for no reason. XD

3. ""The Art Of The Sucker Punch"" 10/10- Funny on the wall. i mean come on. IT'S FREAKING FUNNY PEOPLE.

4.""Brendan Get's rabies"" - 10/10 - favorite epsiode of the whole set. nuff said.

5."" Yoko"" - 6/10 - even more boring than the first. the best part was the begginging with couch mcqurik saying ""WHO PEED IN MY CANTEEN?"" but as soon as it switches back to the house it goes downhill from there. (MY OPIOION.)

That was the first disc. now let's move to the second.

6. ""Director's Cut"" - 9/10 - LOL. NOTHING TO SAY.

7. ""It was supposed to be funny"" 10/10 -yes. it was suppsoed to be funny. CUZ IT WAS.

8. ""Method of acting"" 7/10 - again, another one of those hard ones to sit through.

9. ""Life through a fisheye lines"" 10/10- IT'S TOO MUCH LAUGHTER.

2144505,5,B0002YCVY2,"As Coach McGuirk would say, and get ready to laugh your skin off drunk or sober. This is one of the best shows to ever hit TV, and I am known for being a guy to call TV being the destroyer of the new generation. Brandon Small is a creative but sensitive, and sometimes insecure young dude who is trying to work craft his art that is movies! And of course he has a band of friends to help him out and build sets like castles out of cardboard and using washer machines for buildings. This is a great show in a lot of respects and it had a very unique sense of humor to it. The characters you could relate to on a lot of different levels yet they were still silly and funny. Most of TV these days, particularly on adult swim are shows that lack all the dimensions that this show had. A lot of new Adult Swim shows just play on extreme left field comedy, totally lack character depth, storyline, plot, and even good or new animation. Home Movies was a really rare series because it was so funny while being dreadfully honest and wild at the same time. Its just sad to see a good program like Adult Swim go under too, I think when Cowboy Bebop went out of the picture it lost some charm too. There are still some funny shows such as Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Venture Brothers can be funny sometimes, The Boondocks is another really good one particularly season 3, and some of season 2. Though some new additions like King Of The Hill, American Dad are kinda stale and boring, and the horrible Tim and Eric show and Delocated are just down right stupid. However, when you watch Home Movies you are reminded that creative minds can still make great humor and entertainment.",1292371200,,1664,4.302547770700637

""Brendan Gets Rabies"", ""Law and Borders"", ""Art of the Sucker Punch"", and  ""Through a Fish Eye Lens"" are some of my immediate favorites, but after watching any episode a number of times all of them could become my favorites.

 Another great aspect of home movies are the cool musical numbers placed in some of the eps performed by the dim-witted Duane and his band Scab. For instance in ""Law and Borders"", Brendon is sentenced to write an essay explaining to the judge how he was sorry for causing the accident he was involved in. Instead the kids decide to make a hilarious, dramatized spoof of the accident and then the kids rock out at the end: ""Don't hit children don't run them over, let them live their lives let them get older! x2 Brendon's cool, he didn't break the rules, he was just riding his bike, they tried to take his life!""

Most of the humor is subtle and circumstancial, rather than an ""in-your-face-laugh-at-me-please-NOW"" style.  Not only is the script amazingly written; the comedic timing of the voice actors is superb.  The animation in this first season, due to the show's initially low budget, leaves quite a bit to be desired; but even still, it adds a certain stylistic charm and an often comic effect.

Some of my favorite episodes from Home Movies are from this DVD set (such as ""I Don't Do Well..,"" ""Brendon Gets Rabies,"" ""Stay Away from My Mom,"" and ""Director's Cut"").  Despite the annoying squiggle-vision animation and the occasional (though rare) lapse in genious, this season is probably just as good as any of the other three, and it definitely runs circles around any lesser intelligent comic animations (such as Sealab, ATHF, and Family Guy... as great as these three series can be at times).",1162598400,3,986,4.951515151515151

So, apparently there is a god.

The first season, and the only season, used squiggle vision, which may or may not have been why some folks were turned off by the show, or maybe they just didn't get it, either way, they missed out big time.

Classic episodes in this season are:

(Director's Cut)-Duane wants to do a musical on german writer Franz Kafka [maybe the reason why this episode is one of my favorites,] and Brendon just can't stand it.  He comes to an unspoken agreement with Duane and isolates himself from Melissa & Jason in the process.  But, of course, all is mended, and hilarity enfolds.

(It Was Supposed to be Funny)-Eric, Melissa's dad, asks Brendon to make a video for his father, Melissa's grandfather.  Brendon decides to take the whole project in a new director, dressing him up in make-up and a dress.  She's not impressed, and neither is Erik, or at least so he pretends.  He thinks it's hilarious, but Melissa won't budge, so Brendon redoes the project and wins back her friendship.

(The Art of the Sucker Punch)-Jason gets thrown into the mud by neighborhood bully, and recurring character, Shannon.  Brendon decides to avenge his friend, who brings it all upon himself 'cus he's ""all like duuurrhhhr"".  Brendon soon realizes that you can't choreograph a real life fight and Shannon lets go of his ego for a while in order to help Brendon feel better about himself.",1151625600,3,1483,4.67953667953668

2144547,5,B0002YCVY2,"Adult Swim: you love it or hate it. Or rather, you love or hate the various offerings in this Cartoon Network ""adult"" time block. Someone wrote that this show is mostly ""kid safe."" That's a real concern for parents. When Adult Swim first began airing, it began with a rather strong dislaimer, summed up with ""all kids out of the pool."" However, to CN's credit, the shows were far more innocent than what you'd find on Fox, Comedy Central or the networks (and far more witty). That went downhill when Family Guy became the standard instead of Space Ghost Coast to Coast and Matt H. started writing the unfunny blurbs in between shows (which had been rather innocent and very funny before).

I originally hated Home Movies for reasons other reviewers have amply detailed. But a friend said, ""Give it a chance."" I did, and it became my favorite cartoon in the Adult Swim block. Why? It's like radio. You could turn off the picture and the deadpan humor, perfectly voiced, would still come across. But it's even better with Brendan's gestures (and non-gestures). Homer Simpson introduced the long, blank stare and slack jawed drool ""dooooughnuuuuuuts."" Ren and Stimpy introduced long periods of time with the characters doing nothing, both of which echo ""real life"" far more than the constant ""action"" of earlier cartoons. The best part of this show is when the characters make movies (as the title suggests) dressing up, playing parts and arguing over the scripts, which echoes the longtime Hollywood convention of making movies about making movies or stage shows. This metafictional multilevelled approach adds richness and allows the whole show to relax. Once more, the advances have come in the area of animation and not live action TV, most of which settles for recycled jokes and ever more ""extreme"" read: ""adult"" humor.

Cartoon Network has proven you don't have to be dirty to be funny (anyone can write a dirty joke; try writing a clean one), and that kids' TV doesn't have to be boring and bland. It's a given that the best writers today are all on the side of animation (people who hate animation don't know what they're missing). Look how bad Disney's live action movies are compared to their witty cartoon shows, and the same goes for studios across the board, who daily demonstrate how much more creativity is possible within limits and under restraint, as comics and animators had to work under in previous decades.

Whether this show is kid-friendly depends on the standards you apply (it's certainly not as bad as soap operas, news or Family Guy). However, the Third Season opens with an ad for a Shout! Factory video game which I find needlessly violent (the company finds it humorous). I hit the menu button to avoid the ads, and get right to Home Movies.",1138752000,2,2770,4.815126050420168
2144548,5,B0002YCVY2,"I add this, as a teacher of 12-year-old kids.  What the other reviewers haven't said is, unlike most of the shows on Cartoon Network's ""Adult Swim,"" Home Movies is usually free of obscenity and while it often features mature subject matter, it is always handled cleverly and usually via high-minded innuendo.  The only exceptions I can think of-and this happened during a showing I gave to some friends who had kids present, much to my embarrassment-was a scene in which Coach McGuirk describes telling his landlady to ""kiss my a**,"" and in another scene asks a divorced father ""how long they were doing it"" behind his back.  But these were highly exceptional occurrences.  Most episodes bypass the need for such references completely.  Still, best to preview before letting your young kids see it.

I rate Home Movies with the greatest half-hour sitcoms of all time, like Seinfeld, Fawlty Towers, and Frasier.  It is character-driven, highly literate humor, which bears up to repeated screenings and gets funnier each time you watch it.",1130889600,2,1037,5.029239766081871
2144549,5,B0002YCVY2,"This show has such smart, deadpan humor, I absolutely love it!  I especially like the drunken, angry stuff that Coach McGuirk says, he's my favorite TV show character ever.  Jason is so nasty, but he is really funny... ""These taste like old people's mouth!""  One of the funniest cartoon quotes ever!  And season 1 has the most improv, and the improv is what made the show unique.  I like it when Paula starts cussing like crazy at the parent teacher conferences, that might be my favorite Home Movies moments.

If you have a sense of humor any bigger than Sean Penn, you have to have this DVD set because it has a kind of humor for everybody...  The deadpan humor of the conversations, the gross humor of Jason, the Family Guy-like humor of Coach McGuirk, it's so well rounded!  *GET THIS TODAY!*",1127001600,5,796,4.556338028169014
2144550,5,B0002YCVY2,"For several seasons, Home Series shone like a rare gem at the start of the Sunday-night Adult Swim lineup on Cartoon Network.  The star of the series, sometimes neurotic 8-year old Brendon Small, spends most of his time writing and directing movies in his basement with his two best friends, Jason and Melissa.  These young characters provide each episode with a combination of innocence and comedy, offering a subtle humor rarely found in an animated sitcom (although King of the Hill has had some success in this area as well).  However, it is the ability of Home Movies to be both earnest and bizarre at the same time that made it such a perfect fit with such other off-the-wall Adult Swim features as Sealab 2120 and Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

Alas, Comedy Central has since made the unwise decision to relegate Home Movies to an obscure early A.M. slot, a time much too late for those of us actually able to appreciate the show's intelligent, nuanced humor.  Luckily, though, we have the DVD releases to sustain us, starting here with Season One.  Although some people might not appreciate the Squigglevision style used for the first season (similar to another former Comedy Central hit, Dr. Katz), the brilliance of the show was manifest from the very start.  The very first episode highlights two of the series' most memorable characters:  Brendon's Mom, Paula, quite neurotic in her own right, and his soccer coach, Coach John McGuirk, a man who readily embraces his shortcomings (including his excessive alcohol use).  And in addition to the characters, there are the movies--always the movies!  In just one episode (Director's Cut), we see Brendon's visionary ""Louie, Louie,"" about a fictional meeting between Louis Pasteur and Louis Braille (because they're both French, of course!) as well as a rock opera based on the life of Franz Kafka and written by Duane, the teenager who supplies the music for Brendon's films.

This 3-DVD set also contains a variety of extra features.  Several of the episodes offer a bonus commentary option (which basically means the actors talking through the entire episode rather than commenting on it per se).  There are also interviews with the creators (who, as you might expect, are rather bizarre themselves) as well as animation galleries plus other short animated features they've developed.  Finally, some of the episodes feature animatics, a sort of episode-in-progress where you see rough sketched loosely paired with dialogue but nowhere near final form.  Overall, this is a wonderful animated series, and I highly recommend that both old and new fans start their Home Movies DVD collection with this first season.",1126483200,8,2665,5.052511415525114
2144551,5,B0002YCVY2,"""Home Movies"" is my favorite of all Adult Swim shows. It is simultaneously funny, complicated, intellectual, and simple. Frequently there are lots of subtle subtexts that require more than one viewing of an episode to fully appreciate. This, the first season, was done in ""Squigglevision"" like ""Dr. Katz."" I think it neither particularly adds nor detracts from the episodes, though my personal preference would be to ditch it (as they did in season two and subsequent.)

There are many classic episodes here, most of which are either centered on a perceived crisis among the kids or on some strange interaction between Brendon and Coach McGuirk. Of the episodes in this set I love ""Yoko,"" ""I Don't Do Well In Parent-Teacher Conferences,"" and ""Brendon Gets Rabies"" most. The ""Rabies"" episode is one of my favorite episodes of all time, in fact.

The set comes with a lot of extras and commentaries, all of which are highly recommended. It is really a shame that Cartoon Network elected to cancel this show: it is intelligent, funny, and sly, which is perhaps what ultimately sealed the fate of the show on Adult Swim.

If you haven't seen it, I suggest you rent it before you consider buying it.  But if you're familiar with the show already then I whole-heartedly recommend you buy it.

This 3 disk set has some nice bonuses, including two short films.  ""Baby Pranks"" made me laugh myself silly.  Plus there are three different interviews with the creators / cast that are both full of interesting trivia and oddball humor.

My favorite bonus though is the commentary tracks for several of the episodes.  These have got to be the least informative, most bizarrely amusing commentaries every recorded.

Support this series.  Family Guy was given a second chance because of DVD sales.  I wish Home Movies would be given one.  It's a remarkable series that, as one person here has already said, is truly adult.  The situations that adults go through, but put in children characters simply increases the satire of human life.

All of the characters are unique.  You won't find one brand of humor here.  Each character has a specific voice and the humor derives from this.  This is by far one of the best series that I've seen on Adult Swim.  And just know that in my opinion, the series gets better in the next season.

some of the funniest moments come from coach macguirk yelling at melissa or the exchanges betwee him and brendan (and hell even coach macguirk and mr. lynch).  next to Jason he is the funniest character.

Like most others I caught this first on Adult Swim, wandering around the television wasteland one night I watched Space Ghost hosting a diverting talk show.  Interspersed with that was the first season of Home Movies.  I was immediately taken in by the sharp, snarky dialogue as well as the crudity of the animation with its jangled lines and shimmering presentation.  As with South Park, it's easy to get past that as you begin to listen and follow the story arcs.  Brendon Small makes his home movies as a precocious 8 year old, employing his friends Melissa, and Jason.  My favorite character of course is soccer-non-coach John McGurk who spouts forth knuckle dragging philosophy and pontificates with Brendan as his charges run about the field without any concept of or game plan.  Seeing McGurk with the kids is a riot, but it's when he interacts with adults that things go up a notch and his shortcomings become painfully aware; like attempting to use a fax machine, or coffee maker, trying to come to grips with the concept of a mortgage, mooning his landlady and moving out of his apt. before he has secured another, and his anger management techniques.  Jason too to a lesser extent is a supporting cast gem, always picking, flicking, or having some thing running from his nose he tirelessly and thanklessly throws himself into Brendon's productions.  The rest of the characters in the world serve excellently to buoy the stories, and they do a wonderful job, particularly Brendon's mom who is supposed to hold it all together and does so by the edge of her fingernails.

2144569,4,B0002YCVY2,"First of all...I love ""Home Movies"". I won't delve into the premise of the show because I know you can find that all out by reading other reviews. But ""Home Movies"" is probably the best and most underrated show to come along since ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". I've been waiting for these DVD's to come out for so long and am happy they finally did (Hope the rest of seasons get released because the show got better each season). Fans of ""Dr. Katz"" will appreciate ""Home Movies"", as many of the same people worked on both shows. H. Jon Benjamin is perfect as Coach McGuirk (the funniest character on the show). Jon Katz voices Erik Robbins, Melissa's dad.  Bottom line...it's a great show for adults. It's not a laugh out loud kind of show, rather the humor is derived from the interaction of the characters and the sarcasm that ensues. I especially love the Brendon-McGuirk relationship.  McGuirk isn't so much a father figure to him, but more of a big brother who seems to treat him more as a peer than an 8 year old kid. The first season is a little rough, but I reccommend you pick it up and give it a try...you'll like it. I gave it 4 stars because there wasn't enough extra features. The commentary seems like it's just Loren (one of the creators), Brendon, and H. Jon having a conversation at a bar dubbed over the episode...and the interviews weren't too informative, but it was fun to hear the guys talk about the process of the show. And by the way, McGuirk really sounds exactly like how H. Jon talks. He doesn't have to do anything with his voice for that one. Bottom Line...get this set, give it a chance, and enjoy one of the best animated shows to come out in a LONG time.",1104710400,2,1689,4.427652733118971
2144570,5,B0002YCVY2,"This show is great. It's really funny and I'd especially recommend it to those who ""don't get"" the whacked out humor that's prevalent throughout the rest of the Adult Swim lineup. It's a crying shame this show was cancelled after only 4 seasons but definitely pick this DVD up as well as the other 3 seasons when they come out.

2144571,5,B0002YCVY2,"Home Movies is a legitimate works of episodic art.  It creates a touching personal account of growing up destined to be in the arts, something that my circle of friends and I can relate to.  If fact most of the episodes I feel like were written about me personally, so I have an amazing connection with the Brendon Small character. Its elements of success are more visible in their ability with characters, their narrative skills and over all sophistication. The characters are well developed; there is a scene of dimensionality provided through the dialogue that allows the animation to be more child-like and playful.  While the animation is simplistic, it does the job of capturing emotion and the expression of a character. The trio of characters' short films works as a hilarious platform for satirizing the film industry.

Its style of humor is much more sophisticated than the other Adult Swim cartoons. There is many inside jokes that only people who have studied in the arts can understand, such as Stanislavski, The Actor Prepares, Franz Kafka, and so forth. I believe that it helps off-set the great random humor that is repeated in Sea Lab, and really over worked in Aqua Teen, and now with Super Milk Chan it is just too much arbitrary creation for one evening.  Over all Home Movies is capable of telling an interesting story while sustaining an entertainment value. And the voice artists are incredible. It is especially nice hearing Mitch Hedberg, and Jonathan Catz doing supporting characters. This is something that is enjoyable and palatable enough to watch more than once unlike many other non-child oriented animation.

Well so last year i was flipping through the channels and the same animation was there but it was a completely different show... this show ran off of intelligent adult humor. When i found out they were selling the first season i bought i as soon as i found it. It is a great buy and highly entertaining. Great commentary from the creators.... Now i just want all the seasons but sadly season one is the only one available at this time. If you like funny sarcastic humor buy this you will like it haha,1102809600,2,694,4.305343511450381

Also the quality of each episode is high and consistent throughout the season.  These are great if want to watch tv with some friends and have a good time.  They are too good to keep to yourself.

The only negative would be the commentary.  There is a lot of it available, but I have not listened to much of it. I didn't find it interesting or really that funny.

Hell I thought the same thing as Aqua Teen, and they ended up being moderately funny, so I guess there is hope. Im not going to run out and buy this though.

2144588,5,B0002YCVY2,"Huge fan of Home Movies, ever since I accidentally came across it when it started airing on Cartoon Network's adult swim animation block. Love Jon Benjamin who voices my favorite character of all time, Ben Katz from the best series ever- Dr. Katz Professional Therapist...he's awesome in Home Movies as well doing the voice of Jason and Coach McGuirk...not to mention Walter or is it Perry (Bredon Small and Benjamin do the voices for these two classic characters.)  Small does a great job as well as the loveable mini-filmmaker, Brendom.

Not a big fan of Paula Poundstone for the voice of Paula, Brendon's mom...Janine Ditullo is so much better as Paula in my mind.  She was a great pickup after Poundstone left the show.

The animation, first season it's sqigglevision, is nice and even better with the flash in seasons 2-4.  The dvd video is really good, as far as I can tell, and the same goes for the audio- which is 2 channel dolby stereo, I believe (not in the room with the dvd player, so I can't check.)

The dvd set is nice overall, and the commentary tracks are entertining (tho, I kept hoping they would be a bit more serious about the making of the show and various aspects of production- Small was giving good info, but H. Jon Benjamin seems to be the type of person who could never be serious no matter what.  Not a huge deal, but it would have been nice for a bit more serious discussion.  The audio on the commentary tracks seemed to be good quality, BUT- the program volume should have been much lower, because at some points it's actually kind of hard to hear them and not have the actual program episode audio override their voices.

The extras outside of the commentaries aren't the best- both home movies from Benjamin and Small are downright lame.  The baby prank thing was wholly unfunny in my view, and the master class guitar thing wasn't much better.

The interviews were nice to see as a bonus, but they were a tad bit boring...Bouchard gave good insight into the show and how it started and all, but again, Benjamin seemed to be trying way too hard to be funny all the time, and his interview was lackluster to say the least.  The editing of the interviews was odd as well, with a bunch of jump cuts, tho it didn't take much away from them in the end.

I liked the added animatics (tho in season 1, you couldn't hardly call them animatics at all- actually just storyboards), and the animators do a commentary while watching the animatics set to the episode's audio.  They have some interesting info. to add to all of this.

The set is nice, the 3 dvd cases along with the outside box holding them all is creative, very colorful, and really well done...and the show itself along with the bonus stuff is cool.  Tho, as I mentioned, there was a bit of a downside to some of it.  They mentioned on the last episode commentary that there would be a season 2 set coming out, and that was a sure thing...hopefully all 4 seasons will come out on DVD.",1100908800,6,2972,4.474074074074074

2144590,4,B0002YCVY2,"My fandom of the Adult Swim block on the Cartoon Network began with the underrated but ingenious ""Home Movies"" and ended with its departure. It was originally aired on UPN and was cancelled after this first season. The truth is that Home Movies belonged to a special niche and the people in charge of the Adult Swim made the brilliant decision to pick Home Movies up and give the show the chance it deserved... and they haven't made a decision that good since.

Home Movies was one of the few shows on the Adult Swim one can honestly say was smart enough to actually be for adults. The situations, the characters and their backgrounds, and the socially-advanced way these 8 year olds communicate with each other, and the child-like way they approached life is what makes Home Movies the gem it is.

The loose dialogue and seemingly unrehearsed improv the characters perform gives the show a unique feel of maturity, especially in this first season. One could say that in the first season the characters and their conversations are almost too adult (in an intellectual sense). In later seasons the dialogue seems less improvised; more structured and scripted, but still holds its comic edge.

What costs Home Movie Season 1 a star in my review is this little thing known as ""Squigglevision"". Those of us familiar with shows like Dr. Katz or ""Ed, Edd and Eddy"" will know what squigglevision is. It is a very annoying method of animation where all the lines ""squiggle"" to give the art a more hand-drawn look as if each frame was done by hand and then animated. It bothers me, but it doesn't take away from the shows humor which is what makes Home Movies what it is and is not used beyond season 1.

Since the cancellation of Home Movies the Adult Swim block has fallen into a quagmire of dumb shows that use what I like to call ""random comedy"". In other words shows that tell no story, but simply have left-field events take place with no core or anything for me to relate to. Their new shows--- such as ""Squidbillies"" and ""Tom Goes to the Mayor""--- demonstrates how shows like Home Movies made Adult Swim Comedy the perfect Sunday night treat that it once was (for me), and now how badly Adult Swim's creative people need rehab (in my opinion).

Thanks to Soup 2 Nuts, Brendon Small and Loren Bouchard for giving me such a warm and intelligent comedy program. I wish it had another 5 seasons, but the Home Movies DVDs will become a beloved addition to my DVD library. I hope this review helped a little, and many thanks for taking the time to read my worthless opinion.

Adult Swim still has the Venture Brothers, Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Harvey Birdman Attorney at Law- still some of the best comedy on TV, but it hasn't gotten better than ""Home Movies"" for me, and after seeing the random direction Adult Swim seems to be taking their comedy block, I strongly doubt it ever will.",1100563200,66,2881,4.584466019417476
2144591,5,B0002YCVY2,"While Adult Swim has some of the best shows on TV today, their DVDs have been rather lacking in the extras. The description on this one is kind of odd - ""Animated menus""? Is that really a ""Special Feature""?

The show is the best ever - Cleaner and funnier than South Park, more relatable than Aqua Teen and more adult than The Simpsons. Every episode has something funnier than the last, and the lines are killer:

Brendan: ""Were you blind when you peed all over the hallway?""

Coach McGirk: ""No.""

Brendan: ""Were you drunk?""

Coach McGirk: ""Yes. Can I pinpoint a time when I wasn't blind and drunk? No.""

(Temporary Blindness, #51)

The first season is done in Squiggle Vision, which gives it a really unique look.

Coach McGirk doesn't figure into the plot quite as much as later episodes, which is kind of disappointing (check out episodes 15, 38, 41, 50 and 51 for great great great McGirk moments). Paula's voice is done by a different woman after the sixth episode. Jason's best episode of the season is ""School Nurse"" (#10) when he attacks McGirk.

This is a great cartoon because it also deals with Brendan's dysfunctional family - in ""Brendan Gets Rabies"", Paula and Brendan bond while looking for Alexandddrrre, the cat Brendan lost. In the second season, look forward to meeting Brendan's dad, and his dad's girlfriend Linda, a twenty-year old beauty brat.",1099526400,3,1367,4.758474576271187

2144606,5,B0002YCVY2,"Back in 1999, on struggling over-the-air network UPN, a small series from Tom Snyder Productions premiered Tuesdays at 8:30 after Dilbert: The Animated Series as UPN tried to capture some of the ""animation craze"" that was finding an audience in shows such as The Simpsons, King of the Hill, and Family Guy. This series, featuring animators and voice talent (also including Paula Poundstone in the ""lead role"" for the series) involved in the cult favorite Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist, played for five episodes on UPN, drawing unremarkable ratings and a subsequent cancellation. If this was the end of the story for Home Movies, it would've been just another failed experiment in the annuls of television lore -- but thanks to Cartoon Network, which picked this show up two years later, we now have a full 13 episodes for season 1 of one of the best animated series you've never heard of.

Anyone who is familiar with Home Movies knows that it was recently ""not renewed"" by Cartoon Network after 52 episodes of the show were produced and aired -- not a preferable way to end the series, but infinitely better than being limited to 5 episodes of the series where the animators and voice talent were struggling to find their niche. The episodes in season 1 are occasionally hit-and-miss; however, you can see hidden gems in the skewering of pop culture (in particular that found in popular movies and music), and the series really finds its center in episodes 6-13, where Cartoon Network gave Soup2Nuts Productions (formerly Tom Snyder Productions) financial backing and a place to showcase their brilliance.

The list of special features is quite enticing for fans of the show as well; I'm especially looking forward to the interviews of Brendon Small and Jon Benjamin, arguably the two most versatile voices on the series. But really, if you're a fan of animated entertainment that isn't just for kids, you can't go wrong with Home Movies.

It's obviously not for everyone (as the lukewarm ratings show) and it does have its weak points (the animation/design of the show is nothing to brag about), but if you ""get"" this show, it's nothing short of excellent.
