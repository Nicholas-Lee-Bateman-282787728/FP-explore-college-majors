7001677,5,B00T6LQGC0,"I was interested in seeing The Mother Grain documentary because of the articles I'd read about western consumption of quinoa being detrimental to the farmers. I'd stopped eating quinoa because I felt felt bad for the farmers and their communities. I was surprised to find that this documentary offers a very different narrative to the one of hardship that seems to dominate. The Mother Grain does and excellent job of explaining the circumstances within which the farmers and their communities live. How they operate and how their sovereignty is in fact protected and how bare statistics don't always tell the whole truth. Whilst this documentary is by no means the final word on quinoa, it's is certainly a welcome contribution to the ongoing conversation. I will be eating my quinoa again.",1432252800,4,791,5.0458015267175576
7001678,5,B00T6LQGC0,"This documentary succeeds where so many mainstream media outlets have failed. While reputable organizations continue to perpetuate the same lies and falsehoods about farmers and Bolivians, The Mother Grain actually went on location to the quinoa growing region of the Andes to discuss many of the surrounding issues regarding the rise of quinoa.

This documentary engages directly with the farmers to gain their perspective detailing everything from their farming practices, cultural and religious beliefs, to their living conditions.

Well researched, beautifully shot and well executed. A must see movie for people who care about knowing where their food comes from. Highly recommended.",1428796800,4,688,5.735294117647059
