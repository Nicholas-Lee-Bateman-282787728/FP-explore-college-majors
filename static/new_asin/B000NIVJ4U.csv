8177999,3,B000NIVJ4U,"It was part of a generation that never ends. Nito is one of the greatest latin musicians. A cornerstone for the Argentinean rock scene. Every song on this concert is part of the history of music in Latin America. His voice better than ever and his amazing ability to set the ambiance for an unique experience is exceptional. For all of those who had experimented a live gig from him, this is a very good resemblance of the moments we have shared with him as an audience. My only complain is that the video quality is very poor and for an artist like him it is not acceptable to make this great musical job with this image quality.",1324166400,,630,4.3474576271186445
