8755131,4,B01D7A1FF8,"Fabrice Luchini plays Michel Racine a criminal judge who is known for being less than lenient. He is separated and has got to that curmudgeonly time of life. This day he starts a new trial of a man accused of infanticide of his own daughter  but then he spots one of the jurors and his heart quickens a beat.

This is a doctor who had treated him some two years ago  being is Ditte Lorensen-Coteret played by the marvellous Sisde Babbett- Knudsen (Borgen and The Duke of Burgundy) and he has been carrying a torch for her ever since. What follows are two trials  the one of the defendant and the other for himself but not as judge.

Now this is well made, acted, directed and filmed and it is a gripping story in places but it also takes its foot off the gas a few times too which means you can start mind meandering if you are not careful. That said it still kept me interested until the end so one I can recommend, but only once really so a rental option would be better advised.",1484956800,,981,4.224598930481283
8755132,5,B01D7A1FF8,"Subtle, very well acted, courtroom melodrama. Filmed in the town of Saint Omer, near Calais.
It deals mostly with the importance of applying the law correctly over and above human squabbles.
Very well suited to the land of Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite.
The extraordinarily beautiful leading actress Sidse Knutsen should be appearing more often in French films.",1474416000,,360,5.446428571428571
