1750003,3,B00006FMBT,"I viewed this film several years ago, when the USA network still aired their ""Saturday Nightmares"" horror showcase. The Hills Have Eyes still lingers in my mind as one of Wes Cravens finest directoral moments. Filmed in the same cinematic vein as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, this gritty slasher flick centers around a clan of monsterous cannibals and their desert exploits. From start to finish their is a dreadful feeling of tension and suspense. I gave this film three stars, which is a mid-way rating. I reserve the higher rankings only for films such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Zombie. Still, its is definitely worth checking out...and a much better use of time than wearing yourself out with all those Nightmare On Elm Street sequels!",1032220800,,749,4.9523809523809526
1750041,3,B00006FMBT,"I bought it to see what happened to the family after. You just barely get a taste of what happened to Ruby and the son. The movie doesnt even really add alot of scares and nail biting moments. I was hoping for the old school scares like we got for the original Texas Chainsaws. Even now, those were the better of most this current day and age. As many classmates and I discuss, you can still imagine or see a family like those from the Texas Chainsaw or the Sawyers if you will. Maybe save your cash and find those original one and be shocked at how scary many of our top movie stars are today.",1260057600,,594,4.129310344827586
1750042,4,B00006FMBT,"OK, First of all i was extremely dissappointed with the first one. I think the story line and lack of ideal direction in the movie made me question wes craven. This one on the other hand was much better storied and acted. Though i caution to viewers this is a really cheesy (B) movie and if you ,like me find these movies entertaining then you might like it otherwise your better off renting it for a buck at blockbuster first!",1191196800,,427,4.35
1750043,4,B00006FMBT,i liked this one allmost az much az pt. 1 (original film not tha remake). im not really feelin these new remakes tho. if u liked tha original hills have eyes then this iz great 4 tha collection,1179792000,,193,4.105263157894737
1750044,5,B00006FMBT,They have a remake out now but this origional sequal to hills is great.  Good gore and blood too.,1179532800,,97,4.105263157894737
1750045,2,B00006FMBT,"Hills II, as has been said before, was an attempt to repeat the success not only of the first flick, but also of the up-and-coming Jason and Halloween franchises -- released just as the Freddie franchise was starting.  Actually, the film plays well if watched right after the first, but it cannot stand on its own.

It contains some of the now standard cliches of the 80s slasher flicks: the guys are immature, the women are intuitive, but discounted, and the post-adolescent sex/skinny dipping/shower scenes are de rigeur.  Also, the most vulnerable character lives (this time, a pretty, but blind, young woman).  Plenty of 80s hair and fashion, but lacking the suspensefulness of the first.  In the original, we WANT some of the victims to be killed because they're so stupid and obnoxious.  In Hills II, they're just immature.",1178841600,,829,4.928057553956834
1750046,3,B00006FMBT,"After the events of the original movie, a few of the survivors along with bikers take a bus-trip to a bike race near the desert where the incident with the hillbillies occured, as they take a shortcut by accident the evil cannibalistic hillbilly family sets a trap for them.

An OK sequel to a Wes Craven 70's cult horror classic which this is also directed by him, some of it's mostly flashbacks to the original movie at parts just like ""Silent Night Deadly Night 2"". Nice to see everyone's favorite cult deformed actor Michael Berryman back as Pluto the not-so-lovable mutant cannibal, it's a fair sequel but can't be as good as the original or the recent remake.

The DVD has decent picture with miminal grain at times and decent sound with only one extra which is a trailer to the movie.",1163462400,,791,4.563380281690141
1750047,2,B00006FMBT,"The movie was only 90 minutes, but at least 20 of those were flash backs from the first one. The hillbilly cannibals are all of a sudden hillbilly cannibals on motorbikes. And NO ONE dies until the last 20 minutes. Need I say more?",1161907200,2,231,4.2727272727272725
1750048,3,B00006FMBT,"the movie wouldnt have been as bad if it wasint filmed like friday the 13th because in my opinion them movies suck. it was like there was too much walking around and investigating then there was chasing , theres only one real chase scene when pluto or w/e steals the dirt bike, which is a cool scene but after that it was just them walking around being followed by random kills. and the ending was just liek teh 1st one except they get some dumbass to go into a bus for what ever reason and it blows up and hre comes runing out and falls down a well. Its a bad movie friday the 13th is better and i hate them movies.",1146528000,,616,4.057377049180328
1750049,3,B00006FMBT,"I've seen far worse horror films ('Boogeyman', anyone?) than this one, but it still was not one of Wes Craven's best. I'll spare the synopsis since everyone else has written it out, but add a few of the film's strengths and weaknesses.

The story line is rather interesting, though a little too convenient. It's far too coincidental that Ruby becomes civilized then through circumstance ends up in the exact same area from which she escaped.

Michael Berryman and Janus Blythe were excellent. Their performances were two of the three professional (and watchable) ones in the film. Pluto and Ruby were two of my favorite characters in the first film, and I was hoping the second film would at least do them justice. After the opening sequence it all went downhill, but Janus Blythe and Michael Berryman gave strong, solid performances, fitting easily into their roles.

The rest of the cast was, sadly, awful. These people were among the most wooden and obnoxious I have seen in any film, horror or otherwise. One guy was so completely idiotic my 17 year-old son and I both cheered when he was flattened by a boulder. No need to ask which one. Ten minutes into the movie you'll know. And you'll cheer too.

Robert Houston was also very convincing  and natural in the role of Bobby. Bobby was clearly still haunted by the trauma he suffered in the desert, and the scene in which he was in session with his psychologist was extremely believable. If only the rest of the film had been as strong...

I gave it three stars, one for Michael Berryman, Janus Blythe and Robert Houston.

The rest of the film is a cure for insomnia.",1144195200,6,1622,4.670175438596491
1750050,4,B00006FMBT,"Although many reviewers didn't like the second part of the ""Hills"", I still wouldn't call it ""one of the worst sequels ever"" or ""the worst Wes Craven film"". Certainly this is not a masterpiece, even in the framework of horror genre, but I don't see why it should be worse than any other slasher flick. When I was watching it, I came to a conclusion early Wes Craven had been imitating other directors rather often. I'm not saying he was not original at all - eventually he shot ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" in 1984. But ""The Hills Have Eyes"" were reminiscent of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", and in the beginning of 80s, when slasher era started, I guess Craven decided to make something in the same manner. Maybe the reason was Craven's long-time buddy Sean Cunningham created ""Friday the 13th"" in 1980, and Wes was envious? :) Anyway the second part of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" turned out to be a pure slasher like many others at that time. And it obviously wasn't the worst and in many ways was like above mentioned ""Friday the 13th"": the score was written by Harry Manfredini, known to every ""Friday"" fan, and the music in ""Hills 2"" is just like in early ""Fridays"". The body count increased comparing to the first part and approached a regular slasher movie. Kevin Blair who had a leading male part here, would star in ""Friday the 13th part VII"" a couple of years later along with Kane Hodder, who did stunts for ""The Hills Have Eyes 2"" and in ""Friday"" would play you know whom.

Of course here we can see some stupidities as in other slasher movies (like characters wandering in night all alone instead of sticking together, all the big strong guys get killed, and a handicapped girl survives - I'm not even considering it as a spoiler for it is obvious from the very beginning, especially if you've seen a couple of horror films in your life), but is that a problem for a true horror fan? We've learned not to take this trivia into account.

So I think ""The Hills Have Eyes 2"" managed on many levels, and it would be interesting to have it in your collection, if you have the first one. For they are two totally different films talking about the subgenres of horror.",1136505600,14,2165,4.49238578680203
1750071,2,B00006FMBT,"This time out,a group motocross racers on their way to a tournament,and their bus breaks down conventially in the desert where Pluto(who was killed by the dog in the first movie)and the Reaper are hiding in the hills waiting to terrioze those unlucky enough to end up in their neck of the woods. The Hills Have Eyes Part 2 is an unessecary sequel,Pluto was only human and the family dog killed him,he can't come back to life hello! The group of teens tries to fight off Pluto and the REaper. Worthless waste of time,I have saw movies that were a lot a worse,but this one should still be passed up.",1096156800,2,597,4.4363636363636365
1750072,1,B00006FMBT,"Dear Wes Craven fan
please, note the important index in the title : it's part II , not the classical slasher .....above this , although this is presented as a movie of Wes Craven,it has to be forgotten ...definitively....eventually ,even scrapped out of his filmography.",1079136000,2,270,5.022222222222222
1750073,1,B00006FMBT,"Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes was undoubtadly one of his best films, and this lesser known sequel saw the light of day in 1985 after being on the shelf for nearly a year.  This film is loaded with flashbacks of the original film (by Robert Houston, making a return from the first film, as well as the family dog, and I'm not kidding there) as a group of dirt bikers break down in the desert and are stalked and hunted for dinner by a mysteriously ressurected Pluto (Michael Berryman) and his crew.  Hills Have Eyes 2 isn't scary one bit, and looks more like a cheap re-make of the original film.  Craven had a lot of trauma effecting his personal life when this was filmed, so that can be excusable to a point for this waste.  Fans of The Hills Have Eyes should leave this in the dust.",1077580800,5,788,4.268456375838926
1750074,5,B00006FMBT,If you are a die hard fan of Wes Craven and his movies by THHEp2 DVD! Has a lot of flash back scenes even the dog has a flash back! This time a group of motocrosser's venture out to race. The remaining cannibals stalk them. Pretty good. But THHEp1 was better.,1077408000,,259,4.098039215686274
1750075,2,B00006FMBT,"If you haven't seen The hill's have eyes, do not bother to check on thsi one. This sequel is as bad as the worst day of your life. The movie is filled with very dumb flashback (scenes taken from the first movie) that have to explain a movie that does make any sense.
He even brought back to life michael berryman's character, wich in the first movie was creepy and morbid, now is so clumsy and dumb that is not even funny. This is by the way, wes craven's weakest entry. look for the first one, a pretty good exploitation classic!!!! but this one is very very lame!",1067472000,11,565,4.2407407407407405
1750076,3,B00006FMBT,"There's a scene [well, scenes] where all of the remaining central characters are having flashbacks, one by one we see a minds-eye view of that characters experience. After the humans are done the camera pans to the annoying dog that's along for the ride and whaddaya know, he has a flashback to share as well. Yes you read right, THE DOG HAS A FLASHBACK. If that scene doesn't send you off the couch and rolling across the floor in a fit of laughter then brother, check your pulse! A five star scene in a two star film, I'll average it at 3 for the bald dude.",1052179200,4,559,4.283018867924528
1750077,3,B00006FMBT,"This is in my opinion one of Wes Craven's worst films, but even having said that, it still makes for a pretty fun watch. The story hear is basically the same except that now, we have a dirtbike racing team to take the place of the family in the first film. When the racing teams bus break's down, hell ensues, as Pluto and the newly introduced ""reaper"" indulge in some gruesome killing.
The dvd itself is nowhere near the quality I would have liked. The picture is overly grainy, and I noticed a ""shimmer"", for lack of a better word, throughout the course of the fim. All in all the picture quality is that of an old vhs rental copy. I would not recommend purchasing this dvd unless you are like me and are a die-hard ""The hills have eyes"" fan.",1043884800,8,744,4.283687943262412
1750078,4,B00006FMBT,"I enjoy this movie, but the first was far better. The DVD released by Image is subpar in terms of quality. It contains a trailer and scene selection and that's it. But it's the picture and sound quality which is disappointing. The picture is highly pixilated (DVD encoding problem?) and the sound badly needed a remastering update. Still, it's better than a VHS copy, but just barely.",1042675200,2,384,4.746268656716418
1750079,4,B00006FMBT,"First things first, being the Wes Craven fan that I am I was proud to see Hills 2 come out on DVD, but where's the original?  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy this one too, but it's like part one has fallen off the face of the earth.  The plot of this one is similar to part one(you even get good flashbacks to help you along) but to me Hills 2 is more action packed.  Rather than having a family in a travel trailer being stranded, you have a bunch of hellraising friends on a bus(along with some awesome dirtbikes and alot af racing fuel) that seem to put up a better fight against ""The Family"".  Thumbs up on the death scenes too! This is a classic 80's slasher flick that is well worth seeing, and for you Craven fans it's worth adding to your collection.",1034553600,3,761,4.156462585034014
1750080,1,B00006FMBT,"When the first ""Hills Have Eyes"" came to my local drive in I was 18 or so. I went by myself in my VW and saw half of it. I left when the mutants stole the family's baby and were carrying it through the woods mumbling ""mmm...tender baby....mmmm"" and were going to cook and eat it. That was all I could take. It freaked me out. The film was already unpleasant and very disturbing but this scene ended it for me. I have never seen it since and don't care to. I watched part of this sequel on cable and couldn't finish it either but for a different reason...it was just plain AWFUL!  Stupid to the extreme and poor on all counts.  The first one was at least upsetting enough to bother me...so it must have worked on a terror level. But ""Eyes 2"" was ridiculous. I cannot recommend this at all. But if nerve wracking cruelty is your bag then see the first one. It's not really a horror movie at all ----it's just plain SICK.",1032998400,,918,4.1807909604519775
