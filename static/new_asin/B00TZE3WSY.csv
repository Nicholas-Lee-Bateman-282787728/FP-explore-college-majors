8703534,1,B00TZE3WSY,Not worth the money. You can find better interviews on youtube. The majority of these are poorly conducted interviews ripped from low budget radio stations and even one stolen from chelsea lately. Sadly there aren't even any live performances to accompany this fanmade compilation.,1482624000,,281,5.409090909090909

8703540,5,B00TZE3WSY,"Love Florence, and I was eagerly awaiting the release of How Big, How Beautiful - needless to say, I wasn't disappointed. This DVD complements that release well, in which Florence looks back over her career in a number of interviews. So happy the First Lady of contemporary music has returned!",1440028800,,293,4.88
