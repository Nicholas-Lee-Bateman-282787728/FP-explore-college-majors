Able to be enjoyed by all audiences, very quotable, very good music as well as a good variety of style, lots of great elements to this story. I've seen the movie plenty of times, and have recently bought this DVD although haven't plugged it in yet.

Having been in a local band or two, I remember my first watching of this film struck me how they captured the different personality types you can run across in any creative endeavor. The performance at the talent show puts the spotlight on those types, and is very well reaffirmed late in the movie.

I've often thought that now, 20+ years later, a sequel could be done called ""I Wonder"" or something along those lines, perhaps about the daughter of a character that is a huge fan early on in the movie who could have married the bass player or something who goes in search of 'what happend to them?"" and trying to get them to regroup for her parents anniversary or something.

VERY worth seeing!",1487548800,6,1001,4.459016393442623

851965,5,6304342462,"The words, I love this movie are not enough to do it justice! Seriously Tom Hanks as we all know is a genius but this film both directed and written by Hanks is a true piece of art. He wrote this while on tour promoting Forrest Gump. Set in 1964 about a small town band that makes it big, with their one hit wonder ""That Thing You Do!"" this movie is a true nostalgic blast from the past. The clothes, the music everything takes you back to a time that is no longer. The blu ray includes the extended directors cut which is 40 min longer than the theatrical version and it's well worth it! I don't know why it took me soooo long to see this for the first time, but now that I have it's one of my permanent favorites.

Once again, Tom Hanks does not disappoint.  He wrote, directed, and acted in this film. This particular Blu-ray comes with the regular version and extended version (Director's Cut).  If you get this movie, do yourself a favor and watch the Director's Cut.  It fleshes out the characters in much greater detail and explains things you're left scratching your head about when watching regular cut.

852345,5,6304342462,"Possibly my favorite film of all time, this musical comedy has always been a film for any age. My grandparents were able to enjoy it. My nieces and nephews, my little siblings, my parents, and my friends. Its a film I've shown at parties when I was a teen and played the soundtrack DJing at dances. Nearly every line is quotable, and upon multiple viewings by all the people I've shown it to, they agree this movie is hilarious, entertaining, and a movie they want to watch again and again. I recently had to watch this film at a party but due to the rules of the building they made us turn the sound down to barely audible. We turned on subtitles and watched it in almost complete silence, straining to hear anything. And of the group of a dozen people who had never seen the film before, they all immediately loved it and came away quoting it and singing the songs and expressing their desires to watch it again even though there hadn't been any sound. I think that's a sign of a pretty good movie. Is it a perfect film? No, but it is a fully entertaining movie and a worthwhile comedy. This overlooked gem from 1996 about a 1960s rock and roll group that hits it big has been an inspiring film for me personally though as a film it cannot be said that it is together inspiring, though it is certainly memorable and and various flaws or problems people might have with it I believe can be overlooked due to the enjoyment and really solid chemistry between all the members of the cast. The way the story and natural flow this band of characters goes on is what makes the story most enjoyable and how they interact and enjoy their rise to success. I'd love to rate this higher than five stars because to me it's a 10/10. Because it is a movie I think is most a part of my life, regardless if it's perfect or not and it does everything I want a movie to do. It entertains, it gives you a great cast (some A list stars that you would recognize from today in bit parts and small roles before their rise to fame... Most notably Charlize Theron, Liv Tyler, and a even small bit with Brian Cranston!!) it has a fantastic soundtrack of all original songs and the songs help drive the movie from start to finish. This film stays with me and is always there to be enjoyed again and again. What more could you want?",1473033600,2,2305,4.301149425287356

Because it is what it is -- fun, packed with music that's fresh but feels like it belongs in 1964, some sweet moments, nothing truly awful happens, and you feel good walking away from it. The production got the details right; the young cast -- a few who've made bigger splashes since -- are great; and for me, it's probably one of my favorite Tom Hanks performances. The pace may be a bit slow for some; not a lot of sex or big action or huge dramatic depth -- just a genial, feel-good flick.

The portrayal of the conservative and straight-laced father and mother of the character played by Tom Everett Scott is amazing and the detail about their appliance store is reminiscent of 1960's culture. I love Tom Hanks' final assessment once the band breaks up. That is:  Jimmy is the talented one. The guitar player is an idiot. Tom Everett Scott is the smart one (and, fittingly, he gets the girl!). Well worth the watch (and 3 more times as well).",1464825600,,511,4.741573033707865

853212,5,6304342462,"It's hard to believe, that as I write this review, the movie has been out for 20 years (where has the time gone??). It's also hard to believe that prior to purchasing the DVD, I had never before seen the movie in it's entirety. I had seen ""bits and pieces"" of it on TV, over the course of time, but never saw the very beginning, and I missed some parts of the middle of the story. I was browsing the movies listed for sale on Amazon, saw not only the listing of 'That Thing You Do', but saw the ""Directors Cut"" edition, thought it intriguing, so I made the purchase.

I watched ""Disc 2"" of the set first, seeing the interviews of the prime actors, and enjoyed the ""back story"" of the movie. I let it sit for a while, and watched the entire movie yesterday. It was a mostly light-hearted but interesting and well written story, without violence, drugs, or foul language, and a dose of really good, 60s pop music. I guess I find the story personally endearing, as it brings back memories of a couple of my friends who were in local ""bar bands"" in the late 60s-early 70s. The movie mimics some of their trials, tribulations, and fun times of the day, when I was along for the ride. Watching the 'Directors Cut' added a lot of the story that I hadn't seen before, and I found it quite entertaining.

The only distraction I found, was the quality of the video, on the ""movie disc"". Near the end, around the last 5 minutes or so, the video got a little ""fuzzy"", almost like it had been ""pieced in"", whereas it had been very clear and sharp up to that point. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",1456704000,2,1593,4.306666666666667

853437,4,6304342462,"I'd seen and enjoyed this film many times on DVD, so getting it on Blu Ray for the high quality picture and sound made sense.  But upon getting the disc I found that there was actually a far better reason to trade up: The inclusion of a significantly different 'director's cut.'

The theatrical release version of That Thing You Do is a fast-moving, frothy, film not too different in flavor from the song which serves as its center. But apparently writer/director Tom Hanks originally had something else in mind: A slightly darker, more thoughtful, film about the ups and downs of ""making it"" in the `60s pop music field.  The alternate version shows us that initial vision and although it contains everything the theatrical release does, including all the warmth and humor, it also gives us a deeper glimpse into the darker regions that made up that world.

Which version is ""better"" remains to me an open question.  There is something about the shorter, lighter, take on the story that is especially captivating. But for those who love this film -- and I suppose that includes all of us who were caught up in the `60s music scene -- each has something special to offer.

Highly recommended.",1449792000,3,1192,4.734299516908212

853960,5,6304342462,"This was an excellent period piece that was well filmed; well cast and had a rock solid script and excellent music.  The title song by the fictious Wonders (originally One-Ders) was catchy; light; boppy and very believable for 1964, the time in which the story is set.

Charlize Theron who played Tina delivered a stellar performance as Guy's ""Shades'"" girlfriend in the movie.  Shades was the nice guy  on the drums.  You might miss out on her development and evolution if you just see the original version which omitted her in many scenes.  In the fuller version, you find out just how funny she can be and how and why she is a good match for Shades.

Johnathon Schaech as Jimmy Mattingly II was the group's leader and songwriter.  He was also the keyboardist and guitarist.  Lenny Haise, the flighty, quirky guitarist was played to perfection by Steve Zahn.  In some ways one can liken him to Pete Best of former Beatles' fame.  He was not reliable and often showed up late for rehearsals.  Even with this liability, the group  managed to win a college talent show/contest.  T.B. is their bassman and Shades was a fortuitous addition to the group.  He became a member when the original drummer broke his wrist horsing around on a parking meter.

Shades turns out to be the runaway and dark horse star of the group, called the One-Ders (Wonders).  The only thing I didn't like was when Schaech went into an overly long and tedious dissertation about Chord-vettes as a possible name for the group.  Chord as in music and vette as in the Chevrolet.  Okay, we get it.  Enough with the Chord-vette lecture.  Nobody else went for the name and the group became known as the One-Ders instead.  A good name at that.  I also didn't like it when the group's name was mispronounced as O'Needers.  I didn't like the sound of O'Needers at all.

Enter Tom Hanks who agrees to be the group's manager.  He wisely encourages them to spell Wonders correctly so as to avoid future mispronunciations.  Hanks as Mr. White delivers a credible performance as the manager and he signs the Wonders to Play-Tone records.  The group starts to soar and follow the trail of the greats before them such as the Beatles, the DC-5, the Beach Boys, the Kinks and other classic rock delights.  The scenes at the hotel in Los Angeles were funny to the point of being classic.

Each Wonder is given his place in the sun, even bassman T.B. whose name is never revealed.  Each came adorably Beatle coiffed as in those days Beatle coiffure was the order of the day.

The Beatles' influence is prevalent in the movie.  Their group  name was mentioned 5 times in the movie.  The scenes on the Ed Sullivan show are eerily reminiscent of the February 1964 Beatle appearances (filmed on February 9, 1964 and aired over the space of 2 weeks, February 9 and February 16, 1964.)  One can't help but have a giggle at that scene.

When Lenny was off on a tear, a substitute guitarist fills in for the rehearsal.  Again, the Beatles' influence is at work.  In 1964 George Harrison was laid low with strep throat and a temperature of 104 degrees.  His sister Louise  nursed him back to health and on February 8 someone filled in for George while he was recuperating.  Ed Sullivan even threatened to appear on television in a Beatle wig and looked quite a fool wearing one.  Luckily the world was spared that image on television.  Fortunately for all, George rallied in time for the big American performance.  We all know the Beatles without George is like Chrysler without Dodge.  You have to have George or it just isn't the Beatles.  Simple as that.

Liv Tyler as Fay, Jimmy's girlfriend is strong and not a cliche groupie.  She really carried her weight in this film.  She was so good that the movie would never have been nearly as effective or as convincing had she not had a part in it.

The original 1996 version is good, but the newer version with never previously included scenes is even better.  I vote for the extended cut version and no doubt you'll be singing the title song.  This movie will ""break your heart into a million pieces"" just doing that thing it does.",1439856000,10,4126,4.588477366255144

854353,5,6304342462,"Seen several times and not tired of it yet.  Chronicles a fictitious garage band in the early 60's that gets discovered due to one fluke recording and drug through a promotional tour with the implication that the record company had the band's best interests in mind.  Allegedly the way many performers have been treated by record companies over the past few decades that are littered with ""one hit wonders"".  Steve Zahn as Lenny steals the show with his hilarious quotes and constantly annoying Tom Hanks' character.  Music is great and they spare you by not playing the main song in its entirety more than I think twice.  Word has it that the actors sang and played their on instruments in the film, making it more interesting to watch for me.",1433721600,,744,4.6923076923076925

The Blu-ray includes most of the original DVD's bonus features and adds a reunion featurette. The only thing that doesn't seem to carry over are the ""That Thing You Do!"" music videos, but the song is heard so many times during the film and bonus features, that it's okay the video isn't included. The video is pristine and the audio is great! Highly recommended for fans and collectors.",1431734400,,562,4.574257425742574

This movie captures that period perfectly, and even gives us a title song that you'd swear was a genuine 60's hit, though is was conjured up just for this screenplay.  Don't tell anyone, but it may be my favorite Tom Hanks movie...well, next to ""The Terminal"".  I notice he even co-wrote some of the songs.  I'm adding this one to my top-20 list.",1431043200,,519,4.319587628865979

A tiny bit of language and audits situations but nothing they haven't heard or learned about on the bus. The whole package of a movie is so wholesome and fun that everything is cool.

Everything about this - the sixties sets, the music, the storyline, was movie candy if you like this period of time.  Plus it's a good character development plot.  I liked this enough I'm considering purchasing it for the extended version and extras.  Tom Hanks adds a nice touch replacing the band's original promoter half way through.  Worth a watch, and probably a purchase. I do think the song continually being repeated did get a bit tedious.  Loved the actor playing the drummer.",1428624000,,597,4.6380952380952385

The extended cut includes the unnecessary sex scenes and that Tom Hank's character apparently is gay.

For years I thought I'd hate it, based on trailers and tone alone, but was pleasantly surprised. The film's got some issues, no doubt - especially the horribly tacked-on, telegraphed romantic ending - but it's got a lot of soul and I actually started to like the little tribe of stereotypes as we spent more time together. The theme song is appropriately catchy, too, without being grating like a lot of the era's pop records. Which is important, because it plays no less than once every ten minutes. There's good stuff here, with a nice leading performance from (who?) Tom Everett Scott as the band's hip, friendly drummer, but it's also clearly a learning project for writer / director / supporting actor Tom Hanks. Could've been much better with a bit of a trim and a wilder fire burning behind the lens.",1410739200,,893,4.8431372549019605

855546,5,6304342462,"After a movie star hits it big, really big, they usually get the chance to bring a pet project to fruition. Bruce Willis brought out what he thought was a well thought out project in Hudson Hawk which garnered reviews as possibly one of the worst movies in film history. John Travolta, after his career resurgence in the mid-90s, brought us Battlefield Earth which replaced Hudson Hawk as a contender for the worst film in movie history. Tom Hanks on the heels of his success in A League of Their Own, Philadelphia, Sleepless in Seattle, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13, and even Toy Story brought us That Thing You Do! is an example of personal filmmaking at its best.

That Thing You Do!, which was written and directed by Hanks and he plays a supporting role in the film, is the story of small town rock band in 1964, which through a series of accidents and coincidences suddenly finds itself with a hit record, on a rock n roll tour, and on the fast track to Los Angeles for a major label. The movie captures the sense of innocence and naivet  of the characters as they get carried along this stream, but it also captures the fun and excitement of the moment. The scene when they're walking down the main street listening to transistor radios and they hear their song on the radio for the very first time! has a palpable sense of excitement and joy in the moment. I cant remember another movie that has captured that so well.

The movie is well acted, Tom Everett-Scott plays the focal character of the film, Guy Patterson, Eries one beatnik who is asked to sit in for The Oneders (pronounced wonders) drummer and whose input changes the destiny of the band. Johnathon Schaech plays Jimmy Mattingly the serious, talented and ambitious leader of the band who has penned the song that will take them to the top, That Thing You Do!. Steve Zahn plays the goofy lead guitar player who is in the band for the girls, and Ethan Embry plays the bass player (who never gets a name in the movie except to be called the bass player) who is just going along for the ride and is more interested in joining the Marines than being in a rock band. Liv Tyler plays Faye, Jimmys girlfriend and mascot of the band. Hanks himself plays Mr. White, the Play-Tone A&R man guiding the band along its path of rock touring and recording. Although, these roles seem like they're clichs none is played as a clich and that gives each character a freshness, likeability and room for character development present even in the unnamed character of the bass player. A special mention should be made to Obba Babatunde as Lamar, the bellman at the Los Angeles hotel the (renamed) Wonders are staying at, again this could be a stock character played as a clich but Lamar is given life and a vibrance by Babatunde.

The bonus features on the Tom Hanks Extended Cut include a music video for Feel Alright, The Wonders Big in Japan, The Making of That Thing You Do! The Story of the Wonders. Reunion; The Wonders, and HBO First Look: That Thing You Do!  All are interesting and give some great background on how Hanks came up with the idea for the movie and his bringing it to the screen. The only shortcoming is the HBO First Look featurette is pretty redundant of The Making of featurette, one of them could have been left off.

They nailed the aspects of the 60s perfectly. The smoking everywhere, the cloths, the cars, hell, even the way Liv Tyler's character holds her purse, is spot on.

I teach Humanities & I use this film as an intro to 60s culture. The architecture, colors, cloths, music is really good. This is one of few films I own on VHS, DVD & Blu-ray (the other being Blade Runner)

Seems many people think it's a regression to simpler times, but those times were hardly less complex, and the worries were somewhat more intense (such as living under that famous mushroom cloud, for those of you that might remember).

Simply stated, this is an enjoyable film for anyone who just wants to recall those times, and listen to some music that doesn't have the instruments overpowering voice so much the whole tune becomes cacophonous.  My opinion only.

Worth the watch, along with the interviews and such.  Also makes a difference having the whole thing uncut for character study (Mattingly is something of a donkey, IMHO, without a lick of sensibility or the maturity to understand the field of endeavor).  Also interesting to watch the development of the band, beginning to end.

I notice in some other reviews that the actors 'make you believe they could actually play'.  However, if you watch the interview disk reasonably closely, you will see that all the members of the Wonders did learn their respective instruments, and in one comment it was stated that they could actually do a tour.  While they may not have had the repertoire of a professional group, they did play the movie songs well.  If you are familiar with the instruments (including percussion), it's easy to see the skills each had, and as the group developed, the improvement of three of the four.

Nicely done, Mr. Hanks.",1386806400,6,1528,4.87984496124031

The extended version adds considerable length to the film but also gives the characters greater depth.  The longer version is recommended.

I'm a musician, so I can totally relate to the garage practice sessions, and the small town gigs.

I think the Blu-Ray is an improvement over the DVD, but not as drastically as other titles.  The audio is good, but the picture is only marginally better than DVD, leading me to believe that this film was shot at a lower quality than was probably available at the time.

For the first time I was able to appreciate the music that was written for this film. My advice to anyone watching this movie (or revisiting it), is to make sure you've got a good sound system running along with it.

The theatrical cut is far superior as the director's cut is mainly more stuff with Tina and it's all just filler material that really adds nothing to the story. I was in a band back in high school so some of this film is quite relatable but this review is more about the technical side of things.

Picture Quality:

A few scenes look decent on Blu Ray but, overall, it's very low quality video. It looks more like an upscaled dvd and there are a lot of soft edges and moments that just look straight up out of focus. It's painful to see a good movie get a half a**ed treatment like this. Some movies that have suffered this fate upon initial release, ""The Fifth Element"" have later been reissued correctly but I don't get why this can't be done properly the first time. You'd think a Tom Hanks movie, his directorial debut no less, would have been more carefully scrutinized during the transfer process.

Audio Quality:

I know that everyone has different speaker setups but for me, with a 5.1 system, the volume fluctuates wildly when the songs start up. I get that they're supposed to be louder but it sounds like it goes from 5 to 10 instantly and sometimes the drums sound too loud in the mix.

I like that the actors playing the members of the band actually play their instruments.  As a musician who has not been cast in a movie, I am resentful when non-player actors are cast as players; this movie does it right.  And the story rings true That's the music business.  Or, that's how the music business was, once upon a time.  Now, what matters is whether or not you've got a booty and how well you shake it, and how insipid your lyrics are.

856252,3,6304342462,"The theatrical release was clumsily edited in spots.  Mostly in the area of the girlfriend character played by a then unknown Charlize Theron.  It seemed clear that the original script had much more of a story line for her, but much of it was edited out.  I never understood why all of it wasn't removed and her character dropped out altogether, it just didn't add anything.  Perhaps her contract guaranteed a certain amount of screen time, who knows.

The VHS copy included two music videos with snippets of additional scenes with her.  The extended cut restores these scenes, that do fill things in a bit.  But even then, the character adds nothing to the plot.

The same is true of other deleted scenes and very minor story lines which are also restored in the director's cut.  I won't give them away but they seem jammed into the overall plot for no reason, and they are just not appropriate for a feel-good movie set in the early 60's.

I had hoped that the ""Careful, Girls, He's Engaged"" line would get a better explanation.  After all, it set up the last 30 minutes of the movie, and it appeared from out of nowhere.  But the extended cut gave no more background on this.

As others have noted, there's no commentary track which is disappointing.  And the two music videos in the VHS release, are not on this ""special edition"" DVD.

Buy this only if you want to own this movie on DVD.  But if you already have the theatrical release DVD, the special edition isn't worth buying.",1374105600,,1484,4.543396226415094

Both versions included!  You Can't Lose!

There are times when the deleted scenes laid the foundation for certain key moments in the picture. And when those scenes were cut, the movie lost some continuity.

Love the extras, though, for me, seeing them once, was enough.

856337,5,6304342462,"""That Thing You Do"" has been one of my favorite films from its initial theatrical release in 1996. Tom Hanks does an excellent job in getting the essence of the period. But now, after purchasing the blue ray disc, and viewing the extended director's cut, I'm amazed at how even better the film is. So much of the storyline was left out originally. In the extended version Charlize Theron's part is greatly enhanced. Her relationship with Thomas Everett Scott is delved into more deeply. Also, she gets involved with another character that is totally missing from the theatrical release. And there is another relationship that is also totally missing from the original. It involves Tom Hanks. I won't reveal fully what it is. I'll just say, notice in the film he is not wearing a wedding ring.  The title tune is so catchy, I never got tired of hearing it. It should've won the Oscar for ""Best Song"" that year because it was the embodiment of the film. It was its own character, essential to the story. As for the Blue Ray transfer, others have criticized the below par quality I generally disagree. I thought the picture was as sharp as most other Blue Ray discs, with the exception of one scene toward the end of the film that appears not as sharp and clear. It is when Guy and Faye are talking in the coffee shop. It's as if that scene in the film got skipped when being processed. But to me it's a minor flaw that does not take away from the sheer enjoyment. And the Blue Ray soundtrack is superb. When the band is playing to the audiences, the surround sound is so vivid, you are there in the middle of the crowd, keeping the beat, and sharing in the excitement and wonder of the Wonders. A gentle caution to parents of very young children: The extended version does have a few scenes not in the theatrical release that are a little suggestive, that might be given a PG-13 rating.",1373328000,,1884,4.49271137026239

That's the way all of these DVD's should go out.  I always wondered why they can't put the deleted scenes back into their original locations so we can experience the longer movie version.  This one proves that it can be done (PLEASE TAKE NOTE DVD DISTRIBUTORS!!!)

Bottom line; I'm really glad I bought this.  I have watched it several times and it still hasn't got old.",1372291200,,530,4.585106382978723

I was expecting typical blu-ray quality however, That Thing You Do, looks like it was mastered onto a blu-ray disc directly from a DVD transfer. It's not bad, but I just don't see much difference between the DVD and the blu-ray version. To me, it looks like it didn't get the same treatment that other films go through when transferring older films to the blu-ray format. That Thing You Do on blu-ray is not as sharp or vibrant as I was hoping it would be for blu-ray quality. The clarity is just not there. I'm disappointed.",1372032000,4,745,4.398550724637682

Zahn is hysterical, as are they all for different reasons, and Scott seems so comfortable in his role it's hard to believe it was his first major movie.",1367452800,,350,4.1940298507462686

It's hard not to like Tom Hanks in anything, he's just so smart, funny and likeable. You could say the same thing about Tom Everett Scott who coincedently looks a lot like Tom Hanks. Liv Tyler is darling and Steve Zahn is hilarious. If you watch the Directors cut with all the added scenes it adds about 45 minutes, I though I was watching a whole other movie. You won't be dissapointed.",1366156800,,513,4.410526315789474

856697,5,6304342462,"For anyone who has ever seen, and enjoyed, the cut-up, watered-down version of this movie, you owe it to yourself to see the WHOLE thing the way it was intended to be viewed. Tom Hanks perfectly captured the ""vibe"" of that time with his writing ( really captured family life of that era) and his music...some of these songs he wrote on his own, some were a collaboration , but, speaking as a baby boomer, if the music in this picture ( incl. 2 versions of the title son & one totally missing in some TV cuts) had been released in the 60s, they would have charted easily. Another outstanding bonus to this DVD is the extra feature showing how the actors became a real band prior to filming. This is one of my all-time favorites...I don't believe I will ever tire of it",1364169600,2,767,4.333333333333333
856698,5,6304342462,"This movie is brilliant. Great script, acting and direction capture the early-60's pop scene as well as life in Middle America mid-century. Others have done a great job detailing the plot and all the nuances in writing and performance, so I will focus this review on just one aspect: the hidden special feature that hasn't been covered in any of the Amazon reviews I've seen.

So here it is: the DVD starts with flipping a 45 rpm record of The Wonders' hit single onto a record player. On the bottom right corner of the record player, you'll see a knob for controlling the rpms with settings for 33 rpm, 45 rpm and 78 rpm. This knob actually works! You can speed up the song to 78 rpm or slow it down to 33 rpm. I know, big deal, right? Well try it for yourself and see if you don't laugh. It's good clean fun and really brings back memories.

Anyhow, I just wanted to share since no one else seems to have mentioned it. Enjoy!",1363996800,22,927,4.291428571428572
856699,5,6304342462,"Tom Hanks put a lot of work in this movie. He wanted everything to be correct to the time period...mid 1960s.  If you look carefully, they did a GREAT JOB!  The music is catchy and fun, too.  Not a bad song in the bunch. The story is about a garage band who plays at a local talent show and is suddenly skyrocketed to fame with a No. 7 hit on the Billboard charts!  The original drummer of the group broke his arm (by attempting to hop over a parking meter!) so the group comes to ""Irie's lone beatnick"", Tom Scott to fill in ""just for the talent show"". The song was supposed to be a ballad written by the lead singer, but Tom takes it faster and makes it into a dance tune that people love to dance to.  And so the story goes...relationships, the fun of being a new star and then price of fame. It's a true story, by the way.  ALSO: Each actor had to learn to play his character's instrument well enough to pass as a band!!  They actually look like they are playing because they ARE!  That's cool!",1363824000,2,998,4.134715025906735

Maybe its because they love music so much, but they also love the comedy that is brought to this movie. It is a lot of fun and family friendly for kids that are a little older. There are a few elements of drinking, a few mild words including HE double hockey sticks, a few women but dressed better than todays women with the following of that time period, and a few phrases that my boys don't understand and totally meant nothing to them.

856978,5,6304342462,"That Thing You Do just so perfectly evoked a sense of that era for us when the music seemed to be everything...  Well, I sure don't remember going to high school with Tom Hanks, but apparently he listened in to all our conversations, analyzed the meaning of our music, and thoroughly understood the total importance of pop culture in our lives. That Thing You Do is the song that should have been the Beatles first hit, or at the very least recorded by The Dave Clark Five!

If the original version released to theaters was great, I can only call the Extended Cut Two Disc Special Edition totally spectacular. The characters that were merely sweet and funny are now more completely fleshed-out so that their relationships evoke even more emotion in the hearts of the audience. Don't pass up this DVD, because it is, to this date, the finest thing Mr. Hanks has produced in his magnificent career.",1353196800,,896,4.6645569620253164

There are plenty of hilarious parts in it too (Lenny). It's one of those that you watch time and time again until you memorize it. Liv Tyler is a cutie in this as well. Charlize Theron looks better in other movies but is still sexy.,1350086400,,408,4.177215189873418

The movie just makes me happy when I watch it and I find myself humming the soundtrack when I least expect it !  It's a great movie and a great buy !,1335484800,,426,3.8850574712643677
857088,2,6304342462,"That Thing You Do! was a major disappointment for me.  I believe the only reason the movie became so successful is because it includes Tom Hanks and Liv Tyler, two top name actors and actresses.  The ironic part is that neither one of them is actually involved in a main character moment.  Tom Hanks is the record manager for a young aspiring band called the Wonders, but he never does anything particularly interesting.  Liv plays the role of the girlfriend of a band member but her presence was never really noteworthy or interesting either.  They were both *there* but could have easily been replaced by other actors.

The main problem however is that the storyline never does a single exciting thing.  Ever.  Normally when a young band makes it big and releases a hit song, we know where this is going- a crooked manager is going to come out of nowhere and offer them a deal they can't refuse, so they sign it with the assumption that they will remain on top of the world forever.  However Tom Hanks was more or less an honest straight forward man.  He was never someone whose intention was to screw the band over so they never had to suffer the consequences of signing a contract.

The band dissolves when friction arises and one key member eventually quits.  From there the band falls apart.  The problem?  It takes over *90 minutes* for this to happen.  All the stuff in between is total fluff involving the band members becoming big, touring, performing concerts, and meeting their idols and other famous people to help their career rise even higher.  It was totally boring.

Overall, not one of the more interesting ""aspiring young band makes it big"" type movies out there.  In fact it's one of the worst.  Don't let the big name Hollywood actors that star in the movie fool you.",1335398400,,1788,4.619047619047619

The movie and soundtrack is so addicting, I have the soundtrack for a while, that I had to buy this version, as I was curious on how the characters meshed together and answer some questions that I had. It's just exciting seeing in how the band went from being a garage band to being on the National stage in just a few short months, having fun and their reactions to the sudden fame on a single catchy song.

857168,5,6304342462,"How do I love That Thing You Do?  Let me count the ways...
1.  I've owned the original theatrical release when it first came out on VHS.
2.  I bought the excellent, authentic sounding soundtrack.
3.  Placed promo and google images of the movie and cast all over my work station at my last job.
4.  Purchased the director's two-disc DVD version.

In other words, I LOVE this movie and all the things it does.  Great outing for Tom Hanks as a director, this movie tells the story of a group of young hopefuls from Eery, Pennsylvania who are not unlike so many other groups that were influenced by the Beatles and dream of something bigger than playing to the Three Rivers crowd from whence they come.  There is Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) , the drummer who once was in the army, jazz fanatic, and now works in his dad's appliance store while dating the most vain and idiotic girl on earth, Tina, played by a gorgeous Charlize Theron (""Music group"" she says, and Guy lets her get away with it, not using his touted smarts on this one), Jimmy (Johnathan Schaech) who is talented, good-looking, egomaniacal (""I'm reluctant to sign anything that's got to do with my music""--Oh, brother!), and treats his girlfriend Faye (Liv  Tyler) like crap.  At least you can see how they ended up together for a few years because she picks out stupid names for bands like he does.  ""Oneders,"" as in One-ders, which nobody gets except them, just like ""Chord-vettes.""  We have Lenny Haise (Steve Zahn), the crazy funny guy who just wants to have fun.  Yes, he's funny but, just like most of the girls in this film, I wouldn't go out with him either.  And then there's T.B. Player, which is funny all by itself.  We never know his real name, but we know he wants to join the service and has a big jones on for the prettiest member of the Supremes-like Chantrellines.

Then we have Tom Hanks who plays their manager Mr. White from Playtone records.  You just know, since Tom Everett Scott looks so much like a younger version of our director, that he would have played the role of Guy himself if he'd dreamed this film up in the early 80s.  The movie follows this group of one-hit Wonders--admittedly great spelling change--on their short-lived rise to the top, resulting in lots of interband turmoil and several comic episodes.

One thing that would have made this movie greater is a longer story, and you get it in this edition.  The director's cut, of course, has abrupt freezes to different cuts and ""How many times have I told you not to put milk in the coffee"" keeps popping up, but I enjoy the extra time and info this version provides.  In fact, this is the only version of the movie I play anymore, though some people don't like it.  That's not the point.  The movie is fun, touching, full of lively characters, great retro music, and looks very authentic to 60s enthusiasts or anyone who was old enough to remember the decade the first time around.  In the director's cut, we get to understand the relationship between all the characters better, and we understand Guy's family better too.  They're like mine, and maybe even yours.  The second disc is loaded with great extras, including interviews with most of the cast and they look like they're having fun remeniscing.  There is a making of, pormo spots, and much more.  The features are easily accessible and, even if you don't like the director's cut, the original theatrical release is included here as well, so there's something for everyone on this edition.  Not a bad price for everything you get, and some of the most entertaining moments I've spent with a rock flick, add TTYD with the director's cut and special features to your collection, because even the theatrical version with the extras is enough by itself.  A guaranteed good time!",1320192000,,3792,4.624813153961136
857169,5,6304342462,"Four boys just out of high school put together a song that takes them tantalizingly close to the big time as they become a ""one hit wonder"" in the mid 1960's.  Tom Hanks plays the record executive who mentors their group, appropriately named ""The Wonders"" as they are put through their paces.

My favorite scene is the one in which Hanks' character ""Mr. White"" chats with drummer Guy Patterson (played by the appealing Tom Everett Scott)--the only one of the four with a good head on his shoulders.  Hanks' exec has seen dozens of these groups come and go, and has no trouble sizing up each band member.  While White assesses the arrogant lead singer as ""the talent"", he clearly recognizes the reflective percussionist as ""the smart guy"".

Indeed, it is the drummer Guy Patterson who really loves music for its own sake--not as just a ticket to nominal success--and who, while The Wonders are in LA, seeks out a classic jazz club and hangs out with the musicians he truly admires.  Make sure to watch for Hanks' real life wife Rita Wilson as a waitress at the club.

It is also worth noting that a young Liv Tyler plays the girl friend of the lead singer--and the girl who the thoughtful young drummer years for! Charlize Theron plays Guy's erstwhile girlfriend.  It is also interesting to observe that Tom Everett Scott looks very much like a young Tom Hanks.  In casting the movie there was a concern that Scott looked too much like Hanks, until Hanks' wife Rita Wilson stepped in and argued for Scott getting the part.",1319846400,,1521,4.62453531598513

As a musician myself with over 50 years of playing and most of it professionally, this is the screenplay of one of my childhood dreams. Yes, we sat drinking Cokes and trying to think of a name for the band, yes, we were in talent shows, yes, we anxiously awaited the airplay of our first record. And yes, many a good band fell by the wayside thanks to egotistical singers that never made it. Tom Hanks wrote and directed this film,  he also wrote or co-wrote much of the soundtrack and found parts for his wife and kids and many friends.
This ""Director's Cut"" adds another 40+ minutes of film rescued from the cutting room floor. The additional footage does not change the story or better explain any of the scenes, proving once again that the editing people really do earn their salaries. The extra add ins to the new version really do enhance the film watching experience. There are many ""gee I didn't know that"" moments. Making it a must have purchase. I do wish they would put together a package sale price that would include the music CD as well.
An additional area where this film shines is it's ""continuity"" the musical instruments, cars and fashions are impecably accurate. Even down to the ""tolex"" covering on the Fender Amplifiers being the right color and reflecting the new color as it came out.

857274,4,6304342462,"It's a comedy about real young people from the Rock `n Roll planet in the early 1960s. It's funny but also typically American. There are so many sharks going around looking for young teenage would-be rock stars that it is impossible not to be noticed by one, one day, not to become some one overnight and not to dissolved as soon as the top is reached. To stay at the top is really difficult. A band in those days, and in the USA, was the normal way for anyone who wanted to do some music on the stage to go around but bands did not last long. Everyone is not the Beatles or the Rolling Stones, you know. This is the story of the short-lived Wonders and yet the four boys and the one girl who were there at the first public appearance in the boonies, all eventually did something with their skin and their brains, if they had any, both skin and brains. Today that adventure still exists in the USA but it has also taken names like Myspace music, Youtube, Daily Motion and some others. Permanence of course is nothing in that business in 99% of the cases, but chance is also essential for those who have something in their veins. A career is often 50% talent and 50% chance, some would say opportunity. But the film is funny, though so banal that it should be a warning to anyone who wants to imitate these young teenagers. As the old Paxton would say: look after your money, women and a few other things of that type. Yesterday is a sure thing that existed but tomorrow is as brittle as an egg shell in front of a bulldozer. And the world is full of bulldozers crushing many eggshells down into the ground and powder. Dust to dust mind you.

857316,5,6304342462,"1964 was a very good year. The Beatles were at the top of their game, still pretty much friends, and still under the happy tutelage of George Martin and the doting care of Brian Epstein; the happier facets of the 1960s life were in full swing; and a whole generation of Baby Boomers were growing up to the phenomenal soundtrack of melody-capped, harmony-driven classic pop-rock. There's a wonderful, and occasionally sad, nostalgia about Tom Hanks' treatment of this period in TTYD. The mass media technology of records, radio, TV, and films served to bring the country together and to make dreams of fame and fortune both possible and, occasionally, achievable for some. And in those days it still depended on the rootedness of talented personalities, their hard work, survival of demanding schedules, and (of course) the luck and unforeseen tangles of one's interaction with every level of the music end of show business. Yes, it's true that ""it all begins with a song"" but then there's that difficult, epic trip through the land of Oz that one has to bear up under in order to get all the way to the Emerald City (and hopefully back to Kansas as well).

TTYD is a look at 1964, and also a listen to 1964, through songs written in its stereotypical styles (including many by Tom Hanks himself--hats off to him for that), and performed with authentic recreations of the stagecraft, costuming, and public presentations of the time. The world of the music industry--both then and, to a large extent, still today--is portrayed with a surprising lack of varnish as Hanks shows us both the dreams of everyday people coming true and, at the same time, the shallowness of what those dreams ultimately may mean, when they are reshaped by various players in the music industry along the way. We see every tier of advancement for a band, ranging from the (literal) garage all the way up to national attention via radio airplay, movies, and television appearances. And we see the good and bad of every tier along the way: YES, it's possible to climb the show biz ladder all the way to top; YES, it's possible to climb it fairly quickly with the right breaks; and YES, it's even possible to find fun, happiness, and (if one were so lucky) even the right life partner along the way.

Hanks' attitude as writer seems to be: 'Here's the system, and here's an interesting trajectory of one band going through it, and here's a believable happy ending amid a very dismally realistic situation to boot. Local performance venues? SURE--so long as the show's fun for the crowd at the restaurant, which anchors the band. Local talent scouts? SURE--to make you small fry in a small pan, but it's still 'the next level.' Bad matinees? SURE--even at a big city theater. Touring the state fair circuit with a stable of artists who, for better or worse, are held captive to their record company contracts. SURE--the grind of the road. Record company executives who confiscate the credit, limelight, and lion's share of the profits for themselves? SURE--and that's been rather an industry standard for many years. Scripted image-over-substance in Hollywood? SURE--that's part and parcel of movies and TV. I think what I love most about Hanks' presentation of the music/show business industry is that he pulls back the curtain (again, like THE WIZARD OF OZ) so that we can see it's full of warts, missteps, assorted unfairnesses, some sheer dumb luck, a practiced and put-on sophistication, and, occasionally--and even in the strangest places--some insightful, good-hearted, and caring people.

Who are the film's protagonists? I'd LIKE to say it's The Wonders, but they are more of a 'representative sampling.' (Jimmy = the songwriter who lives for his art first and foremost, but who has to come to some kind of terms, though grudgingly, with the vagaries of show business in order to practice his craft; Lenny = the funny guy along for the ride whose cynicism is only equalled by his acute perceptions; T. B. Player = the lovable guy who gets to be in the band but whose personal dreams are on a totally different trajectory and don't really encompass seeking fame and fortune in show business; Guy = the performing musician who's also practical enough to turn his dreams into a reality that can bear some true happiness over the long haul). Each of these fellows seems to be a different sort of 'test case,' though Guy does prove himself 'the smart one' in the end. I'd say he BECOMES a protagonist as the movie progresses. If one wanted to play off the names a bit, he's probably ""Guy"" because he's a ""good guy.""

So: Who are the 'real' protagonists then? Well, Mr. Hanks himself, cast as the American counterpart to Brian Epstein. White knows his business; he knows how to play the game; and he's a careful judge of character too. In so many words, he tells Guy that Faye is the most important thing crossing HIS path at the moment. Faye herself is equally important, because she's pure, devoted, and also smart enough to, in time, see things for what they really are too. She can also see 'who's right for whom.' And I think there are two more protagonists as well: Del Paxton, the Voice of Wisdom concerning the true nature of the music industry and how to survive in it, and Lamarr, the hotel bell-hop, whose sense of decency is unfailing, and whose perception of character is almost clairvoyant. Bottom line: the show business system's tough; there are stinkers and victims all along the way, but there also some gems who value people and integrity more than anything else, and who know right away who's a phony and who's not.

The film naturally has a Tom Hanks flavor, since he wrote, directed, and starred in it. (How could he POSSIBLY have played Mr. White poorly?! He couldn't have, even if he'd TRIED.) What else... Nostalgia for 1964? Yes. A pointed (though not overtly unkind) tweak toward conservative and Christian America? Yes. (We Christians are a notoriously forgiving bunch though, so no hard feelings, Tom.) Some admiring spillover from his then-recent APOLLO 13 experiences? Yes--Clint Howard's back, as the radio DJ; Lenny's last name is ""Haise"" and Jimmy's is ""Mattingly""; the Oneders are on the same bill in Pittsburgh as ""Marilyn Lovell and the Geminis""; Gus Grissom appears as a guest on the ""Hollywood Showcase""; and one of the groups is named the ""Saturn 5."" Some work and public acknowledgement for his friend Peter Scolari and for his lovely wife, Rita Wilson (the sexy, seductive, and savvy Marguirite)? Yes. There's a lesson here for musicians and show biz types alike, offhandedly displayed by Mr. Hanks for us to see if we will just look: Build a network of friends and associates, and build it upon genuine loyalty. When you do that, the system works for you in turn.

It's fun to watch TTYD for the music, for the youth, for the characters, for the actors and their acting, for the writing, for the directing, for the jokes and the laughs from Lenny (Love ya, Steve Zahn!--and I hope you won that livestock competition...), for the careful attention to detail (e.g., the instruments improve/are replaced as the band gets more successful), for the portrayal of the period and of the music industry generally. And if anyone reading this review ever meets any of the actors, songwriters, or others involved with making this movie, do be sure to thank them. But once in a while, at least, watch TTYD also for what it reveals about PEOPLE and CHARACTER. Tom Hanks' honesty in that area is remarkable.

As a classically trained composer who's currently writing pop songs, and who's recently taken a course in music publishing from one of our nation's finest schools devoted exclusively to popular music, my parting thought is that someday I wouldn't mind having my own songs recorded on the PlayTone label too. (Just cut me a good copublishing deal with no controlled composition clause royalty rate reductions, Tom!) For those who are disinclined to believe in happy endings like Guy & Faye's, or who doubt that dreams CAN come true, have look at [...] sometime. Mr. Hanks has made at least that small part of TTYD live on in the real world, and I wish him every success with the endeavor.

857506,4,6304342462,"That Thing You Do is about a band from Erie, Pennsylvania that got together right around the time that The Beatles were making such a hot fuss. When their drummer breaks his arm just before a big talent show, they recruit Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott). The story is mostly told through his shades, and he is also the catalyst that catapults them to fame, when, nervously, he speeds up their song and wins the contest.

-----------------------------
Guy: I hadn't played in front of people in so long, so I was nervous, but it sounds better fast. Jimmy wanted it slow, but he was wrong, it's an up-tempo number. And we won!
========================================

Tom Everett Scott as Guy Patterson is very appealing. He reminds you of a young Tom Hanks, looks-wise. He is very serious about his drums, though he prefers Jazz, and is wise beyond his years -- though he still has some lessons to learn. Like, why is Faye Dolan (Liv Tyler) still with Jimmy Mattingly (Johnathon Schaech) the temperamental songwriter/guitarist who doesn't even treat her very nice when she would be perfect for him?

Lenny Haise, played by Steve Zahn, is the clown of the group. He has most of the funny lines, and he also seems to enjoy their quick rise to fame the most. When their record shows signs of being a fluke hit he doesn't worry that it might be their last. He just enjoys the whole rush of fame as if it were a roller coaster ride.

------------------------
Mr. White: It is very important that you don't stink today.
Lenny Haise: Hey, I make no guarantees.
================================

For a first time director, this is a good effort. Hanks has great love for the era and music, and he tells the story well without becoming too sentimental or cloying, for the most part. His Mr. White is a bit cynical, or maybe just realistic, knowing for The Wonders, a hit song might just be a fluke, and they could end up as One Hit Wonders.

------------------
Mr. White: You guys look great in red, have I told you that?
=============================

Is he exploiting them? Maybe just a little, but he is also watching over them. He has seen it before, the common tale of a One-Hit Wonder group. It's not a tragedy if you only have one hit song in life -- one more than most people -- but it can be if you can never get over it. He tries to keep them grounded, but also encourages them to make the most of it while they can.

------------------
Mr. White: You guys look great in black, have I told you that?
=============================

They took a lot of care getting the music right, and their song, That Thing You Do, sounds like it could have been a hit in the early 60's. They hired Dwight Twilley to write a song, but the one they ended up using was written by Adam Schlesinger, the bassist of Fountains of Wayne, in response to a contest being held by the studio. All the scenes where music is played work well, from the talent show back in Erie, Pennsylvania, to their cross country tour, all the way to Hollywood, California.

857508,5,6304342462,"Man I love this film.

Its the story of the Wonders - thoroughly entertaining and (yes) moving

The Tom Hanks extended (by a half hour!) cut..

I've always been fond of this film. The music is great (the soundtrack cd is especially wonderful - even the tracks by Tom Hanks himself like ""Love you lots and lots"" - though good luck finding the songbook!)

There are wonderful lines (""I...quit. I quit. I quit I quit I quit. I quit Mr White."") Theres a touching love story..

Watching the extended cut again, I'm reminded of the recent Tolkien films, where they added so much footage in so seamlessly, and it added a lot to the point that you would never watch the theatrical cut ever again (unless you had to be somewhere by a certain time and couldn't afford the longer time!)

I like the added time given to Guy Stevens and Faye (Liv Tyler)'s relationship. I can see why some stuff was left out of the theatrical cut - its fun to see Tom Hank's Mr White character bickering with his date, but its not essential.

But if you love this film (it IS a very likable film - even Hanks wife and son have cameos) you really have to get this then.

I like how Guy gets along with his dad, theres a good relationship with his family at work (I like how they don't pay the sister!) Its not cliched - these are just regular kids from Erie Pennsylvania who happen upon a hit song, pretty much by accident..

Theres a strong American Graffiti influence (the end credits tell what happened to the Wonders after) and theres also little nods to Spinal Taps (the Wonders play while aircrafts pass overhead).

Did I mention the music? Yes I have. Dude from the Fountains of Wayne (an actual place in Wayne NJ!) wrote the catchier songs

And thank God they're GOOD catchy songs, cos ""That thing you do"" is played ad nauseum throughout the film, as the group promote it while on tour (often playing no other number!) and then on tv.

Keep an eye out for Peter Scolari (of Bosom Buddies, and friend to Hanks) as the MC on that. Jonathan Demme has a cameo as (what else) a director. White flirts with him btw

Its not a dark film by any means, which is why I like it so much I bet. No rock screw ups in this, who drive themselves and everyone around them to ruin. The worst you get is an egotistical songwriter in the group who rubs everyone else the wrong way.

The dvd extras - well, they're wonderful: interviews with the cast, talking about the film (apparently a lot of kissing in the scene with Cherlize Theron). Heck, you can even play the That Thing You Do single at 78 rpm if you so choose (just click on the speed knob on the title menu while the dvd is loading!)

Again - the deleted scenes DO add a lot to the film. I was watching the deleted scenes for Tootsie recently (4-5 of them all told) and I watched them once, never peered at them again (and I've seen Tootsie at least 20, 25 times all told - even owned the video pre-dvd and watched it on laserdisc besides)

But I tend to watch the extended cut for TTYD. I like how it fleshes out the story more. You see more of Guy talking with his hero Del Paxton, and doing interviews with him and his musical cronies. Which is great.

Nice little scenes - you see the sweet T.B. Player (The Bass Player) hooking up with one of the Tritone singers on tour

Also - I didn't pick up on this first time I saw this film - Tom Hanks is probably the only character besides Guy who cares for Faye. Hanks got a good role here - he has fun with it, you can see hes having a good time; gets a kick from the music. His manager character is an outsider (he tends to be standoffish with the Wonders, although he cares for them and genuinely likes them). But you can tell hes having fun - hes doing what he wants to do, even if hes not given the credit (a great added scene where the head of Tritone takes credit for the Wonders - Guy asks him about it, and White just says ""Never mind. Did you like Texas?"")

So this could be one of the better roles Tom Hank has ever had. His first film role at age 29 (in He Knows You're Alone) was just a cameo where he was a student, basically commenting on the film itself; here hes having a good time - doesn't really let his guard down, but lets it loose when he wants (theres a great shot of him at one of the Wonders live performances of ""Dance with me tonight"" and hes completely internalized but thoroughly enjoying the performance)

And Shades! Guy Patterson's shades make you think back on all the ridiculous gimmicks people in bands have done to stand out. You got the Beatles having the long hair, the Byrds Roger McGuinn wearing different colored shaded glasses, Lennon doing the whole granny glasses bit, Love's Arthur Lee walking around with one shoe.. Groups really are marketed, and the drummer has a whole set of shades he to wear AT ALL TIMES! To make him ""dangerous"" - great stuff.

Very highly recommended film, theatrical OR extended. Very entertaining, especially if you're nostalgic for the 60s (and after all who isn't?) The period background is totally believable, what with the old models of tvs and radios, especially in the Paterson's Appliance store! (Closed on Sunday)",1242172800,4,5159,4.341995841995842

The story is a simple one about a group of average guys who form a band and become one-hit wonders.

Tom Everett Scott, a young Tom Hanks-lookalike, is an appealing lead and Liv Tyler looks very, very pretty in the female lead role. The band in this almost-old-fashioned musical, is good to hear, too. They are a throwback to the old movie musical days of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland. Yes, you hear the same song (the movie title) over and over but's a great song which is very catchy. The rest of the music is decent, too.

Speaking of Hanks, he plays the promoter of the group. It's not a huge part but Hanks, as always, is entertaining. The whole film is, and, is refreshing to see.",1241568000,,962,4.333333333333333

857611,5,6304342462,"""That Thing You Do!"" is, by far, one of the best films ever made about the music industry, even if it is a fictional account. Take it from me, I've been in and around this business for over 30 years now, and these characters (and all of their motivations) are very, very REAL. Tom Hanks seems to have a firm grasp on the emotions involved in the creation of new music; since it's certainly comparable to acting, that's not a stretch for Tom, I guess. But the pure, sheer joy/excitement conveyed by the characters when they first hear their song on the radio is so genuine it makes me well up every time I see it. I've been there; I know what this is like...and this film is it. Mr. Hanks, you are a genius...but this is my favorite piece of cinema from you. And, unlike many ""director's cuts"", the ""Tom Hanks cut"" of ""That Thing..."" only makes the story that much fuller, and richer....without being bloated at all.

857612,5,6304342462,"I loved this movie the first time around - I must have seen it 20 times. I accidentally stumbled across the extended cut on cable a few weeks ago, and I sought out the DVD. It is chock full of special features, most of which are new from the previous DVD release, and all of which die-hard TTYD fans will really enjoy. I'm disappointed that there is no director's commentary from Mr. Hanks. I was looking forward to hearing him narrate the movie. I like the additions to the storyline. It's not just a few extra scenes here and there. There are a few tweaks to chronology that help the storyline make more sense. The romance between Guy and Tina is fleshed out more, and you get a better understanding of why she was so disinterested at the Mercyhurst Talent Show, which was so early in the movie. The timeline around the TV show they appear on is clarified so that you can understand why the seemingly enthusiastic and reliable bass player missed appearing on the program. I don't like the new ending quite as much - the explanation of how Guy ends up staying in LA. I think the studio musician angle in the theatrical release makes much more sense. The ending in the extended version seems very improbable for several reasons. I won't offer details to avoid spoiling it for people who haven't viewed it yet. And who knew about Mr. White's personal life? That was a funny surprise. One other thing about the movie overall is that it's unlikely that fans would be going crazy over the drummer, no matter how cute he is. Fans tend to go crazy for the lead singer(s), but you saw surprisingly little fan interest in Jimmy in TTYD. That aside, I still love love love this movie. It is a delightful homage to 1964, and the music is very authentic and very enjoyable. Think ""feel-good movie"" and you've got the idea.",1232323200,5,1811,4.490909090909091

857615,1,6304342462,"If you loved the original version of this movie, as I do, then save yourself 2.5 hours and go do something else (anything else!) rather than watch this new extended version.  After having sat through it, my main comment on this was that the editor of the original versrion deserved an Oscar because he/she got it right the first time and properly cut out all the unnecessary fat that bloats this version.

There is absolutely nothing of value that has been added to this version.  In fact, after you've sat through what feels like 3 hours of movie and you realize, oh my god, they haven't even gotten through the Big Boss Vic Koss's talent show, you start to wonder just how many more days this is going to go on.

There is no need to explore Guy's and Tina's relationship more in-depth...I get it: Guy's more into his music than he is into Tina and so she heads for greener pastures.  Nor do I need to see the development of her relationship with her dentist...who cares?  I got it that Guy was smitten with Fay...I don't need to see some useless scenes of them yammering about stuff to help me see their budding relationship.  Hey guys, Chad fell down...yeah...got that too...don't need to explore an additional 30 seconds of him rolling in the street holding his broken arm.  The list goes on and on on and on of stuff that landed on the cutting room floor the first time for a reason: it does nothing to enhance the story, all it does is drag it down to a crawl and in the end, the movie is the worse for it.  Oh yeah, the lame cameo appearances by Howie Long?  Yeah, there's a reason his main success was in TV commercials and not in movies.

For all the artistic integrity I perceive Tom Hanks to have, I can't imagine why he felt the need to create this absolute piece of garbage.  This is definitely one of those experiences where I'm left thinking ""Who can I see about getting a refund on my 2 hours?"".  What a useless waste.",1230681600,30,1934,4.368715083798882

The Director's Cut version of That Thing You Do is one of the worst movies you will EVER see. Save yourself the trouble and the money, because it may very well destroy one of the best movies for you if you watch it. I know it seems completely implausible, but it's entirely true. The editing job they did on That Thing You Do, I am convinced, is the best that has ever been done on a film. They took a train wreck and turned it into a masterpiece. I know you won't believe me, no one ever does until it's too late, but heed my warning!

857618,2,6304342462,"""Director's cuts"" are seldom as good as the original theatrical releases. There were undoubtedly good reasons to leave some celluloid on the cutting room floor in the first place.
The additional scenes on this DVD not only do not add much to the original, they actually detract from it. The tight pacing of the shorter version is interrupted. SOme of the scenes introduce an element of sexuality into the film that takes away from one of the chief charms of the original. This was a movie that, on paper, should have been a flop because it was too tame. No sex, no drugs, no cursing. Yet it was embraced by mature movie-going audiences. Scenes involving Guy and Tina, The Bass Player and the Chantrelline, and --- above all -- Mr. White and ""Lloyd"", go a long way towards making this movie like all the others. And the movie is good precisely because it's not like all the others. Or at least, it wasn't until Hanks succumbed to the same ego trip as other directors, and decided he just had to share all his brilliant scenes with the audience.",1225756800,6,1043,4.553191489361702
857731,5,6304342462,"I remember growing up adoring this little film.  I was about eleven or so when the film was released and it was such a huge hit in my circle of friends.  I probably saw the film nearly fifty times before my thirteenth birthday.  Sadly, I haven't seen the movie since, but the minute my wife asked me `have you ever seen `That Thing You Do?' memories instantly came pouring back and I got really excited.  When she told me that she had never seen it I immediately rented it and forced her to watch it with me.

Ten years later and `That Thing You Do' is still as good as I remember.

I will say this right off; the film is littered with clich after clich, but it's done in such a charismatic and likable way that each of the predictable plot points are easily forgiven.  I am a tad partial, I mean this is a gem of a memory from my youth, so maybe I would be less forgiving had this been the first time I had seen the film, but regardless of my reasoning, my rating is genuine and my adoration of this film is unwavering.

It really is that wonderful!

The film tells the story of a band called the `One-ders' (eventually changing the spelling to the more understandable `Wonders') who rise to fame in the 60's.  Jimmy is the arrogant lead singer; or the `talent' as some call him.  Lenny, the guitarist, is the crazy one and their bass player (he never gets a name) has joined the army and will only have a short time left with the band.  When Chad, their drummer, acts a fool and breaks his arm the band recruits Guy (the `smart' one) and with Guy's talent and savvy attitude the band is launched into superstardom.  With a business smart manager, a major label, and their own personal fan (Faye, Jimmy's girlfriend), `The Wonders' hit the road as their hit single `That Thing You Do' skyrockets up the charts.

But what goes up must come down.

As the bands fame continues to grow their loyalties to one another start to fray.  Jimmy allows himself to get too self-consumed; Lenny allows his own sporadic tendencies to tamper with his ability to perform; the bass player (that's so weird, I swear he had a name) allows his future goals to get in the way of his bands success, and left in the wake is Guy who just wants to play, for music is his life.

The acting is really golden here, and the entire cast work to elevate the material, making each and every scene memorable and entertaining.  Tom Everett Scott (who totally looks like Tom Hanks in `Big') is great as Guy, evoking the young mans dire passion for his livelihood.  Johnathon Schaech is a completely believable wreck; Steve Zahn (who I am never truly sold on) is utterly hysterical and completely adorable; Ethan Embry is soft and awkward to perfection and Giovanna Ribisi and Charlize Theron really make the most of their limited screen time.  To me though, the films acting chops come from two sources; Liv Tyler and Tom Hanks.  I am not a usual fan of Hanks.  I find him vastly overrated, but here he possesses such a collected cool, a controlled and natural charisma that permeates his every move.  Tyler is a doll, an utter doll here.  She has such a natural beauty, inside and out, and she makes even the most clichd and or corny material seem effortlessly realistic.

So, you may not fall as deep in love with this little gem as I have, but then again, hopefully you will.  It is nothing short of endlessly entertaining.  The film is about as catchy as the theme song, which never gets old, no matter how many times you head it.",1223942400,,3500,4.402799377916018

You find yourself constantly thinking, 'why did they put this in the movie?  Oh, right...they didn't.'  It's clear why the deleted scenes were--deleted.  You see more of Charlize Theron cheating, Tom Hanks acting ambiguously gay, and more of Jimmy being a jerk.  The new material turns the original characters into unrelatable caricatures which then come across as over-the-top and ridiculous.

That said, this movie remains a solid family favorite.  I won't watch the extended version again, but it is entertaining to watch the other, behind-the-scenes extras.  It was especially interesting to watch the cast members learn their instruments and tour Japan.

857862,4,6304342462,"Tim's review for Video Watchdog of the exztended cut of THAT THING YOU DO had me howling for a crack at the new 2 DVD version that's supposed to be thirty minutes longer.  Well, I watched it and you know what, I didn't find the expanded version so great.  We do get more of Charlize Theron's character.  But she's awful even at full length (I mean the character, not the delightful actress who plays her), and the emphasis on her back story comes, to me, at the expense of Liv Tyler's character and she's supposed to be the heroine!  Why don't we know as much about Tyler as we do about Theron--her family, the other guys in her life, her dreams and hopes?  Other reviewers keep calling her the unofficial fifth member of the band, but in the film itself it's only Guy Patteron who accords her this status, and she seems resigned to being a nothing.  She doesn't even try.  In a way, her resignation is appropriate for the period of the film, in which few women )especially those without musical talent) muscled their way into rock groups.  But otherwise it was just like, if Faye didn't land Jimmy, and you can tell from frame one that she won't, then it's up to Guy to make an honest woman out of her.

The movie has a bad case of the Kindly Black Stranger syndrome, doesn't it, just like every other Tom Hanks film.  That's when black people show up on screen but only to provude the clueless white hero with some direction in life.  It happens to our boy Guy Patterson not once but twice.  First he idolizes the fictional Ray Charles like piano player idol Del Paxton (Bill Cobbs, from THE ULTIMATE GIFT), and then he meets his idol who changes his life.  Then he meets a helpful black doorman at the Ambassador Hotel (Obba Babbatunde, playing ""Lamarr"") who sends up the helpful black stranger thing with his unbelievably bad acting--I think it was just plain refusal to play his bad scenes as written.  I won't spoil the movie for you by telling you his function in it.

Meanwhile, I kept thinking (after seeing BOBBY, the movie about Bobby Kennedy's last day of life) that this film must have really influenced Emilio Estevez and the other people who made BOBBY!  They seem to have imported every hotel character in THAT THING YOU DO and just brought them over wholesale directly into BOBBY!  Check out the beauty parlor scene in both films--and then ask yourself which movie has Sharon Stone as the fading, rueful beautician?  You can't remember, because they're the same movie!  I figure that the Lamarr character later ages and becomes the Harry Belafonte character in BOBBY, while the hotel cafe where the romantic action takes place in THAT THING YOU DO is, of course, the tragic mise en scene of BOBBY!  Check it out and get back to me about this.",1200873600,,2759,4.5353535353535355

858000,5,6304342462,"Last week, I saw ""That Thing You Do!"" on one of the cable movie channels. I had not seen it for a while and had a couple of hours staring me down, so I sat back and watched it. The film itself is a nice piece of work by Mr. Hanks. He did himself proud. And that song! What a catchy, get-under-your-skin-in-your-brain pop tune!

Then, two days later, I was in Best Buy (humming That Thing You Do, by the way) and this new edition DVD appears before me unexpectedly, on sale. Without thinking, I bought it, took it home and I have watched it three times since (the theatrical release, once and the extended version, twice) and I will watch many times more.

This new release of That Thing You Do! underscores why ""The Director's Cut"" genre in DVD releases has become so invaluable to film aficionados like myself.

The theatrical version is priceless (still), but the ""Director's Cut"" is incredible and a major revelation. So many gaps in the plot have been filled in (gaps that I wasn't even aware of, so well put-together was the original version). This newer version has made the film a mini-masterpiece.

As in the original, the cast is excellent, the plot is believable and charming, the performances are funny, vibrant, true-to-life, and in this version, quite poignant.

Charlize Theron's character, Tina, and her relationship with Guy, in particular, suddenly become crucial elements to the early plot development (she is a minor character in the original version). Her character is fleshed-out, and she has one HYSTERICAL scene (in the dentist's chair) that caught me so off-guard with its humour, that I nearly choked to death with laughter!!

Even Tom Hanks character as the group's manager, Mr. White, becomes more developed and there is an interesting scene and dialogue when the group is in Los Angeles at ""the same hotel Lucy and Ricky stayed at"" between Guy (who is gently drunk), Mr. White and a guy named Lloyd.

Even The Bass Player (the Wonder's bass player who is never given a name), played by the adorable Ethan Embry, has a scene or two not in the original film that adds to the sweetness of his character (as well as some sly sexiness).

Liv Tyler's role as Jimmy's girlfriend, Faye, becomes even more developed and she is such a marvelous actress in this film. She really is the heart and soul of the movie, and the newer version only adds to her wonderful mystique in this film.

And of course, Steve Zahn as Lenny, is still as funny as ever and is the one band member who has no fear to ""push the envelope"" and ride the roller-coaster of success to wherever it takes them.

I recommend this new version of ""That Thing You Do!"" whole-heartedly. Whether it is the original or the extended-cut, it is a lively, spirited, upbeat and thoroughly delightful viewing experience.

858190,5,6304342462,"As a musician who remembers the 1960's and has played since the 1970's I can tell you that this movie is very ""real"" in its portrayal of the times, the music, and what it's like to be in a band.  The little details of how the members interact is very authentic whether they are playing music or hanging out.  The title song would have knocked the Beatles off of number one for several weeks.  And the overwhelming excitement and joy experienced by making a recording, and then hearing the song on the radio is some of the best film that I've ever seen in any movie. You can't help being ""happy"" for the characters and equally excited.  And you can't help but think that this must be a real band.  As someone who has recorded I can identify with this.  ANd although I've never (to my knowledge) had a song played on a major radio station (may have had college air play --not sure--we submitted the song but I didn't listen to that station a lot), one of my band's concerts was announced many times on the major radio stations WMMR and WYSP in Philadelphia.  They didn't play our music but just announced where and when we were playing and who we were.  And even THAT was amazing to a small town band.  Radio was a big deal back then.  Music and radio were important to almost everyone.  Who and what you listened to helped define who you were as a person.  It was very important, even for non-musicians,  from an artistic/self-expression standpoint and also as a social link for people in a more broad sense.  Although people can now fairly easily get ""airplay"" on the internet --which is a good thing-- the internets instant access and ease of use means that almost anyone --even non-musicians--can put themselves out there for public viewing as if they were accomplished professionals.  This was not so easy or so accessible when radio was important.  SO it was a much bigger deal to be featured on radio.  ANyone can get on the internet even if you only have one fan.  But for radio, someone else had to like your band.",1182124800,2,2021,4.475409836065574

858192,4,6304342462,"Going all the way back to the Bosom Buddies days, I have been a big Tom Hanks guy (no pun intended, okay, maybe a little). Many kids today probably never heard of that show or even now that Hanks was arguably one of the funniest men of the eighties. This may be thanks to his back to back academy awards for Philadelphia and Forrest Gump along with the one that got away, Apollo 13. With that trio of films, Hank pretty much had carte blanche to do as he pleased in Hollywood and after a few serious films, Hands decided for a lighter fair that he decided to write and direct himself.

That Thing You Do! followed the rise of a sixties band, the One-ders, from talent shows in Erie, Pennsylvania to the Billboard charts thanks their the uber-catchy song that shares the name of the movie. Even though stars in the movie, he doesn't show up until the middle of the movie as the bands' big time manager who wisely changes the band's name to the Wonders to avoid confusion and mispronunciation. Instead Hanks leaves the movie in the hands of a cast who were relative unknowns back in 1996.

Leading the way was the Tom Hanks look-alike Tom Everett Scott (Dead Man on Campus) as the last minute replacement for a talent show as the band's original drummer, played by Earl Hickey's old pal Ralph, broke his hand right before the show. Not that he endeared himself to his new band mates, primarily principle writer Johnathon Schaech (The Sweetest Thing), who song Scott speeds up as Schaech wrote That Thing You Do as a balled. But the rest of the band, Steve Zahn (Saving Silverman) the rambunctious guitarist, and Ethan Embry (Can't Hardly Wait) filling out the quiet one quota in the band.

And Hanks isn't the only one in the cast with a little golden man as the film was one of the first times anyone saw Charlize Theron (Sweet November) as she shows up as Scott's disinterested girlfriend. Then there was Liv Tyler (Jersey Girl), who may be a little more well versed in seventies rock than sixties pop, as the unofficial fifth member of the band and Schaech's main squeeze. Hanks wasn't shy about also giving some work to his friends and family as both his wife and kid, Colin in his first on screen roll, make cameos as well as his former Bosom Buddy Peter Scolari who hosts the Ed Sullivan like show the Wonders performs on.

Just as important as the casting was the role of writing a song that actually could have been a hit back in the sixties. And they definitely were successful with that with That Thing You Do, a catchy ditty written by Adam Schlesinger, who later got a hit singing about Stacy's Mom with his band Fountains of Wayne years later. The song was so good that not only did the song fictitiously land in the top ten on the Billboard charts in the sixties, it peaked at forty-one back in 1996 for real.

Over ten years after its initial release, the movie gets a special edition treatment with the Tom Hanks' Extended Cut with over thirty minutes of footage of scenes that originally saw the cutting room floor for the original theater version. This does make the the Extended Cut a little long in the tooth in parts of the film (but you can always check out the Original Theatrical Release if the extended version is too long for you). There is also a second disk chalk full of extras that includes three featurettes, a reunion of the cast, HBO First Look, your garden variety of TV spots and trailers, and more.",1181260800,,3432,4.4848
858193,5,6304342462,"I enjoyed this cut of that thing you do it had been a while since i had seen the film at all and been a British customer it was a joy to see this as you cant get this cut on DVD over here yet.  The cast are great including the gorgeous Liv Tyler back then she was not even known at all this being her first big screen outing also keep your eyes out for a other well known face in the form of Charlize Theron in here 1st appearance on screen as well but i think the directing is great Tom Hanks picked a great time to make his directing debut in what is a amazing and funny take on life as a young pop group as they try to make it in the big wide world.

Great film and a must buy",1181174400,,679,3.6758620689655173
858194,4,6304342462,"With the added length of this new director's cut, the fun, bouncy ""That Thing You Do!"" is now the fun, bouncy, semi-epic ""That Thing You Do!""  But that's okay... if the film plays a little long now, it IS on DVD and you can always take a break and stretch a bit before resuming the fun.

For what it's worth, I enjoyed the added scenes.  You get more details related to the rise of ""The Wonders"" and more details once the group really hits its stride and does TV, movies, and packed-house concerts.  The added Charlize Theron/dentist scenes are also amusing, and happily don't overwhelm the film because there aren't all that many of them and they aren't drawn out.

More importantly, this new cut makes the conclusion of the movie work a little better.  I always thought that the break up of ""The Wonders"" pretty much came out of left field, as if the producers said to themselves, ""well, the movie's about to end, so we gotta break them up to keep the whole one-hit wonder thing in place.""  Now, there are a few subtle pieces of set-up throughout the movie, showing that lead singer Jimmy isn't always the easist person to get along with and maybe has a bit of an ego problem.  So, now, when the dressing room scene comes along where Jimmy is annoyed with the group and his girlfriend and generally pretty much everything else around him, and quits the group, it no longer feels like it's coming out of nowhere.  The scene wasn't fatal to the movie before- as sometimes things DO come out of nowhere- but the scene works much better now.

The extended cut also doesn't interfere with the well-done flavor of the film's closing moments in general.  There was always a nice balance between the characters saying to themselves ""yeah, it's sad that the group is breaking up"" and the more upbeat ""well, we knew deep down it wouldn't last forever, so let's just be happy about the really great ride we had"".  That balance is happily intact in the longer cut.

The extras on this new DVD are also a lot of fun.  The peek into the Japanese publicity tour for the film is particularly interesting, and revealing.  If you think the media hypes things here, wait'll you see how far they push things in Japan.

Great movie, great DVD.  Don't hesitate to pick it up.",1181174400,3,2255,4.514778325123153
858195,5,6304342462,"I confess that I love this movie all out of proportion to its stature. It won't change anyone's life or give them profound insights into the human condition but, especially for people who grew up in the Sixties, it provides a perfect little picture of a time and a place and a milieu -- the dawn of the modern rock era in a typical small American city -- and it does so with spark, humor, and excellent characterization. It's fun, but it's grounded in the real lives that some of us actually led.

This new Director's Cut restores a great deal of footage. Fortunately for newcomers to the film, the original theatrical cut is also included, and it's the version that should be seen first. There really was nothing wrong with that version at all; I always thought of it as ""a perfect little film.""

The longer version isn't ""little"" any more, but it's still pretty much perfect. What's added does slow the pace of the first half of the movie considerably (undoubtedly why it was removed), and now it takes much too long for the core narrative, tracing the short but forgettable career of The (one-hit) Wonders, to get going.

But once you know the story, you won't care, and you'll love the added sequences expanding on the relationship between Guy (Tom Everett Scott) and the shallow, ambitious Tina (Charlize Theron) who sees much more of a future with a hunky dentist (Keith Neubert) than with a drummer in a rock band. The quality of the writing and acting in these and other restored scenes is fully consistent with the rest of the movie.

It's too bad there's no commentary track, but the second disc's extras are worth watching, and one of them -- The Story of the Wonders -- almost serves the function of a commentary, as Hanks and the actors talk about the backstories and personalities of their characters. Additional extras provide the usual array of making-of and behind-the-scenes footage.

Should you replace your old DVD? If this is a movie you keep coming back to, then yes, you'll want to have the Director's Cut. And for newcomers, this is now the definitive release of a movie that deserves a great deal of respect.",1180742400,5,2133,4.647214854111406
858196,2,6304342462,"I totally loved the theatrical release of this movie and have watched it on dvd numerous times.  It is by no means a perfect movie -- notably the dialog is as hackneyed as one would expect from a first time screenwriter like Tom Hanks.  But the energy of the shorter version allows one to ride over the endless cliches.  The longer version cannot maintain the energy and the flaws become more grating.  Moreover, the longer version has a few additional scenes that portray the Liv Tyler ""Faye"" character in an inconsistent unpleasant light.

Moreover, not only are the extras on the second disc not particularly enjoyable, but inexplicably, despite having an additional disc, the two disc version leaves off the two performance videos extras -- the best extras -- from the original single disc version, adding a musical video of a song NOT performed by the Wonders.  All in all, this two disc set is a great disappointment, being both too much and too little of what made the single disc dvd so enjoyable.

With no major scenes added (Besides a funny cameo from Kevin Pollack) this 2 1/2hr cut is a much more layered film with worthy character development (the family back home and more Charlize Theron..surprise)  and a lot more insight into the behind the scenes of 60' entertainment and the backstage life of a Rock&Roll band. The now classic anthem title track still manages to hold out for the duration of the film, a much better compliment than the original(TV Movie) score. With great wardrobe, set design, a quick pace, and sharp script by Hanks the movie really deserves it's now epic length. (ala Spartacus)

858324,4,6304342462,"That Thing You Do! is Tom Hanks' tribute to the slew of rock `n' roll bands that followed in the wake of the Beatles' phenomenal worldwide success. Record companies in the 1960s were desperate to find the American equivalent in the hopes of making the same kind of profit. The result was a lot of one hit wonder wannabes. Hanks' film (his directorial debut) is a fictionalized account about one of these bands. With this new DVD, he has revisited the film, adding 39 minutes of deleted scenes to it.

For his directorial debut, Hanks wisely doesn't try to bite off more than he can chew. He keeps his ambitions modest and isn't too flashy with the camerawork. He understands that nothing should get in the way of the story or the characters. However, his script does show a lack of experience as little things, like a repeating gag of Guy proclaiming, ""I am Spartacus,"" wears thin very quickly. With this new extended cut he has provided too much of a good thing. The additional scenes pad out the running time to over two hours and what was once a tight, pop song has become a bloated power ballad. Fortunately, the perfectly fine theatrical cut is included as well.

That Thing You Do! is an affectionate, nostalgic look back at simpler, more innocent times, just before the country became mired in the Vietnam War and the social and political climate changed radically and with it the music. Hanks recaptures a time when hundreds of screaming teenage girls would mob the bands that they worshipped, a time before the Internet so that music was promoted via the radio which had the power to make or break a band.

There is the music video for ""Feel Alright"" that features a montage of clips from the movie.

""The Wonders! Big in Japan!"" takes a look back at the promotional tour for the movie in Japan with footage of the actors goofing around at the time. The actors recount amusing anecdotes about their experiences. They even showed up to talk shows dressed in character performing ""That Thing You Do.""

""The Story of The Wonders"" is a promo featurette done at the time of the film's original release. This is pretty standard fare with interview soundbites with Hanks and the cast with lots of clips from the movie.

""Making That Thing You Do"" examine the creation of the movie and was done at the time of the film's release. From Hanks writing the screenplay to the finished product, this is much more substantial than the previous featurette and goes through the casting process and then takes a look at how the four lead actors learned how to actually play their instruments and act like a band.

Easily the best extra is ""That Thing You Do! Reunion"" which reunites Charlize Theron, Johnathon Schaech, Tom Everett Scott and Ethan Embry with Steve Zahn interviewed separately. They laugh and reminisce about doing the film. They talk about auditioning and how Hanks gave them the freedom to improvise. Everyone dishes filming anecdotes in this fun extra. Sadly, Hanks is strangely absent which seems rather odd considering what an obvious labour of love this film was for him.

""HBO First Look - The Making of That Thing You Do!"" is a brief look at how the film came together hosted by ex-MTV VJ Martha Quinn that essentially repeats a lot of what is included in previous featurettes.

Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) works in his family's appliance store and loves Jazz music, but he fills in during a talent show and changes the beat from a slow ballad to a dance-able tune and starts a chain reaction.  They record the song and get picked up by a talent scout and later a ""record label"" and end up in Hollywood with a top-ten Billboard hit.  Along the way they change their name from the ""One-ders"" (which everyone is constantly mispronouncing) to the ""Wonders"" and eventually have a melt-down as personalties clash and they drift in separate directions.  They end up as just another ""one-hit wonder"" but the trip is fun as you share in their excitement.  I especially liked the scene at the talent show and later when their song is first played on the radio.

Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't get tired of the hit song ""That Thing You Do"" or the other songs they play.  The other bands and their music are so true to the era that I was surprised to learn that none of the music in the film is from actual singers or bands, but all are entirely fictional.  I especially liked ""Time to Blow,"" the song Guy plays with the fictional Del Paxton (and if anyone can point me to similar music, ie. piano and drums jazz w/o horns, I'd appreciate it).  In fact, I liked the music so much that I bought the soundtrack and still enjoy listening to it.  Although it's all a bit before my time, it all looks and sounds like authentic early 60's.  And the other actors (Tom Hanks, Liv Tyler, Steve Zahn, Johnathon Schaech, and Ethan Embry who is known simply as the Bass Player) are all great and from what I've seen on VH1 all learned to look like they were actually playing the right notes and chords.

858332,5,6304342462,"When I saw this movie advertised in the theatres back in 1996, I rolled my eyes in great disdain. For one thing the advertising banner - ""In every life there comes a time when that dream you dream becomes that thing you do"" hit me the wrong way. After all, 95% of us never wind up doing the dream we dream...there is no WHEN in our lives for this event. Plus, I just figured it was an attempt by Tom Hanks to go highbrow via a directorial debut after those back-to-back Academy Awards. I finally saw the movie over Christmas vacation this year and really loved it. The first half is very upbeat as the band gets started out. They truly are the ""One-ders"", just like many other bands of the Beatles' transitional era. They wrote and performed one song that got them national attention, and then couldn't follow up with anything else. That's too bad, because the band does get one lucky break after another at the start. The guy in the camper that shoves a bowl of stew and a contract in front of them and tells them to ""trust me"" could have had them signing anything. They got lucky that he was legitimate and really did intend to get the record on the air and not steal it from them. That's what makes the disintegration of the band at the end so sad. One by one, they just walk away from their dream. To me, if the movie had any flaw, it was this - the bandmembers just acted like the whole thing was one big amusement park ride rather than a once-in-a-lifetime life changing opportunity.

Finally, I also loved all of the authentic looking stage designs. The home appliance store really brought back memories. These type of family owned appliance stores were all over the place back in the 1960's before the big box stores gradually made them extinct. Plus, the appliances being sold looked just like what was available in 1964 right down to the brand names and the styles.

I liked the movie so much I went out and got the DVD - it's quite cheap now considering it's over ten years old. The DVD extra content includes six theatrical trailers.

858394,5,6304342462,"This is a great entertaining film of a small band from Erie Pennsylvania that picks up a classic blues drummer who alters the tempo of a ballad making it a hit pop tune. Great acting and humor by fresh faced actors by Scott, Schaech, Zahn, and Embry as the band and playing the sweet and innocent girlfriend is Liv Tyler. Of course Hanks pulls it all together as the band manager in his version of an American mid 60s version of the Beatles. The movie evolves with the song that is played often through out as the song evolves from a surprise hit in a small college contest to a cut that permeates the radio and plays constantly on tour with several great songs that fit the period well with entertaining songs by other bands and vocalists on tour. The film gives you all the fun and excitement of a youthful band climbing the charts with tension that seems to join success. Zahn keeps it loose with a sarcastic wit that keeps things light as the lead singer/writer emotes into a sulky driven artist looking to fulfill his own version of destiny.

In contrast to the original DVD, the second disc includes several scenes that were cut that add to a less innocent side of the individual characters causing them to lose some of their freshness. Some of the scenes that were deleted include more adult relationships with their girlfriends and a more obvious portrayal of Hank's version of Brian Epstein along with a glimpse of his personal life. The darker cut is worthwhile to watch and an interesting contrast but the cuts not featured in the original demonstrate why it was the successful cut, it keeps the characters looking fresh and innocent making them attractive as the small band underdogs from Erie, Penn that make it big, with a real world ending.",1167868800,,1755,4.60702875399361

858398,1,6304342462,"This film is so god-awful it makes me sweat with embarassment for my limited participation in enabling its existence by having seen it. TTYD might be an OK film to someone born after the era which Tom Hanks attempts to convey here through clich and outright quasi-Beatloid parody, but there are films aplenty from the 1960's that pretty much tell the same stale ""unknowns-make-it-big"" saga with far more authenticity and sincerity, simply by having been made during that time. Not even as believable as a film with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello, nor as musically sophisticated.",1161216000,,584,5.09375
858399,4,6304342462,"I admit to really loving this movie.  I read somewhere that Tom Hanks came up with the idea for the script after watching a Beatles documentary.  Based on the timing of its mid-90's release, I'm certain it was the Anthology series - which aired in that period on ABC television.  Being a huge Beatles fan - and having almost worn out my Anthology DVD set - you can see a lot of the small touches in TTYD taken almost verbatim from the glory days of Beatlemania.  As I've read in other reviews, the only real problem with the story arc is the Jimmy character.  There's no real evidence of his genius, nor is there a trace of likeability.  You also don't accept his ""artistic gravitas"" (which manifests even while he's still playing in his parents' garage in small-town Erie, PA), because there's not even the slightest hint that he has the goods to back it up.  The song that becomes their one hit only did so because it was played contrary to his original concept.  This makes the climactic, inevitable ending ring hollow, because at that point you're sort of glad that scowling, sulking and ever-petulant Jimmy is gone.  I liked Tom Everett Scott a lot, but Steve Zahn basically walks away with the movie as Lenny - it's kind of a shame he hasn't had more substantial comedic roles over the last 10 years.  One of the little details I liked is that they started out as a true garage band, with cheap Sears & Roebuck Silvertone guitars and worn out drums.  By the time they reach the middle of their state fair tour, and the record has significantly charted, they're all playing on brand spanking new Rickenbacker's, Fender's and (I think) Ludwig drums.  The short scale red Rickenbacker that Jimmy plays is the same model John Lennon used, and in a couple of scenes you can see Jimmy standing on stage aping his head-up, cocksure, wide stance at the mike.

Even with the flawed storyline, if you're a fan of great 3 minute pop songs (which TTYD certainly is - in spite of being written for the movie), and you're lurking somewhere in your mid-40's and nostalgic for the 60's (which I certainly am), then this movie is a rare and great treat.",1156896000,2,2142,4.532467532467533

858523,4,6304342462,"This is a sweet film. Not only did Tom Hanks write and direct it; he also composed some of the songs. Set in the early 1960s, the film chronicles the rise of the (entirely fictional) band ""The Wonders"" (aka the ""One-ders"" as in they end up with only a single hit). Their hit song ""That Thing You Do"" rises in the charts, and they cross the country playing state fairs, finally ending in Hollywood.

This concept allows us all the pleasures of nostalgia for a far more innocent time (at least as it's portrayed here): the cars, the clothes, the hair styles, the step-and-fetch-it bellboy who attempts to micromanage the love interest from his spot in the taxi-line. Liv Tyler and Charlize Theron are, of course, gorgeous, and the guys are so cute too. Tom Hanks' boyish grin has never been brighter. And despite the inevitable tensions that cause the band to break up, the film comes to a sunny and satisfying end -- Nothing really bad ever seems to happen to this crew. The whole thing would be hard to believe if in fact it were not entirely ficitonal, including the pseudo-biographies that tell us what each character is ""doing now."" Oddly that chutzpah (giving us the real history of made-up folks) signals both the movie's strengths and weaknesses.

Its singleminded optimism is why this isn't a five-star movie, for all its charm. All bright surface, the film becomes a tad repetitive. Case in point: The sheer number of times that the hit song ""That Thing You Do"" is played. It's a snappy tune, no doubt, but we don't need to hear it five hundred times (well, maybe it was only about twelve). This could still have been a sweet and adorable movie with just a little more preparation for some of the character flaws that lead to the conclusion. Definitely fun to watch, but still too predictable.

We WANT to think that nothing was going on in this time period but aspiring bands competing with the Beatles, soda fountains, neon signs, princess phones, and cute girls with curlers in their hair, but actually -- as Hanks clearly knows -- that bass player who volunteers for the Marines is heading off to Vietnam and that bellboy will be marching for civil rights in a quick shake of the hourglass.

I'm not against innocent pleasures, but this film is aggressively cheerful and one-dimensional. A more interesting and entertaining movie could have been made about these same themes.",1146441600,,2387,4.7170263788968825

858525,5,6304342462,"Suppose you're a young but solidly established - indeed, award-winning - star in Hollywood who, as many actors are won't to do, would like to direct movies yourself. You have a few TV projects under your belt, but the silver screen is where you'd like to go next. What would you pick for your first film project?

An edgy thriller? A schmaltzy romance? A crime drama? When Tom Hanks directed his first film, we can all be glad it was none of the those, but rather a tribute to the spirit of a time when no dream seemed unattainable.

That Thing You Do! will not go down in history as a great film, but it deserves to be remembered as a good one - a simple tale told in a straightforward and engaging way, about people just like people we all know, getting a shot at greatness.

In short: an early-60s going-nowhere garage band makes a change, which leads to their song becoming a hit locally, and then nationally. The film follows The Oneders from their humble beginnings in Erie, PA to their peak of success as The Wonders and thence to their ultimate destiny as a group and as individuals.

This isn't High Art - just the telling of a story. The characters make mistakes big and small, achieve successes big and small, and are variously cruel and kind. You know - just like real people.

Unlike much of real life, however, this movie is almost entirely suitable for family viewing. Very little bad language - none ""blue"" that I can recall - and no sex or drugs, despite the rock-and-roll.

There's drama, albeit not terribly heavy. This isn't a film that requires deep thought; you might be disappointed to find that the most profound point of the movie is that sometimes people use other people for their own ends. Which, come to think of it, is pretty much like real life.

There's a fair amount of humor as well (much of it inspired by the bands poor initial choice of a name) but it goes by so quickly that it seems to have been included in the movie in order to set a general light-hearted tone rather than to inspire laughs... but I laughed often enough to want to see it over and over.

This is a movie that is simply made to be enjoyed for itself, and I certainly did.

Some notes:
* Tom Hanks, fresh from Forrest Gump and Apollo 13, is the big name on the playbill, but he's not the lead. The part of Mr. White, the agent, could have been filled by many people. Hanks works so well in the role because when the character has anything to say, you have to pay attention to him - his interjections are often important to understanding where the movie is going.

* The cast rehearsed as a band for weeks before performing on film, though most (if not all) of their performances were dubbed. Nonetheless, the members of the band clearly loved what they were doing. I suppose it could have been good acting, but I don't think anyone is that good an actor. Seeing the band onstage in their suits, singing and playing their hearts out, the one emotion that came through clearly to me was Joy.

* I don't imagine the big record labels are much different today than they were in 1964, in the way they treat people.

* Liv Tyler's role as Faye could have been played up a bit more, but she made good use of the part. There was one point at which Faye becomes ill, and I expected there to be a hard choice to be made along the lines of ""if you stick by your girlfriend and get sick yourself, you risk your career."" The setup was there, but the script took a different direction. Tyler, however, did a rather good job for an 18-year-old. Oh, and yeah - she's totally cute in the part.

* The four main cast members have all been working steadily since TTYD!, but I don't think I've ever seen any of their other films. Sahara, in which Steve Zahn (guitarist Lenny) appears, is on my list of movies to see.

* One of the main reasons I wanted to see this film was for the music. I enjoy early-60s music, and got quite a good dose of it in the movie. That none (or very little) of it is authentic product of the 1960s is of little consequence to me. Good is good.

* I wonder if the cast might have thought they were being set up to be a retro version of The Monkees?

* The DVD is nearly devoid of extra features, though it does include music videos for the title song and a second Wonders song, Dance With Me Tonight. Both are quite enjoyable.

* The title song, had it been written and performed by an actual 1964 band, could indeed have propelled that band to stardom. It's catchy, memorable, and tight - not a wasted note.

I enjoyed That Thing You Do! quite a bit, and though it is not going to go down in film history as a classic, Tom Hanks nevertheless deserves credit for directing this little gem. I highly recommend this movie as an addition to your rental queue or DVD library.",1135641600,5,4785,4.309576837416481

858620,5,6304342462,"This movie has many parallels to those fab four in Liverpool:

-Jimmy is John Lennon in he is the talented, moody one who is more into creative expansion than touring and making more fans.

-Lenny is Paul McCartney, the one who didn't care about expanding their horizons, but enjoyed being a rock star and the fun that it involved. He also never took anything too seriously.

-Guy is Ringo Starr, the popular drummer who everyone liked and was the one no one ever had too much of a problem with.

-Ethan Embry is George Harrison, the quiet loner one who was probably the furthest remove from the group and ultimately left the band first (like George did with the Beatles).

-Fay (A very beautiful Liv Tyler) represents Jimmy's girl who in the end loses him to other women and his music (like what happen to Lennon's first wife while he was with the ""Beatles"")

-Tom Hanks is Mr. White, the cut to the chase manager. Unlike the Beatles manager Brian Epstein, Mr. White is never preceived as having a close friendship/relationship with the band, unlike Epstein, who with producer George Martin did have a close relationship with the ""Beatles"".

There are other parallels to the Beatles:

-There hit song is a sped up version of a slow ballad, much like the Beatles ""Please Please Me.""

-Jimmy throws up before their TV appearance, like George Harrison did before ""Ed Sullivan"".

-Their TV appearance on ""Hollywood Showcase"" is like the one the Beatles had on ""Ed Sullivan"", complete with the dress and the stage set up.

-They are hounded by girls after a show, like ""Hard Days Night"".

-The initial drummer is replaced, like the Beatles did when they replaced Pete Best with Ringo Starr.

-The ""careful girls he's engaged"" quote for Jimmy was similar to Lennon's ""Sorry girls he's married"" on ""Ed Sullivan"".

-They go into making movies, like the ""Beatles"" did.

-Jimmy and Fay break up, much like John Lennon did with his first wife while with the ""Beatles"".

-Guy befriends Fay after the breakup, like Paul McCartney did Mrs. Lennon.

The other parallels has to do with being a ""one hit wonder"", like so many bands in the past. Also the movie has funny (but truthful) representations of record managers and executives. It also shows why it's very hard for a band to last a long time. With hilarious representations of artists such as Diana Ross, Tom Jones, and Petula Clark, this movie is a light hearted comedy of the fast turnaround from hit makers to has beens.

Relationship problems and creative conflicts occur during the production of their second album. What happens to the Wonders? You'll just have to check out this movie and find out.

858627,3,6304342462,"That this is a charming, fun, all-ages film is obvious simply by listening to the title song, for which the film is named.  It is 1964 and 4 pals have joined together to form a band.  Thee band members are instantly recognisable as ""types,"" but the performances are so genuine and heartfelt that we forgive two-dimensionality.  The lead singer (the brooding genius) has written a catchy tune that allows the band to win a battle of the bands, which in turn lands them a gig at a diner, which in turn.... Well, you get the idea.  The song eventually ends up at #7 on the Billboard chart.  That is the beginning of the end for the Wonders, as they start to disintegrate as a band - the guitar player (the goofball) is content to enjoy the ride, the bass player (the straightlaced one) runs off to the Marine Corps, while the Brooder knows that the only way to develop is to get in the studio and cut an album of all original songs.

Holding the band together are the two central characters - Liv Tyler as the Brooder's girlfriend (and unofficial 5th member) and the drummer Guy.  Guy grew up destined to stay in his home town, inheriting the family business (selling appliances).  He sits in the basement at night with his beat-up drum kit and plays along with jazz records.  At one point, he asks a bellhop where he can find some ""good"" jazz, and when he passes a skill-testing question (""Who played cornet on so-and-so's album in 1956?"" Of course, Guy knows the answer), he is directed to a bar and ends up meeting one of his idols, a jazz pianist who is also in audience that night.

The great thing about the film is that it is straightforward and earnest.  There are no artificial obstacles set in the band's way - Guy's father lets him go on tour without a second thought because he knows his son will never be happy as an appliance salesman.  When the band starts its inevitable meltdown, it's because of the personalities of the band members being true to their personalities, not because some greedy executive is taking advantage of them, or some other external reason.  We can therefore relax, knowing the plot isn't going to artificially jerk us around.  We can laugh along at the antics on the screen and we're happy at the end, even knowing intellectually that we haven't grown as human beings in the process.  The film is not perfect - the title song is overplayed like a catchy advertising jingle and you get a little sick of it.  But because the rest of the film is so fun, we can forgive such small problems.

Comparisons with American Graffiti are inevitable.  Although they have different subjects, they both try to invoke the fun of a simpler time in the United States, that of the prosperous and morally simplistic 60's, before free love, anti-Vietnam protests, and race riots.  That Thing You Do! is sort of like American Graffiti lite, and it even includes a ""what happened to the main characters"" synopsis at the end.  It's a measure of the heart of the two films that the Bass Player becomes a marine and survives his tours of duty in Vietnam, whereas Terry in American Graffiti is killed in his tour.

Unfortunately, I've deducted a star for the poor level of extras on the DVD.  There are a couple music videos (besically full-length versions of the songs), a making of short (which is a shameless extended-trailer promotional bit), and that's about it.  Tom Hanks is an interesting guy, and this is his directorial debut - why isn't there a director's commentary?",1105833600,34,3489,4.591935483870968
858628,5,6304342462,"Tom Hanks wrote, directed, and stars in this 1964 era tale about a Pennsylvania garage rock -n- roll band hitting the big time.  The band consists of singer Jimmy (Johnathon Schaech) Guitarist Lenny (steve Zahn), Drummer Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) and the bass player who is never named (Ethan Embry).  They call themselves the Oneders but it becomes a running gag that people keep calling them the ""O-need-ers"" They write a little ballad called ""That Thing you Do"" but when they play it at a local talent show, drummer guy goes to fast and a ballad becomes a snappy, upbeat and danceable tune.  They become popular locally and cut a 45"" to sell at the clubs they play.

They soon are discovered by Mr. White, (Hanks) who is a record executive and manager and immediately changes the spelling of the band's name to ""The Wonders"" and gets them on a tour with a number of other acts from their record label.  The band eventually makes their national TV debut on a ""Ed Sullivan-like"" variety show.

The movie is intended to be sort of an American-ized Beatles with a group of four good looking lads, screaming teenage girls, and a rapid rise to fame.  The bandmembers all have their own unique ideas: lenny Just wants to get famous and loves life, Jimmy is the one who's overly serious about his music and always worried about compromising his beliefs, Guy at heart would rather be playing jazz.

Tom Hanks is really marvelous as manager Mr. White.  A quick-witted, fast talking, but honest guy who gets the Wonders gigs in 60's beach movies, and on the radio and TV.  hanks also did a great job as director in capturing the look and feel of the small pennsylvania town in 1964.  Guys father runs an appliance store and it is thoroughly detailed down to the big, stereo consoles and 60's era toasters.

The music of the film was also written by Hanks along with the great Howard Shore and is pure 60's.  If you didn't know any better you'd swear it was right out of 1964 rather than 1996.  it really captured the music of the times with its Beatles-like melodies.

I should also mention Liv Tyler as Jimmy's loyal girlfriend Faye who soon finds herself taking a backseat to Jimmy's music as well as adoring female fans.

We want Liv and Guy to get together, and their flirtations are full of sweetness and genuine warmth. While the inevitable dissolution of the band is a little bit of a downer, the image of young white Guy jamming with one of his soulful music heroes is the closing image that sticks with us, and that is secondary to the good times that stick with us even more.",1104796800,3,926,4.358381502890174

But pleasing our choir director who has no patience for anything that's not what he calls intelligent is a harder thing to do. We had That Thing You Do running five days straight in the choir room after our Winter Concert because EVERYONE loved that movie. We had our boys singing the song with their own choreography as we cleaned off the stage the next day. And we got passes to second period from our teacher, just so we could stay and watch this all the way through, every day.

This movie certainly isn't some awe-inspiring movie that's going to win an Accademy Award for being the most moving or anything like that. But it's a fun, catchy movie that will win the heart of anyone from ages 2 to 92. (And older!) Especially with such a WONDERful line as ""shame on me for kissing you with my eyes closed so tight"".

All I can say is sit back and relax and let the Wonders take you for a joy ride.

The station logo for WICU, references to Mercyhurst, Gannon, Koehler beer, foley art that included the Boston Store clock tower, the EMTA logo on the busses, WJET radio...all wonderful and nostalgic details that added to the films authenticity.  Also, the wry awareness that the characters had about how Erie is perceived by the rest of the country (especially by Lenny: ""Ya gotta be quick with me...I'm from Erie P.A."") was totally on.  Some locals grumbled because it was shot elsewhere, but Mr. Hanks still got the details right.

Written, directed, and starring Tom Hanks, 'That Thing You Do!' tells the charming story of a small town band hitting the big times. It starts with the find of a perfect drum player and ends in a wonder.
Guy Patterson is helping run the family appliance store, something he could live without doing, Jimmy is the lead singer to a newly started rock band with one problem: his band has its first gig and no drum player!
That's when Guy comes in, with his amazing fast drum playing skills, which turns the band's best song, ""That Thing You Do"", from good to great!!! They recieve a standing ovation and are asked to perform another gig! After making a single recording of ""That Thing You Do!"" on a record, they get a manager, who leads them to their new manager, Mr. White (Hanks).
After making the radio and hitting a state fair tour, the band fly to California where they are given a chance to perform live on TV!
As the worst would happen, something dramatic with Jimmy and his girlfriend, who is also their costume mistress, and the band break up. Giving the song ""That Thing You Do!"" a lable as a One-Hit Wonder.

858713,5,6304342462,"No matter what you hear, this is one really fun movie.  From the start with the frustrations of relationships within a neighborhood rock and roll band, to the development into a number one hit, this movie takes you on the ride from small Erie, PA across the country to Hollywood.
Hanks does a tremendous job bringing together some unknowns to develop a great idea.  This band, the Oneders - then the Wonders - goes through changes and the movie seems to be like the life of both the early Beatles and the Monkees combined.  There is a 60s quality to the movie that gives it a very pleasant charm.  Innocence is really shown in the movie, then characters develop and become a little more experienced in life.
The life of the bands working on a cross country trip as part of a record label as they track their meteoric rise to the top is especially interesting.
There is one scene in the movie that actually can give you the chills, you really get a kick out of the joy the band feels as Liv Tyler and friends run down a busy Erie street, probably State Street, screaming and yelling and jumping up and down when their new song has hit the airwaves for the first time.  If there was ever a scene showing immense joy, this is possibly it.
Well casted, well produced, the movie is a fun romp through the development of a Wonder.  The extras in the DVD are fun as well.  This is a must for families and is watchable for any age.",1079395200,5,1423,4.327067669172933
858714,5,6304342462,"Yes, on the surface, That Thing You Do! is somewhat of a feel good movie.  More than that however, it is a heartfelt ode to the garage band movement gaining momentum in the early 60s.  This is the story that typifies so many of those great bands.  The writers really did their research about the period, right down to the music made for the film.  This is truly one of Tom Hanks's best films, though it is oft ignored as it is not considered a ""drama.""",1074988800,3,452,4.22093023255814
858715,5,6304342462,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE!  As a child of the 60s and a musician, I loved this movie from the first few minutes of it.  The sets, the clothes, the music, and everything down to the small details is represented here to give a true feel for what the early to mid sixties were like, minus the politics and Vietnam.
Before radio music became a commercially diluted and corporate industry there were ""garage-bands"" galore and many of the little-remembered names of the genre started out as such.  The Wonders in ""That Thing You Do!"" could easily be a number of bands that were a one-hit-wonder (or two or three) and then just disappeared from the scene.  Nevertheless, they all helped shape some of the best music of that era, and Tom Hanks perfectly represents that phenomena in this movie.
If you remember the early 60's fondly, you should truly enjoy this film and it will probably bring back fond memories.  The depiction of Erie, PA during this timeframe is probably representative of many small to medium size American towns and certainly brought back great memories for me of better times gone by.
The music rocks, the dialogue is hip, and the love story rounds it out perfectly.
Buy this movie and then by the CD soundtrack; you won't be sorry!

For several weeks it seemed that whenever I sat down and started flipping around the channels, this was playing on VH-1.  After watching bits and pieces of it over this time period, I finally happened to tune in one night just as it was beginning.  It's a rare movie in that I was able to comfortably watch it with my two children, and even more rare that they asked me to play the cd when we were out and about in the racing mini van.  The two scenes that always get me are the scene where they play their first club date with Shades and he accidentally kicks the tempo of Jimmy's masterpiece up to it's correct level.  The actors did a great job of portraying a group coming to terms with the fact that they've indeed caught lightning in a bottle.  Another great scene is where they are first hearing the song on the radio.  Several times I've found myself joining in on their excitement and I have to remind myself that this is just a movie.  Well, it may be just a movie, but it's one that never seems to get old, and that has to be worth something.",1072742400,9,1122,4.259433962264151
858717,5,6304342462,"This is a delightful movie, probably unlike any you've ever seen. All the characters are so well balanced and adorable, and their story is so well told that it makes you feel it's a true story about real people. It's refreshing, sweet, entertaining and charming.
A group of friends puts together a music band and they record a song. The song gets on the radio and quickly climbs the music charts, making them an overnight success. Their unexpected and speedily growing fame puts their relationships, as well as individual integrity and self-respect, to the test. Troubles arise, and with them the characters show their true natures, good and bad, making their musical career as a rock group as brief and ephemeral as lightning.
But despite the obstacles the characters face, a few good things derive from them, new relationships are formed, old ones are strengthened, and all the characters make the choices that allow them to successfully follow their dreams after having lived through a life-changing, once-in-a-lifetime experience.
The score of the film is great and the songs are true to the style and the music of the sixties, which is the period in which the movie takes place. The clothing and sets are accurate and the characters are wonderfully adapted to the fads of the time. The writing, plot and dialogues are superbly well done (by Tom Hanks) and makes each and every character come alive, even those with just a few minutes of screen time. The cast is exquisitely chosen, including Tom Everett Scott, Liv Tyler and Tom Hanks, and their performances are natural and enjoyable.
This movie is a delight to watch time and again; each time you'll discover new details from the richly layered, yet realistic and simple personality of each character. A must-buy for anyone who likes a movie that tells a high-quality story through the eyes of interesting and refreshing characters.

858845,5,6304342462,"I first rented this movie not knowing what to expect.  I almost immediately bought my own copy.  This is the dream of every teenaged boy who grew up in the 60's and 70's:  Starting a garage band that rockets to superstardom.
Everybody knows the plot by now, so I will dwell on things such as Hanks' ability to write songs that captured quite well the flavor of many different groups from that era.  That whole environment of that time was well reproduced - right down to the Saturday morning kids' shows with puppets (""They're marionettes.  That's what they are."")
The casting was excellent for the characters.  (Though couldn't Hanks at least come up with a name for Ethan Embry's character other than merely ""the Bass Player?"")  Guy is totally likable, Faye is beautiful, Jimmy is interested only in Jimmy, and you need to watch the movie several times to catch all of Lenny's quips and jokes.
I do disagree with one reviewer's point, though.  The song, ""That Thing You Do,"" plays - if memory serves me - four times in the course of the movie.  When watching the movie once or twice, you will probably not get tired of it, but if you have an autistic son who watches the film over and over and over...well, it does get a little old after a while.

The songs are fun and awesome to listen to, the clothes are retro-hip and the colours are vivid, it makes you want to go back to the 60s and relive that era back. Despite its simplistic depth of a story, this movie brings out a few laughs, sadness and joy. I don't need another intriguing or stylistic film to watch. Just another retro-fun movie will do.

858848,5,6304342462,"Though it lacks drama and intellect, ""That Thing You Do!"" is perhaps one of Hanks' finest creations. The movie cronicles the rise and fall of a '60s pop band named the Wonders.
""That Thing You Do!"" is a movie that is apporpriate for a date, for a get-together and for a family night in. It conveys the message of an American dream, love, selfless service and of course, a painful shattered dream as well.
If you're looking for great drama, you're certainly not going to get it in this movie. But if you're looking to go back to a place and time when you were a child, when you experienced your first kiss, your first CD and finally holding the girl of your dreams in your arm, this movie is it.
Aside from the nostalgic aspect, it also presents great music and off-the-wall humor that will bring a smile to your face. It's certainly is a worthwhile movie. One I would recommend you even watch with your mother! Now, that's scary!",1066262400,,929,4.43859649122807

  but maybe the best scene is them running through the streets to congregate at the appliance store the first time their song gets played.  it's really fun and kind of moving, too.",1059955200,,1248,4.497777777777777
858851,5,6304342462,"Alas, the musical landscape is dotted with them:  obscure groups--each sporting unique, often bizarre names--that burst onto the scene with a red-hot hit before fading into Billboard memory.
THAT THING YOU DO! gives us the ambitious story of an eager garage band from 1964 Pennsylvania:  the enthusiastic One-ders (i.e. ""Wonders"").  Long on talent but short on savvy, the band relies on a rather copious ""school of hard knocks"" as it attempts to break through via its signature song, ""That Thing You Do!""  Subsequent misfires and setbacks are ultimately trumped by ""discovery""--by a wily, seasoned manager from a major record label, the smirking Mr. White (Tom Hanks).  Thus the ""Wonders"" travel to southern California and start the clock on their fifteen minutes of fame:  a whirlwind of events that takes the band from the pinnacle to the slush pile in a mere manner of hours, as the Wonders implode from their own immature naivete.
Tom Hanks is simply brilliant, both behind and in front of the camera.  The mostly unknown, ensemble cast--Tom Everett Scott, Liv Tyler (very well known now), Johnathon Schaech, Steve Zahn, Ethan Embry--fuels the story like a leg-twitching terrier looking for a fire hydrant.  This movie gets up and moves, both visually and audibly.  Funny, witty, compelling, profound, THAT THING YOU DO! tells the tale of a ""one-hit"" band and leaves you snapping your fingers to the beat before your DVD player concludes the closing credits.

Some of the best films have borrowed heavily, bordering on blatant rip-offs, of similar films. The bottom line is to do it well and please the audience. That's where this film succeeds.
Director Tom Hanks calls in a bunch of favors from his Hollywood cronies to tell a story about a one-hit-wonder band in early 60s America. At a time when the Beatles were taking the country by storm, the Wonders stumble into everything, including fame. With cameos by Hanks' buddies such as his former Boosom Buddies co-star Peter Scolari, Chris Isaak, Kevin Pollak, Clint Howard (Ron's brother) and Johnathan Demme, to name only a few, Hanks spins a wonderful tale that is utterly predictable and totally fulfilling.
Liv Tyler comes close to stealing the show as the lead singer's girlfriend who goes on the road with them. Her bouts of Beatlemania-esque screaming are sure to bring a smile to your face. It's easy to see how she would later go on to bigger and better things.

That said, what really impresses me about ""TTYD"" are the small touches. Director Tom Hanks has been quoted as saying that the songs by Adam Schlesinger (and score by Howard Shore) are original songs- that is, they were written for this film, but they were made, in tempo and arrangement, to *sound* like they came out of the 60's. That's amazing- especially when you re-listen to them. Also impressive are various bits of the day-glo color cinematography, art direction, set pieces (like the Play-Tone 'big record' stage), and even some of the co-stars in their cross country tour (the singer of ""Mr. Downtown"" paying an obvious tribute to Johnny Rivers, and the beautiful ""Chantrellines"" trio a spot-on amalgam of the Crystals, Shirelles, and the Supremes, right down to the coiffed wigs, dresses, hand-claps, and position of the microphones).

All actors gave equally fine performance.  This, I believe, is the result of good script, good direction, and good character definition, so that the actors had all that they needed to work on the roles.

The same qualities that drew me to him then, as a comedic actor, are on full display in his writing and directing in this film.  This is the kind of film I wish I had been an extra in.  It wreaks of fun and whimsy and has a sense of humor that few films match.  From Lenny's wisecracks, to Guy's family dynamics, the dialogue and characters ring true and familiar without being overdrawn or hammy.  The music is also very refreshing and upbeat and I enjoyed it immensely, even though I'm not a huge fan of that era of music.  The pacing is perfect.
There are some scenes that make me giddy everytime I watch them, kind of Capra-esce that way.  The one with Faye running down the sidewalk listening to the radio is one of unbridled joy.  The scene in Illinois when Hanks makes that arm gesture/thrust at just the right beat in the music is also cool, IMHO.
This is one of those movies that is extremely entertaining to watch and looks like it was even funner to make.  It reminded me of another ""musical"" I loved called ""Starstruck"" that Gillian Armstrong made in Australia.  They are two of my top 20 favs of all time, which is a select group.  Given the quality of this film I'd rather Hanks be a director than make bore-fests like Cast Away.

Hanks has shown for some time that he is the closest modern actor to the late, great Jimmy Stewart in the superb naturalness of his acting in every movie genre from comedies to drama. But with this film he shows himself also to be a talented writer and director as well. The movie chronicles the rise and dissolution of a 1960's rock band which writes and records a single top-ten hit. Personally I've always wondered why so many early rock groups were one-hit-wonders. If a band is good enough to make one hit record, why isn't it capable of making several -- or at least a few -- more? The answer presented in this movie is that the one-hit Wonders self detruct due to a combination of ego conflicts, the pressures of success, and just the vagaries of circumstance. This movie could have been a mildly entertaining quasi-documentary. Instead, as written and directed by Hanks and played by the talented young cast he assembled -- the most outstanding of whom is Tom Everett Scott and Liv Tyler (who recently played the beautiful elf Arwen in The Lord of the Rings) -- this is a fun film from beginning to end.

We don't see him for the first 20 minutes of the film, until the climactic moment when the camera slowly crawls up from behind him in a slow dolly.  When the star is finally revealed in all his glory, Mr Hollywood is cooler in his Ray-Ban shades.  The funniest thing about this is Tom Hanks is the narcissist behind the camera.

859093,3,6304342462,"I bought this movie for my husband on his birthday, because he loves it.  I thought it looked stupid, and didn't want to watch it...of course, I eventually did.  The story was boring (WAY too many performance scenes) and I couldn't STAND Johnathon Schaech and Tom Hanks' characters.  They were both total jerks.  There are a lot of wasted actors.  Needless to say, Tom Hanks is very talented - and so are MOST of the others - but that doesn't show here.  Tom Everett Scott is funny (see ""An American Werewolf in Paris"") and Ethan Embry and Giovanni Ribisi (who is ingenious in everything he does - from ""Wonder Years"" to ""Friends"" to ""The X-Files"" to ""The Mod Squad"") are adorable in their minor roles, but Liv Tyler is not a very good actress - in anything, let alone this.  The ONLY reason I'm giving this movie three stars is because of Steve Zahn.  He is hilarious in everything!  The sarcastic remarks he makes throughout the movie are absolutely fantastic.  I recommend this movie to people who appreciate sarcasm...or, to people who are very hard up for something to watch (like I was).",1009324800,,1093,4.616580310880829
859094,4,6304342462,"""Tom told us that 1964 was the last innocent year.""
-Tom Everett Scott, on his director's vision for ""That Thing You Do!""

Was it really that innocent? I dunno. After all, said director was all of eight at the time, and the movie definitely has that fuzzy-edged childhood nostalgia feel to it, sort of ""Almost Famous"" meets Frank Capra. (I have an especially hard time believing that the black concierges and jazz greats of the time took such a lively interest in geeky white pop drummers.)
But then again...My mom, that authentic 60's small-town teen Beatlemaniac, vouches absolutely for all the small details - and there are a lot of small details to vouch for, including a whole slew of psuedo-hit tunes from the era.
In the end I suspect that Roger Ebert says it best: ""Without hauling in a lot of deep meanings, it remembers with great warmth a time and a place.""
So it won't be entirely surprising to learn that this is a Tom ""Forrest Gump"" Hanks production all the way across the board. He directed it, he wrote it (including a surprising number of those pseudo-hits), he co-stars in it, he with great fanfare cast a 25-year-old lookalike in the lead role Hanks himself would have played at that age.
Lookalike Scott most certainly is: Imagine a slightly taller, lankier Tom, with  clear hazel eyes instead of quick dark ones, and you've got the idea. The face is the same, the mannerisms are the same...and more importantly, the nice-guy-slash-sane-center charm is the same. Hanks gets some great effects by playing his smooth Mr. White off this literal wide-eyed protege; looking at the two together it's easy to imagine the pitfalls awaiting the naiive 'Shades' on his way to the top. (Now, if only Hanks in real life coulda advised Scott against 'Dead Man on Campus'...)
Some of those pitfalls, of course, also involve his equally-brilliantly-cast bandmates. Steve Zahn (late of ""Happy, Texas"") just has a whole lot of fun as Lenny, the guitarist who's in this music thing mostly for the girls. The bass player may not have a name, but Ethan Embry still manages to stake out a small, shining comic niche of his own. Liv Tyler is...well...Liv Tyler; she gets a nice chemistry going with Scott - but unfortunately doesn't with her other romantic lead, Johnathon Schaech. He's very handsome and of course brooding, but the character feels woefully underwritten.
The movie as a whole feels a little that way, really. Instead of what was apparently a whole sequence of character moments (visible in the second 'music video' tacked on after the movie) Hanks finally decided to go for broad brushstrokes in chronicling the Wonders' rise to the top - the better, I guess, to give them a 'generic band' feel - and towards the end his film suffers for it in noticeably awkward plotting. The band doesn't break up so much as the movie decides to break them up. And while Faye undeniably gets the right bandmember in the end, Lamarr the concierge's 'Love Boat'-esque intervention in the process is wholly unnecessary.
But in the meantime...remember those details? There are lots and lots of finely observed small moments to cherish here: The way Jimmy first offers Guy the drumming gig, as though there's nothing in the world as Important as playing a crummy school talent show. Guy's dad observing, ""I don't think I want to live in a country where a man has to work on Sunday."" That genuinely magical first moment when they hear their song on the radio. The look on Guy's face when he's confronted with his hysterical fans. Rita Wilson's nicely underplayed cameo as a cocktail waitress. Even the way veterans Obba Babbatunde and Bill Cobb bail Hanks out by investing the aforementioned concierge and jazz great cliches with plausible humanity.
Yep, Ebert had it right. This is a movie to see simply because you're in the mood to be brightly and guilessly entertained; think ""Sleepless in Seattle"" or - more likely - ""Big"" and you're on the right track.",1008979200,2,3952,4.8017621145374445

Tom Hanks himself appears in a supporting role as the band's manager. The cast is great. Their characters come off as real people. Tom Everett Scott, who plays Guy, comes off in a very charming, appealing Tom Hanks-y way. He's a star to look forward too in the future. The music itself is superb.

859202,5,6304342462,"I saw this movie at the theater when it came out in the late summer of '96.  Maybe it was partly the company, but I found the movie enjoyable but not outstanding.  In other words, I was disappointed. Maybe I was jaded, having just recently turned 40.  Maybe it seemed silly to someone at that stage of life.
Then last winter, I caught just a bit of it on VH1, and it made me want to see it again.  I saw it recently at my local grocery store for ($) and picked it up.  Finally I had the chance to sit down and watch it in its entirety once again, and I cannot convey what an enjoyable experience it was!  It totally recaptured what, for me, was great about growing up in the '60s...that feeling that anything could happen, that your radio could explode with another classic any second, that, if you were a musician, you could be on the radio yourself if you got a band together and wrote a good song.  Well, I was just a kid then, but I believed.
This movie was obviously a labor of love for Tom Hanks - his attention to period detail is amazing.  He puts you right in the middle of the early summer of '64 in every way.  His soundtrack is just superb.  Rather than use actual songs from that time period, he creates, with help from other songwriters, his own pastiche of the sounds of '64, with splendid and amusing results.
The movie bounced off of me the first time I saw it...and I'm not quite sure why.  All the performances are sterling, and there is really so much to appreciate...the song (That Thing You Do) getting better and better as they gain popularity, the acquisition of 'professional instruments' as they go on tour; most of all, the pure joy that is conveyed the first time they hear their song on the radio.  That moment, that magic moment, is conveyed with incredible excitement.  You feel like you are inside the characters as they react to the giddy shock of hearing their song on the airwaves.
Like reality, the giddyness is bound to end and reality set in; hence the last third of the movie is a sober affair.  It was a letdown when I saw it the first time, but now it is a brilliant resolution and, really, very believable.  Here was a group with no foundation, no history, just a lucky happenstance.  It simply couldn't last.  The end was believable and, really, happy.
The performances and direction are subtle.  The movie gets better with each subsequent viewing.  For me, who rarely rewatches a movie, that is high praise, indeed.",994636800,4,2459,4.412416851441241

It has fun likeable characters from the father who runs the appliance store, to the band members and even the waitress in the bar later in the film.  I don't think the story would have been less fun if you focused on anyone in the film. It is a story that likes people in the style of the old Capra films. There are so many nice bits like the running gags about the store lights and the name of the band.  But the things that make you fall in love with the film are joyful touches like the first time the band's song is heard on the radio.  You can't help but feel happy right along with them.

The catchy tune of the same title plays like a classic.  Along with the movie, check out the soundtrack and liner notes. (written by none other than Mr. A.M. White of Playtone records!)  Interesting tidbits of information again form a very solid back story to this charming and funny movie.
Things like musicians last names come from Hanks' other favorite subject.. The space program. Starting with Wonders' members Lenny Haise & James Mattingly (they share last names with famous astronauts.. Fred Haise was part of the doomed Apollo 13 mission)
The theme song to ""Mr. Downtown"", a show about the exploits of one police sergeant named ""Shakes"" Lovell (probably named after Apollo 13 commander James Lovell) and the song ""Voyage Around the Moon"", a Ventures-ish surf rocker performed by the Saturn 5's, for a mulit-stage rocket used in the space program.
Hanks' gives impressive direction to a great cast.  (Steve Zahn who plays Lenny just cracks me up every time)  Every one did not only act very well in this movie, but made you really believe they could play. Tom Everett Scott who plays Guy Patterson, can play some mean drums!

859210,5,6304342462,"You're not likely to find a more sweet, affectionately drawn portrait of a time and era than this film. The last great one before this was ""American Graffiti."" Tom Hanks takes a very easy-going hand with the direction of this excellent movie, which is one of the film's strong points. It moves at a fast, yet leisurely pace and has a good story to tell about one of the millions of one hit wonder band that crop up, have a hit or two, and then just when they are about to become the hugest group in the world, disappear into oblivion. The group in this movie, therefore is, aptly called the ""Wonders."" (The original spelling of their name, the ""One-ders"" has to be changed because people kept pronouncing it ""Oh needers"".) This movie is a very light, fun musical comedy/drama with a bouncy, authentic-sounding score, highlighted by the excellent title number and some other faux-60s pop hits, and delightful performances from an exuberant cast. Hanks even has a small part as their manager, in a very downplayed, tasteful performance.  This movie is wise to never take itself or its plot too seriously, acknowledging throughout, even during the breakup, that the ""Wonders"" was really a whim more than anything else throughout their shortlived history. Many clever set pieces compare the ""Wonders"" to parts of Beatle history, the difference being that the Beatles had more than one or two hit singles. All in all, this movie is a fun, vibrantly colorful look at the 60s music industry, that gently and subtly parodies the era while celebrating it simulaneously. P.S. Look for a fabulous cameo by Rita Wilson, Hanks' real-life wife as a cocktail waitress.",988156800,3,1653,4.861702127659575
859317,4,6304342462,"Tom Hanks wrote and directed this paean to the glory days of rock n' roll, an era in which even the wildest music still reflected a certain innocence, long since gone if not forgotten, before the advent of Metal, Rap and Grunge.  It's 1964, and ""That Thing You Do!"" is about to become a hit record for a small band out of Erie, Pa., who call themselves the ""Oneders (pronounced Wonders),"" but who are destined to begin their musical odyssey know as the ""Oh-NEED-ers.""  Drummer Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) works in his father's appliance store, but when the band's drummer breaks his arm right before a gig, Guy is asked to sit in for him.  And it winds up being a case of being in the right place at the right time for Guy, like when Ringo joined The Beatles, and the rest-- as they say-- is history.
 It's a lively, upbeat tale in which luck, talent and chance all play a part.  Hanks presents the upside of making it in the music business, including the adrenaline rush of hearing one's own song on the radio for the first time, as well as all the hoopla that surrounds those who happen to be in the spotlight at the moment.  But he also shows the downside:  The creative differences and in-fighting which plagues just about any band ever formed to some degree at one time or another, the personality conflicts and petty jealousies that are apt to surface at any time, and the reality of dealing with bloated egos, adoring fans and rude, insensitive record label executives who could care less about the talent that is putting the coins in their coffers, as long as they're selling records.
 For the most part, Hanks keeps it lighthearted and cheerful, which-- along with the original songs (some of which he helped write)-- makes this an entertaining, fun and thoroughly enjoyable movie.  He sugar-coats the dark side of it all to a certain extent, which makes the bad things that happen a bit easier to swallow, though it compromises the impact of the events somewhat as they unfold.  Then again, he manages to maintain the credibility and integrity of his story, and after all, ""this"" is the film he wanted to make, and he presents it exactly as intended.  Hanks captures a sense of time and place with this film, and also that same sense of reality conveyed by The Beatles' film, ""A Hard Day's Night,"" intentionally avoiding the more stoic reality of the more recent ""Almost Famous.""  All three films are fairly true to life, but with varying degrees of honesty.  It's a matter of whether to ""imply,"" as Hanks has done, or to be explicit, as Cameron Crowe chose to do with his film.
 With this film Hanks proves that he is equally as adept behind the camera as he is in front of it; he knows exactly where he wants to take his audience and when, and he does it quite successfully.  He also extracts some nice performances from his actors, especially Scott, Johnathon Schaech (Jimmy, the lead singer), Steve Zahn (Lenny, on guitar) and Liv Tyler as Faye Dolan, Jimmy's girlfriend, who takes the brunt of the blunt edge of Jimmy's sudden notoriety.  Hanks also turns in a notable performance himself, as Mr. White, the representative of one of the labels interested in the Oneders.
 The supporting cast includes Ethan Embry (The Bass Player), Charlize Theron (Tina), Obba Babatunde (Lamarr), Giovanni Ribisi (Chad), Chris Ellis (Phil), Alex Rocco (Sol), Bill Cobbs (Del Paxton), Peter Scolari (Tony), Rita Wilson (Marguerite), Chris Isaak (Uncle Bob) and Kevin Pollak (Boss Koss).  What ""Happy Days"" was to television, ""That Thing You Do!"" is to movies; a film that evokes that perceived sense of  innocence of a time when life at least seemed simpler.  For the more distance you put between the present and the ""Good old days,"" the better they get.  In reality, they may not have been better, but Hanks preserves that illusion by giving us a picture of the way we'd at least like to think things were.  And it's more than a pleasant diversion; this is a feel-good film you'll be able to enjoy time and again, because it takes you to a place you'd like to be-- a place you've been to before at one time or another, in one way or another, if only in your mind.  And that Hanks can take you there so readily is not only a credit to his talent, but another fine example of the pure magic of the movies.",987897600,4,4309,4.589308996088657

Well, realize, that in my estimation, what makes a film great is how close it comes to fulfilling its purpose and that that purpose be of benefit to the viewer. That Thing You Do comes close to perfection on both counts, even though it is no Schindler's List.
And who wants every movie to be a 'Schindler's List'? We need a That Thing You Do almost as much, and I commend and admire Hanks for making his debut directorial effort not a Braveheart or Dances With Wolves. Whether he felt the pressure to be profound or not, Hanks' diverges to the road less travelled by actors-turning-directors/actors. He wants us to have fun. And not mindless 'Weekend At Bernies' fun, but ""look at the charm of this era and its music"" fun.
While none of its departments probably got nominated (or even should have been) for Oscars, each aspect, from art direction to make-up to costumes, flows together under Hanks' vision well to sweep us up into the exuberance of a dream coming true (wonderfully personified in the scene where the band hears their song on the radio for the first time). The cast is particularly well assembled (Tom Everett Scott pulling somewhat of an O'Donnell in that he still hasn't, for me, lived up to the promise he showed here) with now notables Steve Zahn (Out of Sight) and Giovanni Ribisi (Saving Private Ryan) establishing their now familiar funny and eclectic (respectively) styles.
If you like oldies and get a bit nostalgic for the era of the 50's and 60's, That Thing You Do should be on your list of 'Thing's to do. The odd thing is that the soundtrack showcases exclusively original tunes. Have you ever seen a movie about this era that doesn't grab as many of the popular oldies as they can for its soundtrack? What's really amazing is that almost all of them sound like hits!",977788800,,1946,4.578796561604585
859324,4,6304342462,"While some people may not get into how predictable or unbelievable this film is it nevertheless tells a very true story which was all too common in the early 1960's and which still holds true today. The film follows the story of the One-ders (Wonders after a smart re-christening) who started as a small Erie, PA garage band and experienced a meteoric rise to fame in the innocence of early 60's pop music. The film, while corny in some parts, tells a very poignant story with a refreshing mixture of humour and drama. The band's reaction to the swirling events around them make for a great storyline and an effective lessons-learned presentation of the real world of pop music; everything from marketing and promotion to relationships among band members.
Fame can be a wonderful yet damaging experience and this film effectively demonstrated that. Not to mention very funny and lively. A great film.",971395200,,900,4.888888888888889

Set in Eerie, PA, in the 1960's, a small garage-band hits it big time when their single ""That Thing You Do!"" makes the charts! Unfortunately, fame and  fortune tear the group apart, in a wonderful show of hopes, dreams, and  fate. Filled with nostalgic detail, this movie will make you laugh, smile,  and maybe even shed a tear. Tom Hanks, thank you for this amazingly  well-done movie.",963705600,,437,4.636363636363637

I love how Tom Hanks was aprehensive that this movie wasn't going to be accepted. He obviously knew that it wasn't going to be a huge blockbuster (a la Waterworld) (just kidding). But he knew that his loyals would love it and Im sure he knew that it had enough one-liners in it that people for years to come would be quoting them (Im so happy! Thanks for coming! )
You cant go wrong if you love movies with interesting plot lines and tons of zingers.
I hope that you enjoy it and you have a smile thoughout the whole movie. I hope it makes you forget your troubles",949968000,,706,4.237037037037037
