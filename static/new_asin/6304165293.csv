7863556,2,6304165293,I love the Eyewitness books but this video is disappointing.  The presentation is poorly organized and there's a low-budget feel to some of it.  I learned a few things from watching it but I definitely don't recommend purchase (I borrowed a copy from my library).,1134691200,,263,4.822222222222222
7863557,5,6304165293,"Eyewitness Seashore is a pleasure to experience, especially for ocean lovers. This video is a documentary on the intertidal zones of the sea, that divides the ocean from land. Directed well by a person with expertise, and narrated by Martin Sheen.
  In these ocean photographs, we view : Pipefish, urchins, anemones, sea slugs, and many other ocean marvels. This film contains suitable amounts of underwater footage, with a small camera inserted for the tidepool filming. Another scene worth mentioning is a white sea slug devouring a venemous tidepool anemone. We also take a look at some of the creatures that take refuge in shipwrecks, including: Lobsters, rockfish, snailfish, and many crustaceans. The ending is also given much thought.
  There is also some history backing the seashore, from lighthouses to greek myths, to the very purposes of the sea and its theories. The genuine Portunus Crab seen throughout the entire film also may grab people's attention. Definetely worth buying for the price. Enjoy it with other ocean films.",1089072000,2,1039,5.203592814371257
