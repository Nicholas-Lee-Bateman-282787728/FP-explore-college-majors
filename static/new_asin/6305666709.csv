1060515,4,6305666709,"Being a huge Barry Gifford fan, having enjoyed De La Iglesia's Day of the Beast, and of the opinion that Wild at Heart was one of the best novel to film adaptations in the history of cinema, needless to say, my expectations for this movie were very high. I couldn't have imagined it being so  satisfying.
De La Iglesia's adaptation of Perdita Durango takes its  liberties but (like Wild At Heart) finds its inspiration in the original  source material without destroying the spirit.
Romeo and Perdita carve  thier way through the world with violence, magic, and sex. They are  sadistic, perverse, and perfect for each other. From thier first fateful  meeting, it is a dark destiny, a collision of two black souls. If the movie  has any message, it is that even the most wicked person has a diabolic  soulmate. Love does not discriminate.
The preformances are great. Javier  Bardem as Romeo was totally unrecognizable as the same guy who played the  stud in Jamon, Jamon. He plays Romeo as charming, self preserving, and  almost noble killer because his beliefs are in darkness, sacrifice, revenge,  and amoral spirituality. My fears of Rosie Perez, an actress I am not fond of  in any way, were unfounded as she embodied Perdita perfectly with sadism and  sizzle. James Gandolfini, as the Wile E Coyote like DEA agent Dumas, was  also very good, perpetually abused and doggedly determined.
De La  Iglesia handles with the film great skill. The pacing is fast and furious.  Every scene is alive with energy, and his compostion is masterful. He has  vastly improved from the flawed, yet entertaining, Day of the Beast, and  demonstrates that his is a talent that continues to grow. Given the proper  material and time, I can see him providing a enjoyable body of manic,  surreal, and outrageous work.",949190400,30,1798,4.848684210526316
1060516,4,6305666709,"This movie rocks. It seems it is being marketed as some direct to video cheapie. But wait... Violence , sex, drugs, car accidents, human sacrifice, cannibalism, and James Gandolfini. The script is great. The direction is  sharp, superhip and intelligent. Alex de la Iglesia has been called the  director of generation in Spain. His other two flims (Accion Mutante and  The Day of the Beast) have been hits all over the world except in the U.S.  He has won many awards at film festivals worldwide. The acting in the film  is top notch. Pacing is relentless and some of the action sequences are  breathtaking. So once again don't be fooled by bad american marketing. This  film gives any Tarantino or Rodriguez flick a run for its money. The  Europeans know how to make action and horror. Don't forget to check out The  Day of the Beast, de la Iglesia is definitely a filmmaker on his way up.",948499200,23,890,4.617834394904459

1060667,5,6305666709,"I don't understand the bad reviews, but some seem to blame the particular DVD version.  For the record, my version is not the one pictured here, but the In2Film Region 2 DVD, which plays great on my region free player even without changing the region.  For those claiming the very story is sick, it is based on a novel, which must in turn have been based on a real life Santeria-practicing mass murderer based out of Matamoros, Mexico in the late 1980's, Adolfo Constanzo.  Reading about Constanzo's life, and his hooking up with a female companion (eventually not sexually -- he preferred men) to help him lure in victims, he ran his drug trade by persuading his followers that his magic obtained through ritual killings gave them immunity from harm.  So the real story is definitely grim, but this verion is mercifully much less so, although it has graphic violence and other brutality, including a rape scene.

The cast is up to the task -- Bardem is perfect as a charming but psychotic criminal, and Rosie Perez's Perdita character is the fitting street tough girl to meet up with him.  Gandolfini is great as a misfortune-prone DEA agent tracking Romeo (Bardem), and Screaming Jay Hawkins himself plays a wonderful role as an addled sidekick/bodyguard to Romeo.  Iglesia infuses the film with just enough bits of irony and humor to make it tolerable.  The version I watched has Romeo seeing himself in a role in the film ""Vera Cruz"" at the end and has quite enough sex and violence, so I suppose it is the uncut version.  Regardless of the version, I was entertained despite the gruesome subject.  I found this movie less disturbing than ""No Country For Old Men"" (which of course Bardem starred in) because that movie is so relentlessly downbeat and grim.  Not a perfect movie, but one I would rate as a minor classic, certainly worth seeing for the four actors mentioned above.",1392163200,,1883,4.745398773006135
1060668,1,6305666709,"This picture is a complete waste, considering it had nothing to offer, even the perversion in the film becomes trite and tiring, by the end, I had hoped that all the characters would wind up dead because they are uninteresting. The director thinks that he is being morally ambiguous by presenting Bardem as a villain who rapes and plunders all form of human decency but actually he is being silly. The film never knows if it is being a slasher film or a comedy, but by the end, who really cares as long as this disaster is over?....",1386633600,,532,4.438775510204081

1060671,3,6305666709,"This is the perfect spin-off from David Lynch's WILD AT HEART. The director has taken the character PERDITA DURANGO, who was played by Isabelle Rosselini from WILD AT HEART, and fashioned an extremely lurid pulp-fiction narrative of blood and gore, voodism, explicit rapes and all soughts of violence by the two deranged latino characters played with explosive fireworks by Rosie Perez and Javier Bardem. For the faint-of-heart this film can be dangerous for the weak-minded. Be warn this film is not for the squeamish. The violent journey of this film is the perfect template one expects from pulp-fiction. At times it's so over-the-top it resembles an R rated hardcore Road Runner episode.",1315872000,,691,5.178571428571429

1060673,5,6305666709,"A quick comment: it is true that the R and Unrated versions are the same, but not because they are both unrated, but because they are both R. For the real unrated version, you have to track down a European disk (which likely gives a duration several minutes longer than the US 121 minutes). A few minutes might not seem like a significant difference, but this film really is a pulp masterpiece and excising its more provocative moments attacks the very heart of what makes it a pulp masterpiece. Is there a responsible company out there that can rescue this film?",1292630400,4,563,4.584158415841584
1060732,1,6305666709,This movie was ridiculously overpriced.  The acting is horrible; the plot is nonexistent.  The DVD didn't even have so much as a commentary track. I guess I learned my lesson--never give Rosie Perez a second chance.,1234828800,,215,4.944444444444445

1060735,5,6305666709,"Dance with the Devil starring Rosie Perez and Javier Bardem are brilliant in their roles as Perdita and Romero. A crazy, psychotic couple who kidnap a teenage couple and rape them.
Perdita and Romero are equally insane and equally unpredictable. These two are capable of doing anything and nothing is off limits with these two.
Perdita is a very tough, street smart sexy woman, who you don't want to mess with. Perdita is just as tough as any man. Rosie Perez was absolutely brilliant as Perdita.
The movie is done in English and Spanish, but you won't need subtitles throughout the whole movie. The Spanish is just a couple sentences or conversations but not much. The movie is well worth the watch even if you can't speak Spanish.
The movie has some sex and rapes scenes and a few bloody gore scenes.

This is not for children since it can be graphic, bloody at times with partial nudity and sex.

The story moves along well and is well directed.  If you like suspense and action this one will deliver.

1060739,3,6305666709,"being a fan of the collaborative works of barry gifford and david lynch, i definitely came to this movie with certain expectations.  i'm sorry to report that this movie was, for the most part, a disappointment.  few hold up to the genius of lynch, so i realized early on that i had to let that idea go and just deal with the movie in it's own terms.

there were definitely elements that i liked.  for one, i enjoyed the exploration of the dynamic between perdita and romeo and their captives.  it was interesting to watch them get inside the kids' heads and completely tear them apart.  i'd be interested in finding out what happened to them after everything was all over!!

visually, the movie was amazing.  romeo is a villain that will accompany me in more than a few nightmares in the weeks to come.  this movie definitely had the bonnie and clyde / mickey and mallory thing going for it as well, and who doesn't love a star-crossed love tale, right?

anyway, there were areas that severely lacked.  the characters were caricatures, the plot was cliche, and the score undermined the movie.  the things the people would say would make me cringe at how trite and ridiculous they sounded.  everything always worked out a little too conveniently, even for a traditional action movie.  gandolfini's hardened cop with the dry sense of humor, santos's hammy gangster, and romeo's studly sorcerer are a few glaring examples.

i'd recommend watching this movie if you come across it, but don't make any special effort.  this is one where you're gonna want to stick to the book, perdita durango.  better yet, read it along with wild at heart and the wild life of sailor and lula, and you'll find yourself in a world where perdita slithers through the story like romeo's snake skin boots.",1132876800,3,1780,4.690322580645161
1060740,1,6305666709,"This is the worst Bardem-Perez movie that I have seen. If the director De la Iglesia has some Tarantino influence, he went too far.

1060831,4,6305666709,"this movie-containing explicit sex scenes, and sick violence-is at times entertaining as well as quite hollow at some point. however this may be forgiven, due to the outstanding performances by Javier Bardem, who plays the main character Romeo Dolorosa, a satanworshipping, killing psychopath, and Rosie Perez, who is in the movie(as i would take it) his second half Perdita Durango, also pretty sickminded. Together they take it to the road to finally pick up a young couple. Their purpose is it, to sacrifice them to this weird gods or whatever Romeo believes in. But the ceremony is interrupted. Bad luck for Romeo and Perdita. With the couple in the back they start their way to Las Vegas, where Romeo has got some deals. But as those kind of roadmovies are, everything goes wrong. That's quite it with the story!!! however there are these few sequences in this movie that are just of sheer brilliance like these weird flashbacks, shortly-cut scenes that are being seen as Romeo or Perdita are telling stories of their past or so. Pretty sick though is the rough violence, shown in the movie!! But in this film it's simply a neccessity!! well, that's it so far!!! If you like Tarantino or Lynch, or you are even into splatter, go and watch it; if you've got the nerves, it's great fun!!

1060832,4,6305666709,"Upping the bizarro quotient from David Lynch's Wild at Heart, comes Alex De La Iglesia's Dance with the Devil (aka Perdita Durango -- i like that title much better), a wild ride of a film that features a pre-Before Night Falls Javier Bardem gleefully chewing up the scenery as Romeo, a witch doctor/mercenary enlisted to hijack a truckload of foetuses and bring it to Las Vegas. Casting against type is Rosie Perez as the title character, Perdita, who is as wild and crazy as Romeo. Along the way they kidnap a couple of white bread kids and stay ahead of the law, represented by a pre-Sopranos James Gandolfini in a hilarious turn as really unlucky lawman who keeps getting run over by speeding vehicles, and Repo Man director, Alex Cox as his dimwitted partner.
This is funny, violent, warped cult film oddity that features an awesome cast (also including Screamin' Jay Hawkins) and an equally impressive soundtrack (with not one but two rockin' tunes by Southern Culture on the Skids). Think of this as Natural Born Killers without all the political stuff or Wild at Heart on bad acid.
Certainly not a film for everyone but if you like your action movies fast 'n' furious with a good dose of weirdness on top, then check this bad boy out.",1049414400,11,1241,4.671232876712328

The next scene will make you giggle.  The director moves you from one emotion to the other often with no purpose rather than just shock value, but it works well!
Aside from the theme that can (and has) been done many times, the acting made this movie.  It was the acting that held me through the difficult parts.  As a collector of cult-type movies this one will be added to my collection.

His job  is made easier by the star turns of Rosie Perez and Javier Bardem (last  seen in Pedro Almodovar's Live Flesh, he completely transforms himself in  his present role).

7893124,3,6305666709,"Dance With the Devil (or, Perdita Durango) is for the viewer who normally goes for Hollywood action movies, yet favors more violence and grotesque visuals. This pulp-ish movie delivers cheap thrills over solid acting and a clever, unique story. Some have compared this with the movies of Tarantino, yet unlike Tarantino, the violence isn't as rampant, gratuitous, or gimmicky for the sake of drawing in viewers. A lack of gripping storytelling, credible characters, and credible acting often had me on the verge of losing my interest. Rosie Perez is charming as the lawless Perdita, but she's not badass enough. Her character deliberately engages in criminal activity to get her adrenaline fix, but Perez lacks the psychotic streak that would have made her character fully convincing and compelling to watch. Javier Bardem as Romeo Dolorosa rarely comes close to delivering his role with conviction. He portrays a drug dealer posing as a Santeria priest, but half of the time it seems as if he's reciting lines for a rehearsal while trying not to laugh at the absurdities of his character. Bardem's character may not hold your attention, but his chain of hideously bad wigs will. The worst acting honors go to the two blond teenagers portraying Romeo and Perdita's captives. Sadly, it seems as though the only way they could have competently conveyed their fear to viewers is if they had been put through actual torture. The extended amount of screen time the director allows them is an absolute embarrassment. They sap the picture, reducing their scenes to stereotypical dummies-in-distress scenarios. If you're not put off by a few morbid shots or some graphic violence, chances are, you'll find it satisfying enough.
