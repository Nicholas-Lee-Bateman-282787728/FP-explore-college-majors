8358520,5,B001IDZGTS,"An impactful and insightful look into the L.A. Riots during 1992.  The documentary probes what led up to the riots (1991 - Rodney King and Latasha Harlins) and dives deep into multiple cultures living and working around South L.A.  Wet Sand takes a look at the race relations among several cultures (Koreans, African Americans, Latinos) and does not take one particular culture's point of view as the ""correct"" view.  The documentary explores all points of view, with multiple interviews and documentation, including how the media made the race relationships far worse by sensationalist reporting.  Personally, I was in high school in 1992 and living in the Midwest.  I remember the riots well (via the media, of course), but I had no idea WHY the riots happened WHERE they did, or WHY the riots impacted particular cultures and cultural areas.  This documentary does a clear, concise job dissecting the reasons and provides an excellent overview of the sadness that took the city by flames.  Additionally, viewing the movie at this time (nearly 25 years after the 1992 L.A. Riots) seems important with the current unstable race relations bubbling throughout the nation.  Although this movie questions the actions and relationships from over two decades ago, the message is pertinent today.  Why are there races opposing each other?  Do certain cultures and races receive preferential treatment by either the common public and/or government officials (yes, they do) - and WHY?",1469145600,2,1476,5.189873417721519
