8143888,5,B000I40W4C,I loved watching this movie. The boy in this movie was an entrepreneur. He made his own fertilizer out of organic materials. The nosy neighbor in this movie kind of reminded me of the same nosy neighbor on that TV show Bewitched. Anyway the boy learns lessons like balancing priorities such as school work and developing himself as a self-made businessman. The story has a good ending. This is one of the few movies that I would recommend.,1321401600,3,439,4.641025641025641
8143889,5,B000I40W4C,"Our entire family loves feature films for families movies, and almost always watch together during the week for family movie night.

However, this one I watched by myself when my hubby and sons were at a boys youth/activity night.

I loved it!

The story is heartwarming it's about a widowed mother and son that struggle to make it. The son is fluent in English and mostly his mom is too accept she can't read English and that really limits the type of work she can do. Their neighbors are horrible racist people the wife is constantly making up stories about them and trying to get them into big trouble the husband breaks the law to earn an income. The best part of this movie is the bond between the mother and son. There's even a sweet love story line for the mom in this movie.",1264982400,3,782,4.379310344827586
