892519,2,6304493029,"I used to be a huge Art of Fighting fan.  I remember buying Fatal Fury 3 on the sole purpose of playing as Ryo.  Of course I could neveer get the code to work, so I bought the Art of Fighting game which was pretty bad, but I liked it because it had Ryo.  I then found out that there was an Art of Fighting movie.  I looked through every store in the mall to find it and no store carried it.  I eventually bought the Fatal Fury movies as substitutes for the one I really wanted.  Well I found Art of Fighting here, got it, and was none too pleased with it.  Art of Fighting isn't a bad movie, but it isn't a good one either.  Compared to movies like Fatal Fury and Akira, Art of Fighting's animation is the pits.  It reminded me of those 70's cartoons where the only thing that moves is the character's mouth.  The story is pretty cheesy and left me wondering if these guys had actually ever seen the game.  But the movie does have some decent lines and the song at the end is all right.  My advice would be to get the Fatal Fury movies and any other movie you want first and get this one last, and that is only if you are an Art of Fighting Fanatic otherwise pass it up!!",999475200,,1171,4.0

And ""Art of Fighting"" has got to be the ugliest of them all.  Whoever created this took a respectable fighting game franchise and turned it rear-side up.  There isn't a single thing about this mini-flick (originally a TV special in Japan a few years back) that I can justify being worth even a rental.  The story?  The story in the GAME was deeper.  A young damsel gets kidnapped by gangsters and her karate student brother and his friend go to rescue her.  A few lame fights ensue.  That's it.  The animation?  Sure, if you can call it that.  It's choppier than the North Shore.  The art on the box is about as good as it gets.  The fight scenes are horrible; I could tell no thought at all went into the most important part of an anime like this.  Even the soundtrack is a joke; none of it actually fits the mood the film tries to set, which I couldn't figure out either.  And don't even start me on the dubbing.  I'd say you'd have to see for yourself just how bad this flick is, but you'd be wasting nearly an hour of your life by doing so.  Stay away.  Stay FAR away.",992822400,,1215,4.181818181818182
892521,1,6304493029,"I'll be honest I played the video game a long time ago and when I played it I didn't read the story or pay too much attention to it, I just wanted to play the game.  Therefore, I think this is something to keep in mind  when reading my review.  I artwork was okay, the fight scenes were very  nice; however the plot, the voice acting in the dub and story didn't do  anything for me.",957657600,,382,3.973684210526316
7873206,5,6304493029,"Art Of Fighting is a silly and fun little anime film based on the video game of the same name. In the movie, Ryo and his friend Robert accidentally become involved in a crime scene. They wind up having to save their friend Yuri from a gang of criminals that plan to take off with her and a jewel.

This movie is fun, silly, lighthearted, and action packed. The English version features the voices of Veronica Taylor and Eric Stuart from Pokemon. I recommend it to people that wanna see a fun Saturday Morning cartoon style anime.",1517270400,,529,4.453608247422681

Video game to anime, especially fighting based has never really been anything above average. Usually, these types of movies will mostly appeal to fans of the franchise and give nothing to the non fans But could it actually be possible to create a video game to anime that appeals to absolutely no one? Well, after watching Art of Fighting, the answer is yes. Surprisingly, it does have a cult following but only for mocking reasons. However, I wouldn't recommend it even for that. I've seen my fair share of train wrecks, and I can say without any doubt that Art of Fighting is the worst anime I have ever seen.

Directed by Hiroshi Fukutomi, Art of Fighting is based on the Neo Geo fighting game of the same name. It was one of the arcade fighters competing with Street Fighter II for arcade supremacy, and with the exception of the anime featuring the characters of the game. The movie has absolutely nothing to do with the game at all.

When watching an anime based on a video game. I don't think it's very important to follow the source material to the very last detail. Especially, when the video game doesn't have a great story to begin with; but there's one key element that should never be neglected and it's characterization. In regards to fighting games, there will always be a character with at least a handful of fans. Therefore, fans will be looking for someone specific.

I have to beat on the characterization. The two heroes come off as total dimwits, and I couldn't find a single reason to care about them. They had no charisma, they weren't funny, there was nothing cool about them at all. There also isn't a single interesting villain either. Everyone is completely one dimensional, very corny, and just plain boring.

When these types of movies are released, fans want to see their favorite characters going at it with special moves included. Something Street Fighter II, Mortal Kombat, and even Fatal Fury 2 did a pretty good job at. Art of Fighting doesn't even deliver there. The battles are completely unimaginative with the poorest choreography I have seen in an anime since Voogies Angel, and the characters don't pull off any of their special moves, which is a no-no on the highest level. That's like watching a XXX porno with no sex.

I doubt anyone is expecting high art when coming into a martial arts anime, especially when it's based on a game; but the plot really doesn't have anything going for it besides a few non entertaining fights with incredibly bad dialogue to boot, and I'm almost lost for words when trying to describe the horrendous production values. Art of Fighting isn't even good to look at. The animation is choppy and very poor on its delivery. The artwork and character designs are also just as bad despite the characters being somewhat faithful to their video game counterparts. Except for Ryo, whom for some reason is sporting black hair instead of blond. Fatal Fury which is also a Neo Geo release turned anime makes a similar mistake, yet it's nowhere near as awful as this on any level.

The soundtrack is non engaging and uninspiring with bad voice acting to top it off. The movie is seriously bad on every level one can think of and good grief that ending. Ryo uses a diving board to leap about 30 feet into the air in order to pursue an escaping helicopter, which explodes for a reason I still haven't caught.

Art of Fighting accomplished the impossible by doing everything wrong. Unlike other really bad anime titles that could have been a lot worse; Art of Fighting really couldn't be any worst. I do not recommend this to anyone. I still do not think I'm qualified to put together a top 10 best or worst list, because there's still more things I need to see, but I'm definitely sure this will still be sitting comfortably at number 1 on the worst, since its still been there after 11 years.

Whenever I get through a very bad anime I always say to myself, ""well it's not Art of Fighting"". This golden turkey is a 46 minute long waste of time. Give this a try if you love to waste money and time, or love to search for some type of enjoyment in very bad movies. Me, I'll just try to forget its very existence but the alcohol has been failing.

Pros: What kind of animal is that?

Cons: They are in very large supply here.",1427587200,,4713,4.564497041420118

7873212,3,6304493029,"First I want to say sorry to all Art Of Fighting fans out there, I've never played the games, I just enjoy the movie for what it is.

The plot is about two Martial Artist named Ryo and Robert. After their try to bring back a lost cat they by accident step into the middle of a diamond smuggling and get into trouble with some thugs hired by Mr. Big. After  that they later find out that Ryos  sister Yuri is kidnapped by the smugglers now Ryo and Robert has to go after the smugglers and rescue Yuri.

The movie mix with typical Anime Humor with martial art action, of course I was quite entertained at first but after seeing it a few times it get bored very easily, and sometimes Art Of Fighting feels like a parody of another anime martial art movie ( also based on a game ) names Street Fighter 2.

Oh well it is quite entertaining so why not............",1364774400,,857,4.201219512195122
7873213,1,6304493029,Im a fan of the Art of Fighting game. When I heard there was  movie out I purchased. I don't know why they even bothered to call this movie Art of Fighting. The movie had almost nothing to do with game or the story line. It lacked a real plot and most of the characters that defined the tone of the game. I don't recommend this movie unless you are into anything even remotely related to the Art of Fighting franchise or unless you need a decent door stop.,1143676800,2,456,4.123595505617978
7873214,4,6304493029,"Just about everyone I've seen have said that this anime was absolutely terrible. However, being a fan of Ryo and Robert, I ignored them and bought the anime anyway. And, I actually enjoyed it a lot! The animation is about the level of Speed Racer, and the fight scenes are pretty cheesy, but the anime has this strange goofy charm about it that I just can't help but like. Its lack of seriousness makes it a nice change of pace from most fighting game animes. If you want a great martial arts flick, this probably isn't for you. But, if you're looking for something that's just so cheesy and stupid that you can't help but like it, then this is the anime for you. I loved it.",1025654400,2,675,4.322834645669292
7873215,2,6304493029,"to tell the truth ART OF FIGHTING is a bit of a joke, loosely based on the amazing classic NEO GEO video game, by loosely i mean, when did RYOs main problem involve saving lost cats to gain a cash reward to pay his electricity bill? RYOs sister does get kidnapped, but she (YURI) is far from the destroying machine we know so well from ART OF FIGHTING 2 and KING OF FIGHTERS. As for ROBERT GARCIA, well he shows his usual foolish ways as he acts like the big man. As for the ending, wheres TAKUMA (ryo and yuris father) surely he was your opponent at the end of the video game? oh well, for die hard fans only, even if u are a die hard fan check out the FATAL FURY animes first, they are so much better!",1025049600,,703,4.0285714285714285
