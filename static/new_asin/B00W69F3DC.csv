7125458,5,B00W69F3DC,"The Killers is a double feature containing both theatrical versions of Ernest Hemingways short story. In the short story, a couple of gunmen wait in a lunchroom for a man they were hired to kill. While they wait, the victim lay sweating in his room, knowing the men were after him, but unable to move. The two film adaptations in this release both expend on Hemingways spare tale. The first version, from 1946, is directed by Robert Siodmak; the second, from 1964, is directed by Don Siegel.

In the earlier version, two hit men show up at a diner looking to kill Swede Anderson (Burt Lancaster). Through a series of flashbacks, Swedes life is reconstructed and we learn why hes been targeted. Swede is a prize fighter whos taken a path of self-destruction when he gets involved with mobsters and femme fatale Kitty Collins (Ava Gardner). The film is notable for its crisp dialogue, atmospheric black & white photography, and the screen debut of Lancaster. Its a taut thriller with top-notch supporting performances by Edmond OBrien (D.O.A.), Albert Dekker, Sam Levene, and frequent film noir character actor Charles McGraw.

The 1964 version stars Lee Marvin and Clu Gulager as the two hitmen. More brutal than the earlier film, it was originally intended for television but was deemed too violent for home audiences and released theatrically. Siegel abandoned the dark noir look and shot most of the color film in daylight. His film is especially effective in the opening sequence, in which the murder occurs in an asylum for the blind. John Cassavetes is the victim, Johnny North, and his unusual passivity in the face of death piques the interest of the killers. A tale of robbery and betrayal unfolds with Angie Dickinson as a sultry seductress who pretty much destroys Johnny and gets knocked around a lot. In fact, in one scene, shes punched in the face by Gulagers character; the fact that shes a woman makes no difference. The scene is still pretty shocking.

Bonus content includes Andrei Tarkovskys short film adaptation of The Killers, made when he was a student in 1956; interview from 2002 with writer Stuart M. Kaminsky about both films; audio recording of Stacy Keach reading Hemingways short story; Screen Directors Playhouse radio adaptation from 1949 of the 1946 film, starring Burt Lancaster and Shelley Winters; 2002 interview with actor Clu Gulager; and a critical essay.",1435708800,19,2393,4.962593516209476

7125464,3,B00W69F3DC,"These two versions of Hemingway's ""The Killers"" aren't terrible films by any means, but they were not as dynamic as other reviews led me to believe. I doubt for example that if the 1946 version had not been Burt Lancaster's film debut that it would be anywhere near as well remembered.  Ava Gardner fans certainly keep it on many lists as well, but she doesn't have a strong role here. The 1964 version with Lee Marvin has a bit of shock value (for its time) in places, but would probably not be even getting the Criterion treatment except for the novelty of being able to offer a ""compare and contrast two-for-one"" on the same bluray.

While neither film is really a true ""remake"" of Hemingway's too short story, the 1946 version is much closer to the mark in attempting to flesh it out.  His story is all about the opening sequence, which is done well in the movie and is fairly unique and compelling.  William Conrad as a mobster is particularly effective but ends up playing a minor role for the rest of the film, which is never truly able to meet the expectations the beginning created. Also, although Lancaster and Gardner are in the movie plenty, in some ways they aren't even the lead characters. For me, Sam Levene playing a police lieutenant was the most interesting actor. Ultimately there is enough in the film to give it 4 stars for the sum of interesting aspects interspersed throughout what would ordinarilly be a pretty average movie.

For Lee Marvin fans the 1964 version might be the main reason to pick this up. However, this version was much less true to Hemingway's vision, which would be perfectly fine if it still made for a good movie.  It was 3 stars at best, in some ways most interesting for its in your face, matter of fact style. Angie Dickinson plays a much more prominent role in this version as the femme fatale than Ava Gardner did, but that also dramatically changed the chemistry of the movie. The race car driver character played by John Cassavetes is what really drags the movie down, particularly after seeing Lancaster play the same role. I soldiered through it just to see Ronald Reagan in the end sporting a revolver with a silencer, which was definitely worth it, and the ending of the movie was good and saved it from 2 star status.

Ultimately these two movies have less in common than most people would anticipate, and are really only loosely connected. Still, if you look at this for getting the 1946 version, but then end up also getting what would be a really ""killer"" free bonus feature of the 1964 version, you can still justify the purchase. And the bonus features do include yet another (shorter) take from 1956 as well (thanks Criterion). Picture and sound are excellent.

On balance, 3 1/2 stars and worth getting if the price is right or you are a particular fan of someone. If you are looking for interesting truer noir though, Criterion has much better fare out there. This Japanese noir film is truly amazing:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pale-Flower-The-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B004NWPY4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pale Flower (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>].",1475884800,3,3182,4.934579439252336

It is well scripted and suspenseful, even though the narration informs the viewers of the eventual outcome. When I first saw this film on Turner Classic Movies, I was transfixed and decided it was a film I wanted to own. The original film is based on a short story by Ernest Hemingway. All I can tell you about the 1964 film is that it stars Lee Marvin, Angie Dickenson and John Cassavetes. The liner notes describe it as ""a brutal version...intended for television, but deemed too violent for home audiences and released theatrically instead.""

This film, along with the 1964 remake come in the same Criterion Blu-ray package.  The movies are based on a 1927 short story (roughly 45 pages) by Ernest Hemmingway.  German ex-pat Robert Siodmak directed using a screenplay by Anthony Veiller with help from Richard Brooks and John Huston.  The writers had to create much of the story as Hemmingway's piece was well...short.

The film features the debut of 32 year old Burt Lancaster as `Swede' Anderson, a washed up boxer, small time crook and gas station attendant.  The film is also credited for featuring Ava Gardner in her first significant role.  Seeing the two young actors here provide all you need to know as to how they became movie stars.  They're gorgeous.

The film opens with a long prolog where 2 gangsters, played by Charles McGraw and William Conrad, show up in a small east coast town called Brentwood.  They drop in on a diner for something to eat.  The only ones there are the owner, a cook and a customer named Nick Adams (Phil Brown), a regular character in Hemmingway's short stories.  The 2 goons intimidate the trio and announce that they are there to kill the Swede.  They aren't concerned about who knows about it.  When the Swede doesn't show up, the thugs go looking for him but not before Nick reaches him and warns of the impending confrontation.  Swede doesn't seem to care and accepts his fate.  Wait, what?

Lancaster is bumped off in the opening sequence?  Well yes, but the rest of the film is a series of flashbacks.  It seems that Swede left a $2500 life insurance policy for a woman in Florida.  The insurance company has sent an investigator named Jim Reardon (Edmond O'Brien) to find out what happened and locate the beneficiary.  Reardon seems to have unlimited sway with the authorities.  You would think he was with the FBI or something.  Times have changed.

In any case, Reardon picks up little clues that link Swede back to a famous payroll heist of a company that makes hats.  And it turns out that the hat company was also insured by Reardon's insurance company and they're out $250K, so the investigation continues.  It isn't just the money as Reardon finds the circumstances curious.

Sam Levene plays a New York police lieutenant who helps Reardon along the way.  Strong performances are turned in by Albert Dekker as crime honcho, Big Jim Colfax and Jack Lambert as `Dum-Dum' and Jeff Corey as Blinky.  ""The Killers"" isn't the first of the great film noir, but it is one of the most influential.  The story is interesting and dark, both thematically but technically.  There is the great use of lighting during the film which takes film noir in the early days from scenes of varying shades of grey to one of true black and white.  The Criterion remastered version is a masterpiece of reconstruction.

The Blu ray version comes with a 1.35:1 aspect ratio and a 1080p video resolution.  Here are notes included by Criterion in a small booklet included:

""This new high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit DataCine film scanner from a 35mm nitrate fine-grain master positive. The original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from a 35mm magnetic track. Clicks, thumps, hiss, hum, and crackle were manually removed using Pro Tools HD, AudioCube's integrated worksation, and iZotope RX 4.
Blu-ray mastering: Radius 60, Los Angeles.""

Criterion has done a terrific job restoring this film, highlighting the contrast of the various black and white elements.  Close-ups and detail are crisp and clear.  Grain is evident but consistent and resolved.  I have no complaints regarding the video transfer.  The only audio track available is lossless LPCM mono and while dynamics are limited, dialog is clear and easily understood.  No complaints here either.  Extras include a handful of Siodmak's film trailers, an interview with screenwriter Stuart Kaminsky, Hemingway's story read by actor Stacy Keach, a radio adaptation, Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky's first film which as a version of ""The Killers""  and a small booklet with an essay by novelist Jonathan Lethem.  There are English SDH subtitles.

THE KILLERS (1964) 4.0 Stars

Like the original 1946 version, this remake expands on Ernest Hemingway's short story.  Given the leeway, director Don Siegel and screenwriter use only the basic elements of the earlier story and film and take this movie in a different direction.  Interestingly, a very young Siegel was initially slated to direct the '46 version but he was under contract at the time to a different studio who wouldn't release him.

Unlike the earlier version, the `story teller' here is not an insurance investigator but one of the professional killers hired to kill former race car driver, Johnny North (John Cassavetes).  The executioners, Charlie (Lee Marvin) and Lee (Clu Gulager), dressed in fitted suits and sunglasses have little trouble tracking down Johnny at a school for the blind where he now teaches auto mechanics.  What is surprising is that given an opportunity to run, Johnny stands and accepts his fate in a hail of bullets in front of the students and teachers.

Charlie can't help but wonder why Johnny didn't fight or run.  Charlie decides to track down friends and lovers of Johnny's to find out why.  In a series of long flashbacks, each contact, beginning with race car owner, Earl (Claude Akins), provides pieces to a puzzle that suggests Johnny was part of an elaborate armored car heist.  So what happened to the money?  Angie Dickinson plays Sheila, Johnny's love interest but who is also tied to a small time gangster named Browning (Ronald Reagan).

In his final film appearance, Reagan is very effective as the polished hoodlum.  The 1946 version is a great example of film noir with its various shadings of black and white and the excellent photography.  This '64 version uses bold colors and can hardly be strictly categorized as film noir, with the exception of theme elements.  That is, a femme fatale, twists, turns and double crosses.  The movie was slated to be shown on NBC as the first ""made for television"" movie, but the violence, theme and the recent assassination of President Kennedy, changed minds and the film was shelved for a while.  It was eventually released theatrically in the summer of 1964.

For my money the '46 version directed by Robert Siodmak is a noir masterpiece.  This version is for a different time and place and is well done, especially given the budget.  Both are included in a Criterion Collections set which I strongly recommend.

The Blu ray version comes in 1080p with a 1.34:1 aspect ratio.  Included in the small booklet is the following text regarding the transfer:

""This new high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit DataCine film scanner from a 35mm interpositive. The original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from a 35mm magnetic track. Clicks, thumps, hiss, hum, and crackle were manually removed using Pro Tools HD, AudioCube's integrated workstation, and iZotope RX 4.

The colors look very good, bright and bold.  While there was some inconsistency in grain levels, the picture looks very good overall.  Very minor scratches and specs can be seen if you are looking for them.  The audio comes via a LPCM mono track.  The background noise has been minimized and improvements have been made which are especially noticeable in the racing sequences and with John Williams score.  There is an English SDH subtitle option.  Extras include an interesting interview from 2002 with Clu Gulager who played Lee, a read excerpt from Siegel's autobiography about the film, a trailer and an essay by critic Geoffrey O'Brien.",1440374400,5,7732,4.964174454828661

8712291,1,B00W69F3DC,"I have both the Killers Criterion Collection Double Disc (North America) And Region B(UK) Blu-ray my thoughts on the release from the uk of which I have and on the North American Version. Both Films 1946 and My Favorite the 1964. The Soviet student Movie is not too compelling.

It's too bad I brought the blu-ray directly from Arrow Films who didn't want to help me in some matters but by the same token as they say I am glad I got it because what the stock picture here for it doesn't show is that this REGION B(Won't play here in North America) has an alternate cover other than the the Cheesy Red Cover with Drunkard CommieSpy(read Nicholas Reynold's book) Hemingway's name on the cover. You are getting the same features of the North American Release but you get to choose which cover(it is reversible, I have it with the Beautiful Artwork of Racing cars) and according to the description on back two different aspect ratios to choose from.  Another thing I like is this Particular one Has only the 1964 Version which is Superior in my opinion to the Original 1946 and the silly soviet student film of 56/58' .  I had to buy the overrated and expensive Critierion Collection in order to see the 1964 version and get both the 1946 movie and the 1956 ""student"" film. neither of which interest me, Hemingway's name was chosen by the studio sadly each time,even though 64' version had nothing of Hemingway in it Thank God. Just Some things from the 46'. The Killers 64' was Known for it's then Horrific violence which pales in comparision to the utter lack of morals today. It came out right after the immorally corrupt camelot myth and traitor(bayofPigs,Soviets) JFK got whacked. So it was shelved for awhile, The Movie was meant to be the first TV MOVIE alas it was deemed too violent then,but it became a great Motion picture in theaters later on despite the US Press's distaste for it. Lee Marvin was a Man in every sense of the word making my generation look well. The movie can be cruel. The movie's production has been unfairly criticized,The racing scenes while not such a fancy production and typical of the time is pretty neat Although I must say I enjoyed it most of all specifically Lee Marvin's lines. This film is very much politically incorrect and would never get a pass now from The blind School scenes to the Castroite Loving Angie Dickinson getting beat up here and there. The Only Movie where Ronald Reagan the best President Of this Country ever played a villain and which he regretted making. He did the movie for His Friend Lew Wasserman. The 1946 version is dull and Yet passes off as Film Noir,Burt Lancaster a Softie and over-rated Ava Gardner. All in All I prefer the 1964 Movie, It's a Masterpiece and I wish they would release here in America the 1964 alone. I had to buy the Double disc Criterion Collection(don't worry I got it for $12 new) which reguarly is expensive.(I have the bluray UK version for display)and I wish they drop the Hemingway Name off the cover.",1527897600,2,2997,4.598130841121495

8712293,2,B00W69F3DC,"Review for The Killers
Hot Toasty Rag, September 9, 2017

The reason The Killers is remembered is it was Burt Lancasters first movie. Yes, its a film noir murder mystery, but if it didn't give birth to such a fantastic star, it probably would have been swept under the rug with the other low-budget 40s films.

On the surface, it sounds like a cheesy story that someone wrote to make fun of old gangster movies. Burts nickname is The Swede and Ava Gardner plays the slinky love interest Kitty Collins. Hitmen and detectives make up the rest of the characters, and while there are twists and turns and flashbacks, it almost feels like its spoofing itself.

I found it most similar to another Burt Lancaster movie, Criss Cross, and its not as good as the really memorable film noirs like Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice. But maybe its just me. Give it a watch and see what you think of it!",1504915200,,907,4.5182926829268295
