7919511,5,B00003XALM,"DO IT YOURSELF CARTOON KIT is one of the most hilarious shorts ever made.  This unihnibited guide to the making of the animated cartoon is much more accessible to the general public now than it was upon original release(1959!) and shows Godfrey's heavy influence on Terry Gilliam.

INSTANT SEX is also hilarious. I recommend Godfrey as an inspired lunatic and master comic storyteller.",1093651200,,385,5.095238095238095
