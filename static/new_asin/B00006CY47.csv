7967964,5,B00006CY47,"""Andromeda Season 1, Vol. 2""  is a great DVD.  Besides the fact Andromeda is great show. The DVD is loaded with a lot extra features including: Bloopers,Commentary,Character profiles, and episodes in wide-screen. These DVD are great value for any fan of the show or someone just discovering it.",1035417600,,294,5.104166666666667
7967965,4,B00006CY47,"Andromeda, as a series, has hit it's high point and has been running down since the second season.  However, the first season remains FANTASTIC.  With Robert Hewitt Wolfe writing the series, and the phenomenal acting of the cast, you can expect great lines delivered with a lot of cool and style.  Notably, Keith Hamilton Cobb as the [tough guy] of the Universe and Lexa Doig doing triple duty in every episode as the ship, hologram, and computer, all of which she manages to imbue with their own personality.  I single them out for excellency, but the entire cast is good in this show.  I recommend buying the DVDs right up to season 2 episode 12, which was the last one featuring Wolfe as head writer, and the beginning of the show's downturn.
The commentary could be better, with (I believe) Alan Eastman boring us with show facts that are blatantly obvious to anyone who's watched - But Kevin Sorbo pipes up when he's allowed to, and actually has some good stories to tell.  His antics in the gag reel are by themselves enough reason to buy this DVD :-P",1034294400,,1057,4.5661375661375665
7967966,5,B00006CY47,"Angel Dark, Demon Bright is a climatic episode in the Andromeda series.  It involves Harper's Fusion catalyst, which will stun you with its effects as well as some great poetic lines from Rev and Tyr.  It is by far one of the best episodes in this DVD Volume.  In this Volume you also get 2 other great episodes, ""The Ties That Blinds"" which includes Beka Valentines brother and ""The Banks of the Lethe"" where Dylan reunites with his wife Sarah 303 years ago.  This series in my opinion is better than the first because now the show is picking up and almost at the current level of excitement!  I hope you enjoy the DVD and hope the review is helpful to you.",1032480000,,658,4.360655737704918
7967967,3,B00006CY47,"Part 2 of the Andromeda Saga, and it's a great ride. Video is sharp, audio is crisp, and its easy to navigate. Andromeda without commercials is definately the way to see it.
  The down side? No closed captioning (really helpful when trying to steal a few minutes while the baby sleeps) and not enough commentary (only on 1 episode out of 5?? Come on, Kevin, you can talk more than that!!)
  All in all, a definite buy for the sci-fi fan; and not bad for anyone else.",1031702400,5,466,4.32183908045977
