8534020,5,B000IZTZK8,"Beautifully done and very informative.  The moves are explained in a easy to understand manner, and I especially liked the notes regarding the moves at the end of each segment.  The short routine at the end of the instructional segment helps to reinforce the movements and shows ways to connect the movements in combinations that are easy to perform.  While I normally do not endorse DVDs for a beginner because I feel beginning students needs the guidance of a teacher, I do feel this DVD series is a exception.

In addition, IAMED goes the extra mile by providing a workout with Jindra using belly dance moves. and then tops the DVD off with not one but two skillfully executed performances by Paulina and Amara. While it is aimed at the beginner dancer, it also provides a good practice series for the advanced dancer who wants to brush up on their basics.",1350345600,,859,4.66887417218543
