5672850,5,B00BTJV9RO,"Season one was clever and fun to look at, but got old quickly. Fortunately, they really upped the ante here. The series looks great and the stories are as good as most adventure films, with great dialogue and unique stories/characters. WIN!",1372204800,,240,4.878048780487805
5672851,4,B00BTJV9RO,I watched every episode on Saturday morning (good old DVR!) and thoroughly enjoyed it! Adding the Red Lanterns was a great touch and then followed by some (but not all) of the other colors really opens the Lantern Corps universe! Animation is well done and story lines are great. Each episode can stand alone but carries to the next; definitely a thread to the whole series. I hope it continues - I'll be watching!,1368662400,3,414,4.608108108108108
5672852,5,B00BTJV9RO,"The main protagonist, Hal Jordan is the first human to become a Green Lantern, and is considered one of the best. He is an almost fearless and skilled Lantern and has a history of disobeying orders and disregarding rules to achieve success. His superiors see him as a loose cannon, but they are willing to overlook his transgressions due to his skill and accomplishments.

As guardian of sector 2814 (Earth), Green Lantern Hal Jordan is used to being in dangerous situations- but he's never faced anything like this! Set at the farthest reaches of deep space, GREEN LANTERN: THE ANIMATED SERIES finds Hal defending the galaxy against the Anti Monitor, which controls an army of Manhunters whose only objective is to get rid of potential criminal activity. However, the Manhunters have determined that all emotional responses are the origin of crime, leading them to lay waste to an entire sector of the universe, which started up the Red Lantern Corps. With his former drill sergeant Green Lantern Kilowog, his new ""friend"" Red Lantern Razer, and their transport vessel's artificial intelligence, Aya, Hal Jordan is faced with the duty of protecting the galaxy from the Anti-Monitor and the Manhunters.

The Final 13 Episodes of the Green Lantern TAS are on 2 Discs and are in the following order:

14) The New Guy
15)Reboot
16)Steam Lantern
17)Blue Hope
18)Prisoner of Sinestro
19)Loss
20)Cold Fury
21)Babel
22)Love is a Battlefield
23)Larfleeze
24)Scarred
25)Ranx
26)Dark Matter

I loved this show and it's a shame that Cartoon Network cancelled this series along with Young Justice. Both series were just beginning to become the best animated shows ever! Luckily, Green Lantern TAS was able to feature great character and details before it was cancelled. Characters and features such as: The Next Green Lantern of Earth Guy Gardner, Sinestro, other Green Lanterns, the Blue Lantern Corp., the Star Sapphire Corp., The Orange Lantern Corp./Agent Orange, Scar, and the Anti-Monitor and Manhunters!!!",1365120000,36,2000,5.16358024691358
5672853,5,B00BTJV9RO,"WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS After watching the first half of season 1 I eagerly awaited the second half and was not disappointed. The season opens with the arrival of the all-powerful and seemingly indestructible Anti-Monitor and the reactivation of the Manhunters, with their chilling mantra ""no man escapes the Manhunters"" The first episode also introduces the overconfident and self-centered Guy Gardner. This season also features two characters from the comics: Sinestro and Larfleeze. Also, John Stewart is mentioned in one episode (""that fake news guy"" as Hal Jordan put it). Stewart replaces Guy Gardner as Earth's green lantern in that episode. You can feel the impending doom when Aya becomes the Aya-Monitor and feel the anguish when Aya self destructs in the finale. I hope Cartoon Network brings this show back for a second season. I will definitely be buying this.",1365120000,16,876,5.264285714285714

5672894,5,B00BTJV9RO,And so we come to the end of this amazing series with Vol 2 of Green Lantern.  Truly a fantastic animated action adventure the likes of which have not  been seen on Cartoon  Network since they cancelled JLU. Nor will you see again on that network after they so foolishly cancelled Beware The Batman. As good as GL vol 1 was Green Lantern Animated series Vol 2 might be even better. Executive Producer Bruce Timm returns with his amazing team to finish up this awesome sci fi adventure show. With about the same incredible  voice cast and few new guest voices. Its sure to be a crowd pleaser for fans young and old of DC action shows.  An Absolute must for any fan of action shows and of course DC comics.,1439424000,,704,4.343511450381679
5672895,5,B00BTJV9RO,Great color. Grandson loved it. A bit more violent than the Super Hero Squad series.,1433289600,,84,4.666666666666667
5672896,5,B00BTJV9RO,"Those of you who have watched episodes of this series on YouTube don't know what you are missing. The clarity and beauty of the DVD version truly makes this at least TWICE as good as the versions of the episodes you can watch on YouTube. You should treat those episodes as 'previews'. If you think you know what this series is all about from YouTube you only know about HALF the full story.

Okay, I'll admit that it took a while for me to like this, on YouTube. The UNREALISTICALLY muscularly built characters were a real turnoff for me. The original Hal Jordan I grew up with, from the comic books, represents my idea of the perfectly built body. Superman was much too big for my tastes as well as Batman and other comic superheroes. The original Hal Jordan had the proportional body I felt all worthwhile men should strive for.

So, I was initially angry that they chose to animate Green Lanterns with unrealistically built bodies. Lower bodies that would most probably collapse under the weight of the upper body, in real life. Once I got past that and chose to ignore it I became enthralled by this series. I have no intention of spoiling it for you, but this is one series you really should watch from beginning to end. If you come in somewhere in the middle you will not understand the premises of what this is all about.

I will say this much: There is a very well thought out story plot that ties the first episode to the last. It will BLOW YOUR MIND if you follow it. Well, it really blew my mind and I'm so friggin 'jaded' I might as well be made of jade. If you love quality animation and enjoy the concept of a superhero who creates from his imagination you will love this animated series.",1432425600,,1702,4.396825396825397

This is the Green Lantern series I was waiting for. Made for kids, but full of excellent writing that carries the storylines. A shame the series lasted such a short time.",1419379200,,353,4.786885245901639

With a villain even more intimidating than Atrocitus and a excellent and character driven series of twists in the back-end, this is everything a GL fan could hope for.

Great Charactor and her voice had me entranced, and then when she transforms... wow..  One of Grey Delise's best performances IMO. In Fact I even got her to do a voice mail message for me in this voice, she does them for charity on occasion.

The only Drawback I would have at all is no Blue-ray is available.  The animation is best in the Full HD.",1387929600,,470,4.010752688172043

5672917,5,B00BTJV9RO,"I HAVE ALLWAYS BEEN A WARNER BROS ANIMATION FAN GOING BACK INTO THE 1950S.. MAY TELL YOU HOW OLD I AM.  I PREFERRED HAND DRAWN CARTOONS,
ESPECIALLY THE ONES MADE IN THE 1940S.  UNTILL I SAW THE SHREK FILMS I DID NOT THINK I COULD APPRECIATE COMPUTERIZED DRAWINGS, BUT SHREK CHANGED
MY MIND A BIT.  I BOUGHT ALL THE SHREK DVDS FROM AMAZON PLUS LATER GOT POLAR EXPRESS WHICH I REALLY LOVED; OF COURSE I LOVE STEAM LOCOMOTIVES ANYHOW.
I DO HAVE SOME GREEN LATERN DVDS (FROM AMAZON) IN CONVENTIONAL LINE DRAWN ANIMATION AND LIKED THEM.  THESE GREEN LATERN PROGRAMS ARE ANINATED IN THE
SHREK STYLE, VERY FLUID, SMOOTH MOVEMENTS WITH SUPERIOR 3D STYLE EFFECTS ANIMATION (BACKGROUNDS, HARDWARE AND SUCH).  THE CHARACTERS ARE FAITHFULL TO
THE ORIGINAL STYLES THOUGH I FIND THE RATHER STYLIZED GREEN LATERNS A BIT OVER STYLIZED: SHOULDERS TWO BROAD, ETC.  STILL, THE OVERALL QUALITY IS VERY
GOOD, STORIES VERY GOOD WITH A FINE MUSICAL SCORE(VERY IMPORTANT TO ME) IN THE BACKGROUND.  I LIKE THE WAY THEY DRAWN THE FEMALES!  I THINK MOST FANS

5672918,4,B00BTJV9RO,"I made a bet that if a friend finds me a movie, or TV series by the end of the night that I had ti have in my collection, I would go out on a date with a girl that somebody else wanted me to go out with.  I was sure I would win this bet since I went store to store and found nothing of interest.  I own too many movies as it is... So another friend came over, took me to Target and bout me Season 1 part 1 to Green lantern the animated series... He said $5 dollars for the movie, and $5 for the date as it was $10 at Target. So I owed him the $5 by going out on that date, and honoring a bet that I have now LOST! but, I got to keep a good series... This is Season 1 part 2 Which I bought at Amazon, because I wanted to finish the series!

Great story, great action, and well developed characters... A red lantern is evil except one, taken under a trusted wing, see what you get when you take in raised bad apple and give it love and vinegar, and cut out the worms and mushy parts, not a bad tasting apple once refrigerated and soaked in cold water.  This is that kind of story, and the multi-colored lanterns, representing different moods make it interesting.  I wish this story had continued.

I don't understand young Justice, so i refuse to buy it, and Teen Titans the original series was very good! But Go Teen Titans replaced this series, how??? It stinks!!! I also rate season 1 part 1 of Green Lantern 4 stars as well.",1381276800,,1426,3.9859649122807017

5672923,5,B00BTJV9RO,"It was sad to find out in the middle of the second season of 'Green Lantern' that it would be the last season. Still, you have to find some good among the bad and the second season of this groundbreaking show was no exception.

Once again Bruce Timm caters to his and the DC fan base with another strong season and exposing us to more of the Green Lanter mythos. The Blue Lantern core, Larfleeze and Guy Gardner are only a few treats that this strong second season gives us. Along with it comes an unexpected love story that stretches beyond the stars and in the end it is up to Hal, Kilowog and the Green Lantern core to prevent the unthinkable from happening, the end of the universe.

Unfortunately this show gives us closure, but still leaves a whole new story arc open. So many fans have written and complained and pretty much have begged for more episodes. Who knows if we will ever get them, but for now I am glad to say that this was an incredible show and I am glad to be the proud owner of another DCAU classic.",1378425600,6,1021,4.257731958762887

5672927,5,B00BTJV9RO,"'Manhunter Menace' (2013) is the second volume of the Green Lantern animated series (the first is 'Rise of the Red Lanterns'). There are 13 episodes on two DVDs, and they're pretty much all good - although I personally think that the 'Steam Lantern' episode is worth buying the whole set for!
This is a nice, original adaptation of the comics. It's not anything you've seen before - even if most of the characters and plot ideas come from the comics, this series has its own definite feel and a strong, original storyline. The animation is all computer-generated (CG), and is very smooth and clean. The characters are a bit stylized (they kind of look like action figures), but the power ring effects are really excellent. From elaborate green manifestations of virtual objects to the subtle green shimmer of a ring-generated personal force shield, these are really the best visualizations of the Green Lantern power I've seen.
At last notice, the series had been cancelled, ending with the last episode of Season Two. That's genuinely too bad; this series had a lot more story to tell.",1376524800,,1086,4.875675675675676

This second half of season one was an excellent and thoroughly enjoyable finish to the season, and sadly to the series, as WB cancelled this wonderful show and replaced it with some mind numbing drivel. It seems to be the newest thing, to make an amazing animated series and run it for one or two seasons, and then replace it with a far, far inferior product, and run it for three, four or five seasons. It makes absolutely no sense. Sorry, I digress. Green Lantern the Animated Series is a five star product in my opinion, and I would highly recommend it!",1375833600,8,670,4.455284552845528

5672930,5,B00BTJV9RO,The producers of the film could have saved millions of dollars. This animated series was true to the mythology of the character.  It's fun to watch.  I've read comics all my life and hope this is the way all future adaptations were done. The animated series does something the movies can't. It has character development with each episode.  It's shows like this that can actually tell character driven stories without the high stakes of a 100 million dollar movie. That and it's fun to watch. This show is for old school fans for those who like old fashion super hero cartoons.  It's good to see that DC hasn't forgotten how to make a good series.  It was cancelled too soon for it's time.  However we have 26 episodes we can enjoy forever.  I hope Beware of The Batman series is just as good!,1374710400,6,792,4.496503496503497
