8307918,4,B001H5X6TE,"I think this is a beautiful movie with gorgeous sets , costumes and very good melodrama. The cinematography is stunning and and the scenery in both Budapest and India more than generously displayed. Loved it . It was like a loving set of snapshots and videos sent home from a wonderful vacation . A veritable travelogue with a great dramatic love story . The dancing is perfect and a lot of it done lavishly MGM style with birds eye views looking down and then at face level. The music has a mixture of Spanish and Indian about it. You can almost see senoritas dancing with senors to the tune as well as traditional Bollywood style. This story never ever drags and is very fast paced through all scenes.

Plot:
 Her name was Varsha and she smiled and danced and the moon was envious. She fell in love with a rich guy who was toying with her and she found out about it. She made a decision to punish him . Then he decided to get even. Her father is dead from a severe shock from the part he inadvertently played in her destruction. she decided to rebuild and rechristen  herself so others won't hear her name and remember the whispers about her. She calls herself Payal now . You are meeting her after her heart has been shattered . She is much changed from the girl she used to be. Her confidence in her ability to judge others destroyed. She has gone to live with her fathers elderly best friend whom she calls uncle. He's a lawyer in Budapest. There are some surprises on that one later.

Payal  is suddenly introduced in the opening after Ajay Devgans character Karan has been chasing an elusive woman just out of touch in all his day dreams and his paintings. He sees her face and after painting it for 8 years and he is now intent upon getting her to stop and talk to him.  He goes to sleep and he sees her face even though he's never met her. She can't stand to hear he believes he loves her ..but that doesn't run him off he tries another way by getting an intro via her uncle ..AFTER she has poured her history out to her ""uncle"" he goes to talk to Karan and enlightens him on a few things : A Devil came into Payals life and he looted Payal so brutally that she now hates words like love, affection, friendship, sympathy. Today she is not even ready to hear a mans name and I told her your story but she doesn't want to hear it. He's devastated and decides to go home to his palatial estate in India where his family lives. When she hears this it makes her stop and think and she realizes that she is slowly falling in love with him via all the sweet things he's been saying and doing trying to prove himself to her. Maybe it's worth another try. Yes she will marry him and build a joyful life with a man who really loves her. Guess who's coming to dinner.

 Be prepared. You will be shocked  when she tells her original love story to her ""uncle"". in a 15 minute flashback segment:  Her fiance Shravan was pure evil in his spite from the earlier punishment she dealt him. She breaks his pride and he breaks her heart. They are two very alike passionate people who hold on to anger. He also slaps her twice quite viciously, like she did him only not as public and brother did she make it public.  The venue she chose ; not the greatest route to choose for sure.  The revenge scene for him is pure evil villain and it's not diluted. You need to be the judge on how old a child can be to watch this one based on the seduction /revenge scene. I personally would not go beneath 12.yo on this one and that's pushing it. If you are conservative , watch it alone first and decide..possibly 14 or above.  When you see Shravan on the screen again later , remember one thing for the sake of the plot. Remember when she says to her uncle she stayed inside the house for months after that. She never left it. Her father is dead she's all alone and publicly humiliated ,no one to lean on at all. The director wants you to remember that and the difference between what Shravan believes he did later and his real actions. How he sees himself. How Varsha now Payal, a quieter but stronger version ,would see him now . They give you that information for a reason.

  How happy you will be with this stunning film purely resides with which brother you want her to end up with. The acting is great except.... Mr. Director ,what's up with the bathtub scene ; kinda skeevy... I already love Ajay and find Sanjay's face interestingly male like john Wayne was or Brolin or Coburn. Could of done without the slaps but hey he WAS playing prideful evil guy who did live to regret it later.",1339632000,2,4571,4.279258400926999
8307919,4,B001H5X6TE,"This is about a girl (Manisha Koirala) who is callously played with by a playboy in New York (Sanjay Dutt). She flees her disgrace and hurt and moves to Budapest. In Budapest she meets a guy (Ajay Devgan) who has seen images of her in his dreams and painted them for many years. He convinces her to let him heal her hurt. He returns to India to arrange their engagement. It seems his is a prince and he meets his beloved brother who is heartbroken as the one love of his life has dumped him after he mistreated her. he is now full of regret for his actions. When the girl comes for the wedding the brothers discover they have been in love with the same girl. So we have a triangle now....

Now the cover suggests this is full of dark tragedy but it isn't. It is a typical Bollywood romance/ melodrama. What is of note is that it is a very lavish production. The song and dance numbers have all the stops pulled out as big production numbers. Then there is the beauty of Budapest, and the grand princely home in India, caught in some enticing cinematography.

The 3 leads are all very good too. I haven't quite clicked with Ajay Devgan yet as he is a little lacking in charisma for me compared to some of the A-listers. However he did a good job with the part. Sanjay Dutt had more 'oomph' for me. Some of the songs (which were mostly fully orchestrated) were catchy and the music generally good. However nothing particular stayed with me after the movie. The story is an interesting enough one too.

So with all that I can't work out why it mostly tends to score just average elsewhere on the Net. I thought it was above average. Some of the Indian sites thought it looked liked the movies of the 1990s in style and perhaps that's why it bombed at box office there. Yet I like the style of those 90s and early 00s movies so I was happy with it - as many others also were happy to see a new one made more in that style. It looks modern but it has the melodrama so beloved previously. Anyway - it's a keeper for me and I quite liked this one.",1242086400,,2040,4.21227621483376
