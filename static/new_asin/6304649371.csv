One of the androids is Dr. Gero and the other is android 19 these two are not the one's Trunks fought in the future. Later on two stronger androids come to fight they are android 18 and android 20",1132358400,,336,4.435483870967742
7875755,5,6304649371,"When the fourth season of DBZ aired on Toonami I was ecstatic (mostly because I was tired of watching the Namek/Freiza sagas), there is so much to love about this particular saga even though they edited for TV. I was awe with the amount of scenes uncut version; they were intriguing scenes to watch and praise. There are five androids in all and so many plot twists from the starting from the first episode it will leave you wanting to watch this again if you never saw it on Toonami. Based on what I've heard from previous released uncut DBZ DVDs' released by Funimation, the English dub is as well as can be expected, I'm glad they didn't redub the narrator like they did in the Perfect Cell Saga DVDs (those who have watched the edited version released by Pioneer Video will notice the change of voice-actors and dialogue for the characters right off), as is the Japanese Sub. My only compaint with the Japanese sub is that the audio is mono type and the quallity isn't as clear as the English dub (not to mention Masako Nozowa is Goku's/Gohan's ""female"" voice actor, which bothered me) but purists or non-purists should enjoy it. Anyways, mirai Trunk's predictions have come true and its up to Goku and the gang to stop these androids that plan to destroy earth, therefore bringing about the future Mirai Trunks lives in.

Except there's a problem; the androids Goku and the others face are not the one's Trunks told them about, plus Goku is suddenly put out comission by a deadly heart virus that killed him in the future leaving the Z- warriors in a serious time of doubt of their own abilities against the lethal machines. The story progresses from there into entirely different plot and the Z-fighters find themselves trying prevent a future not yet come to pass while Goku struggles to beat the virus that ills him. This is the saga to watch before perchasing the Imperfect Cell saga on DVD.",1103587200,4,1900,4.621301775147929
7875756,5,6304649371,This saga takes place after the trunks saga. Androids come to west city and since the Z fighters were informed already they are waiting for them. Yamcha is the first to encounter them and his energy is absorbed. Goku fly's off with them to an island and fights android 19. His disease that he was warned about takes effect and he starts to lose. Luckily Vegeta steps in and takes control. He is now a super saiyan. Trunks also comes back and tells them that the androids that have seen are not the ones that are in his world. The other android is actually Dr. Gero and he must go and activate android 17 & 18. They kill him and go off on their own. Vegeta catches up with them and fights 18 but loses. They fly off and they decide to drive to gokus house. This saga is great because we get to see vegeta be a super saiyan for the first time. We also get to see some great fight scenes. Like always this is a must have for the fans.,1084665600,6,931,4.092896174863388
7875757,5,6304649371,"This Box Set is an incredible deal, getting 4 DVD's (14 episodes) for just under $50. But the great part of all is that these DVD's are incredible. The first two DVD's in this box set detail the encounter with the very first androids, 19 and 20. They have amazing fight scenes and a very interesting story with tons of plot twists which end up with the unleashing of Androids 17 and 18 during the third DVD. The last two DVD's detail the fights with these androids. (Oh how great it is to see Vegeta completely fail.)
With tons of plot twists and an incredible story, this box set is definitely one to be had. The fact that they are uncut is good because there is a ton of humor in here that is taken out of the edited versions along with some of the fighting moments. Every DVD is bilingual, which means that they all have both the Uncut Dub and the Japanese Sub versions. The end of the box set sort of ends on quite a cliffhanger, which will leave you wanting the Imperfect Cell Box Set (and I'm not going to go and say that's bad, it is also a very good box set.)
In conclusion, this box set is definitely one to be bought, it is very good.",1075766400,12,1144,4.157657657657658
7875758,4,6304649371,The Androids boxset is one of the few best episodes in the series. Your introduced to new characters and you get to see vegeta turn into a super sayian at last!! And Future Trunks gets a big fat role in this series *For anyone who likes Trunks!*. Go ahead and buy the dvds. You'll definatly get a kick out of it!,1064102400,8,312,4.131147540983607
