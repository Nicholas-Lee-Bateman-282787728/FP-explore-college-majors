8245132,3,B0012DP4SC,"At the three royal cities. The footage was mainly of the pagoda-style architecture that describes most, if not all, of their buildings, shrines and temples in the cities. Combine that with the crowds of local pedestrians mulling around on the narrow streets and even narrower alley ways, and you've got an idea of the look of this documentary. In fact. they could have filmed it all in one city and, unless one were familiar with the region, one would not have known the difference.

The voiceover is provided by a cultivated British-accented male tenor, who rambles on pleasantly enough. However, I would have preferred the script be a little more robust, fact-wise. Some dates were provided, but they would have been more interesting with more than one sentence of background. The narrator does get an ""A"" for pronunciation, though.

One thing I did notice toward the end was how many times the narrator used the words ""destruction"" and ""destroyed"". Apparently, the region is prone to all manner of catastrophe, natural and man-made.",1454284800,,1035,5.011627906976744

The focus of the Kathmandu section is Durbar Square, including Hanuman Dhoka Palace, Kala Bhairav statue, and Kasthamandap, Trailokya Mohan Narayan, and Mahendreswor Temples. The chaotic streets, markets, and shops are also shown.

Bhaktapur features the Dattatraya and Nyatapole Temples, and Durbar Square, including the Palace of 55 Windows, the Golden Gate, Naga Pokhari, and Vatsala Temple. The peacock window, potters square, narrow alleys, shops, people and kids are also shown.

As opposed to the Malla cities of Kathmandu and Bhaktapur that were mainly influenced by the Hindu religion, Patan was for many years a major Buddhist city. Patan features the 5-story Kumbeshwar Temple, the Mahabouddha Temple of a thousands images of Buddha, the Golden Temple, and Durbar Square.

The history of each city is briefly but well described and is illustrated with the video of the sights. I especially enjoyed the video and commentary of the Golden Temple in Patan. The colour is a bit washed out at times, especially in bright sunlight.",1254182400,,1262,5.3908629441624365
