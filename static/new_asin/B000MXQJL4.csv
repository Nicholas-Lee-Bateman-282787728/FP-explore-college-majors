All I can say is that if you want to know the Bible and how it relates to you, the Old Testament, the New Testament, the geography of the Bible, and history not in the Bible, but clarifying the time and place of any particular part of the Bible, you need to read, see, or attend as many opportunities as you can with Dr. Creasy.  It will speed you on your way to knowning Christ, and will strengthen your faith.  I am saying this in faith because I know you will not be disappointed, but fulfilled.
