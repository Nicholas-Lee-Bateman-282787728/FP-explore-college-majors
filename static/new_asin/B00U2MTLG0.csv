This is an attractive programme recorded in 2014 at Lucerne with Andris Nelsons replacing the much loved Claudio Abbado who had planned the programme before his recent death. This was therefore an important occasion as it was hoped to successfully lead the way forward into the future Lucerne Festivals. Nelsons, who had led the previous Memorial Concert and was therefore known to the orchestra, had the advantage of familiarity in what might have been a stressful occasion for all concerned. Viewers of this recording will note pleasure and support rather than any signs of stress.

Nelsons leads a particularly glowing and relaxed account of the opening Serenade 2, scored for small orchestra without violins. This orchestration in itself determines the warmth of the string writing and that comes over strongly in this performance. That warmth and glow continues with a particularly moving account of the Alto Rhapsody led by Sara Mingardo whose meaningful delivery of the script was able to convey Brahms emotional response to a recently failed romantic attachment. The soloist was a favourite choice of Abbado and it obvious why that would be so. Collectors may also be aware of her fine contribution to the two Vivaldi Glorias with Rinaldo Alessandrini and will enjoy this further example of her art.

The concert concludes with an equally warm and glowing, autumnal would be an appropriate descriptor had the symphony been a later work, account of this sunniest of all the composers four symphonies. Those who are aware of this conductors love of extreme pianissimo dynamics, coupled with slowing tempi in order to heighten his desire to convey emotional impact, will notice plenty of examples of such lingering affection. This will either be a positive or a negative view depending on the listeners concept of the music.

Generally timings for movements are a bit on the long side but this is mostly the result of the lingering over slow and quiet passages rather than delay over fast and more energetic passages. Basic comparisons on these points with Abbados own studio recording of the symphony (and the Alto Rhapsody,) plus recordings by Ansermet, Kertesz, Suitner, and Karajan for further examples, show their general preferences for more forward movement with a greater sense of directional intent, in another word, drama. Collectors and purchasers need to be aware of this distinction.

None are more so intent on drama than Beecham in his famous live account where the final brass flourish is highlighted by doubling the two trumpets just for the last two bars. This expensive display is simply thrilling despite an elderly recording. Nelsons, on the contrary, actually holds back the very final chord, losing the expected rhythmic pulse and contributing to the only moment in the concert where his decision results in a slightly ragged attack from members of the momentarily wrong-footed orchestra.

Regardless of the above proviso this is still a most enjoyable concert that will particularly please those who respond most strongly to the conductors love of physical expression. The audience rises to give a standing ovation encouraged by Nelsons himself who, briefly sitting down on the conductors rostrum, signals to the audience to stand in appreciation. This they do, and with that rather unusual experience the recording fades out!

The recording itself is completely up to the high standards now expected of the Paul Smaczny team. Paul Smaczny regularly ensures exemplary clarity of vision coupled with involving, but never invasive, camera work. The sound is equally clear providing precision without sacrificing cohesion. The playback options are for DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 and stereo. This is a quality recording. There is a subtitle option for the Alto Rhapsody and the booklet provides an interesting and thorough background to the concert and is very supportive of all concerned.

This is a warm occasion warmly delivered and warmly supported providing much for purchasers to enjoy.",1481846400,,4043,5.218798151001541

8703999,5,B00U2MTLG0,"Great performance of the Brahms Second Symphony; Nelsons is a bit hard to watch, almost in the same league as Mitsuko Uchida with her facial grimacing. He is inelegant, almost arachnoidesque in his movements.  He extricates brilliant playing from the LFO, however, which makes this a redeeming audio performance.  I don't know who taught him conducting, but clearly his unorthodox approach is effective in obtaining fine playing, but it's a bit too hyperanimated and dynamic a ride for some viewers.  He should watch videos, without emulating them, of Abbado, Chailly, Karajan, Kleiber and even Toscanini and think it through one more time.",1446508800,,640,5.254901960784314
8704000,4,B00U2MTLG0,"The picture is stunning in Blu-Ray and the sound is very good on a good sound system. The only negative I have is that I would have liked to have had English captions for the Alto Rhapsody -- which isn't heard as often as it should be and is splendidly performed. Sometimes it seemed that conductor Andris Nelsons was emoting more than necessary but I don't think I've ever observed an orchestra more into swinging with a conductor, either. Brahms' Serenade No. 2, which begins the program, is not very well known, I believe, but it has good Brahmsian harmonies and orchestration.",1442620800,2,580,4.696078431372549
