4852347,5,B005OK0YR0,For so many years now we have waited for a decent digital release of this classic. The staggering contrast to the old film-rolls and the VHS is just very pleasant. Almost worth waiting for all these years. Remember though that this scenery was meant to reflect the newly created Californian cult back then - not the other way around. The choppers displayed here are esthetic jewels. The soundtrack implemented represents the benchmark of the genre.,1350086400,3,448,4.986666666666666
4852348,5,B005OK0YR0,"i love these old biker flicks, usually a dumb story line but way cool classic choppers,order was easy & received movie promptly",1332979200,2,127,4.818181818181818
4852349,5,B005OK0YR0,The DVD arrived in a timely manner and was in good order.  It was the first time this classic biker film has been available on DVD.  It was an excellent print.,1328313600,2,159,4.096774193548387
4852350,4,B005OK0YR0,"""Devil's Angels"" (1967) was produced by Roger Corman to follow up his huge hit
""The Wild Angels"" (1966), and in many ways it's a much superior film.  Start by
replacing the frankly wimpy Peter Fonda with N.Y.C. tough-guy, the Greek Bogart,
the short but scrappy John Cassavetes as motorcycle gang president Cody, and even
allow him to direct some scenes without credit.  Then increase the number of biker
outlaws from about twenty to over two hundred (so they say).  Feature good writing,
acting, direction, top Panavision lensing, some wacky humor, and maybe even a fuzzy
message about how official mishandling of a touchy situation can blow up into a
destructive riot, and you have yourself a real Drive-In Trash Classic.

Reckless biker Gage (Dub Taylor's boy Buck) accidentally runs over a ""citizen"" on
a curvy California street.  President Cody calls a meeting of the ""Skulls"" (so
named because they are boneheads).  His best buddy Joel-the-Mole (who sleeps in the
cockpit of a junked W.W. II bomber plane), the resident storyteller, spins the yarn
of Butch Cassidy and his gang hiding out from the law in a strategic canyon called
""Hole In the Wall."" By the Devil, says Cody, we're going to hightail it out to
Hole in the Wall, and spend our lives there without ""gettin' hassled by The Man!""

Along the way, the fun-loving boys (and some pretty mamas) riotously loot a food
shop on the highway.  ""We'll pay for it on the way back,"" Cody tells the outraged
owner.  A vacationing couple accidentally knock over a cycle, and the Skulls chase
them and put paid to their camper.  Then the horde roars into ""Brookville,"" which is
having its annual carnival and beauty contest, featuring the scrumptious Mimsy
Farmer.  The Skulls act obnoxiously but not lawlessly.  Nevertheless, the town
big-shots pressure big, tough sheriff Leo Gordon into banishing the gang out of
town to a riverside beach.

There follows the smoking of ""the best blend of domestic and Mexican weed"" at the
campsite, the claim of the rape of a naive local girl, and the ominous arrival on
the scene of 200 more cycle outlaws, the ""Stompers,"" who are hungry for some
""Razzle Dazzle,"" Californian biker-speak for ""the old Ultra-Violence.""  Even Cody
cannot control the degeneration into chaos which follows, resembling a Viking or
Hun invasion of medieval times.  One ponders how really fragile is our civilization.

Quite enjoyable is the outlandish attire of the Skulls and the Stompers, with lots
of animal skins, skunk hats, and Germanic helmets.  One big lummox named Robot,
who seemingly stepped out of ""Of Mice and Men,"" utters childlike observations, and
swings the big hammer with both hands for the ""Ding"" prize.  Cassavetes' actor pal
Maurice McEndree is amusing as the garrulous, hairy Joel-the-Mole.  Lovely Beverly
Adams from the Matt Helm movies, a very sexy Vietnamese dancing girl named Nai
Bonet, and the luminous Mimsy Farmer (who would later star in Italian ""giallo""
thrillers), are all delectable eye-candy.  There's pounding fuzz-guitar rock from
Davie Allan and the Arrows, and a Buddy Holly soundalike sobbing with compassion
""But when will they learn/angels can get burned/when they're Devil's A-A-Angels!"" over
the end credits.  If you want to see barbarous bikers besiege Brookville while
Vietnam was a-burning overseas, ""Devil's Angels"" is one helluva flick.",1321747200,16,3355,5.085766423357664

4852377,4,B005OK0YR0,"John Cassavetes was a Greek-American actor although many people thought he was Italian-American because of the roles he played. He was also a producer and a director who directed his wife Gena Rowlands in the 1980 movie ""Gloria."" In this Roger Corman film he played Cody, the president of a biker gang who takes over a town after the gang is falsely accused of raping a local girl. A mock trial is conducted of the sheriff and the mayor and eventually the town is torn apart by the gang members. At the end of the film, Cody doesn't like what he sees, takes off his colors and leaves alone. A great scene is the final scene when you see Cody driving on his bike alone with a squad of police car sirens going off on top of the bridge as Cody is driving under it. The plot is simple, the acting is fine, but John Cassavetes does a great job acting the part. This is not a not a great movie, and certainly not one of John's best, but it is an entertaining film so get the popcorn ready and the DVD playing.",1399420800,,1003,4.2020725388601035
4852378,5,B005OK0YR0,"Probably the best cycle gang movie that I have ever watched! There was actually somewhat of a plot to it and a message too.
Vignettes were hilarious and the dialogue just made me laugh so hard. I've already loaned it out to a couple of co-workers and
they thought it was wild too! Very glad that I purchased it! Recommend it to all who like cycle flicks!-PETE A",1395100800,,361,4.323529411764706
4852379,1,B005OK0YR0,I am sure that back in the 70's this was at best a B rated movie. Loved the bikes and the scenery,1392768000,,97,3.4545454545454546

4852381,2,B005OK0YR0,I give this movie two stars due to the poor acting and dialogue was poor even for is time. At times it was more like a dimwitted comedy. Only John Cassavetes good acting and charisma made this movie  worth watching.,1388188800,,215,4.375
4852382,5,B005OK0YR0,"Great transfer copy of this rare biker flick. Ratio perfect and color and sound crisp. Probably the best of all the biker flicks of the era. John Cassavettes as the leader of the Skulls MC is realistic for the times and you can see how he would use this pose in ""The Dirty Dozen"" as Franco. All around entertaining and HIGHLY recommended for collectors of the genre. Thank You",1373155200,2,376,4.463768115942029
4852383,5,B005OK0YR0,If you love old biker flicks from the mid to late 60's this flim is for you. It is my favorite biker flim of all time. this also had a soundtrack to it. This is a True outlaw movie complimented with a lot of fuzzed out guitar tone's.,1370563200,,233,3.875
4852384,3,B005OK0YR0,"I have no idea how many stars to give this. I hovered between three and four. If you're looking for a little known ""typical"" yet above average example of this genre, then this one will fit your needs. However it's not that great a movie and I would not recommend it unless you are curious about biker films or already enjoy them. (I collect them.) The story has a plot. The characters are somewhat sleazy but not too sleazy. The story has a resolution. There's a biker gang that rides around on motorcycles and looks for trouble as the protagonists, but they're not a full on bunch of raging sociopaths. Acting is not terribly great but not as bad as some. Lots of bongo dancing. No dune buggies or chimps. The sheriff is portrayed sympathetically along with most of the towns people.",1356825600,7,784,4.528169014084507
