I don't know of anything more recent that does a better job.  It is too bad that its owners have not brought it out on DVD.",1370390400,,248,4.040816326530612
7811138,5,6301285417,"This is without a doubt one of the best documentaries ever produced that reflects on the start of rock and roll.  It takes you on a journey that shows how rhythm and blues was given the cover name of rock and roll because the so-called black music with suggestive lyrics wasn't accepted by the parents of the teenagers during the 50's. It gives a great comparison from the original songs to the 'white' cover versions that were actually more successful in terms of sales.  e.g. Tutti Frutti by Little Richard and then Pat Boone.  Pat had a big hit and admitted later that his version was horrible.  Just listen and you'll agree.

The storyline is great and the clips are equally great.  This is the one documentary that tells it all.  I recorded it off of my local PBS station and have since transferred to DVD.  That's about all you can do because it has never been released on DVD as of this date.",1323129600,2,899,4.439024390243903
7811139,5,6301285417,"This is one of the best if not Thee Best documentary about 1950's American Rock music ever made.  It was made in the 1980's. It's very sad that it is not commercially available on DVD. The actual title of it is ""Rock and Roll: The Early Days""",1299456000,,242,4.148936170212766
7811140,4,6301285417,"I also teach a Rock History class and use this as an overview.  The footage is vintage, although I have much of the same from other sources.  It really is a shame that the Little Richard footage everyone uses comes from ""The Girl Can't Help It"" because he must have kicked some ass live and we don't get to see it.

You are led through the evolution of early Rock and Roll (not Rock)  by the year and the film seems to pick Chuck Berry as the main thread.  The footage of Fabian singing near the end is the best I have seen for explaining a Teen Idol, and Pat Boone gets the drubbing he deserves.  John Heard is the narrator, which is cool.

This is good for what it sets out to do: to reinforce the rhythm and blues origins of this music and the arrogance and malice of the musical powers of the day such as Steve Allen and Ed Sullivan.  These guys wouldn't have recognized the blues if they fell in it.",1093219200,,904,4.1257142857142854
