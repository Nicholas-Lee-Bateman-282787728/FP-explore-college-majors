8631905,5,B00HEM1LRS,"This is a documentary.  It isn't a concert DVD.  Basically it is intended for the music historian and the hardcore Clapton fan.

It covers Clapton's career from the breakup of Cream to the ""Backless"" album.  There are guest spots of significant people during this time including Bonnie Bramlett, Bobby Whitlock, ""Layla"" engineers, RSO engineers, a couple of British music critics, and George Terry (Clapton's backup guitarist from 1974 to 1979).

The documentary includes a large number of video clips from concerts from the period, but be aware, no entire songs.  Each clip is intended to back the ongoing dialogue, not to entertain with a Clapton concert.  There are some really interesting, rare clips here.

Personally, I have loved Clapton's music nearly as long as I can remember.  In the late 60s/early 70s, when other kids wanted to be astronauts, I wanted to be Eric Clapton.  Not only did a Cream-era poster of Clapton grace my wall, a ceiling poster of Cream graced my ceiling.

But seriously, Clapton's music from 1974 to 1980 is one of the disappointments of my life.  Here was among the greatest guitarists of his time, a man already so famous that he could record whatever music he wanted, spending the best years of his life creating commercial pop music.

But now, because of this documentary, I understand.  Sorry Eric.

Again, this isn't for someone wanting to see Clapton on stage playing full songs.  It is for the person interested in what and why Clapton did what he did during the 1970s.",1482537600,2,1511,4.866666666666666
8631906,2,B00HEM1LRS,I have order two of these now and each time there was an issue with the picture quality!! Other wise I would give it 5 stars....for 10 bucks it not worth all of the back and forth....,1418256000,3,183,3.972972972972973
8631907,5,B00HEM1LRS,"If you are a Clapton fan and want to look back at the 70's Clapton or re-expeience Clapton as he was redifining himself this well done.
I am a big fan of Eric's and had to watch this twice. Great interviews with his old band mates and producers. Needless to say, the music is great.",1415232000,4,282,4.1454545454545455
8631908,5,B00HEM1LRS,Awesome of course!  The extras are great....,1406332800,2,44,5.285714285714286
8631909,4,B00HEM1LRS,"Having recently watched the Eric Clapton 1960's Review DVD I was looking forward to the release of the next installment - the 1970's Review. This segment follows his path after Blind Faith, into Bonnie & Delaney and Friends, Derek and the Dominoes and the start of his solo career. Much like the first release, this material is primarily interviews with people directly involved either within the groups or reporting on the scene, and to a small extent Clapton himself, discussing their remembrances. The interviews from musicians who played with Clapton provide a wealth of information, and the music reporters provide their own interesting perspective.

So, if hoping for a two and a half hour 1970's Clapton music showcase, the DVD will be disappointing because it is mostly talk with a bit of music interspersed - no complete songs. And because the 70's decade is on the cusp of the music video as an integral part of a new music release, there is only an occasional live performance snippet from a concert or television appearance. This is a problem most evident in the first half of the 70's, so the second half definitely includes more actual performance footage rather than what amounts to an amalgam of video clips from often unrelated materials included for visual interest and perhaps in an attempt to capture the essence of the time period.

This decision appears to be in response to one of the most annoying problems with the 60's Review DVD --  the lack of synchronization between the videos and the music being played. Although understandable given the lack of video footage, it was still distracting and annoying. But, when faced with the same lack of visual material I am not sure if the decision to include largely unrelated film accompanying the music was a solution. Pictures of birds flying or random people dancing, staring at each other, etc. are disconcerting choices which often leave the viewer perplexed. If the purpose was to set the mood of the 70's, for me the effort fails. And, note, the videos do contain female nudity which, depending upon the viewer may be a plus or a negative.

If the weird video material is not distracting enough, the unrelenting intrusion of ""old timey"" film affectations plastered on shots of stationary material - album covers, still photographs, etc., is beyond comprehension. Seeing faux scratches running down the screen along with phantom hairs and spots of pretend film damage certainly added movement to an otherwise fixed item, but why treat the material as if it was originally from an old damaged celluloid news reel instead of stuff easily available in wonderful condition from any number of sources. This distorts the time period -- it is the 70's not the 20's. The ""treatment"" was intrusive and added a level of unnecessary phoniness to the project. The material stands on its own merits - no need to embellish.

People interviewed include: Bonnie Bramlett, Howard Albert, Ron Albert, Bobby Whitlock, George Terry, Willie Perkins, Nigel Williamson, Barney Hoskyns, Anthony DeCurtis and Marc Roberty, and all aided in fleshing out the story. And, to a lesser extent, some footage of previous Clapton interviews is also included.

The DVD paints a clear picture of a decade Clapton spent wrestling with addictions and exploring various music genres. The journey is depicted in a vivid manner, and, despite disagreeing with DVD style decisions, the material is worthy of the time and energy required to watch it. And the project most importantly, preserves the recollections and reflections of a number of the players while they are still around to interview.",1395360000,22,3628,5.01827242524917
