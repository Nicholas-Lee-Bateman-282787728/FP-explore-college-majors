Spoiler: there is a scene where ONE Grizzly is up against SEVEN+ WOLVES!

Warning: Somewhat gruesome and violent if you plan on watching with your kids.

Overall: AWESOME footage of Bear and Wolf fights. Lots of action in this one and the picture quality is very nice!

8404218,5,B003SF4G6S,"Clash Encounters of Bears and Wolves, is an interesting documentary about the competitive encounters between bears and wolves.  It is a very good movie that centers its story in Yellowstone Park.  It tells the story about the wolves from the Druid Pack. It shows mothers raising cubs, and plenty of everyday things they do to survive. Wolves do not attack grizzly bears that are too big for them to handle. But if bears are not big enough, wolves will attack, and seriously harm them. This documentary also describes how grizzly bears have more ways to get food than a wolf.

The next film on this disc is, White Falcon, White Wolf; It was also very interesting. It follows a White Arctic Gyrfalcon family, and a White Arctic Wolf family. The movie also covers a White Arctic Owl family, catching lemmings to feed its hungry owlets, and a Arctic Fox family. The movie continues to follow the white falcons again until the 3 chicks successfully leave the nest. An excellent movie that's, good to have in your nature collection.",1363996800,2,1026,4.752808988764045
