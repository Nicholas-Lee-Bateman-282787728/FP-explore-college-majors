8417423,5,B00063E796,"We found this video very helpful in our training.  The basic process of how to document processes in discussed, as well as a unique and innovative system to control paperwork.  It was exactly what we expected, real people applying Lean office principles in a real situation.  Previous reviewers seem a bit too critical, as this is only 10 minutes and is advertised as a virtual office tour (NOT a training program).  The DVD allowed us insights into how we can better manage our paperwork, as well as how we can organize our processes.",1242086400,,535,4.720430107526882
8417424,1,B00063E796,"This video is only 10 minutes long.  The presentation is dull and there are no explanations of how to make your office lean, only that the consulting firm selling the video has used lean techniques at least once to improve a front office operation.  My employees were not motivated after watching this.",1224633600,,302,4.788461538461538
8417425,1,B00063E796,"We were very disappointed in the DVD.  Very few concrete details presented and no before/after pix.  And the DVD did not run even 10 minutes.

$95 was way too much for this one.

Thanks,",1158105600,,186,4.382352941176471
8417426,5,B00063E796,"I was amazed of what was displayed at this location.  The virtual tour was a shining light to our organization.  Many departments could not understand how to apply Lean tools in their situations, other than the value stream mapping exercise.  This customer service group demonstrated an actual working Lean office with all the tools.  Toyota could learn from Ms. Knight!",1128124800,2,370,5.116666666666666
8417427,5,B00063E796,"This Lean Office video provided our administrative teams in sales, engineering, and marketing the impetus to improve.  By seeing all these Lean tools actually working in a company challenged us to also begin to more fully understand and apply Lean in our areas.  This video did it for us!",1125014400,,288,4.857142857142857
8417428,5,B00063E796,"I recently purchased Lean Office - It Can Be Done! and thought I was just going to see someone talking about Lean in the office. I was amazingly surprised! This video is a display of the Lean tools of 5S, Heijunka (Leveling), Standard Work, Pull, Kanbans, an sophisticated File System, along with Value Stream Mapping, Visual Controls, etc.  You can tell by the actual footage that Ms. Knight is truly ahead of her time in applying Lean Office principles in administrative settings.  This video demonstates excellent detail on a Lean Office - a model for every office.  An excellent training tool for any type organization that desires to use Lean in its continuous improvement activities.

Great work!",1123286400,3,702,4.9743589743589745
8417429,5,B00063E796,"I have searched for nearly two years to find well-documented examples of a Lean Office.  This video does it for me.  It gave our organization a vision of the future.  The examples of 5S, takt time, cells, heijunka, leveling, standard work, measurements, etc. are exemplary.  Eaton Aerospace, and Chris Knight and her Lean Office team, should be commended on setting the bar for administrative Lean offices worldwide!",1116460800,3,416,5.164179104477612
