6203336,1,B00HSJ2EEG,i can't bring myself to watch as the trailer turned me off it so badlyso lacklustre and dead flat and every cliche in the book..oh wee lone night i'll be desperateand watch...,1400284800,,175,4.5
6203337,4,B00HSJ2EEG,Awesome film - mixed reviews - glad I didn't listen to those who are afraid of subtitles - really; I get so lost in the action that I forget to even read them all the time.  Touching - well written - suspenseful story.  If you want a sophisticated spy thriller - during an evening at home with a nice wine and someone to cuddle - it will be well worth it.,1399680000,3,355,3.9859154929577465
6203338,4,B00HSJ2EEG,"In a world of slick dialogue, noise instead of plot development and catchy intense music to cover a movie's missing pieces, it was good to see people caught up in the impact of their decisions and wade through to the end.  To experience the safety of a man's arms strongly enough that it awakens someone's mind from a deadly poison is unique.  good acting, good writing, good silences. enjoy.",1399593600,,392,4.666666666666667
6203339,4,B00HSJ2EEG,"A bit overdone with the gratuitous overuse of cigarette smoking but otherwise well cast, acted and directed modern political spy drama.",1399420800,,135,5.476190476190476
6203340,3,B00HSJ2EEG,"OK, this film is well made, but it requires that you enjoy reading the WSJ on a regular basis, as this film assumes that you know what caused the Fall 2008 financial meltdown on Wall Street. This did not interest my wife as much, hence the 3 star rating.

If you do not know what the WSJ is or do not otherwise follow the international financial world, you may find this film a little hard to follow. Also, it is subtitled, but that part is done well.

I liked the film, my wife, not as much for the reasons given above.

6203341,4,B00HSJ2EEG,"There are a lot of beautiful languages and I love that this movie has Russian and French. Complete with actors and actresses that a known and unknown, so you focus more on the story. Plausible events with believable characters. Definitely worth your rental and time. MM",1398470400,4,269,4.869565217391305
6203342,5,B00HSJ2EEG,"This movie's intelligent and quiet, for the person who likes spy movies but not MI-3.  The plot is finely done, so long as you keep up with the subtitles (or speak French), and the actors are perfect.  Beautifully made movie and a real find--it's hard to find a good espionage movie that isn't just about the action, but about the people and their choices, and their compromises.  Strongly recommend.",1398038400,7,400,4.768115942028985
6203343,3,B00HSJ2EEG,"""I can't steal but I can still seduce."" Alice (De France) is a trader who is caught up in a deadly ring of money laundering. When a powerful Russian finds her and forces her to help him she meets Mose (Dujardin), a Russian operative. Her and Mose strike up a fast relationship both trying to hide who they really are from each other, but you can only hide the truth for so long. This is a hard movie to review, mainly because the plot was a little hard to follow, for me at least. It was really just a movie about a type of espionage triangle and you begin to question everyone's motives. It was pretty slow moving and went back and forth between french and english so if you aren't a big foreign movie fan that is your warning. This is a movie for a select group of people. For me it was a little too slow and predictable for me to fully get into. Overall, nothing that I would rush and see or see again. I give this a C+.",1397433600,4,923,4.076923076923077
6203344,5,B00HSJ2EEG,"Wow.  Rented because Tim Roth.  Stayed for the international espionage, double and triple agents and the overwhelming passion of a man and woman for each other.  This is a quiet film.  Not one explosion, no car crashes and not one drop of blood.  A spectacular sex scene with not one scream and no nudity.  Never would have guessed the ending and it brought a tear to the eye.

A truly twisting story with nary a clich, only the most essential of dialogue with no filler, no waste and very intimate direction.  A rare achievement in film.",1396396800,29,538,4.53125

6203368,4,B00HSJ2EEG,"Becomes increasingly compelling and tense as it unfolds. Solid performances coupled with just enough dialogue to capture the attention and curiosity made the film enjoyable to watch. I wanted to get it. Once I figured out what the hell was going on, it unraveled.
Mobius indeed",1473724800,,277,5.043478260869565
6203369,4,B00HSJ2EEG,"This French film with English subtitles is an espionage-love story in which each governmental agency is hurting its own people and other agencies and governments. It is in French with English and other subtitles. It focuses on money laundering and that all the characters do not know the true role that others they know have. The actors act well and the story has its twists and turns with some violence. As another reviewer wrote, those who understand money laundering will enjoy this film better, but, I might add, all who love love will love the film.",1466640000,2,554,4.78125

6203395,4,B00HSJ2EEG,"I really liked this movie.  Mostly subtitles though the actors do speak in English from time to time.  I have struggled a bit with the comparison of the Mobius strip to the plot...but I think I got it.  I am a big Tim Roth fan, though the casting seems to have been a weird choice with the explanation that this Russian oligarch was raised in Britain, speaks perfect Brit English but does not evoke a sense of a Russian hard-core criminal.

The lead Russian Spy guy did it for me.  I went looking for other movies with him.  The American hot bombshell did a good job...although as typical, has attitude coming out of her arse.  Spolier....the happy ending seemed a bit unrealistic....but it beat The Killing (season 4)....maybe not.",1407369600,,732,4.627906976744186

6203397,3,B00HSJ2EEG,"My rating is a 3.5.  The movie was too convoluted for its own good.  However, it is an interesting, suspenseful film. Plausible premise on the buying and selling thus upsetting of world markets. My question is the story  based on something that was reported in the papers in years gone by?  With the 1st viewing I had a hard time keeping up with the names, and code names of the principle parties.  The 2nd viewing made it all clear.  Believable chemistry between De France and Dujardin.  A bit of a stretch accepting Tom Roth as a Russian, yet, he is a good actor.",1405382400,,565,4.427184466019417

6203401,3,B00HSJ2EEG,"In the film's extras, the ever-chatty director claims that he was inspired by Hitchcock's Notorious and wanted to make an espionage film with a powerful love story at its core. Unfortunately, he didn't understand Hitchcock's brilliance as a meticulously focused storyteller. This movie's ludicrously convoluted and rambling tale of money-laundering, corruption among international oligarchs, and two secret agents falling for one another is brilliant only in the director's imagination. I give it three stars because of the thoroughly professional performances by Jean Dujardin, Ccile de France, and Tim Roth.",1402012800,4,609,5.853932584269663
