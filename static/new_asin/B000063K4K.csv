3522513,5,B000063K4K,I love this movie soooo much.  This is one of the few movies that make me tear up.  I bought this in 2007 and still watch it from time to time.  Salma Hayek was great in this movie.,1439251200,,181,3.710526315789474

Some of the sisters and husbands were jailed, but all and all most were killed. It was called the Parsley Massacre. It was a sad event, but those of you who are interest in Latinamerican history and film, this film is for you. The title, ""In the Time of the Butterflies"" as the ""butterflies"" come to harvest the parsley.

3522570,5,B000063K4K,"the movie left out a lot of details from the novel, so i suggest you read the novel first before watching the movie. the movie is more focused on minerva since she was the one that convinced people to fight against trujillo and his cruelties. mate and patria eventually joined minerva to stand up for their rights which ultimately lead them to pay the price in the end. the movie is basically just a brief summary of the novel so you may not find it too profounding, but it gives a nice visual effect of the mirabal sisters.",1317513600,,524,4.357142857142857
3522571,5,B000063K4K,"This movie chronicles the four Mirabal sisters and the Butterfly movement during the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo from the 1940s until 1960 when the four were murdered.

3522572,5,B000063K4K,"I watched this movie before a trip to the Dominican Republic.  The movie is very good, well produced and well acted.  It captures the period and very well tells the story of the Mirabel family, Trujillo and Dominican history.  I was so taken by the story that I decided to visit the town of Salcedo where the Mirabel family home has been turned into a museum and memorial.

About 1 hour from Santiago in a small bus I arrived in farm country and the town of Salcedo.  The entire town's identity is about the Mirabel sisters.  Beautiful murals decorate the town depicting the lives of the sisters and always with the theme of butterflies.  Just outside of town is the family home.  The grounds around the home have been beautifully landscaped and tours are a given through the home.  The family has lovingly preserved the home and you walk through seeing every detail of how this Dominican family lived in the simpler times of the 40s and 50s.  In each sister's bedroom are her clothes, her bed and personal treasures.

I was very moved by the movie...I fought back tears while walking through the family home.  The reality of how brave this family and these three women were was overwhelming.  That day I came to realize how important and universally revered the Mirabel sisters are to this Caribbean nation.  The Dominican 200 peso bill carries their picture.  Every Dominican child visits the family home on a school trip.  When I spoke to Dominicans of my trip to Salcedo they no longer looked at me as a tourist but, rather, a person who understood their country.

This was more than a movie for me and I highly recommend it.",1278720000,,1629,4.600694444444445
3522573,5,B000063K4K,"Usually the movie destroys the story the book had but not so with this version of In the Time of Butterflies.  Selma Hyak portrays one of the Mirabel sisters in their struggle to overcome the dictatorship of Truijllo(played by James Olmos) who rules the Dominican Republic with an iron hand.

While the ending is slightly different than the book; it adequately represented the essence of what really happened to the Butterfly Sisters.

I had read and enjoyed this book many years ago.  The movie acted a as a refresher for me in order that I can discuss the book at my book club with out having to reread the book. While this was my goal; I was very happily surprised that it gave me the opportunity to watch and enjoy a great movie.",1273363200,,733,4.488721804511278
3522574,5,B000063K4K,This is one of my favorite films on Latin America.  It contains a lot of historical information and is entertaining.,1267920000,,116,4.8
3522575,5,B000063K4K,"I ordered this for my classroom, needing it within a week.  It arrived in ONE DAY on a two-day shipping request.  Thank you!  My lesson plans are on schedule, and my students will enjoy this awesome documentary on the Mayan culture.  Great!",1256601600,,240,4.642857142857143
3522576,5,B000063K4K,"This book takes me back to when I was 9 or 10 years old and first heard about how Trujillo, the dictator that had just been assassinated, did away with the sisters just because, as they put it back then, one of them did not go along with his sexual advances. It was a story destined to be written and worthy of telling.",1252540800,,319,4.079365079365079
3522577,4,B000063K4K,"The video follows the plot and major details of the novel well. I use the movie for reinforcement after my high school classes read the novel.  Some producers/directors take liberties with films, adding or augmenting the original literary work, but that is not the case in this particular production.  As with most movies, however, portions of the novel are not represented in the film.

Salma Hayek and Edward James Olmos do not overpower their roles with their own personalities.  In fact, Olmos' portrayal of Rafael Trujillo was surprisingly credible.

I do not recommend this film for students younger than 15 because of the violence in the movie.

I highly recommend both the novel and the movie, however, for high school classes and adults seeking relevant literature created by Latina writer Julia Alvarez.  The movie's protagonists (the Mirabal sisters) demonstrate their religious fervor, patriotism, and family values. The  historic context and setting (Dominican Republic, 1920s, to the U.S., 1950s) and the rebellion against dictator Rafael Trujillo, coupled with themes of honor and human rights, makes this a 4-star film.

My classes read the book together and listened to portions of the audio book.  Students had tons of questions; they researched, shared, talked about family values, and eventually viewed the movie.  It was a terrific unit!",1238889600,,1358,5.299065420560748
3522578,3,B000063K4K,"As with many movies based on novels, this one falls far short of Julia Alvarez' written account of the legendary Mirabal sisters under Trujillo's Dominican Republic dictatorship.  Though I highly recommend the novel, probably as the best I've ever read, the movie doesn't begin to reach such heights.

The story is an important one, about Trujillo's dictatorship of the 1930s-1960s, during which some 30,000 innocent people were executed.  Edward James Olmos does a good job in the role of Trujillo.  Yet the story is somewhat choppy, the character development is weak, and the story line is lacking the depth and the emotion of the novel.  Whereas the novel stylistically develops the characters of all four Mirabal sisters in their own voices, the movie concentrates mainly on Minerva.

This story is one everyone should hear, but I strongly recommend the novel over the movie.  That said, having already studied the history to fill in the gaps, I do enjoy the movie.",1236124800,,969,5.01875
3522579,4,B000063K4K,"This movie was really interesting, it shows life for the people who live under a dictator. Very good acting in the part of Selma Hyak and Edward Olmos. Selma's character was that of a strong and determined woman.",1226275200,,212,4.605263157894737
3522580,5,B000063K4K,"Engaging film that brings to life the 1950s in Dominican Republic under the Trujillo dictatorship. The most ""useful"" line in the film suggests that Trujillo's goal is to whiten the population via ethnic cleansing.",1225584000,,213,5.294117647058823
3522581,5,B000063K4K,If your into history and culture than this is a great movie to watch or add to your collection. As a Dominican- American living in the USA it was great for me to see how my parents and my ancestors paved the way for me. The Genecide of Dominicans was cruel and real. A most see!,1223769600,,278,3.982142857142857
3522582,3,B000063K4K,"I love the story, the movie just wasn't as good as I had expected. Perhaps as usual the book is better.",1206057600,,103,3.9523809523809526
3522583,2,B000063K4K,"Trujillo was the brutal dictator of the Dominican Republic from 1931 until his assassination in 1960.  This movie is based on the novel of the same name written by Julia Alvarez.  To get a real picture and story of the regime and its impact on the DR people, read the book and pass on the movie which with feels like a Disney movie adaptation.  This movie highlights the role of the Mirabal sisters in opposing Trujillo's brutal rule albeit it really falls short of making you feel the universal fear, pain and suffering of the DR people during the time.  The sisters and their husbands and family members are jailed and tortured in their quest for justice and a better future for their family and their country.  It is hard to imagine (impossible) that Salma Hayek in her fine dresses and attire was a serious revolutionary against a Dictator who slaughtered 30,000 people during his reign.  This would be a good introductory ""light"" movie for those interested in getting a feel for the DR during the Trujillo times.",1204329600,,1017,4.685393258426966
3522584,4,B000063K4K,"A friend of mine who is also interested in History told me about this movie and I am glad I bought it. It deals with a real part of the Dominican Republic's History. Maybe it is not accurate, but it sticks to the fact that Trujillo was a cruel dictator in that country for many years, just as ""La Fiesta del Chivo"" (Vargas Llosa) did. Made in English for the American public, it misses the fact that the United States helped and sponsored all the dictators who ruled in Latin American and Caribbean countries at that time. Somoza in Nicaragua, Batista and those before him in Cuba, Pinochet in Chile, and Trujillo in DR, just to mention a few, were placed in power to protect American interests in those countries. The movie does not portray this fact which would have made it educational for that public.",1200960000,,805,4.52054794520548
3522585,3,B000063K4K,"I watched this movie recently with several family members and must say that considering the subject matter it left us feeling flat. The storyline is predictable, especially if you know the history of ""El Jefe"" or the story of the sisters and the mariposas(butterflies). Many people here at Amazon have done a good job of describing(beware of spoilers)the movie so I'll skip that part in this review. The story lines adapted from the book are weak, the characters only somewhat believeable but overall it is a shallow depiction of the ruthless regime of Trujillo. The black and white photographas in the beginning lend credibility to the story, are quite graphic, as are the torture scenes but otherwise the movie is luke warm; the action or suspense never heats up. Edward Olmos is good as Trujillo but there is not enough of him. His character seems almost benevolent, the father-like figure of the country who rules with a firm but gentle hand. If we could have seen more of his anger,his suspicion of others, his ruthless and vile conduct it would have been more interesting. Selma Hayek was very good and pretty much dominated the film. I agree with the another reviewer that more attention should have been given to the collective body of work of the sisters. Essentially this is one of those movies you might want to only rent rather than buy. There just isn't enough there to spend your money on. Recommended for movie buffs who like a little history based on a book that does a much better job of telling a story.",1197417600,,1521,4.7218045112781954
3522586,3,B000063K4K,"A fascinating time in history in a rare film treatment.  I look forward to when The Feast of the Goat finally makes it to DVD, North American region.  This film offers only fair performances from Selma Hayek and Edward James Olmos.  A long stay in a notorious prison by Selma Hayek somehow manages to have no effect on her drop dead looks and figure.  Still, it's a glimpse of an important time in American (not just U.S.) history that is little known to U.S. citizens.",1195430400,,469,4.482352941176471
3522587,2,B000063K4K,This is a poor adaptation of the book... I mean really bad. The book was great... this movie on the other hand is NOT worth buying.,1186531200,,131,4.076923076923077

3522592,1,B000063K4K,"Whether you have read Julia Alvarez's wonderful novel upon which this movie is based will not affect the level of enjoyment you will have with the movie---it is thoroughly terrible and fails on almost every possible level.

First, for people who have read the book, it utterly destroys the framework of the novel.  All of the strength of the Mirabal sisters is devastated by their wimpy portrayals onscreen here; Minerva seems less like a visionary rebel who will lead a nation and more like a clueless teenager who happened to follow the footsteps of a crush.  None of the other sisters get much screen time; in fact, Dede has a total of six lines in the whole movie.  Important plot lines were completely deleted while less-important ones were muddled and made ridiculous (such as Minerva's relationship with Sina).

However, for people who haven't read the novel, this movie must surely be twice as bad.  The pacing is horrendous, the music is flat and insipid, the direction is terrible, and the constant fading-in/fading-out (for the commercial breaks that originally came on when this movie aired) is very distracting.  What you have in this movie is a very weak effort by a director to cram 300 pages of material into 85 cheesy minutes.

A general rule of thumb when making an adaptation is delete, don't weaken.  If a book has 200 characters, you would cut out 190 of them and focus on 10.  This way, you will have 10 memorable characters and a tight story.  ""In the Time of the Butterflies"" takes the opposite approach---creating 200 really weak characters with a story that folds over itself in a sloppy mess.  Characters come and go like they were passing fads; there's a new character introduced roughly every 2 minutes in the movie.  Since the movie moves at a breakneck speed, you never have a chance to connect with any of the characters.  Even when the acting is at its best, it still doesn't come off as emotionally involving or important because there's just not enough time for you to care about what's happening.

I think the best way I can approximate the utter failure of this movie is to describe this analogy: it's like a child with severe ADHD trying to explain ""Schindler's List"" to you within 5 minutes.

If you want to really get a good story on the Mirabal sisters, I suggest you either wait until a GOOD director adapts the novel, or just go read Alvarez's work.  No matter who you are, you will be disappointed in this movie.",1114300800,,2456,4.687645687645688
3522593,3,B000063K4K,"IN THE TIME OF THE BUTTERFLIES was based on the book by Julia Alvarez and as the saying goes this book was much better than the movie.  There are key points left out of the movie, such as Patria's husband not wanting Minerva (Selma Hayek's character) to hide the guns on their farm.

Also compared to the book, the way Maria Teresa met Palomino was entirely different from the book.  Minerva was willing to let Maria Teresa stay with them but it was during her first night that Palomino entered with a shipment of guns.  In the movie however, Minerva throws Maria Teresa out and Palomino goes after her.  The wedding of Maria Teresa and Palomino was also left out.

Also, by the looks of the movie there were only three sisters.  There were FOUR.  Patria, Dede, Minerva, and Maria Teresa.  However the three shown were Patria, Minerva, and Maria Teresa.  What was left out was that Dede was also asked to join the revelution and does so reluctantly.

I was also not crazy about the way that the movie was narrated.  In the movie Minerva was narrating the story from solitary confinement but in the book Dede was narrating the story from a museum that she had set up in memory of her sisters.

The death scene also troubled me, I am reluctant to give away details for those who have not seen the movie so I won't get into it.

I can't recommend this movie to anyone, unless there is really bad weather and you've seen all the other movies in the local video store.",1113868800,,1463,4.430711610486892

3522595,4,B000063K4K,"From 1931 until his assassination in 1960, Rafael Trujillo (El Jefe) was the brutal dictator of the Dominican Republic, remaining in power with the silent acquiescence of a fearful church, the aristocracy, intellectuals, and the press.  Based on Julia Alvarez's strong novel of the same name, this film focuses on the role of the Mirabal sisters, known as ""las Mariposas"" (the Butterflies), in opposing Trujillo's brutal rule.  As children living comfortably in the country, the Mirabal sisters had been protected from the political dangers of the city.  When three of the four sisters, Minerva (Salma Hayek), Mate (Mia Maestro) and Patria (Lumi Cavazos) decide to go to a convent school in the city, leaving sister Dede (Pilar Padilla) behind, they are exposed for the first time to the realities of Trujillo's rule.
Some years later, Minerva, Mate, and Patria, now attractive young women, gain the unwelcome attention of El Jefe at a dance.  When Minerva slaps his face because he fondles her, he retaliates by arresting and torturing her father.  Vowing a personal revenge against him, Minerva eventually joins other students who work to foment rebellion--printing leaflets, distributing guns in the countryside, and speaking to women's groups.  When Mate and Patria eventually join her, the three become known as Las Mariposas, ""the Butterflies.""  Jailed and tortured when they are caught by Trujillo's army, they and their husbands hope that by their example they will make life better for their children and for their country.
Director Mariano Barroso sacrifices the broad scope and universal themes of the book by concentrating almost exclusively on the personal lives of ""las Mariposas,"" the risks they took, and the tortures they endured.  This narrow focus removes the Mirabal sisters from their political context and diminishes the sacrifices of thirty thousand other Dominicans who were executed by Trujillo.  Though the four sisters are clearly differentiated in the book and show the important and quite different reasons that people do or do not fight a dictator, here they are virtually indistinguishable from each other, another sacrifice of the broad picture in favor of easier myth-making.
Salma Hayek is gorgeous, even under jailhouse conditions, posing so attractively in her closeups that it is difficult to imagine her as a committed revolutionary.  Edward James Olmos, as Trujillo, alternately sneers and smirks but remains mostly an off-screen presence.  Several scenes of sadistic violence stir the emotions, but do not provide the catharsis of real tragedy.  Though it is admirable that Hollywood chose to memorialize ""the Butterflies,"" it is too bad that the film feels more like a Hollywood production than a memorial to the very real women who made such real sacrifices.

3522596,5,B000063K4K,"I Loved this movie; different content and effort to bring a part of the history of the first city of the new world, The Dominican Republic.  After I saw this movie, I was moved to research more abou the Dominican Republic and the Dictator Trujillo and I was amazed to know that this small Island located in the ""antillas"" is the cultural heritage of America, where the first university, Hospital, catedral of the new world ""America"" was founded.  Trujillo destroyed very important historical sites and used his brutal power over the Dominicans,torturing and planting the seed of terror and resignation in his own people; In my research I found that he used to have all the families to post a sign at the entrance of their houses that prays ""In this house Trujillo is the Boss"". The movie will not reflect the real misery that people lived, but the excellent work of consolidated actors make this film more interesting.  I loved the movie, the ""Trama"", as I never imagined that three sisters would have the courage and strenght to face an evil man and sacrifice in the name of Freedom and love to their motherland; I live and was born in a country of Europe and did not need to tras-culturized myself in order to understand a part of any other country's history.  I will give this Real life Story a 5 stars.  If you are a very well cultured person, you will love to discover a part of a distant island that have the pride to be the first in the best of ""America""s foundation.",1076457600,,1474,4.526315789473684
3522597,5,B000063K4K,"I appreciate the comments from other reviewers, especially those from the Dominican Republic, for whom this deeply moving story is a familiar one.  I ask them to consider, however, that for many viewers outside Latin America this story of the raw courage and self-sacrifice of the Mirabal sisters in opposing the brutal Trujillo dictatorship is virtually unknown.
For all the shortcomings mentioned below -- not being filmed in the Dominican Republic, plot of movie thinner than the book, etc. -- the film is an important introduction to a part of the common history of the Western Hemisphere.  It tells a compelling story about events with which even those of us who try to stay abreast of developments in Latin America may nonetheless have been unaware.
The portrayals of the two principal characters -- Selma Hayek as Minerva Mirabal and Edward James Olmos as Trujillo -- are of a very high standard indeed.  As other reviewers confirm, the film has inspired many who had previously known little of the Dominican Republic or of the Trujillo regime to delve further into the history and politics of this period, and in particular to learn all they can about the remarkable courage of the Mirabal sisters.
Like another neglected masterpiece -- Michael Verhoeven's ""The White Rose"" (""Die Weisse Rose""), which recounts the similarly selfless (almost reckless) courage of Hans and Sophie Scholl in leading a resistance movement against Hitler at the University of Munich in the 1940s -- this film tell a compelling story of resistance against hopeless odds and an almost incomprehensible personal courage.  Despite a few minor weaknesses, ""In the Time of the Butterflies"" is a compelling film that greatly deserves to be seen by a wider audience (and the modest cost of this excellent DVD allows that to happen).
My one reservation is that -- particularly since both Selma Hayek and Edward James Olmos are a joy to listen to in the Spanish language -- it is a pity that no Spanish language sound track was included (there are only subtitles in Spanish).  Perhaps MGM will do us the favor of reissuing this important DVD in a dual-language format, with both principal actors speaking their roles in Spanish?  (One would think that the Spanish-speaking market for a film with these two very popular Spanish-speaking actors would be at least as great as the English-speaking one.)
In any case, it is clearly a distortion for a film like this, with a compelling theme on a neglected and important episode of recent history and with two fine actors in the principal roles, to be given only one or two stars, when the latest special-effects driven vapidity from the major studios typically receives four or five.  Very strongly recommended.",1075507200,,2732,4.991208791208791
3522598,4,B000063K4K,"Some people say that this movie was nothing but ""hollywood fluff"". I beg to differ, and I use the word ""beg"" in all it's true meaning. I never knew of the Mirabal sisters, but after watching this film I felt moved. This film made me want to learn more of them. Their sacrifices and all that they endured could never fully be represented on film. But I feel that this movie at least gets the ball rolling for all of us out there who didn't know of the Mirabal sisters. After watching this film, I wanted to know more of them. This film made me want to educate myself. Only 10 mins after first watching this film, I felt compelled to research more and find out more. If a film can do that for someone who knew nothing, then it is a success.",1073260800,,738,4.1678321678321675
3522599,1,B000063K4K,"I decided to purchase this DVD despite the negative reviews I read about it. I'm very dissapointed with this movie. It makes Trujillo's reign seem benign. Does not really show the fear of those who lived in that time, and more importantly, made the Mariposas look like whining instigators. I read Julia Alvarez's book, and have read as much as possible about life during this time in the Dominican Republic.
I also have first hand accounts of what it was like from family members who lived in the country during that time and even exhiled in other countries as a result of this. This movie does not even come close to portraying any of this.",1064966400,,641,4.582608695652174
3522600,5,B000063K4K,"I recently watched the film In the Time of the Butterflies, and thought it was excellent.  Of course the book was better in that it was much more in depth, but I still think that the film captured the essence of the book.  Salma Hayak was superb.  I read the book several years ago, then recently I re-read it. So that I could see where the movie differed from the text.  My girlfriends and daughter saw the film first, then read the book.  What they said to me was that the film was so moving that it made them want to read the book! We all cried at the end.  I would highly recommend this DVD.  I would also recommend purchasing the book.",1064448000,,640,4.154471544715447
3522601,1,B000063K4K,"I must say that after watching the movie I was really disappointed.  I read the book a couple of years ago and the book made such an impact on me that it inspired me to learn more about the country that my parents were forced to leave behind at a young age.  The Mirabal sisters are from my hometown in the Dominican Republic and they are considered martyrs in their own right.  The day of their death, November 25, is a holiday in the Dominican Republic; it is celebrated with commemoration ceremonies, memorial services and school assemblies.  I was disappointed with the movie because it played more like a fictional story, rather than a work of reality.  I was watching the movie with some friends that have no knowledge of the Dominican Republic and I had to explain so many things from actual history and from the book that were not part of the movie.  I felt that In the Time of the Butterflies (the movie), was pure fluff.  Historically it made no sense whatsoever and Trujillo didn't seem that bad.  It was not really explained why it was that Trujillo had it in for Minerva Mirabal in particular and how her sisters, Patria and Maria Teresa, were involved, but more or less were just casualties by association. Also, let's be honest, Marc Anthony's character was not that important, so why does he appear on the cover of the DVD case instead of the other two sisters or even Trujillo himself.  Bottom line, if you want to learn anything about the Dominican Republic do not watch this movie...  It is clearly a product of Hollywood trying to diversify itself by putting all the Latinos it can find in a movie about a place that they have no real knowledge about.",1058227200,,1671,4.54
3522602,3,B000063K4K,"I am totally unaware of Julia Alvarezs novel.  Thus, I can only evaluate what I see on the screen.  Salma Hayek fails to bring Minerva Mirabal to life.  We are instead presented with a cardboard character lacking depth and complexity. The same thing essentially holds true for Edward James Olmos interpretation of the evil Dominican Republic dictator, Rafael Trujillo.  I am utterly convinced that few superb films can be produced in anything less than three months time.  Sadly, Butterflies comes across as a low budget film that had to be finished within a few weeks.
The three Mirabal sisters (nicknamed the butterflies) were leaders in the fight against Trujillo.  They were raised in a solidly middle class during the late 1930s and atypically received an education denied to most women of their era.  Minerva apparently was the very first female to earn a law degree in her male chauvinist and reactionary social milieu.  We observe her growing political interest---and this is where the movie truly fails.  Minerva Mirabal was obviously not a pacifist adherent of Mahatma Ghandi.  Still, we never clearly learn whether she was an outright Communist or a devoted liberal democrat.  Would she have helped her nation gain its independence, or naively doom it to become a totalitarian dictatorship similar to Fidel Castros Cuba?  There is no doubt but that the eventually murdered sisters were courageous idealists.  Nonetheless, were they wise and prudent?  These issues are left hanging and never adequately resolved.  I also wish Butterflies had dealt more fully with the allegations that Trujillo pursued a policy of genocide concerning those with with darker skin.  Was he an admirer of Adolph Hitlers pseudoscientific racial purity doctrines?  Such a provocative theme certainly deserved more than a brief remark.
I can only give Butterflies three stars and thats being very generous.  Hopefully, this story will be retold in the very near future.  I know that I will be among the very first in line if this indeed ever occurs.",1057795200,,2036,5.115151515151515
3522603,4,B000063K4K,"Not a bad movie at all. It is slow moving and none of the characters are complex at all. Marc Anthony is in the beginning and Olmos does a great job inspiring fear. Salma I supposed was needed to make it a movie- which is sad. She is just as passionate as she is in Frida. Not much of a difference between her acting in both films.
This film is from the Alvaro book, and I have not read it yet, but for those that have not read the book, this film is a great introduction to the horror in the Dominican Republic during that time period. There is some suspense in the film, because you think Salma as the main character dies in the jail since flashbacks are made to it the whole time, but there is a twist. A tearjerker and a powerful small film. It's really not that bad and for a great price!",1057449600,,793,4.057324840764331
3522604,2,B000063K4K,"Adapted from the novel by Julia Alvarez about the three Mirabel sisters who were murdered by the Trujillo regime in the 1950s Dominican Republic, this 2001 made-for-TV-movie attempts to tell the story. I read the book several years ago and found it excellent.  However, this film is rather thin and misses the richness of the story in several ways.
The film focuses on just one character, Minerva Mirabel, and that is one of its weaknesses.  There were actually three sisters who were murdered and each one of them has her own complex story that is just hinted at in the film.  Also, there was one sister who survived and her story is important too.  But perhaps the limits of constricting a story into a tight time frame forced this abbreviated version.
Salma Hayek is the star and she does do a fine job.  The wicked regime seems awful.  But I just couldn't feel the emotions that were intended by the author.  Of course it's a sad story; it's supposed to be.  And, because of a wide TV audience, it probably reached a lot of people with its message of these heroic women who became martyrs for their cause.",1051920000,,1109,4.565656565656566
3522605,3,B000063K4K,"After I finish reading the book ""In the time of the Butterflies"" of Julia Valdes I thought, Why this amaizing story is not converted in a movie? Then I learned about this movie so I bought it from Amazon. This have an special meening to me because I am Dominican and since I was a child I heard about the Miraval sisters and how they were killed. But the book is way better than the movie. The character of Minerva Miraval played by Selma Hayek did not achived the expected gold, the character in the book is more powerful defined. The Trujillo play by James Olmos started to look like the real Trujillo at the end of the movie but in grneral it was ok. The film although looks like Dominican Republic is filmed in Vera Cruz Mexico, and the extras used did not look Dominicans which did not fit with the reality, looking more like a mexican sopopera. Most of the places represented in the movie are still almost intact in the Dominican Republic and is a chame they were not used. So for me this movie was a Dominican story without the real Dominican flavor. But any way was a good try. At least it let the world know about a part of our history and the way the Dominican people suffer in that era to achived there freedom.",1042502400,,1222,4.294372294372295
3522606,5,B000063K4K,"In the Time of the Butterfiles is unto now the best movie of Salma, Hayek shines in the screen with a great performence. The movie is an excellent way to let people know the sadlly story of the Mirabal'sisters",1025222400,,209,4.384615384615385
3522607,4,B000063K4K,"A fine, ""minor"" movie, with major themes. It is about resistance to a dictator, a woman's (and women's) liberation, and about the real meaning of what loss of freedom in a society means. Directed by Mariano Barrroso, the movie, spanning almost three decades, chronicles the life of a resistance movement leader, Minerva Mirabal (Salma Hayek), in the Dominican Republic, and her various confrontations with dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo (Edward James Olmos), who ruled that island nation with an iron hand from 1930 till his assassination in 1961. The movie focuses on his obsession with her and his attempts over many years to make her his mistress, bent on revenge when all his attempts prove futile. The movie implies that it was his frequent practice to visit the country, pick a young woman that filled his ""eye,"" and then entice her to his palace for a dance. Many young women were thus impregnated and packed to Miami or other resting place afterwards. Minerva has the courage to resist, thus paying the price--her father's murder, and the imprisonment of her and her sisters. Miranda becomes the leader of an underground freedom movement under the code-name ""the butterfly."" Eventually, she is assassinated by his thugs, her sister and herself beaten to death with clubs. Her death is annually celebrated in Latin America, as a ""violence against women"" theme.
Tense, well-acted, enjoyable and horrifying, ""The Times of the Butterflies"" is a minor masterpiece, and an inspirational story, very much worth watching, despite the pan-and-scan format of this DVD.",1021075200,,1569,5.181102362204724

It seemed in the book that Trujillo had some relationships with girls in the convent where the sisters and their friends attended school and lived that didn't seem to really have a presence in the movie.  Other than that, I think that the movie made it easier to imagine what the book was trying to tell.  I had purchased the book for my daughter (10 years old) to read for an AR test, so I watched the movie together with her before taking the test.  It was too high a level for her, so she did not pass the test.  She says that she enjoyed the movie though.  I'd try it for maybe a 12 to 15 year old better if they're trying to have the AR test for this novel.",1495670400,,799,4.018987341772152
