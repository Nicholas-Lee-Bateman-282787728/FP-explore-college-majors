Not a beginner workout, but something anyone can work up to or use the provided modifications for when necessary. I also like the available option to scramble the workout . Paul Katami has great energy and a matter of fact attitude about working hard.",1488585600,,319,4.818181818181818
8558922,5,B00AXMHKCQ,"Did complete workout yesterday for first time...very intense,not for beginners. The moves are not complicated,and can easily be modified. I feel sore today, so it really worked me over. It's prob 85% hiit cardio and 15% weights. Recommend",1469750400,,238,5.2894736842105265

8558924,4,B00AXMHKCQ,"This workout consists of five blocks of four, one-minute exercises alternating between cardio, legs, arms, and core. Each block is repeated twice for a total of ten cycles. It is a tough work out, but modifications can be made. Much of the leg training involves fusing cardio and body-weight exercises. I would prefer slower, weighted leg work like on some of his other DVDs. In fact, on those days I'm not feeling as energetic, I'll substitute his minute intervals of leg work with weighted squats and lunges. Brings down the cardio factor a bit, too, which is nice for those off days. But done as is, this workout will test your cardiovascular endurance. I prefer his Hollywood Hardball and Hollywood Bootcamp workouts to this one, but all in all, you can't go wrong with a Katami workout. They are tough!",1404864000,4,807,4.771428571428571
8558925,5,B00AXMHKCQ,"Good work out. I did the workout for a week, but to be honest it didn't stick with me. I can't say it is bad or that the instructor is bad; if recorded well, the instructor is great, just the whole way it is set up with the group of people it didn't do it for me.

I got a good work out but will stick to what I like.",1404691200,,317,3.5285714285714285
