4320538,5,B004BSWC4Y,I love the Giants and I loved this video!  Any Giant's fan would.  I'm actually thinking of buying it for some friends of mine as gifts.,1303776000,,136,4.1923076923076925
4320539,4,B004BSWC4Y,"The documentary was a bit short in length of time considering it covered the entire season from spring training to the World Series Championship.  Would of been complete if the entire ""Parade"" was placed on it with the other DVD extras.  Overall, it was a great DVD.",1296518400,,266,4.638297872340425
4320540,3,B004BSWC4Y,"I was expecting an explosive DVD covering the whole SF Giants season & postseason crammed into this DVD. Instead the DVD sped through the whole season and various nail-biting moments in the post season were left out. Dont get me wrong I enjoyed the DVD but there were many clips that should have been in this DVD. Awesome post season highlights were no where to be found! The Games against the Braves & the Phillies could have had way more coverage! There was hardly anything! I felt so cheated. Even the World Series highlights were dull! The extra footage seems to have just been tossed into this DVD without much thought, bit of a disappointment.

So many great moments are missing from this DVD yet I still found it fun to watch (while replaying the missing highlights in my head). Either way Congrats SF Giants! Let's make another run at it!",1295913600,2,846,4.602649006622516
4320541,4,B004BSWC4Y,A good review of the SF Giants championship season.  I think most of the important highlights of the season were captured.  A good collectible for any SF Giants fan to have.,1295654400,,173,4.548387096774194
4320542,2,B004BSWC4Y,"I am sorry to say that this DVD, which covers the entire wonderful 2010 season of the San Francisco Giants baseball club, has terrible production values and never should have been released in its current form.  Shockingly, there is no usable table of contents. You have to start at the beginning and watch the entire 75-minute main feature, with no ability to pinpoint particular segments.  In addition, you can't select specific bonus segments for targeted viewing, even though the bonus part of the disc does have a separate table of contents.  Here, the pointer simply does not work.  These failings are inexcusable at this late date.

I also found the editors' priorities curious, to say the least. The entire NLDS series against the Atlanta Braves, for example - four extremely close, thrilling games - is covered in about 1 minute.  By contrast, the bonus items include a 5-minute segment devoted to each of about 12 pitches of Matt Cain getting the final out of his 1-hit masterpiece during the regular season.  Sure, I'm glad to have the Cain material, but the NLDS is much more important, and should have been given more space.  Even the key National League Championship and World Series games are given remarkably cursory coverage, with the stupid Aubrey Huff ""thong"" story seemingly given more attention than the epic clinching game against the Phillies.

This DVD does include good footage of the many unforgettable moments of the season, and therefore it is a must-have for all serious Giants' fans.  But it is a big disappointment nonetheless.",1293148800,13,1557,4.976833976833976
4320543,3,B004BSWC4Y,"I must say I'm a bit disappointed about the playoffs coverage in this DVD. I remember many great moments in the playoffs and I was hoping they would be covered. But the playoffs coverage is so short that most of those moments are not included. For example the Braves series is barely covered. They mention the Lincecum 14 K's in game 1 and that's about it. I expected to see the Giants coming back from the dead in game 3 with 2-outs 2-strikes in the top of the 9th to win the game. That was so dramatic and I couldn't believe it was left out along with many other exciting moments.

The regular season coverage is OK.

The bonus items were random. I liked the walk-off games and Huff's inside-the-park home run but overall the selections were pretty random and I couldn't understand why some of them even made it to the DVD.

I was glad they had kuip as the narrator.",1293148800,4,868,4.345679012345679
4320544,4,B004BSWC4Y,"Info from the Back Cover:

""Narrated by Duane Kuiper.
1 Disc / Approx. 1 hr. 16 mins. total

From the April Home Opener to the glorious November Victory Parade, this team was bonded by a trust - a belief - dare we say: The Magic Inside.

The team-first attitudes of veterans and newcomers-alike blended with the positive style of manager Bruce Bochy to create a superb and sustaining chemistry.  AT&T Park overflowed with waves of orange-and-black devotees throughout the year - hoping beyond hope that their Giants would bring them the first World Series title in San Francisco history.  Often it was tortuous.  But always it was magic.

From the homegrown pitching to the rookie sensation behind the plate... from the key in-season acquisitions to the been-there-done-that approach of veterans, these Giants were on a mission.  They staged a September rally to win their division - they surpassed Atlanta and the reigning NL champion Phillies in a succession of nail-biting playoff games - and once in the World Series, they silenced the powerful Texas offense with one pitching gem after another.

The Magic Inside tells the wonderful story of this historic Giants season through exclusive interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, game action highlights, and inside access to the parade.  The spectacular story of the 2010 San Francisco Giants is indeed all about The Magic Inside.

Bonus Material Includes: NL West Division Clinch Celebration, Lincecum's 13-Strikeout Game, Last Out of Cain's One-Hitter, Sanchez's 12-Strikeout Game, Walk-off Wins, Uribe's 2-HR Inning, Posey's First Home Run, Sandoval Home Run Into McCovey Cove, and much more.""

My Thoughts:

The Magic Inside is a more in-depth documentary on the San Francisco Giants' regular season run to the Playoffs (it kind of glosses over the World Series, but you can get that on the other MLB DVDs available for the 2010 WS).  This documentary focuses a lot on the players themselves, showing highlights of key moments that illustrate the journey of the team.  Interviews where coaches, commentators, and players speak about the influence and atmosphere individual players and the team as a whole had throughout the season.

Some of the DVD Content:

- Spring Training
- Regular Season Begins & Opening Day
- Lincecum & his 2nd Cy Young Award
- Pablo Sandoval
- Matt Cain
- Buster Posey
- The team as a whole during the first half of the season.
- Bruce Bochy
- Brian Wilson
- Lincecum's slump in August
- Cody Ross
- ""The Race Down the Stretch""
- Pitching
- Offense
- ""The Final Weekend""
- Aubrey Huff
- Series against the Padres for the NL West
- Series against the Braves
- Series against the Phillies
- World Series
- Victory Parade in San Francisco

I hope Amazon gets this DVD in stock, it's wonderful.  Wonderful narration, insightful interviews, and a great montage of highlights.

A few things that I wish were better:  The documentary tried to cram everything in 50 minutes.  I wish they took more time on each of the Playoff Series, it seems so short (it only spends maybe 3 to 5 minutes for each series).  But I guess that why the MLB also produced the two other World Series DVD Sets (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2010-San-Francisco-Giants-The-Official-World-Series-Film/dp/B003XL6EKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2010 San Francisco Giants: The Official World Series Film</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-San-Francisco-Giants-2010-World-Series-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0042EJDDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The San Francisco Giants 2010 World Series Collector's Edition</a>).",1292630400,15,3655,5.520646319569121
