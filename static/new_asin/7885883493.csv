I'm glad to have finally seen it.  It was nice to see Liberace in his only movie role.  Just a nice entertaining story.",1313884800,3,294,3.9152542372881354
1140450,5,7885883493,"I really love this movie.  The man is a great pianist and entertainer.  The movie was a movie fit for its time.  I have my moments when I want to watch ""old movies"" and this is definitely one of them.  I hope they release it on DVD again.  I missed the boat on this one.  I have it on VHS.",1291507200,8,289,3.7333333333333334
1140451,4,7885883493,"I know, I know-----Liberace was indeed a terrible actor----or maybe he had a bad director?  Not unheard of, you know-----I saw Alec Baldwin in a terribly acted movie (for him) in his early years so it can happen to anyone----but the music Liberace plays in this movie is well worth the price of admission----even at today's prices---the Tchaikovsky concerto and the boogie-woogie at the nightclub are wonderful to watch----I always liked to watch that little boy, too---wonder what happened to him?",1281312000,3,498,5.148148148148148

7900495,4,7885883493,Bought this for my husband who just adores Liberace and he plays it a lot!  Excellent purchase and well worth buying!,1367452800,,117,4.571428571428571
7900496,2,7885883493,"I sat down to watch this expecting to mock it for being wooden and mawkish, but instead of laughing at it, I found it to be better than I expected, so I'm inclined to review it fairly positively.

You can't escape the fact, though, that it really is simply a vehicle for Liberace, and at 115 minutes long, it outstays its welcome. The extra bloat is all down to prolonged sequences of Liberace playing the piano, which naturally are there to showcase his talent but they really grind the pace of the film to a halt. The story is uncomplicated: Liberace plays a pianist who suddenly loses his hearing which changes his life in more ways than expected.

Although Liberace does not have much range as an actor, he does impart some sense of emotion as his life changes. Not a lot, but some. And with him are some more seasoned actors who all acquit themselves fairly well. It's a shame that the story did focus on the plot more than the piano playing, although to see it for the story one could always watch ""The Man Who Played God"", an earlier film that this is a remake of.

So basically if you like Liberace as a performer, you could enjoy this. Even I, while getting bored during most of the lengthy concert sequences, did enjoy his ""Boogie-Woogie"" set piece, and I could see how his fans found him to be an entertaining performer. But for anyone watching for the story, it's too melodramatic and preachy in too many places to really draw you in.

Probably more of a curiosity piece than anything else, but as I said at the start of the review, it is not a total failure, and actually does stand up as moderately entertaining piece of schmaltz. I was able to buy the UK Region 2 DVD which is a lot less expensive than the Amazon.com far eastern import, although the UK Orbit Media DVD is not great quality, it's in full screen and with faded colours and a blurry image. However it is cheap!

7900497,5,7885883493,"I saw this film as a youngster; and, being a pianist was enthralled with Liberace. I never thought he was as good as Oscar Levant; but, he knew how to wow an audience - even in his old 30-minute TV shows. Others would probably not rate this as high for a couple of reasons: 1) The story is kind of sappy and 2) It was shipped from Japan with Japanese lettering all over the front. However, I had been searching for this film for years and since the disk itself WAS in the original English I didn't mind at all.",1360886400,,510,4.11
7900498,2,7885883493,"The story isn't bad, but the quality of this DVD is. It was bought from overseas through Amazon. It looks grainy but as the seller said, it is the only version on DVD. Dorothy Malone co-stars in it and Liberace shows his piano talent like nobody else could do. His Museum in Las Vegas finally closed down. I was glad to be one of the last visitors to see it.

NOTE: Since this review, Warner Bros. has released it. But, I sent it back for exchange because it was a bad transfer and freeze framed at the end. I hope Warner Bros. does it right. Liberace wasn't appreciated by people in the fifties, when he had his TV show. They could tell he was gay, and overlooked his talent. But, today things have changed and you can enjoy the Warner Bros. version, if they get it corrected. Too bad his museum in Las Vegas has closed. But, young people today do not know who he was and I guess don't care. He was Mr. Showbusiness.",1360368000,,917,4.24
7900499,5,7885883493,This is one of my favorite movies and I'm so glad I could get it on DVD. The quality is great. I'm very satisfied. Smooth transaction. Very quick shipping time. Don't hesitate with this one.,1338076800,,190,4.457142857142857
7900500,5,7885883493,"i'm not going to say this is the greateset film transfer in the world, but it was decent. the colors were washed out and definition faded, but there were very few scratches or broken reels. it was a pretty good print and this classic of 50's nostagia is impossible to obtain anywhere at this moment. the film is made availiable by a Chinese distribution company that owns a print, but you have the option to remove the subtitles.
  this is a must for any Liberace fan that wants to own a copy of this engaging 50's nostagia classic. at least untill Warner Bros. decides to release a restored and remastered print of this.
  Liberace is just great in this and gives a underrated performance as tortured pianist. Liberace is a very good actor after all. this movie is also overflowing with Liberace's music and his personal brand of homey sentimentality. this is a delight for any fan who can't wait for a major release of this.
  for what it is, the presentation is not bad. and it will do more than suffice for the long waiting and impatient. buy it.",1329523200,5,1050,4.5
7900501,5,7885883493,"The day I got this movie, I watched it. Haven't seen it since I was a young girl, and I am now a nana. This is such a special movie. I have seen it several times since I got it. thanks a million",1320278400,,194,3.5348837209302326
