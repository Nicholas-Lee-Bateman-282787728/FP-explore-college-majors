1745623,2,B00006FDF1,"This is a very uneven movie, especially from an acting standpoint.  Tom Berenger and Luke Perry have moments in which they seem to be asleep while acting, but then are just fine at other points.  Burt Reynolds is woefully miscast.  Adam Storke and Michelle Forbes are fine throughout, though.  As for the story, it is a mishmash of just about every Western cliche you can think of, none of which pay off very well, as the movie comes to a flat conclusion.  Still, there are occasional flashes of inspiration, so if you're a die-hard fan of either Westerns or writer Larry McMurtry (who adapted the screenplay), then this might be worth a look.",1059177600,6,643,4.654867256637168
1745624,1,B00006FDF1,"DO THE WORDS 'HOSS APPLES' MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?
DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE. MISCASTING AT ITS WORST. LACKLUSTER SCRIPT, AND POORLY PLAYED PARTS. IM SURPRISED TOM BERENGER WHO, IS AN EXCEPTIONAL ACTOR WASTED HIS TIME ON THIS ONE. THE SCENES WITH HIM ARE TOLERABLE BUT THEY CANT MAKE UP FOR AN OTHERWISE UNREALISTIC HALF STAB AT A WESTERN.
IT IS A SHAME TO TAKE AN HISTORIC EVENT AND MAR IT LIKE A BAD PAINT JOB.
THIS ONE PLAYS SLOW BUT NOT TRUE. THE PROFANITY IS OVERLY EXCESSIVE AND IT IS OBVIOUS THAT MOST OF THESE PREPPIE ACTORS HAVE NEVER SAT A STEED OR FIRED A GUN FOR REAL.
THERE IS LITTLE BELIEVABLE ABOUT THIS ATTEMPT AND I CANT IN GOOD FAITH RECOMMEND IT.
WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT.",1044662400,9,695,4.395348837209302
1745625,4,B00006FDF1,"I enjoyed this movie very much. It's a solid western with a decent plot and is well-paced and well-cast. Three brothers try to keep their land while big ranchers do everything evil and devious they can to drive the smaller ranchers out. There is a certain amount of brutality and tragedy along the way.
The three Hammett brothers (Tom Berenger, Adam Storke and Luke Perry) are all good in their parts. I especially liked Adam Storke as the sweet but somewhat wishy-washy Dale. His relationship with fiesty wife Michelle Forbes (now seen on ""24"") is complex. She browbeats and adores him, yet privately admits to Berenger's character that she really prefers him over her husband. (Hmmm...an interesting wrinkle in their story.)
Luke Perry plays the youngest brother, Harry, who is turning into somewhat of a wastrel. I never saw much of Perry prior to this, since I steadfastly avoided watching the ""Beverly Hills"" series that brought him his fame. I never thought much of him before, but I was pleasantly surprised at how good he is in this part. His romance with a lovely young widow is, however, underdeveloped and I think this was a definite flaw in the story.
Tom Berenger (as Cain Hammett) is clearly the oldest brother of this trio. Berenger's developed quite a good reputation for doing outstanding Westerns and historical dramas, so he's a wise choice for this movie as well. He's always an excellent actor and does well in this role. His character is sympathetic, brave and self-sacrificing and you can't help but empathize with him.
Also excellent are Rachel Ward as a toughened but likeable prostitute, Christopher Cazenove as a foppish British rancher, and Burt Reynolds as an evil villian.
This is a perfectly competent western. Incredible scenery, a good cast and a well paced story make it worthwhile to see.",1039996800,26,1823,4.922077922077922
1745626,4,B00006FDF1,"When I saw this title come up as a ""pre-release"", I had to check the movie data bases to see what it  was all about. It is based on a book called ""Riders of Judgement"", which is, in turn, based on actual historical events involving rich land hungry bad guys and small ranchers, farmers and homesteaders, who, in reality, were not quite the good guys you see in this film. It is really well written, acted and filmed, and it never drags, despite the nearly three hours that it runs. Luke Perry and Tom Berenger are the brothers who try to resist the efforts of the rich members of the ""Cheyenne Social Club"" to run them off their ranches. The film script was written by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, and what a fine job they did. Berenger, an actor who generally delivers a good performance is realy in top form here, as are most of the cast. Casting Burt Reynolds as the bad guys' hired gun/corrupt marshal is the only weak element in the cast; I find his work overall to be generally light weight, and here, he isn't a ""bad"" enough villain. The original TV rendition was a Hallmark work, which is usually a plus for me because those folks take their sponsorship seriously, and the transfer to DVD is first rate, including some spectacular scenery. If you like a good adventure film, you can't go wrong here.",1033171200,52,1311,4.4625
1745637,5,B00006FDF1,"Good meaty western that doesn't have the usual ""Hollywood"" ending. No one rides off into the sunset, but the bad guys get theirs in the end. A few stereotypes, but not so many as to drag down the plot or slow it down. Tom Berenger was excellent as always, even Burt Reynolds [with his latest facelift] plays a real stinker of a baddie. This is one western to add to your collection.",1478304000,,382,4.319444444444445
1745638,1,B00006FDF1,"So much wasted talent went into this film.  This is the only movie with Tom Berenger that I've not been able to enjoy.  I'm surprised Larry McMurtry could have been even partially responsible for something so cartoony.  As many other reviewers have said, this film is not faithful to the events it is supposed to be about, and this is unfortunate because the reality of the Johnson County Range wars seem to have plenty of cinematic potential.  Long story short, I would not recommend this movie, there are just too many other westerns to watch that are just so much better.  I regret having wasted three hours on this movie",1476835200,,624,4.636363636363637

Just do yourself a favor and avoid it.  2 hrs of your life you'll never get back and for nothing..............  If you can't write an interesting script with a plot just assemble a bunch of has been actors and tell them to curse a blue streak then get Hallmark to sell it as a family movie and watch the confusion and frustration that ensues.

It has an awesome storyline. It makes you wonder if such happenings like land grabbing and forcing families off their farms and cold blooded killings and hangings really did take place. Well I say it probably did. This country was built on many likely and unlikely principles, some good some not so good. If we can take lands from the native American Indians, then I say it was probably true that it happened to the early settlers and their families who had a legal right to the lands they occupied.

1745738,5,B00006FDF1,"This miniseries is unique as it is not your standard western. Much more time is devoted to acquainting the viewer with the main characters depicting the homesteaders, their families and their lives. In this way, the viewer becomes more intimate with the storyline to the point where one starts to experience the emotions, the setbacks and the trials and tribulations the Wyoming homesteaders must have encountered ( early 1890's) in their battles against the aggressive tactics of the cattle barons.

The movie takes a while to build up to a crescendo but, it's worth waiting for. The cinematography is excellent and is coupled with very good sound. The acting is excellent and Tom Berenger excels in his role.

I watched the DVD in three one hour stints and as a result gained greater entertainment value, savoured the acting more and I became more emotionally involved with the plight of the homesteaders who had no wish to part with their land.",1349395200,,947,4.9125

1745752,5,B00006FDF1,"I bought this movie a couple of years ago. It is based on a true story. Tom Berenger is really great in this movie and plays his part to a T. The other actors in this movie are really great as well. It is based on the true story of the Johnson County War in Wyoming and gives a good account of the Big Ranchers with their greed and lawless ways of trying to drive out the smaller ranchers and settlers. The part that Tom Berenger plays is based on the story of Nate Champion who came from Texas to have a ranch in Wyoming. His younger brother soon followed him to Wyoming. After watching this movie I had to look it up on the Internet to find out the true story behind the movie. The real facts of what happened and didn't happen to the Cattlemens Association of Cheyenne, WY. is very sad and shows the workings of Politics even back then. But Tom does a really good job of protraying the main character in this movie. Of course Hollywood had to add more drama to the story, more in a personal way. But the facts of the Johnson County War are mostly pretty well protrayed in the movie. This is a must see movie. And you will love Tom Berenger in this movie. It is one that you can watch many times over and still enjoy it.
If your a Tom Berenger fan (which I am) another movie to see or have with him staring in is: ""Last of the Dogmen"". With co-star Barbara Hershey. Suspenseful, action and one you will remember and enjoy. The Dogmen were the fighting Warrior's of the Cheyenne Indians, who were believed to have been massacred over 100 years before. What these two people find is amazing. But they have to protect these Indians. Its a desperate race against time if they are to save the last of the Dogmen from the destructive forces of the modern world. I then had to get on the computer and read about the Cheyenne Dogmen and the true story behind their existance.  ENJOY both movies!",1311379200,,1889,4.26183844011142

No, this one will end in a way that will make you mad that there is not more to offer. Along the path to this fantastic ending you will be introduced to many sympathetic characters, including three brothers and the one brother's wife, whose fate you will come to worry about.

1745760,3,B00006FDF1,"As soon as you see the name Larry McMurty, you know it's going to be a very, very long movie in which very, very little happens.  McMurty seems to specialize in taking short stories and padding them into three-volume novels.  This movie, of which he only wrote the screenplay, is no exception.  The scenery and music keep it from being a total waste and the gritty, dirty sets.

Western fans may be annoyed by a couple of places where credibility is strained in how the character handles a dangerous situation.  Also, the big, big buildup to a climactic scene leads to a fizzle ending.  The characters are not, in fact, well developed but are stereotypes.  The British lord and his man-servant are comic book material, not only stereotypes but highly prejudiced stereotypes.

There are many better movies out there.  See this only if you're a fan of one of the players.  And by the bye, even though Rachel Ward gets top billing on the cover, she has a very small part and is quickly dead, a pity since she was at least a colorful character.",1165536000,,1040,4.572972972972973

I've seen this movie as well as ""Heaven's Gate"" and ""In Old Cheyenne"" all of which supposedly dealt with the ""Johnson County War"" of 1892.  This version is a well-acted western and enjoyable entertainment but I must plead with the reader to not believe this movie has anything to do the titled incident.  It's worth getting to add to your ""westerns"" collection or if you're a fan of Burt Reynolds or Tom Berenger.

1745763,3,B00006FDF1,"Large, sprawling, and picture-postcard pretty, JOHNSON COUNTY WAR is a three-hour mini-series that originally ran on the Hallmark Channel in 2002.  It's based on a real event, a range war that pitted large ranchers against small ranchers in Wyoming in 1892.  Infamously it's the real life event that inspired Michael Cimino's mega-disaster `Heaven's Gate.'

  `Based on' doesn't mean `faithful to,' and a cursory internet search of `Johnson County War' reveals a muddled, hero-less big rancher versus small rancher conflict that pitted cattle rustlers against the unscrupulous wealthy.  Here, though, the moral right and wrong is more strongly etched.  Tom Berenger plays Cain Hammett, the eldest of three brothers (why are there always three brothers in these western mini-series?)  Cain is a good guy, a small ranch bachelor who has a healthy and upright respect for younger brother Dale's (Adam Storke) wife Rory (Michelle Forbes.)  Dale is a sheep rancher, a bit lower in the pecking order as such things were reckoned back then.  Unfortunately, we're introduced to Dale soon after we meet Rory, who's nursing a nasty looking, husband-inflicted black eye.  The penalty, the movie explains away, for calling your husband a coward because he won't shoot to kill mercenary Marshall Hunt Lawton (Burt Reynolds.)  Little brother Harry (Luke Perry), meanwhile, is out branding strays and squiring a passel of young widows.  The widows were made by Lawton, who along with other hired thugs pin messages (`Beware Cattle Rustlers,' and the like) on their victims' corpses.  The wealthy ranchers' Cheyenne Club hired Lawton to intimidate the small ranchers into leaving.

 JOHNSON COUNTY WAR is a good enough movie, but it has some problems.  For one, it lasts at least an hour longer than it needs to.  Rachel Ward plays a hard-boiled prostitute who, while entertaining enough, doesn't add a lot to the story while chewing up an inordinate amount of screen time.  Reynolds, in a role Robert Ryan spent the last couple of decades of his career playing to perfection, doesn't have the grit to carry it off convincingly.  The issues aren't very sharply drawn, either.  I don't mind when a movie plays with the facts, but JOHNSON COUNTY WAR doesn't make the core issues, especially what's happening with the small ranchers, clear enough to follow.  An alright modern western, but that's about it.",1131148800,8,2387,5.161458333333333
1745764,5,B00006FDF1,"This film far exceeds the quality of the one made in the 1970s (starring Christopher Walken) about the same historical events and the murder of (real name) Nate Champion in the Johnson County, Wyoming, cattle wars of 1892.

The spirit of the film stays with the spirit of the novel on which it's based, ""Riders of Judgment,"" by Frederick Manfred.  Manfred was a tireless, detailed researcher, and he portrayed the historical facts with incredible skill, as did the makers of this film.

This is not just a cowboy movie. It's a story that warns us of the corruption and power-mongering that characterizes our times.",1129420800,3,614,4.884615384615385
1745765,5,B00006FDF1,"This movie (althought the names have been changed) is based on real people and real events of the last days of the Wild West.  In general, the storyline runs pretty close to actual historical events... Tom Berringer has to be one of the best ""cowboy"" actors around, and proves himself again in this one.  All of the lead actors do a great job, and the story never drags... the suspense builds and you know something big is coming... when the final showdown happens, it's not your typical shoot'em-up, and the hero is left standing scenerio.  He has his work cut out for him, and it's all very realistic and believable, with no outrageous special effects, or people being blown backwards and upside down from a pistol shot.

You'll want to watch this movie over and over... each time you do, you'll realize new things about the old west, and you'll find yourself tinkering on which side of the law you'd be on if you were in Wyoming in those days.  It's a very thought provoking, and political movie, and it captures the mindset of those times real well.  Great scenery, great action, great plot, great historical accuracy, great cast, just an all-around great movie.  I expect this one will be TV for years to come, but I'd recommend this one to anyone who enjoys westerns, American history, political evolution, or action-adventure.

PS.  It's not just a guy movie either, there's plenty of heart-aches, tears, betrayal, domestic violence, female bravery, love triangles, and romance mixed into these 3-hours as well... anyone who enjoys soap opera's will have their hands full with the various romantic sub-plots.",1125014400,4,1615,4.864963503649635

1745769,2,B00006FDF1,"The Johnson County War is a great subject for an authentic Western, and Hallmark's track record (plus Larry McMurtry's pen) would seem to bode well for this production.  Unfortunately it's not very good, despite magnificent scenery and adequate performances by Tom Berenger & Michelle Forbes.  Rachel Ward steals her few brief scenes, but Burt Reynolds's acting is almost as garish as his face lift.  If 60 of its 180 tiresome, cliche-ridden minutes were cut, it might make an above-average made-for-TV movie, but even that drastic snooze-factor reduction would fail to rescue it from mediocrity among theatrical releases.",1078272000,6,622,5.391752577319588
1745770,3,B00006FDF1,"It's decent but not outstanding.  There is not a lot of action until the end if you are looking for that.  There is a persistent love triangle that continues through the film which could have been left out.  It doesn't include any type of constant skimishing to indicate the ongoing struggle but rather just culminates in the final shootout.  Also ,the final shootout has the representiave small time rancher holed up instead of the other way around as history actually went.  That's forgiveable I guess.  The film essentially takes a small number of people(namely three brothers and some friends) and tries to be a microcasm of the overall struggle between the greedy cattle barons and the small time rancher.  The greedy barons are portrayed pretty well but the english one in particular is just a little over the top.  So if you're a die hard western fan you'll probably like it, ...",1074038400,2,886,4.782894736842105
