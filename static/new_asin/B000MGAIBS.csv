I have shared it with other parents of new players & they agree. Watching with my 2 younger sons has sparked an interest in them as well so looks like it's off to the sporting goods store to get 2 more sticks! I recommend this video for new players & their families as well as coaches of new players.",1176508800,,464,4.1098901098901095
8239677,5,B000MGAIBS,"I have been coaching lacrosse and have been on our local lacrosse board for over five years. I am always looking for ways to inform parents and players on the rules of lacrosse. I found this DVD to be a great source of information. I bought extra copies to keep in our town's video library, as well as a couple of extra copies for our U9 and U11 coaches to pass around to their players.

The DVD is also a ""recommended"" item for new lacrosse players and parents coming into the system. I think any player who is new to the sport, will find this DVD to be informative. Content is good and the quality of the DVD is excellent.",1170806400,,624,4.2
