1265370,5,B00003CXIF,"""Where the Heart Is"" is definately a sensational movie that I recommend very highly. Natalie Portman does an outstanding performance and  is truly one of the most sophisticated young actresses that I have ever  seen. She is definately wise beyond her years. Ashley Judd also does a  wonderful job in this drama as Americus' (Natalie) best friend. They are  there for each other every step of the way. I have to say, they have one of  the closest relationships in a movie that I have ever seen! Even though  Natalie plays a young mother in this movie she definately makes her  character sophisticated. She knows how to handle herself and her family,  and will do anything for them. I support this movie all the way! I hope  each and every one of the people that buys this movie enjoys it as much as  I did! Heck, I've seen it twice at the theatre and I'm most definately  going to order it!",965865600,,889,4.459627329192546
1265371,5,B00003CXIF,"Outstanding performances by Natalie Portman and Ashley Judd highlight ""Where The Heart Is,"" a warm and remarkable film directed by Matt Williams.  On their way to California from Tennessee, single and pregnant Novalee  Nation (Portman) is abandoned by her boyfriend Willy Jack (Dylan Bruno) at  a Wal Mart in Oklahoma.  She has no friends, no family and only a few  dollars in her pocket.  Lost, with no one to turn to and no place to go,  she takes up residence in the Wal Mart for the next six weeks, where  destiny has placed her for the birth of her daughter.  Mercifully, fate  brings Forney Hall (James Frain) to her, a young man who lives nearby above  the town library with his sister, and he delivers the baby.  What  follows is a story of very real people who are just trying to live their  lives as best they can, seeking the good in themselves as well as others,  and striving to hold on to the important things as they sort and sift  through all the obstacles life has to throw at them, and does.  Throughout  her travails, Novalee's life is touched by those in need themselves,  beginning with Lexie Coop (Judd), the nurse who befriends her when she  needs it most, and ""Sister"" Husband (wonderfully played by Stockard  Channing), who takes her in when she and her newborn baby have nowhere else  to go.  From the novel by Billie Letts, Williams and writers Lowell  Ganz and Babaloo Mandel have presented a truly heartwarming film, told  through characters with whom the audience can readily identify and  empathize; a story of compassion and love that aptly illustrates the  magnanimity of the human spirit, as well as the depths of evil to which it  is capable of descending.  When Novalee is in the hospital, her mother,  Lil, (an uncharacteristic role for Sally Field in a terrific cameo), who  had abandoned her when she was five years old, shows up after seeing the  story of the ""Wal Mart Baby"" on television, only to steal from her.  In  another exacting scene, Lexie tells Novalee of coming home from work early  and catching her boyfriend abusing two of her children, a scene which is  all the more effective because the crime is not shown; we see only Lexie  and her children as she describes what happened.  And it is harrowing.  Their work here firmly establishes Portman and Judd as two of the finest  young actresses in film today; Channing has never been better, while Frain  and Bruno must be given credit for adding so much to this worthy endeavor,  as well as the rest of the supporting cast which includes Joan Cusack (Ruth  Meyers), Keith David (Moses) and Richard Jones (Mr. Sprock).  A great story  and first-rate performances all around make ""Where The Heart Is"" an  unforgettable film that will stay with you, in your heart and in your soul,  for a long, long time.",965779200,,2804,4.651639344262295
1265372,5,B00003CXIF,"Although this video is not available yet, I have seen the film.  In fact, it was the second feature at a drive-in movie and I had never heard of it.  At 11 pm when it started we almost left, but then decided to give it a  chance.  From the moment it started to the time it ended I was mesmerized.  My husband who is not usually into ""girl's movies"" even admits he  loves this movie!
An excellent story of a girl who has a lot of bad  things thrown at her, but still looks for the best in herself and in those  around her. An excellent ending! This movie will inspire you!",965433600,,571,4.035714285714286
1265373,5,B00003CXIF,"This movie was so good.  I read the book first, and although there were a lot of differences, it was still really good.  But I think that its a waste  to spend 106 something dollars on it!  I am waiting until the price goes  down",965433600,,229,4.0

This is a bit  of a chick flick but interesting!  Hey give it a shot...I liked it so much  I just pre-oredered it!,965433600,,393,4.287671232876712

1265376,5,B00003CXIF,"Seems to me most critics only like movies where things blow up, people are killed violently, and there are alot of car chases, but no plot. These  receive high marks. High marks should go to where the heart is. If you love  a movie with a story, that is warm felt and the characters bring out your  emotion. Natalie Portman is superb. You will want to see this one.",964828800,,365,4.260869565217392

1266584,5,B00003CXIF,"Just finished watching this movie again and loved it. I saw this film years ago which was before Natalie Portman had became a famous actress.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film then and now...so much for star power. Actually, the storyline is very good, the acting great, and the interpersonal relationships quite believable, contrary to some of the reviews here. Of course, a wealth of life experience helps with understanding such complex relationships, which is much like life in general. Whether rich or poor, highly educated or not, human relationships can sometimes be very messy. But that's how we learn, grow and evolve if we so choose. I was surprised to see that Sally Field was not in the credits, hard to believe it was her initially. Nonetheless, it's truly a great film, Oscar material if it were European made. Sadly, Americans don't like to see poor, uneducated white folks in love stories, or so it seems. Yet things are changing in American society, and that's a good thing.",1480982400,,988,4.880952380952381

I have watched this movie many times, just because I find it light and entertaining, and so many of my favorite actresses are in it.

But this movie is unbelievable, from beginning to end.

I cannot believe that all that Mr. Sprock wanted was the table.
I cannot believe that he was not resentful or jealous in any way.
I cannot believe that Novalee didn't at least invite him to live with them in that big house  -- she should have given Mr. Sprock at least something.

I could not believe that Novalee was self-taught in photography to be good enough for a professional career and award.
She could have at least taken one photography class to make it believable.
She never finished high school and had no experience in anything except for waitressing and working in Walmart.

I couldn't believe that Forney, who was a genius, even needed to go to college,
or that he would want to be with Novalee, who was a barely literate drop-out.

I couldn't believe that Novalee could live in Walmart for six weeks without being discovered.
Aren't there surveillance cameras, even after hours?
Aren't there alarms that go off, even after hours?
Isn't there a cleanup crew that comes in later, to mop and buff the floors, clean the bathrooms and windows, etc.?
Wouldn't someone notice this pregnant teenager, always there alone first thing in the morning and always there alone at closing time?
And she never buys anything.
And the items that she took must have been noticed, such as soap and shampoo, and the other little items that she had on her list.

I couldn't believe that Lexie would marry a short bald fat exterminator when they both have too many children to support.
I couldn't believe that Lexie worked as a nurse in the maternity ward, but she didn't know how to keep from getting pregnant.

I hated the name Americus, with all of the beautiful girls' names that Novalee could have come up with,
whether she was looking for something important or not.... important does not have to mean ugly or ridiculous.
How can you name your daughter Americus Nation?  It was never mentioned what her middle name was.
I thought that, at some point, they would at least call her Amy.

And how could Lexie name all of her children after snack foods?
If you want to affectionately call your child Brownie, that is fine, but you don't actually give him that legal name.

All of the names in this movie annoyed me, including Forney and Novalee and Moses Whitecotton and Sister Husband . . .
didn't anyone in this movie have an ordinary name?

The fear of the number 5 was ridiculous, especially the way that the number 5 always actually came along with something bad.

How could Forney deliver Novalee's baby, and then Novalee wakes up in the hospital and does not remember?
The way that Forney crashed himself through a thick window like a superhero, without any serious injuries, would be memorable enough.
If a man hurls himself into a store window, he would definitely get injured, but it is not likely that he would break through the glass.
How did Forney even know that Novalee was hiding in the Walmart, and how did he even know that she was in labor?
He had to have been following her and watching her, which was implied, but how could he know that her water broke?
He could have just dialed 911 and had her picked up - - which he obviously had to do anyway, because she did end up in the hospital.

Sister Husband was an amazing character.  She took Novalee in to live with her when no one else did.  She left everything to Novalee in her will.  I just wondered why she didn't come to pick up Novalee until after Novalee had been sitting in the hospital lobby for several hours.  She knew that Novalee had her baby (she made a comment that the baby was even cuter than she was yesterday, which means that she had been to the hospital to see Novalee and the baby the day before), and she had to know that Novalee had nowhere to go because it was all over the News that she had been living in Walmart.  I also expected her to get drunk at least once - - to just once need help from someone.

The most believable scene to me was when Novalee's mother showed up, took her money, and never came back.
I thought that she really did intend to get an apartment with Novalee, but then she changed her mind and just kept the money and left town.

Just about every scene in this movie was not believable, but I still really enjoyed this movie, and I have watched it many times.
I would recommend this movie to anyone who could ignore the unbelievable scenes and just enjoy it.

I really hated the character of the boyfriend who abandoned Novalee.  Every time I watch this movie, I fast forward his scenes.  The part about the roll of quarters in his pants is just too annoying.  And the part where he is lying in the hospital in pain is too much - - were the writers trying to give him payback for abandoning Novalee? - - losing his legs in such a horrible way was just too much.

A homeless, penniless, uneducated teen with a newborn makes a success of herself and ends up in love and married with a good job and living in a big house that she designed and built from the ground.... she started out with no family and no friends, and the movie ends with her surrounded by love and success.",1471392000,,5298,4.446280991735537

1267152,5,B00003CXIF,"I have watched this film every time that I see it because the story continues to draw me into the lives of Novalee, Americus, and Forney. It is unique and always heartwarming. The four leads (Natalie Portman, James Frain,  Stockard Channing, and Ashley Judd) with all supporting cast members are excellent.

Several years of Novalee's life is vividly portrayed as she transitions from abandoned young mother to be, through six weeks of secretly living in WalMart to growing up in a variety of ways with the support of several friends in a small Oklahoma town.

It is utterly beautiful with Natalie Portman clearly demonstrating and confirming her amazing talent many years prior to winning an Oscar for Best Actress in The Black Swan in 2010.",1468627200,3,742,4.92

Her wisecracking nurse Lexie, (Ashley Judd) who becomes her best friend almost stole the show. She was my favorite.

1267436,5,B00003CXIF,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies ever! I love any movie with Natalie Portman OR Ashley Judd. I first saw this movie when it came out in theaters when I was a teenager. It was such a great feel-good movie with a lot of depth and meaning to it. I loved the cute love story and how her ex-boyfriend who abandoned her at Wal-Mart when she was pregnant, changed his life around. this is a great chick flick, but also one the whole family can enjoy. This is one of those few I fall back on again and again when I want a familiar favorite or something to fall asleep to. I never get tired of it.
A beautiful young pregnant girl is left stranded by her heartless boyfriend at an Oklahoma Wal-Mart. With nothing for company but a budging fichus tree given to her by the local welcome committee (""Sister"" Thelma Husband), she takes shelter inside the Wal-Mart keeping a collection of IOUs that she fully intends to repay when able. In the meantime, she meets Forney, the brother of the local librarian (something of a loner but extremely articulate) who inspires her to educate herself. Eventually, Forney delivers Novalee's baby girl Americus inside the local Wal-Mart, ushering the duo into the spotlight. She befriends Lexie (Ashley Judd), a independent minded, free-spirited single mother and moves in With ""Sister"" and her gentlemen friend ""Mr. Spock."" It is in the heart of this sleepy town that Novalee learns what it means to be a family, the value of friends, develops a passion for photography, and falls in love with a man who turns out to be her soul-mate. Of course, there are several bumps to happily ever.",1462147200,6,1620,4.608996539792387

1268504,5,B00003CXIF,"A beautiful young pregnant girl is left stranded by her heartless boyfriend at an Oklahoma Wal-Mart.  With nothing for company but a budging fichus tree given to her by the local welcome committee (""Sister"" Thelma Husband), she takes shelter inside the Wal-Mart keeping a collection of IOUs that she fully intends to repay when able.  In the meantime, she meets Forney, the brother of the local librarian (something of a loner but extremely articulate) who inspires her to educate herself.

Eventually, Forney delivers Novalee's baby girl Americus inside the local Wal-Mart, ushering the duo into the spotlight.  She befriends Lexie (Ashley Judd), a independent minded, free-spirited single mother and moves in With ""Sister"" and her gentlemen friend ""Mr. Spock.""  It is in the heart of this sleepy town that Novalee learns what it means to be a family, the value of friends, develops a passion for photography, and falls in love with a man who turns out to be her soul-mate.  Of course, there are several bumps to happily ever. Still this film is so charming and endearing that it passes in the blink of an eye with a great supporting cast including Ashley Judd, Sally Field,and Stockard Channing.  Natalie Portman gives a transformative performance (and in my opinion) one that helped kick her career into high gear.

Where the Heart Is reminds us to look for the best in ourselves and others and pass on the good...Superb film worth owning!",1432857600,,1442,4.954356846473029

1268995,5,B00003CXIF,"This is a feel good movie from beginning to end. It tells the story of a innocent young girl who gets pregnant and becomes a mother never having a mother herself. Natalie Portman portrays her vulnerability and goodness brillantly.  After trusting the father of the baby to care for her and take her to live in something other than a house with wheels, he abandons her at the Walmart where she stopped to use the bathroom and buy a pair of flipflops. She camps out at the Walmart, not having anywhere else to go or money to take care of herself. She delivers the baby with the help of a  vulnerable young man who lives nearby and becomes a celebrity  gaining employment at the Walmart. Others such as Ashley Judd recognize the sweet person that she is and take her under their wing providing care, friendship and protection.
I liked the characters in this film, although some were stereotypical, it was OK because they helped to tell the story. This young mother was grateful for everything and everyone eventually was able to find love for herself that she deserved. I recommend this film to anyone young, old, male or female who wants to see a movie that makes us feel human and good..",1400630400,,1186,4.55868544600939

1269125,5,B00003CXIF,"Although this little gem of a movie is filled with clich, it is worth the time you'll spend watching it. The interactions between the main cast of characters are filled with warmth, tenderness, and uplifting spirit. In my humble opinion, Stockard Channing's character, Sister Husband, represents well the overall theme of the movie...meaning, it is amazing how far reaching simple acts of kindness can be, and equally amazing how much can be accomplished when folks are working together with the same heart. Again, Where the heart Is is full of clichs, it is not without flaws, and it definitely straddles the line of naivet, but it will leave with happy thoughts and many smiles.",1394668800,,680,4.973684210526316

1269185,5,B00003CXIF,"I love this movie.  It's America at its best, taking in a pregnant teen abandoned by her boyfriend and the adventures that follow the young woman and her child as she gets to know the people in the town.  The actors make you believe in the goodness of the heart of America.  Its a love story, and more.  One of the scenes that really got to me is when the women are sitting on the porch talking about the horrible thing that had happened and she asked how do I explain and Novalie's answer is so caring and helpful.  It was a very deep moment in the movie.  The movie was also so funny too, with the pregnancies one after another with Ashley Judd's character.  This movie is just a complete slice of small town America, and how normal people make some bad situations better.  A really great movie that I enjoy watching over and over.  I also plan to purchase the sound track from this movie as all the songs are great too.",1393977600,,922,4.252873563218391

Novalee Nation Natalie Portman) is a very pregnant 17-year-old from Tennessee heading to California with her boyfriend Willie Jack (Dylan Bruno), but is abandoned by him at a Wal-Mart store in Sequoyah, Oklahoma where she takes up a homeless existence - no job, no skills and only $5.55 in her pocket, so she secretly lives in the Wal-Mart. Locked in one evening six weeks later she goes into labor and her new friend Forney (James Frain), who's life was in jeopardy because of his alcohol addiction and his choice to dropout of college, delivers her daughter Americus. The situations so bizarre that Novalee becomes a small town celebrity: she is a strong woman of many talents and she decides to raise her daughter and rebuild her life in Sequoyah, with the help of eccentric but kind strangers. Much to her surprised, Novalee gets an unexpected visit from her mother (Sally Field) who agrees to hold to the $500 given to Novalee from the president of Wal-Mart and to have them both share an apartment. However after agreeing to pick her up the next day, the mother flees with the $500 leaving Novalee and Americus stranded. All manner of freaky friends and strange characters populate this story, giving some fine roles for Ashley Judd, Stockard Channing , Joan Cusack, among others. It is a funky story that somehow rings very true. Grady Harp, October 13",1383004800,,1422,4.757085020242915

Usually I'm disappointed by films based on a book that I read, so I'm not surprised that the bad reviews are primarily from those who love the book.  I have not read the book, but I plan to, as I expect to enjoy that more than the movie.

Be forewarned, it is a ""chick flick.""  A lot of plot points occur, but the relationships are truly its heart.  There's not a bad apple in the cast; Ashley Judd was a standout.  My one point of contention was the ""sub-plot"" of Willy trying to forge a music career after dumping Novalee at Wal-Mart.  Either it should have been better balanced, showing the difference between their lives after that moment, or I could have done without the whole Willy side-story altogether until his life intersected with Novalee's again.

Overall, strong performances with a script that at times made me laugh out loud and other times get teary.  What more can you ask from a decent chick flick?",1355443200,,971,4.502857142857143

A pregnant girl hiding out in a Walmart after being abandoned by her boyfriend is certainly a grabbing way to start a story. How that girl survives with little education and no money and how folks in the Oklahoma town come to her aid--well, it all makes a good tale.  Natalie Portman, Ashley Judd, and Stockard Channing are delightful in their roles.

is the best I can do. Although all the characters revolve around Natlie Portman, she's more of a touchstone, a kind of magnet that brings everyone together. Not always for the best, but that's what life tends to do. And in the end, the guy gets the girl & that's what really matters.",1340755200,,520,4.371134020618556
1269801,5,B00003CXIF,"I first watched Where The Heart Is when it was released in theaters. Since then, I've watched it numerous times. This is such an inspiring tale, with a wonderful ensemble cast that deliver credible, heartfelt performances.

Natalie Portman plays 17-year-old Novalee Nation, a rather naive young woman who at the beginning of the movie is heavily pregnant and leaving for California with her ne'er do well boyfriend, Willy Jack Pickens (Dylan Bruno). Willy really can't be bothered with Novalee or the soon to come baby, and callously abandons her at a Wal-Mart in Sequoyah, OK. The poor girl has no choice and decides to live at the Wal-Mart, using items from the store, but keeps a meticulous log of all the money she owes Wal-Mart on a daily basis!

Eventually, Novalee has the baby, at the Wal-Mart, helped by the loner librarian, Forney (James Frain), and mother and baby find themselves local celebrities. Novalee's estranged mom (played by Sally Field in a brief role) suddenly appears out of the woodworks, only to abscond with some cash donation given to Novalee. Luckily, the girl is taken in by an eccentric but kind-hearted lady, Sister Husband (an amazing Stockard Channing) and Novalee also finds a good friend in a nurse played by Ashley Judd (in one of her best roles).

There's so much to appreciate in this film - how people without much can give so much love and help; the plight of single moms; women making bad decisions; caring for an ailing sibling; there's so much here yet the storyline never appears choppy and characters are fully realized. There are some truly heartbreaking moments as when Novalee realizes where her heart truly is, and also when Lexie (the nurse) makes a horrifying discovery about one of her suitors. This is a movie that I will never tire of.",1338854400,,1790,4.824104234527687

Circumstances forced upon her require she make the best decisions she can and her qualities of kindness and love begin to overcome her own sense of worthlessness. Fortunately this small town in Oklahoma has others who have similar feelings of loving concern for others and they rally to help her when she really needed help.

The acting, the scenery, and the total ambience of the movie is well done and creates characters about whom it is easy to care living through believable situations which challenge them to be their very best.

I was able to relate to her situation: a pregnant young teenager with a no-good boyfriend who only cared about HIS needs and not hers!  Typical, Right?  In my life experience, I ended up marrying the guy!  Go figure!  Novalee Nation (Natalie Portman) shows that you don't need a man to get what you want out of life.  While it's good to have a partner, she showed that if you put you mind to it, you can accomplish anything you want.  My Dad always said: ""You can be anybody you want just by reading books on the subject"", and he is right.  While Novalee struggled with her reading skills, Furnie was there to help her out.  This movie shows that you should be true to your heart and never lie to yourself about who you truly LOVE.  In the end, they both fall in love and marry in Walmart!  I also liked Thelma 'Sister' Husband (Stockard Channing), an eccentric but kindhearted recovering alcoholic who scoops Novalee and her baby up and takes her to her home.  That happened to me when I had MY first baby over 30 years ago!  Overall, its a great movie and I would recommend you buy it.  Thanks for reading and Much happiness and joy, Anna R.

1269978,3,B00003CXIF,"This film surely packs a lot into a little package, and it does so with enough gusto that you almost forget how preposterous it all is in the first place.  I think what makes this film so likable is the cast.  The story is interesting yet ridiculous, and the overall generic vibe of the film is a tad clich&eacute;d and `been there done that' but the fun filled cast make it all worth it in the end.

I couldn't watch this any day of the week, but when I'm in the mood this one does the trick.

Novalee Nation is pregnant and has a dead-end boyfriend (who dreams of being a rock star).  When he leaves her stranded she finds herself living in Wal-Mart until she finally gives birth (IN THE STORE) and winds up finding herself a new life with a spunky and soulful nurse named Lexie and a sweetly attentive man named Forney.

Like I said, the storyline itself is sweet and endering at moments, but it is nothing spectacular.  I do like the whole ""Wal-Mart baby' idea, but the film does honestly go too far at times to try and be unique and it winds up being a hinderance as apposed to a blessing.

What is a blessing though, is the actors here.  From Natalie Portman's star making turn as Novalee to Joan Cusack's scene stealing comedic timing and Ashley Judd's charming charisma (and let's not forget that lovable loaf known as James Frain), `Where the Heart Is' is bursting at the seems with actorly reasons to adore this film.  Like I mentioned, this film kind of lives and dies with the actors.  Everyone involved is on top of their game here, and it makes for a lovely ride.

These actors help forgive the film all of its missteps.

So, in the end, I really like this one.  Yes, I'm giving it a C+, but that's a recommended C+.  The film does meander on stupid at times, but that's okay when you consider that this is merely here to entertain (and it does that).",1270080000,,1865,4.334293948126801

1270101,5,B00003CXIF,"Once in a while a movie comes along that is the complete package.  Where The Heart Is is one such movie.  There's love, betrayal, sex, drugs, rock and roll, drama, one mean tornado, hope, inspiration, desperation, and Wal-Mart.

Natalie Portman is stellar as Novalee Nation, a young pregnant girl who gets ditched by her white trash boyfriend at a Wal-Mart in Sequoya, Oklahoma.  Abandoned, scared, lonely, penniless, she hides out in the Wal-Mart for 6 weeks.  During her stay at the Wal-Mart ""hotel"" she ventures out and meets a variety of truly interesting characters like the local welcome wagon's Thelma ""Sister"" Husband (Stockard Channing), photographer Moses Whitecotten (Keith David), and librarian Fornay Hull (James Frain of Elizabeth, the Virgin Queen).

It's hard not to feel sad for Novalee because it seems that everybody she cares about leaves her.  She has this calm, humble demeanor that makes you realize she has accepted life on life's terms.  It's hard not to admire her.

This movie is probably the first movie to openly introduce Alcoholic Anonymous into a movie plot.  Author Billie Letts who wrote the book used a lot of humor in regards to the theme of AA.  That humor translated well into the script.  The humor is respectful, unoffensive and gives the viewer a brief but informative glimpse into the world of Alcholics Anonymous.

There is so much chemistry between the cast members of this film, you  feel drawn in -- like you are actually sitting there with these characters, in their livingroom, eavesdropping.

I really do love this movie.  I have watched it numerous times.  It is completely different from what I might normally watch and it's such a refreshing break.  Plus it has James Frain in it who played the Spanish Ambassador in Cate Blanchette's Elizabeth.  He is an incredible actor and there's something about him that I find disarming and very attractive.

1270170,5,B00003CXIF,"This movie, has Natalie Portman perhaps playing the role of her

career and of her life, considering the realism, feel and

presence she brings to the movie, and ... potential she brings to

the character, in terms of having the public believe she had a

lot better in store for her, than what she was brought up with,

in terms of the character.

There's the very realistic side, poverty, family obligations,

day-to-day pressures, the ups and downs, the challenge of

maintaining social relationships, and more.

There's also the comedic, parody of a certain type of woman of a

specific geographic location, and social class, breeding babies

like rabbits, in the USA. Obviously, not to be taken literally,

and seriously, in my view. For example, Ashley Judd's character

has 6 kids in the film.

There are also serious aspects brought into the open, such as

alcoholism, irresponsibility, financial ruin, pedophilia,

psychological disorders, age and death, birth, etc.

There's the softer side, as well, which depicts the social

interactions between people, which is not always valued or

underlined in a moview, vs. agression, violence, explosions in

action movies, for example. For this reason alone, the store can

be seen as a welcome change.

It also brings to the forefront, paternal responsibility for

fathering kids, the thesis of the movie being, is sorely lacking

in the USA.

Judd's character is done extremely well, and is perfect to not

overexpose her, in balance with Natalie Portman's persona, which

is the real focus, and protagonist, here. Again, Portman simply

does an incredible job, with her human presence, timid yet very

credible, such that the 90 minutes or so pass by without the

viewer barely noticing.

Some scenes could have been edited a bit better, as perhaps some

will fast forward them, due to momentary boredom.

In depicting a full, varied range of emotions, this movie is

extremely well written, acted out, and filmed.

Finally, I did not recognize Stockard Channing until I read the

credits, as she looked quite a bit differently, in the other

film, SMOKE. Like all of the cast, great job.",1166659200,,2143,5.037249283667622
1270171,4,B00003CXIF,"Sometimes a movie will surprise me.  I was really surprised by this one.  The thing that hooked me at the beginning was the subplot of Novalee Nation (Natalie Portman, who is now so famous that she needs no additional background from me) living in a Wal-Mart.  I was wondering what she would do when the baby came.  The next thing I know, I have given up doing all the other things I should have been doing to watch this movie to the very end.  I am very glad I did so, and I will do so again.

Novalee is 17 years old, pregnant, and freshly dumped by her loser boyfriend Wally Jack Pickens (Dylan Bruno, who is now a regular on the television series ""Numb3rs"").  At first I thought this movie was going to be another of those seemingly countless movies about a young girl who manages to get kicked around by life, eventually ending up as an alcoholic in a trailer park somewhere or maybe in prison because she has turned to a life of crime; essentially, one of those movies where everybody gets blamed except the person most responsible.  Instead, this movie surprised me by having Novalee realize that she was the only person who was going to be able to get her act together.

Novalee was fortunate that she had help from several key people, including Thelma ""Sister"" Husband, cleverly played by veteran actress Stockard Channing, and the eccentric but likable librarian Forney Hull, played by James Frain.  As a side note, Bruno and Frain have roles in a recently completed movie, ""Quid Pro Quo.""  Novalee also gets important advice and a little critical help from Lexie Coop (Ashley Judd).  This movie surprised me again by having Novalee give as much help, if not more, than she gets.  I will let you learn how she does this.

This movie refuses to be simple.  After the major players are in place we keep meeting other people who have affected Novalee either directly or indirectly.  Novalee's mother (Sally Field) drops by and we quickly understand how Novalee could get into the situation she is in.  We also see how Novalee has decided, for herself, that she will be the mother that her mother never was.  We meet Forney's sister and learn a lot about Forney.  The list is extensive, but these side characters are important.

This movie never lets up.  Taking a page from action movie playbooks, you get a tornado, an attempted guilt trip from a handicapped boyfriend (the gift that keeps on sucking up your life, if you let it), child abuse, woman abuse, a kidnapping, and lots more to keep your focus on this movie.  The only danger in this movie is that you will turn away a moment too long and have to go back to catch the subtlety that you missed.

Many movies in this genre seem to follow a simple formula.  Define the bad guy.  Define the woman or girl who just cannot seem to get a break.  Make you feel sorry for the woman or girl and keep doing it until you either want to cry or scream.  This movie manages to make you want to cry in several places, but it does so in a very natural and poignant way.  This movie held my interest so well that I think most viewers who like good movies about real life will love this one.  Classify this one as a romantic movie about a strong-willed woman who took minimal help to make changes in her life, and then repaid the help she got many times over.

1270206,5,B00003CXIF,"First of all I want to thank ""Just Anna"" (five or so reviews below this one) for pointing out some of her main complaints about this movie having read the book upon which it is based first... I fell in love with this movie (having not read the book) so it is hard for me to imagine the ""Lexie"" character (Ashley Judd) as a trashy-mannered size 22 mother of four! But the point here is that the main story line, that is, the departure of two people from one another (Novalee and Willy), and watch them go in so very different directions, and to ultimately see how each of their own stories unfold right up until one of them hits rock bottom (Willy) while the other one rises up above difficulties and finds truly happiness (Novalee), is still greatly achieved in the movie. I simply loved Stockard Channing characterization of ""Sister Husband"". And also, what a pleasant surprise was for me to discover Natalie Portman in a certainly luckier role than the pale Amidala... She simply excelled. All the remaining characters are sweet and warm, the music is great and ultimately the whole final product ends up very enjoyable and fresh. A very beautiful, heart-warming, spirit-lifting, easy-watching, mind-offsteamer sort of movie.",1159401600,3,1227,4.819905213270142
1270207,3,B00003CXIF,"if you are reading this, you probably already know that this story revolves around Natalie Portman. She is a young pregnant woman who is suddenly abandoned by her boyfriend Willy Jack. (We later learn that he was just scared, though the line of indecency has certainly been crossed!) You'll probably notice right away that the film takes shots at men in general.

Having nowhere to go, Portman takes sanctuary in Walmart. (Why not? They sell everything, and she is able to make herself a bed, and borrow the food she needs. And in all fairness to her character, she documents everything she takes with the intention to pay it back.)

We also meet James Frain. (The local librarian who takes care of his ill sister.) At the time of delivery, it is the eccentric, but benevolent Frain who saves Portman.(We can probably guess that Frain is spared from the male bashing in this film because he is eccentric and doesn't think in sterotyped male ways.)

Moving on, Portman meets Judd who will becomeher best friend. Portman's mother shows up just long enough to run away with what little money Portman has. (Sociopathic mother!)

Well, with nowhere to go, Portman gradually finds kindness in the area including the strange and kind 'Sister.' As a church goer, I was somewhat offended by the way the church goers were portrayed. But moving forward, Willy Jack hooks up with Joan Cusackand starts his musical career. It doesn't move as fast as he would like it to, but he does make some progress. Moving on, Portman goes on to be a photographer, and her relationship with Frain continues to grow. Her 'Sister' friend has a tragic death. She of course leaves her money to Portman. In a disturbing moment, portman's friend Judd is assaulted. (A sad truthful danger on the risk of getting involved with someone without really knowing them!)

Portman starts to fear that she is holding Frain back. Willy Jack has some bad luck when the authorship of his hit is disputed. Another problem I have with this film is that even if the authorship of this song was disputed, 5 YEARS HAVE PASSED! Certainly, he would have written more songs, and put some money away! After losing everything, he has a tragic mishap. But through Willy Jack, Portman is able to realize that she perhaps shared one fault with him.

All in all, this movie does have some annoying flaws. But it also has its good points. it's not exactly Shakespeare. But it's certainly better than most of the 'shoot em up' filth that Hollywood puts out.",1154649600,,2496,4.726436781609196

See, the book is about two people - Novalee and Willie Jack.  They head West together, until Willie Jack abandons her at a WalMart.  They part ways on more than one level - his life goes as low as a life can, and her life rises beautifully.  It's a study in contrasts, and it's done impeccably in the novel, with a plethora of complex characters to richen the journey... but it didn't translate because of Hollywood's froo-froo mentality.

Hollywood cut Benny Goodluck - a main character in the novel - completely out and shaved Moses(another major character) down to a bit part while making Novalee's one-visit-mother a major player.  And they DESTROYED Forney... who is supposed to be eccentric, late-thirties genius, withdrawn and strange... they turned him into a twenty-something easy-going stud type with a crooked smile.  SO. NOT. FORNEY.  I never wanted to jump thru the screen and slap people so badly in my life.  That horrid.  And Lexie... she's supposed to be a size 22 with four kids and white-trash tendencies... and they put ASHLEY JUDD in the role.  Hello...?!?!

1270213,5,B00003CXIF,"In Where The Heart Is, the number five is an ironic symbol of bad luck, because Novalee's misfortune began at an early age and her misfortune followed her to adulthood. Every time she comes across anything that includes the number five, whether it's five o'clock or five dollars in change at the store, it is followed by some form of calamity that makes Novalee's life a little harder. Furthermore, Novalee experienced misfortune even with her own daughter.

 Where The Heart Is first began as a novel written by Billie Letts. Then, it was turned into a motion pictured directed by Matt Williams and screenplay by Lowell Ganz. My aunt who always recommended me to watch it gave this movie to me as a Christmas gift. I think she wanted me to know that there are many hardships in life and to never give up, just like Novalee kept on going with her life even though she had many discouraging events that happened to her. Where The Heart Is opened in 2000 but I first watched it on November 20, 2005 in my room at my house. This movie rated 6.5 on a scale from one to ten on the Internet Movie Database. It was given a low scored because many viewers believed the characters could have been more developed in their parts. I personally would rate this movie a ten because it was very dramatic to me and very compelling. It had really captured my attention with Novalee's character and all of her misfortunes adding on and on as she kept trying to find some hope.

 In Where The Heart Is, the number five an ironic symbol of bad luck, because in the movie Novalee faces more struggles in her already misfortunate life when she comes along anything with the number five tied with it. Even though she did all she could to keep her away from pain, it still hovered over her like a black cloud always around.

 Novalee's life of bad luck had begun at early childhood. On her fifth birthday her mother left her for a baseball umpire and never came back and left her to spend her growing up years alone with no family to rely on. From that moment on she was cursed with ill luck. After she dropped out of school to wait tables in a restaurant, a waitress that went crazy attacked Novalee with a steak knife and cut her from wrist to elbow. It took fifty-five to stitch her back up. From this traumatic experience in her life, Novalee continued her life constantly followed with pain and heartache when she comes across the number five.

 Novalee's persistent misfortune had followed her throughout her life every since she was a young girl. She left her trailer home with her controlling boyfriend to begin a new life in Tennessee at five o'clock. He had bought an old heap for eighty dollars with no floor on the passenger side. Novalee fell asleep and her shoes fell out from the bottom. After, they stopped at a Wal Mart so that she could use the bathroom and to buy some slippers. After purchasing her item the cashier gave her change of five dollars and fifty-five cents. Novalee was horrified and ran out of the store leaving her stuff behind. She nervously ran out into the parking lot and only found her old camera sitting in the parking spot where she last saw her boyfriend. For the next two weeks she managed to stay inside the Wal Mart at night and using merchandise that would help her get through her day and her pregnancy. At the same time she kept a list of the things used and how much she owed Wal Mart. Then one night while Novalee slept, she felt a sharp pain from her stomach. She nervously walked down the aisle gasping in pain when her water broke and she fell to the ground in aisle five. She helplessly crawled to aisle six and then a man broke through the window and delivered her baby while she had passed out. She woke up the next day in the hospital only to be surprised that she was a local celebrity. She was now considered the mommy that gave birth to the Wal Mart baby. She wanted to give her baby a strong name that means something. She named her Americus Nation.

 Furthermore, Novalee still continued to come across more struggles even with her own daughter. Americus was born on July 5, 1995. When Americus was five days old she got the jaundice, when she was five weeks old she had an ear infection, and when she was five months old she was kidnapped. A religious couple that believed she was an abomination kidnapped her. They had come from Midnight, Tennessee to give the word of God to the baby but were turned away by the Welcome Woman. They were the same couple that sent Novalee a letter and wrote, ""A baby born out of holy wedlock is an abomination in the eyes of God."" After they kidnapped Americus, they had left her in a manger in a Nativity scene in front of a church.

 The number five is a symbol of the same main thing in the movie. One single number represents the pain and struggles of one person. Although, after all Novalee's heartaches it shows that everything turns out for the best and that with bad comes good.",1134518400,,4959,4.425438596491228
1270214,3,B00003CXIF,"What Were They Thinking?

""Where the Heart Is"" reminds me a little of ""Pumpkin"". Good performances and excellent individual scenes that occur so haphazardly that the movie never quite figures out where it is going but manages to cover a lot of ground in the process. This gives both films such a surreal quality that a few days after viewing you will wonder if the whole thing was just a dream (Christina Ricci as a blonde sorority girl-Natalie Portman as a pregnant hillbilly-must have just been my imagination). Unfortunately, both films stop short of being truly surreal and are simply ordinary efforts with a little strangeness. If a visionary director like David Lynch had just ratcheted up the surreal qualities a tiny bit more the result would have been special.

The plot is such a mix of randomness, contrivance, flash-forwards, improbability, coincidence, reversals of fortune, and incidental sub-plots that the editor must have been pushed to the brink of madness during the post-production process. The ending is such a lame contrivance that you are puzzled that the producer did not send the script back for major alteration before shooting even began.

It is a tribute to Natalie Portman that she holds this mess together, and even manages to keep the nausea meter at a tolerable level during the ending. Although you won't believe it from her ""Star Wars"" performances, Portman is really a fine actress. Although horribly miscast here (couldn't her character have been from rural Nebraska instead-thus not requiring that hillbilly accent?), she does manage to bring her character to life.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1119312000,2,1650,5.051470588235294
1270296,2,B00003CXIF,"They give us a bad name, I swear.

This one isn't terrible, but it's not something you would want to spend money on either. Natalie Portman plays a young pregnant woman abandoned at a Wal-Mart by her boyfriend who has dreams of becoming a star. She shacks it up at the Wal Mart where she actually delivers the baby one late night.

Ashley Judd and Stockard Channing play the supportive friends, the former a baby making machine that can't find the right guy, and the latter a hippie-esque type that takes her in. From tornados, to kidnappings, to terrible women-beaters and the sensitive and mysterious romantic interest, this movie has everything a Lifetime movie should except a barf bag.

It does have it's moments, and some are even funny. Judd, Channing, and Portman are all worthy actresses and they can turn any turkey into something at least watchable. And watchable it is if like me, you are stuck with nothing better to do and an older relative is in control of the television.  At least I didn't fall asleep or just go home.

Sally Field has an interesting cameo in this movie, and it is probably the most memorable scene in the whole flick.

More disturbing than anything about this bland movie is this glorification of small business undermining Wal Mart. I hate Wal Mart and all that it stands for, and I am pretty sure that were I in Novalee's predicament, I would have at least given birth in a dumpster before I let Wal Mart capitalize on me. What kept me from giving this a three star rating was the visual I had of this movie further promoting this decidedly evil empire. Sorry for the soap box rant, but I had a hard time getting past that particular point, and it made it difficult for me to like the movie more so than it would have anyway.

It is only in reading the reviews on this web site that I even knew that this movie was based on a book. Why freakin' Wal Mart? I am sure that the book is better than the movie - it always is, but I don't think I will be reading it any time soon.",1102982400,8,2010,4.372654155495979
1270297,5,B00003CXIF,"Based upon the book of the same name by Billie Letts, this film was a more than pleasant surprise. It is simply a compelling, absorbing, and unusual film. Well directed by television veteran Matt Williams, the movie exudes a certain folksy charm that grabs the viewer from the get go and keeps that viewer enthralled until the final scene.

The film centers around Novalee Nation (Natalie Portman), a very pregnant seventeen year old, who, with her boyfriend, lowlife Willy Jack Pickens (Dylan Bruno), pulls up to a Walmart's in Oklahoma where he abandons her. So, with virtually no money, literally barefoot and pregnant, and nowhere to go, she sets up camp in Walmart by night and explores the town by day, making friends with a number of memorable characters.

She unexpectedly has her baby at Walmart's, making her into a minor local celebrity. While at the hospital convalescing, she meets a sassy, brassy nurse, Lexie Coop (Ashley Judd), who befriends her. She is showered with gifts and her mother, Mama Lil (Sally Field), a floozy who discovers her daughter's whereabouts courtesy of the media hoopla, pays her a visit. Having abandoned her once before, she is there long enough for Novalee to be abandoned, yet again.

Along comes Thelma 'Sister' Husband (Stockard Channing), an eccentric but kindhearted recovering alcoholic who scoops Novalee and her baby up and takes her to her home. This would be the beginning of a whole new life for Novalee, one that would be enriched by the people whom she meets and the experiences, both good and bad, to which she is subjected. It becomes the story of her personal and emotional odyssey, as well as the story and growth of those with whom she most closely interacts. It is a story about life, relationships, responsibilities, love, and the ties that bind.

It is also the story of Willy Jack Pickens and the direction his life takes subsequent to his abandonment of Novalee. After some bad breaks, he gets talent agent, Ruth Meyers (Joan Cusack), to sign him on in hope of furthering a musical career. Unlike Novalee, however, he does not take well to the vicissitudes of life and begins a free fall in a downward spiral. His waterloo culminates in a dramatic meeting with Novalee after many years, a meeting that sets her free from her past, free to love the one person who loves her for herself.

Natalie Portman delivers her best performance to date. In the role of Novalee, she mixes innocence with wonder at what the world has to offer her. She adds a certain sweetness, poignancy, and determination to the role that translates into a wonderful vulnerability laced with steel. It is this quality that gives Novalee the will to go on when the odds are so against her, and that is just what Natalie Portman conveys to the viewer.

Stockard Channing is great as the eccentric and kind Thelma 'Sister' Husband, a woman who never had children of her own but is truly a mother at heart. Nurturing her garden, as well as Novalee and her baby, flowers and plants are not the only things that thrive under her care. A veritable Mother Earth, she is the kind of person who brings out the best in others, and Novalee and her baby are no exception. Stockard Channing, a great, though underrated actress, brings this home to the viewer in spades.

Ashley Judd is terrific as the wide-eyed, ""looking for love in all the wrong places"" Lexie. She comes across as sassy and brassy but is really only looking for someone to appreciate her for who she is and not for the sex she has to offer. Judd delivers the nuances that this role demands. James Frain is sensational as the shy, sensitive, and kind Forney Hull, the town librarian's brother who befriends Novalee. He plays the role with such vulnerability and imbues him with such goodness that the viewer cannot help but care deeply for him. It is also almost hard to believe that James Frain is British, as he has an American accent so down pat.

Dylan Bruno is perfect as Willie Jack Pickens, the country good old boy who ruins his own life and almost ruins Novalee's. Joan Cusack shows her deft comedic flair in the small, but memorable role of Ruth Meyers, and Sally Field leaves her mark in her cameo role as Novalee's mother. All in all, the entire cast gives stellar performances. This is a well-directed film that should not be missed.",1093910400,4,4336,4.711081794195251

Stockard Channing is fantastic in her roll as is Ashley Judd.  You must watch this film and I guarantee you will feel good when it is over.  I gave this movie 5 stars because it is such an entertaining film.  You don't have to close your eyes or grab your ears once throughout the whole thing.  A very pleasant change.

1270299,3,B00003CXIF,"20th Century Fox's ""Where The Heart Is"" Released in 2000, Directed by Matt Williams, is a stereotypical drama with a  predictable theme and a standard 'Chick-Flick' plot.  The dramatic theme of this movie is one of improving one's self, no matter what your beginnings or how hard life challenges you.  The main character, Nova Lee Nation (portrayed by Natalie Portman), exemplifies this triumphant spirit by starting the movie as a young pregnant trailer queen moving with her boyfriend to California.  She is then pushed to her lowest point when she is abandoned at a Wal-Mart in Sequoia, Oklahoma.  In an odd twist it is at this Wal-Mart that she is introduced to Sister Husband (Stockard Channing) who is later an important figure in her life.
  With no place to live, Nova Lee lives in the local Wal-Mart where she eventually has her child.  This event gives her her 15 minutes of fame as the mother of ""The Wal-Mart Baby"".  While recovering in the hospital she meets her new best friend (played by Ashley Judd).  When released from the hospital, she finds herself, again, without a place to stay.  This is when Sister Husband really comes to the rescue.
  Sister Husband takes in Nova Lee and her new child named Americus.  Things seem to be going well for everyone until a tornado hits the small Oklahoma town.  Sister Husband is killed in the tornado and it would again seem as though Nova Lee is stranded.  We soon find out, though, that Sister has left everything to Nova Lee in her will.  With what Sister Husband left her, Nova Lee is able to build herself a ""Home Without Wheels"" as Nova Lee calls it.
  Before long, Nova Lee decides that she is capable of much more than a Wal-Mart cashier.  She begins a photography career and is astonishingly good at it.  Even with her new found fortune and success, Nova Lee feels herself unworthy of the town librarian, the man she loves.  Because she feels insecure, she sends away the man of her dreams.  Predictably, though, she is brought to her senses by her best friends word's and rushes cross-country to reclaim her beau.
  I give this move 3 out of 5 stars.  The plot is quite predictable, and none of the intended twists are truly surprising.  The acting in this
movie is done well and there is enough humor and irony to keep a person interested, though.",1077062400,6,2315,4.637931034482759
1270300,1,B00003CXIF,"It's not that I didn't enjoy this film, but after finishing the book, I'd have to say that people who've seen the movie and haven't read the book have lucked out.  I've never read such a heart-warming story that really makes you think about life and how much there is to appreciate.  But, after I read the book I was curious as to how the movie measured up, and I'm sorry to say that the movie didn't.  The book has so much more going for it and really explains what goes on, not to mention, things that seem almost and completely different from the movie.  For an example, in the book there's a tragedy involving the local library, and the movie, well, nothing remotely compared to that happened.  The movie ended differently than I had expected, because there were key points left out that were in the book and not in the movie.
So please, read the book!  You will not be disappointed.  It's wonderful.",1065657600,9,904,4.442424242424242

1270371,2,B00003CXIF,"After seeing the previews for this movie, I really didn't expect a whole lot.  But this film was worse than I expected.  I was ready for a typical girl-power type movie--the downtrodden, hapless (but innocent at heart) girl who, in the end, is successful beyond belief (after learning some valuable lessons, of course), overcomes enormous obstacles, and finally finds a good man in the midst of the sea of male pigs.  Oh, and let's not forget the evil boyfriend or husband that, somehow, gets the bad stuff he deserves.
This movie contained all of those elements, but exaggerated to the extreme.  Novalee (Natalie Portman) is the ""Wal-Mart Mom""-- meaning she has her baby inside a Wal-Mart after her boyfriend abandons her.  From then on, its one bad thing after another.  In the space of two short hours, Novalee loses friends, has her daughter kidnapped, has a friend beat up and abused, and encounters a score of other huge difficulties, which in the end serve to empower and strengthen her.  Novalee and her friend (Ashley Judd) somehow manage to get knocked up by EVERY dirtball/sleazebag man in Oklahoma, and continuously have horrible experiences with men they thought were perfect.  Yet they never learn (at least, Judd doesn't).
All in all, this is a 'chick-flick' not worth anyone's time.  Don't even bother, because if you enjoy an engaging plot and anything more than a cookie-cutter, generic story with 5 times the crises of a normal drama, you'll be disappointed with Where the Heart Is.",1057622400,7,1501,4.924603174603175
1270372,5,B00003CXIF,"Where the Heart Is is a touching film about a young girl(Natalie Portman)who finds herself alone, and pregnant after her boyfriend abandons her at a Wal-Mart. With nowhere to go, and only five dollars to live off of, she has no choice but to make a home in the Wal-Mart. Hiding in the bathroom at closing time, and at opening, she spends the last few months of her pregnancy in the store, undetected. After she delivers ""The Wal-Mart Baby"" she has the help of her new friends to help her get back on her feet. During her journey she learns new things, forms many new friendships and finds out what true love really is. Along the way, she meets Thelma Husband,(Stockard Channing), a recovering alcoholic with a cheery spirit; Forney, the librarian; and Lexi Coop(Ashley Judd). This movie proves that, ""Home is where your history begins, and where the heart is.""
This film is a very warm movie full of compassion, and is a great Comedy-Drama. This movie may sound like a ""Chick Flick"", but it really isn't. This movie teaches you a lot of lessons about life, and will indeed bring a smile to your face. Natalie Portman and Ashley Judd give a great performance, with brilliant acting. The plot of the movie is not grim and depressing, it is the exact opposite. The plot is also simple, but still gives out a lot of meaning. Love, laughter and some tears are shown through the plot, but still is smooth going and very easy to understand.
The DVD also has great special features. You can watch the ""That's the Beat of a Heart"" music video sung by the Warren Brothers featuring Sara Evans, and see the theatrical trailers and TV spots.",1055721600,,1629,4.582191780821918
1270373,4,B00003CXIF,"I read the book (an Oprah's Book Club selection) before watching the movie. I also felt a little proud because the author was once my teacher at Southeastern Oklahoma State University, so I went into the movie with quite a bit of favoritism.
I didn't like Natalie Portman as Novalee. Natalie is the not by any means the type of girl who'd end up dumped at a Wal-Mart, and that makes her portrayal of Novalee unbelievable. Ashley Judd was WAY too Hollywood-esque (is that a word?) for Lexie, who in the book wore a size 22. In my mind, Stockard Channing was a deadringer for Sister Husband, with a quirky sense of humor and fornicatin' on the kitchen table.
The movie makes for good, easy viewing. You won't need a Ph. D. in psychology to figure it out, and you won't think you missed anything important if you have to get up to get another drink from the fridge. It's kind of like a big screen Lifetime movie.
I recommend to anyone even remotely interested to read the book, too. Preferably before watching the movie. Although the movie is loosely based on the book, you'll get a much better feel for Novalee's plight from the author.",1054598400,,1134,4.509708737864078

The ENTIRE charm of this book are the characters and the way their lives become intertwined.  The movie barely touches on this aspect of the book, and where the book literally evokes emotions from the reader, the movie fails miserably.  The lines are so stilted.  The scenes are so chopped up and so many characters in the book missing or undeveloped, it's hard to follow.  On the one hand, if you read the book, you can follow the movie a little better.  Had I seen this movie cold without having read the book, I would have thought it hard to follow.  However, if you read the book first, the movie is such a disappointment.  The casting of the actor who portrayed Moses Whitecotton was excellent, but they hardly touched on the depth of his character, which was such a waste.  Ashley Judd did a great job as Lexie Coop, and Natalie Portman, although quite cute, came nowhere near to exuding the charm and innocence of Novalee Nation personality-wise.  Stockard Channing has SO much talent, but as Sister Husband, Hollywood cut the soul of the character as portrayed in the book down to just about nothing in the flick.  The book warmed your heart and soul, made you angry, made you cheer out loud, made you cry. It left you wanting for more.

1270561,2,B00003CXIF,"There are movies you really want to like but can't. This is especially true of movies that are gentle and well intentioned but not well made. Where the Heart Is falls into this group, although it should appeal to some viewers who are less worldly and more forgiving than myself.
The movie opens in the boondocks of Tennessee. A very pregnant Novalee Nation [Natalie Portman] and her redneck boyfriend, Willy Jack [Dylan Bruno] are about to take off to California in a beat up old car. Why is it that such characters in the movies invariably head for the Golden State? Is it some kind of rule of script writing? In Oklahoma, Willy lets Novalee go into a Walmart to buy some shoes and promptly leaves her there for reasons that go mainly unexplained. Broke, tired and hungry, she literally lives in the store for six weeks. During the hours it is open, she wanders around town meeting various eccentric characters. One is Thelma [Stockard Channing], a recovering alcoholic who runs the local welcome wagon. She becomes a mother figure to Novalee. Another is Forney Hall [James Frain], who is the assistant librarian. His sister is the head librarian but is always too drunk to work. One rainy night Novalee goes into labor in the locked up Walmart. Forney, who's been following her, jumps through a window and rescues her. In the hospital she meets Lexie {Ashley Judd], who seems to be the head nurse. Since Lexie has had five children by five different fathers, it would seem that her training did not include birth control. Novalee goes to live with Lexie, and soon she and her new friends are having enough trials and tribulations to bring down an entire herd of elephants.
The problem is the script, which leaves the talented cast to perform as best they can. The story borders on being incoherent, with many scenes being simply skits or vignettes poorly strung together. There are too many stops and starts. As a result, it is hard to get close to these people, no matter how much trouble they are going though. What is exceptionally irritaiting is that the movie's style makes the characters almost dull when they could have been interesting.
Where the Heart Is based on a novel by Billie Lotts. I'm not familiar with it, Since it was one of Oprah's Book Club's selections, I assume a lot of people are. Only these readers can know how faithful the movie is to the book.",1016409600,2,2374,4.6682577565632455

It was a surprise, and I really liked it. Natalie Portman, Ashley Judd and Stockard Channing, all gave wonderful performances,and this is a quiet, down home flick that should be enjoyed slowly. No rushing through. :)",1015632000,,384,5.111111111111111
1270563,4,B00003CXIF,"As ""white-trash-girl-makes-good"" stories go, ""Where The Heart Is"" can't hold a candle to ""Ruby In Paradise,"" Victor Nunez's early-1990s film, which oddly enough starred the utterly luminous Ashley Judd in her first movie role, playing opposite ""In The Bedroom"" director Todd Field as her eccentric boyfriend.  That film got all the anger, determination, self-sufficiency and pride of a true up-from-the-bootstraps heroine just right, without any sentimentality or the overuse of gushy country songs.  However, that said, WTHI is the best thing Natalie Portman has done so far, it showcases Judd in all her mature, ripe-to-busting sardonic glory, and is the only movie in which James Frain is actually sort of softly sexy and not icky (unlike his roles in ""Elizabeth"" and ""An Awfully Big Adventure,"" not to mention scads of other Brit indies -- you do know he's English, don't you?).  And of course, it features yet another intelligently self-aware supporting turn by the vastly underrated Stockard Channing.  I guess this film is definitely worth seeing, all things considered.",1013817600,,1077,5.355029585798817

I turned on the television and 'Where the Heart is' was on one of the movie channels and what caught my attention was the actress Natalie Portman. She is the splitting image of an ex girlfriend of mine so I began to watch. The movie was so interesting that i ended up being 2 hours late for my appointment. I immediately went online for information about the film as well the actress Natalie Portman. I was shocked that AMG gave it two out of five stars. This movie is now one of my favorite movies to watch. I believe that Natalie will be very big soon and I'm not saying that because she looks like my ex girlfriend.,1011571200,,725,4.148936170212766
1270568,5,B00003CXIF,"All in all, this was a surprisingly entertaining and heartwarming film, the kind that makes you say ""awnnn, isn't that nice?""  No, definitely not for your action film fans, but most people should find this movie easy to like.  Yes, there are some difficult-to-believe plot twists and plot holes (why did Novalee's mother drive all that way just to steal her $500, never to be mentioned again in the course of the movie?), but if you suspend your disbelief slightly, it's an immensely enjoyable journey.  Oh, and that Natalie...[sigh].  How could Forney not fall in love with her?  She's so...utterly loveable.  Yes, the very beautiful and charming Ms. Portman's role as the main character didn't hurt the movie for me either.  I think I went through the whole movie dreamy-eyed and drunk on her beauty.  And I especially liked how this movie praised the honourable ""nice guys"" in the world.  Yes, the girls (Portman and Judd) start off going after those motorcyle-riding bad boys, but by the end of the movie, both girls ""grow up"" and discover the inner beauty of the more lacklustre but well-deserving good guys.",1010707200,6,1113,4.877659574468085
1270679,5,B00003CXIF,"I had my doubts about this movie, I have to admit. I rented it before I bought it, but it only took me five minutes to realize this is a keeper. I thought Natalie Portman's portrayal of Novalee Nation was dead-on right; this girl has the gift of making us believe she really IS the character and not just an actor giving the part lip-service. I have to give very high marks to Ashley Judd, too, as her Lexie definitely has the right touch of independence and vulnerability that is rare in movies these days.
But the real scene stealers are Stockard Channing and James Frain. Channing's Sister Husband is just so ... funny, so interesting, so loveable. I laughed every time she prayed for forgiveness! And James Frain ... the best friend any girl would want, the man so many of us look for throughout our lives ... you find yourself HOPING long before the end of the movie that he and Novalee get together.
The nicest thing about this movie is that the vulnerability is written into each character. It's there, just below the surface, but the underlying strength and determination of each of them to make a better life is the basis of the friendship. True to small town life, each of them knows what's going on in the others' lives and the friendships are real, solid, strong, and true. Yes, it's a feel-good movie ... a chick-flick, if you like. But the basic fact is that it isn't about flash, glitz, glammer or excitement. It's about people who care for one another, who want to be there for each other. It's about LIFE!",1009756800,3,1522,4.498194945848375
1270680,5,B00003CXIF,"Where the Heart is caught me quite by surprise.  When I watched this I cried, laughed and felt great at the end.  The story is based on a book about a girl who is pregnant and 15, and has to live and give birth in a Wal-Mart. Natalie Portman shines, showing her true talent as an actress.  Ashley judd is also excellent.  This movie is a perfect example of one that can be great without have a huge budget for special effects and actors.  I also highly recommend the soundtrack and the book by the same name, the book is just as good with some parts not in the movie.  The soundtrack features a beautiful song played thoughout the movie called ""That's the Beat of a Heart"".  Where The Heart Is was very underrated, it did not get the attention it deserved.

1270681,4,B00003CXIF,I think that this movie is good as a PG-13 movie.  If it was rated as an R rated movie I wouldnt think it would be the same.  This movie had many funny parts that would be good for all audincences.  In my opinon I think that this would be a good family movie.  In an R rated movie its usally a dirty comedy with lots of cursing  or comic mischeif but this movie had neither.  This movie to me seemed more of a love comedy.  It shows how strangers help each can help each other and become friends and that you can find love in the stranges of places.  Where the Heart Is is a movie that will make you laugh and think about life.,1005177600,,627,3.9206349206349205
1270682,3,B00003CXIF,"Natalie Portman stars as Novalee Nation in this film about a simple southern girl who begins a complex life of twists, turns, and anything else imaginable when her boyfriend abandons her and her unborn child at an out-of-state Wal-Mart.  There is no way to adequately summarize the plot, as it feels much like several episodes of a mediocre sitcom thrown together into one viewing.  It is this jumbled insanity that lends the film a quick flow, though this flow at times becomes almost ridiculous.
Portman and her costars do an excellent job of bringing there simple southern personas to life.  The characters, while not very layered, gave a warmth to the story, despite their oddities (of which there were plenty, if not too many).  The subtle developments between Forney and Novalee gave the film a well-suited romantic charge without becoming a chick flick.  Overall, this story performs and entertains on several levels.
The PG-13 rating is well deserved.  Turning anyone under 17 away from any movie only because of language seems more ludicrous than any of the off-the-wall situations we see in Where the Heart Is.  Afterall, heart can be found in the harshest words of all sometimes.",1005177600,,1190,4.97979797979798
1270683,3,B00003CXIF,"I believe that PG-13 is an appropriate rating for the movie ""Where the Heart Is.""  There were situations, adult language, and sexual overtones which would or might be inappropriate for younger kids, yet rated R would be too strong a rating since the ""F"" word was not used.  I also feel that 13-17 year olds would be interested in the themes and content of the film.  That age group would also not be offended by the occasional use of profane language.
Parents of pre-teens may not want or think their children are ready for seeing a teen pregnancy and think their kids don*t need to see this to look up to her in any way. There are also abuse situations which came about to Novelee*s friend Lexi and two of her children which may also be inappropriate for those under 13.
Over all the movie seemed very real to life, but it*s not something I*d willingly go to see.",1005177600,,864,4.421383647798742
1270684,5,B00003CXIF,"The movie Where The Heart Is is rated PG-13, and I believe that is a suitable rating for this film.  The younger audiences, 12 and under, may not understand the ""love"" and/or ""sexual"" aspects of the film.  The story of a young girl giving birth to her child in a Walmart where she was left by her scum of a boyfriend who is striving to be a musician, may not interest them at all.  Children of that age group may prefer a Disney movie or something with a little more action.
 This film definitly should not be rated R because it doesn't have the qualities that make an R movie.  The qualities include: Profane language, nudity, a lot of violence, and explict sexual content.  An R rating may mislead viewers into thinking this film is more vulgar then what it is. Therefore the pg-13 rating definitly applies to this movie.  The audiences between the ages of 13-17 can easily follow the storyline and not be offended by the mild use of profane words.",1005177600,,950,4.456647398843931

Christians kidnapping a baby and abandoning her in the manger of a Nativity scene?
Yes, so much could have gone wrong... but it doesn't.  Instead, Portman, Judd, Frain, and others (even Sally Field, who I usually abhor), turn in massively understated performances, downplaying all that is bizarre about this film.

In this town she meets Froney who wants nothing more than to love her, and Lexi (Ashley Judd) who becomes the sister she never had, as well as Sister Husband who becomes her surrogate mother.
This an extraordinary tale about family, and helping strangers who then become friends.
Novelee eventually becomes a photographer influenced by Moses Whitecotton, the regular baby photographer at the WalMart.
This movie is much about the trials and tribulations of life, including: the rape and beating of Lexi by her boyfriend, who also rapes her little boy Brownie, as well as a visit by Novelee's mother in the hospital when she gives birth simply to rob her blind, along with a tornado killing Sister Husband leaving all she has to Novelee, allowing her to build a home of her own.

Commercialization of entertainment appears to be the wave of the future, and this reviewer objects to it vehemently. With that said, this is a great film. The actors are entirely convincing, and the attentive viewer quickly becomes engrossed in their (ficticious) emotions. This was the first Natalie Portman film I have seen, and she shines as the poor, down and out country girl who never gives up her dreams. Judd, Bruno, Channing, and Frain all excel in their supporting roles, as does Sally Field in a cameo as Portman's character's mother. Even the actors with minor roles are excellent - especially Joan Cusack as the curt Ruth Meyers, and Keith David as Moses Whitecotten,  the compassionate photographer. The kind townspeople seem almost too good to be true. But this is a film about hope, and teaches that it is important to never give up on your dreams, and it conveys that message well. As a male, I am both proud and embarrassed to admit that this is one of very few films that got me teary-eyed in more than one scene.

And this movie is not just good, but, in my opinion it's one of the sweetest, down-to-earth movies, I've seen in a long time.  Sure, maybe the part about living in a Wal-Mart is unbelievable, I'll give you that, but the rest of the movie (and the Wal-Mart part is only like 20 minutes of the movie), is superbly written.  I wasn't a fan of Natalie Portman until this movie, she does an incredible job of the young girl growing up.  I think the movie shows how the worst of situations can always be turned around by how you handle things.  Sure it may not win any awards, and I'm not a fan of Joan Cusack or Sally Field but this movie really does portray how the average person works, lives, handles day to day problems.

I am so glad I did.  I was very pleasantly surprised that the storyline was kept to.
Portman plays an excellent Novalee.  She is lovable, and portrays the unusual girl perfectly.
Fornie, is also very well executed.
I am so thrilled that when they made this film that they did not drop some of the story because it was difficult to deal with.
This survey of human emotion is nearly as good as the book.  If you haven't read the book yet, do!  It is excellent as well.

1270902,5,B00003CXIF,"What can I say...this one is a heartwarmer to the extreme.  I watched this movie at a time in my life when I was having problems with family , work, and friends.  This movie moved me and changed my way of thinking forever.  It's the story of a young pregnant woman who gives birth in Wal-Mart after being abandoned by her boyfriend.  She unwillingly becomes famous and the world dubs her little girl ""the Wal-Mart Baby"".  From then on she happens upon the help and support from an unusual collection of new friends and supporters.  Mom and baby survive gossip, abduction, tornados and loss of great friends. The performances by Ashley Judd and Natalie Portman are amazing.  After watching ""Where the Heart Is"" I was inspired to reorganize my own life for the better.  I concentrated on making my dreams become reality, I renewed old friendships, and most importantly, I found a new vigor for life and strength.  This is a movie you must buy because seeing it just once is never enough.  I'm sure I have watched it over 12 times now that I own it.

Basically, the story is about Novalee Nation and her journey of life where she meets various people who sometimes help her, and sometimes don't. Its kind of like ""The Wizard Of Oz"" because of all the characters and how they help one another. What I recommend is you to read the book ""Where The Heart Is"" by Billie Leets first, and then watch the movie. The book is very enjoyable. You'll be able to spot a few difference between the movie and the book.",986342400,,624,4.379310344827586
1271074,4,B00003CXIF,"This is one of those movies that one would have to be heartless not to like.  Made from the novel of the same name by the author Billie Letts, this is the story of Novalee Nation, a 17 year old pregnant teenager who has nothing and gains everything when she is stranded in a small Oklahoma town by her self-centered boyfriend.
  Novalee has had a hard life.  Abandoned by her mother as a child, she became a foster child and then, reared mostly in poverty, fell into that pattern that unfortunately, so many poor and uneducated young women seem to find.  She is a high school drop-out and pregnant at 17 with a guy who at best can be described as selfish and abusive.  They make a fine pair as they set off for the dreamland of California.  Unbeknownst to Novalee, her boyfriend has no intention of delivering her to the West Coast.  He abandons her in a Wal-Mart parking lot after she goes inside to buy shoes to replace the ones that fell through the floor of the ""rustbucket"" they are driving to California.
  Rather than panic, Novalee makes the best of her situation and eventually takes up residence in the store.  She eats their food and uses a sleeping bag from the camping department to sleep in.  She avoids the night crew and manages to keep a roof over her head until she has her baby.  Novalee becomes an instant celebrity when the birth is announced all over TV and the fact that Wal-Mart offers her a job shows the compassion of such a large organization.  She eventually meets up with the mother who abandoned her years before and things seem to gel; well, that doesn'tt happen and Novalee finds herself alone again.
  Through the good will of Sister Husband, played with incredible sensitivity, humor and caring by Stockard Channing, Novalee again has a roof over her head.  She takes the job at Wal-Mart and attempts to reconstruct her life.  In the process, she meets many people who have nothing but a positive effect on her life.  There is Forney Hall, the ""too well educated"" dreamer who serves as de facto librarian while caring for his alcoholic older sister, and there is also Lexie Coop, played to perfection by Ashley Judd.  Lexie is another of the downtrodden; she  sleeps with men too easily and winds up with far too many children as a result of her lack of planning.
  As the movie progresses, we watch Novalee mature and her daughter, Americus grow up.  Along the way, Forney falls for her and Lexie has more children.  Sister Husband is the cement that binds them all together.  As we begin to hope that Novalee will finally find some degree of happiness, tragedy strikes and she finds herself alone again.  A benefactor emerges and Novalee is able to have a home for herself and her daughter.
  Novalee's ex also moves along with his life and he finds an agent for his budding C&W career.  Over the five years since he deserted Novalee, he has never once contacted her or inquired about the child they had.  He is the epitome of selfishness and he seems to have learned nothing.
  This is one of those movies that have elements of predictability to it and yet, the touching nature of the relationships between Novalee, Sister Husband, Forney, Moses Whitecotton and others is what makes this movie work.  While it is depressing in points, it does its best not to pander to the poorer people at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder in America.  Neither does it show them as people without hope, who resort to criminality to make their way in the world.
  This is a heartwarming movie because it shows that Americans, especially those in the mid-west and south are incredibly caring and giving people.  There is no nobility in poverty and yet, there is still charity.  These people are folks who would give you the last food in their fridge, the coat off their backs and their bed to sleep in.  And Novalee is not one to take advantage.  She gives as much as she gets and she is there for her friends when they need her.
  This is a movie about the giving nature that we find in our hearts.  It is a movie about love and generosity, giving and maturing and it is also a movie about forgiveness.  If you want to see a movie that will genuinely leave you feeling good when it ends, then you must see this movie.  The author Billie Letts captured the spirit and essence of these poor but loving Oklahomans to a tee.  It is to the actor's, producer's and director's credit that all that Letts wrote about in her fine novel transitioned so well to the screen.
  I knew when I saw this movie in the theaters last year that I would buy this movie for my collection.  Well, I have and I recommend it without reservation to all who aspire to know ""where the heart is.""

1271078,4,B00003CXIF,"This movie is one of those films that you pick up from the store when there is nothing else to rent ... and you are glad you did.
While the plot sounds really contrived, the actors and actresses in this film make it almost believable. And, it is one of the most heartwarming, feel good movies I have seen in quite some time.
Natalie Portman is excellent as Novalee Nation, the girl who has the Walmart baby. While you know what is going to happen, the actions leading up to the moment are a gem. Keeping a very exacting record of what she owes the Walmart adds to the situation, making you like Novalee even more.
Of course, this is a film about the downtrodden. Novalee is in her situation due to her no good boyfriend dumping her on his way to a Country Music career. The rest of the characters in the film share in this misery. From Forney Hall, a brilliant dreamer stuck in a library to Sister Husband (Stockhard Channing), who fornicates a lot, and finally Lexie Coop (Ashley Judd), who has too many children by bad men, the humanity of the ""lower rungs"" of society shines through.
Contrasted to the majority of films that highlight lower income families, displaying them as criminal victims, this film is refreshing in its humanity.
The only weak point is the love story that between Novalee and Forney. Throughout most of the movie it is not much more than a convenient plot device. At some times, it is downright distracting. However, in the end, it show the difference between Novalee and her ex-boyfriend.
If you would like to see a film that will make you feel good about America, this is it. At times it is a bit Pollyannic, but it is a bit more believable.",982540800,28,1669,4.475409836065574

1271080,4,B00003CXIF,"I loved this movie.  It was so down-to-earth, so seemingly real.  (Even if it is very hard to believe that Natalie Portman and Ashley Judd are typical trailer trash.)  From start to finish it was a great story, and of course, it produced a few tears to the eye.
This is by no means a fast-paced action packed movie.  Instead it lulls you into a sense of belonging as you watch the emotions and events played out slowly before you.  If you're like me you'll love every character that you get to know.  In a way, it's like reading a book: a more intimate experience than your average movie.  (And I'm going to read the book!)  This is the kind of movie you'd like to watch once every few years, just to remind yourself to smile and to have hope.  Okay, okay, it's a chick flick through and through, but they are the best type!!
And I wanted to become a photographer even more than usual as I watched Novalee's passion for her camera grow and develop (excuse the pun) as she gained confidence in herself.

1271082,3,B00003CXIF,"As someone who cringes at films hailed as ""Heartwarming!"", I initially shied away from this picture, but on a particularly bad day, I needed some cheering up so I rented it, and was pleasantly surprised that my mood changed.  However, when I started to think about this film a little more in depth, I realized it isn't just a lighthearted piece of fluff about the misadventures of an uneducated, naive girl who happens upon some damn good luck in her life.  ""Where the Heart Is"" attempts to tackle some very serious issues, such as teen pregnancy, absent fathers, mental illness, and child abuse.  Yet like the rest of the story, and most of the characters, it barely skims the surface, just touching on them before glossing it over with a layer of sweetness and light.  Perhaps that's why it lifted my spirits: it never got bogged down with the serious issues, and continued blithely along with Novalee and Americus, her cute little girl with the horrid name.
""Where the Heart Is"" is first and foremost a fairy tale.  Rarely does a teenage mother without the support of a husband/boyfriend/girlfried/what-have-you experience the good fortune of meeting compassionate individuals offering food, shelter, and means to an income, as well as the veritable knight in a stocking cap, who not only manages to deliver the baby, but falls in love with her as well.  While the film optimistically shows that good things can result from a seemingly hopeless situation, it should still be taken with a grain of salt.  It is, after all, Hollywood, dressed up (or down) to look like middle America.",979084800,2,1585,4.848148148148148

1271182,5,B00003CXIF,"I believe that this movie gives us the ups and downs of life, without which we would not become who we are.  The main character, Novalee Nation,  as a teenager stands for a noble child not ruined in virtue, even though she is left to fend for herself. She accepts the help of others not totally morally adept, but nonetheless she accepts them as they accept her.  The love interest, Forney, is just the man she needs-kind, loyal and caring of the baby girl, who eventually gains a strong, resilient name.  I must admit I was a sucker for this romance story.

1271183,4,B00003CXIF,"""Where the Heart Is"" is one hell of a movie; that's all I can say about it. Most critics did not care for the storyline's tendency to jump in between plotlines numerous times, but I found it very easy to follow, and very humorous and heartfelt as well. The acting talent for the movie is superb, the best I've seen in a film like this. And the story will have you have you laughing and leave you touched.
Novalee Nation is about to embark on another journey, this one being with her boyfriend, who is also the father of her baby. She has never really had a family life, and her willingness to create a family for her unborn child blinds her to the mistreatment of her boyfriend. While on the road, they stop at a Wal-Mart so she can use the bathroom and buy a new pair of shoes. When she comes out, her boyfriend is gone, and she is left with nothing but a pair of shoes, the change from her purchase, and her Polaroid camera. Stuck without a place to go, she hides out in the Wal-Mart, living there during the night and keeping a journal of the things she uses so she can pay back the store. She begins meeting the people around town, one being Sister Husband, who immediately takes a liking to Novalee and her unborn child. Novalee also meets Forney, the local librarian who also cares for his insane ill sister. That same nigh, Novalee gives birth to her baby, and becomes famed for giving birth to the ""Wal-Mart Baby."" While in the hospital, she meets up with Lexie, who has four of her own children. Novalee soon finds security amongst her new friends, and learns that life is what you make it out to be.
Not having read the novel by Billie Letts on which the movie is based, I cannot make an honest comparison of the two. But I feel that the movie is terrific still, regardless of its differences from the book. The story does take a lot of little twists and turns, but they're not so big that you need to pay so much attention to them in order to grasp the changes at hand going on in Novalee's life. The way in which everything falls into place is very touching and heartfelt, especially in the beginning third of the film. The audience truly feels sorry for Novalee as she is left alone at the Wal-Mart to fend for herself.
The cast of this movie shines like a lantern on a foggy night. There has never been a better ensemble of actors to play such emotional characters in any movie I've ever seen. Natalie Portman makes a huge splash as Novalee, and her sweet sense of manners and Southern lilt all work in conveying her charming nature. Ashley Judd is a riot as Lexie, and while this is a totally different and new role for Judd to be playing, she walks into it like it is natural to her. Stockark Channing is a smash as Sister Husband, the woman who takes Novalee into her home. The way in which she plays out her character is genuinely superb, and I can't think of anyone else who could pull it off.
While this is mostly going to appeal to fans of the novel and women, ""Where the Heart Is"" is a charming and delightful slice of comedy that is touching, very heartfelt, and gives us a sense of homeliness.",977270400,2,3117,4.302721088435374

But this film gives us many warm, touching scenes along with a gushy and improbable happy ending.  And most of all it gives us Natalie Portman, surely the prettiest young thing of the season.  When Miss Portman is on the screen, the story's banality and the production's general haphazardness don't really seem to matter.

Of course, this movie only shows us 5 years of Novalee's life, but it's still a treat.  I only had two complaints.  One, the movie seemed very long.

1271292,4,B00003CXIF,"This film is a bittersweet human-interest story with a side order of romance.  The story has a country flavor, plenty of country music and a story that could serve as the film version of the typical lyrics of any country music CD.  It is replete with bad decisions, bad luck and tragedies at every turn.  It is sappy, corny, stereotypical, and unfortunately full of the types of things that really happen in rural America.  Despite this seething despondency, it has an upbeat fatalism that suggests that at least for some of the people, the struggle against bad breaks and hard times pays off.
The story follows the life of Novalee Nation (Natalie Portman), poor young girl setting out to start a new life with her no account boyfriend.  When Novalee makes a rest stop at a Wal-Mart in Oklahoma, he ditches her, literally leaving her there barefoot and pregnant.  Having only five dollars to her name, she takes up residence in the Wal-Mart and ultimately has the baby there.  She becomes a minor celebrity and she is adopted by the Welcome Wagon lady.  The remainder of the film examines the various relationships and experiences she has in this small town over the next seven or eight years.
The story is charming and steeped in sentiment.  The character development of Novalee is excellent, although Director Matt Williams could have spent more time on some of the supporting characters, especially Sister Husband (Stockard Channing).  To his credit, the film was nicely shot, and the tornado scene was fabulous.
Natalie Portman's performance was her best to date.  She played the part with a near helpless determination that made her a very attractive and lovable character.  Her southern accent was terrible, but her portrayal of the rural southern attitude was on target.  Though the part didn't have a lot of range, she was extremely effective with the emotional element, and elicited great sympathy and admiration for her response to her desperate situation.
Stockard Channing was wonderful as the eccentric Welcome Wagon lady.  I would have liked to see this part expanded, just to see more of Channing.  She was enchantingly warm and peculiar.  James Frain was also very good as Forney.  He made the character very interesting and affable.  He continues to be a solid supporting actor who has shown himself to be extremely versatile (Hilary and Jackie, Reindeer Games, Titus).  Ashley Judd added another fine performance to her resume, with a free spirited portrayal of Lexie.
This was a nice story with an agreeable and upbeat ending.  I rated it a 7/10.  Add a point if you are a woman or if you have ever lived in a mobile home.  It will find its most enthusiastic audience with women due to its extreme sentimentality, but it is not so ""female"" that it can't be enjoyed by men, making it a good date movie.",970704000,4,2820,4.83125

I have read the book twice, and loved the suspense of will they or won't they (Novalee and Forney), but in the movie version there was hardly any suspense, everything just happened.  Also, many events and characters that helped build the story were also cut out of the movie.  It seemed like the story was rewritten, leaving some great parts out.  But through the faults of the movie, it was pretty good.  The plot was generally the same, which was good, but it lacked in some areas.  I recommend it for anybody who hasn't read the book, you'll greatly enjoy it!",970358400,,659,4.45
1271296,5,B00003CXIF,"I don't usually watch this kind of movie because I usually get bored when things get too deep, but a trustworthy friend recommended it and I must say that I didn't regret buying this DVD!
It is a wonderful story, told with humour and a smile, and without sentimentality and broody self-indulgence. The acting is way over the top and I was particulary inpressed with Natalie Portman that nails that trailer-trash character in the beginning and every stage in the evolution to come just as perfectly.
It would have been nice with some decent extras on this DVD, but the movie itself is worth every cent so I'm really not complaining. But still, the price is above average so one would expect a bit more than a few trailers/tv-spots and a music video...
Anyway, don't let this dissuade you from buying it! - Do it or you'll miss a small masterpiece!",970272000,,846,4.6092715231788075
1271297,4,B00003CXIF,"The acting alone eclipsed the unoriginal directing in this picture. Miss Portman gave a wonderful Julia Roberts like performance. It did remind you of Forrest Gump a little, but it was a great movie to watch. sentimental and funny.",970012800,,231,4.948717948717949
1271298,5,B00003CXIF,"I loved this movie, it was funny, it was sad, just great.  I want everyone to see this movie.  Just think, living in a Walmart. One of the best movies you will see!",969753600,,164,3.9393939393939394
1271299,5,B00003CXIF,"I thought this  movie was so Good! it had a familiar tone to it like a modern day wizard of Oz it is definetly a Must See! I can't wait to own it myself. All performances from Ashley Judd,Natalie Portman,Stockard Channing,and Sally Field were well done and quite entertaining.",969753600,,276,4.63265306122449
1271300,1,B00003CXIF,"This film is awful, the kind of botch-up portrait of ""small town"" life that only Hollywood can churn out. Natalie Portman looks like she's fourteen. The first half hour plays like a commercial for Wal-Mart. The most inane subplot of the year in which the a**hole boyfriend tries to make it as a sangin' star. Horrible misuse of the wonderful Joan Cusack--this should be a hanging crime, friends. Worst of all, there doesn't really seem to be much of a relationship between Natalie Portman and her daughter... every note rings false in this movie. I hated it. After this and Diane Keaton's awful ""Hanging Up"", guys have every reason to be wary of so-called ""Chick Flicks"".",969667200,7,671,4.793103448275862
1271390,1,B00003CXIF,This movie is the worst excuse for entertainment ever. DO NOT BUY!,968544000,2,66,4.583333333333333
1271391,4,B00003CXIF,"Natalie POrtman and Ashley Judd. both great. this movie reminded me of Forrest Gump... with the way it was told, the surreal nature of the movie,  and the lovable and interesting characters.  You'll laugh, you'll cry,  you'll down right drool. This movie is fantastic... the characters  everything was just great. but the main problem with the movie is the  directing.... it's really bad.... the director does horrible editing from  one scene to another. he nearly literally puts in a pointless scene with  something dramatic and so on.... the director really sucks and nearly  ruined the whole movie for me because it started off good and then half way  it went back and forth from crap to gump, from gump to crap.....
but  it's still worth the watch, and possibly worth the purchase.",967593600,4,785,4.878787878787879
1271392,5,B00003CXIF,"I absolutely loved this movie. I kept putting it off and putting it off, but when I finally saw it, I was glad I did. I cried, I laughed; it was the  best movie I had seen in a long time. Ashley Judd and Natalie Portman both  excelled in their roles. I would recommend this movie to everyone.",966902400,6,292,4.017241379310345
1271393,5,B00003CXIF,"I loved this movie - saw it at the theater 5 times.  Of course, my favorite scene (next to the porch scene with Novalee and Dixie) was the  scene in the Wal Mart at the beginning where Novalee first goes in, and a  little boy is having his picture made by Moses Whitecotton.  What an  adorable child - oh, by the way - he is my son!",966643200,2,332,3.8955223880597014
1271394,5,B00003CXIF,"""Where the Heart Is"" is definately a sensational movie that I recommend very highly. Natalie Portman does an outstanding performance and  is truly one of the most sophisticated young actresses that I have ever  seen. She is definately wise beyond her years. Ashley Judd also does a  wonderful job in this drama as Novalee's (Natalie) best friend. They are  there for each other every step of the way. I have to say, they have one of  the closest relationships in a movie that I have ever seen! Even though  Natalie plays a young mother in this movie she definately makes her  character sophisticated. She knows how to handle herself and her family,  and will do anything for them. I support this movie all the way! I hope  each and every one of the people that buys this movie enjoys it as much as  I did! Heck, I've seen it twice at the theatre and I'm most definately  going to order it!",966384000,4,889,4.459627329192546
1271395,5,B00003CXIF,I LOVE this movie! It is my new favorite movie and i have been waiting for it to come out on video since i saw it in the theaters! I read the book AFTER i saw the movie and i think the movie was better. The movie had more  comedy in it and it was a little different in a lot of ways. I loved it  SOOOO much that i have started a website on it.,966384000,,343,3.5
1271396,4,B00003CXIF,"Yes, even a guy can handle this movie. Not a typical chick flick; it was actually entertaining with not too much ""Beaches"" or  ""Mermaids"" stuff that men run away from. Natalie Portman does a  great job of playing her character, but you can tell she's capable of much  more. And much respect goes out to her for refusing to be in the movie  until they cut out a sex scene.",966211200,,371,4.257142857142857
1271397,1,B00003CXIF,"I was on a trip to California and we stopped off at a Wal-Mart, well since I like to read so much I decided to buy Where ""The Heart Is"" one  of the best books I have ever read. Well two days later I seen that  ""Where The Heart Is"" was on Paper View so I paid for the movie  and it is nothing like the book, I am not kidding when I say ""I can  show you more that 100 mistakes it 'Where The Heart Is' so go and read the  book, don't watch that trash movie."" And for all of you who don't like  to read, buy the Audio Book, just DON'T BUY OR RENT THE MOVIE ""WHERE  THE HEART IS."" Now the actors and actreeses did a great job is they  had only had a better screen play. This write here goes to the Screen Play  writer/s of ""Where The Heart Is,"" get your act together when you  are making a movie from the book. And don't tell me that you can't because  I know and everybody else that is reading this also knows that with todays  technology you can do just about anything that you wanted to do. And then  let us decide if we like it or not, ask us the people the viewer what we  want not what you want. I spent $10.00 just to see a movie that I thought  was going to be as good as the book, but Hollywood had to go and SCREW it  up! If you agree with what I'm saying, you have the power to stop what  Hollywood is doing to our books. E-mail this review to all of your friends  and family and maybe we can make a difference in how Hollywood makes some  of our books into movies.",966124800,5,1471,3.8112582781456954
1271398,4,B00003CXIF,I thought this was a very good movie.  I loved how the friendships in the movie were so close and everything turns out how it is supposed to.  it's a  good movie to watch anytime again and again!,965952000,,195,4.078947368421052
1271399,5,B00003CXIF,"When I first heard of this movie, my first thought was sappy, trashy, chick flick, and boy was I ever wrong! This movie captivated me from the  first few words with the lead character, Novalee Nation (Natalie Portman)  and her struggles to survive in a world where judgemental, and harsh people  ruled. Her ability to overcome the reality of her situation as a single  mother who was forced to live in a Wal-Mart (Yeah, I know, Wal-Mart, it's  not that exciting, but it adds character to the person she is and where she  started to where she ended.) until the birth of her child, to become the  strong successful woman she had always dreamed about being.
The power of  this movie blew me away with the amazing cast of characters who all had  their little successes. Stockard Channing and the always amazing James  Frain kept my attention with their oustanding abilities as actors. Kudos to  this movie, it is a must see for everyone!",965865600,4,933,4.628048780487805
