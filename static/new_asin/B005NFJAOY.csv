4846200,4,B005NFJAOY,"Patrick Naugle, DVD Verdict --Directed by Bill Philputt and narrated by actor Brian Peck (who had a substantial role in the classic original), More Brains! A Return to the Living Dead covers a lot of bases, including the genesis of the project (which was originally to have been helmed by The Texas Chain Saw Massacre director Tobe Hooper), the casting and pre-production, the grueling film shoot, post-production, its release, and eventual cult status. Along the way, viewers are offered interviews with the entire cast (all the way down to ""Paramedic #2"") and many of the behind-the-scenes talent, plus a bevy of photos and footage. The anecdotes aren't especially revelatory (a lot of the stories about the grueling production and O'Bannon's divisive personality can be found in various books and DVDs), but it's still a lot of fun to hear Clu Gulagar, Don Calfa, Thom Mathews, production designer Bill Stout, producer Graham Henderson, and others discuss their experiences making the film.

If I'm being completely honest, the whole thing feels like one big supplemental feature. If there's a solid disappointment here it's that O'Bannon isn't included anywhere in the documentary, except for a few brief moments as the film comes to a close. O'Bannon passed away in 2009 and it's a bit frustrating he doesn't get much of a chance to defend his directing choices, both professional and personal; the cast and crew often complain about how hard he was on everyone and his lack of social graces. Also missing is Mark Venturini (the lead punk rocker) who passed away in 1996 and producer Tom Fox. Their omissions are sorely missed.

More Brains! A Return to the Living Dead is essentially a very black and white experience. Are you a fan of horror films, or more specifically, zombie movies? Do you like hearing people talk endlessly about making a film dealing with the undead? Then I can heartily recommend this. Otherwise, stick with Michael Moore.

More Brains! A Return to the Living Dead is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen. The image quality is serviceable, if unexceptional. The bulk of the documentary includes talking head interviews, old still photographs, some transitional animation and footage from the original Return of the Living Dead film. It probably could have looked better but I don't think it would have mattered--MPE's featured transfer gets the job done. The soundtrack is presented in what appears to be serviceable Dolby 2.0 Stereo (no mention is made on the package). There wasn't a large requirement for this to be a full-on 5.1 surround mix. Also included are English subtitles.

The bonus features are substantial, for the size of the production. The best are two short documentaries, each covering Return of the Living Dead, Part II and Return of the Living Dead 3 that include interviews actors Suzanne Snyder (2), Michael Kenworthy (2), J. Trevor Edmond (3), and director Brian Yuzna (3). There is also a final interview with director Dan O'Bannon (shortly before his death), some deleted scenes from the documentary, a music video by Stacey Q Live! (""Tonight,"" a song from the original film), a look at the shooting locations then and now, a short featurette with the cast saying lines from the movie, and trailers for this film and Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy.

4846201,4,B005NFJAOY,"I had the pleasure of purchasing a copy of More Brains! from Thommy Hutson (producer - His Name Was Jason, Never Sleep Again, Inside Story: Scream etc.) this past weekend at the Rock and Shock convention. As a rather large fan of the franchise, I found myself greatly enjoying the anecdotes and stories shared by all the cast and crew. The few bits from Dan O'Bannon were particularly potent, nearly pulling out a tear or two. This doc more then adequately covers the first three installments of the RotLD series (the only entries that matter) and comes with a nice collection of extended bits and featuretts. Although the bar was set incredibly high with Never Sleep Again (the standard that all docs should be held to), More Brains! is a fine contribution to the new string of franchise documentaries popping up over the last decade as well as a great companion piece to any zombie-lovers collection.",1318809600,9,902,4.788461538461538
4846202,5,B005NFJAOY,"From some of the folks who brought us the Never Sleep Again documentary, which focuses on the Nightmare on Elm Street series, comes ""MORE BRAINS: A Return to the Living Dead"".  I've been anticipating this release since I first read about it in the Horror Hound forum.  I immediately pre-ordered it, and have been waiting patiently ever since.  It came in yesterday's mail, a few days before the official release date, and I have just finished devouring it - from the main documentary feature through every second of the bonus features.  I feel like this is an outstanding endeavor, well worth the time of everyone from casual zombie film fans to the most ardent RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD die-hards.  Almost everyone who had a hand in the original film has a say, and it's the mix of the good, the bad and the ugly that gives the most well-rounded look at this iconic film.  For instance:  SFX man William Munns sure takes a shellacking, but it appears he was in over his head from the start.  William Stout's story about Linnea's tombstone dance had me in stitches.  And I was genuinely moved by Dan O'Bannon's final comments in his interview segment.

If I have any quibbles with the documentary, they're minor.  A ""Play All"" option would have been nice for the deleted scenes.  I can't think of much which could have been added, although knowing that similar series documentaries for Halloween, Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street have been double-disc sets makes me wonder...maybe an interview with vocalist Dinah Cancer of 45 Grave, whose song ""Partytime"" was such an integral part of the film...maybe a gallery of posters and promotional materials...convention footage of the reunited cast members...interviews with Christian Sellers and Gary Smart, who wrote the recent authorative book on the ROTLD series?

In the end, I enjoyed this release immensely.  It came across as a labor of love, and has filled me with nostalgia for the film for the past two days.  I'm ready to watch it again.

PS  Halloween, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street and now RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD have been covered...would the producers of this documentary be willing to undertake an in-depth look at the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series?",1318636800,20,2234,4.852242744063324
4846203,4,B005NFJAOY,"From the people who made the greatest horror documentary ever (Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy)comes another solid feature all about the little zombie film that did, Return of the Living Dead.

Because I write reviews for my own personal site, CAV Distributing sent me this early to watch and critique.

The main documentary, which clocks in at just over 2 hours long, goes over the first film in the series. Just about everyone who was involved in the making of the film, except for Mark Venturini and Dan O'Bannon who had both tragically passed away previously, were involved in the documentary. And just like the Elm Street Legacy, you really get to see the colors of the crew being interviewed. I was honestly howling in laughter during most of Clu Gulager, Don Kalfa, and Miguel Nez's segments.

The main stuff covered was:
- Getting the rights to the name.
- Financing the film.
- Getting the effects to match O'Bannon's vision.
- The changing in crew that they kept doing
- Behind the scenes tension including Jewel Shepard being a priss and Dan O' Bannon being threatened by Clu Gulager
- The entire plot of the movie

 To be honest, I expected this to be great and it was, but for some reason I expected alot more out of it. Its
great for what's there, but if it were just a little bit better, it'd be a definite 10/10 instead of just an 8 on my scale. I definitely recommend that you buy the DVD when it goes on the market in a week. Along with the doc on the first film, there are two half an hour documentaries about parts 2 and 3 as special features, a music video for ""Tonight"" by Stacey Q (the song that played during the infamous graveyard dance scene), a looked at the film's locations nowadays, and the last interview that the late great Dan O'Bannon ever had. It's fun, it's entertaining, and you should have one hell of a time watching it.",1318204800,11,1868,4.4662756598240465
4846204,5,B005NFJAOY,"This is a must have for the zombie fans. ROTLD franchise is a tribute to the romero classics and i'm talking only about the first 3 parts which were released back in the middle-late 80's and were the best parts of the franchise (parts 4 and 5 were very mediorce)
 This doc have everything u need from this series (1-3) as the product description reveals except the making of from part 1.
 Apart from that, this is an excellent release and i still wait for them to release A MORE GENERAL ZOMBIE DOC WHICH WILL BE CALLED ""A Zombie culture"" which i think it's still in the works and it will contain a more comprehensive history of the zombies in the big screen // dvd // video, history.
 Until then enjoy this new great ROTLD release.",1317686400,3,731,4.360294117647059
4846223,4,B005NFJAOY,"I loved seeing all the actors and hearing all their stories about this movie. Love all around. The encoding though sucks. The streaming version of the film goes out of sync with audio @ 29:25 and doesn't come back into sync till 59:18. This is due to a visible 'hiccup' in the encoding. I hope this is fixed so I can give it a 5. If you get the disc I am sure it would be a 5 though, just don't do streaming for now as it's borked.",1452470400,,431,3.909090909090909

Dan O'Bannon, I really like and respect his stuff (mostly).  He was involved in a zombie movie?  Really?  I do like how-they-made-the movie documentaries and I found this one to be really interesting and disagree with the reviews that say it's for die hard fans only.  I'm anything but and I enjoyed this very much.  Maybe I'll even see Return of the Living Dead some day.",1449964800,2,524,4.5212765957446805

Very detailed and loaded with great interviews with most of the original cast and crew.

If you're even bothering to read these reviews just buy this DVD and you'll be a Happy Zombie and no doubt this will only leave you asking for More Brains PLEASE!",1387411200,,587,4.644230769230769
4846258,5,B005NFJAOY,"Here's another treat from Mike Perez (NEVER SLEEP AGAIN & CRYSTAL LAKE MEMORIES). If you own THE RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD on DVD, you might as well make room for this documentary. This covers all the way from when Tobe Hooper (famous for giving us THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 1 & 2, POLTERGEIST, THE MANGLER, THE FUN HOUSE, SALEM'S LOT (1978), EATEN ALIVE, LIFE FORCE, INVADERS FROM MARS (1986) & CROCODILE) was signed on to direct to John Russo's script to Dan O'Bannon writing his script and getting to eventually direct to the movie as we know it today. They also talk a bit about the copyright court case with George A. Romero (NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, DAWN OF THE DEAD, DAY OF THE DEAD, CREEPSHOW, MARTIN, KNIGHT RIDERS, THE CRAZIES, TWO EVIL EYES, MONKEY SHINES, THE DARK HALF, BRUISER, LAND OF THE DEAD, DIARY OF THE DEAD, SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD) against John Russo and Russell Streiner. Another cool story they told was how difficult it was to find the right person to play the role that eventually went to Clu Gulager. One major consideration was Leslie Nielsen who would have been good. The bonus features include THEY WON'T STAY DEAD: MAKING OF RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD PART II, LOVE BEYOND THE GRAVE: MAKING OF RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD PART III and Dan O'Bannon: The Final Interview. I'll leave the rest for you to find out. Here's a list of people who got interviewed:

Thom Mathews

James Karen

Clu Gulager

Don Calfa

Beverly Randolph

Linnea Quigley

Allan Trautman

William Stout

John Russo

Jewel Randolph

Brian Peck

Michael Kenworthy

Suzanne Snyder

4846259,4,B005NFJAOY,"Return of the Living Dead is one of my all time favorite movies. When I saw this DVD on Amazon I had to get it. It has more detail on every facet of the production that most people would even watch, but there is an amazing clip/story in the extra features. It's an interview with the art director. The guy who designed the zombies, sets, etc. Believe me, you will probably never hear such a messed up story like he tells you about the funeral homes he visited during the production. After watching him tell the story you might consider ever having your body go to a funeral home, especially if you're a female! I'm not kidding.",1361491200,,627,4.367521367521367

I think that if you're a true fan of the movies (at least the first one, which is kind of the only one worth watching, really) then you should be willing to buy this DVD. It's really long and although they don't go into the newer, horrible Return of the Living Dead movies (who cares!), they still get really in depth about the ones that matter to everyone.

ROTLD is a very unique film and unfortunately they never made a real sequel of this great movie. I downloaded this from the internet and watched twice but right now is even in You Tube for anybody to watch.

4846267,3,B005NFJAOY,"If you are not a fan of Return of the Living Dead, then this DVD probably will not interest you, as it is a documentary or more a very late featurette of Return of the Living Dead. The feature is roughly just over an hour long and contains interviews with most of the cast and crew of the original film. Unfortunately some of those actors are no longer with us. The interviews are what you expect, how they got their parts, what they did for the role, what they thought about the film, crew and other cast members etc.. and tell their little tales of their adventures through the month of shooting the film, and what they think of it today.

It also contains around 40 minutes each of the same thing talking about ROTLD parts 2 and 3. It seemed very shameful that when they talk about part II, they don't speak too highly of it, but to so many of us, it's a great film... but what is a joke is when they talk about part 3 and praise themselves for coming up with such a supposedly great idea (yeah, right?)

Also in the bonus section is an interview with the now deceased producer, as well as a horrible video clip by whoever did that song for the movie, and a few useless other things thrown in.

The trailer for this movie advertises that it contains 1000's of pictures and behind the scenes footage.. it doesn't have much of that at all, they look more like shots from the movie or promo photos, there is not a lot of it, and it's within the main feature.

Why I am a little disappointed is, it should have contained deleted scenes and maybe some outtakes that fans of these films would really love to see. I know I would. If the ""His Name was Jason"" (Friday the 13th) and the ""Return to Elm St"" (Freddy) got deleted scenes, then why didn't this movie? As some have been circulating online for years. Had this have come with the original film as a bonus disc, I would give it more credit, but for this, the best value I got out of it was seeing what the actors look like now, and a few stories from behind the scenes, but that's about it. I wouldn't say it's something I have plans to watch again and again, over and over. I might watch it once more in a few years, and that will be about it.",1330214400,,2195,4.194312796208531

4846272,5,B005NFJAOY,"Return of the Living Dead is a film I truly love. I must have seen it for the first time when I was about ten years old, and it scared the living piss out of me. I've seen it since countless times. It is now comfort food to me. If I am sick and have the flu and want to watch something extremely comforting, ROTLD is a film which fits the bill. In my teens I became a punk myself and I think this film managed to catch something essential about punk. It is one of the best punk movies out there, really. The soundtrack is really great. It turned me onto Rocky Erikson AND The Cramps. The zombies are totally unique, even today, in that they eats brains and they are smart. Trioxin 3-4-5 -- made to ""spray on marijuana"" -- and the drums containing the military gas, are now totally iconic. The film is very dynamic visually and it is action packed and never drags. The art direction and the cinematography and the effects are terrific. It is a great preCGI effects showcase. Perhaps what I love most about the film are the perfomances of Karen, Gulagar, Calfa, and Mathews. There are outstanding character actors in this film and they take it to 11! Plus, the satire is great. And did I mention the nudity. Man, before internet porn this movie was like a goldmine for an adolescent: full frontal nudity, a striptease on a tomb, butt shots, breasts, and then hot zombie nudity. I wore out my pause button. The movie is an artistic pinacle of the horror-comedy genre. I just watched it again the other night with my girlfriend while partaking of a bottle of red wine and some herb and we had such a friggin' great time! This film in all honesty probably ties with the original Dawn of the Dead as the greatest zombie movie of all time, but ROFLD is certainly more of a party movie, is like the more rock n' roll, punk cousin of DOFD. ALL THAT BEING SAID, More Brains is the perfect documentary for anyone who loves ROTLD. It is a gift to the fans. I've seen ROFTD so many times but, since most of these viewings took place well before featurettes and commentary tracks, I never had any idea what went on behind the camera or what the artists experienced. This doc just opens up a whole new world and it is great to see so many people who worked on the film talk about their times, both good and bad. It is tragic that some folks have passed on -- Dan O'Bannon and Mark Venturini -- but this film honors them well. I am glad that for most folks this film has had a positive effect on their lives. ROFLD is a personal favorite and if you also think that ROTLD rocks then gets this documentary now! The folks who made this doc obviously had fun making this tribute, and you'll have fun watching it. Cheers to the cast and crew of ROTLD! Remember: If you want to party. It's party time!",1321228800,,2779,4.295238095238095

8480414,5,B005NFJAOY,"A nicely done documentary looking back on the movie, ""The Return of the Living Dead"". It reveals little-known facts about the making of the film and it was a real treat to see the ""behind-the-scenes"" work. It was also bittersweet to see Dan O'Bannon's final interview. For those who are fans of this other other movies like it, it's worth a look!",1501459200,,346,4.596774193548387

8480419,5,B005NFJAOY,"I miss these kind of movies. As a kid growing up during the hack & slash heydays, a documentary like this just takes me back to a time when movies were more fun than today. Wach this film and remember when movies were put together without all the computer help. And if you've never seen the actual movie, wach that too. If it doesn't bring a smile to your face then I give up.",1461628800,2,376,4.094594594594595
