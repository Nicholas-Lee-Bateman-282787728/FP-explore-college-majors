2875746,2,B000RW5CCC,"Disappointing coming of age drama about a gay teenager coming out to his family, friends and himself.  (Hampus Bjrck) does a good job as the rebellious title character, effectively portraying the confusion and angst most teenagers experience as they make the transition from child to adult.  The main problem with the movie is that Sebastian just isn't very likable.  I'm not sure if his parents are supposed to be his enemies or simply buffoons.  In any case I found them much more interesting and sympathetic than their son.

There are lots of coming of age movies out there, maybe too many.  The territory has been covered already, and this one doesn't have anything new to say.  Too bad.",1324252800,3,691,4.805084745762712
2875747,3,B000RW5CCC,"I'm all for the novelty of gay cinema and the confusing awakening of a young man's sexuality. This was movie was fun and lighthearted mostly. Sebastian is a treat for the eyes, and Ulf is no slouch either. While I appreciate the sentiment the movie was going for with Sebastian's disorientation with his feelings toward Ulf unfolding the way they were, his antics seemed a bit contrived to me. He seems to have an inexplicable anger in his eyes at times. I'm not sure whether the anger is meant to be directed at his parents, at himself for feeling the way he does, or towards Ulf for being romantically unavailable.

That said, the movie is entertaining and it's a worthy way of passing the time. I would just caution that this falls just short of thought-provoking or mesmerizing, which is why I'm unable to give it four stars as have other reviewers. For me, I enjoy gay themes in movies and I would gladly sit through most such films. If you are like me, and are habituated to enjoying a pleasant movie with gay content, then I think you will enjoy this. If you are like me and also are a bit of a snoot when it comes to cinematic craftmanship, you won't be missing anything if you decide to hold onto your dollars for something more refined.",1307491200,,1246,4.464912280701754
2875748,4,B000RW5CCC,"Sebastian is a movie I am conflicted about.  There are a lot of things to like about this movie:  Cinematography, Lighting, Acting, Sexiness, Directing.  It was a movie made with love and you can feel it, the only problem is that it is a movie that packs the punch of an ""After School Special"".  For all of the good things things this movie has going for it, it just doesn't have any source of major conflict.  The thing that saves this movie are the things I listed above and the acting (and good looks) of the actor that plays Sebastian.  He does what most people cannot, he actually holds a movie together for 90 min. mostly by himself.  Not a common achievement by any means.

This is a ""coming of age"" movie about a 13 year old gay teenager, although the actor that plays Sebastian is, I would guess about 20.  But I won't begrudge the filmmakers that common mistake.  If your 13 and watching this movie, you don't want to see yourself as a real 13 year old, you want to see yourself as being older and sexier.  Who could blame them?  I want to be beefier and better looking also.  I don't go to the movies to see reality, I see and am reminded of reality all of the time.  I go to the movies for fantasy.  How I want the world to be, not how it is.

Sebastian like so many people is gay, not bi-sexual and not heterosexual.  He knows he is gay.  His friends know he is gay.  His parents know he is gay.  Everyone around him ""knows"" that he is gay.  The only source of tension in this movie is that he has not confirmed that he is gay for anyone around him.  He is 13.  Who amongst us understands the world and themselves enough at 13 to make proclamations?  Not everyone is self-aware enough to shout their sexual orientation from the rooftops when they are 5 - 13 years old.  It would be one thing he was unsure of his sexual orientation, or if he like both men and women and ""felt"" he had to make a choice.  But that is not this movie.  The filmmakers only source of tension in this movie is ""when"" he will tell the world he is gay.

Sebastian, his friends and his family do not have a problem with him being gay which is one of the main problems of the movie.  If there is no conflict, there isn't much of a story to tell.  The major conflicts of the story is ""when"" Sebastian will tell everyone he is gay and will he get the boy he desires or has a crush on in the end, (no pun intended).

There is no overt sex in this movie, unless you consider men with their shirts off sexual.  But the guys in this movie... they sure look good in a semi state of undress.  Some people look better without their clothes than with their clothes.  All the men in this move fit into the former category.  Even Sebastian's Dad, who may no longer be a poster boy for Playgirl, but looks damn fine in the one scene where we see him with his shirt off.

For all it's flaws, it is forgiven.  It is absolved.  It is not the greatest movie ever made, but the director knew how to make the movie and for the most part it works.

If cute guys, good acting for the most part and great visuals are your thing, then this is your movie.  If you don't expect too much beyond that, you won't be disappointed.

But I have too say, for some odd reason, it is one of my favorite gay movies out there.  Would I suggest it to a friend?  Probably not, maybe, but only with caution given.",1307318400,,3360,4.136222910216718
2875749,4,B000RW5CCC,"Sebastian is a 16 year old guy going through some tough times of thought. He spends his time alone in his room just thinking about life and what it all means. He is rather distant from his friends and from his parents, all of whom just want him to open up and be himself. He on the other hand just doesn't quite have enough confidence in their love to feel they can be trusted with the truth that is in his head alone. One day something happens that brings light and a moment of satisfaction to Sebastian and he steals a kiss from his best friend Ulf, who doesn't quite respond the way Sebastian hoped he would. All in all however it opens the door to trust and he finds the strength in himself to reveal his deepest thoughts and fear to his family and friends. As he allows those closest in his life to see who and what he really is, Sebastian also begins to see for the first time what love and friendship is all about, and that he is not as alone as he thought.
I liked this film. It centers around a Norweigan town and some of the scenery makes a nice backdrop for the film. English subtitles that are for the most part easy to follow. There are a few scenes that are not well lighted and could have been filmed a little better, but all in all a pretty good production and fun to watch. The acting is very good for most of the characters. This is a good film about self discovery and coming of age. It's light hearted and written in a way that you can feel the characters and the struggles they face in life. I recommend it to anyone who likes to watch coming of age films and can relate to the struggles of a teenaged boy trying to find himself and deal with his feelings of attraction for other boys.",1304899200,16,1706,4.157099697885196
2875750,4,B000RW5CCC,"I guess I am the second person to review this movie, I have not read the other review, but I will rate this movie just bit higher than the other person.

This is a picture in the series of foreign films that deals with coming out of age as a gay teenager. Whether the movie is French, German, British, Irish, etc. it basically presents the pain and struggle of being gay. I have never seen a Norwegian movie before, but I find these types of films fascinating as not only does the movie shows the gay theme, but a tidbit of the society or culture. Being someone interested in different societies and having a degree in that field, I learned a lot about Norway by just watching this picture.

Sebastian is the main character, a member of among 5 kids living in a small town somewhere in Norway. Sebastian is beginning to realize that something is different. He is in love with his best friend, Ulf, a straight boy who dates one of the girls in that group of 5. There is one more girl, Lisbeth, Sebastian's ex-girl friend. There is one more boy, Janne.

Sebastian is a spunky kid, beautiful boy, with a saintly smile. He has long hair, neck length. He is very athletic, beefed up, just like Ulf. Ulf, the more masculine, shows that Viking look, the rough exterior. Both boys horse around a lot.

The parents of Sebastian are educated and well to do. Ulf comes from an impoverished home, with two sisters. He helps his mom with the chores and babysitting. There is an enormous contrast between both boys socially.

One very important point to bring out is the relationship between Sebastian and his mother. It is feisty and intelligent, the conversations are in a very authoritarian tone by both, but not disrespectful. The father takes a back role, but not totally gone. They both find out about Sebastian, but their reactions are mixed, pain and laughter. One of these parents must be a psychiatrist.

One night, Ulf comes over to Sebastian's home. They both have fun, making waffles and a total mess in the kitchen, they drink champagne getting drunk, listen to music and dancing, they both tried mascara to look feminine (which I found interesting), and they both have a bath together in a jacuzzi looking tub (again interesting but nothing happening) literally flooding the bathroom, and finally the night is over, Ulf is ready to go, Sebastian pleads with Ulf to stay over, Ulf declines, and Sebastian impulsively kisses Ulf.

The rest of the movie is pretty much Sebastian coming out, and his friends accepting him, including Ulf.

Sebastian is a sweet movie. Hampus Bjork as Sebastian is an extremely cute boy, with that radiant smile, and cute long hair. Nicolai Cleve Broch as Ulf is also handsome in a more rougher exterior. Because I am the second person to review this movie, it shows that there is not a whole a lot of interest. But if you are reading this, it is a nice movie.",1204761600,23,2888,4.6050583657587545

The movie left no doubt as to the strong bond they had for each other and the suggestion, by Uli, that they should take a trip next year when he is financially able plus his reaction( (Uli) when Sebastian willing to accept him as a friend rather than something more intimate) on his face, clearly showed his feelings for Seb.

2875767,1,B000RW5CCC,"It's a pity this production focuses more effort is on hair and makeup for the two quite attractive young males than it does on telling anything resembling a coherent story.  While narrative is generally a mess throughout, Sebastian's interchanges with his mother are especially nonsensical--or at least the subtitles make it seem so.  Can the original Norwegian dialogue possibly be this braindead?

2875773,3,B000RW5CCC,"Strange, but artistic coming of age movie about a young man and his relationships with his small group of friends and parents.  As the only son, his mother and father treasures him.  They want Sebastian to be a successful young man to one day marry and have children like all other young men they know.  Sebastian, however, is innocent at an age in which he is trying to understand the difference between friendship and a sexual relationship.  He has a female friend who he is fond of, but he also has a best friend who is an attractive guy.  He doesn't quite understand how he feels or what he feels.  He wants to be close to both of them, but also doesn't know how they would perceive him.  There is a fine line that he doesn't know if he should cross or stay safe as he always have been.  This is the last summer for them together before they go on different paths, so Sebastian must decide how far he wants to go in his exploration, and how will his parents perceive him based on his decisions and behaviors.

Compound all of that with struggling with homosexual feelings with no mentors and the horrible lies about being gay, a young man's life can become to much.  What starts with a kiss with his best friend opens Sebastian's mind to reality that he can accept.  He slowly let's out his feelings.  Will his parents still accept him or tell him to leave?  Will his friends want him around anymore?  The movie captures well the feelings of coming out.  Well worth watching.",1414195200,,621,4.7924528301886795

The parents are also interesting characters who naturally have to adjust emotionally to having a gay son, but they do that very well and show that they love and support their son no matter what.  The focus in this version of the story is how the gay teen dances around the issue, denying it to himself and others, while also taking baby steps towards accepting himself.  One wants to shake the kid and say, ""just come out--you'll be ok.""
