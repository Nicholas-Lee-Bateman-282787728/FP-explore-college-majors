I noted that Anna May Wong only got a short mentioned in this documentary probably because her life story had
been already pretty well covered by other documentaries.

The bonus disk features were not as well organized as it should have been. It looked mostly like left over reference
material used in putting together the first disk.

The discovery and partial restoration of the early Chinese-American made silent movie
looked like a ""work in progress.""",1406678400,3,568,5.163043478260869
8652273,4,B00JLWHX4O,"With Arthur Dong's books and documentaries, the lives of Chinese performers are being revealed. At the Forbidden City and other ""Chinese-Themed"" nightclubs of the time there were also Japanese performers, who pretended they were Chinese because of the anti-Japanese feelings during world war II (""Jack Suzuki"" became ""Jack Soo."") Other than Anna May Wong, few Asians were working in films - the subject of this excellent documentary. Hearing Nancy Kwan talk about her eventual career is fascinating. She tells the story with heart and humor. Hopefully, one day a TV series like ""Boardwalk Empire"" might be produced that can combine history,drama and song-and-dance and give focus to our Asian American population. Highly recommended!",1403568000,7,733,5.495575221238938
