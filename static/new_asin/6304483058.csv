7872628,4,6304483058,"I would assume this film was inspired by Kurasawa's Rashomon, as it is about a killing & there are several versions of how it happened. In this case the battles were less heroic, as were the characters (rather ordinary semi riffraffy Americans).  Some good actors & some who were not - I liked some of the characters.  The killing was fueled by rivalry over a woman & her pain seemed real.  The music of Johnny Cash gives this film a longer shelf life (can't miss with J.C.).",1129593600,,475,4.436781609195402
7872629,2,6304483058,"The movie kicks off brilliantly, but doesn't build upto anything, making the ending, a bit of a disappointment. The only possible things that could keep the viewer interested are the rather `natural' feel of the movie, and its brilliant music.
The direction is good; infact, it seems quite amateurish. Deliberately done or not, this amateurish look of the movie, can be said as a bit of a saving grace and gives an `edge' to the otherwise horrible movie. But, the story line is so weak, that even the best of direction cannot save the movie from sinking. Though the movie tries to conjure up'suspense' so that the viewer could look forward to at least something towards the end of the movie, sadly however, even before the `suspense' begins, it is quite easy to figure it out, what it is going to be. If this is the case, then there is not much to look forward to, in the movie.

The bottom line: the movie has bad acting, good direction by a helpless director, and on top of it all, a really bad story line. However, the music and the timing of music is fantastic, one of the best, ever. One more thing: the `car' is beautiful.",1058745600,,1128,4.475728155339806
