Like its sequel, Afro Samuri Ressurection, this film is funny, engaging, and filled with great fight scenes.",1363478400,2,295,4.784313725490196

2711315,4,B000LP5FWM,"Afro Samurai is the story of a man who is out to avenge the death of his father. In order to do this he must find Justice(the current number 1) and must also retain possession of the number 2 headband. The story of the headbands is that the number 1 can only be challenged by the number 2, but the number 2 can be challenged by anybody. Afro is accompanied by Ninja Ninja who serves as the comedic relief for the show. Along the way Afro runs into many problems such as a man with a crossbow/grenade launcher, a dream reader who works for the empty seven, a robotic clone of himself using data the dream reader stole from him, an old friend named Kuma , and of course Justice. The villains are pretty bizarre in this show. Kuma is dressed as a giant teddy bear and Justice is a mutated cowboy/samurai trying to become a god. The music in this series is awesome and the animation is just as good. The animation has a lot of dark colors with a big hint of red from all of the blood spilled in the series. This series is good but it also has its weaknesses. Justice is awesome but for being the main villain he is under used. As a matter of fact Justice is in the show about as much as Afro drinking lemonade is. Another weak point is the final battle between Justice and Afro which only gets about ten minutes of screen time. This may not be the best anime ever made but it definitely deserves to be watched.",1232928000,,1406,4.191881918819188
2711316,3,B000LP5FWM,"Good to look at, but cliche.....isn't that what most anime is nowadays?  I really don't understand why this stigma has to be attached to EVERY black character in anime.....the hip-hop thumping, blunt-smoking, brooding ladies man.  Sure, it sounds nice, but isn't there alot more to our character? Frankly, it's wearing thin, and I see racism growing because of it, People seem to be forgetting all the contributions we have made!",1190592000,4,429,5.114285714285714
2711317,3,B000LP5FWM,"The rating I give isn't for the show in particular, but for the DVD and how little was put into it.  I purchased the Director's Cut, but it didn't really add much to the mix and wasn't worth the extra $7.  I got 15 minutes of never before seen footage that was irrelevant at best and a plastic sleeve for the extra dough.  Also, there were no subtitles.  So if you have trouble understanding what's being said, tough luck.  The ""special features"" are on a seperate disc and I can't figure out how 5 chapters (See: Episodes) and a weak bonus disc adds up to nearly $30.

With all that being said, if you like the show, then go ahead and get the regular version.  The show has a good storyline and the voices and music do capture the true anime feel despite Ninja Ninja's offensive demeanor.  As I mentioned already, if you're on the fence about getting the director's cut or the regular version, go with the regular and save yourself some cheese.  This is a 4 star show that got a 1 star treatment.",1183939200,2,997,4.317204301075269
2711318,4,B000LP5FWM,"I watched every episode of Afro on its spike tv debuit.  This anime had it all. Great story lines. I was suprised how tasty the animation was.  I was expecting big things form this anime and boy did it deliver.  The only reason I can not give 5 stars is simply because of the length of this anime.  The entire series only lasted six or seven episodes, whats that all about?  A tease in the worst of ways.  I guess this series was too big for its own britches.  Sammy is a buisy man but its only voice work.  The brotherhood demands more episodes of Afro!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1173744000,3,572,4.330188679245283

8162721,3,B000LP5FWM,"Taking place in a futuristic feudal Japan with a post apocalyptic backdrop. Ronin are free to roam in a lawless world leaving behind them trails of blood and death; but there is a reason behind these rogue samurai actions. There are two headbands floating around: the Number One and Number Two headbands. Whomever wears the Number One will achieve a God-like status with the power to rule the world. In addition, he can only be challenged by the Number Two. The wearer of the Number Two on the other hand can be challenged by anyone.

As a young boy, Afro witnessed his father killed by a man named Justice for the Number One in a duel. Justice leaves looking forward to one day meeting Afro in battle. Years later, Afro now wears the Number Two in pursuit of Justice. While on his quest for revenge, every rogue samurai to include a clan called The Empty Seven are after Afro's life. -summary

If I never had a reason to accuse an anime of being all beauty and no brain. Then I would definitely have one now, because Afro Samurai fits the term ""style over substance"" like no other. It makes sure to cater only to a specific audience, which are the action and eye candy crowd. Studio Gonzo has been known to deliver when it comes down to visuals. Series such as Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo and Basilisk more than back up this claim. Afro Samurai continues to carry their legacy.

The artwork and animation are top notch without a doubt. The battle scenes are fast paced, very fluid, and detailed. It is amazing watching bullets chopped in mid flight only to scatter and kill people by the dozens. Plus the animation is completely free of stills with very little reused cels. The choreography is among the best I have seen in a samurai related anime with fights even surpassing that of Ninja Scroll, while completely crushing the completely horrid Samurai Deeper Kyo. Anyone whom says the animation in Afro Samurai is lacking either didn't see it, or they're searching for reasons to hate it; which really is uncalled for because it has more than enough dragging it down. The artwork is splendid with some great character designs and very nice settings with a very well use of color and schemes.

The soundtrack is very good as well. East Coast hip hop artist RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan is behind the soundtrack. The beats are everything you would expect from him, and they capture the gritty feel plus the rhythm of the series. When I first saw Afro Samurai and Samurai Champloo, I didn't care for hip hop in a samurai setting. I guess it had a lot to do with the traditionalist in me; but I'll admit that it does work here. Even though I'm still not completely a fan of it. In fact I'm not a fan of it at all.

The voice work is done by Samuel L. Jackson(Afro Samurai, Ninja Ninja), Ron Perlman(Justice), and Kelly Hu(Okiku). The voice work is average, but a majority of the time you will hear from the ultra irritating comic relief Ninja Ninja, and he never ever shuts up. The other two voice actors are barely heard from due to their short roles.

Afro Samurai also has an interesting world simply because the imagination definitely ran wild. These aren't exactly your traditional samurai and monks. The characters are equipped with a vast arsenal of weaponry and cybernetics that combines genres old and new, such as a monk using a cell phone along with ronin packing a crossbow/grenade launcher.

Now for the bad features of the series, this is the part that is completely a matter of taste. The writers focused so much on the eye candy and blood lust audience, that they completely forsake the character and plot driven crowd. All of the characters are incredibly bland, and almost no one is really likeable. Afro is not really developed, his sidekick Ninja Ninja is the opposite of Afro's quiet personality, in which he's very out spoken, loud, and upbeat. It is said, that he's actually Afro's character development. I just don't see that because Afro simply doesn't change for better or worse. He is one of the most static characters I can think of. This doesn't necessarily make him a bad character, just not a very interesting one and easily forgettable. The rest of the characters are merely meant to push the thin plot and nothing else.

Afro Samurai is a very violent series with lots of blood, death, and severed limbs. Followed with lots of profanity that Samuel L. Jackson has been known for. There is also a bit of fan service and an almost non graphic sex scene.

The series is five episodes with a 125 minute run time. This series is not for everyone and I haven't re-watched in years. Those whom love lots of bloody and gory action shades of Ninja Scroll will more than likely be entertained. Fans of Sam Jackson and RZA's production should give it a shot as well. The DVD set also comes with a second disk containing commentary, interviews with the voice actors, producers, and behind the scenes.

Pros: Very high production values, good blend of different genres

Cons: Paper thin plot, bland characters, weak ending",1427587200,,5046,4.626815642458101
