8059170,4,B0009DT4H8,"Unusual but enjoyable film contrasts Australia's open sunny spaces with Belgium's overcast skies and enclosed surroundings, doing the same with the personalities of the participants. Not an adventure nor action item, is all about European sensibilities. Maybe that's why never released in Australia itself??? Aussie scenes at historic Terowie use English speech, from there it's subtitled. Jeremy Irons uses attractive accents in both languages. If you like art-house, go for it!",1128297600,,479,5.76056338028169
