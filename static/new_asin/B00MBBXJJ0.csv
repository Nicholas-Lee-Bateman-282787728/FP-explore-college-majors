8671368,4,B00MBBXJJ0,"Take a good look at Bilkis ""Bobby"" Ahmed (Vidya Balan), an unusual woman who haunts the streets of Old Hyderabad in inappropriate hours. Bobby is the oldest daughter and the bane of her father's existence. They're feuding hard. He's had it with her wild idiosyncracies, with her stubborn streak of independence and her unwillingness to conform. A spinster already in her 30s, her prospects for a good marriage are only dwindling. Bobby doesn't give a what. She aspires to be a jasoos, that is, a private eye. She's aware of the challenges. She meets them head-on. And since the local leading detective agency won't hire her, ef 'em, she'll hang her own shingle, open her own firm right across that detective agency. But, ah, with what money? She's done some sleuthing, but it's the petty stuff, comprised in part of shadowing those folks suspected of having an affair.

Her corner of bustling Old Hyderabad is the suburb of Moghulpura, a sprawling neighborhood that boasts 40,000 denizens. It's her intimate knowledge of its nooks and crannies that lands her her first big case. The mysterious Anees Khan (Kiran Kumar) offers her a boatload of rupees for finding a missing girl. The meager clues she's provided with are the girl's name and age and a description of her birthmark. Good luck with that, Bobby.

3, maybe 3.5,  out of 5 stars for BOBBY JASOOS, a fun but flawed Indian comedy mystery that came out in 2014. I appreciate it when actors throw themselves into their roles. Vidya Balan has been prominent on the landscape of Hindi cinema for a while now, and she's yet to underperform. As ""Bobby"" she's incredibly energetic and at her irrepressible best. Obviously, she's the best thing about this movie. I admire that she's not afraid to look frumpy.

The opening song boasts that Bobby is ""like the aunt of Sherlock Holmes"" and ""the aunt of James Bond."" And maybe that was overpromising things. Bobby loves to dive into her silly disguises, and credit her for being resourceful and creative enough. I like that the movie does give the gumshoe's craft its due. We're reminded that detection does really consist of 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration. For all her clever ideas, Bobby still has to do her due diligence, and this means hours and hours spent pounding the pavement and running into dead ends. At one point, Bobby is so at her wits' end trying to find the girl, she resorts to randomly calling the girl's name out in public. Heh.

I like this movie enough to recommend it, never mind that the writing loses steam somewhere after the halfway mark and that the mystery aspect doesn't deliver enough of a payoff. The songs are underwhelming. The humor hits and misses. The hang-wringing family melodrama is typically excessive. And there are plot holes, the most gaping of which is why does Khan draw a gun when he finally tracks down his last missing person, given the later revelation? On a more minor note, I don't buy that Bobby is strong enough to repeatedly dunk a suspect's head into a water trough as she tried to wring out information from him.

So why do I like this movie? Because I like it when Vidya Balan does her thing. She's not afraid of taking risks, of lampooning herself. Here, she's more breezy than powerhouse. But I enjoyed the madcap moments. My favorite bits in this movie are those in which Bobby and one of her clients, handsome local celebrity Tasawur Shaikh (Ali Fazal), are sharing the screen. Tasawur is the constant burr under Bobby's saddle. He's all the time on her to ruin his parents' constant attempt to arrange his wedding. Guy's already spurned 34 marriage proposals. An annoyed Bobby urges him to stand up to his strict father and tell him doesn't want to get married. Except Tasawur prefers to have Bobby keep digging up dirt on his prospective fiances. Their acerbic interplay kept me entertained even as I waited for their relationship to take a turn. Ali Fazal nails his role really well.

I also liked the extended sequence in which it's demonstrated that you CAN have too much biryani. The biryani looked sumptuous, but, after a while, my stomach was aching in sympathy.",1488067200,,4130,4.767832167832168

8671376,5,B00MBBXJJ0,"This movie is just fun. There's some action. There's a little romance. There's mystery and many disguises.

There are only 3 songs unlike the typical Bollywood movie. So if you want a lot of music, this isn't it.

Bobby is really Bilkis, a Muslim girl who wants to be a detective. She gets small cases, like a mom who wants to know if her son is smoking. Then Aneez Khan shows up and wants her to find a girl, with just a  first name, age, and birthmark. Bobby is helped out in solving her cases by a waiter, her assistant, the sound guy, and Tassawur, who is on TV, and the only one who speaks English. Aneez continues to give her work. Meanwhile Lala, a local goon, wants her to keep helping him. Tassawur also wants her help so he won't have to get married.

Bobby's Dad is NOT thrilled with this occupation and spends most of the movie refusing to talk to her. However, he's a decent guy. Bobby isn't required to wear a hijab. He doesn't do an honor killing when he sees her coming out of a hotel with Tassawur. Bobby plays a fortune teller at one point and tells him that his daughter will make him proud. Watch how the relationship gets repaired.

Even the males of the household liked this one.",1414800000,,1201,4.29646017699115
