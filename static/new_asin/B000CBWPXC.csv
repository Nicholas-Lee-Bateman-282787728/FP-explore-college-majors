2455299,5,B000CBWPXC,"Back in May of 2005 I took a tour with about 50 other devotes of the Klipsch (speakers) headquarters in Indianapolis, IN. There were only a few copies of Animusic 2 in existence at that time and we used parts of the copy at hand to demo and test Kipsch's offerings (even the mighty Kipschorns and the not-yet-in-production LaScala II's).

Our main sample was of Starship Groove and impressed up enough for being played on stereo systems strange to us. At this writing my copies are on order and being shipped. To play it on a home system I'm totally familiar with just brings out a giddy-ness Christmas feeling (all charged up with excitement). Should be here in a few days.",1132099200,11,674,4.570247933884297
2455300,5,B000CBWPXC,"Animusic 2, like its predecessor ""Animusic"", contains computer rendered animations that are set to music - in fact, the essence of the animations is that they are driven by the music, each musical note being connected with some action in the animation.  While this fact may be of more interest to people concerned with the ""how"" rather than simply the experience provided by the final product, I think that understanding the process that goes into Animusic is part of the fun.  If Rube Goldberg conducted an orchestra in cyberspace, it might look like some of the animations in Animusic 2.

I enjoyed the first Animusic tremendously, and this DVD presents more of the same.  While there are a few aspects in which Animusic 2 differs from its predecessor, the similarities outweigh the differences and the overall experience is remarkably similar.

This album is similar musically to the original.  It features a  range of styles, and relies mostly upon struck or plucked strings and melodic percussion (such as xylophones / marimbas) to carry most of the tunes.  Drums and synthesizers also feature heavily.

The music is interesting enough when played with the animation, but does not stand alone simply as music as well as the first album did.  Still, the tunes are catchy and enjoyable, and you will find yourself tapping your toes and bouncing your head as you watch / listen.

The animation is detail intensive and exceptionally well rendered.  The instrument models and sets are clever and interesting to watch.  On the whole, even if the experience is essentially another iteration of the original Animusic concept, this is not at all a bad thing.

There are some differences, and they are generally for the better.  For example, the instruments/players show more ""personality"" than in the previous outing, swinging their arms or bouncing to the beat even when they aren't actually playing.  And the special features are more varied than they were previously.  But these differences are evolutionary, rather than dramatic.

On the whole, this is a great example of musical animation and is lots of fun to watch (I watched it 3 times through the first time I put it in the player).  Although I may enjoy the original slightly more, this is a worthwhile experience for anyone who enjoyed the original, or has an interest in animation.  I have no doubt I will watch this many, many times.

Product details:

There are 8 animations on Animusic 2, and while most make use of instruments that are different from those seen in the first album, the overall style is similar.  Included are some acoustic pieces that feature organic sounding (albeit fanciful looking) instruments, such as ""Resonant Chamber"" and ""Pipe Dream 2"", as well as pieces that make extensive use of synthesized sounds, such as ""Heavy Light"" and ""Fiber Bundles"".  Also included is a drum solo, ""Gyro Drums"".

The special features include commentary by the director, as well as design stills, set build-ups, and some interesting multi-angle presentations of the animations.  The disc includes both 5.1 and 2.0 surround audio mixes, as well as full-screen (4:3) and widescreen presentations of the animations, so this disc can be fully appreciated on a wide variety of systems, whether you have a standard stereo television or a home-theatre with all the bells and whistles.",1132099200,147,3342,5.019963702359346

Our 18 month old grandbaby girl loves it too.,1389830400,,384,3.753086419753086

2455352,5,B000CBWPXC,"As with the first Animusic, this video is excellent. It is engaging to kids and adults alike.

2455359,5,B000CBWPXC,"My brother gave me Animusic 1 about 3 months ago and enjoyed it so much that I bought Animusic 2. Both are very creative, not just the video which you have to watch a few times to see all the different instruments playing themselves but I think the music is very well done. Even the camera angles, movement and lighting are excellent. You have the option of listening in stereo or surround sound. This guy (Wayne Lytle) is very talented.

2455400,5,B000CBWPXC,"Wayne Lytle and his team present another great portfolio of music animations - the kind of thing you might get if Pixar animated Rube Goldberg doing Fantasia. These 8 pieces cover a wide range of looks and sounds, from the classic visual and artistic styles of Resonant Chamber to the massive, brooding temple of Heavy Light, to Fiber Bundles' organic imagery. Although parts of Animusic 1 reappear here, these scenes not only do well in themselves, they go well beyond the complexity of that earlier set.

Except for a piece from Mussorgsky's ""Pictures at an Exhibition,"" these all present Lytle's own musical compositions. Although they vary, many show influences from Emerson, Lake, and Palmer and other music from that era. Lytle updates the sound, though, suffusing each piece with a happy energy. That cheerful tone comes through especially in Fiber Bundles - its bio-inspired geometries remind me of H.R. Giger, but with a bouncy charm wholly opposite Giger's brooding nightmares.

Extras on this disk help stretch out the animations' relatively short playing time. I found the director's commentary informative and enjoyable, the ""multi-view"" renderings less so. Wide-screen aficionados will be happy to see every piece done in their format as well as full-screen - redone, really, so that each version work properly as a visual composition. These enjoyable shorts have a place in any collection of animations or computer graphics, but I'm sure they'll appeal to far wider audiences than just those.

If you play it in big screen (LCD 40"" or more) with 720p or better, the DVD looks pixelated.  Not good quality.  Just 853 X 480 pixels!  -Even the demo they let you download for free at their website has better image quality than the DVD.  I got the demo and was very expectant that the DVD had a better quality but it dissapointed me.  They should release a blue-ray version or something.  I love all the extras they included, including both full screen and wide screen versions, angles and lots of material of the production process which is fascinating.

It is visually beautiful on a widescreen TV, and the graphics are much more detailed and interesting than in ""Animusic"". I do recommend both, however.

The amazingly cool technology feat behind this production is that it's not simply ""animation"" done to to music like you would see in productions like Fantasia. All of the ""performing objects"" in each scene are separately tied to MIDI controls, so the objects actually appear to ""perform"" exactly what notes they are playing.

2455432,3,B000CBWPXC,"Like other reviewers, I enjoyed Animusic 1 so much that Animusic 2 was a bit of a disappointment. I think perhaps the biggest aspect is that many of the instruments, or the objects playing them, are humanoid figures with human-like robotic movements. The most glaring example of this is Gyro Drums, which literally has robotic arms with drumsticks spinning around playing drums. What's the point? I might as well watch a real person playing them. What made Animusic 1 great was having unique, non-human machines play this music. Ironically, many of Animusic 2's instruments are... dare I say it? Too realistic.

In that regard, I enjoyed Pipe Dream 2 because it not only followed the original concept, but showed that even a familiar scene could be redone with new music and lighting to create something interesting. Fiber Bundles was OK -- neat to watch, at least -- and I enjoyed Resonant Chamber and Cathedral Pictures. One thing about Resonant Chamber: the strings attached to the large curved arm, going right through the center of the assemblage, is never played!

The graphics are all first rate, the director's comments illuminating, and one can see that a lot of work (and work ethic) went into producing this DVD. It seems no effort was short changed, no corner cut.

This isn't like a movie where you might not watch it again for months or even years.  I go back to this when I need my spirits lifted or just to get my mind off the drudgery.

2455448,5,B000CBWPXC,"Both Animusic 1 and 2 are unlike anything you've ever seen before.  A sort of fusion between music videos and musical genius, the work of Wayne Lytle and company is a step into a new kind of movie.  Sounds seemingly emanating from animated lasers, robots, various common instruments, and the setting itself combine to create memorable pieces of music and stunning visuals.  The animations are synchronized perfectly with the music and are polished down to the pixel, creating a picturesque image that comes to life.

Animusic 2 is very much like its predecessor.  It features a wide range of musical styles, instruments, and visuals to accompany the music, and with such a rich variety, each viewer is bound to find at least one track that will appeal to him/her.

From the speedy and frantic ""Pogo Sticks"" to the flowing and graceful ""Resonant Chamber,"" each piece showcases a separate style.  In addition, the tracks are ordered perfectly so that there is a pleasant mix of fast and slow pieces.

It is worthwhile to note that not every instrument in Animusic is (un)realistic.  For every one of the more realistic instruments on the DVD, there is a mechanism that's very far-reaching in concept.  The most extreme examples, ""Fiber Bundles"" and ""Heavy Light,"" consist entirely of impossible methods of music, including lights striking a drum for purcussion and strings of color activating alien-looking reeds.

One interesting piece is the return of a familiar set in ""Pipe Dream 2"" due to popular demand.  I found this second version of the ""Pipe Dream"" piece to be much more energetic and chaotic, with many more ball bearings flying everywhere.

The most noticeable change from the first DVD is the appearance of more ""human-like"" instruments.  Unlike a harp playing itself with levitating picks, there's a robot tapping electronic pads on its body.  Unlike a drum machine that rotates cogs of its own free will, there are moving torsos that spin around on large metal rings.  However, Animusic 2 has its fair share of completely non-human objects.

There are eight tracks on this DVD.  They are:

1. Starship Groove

2. Pogo Sticks

3. Resonant Chamber

4. Cathedral Pictures

5. Pipe Dream 2

6. Fiber Bundles

7. Gyro Drums

8. Heavy Light

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Animusic 2, and I will continue to enjoy it again and again.  It's completely different from anything else I had ever seen (other than Animusic 1), and I'm sure that you will enjoy it too.",1159056000,6,2467,4.922330097087379

2455453,3,B000CBWPXC,"The first release is fabulous - Fantasia for a new generation. Our two-year-old marvels at the majesty and mystery, entranced by the visuals. Wonderful, wonderful stuff.

And yes, a lead review here is accurate that ""the similarities outweigh the differences"". Animusic 2 is much more like Animusic than, say, Toy Story - or Deliverance.

But the differences are substantial, and work against our son's enjoyment. Rather than instruments magically playing themselves, and music somehow *happening* on the screen, Animusic 2 is populated with odd, personified robots that do damned near everything.

Whereas Animusic (the first) had an enormous drum machine of interlocking and interacting mechanisms, Animusic 2 would have them as separate entities played by mechanized beings that aren't themselves part of the music. Even he, at two, asks ""Why are they there?"" the few times we actually watch this sequel. Much more often, he'd prefer to just watch the first one. As would I. :)",1149465600,51,980,5.269230769230769
2455454,5,B000CBWPXC,"This second installment of the Animusic video albums is freakin' cool. It is definitely different and innovatively more stylized than the first. What's interesting is that every object designed to play the instruments are all supported by levers and strings, in other words there are no floating sticks or mallets anymore.

These are the eight different animations not in video order but how I rank them:

1. Starship Groove (definitely kickin'; come on, how could you not like the sweet robots playing drums and little electronic pads on themselves on an open space freighter; love the design on the spaceship)

2. Gyro Drums (it's the new ""drum machine""; robotic arms and attached to rings fly all around on this scientific module lined with all types of drums and cymbals; love the part where the drummer in the center and the drums surrounding turn upside down and the electronic drums play; neat sound; very, very rhythmic)

3. Cathedral Pictures (the only one not containing original music; just interestingly arranged by Wayne Lytle, the creator; I like the rotating drum set with two sets of arms playing it, the one string bass, the hammered string instrument (like in ""Acoustic Curves"", the big organ pipes, and the firework-like thing near the end) (It's ""Pictures at an Exhibition"": Promenade; Hut of Baba-Yaga; Great Gate at Kiev)

4. Pogo Sticks (It's no ""Stick Figures"" but still cool. Mr. Bass Man, the stick, returns with two strings, and on wheels bouncing up and down, and brings in his distant cousins which are a higher sounding string instrument, two percussionists, and two mallet instruments)

5. Fiber Bundles (Whoa, this is flashy. Give a listen to the different mixes in the special features section. You'll hear one group of instruments playing separately on three different mixes, plus a fourth one which contains all instruments playing. It's freakin' cool, there's all this buzzing and beeping, it's insane!)

6. Pipe Dream 2 (You kind of know what to expect from the first. Except the music's slightly different. It has almost the exact same intro. The chimes on the ceiling have more on-screen time. It's interesting seeing an older animation with a new piece of music being programmed into it. The set also looks as if it has a used and dirtier look, plus the lighting is a bit different.)

7. Resonant Chamber (Kind of like the ""Aqua Harp"", except this is indoors in the center of a room. It's one giant instrument with numerous parts to it. It's kind of bizarre-looking. The music changes from being mellow to having a groove to it. Each of the windows of the room have different phases of the moon for some reason.)

8. Heavy Light (A bit too spacey sounding. It's still cool though. The structure is outdoors and looks like ancient ruins. Light projecting instruments pop up out of the structure and flash all these lasers everywhere. The music's definitely out there.)

Nothing short of aamzing, proving yet again, that Animusic is a feast for the eyes and ears.",1145750400,14,3001,4.90138067061144
2455455,3,B000CBWPXC,"The animation is excellent, actually I'd rate the animation '5 stars'.  But because the music is not enjoyable to listen to more than once or twice at most, I put the DVD's away and may never watch them again, hence 'the 3 stars' rating.  I would suggest employing a more contemporary musician to add a touch of relevance to today's musical market...any genre would do, new age, R&B, rock, avant-garde, alternative... The monotony of the music is boring.  I would purchase only one more edition just to see if there is any musical improvement.",1142208000,6,543,4.75531914893617
2455456,5,B000CBWPXC,"My kids came home from school talking about this DVD that they saw in Music class.  They couldn't remember what it was called only ANI MUSIC.  Then we were shopping at a home improvement show when came upon a TV surround sound display that was playing the DVD.  My kids sat with my husband watching the DVD while I shopped.  They were so mesmerized by it, and my husband was impressed too.  I asked about the DVD and the lady said that she was out of them because everyone who came by was buy it.  So I called the music teacher and found out there she got hers from amazon.com.  I immediately logged on and bought both I & II.",1141862400,5,626,4.166666666666667

I highly recommend the set of Animusic 1 and 2.  The music is innovative and captivating.  It truely has appeal for all ages and interests. My favorite segment is the cathedral piece. This is a must have addition for any music collector.

My totally honest review would say that my favorite would still be the first Animusic dvd, but the new release is also a delight.",1141084800,4,534,4.568421052631579

2455460,5,B000CBWPXC,"Like many others, I first saw a clip from this on PBS. I was hooked, and the DVD lives up to the hype. The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is fantastic, and the widescreen picture, played through a progressive scan DVD player, with component out connections, to a digital monitor, is exceptional. This is one DVD your system is not too good for. I've found it endlessly entertaining, and the coordination between the music and the visuals is flawless. I've found most people tend to have different personal favorite tracks, but there is no doubt you will find something here you really like.",1138406400,6,583,4.7254901960784315
2455461,3,B000CBWPXC,"I too eagerly anticipated the release of Animusic 2 as I was introduced to part 1 by a friend.  I loved every aspect of part 1 especially the music.  It was realistic, detailed and gave a sense of presence and realizm to the video that acompanied the it (after all isn't that what it is?  music being the foundation with video that goes with the music not the other way around)  After poping in part 2 I watched fiber bundles as my first selection.  I was so disapointed I couldn't believe it. The sound is primarilly unrealistic, sythesized with no real sounding instruments at all.  It was also difficult to tell ""what"" I was looking at. the way the scene was lit or something made it all sortof jumble together.  Being that this animation featured a very non-natural environment I figued the sound was geared towards sounding synthetic in a synthetic environment. I thought maybe it was just not one of the best on the disk. To make a long story short I tried others and was equally not impressed.  The other component that part 2 seems to be missing is the incorperation of stereo panning of the instruments between the speakers as they pan in the scene.  This was another component that made part 1 very realistic.  instruments moving from the left of the screen to the right, pan from the left speaker to the right in sync in part 1 but not in part 2.  The scenes move all over and the music is stuck in one point.  I don't know why this was left out but it drastically compounds the fact that the music is poor to begin with.  I have not heard the 5.1 mix just stereo, but the stereo almost might as well be mono. Samples in resonant chamber are slightly lifeless and dull. The only one I truely enjoyed was ""gyro drums"" VERY realistic samples used, they really made use of the bass if you have great subs, my system has 4 15"" subs driven with 2100 watts and it was amazing! but again, ITS A GYRO, the thing is spinning all over but the sound just sits still. Overall, graphically it's just as good as part 1 but a major let down since the music was what I considered one of the best parts of part 1.  I gave 3 stars becuase I apriciate animusic for what it is, it's a 5 star product but with 2 star or less sound compared to the 5 star of the orriginal.",1137196800,4,2261,4.276995305164319
2455462,4,B000CBWPXC,"I saw the preview for `Animusic 2' and was very eager to get my hands on this new 8 track DVD. After watching it I would have to say that this DVD was just a bit over hyped. `Animusic 2' is not a bad watch at all. I enjoyed watching it, but I think that is the secret word here. This DVD was more visual than musical. The original's music was what really made the overall DVD great. I loved the new sequences from a visual standpoint. It was a huge step forward from the original. The highpoints were the return of the stickman with his new posse as well as the starship grooving robots and who can forget the amazing finale in `Heavy Light'. The visuals were great but the music was just not the perfect match and that was a huge step back. If there will be an `Animusic 3', which there are very few rumors about, I feel Wayne Lyttle needs to remember that its not `Animusic' with out the music.",1135728000,17,896,4.155172413793103

Simply put Animusic 2 doesn't disapoint, it's fabulous! There are 8 animations, one of which is a sequel to Pipe Dream, imaginatively called Pipe Dream 2 ;-)  The graphics are all top notch and the music is terrific. On occasion the music seems to drag on but the graphics picks up the slack. The DVD should win an award for DVD mastering (if there is such a thing). Both wide screen 16:9 and standard screen 4:3 versions are on the disk. I must confess I haven't bothered to watch the 4:3 animations since I was busy salivating over the wide screen version.

The extras included for each animation are also terrific. Some show different musical mixes, and others let you control different viewpoints via the Angle capability of DVD players. The director's commentary is also quite fun and Lytle sounds like he sitting there with you discussing the show.
