Filmed in a small town 10 miles to my North in Charlevoix Michigan. This movie gives you a sense of what teenage kids go though, and at the same time keeping it real! Seeing the local business that i grew up around in the movie was so cool!",1328659200,,353,4.363636363636363

4890785,5,B005TH1ALM,"I was able to watch this film before it was released and I must say that it was pretty good. Although some parts are predictable it does make a good film for teenagers and families. I would recommend this film for youth groups and other youth organizations. The film focuses on four teens who are all friends but something goes wrong with a gang involvement. I see this film relating to many young teens who are being targeted by gangs, but don't know which way they should go. This film is able to show the consequences of involvements in gangs and also the reality of the matter when someone is shot. The characters are able to keep the emotion going throughout the films ever-changing scenes and character interactions.
The characters are able to make the film seem as a real day-to-day film without making it seem rehearsed or fake. I cannot wait for this film to be released in a couple of months so that I can share it with may other people so that they can enjoy this film and pass it onto other people.",1327622400,,1010,4.435483870967742
4890786,5,B005TH1ALM,"I saw this movie before it was released.  It was great.  Fun, funny, scary, real, and inspiring.  It is one of the best produced Indy films produced in 2011.  It explores some great moral truths without being ""preachy"" -- guilt, forgiveness, secrets, temptation and redemption.  It's a mix of great sports action, chase scenes, being a teenage boy, and small town reality.  Your whole family will enjoy it!",1326931200,,406,4.897058823529412
4890787,5,B005TH1ALM,"I am so glad to see this movie released - thank the Lord!  It has come together with pace, with great music, with very strong acting performances, and with a good look.

4890788,5,B005TH1ALM,"I can't wait to see this movie, GOd is doing great and amazing things in this dayand age. I hope this movie touches the hearts of many people and make them really think about their life today and how much they need God to be a part of it.",1329782400,3,238,3.877551020408163
4890789,5,B005TH1ALM,"John Grooters does a fantastic job in bringing this movie together. I was fortunate enough to have nearly the entire movie filmed in my hometown, so i was able to be there for a lot of the shooting and casting. When I saw the action packed, thrilling, comical, outstanding feature all mixed and edited, I felt honored to have a part as an extra in this movie. You'll find yourself laughing, sitting on the edge of the chair, and possibly crying through this great film. Not to mention, the soundtrack to this film is extraordinary! No matter what you believe, The Frontier Boys is a must see film suitable for a family movie night.",1329696000,6,631,4.543859649122807
4890790,5,B005TH1ALM,"We attended a premier of this film in Chicago!  It was outstanding!  Teenagers have such a difficult time showing and sharing their faith with their peers, yet in this film it is so natural for these boys to discuss and share their faith. These teens face problems that we hope our kids will never have to face, but we hope our kids would be able to deal with the problems as these 4 young men do.  There is a lot of action scenes, yet there is a lot of friendship and love through out the movie.  The actors do a great job!",1329091200,3,524,4.107843137254902

This is a must go see christian film for the entire family to enjoy and all ages! This movie has it all a wonderful cast along with excitement and thrill, love for basketball, the importance of family and friends and truth. This is a movie you could watch over and over and take something new from it everytime! Not only does this film remind you of the importance of friends and family but also that the truth will set you free! Also sparks interest with teen boys and the sport of basketball and what they go through as a team. This movie teaches our kids to rely on Gods word and the truth will set us free. A wonderful, touching movie based on christian beliefs.  Great scenery in this film as well as music! You won't be disappointed! It will touch you! You may even shed a tear!

4890793,5,B005TH1ALM,"I was lucky enough to see this wonderful film in the theater, and cannot wait for the DVD release.  As parents, we do everything we can to protect our children, this movie shows that even in small towns ""life happens"".  The movie does not try to sugar coat the struggles and emotions, but gives you a glimpse of the power of friends, family and God's grace.  A powerful message for teens, they are not as isolated or as invincible as they often feel. Don't hesitate, you should get a copy of this movie for your home collection.",1328745600,4,528,4.422680412371134
4890794,5,B005TH1ALM,"This movie is amazing. Frontier Boys is action packed, family friendly, and has great morals. My friend is one of the main actors in this movie and he gives a great performance through the intense scenes and does a great job making the fun scenes look easy. The Frontier Boys has great male role models. They ask really challenging questions that young men are afraid to ask. I am glad someone is making movies out of them! Great movie. You all should watch this movie!!!",1328659200,,471,4.552941176470588
4890795,5,B005TH1ALM,"I've been waiting patiently for this movie to come out on DVD.  Had the pleasure to watch it being filmed and couldn't wait to see it on the big screen.  Truly a movie that you can take the entire family too without worrying about the lesson the kids will learn from it.  I plan to get a copy of this movie for myself, for my daughter, and for many of my friends.  Congratulations to the entire ""team"" who made this movie a reality...we need more movies like this for society to watch.  Truly a blessing in a DVD case!",1328659200,,518,4.191919191919192
4890796,5,B005TH1ALM,"This Movie was a great, action packed christian film. As an 18 year old male it was struck me at the heart. The film portrayed the everyday struggles we as men face while becoming a spiritual leader. The film stressed the importance of friendship. The christian men came along side their best friend as showed Christ no matter what he did. The basketball scenes are great. Basketball was significant to all the people, but God was #1. This is one for the whole family. All boys should watch as a great example of trying to be a spiritual leader.",1328659200,2,545,4.515151515151516
4890797,5,B005TH1ALM,"I have been  waiting for this movie to come out on dvd, I am so excited to own it. It's a great family-friendly story appeals to anyone looking for an honest, small-town drama with a spiritual message.  It will not disappoint.",1328659200,,226,4.487804878048781

4890799,5,B005TH1ALM,"How does a young man deal with attempted murder in his own neighborhood? How does the Bible ""fit"" in a mean and mixed up world? Frontier Boys is a real life action adventure of faith that is gripping, warm and unforgettable. I highly recommend it to go into the homes of everyone you care about.",1328659200,,295,4.381818181818182
4890800,5,B005TH1ALM,"Not only was this a great movie about a small town group of boys who have to face the ""real world,"" John Grooters chose to use true to life local boys to play the other teams' players. My son was one of the boys in the movie and it was fantastic to see how he took these boys and made such a great movie. The other upside to this movie was that the characters were true to life. Lots of fun and a great message.",1328659200,,411,3.847058823529412
4890801,5,B005TH1ALM,"This is a wonderful family movie with a very positive message.  There is a strong religious tone and good vs. evil story line.  But even if you are not religious, the plot is good and I think you can still walk away from this movie happy and not feel like you were ""preached"" to.  It's refreshing to see a movie that inspires kids and teens to do the right thing. There is plenty of action and a couple faces you might recognize.  Plus the movie was filmed in a couple small towns in Northern Michigan so if you're from the area, that's really cool too!",1328659200,,553,4.238095238095238
4890802,5,B005TH1ALM,"I definately would recommend seeing this movie.  John Grooters had a great idea of a small Northern Michigan town for the background of the movie.. It did have tears, laughter, suspense, fear, actually everything your looking for in a movie!!!! Actually showing what goes on around our communities, but is hidden and we don't even know it. !!!!  I would love to see a part 2 myself !!!!!  Great Job John and cast and crew !!!!",1328659200,,426,4.578947368421052
4890803,5,B005TH1ALM,"We saw this movie while in the theatre and we all enjoyed it. The setting, northern MI, is beautiful and the story draws the viewer in. The message, that although it may be a tough choice, we can choose to do the right thing, is a positive element for teens and adults alike. We are looking forward to watching it again on DVD.",1328659200,,327,4.2063492063492065
4890804,5,B005TH1ALM,This movie has a very exciting story filled with life lessons that every person needs to learn! A must buy for the family to watch together,1328659200,,139,4.384615384615385
4890805,4,B005TH1ALM,"I've been waiting for this movie to come out on dvd, because I wanted to share it will all of my friends who didn't have the opportunity to see it in the theater.  It's a great family-friendly story that should appeal to anyone looking for an honest, small-town drama with a spiritual message intertwined.  The characters were are nicely developed, and the production quality is top-notch for a company's freshman production.  And it didn't hurt that the exterior shots were filmed in my small northern Michigan hometown.

See this movie!",1328659200,,538,4.944444444444445
4890806,5,B005TH1ALM,"A wonderful movie to watch with your teens.  A topic they'll be able to relate to.  Tears, laughter and inspiration.  I wish we could see it on the big screen again, but now we'll be able to watch it and share it with others.",1328659200,,225,4.068181818181818
4890807,5,B005TH1ALM,I was lucky enough to see this when it was in a theater near me. I wasn't expecting much for being a smaller film but living in the state where it was filmed was enough for me to support it. I am glad I made the choice to see this film. The cast was great and got along well together. This film will mess with your emotions and will inspire you when its over. Everybody needs to watch this movie at least once.,1328659200,,410,3.9518072289156625
8486170,4,B005TH1ALM,"This was a good movie for family viewing. It was a bit choppy, and the scrip of the lead player could have been written better. Not confronting his big brother early on was not realistic, but the acting was great.",1494115200,,213,4.35
8486171,5,B005TH1ALM,Great movie from an excellent producer.,1477958400,,39,5.666666666666667

8486173,5,B005TH1ALM,"I enjoy watching movies with my kids and they have now moved away from Disney movies.  I really like watching true stories with them and discussing the issue or values of the story.  Sometimes I find a great story but the filming may be off or the acting a bit off this is not true of The Frontier Boys.  The filming was good and the story lines follow what is going on with youth today in temptations, values and family relationships.  We laughed, cried and discussed what we would do in a situation like portrayed in this film.  Though it is not a ""true story""  it is truth.  I look forward to more films like this/",1399939200,,617,4.267241379310345
8486174,5,B005TH1ALM,"Undefeated and with a conference championship within their sight, the Charlevoix, Michigan High School basketball team are devastated when their star player, T. J. Lewis, becomes the victim of a drive by shooting. T. J. is left in a coma, fighting for his life.

A close knit set of his friends, known as the Frontier Boys; Jed, Brent, and Jackson were left to work out their own unanswered question as to ""Why?"" this happened to their friend T. J.  Brian, left with his own secret, was drawn between loyalty to his brother and his loyalty to his friends; Jed with a determination to locate the driver of the car involved in the shooting, and Jackson filled with doubts about God.

I quickly found myself personally involved and inspired by the film. The casting is excellent, the characters well portrayed, which enhanced the action filled plot, building suspense right up to a climatic surprise ending. The dramatic dialog draws the spectator in emotionally. The film presents a strong Gospel Message without being ""preachy."" Other life lessons for building character are introduced through the basketball coach.

""The Frontier Boys"" is family entertainment with a message of loyalty, friendship, and faith exemplified by camaraderie, parental love, and example.

A complimentary copy of this DVD was provided for review purposes. The opinions expressed are my own.",1369008000,,1367,5.13963963963964
8486175,4,B005TH1ALM,"This movie is a low budget film that was filmed in my hometown. That's mainly the reason why I like the film and because I am in it. Otherwise it's a bit cheesy, but overall a good film.",1354147200,,186,3.9210526315789473
8486176,5,B005TH1ALM,"Amazing movie, John Grooters did an awesome job. I grew up in Charlevoix Michigan so it was nice to see the old high school again. Also sports report #1 (Scott Boss) I grew up with him and his family. His parents were like my Aunt and Uncle. But enough of that, the movie inspired me, it just goes to show that there is truelt power in prayer and we all need to do it everyday and in everything we do.",1348531200,,401,4.025
8486177,5,B005TH1ALM,"It was right up my alley since I am from the area that they say the movie was ""filmed in and around"". My family had gone to the Elk Rapids school in real life,so it was all familiar,though in some scenes it could have been anywhere,because where I am from, the outdoors,is all wide open beautiful spaces looking the same. The movie had a sur-real attitude at first. Some of the actors actually looked like they were from down below and were city slickers and not country folk. I then thought about what I had watched and realized it was an amazing movie,and definetly had a message behind it. I checked into the drug issues in the small towns around Charlevoix and and Elk Rapids etc.to see if the movie was making it appear worse then it was.  No,they were doing people a favor  making a movie to show what is indeed going on,in all the innocent looking small towns,not only where I am from,but all over America.  Please watch this movie to learn about the schools and what they are going through once the recess bell rings,and sports begin etc..GREAT MOVIE.Outside drug rings are indeed coming in from the larger cities grabbing  a hold of our children with the enticement of money. It was a huge eye opener.",1336348800,8,1210,4.511415525114155
