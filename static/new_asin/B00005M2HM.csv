7944731,5,B00005M2HM,"This is one of the top 5 of the 25 Carry On movies made.  The intellectual content is very high.  The English language used is culturally upper class.  Various archetypical people are satirized in a manner which would make Monty Python green with envy.  One of the characters is played by Joan Hickson who became famous later as Miss Marple.

The only sad thing about the movie is that the woman with the large chest committed suicide some years late.",1122508800,3,451,4.5875

To say the word, IT, is heavily emphasised a lot in this film would be somewhat of a drastic understatement! Carry On Loving hit contemporary times perfectly with this one, a fact reflected in its huge blockbuster success in the Box office. Needless to say the film is not amongst the finest in the series but is still an adequatley enjoyable film.
Sid james and Hattie Jaques run a fraud dating agency. They pretend they are amarried although they're not, purley for business reasons. Rather like an early entry in the series, Carry On regardless (1960), it is the basis that is used to draw a series of sketches linked by the dating agency. Some of it works whilst other scenes just falls flat on its face.
Amongst the rest of the cast were Kenneth Williams, Joan Sims, Charles Hawtrey (all three of these main regulars in the series are underused considerably a lot in this entry), Terry Scott, Imogen Hassall, Jaki Piper, Richard' O Callaghan, Patsy Rolands and Julian Holloway. All plays their parts in their ususal inimitable style although on some scenes you can't help but detect an air of staleness. None of the jokes or the double entrendes that ensue throughout the film are fresh. Most of the material is simply warmed over and drawn from other entrieres. But as said at the beginning of the review, it still curiously manages to be an entertaining film never the less and some great fun and laughs are to be had in this one. The silly and predictable pie fight at the end of the film is surprisingly good.
Slap stick fun, comic misunderstandings and bawdy gags galore in Carry On Loving. Worth a watch. Recommended",996278400,,1705,4.667774086378738
