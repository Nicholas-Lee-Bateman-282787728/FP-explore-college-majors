8387635,5,B0032REKAO,OMG.  I purchased this wonderful program.  I find myself obsessed with the series. I Love everything about the monkey king and this does not let me down. Reminds me of the 70s Saturday morning shows i used to watch.,1520294400,,215,4.487179487179487
8387636,5,B0032REKAO,Saw this in China on Chinese TV 30 years ago. Wonderful series about the Monkey King. The make-up rivals Planet of the Apes. The special effects and scenery are great. I've been waiting for a English subtitled edition!,1482451200,3,218,4.7631578947368425
8387637,3,B0032REKAO,"Video quality isn't as good as I had hoped.  I guess the original source didn't allow the DVD remaster to do much, but I was still hoping for something a little clearer.  Packaging and presentation is nice though.",1446508800,,213,4.578947368421052
8387638,5,B0032REKAO,"I grew up with these tails and stories.  I even took the time and read the novel itself.  I would like to say it was great and followed the novel closely and though it leaves out a few chapters here and there it is a good story and love the film.  The effects are good for the time it was made and by today standers it will not hold but the story itself is a long and old one. did not need the sub-titles but was there for my American friends that watched a few episodes with me, and since I read the novel I could fill in the gaps and explain what went on.  But to say I truly loved it.",1423958400,4,587,3.7868852459016393
8387639,5,B0032REKAO,"I have been Iooking for this with English subtitles. Well, here it is. It also has added chapters that I never saw even when I was living in China. Good copy and inexpensive.",1403827200,3,174,4.303030303030303
8387640,3,B0032REKAO,"I finally got time to watch it and in the first CD Chapter 3 ""Monkey Kings makes a mess at heavenly palace"". about 5 minutes into the scene where WuKong is chasing after the gourd bottle then it skips to the next chapter. WHAT!

I was so sad that I didn't get to see my favorite part in this series. Nothing is made perfect I guess.

P.S it was a collector's edition.",1384473600,3,367,4.083333333333333
8387641,4,B0032REKAO,"The audio is only in Mandarin Chinese. There is no audio in Cantonese Chinese as stated in the item description.

The subtitles are in the following:
Chinese Simplified
Chinese Traditional
English
Japanese

I used the English subtitles and it really wasn't that well translated, but it is better than nothing.

The original 25 episodes are included. An additional 16 episodes are included which are a better video quality than the original 25. The additional 16 episodes are about more trials that the pilgrims endured. The actor for Sun WuKong is the same and the others might be the same actors too, but their acting style is different in the additional 16 episodes. The special effects and costumes are different too. I prefer the acting style of the original 25.

The DVDs played on my Region 1 DVD player with problems. The box says NTSC as well.",1378252800,6,851,4.808219178082192
8387642,5,B0032REKAO,"I decided to buy this when i saw that it was available on amazon.com. I had previously watched a few episodes when I was kid and found it to be very entertaining even though I didn't really understand it very well then.  I don't know why the previous reviewer said that there are no subtitles, because my copy had English subtitles that were very well done to capture the wit and humor.  I found the overall narrative and and the sublots of each of episodes to be very strong and engaging.  This, coupled with great actors who play the four main roles makes for a very solid series which make you laugh and touch you at the same time.
The  only thing that somewhat subpar here are the special effects.  The story obviously required a lot of special effects and they are not very good given it was created quite a while ago.  I think if they were able to create the same series with the same actors using today's special effects, it would be completely amazing.",1356480000,10,960,4.395480225988701
8387643,1,B0032REKAO,There was not any English Subtitle therefore my rating is zero they should take the English Subtitle out it is misleading. It looks like it could have been OK,1352592000,5,158,4.482758620689655
