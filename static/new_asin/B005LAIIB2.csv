4774737,2,B005LAIIB2,"A young couple is getting married, and there is a problem. The groom's mother thinks the bride's parents are still married. So, they pretend to be, even though they are long divorced. If this sounds like a funny scenario full of laughs, it is more like a predictable scenario with occasional laughs. There is a lot of talent here, but it is mostly wasted as this filmmaker tries too hard to be funny and quirky, as this movie does have the occasional LOL moment, but they are too few and far between. For a fun evening at the movies, there are better choices.",1370822400,2,559,4.436893203883495
4774738,1,B005LAIIB2,"Conventional wisdom has it that, now the planet has personal publishing capability, a networked universe in which to publish and a convenient means of sorting the rare grains of wheat from the deluge of chaff, there is no longer any chance Hollywood's resources will be committed to any script not thoroughly deserving of them.

On this view, the idea that titans of screen like Robert de Niro, Susan Sarandon, Robin Williams or Diane Keaton could have the bandwidth, let alone the inclination, to toy with anything but the most brilliant screenplay is baffling: with their agents deluged with scripts before which Bacon, Beckett or even the Bard himself would tremble in wonder, the only dilemma which such gem to pick up.

This theory seems, a priori, correct, transcendentally true and unanswerable. How could it be not so? The Homo Economici who populate the finance departments of studios like Lionsgate would insist upon it. They would require Excel projections to prove it. Granted, a Beckett might be overlooked in favour of a Danny Boyle, the driving imperative being commercial and not artistic, but nonetheless the raw material would assuredly be infinitely tuned and finely sharpened to give the punters precisely what they want.

Now to be sure, even with these precautions box office success is never entirely assured, but in this day and age it will at least have as much statistical probability as financial projections and a properly configured business model can deliver. Failure scenarios are restricted to ""black swans"": at any rate, things less soluble than basic defects in the raw material of the motion picture itself.

However self-evident that truth seems, recent Hollywood fare such as Justin Zackham's forthcoming romantic comedy The Big Wedding, seems heartily to falsify it. Some of the greatest craters ever augured into Southern Californian soil are papered with the charred pages of dismal scripts. Zackham's new movie might be about to make another one.

The Big Wedding manages little in the way of sense or logic, let alone romance or comedy, and is burdened by a screenplay so poor and misshapen as to beggar belief. The film is not without its virtues: it is nicely lit, coloured and framed. The magnificent cast is heroic in its effort to work this scant material into something face-saving. Susan Sarandon and Katherine Heigl work overtime to imbue their characters with dimension wholly unadverted to by the script. Robert De Niro skilfully converts a couple of tricky dead-ball opportunities that a lesser actor would have skied into the stands. But outside these small redemptions, there is much stony ground.

Any screenwriter possessed of a cast as strong as this who still plumps for gross-out gags and pratfalls for laughs deserves to have his practising certificate taken away. Justin Zackham derives comedy from Katherine Heigl throwing up and fainting, Robert de Niro being repeatedly punched, a dinner party being rained on, and a wedding party falling into a lake.

This is not all. Zackham cavalierly stakes everything, five minutes in, on a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gigli/dp/B001E91SOS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gigli</a>&nbsp;gambit. Now you may not know what one of those is. If you don't, you should feel blessed, and I would not presume to burden you. (If you're not sure, the keyword is ""gobble"". Trust me, if you do, you'll know instantly what I mean).

But Gigli's moment, ghastly though it was, took place between Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck; at the time, these were two beautiful people in their prime. Zackham's involves Robert De Niro and Susan Sarandon, neither of whom should be offended to be considered long past theirs, with Diane Keating watching. Generally, one is meant to be quiet at the cinema but, even bearing that in mind, a profound sense of speechlessness descended on the theatre as the scene played out. This alone would be enough to bury most pictures singlehandedly. Zackham, however, leaves nothing to chance.

Thereafter the plot doesn't so much as lose its way as demonstrate total disorientation from the outset. Try this for size, and this is just the premise: Freelance sculptor Don (De Niro) and estranged wife Ellie (Keaton)'s adopted Colombian orphan son Alejandro (Ben Barnes), now a Harvard alum, is marrying their social-climbing neighbours' daughter (Amanda Seyfried) at the beautiful Connecticut house which De Niro randily cohabits with long-time girlfriend Bebe (Sarandon). Orphan son's non-English-speaking mother Madonna (Patricia Ray), a Catholic of such devotion that she cannot abide the idea of divorce even in a father-in-law, is flying in from her South American convent with her fruity daughter Nuria (Ana Ayora), who oscillates between saintly forbearance and outright nymphomania, based purely on the unsolicited advice of Ellie (her step-brother's mother-in-law to be).

De Niro and Keaton's other adult children are Heigl, a childless lawyer having marital troubles, and Jared (Topher Grace), a handsome but chaste registrar who, to the frustration of every nurse on the ward, is saving himself (but is not, despite all appearances to the contrary, ""otherwise inclined""). Robin Williams is the family priest who may or may not be hardline on pre-marital fornication (it changes scene to scene) notithstanding being, like De Niro, a recovering alcoholic.

This is just your starter for ten: All these dramatic potentialities are played out over the eighty-five minute running time of this comedy. It might have been possible for a Beckett, or a Boyle, or a Richard Curtis, to have constructed a screenplay that could develop and resolve all these interlocking possibilities satisfactorily in an hour and a half, but it's a task that seems well beyond Justin Zackham.

4774739,2,B005LAIIB2,"With the highly anticipated release of Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby, I decided to re-read the F. Scott Fitzgerald classic novel about moral decay in American Society.  Reading the book again was meant to assist me in my review for the upcoming Gatsby, but it turns out there's another story of tragic spoiled Americans consumed with their own lavish excesses already in theaters, and it's called The Big Wedding.

The Big Wedding is a star-studded turkey of a movie that can be enjoyed as more of an oddity than anything else.  On the surface, it appears to be a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy about the goofy pitfalls that occur within the chain of events leading up to a big American family wedding.  However, Justin Zackham both writes and directs a film that if anything, actively attempts to rationalize dishonesty as an honorable and necessary trait within the family dynamic.

The story revolves around the Griffin family as they prepare for the wedding  between adopted son Alejandro (Ben Barnes) and his fianc Missy (Amanda Seyfried).  The Griffin patriarch is Don (Robert DeNiro) who is hosting the wedding at his home that he shares with his girlfriend, Bebe (Susan Sarandon).  DeNiro continues his series of baffling role choices here, and it's hard to envision what drew him to the character of Don, although he probably hasn't played a character who takes this many blows to the head since Raging Bull.  The wedding draws an ensemble cast together that includes Don's ex-wife Ellie (Diane Keaton) and Don and Ellie's two children Lyla (Katherine Heigl) and Jared (Topher Grace) both of which vary in degrees of estrangement from Don.  The conflict hinges on the news that Alejandro's biological mother Madonna will also be attending the wedding, and her ultra-conservative views on marriage and divorce cause Alejandro to plead with Don and Ellie to pretend to be married so not to offend her.  Various other subplots regarding Lyla's marriage troubles, Don's relationship with Bebe, and Jared's awkward fling with Madonna's beautiful daughter Nuria fill out the film's 89 minute running time, but none of them are remarkably interesting or funny.  Additionally, Robin Williams is given absolutely nothing to do as Father Moinighan in a screenplay that feels like a series of wasted opportunities.

While The Big Wedding certainly disappoints given its potential, it is oddly watchable.  Most of the characters are quite unlikable, and it begs the viewer to question whether this is intentional.  Katherine Heigel's character is uniquely deplorable, an example being when she candidly announces who she needs to ""lynch"" to get a Cosmo.  Zackham makes it quite clear that every character has, in one way or another, used deception, fraud, or trickery as a recourse for trying to keep a family together.  This thematic exploration and justification for dishonesty feels wildly out of place in a supposedly fun wedding comedy, but it is a strangely fascinating direction to take.  Perhaps this film would work better if it were more Gatsby and less My Big Fat Greek Wedding, but what we're left with is a bit of a mess, albeit a somewhat intentional one. D+

The Big Wedding is rated R and runs 89 minutes.  You might want to make sure there's an open bar before attending this wedding.",1370131200,4,3301,5.022018348623853
4774740,3,B005LAIIB2,"The theme of this film is that ""there are different kinds of love."" Alejandro (Ben Barnes) was adopted from Colombia by Don (Robert De Niro) and Ellie (Diane Keaton). Alejandro is getting married to Missy (Amanda Seyfried) whose parents (David Rasche/Christine Ebersole) are embarrassingly white. Don is divorced and married his mistress Bebe (Susan Sarandon). After a decade his wife and ex-wife get along very well. Robin Williams plays the priest that will preside over the ceremony. There are also two siblings. Dr. Jared (Topher Grace) is a 29 year old virgin. Lyla (Katherine Heigl) just left her husband. Just about everyone in the group has a dirty little secret that comes into play, but for the most part doesn't mesh well.

If this wasn't enough, Alejandro's biological mother (Patricia Rae) is coming up from Colombia for the wedding. She is very Catholic and considers divorce a sin. She doesn't know Don and Ellie are divorced so they will pretend they aren't (yawn). She shows up with a daughter (Ana Ayora) who has designs for Jared.

The film has great stars and a great indie style plot and characters. The secrets make for a great story. However it didn't come together. The dialouge failed to create on screen chemistry. Too much of the film seemed fake, the characters never hooked you. The humor consisted of embarrassment more than anything. Attempts to make fun of the Catholic Church were weak. It would make for a decent one night rental, but not the heart warming indie keeper we love.

4774743,2,B005LAIIB2,"""The Big Wedding"" touts an all-star cast of actors that made me at first think this was another one of those Gary Marshall, Katerine Fugate movies like ""Valentine's Day"" or ""New Years Eve""; which I hated by the way. Yet, it isn't. It is actually written and directed by Justin Zackham, who wrote ""The Bucket List"" and a silly ""Animal House"" wannabe movie called ""Going Greek"". Based on this small resume, his NYU film school degree must be the reason that he attracted people like Robert DeNiro, Susan Sarandon, Diane Keaton, Robin Williams, Katherine Heigl, Topher Grace and Amanda Seyfried to come together for a `wedding' movie.

The movie centers round Deniro's character, Don, for the most part. On the surface, they have a pretty normal pampered socialite existence. He's preparing to marry off his adopted son, Alejandro, and having adopted him from South America, his real mother has never visited, until now. Opposed to divorce, being a devout catholic, Alejandro doesn't know how to explain to her that Don is divorced and both his girlfriend and his ex-wife will be at the wedding; the shenanigans begin.

A while back, movies like this, with all-star casts and slice of life type stories, were made all the time and then they got kind of old because you always wondered who was going to die or who was going to get cancer. Apparently, nowadays, we're just getting movies that have no punch line at all. Sure, there are punch lines to ""The Big Wedding"", in fact, there is a half-a-dozen of them, but none of them carry any impact. They're just resolution to a ninety-minute movie that threw all kinds of situations at you, one crazier than the other. Although none of them are all that crazy.

I would be lying if I said I didn't find some situations laugh inducing throughout the film, but for the most part, the jokes work like a family reunion; your family says some funny stuff, but ultimately they think they're funnier than they really are. The film was written with the hopes that Robert DeNiro talking like a dirty old man would be the selling point and at times it works and at times, it gets old.

The strange thing about ""The Big Wedding"" is that the writer/director, Zackham managed to get all of these fantastic actors attached to his film and they all bring these characters to life as good as you would expect. I wanted to like the film and there were times that I thought I would, but ultimately I'm left baffled as to how Zackham did it. His script isn't that good. What little plot there is to the film isn't fleshed out, and almost the entire screwball comedies comedy is placed in the hands of Robert DeNiro saying all kinds of dirty stuff that would make most girls cringe in disgust.",1367625600,,2716,4.64033264033264
4774744,4,B005LAIIB2,"There isn't one specific comedy in the history of film that everyone can agree on as being a good (let along funny) film.  With that being said, you can only expect so much when you hear about the release of another movie centering on a wedding, which happens to have some of the biggest names in Hollywood on its guest list.  It's disturbing to see such harsh criticism for a film that was always going to have the majority of critics attacking it from the get-go - either because they aren't smart enough to see the humor in the situations of a purely over-the-top melodrama, or they're just a huge crank that can't appreciate absurdly hilarious family interactions.  The goal of this genre of film is to make you laugh, clearly by any means necessary.  But, for all of the critical writers out there that thrive on attacking a simple R-rated wedding comedy for the sake of being negative - well, I'm sorry, but you need to lighten up on the elitism and embrace the chaos.  Please, do yourself a favor...and get a clue.  With that being said, here's the review for this insanely funny wedding film, The Big Wedding.

Written and directed by Justin Zackham (The Bucket List), The Big Wedding starring Robert De Niro as Don Griffin, plays the father of an adopted groom-to-be, Alejandro (Ben Barnes).  Amongst those on the wedding guest list includes Alejandro's adoptive mother and Don's ex-wife, Ellie (Diane Keaton) - not to mention Don's long-term girlfriend/Ellie's best friend, Bebe (Susan Sarandon).  However, matters become complicated when Alejandro drops the news that his religious biological mother will be coming to the wedding, only she's unaware that Alejandro parents are divorced.  Fearful of what his real mother will think, he asks Don and Ellie to act like a married couple until she leaves.  The secrets begin to build and the shenanigans ensue as the family drama plays out just days before the wedding.  Katherine Heigl, Topher Grace, and Robin Williams also star in supporting roles.

First off, if you're not into crude humor, then you might as well do yourself a favor and skip this one.  The sexual overtones are just screaming at the top of their lungs throughout the course of this film.  However, if you like that sort of thing, you are highly encouraged to give this movie a chance before letting all the negative criticism sink into your head.  Robert De Niro, Susan Sarandon, and Diane Keaton complement each other surprising well.  At first, they come off as desperate stars dying to stay relevant in a wedding knock-off film, but like most any film, if you give it a chance - it might just surprise you.  The laughs are a bit slow in the beginning, but as the film progresses, you'll find yourself gasping for air.  Just a few of the humorous scenes involve Robert De Niro on a diving board, and a family trip to the church confessional - which includes an appearance by Robin Williams as a priest.

It's difficult to say the acting is anything special in the film.  After all, the whole point of the story is to show how dysfunctional a family can be when they're finally all in the same place.  It's hardly believable that even the most dysfunctional families can be this messed up.  The depth of these characters is hardly worth discussing, but if you can see past all of the nonsensical sexual references aside, there is a great deal of heart to be found in this film.  The story is silly, the cast is vulgar, but once again, if you like that sort of thing, then you might just laugh harder than you have in quite some time.  This is nothing more than a light-hearted film targeted towards an older crowd - and women, too.

Overall, the film is short (90 minutes), sweet, and to the point.  It features family dysfunction at its finest, not to mention a great deal fun-poking at the Catholic Church.  In any event, there's relatively no theme to be taken from this film, other than some people might be better off not getting married.  Still, it's a humorous good time at the movies, and depending on your sense of humor, The Big Wedding might be a good choice to see if you're tired of drama and action flicks.

Adapted from John Stphane-Bron's original screenplay ""Mon frre se marie"" we watch a comedy of errors as these good folks try to sort things out.

If you look at the cast, you know this is for ""People of a certain age...""
  * Robert De Niro (""Silver Linings Playbook"") is Don, the groom's father, who has to let his mistress of eight years move to a hotel while he pretends to still be married to the mother of his children.
  * Dianne Keaton (""Darling Companion"") is Ellie, who, eight years ago, lost her husband of twenty years to her best friend. Even though the divorce was amicable, things ARE a bit awkward.
  * Susan Sarandon (""Snitch"") plays Bebe, the ""other"" woman, AND Ellie's former best friend.
  * Katherine Heigl (''Life as We Know It"") is their eldest daughter Lyla, who is in the throes of a divorce but hasn't told her parents yet.
  * Topher Grace (""The Double"") is Jared, always loyal to his brother and sister but also working on his own growth as a man.
  * Amanda Seyfried (""Les Miserables"") plays Missy, the bride, with her own drama as her parents unveil some of THEIR secrets.
  * Ben Barnes (""Chronicles of Narnia"") impressed me as Alejandro, their son who was adopted from Columbia. He's the groom and his birth mother is the one they are deceiving. This British-born actor not only spoke American, but he seemed to speak Spanish pretty well, too.

4775349,5,B005LAIIB2,This is an excellant comedy.  It is about the a family where every member has coping problems with the people they love and how they come to terms with each other and with life.  It is very funny most of the time with the serious drama parts well acted and touching.  A very entertaining  and rewarding film to watch.  Highest possible recommendation.

4775926,1,B005LAIIB2,"This movie goes to show you that when money is spent on big names, there is no excess funds for good writing. The film in a nutshell: white family gathers for white wedding. This film sets out to prove that WASPs do, in fact, have sex. The cast's sexual relations are so inbred that incest becomes not only enjoyable but a central narrative plot. Will the white yuppie couple, one of whom is not entirely white because he speaks Spanish (racist plot included), marry? Yes. Will the older, curmudgeon-y sister who complains about years of infertility get pregnant? Yes. And will the super-successfully, allegedly well-endowed, OBGYN brother who has breasted his virginity for 30 years lose it to the first eligible woman who enters the plot? You betcha. The only thing BIG about this film is its epic failure. How they conned Susan Sarandon into this role is beyond me.",1442361600,,868,4.793333333333333

Hard to make sense of dialog when it's splattered with so many adjectives you can't locate a subject and verb to connect. I wish I'd never even seen the first 5 minutes.

4777429,5,B005LAIIB2,"With a star-studded cast like this, even the most banal storyline would have been fun to watch.  Delightfully, this wasn't the case!  The story was funny, witty and loaded with twists that you don't see coming.  The Big Wedding is not an Oscar contender with a heavy storyline.  Instead it's a delightful piece of delicious wedding cake, made to consume in one big bite.  Although this is a comedy, there are poignant moments that hit out of nowhere, and are all the more touching because of it.",1437436800,,495,4.64367816091954
4777430,2,B005LAIIB2,"Boring with over the top characterizations.  The best friend causes a divorce and marries the husband;which estranged the daughter from the father and prevents her from truly loving her husband.  Now everyone is back together for the marriage of their adopted Latino son to the blond haired girl next door.  His mom and sister decide to show up from Latin America fr the wedding-not your typical adoption from Latin America.  The South American sister is a nymphomaniac who gets the main family's doctor son, who is living a vow of celibacy, to question his choice.  I like the Actors; unfortunately, the story is too predictable and the characters were a little too stereotype. I got the feeling there was a little toomuch improvisation going on and not an interesting enough script.  I really didn't care about what happened to any of them.  I stopped watching about halfway through and skipped to the end.  I do wonder how someone who identifies as Latino got through Harvard with no Asian, Black or Latino friends he wanted to invite to his wedding (almost 50% of the student body there).  Hey, but that's Hollywood.",1437350400,,1120,4.852631578947369

Kind of the cliche family wedding with closet skeletons coming out throughout the film kind of deal as to be expected. The major plot, at least what I think is the major plot, between Sarandon, De Niro and Keaton was the most entertaining out of all of them the rest were kind of boring/mediocre and a little disappointing.

4778193,2,B005LAIIB2,"We found this to be a big waste of some big names in Hollywood. Based on the acting chops available, one has to wonder why so little of it made it through to the final form. Did they just not care or were the good parts left on the cutting room floor? Maybe they took this gig to fill some time in the schedule. All the potential in the world with this cast but somebody forget to tell them to get to work. They are probably all embarrassed enough when they saw the film so I'll say no more about what could have been (but isn't).

4781370,3,B005LAIIB2,"First let me say that this movie is not as bad as some of these reviews make it seem. That being said, it lacks some cohesiveness in the plot and could have used some fine tuning in the manuscript stage. It just feels like it's trying to hard. I would describe the movie as the film equivelent little brother to movies like ""Momma Mia"" or ""The Family Stone"". It's trying so hard to live up to the reputations of those older siblings, it can't find itself. I really only have two major issues with the film as a whole. #2- the underuse of such a great cast. Writer/Director Justin Zackham really didn't try to get his money's worth out of this star studded cast. We expect better from such legendary names, though I honestly think they just did the best they could with such limited writing. Speaking of writing, that brings me to my #1 issue with the film- the slightly racist portrayal of a Columbian-American by actor Ben Barnes. Now my issue isn't necessarily having a British actor playing a Latin role, but the blatant orange self-tanner they used to make ""Alejandro"", and I quote, ""beige"". I get that he was adopted from Columbia and raised by a white family but really?, this movie came out in 2013. Could Lionsgate not find a suitable Latin actor to play this role or, here's a hint, Latin people come is a variety of hues and pigments like most races. I just felt that pulling a lighter version of ""blackface"" was completely unnecessary. Plus it was just a horrible and unnatural makeup job. Overall, I saw what Justin Zackham was trying to do and in some places succeeded. I'd watch it again, if for nothing else than to see Diane Keaton punch Robert De Niro in the face.

4783047,1,B005LAIIB2,"If I could I'd give this zero stars. It is beyond bad and made worse by the fact that a few of the stars in their glory would never have chosen to lend their name or presence to something so excrutiatingly bad.

Others have mentioned it and I must too: The misplaced nonstop sex theme is as good a place to start as any. Let me make crystal clear that I'm about the farthest from a prude as you can get. I'm not squeamish or uncomfortable with sex scenes, if they make sense and are done well. The early scene with DeNiro performing cunnlingus in the kitchen makes me weep for the film industry. Compare this to, say, the kitchen sex scene in ""Postman Always Rings Twice."" I get it, this one is played for humor, but come on. The dialogue is beyond stupid and totally unfunny. I don't know any woman of any age who would be legitimately turned on by this kind of talk, which is not witty banter at all, it's just dumb. Some women do love a funny man and find wit arousing. This is not wit.

My guess is that because these actors are ""of a certain age"" the idea was to prove that they're still sexual, they've still got it, whatever. But when their sex lives are played for bad jokes throughout the film, instead it's like the producers lacked the courage to show us scenes that are actually sexy and stimulating. They default to the sophomoric humor, which to my eyes suggests just the opposite of what they may have been hoping to prove. Instead of showing us older people who still enjoy good sex, we get jokes. Maybe the producers aren't as comfortable with older people having realistic sex as they are with playing such scenarios for jokes. It's just more stereotypical grandma-sex jokes (""nobody wants to see that!""), but with a Hollywood budget.

The storyline about a virginous young man (not THAT young, which itself stretches credibility) and someone's determination to make sure he's no longer a virgin by such and such time has been done to death. I've yet to see any such storyline that was not a cringefest.

I know these actors and filmmakers all have families to support and most of them are well established enough for their awesome past work that maybe they feel entitled to just say screw the audience, I'm taking this paycheck. Guess that is their right. But it is a huge disappointment.

Lastly, a caveat: I stopped watching 20 minutes before the end, and I rarely do not finish a film, even one that's not very good. I guess there's a chance something happened in the last 20 minutes that would have me writing a completely different review. But I doubt it.",1424390400,13,2579,4.490405117270789

4783498,1,B005LAIIB2,"This film is about a family brought together for a weekend wedding. The description calls them ""a charming modern family"" and if this is what ""charming"" or ""modern"" looks like, I want nothing to do with it. How such talented A-List actors agreed to such a debasement of language or character is beyond me. The description continues that the ""celebration has the potential to become a full blown fiasco"". The only fiasco in this film is the cheapened degradation and perversion of their communication. I was shocked to see the camera angle of De Niro's face right between Susan Sarandon's legs within the first few minutes of the film and it just continued downhill from there with each character being cruder and shallower than the next. Did I really hear Robert De Niro call his ex-wife, played by Diane Keaton a c*nt? Does the son really attack his mother for ""c*ck-blocking"" his efforts with his step-sister who just about rapes him after he professes to be saving himself for marriage and is a 30 year old virgin and she comes to sleep with the first American she encounters? But it does not end there, the film gets more vulgar and repulsive as it goes on. These ""parents"" are grossly disrespectful, set a horrific example for their children and simply have no class. They may live in a huge house, they may have sent their son to Harvard and they may pretend to be intellectuals, but they behave and speak like uneducated, self-gratifying, immoral ""white trash"".

I was shocked at how the description made the decent Colombian woman an ""ultraconservative biological mother"" and found their take on the Latino characters racially stereotypical. The bride's parents are afraid of ""tan-colored grandkids""? What an insulting and racist display. I am not religious, but found the scenes with Robin Williams in complete disrespect for religion or the church. I found the humor vulgar and crude. I found the jokes insulting and subverted and the overall theme with a complete lack of respect and disregard for the sanctity of family disgusting. Have these actors grown so desperate for work that they actually commit themselves to film, filling some cinematic archives forever with themselves portraying such rubbish? Where are their artistic ethics? Where is their personal integrity? What a waste of flm. What a waste of talent. What a complete waste of energy and the capabilities these actors normally possess. I'm not a prude and I love these actors and even these family get-together style comedies - but this went way over the top and made me feel deep sadness for the state of language, character, morals or values in this country. It is an exhibit in how to kill that art of film-making and cinema. When I remember how brilliant Keaton and De Niro were in films like The Godfather II, Marvin's Room and that they are Oscar winning talents and then I see am in this I am severely disappointed, on so many levels.

I found absolutely no redeeming value to any part of this film except that it reminded me that the Hollywood of today has absolutely no respect for any moral or religious values and that while serious films struggle to be made and heart warming stories long to be told, that money is wasted on such idiotic, foolish and insulting drivel. There is no hope in this movie and it left me feeling sad that stories no longer convey redemption, transformation and growth. Shame on all of you for participating in such an example of everything that is wrong with society today and trying to pass it off as a family film.",1422144000,,3533,4.780687397708674

4783633,1,B005LAIIB2,"Wow, this great ensemble cast and such a crap script!  I knew in the first five minutes when DeNiro is about to perform oral sex on his live-in girlfriend on the kitchen counter (Rated R?  Really?  Try X) that it was going to be awful, but since it didn't actually ""consummate"" and the scene changed, I thought I would wait and see.  I should have known better.  There was no redeeming value to any of this movie, except to remind us that - once again - Hollywood has no respect for any moral or religious values.  I know, I know, it's intended to be a comedy, and that's what comedies do: they mock pretty much everything to try to make us laugh.  This movie was not successful in making me laugh, but they did mock successfully.  It makes me sad to see such terrific stars sink to this kind of nonsense.",1420588800,2,805,4.28476821192053

4783797,3,B005LAIIB2,"This movie should have been good, but its merely okay.  It is filled with well-known actors, but the plot was way too predictable and the potential for comedy never really lived up to that potential.  Its really a shame, but this movie isn't worth watching more than once and, even then, it plodded along too much and threw in too many well-used wedding jokes that weve all seen time and again.  The acting may have been good, but even good actors cant do much with an old rerun of a plot.

Alejandro was adopted by an American couple, Don and Ellie, and now he and their other kids are all grown up and have grown up problems.  Alejandra meets the girl of his dreams and this is their Big Wedding, for which his biological mother and sister plan to attend.  Problem is, he never told them that his American parents got divorced and his adopted dad is now living with another woman.  As his mother speaks no English, they decide to hide the truth from her and Don and Ellie have to pretend they are still happily wed.  Craziness ensues, set against the backdrop of dinners with the parents, doing the pre-marital meetings with the local Catholic priest (sadly underplayed by Robin Williams, who is so much better than this minor role) and prepping for the grand event.

The humor at times is sexual and rude and the characters are cardboard, especially the mother and father of the bride.  Muffin is the mother of the bride and she and her husbands dismay at having their daughter marry a Latino is supposed to be presented as funny, but it comes across as uncomfortable and aimed for a cheap laugh that it misses entirely.  Everyone forgives each other way too easily, they all couple up for the final dance, and its all tied up neatly in the end.
If you enjoy wedding movies, you might like this one once.  But Id recommend My Big Fat Greek Wedding as being worlds away better than this, despite its big cast of known actors.",1420416000,,1927,4.489971346704871

4786578,4,B005LAIIB2,"There is virtually no nudity in this film.  Nor is there violence, so I have to assume the R rating is purely based on periodically explicit language and implied sexual situations, particularly coming from Robert de Niro.
De Niro plays a seemingly endlessly self-centered, successful businessman and skirt chaser.  The setting for the movie is the wedding of his adopted son Arturo, from South America, with the daughter of another well-to-do but superficial set of parents.  Complications abound as De Niros first wife [played by Diane Keaton] shows up for the wedding.  We soon learn that De Niro cheated on her with her best friend [played by Susan Sarandon], with whom hes been living ever since.  Then the biological kids of De Niro and Keaton arrive, and they all have their own personal axes to grind: with each other as well as with their parents.  Just to top it off, Arturos real mother shows up from South America.  Since shes a strict Catholic and Arturo had led her to believe that De Niro and Keaton had never been divorced, he persuades the two of them to pretend they are still married, so as not to shock and disappoint his mother.  Sarandon, not surprisingly miffed at the situation, drives off to stay at a hotel until the wedding is over, but keeps showing up as head-caterer, deliberately to annoy both De Niro and Keaton.
The movie isn't as funny as it could have been, and it is more serious than expected.  De Niro ends up a more human character than he appears at first, Keaton and Sarandon have some interesting conversations, the lawyer-daughter who just broke up with her boyfriend in Chicago finds out shes pregnant by himin short, imagine the Sarah Palin family set in Hollywood, and this is perhaps what you might get.  Oh it has added sentimental value as Robin Williams plays the Catholic priest for the wedding ceremony.  I cant think of a more believable character to play a Catholic priest. Reasonably amusing and interesting if you keep your expectations low.",1415491200,,1996,4.773255813953488

4787236,3,B005LAIIB2,"Alejandro (Ben Barnes) is the adopted son of Don (Robert De Niro) and Ellie (Diane Keaton), a divorced couple. They are divorced because, years before, Ellie caught Don cheating on her with her best friend Bebe (Susan Sarandon), a woman he has been living with ever since Ellie left. Bebe helped to raise the couple's children - Alejandro, his brother Jared (Topher Grace from That 70s Show) and his sister Lyla (Katherine Heigl).

Are you confused yet?

Alejandro is engaged to the love of his life, Missy (Amanda Seyfried) and the two of them are preparing for their wedding. The trouble is, Alejandro's birth mother, Madonna (Patricia Rae) is coming to the wedding, traveling all the way from Columbia. Not only is she a strict Catholic, she does not believe in divorce, and she has no idea that Don and Ellie are divorced. To a normal person, this might seem like the perfect time to be honest. But instead, this family decides that Don and Ellie simply must pretend to be married, leaving Bebe hurt and angry as she moves out of her home to stay in a hotel.

Of course, she doesn't really stay away and many misunderstandings, mistakes, and antics ensue - many of which help this movie to earn its R rating. The sexual humor is very prevalent at times, and this movie is definitely not intended for a young audience. Even I might have been uncomfortable allowing my children to see this when they were younger, and I was never one to limit their viewing all that much.

I had never heard of this movie before I discovered it recently. With an all-star cast filled with actors that I adore (including Robin Williams as a priest), I couldn't understand why I had not heard of it before.

Now I believe that the reason for that is that it just wasn't all that noteworthy. It was okay. There were a few moments that had me laughing right out loud. The romance between the young couple is quite lovely and there is quite a bit of important ""sorting out"" of emotions that go on between Don, Ellie, and Bebe. I did enjoy it, for the most part.

But, I also expected more from a cast like this. I felt like the writing fell a little short and there were times when I was rather confused about what was going on and what had transpired in the past. With so many characters interacting in such a rapid-fire manner, it was a bit hard to follow at times. The actors did the best they could with the material they had to work with, but they really deserved better writing. I liked it okay, but as much as I enjoy watching movies repeatedly, I don't know that I will be watching this one again.

If you love the actors in this movie, it might be worth seeing once. It was quite an amusing romp. Just make sure you put the little ones to bed first.",1413158400,,2738,4.420634920634921

Corny light hearted musical cues so you know the characters are being light-hearted and when to laugh.  A ridiculously corny plot full of adults behaving badly. *Spoiler alert* A woman vomits, must be pregnant, right?  The groom's columbian birth sister shows up and his adoptive brother is a virgin.  Wonder what happens next?  So many big names, but with a script like this it's hard to pull off.  Also as an aside, the parents of the bride are racist and don't want their grand kids to be 'beige' (not 'brown' mind you).  Alejandro, the adopted son and groom is as pale as everyone in the movie.  In fact, if they didn't tell you he was Columbian, you probably wouldn't have realized that he is hispanic.  Apparently it's funny for people to be racist against Latinos.  *Sigh*  I would say I expect more from you Hollywood, but...",1411862400,4,931,4.6503067484662575

4788890,4,B005LAIIB2,"I was looking for a romantic comedy to watch with my wife. I thought this move would fit the bill. In some ways it did, but it was geared more towards the comedy side of things.

First and foremost, the case is packed with talent. Robert Deniro, Robin Williams (RIP), Topher Grace, Katherine Heigl, Susan Surandon, Amanda Seyfried, and others!

This movie features those awkward family conversations you do not want to have in the first place. One way or another, they all happen during the absolute worst times, in public no less. Here are a few examples:

Father (Deniro)- Had sex with his ex-wife and broke the news to his long time girlfriend at his adopted son's wedding. To make matters worse, all of the wedding guests overheard the conversation, along with his adult children.

Alejandro (adopted son)- Lied to his fiance, telling her his parents were married, even though they've been divorced for over a decade. This causes a lot of frustration and angst within the family, especially the ""stepmother"" and adopted son.

Other son (Grace)- A 29 year old virgin who simply hasn't found the right girl yet. As it turns out, the right girl is the sister of his adopted brother. Basically, while his adopted brother is getting married, or immediately after I forget, Grace is sleeping with his sister.

All sorts of quirky family moments like these are more are present in this movie. Sure it is fairly sexually charged and at some points vulgar, but it is much better than many of the reviews suggest.",1410220800,,1507,4.754789272030651

Guess what happens?  The beautiful Columbian woman he meets in the first 10 minutes of the movie?  Can you guess what happens? Katherine Heigl is nauseated at even the sight of a baby in the first scene?  Minutes later she throws up on her dad.  Hmm...what might be going on there?  That Christian couple where the wife looks like a poor man's Dolly Parton?  Guess what?  They're the bad guys (although they are redeemed when it's revealed that the husband cheats and the wife is a lesbian).  That priest played by Robin Williams?  What could they possibly be up to with that casting decision?

And finally, the devout Catholic woman from Columbia for whom the whole farce is staged?  Well I don't want to spoil everything.  See if you can guess whether her faith in Christ is affirmed in the end, or whether she will move in the direction of the ""modern family.""",1407974400,,1031,4.587912087912088

4791891,1,B005LAIIB2,"Liberal family mocks God, a church, monogamy, morality, and Christians as one of their kids gets married.

The typical liberal ""family"" ""comedy"". These people are crass. They are ignorant. Closed minded. And insult anyone that they judge to be ""inferior"". But they are ""cool"". The ""conservative"" soon to be in-law's are ""racist"", ""adulterers"", ""tax cheats"" and ""closeted lesbians"", of course. The ""priest"" is a 3rd time AA graduate. And while I think the Catholic church is every bit of a cult as most of these Christian bigots make them out to be, not all Christians are Catholics. But Hollywood wouldn't have much to show if they didn't show the pomp and circumstance of the Catholic church etc. Anyway, the ""conservative"" hispanic mother actually is a ""hypocrite"" Christian we learn in the end. The ""conservative"" hispanic daughter is a slut until the ""feminist"" gives a ""feminist talk"" telling her basically that she should make a guy work for her ""love"" (since when did feminists start preaching 'waiting' and supplanting morality????). The ""virgin"" brother isn't married or a virgin at the end of the movie but is definitely the butt of a lot of jokes while being celibate. The father has an affair with his children's mother's best friend to end their marriage we learn. But then he has an affair with his ex-wife to almost ruin his no-yet-married relationship with his former adulterer. Of course she is so ""intelligent"" she forgives hin in . . . oh 20 seconds. And all is forgotten. Umm . . . you have the hispanics . . . but of course not the illegal kind . . . the ""adopted kind"". And they are the salt of the earth. Even Harvard graduates.

You'll know this movie for what it is from the very beginning scene of Sarandon and DeNiro on the kitchen counter. Nothing like seeing an 80 year old with legs apart to receive oral sex and then standing ""embarrassed"" with her panties down around her ankles. But at least they matched her suit.

WHile this movie reminds me of the liberal vomit train wreck of ""The Family Stone"" I actually stopped for a minute after watching this movie. Again, I was not surprised, amused, angered, saddened or shocked. I just was thinking what spoiled losers. But I was also thinking are the writers trying to elevate the radical people as role models to emulate? Or are they actually debasing these clowns by showing them as they are: a life disaster. I actually can't tell. But even if the motive was the later I still wouldn't recommend this profanity.

And the actors . . . they love for us to fawn all over their every dress, hair style and appearance choice, right? Well here goes. Susan Sarandon sounded more squeeky and nasal than she normally does. But it wasn't really that. It was something else. By the catering tent scene I figured it out. It took me that long as they really didn't show her close up for more than . . . oh 2 milliseconds up to that point. She is old. She has that old person's voice where they can't really talk. Where they can't really pronounce their words. Their speech comes out like someone speaking with a very dry mouth. And when they showed her up close they showed all that make up on that old face. She is just old. Of course DeNiro is back in his fat sloby old man look. He seems to vacillate between looking fit and looking like he did in this movie--gross. Diane Keaton is still stumbling around touching everything while mumbling. She manages to pass that off as acting. At least she didn't have a damn turtleneck on or some man's tie. Ms Heigel. Poor Ms Heigel. I always liked you in your other movies despite the pile on of late. But in this movie you looked horrible. That hair emphasized that bulbous nose of yours surrounded by the puffy face. Don't know what was going on there. But the ""tough I don't give a crap about anything or anyone liberal"" lines didn't help detract from her awful appearance. And the ""hispanic"" son. I couldn't figure out what was going on with his face. His eyes. His teeth. His skin. It appears that they put some cake makeup on him to ""hispanic"" him up a little for this role. An those teeth looked like dentures. And his eyes were just creepy. Reminds me of those distorted online pictures you can make of yourself with web cam software. Weird.

So yeah just skip the liberal mind garbage.",1406851200,12,4307,4.573834196891192

4794022,1,B005LAIIB2,"Yikes! I just now realized I watched this film 4 days ago before reviewing it. That must tell you how important the film was to me. Not a bit. This film definitely takes a spot on my ever changing Top 10 Worst films of 2013 list. And not even at the bottom, it's got one of the top five spots. Nothing about this movie was good. But I should have guessed this would have been the case from two warnings I received. First off we have the large change of release dates from October 2012 to April 2013. I would normally shrug this off, as post production trouble, or marketing strategy, but the film was already receiving ads on television marking the October date when it was moved. I then began to fear that the study was trying to rid the film, as they were worried it was going to fail. The next warning was the ensemble cast tag that spread across the trailers and posters. I hate ensembles. I wanna like them, but I usually don't. Some work (Expendables, at least for the most part) and most don't (Valentine's Day, Movie 43, New Years Eve, etc). The point is, from the beginning I knew the film wasn't going to be good, or evening ok. But I never thought once that it would be this bad. But it was. Onto my review of The Big Wedding.

In 'The Big Wedding' long divorced couple Don and Ellie Griffin (Robert De Niro and Diana Keaton) are once again forced to play the happy couple for the sake of their adopted son's wedding after his biological mother comes to attend the wedding.

Let me talk about the script. The script is complete garbage. The script reads like a how-to manual, but just the first draft of that how-to manual. The writers swung out with supposed jokes, but each missed the impact and fell helplessly into the dark abyssal of which this film is. The film try's to be funny, and act as a romantic dramedy but the drama and the comedy is stale and tasteless and nothing seems to work here. Of course there isn't much materiel to work with. The script basically reads as follows 'Please insert 10 stars and have them do all sorts of random things, oh and also end the film with a wedding'. Yes, that is how the film acts. The script, makes little sense, and is very brainless as to what would really go on in those situations. I know they make the things different to be funny, but it's not, it isn't. The script just isn't funny whatsoever.

And ofcourse we get those weird lines, as if the script wasn't already hard enough to swallow, we have to gauge down those completely ridicules lines. The dialogue is cheesy, weird, awkward, and self-centered at times. Not to mention the lines laid out by the priest, that come out offensive.

The characters are beyond unlikable, it's unbelievable. What I'm saying is that you'd think with such a solid ensemble of a cast that the characters would at least be likable and relatable, but they're not. Best examples of this are Topher Grace's and Robert De Niro's characters. What's wrong with these guys is that they were probably meant to be nice guys, but they aren't. Grace's character is a weird, stalker like, sex obsesser, not to mention acts like he's going to rape the girl he wants to have at it with. De Niro's character on the other hand is just a clean old jerk. He is supposed to love Susan Sarandon's character a lot, but sleeps with his ex? And then when confronted about it shrugs it off and acts like it was no biggy. And all this time the viewer is left thinking 'That schmock'. I mean how bad can you character's be? Not to mention Seyfried's parents in the film. Those to have some major issues, but it's not so bad, because they were written out as jerks, but De Niro and Grace's characters weren't. That's what makes them bad.

The film is highly lazy. When it gets a chance to take a wildcard, it doesn't. That's what makes the film so predictable. Nothing we watch in this film is anything but what we saw already before in the last rom-com Katherine Heigl starred in. Plot twists or so they call them, are predicted well before we are informed on film of their existence. Not that it would have made any difference if we weren't aware of them; they aren't of any spectacular mind blowing 'I did not see that coming' ness. Stale, stale, stale, stale, stale.

It's a shame how bad this film was. It spoiled the overly talented cast. Well all except for, say Katherine Heigl, and Robin Williams whose careers are already in the bag by now. Actually Heigl's career never even got out of the bag, and that's not very good. But who I'm saying was spoiled here were Robert De Niro, Susan Sarandon, Diana Keaton, and Topher Grace. Actors and Actresses who still had a career. Well, they've all just about lost it, with this.

The film's pace is pretty quick, with the films runtime being an hour and 40 minutes, the film breezes by and when we get to the film's ending it feels like a half an hour special. It helps make this film somewhat easier to sit through, but I felt it doesn't work with plot movie, it just skips around really, and it doesn't help but it doesn't exactly hurt the film.

All and All the film is overly predictable, and spoils the talented cast with a script that is unfunny, and whose characters are unlikable. F 3/15/14",1404691200,,5225,4.424116424116424

It just shows that how desperate this people are. They sign up to make money to do anything.  Where are all the great movies that made Hollywood? Lately it's all about ""let's make money fast,"" instead of honoring the art of movie making. I would give a no star rating if it would be possible.

Misunderstandings abound and the viewer finds out that everyone in the family has sexual secrets. One son is a thirty year-old virgin, the daughter is pregnant and the baby's father doesn't know, all three of the lead actors have all committed adultery and the mother of the bride confesses she is bisexual. In the end all these revelations are resolved and the feuding family members reconciled.

4795895,1,B005LAIIB2,"I thought it was OK: it gave me the happy ending, pick-me-up I was looking for, but failed to inspire my towards greater religiosity.  The portrayal of Catholics as hypocritical drunkards who are infatuated with rigid hierarchy is unfair.  Moreover, it is unethical and unrealistic to portray an incestuous, age heterogamous, sexual relationship on screen.  This upstanding, young, ob/gyn doctor pledged his virginity at the start of the movie, and his step-sister, nine years his junior, took advantage of him.  She basically raped him, forcing him to engage in acts he was not ready for, and would be happier saving for marriage.  How is this sending the right message to our young women?  Women have no right forcing men to engage in acts they would rather save for their wedding night.  I don't see how rape and coercion are romantic in the slightest.  She is sending the wrong message at every turn, by her clothing choices, and habits.  The parents aren't much better: they're all sleeping amongst themselves, and seem to send the message that open marriages are somehow OK.  I wish these people would understand that the true heroes in our world are those who engage in true monogamy for life, not serial monogamy.

It'd be nice if these bigshot, Los Angeles screenwriters could come up with something more wholesome.  Why they couldn't make a film about a nice, wholesome courtship, where two pure people commit their lives to each other?  Why do these people have so much family drama?  Why does everything have to be about infidelity, incest, and sex?  How am I supposed to daydream about my own perfect marriage and perfect wedding if all I see are images of depressing unions between imperfect people?  Why can't we have images of perfect people, so we can aspire to be more like them?  Is it too much to ask for better role models in our romantic comedies? I shouldn't have to turn to the Bible for my only source of inspiration.  I wish these screenwriter fat cats could go back to the clean romantic comedy era, a time when men like Cary Grant actually courted women like Katharine Hepburn.  Where is the romance?  Where is the true love?  Gone, along with our last shreds of propriety.

Thank you, Women's Liberation, for destroying my ability to daydream about my perfect, future husband, my perfect, future marriage, and my perfect, future wedding ceremony.",1402099200,4,2375,4.841191066997519

Dad's long-time, live-in girl friend gets angry and moves out.  And thus begins the three-ring circus of this dis-functional family.  It's not a bad movie.

This was a feel good movie that I think would be enjoyed by both men and women.  I can't say too much more due to the fact that I would give away the story line.

And boy, did I want to, I heard over and over from friends that it wasn't good, but I wanted to see for myself. But still, no. Two Notes:

A huge fan of Topher Grace, he played Eric Forman straight here. There was hardly a difference between his That's 70's Show character and this one.
Katherine Heigl saved the movie by being her brilliant self, her scene with Robert De Niro toward the end was this film's only saving grace.

Yet, every character seems to think the story is focused on them (that is--except for Topher Grace (That 70's Show) who seemed to have read the script, noticed it was a comedy and did a fine job carrying this out).

Why current day movies think they need to interject gross (vomiting on others) or meant to shock (""cunni"" in opening scenes) to engage the viewer is beyond me.  I immediately  think ""uh,oh, desperate, no plot"" when that happens.  I am a DeNiro, Sarandon, Keating fan and they REALLY deserve much better material.  Heigl and Seyfried are Wasted here...maybe they really looked forward to working with the others, don't blame them.  I thought Robin Williams character had some fun with it.  Pretty much implausible fluff with a plot that's been Done, done, done. ... so I think dun, dun, dun, apparently.",1400544000,,632,4.961904761904762

4797875,3,B005LAIIB2,I was intrigued by the cast list but they have all made better movies.  I had to watch this over two days and only returned  as I like the cast and hoped it would improve.  If I had been in a theatre  I would have left.  I am sure it is just me but I found it excruciating and banal in parts.  The three stars are for the quality cast and scenery.

4797940,4,B005LAIIB2,Robin Williams makes an outrageous priest. A lot of light humor of the type we need in this so serious world. Enjoyable,1400371200,,119,4.454545454545454
4797941,1,B005LAIIB2,"Hey, maybe the last 79 minutes are funny, but I couldn't make it past the first 10.  In the first scene you are confronted with disgusting sexual ""humor"" and then you come to Robin Williams as a Catholic priest.  Mocking the Catholic Church is a cheap way to get a laugh.  Not clever.  No wonder it made it to ""free"" video so quickly.  Don't waste your time.",1400371200,,358,4.2835820895522385

4797944,1,B005LAIIB2,"What would happen if you took every out of work movie actor over 60 and tried to make a romantic dramady? Nothing good and this movie is proof of that. The deepest thing about this movie is the lens filter that attempts to make Sarandon and Keaton look eternally
young. This film is an obvious attempt to draw on the sentimentality of the baby boomer generation and as a boomer, I would like to say, we're not all that shallow.",1400284800,,427,4.35

It took a little while for me to understand the relationship between Susan Sarandon, Robert DeNiro and Diane Keaton, but once I got it I could really relate to their situation! Diane Keaton was great when she first entered the movie and reacted to a home she no longer lived in, but had built. Everyone was so natural... Loved the diversity of personalities. I was drawn to the movie because it is a comedy and all of the wonderful actors. I've actually watched it three times.",1400284800,,593,4.5514018691588785

I guess it just doesn't have much depth.  Nothing wrong with that, it's a comedy and that's what it is.  Enjoyed it and would recommend it for light humorous viewing any time.

4798402,3,B005LAIIB2,"The plot of The Big Wedding shows promise as a twist on the chick flick genre, with an all star cast and a humorous take on the ""father of the bride"" sub-genre. Trailers that promise laughs and wit are really highlight reels, with all the best material shoved into them. We are left with a movie that is a relatively pleasant distraction, but not particularly funny, engaging, or clever. Supporting cast members Topher Grace, Amanda Seyfried, and Katherine Heigel are just bland. The aforementioned Oscar winners, Diane Keaton, Susan Sarandon, Robert DeNiro, and Robin Williams, all appear to be acting with both hands tied behind their backs. The plot is just too weak, and the directing even weaker, for these mega-talents to get anything going. The film does have the feel-good quality one looks for in this genre, and the relationship between Keaton and Sarandon's characters proves interesting. But overall, the film has far too few laughs and far too many undeveloped characters. I'll forget this one before the week is over.",1399939200,,1031,5.0

Well, this is that kind of movie. I'm sorry I watched the whole thing though, and I felt like a needed to take a shower after. When grown adults are so selfish and immature to be ruled by nothing more than savage sexual instincts and throw all self-restraint and moral conviction out the window.... It's not comical to me, it's disgusting- and disappointing! But if vulgar, sexual humor is your kind of humor, I'm sure you'd get a good laugh out of this movie.

It does have an interesting storyline for the most part, and for a person who hasn't been able to watch movies for 4-months due to tons of schoolwork, I would know if this movie sucked.

Don't look for a movie like 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' here. The acting appears forced, and there is absolutely no chemistry between any of the actors.  All this is a movie about every main character having some sort of sexual problem, hangup or fetish.  The wedding was nothing more than an after thought thrown in there so that they all had a reason to come together and spit out this stupid story.

The only character that didn't have a sexual hangup was the Catholic Priest (Robin Williams).  However, he had a drunken past, so he was no angel, either.  He tries to pass himself off as a strict Catholic, performing marriages by the book.  Yet, at the end of the movie, he performs a second, spur-of-the-second marriage knowing that one of them was divorced.  That's a no-no in the Catholic faith.  Who researched this stuff?

The only reason I give this movie two stars is because there were a few humorous one-liners that almost forced a chuckle.  Other than that, this movie wasn't worth watching even though I got it free (through Prime)",1399334400,,1278,4.606194690265487

I feel as if it falls into the okay range.  There were parts that were humorous, some that were a bit too silly for my taste, and others that were moderately entertaining.  It was definitely watchableI made it through the entire film.  It just wasn't all that memorable.  Feel free to check it out to judge for yourself.

4800769,3,B005LAIIB2,"This movie has a lot of high power name stars in it, but the movie itself is just a rather ordinary little comedy that doesn't quite pack it. It's okay, but I sure wouldn't want to pay anything for it. It's not even funny. I did get a couple of laughs out of it, but sure not enough. Okay to watch free for sheer entertainment, not worth any money to see.",1398643200,,355,4.014084507042254

4801110,3,B005LAIIB2,This is fairly weak story line.  The movie has a number of top stars but the story just isn't there.  I watched it about a week ago and when the notice came up to review it I couldn't remember one thing about it until I studied the photo.  It adequately passed a quiet evening and that is about all I can say.,1398470400,,309,3.9516129032258065

One comment was it's cast being older so us old facts would like it but did they forget all the ""kids"". They were gathered for  The Big Wedding. I saw this when 1st came out in theater for a benefit for autism.  A wide variety of women all laughing beginning to end.  I purchased did & my husband enjoyed it too. I just watched it again while waiting f or my husband to come out of back surgery & found myself chuckling again. So I give it high marks. My best friends do also",1398470400,,566,4.035714285714286

4801243,3,B005LAIIB2,I watched this through the free Amazon Prime Video deal set up here; this isn't a movie I would pay to see.  I often like movies about wedding for some reason.  The storyline here is a bit ridiculous and seems to be punctuated by lots of couples sneaking off to have loud sex. I was working in my kitchen and found this entertaining enough so that the work didn't seem like drudgery.,1398470400,,383,4.305555555555555

4801435,2,B005LAIIB2,"I had some issues with this movie. The beginning of the film has an appalling lack of exposition, keeping you confused until well into the movie about who is related to whom (likely poor editing). It is certainly very raunchy and the portrayal of Catholicism is fairly offensive (I'm not Catholic, but it's difficult to see anyone's religion treated this way). I'm okay with some irreverence and a bit of raunch but I think it should be (a) relevant to the story and (b) actually funny. In this movie, it was neither.
That being said, I won't totally poo poo the film as many have. I'd certainly be unhappy if I didn't get it free on Prime, but really, I expected it to be pretty much what it is: a silly, kind of vapid, clichd romantic comedy, that nonetheless is mildly entertaining--or at least distracting. I wanted something on in the background while I cleaned the kitchen, and this fit the bill. Honestly, it's just like a million other romantic comedies, but isn't that generally why people watch those kind of romantic comedies? Because they're comfortably familiar and don't require much investment from the viewer?",1398211200,,1125,4.774358974358974

4801675,1,B005LAIIB2,"I didn't even make it through the entire movie.  I got half way through and knew exactly what the rest of the movie would be.  It's not even funny or the least bit entertaining, although they work really hard for it to be a dramatic comedy, it's just plain stupid.

Really a 30 year old virgin that wants to lose his virginity, not for love, but to some horny foreign girl that seems only interested in sleeping with the first American guy she encounters while she is in the country.  She's not even that good looking or exotic.  REALLY?  Why did the character waste so many years avoiding sex with so many girls only to give up his virginity to this girl.  Totally lame!!

Then, you have the poor baby daughter that can't forgive her dad for cheating on her mom which ended with the divorce.  She is so busy pouting and feeling sorry for herself, she is simply annoying to watch.  Oh poor thing you left your husband and he hasn't called you WAH!  WAH!

I could go on with the other characters and their story lines, but it's not worth it to me.

I get the concept that dysfunctional families are suppose to be funny, but they made it so extreme and tried too hard to be funny.  The movie has great actors that one would think the movie would be bearable, but not for me.  I am so irritated that I wasted 45 minutes of my time watching what I did.  I'd pass this one up even with all the great actors in it.  Take my word.",1398211200,3,1423,4.211111111111111

The wonderful actors, Diane Keaton and Susan Sarandon in particular, are wasted.  The ""racial tension"" created by the screenwriter - the bumbling priest (curious mis-casting of Robin Williams) and the parents of the bride who are suspicious of the groom's South American background, even though they all have presumably known him most of his life, is faintly offensive.

Why  do we expect more than an average performance from Robin Williams, Susan Sarandon, Diane Keaton, and Robert DeNiro? Because they are extraordinary actors.

This was a very fast-paced, funny movie.  I suspect I may have to watch it again because there are times when hilarious lines are coming at you so fast you don't really catch them all.  Parts of this movie had me laughing so hard I had to pause it so I could breathe.

Sadly, it turns the characters and their family experiences into a big joke few people would find funny. No, it's not funny that the head of the family, Mr. Griffin, is cheating on his current ""partner"" with his ex-wife. It's not remotely believable that the former Mrs. Griffin could have gotten over her best friend sleeping with her husband and be happy about them now. It's not funny that Alejandro's biological sister is the usual stereotype of the over-sexual Hispanic woman who is dying to bed some white boy (just goes to show what kind of American male fantasies this movie is aiming for): in reality a lot of Hispanic women are more religious and sexually conservative than American women, but this reality the movie also represents very stereotypically and cynically. It's neither accurate nor funny that the priest would officiate a wedding between a divorced man and his former mistress while his first wife is still living: that simply would not happen. The movie is utterly tasteless. It could have aimed at being redemptive, but it's message seems to be ""yes, our marriages mean nothing to us and we all continue to betray each other, but that's ok so lets laugh.""",1397433600,,1295,4.864253393665158

From the trailers, you can tell that the basic premise is a ""fantastical"" idea - a divorced couple pretends to be married for the weekend to satisfy the birth mother of their adopted son; she is coming to their home for the first time to attend the son's wedding.  But the movie goes downhill quickly!

With the exception of Robin Williams character, every one else in the movie is a straight man, which means that the humor would neccesarily come from the script.  But it doesn't! Instead, the final scenes (no spoilers) epitomize what's wrong with the movie.  In the last 10 minutes, titilating details are revealed about the main characters that don't tie in to the story.  I guess the idea is how secrets can be revealed at large family gatherings...but these secrets don't make sense in the context of the movie and they aren't funny - just more ""fantastical"".

Great cast and most of them gave believable performances (not humurous performances) which is why I gave 2 stars rounding up from 1.5 stars.

The acting is mechanical, the characters are typical self-absorbed, dysfunctional, and misguided nitwits, and the ending was ridiculous.

Couple of chuckles here and there, but for the most part, the movie was completely predictable with cliched dialog.  The material was so bad, it made even the best actors come across as novices.  The main problem for me was that each character had a separate storyline (problem to resolve) associated with them which I suppose, in theory, was to be resolved by this time spent at the wedding; but not enough time was spent on any of the storylines, so for most of the movie you had the basics of the problem, but you weren't invested in it.  You didn't know what caused it or anything besides the problem existed.  Why was Jared a 30-year old virgin? Why was Lyla separated?  Why was Alejandro adopted?  What happened between Ellie & Bebe? Why did Don keep the house?  The list goes on and on... Not sure if I can recommend this movie at all.

4803320,1,B005LAIIB2,"I streamed this movie through Amazon Prime. Im glad it was part of my service and not something I paid for directly. I cant believe Hollywood still makes movies like this. It reminded me of the teenaged sex movies of the 1980s, only with adult prominent actors. When someone cheated on their spouse, nobody got hurt or angry because everyone else was cheating too. The movie glorified this.

The Big Wedding was also the most anti-Catholic, anti-morality movie I have ever seen. But heres the thing, if you're going to show the Catholic Church in a negative way, you should at least get it right. This movie was so inaccurate. Divorce is NOT a sin in the Catholic Church as this movie portrayed. Robin Williams played the priest and they show him performing a marriage ceremony outside. This would never happen. The Church only marries within the Church building. The director/writers don't even know Catholics, so how can they bash them for being a moral voice? In fact the only moral character in the movie is the grooms biological mom who is from South America. Even she is shown at the end to be immoral so the viewer can like her.

4803704,3,B005LAIIB2,"The Big Wedding stars Robert De Niro, Diane Keaton, Susan Sarandon and Robin Williams, plus Ben Barnes, Topher Grace, Katherine Heigl and Amanda Seyfried. With four Oscar-winners and a handful of young talented actors, you cannot make a bad movie. Well, actually, you can.

Perhaps the whole premise is too weak and contrived for us to really care. Because their adapted son Alejandros biological mother comes from Columbia to attend his wedding, a long-divorced couple Don (Robert De Niro) and Ellie (Diane Keaton) pretends that they are still married. But what if they fail? Alejandro (Ben Barnes) will marry his girlfriend Missy (Amanda Seyfried) anyway, so why should we care?

Womanizer Don has a new girlfriend Bebe (Susan Surandon), who happens to be, not surprisingly, Ellies best friend, but Bebe is upset to know that she has to spend a few days at hotel. In the meanwhile we meet Don and Ellies children Jared (Topher Grace) and Lyla (Katherine Heigl), and the latter seems unhappy these days because of her recent relationship problems. Robin Williams virtually reprises the role in License to Wed. None of the character arc is interesting.

The Big Wedding is the kind of film where you feel there is something wrong with the movie but cannot pinpoint it exactly. The film is full of jokes, largely about sex. Some of them are mildly amusing, but even the better part of them is delivered awkwardly. I sort of liked the dry humor found in the dialogue, even though it lacks bite. The Big Wedding doesnt know what it wants to be, a feel-good comedy or satire or something else.

The fact that the film was actually a remake of 2006 French/Swiss film Mon frre se marie may have something to do with the result. I don't know. By the time the film is half over, I lost interest anyway.",1386547200,,1794,4.740384615384615

To address some other reviewers' complaints, yes, at least theoretically it opens with a scene of oral sex. Absolutely nothing is shown. It's a comedy scene, completely tasteful.

Foul language? Well, a few bad words here and there in appropriate scenarios, nothing pervasive or overwhelming.

Lots of family dysfunction, yeah, that's what the comedy's all about.

Umm yeah maybe the ending is a little pie in the sky but hey it's a movie! It's for fun! Maybe it's a good thing to have examples about how we all might kiss and make up instead of all the revenge and hatred in the world.

What do you say about a movie that sports four Oscar winners in the cast and the best performance is turned in by Topher Grace?  I know these endeavors are formula but this exercise is so cynical as to almost have contempt for its audience.  You'll be hard pressed to find any likable characters on display.  For the first eighty minutes there's longstanding familial dysfunction, unspoken agendas and resentments present and in the final ten minutes all troubles are resolved wrapped like a present with a big fat bow.

Story centered around a family coming together for a wedding and family tensions and issues that are part of that family's life. Solid acting, Mr. DeNiro played an imperfect but loving father.

4804872,4,B005LAIIB2,"It's funny how Hollywood loves making wedding films ever since,'A Wedding' with Carol Burnett.  Yet, every decade they make one, and the Big Wedding's no exception.  Essentially, the story is about a family's adopted son getting married, but the catch is he's Catholic and hasn't told his biological mother that his adopted parents (DeNiro and Keaton) have been divorced for several years.  Not to mention that the father is now with another woman (Sarandon).  Meanwhile Katherine Heigl stars as the sister who's having martial problems due to the fact she can't have kids, and Topher Grace as her brother who's a single doctor and has remained a virgin for years.

(Note:  This is the second time Heigl has starred with a former 'That's 70s Show' cast member.)

Anyway, the hijinks also ensue briefly with Robin Williams as the priest, but here he's a bit underused than what his was as 'Reverend Fred' in 'Licensed to Wed.'  But it focuses more with the adopted son, Alejandro, keeping things under wraps for his mother's sake.  Whereas his biological sister develops an attraction for Topher's character.

For what it's worth, 'The Big Wedding's' not a bad film, it just gets lost a bit at times in the transition with all the stars attempting to make the film work, but the movie does end on a good note.  Overall, this is a good film if you're looking for a light romantic comedy.",1379808000,,1385,4.777310924369748

4804962,1,B005LAIIB2,"I watched this movie one weekend when I was bored. It was good for killing the time, but that's about it.

I think of this movie as ""Rich Folk Have Problems"".  Why? Because they have to worry about their image to their neighbors, their country club, their church, and...well that about covers it. If only they were more willing to simply communicate truth and not be so stuck up in each other's butts, maybe they could have had a much less dramatic wedding weekend. It feels like this movie exists solely because nobody could tell anybody the truth about anything. I guess the humor was supposed to be in the awkward situations created by lies and half-truths, but sorry, I did not find the humor and I can only feel so much pity for characters in a movie who have their own boat dock in their backyard.

Everything about this movie is terribly predictable. Everything.
Some of the humor is awkward and awkwardly delivered.
It's all kind of cliche.
It was grossly and unnecessarily raunchy, but I'm sure that some 13 year old boy will love to watch this when he find it on HBO  someday.",1379548800,,1086,4.525510204081633

4805758,4,B005LAIIB2,"Big Wedding, recently released on DVD, explores a fresh take on the modern family. The film is set around the wedding day of the adopted son of a divorced couple who had two other children and the adoption prior to separating. While the comedy stays present through the movie, there is also a strong presence of realistic troubles that tug at the audience's heartstrings. Big Wedding does an impressively in-depth portrayal of modern problems in diverse families.
The story follows each character of the family's lives and the different struggles they face while preparing for one of the member's weddings. The cast does not disappoint, even including Robin Williams as an alcoholic priest. Through focusing on the struggles of different ages of life through different characters, the movie hits close to home for a wider range of audience members.
  Before the film came out, audiences were already hyped for its all-star cast. The wide-ranged ensemble included Robert De Niro, Diane Keaton, Katherine Heigl, Topher Grace, Amanda Seyfriend, Ben Barnes, and Susan Sarandon alongside Robin Williams. While the names may look a little odd with each other, each actor and actress flowed together effortlessly into a genuine and natural family atmosphere. The screenplay writer and director, Justin Zackham, created a realistic and humorous adaptation of what a happy family life can look like--even with dysfunctional elements.
  Big Wedding was surprisingly impactful for the amount of comedy present throughout the film. It also broke the mold on the typical Hollywood movie. While many films focus on the hate brought from divorce and skirt around addressing serious complex issues, Big Wedding took a completely new angle and style. It shows that not every couple hates each other after divorce and each character has flaws that are relatable. The movie did an amazing job at providing a bilingual aspect that added to both the emotion and the comedy. There was some dialogue in Spanish throughout the film, with one character unable to speak any other language.
  Because the son getting married is adopted, he has a biological family visiting for his wedding that is strictly Catholic, just like his fiance's parents. In order to appease his mother and sister's traditions, he convinces his adopted parents to pretend to still be married to gain the birth mother's acceptance.
The movie received bad reviews after its debut in theaters. Many critics complained that the script was too strained, and that it made too many ridiculous attempts for laughs. While I agree that at times obvious jokes can be unsuccessful, the film did provide a flowing comedy based on realistic dialogue. The only problem in the film was that it occasionally lost track of some characters. Even so, the film had surprising subtle moments to tie up loose strings and help make connections.
Those who enjoy movies with large casts and realistic portrayals of important life events would enjoy Big Wedding. It has a similar feel to other movies such as Something's Gotta Give and It's Complicated. The more realistic dialogue provided a natural humor and genuine feel to the storyline and characters. While the plot got a bit ridiculous at time for comedy's sake, the overall intertwining of lives in a realistic modern family created a good film worth seeing.",1378166400,,3338,5.126838235294118

It has content that may be rated R or NC-17, but it isn't as shocking as the other reviewers portray. There is a beautiful story there, if you just let yourself see it. And it's funny here and there.

There's even a little nudity. And that's terrible because there are some funny moments buried in all the smut. I agree with L. Miller's comment, ""I think Hollywood needs to remember this! Waste of a terrific cast on a decent but unfulfilled premise with a few fun moments. There is a great market for GOOD movies for the older crowd, especially as we retire. But vulgarity instead of wit in an attempt to get cheap laughs is not it."" Some of us Generation X folks have actually moved on beyond puberty. I blame the writers because this could have been a decent comedy without all the vulgarity. There was so much wasted talent in this movie. The economy isn't great so maybe a lot of seasoned actors just need the extra money. I guess it's an easy buck. They certainly didn't have to put a lot of effort into their roles.

4806419,2,B005LAIIB2,"The big wedding is a movie about a long-divorced couple (De Niro and Keaton) who fakes being married as their family unites for a wedding.

I had high expectations for this movie considering the star power that it has in it, unfortunately the movie fails to live up to my expectations in terms of quality and comedy.  The movies laughs are few and far between and are mostly cringe worthy or slap your head worthy.  I mean the movie tries hard to be funny but the biggest problem is not the comedy but the fact that it has way too many stories going on at one time and seems to be lost in its own lack of direction.

Big Wedding tries to be a romantic comedy and probably succeed more in that respect that actually being a laugh out loud comedy of that which fails miserably.  Between the awkward oversexed cheating ex husband and the tension (or lack thereof) between him and the ex-wife and Bebe ( the best friend who cheated with the ex-husband, or the pregnant daughter who cant have a baby and doesn't know she is pregnant throughout the whole movie even though she throws up the whole time, or the virgin brother who gets the hots for the Columbian who doesn't know any inhibitions, or the Tammy Faye look alike who knows no tact, or the blah blah blah blah.

See what I mean...way too much going on in this movie with characters that seem to lack chemistry or have any cohesiveness that really compels to be believe the situation or the romance that is involved.

4806927,3,B005LAIIB2,"""The Big Wedding"" illustrates a growing problem with retail online streaming:  It's based on a French film about a Swiss family whose adopted Vietnamese son is getting married, yet we can't check out the original as Amazon's foreign collection is contracting at about the speed of America's mom and pop video stores.  Unless you want to buy a hard copy---and not a US playable version---for $53. you're out of luck.  Same for ""Tatie Danielle"".

In any event, the American version devolves to a single subject fairly quickly, and who would be surprised:  Sex.  It's all about sex.  Fortunately, unlike a Nora Ephron or Nancy Meyers work, we are spared the trauma of seeing an aging star naked.  That said, Diane Keaton seems to be reprising her ""Something's Gotta Give"" role, down to dressing from the same closet.

The nutshell version is that Allejandro,  the adopted, Colombian, Harvard Grad son, of an affluent east coast American family is getting married (Ken Barnes/Amanda Seyfried).  The families are coming to Allejandro's adopted home, for the wedding;  his adopted brother and sister;  his adopted mom (Diane Keaton) who divorced her husband, the Dad (Robert De Nero), who has spent much of the last decade living with his unmarried partner (Susan Sarandon), who is Keaton's best friend.  The in-laws---parents only---are also coming, and are the Evil Republicans.  Oh, and on the morning his mother and sister arrive from Colombia, Allejandro lets everybody know that, well, since he never thought they'd ever board a plane, he'd neglected to tell his conservative, Catholic, mom that his adoptive parents had divorced and the woman who'd raised him for much of the last decade, and who is sleeping with his ""dad"", isn't married to him.

So the original couple has to play married, and Susan Sarandon disappears for about five minutes, before returning as the caterer.

We've been down this road before in some pretty big and Classic films.  Everything works out in the end.

Being a modern film, there are some suggestions of a story that got left out, without being cleaned up for the final presentation.  At some point, Sarandon's pug dogs--which clearly were meant to play a key comic role---were written out, but the evidence of that story line was not fully erased from the film.  Allejandro's adoptive sister (Katherine Heigl) seems to suggest when telling her filandering dad that she got all of his genes, that her baby is not by the husband from whom she's separated, but that line doesn't go anywhere, either.

And eventually we get to the wedding, which goes off with only a minor hitch, but that would be a spoiler.

Throughout the movie, all the pretty people live in a lovely neutral world furnished according to the Pottery Barn Catalog.  The Republican parents are worried about ""beige grandkids"" (which didn't seem to bother the Bush family) but are themselves only discernable as Republicans by the Mom's bizarre birds nest hair, and their bigotry.  Then again, what's so liberal about anyone else?  This is a retail version of the world, where people discuss nothing of consequence and thus the differences all come down to style.  In the end, every character has the same thing in common---sex and lies.

We're told that movies with older actors, about older people is the New Market.  This movie is not an encouraging entry.  It may have mostly older actors, but the script has that 30-something American's obsession with sex.  It's like that's all we live for, and all that defines us.  I don't think so, but the earnestness with which the actors make such fools of themselves seems to say they do.

Whatever.  It's light entertainment.  If you approach it that way it's an entertaining film.  I've seen much worse, including the one about two fifty year old golf buddies who head off to Palm Springs, which I tried to watch before this one.

4807062,3,B005LAIIB2,"Watching THE BIG WEDDING  is a chore - if you can make it through it. On paper it looks like it should be a winner and it certainly became a magnet for the older generation of actors who seem to be featured rather regularly in what appears to be a trend. It is great to see the old pros don new clothes, but with a storyline as lame as this and a dialogue that is based on potty mouth and retirement age sex jokes it wears out its welcome very quickly.

They adopted a boy from Colombia, Alejandro (Ben Barnes). Eventually they divorce, Ellie moves away and Don hooks up with Bebe (Susan Sarandan), Ellie's best friend. When Alejandro is about to get married, he informs Don And Ellie that he never told his natural mother who is so traditional that they got divorced. And she is coming for the wedding so he asks them if they can pretend to still be married. Don and Ellie reluctantly agree to it and Bebe moves out who is also upset that Don for some reason doesn't want to commit. Toss in an alcoholic priest (Robin Williams), Alejandro's intended bride Missy (Amanda Seyfried), and Missy's silly parents (Christine Ebersole and David Rasche) and it looks like the weekend should work.

Overall, the humor is light and mostly fun like the old style screwball comedies, but a little bawdy too.

You come away both amused and grinning in the way you do when an older Aunt and Uncle or grandparents lands a real good one that gets you off guard and makes you say: ""Did grammy Anna really just say that?""

Alejandro (Ben Barnes) and Missy (Amanda Seyfried) are getting married, and things couldn't be more perfect. But his birth mother, a strict Catholic from Columbia, is attending the wedding, so Alejandro begs his parents, who are divorced for ten years, to play a happy couple couple since it the biggest sin to get divorced. But where does that leave his stepmother Bebe (Susan Sarandon)? But that's not the only issue: as the wedding is getting closer somehow everyone seems to have the urge to reveal someone else's secret.

Review:
First of all I am glad they made a R rated movie because I am getting tired of all these comedies that have to hold back in cursing or sexuality because they try to make more money by making a PG movie. There are a lot of brilliant actors in this movie and no one is trying to outplay each other, they work together, and work together well. Most of the jokes are on point and even Katherine Heigl has a few funny moments, which is good for her. After all, her performances have been a little stiff and dry ever since 27 dresses. However, the whole storyline of the movie is silly. Why would someone care how their birth mother feel about their adoptive parents being divorced? I mean obviously something in her life went wrong, too, for having to give up a baby, right? So who is she to judge? And why would you put your stepmother through all this after she raised you for ten years? But with that said, I still think it is a fun and refreshing movie that goes by fast.

Comparing this to a really funny movie like Something's Gotta Give is just painful. And I'm easy to please in this genre, would have given it 3 stars (instead of at most 21/2) if I could have just relaxed and laughed more instead of waiting for the next uncomfortable moment. Guess it's back to Indie films this summer, like The Way, Way Back, which also has a great cast and does manage to appeal to a larger audience without taking formulaic short cuts.  And I actually cared about the characters!",1372896000,3,831,4.470198675496689
4807171,3,B005LAIIB2,"Went to see this only because of the impressive list of actors/actresses gracing the screen -- stars I've admired for decades. I was stunned -- at the beginning, middle and end. Hard to figure out how a storyline and its development in the film, including dialogue and ""odd"" scenes, like this one, could have attracted the attention of such great actors/actresses to make them want to star in it. I must have missed something incredibly valuable in this film and am terribly confused over what that was -- and I didn't fall asleep so I must have missed it because I'm probably too stupid to appreciate what it was. An old friend of mine had an answer for every unanswered question in the world -- ""it's always about economics"" she used to say. The more I live, see and learn, the more I wonder whether she was right. Overall I found The Big Wedding more or less corrosive, but maybe it was intended as a corrosive satire concerning romantic relationships between couples both young and old? Maybe the writer/director wanted to make a statement -- every relationship, however precious, is fraudulent and we should all force ourselves to laugh about this reality as a way of conquering our delusions about such. Painful perhaps mentally tortuous film to see, really, but redeemed by a few nice nature shots surrounding the family home.",1371600000,3,1333,4.774891774891775

8477841,1,B005LAIIB2,"This movie is everything bad about Hollywood.  Big names with bad scripts, predictable mayhem, the tired lie/pretend plot that is frustrating and not funny, overuse of sex as a substitute for creativity, etc.  It was terrible from the first minute, but I couldn't stomach anymore at the restaurant scene with the divorced wife pretending to be the current wife, and the current wife pretending to be the server.  I'd rather lose my rental money than subject myself to another minute.  Really, really bad.",1527897600,,504,5.036144578313253

This is a movie that I can watch at any time no matter how I am feeling, this is a feel good movie with lots of heart. This movie is so honest about relationships, family dynamics, etc. I can't believe it's not 10/10 on IMBd...it certainly should be. I would give this movie not a only a 2 thumbs up but ALSO 7 stars, 5 just doesn't cover it.",1525910400,,518,4.088235294117647
