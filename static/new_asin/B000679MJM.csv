8039523,5,B000679MJM,"are you a diehard japanese horror fan? if you answered yes, you will enjoy this film. it is not scary....not at all. but still I loved it. not much of a plot for either 'mermaid' or 'he never dies'...but this dvd belongs in any j-horror purists collection. I will say it again...it has no scary elements, nor does either film TRY to scare you. you are more likely to laugh. I didn't find it as disgusting as described.

A LOT OF FUN.",1227225600,,433,4.280487804878049
8039524,3,B000679MJM,"I couldn't resist watching this movie. As a mermaid performer, I'm always interested in others' depictions of mermaids. If you can get past the gory bits,(and there are a lot of gory bits!) you may even discover a simple story line that is quite interesting. The special effects of the mermaid tail upon first encounter are actually quite lovely. Intriguing ending~ however, if you have a weak stomach- this may not be the movie for you.
As for 'He never Dies', I actually found it to be quite amusing, once I had become a bit gore-numbed by the 'Mermaid' film.",1174089600,2,561,4.62
8039525,5,B000679MJM,"INTRODUCTION: THe 4th in the shock-horror series Guinea Pig was a direct-to-video hit in Japan called ""MERMAID IN A MANHOLE"", ironically a good follow-up to HE NEVER DIES.

STORY: A young painter looking for inspiration goes down into a sewer and finds many things down there, such as a dead guinea pig (Which he picks up asnd asks ""So that's what you deserve? To be in a horrible place like this?"") and then finds a beautiful mermaid, who is sick with a condition that causes the mermaid to grow nasty sores all over her. He takes the mermaid home, where condition grows worse.

THOUGHTS: A good movie! One of the better films in the GP series. Plus this one actually feels like a movie for a change, as this one is 63 minutes (the others are 41-53 minutes). Plus, the ending has a HUGE twist.

So buy this if you like this kind of horror!",1155254400,3,840,4.406451612903226
