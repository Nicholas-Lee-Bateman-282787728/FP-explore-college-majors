755175,4,630401144X,"I couldn't have picked Vanessa Redgrave out of a lineup the first time I saw this movie a few years ago.  Now, of course, I own the DVD, and have collected an impressive pile of her other films, too (including one of my very favorites of all time, *Mrs. Dalloway*).  This movie was, in other words, part of my awakening to Ms. Redgrave, to other British actors, and to films that showcase beautiful places, nuanced characters, and great performances rather than special effects and stock plot twists.

It's hard to explain what makes this film so delightful, though, considering that there is shockingly little plot and dramatic structure even for a so-called ""art film.""  Indeed, *A Room With A View* quickly begins to seem like *The Terminator* by comparison, and *A Month By The Lake* might easily have turned into the most boring two hours one ever spent.

Luckily, *A Month By the Lake* has Vanessa Redgrave and an almost equally wonderful supporting cast.  Redgrave deftly holds the film together with little more than a few hilarious, goofball facial expressions; Uma Thurman plays off this and has lots of campy fun, too.

Four very enthusiastic stars.",1108771200,17,1160,4.887755102040816
755176,4,630401144X,"I must say that the lovely Lake Como and the countryside scenery of Italy in this 1930's romantic comedy was quite pleasing. Especially the movie features a fine English Actress like Vanessa Redgrave who was making me compare her to Maggie Smith In My House in Umbria. Redgrave's role here is not as deep as Smith's, and she had a fabulous time in this funny and touching little period piece. She carried the film on her own, making Uma Thurman's minimal screen time even more insignificant. That's because her role allowed her to show her range from funny to dramatic moments, and she did a fine job at making performance work.

  Basically, this is a movie about an English woman named Ms. Bentley(Redgrave)'s one month vacation by the Lake Como in Italy, and how she dazzled a few Italy boys and found love when she met Major(Edward Fox). She also had to put up with an imature young American woman(Thurman) as they clashed in many ways. Thurman had some good moments in this film, but most of time she's annoying, and gets upstaged by Redgrave effortlessly. I guess she needed to find a better period role to play, something even better than Vatel.",1106697600,6,1152,4.665024630541872
755177,4,630401144X,"Set in gorgeous surrounding at Lake Come pre-WWII, it is tale about a British lady and major, with the triangle formed by an American girl who is a nanny to some Italians.  Mix in a young Italian who falls in love with the older British lady and someone named ""candlestick"" and walla, a interesting film.
At times the plot droans and moans, but overall it is worth the watch.  Redgraves is her exceptional fine actress, here has to carry much, with her grace and dignity and timing.
This is of another time and generation, so takes some patience and hanging in there.",1076889600,17,567,4.549019607843137

755180,5,630401144X,"Vanessa Redgrave is brilliant and absolutely gorgeous in this
fine film about spending a month in Italy.  Uma Thurman comes
into the picture as a nanny for a couple of kids and she and
Vanessa vie for the attention of Edward Fox.  I am basing this
review on the laserdisc which enchanced the movie considerably
and I imagine the dvd will be even better.  One of those movies
that gets more enjoyable every time you watch it.  And of course
I want to go back to Italy every time I see it.  A perfect
companion piece to ENCHANTED APRIL (when will that be on DVD?)",1051747200,24,561,4.304761904761905
755181,4,630401144X,"This is a charming film about an older, free spirited English woman, an expatriate who in 1937 Italy is interested in an older, stuffy Englishman who is on vacation at the same lakeside resort. A young American nanny, who is at the resort with the family for whom she works, catches the same Englishman's eye.  Their love triangle provides many interesting moments for the viewer.
Vanessa Redgrave, who only gets better with age, is charming as the older woman, Miss Bentley, who finds herself competing for the attentions of Major Wilshaw, curmudgeonly played by Edward Fox. Miss Beaumont, played with a certain repellent insousciance by Uma Thurman, capriciously tosses in her hat into the romance stakes. Miss Bentley finds herself playing second fiddle to Miss Beaumont. A young, attractive Italian, however, sees the charms that Major Wilshaw initially fails to appreciate, and Miss Bentley uses his interest in her to great advantage. When Major Wilshaw finally gets his wakeup call, all is well that ends well.
Miss Bentley's wardrobe and style is simplicity itself. Clearly, she is not a woman to follow fashion trends. Yet, she is clearly a woman who will follow where her heart will lead. The young and nubile Miss Beaumont is much more of a fashion maven, yet she lacks the depths of beauty that Miss Bentley naturally has, a beauty that grows from within rather than from without. This is a lovely movie that will make the viewer dream of a time long past.",1039305600,67,1468,4.895582329317269
755182,4,630401144X,"If you long for a peaceful villa on the banks of a serene lake, dream of fresh roses on your breakfast tray, yearn for the serenity of the Italian sun, then watch this enchanting movie.  The setting is the last summer before World War II when a spirited middle-aged spinster named Miss Bentley (Vanessa Redgrave) arrives for her annual vacation.  She is immediately attracted to Major Wilshire (Edward Fox), a fellow Britisher amongst the Italians and Americans on holiday.  She believes you can judge a man by his ears, and Miss Bentley has set her sights on capturing the Major's ears.  Alas, into this mix comes a spoiled American (Uma Thurman) who immediately catches the Major's ears, eyes, and other parts of him.  Miss Bentley is sad when she realizes he is smitten with the beautiful young Miss Beaumont, but she does not give up.  Humiliation and rejection come her way, along with a young Italian who finds the older woman quite charming.  Amidst a scenic backdrop and with the strains of Verdi's ""Aida"" and other soul-stirring Italian music, everyone winds up with the correct partner and all, we presume, will live happily ever after.  A light, clever, and often funny film to relish as you dream of sunny days basking in romance and beauty.",996969600,239,1253,4.7953488372093025

755458,5,630401144X,"A sweet movie with wonderful scenery and charming pre-World War II story line. An older woman is on holiday on a lake in Italy. During her conversations with an older bachelor Edward Fox, we discover that her now deceased father used to bring her to the lake growing up.

Our heroine Vanessa Redgrave is attracted to Fox who served in the British military. But as usual an older woman is assertive and with much more experience where she beats him in tennis and can swim as well or better than most of the men around her, which makes her less appealing to older gentlemen of his caliber. He is attracted to a much younger woman Uma Thurman, who seems fragile and needy but who manipulates him into doing things that end up making him look like a fool.

The story is simple and delightful. When Redgrave goes off with a younger man, turning the tables on him then ends up taking pictures of him, it makes the Colonel and the Thurman jealous each in their own way. When Miss Beaumont (Thurman) encourages the Colonel falsely, Redgrave (Miss Bentley) confronts her.

A picnic is planned by the Italian family who hired Miss Beaumont as their nanny. They invited the Colonel, Miss Bentley and the young man she photographed who turned out to be the son of some wealthy family. The picnic proves to be a delight to everyone but the appearance of allied airplanes puts a damper on the picnicking group.

It is a delightful movie with delightful characters and old-fashioned charm.

Some of my favorite scenes were the tennis match, the swimming trek and Redgrave riding a motorcycle defying all conventions of the time. Wonderful movie!",1380499200,,1630,4.685314685314685

Who doesn't love the Redgrave's?  Lynn and Vanessa.  In this particular movie you get Vanessa.  Anyone who loves Liam Neeson (spelling?) is a friend of mine.  He is the widow of Natasha Kinski (spelling?) who sadly died a year ago or is it two now?  Whom was the daughter of Lynn, the niece of Vanessa if my memory serves me right.  If not, please feel free to correct me.

Enough of the nepotism, here's what you came for.

It's a nice movie with a few little stories going on within.  Love, friendship, lust.  Growing old.  All things that affect us all of us if not now inevitably later.

Of course, since it is filmed on Lake Como the setting is picturesque.  George Clooney is a lucky man.

I have to wonder why an actress of the stature (no pun intended) of Vanessa Redgrave would consent to work in this film.  Again, perhaps it was the location and maybe she just needed to work.  The script is lightweight but a better director could have made something pleasant out of it.  The many, many bad performances from good actors lead me to think that the fault must have been in the direction.  Redgrave is obviously ""of a certain age"" but bounds around like an adolescent.  Fox overplays the fuddy duddy Englishman dreadfullly.  Uma Thurman is quite lovely but again, she vamps so outlandishly that one just wants to yell ""Cut!""

This movie was a good choice for a relaxing evening looking at a beautiful lake (Lake Como) in Italy. The location of the movie was excellent. Vanessa Redgrave's character is an energetic middle-aged woman who has visited the lake for years, even as a child. Her eyes perk up when she sees one of the new guests. Unfortunately, he is 'smitten' by a young, insensitive woman, played by Uma Thurman, a drop-out of a finishing school in Switzerland. Her mother won't allow her to come home, so she is engaged as a nanny for an Italian family.  Her psychological abuse of the gentleman of Vanessa Redgrave's character's dreams, played by Edward Fox, and his reaction to the abuse, is the main plot of the story.

755620,4,630401144X,"A Month by the Lake is a quiet, nuanced romance. The lake in question is Lake Como in northern Italy, in the year before the outbreak of WWII.  The incomparable, still beautiful Vanessa Redgrave portrays Miss Bentley, whose family has holidayed at the villa for a generation. Veteran actor Edward Fox shows up as Major Wilshaw, and he immediately captures Ms. Bentley's interest. At the same time, Uma Thurman makes her appearance as the much younger finishing school runaway, Miss .  The major and Miss Bentley have an on again, off again relationship, as the major does not enjoy being shown up on the tennis court. He does, however, enjoy the flirtations of Miss Beaumont, who is deeper than she seems.

Both women know well how to manipulate the psyche of the major, and it's a delight to watch them play off each other; this romance, which is reminiscent of Enchanted April, is enchanting in its depiction of love the second or third time around. The scenery is gorgeous, the script is low key but effective, and this movie is perfect for a quiet evening at home with some good wine and cheese.",1269648000,6,1099,4.683937823834197

755623,5,630401144X,"I love this movie and watch it again and again.  (Eventually, I realized that I had to own it.)  Vanessa Redgrave does such a great job of portraying an older woman who lives joyfully for the moment.  Though she may have regrets for a lost love and her recently deceased father, this woman is contagiously happy.  I would have preferred someone else to play the male lead.  Edward M. Fox is so stiff.  He does a wonderful job with the vulnerability of his character; a military and business man who has never had the time for romantic love and is now older and attracted to a much younger woman.  He appears to be very uncomfortable with touching another person.  But, that may be the character.  The embrace at the end is very stiff and I feel uncomfortable for them both.  Uma Thurman is the nanny; who appears to vastly overact her part, leading Fox's character on until he realizes how hopeless it is for an older man to pursue a young, immature, and superficial woman.

Vanessa's and Edward's characters are staying at a hotel on Lake Como in northern Italy before the beginning of WWII.  She has just lost her beloved father, whom she lived with for decades and vacationed with every summer at the Lake.  He is taking perhaps the first vacation of his adult life; leaving his engineering firm in England in the hands of others for the first time.  Both are unmarried and appear to like each other.  But, they would have separated and never met again, if a temporary American nanny who is also staying at the hotel had not interfered.

It is a delightful romp of arguments, competition, jealousy, and love; reminding me of the classic Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn films.  But, Edward Fox is definitely no Spencer Tracy.",1255219200,3,1731,4.622950819672131
755624,5,630401144X,"I'm baffled by some of the negative reviews. It escapes me how anyone can not be enthralled with this splendid production. The story, the acting, the setting are first rate. Of course if you've not reached or passed middle age, one can understand how viewers may be put off by the pace of the movie and the oblique dialogue that says more by its understatement and passivity. For capturing the tension that exists between two unattached and seemingly different personalities who are confronting aging and loneliness, Fox and Redgrave give hallmark performances. Thurman also adds much to triangular relationship that addresses the folly of a young coquette enticing then ridiculing an older man. This is a classic that can be enjoyed over and over. There is something to be gleaned from each of its perfect ninety-two minutes running time. This sleeper is a keeper.",1231977600,13,865,5.013888888888889

But the story and the acting suites as an afternoon tv movie at best.  Specially Uma Thurman looks like overplaying every scene.",1188950400,4,343,4.5
755671,3,630401144X,"This film was made after the blazing and much deserved success of ""Enchanted April,"" a completely bewitching film about English women who rent a villa in Italy without knowing each other beforehand. If you like this at all, see ""Enchanted April"" - an infinitely superior film.

This film, a woman's film too, has similar beautiful locations, late 1930s, early 1940s settings and style, and a thinner romantic plot at it's core.  Vanessa Redgrave and Edward Fox give lovely quiet performances as they meet sweet and irritate each other.  Both suffer from middle aged wandering eye to some degree, which drives the plot as we wonder if they will, or will not get together.  Unfortunately, neither one of them is a particularly likable character.  We are supposed to like Redgrave because she is lanky and lopes along, and we are supposed to like him because SHE finds something redeemable.

Worse, the rest of the cast is extremely uneven in performance, and Thuman turns in her most artificial and posey work.  She is lovely and the camera loves her, but she was young, and this is a high school level performance, she seems very ill at ease in this role.  By contrast Redgrave's Italian boy interest does a very fine job, perhaps because most of his scenes are with her.

The story is rather predictable, and for classic film fans, we get to see Alida Valli (The Third Man) in her later years.  Sadly, her performance is also uneven.  When it shows up in so many cast members, one has to attribute this to the Director.  Some of them seem to be playing a broad comedy, but the 2 leads are in a refined drama.

For me it was a little too wispy and feels like too much meringe.  For many this will be a fine, light entertaining diversion.",1179273600,26,1736,4.612377850162867

755675,4,630401144X,"Since George Clooney and his rat pack seem to be bringing back a certain cachet to Italy's Lake Como, it's worth revisiting this picture-postcard pretty 1995 romantic comedy directed by John Irvin since it is set there before the onset of WWII. The lightweight plot focuses on a beautiful, elegant villa in the summer of 1937 where Miss Bentley has already spent sixteen summers with her father. Adored by the staff, she spends her first summer there after her father has died, and on her first day, she is immediately drawn to the polite but rather pompous Major Wilshaw. In typical movie-only fashion, they meet repeatedly, awkwardly and fractiously, in particular, over a tennis match where she defeats the major with ease in front of a most enthusiastic group. There is unavoidable but unspoken chemistry between the two, but further complications ensue with the arrival of Miss Beaumont, the young, flirtatious nanny of a wealthy Italian family staying at the villa. Miss Beaumont manages to convince Wilshaw that she loves him, and he becomes instantly enamored. On her side, Miss Bentley attracts the attention of a much younger admirer named Vittorio, a local Vespa-riding lothario intent on seducing her amid his raging hormones.

As you can imagine, the complications sort themselves out, but the clever way that Irvin and screenwriter Trevor Bentham handle the story, while patently old-fashioned, is also charming and sometimes quite perceptive about how more mature people approach love. In a rare comedic turn that immediately recalls Kate Hepburn circa 1955's ""Summertime"", Vanessa Redgrave redefines any preconceived image one would have of a spinster, as she brings buoyant energy and a blessed lack of self-consciousness to the independent Miss Bentley. Even though she makes no attempt at assimilating into the period with her most contemporary look, she shows off a deft skill for romantic foreplay for likely the first time since she was a mod swinger in the 1960's with movies like ""Morgan!"". Her athleticism is also impressive whether on the tennis court or in the lake swimming the backstroke, though her rather androgynous look wouldn't seem like it would attract the not altogether unwelcome attentions of horny Italian boys.

The other points of the triangle are not as fully drawn. Edward Fox plays the major with a stiff upper lip and glowers appropriately in every scene where he loses his dignity - which is often. Fresh off ""Pulp Fiction"", Uma Thurman plays a man-eating vamp in broad strokes, and her constant delight in humiliating the major gets tiresome. Her beauty, however, is inarguable and Wilshaw's obsession understandable. There is some intriguing casting on the sidelines - as the moony Vittorio, Alessandro Gassman (son of actor Vittorio Gassman) would play the viral maniac in ""Transporter 2"" a decade later; and the proprietress of the villa, Signora Fascioli, is played by Alida Valli a mere 46 years after her seductive turn as Harry Lime's lover Anna in Carol Reed's ""The Third Man"" (sadly and coincidentally she passed away today!). The beauty of Lake Como is captured in all its shimmering light by cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis, and Nicola Piovani's music score provides the right evocative flavor for the period.  It's a sweet, entertaining movie, brief at 91 minutes, and definitely for viewers fond of travelogue movies like Mike Newell's ""Enchanted April"" and Audrey Wells' ""Under the Tuscan Sun"". The 2003 DVD has no extras.",1145577600,24,3489,5.160777385159011
