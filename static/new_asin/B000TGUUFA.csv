2899464,5,B000TGUUFA,This movie leaves you with a warm and fuzzy feeling.  It makes you want to live there and be a part of that family.  It would be great if they came out with a sequel.,1194998400,4,166,3.7142857142857144
2899465,5,B000TGUUFA,"I loved this movie!  Great message, great romance and great Christmas must see movie.  There are few new Christmas movies that match the old classics.  This is a heartwarming must see.  And a handsome leading man!
I highly recommend this movie.",1194220800,29,244,4.878048780487805
2899466,3,B000TGUUFA,"This is a good clean Christian Christmas movie for the whole family. Very nice and easy. Not much chemistry between the main characters, but still nice. BTW, our main guy Cody is cute.  Enjoy!",1193788800,8,192,4.647058823529412
2899467,2,B000TGUUFA,"An energetic young woman named Faith devouts time to writing to encourage the troops overseas.  Cody Cullen receives one of her cards, which keeps him going despite the tragedy he experiences serving in the military.  When he is given the opportunity, he goes in search of the woman, Faith, whose words kept his spirit strong during the war.  He meets Faith and her family and through a series of events, stays in their home to work at the family business for a few weeks.  He quickly falls in love with the vivacious Faith, who becomes engaged to her long time boyfriend, Paul.

While the storyline was engaging and sweet, there were several suggestive and impure scenes, that may give offense.  Cody stays in the home of Faith's family, and she shows him to his bedroom.  There is a quick scene of Paul and Faith passionately kissing alone in the family home & they dance in a sensual manner in another scene.  Playing football, Faith tackles Cody and ends up on top of him with other family members piled on top of her.  Faith lies on top of Cody after falling in the woods and kisses him--highly suggestive.  Faith father makes a suggestive comment to her mother.  The jeans worn by various characters thorought the movie were very tight.

Except for the scene in the woods, Cody acts like a gentleman; while Paul is a selfish, lusty man.

Not recommended as a family friendly movie.",1193443200,17,1387,4.635245901639344
2899468,5,B000TGUUFA,"I love this movie so much.  I never get tired of watching it -- even when it's not the Christmas season.  The scenery is breathtaking.  The story is a good one for those who love a beautiful, clean romance.  I, too, wish there could be more movies like this one available without blatant sex and language.  ""The Christmas Card"" is truly one of my favorite movies.",1193011200,13,363,4.4393939393939394
2899469,5,B000TGUUFA,"I'm usually not so sappy when it comes to Christmas movies, but I loved this movie.

A beautiful woman sends Christmas cards to the troops, with pictures of her hometown.  A sergeant receives one of these cards and after going on leave following a fellow soldier's death, he finds himself in Washington timber country.  I loved the cute little scenes in the diner where they both find they love curly fries and the tasteful flirtations.  The church scene was so nostalgic and made me want to head straight to church.  The only disbelieving part was where she breaks up with her shallow fiance and he takes it so well and gentlemanly.

A Boyfriend for Christmas and Eve's Christmas are also movies I've seen recently that I'm also purchasing.  Take a look at them as well.",1192838400,260,771,4.666666666666667
2899470,5,B000TGUUFA,"Watched this every time it came on TV.... my all-time favorite!!!  Great actors, great scenery, great plot.  Nice to see wholesome, family-type movies again.  In fact, I ordered four which will be Christmas gifts. May order even more.  This one sits with my TV and is watched almost every week.  Does that say how wonderful this one is????",1190937600,55,339,4.775862068965517
2899471,5,B000TGUUFA,"I agree fully with the other two people, a great Clean movie, no bad words, no violence, slimy sex.  just a wonderful family, I hope that the people that produced and directed this movie make others like this, pleasure to watch this movie and now to beable to add to my all time great movie library I've started.  Thanks for the DVD",1190160000,62,332,4.338709677419355
2899472,5,B000TGUUFA,"This is a very sweet, clean, family-friendly movie.  Its one of my favorites, right up there with Hallmark's Season For Miracles - it has the same tone and theme of welcoming strangers into a family.

Cody Cullen is a soldier overseas at Christmastime who receives a Christmas card from well-wishing stranger Faith.  He is touched by the card and keeps it close.  When a fellow soldier is killed in an attack, he returns to the States to notify and comfort the widow.  While there, he also searches for and meets Faith, but never tells her how he knows her.  Through a series of events he becomes like a member of Faith's family.  When his time is up, he leaves the Christmas Card with a special gift for Faith's family and disappears without saying goodbye.  Faith then realizes her feelings for him and tries to catch up with him. Naturally, it is a happily-ever-after fairytale story.  :-)",1189987200,177,892,4.666666666666667
2899473,5,B000TGUUFA,"I watched this movie in December 2006. The Christmas Card is the greatest movie that I have ever watched. Christmas is my favorite time of the year. This family attends church. No suggested dialogue, language, violence or sex. How much better can it get. A soldier in Iraq receives a Christmas Card from a stranger and it keeps him going. It is scheduled to air December 2nd at 9 and 11pm. Dec. 7th 9pm and Dec. 25th 7pm on Hallmark Channel.",1186963200,198,441,4.45679012345679

2899495,4,B000TGUUFA,"I actually like this movie for some reason, saw it on Netflix first, then got it here.  I will agree with comments on the acting, at first, I thought they got a real soldier to play Sgt. Cullen, as he seemed so out of his element.  Turned out he was a real actor of sorts, and if he was acting like a real soldier who was picked to act, he did a good job.",1520726400,,355,3.7837837837837838

2899526,1,B000TGUUFA,"Tripe... As awful a movie as I have ever grimaced through.. I just don't get all the four- and five-star reviews. I can sit through almost any of the Hallmark movies, as dull and predictable as they are sometimes. But this one is uniquely bad. The photography, the sets, the music, the acting, the 'plot', such as it is. Awful. Awful. Awful",1513814400,,340,4.5

2899528,1,B000TGUUFA,"This is one of the worst acted, cheesiest, ""too many scenes are too hokey to believe"" movie I've EVER seen.  I'm astounded it's a Hallmark film and even more shocked at all the 4 and 5 star reviews it's received! Maybe all these people have never seen truly excellent acting or a terrific romantic movie to know what a really great one is.  Watched it twice thinking maybe I wasn't giving it a chance....nope.  Still think it's terribly acted and a cheesy storyline no one with half a level of intelligence would ever believe.",1513382400,,526,4.574468085106383
2899529,5,B000TGUUFA,"The only problem I dislike about this movie, no closed caption.  You need to put either it is closed caption or not.

2899531,5,B000TGUUFA,"Supporting our veterans abroad is the key to our responsibilities at home: while we're covered by their protection, this film presents how important it is to show just how much we appreciate their selfless service.

We meet Faith Spelman from Nevada City CA. who writes an annual Christmas card greeting that goes to Master Sergeant Cody Cullen serving in Afghanistan. He holds this card close to him and it pulls him through the extreme times during his service to our country. When Cody is asked to take a leave of duty back in the States after a long time of serving, he then coincidently goes to Nevada City where Faith and her family run the local lumber mill.

As far as Christmas-themed movies go, the scenery here is as picturesque as a card would look and takes on another character of its own. The story never drags; the cast is definitely tight and truly caring about family life, love, and loyalty. There is the eventual controversy amongst Faiths suitors (or potential ones) in the plot, but what is a good story without a little conflict? This is a story of hope, faith, and the Christmas spirit that I can never get enough of year to year. I need more of these",1512864000,2,1175,4.563981042654029

2899582,1,B000TGUUFA,"Preface...I LOVE HALLMARK MOVIES!!  But this was by far the worst acted movie I've ever seen.  I would give this zero stars if that was an option.  Ed Asner and Peter Jason are the only two redeeming characters in this film.  I saw another reviewer compared the acting to High School or below quality, which I whole heartedly agree with.  I'm genuinely surprised this has such high reviews, and now I question all the other Hallmark movie reviews on here I haven't seen.  Anyhoo...if you're looking to be thoroughly disappointed, I would say go ahead and watch this movie.  But if you'd like to NOT be disappointed don't do it!!  I'm willing to bet most any other Hallmark movie is better than this one.  Hallmark has hundreds of shows to choose from, so if you miss this one, I imagine you'll be happy you didn't lose the hour and a half of your life you'll never get back.",1496361600,,874,4.481012658227848

Obviously no quality control implimented. Upon playing DVD, noticed the sound was a little late from the picture.

The humor elements are just right - some cause me to start laughing before they come up (during our reruns). The overall theme, particularly the constant ""comparisons"" (demonstrated, not explained) between the characters of the hero and the villain, are humorous, and make this a most-beloved Christmas movie.",1488672000,,475,5.025316455696203

2899623,5,B000TGUUFA,"I love this movie.  I have watched it every time Hallmark Channel has aired it.  It starts out so sweet and innocent with a Christmas card sent to one of our soldiers in the Middle East. One of the soldiers in his unit was killed and he gets this Christmas card with a beautiful picture of mountains covered with snow and the way the woman writes her greeting enthralls him and he keeps it and re-reads it often.  He comes back state side and returns the dog tags of his buddy who was killed to his widow. Then he hops on his motor cycle and heads to the town where this enchanting Christmas card came from.  He is eating in a restaurant and is unaware of the pretty young woman who mistakenly gets his order and then the story begins.  He goes to church the next day with the innkeeper and the father of the young lady reaches out to him.  He notes that he is in the Army and invites him back to the family home for dinner. Before you know it the guy is asked to stay there and help with the lumber business all the while watching the young woman and starts to have feelings for her.  She has her eye on him, too but she already has a boyfriend and does not
encourage this soldier. Long story short, the whole family loves this guy and hopes the two young people fall in love in spite of the fact that she
already has a boyfriend.  They think the boyfriend is not the right guy for her, but the soldier is. In the end of some suspense, the soldier gets the girl!  This is a warm and fuzzy movie and I recommend it for you!",1487548800,,1523,4.101010101010101

2899630,1,B000TGUUFA,"Words cannot describe how bad this movie is.  I will stipulate that Edward Asner is cute and funny and does a very good job of being Edward Asner, but the rest of the cast and movie are painful to watch.  The casting is terrible; a more unattractive bunch of people would be really hard to collect.  There is no chemistry between the young folk who are supposed to be falling in love at first sight.  There is no drama, no plot arc.  The directing and cutting are high school quality, and the relentlessly cheesy and cheerful mood and musical score really get on one's nerves while waiting for something, anything, to happen.  And finally, there is no closed captioning for those of a certain age.",1486684800,2,697,4.536

The main guy is definitely swoon-worthy, the main girl is down-to-earth even though you don't understand her choice in guys (then again, she hadn't met the right one yet) and the family is funny and sweet.

2899699,2,B000TGUUFA,"Ok so I bought this movie as a Christmas gift to my mom and because it was really cheap. I went ahead also because of all the 5 star reviews. Wow. Not even 10 min into the movie I was already hating it. The effects were awful in the beginning ( the supposed bombing attacks that looked like fire crackers). The acting is quite awful. It felt really slow too. My poor mom was trying to be nice by telling me to focus on the story. It has a nice message about love and all but it gets lost through the poor quality, story line, acting, etc. I'm glad I only spent $5 on it. I'm cracking up because I told my mom that I'm gonna get her another movie and regift this one to my sis. Lol! She's gonna hate me.",1482624000,,702,3.9507042253521125
2899700,5,B000TGUUFA,GREAT MOVIE!!! A must see. You see the respect service men have for people and the girl he loves as opposed to the other guy she loves. The guy she's in love w/is all about money. The service guy is down to earth and loves w/his heart. [has some funny scenes in it to especially her father.] Wish every guy could love like that. Very far and few between,1482624000,,353,4.130434782608695

Sap only makes my eyes roll . . . absolutely NO EYE-ROLLING in this movie. It's a beautiful story, with unknown actors I have never seen before. And Ed Asner, who I first saw on The Mary Tyler Moore Show, is so wonderful in his part. This movie is a great, ""curl up under the blankets in your best PJ's, with a big bowl of popcorn"" type of movie.

2899821,3,B000TGUUFA,"A little stiff, but enjoyable as a holiday romance flick. Boy meets girl. Problem arises as in boyfriend rival. Boy gets girl. Happy ever after. Hey, it's a Hallmark Christmas romance.  The plot is mostly the same with some rewrites. If you love romance, like me, then I think this won't disappoint. Sure,  you know what's coming, but it's still nice.  Ed Asner has some wonderful speeches when discussing the military, which is the background of the main character (a military man with no family, on much needed leave, meets a woman whose Christmas card he received while deployed. She doesn't know he was the one who received the card. Circumstances continue to throw them together.  After that, you can figure out the rest.

2900005,3,B000TGUUFA,"So, the movie was OK. My main issue was that there wasn't much chemistry between the two leads. The story was nice and it had a heartwarming message, but between the subpar acting, very choppy editing, and random plot holes, it wasn't my favorite. I liked the message and the wholesomeness of it I'll give it that, and Ed Asner was great. But other than those couple positive points, this was a pretty bland film.

***SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT***

First of all, the most annoying character in this movie was Faiths boyfriend Paul. What a big baby!! It was as if he were a child throwing a temper tantrum in the first few scenes of him. Seriously when he brought the gifts to donate, and then Cody brought gifts, he sulked, shrunk his shoulders, and walked out like a little kid. Is no one else allowed to donate? You are a 35 year old man, grow up. Then, u propose marriage to someone (after years of never even thinking about it) just because some other guy is showing interest in her? Another immature move. He was the worst character and the acting was very awkward by the actor. Also zero chemistry with him and the lead girl.

Then there was the lead girl, Faith. Why does she even like this guy Paul? The whole time, she was denying the fact that she knows her boyfriend is a jerk and she deserve better, her entire family knew it too and don't voice their concerns? They are both interested in completely different lifestyles, have different interests, and have a completely different set of morals. Being as strong character of faith and family I don't see how she could consider marrying Paul.

The only 2 characters I liked were her father Ed Asner who was really the only good actor, and the lead guy who was very handsome and a genuinely sweet person. He was not a terrible actor, But even he was awkward at moments. there were times of him just not speaking when someone was talking to him and then the scenes would just randomly cut away. I just can't explain it, the whole thing was edited really awkwardly.

Finally, the ending was just rediculous. Everything got resolved too quickly, I feel like the movie was just sloppily thrown together. They end with them kissing on a bridge and never even discussing any future, I would've liked to have seen them go back home with her family to celebrate Christmas. It just seemed rushed, also the chemistry between the leads was really lacking so possibly another actress would've made that a bit better.",1450656000,,2464,4.5656108597285066

This purchase is a gift and I hope the recipient likes it as much as we do.

The story is very typical of Hallmark/Lifetime romances.  As a frequent viewer of such movies, I can tell you that they often do a poor job---either acting, writing, directing, or some combination.

Overall, this one is well cast and well acted.  The story is predictable, but warm and multi-faceted.

Only con for us is the rejected would-be fiance.  He was truly annoying.  It was hard to fathom why she would have been with him in the first place.",1450051200,2,690,4.619834710743802

The Christmas Card is terribly cheesy, absolutely in the vein of Hallmark Channel holiday romances, and yet, I absolutely love this film. Edward Asner does a perfect job, his character is funny, endearing and practically steals the show (also, how can we ignore that he's Santa Clause from holiday classic Elf?). Underneath the overwhelming cheese is a great message, a real life story, and an encouragement to appreciate those who find themselves protecting our country, away from their family for the holidays - the DVD also features some details on how to send holiday cards to our troops as well.",1449792000,,642,4.953703703703703

What struck me deeply, was how objects and things were not important in the lives of the Spelman family, and how truth, honesty, courage were all portrayed by the lead actor, John Newton - who impacted the lives of the Spelman family so greatly.

What is not to love about this movie?  It is the touching story of Sergeant Cody Cullen, a brave American hero who has defended our nation for the past thirty years in Afghanistan.  When Jonesy dies, his new mission is to find love.

Cody goes to Nevada City, CA and woos the beautiful Faith Spelman.  Sorry Paul, looks like you won't be going to Napa anytime soon!!

2900056,5,B000TGUUFA,"Loved it! I watched this with my wife and we both greatly enjoyed every minute of this well made movie. At the price point on Amazon ($4.90) this is highly recommend for those who collect Hallmark movies on DVD as a collectible. This movie was originally shot in and presented Full Frame (4:3) when it originally aired in 2006, as such is the correct aspect ratio. It is the best way to view this movie since you will view all the great background scenery as originally filmed. Hallmark Channel has repeatably shown this movie over the the Holidays including this year (2015), but in a cropped widescreen presentation that chops off significant portions of the movie from the top and bottom, likely thinking this pleases the viewers. Watch it on DVD, not the Hallmark Channel since you will likely have repeated viewings of this excellent movie.",1448841600,,845,4.794520547945205

Someone goofed up the plot there.  However, the worst thing about the movie was the acting of Lois Nettleton.  She overacted every scene to the point that I now mute it when she is speaking.

2900244,5,B000TGUUFA,"I purchased ""The Christmas Card"" when I realized I might possibly miss seeing it during the Christmas season and I do NOT want to miss it. Now I can watch it anytime I want to watch a ""feel good"" romance movie. Sgt Cody Cullen, a handsome, intelligent, exemplary soldier stationed for multiple tours in the Middle East is given a Christmas card  passed to him by a fellow soldier who has received a ""care package for the troops"" from his hometown. When the young soldier is tragically killed, Cody is hit hard. Put on leave, Cody goes back to the States to consider his future, and with no real family to visit, finds himself in Nevada City to console his friend's fiance and ...to find the author of the beautiful Christmas card that had given him such comfort during a lonely time.  This movie is now part of my Christmas season tradition along with  ""White Christmas"", the ""Santa Clause"" series (for laughs), and as many versions of Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" as I can find.",1425168000,5,979,4.582857142857143

2900274,5,B000TGUUFA,"The Christmas season is my absolute favorite time of year. I am a sucker for the Christmas movies, particularly those produced by Hallmark. Some aspects of this movie are a bit cheesy and hard to believe, like Faith's boyfriend, the wine dealer. Compared to Cody Cullen, it's absolutely no wonder why she left him and followed her heart. The town is typical small town, all decked out for the holidays right down to the little white church on the hill, the cafe where she first meets Cody (having accidentally helped herself to his food), and the spot where they sell the fresh cut Christmas trees. My favorite scenery was the log home owned by Faith's parents (dad is is the incomparable Ed Asner, in an especially cute and conniving role - his goal is to get Faith and Cody together). The home is gorgeous and if I had a log home, that one would be it. You will find yourself rooting for Cody throughout the entire movie, while waiting for Faith to make up her mind. It's cute and worth watching more than once.",1423872000,8,1013,4.510869565217392

Love the Christmasy feeling and the church with special Christmas services,. Enjoyed Cody being able to come home for a rest and recuperation from the war. I liked the man that played the part of Cody, as well as all the other actors/actresses. I liked the story line as well. My only regret is that this movie is not close captioned or have subtitles. I bought the movie thinking it would be close captioned or subtitled since I saw it that way on television.  I found out that movies shown in close caption on Hallmark channels are not automatically close captioned when you buy the same in a store.",1418860800,2,733,4.470149253731344

2900421,5,B000TGUUFA,"It begins in Afghanistan with an American soldier who is given a card written by someone he doesn't know.  The writer has been sending cards to many soldiers overseas, but for some reason the soldier, Sergeant Cody Cullen, is really taken by this card. When he goes home he stops by to see this young woman and, were it not for her fiancee, he would probably propose marriage since he's fallen in love with her.
  There is a very nice background to the story -- it takes place in the mountains of California, and the family (headed by her father -- played by Ed Asner), runs a local lumber company.  It's a very welcome change from many of the other Christmas romances that have business execs and ad execs and what have you.  And the change in setting works in very well with the story.
  A beautiful film that is interesting, a little different while not ignoring the romance nor the Christmas season.  All in all, a lot of fun to watch.",1418428800,2,939,4.4186046511627906
2900422,5,B000TGUUFA,"I confess I didn't buy this DVD from Amazon but I have bought numerous others, all of which arrived in great condition. I do have this movie on DVD just from a local store.
WARNING- Prepare to experience a heartwarming story. This is one of my MUST SEE movies at Christmas. It's absolutely appropriate for all ages so it makes a great family film. The cast is a perfect fit. The chemistry between the leads is undeniable. The movie itself is centered around a small town family Christmas. It has faith elements, romantic elements and more. A perfect example of how we can get ourselves in a place that we've become comfortable with, not because it makes us happy but because it's familiar. There are times in life when we are presented with a chance to escape our comfort zone to follow our hearts. Change isn't always bad and sometimes we just need a reality check.
I most certainly recommend this movie if you love romantic dramas set during the holidays.",1418428800,3,957,4.60233918128655

2900486,5,B000TGUUFA,Very sweet tale about the joy that can be shared between two characters due to an act of kindness.  The young woman writes a letter to a serviceman overseas whom she does not know.  The letter connects the two and is the catalyst of the movie.  I appreciate how the one leading theme is recognizing the freedom we enjoy has been protected by those brave men and women in the armed forces.  John Newton as the leading man soldier is perfect in this role and has appealing chemistry with Alice Evans.  Ed Asner and Lois Nettleton bring charm and schmaltz as the doting parents. This film is at the top of my list of the best Hallmark Christmas movies.,1411776000,,649,4.420168067226891

2900592,5,B000TGUUFA,I like Ed Asner and Lois Nettleton from movies past.  Their characters add to this movie.  This movie made  me feel the attraction between the soldier and the girl who sent him a Christmas card as she did with the other soldiers.  But this soldier wanted to put a face to the sender of the card so he traveled to where she lived.  It was obvious the chemistry was there between them but there was another man in her life and this movie made you wonder if they would ever get together.  The scenery in this movie was breathtaking!  It's a great love story and I would recommend it to everyone to watch over and over again.,1400976000,,621,4.256410256410256

Still, it doesn't damage the entertainment value much.  The boyfriend is about the worst guy they could have put in that part and you wonder why the girl ever hooked up with him, anyway.  The movie was made in the area where I live so that's another plus for it.  Ed Asner was doing what he does best, being a good guy.  The woman at the hotel desk is actually the hotel owners wife.  Not really a tear-jerker but good ""sit on the couch and hug your wife"" entertainment.  Probably for somewhat older folks.  Our kids didn't like it at all.  Gee, that's too bad.",1391212800,,703,4.297709923664122

I believe the network that produced the movie has tried to copy its formula to other movies, but they just haven't captured the wonder and charm of this movie.  Although I never see this movie on anyone's list of top 10 Christmas movies, I feel this one is on the top of my top 10.",1390694400,,514,4.151515151515151

2900681,5,B000TGUUFA,"I sat and watched this initially to keep my wife company and to try to get into the spirit of the season. Well, I ended up getting that and more. The movie gives the viewer a variety of experiences. As a VietNam vet myself, it took me back in the part where Luke Spelman ""salutes"" a photo of some of the guys in his old unit that didn't make it back from the war.  There is of course a lot of the chick flick stuff but it is offset with a pretty good story line in general.

I read some reviews that negatively critize this video but it seems that they are either completely lacking in human emotions or are just too set in their viewing habits if they cannot find some redeeming qualities here. Just what were they expecting?...an explosion filled, shoot em up western action film?  Come on people; this movie is for conveying that seemingly lost family togetherness during the Holidays sort of feeling....expand your horizons or you will eventually become like old man Scrooge in that other Christmas classic.",1390003200,,1011,4.5136612021857925

2900700,5,B000TGUUFA,"A soldier named Cody in Afghanistan receives a card of appreciation, sent as a volunteer effort by a nice and spunky young woman in Nevada City, California.  He takes an indefinite leave from the military and goes to Nevada City.  From there, the story becomes a fascinating conglomeration of a love triangle story, a story about opening your heart to a new family, and a family comedy which feels a little like a situation comedy.  But the characters feel to me more real and less caricatured than in a sit com; the family dynamics feel so energetic and like a real family, not like people playing parts as a sit com inevitably becomes.  The two older gentlemen in the family, Luke (played by Ed Asner) and Uncle Richard (played by Peter Jason), are delightfully colorful and hilarious.

Something I like stylistically about The Christmas Card is that it's sort of a message movie, but it doesn't feel like one, because it doesn't dwell for long periods on emotions and internal conflicts to the extent most message movies/faith-based movies do.  It stays focused on interesting incidents that happen during Cody's stay with this family, which operates a lumber mill/sawmill, but with a focus on the love triangle storyline.

The mature approach which Cody and Faith have to falling in love with each other is admirable, and feels a lot more real than the typical Hollywood fare of instant love.  When I see advertisement images, I wonder why lovers in the photos often like to look like sluts and like they're unhappy and wanting more.  Why can't they be psychologically healthy guys and girls who enjoy each other's company like Faith and Cody?  The Christmas Card is filled with respect for the institution of the family, and shows a mature love relationship that involves personal dedication/sacrifice.  Not a single character feels like a caricature, which is another mark of quality in the movie.  The competitor of Cody for Faith's love isn't a nasty character, or the movie would lose credibility because we would think poorly of Faith's character judgment.  The way the movie works out the love triangle situation is quite skillful and felt true-to-life to me.

I really enjoyed a 5-minute-or-so special feature where a husband and wife talk about how they fell in love through cards and emails while the husband-to-be was in Afghanistan.  You will, too, if you get the DVD!",1389225600,,2384,4.895522388059701

So sad, but, the Christmas Card that this soldier received just before his leave sends him into a relationship that was a match made in heaven.  Excellent story - another Hallmark Christmas classic.  Just shows you what an anonymous Christmas Card to a soldier can mean to him.  Truly one of Hallmark's best inspirational movies.  And Ed Asner (best known as Lou Grant on Mary Tyler Moore) was fantastic as the dad who saw something special about this soldier, and the look in his daughter's eyes - touching, and funny as  Asner begins to find ways to get these two together.",1388620800,,676,4.545454545454546
2900720,4,B000TGUUFA,"""The Christmas Card"" is sumptuous as the scenery and story line between Faith and Cody.  When goodhearted Faith writes to soldiers, she never suspects that her Christmas card will inspire Sergeant Cody Cullen to someday visit the town depicted on the Christmas card.  In a series of events, Cody meets Faith's father an army veteran, beautifully played by Ed Asner and ends up working in the family timber business with Faith. ""The Christmas Card"" follows the story of an American soldier in Afghanistan to a lovely small town ultimately finding family and love with the stranger whose Christmas card he kept.  Challenges arise with the aloof opportunistic boyfriend who finally proposes to Faith.  Spending a lot of time together and an accidental kiss (worth seeing), complicates Faith's feelings. Both lead actors turn in good performances, especially ""Cody Cullen"" played believably by John Newton. ""The Christmas Card"" is a wonderful Christmas movie!",1388534400,,955,5.304635761589404

2900725,4,B000TGUUFA,"No fancy bells or whistles on it, The Christmas Card comes simple and straightforward and heartfelt. I don't know if the record still stands, but when it first aired in 2006, it took in the highest ratings in the history of the Hallmark channel in terms of the made-for-TV original film. It's just hard to stay away from a wartime romance set during the holidays, especially if you've a servicemember in the family.

U.S. Army Sergeant Cody Cullen (John Newton) has stood watch for a long while now, and after a harrowing time in Afghanistan, it's his turn to rotate home just in time for the holidays. Sgt. Cullen is an orphan and has no one to return to. Back stateside, tooling around on his motorcycle, he pulls up at snowy Nevada City, California. He means to pass thru but ends up lingering for weeks. There, he meets the Spelman family, and is it a twist that it's the old patriarch, rather than the lovely daughter, who takes an instant shine to our soldier on leave?

In Nevada City the local church organizes Operation Christmas Card, a care program for which Faith Spelman (Alice Evans) patiently writes letters of encouragement to our troops abroad (""Dear Servicemember...""). Faith's gesture of good will is about to change her life forever.

Tune in to this movie and place your hand on your chest and feel your heart swell up. There's a quiet strength to the narrative. Sometimes, I'm in the mood for snarky films. Sometimes, I hanker for stories wherein the characters exhibit kindness, respect, and courtesy toward each other. The Christmas Card doesn't have much in the way of cynicism and snark. It presents folks who work hard and are decent and who love each other in steadfast ways. The Spelmans take in Sgt. Cullen, provide him with room and board, teach him to know his way around the family business, this lumber mill. Ed Asner raked in the 2007 Emmy Nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor (in a Miniseries or Movie), and, as the gruff Luke Spelman, he serves as the impetus to the plot. You can catch him in a matchmaking temperament.

Good thing, too, as Faith and the sergeant, all they do is cautiously circle each other. Helping to gum up the works is Faith's smug boyfriend, Paul (Ben Weber), him what's an international wine broker. And maybe if the film has a false note, it's that it portrays this guy as so obviously not right for Faith. Paul looks like a punier version of Simon Garfunkel, which doesn't help his cause.

I basked in the cozy, small-town Christmas atmosphere. Shot on location, snow-laden Nevada City and its outskirts are something to look at. I marveled at the Spelmans' roomy log house, the cheer and glow of it. I savored the performances. You never catch the actors trying too hard. I could say that John Newton's performance was too restrained, that he could've demonstrated more spark. But the truth is that there's enough spark in him, especially when he's sharing screen time with Alice Evans. And Alice Evans... she's someone I could watch all day. She's beautiful in this unaffected manner. She seems real, like a person who would actually take the time to write to strangers she's never met. And for Sgt. Cullen, recipient of one of her letters, those words of concern became his lifeline during a terrible tour of duty. Writing to our lonely boys overseas isn't a new tradition. It's been done for years and years. It's even the linchpin in the plot of one of my favorite movies ever, Dear Ruth (1947). All the elements are present to make The Christmas Card a modern-day holiday classic. My list of must-see films during the Yuletide season keeps on growing. But there'll always be room for The Christmas Card.",1388448000,2,3680,4.725856697819315

Thank goodness that all good things are kept somewhere.  In this case, Hallmark and Amazon kept this one close!",1387929600,3,739,4.382352941176471
2900742,5,B000TGUUFA,"This is a heartwarming cd that I have watched more than once.  The Christmas card is an uplifting, feel-good movie for every age group.",1387756800,,135,4.625

2900744,3,B000TGUUFA,"This is the story of a soldier who gets sent home on leave. While visiting the fiancee of a fellow soldier who died, he also looks up a girl from the same town who wrote a letter to soldiers that he happened to receive. He doesn't tell her about the letter. She is engaged to someone who doesn't seem right for her. Her family takes the soldier in after he saves the father from getting hit by a car and he agrees to help run the family business for a while. The two begin to have affection for each other and are obviously a much better match than the girl and her fiancee. There are a number of scenes in which there is chemistry between them and there are a number of likable characters in the movie. In the end though, it comes off as being a bit implausible. For example the soldier gets sent home on leave, which would normally be about two weeks but appears to end up spending at least a month away and never seems to on track to go back. One of the oddest aspects is that he is wearing the wrong rank on the cover photo for the DVD. Aside from some odd things like that, it turns out to be a fairly decent holiday love story. It perhaps had a bit more potential than was realized in the film, but it still turns out to be a nice story.",1387670400,3,1243,4.056910569105691

2900757,5,B000TGUUFA,The Christmas Card is a film you can watch with anybody. The story of a family who take in a soldier for the holidays. Ed Asner and Lois Nettleton are particularly affecting in their fine acting.,1387065600,,195,4.444444444444445
2900758,4,B000TGUUFA,"The plot is a little too good to be true, a variation on the standard romance formula, boy meets girl.  In this case the lovebird's initial `meeting' is through a Christmas card with an enclosed letter: to whom it may concern, season's greetings.  He basically falls in love with a piece of paper with a sentiment attached, while she doesn't know him from Adam.  As luck, or clumsy plotting would have it, he's in the military, back in the states delivering dog tags to a widow.  And.  Since he's almost in the neighborhood, he goes to the town where the Christmas card originated.  Through no fault of his own, he saves the life of the father of the card giver and ends up living with and working for her family.  (Not quite stalking but close enough to make things a bit queasy.)  Things also get a little complicated when he learns she's already engaged to a pinhead wine broker.  No problem, he insinuates himself between her and the pinhead (in a passive/aggressive maneuver), and presto, the obligatory happy ending.  Well, not for the pinhead.

This is not the most original romance or Christmas movie ever made but it works for the most part thanks to a charming performance by Edward Asner (earning him an Emmy nomination), and the incomparable Lois Nettleton, as the family matriarch.  Some of the cast gives an able assist.  John Newton, as the soldier, is capable enough in the part, likable at any rate.  The same cannot be said of Alice Evans as the girl two guys feel is worth fighting over.  She is a bit generic/bland.  It doesn't matter though as this is Ed's movie all the way.",1387065600,,1596,4.586572438162544

2900770,4,B000TGUUFA,"Shown on Hallmark, this is a formulaic, feel-good, happy romantic movie with a predictable ending that my wife absolutely loves.

I was interested in this movie because of the soldier in the movie, John Newton, who played on a couple of the Walker Texas Ranger series and was a good actor.  I was not a fan of Ed Asner but I became a fan of his in this movie because of his acting role.  I think this is a good movie and its a wholesome family movie.

2900904,5,B000TGUUFA,"This movie is so moving and entertaining.  I watched it over and over again.  Ed Asner, John Newton and the cast make this movie flow with reality in believeable situations and keeps the audience in suspense wondering if Faith and Cody finally get together.

What makes a predictable story work is how well it is told.  This film is very pleasing in that regard.  The acting and dialog are acceptable.  Visually it is nice, but nothing spectacular.

It is one of those Hallmark, low-budget films, but again what makes it is the story itself and how it fulfills all your expectations quite nicely.  A sweet, little holiday film.  Very enjoyable.",1365811200,,543,4.479591836734694

However (picky, picky), your reviewer and the person who printed the DVD cover don't know anything about the military/Army.  Cody is not a Captain, as you reported ... he's an E-8 Master Sergeant.  Captains are officers and Master Sergeant's are enlisted.  The picture on the video cover shows Cody with ""buck sergeant"" stripes on ... three stripes, which is an E-5 rank.  Look at the movie and you'll see that his uniform designates the very high enlisted ranking of Master Sergeant ... three stripes up/and three stripes down.  Now having said that, the movie is excellent, I loved it and bought it.  But having spent a number of years in the Army while the reviewer was in his crib, probably free of any military service, this annoyed me enough to want to set the record straight.",1358294400,,843,4.739726027397261

It makes me happy to experience all the joy that is shared by this family, as well as the closeness of the people in the small town of Nevada City, CA.  When they welcome Cody Cullen to the family I begin to really enjoy waiting for what happens next.  Of course I know by now, but that doesn't matter to me I willing to experience it happening all over again.

The actors are all just wonderful in their roles. So believable you find yourself wanting everything good for Cody and Faith.  You want her to realize she loves Cody and it can't happen soon enough.  It is just such a beautiful place to see while enjoying a very special movie.  I think I will watch it tonight just for the heck of it.

Some scenes in the movie should have been redone.  Like the war scene which lacked some realism.  The kissing scenes between Faith and her wine broker boyfried could have had a little more ""umph"" in them.  And the ending should have been extended for a few more minutes.  That said, I enjoyed it and have watched it again.  I recorded it on my DVR, but I get mad when the commercials come on and I have to fast forward it to get back to the movie.

It's a very touching and heart warming movie about how powering true love can be.  I recommend this movie to everyone.  I bought it last year and gave to my daughter for Christmas.

The story, for those of you that have not seen it, is about a soldier who gets a handwritten Christmas card from a woman while he is in Afganastan.  He carries the card with him for a year before he is ordered by his commanding officer to take leave time.  He comes to Nevada City and spends the holidays at their home working at the family lumber mill.
The usual romance persues with its ups and downs.  I don't want to give the whole thing away.  Just watch it and enjoy a feel good story for the season.  I first saw it on TV but knew I had to have it.  I actually have purchased four copies as my friends and nieghbors borrow from me and I somehow don't get them back.  The prices on the DVDs I get from Amazon makes it possible for me to be generous.  Maybe you, like I, will watch several times.",1356048000,2,968,4.074074074074074

Ed Asner and John Newton are both wonderful actors and their relationship on screen is very sincere. And the movie itself has a wonderful meaning about family values and reaching out to strangers. I think, it was just a little bit unrealistic (for me anyhow) in how the romance weaves its way into the story; but then again many movies do this sort of thing so it's not uncommon.  It is worth watching because of it's simpleness and heartwarming element, and, of course, happy endings can never go astray.",1355097600,3,660,4.576271186440678

2901065,5,B000TGUUFA,"First, cudos go to the people who chose the actors.  Each actor was the ""right"" person for the role and, in my estimation, did an excellent job of portraying their parts.  I do not usually like Ed Asner because of his political activism.  But his ability to rise above his anti-American T.V. comments and negative postures against our elected leaders was refreshingly new and welcome in his case.  Here, he played a proud American Army veteran respectful of those who sacrificed so much for us all and even though it was probably a lot of ""put on"" related to his reality in life, it was sure welcome for us to see on the screen.  It was so refreshing to see this aspect of what ""might have been"" for Asner.  In this world where ""Chick-Flicks"" are joked about, just look at who is watching them in the theaters.  Real men, also like movies with loving emotions and happy endings.  This movie was the essence of that genre but I enjoyed it so much that I ordered an extra DVD for my daughter and son-in-law who live in the St. Louis area.  Even the antagonist boy friend was likable in his own way and did an excellent job of bowing out.  Their soft ""love scene"" in the living room just before her parents entered was realistic and well-done. The quiet, whimsical, man at the diner bar did his job of showing that he knew everyone well and was truly enjoying the beginning of this love affair, not at Tiffany's but at the clean and inviting village greasy spoon.  The Hotel clerk was perfect, at the hotel, church and at the dance.  Rosy and her brother couldn't have been better casted and played.  The respected and respectful Army stranger who carried out his Colonel's mission list, 1. To deliver the ""dog tags"" to his buddy's fiancee (should have been one tag...)(this immediately made us wonder are the sparks going to fly between them???  But he has too much love and respect for his fellow Sergeant.)  2.  Getting out of the Army way of life and see the world and the other possibilities out in it.  3.  Give himself the time and breathing room to do his own grieving and make experiences he otherwise would not have even thought of doing.  The way he made quick friends and lasting positive impressions was up-building for all to watch and for teenagers to emulate.  His honesty, his naivete but quick strength of action, i.e. saving Luke's life, kissing ""Dottie"" in the snow, asking for help with the construction of the bench, working circles around ""Paul"" in the woods, and truly enjoying selling the Christmas Trees with Dottie, treasuring the pictures taken there.  The unabashedly center of keeping Christ in Christmas with all the church scenes, all made this an excellent movie to watch and want to join in sitting on ""one of the folding chairs from the garage"" in the living room and elsewhere where the action was taking place.  This is really an excellent movie not just for the Christmas season but for any time when one is feeling ""down"" or ""useless.""  It is ""real"" but as the Sgt. said when he first entered Luke's home, ""It's just as I has pictured it.""  It's the reasonable lift we all need when the bills pile up and when our love-life is seeming a bit dull.  Both men and women can glean its courage and whimsy to start anew and make their own lives better right where they're at.  Thanks for asking me to comment.",1347667200,8,3339,4.54180602006689

It's a beautiful Christmas Movie down to the Christmas Tree! I am glad We still have these type of ""Family Christmas Movies""!

This is a wonderful Family that is Making Christmas cookies,getting together with Their Families,enjoying the Smell of Baking ! They centered a lot of the movie around Church & Giving!

Now, this movie was a low budget film. I see that Notting Hill, my favorite movie, had a budget of $43 million dollars, and, it had Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant along with some wonderful supporting actors.

Now, what do you think the budget was for 'The Christmas Card'? One million? Maybe two? We get spoiled over the five star movies that cost millions, but we sometimes pan these low budget movies. Let's put this in perspective.",1330905600,3,605,4.601851851851852

with everything going on in the world, with all our brave men and women fighting for our freedom, it is refreshing to see
a movie that is real and possible. i love the characters the way this family took in this servicemen and the way he was brought to them, makes you realize that there really are angels out there!!!!!!

i don't think i will ever see a better movie again.",1298419200,,481,4.161290322580645

Thanks again AMAZON.COM for providing this DVD for purchase.  This was also received in a speedy manner.,1297296000,,273,4.76595744680851
2901104,5,B000TGUUFA,"I recommend ""The Christmas Card"". It has folksy charm, and Ed Asner does a great acting job trying to get his daughter and the soldier together.",1296172800,,144,4.576923076923077
2901105,5,B000TGUUFA,The movie is an excellent family movie set at Christmas time. It's a story about a young man serving his country overseas and gets a Christmas card from someone he has never met. It is written so well that the young man wants to see who this person is that wrote the card. He ends up meeting the person and the story continues from there keeping you anxious that he gets together with this person. The movie is well written and has strong support from all of the characters.,1296172800,,474,4.337078651685394
2901106,5,B000TGUUFA,I love this movie it a romace movie that the hole family can watch thair no sex in it so the hole family can enjoy it,1296000000,,117,3.5384615384615383
2901107,5,B000TGUUFA,This story really touched my heart like no other has.  I saw it for the first time this year and it will always be my all time favorite.  I think I have memorized every line between Cody and Faith.  Faith fell in love with him not knowing it until she realized how much he loved her. The scene at the Vietnam Memorial is my favorite.  He realizes she loves him.  He finally knows what it is like to have a family and be loved.  I wish this movie had a sequel.  It would be wonderful to see them again.  I just adore this movie and tell everyone about it.  I wish there were more movies out there like this one.  God Bless you for making this movie.,1295481600,,648,4.031496062992126
2901108,5,B000TGUUFA,"I liked this movie the first time I saw it, and each time I see it, I like it better.  Sometimes a little movie hits a grand slam, and that's what I would say about this movie.  The character development makes it so believable.  Well done!  You won't be disappointed.",1295481600,,267,4.28
2901109,5,B000TGUUFA,"The Christmas Card DVD is, in my opinion, the best love story EVER! It is a genuine, sincere, heart-warming story that everyone can relate to. The story line is very believable, not exaggerated as many love stories are, and the cast gives superb and excellent performances. Ed Asner, John Newton, and Alice Evans star.",1295395200,,318,4.907407407407407
2901110,5,B000TGUUFA,"I had saved this through the Christmas season in favor of more popular fare - or so I thought. All the positive reviews here are true. I especially appreciated the role of Faith, a strong-willed and confident woman who loves her boyfriend and struggles with her feelings for the lone soldier who was ""just passing through"". After a few months of viewing this movie repeatedly, I suspect that its appeal, at least to me, is in the low-budget, rough nature of its filming. The only other movie I can think of where people on the screen acted as I would imagine real people would act in similar situations is ""As Good as it Gets"" with Jack Nicholson (and a budget that could have supported ""Christmas Card"" and probably a dozen sequels). Sometimes the acting needs to take a back seat to the story, and that, in large part, is what makes this movie work, although that is not meant to be a criticism of the actors involved in ""The Christmas Card"". I think the cast was here because they wanted to be; they certainly didn't do it for the big bucks. The characters were believable because they were flawed. Count me in the crowd who hopes for a sequel, with as many of the same cast as still possible (although I think the story's concept is what really matters, not primarily the cast).",1295222400,,1282,4.506437768240343
2901111,3,B000TGUUFA,"I am not a huge fan of Christmas movies in general.  However, I enjoyed this movie more than most.  It's a clean, sweet movie with an interesting storyline.  It makes a good gift for someone who enjoys heart-warming stories with a dash of sentiment.",1295222400,,249,4.613636363636363
2901112,1,B000TGUUFA,"Wow! I couldn't believe all of the good reviews on this movie. Short and sweet; plot is very predictable, and the acting is subpar. It's obviously this was a low budget film starting with the first ""explosion"" while the soldiers were in camp. Not all low budget films are poorly scripted, however this one takes the cake. Don't waste your time on this movie, unless you want to see a slew of bad acting and comedic attempts at a love story.",1293926400,,440,4.444444444444445
2901113,5,B000TGUUFA,this was a great movie I think it a great holiday movie my 75 yer old Mom thinks it a good love story all in all we love it,1293753600,,123,3.2758620689655173
2901114,5,B000TGUUFA,Faith sends handmade Christmas cards through her church to servicemen in Afghanistan. Cody a Master Sergeant in the army receives one of the cards given to him by a member of Faiths church. Cody keeps the card and relies on it to keep him going. After a tragic bombing Cody is sent on leave and he goes to the town where Faith and her family live. An unusual situation happens and Cody is asked to stay with the Spellman family for the holidays. Luke Faiths father sets out with a plan to get Cody and faith together as a couple. There are several twist and turns that makes the movie worth watching. All the actors are wonderful and I dearly loved the movie.,1293148800,,659,4.365853658536586
2901115,5,B000TGUUFA,"I loved this movie....yes it was predictable but the charaacteristics that the father and mother had were...well, you don't see
them these days...very respectful, and well won't find another movie like it...I loved it!",1293148800,,218,5.4411764705882355

2901118,5,B000TGUUFA,"Really enjoy this movie, as the young soldier falls in love with a girl he does not know who sends him a Christmas card, he goes to find her on his leave. Ends up she is engaged already. You will have to watch the movie to know what happens. Love o this movie and would recommend to my friends.",1291593600,,294,4.0
2901119,5,B000TGUUFA,This is one of the best Christmas movies I have ever watched.  It has become a new family tradition for us.  We've watched it two times already this year!  Fun for all the family to share. The beautiful real Christmas story is presented so well.,1291420800,3,245,4.4
2901120,5,B000TGUUFA,"The Christmas Card has been a favorite of mine for several years after first seeing on the Hallmark channel.  For those who enjoy love stories and Christmas, this is a must see. The actors are real and their portrayals believable. I recommend this movie for all family members.",1290988800,,277,4.770833333333333
2901121,5,B000TGUUFA,"This is a wonderful story, that I watch at least twice during the Christmas holiday season.  A twist of fate sent a young soldier to find the young woman who sent him a Christmas card.  Instant attraction occurred between the two, with Dad playing matchmaker after he saw what was happening.  The spoiler was the traveling selfish boyfriend, who started aggressively romancing her only after Cody came on the scene.  True Love does win in the end, and a lonely young man finds a family at last.  This is a wonderful movie, which stresses love, family, hard work and fair play.  This movie is certainly a keeper.",1290816000,2,611,4.663551401869159

2901123,5,B000TGUUFA,"I'm not usually one to write reviews, but I made an exception for this movie. It is so wonderful! I watch it every year around Christmas, and I usually end up watching it at other times during the year as well, just because it touches so close to home. I think the movie is made up, but this is something that could really happen. It's been made so much easier for people to send letters and packages to the soldiers overseas, and that's exactly what happened in this movie. Being the daughter, sister, cousin, grandchild, niece, and girlfriend of men who have served, I'm always touched by movies like this. I can't even count how many times I've seen this movie. I would recommend it to anyone!",1289520000,2,696,4.488188976377953

I will give this one to my daughter after viewing it again. It is a good movie and one of those that seldom come around anymore. It is not specifically a war movie, although the opening is set in a War zone, but it is for all the romantics out there.",1284076800,2,406,4.0875
2901127,5,B000TGUUFA,This was a great family movie.  Wouldn't win any awards for great filming but for pure enjoyment.  Nice to see a movie that makes you feel happy and fulfilled when it is done with nothing that you couldn't show your grandma.  In fact she is the one who got me hooked on this movie.  Enough romance to make it fun and enough drama to make it interesting.  Not a shoot um up western but just a small amount of war tragity.  Enough to pull the heart string but not so much to depress you.  Thumbs up for just a fun wholesome movie.,1282780800,,528,4.117647058823529

2901131,5,B000TGUUFA,I recently saw this film on television over the holidays in Australia and was hooked.  So I immediately went online to see if I could purchase the DVD.

2901139,5,B000TGUUFA,I've enjoyed this movie immensely during the last two Christmas seasons.  It is such a moving portrayal of a warm family who reaches out to this military man in so many touching ways.  It all begins with a Christmas card from a stranger to an officer serving overseas - the story is uplifting and will warm your hearts at Christmas and throughout the year.,1265155200,,356,4.546875
2901140,3,B000TGUUFA,"I was disappointed. This is the first TV movie I have purchased on DVD. I expected it to be more contiguous, without the ""hard"" cuts for commercials; new scenes would have a smoother lead-in. Even on an upconvert DVD, it wasn't impressive.

2901146,5,B000TGUUFA,"This is a wonderfully sentimental love story focusing on a family-less soldier who goes home on leave and finds the town where he received a Christmas card from while serving in Afghanistan.  From the first moment all involved are rooting for Cullen to be the love-interest.  Unfortunately, there is another fellow in the picture.  But lest I spoil the ending, suffice it to say, the movie is enchanting.  The acting is rather lackluster, pitiful to be exact.  But the storyline carries the film beautifully.  And there are two very handsome fellows in the movie that are a treat to female eyes.  This would be a wonderful girls night out movie, or date movie.",1262995200,,660,4.787610619469026

Other than that I love this movie with more unknown actors--less distraction of analyzing a big star.  Real down home feel to it, lots of Christmas cheer, beautiful scenery and charm, and a warm fuzzy feeling to it.  Two thumbs up for a girl movie.  Another good one for slumber parties.",1262044800,,441,4.4625

I gave them out Christmas Eve Day and they thought it was such a great gift to open and watch that night. They were in a happy wonderful mood all Christmas Day. The best thing is no commercials and you don't miss any moment as this movie is full of wonderful and heartfelt moments. Watch the bonus features... it is important to keep the message going with our troops and it doesn't have to be only the Christmas Season to do so.,1261958400,,629,4.384615384615385

It's a nice story with a happy ending that you can see coming from several miles away.  It doesn't matter.  I didn't buy for plot twists and deep thought.  I liked it enough on TV that I watched it more than once and then decided to add it to my Christmas DVD collection.

2901155,5,B000TGUUFA,"One of the secrets in making a great holiday movie is the setting, and this one takes advantage of one of the more beautiful spots in the northwest.  Along with the setting and superb acting, the movie also delivers a wonderful, warm-hearted and believable story with a well balance of drama and humor to bring what could very well be a holiday classic! This is my facorite Christmas movie and one of my most favorite of all movies.  A soldier gets a Christmas Card through a fellow soldier friend from a lady at the soldier's Nevada City church, and it begins a whole new direction in his life when his buddy suddenly gets killed and he gets leave to go back to the states for the holidays.  His loyalty to his fellow soldier takes him to Nevada City to comfort this friend's fiancee and decides to spend the night there and attend church services where the card originated and by a series of events gets invited to spend the holidays with the family of the lady that wrote the card and work at their lumber mill.  The lady, Faith, doesn't realize that Cody, the soldier, received her card until after he leaves.  Another thing that I liked about this movie is the writer's intent to provide clues to the viewer of the location of the setting of this movie without actually providing the name of the state where Nevada City is, allowing a certain bit of mystic to elevate the movie into a magical fairyland feeling.  Although I have not been to this part of California, it is a place that I now intend to visit in the future.  The bridge, which is mentioned in the movie as being on highway 49, looking on Google Earth, is the new bridge scanning the Yuba river (next to the old bridge) about 5 miles north-west of Nevada City and you can see the spot where the last scene was shot.  Incidently, another reason to visit there, although not in the movie, is that just west of that bridge about another five miles is the world's longest single span covered bridge in the world.",1260144000,10,1976,4.454293628808864

2901161,4,B000TGUUFA,"Sorry, can't give this 5 stars like ""A Wonderful Life"" but this is good Christmas romance date movie for women (and gay men, I can say that I'm gay!); I'd definitely buy it and watch it every year.  Attractive leads who can act (Ed Asner is wonderful as usual), good - if not predictable - script, and nice scenery.  I'd love to live in THAT home - Christmas and always!  Nothing here of interest to kids though, it's very much a chick flick.",1258070400,2,442,4.301204819277109
2901162,3,B000TGUUFA,"The cover is very nice, the summary of the plot sounds just like it's up my alley for nice, romantic, holiday movies, but the acting is very stiff and the editing leaves something to be desired.  Even that could be forgiven if the movie itself portrayed some useful character growth or plot points.

I was waiting for the scene where my eyes would tear up, and my heart would rejoice at the happiness of some moment, and it didn't come.  I ended the movie disappointed overall.",1257552000,2,477,4.523255813953488
2901163,3,B000TGUUFA,"It was a good TV movie, but marred by a couple of poor performances.  Additionally the cover photograph shows the lead character as a buck sergeant when the first part of the movie he is a Master Sergeant!  A big difference to make such an error on the photograph on the cover.  Also the ribbons do not match the characters service in Afghanistan; 5 minutes on the internet could have informed even the most un-informed of the correct ribbons.",1257379200,7,443,4.582278481012659
2901164,5,B000TGUUFA,"I would have to say that this is the best Christmas movie I have ever seen!  I bought it a couple of years ago & I never tire of watching it.  I watch it off & on all year round.  This is a great love story and I love the setting.  There is a lot of things that remind me of a ""homey, old fashioned Christmas"".  It warms the heart.  The actors are great & I would highly recommend you add it to your Christmas Collection!!!!",1256774400,,424,3.872093023255814
2901165,5,B000TGUUFA,"Yes, perhaps the story was somewhat unbelievable and ""sugary"".  There were also a few inconsistencies along the way.  However, it is a movie that I can watch time and again and revel in a family who loves each other, loves their country, their town, and their faith.  It is a made for TV movie by Hallmark.  You can trust that these kinds of movies will be clean and family friendly.  If you are looking for a sweet little romantic story, this will fill the bill.",1255046400,,463,4.4
2901166,5,B000TGUUFA,"I live in Grass Valley/Nevada city and saw the filming of this movie, which made me what to see it complete. It is a good, clean family movie with lots of family values. Yes, maybe the acting wasn't all that great but it sent a good measage to all. I would add this movie to my collection.",1252800000,,289,4.087719298245614
2901167,5,B000TGUUFA,"In a world of uncertainty, pain, and sorrow I thoroughly enjoy being reminded there are still many good people...not only in the movie but the writers and actors who created a wonderful story, who believe there are still people in the world who want to watch a clean, simple story about family values instead of violence and horror.  One of my all time favorite stories that truly makes me feel good every time I watch it!",1251504000,2,422,4.552631578947368
2901168,4,B000TGUUFA,"This movie is about a soldier who falls in love with an unknown woman through the ""Dear Servicemember"" Christmas card she sends to ""Any Soldier"" stationed in Afghanistan.  When the soldier is awarded a leave soon after receiving the card, he heads to this woman's town to meet her.  Her parents take him in for the holiday season and give him a job at their lumber mill in exchange for the room and board he is enjoying.  You'll have to see the movie to see how the romance plays out.  This movie is lacking in a lot of areas (thank goodness!) It has absolutely NO swearing or profanity, NO premarital sex, NO talk about having sex, NO innuendos about sex, and NO divorced/dysfunctional families.  Other than a brief attack scene set in Afghanistan, the movie is blood free as well.  What this movie DOES have is a strong, loving, caring central family, characters reaching out to people in need, respect for those serving in the military, respect from those serving in the military, characters that go to church, humor, romance, and a sweetness you don't find in Hollywood's mainstream fare.  It makes me wish I had Satellite TV so that I could get the Hallmark Channel.  I didn't rate it a 5 because some of the acting was less that stellar and, though the characters went to church, it was odd that there were no children in church, just older people and the young couple the movie centers around.  I thought the lack of children was odd and it sort of sends a bad message that church is not for the younger generation, only for old folks.  Maybe there are churches out there that don't allow children, but that seems weird.  Anyway, this is a really good movie and I think I will add it to my collection.  See if your public library has it available if you'd like to see it before you buy it.",1248480000,6,1796,4.475460122699387
2901169,1,B000TGUUFA,"I am suprised that so many reviewers have given this movie 5 stars - I found the story line completely predictable, most of the scenarios in this film are unbelievable, and this couple will be coasting along and you wonder how their relationship will grow, and all of a sudden they will be necking on the couch, throwing themeselves on each other, rolling on the ground kissing etc - very weird - as though they wanted to throw in some passion, but didn't have time or take the time to make it build to that point - like the director went back after finishing the movie, and said - ya' know, we should throw in some kissing - not at all well done, and as I said, completely predictable. You should probably just rent this movie, or borrow it from a friend, and spend your money on movies you would enjoy watching over and over - such as the Anne of Green Gables series, Pride and Prejudice, Jane Erye, Little House on the Prairie, Dr. Quinn. If you are wanting a Christmas movie, perhaps It's a Wonderful Life is a much better choice - even if you have seen it 100 times before.",1248048000,7,1078,4.315270935960591
2901170,5,B000TGUUFA,"This is a great movie, it portrays good family values as well as a great story line. It also honors the veterans which is not something you see alot. It is a genuine movie that shows that there are still families who love each other and who put faith and family and love above all else. I would reccomend this movie to anyone.",1247616000,4,326,4.190476190476191
2901171,5,B000TGUUFA,"This is the best ever christmas story. I saw it one year on Hallmark whilst visiting my daughter in the U.S. and I had to have it. I have watched it again and again and love it everytime. My friends in Austalia all love it too.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone that really likes a good old fashioned love story. Although this is called a christmas story you can watch it anytime and enjoy it everytime.",1245110400,3,410,4.256410256410256
2901172,5,B000TGUUFA,"Honestly, at first I thought this movie looked a little boring. From the cover, it looked only ok. I then watched this, and loved the small-town scenes and old-time romance between the parents. It was a fun romance too, but it seemed that Cody was much more interested in Faith than she was with him. Whether she was just ignorant, or purposefully not interested, she was extremely dry and unaffectionate. The movie was almost perfect, if only Faith would have been more real and emotionally in touch with what was going on between her and Cody. This movie is suitable for all ages; no swearing, perverse actions, or anything else. I really enjoyed this movie because it was not like the trashy movies being made today.",1245024000,3,719,4.714285714285714
2901173,5,B000TGUUFA,"This is one of those movies you just have to add to your collection, its such a great love story/family movie, it has you hooked right from the beginning, I watched it with my boyfriend and we just loved it, it is also nice that it is set at the holiday time, it gives it a more warm feeling, the cast is also great, they all worked great together, this movie makes you feel you are right in the small town with all of them. There is not one thing that we didn't like about this movie, we give it 5*****'S .Great Movie!

2901174,5,B000TGUUFA,"I BELIEVE I MAY HAVE COMMENTED ABOUT THIS MOVIE BEFORE. THIS CHRISTMAS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BETTER ONES I HAVE SEEN IN YEARS. MANY OF THE CHRISTMAS MOVIES THAT ARE CRANKED OUT TODAY CENTERS AROUND FAMILY SQUABBLES, AND NONSENSE. LOTS OF FUSSING, FIGHTING AND BITTER MOMENTS. THOUGH I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE ABOUT A THOUSAND TIMES AND I REALLY LOVE IT, I TOO AGREE THAT THE MOVIE HAS ""HOLES"" IN IT. IT IS RATHER INCOMPLETE IN SOME AREAS. I DO NOT AGREE THAT CODY AND FAITH DID NOT HAVE ANY CHEMISTRY. THEY DID SPEND TO MUCH TIME TRYING TO AVOID EACH OTHER THOUGH. BUT THAT HAS TO BE RESPECTED. AFTER ALL FAITH HAD A BOYFRIEND. OBVIOUSLY SHE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH PAUL. IF SHE HAD BEEN CODY MAY HAVE JUST RODE OFF INTO THE SUNSET. I WONDER IF THE STORY MAY HAVE CARRIED MORE WEIGHT IF IT HAD HAD THE TWO COMMUNICATING BY LETTER FOR A WHILE. THEN HAVE CODY TO COME INTO TOWN AND HAVE THEM TO SOMEHOW MEET. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ARMY MEN BUT I CAN IMAGINE THAT THEY CAN AND DO GET VERY LONELY. SO GETTING A LETTER FROM AN ""UNKNOWN FEMALE"" CAN BE PRETTY EXCITING. I HOPE THIS MOVIE HAS A SEQUEL. I LOVE TO PLAY WITH IDEAS ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BECOME OF CHARACTERS IF ANOTHER MOVIE CAN BE MADE. SADLY LOIS NETTLETON HAS PAST ON. ALL IN ALL THIS IS STILL A MUST MUST MUST SEE.

2901175,3,B000TGUUFA,"This movie was a cute, cheap chick flick.
It had good messages here and there, but it lacked some real ""meat""

I recomend renting it before you buy.",1241913600,,219,4.45
2901176,2,B000TGUUFA,"Perhaps I've seen too many good movies (most of them older movies) lately but this one really disappointed me.  I read all the great reviews and ordered it expecting more than what I saw in this movie.  The performances were stiff and wooden, there was little chemistry between the Cody (Newton) and Faith (Evans), the story seemed elementary and didn't flow well from one scene to the other.  In fact I saw little chemistry between most of the actors in this movie--the ""acting"" between the players was obvious, especially between Newton and Evans, even the last scene lacked chemistry between the two, when you can't get the final love scene emotionally charged there is definitely something missing--dropping the takeout plate and throwing your arms wide open isn't exactly a tender, touching love scene--Newton at least did better there than Evans.  I don't mind obvious movie endings but this one made me wonder where the ""magic"" was with any of the characters.  Wish I had saved my money.",1241740800,,994,4.92814371257485

2901179,5,B000TGUUFA,"The story of a young military man who follows his heart is a lovely, sweet story.  We all enjoy seeing Ed Asner again, and the two relatively new faces of Alice  Evans and John Newton are fresh and very real.  Nevada City is an actuall place, set high in the California mountains, and a great setting for this logging business movie.  What a beautiful reminder of what Christmas should be with friends and family.  A seasonal favorite, for sure.  I bought it just to see John Newton any time I wanted to.

2901181,3,B000TGUUFA,"Nice Christmas time movie.  Cute story line.  Editing is a little slopppy and choppy.  Continuity fails many times leaving holes in the script.  I thought the ending was rotten.  There could have been another three to five minutes that would have been a much more satisfactory ending with Faith's father and mother involved.  I liked the movie a lot, but it was hard to follow sometimes.",1235260800,4,387,4.787878787878788

2901183,5,B000TGUUFA,"My wife thinks I'm crazy.  I teach two university courses on film aesthetics, and yet I think I've watched this DVD more times than any of the great classics I show in my classes.  What gives?  Well, part of it is plain, ordinary prejudice.  I love the town of Nevada City, have visited it many times, and this is the only movie in which NC, so to speak, portrays itself.  But this also is a very well written, directed, and acted little movie.  The only real flaw is in the casting of part of Paul.  Ben Weber is a competent actor, but he is just the wrong type to convince us that Faith has loved and waited for him for years and years.  Except for that, it's really quite wonderful.",1233964800,3,685,4.2153846153846155
2901184,5,B000TGUUFA,"I being ex-military found this movie to strike home to me.  The feelings we, military personnel, have for each other transcends all boundaries.  There is a great feeling between the leads that grows as time goes on.  Even though Faith has thought she would marry Paul, whom she has known for a long time finds there are greater feelings of love that can come as she gets to know Cody.  Ed Asner is terrific as are all of the participants.  It is a great move we watch many, many times and never tire of the feelings that are brought forth from us as we re-live the movie.",1233705600,2,571,4.299065420560748

2901187,5,B000TGUUFA,"This is a pretty easy review to do. ""The Christmas Card"" is simply the best holiday movie my wife and I have seen in a long time.  Even if you're not part of a military family, this show will hit home.  Casting, scenery, pacing are all top notch.  And the happy ending is worth waiting for.

The main story takes place in current-day northern California where the Spelman family runs a local lumber business.  Edward Asner plays the family patriarch and is just great in the part.  The late Lois Nettleton is touching as Mrs. Spelman.  Their daughter, Faith, is really the story's central character, played convincingly by Alice Evans. It's Faith's Christmas card sent to troops overseas that draws our hero from Afganistan to Nevada City, CA.  Our hero is Sgt. Cody Cullen, played perfectly by John Newton II.

Faith already has a boyfried, Paul, whom we quickly learn to dislike.  Among other things, Paul drives a black Porsche and is an international wine broker and wine snob.  After several years of absentee courtship, Paul hopes to win Faith and join him in globe trotting the world's vineyards.  Faith would rather stay with her family in Nevada City and work at the lumber mill.

Enter Sgt. Cody Cullen during the holiday season and the love triangle is complete.  Sgt. Cullen quickly falls for Faith but she feels obligated to Paul.  Then Paul proposes and Faith accepts, but later has second thoughts.  Various twists and turns ensue. Unintentionally, Faith ends up in the arms of Sgt. Cullen.  She feels guilty about this and so confides in her mother.  She tells Faith to follow her heart and we're left wondering what will happen.  In the end, Faith reads a departure note of thanks sent by Sgt. Cullen to the Spelman family.  Faith then realizes she can't live without him and tracks him down.

If you only see one Christmas movie next holiday season, we suggest you see this one.  It's sweet without being sappy; romantic and inspirational without overkill.  And if you don't end up cheering at the end, you probably drive a Porsche.",1233446400,44,2050,4.745042492917847
2901188,5,B000TGUUFA,Really great movie.  I actually live in Nevada City ( yes its a real town) It was like watching a home movie.  Its a definite must see.,1233446400,2,135,3.962962962962963

It is a great place to visit as well, the people there are so wonderful, the shops and restaurant unique, and the scenary is beautiful.

2901194,4,B000TGUUFA,"I had never heard anything about this movie, so was pleasantly surprised at this.  It's about a woman who writes a Christmas card to an unknown serviceman in Afganistan, and how that letter sustained and encouraged him.  When he was on break in the U.S., he decides to look up this woman and meets her and her family, and really never identifies himself as the soldier who received her card.  The woman had a very long standing serious boyfriend, whose relationship gets very complicated as they fall in love.

This is a touching Christmas movie with a lot of great scenes about true love.  I love how the marriage of her parents and the family business was portrayed, they were a family you wished you came from.

It was a bit predictible in story plot, but still it left you thinking about the deeper issues of life and the holidays besides gifts and getting and the whole holiday busyness.",1232064000,3,892,4.578616352201258
2901195,5,B000TGUUFA,"I wished that the people who make movies, would make more movies like this one! It is a pure, clean and sweet, love story

 This is a story about a handsome soldier named Cody, who receives a christmas card from a complete stranger, who happens to be a very beautiful woman named Faith Spelman. The words in Faith's christmas card keeps Cody going during the war, in Afganstan. When Cody returns to the USA, he makes a special, long trip to Nevada City, to find and meet Faith. And guess what Cody falls in love with Faith, and her wonderful family! And when Faith's long distance boyfriend Paul arrives on the scene ,things start to change forever for Cody and Faith!

 I so loved the Spelman's beautiful home, and I loved the pretty outdoor scenes! And I just love handsome men ,who love working outdoors, and also men who have a sense of humor, and men who have a gentle heart of pure gold, as all the men in this movie have!

 I so loved, the Spelman's beautiful MAGIC SPOT, WHERE THE MAGIC BEGINS, and I loved the church scene with Cody, and the cafe scene with Cody and Faith! I am a country girl and I so loved the ole-timey feel of the cafe scenes, and church scenes!
  This clean, sweet love story, is for all the USA SOLDIERS, my heros, who are waiting to get mail from home.

I want to THANK ALL THE USA SOLDIERS, FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, FOR OUR FREEDOM! AND I WANT TO THANK EACH USA SOLDIER FOR YOUR AMAZING COURAGE!

 This is a special movie, you just feel the love the Spelman's have for each other, and how they sincerely welcome, Cody into their life!

2901201,5,B000TGUUFA,"I loved this movie.  It brings back memories when I was in Vietnam, waiting for letters and care packages. When someone you don't even know sends a christmas card like this to you while your in a war zone, the impact of the message that someone cares about you and wishes you a safe return home, it only puts stars in your eyes.

This was a well produced and directed movie, I didn't see any holes in the story line.  When Cody went to visit sgt Jone's widow, that made me well up with a lot of emotion.  The seane didn't really show her crying, but I'm sure she did.

That boy friend of faith's was shot down in flames when the two of them kissed at the secret place.

The curly extra crisp fries was the main point in the movie, they both thought alike and were very hard workers and were very much into family closeness too.

Happy days for them both, I only wish I could of had a girl like Faith waiting for me when my tour in Vietnam was over.",1231459200,4,948,4.091891891891892

What happens when Cody later searches for the town in the picture Faith included on the Christmas card? And what happens when he has a chance meeting with the woman who sent it? Romance, humor, and drama soon follow.

There is nothing objectionable in this movie and I especially enjoyed the emphasis on Faith's close-knit family. Themes such as loyalty, patriotism, enduring love, longlasting marriage, giving one's life for another, and hope round out this great film. I have added it to my mom-approved movie listing on my blog.

I guess there are a lot of people here who are into sappy movies, but this is just bad.  The acting is terrible and the story is silly.  The premise was nice, but ugh ugh ugh.  So much bad is going on with this movie that I cannot believe they made it.  I did get through it, but ill not be wasting time on movies like this (lifetime movie of the week) ever again.

2901211,5,B000TGUUFA,I loved this movie.  The storyline was great.  I liked the characters and their small town.  Watching this movie makes me want the small town life.  Who would have thought a Christmas card would have caused John Newton's character to seek out the woman who sent the card.  It was wonderful Christmas romance.,1230940800,,308,4.735849056603773

Having said that, I was in a room of 50 people who watched this movie.  They LOVED it.  The women were red eyed with happy tears and the men were only mildly rolling their eyes.

We didn't meet through a christmas card but he was special forces army and we met and fell in love in two weeks! (16 years ago!) The romantic that I am was thrilled to see several similarities in this sweet love story. The commitment to stay in contact with the troops is important and this film provided a good avenue to remind us of that. John Newton's portrayal of Cody was so heartfelt; I fell in love with him, too! great job!!",1230681600,2,546,4.259615384615385

It is good for the whole family because it is a very clean movie with no sex or language. The acting was just ok for me. I felt that Cody could have shown more emotion.

  This is one of the best Christmas movies I have seen in Years.  Ed Asner plays the father and is a very understanding father.
  It is so believable.  It begins with this daughter sending a Christmas card to a soldier in the war zone.
  He goes on leave and  takes the card with him and finds the church in the picture. He is made welcome and the family invites him to their home for the Christmas holiday as he has no family of his own.
  He fits into the family's way of life and of course falls for the daughter.",1229126400,2,669,5.216981132075472
2901224,5,B000TGUUFA,This is the best Christmas movie yet!  I have A Christmas Visitor and thought that was the best.  It is certainly a close second. I watch it over & over and never get tired of it.  The acting is great & the scenery is unbelievable.  I am a sucker for a good military link and this is great!  I love our guys in the service and support them 100%.  This is a good love story and has a good family message behind it.  I would suggest this movie to anyone who has a heart and loves family & Christmas.,1228953600,3,497,3.95959595959596
2901225,1,B000TGUUFA,"I watched this movie last night on TV, and while I love a sappy story (Jane Austen and the like), and good looking soldiers, by half way through I was groaning with the syrupy music, cheesy lines, and really bad acting. The woman who played Faith was way too old for the part, her long-time boyfriend Paul was wooden, and you couldn't help but flinch at their obviously fake kisses. I'll even put up with predictability if the plot is well developed, but this one was just way too obvious. The editing was choppy, and there was a significant lack of care taken in transitions between scenes; there was sufficient ambiguity in the story line to cause confusion as to the number of days or hours that had elapsed between scenes. Overall, it's not bad if you've got an hour or two to waste that you don't care that you'll never get back; it is mildly amusing. The things I applaud are the complete lack of profanity, the portrayal of small-town American Christians as anything but freaks and fakes, and the lack of overt sexuality (although some actual chemistry between the two main characters would have been appreciated).",1228694400,18,1121,4.666666666666667

SOME OF THE SCENES THAT YOU SEE IN THE MOVIE ARE NOT PART OF THE NEVADA CITY LANDSCAPE AND IT RARELY SNOWS THERE BUT IT DOES HAPPEN OCCASIONALLY.  A GREAT STORY ABOUT A WOMAN WHO WRITES CHRISTMAS CARDS TO THE TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN AND IT ENDS UP IN THE HANDS OF A SOLDIER THAT IS ALONE.  HE MAKES A TRIP TO NEVADA CITY AND MEETS THE WOMAN.  YOU KNOW HOW IT WILL TURN OUT BUT THE PATH GETTING THERE IS A JOY TO WATCH.  I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO EVERYONE WHO BELIEVES IN LOVE AND THE MIRACLE OF CHRISTMAS.

2901231,5,B000TGUUFA,"The Christmas Card is one of the best movies to watch as you cozy up on the couch with your favorite hot beverage!!  It is a very clean, ""feel-good"" movie.  I borrow my sister's copy of this movie all the time, and I anticipate purchasing my very own DVD in the near future.

This film is very ""Christmasey"" and very spiritual.  The Spelman Family is a Christian family.  They are faithful, active members at their church in Nevada City. The scenery throughout the movie is beautiful!!! This movie exemplifies the importance of family-being a family and working together as a family.  There are occasional funny moments as well, with Faith Spelman's hilarious Uncle Richard!!  This movie also displays the importance of FAITH, which is the main character's name, and how genuine acts of kindness can be very rewarding in ways you least expect.

However, I do think that the ending could have been lengthened a bit. Although I wasn't too pleased with the ending, it does NOT discourage me from watching the film.

I hope my feedback is helpful!

Happy Thanksgiving 2008!

2901233,5,B000TGUUFA,This is one of the best Christmas Movies released in a long time.  A soldier with literally no one to return home to received a Christmas Card that he treasured.  Upon his release from the service he is compelled to find out who this person is.  Unfortunately he finds that this person is engaged however he was asked by their family to assist at the family business and slowly becomes a part of their lives.  The family has no idea that he received a card from their daughter however come to love him very much.  Watch this movie - better yet purchse the movie because the cool thing is they include a Christmas Card (seriously) that you can write in and that will be sent to a U.S. Troop and who knows can make a difference to someones life.

2901238,5,B000TGUUFA,"This is a sweet love story wrapped up in witty comedy and a very believable story line.  I haven't enjoyed watching a movie so much in years.  I borrowed it from my local library and watched it and sincerely enjoyed it.  From a military standpoint, I thought that the main character did a wonderful job of portraying a soldier both on and off the battlefield.  So often service members have had broken relationships and family and so they are very guarded with any relationship and I really saw that brilliantly portrayed in Cody's character.  I also thought that Faith's character was very cute and did a decent job.  The character of the father, Luke, did a wonderful job and was flat out hilarious and cantankerous.
I think that what really touched me about this story is that this is almost exactly how I met my husband when he was stationed overseas and then, well one day he just ""showed up"" in our little Midwest farm town to meet me... and the rest is history. It made me remember and cry (bah - I hate crying during movies). But I would certainly reccommend this to anyone looking for a good, clean, funny, wonderful movie to enjoy!",1226275200,11,1141,4.541463414634146

2901243,5,B000TGUUFA,"As in other fine Levinson-Halmi productions, there is one scene which is beautifully sensual without being overtly sexual. It will take the breath away from any romantic out there watching ""Where The Magic Begins."" WOW!

From the very first accidental coincidence all the way to the highly anticipated conclusion, the story runs smoothly. All the ""coincidences"" fall into pace quite naturally and none seems contrived or fake. This is an excellent vehicle for Ed Asner in his older years. Although he isn't the star of the movie, Asner plays Luke Spelman, the pivotal character around whom the plot revolves. He leads it well. Peter Jason is great as Richard, and Lois Nettleton is Rosie Spelman, the rather ""ditsy-pollyanna-ish"" wife the role calls for. Ben Weber as Paul is self-absorbed and egotistic, but he is not shallow. He is merely a product of his own environment. With his first appearance, it is obvious that he will never fit into the atmosphere where his fiance, Faith Spelman, dwells. Faith herself must eventually realize that fact and change the courses of several lives. Alice Evans is Faith, a woman with her head in the right place and her heart to soon follow.

It is John Newton as Sgt. Cody Cullen, recently of Afghanistan and on R & R Leave, who steals the show, and rightly so. Only watching this movie several times (and you will !) can enable the viewer to absorb the nuances and subtleties of the script's plot development.

It is a perfect date-flick. John Newton as Cody Cullen is a man's man -- and a woman's dream.

The good news is the story gets a lot better later in the movie. We liked it quite a bit later. Still, nobody knows where he was from days or weeks into the relationship? Ready to leave the church without saying he got a card in Afghanistan? I don't think so! Still, all in all, we liked the movie.",1214438400,2,634,4.24793388429752

This is a good clean family romantic movie for all but the hardest heart. I had a enjoyable evening with a chocked up throat and a few tears and a very good feeling at the end.

It is a Christmas movie that for some reason the television screen has chosen to pass up and the people who love Christmas movies don't know what they missed.  I wish everyone could see it.

It shows that some people truly do show our men and women that we really do honor them and what they are doing for our country and to keep our freedom free. It also shows that 2 people can fall in love over just spending time together. With the help of a Christmas card as well. It also shows that families can still enjoy spending time with each other and love being together, working and daily living. It shows a closeness that very few families have these days. And in the end true love wins. I watched this movie everytime it came on t v and now I own it too.",1198972800,2,629,4.080645161290323
2901282,5,B000TGUUFA,"My 17 year old son and I both enjoyed watching The Christmas Card.  I am always looking for ""family"" movies for our family to enjoy together.  This movie suited us and we were not disappointed in the story line.  The young soldier receives a Christmas card from a young lady in the states whose church sends handmade Christmas cards to the military serving overseas.  The card is a picture of the young lady's home town on the front and she speaks of a beautiful place and invites the person receiving the card to visit for themselves if they are ever out that way.  The soldier witnesses his buddy stepping on a bomb and his friend dies.  He is given leave time back to the states and rides his motorcycle out west to see this beautiful place.  The way the two accidentally meet in the town's diner is unique.  Ed Asner plays the young lady's father in this movie.  The young lady's uncle is hilarious.  The young lady's boyfriend, a wine broker happens into town a the same time as the soldier.  Jealousy sparks him to propose to her after many years of putting off popping the question. Whether or not she accepts his proposal and the events that play out are scenes that you've got to see for yourself.",1198886400,4,1206,4.461187214611872

2901284,5,B000TGUUFA,"The Christmas Card is one of the truely timeless stories we call ""classics."" Ed Asner is at his best. Each of the actors was well cast and are believable in their roles. This also gives you a great idea what you can do to support our troups.

The Christmas Card is one of the two or three best new Christmas stories produced for television in the last three years. It is romantic, dramatic, has some comedy points, AND best of all ... it is based on a true love story. See the special features for a glimpse of the story behind the story.  All of this makes for a warm viewing experience to share with your special someone.

The Northern California City where this was filmed is now a destination spot for honeymooners and romantic getaways.

If you believe that real life can mirror art and that art can mirror life to create those special memories, get The Christmas Card. You won't be disappointed. You will want to see it year after year; a new Christmas Classic - The Christmas Card!",1198800000,2,988,4.441988950276243

2901286,5,B000TGUUFA,"I loved this movie on so many levels. It was good clean and got to the heart of Christmas. And that is that it's centered around Church celebration, charity and loving strangers among us. Besides the leading gal/guy are easy on the eyes, watching the love, laughter and chemistry between them really made this film believeable. I loved Ed Asner as Luke Spellman and the crazy uncle- HE was hilarious! I've watched it with 2 very different sets of people, young 20's and early 40's and both sets of people laughed and found similar charachters within their own families. THAT is what makes this movie. The setting at the Spellman house was so warm/loving. The humor was great and the town folk all seemed to be people that i've seen at other churches. All in all, I rate this movie a perfect 10!

2901291,5,B000TGUUFA,"My husband and I both LOVED this movie!  First of all, even though this is a made-for-TV movie (it still appears occasionally on the Hallmark Channel), the actors are great.  John Newton (Cody) and Alice Evans (Faith) are a very attractive couple.  Faith is blessed with two wonderful parents who love her (and eachother) dearly.  Ed Asner does a great job as Faith's father; he is genuine, humorous and sweet. Her mother is hospitable, fun, and encourages Faith to follow her heart.  Beyond that, the mountain scenery is great, and their home is so warm and inviting that it makes you want to be there. I read the other reviews and I agree that the scene where Faith accidentally falls on top of Cody may be unnecessarily suggestive for family viewing.  It might have been better, for example, if they had regained their balance and kissed while standing.  Another scene that may be challenging for young viewers is when an attack occurs while Cody is serving in Afghanistan.  Having said that, it is still refreshing to watch a movie that is quite innocent in comparison to the majority of other films out there today.  I don't remember there being any profanity in the film, and the storyline is sweet, goodhearted and redemptive.  I, personally, would highly recommend this as a family holiday movie.  However, as with any other film, you may want to watch it first and determine whether it's appropriate to share with your children in light of your values and sensitivities.",1198368000,2,1479,4.8063241106719365

The actors are attractive, the scenery beautiful, everything well meaning, but the music is unrelentingly sappy(none would have been better), the dialogue syrupy (hard to fight back the groans)and the romance/story too much, too obvious, too ""you're going to love this story forever after-ish"".

Good casting.  Maybe I like the movie so much because the part that Ed Asner plays (the jokester husband/father/mill owner) is very much like my own husband.  We laugh ever day!  Alice Evans is young and fresh -- the girl next door and the young Sargent Cody Cullen is handsome (the strong, silent type)  Most importantly, I want to believe that there are people out there who know how to love, how to be generous and kind and how to make Christmas what it SHOULD be.  As an ""Army Brat"", I am very thankful that this movie is not ""bashing"" our military (I'm sick of that!).  God bless our men and women in every branch of the armed forces who defend and protect us -- I am grateful for their sacrifice and service to our Country.

What he finds is a warm welcome by her family and community, and ultimately a new life for himself.

It's always fun to see familiar landmarks and close-to-home shots; somehow it gives you ownership in the film. The film starts with a young woman writing a Christmas card to send to a solider in combat. She mentions her life there, the local church, and expresses her gratefulness for the solider who is fighting for all our freedoms--it touches this solider--and centers around him; he is asked to take some leave from ""the war"" after a solider under his command is killed, and literally dies in his arms. Intrigued by this Christmas card, he travels to Grass Valley, California, in search of the woman who wrote this card. To say more would ruin the film.
