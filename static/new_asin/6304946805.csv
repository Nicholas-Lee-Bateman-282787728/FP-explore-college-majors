940350,5,6304946805,"Jack is back in action and the world definitely needs saving. It's so great to have him back in action and this two hour teaser is a great setup to day 7. Looks like the new president will have her hands full and Jack is back where he belongs - in trouble and trying to redeem himself. If you missed this movie, well...bummer.",1227398400,6,326,4.190476190476191
940351,5,6304946805,"""24:Redemption"", two-hours long TV movie that premiered last night, is a ""bridge"" connecting the last season that ended 18 months ago and the new one which we, the fans of the show have been waiting impatiently and which is scheduled to open in January 2009. The film takes place in real time format, just like all episodes do. After watching it, I am excited about upcoming season and I hope that 24 - Season 7 will be more like season 1 than season 6. Judging by the movie, ""24: Redemption"", there are many reasons for hope. The film is thrilling, gripping, it uses every one of its minutes effectively, and it is much more plausible with its plot and Jack's relations and intentions. It was a good idea to take Jack out of LA and place him in one of hot places on the planet, Sangala, the fictional country in Africa, with very real problems that look too familiar. Jack is back, and he is in great shape, still invincible, resourceful, the man of action who would not lose ability to think clearly and to make the right decision even when being brutally tortured. I am truly sorry that we may not see Robert Carlyle again - the chemistry between him and Sutherland was very real, and their last scene together moved me like not many scenes during all seasons did. But who knows, nothing is what it seems when it comes to 24. Jon Voight's presence promises a creepy dangerous villain, and if the writers of the series keep up with what they did for the movie, we are in for thrilling, entertaining, unforgettable 24 hours from the life of one very special Federal Agent, Jack Bauer.",1227398400,139,1585,4.506944444444445
940352,5,6304946805,Just watched this on FOX and I am glad to see 24 is back in action. It was a very simple story but it was well done and sets Season 7 up for some good Jack Bauer action. Poor guy just can't seem to get a break. Can't wait to see the new season this January!,1227398400,6,257,3.607142857142857
940353,1,6304946805,"Oops, they forgot the B-24 footage! I'm scratching my head and wondering why they titled this three cassette boxed vhs collection ""The B-24 Trilogy"" as the type receives scant screen time. I wish I had thought to time it out as I would be surprised to find it had amounted to more than ten minutes in roughly three hours of running time(I have since gone back to the trilogy and timed-out the B-24 footage, which does come in at just under ten minutes-JD). There is some interesting material on this trio but if I had wanted to watch the story of the ""mulberry"" harbors, for example, I'm sure I could have found a topic specific title. There is also a certain cheese factor involved in that the producers saw fit to use skinny little vhs cassettes recorded on the ""ep"" setting. Bravo! Talk about getting that ""just been gypped"" feeling, I think I'll look elsewhere for any subsequent B-24 or other aviation videos than from this producer.",1092787200,9,938,4.622754491017964

940436,4,6304946805,"4 Stars - Acting, Location, etc. were all outstanding.  I just couldn't rate it as a 5 due to the story line being a bit predictable, even a little slow for an 'action' movie.  Left a lot of the story unfinished (I guess that's how the show was started??)  I don't know, never saw the show - I may watch it, as this wasn't too bad - besides, I'd like to find out about what the President will do when she finds out the truth, and what her son will do when he finds out about what happened to his friend?
But, the ending was so predictable, the guy serving the subpoena was a real scumbag, you knew where that was going to have to end up for Kiefer!",1509321600,,648,4.007751937984496

940464,5,6304946805,"In ""24: Redemption,"" it is certainly heartwarming to observe one of television's consummate tough guys, former CTU Agent Jack Bauer, providing care and mentorship to schoolchildren in the fictional country of Sangala, Africa. Unfortunately for Jack Bauer, trouble and mayhem always seem to find him, and his noble mission of providing a safe and nurturing environment for the children, is hijacked by insurgents seeking to forcibly recruit child-soldiers for their anti-government insurrection. However, as Jack will soon discover, the events in Sangala, Africa are part of a much deeper conspiracy, which ultimately takes him to Washington, D.C., and requires him to foil a diabolical plot against the new President. This turns out to be the story line that serves as a prelude and bridge to Season 7 of ""24."" I found the movie ""24: Redemption"" to be action-packed and exciting, and I give it a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1490313600,5,956,5.296052631578948

940672,5,6304946805,This was a very well crafted movie. It really showed how Africans fare when receiving permission to enter US zones and the dangers they face. The acting in this movie was outstanding by Kiefer Sutherland and Robert Carlyle. I nearly cried when Carl Benton sacrificed himself to save the fleeing African migrants from military training by Juma's troops. This also showed the challenges a president of the USA faces when dealing with a crisis in a place like Sangala. Should we continue to help the African children against the Juma's troops or should we evacuate the embassy which might embolden terrorists? The whole movie was very well done.,1485734400,,642,4.953703703703703

943060,5,6304946805,"This movie is a must for any fan of 24. Once again, the morals, honor and character  of Jack Bauer are.... who he IS, staged in a fictitious  country  in Africa, no resources from CTU, no Chloe even, he's on the run. Do men like ""Jack Bauer"" really exist? I believe so. But when you DO have a family, kids, bills and a mortgage, you either follow the ROE'S of your govornment, or be tried for murder, etc. for making calls and executing them in the field  (READ ""Lone Survivor"") Jack Bauer is plagued  by his own demons, BUT.. would he give his life for a brother? A friend...a child?  That's who he IS, and I believe fans would like to believe  they would do the same, vicariously as it may be. There are soldiers and others who have, unsung and unrecognized except by thier creator.

944450,3,6304946805,The plot was thin and the action limited.  There were none of the plot twists that made the TV show so popular.  It was good to see the character revived at least for a while and I'm sure it had something to do with the continuation of the series through the mini-series and the new production sans Sutherland.  Our ever increasing PC culture lock may result in a very watered down version of the original.  If so it will be a disgrace.  Too many people would have us all watch Sesame Street all day long (with it's noticeable lack of American culture).,1458604800,3,553,4.382352941176471

944873,5,6304946805,"24: Redemption is a film that starts Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer in a fictional region of Sangala Africa.  Bauer is helping  his friend Carl Benton (Robert Carlyle) at a school for war orphans.  The beginning of the movie actually depicts children being controversially used as soldiers.  Anyhow, Bauer is wanted by the United States government and ends up also being unexpectedly drawn into a situation where he has to try to help his friend Benton save the children at the school from getting kidnapped and held against their will to become child soldiers.  Two children had actually been shot trying to run away from some of the men who were trying to round the children up to be employed as soldiers against their will. What complicates matters even further is that the men kidnapping the children against their will are being  financially funded by a shrewd leader named Jonas Hodges (Jon Voight).On the other side of the world  (in the United States) a woman by the named of Allison Taylor (Cherry Jones)is about to be inaugurated as President on the United States by outgoing President Noah Daniels(Powers Boothe) and is being briefed on the situation in Sangala. Of course, there is much more to the quality of the 24:Redemption movie (including more actors/actresses) involved but I must leave out further detail for anyone looking at this who has not yet seen the movie.",1451088000,11,1384,4.888888888888889

Prior to season 7 you are supposed to watch Redemption - which is a 2 hour movie.  While Kiefer Sutherland is always top notch, this episode was a bit disappointing.  There was plenty of violence and plenty of great acting, but the story line was really thin.  It was almost like the movie was a creative way of stitching where season 6 ended and where they wanted to start with season 7.  I'm to understand that this was during the writers strike - so that may be all that it was too.  Unfortunately, if you don't watch Redemption, you'll be lost in season 7.",1412812800,,669,4.304

The ending left you hoping that you blinked and missed the ""to be continued"" caption. The movie uses a very real news story (child soldiers) and a very real news discussion (a woman president) to justify a totally unrelated action. The several threads - rebelion in Africa, presidential inauguration in America, CIA covert actions - are never tied together and remain inconsequential to the story. All it's left is a super-spy killing a handful of guys with machine guns. It makes the ""Expendables"" movies look like classics.

947307,3,6304946805,"It's okay, but not really all that good, even by tv-movie standards.
The whole film is pretty much just a teaser for the next season,
mixed with a generic action film.
It did not feel like 24 at all, was not very interesting
and instead of spending time developing plot points,
they leave almost everything hanging for the upcoming season.

Not like a cliffhanger ending or anything, they''ll just bring up an idea
like *SPOILERS* the child soldier, * and then they'll only spend a few mins here and there exploring the concept.

And the writing was not at all consistent with the way the show is done,
it just boiled down to ""Jack's adventure in Africa"" he did not really do anything to stop a plan, or capture a bad guy,
it felt like about one act of a movie, and for the conclusion, you'll have to sit through 24 more episodes.
They could have just made it a 2-3 part mini series, but instead they just decided to use it to start off the next season.
What a waste, why not just make this the first part of the next season? using multiple episodes instead of a 1.75hr film would give you more to work with..",1404777600,,1109,4.326923076923077

This, was in my opinion, worse than season 2 of the t.v. series. Really...Jack takes on some Hollywood version of Joseph Kony???  I finally stopped the movie when he was bound by his wrists and broke some bad guys neck with the crook of his knee....really?

It would be better to have a Redemption 1, 2, 3,. It really does not explain a lot of the issues such as why is hiding out in Africa, Why is he the scrapegoat, What happened to the President that he was not reelected.

While the plots are somewhat similar, the story line keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Having each episode cover only 1 hour in real time is especially brilliant, because it requires the writers to keep the story moving.",1399334400,,370,4.575757575757576

947739,4,6304946805,"As a 24 fan from the beginning, I watched this to get geared up for the new series coming out this May.  For whatever reason, I missed this back when it was aired as a 2 hour special in 2008 (where has the time gone?).  It contains most of the elements that makes this series great such as interesing characters and an action filled plot.  The villians are some of the best you'll find on TV.

I thought it meandered a bit during the Wash. DC story arc dealing with the president's son.  This is time that could have been better used on Jack kicking terrorist butt.  But alas, they had to give the viewers more plot building for the upcoming season I guess.  Still a great show and was a good thing to stoke the appetite for new series.",1399248000,,736,4.214285714285714

947885,3,6304946805,"24 Redemption (2008) is a two hour event which served as a bridge between the fifth and sixth seasons of 24, the dynamic FOX series, starring Keifer Sutherland, as former CTU agent Jack Bauer.  Unfortunately, although set in a two hour window of real time, Redemption lacks the familiar pulse pounding drive and excitement of the series, and is rather dull in comparison.

After the conclusion of Day 5, Jack Bauer left America, and eventually ended up in the fictional African country of Sangala, staying with his friend Carl Benton (Robert Carlyle), a missionary running a school for young children.  When army forces engage in an operation to recruit the youths, Bauer and Benton attempt to lead the orphans to safety.

Leading a group of young boys, through the African bush, doesnt provide many opportunities for Bauer to engage in his usual heroics.  Bauers limitations are further emphasized, as he is completely without any outside help or technical support.  For those accustomed to the breakneck pace of the series, 24 Redemption is a very pedestrian slog, that ends on a particularly lackluster note.

While Redemption introduces characters who will play key roles in Season Six, primarily President elect Allison Taylor (Cherry Jones), and General Juma (Tony Todd) of the Sangalan army, it probably isn't essential viewing for other than hardcore fans, as the softer less effective Bauer featured here, isn't the same larger than life superhero we are accustomed to seeing.",1398384000,,1485,5.136929460580913
947886,4,6304946805,Watched this on Amazon Prime which I love. This was a good but sad story. Jack Bauer will no doubt be returned to the US and I am sue the new President will intervene for him.,1398211200,,175,3.888888888888889
947887,5,6304946805,"I believe Redemption was between seasons 6 and 7.  It's been a while since I watched those seasons, but Redemption answers some questions I had about the season following it.

Slovakia stands out in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Auschwitz-Inside-the-Nazi-State/dp/B000777JH8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Auschwitz - Inside the Nazi State</a>&nbsp;as being the one country that PAID (500 REICHMARKS) for each Slovakian of Jewish descent that the Nazis agreed to take away to Auschwitz.

So this film/episode of 24 is telling us that African warlords are HANDLED by the Vril because they like their style - always work for psychopaths in the Vril war machine, dontcha know and that children are being kidnapped from target neighboring countries and turned into either rape victims or killers - usually from friendly democratically inclined African nations ... so there goes the future of Africa.  The nice ones are burned away and the bad ones are given work by far more expert Orc.

We like comparing it to the current behind-the-scenes government, and ponder how much we will never know about the political deals and favors that occur.

I couldn't believe it...I had my girlfriend watch it with me and it was her first time seeing the show and now she has no interest in seeing more.

Opens with a telling intro to child soldiers in Africa that is shocking, sad and honest.
Story is primarily shot in Africa as the crew decided that was the best place to get the look and feel.
From the very first scene as we scan across a city, I said to myself I'm convinced this is Africa even before knowing it was shot there.
The primary focus here is on Jack's relationship with and old friend and some African student's at his friends school that are eventually targeted as recruits for a coup army.  Very good interaction and the story develops in real time.
The secondary plot is the background leading into season 7, including the induction of the first female president and some information on who is supplying the money to the coup in Africa.
Typical gun play and explosions and the only one getting tortured is our buddy, Bauer.
Couldn't ask for anything more.

There is also a very touching extra on the issue of child soldiers worldwide provided by experts with letters read by some of the cast of 24.  Some of the kids stories are truly remarkable.",1293667200,2,1170,4.535545023696683

A very effective but violent special forces' agent, running away from the USA where he is wanted for many exploits of his, Jack Bauer is helping out a UN refugee camp for orphans in some difficult country in Africa, is there one that isn't? Then these children become the target of a rebel general who wants them in his army. He tries to kidnap them. Jack Bauer defends them. But the plot sickens at once with American politics. The first woman president has just been elected. The African country concerned is an ally of the US. The outgoing US president has financed, under the table of course, the rebellion against an official ally of the USA in order to create a problem for his successor. Is she really better? Who cares any way. She ends up with her inaugural speech that promises the American people, if they do what they have to do, their patriotic duty, that she will conserve and save democracy and freedom. Where? In hell I guess for the Africans that are sacrificed on the American political chessboard. We wonder after a while who can be interested in seven or eight or maybe twenty if they can seasons of this never ending series that is the most anti-American and anti-humane series I know. Anti-American because it is the Americans who are the only equal people in this world of freedom for the Americans only. It sounds like ""Deutschland ber alles"", Germany above them all. That's not what the American dream is all about. And anti-humane because simple people, individuals, even masses of individuals are nothing but cattle and politics is only how you bring fodder to this cattle or how you slaughter that cattle before they starve to death because there is no fodder, since the fodder has been used to feed the over-fed masters of this world, especially in diamonds and other gold or uranium.

It provides an introduction to some of the key players in the upcoming season, and adds a little context to what will take place there.  It's also a chance to see Jack Bauer outside his normal element (i.e. not facing imminent death every second).  Beyond that, however, it adds little.  Don't run out and buy this thinking you'll be lost without it or missing a key ingredient for season 7.  This movie-length episode lacks the energy and intensity usually found in 24.  You also won't see any of the supporting cast you are used to.  This is strictly for diehard fans who have to have all things Jack Bauer.

949122,3,6304946805,"24 Redemption feels far more like a prequel than a movie unto itself.  Not to take away from its entertainment value, but as a movie it seems to left a number of issues hanging.  For instance, a number of characters are introduced, and given screen time, only for the seeming purpose of letting us know who they are for the season to come.  The basic story of this was very limited to a stand alone story.  Much of the plot (Jack being sought by the U.S. government for acts while in CTU, the dictators in charge of the african people) were not resolved, but left hanging. This being said, the movie is entertaining, with some good action, and likeably new characters.  For purposes of setting up season 7 I was very pleased.

Most importantly it's the direct prequel to season 7 and this movie was originally planned to be part of the 24 series with 12 hours taking place in africa then the next in the U.S.
 This just didn't work out and so we got this movie which introduces us the characters of the next series. So fans of the series need to see this BEFORE series seven; but even nonfans can enjoy the story and acting in this film. It's not a action fest though which upset some 24 fans , however if they just think of this as a insight into the next series (7) then they should enjoy it much more.  Plus we get a insight into the way warriors can deal with the things they have done via Jack Bauer and the character of Benton played by Robert Carlyle. So as a 24 fan I would not dismiss this effort and would like to see some more 24 movies.",1262908800,,1149,3.935344827586207

Well, IMHO this is the two-hour premiere episode for the new season.  Granted, it is not absolutely essential that you watch ""24: Redemption"" in order to appreciate the 24-episode Season 7 -- but if you're reading this you're almost certainly a fan of the series, and if you're a fan you almost certainly can't get enough of _24_.

What has Jack Bauer been doing since the end of Season 6?  You'll find out when you watch ""Redemption"".  And if you happen to be reading this after already beginning to watch Season 7, you can still watch this TV-movie and gain an insight or two into what world events led up to the season's start.

The writing, directing, acting and all other important factors are typical _24_ quality, as you might expect.  The two-hour format (less commercial time in the televised version, but there is also an extended version) gives the creative types a little extra freedom to flesh out the story.  Personally I was a bit disappointed that this was not the big-screen ""24 movie"" I was hoping we'd get, but I suppose that still could happen someday.

If you are a fan of _24_, either you have already seen ""24: Redemption"" or you want to see it.  And if buy the box-sets of each season (you do, don't you?), then you absolutely have to add this to your collection.  Get it.  You won't regret it.",1234396800,3,1428,4.600790513833992

FOX cleverly ties together the end of the somewhat trite and disappointing Season 6 and the new Season 7.  Bauer's been on the move and is in the not-too-fictional African country of Sengala.  Well...from humanitarian to freedom-fighter for Jack; meanwhile, back in the States...we have our new Madame President (Cherry Jones) sworn in after a 'kind' word or two from the outgoing President (the always slightly sinister Powers Boothe)...tick tick, tick tick...to corruption in high places in the government, masterminded by Jon Voight.  Lookin' good for the regular Season 7 start in January...oh yes, it's started already...and Season 7 so far, after 6 hours, is living up to the hype and punches up the visceral excitement that 24 at its best delivers better than any show has this century!",1233014400,3,912,5.10738255033557

Awesome is the answer to these questions.  Season 6 had me wavering as a 24 fan.  Granted I still think the character is great, but Season 6 was just plagued with bad writing!  Jack's dad was the cause behind the problems way too many times for it to be shocking by the end and it lost that edge of your seat action feel without the shocking conclusions.

Anyway ""Redemption"" has Jack on the run, which is no secret to those who saw the end of last season.  Apparently he's already fled to a bunch of different places and we finally catch up with Jack in Africa.  It does sort of feel like a clich rip off of the ""Blood Diamond"" story in some respects, but honestly they managed to keep me entertained well enough.  This really isn't a movie by any stretch of the imagination; this is more of a prequel to Season 7.  Which, judging by the way this ended, should be a very interesting season.  I won't really give much more than that away as the story is very intriguing and was as action packed as you'd expect from 24.

With missing a whole year of 24, I think this prequel was a great idea in order to bring people up to speed with the next season and to give more depth to Jack's character.  The new setting with the war torn Africa was a pretty good choice in my opinion and definitely kept viewers on the edge of their seat, as 24 is supposed to do.  At this point I don't think anyone who isn't a fan already will pick this up, so if you're a fan of the show I can't imagine you wouldn't find this enjoyable.",1232496000,27,1684,4.154320987654321

But there is much more than this at play. Jack is looking for peace, for resolution for his life; for redemption. The country he loves has taken everything from him but his life - and now he is wanted in America to stand trial before the U.S. Senate.

949409,4,6304946805,"I've been watching 24 since the very beginning of Season 1, and it has always been my favorite show. Even though Season 6 had it's flaws, I still enjoyed it.

It's true though that 24 needs a breath of fresh air. Season 6, while good, was basically a rehash of all the things Jack has gone through for 7 seasons. I liked for th emost part that the focus was on Jack, and we weren't bogged down with various subplots involving killer ex-girlfriends who are really moles for some scheming political person, etc etc. Though there were hints of that throughout this movie, it was mainly to setup the events of Season 7.

I noticed a few different shooting tactics and a little different acting here and there. We don't really get an incredible back story on how Jack got to africa and how he befriended Benton, but we do understand Jack is on the run.

I liked Redemption, but didn't love it. For a ""tv movie"" I could have used a little more action, a couple more fights, a little more intensity. Especially since they've packaged it as a stand alone DVD. There was one realy notable scene, and that was the school raid where you see Jack at his best, but other than that, nothing was really too intense or stood out incredibly well.

If you didn't know a bit of the backstory you could somewhat understand that the main character is on the run, but to really get the most out of it you'd need to know a little about Season 6.

I'll say that I most enjoyed Jack and the movie itself when it was in Africa. I felt it was a nice breath of fresh air and we got to see Jack in a completely different environment that what we are used to. I'm not sure how much more we'll get to see of that since Jack seems to be headed back to America, but since no loose ends were tied up with the villians in Africa I think they'll be back.

This season really needs to ruffle and change things up I think, for 24 to really continue. It looks like it has all the makings of that, with what has been setup so far and judging from the previews. But like we learned from the last few seasons, it's easy for them to fall into the same old trap. There always seems to be a mole, chloe always seems to be going behind CTU Head's back, there is always some silly subplot with an ex girlfriend somewhere who is now an insider, etc. 24 is always at it's best when Jack is on screen and that's what I enjoyed about this movie. Jack is giving a good bit of screen time to shine. I wish it would have been more about him and less about setting up the 7th season, but I'm not dissapointed in the movie.

As for the DVD itself, it's pretty good. Nothing stellar. I bought it for 5 bucks more at target which sucks, but for 15 bucks it's not bad. There's nothing really outstanding on the disc, a political ""featurette"" about trouble in Africa, and a little commentary, but nothing special. This disc is mainly for people already familiar with 24 and fans of the series. If you've never seen 24 before and happened upon this, you'll surely enjoy it as a movie if you know a little bit of the backstory. A season 6 ""recap"" is on the disc so you can get up to speed.

To me 24 has always been the best show on tv. I like it's random bursts of violence and the twists and intrigue. Other shows like Law & Order and the Unit tend to get preachy on the ""doo gooder"" side of things, but 24 doesn't care. It will let you know that when it comes to protecting America, Jack will rip of terrorists eyes out before he let's harm come to it. They've never been apologetic about that and have never backed down to ""demands"" from people to tone it down, and that's why it's going strong for 7 seasons.",1230422400,2,3651,4.2057142857142855

949505,2,6304946805,"Let me start by saying that I love ""24."" I love each season for its own particular strengths. I even loved Season 6, with all of its flaws. But as for ""24: Redemption,"" I can only say that it's...OK. Granted, the producers had a pretty big hurdle to overcome from the outset, with 18 months of anticipation having built up. But the movie was operating under so many constraints that it never developed any of the depth that makes the series more than just an action show. It was as if the producers were expecting us to be so wowed by the exotic African and DC locations that we wouldn't notice that the story was weak. Having Jack trying to rescue a group of poor, oppressed African children was not only stereotypical, but it tried to play on the sympathies of the audience in the most blatant manner imaginable. Having the child soldier pointing a rifle at Jack while repeating ""Kill the cockaroach"" over and over, before running away in terror at the supposed power of Jack's words, gets my vote as probably the worst moment ever in any episode of ""24."" And, of course, they managed to cram in the obligatory torture scene from which Jack immediately recovers without missing a beat. I think the main problem was that they tried to give us two storylines in only two hours. They usually have 24 hours in which to develop a story. As a result, neither plot-line really ever went any place interesting. If the makers of ""24"" ever return to their idea of making a ""24"" feature film, they really need to learn some lessons from this experiment, because for me it proved that ""24"" can't work in a two-hour format without some serious overhaul. After all, everyone knows that Jack and company (except for those who get offed) are eventually going to stop the terrorists, before the season even starts. It's the little moments that make ""24"" great for me. I love it when Mandy the assassin is reduced to tears by the death of her girlfriend, while she stands in the crosshairs, in the first season. I love the conversation that Senator Palmer has with the two vandals who break his windows in Season 1. I love Palmer's impeachment in season 2, and the pained look on Mike Novick's face throughout. I love the final moments between Jack and Chappelle in season three. I love Michelle's farewell to Gael, also in season three (probably my favorite season). I love it when Jack robs the convenience store in season four. I love the look on Lynn McGill's face as he helplessly watches a fellow CTU agent die, in season five. And I love it when Assad says ""You've taken the wrong path, Shaheed"" as he kills the friend who betrayed him in season six. These are the kinds of moments you lose when you have to strip everything down to two hours, and for me, ""Redemption"" showed that the action and intrigue alone aren't enough to make it stand out from the plethora of similar shows and movies. I'll leave my critique at that. I'm sure that other diehard ""24"" fans will end up buying the DVD, anyway, but for those who are new to ""24,"" I'll just say that this is not the best starting point. Stick to the series. And I hope that Season 7 ends up being much better than this.",1229644800,41,3163,4.493055555555555

The DVD features are absolutely worth it.  You get both the broadcast version and an extended edition, plus commentary with Kiefer, the director and the screenwriter.  There's a boatload of extras on top of that.

There was plenty of cheese and action flick camp, but at its heart this is a sincere look into the kind of psychological impact and moral ambiguity that men like Jack Bauer have to deal with as a result of their chosen profession.  Is it exaggerated for dramatic effect?  Of course.  But make no mistake that there really are men in this world who make the kind of choices these guys make, and suffer for fulfilling their duty.

As a prequel, this is a fantastic set-up to Season 7.  Overall I felt this was a beautiful insight into Jack's character, something the show normally doesn't have time to do.  It was also a heart-wrenching look at the reality of child soldiers.  The DVD includes a special about that topic and talks about ways you can help.

If you love 24, buy this DVD.  You won't regret it at all.",1229299200,,1174,4.425233644859813
949508,5,6304946805,"It has been two years since we have seen the likes of Jack Bauer and with the highly anticipated season 7 of the popular FOX drama ""24' coming back on FOX in Jan. 2009, what better than to kick the new season off with a two-hour special.

The question of what has happened to Jack Bauer after the events of Season 6 is answered in this special.

""24: Redemption"" is just an awesome two-hour special that features great storytelling, beautiful scenery but also a lot of action.

This has to be unprecedented for a TV drama to film in another country but also including the Africans in the actual special as actors (and you can learn much more through the director's commentary on the DVD).

As always, Kiefer Sutherland is always impressive as Jack Bauer and great performances throughout the board.  The African children did a great job in their roles and I give credit to the ""24 staff for bringing in actor John Voight to play the role as the corrupted person in the government.

As mentioned, the cinematography capturing the scenery was just great.  The staff managed to capture the beauty and danger of Africa despite the many challenges faced during the shooting schedule.  I was truly impressed.

The storyline was just engaging, action-packed and thrilling from start to finish.  Needless to say, I can't wait for Season 7.

As for the DVD, the DVD features two versions of ""Redemption"".  The broadcast version and the extended version which has over 10 minutes of extra footage).  The extra footage are mainly dialogue between the incoming President and outgoing President and scenes that primary taking place in Washington.  You can learn more about the additional scenes from the actual commentary.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""24: Redemption"" is featured in widescreen 1:78:1.  The picture quality is vibrant..  Especially when you see the differences of the Africa and the US scenes.  Africa is featured in amber/Earthy hues and looks beautiful.  While the US has a colorful but a different sense color which leans more towards dark bluish hues.  Video quality looked vibrant and colorful.

As for audio, the show is featured in Digital 5.1 Dolby Surround.  Really good audio quality during the fighting sequences in Africa.  Otherwise, the special features mostly dialogue and the dialogue can be heard quite clearly.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

I admit that I was happy to see quite a few specials included on the DVD.  Special features are:

  * The Making of 24: Redemption Featurette - This featurette is about 20 minutes long and is actually very good.  Especially if you are a filmmaker.  Director Jon Cassar, writer Howard Gordon and staff are interviewed on how it was to film in Africa but the challenges that they faced.  I was surprised to see how the weather would change in an hour-time. They could be filming and then all of a sudden, they get high winds (up to 60mph), then rain and hail and then sunlight.  So, it was definitely a challenge for them to film but they managed to do it.  But also, an advantage to work with people in South Africa in developing certain mechanical systems for the terrain and also interviews with the African talent.

  * ""Blood Never Dry"": Child Soldiers in Africa Featurette - In this featurette, cast from the upcoming Season 7 would read a letter from a child soldier and also a featurette that tries to explain why children are being kidnapped and becoming soldiers.  And the trauma they go through and not wanting to go home because they have committed atrocity to so many innocent people that they are deeply burdened by it.  Also, how the militias get these children so addicted to drugs.  This was a very good featurette and truly an eye opener of what is currently going on in Africa.

  * Commentary by Executive Producer/Director Jon Cassar and Executive Producers Howard Gordon and Kiefer Sutherland - The commentary was also enjoyable to listen to.  From filming of the scenes to the three talking about various actors and actresses and their experience filming the special.  Also, this is probably how one would learn about scenes that are in the expanded version and are not shown on the broadcast.

  * 24 Season 6 in Four Minutes Featurette - For those who missed or forgot what Season 6 is about.  This featurette features what happened during that season in four minutes.

  * An Exclusive First Look at 24 Season 7 - I was very impressed by the first 15 minutes of the upcoming ""Day 7' episode of ""Season 7' which will start the ""24' series in Jan. 2009.  A lot of action and what I can I say... Tony Almeida.  It's starts off awesome and I craved for more!

I have been watching the ""24' series since the first episode and have always been hooked on the series. But this special was one of the finest ""24' storylines and I'm glad to see that the staff went all out in filming this special.  Especially bringing the staff and filming it in Africa was just impressive. ""24' has always been a drama series that has long been admired because it has set the marker so high for a television drama series.

As for this DVD, not only was it fun to watch but if you are a film student or a person that enjoys watching ""24: Redemption"", you'll have a blast on watching how the special was created but most of all certain elements of nature that the staff had to contend with.  Especially during the rain and making it look like sunlight and also the high winds that the staff had to block out during the recording.

Also, a thumbs up for the staff including the featurette on child soldiers. This featurette was definitely an eye-opener and I was really surprised to hear the chilling words from those who soldiers who are in agony of the deaths they have caused and the permanent guilt they have to live with.

And of course, that sneak peak to excite the ""24' fan for a month until the Season 7 begins.

Overall, if you are a ""24' fan, this DVD has so much to offer.  You won't be disappointed!",1229126400,2,5949,4.649712092130518

Jack is terrific as always.  He is helping a friend out at an orphanage he runs in Africa.  There is a civil war in progress and the children are targeted.  Enter Jack Bauer and watch out bad guys.

949571,5,6304946805,"Let's be honest; a majority of us were holding our breath, recalling the note 24 left off on, remembering the strike and how long it's been since the last time Jack embarked on a mission to protect the greater good. '24: Redemption' was promoted as a movie that would connect Seasons 6 and 7 and lead us into a new era of the show.  For me, it turned out to be a lot more than that.

This bridge had a back story I could relate to as well as any prior '24' theme. Many of us have been victimized by that empty feeling like we're unappreciated, that we have no one to turn to and that our life's purpose hasn't been fulfilled. You're immediately led to believe that this is what has brought Jack Bauer to Sangala, that he's emotionally broken and wandering from place to place searching for himself, searching for a way to escape his past, elude his government and find a new start. Just prior to his next move, he gets caught up in an aggressive pursuit for soldiers of a slave army designated to fight for a shift of power in Sangala.

While the vintage '24' action at times is scarce, you still get your full dose in the few fight scenes. Jack takes on General Benjamin Juma's right hand man, Colonel Ike Dubaku, and their army in an effort to protect a school of children, including those of an old friend, from being recruited as soldiers. So what do we find out? You can't teach an old dog new tricks. Jack Bauer may be searching for peace, but he's still a trained killer and a man who fights to maintain world order.

For me, the first sign that this wouldn't be a disappointment was when you found out it was still done in real time. Led to believe it was structured like an ordinary movie, I wondered how differently '24' would play out minus the clock. However, I was pleased to discover that this two hour event had all the bells and whistles that has made 24 riveting over the years, and hopefully more epic than ever in the coming seasons. This was a fantastic teaser and bridge from Seasons 6 to 7. What amazed me most about it was that aside from President Daniels and Tom Lennox, who we only met in Season 6, there were no old '24' characters. However, Jon Voight is sure to bring some fireworks to the show. I'm looking forward to the familiar faces of Chloe O'Brien and Kim Bauer among others come January. It should be a great year for the best show on TV.

Grade: A-",1227571200,3,2386,4.305122494432071
949572,4,6304946805,"Well That was precisely what Jack Bauer wanted to do for the rest of his tourmented life. Unfortunatly for him but fortunatly for us he is forced back in action for this Prequel to Season 7 of one of the most suspensful TV series ever.

The change of location was a plus to me (The movie all takes place in Africa and Washington DC) and I loved the new characters (the kids are very good, Jon Voight I love).

I want to add that the soundtrack was much better than usual (the woman vocalization adds a little sentiment to the regular suspense and synthetiser music) and is really beautiful on the sad parts of the show!

The photography is excellent and as the movie was actually shot is africa they really took advantage of that.

As they added about 10 extra minutes to the TV episode I'll run to buy this DVD to enjoy the show even more!

And of course I just can't wait for January and the real begining of season 7 hoping it will be as good as the 2nd and 5th (which were the best to my taste, but what do I know I am French after all! hehe!)

Good luck Jack and may CTU be with you! : )",1227571200,3,1092,4.079439252336448
949573,4,6304946805,"In the last year, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) has seen the world.  No, he's not on vacation; he's running from a subpoena calling him to testify before Congress about his use of torture over the years.

Most recently, he's landed in the African country of Sengala where he's helping a friend named Carl Benton (Robert Carlyle) with his school for orphaned boys.  When the subpoena catches up with him, Jack plans to move on.  But before he can, the rebels make a play for the boys, planning to force them into becoming soldiers in their bid to over throw the government.

Meanwhile, back in the States, the first female President, Allison Taylor (Cherry Jones) is about to be sworn in.  While she clashes with outgoing President Daniels (Powers Boothe) over the situation in Sengala, her son is approached by a friend wanting help with a sticky situation at his job as a stock broker.

What does that have to do with Jack's situation?  And can Jack get the boys to safety?

This TV movie was created to bridge the gap between the disappointing sixth season and the delayed (due to the writer's strike) seventh season.  It does a good job of setting things in motion, but as such it feels incomplete to me.  Normally, the first episode of every season is slow as we catch up with our characters.  Here, that takes up too much of the time.  The happenings back in Washington DC were interesting, but they didn't seem to do anything but set up storylines for season seven.  And, in a show known for its twists, this movie was fairly predictable.  There was only one real twist.

Now, being a 24 fan, I won't say I was completely disappointed.  The action here seemed better than what we got last season.  Jack also seems to be more on an even keel, which might help.  And I was certainly entertained the entire time.

And for those wondering, outside of a brief prologue, the events do occur in real time.

The threads set in motion here could be interesting once next season premiers.  And fans of the TV show will certainly enjoy it.  I know I did.  But this isn't the best the franchise has to offer.",1227571200,2,2103,4.531914893617022

It's an awesome build up to the next season. If you love 24, you'll love 24: REDEMPTION!!!",1227571200,,466,4.367816091954023
949575,3,6304946805,"It's been a long time coming.  Due to the Writer's Strike last year, the 24 team decided to hold off it's seventh season until the following year, in order to air a full, twenty-four episode season with no breaks on time.  It was probably a wise decision, but at a really bad time for the series.  The last we saw protagonist Jack Bauer and his ever changing cast of friends was in the sixth and by far the worst season of the series, so a lot of the fans were already on the fence.  The leaking of certain Season Seven spoilers made it seemed like 24 was delving even further into the cheesy soap opera plots that made up the sixth season.  Now, 24 returns with an original TV movie, a very hyped event that acts as a bridge between last season and the upcoming seventh season.  I was skeptical, for all the reasons listed above, but hoped the once brilliant team behind 24 would remind me how great that show used to be.  So what's the verdict?

Eh.

Not bad.  Certainly not good enough to win back whatever viewers they lost last season.  The story seems to be caught between ""unimportant prequel"" and ""standalone story,"" and that lack of focus is a bit overpowering.  Instead of focusing on Jack Bauer's redemption, which we fans were lead to believe would be the focus of the film, a lot of time is spent developing the political angle of the upcoming season, as well as developing a few bureaucratic villains that do little on screen but plot and twist their sizable mustaches.

The stuff that did go on with Jack was okay.  The fight scenes weren't the best of 24, nor did the team go as far with the action OR character development as they should have in the first ever 24 TV movie, but there were a few impressive touches of character development.  The basic plot involves Jack helping an old friend with a school he's set up in Africa (specifically, the made-up nation of Sangala).  Things quickly get ugly when a team of rebels attacks the school, wishing the recruit the children into their army, forcing Jack to jump into action and save the kids.  This forces Jack to come out of hiding, and-in efforts to rescue the children-surrender himself to America, who he's been on the run from since the end of Season Six.  That'll be addressed in Season Seven, and I thought that part of the plot was really well done, as it worked well with the theme of the movie and also gave the next season a perfect launching point.

A few other good bits were the relationship between Jack and one of the young children, Willy.  We got to see the soft side of Jack again, which is always nice.  Carl Benton, played by Robert Carlyle, was a great addition to the cast, and his performance as the teacher/hero of the students was particularly riveting.  I wish I had something good to say about any of the other plots going on outside of Sangala, but the political scenes were basically old hat for 24.  I recognize that, in doing a prequel for a season that has already been shot, there are really tight limits as to what you can do, but I feel like there was a lot of expectation that 24: Redemption just didn't meet.  I'll certainly tune in for Season Seven, but I'm still as skeptical as ever.

949576,5,6304946805,"This is classic 24 and Jack is back at his best.  I am excited with the set up for the next season of 24.  So basically in Redemption you have all the basic Bauer elements:  Jack is somewhere he probably shouldn't be;  An unlikely, but usually heartwarming, bond is forged;  Bad guys are starting to wreck things;  Jack has to protect some people and kills a ridiculous amount of the bad guys before getting captured himself;  Of course Jack is then tortured - but soon after, with a little help, escapes and does the only thing that can usually enrage every bad guy - killing his brother;  So bad guys are on his trail and then, of course, someone close to Jack dies or sacrifices himself.  In the end, however, Jack makes an ultimate sacrifice to do the right thing.  That's the formula Redemption follows and that's basic 24 at its best.  Season Seven is well on its way with this...",1227484800,3,886,4.440993788819876
949577,5,6304946805,"It was so great to have Jack Bauer back. God, what did I do for the last 1.5 years with my time? It helped that season 6 was lame, so that missing my favorite hero wasn't as painful as there was certainly a reluctance to see the 24 team fall even further in season 7.

With 24: Redemption there's no doubt that the pre-s6 24 and the beloved Jack Bauer is back. He is a changed man. Not a man who's been redeemed, but a man who has had an incredibly hard time outrunning his past and his future. He is rough on his training and can no longer kill 50 men single-handedly. He still aims, shoots, ad hits more than 9 out of 10 times, but he is clearly showing his age and the wear and tear on his morality.

When JB screams, ""You leave me no choice!"" you know we have no choice but to watch and wait for two more months with excitement and anticipation. Unless, of course, you buy the DVD tomorrow and watch the first 17 minutes of the first hour of season 7. Who isn't planning to do that?",1227484800,3,986,4.051282051282051
