8078299,5,B000AEN9B8,"I loved this DVD!  If you are a train enthusiast, then you will also love this DVD.  After viewing it, I felt I could actually operate a steam locomotive effectively.  In volume one, they start out with a smaller steam engine, where you learn about what all the valves do, and how the steam boiler actually works.  You get to see the inside of the firebox and the smoke box.  Everything is explained in detail, how and why it works.  They show the crew starting the fire with wood and kerosene, then switching to coal.  The johnson bar is explained, along with the air brakes, and throttle.  All the different classifications of train engines are explained, as well as the train whistle signals.  You get to view the crew as they move down the track, operating the steam engine, while explaining each and every move they make with levers and valves.  In volume two, a larger steam locomotive is shown, which runs on atomized oil.  They, of course, go through all the valves, and show how to run the locomotive.  In volume three, the largest of the steam locomotives, like the Big Boy, etc. are shown, with an automated auger to spray the firebox with a continuous flow of coal.  In this one, they actually explain what the hand signals mean that the brakeman uses to give instructions to the engineer.  Overall, a great DVD, with so much information, that I had to watch all the volumes twice to learn it all!",1425600000,,1409,4.5396825396825395

8078301,5,B000AEN9B8,"I am truely impressed by the knowledge of the crew.  It was enlightening to learn the inner workings and engineering genius that is included in the steam locomotive.  It is really a full time job for each the fireman and the Engineer, with constant attention required to keep the monsters running well.  These three films and the additional fourth one give a thorough insight into the steam locomotive.",1387843200,,402,4.882352941176471
8078302,5,B000AEN9B8,"I bought this for my father-in-law for Christmas last year, and he loves it!  It's sometimes not easy shopping for an 80 year old man who is trying to downsize his home, but as he's a train enthusiast, I couldn't resist, and I was right!  It's a nicely in-depth show about the actual running of steam locomotives.",1373760000,2,313,4.473684210526316
8078303,4,B000AEN9B8,"An informative video about the operation of railroad steam locomotives.  The video is older and a bit dated, but still informative.",1353196800,3,131,5.238095238095238
8078304,5,B000AEN9B8,"Awesome set of DVDs!  They cover in detail how they work and how to operate them.  From the boiler to the brakes to the whistle signals to the gauges and knobs you will see how to run a steam locomotive.  From a small switching 0-4-0 locomotive to the 4-8-4 UP 844 Big Boy engine and several in between.

A must-have for railroad enthusiasts!",1291420800,8,342,4.380952380952381
