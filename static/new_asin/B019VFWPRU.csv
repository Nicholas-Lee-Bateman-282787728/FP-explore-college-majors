8748981,5,B019VFWPRU,"Terrific little indie about the black market organ trade. Not at all what I was expecting. A nice, slow burn thriller with strong performances, direction, photography, and screenplay. It really makes you think. Good stuff.",1484956800,,222,5.371428571428571
8748982,5,B019VFWPRU,"Looking for Lions is a thought-provoking story of irresponsible young love, the agony of imminent loss, and decisions that irreversibly change the course of life.  Mia (Chelsea Gilligan) and Ray (Todd Julian) are young dreamers struggling each day to subsist.  Justifiably fired from his job as a bakery deliveryman, Ray unknowingly stumbles into a high-paying position as courier for questionable products from an underground organization.  Emmett (Norman Lesperance) is a dedicated and honorable worker hopelessly seeking a solution to his beloved wifes heart disease.  As a co-worker reveals a potential but costly recourse, Emmett makes a desperate decision that ultimately intersects with Ray and Mias terrifying delivery.  The writing, acting and direction of this heart-rending thriller are exceptional.  You cannot watch this film without asking, What would I do in that situation? This was my hands-down favorite from the Austin Film Festival, and Ive been eagerly awaiting its release on DVD.",1465084800,,1002,5.602649006622516
