8505503,5,B006WCGHWU,"American Pie meets Requiem for a dream, in 70's Austria/Germany.  It even has a champagne taco!  Or whatever the German equivalent would be.  Oh, and it may have been filmed at an Ikea.",1459987200,,185,4.545454545454546
8505504,5,B006WCGHWU,"A true Amazon Prime treasure for the devotees to deepcore film sickness. This is Die Schulmdchen vom Treffpunkt Zoo by George Boos in 1979, the very first movie to adapt the famous book about teenage prostitution for drug addiction that was later adapted by Uli Edel in 1981 as Christiane F and again by Rino Di Silvestro as Hanna D - The Girl from Vogel Park in 1984. What is very strange about Train Station Pickups is how it attempts to balance the dominant elements of the two better known adaptations: it mixes the gritty drama of the heroin teens like in Christiane F, even having some scenes that were even grislier, with the sexploitation of Hanna D, though these scenes are presented in a lighter T & A style which is in direct contrast with the murky plot points. Altogether a hilarious and disturbing cult flick, barely released in North America and completely unavailable except good old Amazon Prime. Channel 83 says watch this one tonight.",1459900800,,953,4.712574850299402
8505505,4,B006WCGHWU,"Shameless rip-off of other films, but still a very fun watch, due to the fact it is filled with authentic, likable characters. Just be aware that is basically exploitation and is filled with nudity and sexual situations, most of it dealing with girls who seem not quite legal.",1438041600,3,276,4.770833333333333
8505506,1,B006WCGHWU,"poor acting, terrible plot, grainy, all around bad movie. WHY DOES MY REVIEW HAVE TO BE THIS LONG, WHY, WHY?",1363219200,2,108,4.45
8505507,1,B006WCGHWU,Impossible to watch!  The people talk and ten seconds later their lips move!  It is the single factor that will make us turn a show off even if the plot is good.,1360627200,2,161,4.0
