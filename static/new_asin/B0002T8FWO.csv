2119020,1,B0002T8FWO,Undersatnd you get what you pay for.  The video quality of this DVD is poor.  There are a number of scratches on the film and the picture shakes as if a camcorder was used to transfer the movie.  If you are a fan of the movie it is better to pay a few bucks more and get a better copy.,1115251200,,285,3.716666666666667

The film begins in 1854 at the West Point Military Academy. [The names of the cadets will be famous in the War Between the States.] There is political conflict between some cadets. Should the southern plutocrats continue to rule? The Commandant warns them against lying to benefit a friend, a danger even in peacetime. Rader is discharged for his abolitionist propaganda. Upon graduation some will be sent to Fort Leavenworth. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis tells them of the importance of defending the nation. Will Kansas join the nation as a free state? On the train some men try to abduct some passengers! The slavery conflict is the cause of ""Bleeding Kansas"".

Fort Leavenworth is the beginning of the trail to Santa Fe and its lucrative trade. The Army escorts wagon trains. The happy workers sing as they leave. John Brown organizes his supporters to abolish slavery. Will they attack a wagon train like robbers? Brown collects the boxes of ""bibles"" for his missionary work. There is a running chase with gunfire. The Army will search for John Brown's gang and attack them. A prisoner tells where the gang is located. A shipload of ""salt pork"" arrives in Palmyra. Rader provides military training to Brown's men for a price. Will Brown's gang attack another town? Will JEB Stuart scout the town of Palmyra, the terminal of the Underground Railroad? Will his horse tell on him? John Brown explains his strategy to abolish slavery through bloodshed.

Stuart escapes from Brown's gang while the barn catches fire. The Cavalry rides to the rescue. Brown and a few of his men escape. Are they finished? The Army officers are recalled to Washington. An Indian prophet predicts their future: they will become enemies in a war that has already begun. They laugh! John Brown has a new plan for a glorious end. He will attack the Arsenal at Harper's Ferry and use the arms to free the slaves. Will John Brown pay his debts to Rader? Historical figures are used in the story. Will somebody squeal? The last part of the film recreates John Brown's raid. [Did Brown have that many supporters?] Brown's promised support didn't show up, but US armed forces did. Guns neutralized the brick walls. The defenders are overwhelmed. JEB Stuart personally captures John Brown. Brown is tried and condemned for treason. Brown predicts a coming storm and the film ends.

Hollywood produces entertainment, not history. George Armstrong Custer is one of the most famous Americans, in the mid-1850s he was a school teacher in Ohio and didn't graduate from West Point until 1861.",1511308800,,2577,4.9036697247706424

8031604,5,B0002T8FWO,"Wonderful film that could have been great had the last couple of minutes hit the editing room floor.  Also, a personal gripe, Amazon has more than one edition of their Amazon Prime movies.  After 15 minutes of watching their (free) edition of this film, I went scurrying through my parlor looking for a copy that I purchased years ago...without luck.  It's as if a few Amazon streams are copied from a VHS to a DVD recorder using a lawn mower muffler for sound control.  A couple of days ago, I found Amazon offering their (Restored Edition) of Santa Fe Trail.  Paying $99.00 a year for Prime, I thought why not toss another $2.50 at them to see if the ""Restored Edition"" was hype or a true improvement.  The difference in quality was remarkable.  The moral of the story is, many films would be better showing less, and that $99.00 a year does not necessarily indicate enjoyable viewing.",1456012800,2,887,4.611464968152866
