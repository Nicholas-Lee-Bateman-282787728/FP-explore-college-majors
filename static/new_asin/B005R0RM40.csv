8483954,4,B005R0RM40,"The British Film Institute is cleaning up many rare 60's British films and releasing them on pal form dvd or Blu-ray, and luckily for us, in regions viewable here in the US, like this rarely seen Olivia Hussey film ALL THE RIGHT NOISES.

All The Right Noises is a very rarely seen 1969 film starring a 17 year old Olivia Hussey (fresh off of 1968's Romeo and Juliet), 29 year old Judy Carne (Laugh In and Love On A Rooftop fame) and Tom Bell (The L-Shaped Room). Tom Bell and Judy Carne play married couple Len and Joy Lewin. Len is a lighting expert for stage and commercials and his wife Joy is an actress who does commercials. Len and Joy seem happily married with their 2 children and modest London flat, until Len notices a beautiful stage actress Val, played by Olivia Hussey.

Whenever he can, Len see's Val after they are both finished with the musical they are both working in. Len has no idea that Val is a 15 1/2 year old school girl, but you will be amazed at his reaction when he finds out. I really enjoyed seeing the changes in Val (Olivia Hussey) as she grows up so quickly. Revisiting 1969 London was wonderful and seeing the beautiful Olivia Hussey and Judy Carne play the women in Len (Tom Bell's life) was very fascinating. You just don't know if Judy Carne knows something or not.

There are great extras as well- A beautiful 30 page booklet, and Special DVD Features: The Blu-ray disc is cleaned up beautifully; Interviews with such a young cigarette smoking teen age Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting from 1967 when they are filming Romeo And Juliet (16 min) and The Spy's Wife- a rare 28 min film from 1972 starring Tom Bell and Ann Lynn.

Len says ""As long as you know when to pick up your cues and make all the right noises, women don't notice things"", thinking his wife will never know about Val. But, I'm not sure about that, as you watch his wife Joy (Judy Carne) towards the end. For any one that enjoys rare late mod 60's films, seeing the beautiful young Olivia Hussey and Judy Carne together is a treat. The extras are the icing on the cake, especially the Hussey/Whiting interview.",1339977600,4,2115,4.443298969072165
