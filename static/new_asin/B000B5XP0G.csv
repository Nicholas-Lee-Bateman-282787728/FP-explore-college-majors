2400323,5,B000B5XP0G,"Please Teacher is the best romance comedies to come out since Love Hina. The show is about Kie  who has a slight problem. He has a condition where in he enters into a state of suspended animation whenever he is stressed or depressed. One time his condition hits so hard that he was in that state for three years. Though by the end of the second ep you may think this is just a gimmik to allow him to marry his teacher, I'll get to that, its not really and is used quiet skillfully threw out the series. Meet Meazuhoe an alien, who has come to earth to observe our civilization. Kie finds out Meazuho's secret and one thing leads to another until finally they end up married. I know what your thinking porn coming. Your wrong for the most part. This is actually a sweet series that though is does have its perverted moment, especially the last ep, is actually quiet innocent. The touching story, perviness aside, about a guy with a unquic condition that ends up getting married to a complete stranger and how they fall in love. I found myself actually liking the characters and caring about them. When something sad happened I actually felt sad as well. No character is left out in the cold and each has a reason for being the way they are. The animation is some of the best I've seen, the music is wonderful and the story worth listening. This series is so good that its hard to describe just how good it is. Simply if your wondering about buying this series or not if you want heart stopping action or ground shattering mysteries or ultra pervfest then keep going. If you are looking for a good love story with slight perviness that is enjoyable with more then a few laughs and gets you actually feeling about the characters and can watch with your girl then buy this one. Also out of the three possible collections buy this one, yes it's not the cheapest but it comes with the soundtrack for the series for free, filled of good music, as well as post cards and other extras.",1159574400,11,1976,4.398907103825136
2400324,5,B000B5XP0G,"I started watching the series on a whim, stumbling across it on Myspace. However, after watching a few episodes, I could not help but get ahold of the whole series. While I'll admit, much of the initial draw to it was the excessive use of fanservice, once you get into the later episodes, the story really really takes off. After watching the last 5 episodes, I was in complete shock. I have quite literally never seen another animation, be it hentai, anime, or anything that quite matches up to the intensity of the story, and I am quite suprised that it is not more popular than it is. As the series gets more in depth, so does the music and the absolutely beautiful, and sometimes even mind boggling, animation. I highly reccommend it to anyone willing to take a little time and give it a chance... While it may start a little slow, as some other reviewers have pointed out, please, I beg you to go a little farther. I can almost guarentee you will not be disappointed.",1150761600,11,972,4.466292134831461
2400325,2,B000B5XP0G,"This is one of the worst series ever. The plot is very infantile and sadly unfunny. It gets boring after three episodes, as the characters repeat the same sentences all over again. Nothing moves they just sit and think. The whole relationship with an alien teacher seem so weird and untrue. Love hina has more comedy moments. I have better things to do then watch this show, let-along buying the collection DVD.",1150502400,,411,4.722222222222222
8081603,5,B000B5XP0G,"I love this show and thanks to this show I love
Pocky. I love the Pocky packaging on the DVD  box and the cd was a huge let down. well not really I didn't expect much from it any way but it would have been nice to have the full length opening and closing themes from the OST. There were some great tracks laid down for this show. I also carried over well into English and the voice actors were great. I ate it up. Please more!",1373068800,,426,3.896551724137931

I have low res files but I wanted them the way it was intended to be.
Should have bought it years ago, but was broke/married(same thing).",1370476800,,188,4.25
8081605,5,B000B5XP0G,Very unusual romantic comedy. I was upset that there was no cd with set. I still love the story very funny.,1360281600,,107,4.142857142857143
8081606,3,B000B5XP0G,"This is a really fun series. It is full of embarassing situations and rediculous conclusions.

The last few episodes get a little too sensual for younger viewers, but the rest is just great.",1228608000,,190,4.757575757575758

8081608,5,B000B5XP0G,Well this is the best anime serie that I have ever see and is super wow. I love it.,1201910400,,83,3.4210526315789473
8081609,5,B000B5XP0G,"This is an awesome package deal for an awesome anime. The storyline may seem a little discrete from time to time, and the last episode didn't quite seem to fit the rest (the rating of its contents has dramatically elevated towards an M than the earlier ones), but nontheless, this anime series is very entertaining.

The CD contains 23 tracks and the music is soothing.

Other than the featured media, the package itself contains quite a few art work items, and even the DVD covers are double-sided (yes, please make sure to pull them out of the plastic envelopes and check the hidden sides).

But I would suggest you to shop around. Amazon is a bit overpriced. (I got it elsewhere for less than $32, shipping included).",1195257600,2,720,4.653543307086614
8081610,5,B000B5XP0G,the movie gets off to a good start but you will be saying this is a priority one by the end of episode 2 but hey what can you do but it was funny filled with sexual humor puns and blocked images but your mind can fill those in lol,1183075200,2,230,3.62
8081611,5,B000B5XP0G,"i think the title says about all thats is neccessary...

a secret romance of a not so normal student and alien teacher - that seems to be more like one another in there differences and secrets...(odd yes but a lot of fun)",1174953600,4,221,4.261904761904762
8081612,5,B000B5XP0G,"I'd known about this series for awhile and saw the previews for it in a .hack//sign dvd. I became curious about it and saw the complete box set (4 discs,soundtrack) at suncoast video. I had the 50.00$ for it and took a gamble by purchasing it. I was not disappointed by this anime. The opening song grabbed hold of me and refused to let go. This series is a bit different than what I normally prefer. Hardly any violence or foul language to it so it's relatively safe for youngsters, except of course the last episode. The story young man meets sexy half alien woman. The story is toned down a bit from what most people would expect of such a set-up. It is heart warming and emotional how the two main characters get married and then go through the complications of a relationship that usually takes place before marriage. I loved the series enough to grab the mangas and the short novel titled "" kei and mizuho's diary"". They add more to the story and how the characters progress through it. My one problem with this anime is the guy who does the voice of kei. I know he's supposed to be weak and wimpy, still his lines annoy me. His dialoge is just.....augh. The other voice acters and actresses did a wonderful job. I do love this series and do recommend it to someone who wants to see a fun light hearted series. Why is this my 2nd favorite ova and why I call it an ova? 1-its less than 26 episodes long and gets the ova classification in my anime lists. 2-I love bubblegum crisis and that stays in the #1 spot of ovas. My favorite anime series of all time is the great classic uchu senkan yamato/starblazers for those who want to know.",1164758400,7,1640,4.3452768729641695
