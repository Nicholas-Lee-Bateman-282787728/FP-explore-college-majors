4401200,1,B004LGGXHS,"Quite possibly the WORST movie I have EVER seen.  From the story line, the sound, the acting just a really bad movie all around!",1375142400,,128,4.333333333333333
4401201,1,B004LGGXHS,"I wish I had read the other reviews before this.  I made it through half of the movie- I was watching it on headphones while everyone else played a game.  I kept making so many ""omg this movie is so bad"" noises that kids were coming over to check it out and laugh at it also.  I have no idea what was going on, the film was really hard to see and to hear- and it had no plot.  I thought it was a documentary- I still don't know what it was!  I sure hope they just remove this movie as a choice.",1356566400,6,494,3.7572815533980584
4401202,2,B004LGGXHS,"This looked like it might be a somewhat decent movie, if you could hear it.  The only things that were audible was the yelling and the background noise (crickets, etc.).  At least I didn't pay more then $1.99 for it or I would be asking for a refund.",1344297600,5,250,4.1875
4401203,1,B004LGGXHS,"No matter how dreadful a movie is, usually there is something redeeming.....not so here. Really, really bad! Slow, boring, uninteresting, an awful stinker. Made no sense, had no point. Terrible lighting and sound.  Couldn't see or hear what was going on.  Background noise was LOUD.  Some documentary-maker woman goes back to a river basin where she was raised to find out what happened to her dad who vanished while they fished years ago.  Her, camera crew and river man, Jack are weird. Jack and Dave go in the water everyday looking around. The other woman just looks at photographs throughout the movie. The drunk blond guy goes insane after seeing ""something"" during a diving session. Strange little things happen. Despite this, none of the dummies leave.  The backstory is that in the 1920's, the son of the town's founder fathered an illegimate son with a prostitute. When the wealthy father found out about this discretion, he threatened to write his son out of the will. The son then sets his illegitimate son off in a boat and upon finding out, the boy's mother hangs herself. The movie could have built upon this premise and maybe been ok.  Instead it's a rumpled bumbled messy piece of cinema crap-o-la. I'd give a negative rating if I could.",1336089600,8,1254,4.809302325581395
4401204,1,B004LGGXHS,"This has got to be the worst movie I have seen by far. The movie is so dark, choppy and confusing. They rarely speak throughout the film and and the sound is off. I can't say enough how this movie is a waste of time. If there was a zero on this rating it would be less than that. It is not even the kind of bad movie you can't help but watch and laugh at it. So disappointing! Insult to film.",1332806400,3,392,3.792682926829268
4401205,1,B004LGGXHS,"There is so much wrong with this disaster I don't know where to start.  SOUND MIXING- horrible.  You can barely hear the dialogue (which may be an unintended blessing).  But if you want to hear the sound of clanking dinnerware, the click of a recording button, or mosquitoes at deafening levels, this is yourt picture!
The director also uses lengthy fades to no avail and shot the film in black and white, green and white, sepia and white, and color???  The lighting is so bad you can't see what's going on, and the plot (?) is so incoherent, the movie makes no sense.  And the whole thing is BOOOORING!
Avoid this at all costs!!!",1324425600,13,630,4.491228070175438

4401207,1,B004LGGXHS,"Besides the fact that most of the dialogue was unintelligible, it was difficult to follow and even after finishing the movie (it took me three tries to get through it), I'm still not sure exactly what the plot was.",1483574400,,214,4.512820512820513
4401208,1,B004LGGXHS,Don't get anything about this movie...waste of time unless you need background noise to fall asleep to...,1473465600,,105,5.235294117647059
4401209,3,B004LGGXHS,"It's plays kind of like Blair Witch, but the story was real hard to follow!",1471996800,,75,4.066666666666666
4401210,1,B004LGGXHS,Boring and bad sound.,1471737600,,21,4.5

4401214,1,B004LGGXHS,"I watch a lot of bad movies often times just for the fun of it, but in this case, I resent the waste of time this movie was. Apparently a script was a luxury this film couldn't afford. I hope the creators read these reviews because I like to ask, ""what were you thinking?""",1470268800,,272,4.055555555555555

4401222,2,B004LGGXHS,"I thought this movie would be interesting because of the setting, which was the one aspect of the movie that was well exploited. I liked the whole idea of ghosts in the water and haunted islands, and I thought the mythology with the thwarted son leaving town and a subsequent almost immediate and fatal flood had interesting hints of sorcery. I had problems hearing the dialogue and turned on captioning, but the dialogue was not all that helpful in understanding what was going on. For instance, early on someone takes a bunch of their stuff up the river, and I had no idea why; I thought he was a thief for a while. I didn't understand that he was taking their camping gear upstream. There were a lot of things like that. The ending was understandable after I thought about it for a while, but it was not satisfying to me.",1469318400,2,824,4.4635761589403975
4401223,1,B004LGGXHS,"Terrible sound.
Murky story.  I tried to like it as I respect low budget and independent film endeavors.",1469232000,,104,4.777777777777778

4401225,1,B004LGGXHS,"I'd give this unwatchable drivel zero stars if I could. Dreadful plot, irritating cast, just...no.",1466380800,,98,5.6
4401226,5,B004LGGXHS,I. Really like the movie because it's very different from others and I love the writers point of view and the movie has met my expectations and more and thanks Amazon prime for Great movie selections and thanks for reading my review,1465948800,,232,4.5476190476190474
4401227,1,B004LGGXHS,Total crap not worth watching.,1465862400,,30,5.2
4401228,1,B004LGGXHS,"I usually don't write reviews but this movie sucks moose s*** through a crazy straw, sideways!!!  If I could write this without rating it, I would.  There is no sense of congruity in this piece of crap.  One guy goes apes***!  Why?  Who knows, he saw something in the water.  Now what?  Let's have breakfast!  Thank GOD they brought enough beer along!  WTF???  I would recommend this only to a government who needs to use torture to get information out of prisoners.  If anyone was forced to watch this under duress, I am positive that they would spill their guts in order to be set free!!!  Another interesting tidbit:  If you ever find the need to call a plumber, due to a clogged drain / pipe, don't be surprised if a copy of this film is found as the culprit in the pipe!!!  If you find yourself bored and decide to watch this movie, take a nap instead!",1463616000,,857,4.341772151898734
4401229,1,B004LGGXHS,"If I could give it negative stars I would, one of the worst movies I have ever seen.",1459209600,,84,3.7222222222222223
4401230,1,B004LGGXHS,What happened?,1457827200,,14,6.5
4401241,1,B004LGGXHS,Video was very low quality and that made it hard to focus on the story.,1457481600,,71,3.8
4401242,1,B004LGGXHS,Would have rated it lower if possible.,1457222400,,38,4.571428571428571

4401244,1,B004LGGXHS,"Like a lot of others, I couldn't finish it. I couldn't hear what they were saying while the ambient noises and occasional music was deafening. I turned on the closed captions and realized I wasn't missing much.

Not arty or abstract. Just really boring and pointless.

I don't know what font they were using but I couldn't read any of the opening credits. It didn't take long to understand why they'd be purposefully masked

I grew up on the Mississippi River bottoms. On behalf of all low-land billies, don't watch this movie",1455235200,,526,4.695652173913044
4401245,2,B004LGGXHS,"To be honest I did not more to the point ""I could not"" make it through this entire movie so I guess from that statement alone you can tell what I thought of this movie. It's just not worth watching and every copy of this movie should follow it's own title and be buried ""Beneath the Mississippi"" Don't waste you time with this unless of course you like wasting your time.",1454457600,,371,4.23943661971831

4401248,2,B004LGGXHS,I watched it all the way through.  As a movie with an actual story line it failed.  The plot was incoherent.  As an art film only; the photography was great.  The acting wasn't bad either.  It's not the fault of the actresses and actors that the story itself was disjointed and confusing.  I gave it a two for the photography work involved.  That was being generous.,1438041600,2,366,4.454545454545454
4401249,1,B004LGGXHS,"OMG I can't believe how dreadful this was, even while working on my art. It didn't even make descent background entertainment.
I have no idea what was going on......it just went on aimlessly on and on and on and on........the photography was awful; sorry mr director, but you are no Woody Allen.......this grayscale black/white thing interspersed with occasional tinges of color routine was very poorly done.
was this supposed to be an artsy surreal film set in a swamp where everybody is supposed to give the impression that alternate states of consciousness are colliding with the Louisiana universe........
the music sounds is perfect for this movie, sounds like it was composed by somebody who had a secret stash of old fashion qual******* and audio is technically deficient.",1428710400,2,779,5.141732283464567
4401250,2,B004LGGXHS,"I was really rooting for this movie. There were a half dozen points at which it had the chance to do something, anything, interesting.

Oh, Beneath the Mississippi, you had a chance to be interesting. I dug the lo-fi aesthetic, I dug the fact that the protagonist was a vulnerable and emotionally scarred-but-still-capable woman trying to redeem herself. I liked the local color mythology that you kind of tried to awkwardly shoehorn into the plot but never quite knew what to do with.

Sadly, the lo fi aesthetic (which was pretty to look at) mostly meant that the sound mixing was so bad that most of the exposition was mumbled and whispered while useless, nonsensical exclamations of surprise and fear were painfully loud. Sadly, the sympathetic protagonist never grew or changed or learned anything at all. Sadly, the mythology behind the movie was poorly developed and only tenuously linked to the action (to the limited extent there was action).

The movie didn't turn out well, at all. It didn't even show promise, not really. It showed promise of showing promise.",1428624000,3,1071,4.938888888888889
4401251,3,B004LGGXHS,Not my cup of tea.,1428019200,,18,2.8
4401252,1,B004LGGXHS,"This is the worst movie I have watched in a long time.  It was so terrible it is not even worth a 1 star in my opinion.  It had no real plot.  The sparse dialogues were inaudible due to bad sound quality.  The screen format with bars on top and bottom was annoying at best.  It could have had potential with better sound and an actual plot development.  I was looking forward to a mystery unfold.  Instead, the movie stretched endlessly along with little or no action.  Only the music lend this movie a touch of suspense.  Other than that it was painful to watch.  I skipped ahead a lot and still did not miss any significant details.  I don't think the ""mystery"" was solved/explained or became apparent in the end.  I've seen lots of artsy and unusual movies that don't serve all the answers on a platter but require the viewer to think.  This movie does not make me think or wonder at all.  Plain and simple: boring.",1427155200,3,918,4.355029585798817

4401256,2,B004LGGXHS,Not a very good movie at all.  I was bored after the first 10min.  Sound is bad and the backlighting even worse.  I really do not think there was a plot all.  I actually was waiting for some swamp creature to finally pop up but nothing ever happened.  I guess if you like movies that are boring and make no sense here you go...,1400371200,3,327,4.046875
4401257,1,B004LGGXHS,"Without any real meaning ro substance this film meanders around until it lost me on the Bayou!  Another art film school project gone horribly wrong!  Can't anybody delve into and design plots based on real mysteries out there; instead of concoting the most ridiculous and inane concepts!  Waste of time, money and celluloid!

4401259,1,B004LGGXHS,"this may prove to be the antidote. I agree with all the other reviews. Horrible sound unless you like an eerie drum repeating du-dum and river sounds. Slowest, most boring movie I've ever seen in my whole life.",1391904000,,210,4.552631578947368
4401260,1,B004LGGXHS,I've seen some bad movies in my years but this takes the cake.  I mean seriously the picture quality sucked sound sucked and I couldn't figure out what was going on at all.  This movie makes no sense.,1380585600,,200,4.2368421052631575
8434283,1,B004LGGXHS,Absolutely horrendous. The audio was terrible. The story line was broken and the eventual out come was predictable. Whoever gave this move a 5 star rating has got to be  someone either in the cast or paid to give favorable reviews to movies that should never have been made. I wish there were some rating that was lower than a one star because this movie clearly earned it!!  I started to upload a product link but it was to much trouble to look up a TOILET!!!!!,1508630400,,462,4.3604651162790695
8434284,1,B004LGGXHS,"I guess I probably should have read the reviews a little more closely before attempting to watch this movie. I did read over a couple of the reviews and thought I would give this movie the benefit of the doubt and watch it anyway. Needless to say, I did not finishing watching this movie. It is terrible. It looks like it was filmed by children and you cannot hear the movie until they yell and that is so loud you nearly jump out of your seat. I have never given a movie or TV series one star before in my life and I wouldn't even give this thing one star if I didn't have to to write a review. I'd recommend not wasting your time attempting to watch tgis atrocious movie and certainly don't waste any money buying it.",1502755200,,719,4.179856115107913
