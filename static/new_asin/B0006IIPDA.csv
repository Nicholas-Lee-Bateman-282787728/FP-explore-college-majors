I love magical girl shows, so no problem with me or in this case MAGICAL CAT shows. However if your super into action, you'll probably hate this. I'm an adult and I love this stuff.

The movie is short and sweet. Each disc is only 66 minutes and contains three episodes each. These are the shortest anime DVDs that I know of.

I'm actually glad I bought the discs new as they were all under 20 except the last one and each comes with a sticker. I won't use the sticker because its too cute and rare to waste but they are fun to look at and they were a big surprise as I found this nowhere in the description.",1410048000,,728,4.119718309859155
8216568,5,B0006IIPDA,"This cute anime series is about an adorable neko named Taruto.  After hearing a certain fairy tale, and due to her magical abilities, she believes herself to be the legendary princess of the Kinka.  She makes new friends, tries to keep from getting caught by a cat crazed girl, and attempts to use her magic to help people.  I highly recommend Magical Meow Meow Taruto to anyone who likes anime.  I'm 34 and I love it :)",1124150400,4,420,4.415584415584416
