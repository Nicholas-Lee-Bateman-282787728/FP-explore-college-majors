8429295,1,B004H3F2L8,"With so many quality English imports to chose from save your money on this one. Why a series was done on Nancy Astor is hard to justify. She was the first woman to sit in the House of Commons but she didn't so anything there. Lisa Harrow's style of acting reminds me of a very poor imitation of Scarlet O'Hara. Not my taste one whit. One example: She marries Robert Gould Shaw -the grandson of the soldier who fought with the 54th Massachusetts. He loves her and gives up his mistress for her only to learn she finds sex repulsive. She takes the high road about his drinking, etc. She wants to be married but not be a wife. No surprise when he moves on and marries another. Story is not entertaining. You have been warned!",1302307200,2,722,4.3161764705882355
