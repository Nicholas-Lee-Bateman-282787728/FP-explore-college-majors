2764337,5,B000HXDM6Y,"A gay film this certainly is not, nor is it a horror film as some has tagged it to be.  This film is more akin to Truffaut's 400 BLOWS and De Sica's SHOESHINE. Young Polin finds himself in an institution and one day, when the opportunity finally arises,  he escapes and learns that freedom, too, has its price. Heartbreaking... A neorealist masterpiece!",1197676800,50,353,4.67741935483871
2764338,5,B000HXDM6Y,"Since there's no plot synopsis, I'll give you an edited version that was on the DVD.
It was banned by the Argentinian government for nearly thirty years. It's a searing indictment of a fascist regime that ran roughshod over its most vulnerable citizens; its children. The film focuses on a boy abandoned by his parents and sent to live in a state run orphanage. Inside the harsh confines of this institution, boys must deal with constant physical abuse as well as the emotional tensions brought on by their emerging adolescence.
I take exception to those who have tagged this movie as a gay film. There is no evidence of any homosexual acts or inference to it. The main character in this movie was a resourceful boy who had dreams of a better life for himself.",1194739200,73,760,4.637037037037037

Banned for thirty years by the Argentinian government, CHRONICLE OF A BOY ALONE is a searing indictment of a fascist regime running roughshod over its most vulnerable citizens - its children. The movie focuses on the bleak life of eleven-year-old bad boy Polin who's been abandoned by his family and sent to live in a state-run orphanage. Inside the harsh confines of the supposedly beneficial institution, Polin and his fellow mates must deal with constant physical and psychological abuse by the staff, as well as the natural emotional tensions brought on by their own burgeoning adolescence. But through it all they manage to keep their hopes alive with optimistic talk of freedom and bold plans of escape until one day when the opportunity finally arises, and Polin learns that freedom, too, has its price. Contains mild violence and extensive nudity.",1156982400,20,1080,5.236994219653179

8176654,2,B000HXDM6Y,Service was good but description a bit embellished. But it was watchable,1468972800,,72,5.083333333333333
8176655,3,B000HXDM6Y,"A tale of a boy who escaped a correction facility to spend some time in own village is screened 1hr17min, which is 3min shorter than advertised.

Maybe, lacking of this time missed a very promotion of a sexual violence while naked bodies of ageless characters, who smocked even before puberty, were in my case not a reason for paying a ridiculously high price for this product.

This DVD had been ordered as a part of a set but nothing offered more supplied, and it's not a first attempt to get a movie customer was interested in primarily was not delivered.

It's hard to quarrel with one's opinion in such case that it was not the best deal for money spent.",1434672000,2,659,4.475
8176656,5,B000HXDM6Y,"An excellent movie. Although there were some scenes I didn't particularly like (the beginning  for example), the movie was based on actual events in this man's childhood, and for some reasons movies based on actual facts tends to appear more real to me, which I like in movies.",1382227200,4,277,4.770833333333333
8176657,5,B000HXDM6Y,"This Movie was censured in Argentina for 3 decades, because it portrayed the real, frightening features of poverty among its
population especially children.  In addition, the Movie portrayed the ineptness of the Government to positively manage the
plight of poor children.  South of the Border, in South America, Argentina is an unfortunate example of very young boys who
are abandoned by parents and deserted at state orphanages.  In this movie, it is a distressing presentation of a boy who
is trapped in an institution under the auspices of well-meaning but incompetent staff who manage children like livestock in
a corral instead of human beings.  When Polin escapes back to his neighborhood, the viewer may be shocked by the poverty and
the culture of the poor.  One of the scenes has Polin and other boys swimming completely nude which should not be offensive.
The Argentine children are so poor that swimming suits can not be afforded, and a youngster may have only one change of clothes?!
A nude swim at a pool or river, is the only way to bathe because there is no shower or bathtub or plumbing where they live.
Due to the pervasiveness of arbitrary nepotism and corrupt patronage in the Argentinian society, unless a youngster is born
into economic and social privilege, a boy or girl is retained in a very dreary life.  The contents of the Movie succinctly
illustrates the perpetual physical, psychological and emotional abuse in the personal life and society that Polin and his
friends struggle in.  Adolescent puberty accents the doomed daily existence of each youngster - and the circumstances of Polin
manifest a Society in which exsists a deprived Middle Class with the overwhelming majority who are poor or rich with little or
nothing in between.  This DVD Movie shall exhort the viewer to be grateful to have a Government and Society of Citizens
that strives to sustain a prosperous, thriving Middle Class.",1378339200,9,1924,4.97196261682243
8176658,5,B000HXDM6Y,This is a foreign film about an unfortunate kid.  It is probably representative of how many kids live in much of the world.  Makes one feel sorry for them and makes me appreciate what we have in America.,1363046400,3,203,4.315789473684211
8176659,5,B000HXDM6Y,"I enjoy foreign movies. For one they (the good ones) rely on content , story , photography and emotion.
Chronicles--- has all the above and more. I will not go into detail about the movie , that been done and better than I could.
I will say almost every frame would be a great photo to hang. Acting was superb and so realistic. One could watch this movie without subtitle and still know the story. That in itself makes a great film. Unfortunately I went to you tube to preview before purchasing, nothing against you tube, its great, however the preview was a little misleading. Just buy the dang movie and watch it ,if you like foreign films, I believe you will watch it a couple of times just to make sure it was as great as the first.

I am not much of a reviewer, my tastes vary, but if you want to get away from Hollywood special effects and watch a real story, by all means go ahead and spend a few extra dollars and get a movie worth keeping in your collection.",1337385600,6,967,4.227027027027027
8176660,5,B000HXDM6Y,"Most American viewers will not know that Leonardo Favio, who directed this film, is one of Argentina's most popular pop singers and at the same time one its the most distinguished film makers.  Argentina has a long cinematic history.  Unfortunately, most of it has not been preserved or it exists in formats unplayable in region one players.  Therefore, this release is all the more important.  Others have already pointed out it is not a gay film
(where does that idea come from) and its relationship to the cinema of Truffaut and Rosellini. A real find.",1218585600,9,555,4.810526315789474
