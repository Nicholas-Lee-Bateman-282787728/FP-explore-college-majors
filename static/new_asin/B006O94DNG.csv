8501714,4,B006O94DNG,"Compared to the first 3 parts, this fourth volume is a bit long in the teeth. It tries its best to squeeze 6 episodes out of what little is left of the game's story, basically clearing up loose plot strings such as the six God Generals, the clones, the battle of the wills between Asch and Luke and the final confrontation with the main villian. The ending is just as vague and perplexing as presented in the game, I was honestly looking forward to having the OVA expand upon the game's ending to clarify a few points as to the fate of Luke/Asch. Sadly, it is kept the same, potentially to give viewers to speculate on what really occurred after the characters left Luke in charge of Alderant.",1370908800,,693,4.421875
