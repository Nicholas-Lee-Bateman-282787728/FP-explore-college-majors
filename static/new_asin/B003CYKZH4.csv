8394572,5,B003CYKZH4,"This DVD is a nice progression from levels 1 and 2. It offers more of a challenge and mixes deep breathing exercises with balancing, stretching and strengthening. I found the close-ups of some of the movements helpful. A good workout and a good way to relax.",1322352000,3,258,4.630434782608695
8394573,4,B003CYKZH4,"This is a no-frills production that features on the good side a surprise light jazz soundtrack instead of the usual New Age fare. On the down side, there is only one camera angle and few close-ups where they are needed and there is limited navigation on the individual segments. Overall, though, is this a pretty decent production and offers an excellent 60-minute workout.

If you are in reasonably good condition, Level 3 would provide a relaxing and effective workout for days when you want something more slow and simple. Most poses are done seated with a few standing poses also done with the aid of a chair.

Patricia is a good instructor with a pleasant, lilting voice. She works systematically and offers brief relaxation/meditation breaks with each segment.

I particularly like her version of chair corpse pose.",1278374400,6,821,4.978102189781022
