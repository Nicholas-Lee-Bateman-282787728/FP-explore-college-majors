As I have said in a different review, we had a wonderful experience with a DVD that visited a number of Greek islands prior to a 2006 trip to Crete. It got us excited, gave us a taste of the culture that we would find, and was very accurate. By contrast, this DVD for Croatia-Istria is extremely badly done. It focuses on showing accomodations (even bathrooms), campgrounds, and families on beaches and in the water. By comparison, very little time is spent showing the lovely cities, and surrounding countryside, and virtually no time is devoted to the rich cultural heritage of this region. To make matters worse, awful music constantly grates in the background. If this is meant to attract tourists, think again!",1207699200,,805,4.798561151079137
8639822,4,B000XPXUDG,The DVD was very informative and showed all the important towns on the Istrian penninsula. It included brief historical information on some towns.  The quality of the picture is good. It looks like it was filmed in the 80's. However two points were disappointing:  The case cover is plain white paper and not what was pictured in the product description.  Second there is no menu selection so the DVD starts playing immediately and could not be restarted. It doesn't look like an original therefore it's a bit pricey.,1196380800,,517,4.8522727272727275
