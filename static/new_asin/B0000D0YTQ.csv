1920505,2,B0000D0YTQ,"This was a favorite book as  kid and I have enjoyed movie versions of it in the past, especially the 1949 MGM version, which is quite good and reasonably faithful to the book.  The 1994 version was also reasonably good.  This one is a low budget cartoon version but has some very good actors doing voice work, which is why the 2 stars.  The animation is not up to the higher standards of Disney, Don Bluth or the other major players but is acceptable if you aren't too critical.  The script however changes the original in some not good ways.  I can live with the cartoon idea of talking cats, dancing flowers,etc. added to the story but I have a major problem with what was done to the housekeeper. ( Spoiler alert!) In the book and other movies, she is stuffy, bossy, and a control freak, but within the  bounds of normal, not too pleasant human behavior; this version turns her into a thief and vicious plotter who is  deliberately working to keep the crippled boy sick,  and then planning to kill him (including a witch-like song and dance as she mixes the poison); not to worry though there is  a nick of time rescue by the father who has rushed back to foil the housekeeper and her henchman, the lying doctor  which saves the day and  provides the happy ending.  Not recommended.",1302652800,3,1285,4.463519313304721
1920506,5,B0000D0YTQ,"Despite the fact that many consider the WB version of The Secret Garden to the be definitive movie, this edition outshines it in many ways.  Here are just a few:

First, in some cases it actually sticks closer to the book, such as in the fact that Mary's parents actually die of cholera in India rather than an earthquake.

Also, this edition seems to be much more accessible to children, and not just by the fact that it is animated.  Catchy songs encourage children to sing along and thus engage with the film more than they would with another movie version.  That, and the animals are given a larger role, such as that as the robin and Darjeeling the cat, which is also more fun to watch if not 100% accurate.

Overall, I much prefer this version over the other, although they are both lovely to watch.  Again, it's more geared towards kids than the other one, but it's also more easy to get the flow of as the simple plot points are made more clear than in the live-action movie.",1252800000,10,983,4.397790055248619
1920507,5,B0000D0YTQ,"I watched this DVD this afternoon with my six year old high-functioning autistic grandson who usually won't sit still for a whole movie. He was spellbound.  The characters are clearcut and the plot was simple enough not to confuse a child, and it really has a positive message overall.",1186012800,2,285,4.816326530612245
1920508,3,B0000D0YTQ,"The animation doesn't flow very smoothly, but the music is wonderful.  My daughter was still singing the songs weeks after we returned this video to the rental store.  She has been asking for it for her birthday. (4 years  old) Followed the story fairly closely. Talking animals add to the fun.",955065600,5,294,4.7254901960784315

7999809,3,B0000D0YTQ,"It would have been an excellent movie had they stayed close to the beloved children book. The evil twist to the story was very disappointing. My daughter who has not read the book yet enjoyed the movie but absolutely disliked the scenes with evil Mrs. Medlock and her attempts to poison Colin. Mrs. Medlock  and Dr. Craven are not evil characters in the book. I was also missing Mrs. Sowerby, one of my favorite characters!",1490572800,,423,4.64
