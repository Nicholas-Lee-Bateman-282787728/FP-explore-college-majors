8019885,2,B00020X8N4,"WOMEN IN CELL BLOCK 9 is Jess Franco's soft-core film for sadists. Women are captured as ""terrorists"", stripped, tortured, and escape to run naked through jungles and swamps. Actually, it's all fairly dull stuff, unless certain orifices gushing fake blood is your thing. Yes, there are some beautiful women in this movie. No, I probably won't watch it again...",1360540800,,360,5.11864406779661
8019886,2,B00020X8N4,"Directed by Jess Franco, Women In Cellblock 9 (1977) is a brutal, misogynistic prison movie set somewhere in Latin America, with a paper thin story, that is mostly concerned with displaying naked women, and showcasing their cruel abuse.  Banned in various countries, the film is also known as Tropical Inferno on IMDB, and the completely inappropriate Escape From the Island of Death.  If you are interested in some mean, nasty, sleazy cinema, from the 70's, this film fits the bill nicely.

Three women are arrested by some soldiers, and are taken to a prison in the middle of a jungle, which is under the charge of a female warden.  In Cellblock 9, the women are stripped naked, and put in chains.  One by one, they are taken for interrogation, where the camp doctor administers various kinds or torture, including using a live rat.  The women are returned to Cellblock 9, where each makes a remarkable recovery from their ordeal.  The prisoners are joined by a fourth woman, and after tricking a guard, they escape into the jungle, with the soldiers in hot pursuit.

The nasty and revolting torture they endure, should leave the women traumatized, and seriously injured or disabled.  Instead, they appear not to have a mark on them, and are relatively composed, having apparently sustained no major injuries.  This conveniently discounts the atrocities that have been committed, and sets the women up for further abuse.

The lack of realism, makes the movie seem even more exploitive, as no matter what happens, the women are still available to be victimized, and finally hunted down like animals.  With abundant nudity, and some cruel torture, Women of Cellblock 9 will please some, and disgust others, so watch it at your own risk.",1349222400,2,1736,4.927835051546392
