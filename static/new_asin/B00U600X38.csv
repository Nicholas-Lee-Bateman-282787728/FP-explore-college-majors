7029228,5,B00U600X38,"Wonderful DVD with sumptuous landscapes and birdsong. Few years ago I have had the chance to go to the Tyrol. With this video, I can relive this beautiful experience and I can remind good memories. This DVD can give you a great relaxation without having to move. You can also watch this DVD in exercising at home. Time will pass quickly and you will get the feeling that you have traveled.",1428796800,4,389,4.492957746478873
7029229,5,B00U600X38,"I first bought the digital version of one of these 3 walks from the creator's website and I loved it so much that I have now ordered the full DVD!  The film quality is superb and the scenery is magical!  Six Stars!!  -  UPDATE:  I have now received the DVD and love it!!  You ride (or walk/jog) along dedicated bike paths so there are no cars in sight.  Just the occasional walker and a few others riding their bikes.  The scenery is diverse, from vineyards, snow-capped mountains, pine forest, a river and so much more.  The 3 x 20 min rides play continuously if you want, for a full hour workout.  I like the nature sounds, but I also play my own music whilst riding.  You can see a trailer of this DVD at www.worldnaturevideo.com.",1426809600,6,733,4.355555555555555
7029230,5,B00U600X38,"This is such a wonderful dvd. It is filled with riding through vineyards & forests while listening to the beautiful sounds of birds & crickets, then coming up on an old village & hearing the church bells with the beautiful mountains in the background. This is a perfect dvd to watch while walking on the treadmill or on your indoor bike or it's beautiful & peaceful enough even to watch while relaxing on the couch. Love it! Thanks for another great one!",1426550400,6,454,4.548780487804878
7029231,5,B00U600X38,"This is great I love it!  It was one of several gifts to me which is why it doesn't show me as having purchased this, but I do have it and I do use this DVD a couple times a week.  I interchange it with some of the other ones.  I live in a super busy noisy jampacked over crowded city.  I find this DVD to be super calming and relaxed as it's out in nature with the sounds of quietness and the birds chirping.  It keeps me on my stationary bike longer than usual.",1483056000,,463,3.831578947368421

7029234,5,B00U600X38,"For several years I've been looking for a video to accompany my stationary bike. I decided a few days ago to look on Amazon and was thrilled to find them. After reading some reviews, I decided on the Bike Through Italian Tyrol and I'm happy to say I'm not disappointed! This video is gorgeous and so much fun to cycle to. The locations are stunning as well as the sounds..I feel like I'm actually there. I couldn't believe how fast the time went by. I cannot wait to ""go back"" tomorrow! I know I'll be purchasing more locations in the future.",1443398400,7,542,4.376237623762377
7029235,5,B00U600X38,"Loved it!!!  Had to return the first tape because it was flawed, but it was totally worth it to get one that worked.  Astounding scenery!  never tire of this one!",1441065600,3,162,4.333333333333333
7029236,5,B00U600X38,"This DVD starts with a path through vineyards with lush green hills to the sides and hazy blue mountains in the distance. There are beautiful sounds of birds giving me a great calm feeling.  Later in the programme there are wooded hillsides with verdant green trees.  After a while there is a stream flowing beside the path with the marvellous sounds of the water gurgling down into the valley, this all enhances my enjoyment with this DVD.  I really enjoy the difference between the green hills and the different hues and shapes of the mountains with smooth tops covered with white clouds on some. Track three is the fastest pace, but I still found it fine to walk.  The cycle ride is filmed on a lovely summer's day which gave me a super feeling to work out to.  I found it a nice touch to end track 2 at a stop sign at the end of the path. Although this disc says it is a cycle ride I found it suitable to walk too as well.",1432598400,2,926,4.238636363636363
7029237,5,B00U600X38,"In this DVD, I can exercise on my exercise bike fast and drive through the beautiful South Tyrol. With the wonderful countryside, the forests and vineyards, the partly snow-covered Dolomites in the background, working out is just a great experience. You get to know real Italian villages, cycle with a beautiful lake in the background and listen to the song of birds. Sometimes it goes up, then back down the mountain, everything is very peaceful and quiet. This DVD is well suited for a workout after a stressful day. You nearly can see nobody in the videos. Thus, you can concentrate on and enjoy the wonderful green landscape and the bright blue sky. This is a wonderful DVD with breathtaking scenery, which can also be just watched and enjoyed while sitting on the couch. But it makes exercising so much more fun.",1431561600,2,817,4.76056338028169
7029238,5,B00U600X38,"This DVD has 3 visually stunning journeys beginning with a variety of vineyards and fruit tree groves.  It is a beautiful day, with incredible mountains stretching out ahead of you, a lake at their base, and a picturesque cloud-scattered sky above.  Every once in a while you pass a small town or a few buildings with distinctly European architecture.  On the third video you have made your way to a higher elevation with pine trees lining a path that winds along the side of a hill.  Snow-capped mountains appear much closer and you can hear cuckoos in the distance.  The entire DVD has the fewest transitions of any video of this type Ive seen  and those that do occur are nearly seamless.  You are always on a path with no vehicular traffic and only an occasional pedestrian or bicyclist.  The view is smooth and straight, and although the pace is about that of a brisk walk, Ive found it to be just fine for riding a spin bike hard and fast with separate music blasting.",1431216000,4,974,4.525714285714286
7029239,5,B00U600X38,"This is a lovely DVD it is as if you are actually cycling with the Italian Dolomites in the distance.  The scenery is exquisite and the sound effects very realistic.  Makes cycling on the stationary bike or walking on the treadmill much more interesting.  There are three scenes to choose from and each is different and there is even nature sounds to make it more realistic.  I highly recommend this video for your treadmill or your stationary bike ride.  It is great for just relaxing, too.
I especially enjoyed the diversification of scenes from the lovely vineyards of Italy to the distant Dolomites.",1429574400,6,603,4.815533980582524
7029240,5,B00U600X38,"This is a fantastic way to get through an exercise session!  It feels like you are riding a bike thru several different areas in Italy.  Realistic nature sounds help make this an enjoyable way to ""bike"" thru the countryside.",1429142400,2,224,4.717948717948718
8704473,2,B00U600X38,"Enjoy the scenery, but it should at least give you a timer on the bottom or top to see how long you are doing it. would not purchase again.",1528329600,,139,3.8275862068965516
8704474,4,B00U600X38,"Beautiful photography, good routes, I am looking for scenery to watch while biking indoors- this fit that bill.",1525392000,,111,5.222222222222222
8704475,5,B00U600X38,Great video! Keeps exercise exciting!,1518393600,,37,6.6
8704476,2,B00U600X38,"The scenery is beautiful. However, it's tough navigating the menu at first and difficult to tell which section you're on because when highlighted it looks the same as the other options. Then you'll be disappointed with the first two videos unless you're a turtle or a snail...very slow. In fact, my 6 year old daughter mentioned that's how slow she feels her bike is going right before it falls over. The 3rd video is great, but now you only have a 20 minute video that will have to be played over and over again that will soon become mundane. The edits are harsh and distracting as well, they should have used dissolves instead of straight cuts. Overall, a little disappointing and I hate trying to convince myself something was worth it when it wasn't.",1496880000,2,754,4.634328358208955
8704477,5,B00U600X38,I found this to be the best way to keep working out on my exercise bike... Will soon purchase others as this is my second one.  Thanks Ambient,1489795200,,142,4.071428571428571
8704478,4,B00U600X38,"It's a nice CD to add to the collection....beautiful scenery and smooth photography.  This was bought for walking/jogging on a treadmill while the scenery is gorgeous, the pace of the first two rides was so slow it drove me crazy (and I was just walking).  The first ride was sooooo slow and (in my opinion) was boring unless you like endless vineyards and nothing else.  The next was still slow but the scenery change-up kept it a lot more interesting.  Finally by the next ride we were cruising and the scenery was outstanding!  If you are looking for a slower pace either for walking or biking and great scenery this is an excellent CD for you.",1488067200,,647,4.543103448275862
8704479,1,B00U600X38,"I did not like this DVD, was very disappointed, and I will return. This DVD was not inspirational. It was birds tweeting constantly.",1485734400,,132,4.782608695652174
8704480,2,B00U600X38,Boring!  Any indoor spinner won't be happy with this video.,1485216000,,59,4.9
8704481,4,B00U600X38,"It's nice, but you just have to know what you are getting to be happy. The scenery is good, but what you would expect jogging down a road.  Not like a lot happens when you jog down a road.  This is not some extreme video or spectacular ariel footage or something like that.  The speed is a little slow for biking, like a steady job of about 6mph.  The soundtrack is dubbed in bird noises, so I play my own music instead.  I could not work out to this every day, but it's nice to mix in with my other videos.  As a plug, I really like September Sessions, a surfing video directed by Jack Johnson, where he picks out all the music.",1485043200,4,629,4.073170731707317
8704482,5,B00U600X38,The virtual cycle DVDs are a brilliant idea! I ride an indoor exercise bike. Sometimes it can get very boring. These DVDs are realistic and make the time go by quickly. You feel like you are there.,1483747200,2,197,4.351351351351352
