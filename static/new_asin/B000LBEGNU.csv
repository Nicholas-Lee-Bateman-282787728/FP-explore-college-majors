8160650,2,B000LBEGNU,"He has a few good jokes and some talent, but as a whole, not very funny.  It's old time comedy from the 1950's.  A lot of Frank Sinatra stuff.  Other people might think it's okay and comedy is very subjective, but as for talent, Fred Travalena is no Taylor Mason for making you laugh so hard your gut hurts!  Tim Hawkins is better, Bill Cosby is better, Thor Ramsey is better, Michael Johnson is better.  The 12 days of Christmas joke is way too long and only half of his imitations sound anything like the real person.  Jim Carrey is better.  Fred Travalena is a clean comedian though.  No cussing.",1401667200,,599,4.381818181818182
