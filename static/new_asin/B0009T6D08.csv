8324913,4,B0009T6D08,I was very glad to purchase this product. The movies are full length (not edited versions). The picture quality however is not to good. The colour is faded and especially Trail of Robin Hood has a red tinge to the colour.,1524787200,,221,4.414634146341464
8324914,3,B0009T6D08,"Although the video quality of this dvd is not that great, both movies, to the best of my knowledge, are complete and uncut. I bought this especially for Trail of Robin Hood. I have the Happy Trails Theater version, which is cut up to pieces (two whole songs are missing). I wanted an uncut version with the songs intact. Like I said before, the video has a lot to be desired, but until they completely remaster Roy's movies, if they ever do, this is the only way I know of, beside getting the original VHS tape release, to get the complete uncut versions of these two films.",1447718400,,574,4.373831775700935
