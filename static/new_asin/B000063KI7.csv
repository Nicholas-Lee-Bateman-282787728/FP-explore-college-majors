The movie is probably very good, but don't make the mistake I made of ordering without checking for subtitles -- there are no English subtitles on this DVD.  If you aren't fluent in French, don't buy it.",1480377600,,299,4.418181818181818
7959359,5,B000063KI7,"This is a funny French comedy about a 28-year-old boy who doesn't want to leave home (& is driving his parents crazy).  It's a great movie for adults, but not for kids.  (There is blatant sex & nudity.)  I highly recommend it for adults.",1298505600,2,237,4.340909090909091
7959360,2,B000063KI7,"I watched this movie with so much hope! Dussollier, Azma, beautiful Aurore Clment (from ""Demain on dmnage (2004)""), J. P. Rouve and many others, like always charming Delphine Serina (Avocats + associs) and a topic I am fond of paved the way for a killer Saturday night movie. I suppose that if you dislike the ""philosophical grounds"" of a movie, it's hard, almost impossible for it to work for you.
I felt the parents were almost farcical from the start, when they ""enjoyed themselves"" when his adult only son wasn't with them at home, they basically did go out (something they could easily do with him still at home). In short, I found the kid too polite, peaceful and loving to be really hated. Ok, he had some sort of ""Peter Pan syndrome"", and it's true he seemed to be all too comfortable at his parent's, but ... I just thought their (parent's) house was too posh and big, their reactions too violent (hiring thugs to kick your son out, wanting him dead when hearing there was a plane crash, teared apart his shirts etc., and erratic (Edith was suddenly loving and repentant until she found out her son wasn't actually dead, so was she when his son started suffering panic attacks, but not later). Tanguy is too perfect, if nerdy and unfaithful to his beautiful girlfriend. And probably too successful with (very beautiful on average) women he beds as effortlessly as we could say: ""sneeze"". Maybe that's French intellectual's prerogative, who knows :). His ""rich and dumb"" American clients are a big cliche that works.

Everyone will have his/ her favourite scene. Mine are Paul's fits of anger: Tu te casses!! (=Get away!) and when Tanguy argues on the phone with her mum until he grabs the phone and yells: ""Stop the crap"" in worse and thus very convincing, terms.

I think the film was illogical, and the 2nd part was actually awful. Watch without any expectation and you might be amused.",1272067200,2,1897,4.693693693693693
7959361,5,B000063KI7,"Sabine Azema and Andre Dussolier are the parents of Tanguy (Eric Berger) 28 , a smart guy but gifted with extremely weak character and emotionally invalid ; an old fashioned nerd. He loves the asiatic culture , and he is preparing a thesis about sociological and philospical aspects concerned with China, but meanwhile, the heavy family atmosphere is unbearable ; that issue surrounds the affective and emotional links with their parents who desire he leaves his home, as soon as he can.
Watch this delightful movie; it's plenty of laughable moments; and depicts a new social phenomen in Europe.
Helen Duc as the grandmother is ravishing; Azema is unforgettable and she's one of the french icon actress today; Dussolier extraordinary as always, one of the ten top best french actors; together with Michael Serrault, Gerard Depardieu, Daniel Auteil, he plays the perfect balance as the good father who reached the allowed limit. The question is What would you do with your son if he was a genius boy who refuses to follow the nature rules of the life?
Watch this enjoyable comedy. Ten thousand stars for this film.
A wonderful script, and dazzling direction.",1085961600,12,1157,4.969072164948454
