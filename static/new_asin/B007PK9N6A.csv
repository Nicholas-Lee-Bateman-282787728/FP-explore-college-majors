5103202,1,B007PK9N6A,"Although the summary promises music, the video was almost all commentary. We wanted to hear her sing--not listen to several pundits.",1373760000,,132,5.333333333333333
5103203,5,B007PK9N6A,Excellent standing novation awesome the most beautiful woman voice soul and character you ever meet hear and hold in your heart forever,1356652800,,135,5.181818181818182
5103204,5,B007PK9N6A,"Whitney Houston - The Greatest Love Of All, I always loved anythng by Whitney Houston and of course this was another hit with me. If you are a Whitney Houston fan, this is a must have.  Enjoy",1349654400,,191,4.162162162162162
5103205,1,B007PK9N6A,"Don't waste the money! Another amateur dvd done with copy and paste pics of Whitney, narrated by someone I've never heard of before!",1340582400,8,132,4.782608695652174
5103236,1,B007PK9N6A,"As a fan all of my life, I must say this video wasn't a good one at all. Rags to riches, by no means. The rotation of pictures and clips were boring and I feel was don't by second graders. I wouldn't by this personally but as for free, to kinda get an idea of her fame , it's OK. But by no means do it do her any justice.",1453420800,,321,3.6
5103237,1,B007PK9N6A,"totally agreed with those 1 star reviews. It has only photos and on-street interviews, cheaply made, like presentation slides. do not waste your time.",1439337600,,150,5.291666666666667
5103238,4,B007PK9N6A,Very good movie.,1438819200,,16,4.666666666666667
5103239,1,B007PK9N6A,"Horrible, extremely amatuer. After seeing the 3rd typo in the film I had to turn it off.",1418688000,,88,4.235294117647059
5103240,1,B007PK9N6A,Let's call this what it is... Garbage. :-T,1414972800,,42,4.375
5103241,1,B007PK9N6A,Poor quality,1414886400,,12,5.5
5103242,2,B007PK9N6A,Poorly done and very amateur show.  Not worth watching,1408838400,,54,5.0
5103243,4,B007PK9N6A,"New Hope is not ""tiny"" by anybody's standards...The sanctuary and choir stand easily seat 1000.  And Whitney's story is not rags riches by anybody's standards.  Her mom and cousin were already pro recording artists when she was born.  I hate to be a nit-picker but I feel that producers definately should be,,,those two flubs are right at the beginning of this video...",1386979200,3,369,4.919354838709677
5103244,1,B007PK9N6A,"I watched the first 10 minutes on Amazon Prime and had to stop. It looks like a 90s-era powerpoint presentation with a small selection of still photos repeated endlessly intersperested with radomly arranged facts about Whitney's life and then narrated like it was a ""Where Are They Now"" VH1 documentary. It's not worth your time or your money.",1382227200,,343,4.931034482758621
5103245,1,B007PK9N6A,"Unless you live and breathe Whitney you'll always be on the edge of your seat waiting for some footage of her singing,
interview sessions, concerts anything LIVE!!!
But the only thing ""Whitney"" in this video is built by using her name. This is a loooonnggg biography of the woman sprinkled
with on-street interviews of fans.
What a bait- and- switch film this is.
Don't waste your time.",1379462400,4,386,4.776119402985074
8520409,1,B007PK9N6A,what a waste of time.  This is just a narrator and a PowerPoint slide show.  The narrator's voice is one octave monotone for the whole movie.  There is no singing at all.,1495411200,,170,4.25
