2550130,5,B000F3GP3S,"Hi, is this dvd title real or fake?  Does it ever exist at all and who did produce it?  I am a Queen fan and how come I don't have one copy for myself; never even noticed, seen, or heard  ..on eBay, amazon, alibris, half, yahoo... even official QUEEN's website itself never says they ever released this dvd title at all, take a look yourself.  If this dvd really exists, I should be one of very important fans who get what want.  However, to leave something in reviewing about it, although I haven't consumed it yet but based on a few tracks from Innuendo I've seen them from Greatest Flix II: they are all superb and never die from my heart and soul, can never die, they are my favourites and I never let anyone touch my Queen dvds and collections and I've got to watch them only when I am alone too.  All Queen's films are very happy to watch and I know it from the heart that the artists and producers are happy to make it too and they really did their full best for every single of their works.  And that's it: all fans love Queen.  The Innuendo dvd is only one that I haven't had, and I need it.  To say, all Queen's films are absolutely much better to watch than watching any of Ed Wood's hollyweird movies.  But even Ed Wood's movies have all been reprinted, modified to color, and they can sell on dvds too.  Don't mind me of this comparison; I love to read Ed Wood's novels.  Just want to say if any of you guys does have a copy of this Innuendo dvd and doesn't want it anymore, can you just sell it to me?  I'll be waiting right everywhere.",1225411200,2,1550,4.1610738255033555
2550131,3,B000F3GP3S,"Since I love Queen I paid the inflated $50.00 plus sellers' price for this concert and found it to be, just an ""OK"" Queen live concert.  Queen performs expertly and Freddie even comes out at the end with wig and tight sweater similar to the outfit he wore during the ""I Want To Break Free"" video.  And there's some great music here but I'd have to agree with the earlier review about some of the audio and other problems with this recorded live concert.

The first 5 minutes or so, of the concert I could hardly hear Freddie's voice.  After that the audio was good to go but some of the ""smoke"" or ""dry ice"" on stage was so thick a few times I could only see Freddie's feet during the intros.

The crowd in Japan was kind of quiet too or maybe the audio had some problems again.

The fans knew most of Queen's songs and sang along during some 5 or more times but still seemed to be a pretty quiet group so a lot of the energy I'm used to seeing at a Queen concert was lacking from this DVD.

I'd definitely suggest ""Queen Live at Wembley Stadium"" and or ""Queen On Fire At The Bowl"" live concerts on DVD that were performed around this same 1985 time frame.  These two concerts are by far the best later live concerts from Queen.  For these two you can really see how they were in command of the concert goers and the video and audio is superb.  These two live concerts are also sold by Amazon directly, so no sticker price embellishments.

This ""Queen: Final Live in Japan 1985"" concert DVD's true sticker price is $11.99 US.",1180396800,,1525,4.260416666666667
2550132,3,B000F3GP3S,"As a longtime fan of Queen, since their first release, ""Keep Yourself Alive"", this disc lacks in audio and video quality.  The band performs their usual bang up performance, and the set list is consistent with their later shows, but camera angles are bad, video and audio production quality are lacking as well.  Again, I do enjoy this because I am a Queen fanatic, but there are other live concerts to own before making this live purchase.  Of course, the obvious first is Live Aid, which captures their entire Earthshaking performance.",1178928000,,537,4.8791208791208796
8116768,5,B000F3GP3S,"This is, without question, one of the best music documentaries that I have ever seen.  This documentary tells the story about everything about this unique music.  I hated for it to end and will not hesitate to watch it again.  If one is a fan of progressive rock and / or Queen, do not miss this.  Thank You...",1483747200,,310,4.293103448275862

8116771,5,B000F3GP3S,"ALTHOUGH A GOOD DVD THAT CAN STAND ON IT'S OWN, IT ALMOST SEEMS TO BE A COMPLIMENT TO ""DAYS OF OUR LIVES"", ANOTHER QUEEN BIO.  WATCH ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND YOU'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN.  IT SEEMS TO FURTHER EXPLAIN SOME THINGS FROM ""DAYS OF OUR LIVES"".  THEY SURE KNOW HOW TO MAKE 'EM.",1390694400,,280,4.054545454545455
8116772,2,B000F3GP3S,"As a Queen and Freddie lover who's seen much of what's out there, this didn't meet my expectations.  It glossed over a lot and for me didn't have anything new.  However, if you're looking for something that focuses more on the early years and is short, this may be for you.  The best documentary is The Great Pretender; that's the one I recommend.",1380672000,4,347,4.476190476190476
8116773,5,B000F3GP3S,"From explanation of Freddie's composing style and organization skills to the technical rcordings played in parts and then put together.... Then on to how the video was made in a few hours for just a few thousand, having to invent special effects as they created the best video and song of our age. As if all that wasn't enough, filming of attempts at explaining the lyrics as poetry by the English professors at prestigious universities.
- The whole thing fascinated me.
I want a copy. Please find it.",1376438400,,501,4.704545454545454
8116774,5,B000F3GP3S,I loved it. Freddie Mercury is the greatest front man in the history of music. Queen still lives on and will forever. RIP Freddie.,1373760000,3,130,4.458333333333333
8116775,2,B000F3GP3S,"This DVD would NOT play on my TV's DVD player. I had to find another DVD player to watch it. Also,
one of the men interviewed multiple times sounded like he had mush in his mouth. I could not understand
his message.",1368576000,3,215,4.142857142857143
8116776,4,B000F3GP3S,"liked it a lot because there are not many dvd's that zero in on Freddie mercury.  it is a short documentary.  I have seen some of the clips of this on other dvd's.  I think days of our lives and Freddie mercury-the great pretender were better and went into more depth.  bottom line is, I do not think anyone will ever truly know Freddie except for the roger, brian, john, and mary.",1368576000,3,381,4.25
8116777,5,B000F3GP3S,"I've been on a Queen binge now for the last few months. I can't believe that I never heard one of their songs on the radio until 1981. They are truly the most underrated band in rock history. This DVD provided some background info that I hadn't heard before, so that alone makes it worth the purchase for me. Their concert DVDs are extraordinary, especially the concerts in Budapest (excellent sound and video), Montreal, Wembley, and Live Aid.",1365811200,19,444,4.705128205128205
