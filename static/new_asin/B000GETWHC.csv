8131258,3,B000GETWHC,"This is an above-average Spanish suspense thriller. It is five years since a botched hotel robbery left two people dead and the third in a coma. Now the comatose victim dies and Raquel (Itziar Ituo), a journalist who witnessed the crime from her apartment across the street is asked to write an article on it for her newspaper. As she digs into the unsolved case, she finds that she is more involved in it than she realised. How is the death of her husband in a traffic accident that same night linked to the crime? The director's choice of running past and present storylines concurrently, intercutting one with the other, was initially confusing and takes some getting used to. I thought there were a few too many neat coincidences. The ending, despite its twist, was an anticlimax. I can understand the director's intention - Raquel comes to terms with the past and learns to forgive - I just didn't quite take to it. However the film as a whole is still worth watching.

The DVD from TLA however, is a disaster. The picture quality is mediocre. The print is exceedingly dark. Images are very soft, although not quite blurry. It is in 1.78:1 widescreen but letterboxed into a standard 4x3 screen. There is no anamorphic enhancement. English subtitles, in large white type, are burnt permanently onto the print. You don't have the option to turn them off. From the obligatory English subtitles, you would assume this DVD was produced for an English-speaking audience. However, the 20-minute ""Making of"" featurette is wholly in Spanish and if you don't understand Spanish, you're out of luck. For some reason, no subtitles are provided here whatsoever. I should have learnt from past DVDs to give TLA a wide berth. This may be worth a rental but I wouldn't recommend a purchase.",1157932800,,1779,4.7947882736156355
