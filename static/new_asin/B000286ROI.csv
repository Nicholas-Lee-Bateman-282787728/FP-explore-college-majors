2066536,5,B000286ROI,"O. Henry was such a great short story writer, with not only good themes and plots, but insight, and ""The Last Leaf,"" proves it.  I think the price of the movie is a little high, for its duration, but then you're buying a short story in motion, and I suppose anything by O.Henry is worth a little more.  The movie, is done as well as can be, which doesn't call for a Great Hollywood set. I liked it. Dennis L. Siluk",1275696000,2,414,4.098765432098766

Susan got pneomonia and was bedridden so she keeps watching the branch of leaves outside her bedroom window and wants to live until the last leaf falls from the branch.the painter who lives in the same building who has wanted to create a masterpiece paints the last leaf outside her window to show her that the last leaf is still there.

8023441,1,B000286ROI,This isn't the movie I had originally seen .. m this was the worst acting ever ... so bad I threw it in the garbage rather than give it to someone else. ... it really was awful .... it felt like the two ladies who starred in it had never acted before ... I was really looking forward to watching this and kept it on hoping it would get Better ... it never did . Waste of money and time.,1392940800,2,386,3.8375
