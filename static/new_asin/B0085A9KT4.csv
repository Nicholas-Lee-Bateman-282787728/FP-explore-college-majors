5132751,1,B0085A9KT4,"This movie could have been a great low budget ""found footage""  horror movie.  However, what stopped the movie from fully reaching it's potential is how little money was spent on the movie. The most expensive thing in the movie was the car they used to drive around. I mean the car had built in navigation, which set some one back a pretty penny.  There was like one special effect in the movie, and that was the standard ghost in the back ground scene, which gets closer and closer as lights and camera flicker in and out.

With all of that being said, the movie did have a couple of parts that really bought some tension. However, they happened with the screen being completely black...I guess they were saving up their money for the ghost girl shot, which would come probably about 20 minutes later. I think this movie could have been good had they decided to spend more than a 100 bucks.  In closing, you should save your self some trouble and bypass this movie.",1344297600,2,965,4.491428571428571
5132752,1,B0085A9KT4,I truly thought this movie was going to be good but it wasn't it was truly a freaking disappointment. For one leave these haunted houses alone leave the dead alone and in the end what happened they all died I REALLY HATED THIS MOVIE.,1344297600,2,233,4.318181818181818

5132755,1,B0085A9KT4,"Lemme keep this short. You will go insane with boredom in the first 20 minutes, but it just keeps going on, and on, and on. Not the least bit scary, not a single chill or thrill. I really think this movie was an exercise is boring the audience, which is easily the scariest aspect of the film. From the totally unwatchable ""couple"" at the beginning (one of those couples where you automatically think, really? she (beautiful) would be with him (i won't make personal insulting comments about physical appearance here, but you get my point) - not in this lifetime would they be a couple (thank you, lazy, near-sighted casting director). The interaction between them is painfully phony. OK, moving on... the rest of the movie is really much more as though someone left their camera on while recording a fairly routine day. seriously. that's it.

OH, and lest I forget the WORST PART OF ALL - the cast literally READS 1/3 of the dialog from paper they printed out as part of the story. It's maddeningly painful to watch, unless you enjoy watching paint dry or grass grow.

It's staggeringly shocking that anyone financed this project to completion and thought they might make a penny back.",1361923200,3,1186,4.72463768115942
5132756,1,B0085A9KT4,Wow. This movie was awful! It was boring and the characters annoyed me. Who goes into an abandoned house? What is wrong with you? I mean seriously. It had terrible acting. I want the hour and a half of my life back.,1349740800,3,215,4.142857142857143
5132757,1,B0085A9KT4,"The only good rating on here was actually writtten by the blonde ""actress:"" under the pen name JE Goettling... or Jordan Elizabeth Goettling... you can find her full name on IMDB. This is the only review I've ever written, but it was such a disappointing waste of money and time that I had to comment. The two guys in the moviee were apparently HUGE pansies and dumbasses who tried to pull of the plywood over the windows without trying to take off the little over-boards that had only a few nails in each. And since when does 911 make calls to people??? ...people with no cell service? And the main dude couldn't even kick in a door (or try to kick it in) when his fianc is on the other side??
Sssssstttttuuuuppppid movie. I've sneezed out scarier stuff.",1347580800,2,755,4.478260869565218
5132758,1,B0085A9KT4,"I was not a fan of the first ""Knock Knock"" film which littered the Walmart bargain bins until I picked up a copy. I am not sure what this film has to do with the first one.

Nothing says cheap like a 911 transcript, hand held cameras, and people screaming in the dark. Four young adults, whose acting careers were over before they started, decide to do their own Hollywood haunted tour, visiting famous locations of grizzly murders, suicides, and hauntings. Don't worry, if you were napping when they read about the Black Dahlia, they re-read it again and again. I did scream during the third reading, but not out of fright. Now this wouldn't make for too bad of a film in itself if they had more than $20 to spend on a script and special effects. Toss in a creepy GPS navigator that takes them to the haunted home, some red dyed Karo syrup, and a shower scene and you got yourself a classic.

They eventually make it to a 1666 house and get locked in where it is deemed that bad acting and filming is a capital offense.  Writer, director, producer Chris Sheng now owes me an apology and $2.00.

5132759,1,B0085A9KT4,"I was really prepared to like this movie.  I've enjoyed pretty much every ""found footage"" film I've seen, but this one breaks the streak big time.  Too bad - it had a great premise, the actors were likeable, and the initial set up seemed very well done.  But then... nothing.  No scares, no subtle use of psychology, just a haunted house movie without any convincing haunting.  Be aware that the kids only actually get into one house.  They spend a lot of time driving to other houses and standing on front lawns, but then only get inside the final one.  Someone mentioned a ""ghost"" special effect, but I sure didn't see it.  Nothing but screaming at things supposedly happening off camera.

I don't need gore to enjoy a movie - Paranormal Activity kept me awake for a month listening to odd creaks in my house.  But this one takes the philosophy of ""what happens off screen is scarier than what happens on"" to reductio ad absurdum, by trying to scare us with essentially nothing at all.  Then the movie ends.  With another ten minutes of reshot and edited footage, this could be a very good movie, but as is it seems more like a semester project by a film student with no budget or imagination.

BTW - if you're fighting for your life to get out of a house, are a couple of small pine 2x4's with a single layer of OSB going to slow you down for more than a minute?  Seriously doubt it.",1345766400,,1386,4.3843137254901965
5132760,1,B0085A9KT4,"Nice try, Lionsgate, but I question the 'genius' move of renaming this movie Knock Knock 2 for a myriad of reasons. It obviously has nothing at all to do with the first one, it's in a completely different sub-genre (the first was a slasher while this is a found footage film) Plus I strongly doubt anyone of the 15 people who had the supreme misfortune of seeing the first Knock Knock would ever want second helpings of that cinematic cesspool anyway.

But I digress, this movie regardless of the title is utterly awful. Imagine ""Paranormal Activity"" made with a lot less money, few fewer scares (knock knock 2 has none whatsoever), worse actors, and a woefully unengaging storyline. Now this film is 5 times worse than whatever you've just thought of. A complete mess beginning to end.",1345420800,4,786,4.737226277372263
5132761,1,B0085A9KT4,"This movie was 82 minutes of nothing,anything that might be scary happens in complete darkness, you see none of it,complete waste of time.",1345334400,,138,5.043478260869565

8525413,1,B0085A9KT4,This film has nothing to offer other than a macabre Hollywood history. No real story of its own. Nothing to see or fear. Watching actors pretending to be scared of no real threats gets old fast. So DON'T! waste your hour and a half on this.,1516752000,,240,4.239130434782608

8525415,1,B0085A9KT4,"I love found footage movies, except this one. There is a lot of useless nonsense for the first two-thirds of the movie, and then once it starts supposedly getting ""scary"", you can hardly understand what's going on. Zero jump scares, zero creeps - just one big zero. Annoying, gutless characters. Do not waste your time!",1454025600,2,319,4.818181818181818
8525416,1,B0085A9KT4,"The acting wasn't that bad for a found footage documentary-style film,but the story & scares were seriously lacking.",1443830400,2,116,5.5
8525417,3,B0085A9KT4,"First off I have to admit that I did not see the first film and I am wagering that has no significant impact on this films value. ""Knock Knock 2"" after watching the found footage horror flick left me fragmented in my opinion of it. The film follows four 20-somethings on a joyful horror venture to some pretty famous haunts around the L.A. area on Halloween night. ""Knock Knock 2"" is stereotypical found footage. It is a paranormal ghost story that mirrors other stories but told in a reluctantly creative way. After taking their joy ride to several areas of famous deaths such as Sharon Tate, The Black Dahlia, and George Reeves they venture to one final haunt before calling it a night. This is where the story really begins to take hold and validate the plot line and basically it's whole reasoning for being made. I say that because although the movie starts with the innocent general get-to-know-the cast routine and set up the following events there is really nothing of value or interest that happens for nearly thirty-six full minutes of this film, maybe longer. Even the trips to the first haunts seem trite. Harsh I know.

How this movie manages to leave me fragmented is in the sudden and emotionally charged way the action and nightmare really takes off. Once the group get to that final f*cking horror house the sh*t really hits the fan. The tension and suspense picks up. There is a sudden chill to the atmosphere of the film that makes you thankful that you held on to the story instead of hitting stop or quitting the film. The camera stylizing is typical trick ponies as far as found footage go but in this film you are given a clear and present environment as opposed to some dark shady questionable surrounding that leaves you wondering ""where are they?"". The death scenes are not all that gratuitous or gory but they happen suddenly with eerie background sound effects and the impact of what unfolds is intense and entertaining.

So ""Knock Knock 2"" is one of those that fits kinda in the middle of the paranormal found footage pile that has come out lately. It isn't a bad movie to watch, just hang in through the first thirty-five or forty minutes. It isn't one that will leave you scratching your head either- thinking how creative or intense the minds behind it must be. This paranormal ghost flick is great for the casual horror watcher that doesn't want to be too grossed out or deal with too much suspense and yet it has enough of a scare as it picks up in the middle to really leave you holding your breath at the end. I am glad I saw the film but don't think I would have missed much waiting for it to hit cable networks either.",1431216000,,2656,4.53125
