First, I love Ramna 1/2, the TV series and the games are really good, but then you get the movie and see how well it works live action!!!

I wasn't too sure about this movie when I saw it for sale, so I took a gamble and got it and really loved it! Usually anime to movie adaptations are, but this is a rare gem! The thing that made it work was really the actors. These actors really seem like they have watched the series and really studied their characters. I really believed what I saw coming from them. Also, the accuracy is pretty much dead on. The only difference was that Ranma's secret wasn't really a secret to Dr. Tofu, yet Tatewake Kuno is STILL just completely blind to the fact even though Ranma transformed right in front of him. Going back to accuracy, Ranma has done this many times in the TV show, so it is expected.

One thing I really appreciated that few people might catch is that Ranma male and Ranme female did look pretty similar and with Ranma female still trying to act like a boy made it really believable! Genma was exactly the same, anytime he was in trouble, he would turn into a panda and hold up signs to show what he is trying to say. I don't know how, but they pulled it off! Yes, Genma and Soun still play Shogi! Nabiki still finds ways to make quick money and Kasumi is just like she is in the cartoon. The Tendo training room was just like the cartoon, even Akane's room had the little pig on there that said Akane on it. It is really a live adaptation of the cartoon! The action, romance, and comedy is all perfectly balanced! This movie delivers in a way that many live action presentations cannot. One cool special effect feature and probably my favorite special effect in the whole movie was towards the end when Ranma used the powerful Shichihokoda. Unlike Lui Kang's anticlimactic fireball technique in the Mortal Kombat movie, this one was really cool!

The characters: (all played their parts better than in the TV series)
Ranma male (performs all the crazy tricks he performs in the TV series)
Ranma female (is actually a little shorter than Ranma male and yes, has a bigger cup size than Akane, this is important because throughout the whole series, Ranma makes fun of Akane for this)
Genma Saotome (plays Genma flawlessly)
Akane Tendo (see how she feels about Dr. Tofu, what happened, why her hair is short)
Nabiki Tendo (still the amazing blackmail artist, but in this case, I like her better than the anime version)
Kasumi Tendo (still the sweetest girl that is always nice to anyone, even when in danger)
Soun Tendo (actually does something other than play Shogi the whole time with Genma)
Tatewake Kuno (still can't figure out that Ranma IS the pigtailed girl)
Gosunkugi (just like in the game and the TV series, always taking pictures, seems to become Kuno's righthand person)
Dr. Tofu (played perfectly and shows his set of martial arts)
Vice Principal (good thing they did not go with the ALOHA principal like in the TV show)
Happousai (the master is just mentioned, but you never see him)

Characters that did not appear (Ones that I remember from the games and the TV show):
Mousse, Ryoga Hibiki, Shampoo, Cologne, Lin-lin, Lun-lun, Ukkyo, King, Kodachi Kuno, and Pantyhose

The plot:
Starts off similar to the TV series, but the main plot was definitely not what I expected. Since it is such a twist, I really don't want to ruin it because what I saw was probably one of the funniest plots I have ever seen in a movie and I had never expected such a plot.

Other things about the movie and bluray version:
(changed from DVD review)
This is the real licensed version of the Ranma 1/2 live action movie. Unlike the DVD version, there is no commercial in the middle of the movie, higher quality than the DVD, extra special effects were added in this movie commonly seen in animes, no logos on the picture anywhere, the boxart and text is correct.
The only downside to this movie is that there is no English audio or subtitles. This movie only has Channel 1 (5.1 surround) Japanese audio and Stream 1 Japanese subtitle. If you NEED English subtitles, grab the unlicensed DVD, watch it one time, then get the bluray version after you know what is being said and watch it for a better experience.

Important to parents and those who must have fan service:
Ranma is NEVER naked and you never see her chest like how she likes to show in the cartoon, this is child friendly! If this movie were rated, I would probably call it PG because there is no bad language, no nudity, no suggestive themes, and violence really isn't bad.

Bottom-line, if you like Ranma 1/2 in anyway at all, or just want a good action-romance-comedy movie, then definitely grab this!! I can only hope that there is another movie featuring this same cast in the making! :)",1358294400,4,4928,4.54054054054054

only problem for me i forgot to check if the Blue Ray had English subtitles which it does not so i bought the dvd as well. you know what i didn't care it was still funny.",1357344000,,396,3.888888888888889
