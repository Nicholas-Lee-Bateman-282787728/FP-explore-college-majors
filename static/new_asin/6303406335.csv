7846257,5,6303406335,"Plot:  A scout ship with a Romulan defector is attacked by Romulan Warbird and sends a distress signal.  The Enterprise responds and beams aboard the Romulan defector, Setal.  He claims that the Romulans are building a base on Nelvana 3, and within 48 hours, they'll launch an assault to take over the Neutral Zone.  If the Enterprise destroys the base, then the crisis will be over.  Well, no one really believes him at face value, but they double check with intelligence gathering and such.  It turns out that the Romulan ""Setal"", is actually Admiral Jarok, a high ranking officer who has a history of engagements with the Federation.  So, is this a plot for an excuse to start a war, or is the admiral telling the truth?

A relatively simple plot (is he telling the truth or not) with plenty of complications resulting in it as they dig deeper.  It's interesting that Adm. Jarok defected because he didn't want his daughter to possibly be killed in a war, even if it meant that she would grow up thinking her father was a traitor.

An excellent episode, probably one of the best involving the Romulans.  A top ten for sure, so it recieves it's 5 stars easily.",1158451200,,1162,4.592233009708738
7846258,5,6303406335,"Guest star James Sloyan is riveting as the ""defector"" in the episode's title. Almost like a companion piece to ""Deep Space Nine's 'Duet'"", the show is an exercise in the politics and machinations of war.
Like the best ""Treks,"" this one mixes science fiction with biting social commentary.  This third season offering was one of the best.",1008115200,6,337,4.912280701754386
7846259,5,6303406335,"The Defector is the best Episode of Star Trek in my book.  I like how the writers of Star Trek are telling us that every culture has its flaws.  The Federation has the little worm things (conspiracy), the klingons have civil wars (Redemption), the Ferengi have Moogie, the Cardassians have the dominion, and the Romulans have defectors.
Besides seeing the mighty Romulan Empire become more realistic, I like the events that show the inner workings of Starfleet.  Suddenly, the Enterprise is far enough away that recordings have to be sent, and conversations happen over days, not minutes.  The Enterprise can now make deals with alien races on its own, and the Starfleet Intelligence Network begins to show promise (section 31?  Maybe).  But if you want one that will keep you thinking, look at this one.",972432000,13,804,4.9185185185185185
7846260,5,6303406335,"Classic STAR TREK's two (hard to believe, but that's all there were) episodes depicting Romulans were very much one-man shows:  Mark Lenard as the very noble Romulan in BALANCE OF TERROR and Joanne Linville as the  passionate Romulan commander in THE ENTERPRISE INCIDENT.
THE DEFECTOR is  Admiral Alidar Jarok, strategist, war hero, butcher, and traitor --  depending on your point of view.  But what of Jarok's point of view?
Skillfully introduced by Picard's and Data's evocation of ""a little  touch of Harry in the night"" from HENRY V, Jarok shows that the  ""king's cause"" -- or that of the Romulan Star Empire is one  thing, but the cause of his own conscience is more powerful  yet.
Skillfully played, the character takes us from one reversal to the  other, one step behind the ENTERPRISE's crew, which is often angry, often  contemptuous at the first defector in Romulan history.  Curiously, the one  who is most compassionate to him is Data.
Jarok knows what he can expect,  what he has sacrified, and what his people will do to him.  But he has done  it for love of his baby daughter, and the scene in which he explains this  to Picard puts, for once, the intrepid Captain firmly in the  wrong.
Picard closes the show with what one hopes is a promise that can  be kept.",959126400,,1277,4.671171171171171
