Strokes of Genius came out with six different videos showcasing the personal lives and artistic contributions of the principal leaders of the Abstract Expressionist movement. Look for more video reviews of this important six-part series.

Franz Kline is one of my favorites! I admire him for his courage and risky, large-scale black and white abstractions. He died in 1962 - and it has somewhat bothered me lately that technically, I could have met him! Given the timing, I could have also met Matisse, Picasso, Diebenkorn and Mir... but I digress! This VHS video is short - just thirty minutes long. Great for having in your library for a quick pick me up. You may be amazed (like I was) at his early skill level of paintings and drawings. They look very fresh and contemporary, even today.

Kline had a great deal of confidence, took lots of classes and finally announced triumphantly, ""I got it!"" From that point, he started his large scale, solid form paintings we all know so well.

Stokes of Genius: Franz Kline captures Elaine and Willem de Kooning, as well as others, reminiscing about those early days of abstract development. As Elaine remarked, ""We never considered ourselves poor - we just didn't have any money.""",1232841600,,1284,4.853881278538813
8001289,3,B0000DJE9S,"This is one of the few vhs/dvd's available about Franz and his work so you have to be patient with it, the video starts off slow and seems to be more about the history of the Village and has DeKooning and his wife Elaine talking about the old days and what people did for fun and where people ate and drank. It's very choppy at first and doesn't get around to really showing pictures of Franz and his best known art until the half way point, and in a thirty minute video that's not much time to cover the complex ideas and forms he is famous for creating. However, if you can pick up a used copy then I would buy it at least to have it in my video library of great artists. I only wish it had been longer and more detailed.",1111968000,9,723,4.027777777777778
