7911856,2,B00000J2KJ,"This was never released to DVD as far as I know, and it is obvious why. In a word: it's stupid. 3 episodes from a TV series poorly drawn, with scenes between intended to connect the stories are even worse drawn. And, I am disappointed that Meg only shows up in this inserted bridges as she is the one character from the original theatrical feature that I liked. Best part is when she sings The Man I Love at the end of the video. Most of the video  consists of 3 lame, juvenile episodes of the TV series, with regular characters of Icarus (French Stewart), Cassandra (Sandra Bernhard), and Adonis (Diedrich Bader). Zeus appears in the third episode (here voiced by Cory Burton, not Rip Torn), and Phil (Robert Costanzo) only appears in the very beginning. Very little good can be said about the video. Based on the ending credits the animation was farmed out to numerous animation companies, with the main animation by Walt Disney Animation Australia Pty. The drawing is below average, and scripts are stupid. Only the third one, where Zeus pretends to be a mortal teenager is good, and only because of the presence of Hades, who is funny. It is indicative of a poor show when the villain is the most interesting character.",1466812800,,1223,4.610091743119266
7911857,1,B00000J2KJ,Disappointed that it wasn't a dvd like i thought i ordered. Like the movie just not in VHS.,1433462400,,91,4.111111111111111
7911858,5,B00000J2KJ,We were so happy to finally find this movie at an affordable price. It was a big hit on Christmas morning. It arrived quickly and safely packaged. Thank you.,1296259200,,157,4.448275862068965
7911859,5,B00000J2KJ,"If you are expecting this to be a sequal to Disney's Hercules...you will be let down tremendously, not because it's bad...but because it's not a sequal. It is not a ""Full Length Movie"" either. What it is is a few episodes of Disney's Hercules TV Series put onto tape. And I may say...it is FANTASTIC for what it is.
All of the episodes on this tape (The First Day of School, The YearBook, The Grim Avenger, and and the Visit from Zeus) are truly some of the best in the series. If you are a fan of the movie, or the series...this is definatley worth watching. All of the Herc-Humor is their. Plus...all of the voice actors, with the exception of Danny Davito, have all returned to voice their characters, which makes the experiance more enjoyable. This tape will satify all the Die-hard Herc fans over until Disney decides to release the show on DVD.
Sure...the actual animation is so-so...but it's still better than Dragon Ball Z...and A WHOLE LOT more entertaining to watch!",1157241600,2,976,4.614942528735632
7911860,4,B00000J2KJ,"Yes, Hercules is back and the movie opens, after Hercules (Tate Donovan) and Meg (Susan Egan) got married and are moving into a home together. But when stuff from Hercules' high schools days, gets delievered to him, he has it sent back to Philoctetes ""Phil"" (Robert Costanzo). But Meg badly wants to see Hercules's hish school stuff. But Hercules is embrassed by it, because high school was not one of Hercules' favorite of his life. (And I don't blame him). So Meg sneaks off to find Phil, and he tells of Hercules first days in high school.",1037232000,,542,4.597938144329897
7911861,5,B00000J2KJ,"This video is not REALLY a sequel, it's not REALLY a new feature length movie. What this video REALLY is, is a compilation of 3 episodes of the very funny and entertaining Disney's Hercules animated TV series.
  The video takes three episodes of the TV show and links them together with some rather badly done animation of Hercules and Megara moving into their new home together after their Honeymoon. Megara comes across Herc's High School Yearbook, er, scroll, and suddenly wants to know more about Herc's High School days. She rides on Pegasus to visit Phil, Herc's trainer/manager, and he gives her the whole story. This is where the episodes of the TV show take over. First we have Herc's First Day At (High) School. In the second story, a new student comes to Herc's school, who is actually a Batman type superhero, and the pair teams up to fight a menacing monster. In the third story, Herc's dad Zeus poses as a teenager to see what life is like for Herc. Meanwhile, his brother Hades plans a hostile takeover.
  The video ends with Meg singing a pretty horrid song to the man of her dreams, but the heart of the video, the episodes of the wonderful TV show, earn it a five star rating from me, and I wish Disney would give us more episodes of their wonderful shows on video, preferably DVD. But I wish they knew that the wraparound stories are really unnecessary. Hercules: Zero To Hero, is a great buy for anyone who enjoyed the TV show, but remember that this IS a TV show. Don't expect spectacular animation. At least most of the original voice actors reprised their roles for this TV series, and James Woods always rocks as Hades!",1023840000,7,1643,4.559322033898305
