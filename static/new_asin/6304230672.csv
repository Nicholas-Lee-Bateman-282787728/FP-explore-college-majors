838594,2,6304230672,"Really wanted to give this one 3-stars, but the excess, and ill-timing, of crude humor, simply made it impossible.
I thought this might be okay for kids to watch, since kids usually really get a kick out of that kind of thing, but the bad language makes it inappropriate for that purpose, as well.

I initially sat down to watch this with my niece, but when we heard a curse word, I had to watch it later.
(Feels wrong to watch something I wouldn't want my niece to watch, and I suppose that would be 99% of all films)

Otherwise, there are definitely some funny moments in this movie, so if you are wondering whether or not it's a worthy watch, then you should just go for it.
It's not a bad movie, I just rate films in terms of overall quality, and not solely on whether or not it might be entertaining enough to tolerate.

There is a difference between something being amusing, and something making you legitimately laugh, though, and I'd say that most of this movie is amusing, and there might be one or two laughs.
The scene where the technician tries to stop him from leaving the lab, the first time, made me laugh, and some of the things the family said, from time-to-time, also made me laugh.

Production value was fine, costuming was good, it had some cheesy effects, and the casting was decent.
Obviously, this movie is all about Eddie Murphy flailing his arms in every direction, so the fact that the casting was only so-so can sort of be overlooked, but the plot had some weak points.

Specifically, the ending was anti-climactic, and poor, overall.
There is no way those two would end up together, and his conclusion about everything was absurd.

If a quick fix to weight loss, like that, was even remotely effective, it would be worth many billions of dollars.
So, everything concluding with his idea that he would always be fat, and there are no shortcuts, is pretty silly, because people transform their physique all the time, and he had the key to a quick solution in his hands, anyways.

Instead of being pretentiously sincere, they should have milked it, and turned it into a gag.
That would've been much better.

P.S.
Dave Chapelle was under utilized in this film.",1513728000,,2184,4.567774936061381
838595,3,6304230672,This is a pretty good movie.  It is always fun to watch Eddie Murphy when he plays multiple roles.  And the scene at the dinner table is worth watching the movie for.  I was never a big fan of Jerry Lewis.  And I like this movie better then the original.,1513036800,,254,4.02

838842,4,6304230672,"Released in 1996 and directed by Tom Shadyac, The Nutty Professor is a dramedy starring Eddie Murphy as grossly overweight yet good-hearted professor Sherman Klump. In his experiments he develops a potion that turns him into the slim, charismatic Buddy Love whos also, unfortunately obnoxious. While Buddy helps Sherman take down his nemeses (Dave Chappelle), he also messes up his budding relationship with Carla (Jada Pinkett Smith). Larry Miller and James Coburn are also on hand.

Murphy actually has multiple roles, playing the Richard Simmons-like Lance Perkins, as well as Shermans mother, father, grandmother and brother in the dinner sequences. While I found the Lance Perkins scenes amusing, the dinner scenes largely fall flat, but they do showcase Murphys talents.

I also didn't care for the flatulence jokes, but I was able to overlook them  and crude jokes in general  and laughed at the many genuinely amusing parts. The movie works because Murphy expertly makes Sherman a sympathetic character. The scene where he shyly asks Carla out is genius; and the scene where their date is destroyed by the standup comic (Chappelle) is honestly saddening. It may not be as good as ""Coming to America"" (1988), but it's better than ""Trading Places"" (1983).

The film runs 95 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area.

Nobody else could have pulled off this role and made this film as good as it was. It's always been kind of a stupid story, but Murphy played into that and turned it into something that both kids and adults would find funny.

839856,4,6304230672,"This is a classic movie, albeit a remake.  Remake, just like song covers, are only good if you add new takes and ideas to it.  The Nutty Professor successfully alters an old classic and created a new one.  And just as important to being a good remake, all comedies needs constant laughs over a fairly simple plot, which this does.  I always consider the 1990s as one of the best decade for comedies - this being one of them.

I am cautious which DVDs I upgrade to Bluray.  It's a mess to spend more money on movies you already paid for, but for $11.99 (March 2012) I was happy to spend the money and replace my ""2 movie edition"" DVD of Nutty professor and its sequel, which is a terrible, unfunny movie that no one should consider watching...ever (it was the only DVD version of the original at the time).  Part of my movie collection is a personal library and (as sad as you want to consider it) a collection of my taste.  Having ""THE KLUMPS"" on there was an insult to my integrity.  So moving on, I was happy to upgrade this movie without knowing how good or bad the bluray transfer was.  Any how it is?  It's OK.  Yes, it's better than the DVD and looks good but could look a lot better.  I'd give the blurry transfer a B.  A lot of the movie looks darker than it should - as if someone needs to slide the 'fill light' lever up a bit.  Bluray can look much better.

Don't let the cover image of the blurry case (100th Anniversary UNIVERSAL) fool you, its only on the card-stock slip-cover, which I always throw out.  The actual cover is your standard Bluray without the rubbish studio gloat.

Extra features are non-existent.  In fact, the menu has an ""extras"" button but then gives you two options to watch bits about UNIVERSAL, which I don't even care to open.  Why do studios think people care about THEM verse the filmmakers who make the good movies?  When a movie trailer boasts that a studio brought it to them (like, ""from the studio that brought you Gone With The Wind') you know it's bad because they have to use the most extreme connection to a good movie as possible unlike utilizing a talented creative that is attached.

In the end, if you are itching to upgrade, you won't be leaping for joy with this disc, but will be happy it's on blurry - it's a worthy upgrade if you value spending an extra $12 to do so and will be satisfied.  This is a great movie and Eddie Murphy shows just how funny and talented he is - now if he would only do more movies with jokes in them.",1331164800,,2486,4.2762312633832975

839858,4,6304230672,"***This review may contain spoilers**

Even though a vast majority of the human population (present company included) does not possess, shall we say, a Greco-Roman physique, we nevertheless often belittle and disregard the overweight as somehow inferior.  In the movies, this hypocritical bias is even more extreme.  If an overweight person is (seldom) portrayed in a movie (whether as a star or in a supporting role), he/she will be either slow-witted, ill-tempered, clumsy, lazy, or some combination of all four.  Most often, the overweight person will be there for one-dimensional comic relief.  Eddie Murphy's character Sherman Klump in ""The Nutty Professor"" (hereafter ""Nutty"") goes a long way to correct most, if not all, of the overweight movie stereotypes, and against those hostile odds present an admirable human being indeed.

Actually, Sherman in ""Nutty"" is mainly an inimitable character with many positive qualities.  He is a brilliant, mostly well-respected biologist capable of revolutionary discoveries.  Sherman is cultured, polite, dignified, charismatic and gracious, even under the most trying circumstances.  He lives in a respectable apartment.  He has a loving, if outspoken, family.  Actually, apart from his obesity (and the inevitable maladroitness that comes with it), Sherman's only real shortcoming is his shyness and lack of self-assertion, especially around women. Even so, when Sherman meets beautiful but demure Wellman College colleague Carla Purdy (Jada Pinkett-Smith), her demure demeanor somehow gives him the courage to ask her out on a date. Sherman's life seems complete.  However, when Sherman and Carla attend a comedy show, and Sherman endures a withering (but funny) barrage of fat jokes by kamikaze comedian Reggie (Dave Chappelle), the hurt and humiliation compel Sherman into a fateful decision.

Never one to whine about his lot, Sherman determinedly (and hilariously) has tried every conceivable regimen (diet, exercise, acupuncture) to lose the pounds.  Eventually, he begins to make progress, but not quickly enough.  However, the weight-reduction serum Sherman has been distilling and testing on hamsters will accelerate the process.  So after the comedy club debacle, Sherman impulsively swigs some of the serum, which astoundingly transforms him into the svelte, dynamic Buddy Love (Eddie in ""real life"", without the padding).

Trouble is, Sherman/Buddy may be more slender, but the serum somehow boosts his testosterone levels alarmingly so that the handsome stud also becomes insufferable, loud, and embarrassing.  These qualities simultaneously attract and repel Carla and the audience.  Buddy's abrasive manner isn't the only problem.  It seems that the serum has only a temporary effect and tends to wear off at inopportune moments, such as when Buddy's transformation back to portly Sherman interrupts his date with Carla and eventually gets him wedged inside a Viper sports car.  And so it progresses.  With each Sherman/Buddy change and reversion, the audience slowly learns that, counter to what Sherman initially believes, fewer and fewer people prefer Buddy.  In fact, the subconscious impermanence of the serum indicates, to me anyway, that Sherman really, and correctly, prefers himself to Buddy.

However, alter ego Buddy soon shows his selfish monstrousness.  With his devious talk, his promiscuity, and his plotting, Buddy causes Sherman to lose just about everything good in his life - job, home, a social life.  Worst of all, Sherman will lose his very identity if Buddy manages to take two timed gulps of his formula to remain Buddy forever. Like Jekyll fighting Hyde, Sherman literally has to get his life back.  At an ornate gala where a pharamaceutical manufacturer Harlan Hartley (James Coburn) is expected to fund Sherman's college research, the fight does occur.  After a titanic struggle, Sherman reclaims his body.  Again, in a dignified heartfelt speech Sherman apologizes for the calamities, hurt, and chaos he has caused as Buddy and finally learns that you have to love and be comfortable with yourself.  This candor impresses Harlan enough to make the grant, and charms Carla enough to accept a dance with Sherman.

Funny thing about the fat jokes, comments, and slapstick throughout the movie - we laugh at them, but not at the person who endures them.  Whether getting stuck in a chair or car, or erasing a blackboard with his belly, or getting chewed out by a venal, insulting, weaselly dean (Larry Miller) or struggling to walk up stairs or exercise, Sherman preserves his dignity and likeability.  We even wince a little, because such a nice, accomplished person should not have to put up with such misadventures.  Through the laughter, we urge Sherman to find the courage, self-assertion, and self-love to get the happiness he deserves.  Even his seemingly uncouth and raunchy family (most members played by the versatile Murphy himself) point him in that direction; they may be fat and flatulent and undisciplined, but they also love and accept themselves exactly as they are.  In a distorted way, even Sherman's alter ego Buddy tries to urge Sherman forward. ""No matter what, you got to strut!""  And so Sherman ultimately does, because at heart, he was always a scholar and a gentleman.",1325116800,,5281,5.357575757575757

Eddie is remarkable as all these characters. I believe he plays seven in all. This is probably his biggest 'showcase' ever on film, demonstrating his comedic talents.

839937,4,6304230672,"Right off the bat - Eddie Murphy deserved an Oscar for his performance in this movie. Robbing him for this extraordinary performance that I dare say no other actor in Hollywood today could've pulled off with such ease and brilliance is one of the Academy's biggest oversights. While he did win the National Society of Film Critics award, Murphy wasn't even nominated for the Oscar. Granted, the history of head-scratching moves by the Academy could fill pages; neglecting Murphy's work in this movie seems like one of the best examples of how comedy is largely ignored by the Academy.
As for the movie, The Nutty Professor is crudely funny and highly enjoyable. Murphy is the only reason to watch the movie since he is on screen nearly the entire time in one character or another, and he never disappoints in any of the roles he plays. The plot is largely superfluous because the real treat of the movie is watching Murphy vamp and carry-on as only this comedic superstar can. This movie is Eddie Murphy on steroids and that makes for one hugely entertaining romp. If you wish to see one of the most impressive performances in cinema, catch The Nutty Professor and simply marvel at Murphy.

840067,4,6304230672,"Eddie Murphy did a great job in The Nutty Professor with his role as Professor Sherman Klump/Buddy Love and also playing the entire Klump family.  While watching scenes from the family dinners it is obvious what a great job Murphy did in this film.  Each of the family members has their own personality and quarks that make the otherwise pointless dinners very enjoyable and fun to watch.  The special effects and make-up used in this film are also amazing and they portrayed very real looking qualities.

Sherman Klump, a very bright professor who is also dealing with an obesity issue, finds himself falling for a colleague, Miss Carla Perdy.  Klump is convinced that he doesn't have a chance with Carla because of his appearance.  He believes that he needs to change himself in order to get Carla to appreciate him so he decides to try a formula, which he has been testing on hamsters, on himself.  The formula is a DNA restructuring chemical and when it is ingested by Klump he drops 300 pounds immediately.  This skinny, obnoxious and loud version of Professor Klump comes to be known as Buddy Love.  Buddy is very critical of people, especially obese people, and he is determined to take over Klump's body and his life.

This movies main objective is to show that you should be happy with yourself.  The jokes in this film were also carefully thought through so they wouldn't offend most viewers, especially overweight viewers.  I found this movie to be more enjoyable than the original, starring Jerry Lewis, which has very few similarities with this version.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a little comic relief.",1132272000,,1641,4.817857142857143
840068,2,6304230672,"Yes, Eddie Murphy is amazingly chameleonic in this reworking of Jerry Lewis' classic 1963 comedy.  Unfortunately, Eddie's not totally funny in this crass update.  If you're into flatulence or fat jokes, then this movie is right up your alley.  But its threadbare plot takes second place to Eddie's mugging not only of his title character and alter ego, but also all of the Klumps as well.  Jada Pinkett is the customary African/American woman who does her best (Like Halle Berry or Vanessa Williams) to look as Caucasian as she can.  The late James Coburn as a cameo role as a hotshot millionaire out to fund Murphy's research project, and Dave Chappelle has a bit as a stand up comic who is not all that funny either.  While the intentions are good, THE NUTTY PROFESSOR of 1996 doesn't capture the manic charisma of the one and only Jerry Lewis whose mugging was more charming than obnoxious.",1127347200,,893,4.7290322580645165

Slight changes in movie, but, premise is the same - kind-hearted, intelligent man with lot to offer is unable to see past his obesity to realize/believe that he can have someone in his life.  Eddie Murphy's ability to play different characters shows through just as brilliant as in ""Coming to America"".

Eddie Murphy has proven himself a talent of immense proportion. I laughed hysterically as Professor Klump was dumped on by the comedian in the night club, until Eddie's brilliant performance as a deeply hurt and embarrassed Sherman made me feel ashamed and almost bought tears to my eyes! Most of the family scenes were ad-libbed and were utterly hysterical. You have to watch that scene at least 3 or 5 times to catch all of the rapid fire comic moments that come off here! Some people missed Sherman faking the cutting of his wrists. Miss Purty's reactions to all of this was classic in itself. Sherman's dance to Teddy P and his serenade of his diet dinner was heart warming. This movie is a definate classic and gets funnier with every reviewing. I've seen it about 12 to 13 times, I still laugh out loud and clap at the end.",1027209600,,956,4.531791907514451

Klump has tried exercising, but used a Snickers bar as a weight. Deep depression set in after he met the woman of his dreams (Jada Pinkett-Smith) at the university. You should have seen the amount of M&M's he poured into his mouth. It was diabolical. I recall the scene where he ate dinner with his family at home and they were just disrespectful. The family must have forced out many ba-deeps and laughed about it. I thought I was getting sick. After that things just got worse for the professor. He went on a date with the woman of his dreams at a comedy club and the comedian made fun of him. ""It's a full moon tonight!"" Got to love that Dave Chappelle. Then Professor Klump drank his potion and became Buddy Love. An outgoing, noisy scumbag who was a completely different person from the loving Sherman. Jekyll and Hyde! Terrible! Another sequence showed Sherman Klump growing bigger and he had stomach trouble. You need to avoid the gas that spreads and blows everybody away like a tornado and then some fool ignites a match!

840536,4,6304230672,"Eddie Murphy would have to be my favourite actor.
He is very talented and shows it  in this film! He nearly plays as the whole family and does a dam good job at it. This movie is very funny. His family are pigs and the fart scene goes over board as he takes his new girlfriend (pinkett) to his house for dinner. Also buddy love steals the show Eddie murphy's other character more of a wild and funny character who gets the job done with out trying also captures pinketts eye and she starts falling for buddy!
Buddy is exremely funny. The Reggie scene is great and probably the funniest scene. This is another eddie murphy classic, and sits up there as 1 of his best, not the best but 1 of his best.
3 1/2 stars for the mivie and 1/2 star for Eddie murpheys talent as all the roles he played , even a grandma!!

This movie has got to be one of the funniest films of the last  decade, and it is rare that a remake is better than the original, but that  is the case here.  Eddie's version beats Jerry's hands down!  What more can  I say?  Eddie is great.  He's sweet and sympathetic as the gentle, caring  Professor Klump, outrageous as the swaggering, testosterone overloaded  Buddy Love, and uproarious as every member of the Klump family!  And by the  way, I'm a fat person, I've got a pretty thick skin, and I didn't find the  fat jokes that offensive.  Sure they were a little crude and hurtful, but  it's nothing I haven't had said to me over the years.  In the end, Sherman  realised that if you're not happy with what's on the inside, then you'll  NEVER be satisfied with what's on the outside.

I've accepted that and gone on with my life, but this has taken many years of trying to  be someone I will never be and finally understanding that it is the person  inside that counts.  Those who can't see that, well they aren't worth my  time.  The first time I saw this movie and before we got to the end, I was  a bit offended by the fat jokes, but more than being offended, I was there  with Sherman. I have been the butt of many fat jokes over the years so I  felt his pain.  I felt the pain of Carla Purty as she sat helplessly with  Sherman in that nightclub.  That my friends is a sign of a well-acted,  well-written movie.  Yeah, sometimes we hurt!  If you don't listen to all  but the last few minutes of this comedy, the message at the end is  important.  Accept yourself, then others can accept you. Other than that, I  found this movie totally delightful, funny and in true Eddie Murphy form.  I am simply amazed at how versatile this actor is and he he portray so many  different characters yet you find yourself absorbed in them and you start  to think that they are real actors (someone other than Murphy).  As far as  one reviewer's comments regarding the portrayal of black people with no  table manners.  I'll just say I'm Caucasian and I have family members who  act as bad as the Klumps did at dinner.  Actually, to me, the first time I  saw the movie, the dinner scenes were more offensive to me than the  nightclub scene, but the second time around, I went with the flow and  laughed so hard at mama, Cletus and grandma (all portrayed by Murphy).  I  think you need to watch this movie with an open mind.  I think it just  might have opened some ""skinny"" eyes to the pain that some of us  fat folks go through and makes some of us realize we really have to only to  make our own self's happy.

Yet the last  acceptable prejudice, ""fatism"" seems a fair target for a man who  should know better. Obesity is a disease.  A disease with no cure and no  successful treatment.  When the word diet pops in your mind, remember that  only 5% of people that go on diets are able to keep the weight off.  This  number includes the ""normal"" people who need to lose only a few  pounds.  Most people gain back more weight than they have lost.  Americans,  the most diet conscious people on earth, have more fat people than  ""normal"" people.  Fat is the norm, yet it is fine to portray fat  people as ugly, socially inept, clumsy objects of ridicule.

To turn a real problem into some little farce  for your ammusement is horrible!  Being fat is the last accepted prejudice  in america.  I read an analogy which likened it to a movie starring John  Goodman, in which he first appears in blackface and is miserable, but then  when he washes it off, and becomes white again, his life is perfect!  Now,  if a movie was created with that premise, rights organizations would be all  over it!  Certain groups would stage rallies outside of theatres and it  would be banned in most places.  Why, then, is it alright to do this same  exact thing to fat people?  And you find that all over society.  This movie  just brings it into the open.  It also allows another generation of kids to  get the message that fat is funny.  Fat is bad.  Fat is ugly.  Fat is  something to be mocked.  If you're fat, you can't be smart.  Come on, guys.
