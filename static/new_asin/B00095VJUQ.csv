2267597,3,B00095VJUQ,This was kind of hard to catch on. The instructor was a little fast for a beginner. Overall not a bad video.,1289779200,6,108,3.9545454545454546
2267598,4,B00095VJUQ,"DVD is pretty good.  Easy instruction for a beginner (even my 7 year old daughter likes to follow along) like me but not my favorite.  There is no warm up to it even though it starts slow, but the yoga warm up in the other DVD that I had bought is very helpful.",1285718400,7,261,3.9056603773584904
2267599,5,B00095VJUQ,"Others have given such detailed reviews that all I can say that this is best way, other than a live class to learn belly dance moves.  You will be dancing in no time. The music is great.  The visuals are innovative and as usual Neon is amazing.  Enough platitudes for you?  Get this dvd.  You will not be disappointed.

2267600,5,B00095VJUQ,"I love this DVD.  She starts slow with easy movements and speeds up as the DVD goes on, the movements getting more advanced.  There is a dance section with clear instructions.  The only thing I don't like about this DVD is there is no warm-up.  There are plenty of drills throughout the program, which most other DVDs have not included, which has bothered me with other instructionals.",1284249600,8,385,4.701492537313433
2267601,5,B00095VJUQ,"I was looking for a belly dance instructional DVD that had easy combinations that could be learned. Neon braks the steps down to their basic form, without arm movements and makes them very easy to learn. I have her ""Instant Bellydancer"" DVD but it was too complicated and the steps were too difficult to pick up. Also in ""Instant Bellydancer"", the steps are isolated which makes the moves disjointed and you can't see how they work together. This one is much simpler to follow since steps are put together in simple combinations without complicated arm movements. The belly dance music also makes this one much more enjoyable!",1282262400,59,626,4.859813084112149
2267602,5,B00095VJUQ,"Wow! An instructional dvd that is so enjoyable simply because it is easy and it will have you dancing right away!  Since most beginners are eager to start dancing, this is a fun way to enter into the world of belly dance. The menu options allow music only, or dance party combinations for 25 minutes of continuous dance fun!
Upon entering the program the outline defines the lesson plan in 12 perfectly organized sequences.  Belly dance involves much hip work, and the progression begins from simple rhythmic belly dance hip work and steps that soon evolve into percussive movement, progress into fluid moves to form the dance party combinations which review all the basic steps .

The outline of the program  includes: Lower body basics-Sections 1-6 break down the mechanics on hip work such as: rhythmic hips and footwork, percussive hip work or accents, and combining the contrast of fluidity with staccato or percussive movement of the hips.

Upper Body movement and accents- Sections 7-11; technique for upper body such as: chest work, shoulder work.  Layering the upper body on grapevines, step touch patterns quickly add challenge.  Again, before you realize, find yourself already combining upper body movement with fluid hip work such as infinity loops.  Three more sections follow which take the easy percussive hip work to challenging fluid hip movement. Chapter 12 is all about the fun and invigorating  shimmies, such as chest and hip shimmies.

The dance party combinations are super fun. Here you, review each section to create an elegant yet fun dance party that also  gives the muscles of the glutes, abs, and thighs a good toning . Neon narrates the trajectories for upper and lower body movement which are  displayed on screen as she executes the movement such as: circles, semi-circles, infinity loops or figure of 8's, body waves, or arm undulations. Neon layers traveling steps to bring variation to the dance, along with level changes, circle steps, and 3 step turns. These simple, yet elegant combinations will make anyone look like a polished dancer.

If this is your first instructional dvd from WDNY, you will quickly become hooked to Neon's polished, and precise instruction. "" First Steps"" for total beginners  will surely transform the ""wobbly""  to  ""surefooted.""  Watch yourself evolve into a dancer by turning simple body movement into an exceptional style with concrete foundation in basics and technique that Neon builds for you.",1281830400,51,2463,5.102244389027431
2267603,5,B00095VJUQ,"I like the way Neon teaches with shapes.  It is very similar to the way that I teach, so I always recommend her videos to my students.  This one is no exception!  This is a fun video that has the steps broken down to where they are very understandable, and you will be dancing right from the start!  I love the music in this dvd, too!  This is GREAT for beginners and a good review or ""drill"" dvd for intermediates.  You will have a great time with this one, ladies!",1281398400,36,466,4.122222222222222

2267605,5,B00095VJUQ,"I love this video! What a fun way to get exercise! It teaches basic moves, takes some practice to master them, but it makes it so fun to do so! The benefits are numerous! Coordination, self confidence, and physical fitness, are just a few of the things that are improved from this video!  It takes basic steps and teaches them first then adds simple combinations!  You can work at your own pace and repeat until you have it down, then move on!",1475193600,,443,4.390243902439025

2267608,5,B00095VJUQ,"Neon is one of the best teachers for beginners.  She explains each and every move clearly.  The graphics on the screen help you see the trajectory of each and every move, so they are easy to imitate and learn.  Everything is broken down step by step, and you can learn at your own pace.  Neon is also very encouraging and fun, so I love learning from her.  I have so many of her DVD's!

2267615,5,B00095VJUQ,"I just go the idea to try belly dancing. Now, I suck at dancing. However, belly dancing seemed easier for me than other kinds of dancing. I just found isolating my stomach and hips to not be that hard like some other dance moves. So I got this. She is a great instructor! I did not do too bad for my first time! I will continue to learn and improve so that one day I can be good at it. I like her instruction. She goes at a slow pace at first, then starts to move with fluid motion. She combines the moves for a combination. I did stumble, but practice makes perfect!

EDIT: I have been doing this for about two weeks now...and I have to say, I have really caught on! Neon is wonderful! I never thought I could do something like this, little ol' clumsy me, but she is teaching me how to be graceful, and it's working! I'm so happy I got this. I look forward to buying more of her DVD's!",1440028800,3,886,4.034090909090909

2267618,4,B00095VJUQ,Fun but kind of hard to follow. I liked Sadie's Complete Bellydance Guide better. Much easier for a beginner.,1430179200,,109,4.7894736842105265
2267619,4,B00095VJUQ,"She moves quickly, so if you want to learn the moves well, you will have to pause the disc and practice on your own time. That and she doesn't explain in as much detail as I would like. The first move she goes over is vertical slides, but with the pants she's wearing, it's a bit difficult to see what she does with her knees. She tells you they should both be bent, but its hard to see how its done on this video. I ended up looking it up on Youtube.
Overall though, I really enjoy this dvd. I think she's a good teacher, not the best, but good.",1429660800,,546,3.9727272727272727

2267623,3,B00095VJUQ,"Not for beginners at all. I bought this DVD because I bought another, more advanced DVD from Neon that was way too hard, I thought this DVD would break down the moves in the harder video. My biggest complaint is that she never says which leg to step out with she just says ""step out."" So while I step out with my right and she steps out with her left, I have to fumble around to get on the correct side and by that point I've missed 3 or 4 moves.

I like that this DVD has constant movement. It means it will still be useful after mastery. It also has an option to mute the music and the talking if you wanted. I like the combinations. I just get to frustrated at the lack of directions during dancing that I never make more than 10 or so minutes through the video.",1422403200,,765,4.032894736842105

2267627,5,B00095VJUQ,"This is a good video, and easier to follow than some of her other DVDs. You DO need to have some rudimentary understanding of bellydance though. Understanding posture and already having the habit of bent knees will help a lot. It is a pretty long DVD with a lot of small 5 minute sections of steps and combinations. Some people say it moves too fast, but the run time is already 105 minutes, so she couldn't go much slower. I could see how it would be too fast for beginners to follow all the way through, BUT the segments are divided up on the DVD menu, so you can watch a certain one (they are maybe 5 minutes long) as many times as you need to till you get it before moving on. I think she explains the movements well, and makes it easy to understand the principles.",1417651200,,769,4.202702702702703

2267630,2,B00095VJUQ,Does not talk about posture and stance. Legs are covered so you can't actually see what she is doing. It is pretty fasted paced so you actually feel like your dancing from the very beginning! Should probably know some basics of belly dancing if you plan on buying this.,1413244800,,269,4.510204081632653
2267631,5,B00095VJUQ,"I found this video to be just what I wished for as a relative newcomer to belly dance. I cannot say enough good things about this video.  One of the selling points was the ""meticulous chaptering"".  Almost every move and combination has its own chapter so you can easily repeat or skip them as desired.  Another selling point was the ""on-screen graphics"": the digital arrows and figures superimposed over Neon's body to clarify the shapes that your body should be ""drawing"".  I love both of these features, and was also extremely pleased by the the progression of the movements -- the system of learning a step or move and then immediately incorporating it into a combination is like a physical Pimsleur method, and I think it's been very effective for me.  I feel continuously challenged, but never overwhelmed. To top it all off, Neon is like that relentlessly optimistic friend you know will always cheer you up.  She's bright and supportive without ever being smothering.  No emotionless reminders to ""smile"".  Neon reassures you that you have endless energy and grace and that with time you will release it.",1411603200,6,1111,4.872340425531915

2267636,5,B00095VJUQ,"Great for all beginners.  I'm 66 year old and I use this DVD for strengthen and reasonable body movement, while having fun. It's helpful to me because I am not putting a lot of pressure on my joints.  The instruction are very clear, and the music makes you want to move.",1407024000,,270,4.2745098039215685
2267637,3,B00095VJUQ,"Good for beginners, but not for first timers. I'm not a dancer at all and I was looking for the absolute basics to belly dancing DVD. I thought this one titled first steps would be it, but it's not. She moves on really fast without much practice before adding another move or going to the next section. By the time I practice and master each section, I won't be finished with the DVD until a year from now. Her accent isn't heavy, but when your learning this for the first time it is distracting. However if you've done this before or have dancing experience, or are using this while also taking a class, this DVD would be good for you",1404345600,3,635,4.3
2267638,4,B00095VJUQ,I have been interested in learning belly dance for ages. I chose this as my first instructional video based on prior reviews. I have only tried a few times but i find Neon easy to follow. I have taken dance classes in the past and it does throw me off a bit since she's facing me instead of a mirror. still well worth what i paid for it.,1403568000,,337,3.9705882352941178
2267639,5,B00095VJUQ,"Recently took up belly dancing and wanted to practice steps at home.
I wasn't sure if I'd like it but found it to be really well organized, each segment of the dance were shown smaller stages and then grouped together as a complete choreographed dance. There's no talking involved, and arrows and a brief written explanation is shown.
I would recommend it to anyone who is interested.",1395619200,,384,4.746268656716418
2267640,1,B00095VJUQ,"I bought this DVD as a beginner and was highly disappointed. Veena and Neena's DVD's are significantly better- particularly if you take the time to watch yourself as you do them and see for yourself what you're doing wrong.

Nothing compares to actually taking lessons, though!",1393200000,2,277,5.021739130434782
2267641,5,B00095VJUQ,"In this DVD, Neon's pace and teaching skills are excellent.

The DVD is very well presented with each chapter featuring basic moves, several of which are subsequently combined to form a mini choreography. The use of visual aids such as arrows pointing in the direction the move is being executed is also very helpful to beginners or if you're learning on your own.

Chapter 1 : ""vertical hip slides"" & ""horizontal hip pushes""
Chaptre 2 : ""step touch""
Chaptre 3 : ""triplet hip push or hip accent steps""
Chapitre 4 : 1st ""Dance party combination"" - mini choreography using all the moves taught thus far.

There are 48 chapters, out of which 12  are ""Dance party combinations"".

What I particularly like about this DVD is that one can easily reproduce these moves and steps straight away on any other music.",1392681600,3,804,4.714285714285714
2267642,2,B00095VJUQ,I got this hoping to learn how to actually belly dance.  This video is basically some lady belly dancing. It doesn't actually teach you the proper way to dance.  I could learn more from watching youtube videos.  Don't waste your money on this video!,1391731200,,249,4.613636363636363
2267643,3,B00095VJUQ,"An interesting DVD but it is fast paced. I wish they would slow it down just a bit because essentially in a few seconds it shows you 4 moves then then says ""ok now you do it!"" and if you truly are a beginner it is a bit too fast.",1391385600,,229,3.6
2267644,5,B00095VJUQ,"I bought this for my daughter and she adores it.  She's also lost some weight on it and has increased in confidence.  I've noticed a positive change in her personality.  I plan to buy her more, and I plan to start doing these with her.",1390694400,3,235,4.177777777777778
2267645,3,B00095VJUQ,"The first 30 minutes of the video is ok, she doesn't really give details on what your legs or torso should be doing much. Also, when she starts on combos they're just randomly thrown in. She also only shows you the combo moves together once before she speeds it up to the point that you can't easily keep up. She tells you what the moves are, but by the time you understand what she's saying she's already done the move and moved on. On figure 8's she talks about your chest moving as little as possible, and yet she winds up being all over the place. I'm not very good at them and my chest moves a lot less than hers does. When she does hip circles, she actually bends forward and backwards to emphasize it. Which is not how it's done. You are supposed to work those back muscles when you start the back part of the circle. Your whole upper body is supposed to be still doing them. Think of it as your body being earth and your hips are the moon orbiting your body. I also seem to remember she showed how to do vertical 8's, but when she showed horizontal 8's she did the exact same thing. And it's not even close. The menu page doesn't tell you a thing about where to find a particular move. It's all called hipwork and percussive work. That doesn't tell you how to find a move you need to work on you just have to remember where that move is. On chest lifts she contracts her back to do them, which is not right either. You are supposed to only use your chest to pop out and then your upper abs to pop back in. If your upper back is moving it's being done wrong. And I'm getting these statements from dancers like Rachel Brice who is very detailed in explaining how its done. On chest slides, instead of actually going side to side she makes a half circle, the outer curve of which is near her chin. Slides are supposed to be straight lines, not curved. I did an hour of this video and the mistakes made are beginner mistakes and I'd only recommend this video if you knew how to catch those. Otherwise, you're going to learn the exact wrong way to do some things. The only thing I do like about this is it's decent for getting your blood going and I think it will help in me learning to do combos and moving around while dancing. Overall, I've seen much better learning videos on Youtube. Try [...] If that link doesn't work just type free bellydance classes. It's the name of the woman doing them. She covers a lot of things.",1378252800,,2429,4.214592274678112

The kids all put on the finger cymbals and move around. We have a great time and I am getting back into some of my old moves.  It is easy to follow and has upbeat music.

2267663,2,B00095VJUQ,I bought this DVD after reading other reviews and it seemed like a good choice for a beginning belly dancer however I wasn't very happy with the DVD plan. There was no warm up at all before the dance workout starts. It just launches straight into a move and even though there's arrows to help guide you but it would've been better if there was some build up to the dance moves.,1359331200,,377,4.25
2267664,5,B00095VJUQ,This is a wonderful way to not only learn belly dancing moves but you learn a whole dance as you are learning. Each move flows into the next in a way that you can learn one part of the dance then the next part and so on in a way that is easy to learn. Its easy to follow along with the dancer. You can focus on each thing separately and get a great work out at the same time you are learning to dance. Really wonderful concept.,1359244800,,427,3.8636363636363638

However, I do love the breakdown of each move (including the use of graphics to guide your movement) and the combos for practice. I use it for drills, and it's nice having the option to just practice to the music without the vocal instruction.  Plus, Neon is a beautiful dancer! :)",1358899200,3,440,4.365853658536586

2267677,4,B00095VJUQ,"I am a fan of the way World Dance New York and Neon in particular structure their videos, and this one is no exception. ""SEIR'S"" review breaks down the components, so I won't repeat.

The video progresses nicely with hand and footwork combinations and Neon definitely covers the basics of hip drops, snake arms, shimmies, hip circles, hip lifts, figure 8's,etc.

The tutorial graphics that accompany Neon's demonstrations are wonderful to help you understand where the movement is coming from and how to incorporate them mentally. This is particularly great for the individual hip circle. Neon thoroughly explains each section at a great pace so no need to keep the remote in hand.

Bellydance Basics and Beyond with Jenna, and Autumn Ward's the Beginners Path to Flawless Artistry -(Bellydance Beautiful Technique from Step One) contain warm ups and cover posture which is essential for the complete beginner and hence my 4 star rating instead of 5.

By the way, do not expect to see Blanca or Sara as the promo for ""Bellydance First Steps"" features performance elements that aren't on the dvd. Happy Dancing everyone!",1347062400,,1119,5.032432432432432
2267678,3,B00095VJUQ,"I have been belly dancing for about two months and would classify myself as a beginner and I am still confused by some of the moves. While the first section is in idea simple enough, she breaks nothing down because yes for ""vertical hip slides"" essentially all you have to do is alternately bend and straighten your knees, but what about posture. I feel if this DVD was in fact for total beginners, there would be an opening section on posture. So I think if I just showed this to my friend and told them to try it out while observing from the side, they would probably be developing some bad posture habits.

 On the other hand if you are a beginner with an actual in person teacher, this could be a great supplement for drilling things and getting another perspective on how things are done. From what I've read about Neon she is a great dance, but sometimes she is hard to understand( or in some cases listen to) due to her accent and her music can be on the awful side. I found her accent easy to understand and listen to (I'm an ESL teacher so it would be awkward if I didn't like foreign accents or couldn't understand them) and this DVD in particular the music isn't so bad.
 So in summary the DVD is great, it would be better if she broke down the first segment more and had a posture part, but for not total beginners. If you already have a foundation to build on and a teacher to see face-to-face to correct any mistakes your making this is a great DVD for drilling and practice.",1347062400,8,1489,4.291814946619217
2267679,5,B00095VJUQ,This dvd is everything thing I wanted to learn the art of bellydance.  It goes in sections and one can stay at the easy level and feel great or go on to more advanced levels.  Great core exercise.,1344816000,,196,4.131578947368421
2267680,5,B00095VJUQ,"First Steps is Fantastic!  I tried several other bellydance dvd's before discovering Neon's.  In my opinion, this is by far the best.  I love the fact that both beginner and some more advanced movements are covered in it.  This dvd has been challenging enough to hold my interest every day for quite awhile.  I am determined to master these moves!  Neon's wonderful style of teaching has really motivated me to stick with this dvd.  I do love her expressions while demonstrating and explaining the techniques.  Just about the time I feel like a totally uncoordinated newborn calf, I look up at the screen to see Neon smiling her encouraging smile - just like a kind sister or friend urging you on to keep trying.  I also really love the fact that at the ends of the dance routine sections, Neon demonstrates the sequence in ""real"" bellydance time.  I can't yet keep up with all of the dance routines at the ends of the technique sections, but knowing what the moves should look like really pushes me to keep trying.  I am overjoyed to see my slow improvement each time that I try to keep up!  The dvd is wonderfully organized, both by level of difficulty and the progressions make perfect sense.  How lucky we are that one of the best dancers in the world was kind enough to share her techniques with the uninitiated!  I highly recommend this dvd!  What a treat!!",1343952000,3,1363,4.574380165289257
2267681,4,B00095VJUQ,"This is an absolutely fabulous DVD, I love it! From the very beginning, it's non-stop dancing, with a voice-over to explain the moves. I'm not quite a beginner, so I use it more for drills and to warm up. However, with that in mind, I don't think this would be the best DVD for complete beginners. The moves are very fast paced, with not too much explanation. There is never any down time, and I think it'd be hard for true beginners to keep pace with Neon. This is good for someone who already knows the very basics, but for someone who want so learn, I wouldn't really recommend this. The biggest thing in belly dance is to know exactly which muscles you're using and to learn how to isolate them. This goes to quickly that someone who doesn't quite know what they're doing will lose that information, which is so vital to belly dancing.

Neon is a great dancer, and I love her direction. I recommend this for those who have already have a decent foundation, as opposed to a total beginner.",1342051200,5,992,4.420765027322404
2267682,3,B00095VJUQ,"Personally I think the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Potion-The-Bellydance-Workout/dp/B001TZ70DU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Potion - The Bellydance Workout</a>&nbsp;also by Neon or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bellydance-Basics-and-Beyond-Technique-for-a-Solid-Foundation/dp/B000FSL8WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bellydance Basics and Beyond: Technique for a Solid Foundation</a>&nbsp;by Jenna are better for total beginners. I bought Jenna's DVD and this one simultaneously as my very first introduction to bellydance (cero dance classes of any genre before, although I have some ""Dance off the Inches"", ""Crunch"" and ""10 Minute Solutions"" dance DVD's). First I tried this one, I turned it off without passing chapter 1 (maybe I should have repeated it, I do not know). Then I turned to Jenna: First, posture and arm positions, then safety instructions, then a nice warm-up and then a very very lengthy tutorial to conclude with 25 minutes of practise with music and a ""dance by Jenna's students"". After 1 week I returned to ""First Steps..."" with more success (using Jenna's warm-up first). I made it until chapter 6, then from chapters 3-8 on the next day, etc., not without having my hips hurting I would say badly days after I did this DVD, specially if I did the first 4 chapters completely. I was doing something wrong, but I do not know what, probably pushing my hips out instead of bending my knees? This did not happen as I did Jenna's DVD, I alternated both DVD's and was very happy with this solution for my starting phase.

(Nov, 2013) - After more than a year I returned to this DVD to find out the following: It is good for a lengthy drilling once you know the basic bellydance moves. Definitely not for total beginners. I had never done it in full, I mean, I had done every section, but never on the same day (I used to do 3-5 segments each time I used the DVD and sometimes I only did the ""dance party's""). Today I drilled the whole thing (a little more than 1 1/2 hours long) and found it good for drilling hip isolations in a fun way. You also get nice arm frames and footwork together with your drilling. And returning to my point above where I mentioned that I hurt my hips. This DVD starts right away with a chapter called ""rhythmic hips"", which in fact are basic since it's only vertical hips (up/down) and hip pushes (sideways), but and here's the but: They are SHARP accented hips. Jenna starts with hip slides and sways, as well as up/down but not sharp. I did not notice this difference back then, but for sharp movement in your hips, you need to use your glute and leg muscles to drive and contain the hip pushes. I learnt this after watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Baladi-Bellydance-Egyptian-Style-with-Ranya-Rene-TWO-DVD-SET-Open-level-traditional-Egyptian-style-belly-dance-classes-Arabic-style-belly-dance-instruction-Egyptian-bellydancing-how-to/dp/B001JGK4BO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Baladi: Bellydance Egyptian Style, with Ranya Rene (TWO-DVD SET): Open level traditional Egyptian style belly dance classes, Arabic-style belly dance instruction, Egyptian bellydancing how-to</a>, which is packed with security tips. On top of this, Neon includes NO warm-up and gives no safety tips. After the rhythmic hips chapter, you have ""Percussive hips 1 and 2"" and then footwork with hips. Only after these you get the smooth hips...This is why it hurt more with the first 4 chapters, while the rest of the DVD was more doable for me. So really it's not for a total beginner that hasn't learnt to use its glutes!

EXCELLENT BD DVD'S FOR TOTAL BEGINNERS. I may have other beginner DVD's, but the following are my top pics because all include a detailed tutorial section that break down the moves slowly and without music. Of course tutorials are boring, specially if you are not totally new to BD or if you prefer to learn by dancing from the very first step. However, if you are an absolute beginner in BD, you probably need this instruction, since you need to isolate a lot of muscles you did not even know you could voluntarily move.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belly-Dance-Basics-Beyond-with-Jenna-Belly-Dancing-Classes-for-a-Solid-Foundation-Bellydance-how-to-belly-dance-technique/dp/B000FSL8WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belly Dance Basics & Beyond, with Jenna: Belly Dancing Classes for a Solid Foundation - Bellydance how-to, belly dance technique</a>&nbsp;will provide you one of the most detailed technique sections you will find and probably the most complete one in terms of variety of moves.

However, I am not sure if it's for total beginners, since Autumn does not include individual practice time for each independent move, the only practice time you get is different moves strung together in a flow.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belly-By-Sandra-Vol-1-Isolations-Bellydance-Instructional/dp/B001SFT764/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belly By Sandra Vol 1: Isolations (Bellydance Instructional)</a>&nbsp;is also excellent for beginners. Sandra first explains each move, including muscular engagement, posture, etc. without music and also giving you truly interesting background information as to how the move is executed in ""Middle Eastern Dance"" vs other dance forms like ""African"", ""Jazz"", etc. Then she drills each move with excellent drum music, making your drilling much more fun so you do not get bored so easily. However, you would need to buy Vol 1 and 2 and still don't get as many moves as with Jenna.

CARDIO CHALLENGE: Low TONING: Low CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Beginner to Intermediate INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Good MUSIC: Good FUN FACTOR: Good

CONTENTS:
The DVD's content is very plain: 12 chapters each covering a theme like for example percussive hips. Each chapter is divided in four 3-5 Min. sub-chapters, each of the first 3 as practise sub-chapters and the 4th sub-chapter combining steps from all 3 previous ones into a ""dance party"". You can select chapter by chapter or play the 12 ""dance parties"" in a row. This format is very helpful to make your own choices of learning/dancing. But this is all you get: no tutorial, no safety instructions, no warm-up, no cool down, no extras. You just start right away and end right away.  The practise sub-chapters include very helpful graphics that show the trajectories that you should follow while performing each of the isolations, so this is kind of a tutorial but it is not as slow and broken down, you are ""dancing"" right off to some rather insufficient explanations for a real beginner.

MUSIC:
Some of the music in this DVD is with lyrics (contemporary compositions), which I find somewhat distracting when you need to concentrate on learning difficult isolations, both other DVD's I mentioned at the beginning as well as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serpentine-Belly-Dance-with-Rachel-Brice-Bellydance-Technique-Yoga-for-Strong-Relaxed-Sinuous-Movement/dp/B00095NX9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serpentine - Belly Dance with Rachel Brice :: Bellydance Technique & Yoga for Strong, Relaxed & Sinuous Movement</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bellydance-Tribal-Fusion-Workout/dp/B00095MBQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bellydance Tribal Fusion Workout</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Foundations-of-Bellydance-East-Coast-Tribal-Beginner-Tribal-Fusion-Bellydance/dp/B00095VJTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Foundations of Bellydance: East Coast Tribal - Beginner Tribal Fusion Bellydance</a>&nbsp;have basically no lyrics or very few songs with lyrics.

EMPHASIS:
Mainly hips, only one chapter is for chest, one for snake arms and one for undulations. Extremely basic arm embellishments and very little footwork.

BETTER THAN OTHER DVD'S:
- The figures on the screen showing the trajectories are really good but her tutorial in ""Love Potion"" is almost better even without the graphics.
- One of the best undulation sections I have seen so far, specially for beginners. I still do this chapter sometimes, it's one of the best exercises my abs have gotten (I do not specially like working out gym-style, so my abs were grateful for this standing exercise and I can already see it). This sections is rivalled only by Neon's ""Love Potion"", which is maybe even better. So conclusion is that Neon's way of teaching and drilling undulations is probably one of the best out there, no matter which DVD of hers you acquire, you will probably get an excellent undulation section. If you want to exercise your abs, Irina's workout is also excellent, but she uses more abs ""tuck-release/tuck-release"" exercises.
- Nice chapter on vertical hip figure 8's
- Percussive hips are drilled extensively, probably more than in other DVD's.",1340841600,2,10265,6.229034531360113
2267683,2,B00095VJUQ,I am not new to dancing but I am a total newb to belly dancing. There is no warm up at all. She just jumps right on in to the drills without any indication of what she is doing and doesn't even tell you ahead of time that she is about to introduce a new step. This would be good for someone who isn't new but just needs a refreshment.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to learn belly dancing.  This instructions are easy and clear.  The movements begin slowly and the tempo increases as you practice each move.  A must have DVD! :0),1338163200,4,350,4.507936507936508
2267685,5,B00095VJUQ,"This video is like a crash course in belly dance. If you really are a total beginner, be prepared because Neon jumps right in and immediately starts teaching the forms without any real introduction. You will learn everything from hip drops to figure eights. Neon is a good instructor who puts together bellydance moves that are fun. The DVD will quickly teach someone the basics of belly dance. Neon doesn't waste any time on endless explanations that are of no value. She goes right into the moves and even shows how to use them in combinations so you are dancing right away.

If, however, you are a complete novice to belly dance, you should be aware that you should never strain yourself while belly dancing. If a move is uncomfortable to you, start slowly and work up to it. You should always stop doing a move if it is uncomfortable and see if you can do it at a lower intensity. Never make yourself continue doing something that's uncomfortable for you or you could hurt yourself.

None of these points were brought up in the DVD at the beginning. Neon really should have had a brief one- or two-minute introduction in which she explained that it's a good idea to keep your knees bent and to make certain the movements are comfortable for you. Don't try to make your chest movements as sharp and as big as Neon does them, for example, unless it feels right for you. Always be careful to listen to your body. You don't have to be perfect immediately. It's fine to do the movements with less intensity until you've mastered them.

I can remember when I first started belly dance, none of these points were explained to me so I tried to do too much too soon. Total beginners in belly dance should really be given an introduction to belly dance that talks about safety. It's also a good idea to have a warm-up included, also, especially for beginners who may not know what kind of warm-up is appropriate for belly dance. This DVD was missing a warm-up as well as an introduction that talked about safety. I think those two things would really be helpful for beginners.

P.S. I do wish Neon would include a performance with her DVDs. She is a talented artist and her students would like to see her in action.",1334016000,7,2209,4.515

She gives some essential advice, for example, using your glutes to add more emphasis on hip movements and remembering to flex the knees to keep the upper body from moving too much while doing isolated hip movements. The music is excellent; it doesn't overpower the verbal instructions, but the strong beats drift into your consciousness and you find your movements just naturally fall in time with the music.

I was disappointed that there was not a section for arm movements. Instead it was just kind of incorporated with the other movements.

I loved the drawing of the diagrams for the movements and the extensive information in the DVD.

2267693,5,B00095VJUQ,"If you are a beginner like me, I recommend this DVD. Belly Dance First Steps is completely devoted to learning the basics of bellydance. I like to repeat a new dance move until it becomes easier for me, and this DVDs 48 short segments make it perfect for a beginner who wants to rewind and practice. What I really love is that each segment is taught to music which gives me the motivation to get up and dance. I got inspired to learn bellydance after seeing Turkish bellydancers on a popular morning talk show and thought it looked like fun. The music and dance combinations in this DVD put some fun into learning.",1295222400,6,614,4.442477876106195

8057404,3,B00095VJUQ,A little tough to follow. My daughter is seven and wanted to belly dance. She has a natural rhythm and loves dance of all forms. But she has struggled a bit with this video. The instructor speaks quickly And doesn't give real clear visuals. Her long pants can make it hard to see the movement.,1493337600,,293,4.345454545454546

8057407,5,B00095VJUQ,I bought Luscious way before I bought this one for the workout program and fell in love with belly dancing. I bought this one to hone moves I learned in Luscious and learn new moves. This DVD is perfect for beginners. The directions on the screen that show where or how the move is supposed to go are awesome. I highly recommend this,1490918400,,333,4.301587301587301
