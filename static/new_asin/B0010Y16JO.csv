8239338,1,B0010Y16JO,"WOW, THIS HAS TO BE THE BIGGEST MIS-REPRESENTATION OF THE CONTENTS OF A DVD THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN.  IT IS ONLY 1 MOVIE, THE SHEIK. WHY SHOW ALL THREE TITLES AND GIVE THREE SYNOPSIS ON THE BACK AND HAVE IT CONTAIN ONLY 1 MOVIE????
I was deeply disappointed and doubt if I will ever purchase ANYTHING released by REEL Enterprises ever again.  Nice going, guys...just another way to fleece the public.
This is a classic movie - a very good one - the one star is NOT for the movie.",1236384000,6,477,4.230769230769231
8239339,5,B0010Y16JO,"What can I say?  I love Rudolph Valentino.  I enjoy watching the Sheik.  I've seen people complain about the over acting but when I took introduction to films in college we studied silent films as part of the course, and I learned that the actors pantomimed to get the ideas across to an audience who could not hear sound.  Todays actors are VERY dependent on being able to speak but silent film stars could not be heard and had to exagerate what they were doing in order to be heard without sound.  I look upon the Sheik as an art form and an interesting part of film history considering the overwhelming reaction of my own sex to the film's star.
  I do not approve of rape but I am also not offended by the film.  To me the film is about Valentino larger than life and over whelming the screen no matter which role or film he happened to be playing in.",1220140800,5,855,4.234567901234568

(If she were live today, she'd be over 100 yers old and she saw the movie at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood, CA)",1209254400,3,199,4.2631578947368425
