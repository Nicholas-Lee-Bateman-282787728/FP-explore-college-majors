2653342,5,B000I6AMW2,"This DVD is INSANELY good! - If you are a fan of ""Jeff Wayne's Musical Version Of The War Of The Worlds"" this is a true must-have. This DVD is THE reason to go out and buy an all-Region DVD player. Why?: the performance and sound quality (you already know the music is great). The reproduction of the original version is extreamly faithful and, 90% of the time BETTER (yes better) than the original. Not to mention the stunning Dolby Digital (DTS option as well) audio is PERFECTLY recorded and mastered (occasionally Richard Burton's voice is too a little low but fans know the naration by heart anyway). It's just spectacular. Very well presented visually as well (very good video direction). The only thing missing really is Phil Lynott as the Parson (he died in 1986), I really miss his blood curdling scream just before he is ""given a sign"". The role of The Artilleryman is brilliantly played by Alexis James as is Beth played by Tara Blaise. Of course, Justin Hayward and Chris Thompson are outstanding reprising their original roles.

This DVD is MUCH better than I expected. Again if you know this music like the back of your hand like I do and as so many of the millions of other people who have purchased the original over the past 30 years, you will revel in the audio (and visual) spectacular that is this re-recording.

The easiest 5 star review I've ever given.",1258070400,6,1375,4.608163265306122
2653343,3,B000I6AMW2,"I'll admit that I always have enjoyed this musical version of War of the Worlds, ever since it came out in LPs so many years ago. Great music, great narration. When I heard that it had been produced as a live stage so (rumors had abounded about this for years) I had to see it.

When I saw it was available for purchase from Amazon, I carefully made sure that I was not ordering a European-formatted disk. No, there was no indication of this at all. But when I received my shipment, I found that it would not play in my DVD player. Evidently, while it is not in the incorrect format, it is in a security region code not that of the US. My DVD couldn't play it. I tried my laptop and it readily accepted it, but now I know that I can only switch back and fourth a total of five times before it locks my computer down for good.

I contacted both Amazon and their distributer on this and never received any email back on this, a total stonewall. The problem is that I really love this show, and so one of my laptops is perminantly allocated over to this one lousy security format.

So, the rock opera, I'd give five stars. The security format issue (and the lack of any response from either company) rates zero stars. We'll average this experiance at ""three"".",1246665600,40,1256,4.26890756302521
2653344,5,B000I6AMW2,The opening words of Richard Burtons narrative still makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up and the opening chords of Jeff Waynes music stops me im my tracks and anyone else in the room!,1241222400,4,195,4.157894736842105
2653345,5,B000I6AMW2,"I first heard this music in the early 70's and loved it. It was not until 1980 that I got the vinyl album. Later I got the CD. Now I have the Live On Stage DVD. Let me tell you this. Listen to the album, either on vinyl or CD. Follow the story using the enclosed booklet with the lyrics and the artwork. Try to picture in your mind what is going on as you listen. Then, when you are ready, watch the DVD. You will be blown away!! The DVD is of the stage version of Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of the War of the World's. An idea first written by H. G. Wells. The special FX are incredible. The music explosive. The cast fantastic. It has literally brought to life the music that captured the world all those years ago. The stage show was only shown in the UK to sold out theatre's which is why the DVD is Region 2 and 4 only. It is not region 1. I have purchased a region free DVD player. You can also play it on your computer by changing the region in your pc settings. Be warned though, you can only change your region a few times, so it might be wise to get a code free player, especially if you are into non US DVD's, get a second pc for non US DVD's or don't buy the DVD, not recommended!! I cannot recommend this DVD enough, the best musical show I have seen since I saw Cats live in London.",1223251200,12,1297,3.9731800766283527
2653346,5,B000I6AMW2,It's a great dvd...the only problem is...the biggest one. IT ONLY PLAYS ON REGION 2..WHY WOULD THESE PEOPLE ALIENATE THEIR FANS??? NOT COOL!,1223251200,2,140,5.130434782608695
2653347,5,B000I6AMW2,"This DVD, which is only available as a Region 2 release -- which means, for people outside of Western Europe and Japan, that you need either an all-region player or a properly set up computer to play it -- is very nicely produced. The film itself, shot in an actual performance, is a good account of the stage version of WAR OF THE WORLDS (which I wish they would bring to the US), complete with participation by Justin Hayward (""Forever Autumn"" etc.). The letterboxed images are sharp and clear, and the sound is full, and the supplements do explain a bit about the history and also the mechanics of the production.",1222387200,3,616,4.558558558558558
2653348,1,B000I6AMW2,I contacted both sellers listed here to make sure that the DVD's they are offering will play in region 1.  Both said that they had no info on the product and I needed to contact Amazon for any more information.  I would hesitate to deal with anyone or any company that does not even know what they have.  It is definately BUYER BEWARE when dealing with these guys.,1215302400,,364,4.323529411764706
2653349,5,B000I6AMW2,"I watched a filmed performance on this show on the Sundance Channel recently so people in the USA and Canada are seeing it...but we can't get it in a format on DVD.

I see there's also a 2-disc special edition DVD version (something I'd really like to get) but, again, it's only available in another region other than North America.

With the exposure of the filmed show playing in the States...when will we be able to get it on DVD?

(I bought the CD to listen to in the meantime.  Interesting concept: using progressive rock to tell a classic story!  Bravo!)",1210032000,18,560,4.5049504950495045
2653350,5,B000I6AMW2,"I first saw this show on my television guide and decided to record it for later viewing.  I thought that a classic science fiction novel as this put to music would be interesting.  After I watched it, I was so blown away by the masterful complexity of this musical and theatrical extravagansa!  A large strings band, a large modern band, interwoven scenes of live performances which worked wonderfully with the large screen images in the background, story narration interludes done by Richard Burton, and the music ... the wonderful music which after first hearing it, I still can't get out of my thoughts!  I find myself continually singing these songs over and over in my head and never tiring of them!
  I have always been a large fan of the music of The Allan Parsons Project.  They too create memorable songs which will stick in your head.  Jeff Wayne has created and conducted a masterpiece of timeless music which is in the same style as Allan Parsons.  If you end up enjoying Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds as much as I did, I encourage you to seek out the music of The Allan Parsons Project.
  Shortly after seeing my recording of Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds, I got on Amazon.com and ordered the DVD.  I eagerly await it's arrival so I can once again (probably for the 10th time) enjoy this musical and thratrical masterpiece!!! My 21 year old daughter has been equally taken by this show!  A good example of how great musical shows as this can span generations! I have a strong feeling that this musical inturpretation will be as much of a timeless classic as H.G. Wells novel of The War of the Worlds!",1208304000,9,1615,4.546712802768166

2653352,4,B000I6AMW2,"I wasn't sure how the original work would hold up after almost 40 years, but I'd always longed to see this on the stage, and this production didn't disappoint.  The first half is outstanding, and the stagecraft and musicianship carry the dramatic momentum through the rambling second half and its sometimes limp lyrics, to where I'd say it's an improvement on the original album.  The floating giant Richard Burton head, straight out of Uncanny Valley, takes some getting used to, and the modern-day epilog is even cornier than I remember, but these are minor downsides.",1420934400,,570,4.989473684210527

2653359,5,B000I6AMW2,"WotW has to me been one of the best musical efforts of all time.  This live performance lives up to that high expectation.

As of when I bought this though, the DVDs were only available with Region 2 distribution control code (Europe/Japan) which meant no play in Region 1 devices (US and Canada).  Arg!

Luckily, there are ways to overcome this issue, just search the web for the various how-to's.  It is sooo worth the effort if you are a fan here in US!",1370390400,,456,4.380952380952381

2653362,5,B000I6AMW2,"This is my first review on amazon. I have bought many things from this company before but I never felt I had to leave a review until now. I first listened to ""War of the Worlds"" on a plane (Eastern Airlines) when I was a kid with my parents on vacation when it first came out. I loved it but never bought the album. When I was older I found the CD at Specs (around 1990) and was instantly reminded of my time on the plane listening to it over and over. I bought it and have loved it ever since. Since then I have bought the remastered version but had put off buying the live concert version for years because it was region 2 and I live in the US. Well I read some of the reviews again and found out about the free download VLC media player and bought the DVD. I may only be able to watch the DVD on my computer but it's totally worth it. I really wish they would release a US version but to miss this awesome show would be a pity. The sound is amazing. The drum sound and strings take this music a new level. I am totally blown away with the production of this show. I thought about taking off 1 star because it is not region 1 but I just couldn't. Google VLC media player and download the free player and buy the DVD. Then put on your headphones and enjoy ""War of the Worlds"" like you never have before. You won't regret it.",1361750400,2,1325,4.003773584905661

DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE IN THE USA.",1354233600,,285,4.0
2653366,5,B000I6AMW2,Brilliant DVD and the music still in my head.  Very well done production.  If you like the music and Richard Burton you will like this.,1352332800,,135,4.36
2653367,1,B000I6AMW2,"This video, ""A Musical Version Of The War Of The Worlds"", with music by Jeff Wayne of the Moody Blues would have been a great video to see. Unfortunately, there are versions of this video out there called ""Region 2"" videos that cannot be played back in any DVD player-at least, not here in Connecticut-possibly not even in the United States. The vender I purchased this from neglected to inform me of this, and there are no words to describe the embarrassment I felt, after inviting my friend over for the evening to watch this DVD, and having a message come up on my DVD player stating, ""This DVD may not be played in your area"". OK- I feel like a real jerk at this point. Has anyone out there ever had this experience? I felt that if I am paying for the bloody thing with real money, there should be no prohibition against me watching it!!! Now, the vender refunded my money after I sent them back the DVD-only, I did not want a refund-I just want a version of this @%&*@# video I can actually watch!!! I am extremely frustrated now, only because I don't know which vender I can trust to send me a ""legitimate"" version of this product!!!  If anyone out there is tempted to buy this product, I only have one word to say to them-beware!!!",1348272000,,1238,4.359307359307359
2653368,5,B000I6AMW2,"Great show.  Music matches the late 1970s double record / current CD set precisely.  Problem is how to convert to Region / 1 PAL.

First, you should be able to read this and play the DVD on any windows 7 computer.  Sorry, I am not reviewing for MAC or Linux.

Second, rip the DVD with appropriate DVD ripper software.  I use Xilisoft DVD Ripper Platimum 4.  Burn to DVD with Win7 DVD maker to change from PAL to NTSC format.

A decent Win7 computer can do this with not a lot of pain or aggravation.  Great performance and well worth the effort to convert.  Enjoy -",1327968000,10,565,4.245283018867925
2653369,2,B000I6AMW2,"I have an all-region DVD player, so, unlike the other bad reviews posted thus far, my low rating is based on content, not playability.  I've always wanted to like Jeff Wayne's late 70's concept album that put music to the H.G. Wells classsic, but it was a bore: not particularly melodic, kind of repititious, and overlong.

Three decades later comes the ""stage version,"" which is not really a stage version at all, but more of a multi media presentation with everything kind of mashed together on the stage: a wide movie screen, a 48-piece orchestra conducted by Wayne himself (looking quite bored), a (literally) talking head that hangs from the rafters that utters the words of H.G. Wells in the voice of Richard Burton, actors who aimlessly trudge around the stage, and an onstage ""Martian killing machine"" that descends from the rafters and thereafter is totally immobile and totally unscary.

I continue to be totally unimpressed with this unnecessary and ineffective re-imagining of the Wells masterpiece.  How it's managed to stay around so long, in one form or another, is beyond me.",1320278400,,1091,4.978021978021978

I read some reviews that say that 'some people' have been able to play this on their US players... but I was NOT one of those people.  I'm hoping to someday be able to watch the one I have, or that they release a US playable version.  btw... I only gave it one start due to the fact that it won't play in the US.

2653372,4,B000I6AMW2,"There are ways to watch this without having a region-free DVD player and a PAL television. VLC media player will circumvent region checking for most DVD drives, and computers are able to read PAL discs without any special software. If VLC doesn't work, there is a utility that will allow unlimited region changes for Lite-On disc drives (if you have one). If you search for a bit both of these programs are readily available.

As far as the actual program goes, it is fantastic. The only reason this is rated four stars is for the fact that it is incorrectly listed as NTSC.",1299024000,,574,4.572815533980583

This is quite clearly spelled out in all of the Amazon information and descriptions.  Zone Free HDMI upconverting DVD players are available for less than $60 on line.  It's well worth it to have one on hand - as it plays absolutely anything on disc.  The show is spell-binding - I have purchased this item on vinyl LP's, CD's, and now DVD.

2653374,5,B000I6AMW2,"Sigh....I'm not going to spend my time reviewing the the DVD.  If you are a WOTW fan, you need to own this DVD.  The performance is all you could have hoped for.  Be sure to get the 2-disc set, too, as it includes lots of interesting featurettes on the second disc.  They are not essential, but they are worth watching.  DO NOT watch this using crummy PC speakers or your TV monitor speakers.  Do it justice and crank it up on a real home audio system.  Also, view it with a HD projector, if you can get one.  The bigger the better.

As far as people griping about it being a Region 2, PAL DVD...I'm not very sympathetic.  First, I won't swear that Amazon has ALWAYS listed it as a region 2 DVD, but it's been listed as Region 2 for as long as I can remember.  Second, even if they didn't list it as a Region 2, other reviewers have specifically stated that it is Region 2 since at least 2008. If you looked at even a few of the reviews, you would have seen this.  Third, common sense tells you that Region 2 DVDs are going to be PAL format.  Finally, it boggles my mind that people would actually state that they don't want the opportunity to buy foreign DVDs on this site.  (Some reviewers have suggested that Amazon shouldn't sell DVDs from other regions to US customers.)  This would be absurd.

Buy this DVD, even if you need to buy a separate all-region player to view it.",1280448000,2,1378,4.242307692307692

When the DVD arrived I had to sign for it because it came from France.  I think that Amazon Marketplace should list the location of the seller.  Why is Amazon.com in the United States listing items that can't be played here.  I agree with John M. Hubbard's comments from 02/03/10.  I see that the listing now has a note that this DVD is Region 2.  That note was not there when I made this purchase.  I strongly suggest that Amazon.com remove Region 2 items from their catalog before other people throw away good money on something that can't be viewed.,1265932800,2,667,4.491666666666666

8144215,5,B000I6AMW2,"Jeff Wayne's DVD musical version of War of the Worlds is a Masterpiece and will probably pass into history along with all the other great composers. I believe the concert was played at the new Wembly Football Stadium in London, England, Regardless of where it was played it is incredible. The story follows H.G. Wells' book almost to the letter. The players, singers, orchestra and the huge band with everything down to a beautiful harp make this one of the most enthralling concert/storytelling experiences I've ever had. I bought the late 70's double album vinyl LP set years before the musical version came out. Richard Burton narrated on both the original record and they also through computer graphics used him again for the musical. ""No One Would Have Believed"" but believe me when you watch and hear this musical YOU WILL BELIEVE? But beware.
The format is in PAL and will only play on European players. The US system is NTSC and will not play the disc in America. What I did was to purchase a reasonably cheap Multi Zone DVD that will play PAL, NTSC and other discs from other zones. If you do this then you can connect direct to your regular TV by either HDMI, Composite or even S-video if there is an S-video output from the machine you buy. Most new machines have optical sound outputs as well which can be connected to a main amplifier. Good luck and enjoy!!",1424217600,4,1370,4.618852459016393
