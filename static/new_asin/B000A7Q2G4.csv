8075989,5,B000A7Q2G4,I love this DVD bc I love more complex step choreography.  Seasun is never too over the top in any of her dvds and I love that about her.,1505865600,,137,3.7241379310344827

8075991,5,B000A7Q2G4,"I've been stepping for 13 years, and I tend to get pretty bored with most step workouts. All of Seasun's workouts are challenging and fun, and they are a really great workout to boot. I always feel like I am burning the maximum number of calories, all while having fun thanks to her imaginative choreography. The Next Step is some of her best choreography yet. I'm addicted and hope she puts out some more DVDs soon.",1254096000,4,416,4.4868421052631575
8075992,1,B000A7Q2G4,"I'm a former step aerobics instructor and I can tell you that this routine was too dancy and too complicated to follow. I couldn't think about getting in a good workout because I was too busy trying to figure out which way my feet were supposed to be going.  The entire thing was far too mentally exhausting for me and I ended up returning the DVD for a refund (which I've never done before).  I don't like to be critical, but I

have to be honest - I did not like this routine at all.",1170115200,5,485,4.08421052631579
8075993,5,B000A7Q2G4,"To be honest, I'd not heard of Seasun before, but was pointed in the direction of this dvd by Amazon and I'm glad I gave it a try.  It really is very good.

It's a great and challenging routine that isn't too dancy, but a lot of athletic moves put into good step combinations.  It's really designed for people who are experienced with step and not newcomers.  There are other exercisers in here that show modifications, but Seasun never does.  She always goes full tilt with a lot of enthusiasm and good, clear cuing.  During the workout, you'll change the position of the step to length ways and the regular sideways (which I find is more interesting and mentally challenging to master moves - it makes it more fun and keeps it fresh).  At the end of the 50 minute step routine, there is some ab work and at the end of that, there is a bonus workout using two steps.  For that, you'd probably need to be an instructor or a gym user where you have access to two steps.  Not many regular home exercisers will have two steps in their possesion so I always skip that section and just enjoy the bulk of this great workout.  Based on this dvd, I'd be quite happy to purchase another workout from her.",1158537600,7,1195,4.342342342342342
