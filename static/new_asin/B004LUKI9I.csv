  Este film es uno de los mas intrigantes y emocionantes trilles que he visto. La calidad de actuacin del actor D.Bogarde,es impecable como siempre,y aunque represente a tres personajes en la Historia, son total y muy
diferentemente definidos,no llegando a confundirlos ni mezclarlos ni por que invocacin alguna ni por instante

4404910,5,B004LUKI9I,"I watched this movie in the movie theater when I was a third year student. The story line was simple, but the acting of the two main characters (Dirk & Olivia) were good. Both showed how much they were frustrated and being tormented on their faces during the court trials. The movie fitted for watchers who liked court trial scenes.",1458691200,,332,4.55
4404911,4,B004LUKI9I,"Great storyline and I always love Dirk Bogarde. Although I like Olivia de Havaland, I didn't like her in this. Felt she was mismatched with Dirk. She seemed more like his mother than his wife and gave a flat performance, but I still liked the movie thanks to Dirk's performance.",1458000000,,278,4.58

4404917,2,B004LUKI9I,"Warning - spoilers ahead -

So close.... so close to being an utter masterpiece but in the end it bowed down to mediocrity and the marketplace. Had he rejected her at the end there would have been incredible pathos and indeed tragedy instead of a simple case of mistaken identity and reconciliation. The film seems to want to go in that direction - the direction of that truely unflinching masterpiece ""In a Lonely Place"" dares to go. This is what gave it so much power. In that film Bogart rejects his lover because she does not believe in him. How can love exist without trust?",1439942400,2,579,4.514285714285714
4404918,4,B004LUKI9I,Huge fan of Dirk Bogarde  Interesting plot with surprise twist at the end. The last moments I did not like but won't give it away and spoil for new viewers. If you love British films (as I do) this is for you.,1439337600,,209,3.9761904761904763
4404919,5,B004LUKI9I,"De Havilland and Borgarde... both give their all to these characters.  As you watch each emotion play across their faces you will find yourself in the grips of this move struggling to remain objective and come to the right conclusion. For De Havilland, a raised eyebrow expressed doubt or concern.  For Borgarde, a knowing smile represented deceptive actions or some psychological relief....  I'm still digesting this movie.",1434240000,3,424,5.298507462686567

4404922,5,B004LUKI9I,"At the start we see what appears to be another typical courtroom drama; however, as events outstrip what could have been a pedestrian thriller, we are completely absorbed in this story of dubious motives and mistaken identity. Dirk Bogarde de Hallivand are excellent together. Some of the courtroom scenes are unbearably suspensful.",1417824000,5,332,5.403846153846154

If, like me you haven't seen this, it is a class drama. In the days before CGI, you needed a script and be able to act....definitely 5 stars",1413849600,,419,4.6

4404925,3,B004LUKI9I,"This is an entertaining film with some enjoyable performances. As English courtroom dramas go, it is not as satisfying as ""Witness for the Prosecution,"" made just a couple of years earlier. I'd characterize Dirk Bogarde's performance as good and in some moments, very good, but not as impressive as his performance in ""Victim"" made a couple of years later. I greatly enjoyed Robert Morley and Wilfrid Hyde-White as the barristers. ""Libel"" is certainly worth watching and I'm a fan of the director, Anthony Asquith, but it's not a great film.",1402531200,2,541,5.022222222222222

4404928,3,B004LUKI9I,"""Libel,"" (1950), is an interesting British film, a mystery/courtroom drama, and a midcareer turning point for its star, Sir Dirk Bogarde, in which he turned away from playing his matinee idol looks to more ambiguous, ambitious, possibly gay-themed fare.  LIBEL was directed by the very well-born Anthony Asquith, (PYGMALIAN, THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ERNEST, THE BROWNING VERSION), written by the equally well-born Anatole de Grunwald (PIMPERNEL SMITH, THE WINSLOW BOY).  And, before the handsome, significantly well-born actor's career was done, he  would make&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Servant/dp/B00005R24B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Servant</a>&nbsp;and ACCIDENT with Joseph Losey;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-in-Venice/dp/B000LJ78VO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death in Venice</a>&nbsp;and THE DAMNED, with Luchino Visconti;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Night-Porter-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/0780022823/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Night Porter (The Criterion Collection)</a>, with Liliana Cavani; and  VICTIM, with Basil Dearden, a picture which dealt with openly gay subject matter when homosexuality was still illegal in Great Britain.

In LIBEL, Bogarde plays Sir Mark Lodden, baronet, a soldier returned from World War II with undiagnosed post-stress disorder, then called simply shell shock. Jeffrey Buckenham (Paul Massie) a Canadian commercial pilot happens to see a telecast in London of a Richard Dimbleby (played by himself) interview with Sir Mark at his stately home. The Canadian is convinced that the baronet is a fraud, that he is actually a look-alike actor named Frank Welney, with whom he and the baronet roomed at a German prisoner of war camp.  The trio had escaped together; but one of them never came back. Was the missing man Sir Mark or Welney? The tabloids do their thing with the Canadian's accusations.  Lady Margaret (Maggie) Loddon, played by the equally well-born Olivia de Havilland, urges her husband to sue for libel and engage the distinguished barrister Sir Wilfred, played by Robert Morley, with Hubert Foxley,  played by Wilfred Hyde-White, as opposing, but collegial counsel.  The film devolves into a courtroom drama, with  Richard Wattis as the judge. The case is long drawn-out, made complex by the fact that Sir Mark himself is not quite sure of his identity: he was injured in the war, stutters on occasion and has difficulty remembering. Testimony and evidence go back and forth; it begins to appear that the current Sir Mark is an impostor and the possible murderer of the missing baronet. Even the lord's wife is convinced of his guilt and turns against him.

De Havilland was rather well-born herself: she was best-known, of course, for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gone-with-the-Wind/dp/B002W7IH0Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gone with the Wind</a>, also her Oscar-winning performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Snake-Pit/dp/B0001US78Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Snake Pit</a>.  Paul Massie, a Canadian, was best known for his performance in the title role of THE TWO FACES OF DR. JEKYLL.  Morley was best known for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-African-Queen/dp/B003F3KKCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The African Queen</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beat-the-Devil/dp/B004WM0YRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beat the Devil</a>, and AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS.

The film is well-acted, but given the greatest energy by the dueling byplay of its comic veterans, Morley, Hyde-White, and Wattis.  It was based on an original 1935 theater production, ""Libel"" that was directed by Otto Preminger years before he made his debut as a Hollywood film director.  The play was based on the actual medieval French story upon which Gerard Depardieu's THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE was based: Jodie Foster's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sommersby/dp/B004HMNQQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sommersby</a>&nbsp;was an American remake.  The picture does leave lingering doubts in the viewer's mind.  Whatever happened to the men's' dog tags--didn't British troops have them in World War II?  There's some odd business about a leather jacket.  And, bottom line, didn't somebody commit grievous bodily harm upon somebody, possibly killing them?  The scriptwriters, the director, and Bogarde have done a good job of maintaining ambiguity, and I for one watched the closing credits not  completely convinced that the man calling himself Sir Mark was actually Sir Mark.",1371254400,5,5198,7.101721439749609

8434865,4,B004LUKI9I,"Terrific quasi-legal thriller with two of the best actors of their generation - Dirk Bogarde and Olivia Da Havilland. Basic plot is, English nobleman and his wife are suddenly emeshed in a Libel suit over accusations that he is not who he says he is. Beyond the marvelous interrogation of identity and the self, this film-based-on-a- play provides a great vehicle for acting and direction. Interesting to note that Da Havilland, when she made this US/UK production was already living in Paris, where she, amazingly, lives to this day. Although the plot veers ever so slightly into melodrama toward the end  (no spoilers) that is more than compensated for by the crisp Anthony Asquith direction, excellent camera work (and score) and the wonderful supporting cast. The latter includes the great Robert Morely and Wilfred Hyde-Whyte as dueling barristers. Great stuff.",1469059200,4,866,5.185714285714286
