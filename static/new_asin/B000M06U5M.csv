2718004,1,B000M06U5M,"I'd like to nominate this as the worst modern ERNANI. Besides the rudimentary conducting (the muffled orchestra sounds as if covered by a blanket), the four principals - wooden actors whose names I don't even care to remember - are wobbly and gasp for breath while phrasing their lines (extremely painful to watch and hear). Though Dynamic is known for its note-complete sets, in the light of such a poor performance, the excision of second verses is more than welcome (there's also a short cut in the finale). The middle-of-the-road staging isn't as disastrous as the overall performance, which does improve a little in Act 4 (too late). Badly edited, the music sometimes doesn't match the picture. The English subtitles are unreliable (eg 'Intendo, intendo' = 'I hear, I hear'!). Dynamic's release of this production on DVD one year after the CD version has added insult to injury. If you know your 'Ernani' very well and have enjoyed it hearing top performers in the major roles, this isn't for you. A full-price cipher (the star above is Verdi's). If, for some reviewer or other, this recording deserves 5 stars, then the classic ones deserve a million.",1189641600,5,1157,4.908163265306122

This is at a distance the worse of all the series.  The other commentators have already said most of it,  I do not want to repeat it all.  But what bottered me most was the fact that accouding to the plot the personage of the Elvira should be ""young and beautiful"".  Well,  that Mrs. Neves was not the youngest would not be so bad.  But that she also weighs she at least 270 pounds was unforgiveble.  This turned the story unbelievable,  it was hard to endure till the end. How would you feel a Juliet at a Shakespeare play that fat?  Unfortunately for the Verdi fans there are no alternatives of this opera in Bluray...",1402444800,3,758,4.304964539007092

At times, a found the staging a little bit ""static"", with singers standing on the same spot doing their singing. This makes the perfomance somewhat lifeless at times. The singers are good. At first I found that Marco Berti (Ernani) and Susan Neves (Elvira) had problems with intonation, but that soon improved, and later they on they came in good voice. The other main characters - Carlo Guelfi (Don Carlo) and Giacomo Prestia (Silva) are also very good.

8165530,5,B000M06U5M,"Ernani is the fifth of Verdi's canon (1844) and in many ways the beginning of the real Verdian operatic dramas. Ernani is focused on a clear set of issues and as pronounced by Budden (The Operas of Verdi) in this opera Verdi defines the male voice arch types he will use for the rest of his career. The granite like monochromatic bass (Silva) to whom honor and family pride are excessively important, the heroic tenor whose lyrical, ardent, suffering lover and his railing against authority makes him the romantic hero as Victor Hugo had invented him. The third voice type will be the most potent force in Italian opera to come; The Verdi baritone. In the character Carlo, the King of Spain and soon to be Emperor Carlo V he is a mix of conflicting noble and impulsive desires. He looms largest over the events and lives of the others. His is the throne and the power. It is a powerful and exciting story.
At it's premiere this opera was an overwhelming success. It really made Verdi famous and the leading composer of the day. After its triumph in Milan the following year there were over fifty productions throughout Italy and a dozen of so outside Italy; even in Vienna. The romantic revolution in literature and opera was on its way.
Interestingly it was the first Verdi opera to be done in America and in the early 1900's was quite popular; Caruso and Scotti sang arias from it often. (Grandma's Victrola belted out the Soldier's drinking song ""Eviva! Beviam, Beviam! often when I was a wee tot.) It soon lost favor and was very rarely done in my younger days but I did hear the majestic Leonard Warren as Carlo and the superb Leontyne Price as Elvira. (Her ""Ernani, involami!"" still rings in my ears - talk about a ""hot"" number!) Pavarotti sang the tenor part beautifully. His aria ""O tu che l'alma adora"" from the 1983 DVD of the Met's production with Leona Mitchell is a fine recording for the technology of the time.
The cast in this 2005 recording is a roster of good singers. The drama is dominated by the king Don Carlo and in this recording I'm happy to say that baritone Carlo Guelfi does just that. He has a big commanding voice forceful but not forced throughout it's range. He has the looks and the commanding presence with a regal demeanor. He's just right for the part; here a zephyr, now a storm. As de Silva, grandee of Espana, Giacomo Prestia was the inflexible bearer of honor and his word even in the face of death. As with the others it was a serviceable job of acting and action kept on it's relentless pace. Marco Berti has a strong voice not quite mastered but he certainly carried off his part well. He will smooth out the rough edges in vocal production and acting and can make an excellent Verdi tenor. Susan Neves certainly has the voice and controls it well. Her ""Ernani, involami"" was impressive. She has the range. She needs to slim down and get more involved in the action onstage.
The sets made this old traditionalist quite happy. It's a clever setting and a pleasant change from most modern clap-trap. The costumes were also very well done. Bravi! to those involved. As conductor Antonello Allemandi kept everything going at a steady pace and the orchestra under tight control. All in all a good performance of a good opera!",1374192000,3,3263,4.579487179487179
8165531,5,B000M06U5M,"I have already expressed my opinion by refuting some very unfair negative criticism on this indeed enthusiastic and very competent performance of this marvellous early Verdi that traditionally divided audiences in the past.
I wholeheartedly agree with Mr Giles Hall from Tasmania who summed this show all up in great detail, so I don't want to duplicate him.
This is probably the most recent (2005) video issue of a not too frequently recorded opera and as such the picture quality is excellent and so is the sound, so you have a DVD that looks good and sounds good. It is part of the TUTTO VERDI set of complete Verdi oeuvre of 26 operas, issued for Verdi's 200th birthday. And it is an all Italian production.
Now,Italy is the most musical nation in the world, music is their blood and if you don't believe me, please go to Italy and walk down the street almost anywhere (as I often did) and you'll hear singing somewhere that will stop your heart and think it's a Pavarotti. They can put together a DIFFERENT cast for each Verdi opera of singers you'll never hear in your blessed country, even if it is the U.S.A.  I can safely say that there are better singers in their choirs than most opera house soloists.  So please think of that when your read some belly-aching, dyspeptic poo-pooh reviews from individuals whose main purpose I daresay is to see themselves in print since no respectable paying publication will ever have them. No disrespect meant, of course, but please do not approach Verdi with a stomach ache. Try some great Italian wine with pasta instead. Happy listening to you.",1359417600,2,1593,4.706093189964157
8165532,5,B000M06U5M,"I would like to say a few word in defence of this recording of Verdi's ""Ernani"".
I do not know what the previous viewers were watching; but it was definitely NOT this production. I have viewed it and found it to be a very acceptable. OK. It's not Sutherland & Pavarotti; BUT! Berti, Neves & Guelfi et. al. were all  respectable in their respective roles.
The DVD I have of ""Ernani"", is the ORIGINAL production on Dynamic from the Teatro Regio di Parma, 2005.
Which brings me to question this Tutto Verdi Series.
I thought that C Major were producing NEW productions of the 26 Verdi Operas! Yet, they have released what appears to be this re-release of ""Ernani"" into the collection, without mentioning it is a re-release.  I can't imagine them re-staging it again with the same cast and badly as the previous reviewers claim.
Which brings me to the question: Are they going to do this with the other operas?
But! Back to this production of ""Ernani"": I found it to be well produced and the sets and costumes were exceptional. Neves, has a powerful voice with some wonderful chest notes and dynamic timbre. She, at times sinks to the alto register with gusto. Some of her top notes are a bit un-nerving, but on the whole it is a good instrument. Berti, likewise has a nice timbre, the voice is powerful enough and this role seems to suit him. Gurlfi, can't do anything wrong, I quite like his voice and have him in a few operas now.
The remainder of the cast are more than adequate.
The orchestral playing including the off-stage band are spot-on. Tempi correct and does not overpower the singers on stage.
This recording I have only has Linear PCM 2.0 and Dolby 5.1, where as the Tutto Verdi has DTS surround sound. As far as I can tell, that's the only difference.
The Dolby Surround is excellent and does the job. All-in-all a very nice ""Ernani"".
So don't be put off by the negative reviewers. You have to judge it for yourselves. As I mention in most of my crits, we all have diverse tastes and what suites one person does not necessarily suite others. Be brave, buy it and judge for yourselves. It is a beautiful opera with some wonderful choruses, solos, duets & ensembles. If you are familiar with the works of Verdi, you will hear snippets of  ""La  Traviata, Il Trovatore & Giovanna D'Arco in it. All makes for an interesting performance. I already have all 26 operas and the Requiem. However; I am also buying this Tutto Verdi series as well. One can never have too much Verdi. Ciao.",1356220800,6,2489,4.524444444444445
8165533,4,B000M06U5M,"I must apologize for my unfairly low evaluation of Ernani.  I watched and listened again.  Indeed, it was much better by a long shot than it came across to me the first time.  I must have been tired or inattentive or angry.  Certainly, I want to encourage the Tutto Verdi series.  While I'm not wild about this performance, it is very competent and at times rousing.  Please, as I did, listen again and reconsider if an initial negative response is questionable for any reason.",1353542400,9,477,4.619047619047619
8165534,3,B000M06U5M,"I like Ernani. As William Berger notes in ""Verdi With A Vengeance"", it is ""...graced with more melody in a few hours than most composers managed in a lifetime"". Thus it was that I put this disc in the player, with great anticipation, based on the preceeding C Major Tutto Verdi releases.

Alas ...

Three of the four principal singers were average at best. When I heard Marco Berti begin Ernani's first scene aria, all I could think of was the title to a late 1980's show, ""Lend Me A Tenor"". It sounded like he had not warmed up, but even later in the opera, he sounded clumsy and unfocused. Susan Neves, who supposedly has Elvira as one of her major roles, doesn't. Her bottom notes were right off the glottus and her upper notes had a forced quality. Bass Giacomo Prestia as Silva had a noticeable wobble. No one tried to act.

Saving the day, so to speak, was Carlo Guelfi as Don Carlo. Although he, too, sounded like he had not warmed up when he made his entrance, he quickly did and did a nice job, especially in Part III, ""la Clemenza""

Maestro Allemandi had the pace of this energetic opera down cold and was impressive throughout.

Staging sucked!! This is an opera with loads of dramatic tension; after all, with jealousy, vengeance, honor-at-stake, and all that, how could it not? But none of it was developed; it was ""park and bark"" from beginning to end, and what a shame that was. There was almost no interaction between the principals.

Picture quality was excellent, but the surround was odd: it may be that the house was not miked to give that ambience that I relish, but for whatever reason, that sense of ""being there"" was not.

So gentle reader, I continue to hope that in the Verdi bicentennial year, the Met will release last season's Ernani. Now THAT was a rip roaring effort, well worth the price of admission!",1352160000,8,1833,4.519637462235649

8165537,5,B000M06U5M,I almost didn't buy this because of the other awful review on this site. It doesn't pay to rely on one review of anything.  Susan Neves is outstanding in this and her only other DVD of Nabucco. I also liked Carlo Guelfi as Carlo. The conducting was a llttle unanimated at the beginning but got better. I don't understand the negative comments about the sound. I have been an opera lover for over 60 years and saw Corelli and price in Ernani live. Don't miss getting this because of one bad review.,1313280000,5,497,4.4021739130434785
