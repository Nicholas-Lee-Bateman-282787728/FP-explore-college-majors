8410771,5,B003ZQQXH0,"""Good Eats"" goes whole hog in this 3-episode DVD, ""Juicy Meats 3"". Featuring the episodes ""Ham I Am"", ""Chops"", and ""Sausage: A Beautiful Grind"", this is not a disc for vegetarians. I am not a particular fan of chops, so I watched that episode as educational entertainment, but the other two episodes were great and more practical. ""Ham I Am"" is perhaps the definitive cooking show on ham, while ""Sausage: A Beautiful Grind"" was fascinating. Included are bonus ""Ask Alton"" segments where viewer questions are addressed (don't skip them, they are highly informative) and a recipe booklet with featured preparations for these three shows. I recommend ""City Ham"" and ""Italian Sausage"" in particular.

Learning about cooking is an absolute joy with Alton Brown and I highly recommend these episodes of ""Good Eats"".",1452211200,,809,5.128787878787879
