2562323,2,B000FEMBXK,I purchased this video for my sister who has disabilities but does chair aerobics at the senior center.  She enjoys exercising at an easy pace but this video is too fast for her to follow.  Even the older woman in the video looks bored or annoyed at times.,1169078400,9,256,4.3125
2562324,5,B000FEMBXK,I bought this DVD for Christmas for my mother and she loves it. Easy for even a senior to follow.,1168560000,10,97,3.9
2562325,5,B000FEMBXK,I am not sure about the last review this was a DVD not a book. I found this to be an execellent source of exercise for me since I have bad knees and this takes the pressure off them.,1168560000,35,182,3.6923076923076925
2562326,4,B000FEMBXK,This is easy to follow and challenging enough to give me a good workout. I can add weights for a harder workout.,1168387200,10,112,4.136363636363637
2562327,1,B000FEMBXK,"Very misleading.  the first few minutes were seated, then a longer segment standing, then back to seated, then I pretty much gave up.  I cannot stand and was not able or coordinated enough to keep up.  No explanation or instruction given, just follow the leader, which quickly left me in the dust, bewildered and confused.  This is not for you if you cannot stand or if you are elderly and have not exercised much.",1466640000,3,414,4.554054054054054
2562328,4,B000FEMBXK,"Great to be possible to make aerobics in a chair with vigorous  rhythmic  music and good images instructions.
I loved the first 20 minutes, not as much the last 10 or so when enthusiasm and  continuity decreases  and  rhythm vs movements precision  is not good . Because of that I  give the  4 stars
I am 61 and with a low back surgery chronic sciatica which gives me a lot of pain standing for a long time  or twisting  the spine.
Hope  we  can  have more chair  videos  with real aerobics. The HR increases a lot just with the rhytmic movement of raised arms so the heart  benefit can be obtained and it can be enjoyed!",1466121600,3,621,4.224137931034483
2562329,5,B000FEMBXK,I really enjoy the aerobic exercise video as I am unable to do regular aerobic exercise.,1465516800,,88,4.5625
2562330,5,B000FEMBXK,This is a good overall workout for anyone as they show participants doing different levels from easy to a little more advanced. You do need weights and a smallish fitness ball.,1464566400,,176,4.709677419354839
2562331,4,B000FEMBXK,"Seems like Chair Aerobics should be geared more towards Molly, rather than Ron, who was pretty lost during the first half. The exercises are not all in the chair which was a bummer. Nikki standing, saying 'You can do it' is a bit heartbreaking to a young person recently disabled, when it's marketed as Chair Aerobics. It's not that were ""not comfortable"" standing; it's that we literally can't. Glad the movements are fast because it's really hard to get cardio without being able to use my foot. Use of weights is great too. The beginning music sounds like a cat is meowing and the Instructor gives directions based on her perspective. More seasoned instructors usually say 'right' for 'left' because the person watching is mirroring the Instructor. Despite all my critiques, this is a good, fast-paced workout with some modifications presented and I'm grateful that Nikki made a chair video. Would love to see many more of these.",1456012800,,932,4.905063291139241
2562332,2,B000FEMBXK,"I thought this was going to be a total seated workout. But it was not.  The older lady at times seem lost, out breathe.  Also since I taught fitness since 1989 including chair aerobics, the moves were not with the music. I can not recommend this for people who cannot stand up.",1450569600,2,277,4.3076923076923075
2562333,5,B000FEMBXK,I really liked this aerobics DVD so much! We used it so much that we wore it out !.,1438300800,,83,3.4210526315789473
2562334,2,B000FEMBXK,Not truly all chair aerobics. Some standing,1437264000,,43,5.285714285714286
2562335,5,B000FEMBXK,"I bought this last year after breaking my foot,as I couldn't do my regular workouts,but knew I'd be miserable without my daily Fitness ""fix"".I was skeptical,as several other chair workouts I purchased were awful,but I really enjoyed it and worked up a sweat. The second time I used it I used heavier weights and wore ankle weights and I really felt that I got a great burn. Now that I'm 48 and seem to get more workout related injuries,it's nice to have workouts like this in my collection,just in case! I actually get cranky if I have to miss a workout. Besides this one,I also enjoyed the Chair Boxing DVD and Chairacize as well as the Jody Stolove Chair Dancing strength dvds",1428710400,3,678,4.565573770491803
2562336,5,B000FEMBXK,"Some of the other reviews say this is a high energy workout, and it is if you make your movements bigger.  I am disabled with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome due to severe adrenal exhaustion and find that I can make it through this workout on my better days.  There are different levels and I just make my movements smaller so as not to overdo it.  There are also different segments so they can be broken up into different parts of the day if you can't do them all at once.  I would recommend this video for all but the most severely disabled (i.e., those who are bedbound).  Just adjust your movements to make them smaller.",1428451200,6,617,4.37719298245614
2562337,1,B000FEMBXK,"Within the first six mnutes I had to stop it because there was so much standing and lunging.  I expected this to be a chair workout, not something that would further hurt my knee!  I'm extremely disappointed!",1428019200,4,208,4.594594594594595
2562338,1,B000FEMBXK,I wouldn't suggest this if you have limited mobility. She moves to fast it look like the elderly lady on there was struggling to keep up.,1425254400,,137,4.3076923076923075

2562342,5,B000FEMBXK,Excellent!  I definitely felt I was getting a workout even while sitting.  Would recommend.,1418860800,,91,5.428571428571429
2562343,5,B000FEMBXK,"This is my number one workout video. It gives me a serious core, arm and thigh workout on days when my knees hurt too much for other forms of exercise.",1409616000,,151,4.066666666666666
2562344,5,B000FEMBXK,I feel better when I exercise.  This is not to hard for me at my age.  I love the price.  Thanks,1393545600,,96,3.4761904761904763
2562345,5,B000FEMBXK,IT IS NICE TO HAVE AS PART OF MY EXERCISE ROUTINE.  I CAN SWITCH BACK AND FORTH WITH OTHER EXERCISE PROGRAMS.,1378166400,,109,4.190476190476191
2562346,4,B000FEMBXK,"I bought this when I injured my knee and didn't want to stop exercising. It served its purpose, but the one older lady in it is just too much to watch. My son thought she was hilarious!  The music is not that great, but you can turn off the sound and turn on  your own music.",1375488000,,275,3.892857142857143
2562347,4,B000FEMBXK,My only complaint is that the exercises are at too rapid a pace.  It would be nice if there was a slow-down button.  I have arthritis throughout a lot of my body and presently need both knees replaced.  I enjoy the variety of exercises.  Doing the exercises is helping reshape parts of my body I have started to give up on.,1370563200,,323,4.245901639344262
2562348,5,B000FEMBXK,Wonderful dvd!  I have really bad legs but I wanted to do exercise still.  In this dvd you can also tone.  I didn't need to buy any special equipment. At the time I used cans and a pillow! It was nice to see a older/mature woman doing this also.  It actually helped me get stronger little by little.,1369785600,,299,4.103448275862069
2562349,5,B000FEMBXK,"This is a good basic chair aerobics workout with no frills attached. The instructor is straight forward, no nonsense and simple in her directives. It is good for anyone of any age or condition.",1367539200,3,193,4.705882352941177
2562350,1,B000FEMBXK,Not happy about buying this and would like to get my money back! Very misleading. Even the exercises she is doing standing are not with the chair. Dont waste yhour money like i did!,1365552000,5,181,4.352941176470588
2562351,5,B000FEMBXK,"I've wasted a few dollars on videos that were not right for me.  But ""Chair Aerobics for Everyone"" was just perfect.  I'm 62 with COPD and have to use oxygen for these exercises.  I wish they would make another for the abdomen.",1363219200,,227,4.357142857142857
2562352,5,B000FEMBXK,"I'm very happy with my order. it's a great workout,  I didn't think it would be hard but it really gives you a good workout.  I would order again. Thank you",1360713600,2,156,4.0
2562353,4,B000FEMBXK,it is the perfect answer for an old lady  and I suppose you want more words to say what I have already said,1360368000,,107,3.652173913043478
2562354,3,B000FEMBXK,"I am not a fan of aerobics, It seems more about co ordination than exercise.  If you like aerobics you  might like this.  It is for those who want to get their heart pumping, but for some reason can not stand very long.  I only did this for 15 min and it got very repetitive for me.

She has a man and an older lady do the workout with her.  I had to laugh at the expression on the older ladies face during one exercise .  She was obviously having a struggle with it.  I also got amused because they moved into the shade.",1358380800,2,521,3.9423076923076925
2562355,2,B000FEMBXK,"This dvd was not meant for those just starting to get into shape or trying to get back in shape after recovering from something like knee injuries. On the modified movements, you really cannot see them very well. If you are confined to a chair, you cannot do a lot of the exercises. After trying this video once, you may be want to give up. Not very inspiring if you cannot do the standing exercises. Read the dvd descriptions carefully if you are seeking seated only exercises. There are other dvds in this series (Chair Aerobics for Everyone) that are completed seated.",1344038400,,571,4.607843137254902
2562356,4,B000FEMBXK,"This video is good it is not too strenous and at the right level for anyone, sometimes its alittle too simple but overall it is pretty good",1335916800,,139,4.185185185185185
2562357,5,B000FEMBXK,I just started doing this dvd and its really a good one. Some of the exercise make you sweat. Its a good dvd for those who cant do regular exercise dvd. If you are obese and want to lose weight start with this one first.,1335398400,2,220,3.911111111111111
2562358,3,B000FEMBXK,"The exercises work pretty well for my wife since she has bad knees and hips.  The presentation in not very exciting, but the exercises provide a good workout.",1329868800,,158,4.642857142857143
2562359,2,B000FEMBXK,"There are positive aspects to this video.  The work-out has integrity, but there are too many exercises done standing (yes, really!) and the pace isn't user friendly -- too fast with not enough explanation of the movement.  Paul Eugene is cheaper and does a much better job.",1327276800,2,274,4.808510638297872
2562360,2,B000FEMBXK,"If you have any mobility issues, this is not a video workout for you. It is fast-paced and does quite a bit of standing exercises. The older woman in the video looks like she's in a lot of pain and discomfort throughout the entire program and the guy gets lost trying to follow the female instructor.
So, if you've got joint pain, difficulty standing, or decreased range of motion, I would not recommend this video.",1319500800,,415,4.546666666666667
2562361,1,B000FEMBXK,"I just purchased this video because I'm having a medical issue that requires me to be off my feet.  It's really a horrible exercise video. First of all, there is quite a bit that isn't seated exercise.  Second, I'm not sure where the instructor learned how to count, but she doesn't seem to be able to (there seems to be trouble with left and right also).  Also, she's never in time with the bad music that's playing.  And the exercises are not balanced on the left and right.  I am so disappointed and not happy with this purchase at all.",1308700800,10,539,4.35
2562362,5,B000FEMBXK,"Who said exercise is easy? I've just finished the workout and I feel great! I had a hip operation 7 weeks ago and haven't had any aerobics since. Before my surgery I was swimming for 40-60 minutes a day. So I was starting to feel yucky, depressed. Nikki is a good teacher, energetic, and easy to follow.
Sometimes I couldn't keep up with her. No problem. I just did what I could. Nevertheless I got a good workout and am ready to face the day with energy.",1304035200,4,455,4.241379310344827
2562363,4,B000FEMBXK,"This DVD was purchased for someone who has severe arthritis in one knee and needs a way to get exercise. There are plenty of chair exercises but there are also some that require the person to stand up and move a little. Someone who can't do it will have to skip that part of the program. Otherwise, it is
useful, especially if hand weights are incorporated.",1300406400,,357,4.424242424242424
2562364,4,B000FEMBXK,"While I prefer Leslie Sansone's indoor walks, due to health issues I've had to find other options and this is a good option for me. Wish there were more like these!",1299196800,,164,4.32258064516129
2562365,4,B000FEMBXK,"This dvd provides an excellent workout!
Don't be fooled by the 'chair'; this provides a vigorous set of exercises!  Thanks---",1283731200,,125,5.25
2562366,1,B000FEMBXK,"I didn't even order it.
I turned on the trailer and the sweat shirt was off and the bra was all there was.
Yuk.
Who wants to look at that?",1273622400,,138,3.6333333333333333
2562367,3,B000FEMBXK,"I bought this DVD looking for an exercise I can do while recovering from a knee injury. The title IS ""Chair Aerobics for Everyone"", but it's not for anyone that can't move their legs.
When I'm recovered enough that I can bend my leg, I think I will enjoy this workout. The title is mis-leading tho.",1271548800,7,298,4.339285714285714
2562368,5,B000FEMBXK,This DVD is great for anyone who wants to exercise. No excuses here. It is money well spent.,1268352000,3,92,4.166666666666667
2562369,2,B000FEMBXK,"The workout is too fast for chair exercise at some points of the video for seniors to do, and trying to get this off my main computer, and onto a DVD is a crock, Amazon should not be selling stuff like this with such restrictive DRM, they don't do it with there Mp3's, why  do it with this??? 2 stars for effort.",1267315200,2,312,4.032258064516129
2562370,4,B000FEMBXK,"I received this video last week and today was my first time using it. Let me say it is awesome other than the instructor going a bit fast when she transitions from move to move I love it. I'm sure once I get into the groove of the dvd I won't have any problems transitioning from move to move. I have rheumatoid arthritis and scoliosis and can't do the exercises that have you on your feet too long. My doctor only wanted me using the stationary bike and doing water aerobics. Well on days when I don't want to travel all the way to the gym this video will be great. If it wasn't for the water aerobics I would cancel my gym membership. This video is really good and you get a excellent workout sitting in a chair. I normally where a sweatsuit, two waist sweatbands and a sweatband on both upper arms let's just say I was drenched in sweat. The video is about 25 to 30 min and it is well worth the money. Now I will say if you have limited movement then this may be too fast paced for those individuals but for anyone who needs to lose weight because of RA or back problems and can't do the standard standing exercises this video is perfect. I am 286 now hopefully with the help of this video and my water aerobics I can lose 20lbs and then so on and so on.",1265587200,3,1257,4.093117408906883
2562371,4,B000FEMBXK,"Because of chronic foot problems I have used the ""chair"" type exercise programs for several years.  This particular DVD is pretty good, but it's not REALLY for everyone.  There are several instances where they assume that you are capable of standing for some of the exercises or stretches.

The exercise program has three participants and I am assuming it's to show the  different fitness levels.  Several times the older participant seems distracted, looking off to the side while attempting to do the exercises.

Please note too that the instructor assumes you have a small exercise ball with no mention made of it on the DVD cover to forewarn you of needing this equipment.

That being said, it is nice to have a change of pace from all the ""Chair Dancing"" exercise DVD's I have been using.  You can also choose between the ""full seated"" version of the program or using the one that you are standing part of the time.

All in all, it's ""pretty"" good.",1265500800,7,953,4.692771084337349
2562372,1,B000FEMBXK,"Most of the time these reviews are correct, however, I teach Tai Chi/Chi Kung to seniors and thought I would do a varied workout in chairs so I ordered this on previous reviews.  Even though seated my seniors could not do the repitions this person is doing.  To me chair means there are limitations for the person doing the exercise so movement need to be modified, which is not the case with this DVd.  Just felt I wasted my money!",1261008000,3,432,4.375
2562373,4,B000FEMBXK,"It's surprising how well exercising from a chair can get your heart rate up.  This is perfect for me because I have bad knees and, when they ""act up"", I'm unable to exercise the ""normal"" way.  However, these chair aerobics DO require the use of your legs to really get things going.  If you're wheelchair bound, it may not be the aerobics for you.",1257897600,5,347,4.390625

Loved the variety; legs, weights, resistance, etc.  My only complaint is that the leader did not always maintain consistent rhythm with the music.  My 90 year-old mother did the exercises with me.  After my recovery, I gave it to her to continue using.  Prior to the video, her main exercise was walking.

2562378,5,B000FEMBXK,"***UPDATE***
With consistent use, this video helped me lose 30 pounds.  It is a safe and effective workout tool.

I was skeptical at first, but decided to give this video a try and buy it.  I am glad I did.  It has you working hard!  I am unable to stand very long, or do a lot of twisting, etc as in conventional aerobics, so this is perfect for me.  It has a warm up, light weights, a cool down, you name it, it is a head to toe work out.  I am glad I bought this dvd.  Oh and on this dvd is a seated and a standing workout.

I had no problems 3 yrs ago.  2 years ago I gave birth to my new baby (the older one is 10) and a few months after he was born my MS did quite a number on me.

I've gained weight, never could lose the baby/pregnancy weight.  I am TIRED of sitting in a chair all the time and decided to do something for myself!  I started using this DVD and I am quite impressed.  I can't do everything but I do what I can.  I can do all the arm and upper body work so I just keep doing that while they are showing things I can't do.  I'm hoping that as my physical therapy progresses I'll be able to do more but even doing just what I can do I worked up a sweat!

I look forward to getting myself a little more active with this!  So far I think it's great for people like me who are disabled.",1246233600,29,896,3.732620320855615

2562386,5,B000FEMBXK,"There are two workouts on this video. One is completely seated, the other is mostly seated with a small amount of standing exercises. I have congenital hip dysplasia resulting in two operations at 13 weeks old and two total hip replacements before the age of 40 all on the same hip. I've only been able to manage water exercise as most ""land"" workouts result in a lot of pain either from compensentory movements to protect my hip or the hip itself. This is the FIRST chair aerobics video that I can comfortably do. I have tried several. I can even do the ones standing up! It's a great workout and with some adaption for my lack of muscular development in my operated leg, it's working well. I highly recommend it. If you can't do all of the exercises, just keep moving until you can join back in.",1219190400,30,797,4.428571428571429
2562387,4,B000FEMBXK,"I thought the video was very good,just one small remark the guy taking part looked a bit too fit.... it would have being better I think to use someone who maybe had a disability, and chair exercise was the best option. But it was a very enjoyable easy to follow video. The instructor was excellent.",1209254400,5,298,4.4363636363636365
2562388,5,B000FEMBXK,This is a fun way to workout. Even though it is chair aerobics you really work up a sweat with this one. Because of sinus trouble I have dizzy moments and this is a way I can work out and not have to worry about balance because I have the chair for support even during the standing exercising portion of the vedio. Great for the ederly who want to stay in shape or for the young who need balance for what ever reason!,1205020800,2,417,4.036144578313253
2562389,4,B000FEMBXK,"This was more of a workout than I actually expected.  I have very bad knees and standing is very hard for me, jumping is impossible.  When I saw that the excercises were done in a chair, I decided to try it.  Now, SOME of the excercises are done standing, but, still, in a very limited area.  This makes it much easier to do in my living room.  My heart rate does indeed go up and I really do sweat.  My legs are getting stronger, and it's only been a month!  This is truly a great workout for physically challanged people like myself.",1202428800,16,535,4.186274509803922
2562390,5,B000FEMBXK,"This video really works for me and I use it often.
I have just started doing workouts and this one is at my fitness level.
Some of the other workouts out there are too fast and advanced.

There is enough room in this program for me to kick it up a notch when I gain ability.",1200614400,6,274,3.892857142857143
2562391,1,B000FEMBXK,"Thought the title sounded like it would beneficial for us.  We've some physical limitations, making chair exercises doable.

This is an amateur kind of video.  Three people doing what are supposed to be three different levels.  Hard to follow because they all seem to be doing the same thing except the very older person.  The exercise coach seems to be listening to her own music because the count is off...never even on each side, and very very fast!  No I would not tell anyone to get it.",1198800000,23,491,4.586206896551724
2562392,5,B000FEMBXK,"I purchased this DVD for my mom who has bad knees. I wanted to get her a workout tape that she could do but wouldn't have her jumping around and standing. I found Chair Aerobics for everyone and got it.

This morning was the first time we tried and I loved it... I would like to think I am pretty fit, and it challanged me. Mom did the entire workout and she never said anything about her knees hurting. It's not a long workout but it gets the job done.

Thanks!",1196985600,17,462,4.065934065934066
2562393,3,B000FEMBXK,I am 63 but used to doing Richard Simmons exercise videos pretty strenuously.  I hurt my knee so had to tone things down during recovery.  Senior citizen exercise videos were too slow but this one did get my heart rate up when I followed the primary trainer.,1190764800,13,258,4.468085106382978
2562394,4,B000FEMBXK,I run a seniors exercise program three days a week in my community.  This video is great for such a program.  There are no strenuous activities and no floor activities.  The pace is a little fast as the instructor moves from one exercise to the next.  The video is low budget but it gets the job done well.  I recommend it to anyone seeking a low impact exercise video.,1179273600,14,369,4.2898550724637685
2562395,5,B000FEMBXK,"I purchased the Chair Aerobics a bit over a month ago.  My reasons for purchasing it were - I am overweight, but I also need a hip and knee replacement.  I can not be operated on until I get a BMI (Body Mass Index under 40).

I never realised that sitting in a chair could make you perspire and puff!

I use the chair aerobics every 2nd day and in a month I have lost 7 inches all over and combined with a good eating plan lost 1 kilo per week.

This DVD is great in that you have three people at different levels that you can choose to watch.  Once you co-ordinate yourself, the exercises are great and would appeal to all ages, all fitness levels and those with arthritus who find it difficult to exercise with movement.

Definately recommend to all.",1176163200,120,752,4.216783216783217
2562396,3,B000FEMBXK,"I bought this DVD so I could do some kind of activity after my foot surgery--not a good idea. Although it made me work up a sweat, it hurt my foot and some of the exercising has you standing. I don't think ""chair aerobics"" is an appropriate name for it. It's a bit misleading. I'm unable to flex or point my foot and the instructor in this video is VERY high energy. The gentleman and the senior lady in the video both seem to have a tough time keeping up with her.",1170201600,72,465,4.065217391304348

8121508,4,B000FEMBXK,"A pretty good seated aerobic workout. I like the variety of the workout movements and techniques, including weights and an exercise ball.  It's a fast-paced routine, and the instructor's lack of timing irked me at times. Her movements often get off-time with the beat of the music.  The two participants behind her sometimes have trouble matching her pace or seem confused.

Even though it's a seated workout, there's quite a bit of leg exercises.  Folks with limited or no lower body movement might need to skip or heavily modify some sections.",1506470400,,545,4.956043956043956
8121509,5,B000FEMBXK,"I suffered a Lisfranc fracture 10 weeks ago. I have been mostly immobile during that time, and Chair Aerobics for Everyone made me feel like I was back in my Jazzercise class (albeit in a chair!). The exercises got my heartrate up and incorporated the whole body. 1-2 variations were shown of the exercises. To participate fully you do need hand weights and an inflated ball, but again, variations are shown if you do not wish to use equipment. I look forward to trying more Chair Aerobics titles.",1497052800,,497,4.659090909090909

Part of the program is actually standing up, although there are modifications shown if you can't stand. I think the warmup and cooldown are especially good. The whole program was too much for me.
