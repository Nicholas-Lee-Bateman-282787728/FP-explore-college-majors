463206,5,6302409365,"I feel,in my humble opinion,that this is one of the best comicial adaptations. No. Scratch that-one of the best films ever made. I think that Gomez and Mortisha are the best romantic couple ever;To hell with Romeo and Juliette. Take my advice. AS a fellow writer I can pick a good one when I see it.",978652800,,299,4.357142857142857
463207,4,6302409365,this is one of the better comedies out there. the characters were well recreated too.,975628800,2,85,4.733333333333333
463208,5,6302409365,"I have alway's been a fan of The Addam's Family TV show of the 1960's  & when the movie came out in 91 I thought it was just another lousey  re-make of an old TV classic. By time it came on video something inside me  was urging me to rent it. I did and it was worth every penny I spent, I  liked it so much I bought it when I took the movie back.
The cast gives  suberb performances especially Christina Ricci who, in my opinoin, stole  the show from the rest of the cast. Angelica Houston, Raul Julia, &  Christopher Lloyd also gave outstanding performances. The story is quite  simple, Gomez (Julia) is still searching for his long lost brother Fester.  When a greedy woman & her son get hold of the story & hear about  the Addams' fortune she decides to dress her son up as Fester to get hold  of the family fortune. Some of the most funny parts are watching Wendsday  & Pugsly ""play"" with their electric chairs & butcher  knives. A MUST SEE!",966124800,3,945,4.212290502793296
463209,5,6302409365,"I am a fan of movies that can be watched for fun again and again.  I find both Addams family movies (with this same cast) up there with my favorite  fun movies (Princess Bride, Ferris Bueller) and they are always there to  bring a smile to a boring day.
Morticia and Gomez are played very well.  Gomez is contagiously energetic and Morticia has such memorable lines  (""Don't torture yourself Gomez, that's my job"") that just seem to  emit from her character.  I have long been a Christina Ricci fan and she  looks and plays the part to perfection as does Jimmy Workman.  I am also a  huge Christopher Lloyd fan and seeing him in Fester was wonderful.  I do  prefer Carol Kane (Princess Bride - Valerie) over this movie's  grandma.
This is a delightful movie that just keeps you smiling and I  highly recommend it for those boring days when you just are in the mood for  a ""fun"" movie.",965347200,,884,4.4375
463210,5,6302409365,"Barry Sonnefeld does GREAT job directing this film based on the characters of cartoonist Charles Addams and the classic 1960s TV series.  Anjelica Huston, Raul Julia, and Christopher Lloyd give SUPERB performances in their  roles of 'MORTICIA', 'GOMEZ', and 'UNCLE FESTER'.  The roles made famous  in the TV series by Carolyn Jones, John Astin and Jackie Coogan.

463308,5,6302409365,"This is a movie that represents traits that the traitional family has but with a spin to it. The family is not normal at all, they do not live the normal life but the love and the way they treat each other in the family is very traditional. The parents would do anything for their family and that is just what they do. They make their family complete again once the brother comes back into the picture. They have generations living under one roof helping to raise the two (becoming three) children.",1512691200,,498,4.423913043478261
463309,5,6302409365,"I grew up watching the television show and hearing the famous song that always accompanies the show and movies. It is fascinating to see one screenwriter's interpretation of family that is both normal and abnormal simultaneously.
When the Addams family lawyer gets into some debt trouble with a loan shark, he becomes involved in a scam to steal the Addams family fortune. In a tale of brotherhood with two men who are not actually blood-related and much raising of suspicions within the family about this new version of Fester Addams, the film encompasses the ideal family in a very far from ideal sense of socialization. The man who pretends to be Fester realizes that his biological mother has not truly been a mother to him and decides to trade her fear-mongering for the loving and unique embrace of the Addams family.",1512432000,,823,4.843971631205674

463311,3,6302409365,"The family in this movie is no ordinary family. The Addams are outgoing and not afraid to show their true colors. They are unique and out of the ordinary. The Addams family goes against the normal values of an American family and this movie shows those values. The struggle to accept Uncle Fester into the family again is the main issue of the movie. Despite showing all the normal fester qualities, he also shows a shyness and unfamiliarity with the family that raises suspicion. Through everything, family remains the centerpiece of the film.",1511568000,,544,4.860215053763441
463312,4,6302409365,"A very well-made adaptation of the classic TV series. While it isn't Citizen Kane, it is one of the best films of its own genre.",1511049600,,128,4.16
463313,4,6302409365,This movie is a little bit more dated than the sequel because they spend a bit more time in the real world versus the Adams home. But it was still very funny and I enjoyed it a lot. I think it holds up well.,1510012800,,207,3.727272727272727

463396,5,6302409365,"Just a lot of fun from start to finish.  Young children may find it confusing but older children will get the joke.  Great acting and a fun plot all through the movie, a little over the top which it should be.  Of course, they had great material to reference starting from the original cartoons by who else but Charles Addams.  In the 60's they made a television series that was just as entertaining especially if you had neighbors who were just a little bit strange.  Now, for the rest of the night I will be fighting the urge to snap my fingers to the tune playing in my head while I search for my old book of Addams Family.",1499558400,,626,4.226890756302521

I found myself asking time and time again: how will they do those special effects?  And I will be curious to find out when it is closer to their performances in April.

The actors aren't as good as in the series.  Even Oscar winner Angelica Huston cant quite pull off being Carolyn Jones.  Christina Ricci as Wednesday comes off the best.  If you don't know much about the t.v. show.  Maybe you'll like the movie better then I did.  But who doesn't know the t.v. show.,1472774400,,443,4.253012048192771

464891,5,6302409365,"The Addams Family movie allowed what was once a staple on television for me as a kid to come to the big screen.  Sure, it had new actors in all places but each and every one of them were perfectly cast.  Raul Julia easily stepped into John Astin's television role as Gomez, the family patriarch.  Anjelica Huston, Morticia, donned the flowing death robe of Carolyn Jones.  Lurch, the 7' tall Carel Struycken stepped into the role of the family's faithful butler from Ted Cassidy.  My favorite from the movie, Wednesday, wonderfully portrayed by Christini Ricci and Pugley by Ken Weathermax.  That leaves the extended family Grandmama, Marie Blake; Fester, Christopher Lloyd; John Franklin as Cousin It and Christopher Hart as Thing.  ""Thank you, Thing.""  That's a phase still in use by us older folks.

The movie will leave you laughing and with a nostalgia and an urge to stroll through Amazon for copies of the original series.  Believe me, it's worth it.  This movie is a hoot.  The absolute best line came from Ricci when asked if she wanted to buy Girl Scout (my words, not the movie's) cookies.  She retorts with, ""Is it made with real Girl Scouts?""  Brilliant writing, fantastic acting and a wonderful bow to the original series.",1466899200,,1236,4.796208530805687

464942,5,6302409365,"This movie is magnificent. It has all sorts of little nods and homages to the original cartoons by Charles Addams, and even a few musical to the television series. Mostly, however, the movie stands entirely on its own, with many memorable ghoulish and comedic scenes. Among my favorites:

a. Wednesday ""electrifrying"" Pugsley in the electric chair in order to play a game called ""Is There A God?"",  while Morticia looks indulgently on (she SHOULD be indulgent -- they're LATE for the charity auction!).

b. Wednesday, Lurch, and Pugsley selling lemonade; a Girl Scout stops by and offers to trade some of her cookies for a glass. ""Are you SURE [your lemonade] is made with real lemons?"" she asks snootily. ""Are [your cookies] made with real Girl Scouts?"" Pugsley asks deadpan. (He, of course, is serious!)

c. Wednesday's answer to the question, ""Where's YOUR [Halloween] costume?"": ""This IS my costume. I'm a homicidal maniac. They look just like everyone else.""

...To say nothing of the Mamushka! Who could forget the Dance of Brotherly Love?!

And lots of ghoulish hijinks of every other kind. Watch the movie -- you won't regret it.

By the way -- if you want a SPOILER, there's one available. (Those who are intimately familiar with Lewis Carroll's ""Through The Looking Glass"" and who DON'T want a spoiler, should stop reading IMMEDIATELY in case they read something they don't want to!)

To derive a spoiler (and the theme of the whole movie), do this:

1. First, find a copy of ""Through The Looking Glass"" by Lewis Carroll.

2. Turn to Chapter 11.

3. Ignore the Chapter Number (either ""11"" or ""XI"") and the Chapter Title (""Waking""); neither one is important. You want the chapter's content, which in its entirety is just a single eight-word sentence (!). (Take note of the punctuation and the italicized word.)

4. From that single, eight-word sentence, strike out the words ""a kitten"" and insert, in lieu thereof, the words ""Uncle Fester"".

5. Voila! You now have your spoiler, and the theme of the whole movie!

6. WARNING!!! DO *NOT* DO THIS UNLESS YOU REALLY WANT TO SPOIL THE ENDING OF THE MOVIE!!! I warn you, you really DO need to take this warning seriously; you really can utterly destroy your enjoyment of the movie if you fail to heed it.

465184,2,6302409365,"The Addams family movie gets a new blu-ray release finally
being a new blu-ray edition which comes with new HD transfer and new 5.1 mix
i also expected a new retrospective making of featurette
with Director Barry sonnenfeld and other cast and crew
well i was wrong for sure
the original dvd release was by Paramount which only had 2 trailers for the extras
no behind the scenes featurette at all, just a Teaser trailer & Theatrical trailer

now Warner bros have gained the rights to film and released it on blu-ray for the first time ever
the product details say Paramount well that's bulls***, this new blu-ray is Warner bros
so the films rights! have changed studios
and guess what this new version has the exact same content as the DVD release
the HD transfer may look very Good probably better than the very old dvd release
and a new 5.1 mix whioch does sound better than the old Dolby digital
but as for the extras, all you get is the Teaser trailer & Theatrical trailer
no new retrospective featurette which is what should've been added
not even a commentary track by Barry sonnenfeld has been added
Disgusting effort by Warner bros for sure, as a fan of the film i'm insulted
5 stars for the film, only 1-2 stars for this new blu-ray only worth $5 or less",1439769600,5,1262,4.48695652173913

Raul Julia and Angelica Huston will always be Gomez and Morticia to me. Carel Struycken is striking as Lurch. But the real stars of the show are Christopher Lloyd as Uncle Fester and Christina Ricci as Wednesday. The plot is that after 25 years, Fester went missing and the Addams Family have been seemingly more unhappy because of this. Meanwhile, a few crooks are out to steal the Addams' fortune, just when ""Fester"" returns home. It will make you laugh, you will be entertained. I recommend this gothic comedy to anyone.",1432339200,,650,4.660869565217391

467073,5,6302409365,"This is a movie that reminds me of Ghostbusters in as much that's is funny for different reasons at different times in a persons life. I remember seeing this movie in the theater when it was released in 1991. I was 7 years old and I loved this movie for the giant house, the creepy hand and my god the school play scene while the more adult dialogue was lost on me. Fast forward 22 years and I still love this movie, but more for the dialogue of actors like Angelica Houton and the amazing Ral Juli. Some of the lines that come out of The Adam's mouths are just amazing.

467223,1,6302409365,"I went to see this movie when it originally came out. I don't recall what the circumstances were but I fell asleep early into the showing. I finally decided to give it another chance all these years later and now I know why I slept the first time, it's terrible! As a kid I enjoyed the tv show and was hoping for some of the same off-beat humor in the movie. Not even close, the gags were just silly, the characters ridiculous. For the second time I couldn't make it through the movie, this time I finally just turned it off. I couldn't stand it any longer. What a huge disappointment from a classic Tv show to this crap. Don't misunderstand me, the Tv show was silly but in a good way. Everything in the movie was just over done. Don't expect a review from me on the follow-up - ""Addams Family Values"". I won't be watching it.
Just after writing this review I decided to check out how many stars other people were giving this movie. It gets 4.5 stars overall!!! This is why relying on the ratings really doesn't help much, I've watched movies with 3 stars that I thoroughly enjoyed and obviously 4.5 stars which were terrible. I wonder how many good movies I've missed because it received poor over all reviews on Amazon. I've sure watched some bad movies that received 4-5 stars.

There is something special about the way the original comic and this movie diffuses the fear we have of dark things and shows that love transcends all of them.  The message of embracing each other's unique differences is as relevant today as it ever was.  From a film perspective, the Addams home is delightfully Gothic, and the acting is superb.  Uncle Fester's expressions as Morticia surveys the contents of his luggage are a priceless example.",1419206400,,500,4.916666666666667

John Astin and Carolyn Jones ARE Gomez and Morticia.  The stories didn't matter; these actors simply carried the shows because of their sublime characterizations.  I kind of wish I had never seen the movie since it dilutes the joy of the TV series,  On the other hand, it demonstrates how wonderful the TV series was.",1417219200,2,476,4.595238095238095

468159,5,6302409365,"The Addams Family is a remake/movie of a series that ran in the seventies. The delight and humor of this movie is particularly humorous to those of us who saw the old series and reruns as children. The cast pulled off the remake with astonishing likenesses to the old characters instead of trying to reinvent them, but with a modern twist. The Addams' are a comedic gothic bunch who do things they're own way in spite of the world about them; while the children play with electric chairs and gallows,  Morticia (played perfectly by Angelica Huston) feeds her carnivorous plant ""Cleopatra"" whom has a penchant for any guests straying in the house, as ""Grand MA ma"" cooks up supper for the family while tentacles wave in the pot. Gomez (Paul Rulia) flips about the house practicing his swordwork and Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd)  lights a light bulb with his mouth! And the seven foot butler ""Lurch"" will kindly take your hat for you, just hope he leaves your head on your shoulders! And don't forget ""Thing"" the disembodied hand that scampers about the house like a pet- a pet that answers the phone and will kindly act as a golf tee...It's all just another day in The Adams Family household.
  In this remake, Fester has been missing for twenty years much to the grief of younger brother Gomez. A Lady Loan Shark and her bruiser of a son, along with the Adams' crooked accountant, try to shave the thugs head and try to pass him off as the long lost Fester, all in hopes of finding and stealing the Adams' famous fortune of gold and treasure. But the Addams household turns out to be a hard nut to crack!",1383523200,2,1608,4.553633217993079

Enough to make me cringe (I thought I put in the Adams Family movie, not a Christmas one) until the camera pans up to show the Adams family on the roof, sinister expressions on their faces, ready to pour a cauldron of bubbling brew onto the pesky singers.

Morticia's dead-pan acting adds humor to the scene: in one instance, Wednesday is trying to electrocute her brother, and Morticia gets mad at her not for electrocuting him, but for holding them up (they were supposed to be going somewhere). Morticia's romance with her husband is so over-the-top that it's funny, and of course the storyline with Uncle Fester is both captivating and poignant.

468758,3,6302409365,"Everyone remembers them, the gaggle of funny misfits from the grand old days of black and white television. The Addams Family have become synonymous with morbid humor, and the film is no different. It's even quite charming, in a rather bleak kind of way.

Most families have an eccentric or two, but this one has six. The Addams Family are known throughout the neighborhood for being rather grim. There is the rather obnoxious Gomez (Julia), who purposefully breaks windows in his neighbor's house just for fun, his delightfully morose wife Morticia (Huston), who trims roses and keeps just the stems, her deranged mother (Malina), the infamous Frankenstein-like butler, called ""Lurch"" (Struycken), a disembodied hand called ""Thing,"" and the children: Wednesday (Ricci) and Pugsley (Workman), who live purely for the joy in electrocuting one another. Employed by the Addams Family is a local lawyer, Tully Alford (Dan Hedaya), who is deeply in debt. Knowing that his employers seem to have a boundless amount of gold deep in the family vaults, he attempts to discern how best to take it from them.

Brought into this dubious plan is the woman responsible for the misery in his life, the woman to whom he owes a fortune. Abigail Craven (Elizabeth Wilson) devises a plan to pass her reluctant and mentally deranged son off as Gomer's long lost older brother Fester (Lloyd), who vanished some twenty years before and was never heard from again. Fester is welcomed into the house but treated with suspicion by the children, who suspect that he is up to something. Even as he attempts to discern the secrets of the monstrous old house, Fester finds himself lured deeper into their world of morbid fascinations, sadistic pranks, and melancholy dinner conversations, which places his mother's plan in jeopardy. Not everyone will appreciate the kind of humor to be found in this creepy little film, but more than once it had me smiling. This is the most deranged family you will ever find, and yet they are wonderfully appealing. The children and their attempts to decapitate one another (never meant in ill humor).

Gomez and Morticia's youthful passion whenever they have a moment alone. The antics of ""Thing"" as it scampers about the house. If you liked the old television series, you will enjoy the film. If you are not familiar with either one, you may want to be forewarned that a healthy, morbid sense of humor is a must if you intend to visit this sinister domain. The casting was perfect, particularly Huston as Morticia, a woman who is empirical but also beautiful. Ricci's performance is extremely restrained, as the character is very morose and withdrawn, but the children grow on you. I am not sure why this was given a PG13 rating, as there is very little inappropriate content, and must conclude that the antics of the Addams children might have encouraged kids to follow dangerous experiments. They are shown hooking one another up to electric chairs, standing in the rain with an antenna in the hopes of attracting lightening, chasing one another around the house wielding mallets and knives, and horrifying outsiders with a gory depiction of a sword fight, complete with fake blood that sprays the first two rows of observers.

There is no sexual content, but Morticia and Gomez make out passionately on several occasions. Mild innuendo intrudes, along with sparse profanity. There are some nude statues in the graveyard. Dark humor involves conversations about death, jokes on torture and pain, food that is still moving on the plate, and quips on mortality. The only element that made me particularly uneasy was the presence of a sance, when Grandma rubs a crystal ball and calls out to the spirit of Fester.

It's dark humor, it's stylish, it's class and degradation at the same time, it's tasteful deprivation, it's an oxymoron that works.

468837,5,6302409365,"Charles Addams' kooky characters from the classic comic strip and television series return to life in their own feature film, THE ADDAMS FAMILY, from 1991. THE ADDAMS FAMILY is a macabre masterpiece of comic horror, and one of the finest of its breed. The refined humor is both witty and intelligent, but equally matched with entertaining sight gags and physical comedy. While no one could ever truly replace John Astin, Carolyn Jones, and the rest of the original stars, the casting is simply inspired. Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston are worthy successors as Gomez and Morticia Addams, losing themselves in the morbid characters. A young Christina Ricci steals the show in her wicked performance as Wednesday Addams. If any one thing succeeds over the acting and writing in THE ADDAMS FAMILY, it is the incredible production design that brings the Addams household to life and gives it a playful character of its own. THE ADDAMS FAMILY is nothing short of a modern classic that lives up to (and often succeeds over) the original series.

468866,5,6302409365,"I loved the Addams Family when it was first a television show. Not sure why I waited until now to see the movie. The casting was brilliant. Anjelica Huston is perfect as Morticia and Raul Julia is a red-hot Gomez Addams. The effects are great. Thing is just as I remembered and so is Cousin It. The music is also inspired. Hammer was not my first choice for the soundtrack, but once I heard the songs, I agree he did the update with style.

So, what's the story? A cash-strapped Addams Family retainer wants to cash in on the gold doubloons in the family vault. What better way to do that than find Gomez's long-lost brother Fester and return him to the fold? Only the man isn't Fester....or is he?

The plot had me laughing from beginning to end. This is the kind of story I remember from the original shows. The best thing about this film is that my non-horror fan husband can watch it with me without a problem.

After I've seen the film on Prime, I'm buying it for my Halloween collection. Thanks, Amazon!

468871,5,6302409365,"My first attempt at watching this movie failed.  I actually turned it off; I was so bored.  Sadly, this was largely due to the fact that I never watched the show, ever, and so I wasn't really in the mood and didn't know what I was in for.  After watching the wildly entertaining `Addams Family Values', I decided to check this one out a second time.  It flowed much easier for me, to where I could actually make it through the entire film, and I found myself rather liking what I was seeing.  I've seen this one (as well as `Values', which has grown on me even more) a few times now, and I must admit that both films hold up ridiculously well, largely thanks to the incredible cast.  From Anjelica Huston to Christina Ricci, this film glows thanks to their darkly satirical performances.  Some have noted that the plot is dumb, but I'd say less dumb and more predictable (it just seems lazy), but the dumbness is something to be expected and even relished in a film like this because the vibe soaks in with the atmosphere to present a curiously `special' take on something that is familiar.  I'm just glad that Tim Burton didn't direct this one too, although the early 90's was his heyday and so maybe he would have done something special with this.  Alas, `The Addams Family' is a total joy, and one that I recommend wholeheartedly.  Give it a try, maybe two or three, but once it sinks in it sinks it for good.",1315267200,,1412,4.3961538461538465

468873,4,6302409365,"Years ago, Fester Adams (Christopher Lloyd) left on a trip to the Bermuda Triangle. Since then the Addams family has not seen him. After many years of holding seance's, Fester finally comes home to his brother's family (Raul Julia, Anjelica Huston, Christina Ricci, and Jimmy Workman), accompanied by a Dr. Greta Pinder-Schloss (Elizabeth Wilson) who supposedly found him washed up in the Bermuda Triangle, but might be looking for more than to reunite a family.

As a general rule, adaptations of old TV shows suck. I'm not trying to be mean, but there are only a few that I actually like, such as: Dukes of Hazzard (guilty pleasure), Get Smart, Starsky and Hutch, and The Addams Family. Of these, The Addams Family is currently my favorite movie based on a TV show, and considering I never really cared for the show (sorry, but The Munsters were more fun to watch as a TV show) and Get Smart is still one of my favorite TV shows of all time, that's saying a lot.

What makes The Addams Family so much fun is the playful nature of the movie mixed with a lot of dark humor. First time director Barry Sonnenfeld (who went on to direct both Men In Black movies and Get Shorty as well as produce the TV show Pushing Daisies) almost makes this feel as though it could be a more comical Tim Burton film, but still remains faithful to the show with throwing fun facts from the show into the mix. The face of the matter is: this movie is just overall fun to watch more than anything else.

The acting also helps in this case. In my opinion, after The Addams Family Values there can be no future Addams Family movies because Raul Julia is dead, and no on will ever play Gomez the way that I think he should be played. Anjelica Huston has never been more beautiful or played a character as sexy as Morticia. In my opinion, though, and this might be because I first noticed her here, Christina Ricci steals the show as young Wednesday Addams.

The one problem that I have with this film is that it definitely drags in the third act. After the party featuring the Mamushka (I think that's how you spell it, but either way it's the best part of the film) we see the Addams's get evicted from their home. Here we see something inspired with something not so inspired. The Addams kids selling acid/poison laced lemonade is inspired, Gomez being depressed and calling the Sally Jesse Raphael show is slightly funny, but overall dated. Overall, the whole third act has a large part of that feeling of being dated and not as funny as the first two acts.

Overall, I would highly recommend this film. I honestly love this film, and can watch it over and over again from beginning to end. Why should you watch? They're creepy, they're spooky, mysterious, and I have to say they're gloriously ooky! Definitely give this a try.

I saw this movie when I was a little girl and can proudly say even now over 15 years later it is my favorite movie.

You get black humor, sarcasm, but all in a very light way. This people (the addams') and definetely not your next door neighbor *sighs sadly* and will do this unbelivable stuff one will never be able to do, like electrocute your brother, pay absolutely everything with gold dobloons, have a friend (servant, family member ???) with consist of only a bare hand that walks around the house etc. LOL!

All characters were cast PERFECTLY. Both Anjelica Huston and Raul Julia seem to have been born for their roles (such a shame Raul past out without even doing a 3rd sequel).

This is not a tipical comedy movie, nor is it a horror or dramatic movie, however it is always fun to watch both Morticia and Gomez all over the love they have for each other, getting over excited with ""their"" wheel of torture, red hot pokers etc.

And great movie quotes:

""Gomez, last night you were unhinged, you were like some deseperate, howling demon. You frightened me.... Do it again!"" - Morticia Addams

""Don't torture yourself Gomez, that's my job"" - Morticia Addams

""Children what are you doing"" - Morticia Addams
""I'm going to electrecute him"" - Wednesday Addams (for her brother)
""But we're late for charity auction"" - Morticia Addams
""But mother"" - Wednesday Addams
""I said no"" - Morticia Addams
""Pleeeeaseee"" - Pugsley Addams
""Oh all right"" - Morticia Addams

""Look at her, I would die for her, I would kill for her, either way what bliss"" - Gomez Addams (While watching Morticia asleep)

Morticia wakes up...

""Unhappy Darling"" - Gomez Addams
""Oh yes... Yes completely"" - Morticia Addams

Morticia and gomez share such extreme passion over each other, yet it is so carefully introduced on screen that any kid will perfectly be able to watch this move and not understand what all that is about.

Anjelica looks just gorgeous (if you haven't noticed yes I'm in love with the Anjelica Huston Morticia Addams LOL), and so does Raul.

The whole family tries to get Gomez's (Raul Julia) brother Fester back. They've been trying to do this for 25 years, but they got success only this time. Fester (Christopher Lloyd) was brought by Dr. Pinder Schloss (Elizabeth Wilson), who had found him near Bermuda Triangle 25 years ago. But the problem is that he's not Fester, he just wants to get the family's fortune and the doctor is his cruel mother. Morticia (Anjelica Huston) has some doubts about Fester and soon everybody in the family doesn't believe he's Fester. But Doctor convinces them he's not a liar and the sincere family looses their estate. But they're Addamses and they will survive!

As I've already said - casting is fantastic, but Anjelica Huston is the best as seductive Morticia. No one else plays witches better than Anjelica, real Grand High Witch of movie witches.

Gomez Addams is the best role of Raul Julia. And one the last ones of this wonderful actor.

Christopher Lloyd is really funny as Fester and Christina Ricci does her best playing Wednesday.

468952,4,6302409365,"A recent re-run of the Addams Family movies on cable convinced me. They have now wormed their way into my permanent DVD collection. (if you'll pardon the pun.)

Why?  It's one of the few occasions when the modern movie revival of a TV series is actually better than the original.

The casting and performances are exquisite.  The male actors chew the scenery, and they do it wonderfully, especially in the case of Raoul Julia.  But the women steal the show with their--pardon the pun again--deadpan delivery.

Anjelica Huston was born for the role of Morticia--and has since made something of a specialty of macabre women, playing the villainess in Roald Dahl's ""The Witches"", a British kids' film.  And even as a child, Christina Ricci proves that she has creepy down to a fine art.

I was a little disappointed in Lurch, though.  Perfect physical casting, but the actor (whom I suspect doesn't speak English as his native language) was never given the opportunity for Ted Cassidy's notorious double-takes from the TV series.  Or those curious noisdes Lurch made, which were kind of a cross between a groan, a moan, an uh-huh, or a yeah, maybe.  Call me an Addams purist, but never did I hear him say the famous ""Yes, Mr. Addams"".

Thing makes up for it, in part.  Freed from his box, he is the source of sight gags galore.  Though I do kind of miss the cleverness of where Thing popped up in the TV series...

By the way, Ted Cassidy (who played Lurch in the TV series) had such big, gracious hands that he also played Thing.  In scenes where they appeared together, apparently Thing was a hand in.  Gosh, that's the third pun for which I need to apologise...

The original series was a shock to the world of 1960's family sitcoms, full of saccharine kids and sexless married couples.  Every time Gomez uttered ""'Tish, that's French"", middle America was treated to its only taste of genuine televised passion.  And when the outside world threatened to close in, Addams family solidarity closed ranks--real family values.

In the aerobicised, tooth-capped, greed-is-good world of the '90s, when the movie was made, it served the same purpose.  Maybe it still does today.",1139875200,7,2171,4.7640750670241285
468953,5,6302409365,"I must respectfully disagree with the reviewer who disliked the plot. A movie adaptation of a comic or a TV show needs a strong story, and this is a wonderfully strong story: the homecoming of Fester Addams. It illuminates the central Addams theme that, weird though its members may be, this is a close-knit family. It is bold, well made, and clever. Although there are issues of clutter, and one or two unneccessary characters, the basic story is ingenious.",1138492800,2,458,4.810126582278481

468985,4,6302409365,"I still remember the hype leading up to the release of this movie back in the early 1990's.  Can anyone forget that Hammer video that MTV played over and over again?  Enough nostalgia for now.  The movie is of course based on the classic TV show about the comically ghoulish Adams family.  This family of witches, freaks and monsters lives in plain view of the real world oblivious to their own oddness.  In fact they just think everyone else is weird, which is what gives them their sweetness.  The movie centers on long lost Uncle Fester (played lovingly by Christopher Loydd) and his reunion with his estranged brother Gomez (Raul Julia) and his family.  This movie is really entertaining and funny, mainly because of the great cast.  Standing out are Angelica Huston as Morticia, a very young Christina Ricci as Wednesday Adams, but especially the late Raul Julia as suave Gomez Adams.  Despite the (comically) freakish nature of the Adams Family this is a very good family movie that young and old can enjoy togther.",1137888000,,1021,4.788571428571428

I CAN DREAM!

Now the FIRST movie here is not that bad..Mortica look's hot, and all the charachter's are well represented. I just think they left out a lot of stuff that could have made it better!

If you just wanna be entertained but still get a sense of something REAL this is yer ticket..gotta love all the talking of past family member's being ''burned at the stake'' plus it rule's when they show how the other childern picked politician's as their hero's for a school project and Mortica goes ''Did you tell her parent's''LOL..good stuff, she then proceed's to talk of a past relative(Wensdays project) who ''danced naked in the village square and enslaved a priest''

468987,4,6302409365,"One of the few tv to movie adaptations that truly works.  Director Barry Sonnefeld (Men in Black) takes the cult fave tv sitcom and turns it into a gloriously filmed dark comedy.  Anjelica Huston is marvelous as the quietly seductive Morticia and Raul Julia is perfect as the enamored Gomez.  Of course, Christina Ricci steals her scenes as the demonic Wednesday and Jimmy Workman makes a fine Pugsley.  If Christopher Lloyd can't quite match Jackie Coogan's Fester, it's more the script's fault than his.  Elizabeth Wilson is very good as Lloyd's devious mother as is Dana Ivey as the frustrated wife of nogoodnick Dan Hedaya.  I wish they'd have found more use for Vic Mizzy's marvelous tv theme song, instead of MC Hammer's ridiculous rap contribution.

But Barry Sonnenfeld gets it!  And the cast is top-notch.  Christina Ricci is more menacing than words can express.  The late Raul Julia nails the character of Gomez.
Wonderful in its humor and its overall feel, this one is a keeper to enjoy over and over again.",1066435200,7,478,4.459770114942529
469033,5,6302409365,"A near-worthy successor, to be more exact. The 1991 remake of the classic 60's series was taken into the hands of director Barry Sonnenfield (Men In Black films). Sonnenfield's use of computer enhanced effects and tongue-in-cheek, slapstick surrealism contributed to the success of this film, which spawned a sequel, ""Addams Family Values"" and a made for video film.
 The 60's tv show magic is lost in the wake of modern cinema and even the actors, try as they did, could not match the sophisticated humor that John Astin and Carolyn Jones shared- they were the original Gomez and Morticia. But nevertheless, the film is worth watching, if anything for the special effects and performances by Christopher Lloyd as Uncle Fester and Christina Ricci as Wednesday Addams. Noteworthy is also Lurch and Thing, whose dismembered hand is a computer generated illusion.
The plot of the film revolves around Uncle Fester's amnesia. He has returned from the Bermuda Triangle (something which in itself is impossible, says the doubting Christina Ricci's Wednesday) and brought home his mother. His ""mother"" is a villainous woman bent on claiming the Addams Family fortune, their estate. When she has managed to influence Fester, the rest of the Addams are forced out of their home and obligated to work for rent in a slum's apartment. Eventually, the villainous woman is defeated and the Addams reclaim their home, and Uncle Fester regains his memory.
The film has its comic moments, i.e. when Gomez (Raul Julia) is watching day time talk show Sally Jesse Raphael and asks where voodoo witch doctors have their meetings, when Pugsley and Wednesday engage in a play and duel (with fake, splurting blood) and the Halloween party in which all the Addams are invited- a host of grotesque, zombie creatures appear, including the two-headed sisters. Cousin Itt also makes an appearance.
Although Raul Julia and Angelica Houston try to imitate the artistic, witty repartee and passion that John Astin and Carolyn Jones shared, they fail to do so. Raul Julia can pass off for Gomez, especially because he is Latin, but Angelica Houston does not portray a convincing Morticia- cast only because Angelica Houston's has pale, dark, ""witch"" like features. A striking element in the film, besides its cinematography, is its music. The soundtrack, elegant, haunting, romantic, Gothic, which sounds like the same music to the scores of ""Edward Scissorhands"" or ""The Nightmare Before Christmas""- orchestral subtle tones, lush romanticism, tango, etc. An enjoyable film, although what would have been preferable was for the producers of the original tv show (which ran from 1964 to 66), would be to have had John Astin, Carolyn Jones and the rest of the black and white tv show's cast- Ted Cassidy (Lurch) Blossom Rock (Grandmama) Lisa Loring (Wednesday), Ken Weatherwax (Pugsley) and Jackie Coogan (Uncle Fester) to star in a color film directly after the show ended (1966) in an attempt to save the show from a brief syndication. Apparently, this was done in the late 70's, but by then the series had ended years before and a lot of the cast members were quite old.",1046995200,3,3138,5.057915057915058
469034,5,6302409365,"Uncle Fester has been lost for years. The Addams brood has held yearly senaces on the anniversary of his disappearance, in the hopes of divulging his whereabouts. Amidst Lurch's dramatic strains upon the family's organ, Grandmama calls forth the spirit of Fester to commune. With the dramatic knocking, Thing races to the fromt door through the halls of the gloriously gloomy manse, to reveal a drenched Fester, ""Come back from the dead"".
A warm welcome regails him. but with him, an unexpected caller, a ""Dr. Pinderschlaus"".
From here on, a malicious plan unfolds to take over the manse, which has been attempted again, & again, & again.
The actors are perfectly cast, thus necromancing the delightful Addams tale once again to entertain us.
Yet for most of us, the Addams Family Legacy becomes much more than mere stories. Over & over again, I see ""The Addams Mentality"" as remarkably reflective of the Satanic viewpoint.
For instance, the joyful glee in which the Addams deal with the herd; naturally ""dark"" in thought, attracted to that which is arcane & occult. Obviously, the aesthetics are indicative of what many of us are comfortable with.
Even Karla LaVey mentioned on the ""Speak of the Devil"" segment, how the LaVey family was very much like the characterizations portrayed in Addams lore. I concurr. My own Noctuary Chambre is filled with the Satanic Aesthetic ----- skulls, trapezoidal angles, My preference for exotic pets, dim lighting, various diabolical knick-knacks, & even My attraction to women who carry the ""Vampyric"" type. All this, or course, with the additional artifacts of Pentagrams, gargoyle paraphernalia, obscure books, music, & movies. Mostly Satanic, &/or ""Gothic"" in content or appearance. Unto My style of dress, which happens to be mostly black, with some jewelry displaying various skulls, snakes, bats, dragons, spiders, & wolves. It is a natural gravitation. I just see something I like, & I include it in My diabolically Draconian collection. Even the pen with which I Am writing this review / essay is cast in the images of twisting serpants!
And so Our lairs come to resemble a scene out of the Addams Family, or Dracula, or sometimes even Beetlejuice ----- or, these portrayals come to resemble our Lairs. Could it be that Charles Addams expressed his own Jungian ""Shadowside"" proclivities? Indeed, he has stated that the characters are products of a degree of exaggeration based upon his own family's traits. Although societal ""norms"" may have stifled full expression. Personally, I hold the belief that being a Satanist is genetic.
The Addams Family tales are frought with decorous imagination & artistic expression.
I say, aesthetically speaking, let all Hell break loose! Repress not what is natural, in Our own lairs & total environments, yet employ wisdom & appropriation, so as to survive, indulge, & excel.",1044057600,,2857,5.119914346895075

469036,3,6302409365,"The Addams Family begins with a hearty chuckle, as a group of nauseatingly cheery carol singers are treated to a dose of Addams hospitality.  The film is of course a 1990s revamp of the 1960s television series with the catchy refrain: ""They're creepy and they're kooky, mysterious and spooky, they're altogether ooky.""  However, the film lacks the delicate balance between finesse and crudity that marked the original; perhaps this is the result when a cult show is turned into movie fodder for the masses.
The Addams' live in a decaying mansion that boasts such attractions as a graveyard, a swamp and a vault full of money.  It is this last which attracts the attention of a crooked accountant and his unscrupulous client Mrs. Craven.  Their plan is to install Mrs. Craven's son Gordon in the house as 'long-lost' Uncle Fester Addams, with the purpose of gaining access to the vault.  Initially Gordon is all for this plan, but once he gets to know and like the family, he undergoes a crisis of confidence and must decide where his loyalties lie.
The plot may be depressingly formulaic, but fortunately it is in the Addams' nature to be quirky.  The humour is generally quite fresh and clever - who would have picked the villain's ultra-conventional wife pairing off with hirsute (and definitely unconventional) Cousin Itt?  But along with the hits, there are some equally spectacular misses, including almost everything involving Grandma Addams.  The other female Addams' are excellent, especially young Christina Ricci as the perpetually sullen Wednesday.  Ultimately though, you have to wonder if the mysterious and macabre charm of the Addams has lost something in its modernisation, and if perhaps they should have been left to rest in peace.",1035244800,3,1749,5.045138888888889

Gomez(Raul Julia) and Moricia(Anjelica Huston) Addams are not your typical people next door. They do, however have an extended family to make them somewhat like a typical modern family. Daughter  Wednesday(Christina Ricci), son Pugsley(Jimmy Workman), Grandma(Judith Malina) and Lurch, the butler(Carel Struycken) help fill the hideous family mansion with life and after-life.

Using deciet and trechary, the son masquerades as Uncle Festor, Gomez's long lost brother. The schemes they hatch and the obsticales they encounter make for interest and entertainment. The family home is well worth a look. It is filled with props and devices that are a perfect compliment to this unsual family. The characters are protrayed with such skill, it makes them perfectly believable. In fact is is hard at times to tell who the main characters are for the entire cast moves in and out of the spot light to first take the lead than support each other as the story unflolds.

Not continuing the original metaphors these characters played would be a dissapointment. The most recent TV series flopped because they failed to capture the character of the family. In the most recent TV series, Gomez was made into a bungling idiot and so was everyone else, but Tim Burton's version made Gomez the a man of the world, a careless aristocrat and a charming debonaire, sort of a dark version of Red Butler from Gone with the Wind, Morticia, the mysterious seductress, a classier version of Elvira. Wendy was the silent misunderstood psycho, and pugsley, the simplistic sadist who always gets outwitted by his deep and sinister sister. Lurch plays the ever faithful and dutiful butler and the architecture and the richness of the Victorian house they lived in was a character in the movie in itself. My suggestion is to buy the movie not just for its entertainment value but also for the amount of depth and vision the director put into creating this masterpiece. A good comparison would be the superman movie. Christopher Reeve played the best superman and after him, no one could live up to it anymore.

469101,3,6302409365,"If you ignore the story of ""The Addams Family,"" then what you've got is a sumptuous recreation of one of the best television shows of all time. I, myself, have only seen a very few episodes of the original television series, but even that is enough to be able to realize that the movie captures beautifully the characters of the show, both in appearance and mannerisms. The overall appearance and atmosphere in which the family lives is well-rendered as well. The story does leave something to be desired, but the movie makes up for that with everything else.
The Addams' find themselves cast into a web of despair when Gomez's long-lost brother, Fester, returns after believed to be lost to the Bermuda Triangle. He carries his surrogate mother, Dr. Pinder Schloss, along for the ride, but there is more to them than meets the eye: they are planning to take over the mansion and raid the treasure hidden within the house. Fester begins to find himself drawn to the extremely unconventional lifestyle the family leads, but the stress put upon him by Pinder Schloss to carry out his original objective causes discord among the family, as well as raised suspicions in Morticia, the lady of the house, and young daughter Wednesday.
Everyone knows the Addams family are unlike anyone on this earth, finding delight in the darker sides of life. The movie comically plays out these rather dangerous sides of life, adding comments of sarcasm to events and occurrences which would otherwise prove too risqu for an audience. At one point, Morticia discovers a vile of cyanide in Fester's suitcase, turns to him and says, ""Fester, as if we'd run out."" For some reason, this subtle humor seems to soften the impact of such circumstances, while adding a flare of wit and humor to the dialogue.
The cast seems to have been destined for their roles, flawlessly recapturing the essence of each character. Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston take on the roles of Gomez and Morticia, the mother and father of the clan who cannot seem to keep their hands off one another. Julia's swarthy looks, along with his slick hair and pencil moustache, make him the perfect casting choice, while Huston captures the subtlety and calm pace of her character, who knows more than she admits. Christina Ricci and Jimmy Workman play the children, Wednesday and Pugsley, Ricci's dark demeanor and meek voice adding to the creepiness of her character, while Workman's pudgy stance and naivety makes his character convincing. Fester is played by Christopher Lloyd, in a role he was born to play. His bald head and corpse-like appearance fit his name to a T.
The story for the movie is a bit trying at times, slipping into periods of boredom. But ignoring this fault, it does give way to a lot of one-liners and moments of sheer comedic delight. At one point, the family is forced to move out and settle into the real world: Morticia goes out looking for a job as a daycare teacher, while Wednesday and Pugsley open up a lemonade stand. This contrast provides some of the movie's funniest dialogue: a Girl Scout offers to buy a glass of lemonade (""Is this juice made from real lemons?"") in return for their purchase of a box of Girl Scout cookies, to which Wednesday replies, ""Are they made from real Girl Scouts?""
The house is also an important piece in the film, practically a character itself. The production design team gives the house a dark and moldy appearance, with peeling walls and dead vegetation surrounding the estate. There is an equally disturbing graveyard whose tombstones reflect the noises of their inhabitants when passed by. Still, there is a certain degree of elegance to the decay, as well as a maze of sheer funhouse madness once Fester finds his way to the vault housing the treasure.
In short, ""The Addams Family"" lacks an intriguing story, and one could go so far as to say that the story merely serves as an outlet for the jokes and gags. Still, there's no denying that it's a funny film, with a lot of good elements working for it. The cast brings the characters to life in a fresh and inviting way, while the sets are a whirlwind of hilarity and bewilderment.

469103,3,6302409365,"Plot mechanics muddle everything in this so-so big screen version of the entertaining 60's t.v. show based on the famous New Yorker cartoons. The screenwriters have altered the original family and given us a rather ordinary predictable plot that involves an Uncle Fester imposter (Christopher Lloyd) which alters the chemistry of the well-known family.  It's called fixing something that wasn't broken.  They spend too much time setting up and positioning the characters.
The casting is quite good, and there are some funny moments and extremely inventive camera-work, but the script isn't sharp enough and instead of being dark, campy and clever, it's often strained and stupid.
Tops are the perfectly cast Angelica Huston, and Christini Ricci with Raul Julia being an acceptable Gomez.
The sequel Addams Family Value is much better.
