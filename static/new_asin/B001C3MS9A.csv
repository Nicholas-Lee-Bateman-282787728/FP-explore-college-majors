8285747,3,B001C3MS9A,"The first part of this series has wonderful subtitles so that it is easy to enjoy this comedy drama--it is totally enjoyable to watch with others. However, the last part has horrible subtitles that make absolutely no sense. Even the names of the Japanese characters have been translated into Chinese names that seem to have been haphazardly chosen--it is kind of unbelievable how bad the subtitles are.
When I lent my copy to my friend I warned her about the subtitles, but she though I was exagerating until she watched it with her son, luckily her son understands Japanese and was able to translate for her....
If the subtitles were of the same quality throughout the dvds, I'd say buy it in a minute--you'd enjoy it. But the crummy subtitles towards the end are so frustrating I'd think twice before recommending this terrific series.
For some reason a lot of the Japanese dramas w/english subtitles seem to switch translators during the last half of the dvds to, what perhaps are native Chinese speaking--the names Kimura-san suddenly become Xieng or whatever...., translators that don't have a grasp of English for sure, and perhaps Japanese also.
I think a little pre-screening is to look for dvds that have English and Chinese subtitles--those seem to have the lousy and incomprehensive English subtitles (and they also start with the good English subtitles before the bad subtitling kicks in for the last half...)",1280793600,3,1421,4.974789915966387
8285748,4,B001C3MS9A,"It is a full single season drama of contempory Japan and three 40 year old woman, their
attitudes towards being single, recently married and married several years.  A clash of
tradition, vs identity.  The english translation is good and easy to follow the story line.  The accuracy of the english translation changes in later chapters and becomes a
little difficult to understand.

I would not take the program as being serious or accurate of current Japanese culture, just a light comedy drama.",1254787200,2,495,5.0
