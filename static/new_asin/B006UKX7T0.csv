5020037,4,B006UKX7T0,This gift is for my husband who adored Ernie Kovacs and when he sees this DVD I hope he responds to it as he did when he used to watch him.,1355270400,,139,3.5161290322580645
5020038,5,B006UKX7T0,"The name Ernie Kovacs today may not resonate with many TV watchers not around in the late 1950's, but this master comedian's innovations in comedy are still being used today in many programs and many viewers don't even know it. Some were so far ahead of their time that only now we see some of them being used. Ernie was a staple on TV from 1950 on, but these classic specials, the last he produced before his tragic car accident in 1959 that took his life, display his great wit, timing, and more. And who can forget his classic cigar commercials (which couldn't be viewed on TV today) and his love for all eras of music, which he used creatively in every program he did. Do yourself a favor and get this set.......you won't regret it!",1352592000,3,736,4.419117647058823
5020039,1,B006UKX7T0,"Five stars for the material, but this is just a repackaging of one of the DVDs from the Ernie Kovacs Collection. If you love early T.V., and appreciate comic genius, buy the box set. The seeds for Laugh-In, David Letterman, and free-wheeling surreal comedic video were sewn by Ernie.
I also recommend the biography by Diana Rico, Kovacsland. Read it during the same time period you watch the DVDs, and get a deep, real understanding of the revolutionary and visionary Ernie Kovacs.",1344297600,20,481,4.878048780487805
5020040,5,B006UKX7T0,"Ernie Kovacs. A lot has been written about him but to really experience Ernie Kovacs humor you must see his video work. NOTHING in tv comedy today compares to the comic genius this man truly was. Humor that is somewhat surrealistic at times. This DVD captures Kovacs at his VERY best. The quality is great. I thought I was gonna die laughing at the great collection of Dutch Masters cigars commercials with Kovacs. Comedy fans of ALL ages,BUY THIS DVD !!!!!",1338508800,2,457,4.654320987654321
5020041,5,B006UKX7T0,"As in Shout Factory's Ernie Kovacs box, this collection features only the last five of Kovacs' eight half-hour monthly specials for ABC. Assuming the company withheld these initial 1961 episodes for some future project, I'm baffled as to why they weren't included in this single-disc release.

UPDATE 12/13/2013: Apparently rights to the first three Kovacs ABC-TV Specials are not controlled by Ediad Productions, which explains why they're missing from this DVD and Shout Factory's more extensive Kovacs collections.",1328227200,12,517,5.628205128205129
5020042,5,B006UKX7T0,"This series of eight half-hour specials from 1961-1962 are essential viewing. There's no other way of putting it. The nice folks at Amazon.com will only allow me to rate it a maximum of five stars. I would give it ten if I could.

In the early 1950s an article was written called, ""Kovacs Hates TV"". This doesn't surprise me in the least. Radicals are seldom satisfied with things as they are - and Ernie was about as radical as they come. He changed everything. At a time when no one knew what to do with the new invention of videotape, Ernie Kovacs made it sing and dance. He was no mere, run-of-the-mill, fifties television comedian. He was in fact the world's very first video artist - incredible when you consider the fact that the term ""video art"" did not come into existence until 1966, four years after his passing. Even now, despite a half-century of video's technological evolution, Ernie's work still astounds.

Late on the rainy night of January 13, 1962, Ernie Kovacs was returning home from a party when he lost control of the Corvair station wagon he was driving and crashed it, wrapping the driver's side of the vehicle around the concrete base of a utility pole. He was killed instantly. Ten days later, on what would have been his forty-third birthday, ABC Television aired Ernie's last program which he had been working on right up until the night he died. Of the entire series of monthly half-hour specials he had been doing in the last year of his life, this final program was one of the best. At the end of the broadcast, the reverend who presided over Ernie's funeral was quoted:

""We loved this man. He brought joy, gaiety and laughter to the world. He was a rugged individualist and a creative genius. But he was always ready to listen, and slow to judge.""

Ernie Kovacs was a visionary. He was the first to realize that great art could be created within the nineteen-inch confines of an ugly box with a glass tube at its center. Unfortunately for humanity, he's gone and he's not coming back. Thank God for Edie Adams. Because she had the foresight to save her husband's work, we now have these kinescopes and videotapes to gently remind us what once was. Ernie's world was a delightful, wondrous and riotous place to enter. Someone once remarked, ""In an ocean of noise, this island of quiet genius was typical of Ernie Kovacs."" Indeed it was.

Early in his career, he would close his programs by telling the audience at home, ""It's been real!"", a phrase he coined. He was a bit of a paradox in that respect. Ernie Kovacs was the real deal alright - and television's first surrealist. Go figure.

8504574,3,B006UKX7T0,Actually I remember a different talent of Ernie Kovacs...this is a bit disappointing. Felt almost that the advertiser somehow coerced Ernice to do this schtick. I don't see it as his best work...despite the use of camera technique.,1438646400,,231,5.105263157894737
8504575,3,B006UKX7T0,Ernie Kovacs was before my time but my Mother used to rave about his shows and how modernistic he was for the times.  I got this for her for Christmas and I tried to watch it and it was just too weird for me.  I've seen some of his shows before and couldn't sit through them.

8504579,4,B006UKX7T0,"I so wanted this to be a five-star review. I remember watching the original Ernie Kovacs broadcasts only to find the same humor and visuals he originated rerun by less creative minds for decades. Ernie Kovacs was more than a brilliant entertainer he was curious about what this new thing called television could be made to do.

Sid Caesar would arrive on national television at about the same time circa 1950. In time Sid Caesar would amass one of the most amazing comedy writing teams before or since. Okay there really was no before. Besides his own comedic skills said Caesar would have the likes of Imogene Coca Neil Simon, Woody Allen and Carl Reiner plus he had the ability to draw many of the top performing acts and stars of his time. Ernie Kovacs had a small resident comedic team and a willingness to take huge risks.

Among his many invented semi regular characters was Eugene. Eugene sketches were one half hour without talking and a few sound effects. One of these half hours is included on this disc. Imagine no talking. It is almost impossible to imagine a more outrageous indeed anti-television sketch. One of Ernie Kovacs' regular bita was a series of short visual jokes strung together between bursts of a German (?) rendition of Mac the knife song into an oscillator. That is to say Ernie Kovacs believed his audience was intelligent and sophisticated. A particular visual joke was based around the concept of books that produced sounds appropriate to the content of that book. You need not know War and Peace to expect a book with that name to produce cannon fire. Not many could be expected to understand why a book named Camille should produce female coughing sounds. For myself, the sketches built around his Nairobi Trio remains some of my favorite television gags. Others prefer his lady in the bathtub jokes and that is the visual most often reproduced by later television video comedians.

Ultimately I believe Ernie to be more of the television artist and if not intentionally more of an elitist. It is for this reason that I think Sid Caesar would be the more appreciated comedian to an audience not bound to earliest memories. And so my reason for only four stars is that I'm not sure that a modern audience will have the patience for these specials.

These specials - the disc is clearly labeled disk number five. It launches under the name disk 5. What the producers of this DVD, Shout, have done is to pull this disc out of a larger set to sell it separately. This leaves one with a sense of being ripped off at the expense of the company that has typically done better at bringing back old television shows. On the subject of reproduction there are a few sound echoes on this disc. Most likely given the primitive state of television recording in late 50s and 60s when these specials broadcast, the errors are from the originals. Given Shout's misjudgments in packaging and labeling this disk, I'm not convinced that the audio errors are from the originals.

I am an Ernie Kovacs fan and will probably collect more discs. Unless you have a similar interest in how ""they used to make them""; this may be the kind of disk you rent for a single viewing rather than one you will deliberately collect.",1374019200,7,3229,4.6678383128295255
8504580,4,B006UKX7T0,Great product as far as it went.  Nowhere in the product literature did it tell us that this was the fifth disc of five for this series.  So now we can't find discs 1-4 but the one we have is superb,1356566400,,198,3.8048780487804876
