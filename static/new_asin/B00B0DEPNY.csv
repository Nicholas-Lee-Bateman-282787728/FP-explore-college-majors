8560257,5,B00B0DEPNY,"""The PUTTING PERFECTION DVD is terrific!  Maria and Jay took a most important area for improved golf and broke it down into a great progression:  set-up, aim, path, centered contact, and speed/distance control.  They do all of this while still emphasizing the important student-centered, individual, and non-method style of teaching this important skill.  Well done...this will be an effective learning and training tool for golfers of all levels.  Nice job by two great pros!""

8560258,5,B00B0DEPNY,"Maria Palozola - a Top 50 Golf Instructor - and Jay Delsing - a PGA Tour Veteran - have created an excellent focused Putting Instruction DVD.  It has two main sections: one  on Basics - 5 Areas for Putting Improvement, and a Bonus Section where Jay provides additional insights on Putting Improvement.  The Basics section is about 35 minutes long, so golfers can easily review this information from time to time to remind themselves of the key improvement areas.  There is information in this DVD that will help golfers of all levels to improve their putting and make more putts.  The information presented is easy to understand and absorb.  A winner!",1359417600,,651,4.81981981981982
