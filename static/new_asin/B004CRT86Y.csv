4328994,5,B004CRT86Y,"I got this DVD not knowing exactly what to expect, but after watching it I can say I wasn't disappointed. Being a beginner, I found it to be informative. It covers a lot of ground in a short time and it's easy to watch. The video does what it says; it covers the basics. I'd like to learn some more advanced techniques, so hopefully this guy will make some more videos.",1324771200,,369,4.211267605633803
4328995,1,B004CRT86Y,"Poor video, very short only 26 minutes, no real tips and techniques and certainly not worth the $60.00. Too bad the previous posters did not give a honest apprasial of the video. DO NOT BUY.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Backhoe-Basics/dp/B004CRT86Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Backhoe Basics</a>",1320019200,,340,7.743589743589744
4328996,5,B004CRT86Y,This video is a great introduction to operating this machine. I definitely learned some things I didn't know before and that I will use in the future!,1299369600,2,150,4.592592592592593
4328997,5,B004CRT86Y,"I got this video because I needed to rent a Backhoe to do some work on my property, and I was pretty unfamiliar with how to use one. This DVD was full of great information and it was actually pretty fun to watch. Watching a video is obviously no substitute for hands on practice, but in the end I saved myself a lot of hassle by watching this.",1296518400,,343,4.0588235294117645
4328998,5,B004CRT86Y,"After lots of research online I bought this video and was happy with the great tips it gave me. I especially liked the PIP part of the video where it shows the hand controls and the foot controls working at the same time. You can really get the idea how to operate the controls that way. I would highly recomend this video, it is worth the money.",1296000000,,346,4.17910447761194
8423576,3,B004CRT86Y,Kind of a dissapointment. Not of much use to me.,1480464000,,48,3.9
8423577,3,B004CRT86Y,"Bottom line this book is definitely properly titled.  I was expecting a little more meat and potatoes and dialogue instead of just on screen power point presentation interspersed with some video and cheesy music.  A lot of the information is no brainer, but it is definitely a movie about backhoe basics.",1472515200,,304,4.9411764705882355

8423581,4,B004CRT86Y,"Well, maybe not quite. When I rented the video I was curious what a ""Backhoe For Beginners"" video would look like. I guess that this is it. I could complain as others have done but really, what's the purpose? To expose someone to the backhoe for the first time this is about as good as it gets. Covers the basics and rudimentary operation. So, now lets get real. I can tell someone how to fly a plane in about ten minutes- from preflight to chocking the wheels. Would you fly with a pilot trained this way? Hell no! With the possible exception of the 911 hijackers who leveled the World Trade Center buildings no one learns to fly a plane this way. It's the same with a backhoe. Practice makes perfect and nowhere does this ring truer than operating a backhoe. Don't get the video and rent a backhoe expecting to be an expert in thirty minutes. Overall, not a bad ""gee whiz"" first look at the backhoe.",1401753600,2,901,4.369047619047619
8423582,3,B004CRT86Y,"Wish had more tips, way to operate less time on greasing video but for a start it is fair to good",1377043200,,97,3.6666666666666665
8423583,3,B004CRT86Y,"I found the information helpful as far as gaining an basic understanding of the aparatus. There are very few DVD`S on the market at this affordable price that even touch on the subject of excavating. I tip my hat to the producer  and encourage him to continue to build on this subject.  Adding some differant pieces of equipment would enhance this tutorial greatly. It would be very helpful  to see more detailed  techniques...i.e. digging an pond,benching and trenching and such.",1372550400,,480,4.9625
8423584,3,B004CRT86Y,I expected more information about operating the backhoe.  It's has good information for the beginner.  But if you have a backhoe you probably already know most of the information contained in this video.,1371168000,,203,5.121212121212121
8423585,5,B004CRT86Y,"It's really hard to believe you'd actually be turned loose on a backhoe with no experience, but that's the situation I found myself in recently.

Thais is a lot of machine when you have limited knowledge of how to use it. Almost as bad a having access to a dental drill with no training! In fact I can do a lot more damage with the backhoe near my house than I could with a dental drill. People are too smart to let me near!

I rented the video and watched it several time while taking notes.

I still had a lot of hands on learning to do, but now I know what I'm trying to do and that makes it a lot easier.

I did manage to learn to use the backhoe enough to accomplish my limited goals of digging out tree and bushes. I did manage to remove some of them close to my house, but would never work around gas or electrical lines.

Very nice video covering the basics of backhoe use.",1335657600,,881,4.040229885057471
