1696938,4,B0000640VK,"From the music, to the accents, to the absolutely beautiful cinematography, this movie had me travelling to Newfoundland from the moment the characters drove toward it.

Kevin Spacey had very little to work with in a character that was written so very internally, and he brought what little light there was to Quoyle right out through his eyes.  The man is the king of the smouldering look, and Moore plays her role with a quiet reserve that likewise is carried mostly by gesture, stance, and expression.  This is not a verbal movie, not an audio experience in the slightest: this is a visual experience, where body language usually matters much more than not.

Sets, weather, and the ever-present character of the Ocean itself all stir together in this movie.  With fade-ins and flashbacks of skill woven into a theme of regeneration and restoration, there is a thread of humour and kindness to this movie that had more than one person in the audience sniffly, myself included.

The daughter had a real screen presence, and is a child actress with skill I think we'll be seeing more often.  If the movie itself has any failings, it's that it tried to stay as wide as the novel, and as such, some minor plotlines got nearly no screen time, where they might have been better removed, allowing more time for more central characters (especially that of Aunt Agnis, played by Judi Dench to perfection).

I highly reccommend the movie, most centrally for its beautiful visual scenery, and gentle handling of nonverbal language to portray the emotions involved.  The cast of characters managed a story that wasn't spoken, and the impact wasn't lost at all.  Newfoundland has never looked so wonderful on the silver screen.

1696939,5,B0000640VK,"A struggling newspaper writer, Quoyle returns to the small fishing town in newfoundland his family has long lived in, after their mother, petal bear, ran off with her daughter and sold her. Though he's had little success thus far in life, his shipping news column finds an audience, and his experiences in the town change his life.
""The Shipping News"" is really a masterpiece. O.K.,this word is overused and Lasse Hallstrom's previous movies weren't that great(just my opinion),but this guy does a marvellous job here. From story-telling to cinematography everthing is  perfect. I also thought that the screenplay by Jacobs did justice to Proulx' book,although I would have liked to see some more of Agnis and Bunny. The acting... Call me crazy,but I think this is the best cast since Godfather Part 2!Spacey,Moore,Blanchett and Dench show why they're considered as acting heavyweights. And because this ain't just a drama[it has comedy and mystery elements in it],I think this film is appealing to everyone with interest in entertaiment and film-making.",1007337600,2,1054,5.236686390532545

1696953,5,B0000640VK,This is an interesting movie. It takes you to a place you've never been. Kevin Spacey and the rest are excellent in this movie. The last five minutes are worth the trip.

1696992,2,B0000640VK,The 'Pulitzer Prize' was possibly stretching a bit to award this writing. Lots of passages where I was reading a lady writer trying to be Hemingway-esque. The book starts with abrasive relationships and goes downward from there. Skip the book and watch Kevin act out the masochistic role of a deeply depressed cuckold in the movie. He does an epic performance.,1483228800,,360,4.918032786885246

I decided too leave it on for a little while longer because that was easier than finding something else to watch. I am glad that I did. The performances of the actors were very good and there are quite a few A list actors. The story starts to lighten up and there is that light at the end of the tunnel.

Proulx's characters are as such here, too. Not sure the gal knows what she's writing about -- just ""supposes"" it's how it would be.

Hallstrom's made a very gorgeous-looking film. I think Spacey's wrongly cast here. He can't believably pull off the simpleton hero. Dench, Julianne and Cate are great.

1697367,2,B0000640VK,"As a fan of the book on which this film is based, I started watching it with a certain anticipation.  It had been a few years since I read the book.  But early on, the film bogged down.  The director seems to have missed the essential quality of the book, which is, that the reader cares about, and feels invested in, the characters.  In this film, from the get-go, the characters are presented as pathetic, unattractive, and it was impossible to feel sympathetic towards them.

I don't quite understand by what alchemy they turned such a lovely book into an unlovely and unappealing film, but there you have it.  I couldn't continue watching and gave up after perhaps 15 minutes.  No one could imagine themselves being those foolish stooges.  In the book, they weren't stooges used by others.  Instead, they were just like everyone, struggling along with life's many difficulties.",1474243200,,881,4.82

Julianne Moore was on top of her craft, one of her best, Blanchett was amazingly nearly unrecognizable, so we'll played. Dench was the milieu and the glue and rescued this meandering movie many times with her solid character portrayal.

1698619,4,B0000640VK,I read the book many years ago and remembered I really liked the book. The actors I thought played all their roles well. I didn't even recognize Cate Blanchett.

This time the movie lagged behind in that it wasn't as gritty and raw and desperate as the story was and the same can be said of the characters in the book.  I liked almost every one of the people in the movie and I didn't have to work at it.  They were nice.  They didn't have such appalling situations and lives. With all that said, the movie was very good and the events followed the book nicely.",1468972800,,468,4.010752688172043

1698636,5,B0000640VK,I chose this movie because it was available (*for free*) on Prime and because it had a cast of some very recognizable actors.  I didn't know what to expect since I had never heard of the movie and had read no reviews of it.  It started out a bit slow and I was feeling somewhat cautious but soon the pace kicked up when the protagonist and his daughter became swept up in family drama stretching back generations.  Very enjoyable and I will remember it for a long time.  I am a big fan of Julianne Moore and found her performance to be understated but rock solid.  She is a gem.  Kevin Spacey is always a winner.  Judi Dench? How does one describe a master?,1468886400,2,657,4.25

1699247,2,B0000640VK,"One amazon reviewer wrote of this movie,   if you read the novel by Annie Proulx, you'll probably be disappointed with the film.  Reading the novel is apparently not a requirement for being disappointed with this film.  Theres little joy in writing a bad review, and this reviewer writes so few of them.  Its just that one expects that a film with this brilliant cast, and based on such a successful book, couldn't possibly go wrong.  But the expectation goes sorely unmet.  A very prolific amazon reviewer put it into words that are so on-point, they're worth repeating.  You'd think a story that includes [so many sobering topics]  might actually raise your pulse. But Robert Nelson Jacobs' screenplay is so resolutely inoffensive, and Lasse Hallstrom's direction so fatally cautious, that the film struggles to hold your attention  as it skips playfully over all that nasty stuff in hot pursuit of a fairytale ending.  The film-makers may have pulled together an impressive collection of film components, but they cannot hide an empty core.  You can't have light without darkness, you can't have growth without pain - and this film just doesn't have the nerve to go anywhere near either of them.  The story is about recovery from trauma, including the transformational pain thats involved.  But the message isn't a particularly new one, leaving the film-makers with the responsibility of imparting to the audience compelling emotions--emotions that go beyond the message and that, for many people, are a necessary part of learning the idea behind the message.  It's clear that quite a few amazon reviewers feel otherwise, but the superficial dialogue, the awkward performances, and (most importantly) the anemic recounting of the traumas in the pasts of these people, left this viewer feeling flat  and bored.

1699414,4,B0000640VK,"There are certain aspects of Shipping News which strike me as shocking.  That said, I've thoroughly enjoyed pictures featuring Judi Dench and Kate Blanchett sometimes.  One thing the preview description doesn't mention is the death of our protagonist's despicable father.  We are not forewarned what a malevolent creature he was in life.  So when his sister (played by Judi Dench) subtly exchanges his ashes from the urn with some generic soot and later disposes of them, in an out house, the smug look on her face as she says 'welcome home' is like the proverbial tip of the ice berg on the Titanic.

The screen play sweeps us immediately into the action with a short turbulent mini-biography depicting how our prospective reporter (Quoyle) falls in love with a high-strung prostitute (Cate Blanchett) named Petal.  The analogy to a train-wreck when she sells their little girl to an adoption agency and winds up fataly driving off of a bridge with one of her lovers, is a precursor to her later appearance as a ghost, only by then the malice has already spent itself.  And in this collage of incredibly damaged individuals, she was his first genuine love interest.  Oddly, amidst extreme distress our psyche clings hardest to the memory of love, however brief.

This isn't inactive drama.  It's got sex and fights and deaths and guts, and when a new love interest surfaces for our now single parent, he struggles to overcome foot-in-mouth syndrome, blithely unaware that she too has a conflicted past.  I'm only mentioning it because out of the blue, while he's attending a party for a co-worker and getting smashed, another party guest just blurts out that his new girl friend's ex-husband isn't really dead, he just nailed most of the women in town, and split -- leaving his wife and little boy, and her pretending to be a widow.  It's a real head game, because it's a running joke in this small town to speculate whether this kid or that one was really his.  And this all slips by so fast before you're even certain who they were talking about, our budding journalist is staggering into her house demanding to know when she was going to tell him she was still hooked-up to another guy.  (Appropriately laced with colorful expletives of course).  And anything but boring.",1424217600,3,2275,4.812339331619537

1699459,4,B0000640VK,"The Shipping News is a drama based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by E. Annie Proulx.

Quoyle is a struggling, emotionally drained newspaper reporter suffering through a wretched marriage with the abusive Petal, a promiscuous wild woman who tries to sell their daughter, Bunny, into adoption before she's killed in a car wreck. Retrieving his daughter, Quoyle sets out for Newfoundland, his ancestral home, with his long-lost Aunt Agnis. Although he initially finds life on the island to be as forbidding and severe as Agnis herself, Quoyle gets work as a shipping columnist for the local newspaper ""The Gammy Bird,"" owned by eccentric fisherman Jack Buggit. Quoyle's work soon finds an appreciative audience and he begins to rebuild his life, dating local single mother Wavey, learning some sea craft, discovering his family's dark history, and finally earning some self-respect. Agnis, in the meantime, starts her own successful business and faces a traumatic incident from her childhood involving Quoyle's late father.

Though solidly made and acted,the movie is rather heavy-handed and dull, especially given the nature of its protagonist brilliantly shows Quoyle's transformation from a passive clod to a curious journalist. Kevin Spacey and Julianne Moore astound in touching, well- told tale of rebirth and redemption. On the other hand,it maybe considered modest but true feeling for the ways in which people are formed by the ravages of their natural surroundings can definitely touch the viewer and should be considered an excellent film despite its obvious flaw of awkwardness.",1418947200,,1593,5.393574297188755

1699555,5,B0000640VK,"""Shipping News"" is one of those rare movies that engages its audience on nearly every level; intellectually and emotionally it grabs hold of you early on and doesn't let go until the credits roll at the end. Kevin Spacey inhabits his role so naturally that you forget he's the same actor who starred in ""Beyond the Sea"" or any other flick, for that matter.  Likewise, Julianne Moore couldn't be more suited for her role in this film.  A stellar supporting cast rounds out this emotional symphony and not a single bad note is struck from overture to curtain.

1699556,2,B0000640VK,"The 2 star reviews mostly like the book better. Well, my goodness, how about let's review the film. And it is silly, foolish, bombastic, and so overwhelmingly full of every detail I hate about contemporary film that it almost made me laugh aloud. Obviously, this carefully focus group tested schmaltz has lots of focus group members who enjoyed its approved parade of cliches and feel good pablum. But I wasn't one of them.

Kevin Spacey....well, as the protagonist in several films I despise, American Beauty, and The Life of David Gale being chief among them, I should have expected a self-righteous, smirky film. But he topped himself in this one. Creepy and shallow, his Quoyle gives his life devotedly to a stupid, selfish, ghastly woman who ****s him within minutes of meeting his mentally deficient self. Not surprisingly, bored with the tedium of a slightly dim puppy worship, that wife moves on and gets hers. Serves her right. And mighty convenient.

And then Quoyle, untrained and barely coherent when speaking, grows into a reporter when someone pats him on the back says, ""I believe in you."" What does that say about newspapers? A middle-aged guy with an 85 IQ can triumph in that profession when handed an I-B-M computer? And, of course, in a remote town of about 400 people, with a newspaper successful enough to employ four full time employees, the only single woman with a child and the newcomer single man with a child must achieve love together and overcome all obstacles. yeah, yeah, yeah...never seen THAT before.

The dark secrets came tumbling out like a Hardy Boys story....oh my, could there be any more skeletons in the Quoyle closet?

And the accents? Yikes--these actors are from all over and the fake and forced Canadian accents were jarring. (With the exception of Gordon Pinsent--wonderful in Red Green, pretty darn convincing here.) I could go on, but since it will only get me unhelpful votes for disliking this gibberish, this is enough. But sorry, this film is dumb.",1391299200,2,2001,4.893805309734513
1699557,5,B0000640VK,"Sort of redemption for the common man.  Kevin Spacey does a great job as an earnest underachiever who has been handed a life full of crap.  Cate Blanchett is wonderful as his despicable first wife who gets exactly what she deserves, but leaves him more bereft than before (it that were possible).  Enter Judi Dench, suffering the same sort of life, but making the best of it.

We first visited Newfoundland in 2005. Then my husband decided we needed to buy a house up there and found one for less than the price of a used SUV. He had me go up, scope it out and we bought it. It is then that I became familiar with the hearty Newfies and the wonderful land thereof. The people are portrayed well in this movie.

The last time I visited I picked up The Shipping News book at a local book store. At the airport I started reading it and laughing out loud. The characters in the book were just like the people I had left in the town of Trepassey, where our house is located. When I found out it was a movie, I couldn't wait to watch it.

I was not disappointed. The only change from the book is that Quoyle does not have two kids, and while that bothered me for a bit, I got over it and now don't think about it when I watch the movie. If you loved the book, you will love this movie. I promise!",1388620800,,1168,3.940677966101695

Learning the ways of the people and the ways of the sea grounds him at last. Dench's bitter character and the brutal environment open a path for him to ""man up"" and become a real person and father. The harshness of Newfoundland and the sea wrap around Quoyle and ignite his soul, bringing him to life in a manner that is haunting and intriguing.

Kevin Spacey plays Quoyle, a meek, wounded man from Poughkeepsie. He has always failed at whatever he  does, according to his father and his wife.  He meets his wife appeal, played by Cate Blanchett, at a gas station, as she argues with her present boy friend and jumps in Quole's car. Petal knows a mark when she sees one. She and Quole get pregnant, she has a girl named Bunny. Quole takes care if the baby while Petal carries on her affairs, under his roof!  Time takes care of Petal and then Quole's parents die. His unknown to him, Aunt Agnis, played by Dame JudimDench,comes to pay respects.

Aunt Agnis convinces Quole to move to their old homestead in Newfoundland. This house is so decrepit and open to the weather that only in the movies could it be made into a home. Quoyle gets a job on the local paper, where arguments go on and on about sailing vessels vs. oil tankers. Quole also meets Wavey, played by Julianne Moore, a local daycare provider. Quole finds surprises around many corners. Lies untold and life moves in.

I love Kevin Spacey, but in this kind of role he did not ring true. And, Dame Judi Dench what was she doing here?
Great actors abound in a so so film. Loved the book, liked the film.

1699651,4,B0000640VK,"Lasse Hallstrom has a knack for going to a cloistered, isolated community and making sense of the inhabitant's oddball circumstances and behavior. ""Shipping News"" is right up there with ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape.""

Here's the scoop. Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) is kind of a schlub but it might not be his nature but more in how his father treated him. He marries the awful Petal (Cate Blanchett) because she was the only woman who ever even looked at him. She dies in a car accident after having sold their daughter Bunny. He takes Bunny up to Newfoundland with his grandmother where his entire life changes.

This town in Newfoundland is a real hoot. Boats are the thing. Everyone has one and they all seem to know a good boat from a bad boat. The rickety house he lives in is tied to the ground, off a rocky shore, with steel cables. He finds that his family name is infamous in the area as being ruthless pirates and, by a fluke he gets a job as a reporter, befriends a local lady (Julianne Moore) who is also single and has a 'slow' son. But he starts to come alive. In Poughkeepsie he might have gotten lost in the crowd but here he begins to find a sense of self worth. His confidence grows by many degrees. The stories he writes for the local newspaper are gaining him attention which helps put him in tighter with the odd community.

This starts a bit rough. Even Spacey seems off his mark. But when things move from Poughkeepsie to Newfoundland things pick up a lot. Hallstrom works the territory. This area of Newfoundland is bleak most of the time. There are some sunny, calm days but overall it's very foreboding. Storms, fog, freezing rain. Makes you wonder why anyone would live there. It has such a haunting quality, but it adds to the overall. As in most Hallstrom flicks you really get to like these people warts and all. There are some good souls here and some bad. Some good things have happened to people but a lot of bad things have happened. The people are nearly as haunted as the place and they need to exorcise their demons. You wish them well.

This is a terrific film and well worth watching if you're into left of center outings.",1379116800,,2154,4.459390862944162
1699652,4,B0000640VK,"Kevin Spacey plays the hero, Quoyle, in this movie about Newfoundland, and Dame Judi Dench plays his aunt, who spirits him away from New York State to this far-different land. The movie is a faithful adaptation of the novel by Annie Proulx, who is herself descended from Newfoundlanders.

For all of you who don't know, Newfoundland is an island off the east coast of Canada, its tenth province, which did not come into Confederation until 1949. Newfies (as they are affectionately called in Canada - and besides: it's shorter than saying ""Newfoundlanders"" all the time) have always been and still are, fiercely independent people, descended from some Norse but mainly the Irish. They still refer to other Canadian as being ""from away.""

The story revolves around a hapless American (Kevin Spacey) of whom it could be said that if he didn't have bad luck, he'd have no luck at all. Quiet, unassuming, bashful, back-seat Quoyle marries an out-front gregariously sexy lady (Cate Blanchett) and is continually and cruelly used by her, which he tolerates. They have a daughter. Predictably, she deserts him and her child for another man and she and the man are killed in an auto accident.

Quoyle probably would have gone on in his quiet, emotionally- blunted way except for the appearance of an aunt about which he knew nothing (Judi Dench) who spirits them off to their ancestral home of Newfoundland.

Life on The Rock is different, to say the least. Quoyle gets a job on a small, local newspaper to report on the shipping news. Totally out of his league, he gets some humorous pointers from one member of the staff, played by the vintage Canadian actor, Gordon Pinsent (himself a Newfie). Along the way, Quoyle meets a female (Julianne Moore), with a damaged child who is as blighted as Quoyle is by a former husband. They are both victims who hesitate through life, never thoroughly grasping it, who stand aside and let events just happen to them. Therefore, their road to an eventual union is one of hesitation rather then action.

Under all these superficial events lie some deep, dark secrets of the Quoyle ancestors, which gradually surface.

It is how the protagonists deal with these emerging events and each other that creates the crux of a compelling story. Suffice to say that Quoyle eventually develops some back bone. It becomes for him, literally and figuratively, a case of ""sink of swim.""

I only gave this movie 4 stars because although it's a nice movie, it's not a great movie, although the performances of the actors are excellent (especially Gordon Pinsent) and the story is a compelling and at times, heart-rending one.

But it's definitely worth seeing.

1699700,5,B0000640VK,"Here is a great example of the proverbial film that slipped under the radar. I first ran into this film on late night cable. It started out a bit obscure in story, but as I kept it on while I doing some written planning as background ""white noise"", I got drawn into the plot, and it's a neat and funny and touching story. It's in a wild coastal fishing village in Maine ( I think), or maybe Canada....that's never made clear to my ears...the story is full of really unique characters. I especially liked the work of star Kevin Spacey, whose character-the main one in the story- comes of age and finds a future in this little village. His scenes with his daughter regarding the legend of a ghost and in the newspaper office as he stands up to a self-appointed boss ares great, among many. Also in the story we find a day care teacher played by Julianne Moore (put this beauty in any plot and the film gets better!), who helps the Spacey character fit into the community better as she deals with personal demons from her own past.  Dame Judi Dench (out of Bondage mode) is the third star of the story and steals many scenes through her unique character having to overcome past personal strife also. The village is full of unusual and entertaining as well as puzzling characters!
 I had to search for a long time to find it on DVD, and Amazon came through for me as usual. If you like obscure stories that can be funny yet take a serious tact now and then, this is just right for you.",1370649600,,1481,4.342960288808665

1699705,3,B0000640VK,"While I missed this movie when it first came out in 2001, I caught up with it on the Blu ray budget priced disc.  More on the BR later.  I've mostly enjoyed director Lasse Hallstom's films, most recently ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.""  This is no exception.  Stocked with a fine cast, the story involves a dweeb named Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) who is an ink man or something for a Poughkeepsie newspaper.  One night as he pulls into a gas station, a beautiful woman (Cate Blanchett) jumps in the car running from an abusive boyfriend.  As thanks, Petal (Blanchett) beds Quoyle which results in a child, Bunny (Gainer sisters).

Years later, Petal's wild ways haven't changed.  She and her new boyfriend eventually take Bunny with plans to sell her to an illegal adoption agency.  Bunny returns to her dad, but Petal and company don't fare well.  In the meantime, Quoyle's parents die.  Quoyle's rarely seen Aunt Agnis (Judi Dench) shows up and convinces Quoyle to accompany her to their origins in Newfoundland.  Once there, Quoyle gets a job at the local newspaper, this time as a reporter.  He also meets a beautiful widow (Julianne Moore) and her mentally challenged young son.

Adapted from Annie Proulx's novel, Hallstrom and Robert Nelson Jacobs's screenplay do a serviceable job moving the story along.  At times the film wants to slip into fantasy as the Quoyle's sullied history surfaces.  For the most part, the film avoids melodrama as it changes tone quite often.  Spacey's performance in particular buoys the sometimes sluggish film.

While there is nothing particularly objectionable about the Blu ray 1080p transfer, it's nothing special either.  The aspect ratio is 2.35:1 which is close enough to the original.  The coloring seems a bit smeary and dull but that could be the film's settings, mostly a bleak and barren north Atlantic seaside.  The audio as well is pretty non-descript.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 is fine for most of the dialog driven scenes, but the film has several stormy scenes as well.  There are also some shots on and under water that could have been enhanced with a more enveloping audio track.  The movie has only one supplement, a 23 minute ""Behind the Scenes"" short.",1367107200,4,2207,4.870967741935484

Things did pick up for Spacey's character toward the end, but I'm not sure why some things were added. If his life wasn't already bad enough, the author had to add rape and incest.

Ultimately the movie is a story of redemption and takes the viewer along for a highly emotional and introspective journey as Quoyle discovers himself, his past, and the possibilities life may offer.

The movie is beautifully done and I gave it five stars for the quality of the production and acting; it is a memorable movie. With regard to my personal preference I would only give it four stars due to the rather depressing tone of almost all of the film. While the movie is brilliantly acted and received numerous awards it presents a challenge to the viewer not to allow the somber tone that permeates much of the movie to overwhelm.

The movie was filmed in New Bonaventure, Newfoundland and offers an abundance of stark, dramatic scenery that helps set the tone of the movie.

Well, the complete loser, played by Spacey, finds love and happiness (or at least sex) at the end of the story,and we leave the theater as comfortable as we might have in, say, 1955.

The author offers vignettes from characters' and their ancestors' pasts, some of which the film takes hold of with startling results. Camera use and scenic choices make this a visual feast for anyone who enjoys a story set in a wild, forbidding environment, where the human denizens are the core of the tale. Music and soundtrack complete the experience. An excellent crossover from book to film, but one note of caution: the film is R-rated, for some rather starkly sexual and violent situations that could bother young children.

They face the challenges of discovering the ancestral home is a disaster, and must be completely refurbished, of the man having to take a job and learn a new skill as a reporter at the local newspaper, of the daughter having to adjust to a new town, where everything is just a bit off, and of everyone having to heal from their losses, while coming to terms with this remote village where there is more winter than summer, more unemployed than employed, and where seal fin pie is something that all newcomers must try.

Slowly, this family learns its niche in this village, some of it based on who the family was (pirates, who moved their house across the winter ice to a peninsula opposite the village), and some of it is based on the relationships that develop during their stay in the village. People fall in love, people die, and life is lived.

This is a beautiful story, with mystery and discovery enough for anyone. I would recommend this for colder winter's night in front of the fire, with popcorn, and without children who will ask every five minutes for explanations.

1699847,5,B0000640VK,"This touching film is proof that great movies can still be made. It is the quietly moving story of a decent, shy man whose only experience with love was heartbreakingly one-sided.

Kevin Spacey plays Quoyle to understated perfection in ""Chocolat"" director Lasse Hallstrom's deeply emotional film based on Annie Proulx's Pulitzer Prize winning novel. Quoyle's silence and simple words tell us volumes about the pain and turmoil going on inside him. Having married the only girl who ever really noticed him (Cate Blanchett) his only experience with love is associated with pain and ridicule.

When she deserts him and is killed in a car accident, he is left alone with his young daughter, and a heart full of grief and anguish. In an attempt to start over somehow he travels with his aunt Agnis (Judi Dench) to New Foundland, where his family has a long and not so sterling history going back generations. The dark and beautiful New Foundland coast has withstood the harsh winds over time and seems the perfect place for Quoyle to start his life over.

He is offered a job writing for the local paper and slowly gains some measure of self-respect. Quoyle certainly notices beautiful Wavey Prowse (Julianne Moore) on the trip over sea but cannot articulate his slowly growing attraction to her, and is relegated to friendship status only. She has some secrets of her own, however, which emotionally paralyze her beyond the sphere of her very special son. But when she warms to the kind and decent man inside Quoyle, it is he who has trouble responding, the damage done to his heart by Petal (Blanchett) overwhelming.

There is something magical about this film. There are colorful characters and mysteries unfolding about Quoyle's ancestors. And his young daughter hears the house once pulled up the hill by his clan speaking to her. Spacey's Quoyle must discover if you can love and be loved in return without pain. Both Spacey and Moore are wonderful here as they desperately try to overcome their damaged hearts and love once more.

The Shipping News is a slowly unfolding and richly rewarding film which stays in your heart after the final credits. Kevin Spacey gives one of his finest performances as a man finding his way and learning to heal. If you long for more than most movies arriving in theaters have to offer, give this a try.

As a film achievement, director Lasse Hallstrm created a world that drew me in from the start. The journey that Kevin Spacey's character takes, from total dweeb to realist, is as well portrayed as can be done in a 2 hour narrative. The acting is flawless; Spacey, Dench, Glenn, and those characters in the news office, all perfect. Cate Blanchett was terrific, and let everyone know that she was a heartless slut, but it could've been more developed. There was real fire there. The main character is the Newfoundland coast, the weather and the gorgeous terrain. There's a fascination that held me to the final frames, and a satisfying ending. Surprises along the way added to my enjoyment, and I decided to buy the film. Low key, pensive, clever script, interesting characters...well, that's why I love films. This is a good one.  Ms. Proulx wrote ""Brokeback Mountain"", and her attention to character is profound. Still, I'm reviewing the film, and NOT the book.",1224201600,2,1053,4.88268156424581

1699851,5,B0000640VK,"""Sink or swim"" was the motto of Quoyle's (Spacey) father. We learn that fast when the man tosses his young son into the sea for a 'swimming lesson.' His father's expectations of failure marked Quoyle's early life.

The opening of the film shows Quoyle's meeting the first woman he loved, Petal (Blanchett) and having a whirlwind relationship.  Petal abandoned Quoyle with their daughter, Bunny, only to return to take the child away and sell her to black market adopters for $6,000.

Bunny was returned to Quoyle after the police discovered Petal and her current companion in a fatal car crash and found the adoption paperwork. Shortly after, Quoyle's parents commit joint suicide after Quoyle's father sends him a note expressing his disappointment with his life, Quoyle, etc.

Quoyle and Bunny are still reeling from this double blow when his only living kin, Angis (Dench) shows up.  She's going back to their family's native homeland in Newfoundland and offers him a chance to come with them.

Initially, Quoyle doesn't fit in with the locals.  He's afraid of the water.  He's shy and awkward, but a local newspaperman gives him a shot as a reporter with the shipping news and car crash beat and Quoyle quickly finds his place.

""Shipping News"" is an intricate story that's well-acted and directed.  The scenery and the music alone are worth at least 3 stars.  I wish I had read the book first, but I'm planning on going back to do so.

1699852,5,B0000640VK,"One of my favorite movies of all time (and favorite books) is the Shipping News (based on the book by E. Annie Prouxl). Each time I watch it, I come away with a new understanding of what makes it good.

The story is about a man who had no breaks in life. He says he can remember thinking he was born to the wrong family, and that one day, his true family would rescue him from the one that he had. You can't blame him for feeling that way, he had a father that, to teach him to swim, threw him into the lake until he almost drowned. What kind of father can watch his child flounder in the water like that, in a panic, going under, gasping for air? But anyway, Quoyle (the main character acted by Kevin Spacey) survives his childhood only to grow up into a dreamlike existence, where he finds no happiness and nothing to live for. He fulfills his father's prophecies for him by dropping out of college and moving from dead-end job to dead-end job. Things begin to change for him when this crazy woman, ""Petal"" (acted superbly by Kate Blanchett) gets into his car at a gas station in order to leave her boyfriend with whom she's having a fight. She tells Quoyle to drive off, they go to a diner, and she talks about herself while Quoyle stares at her in wonder. What DOES he find so wondrous, you'll ask yourself? Anyone can see that this woman is trash. (And later events really do confirm this judgement.) But I think what Quoyle sees in her, is that she has something he doesn't have. She is so very alive. She is sensual--and I mean more than in a sexual way, she eats as if everything is the best thing she's ever tasted. She does what she pleases in life as if there is no one but her. She notices Quoyle staring at her and says to him, ""You want to marry me, don't you?"" And, after a romp in bed, he blurts out that he loves her. He loves her. And they marry and she is soon pregnant. She doesn't want anything to do with her child. Quoyle is the one who takes care of her while Petal continues her wild ways, including bringing men home to her bed. And what does Quoyle of the rubber backbone do after a night when Petal has done just that? Asks her, ""Did your friend leave?"" Yes, you'll cringe to see Quoyle accept this kind of treatment from Petal, but it just goes to show how hopeless he is.

Things turn around when an aunt (Judi Dench) that he never knew steps into his life, and they go to New Foundland together (the land of Quoyle's ancestors). Quoyle who used to be a printsetter at the paper in his old town, gets a job as a journalist for the little town's newspaper. A job he doesn't really think he can do, but has no choice. He has to write stories about car accidents, when there are no fishing stories, and in order to sell papers learns to turn dull stories into alluring headlines. Soon, everything that happens in this town in New Foundland holds a germ of a story idea for Quoyle and evokes great headlines as well. Little by little you see Quoyle begin to step out of his dream-like stupor and grow strong. One of my favorites lines in the movie comes after Quoyle writes an article about a nazi boat. It's probably the first time he is ever praised by anyone. He proclaims to himself, ""Lumbering Idiot Stuns Crowd for a change."" And you want to cheer.

I like this movie because to me it's a testament of hope that no matter what your beginnings are in life, no matter what your mistakes, you can overcome. You can be better. You can be somebody. You can be happy.  I've probably given enough away, but check out The Shipping News. (And try the book too!)",1200873600,2,3584,4.258443465491924
1699853,3,B0000640VK,"This movie is about redemption.  It isn't a stirring tearjerker but it is thought provoking.  I've read the book and it differs greatly from the movie, but the movie can stand on its own feet.  Kevin Spacey stars as ""Quoyle"".  A lonely, dejected human being who has basically given up on life.  When he meets ""Petal"" (Cate Blanchett) he is quickly drawn into her web.  She makes him feel alive and validated.  Petal uses him as a meal ticket and someone to provide for her while she whores around.  She accidentally gets pregnant by Quoyle and they have a daughter whom they name, ""Bunny.""  As the story progresses, Quoyle and Bunny end up moving to Newfoundland with Quoyle's aunt, ""Agnis"" (played to perfection by Dame Judi Dench).  There they plan to start new lives.  They move into the old family home and begin the process of mending the house and their respective broken lives.

Quoyle, Agnis and Quoyle's new friend, Wavey Prowse (played by beautiful Julianne Moore) are all grief stricken in their own way and dealing with painful memories.  The two women are each hiding painful secrets.  Almost every person in this film is damaged.

Quoyle learns the hidden secrets of his family's past, and as the story progresses, the secrets of Agnis and Wavey.

This is a movie about emotionally scarred individuals revealing their hurts and rendering themselves vulnerable.  It is a movie about people learning to accept their losses and becoming willing to move on.  It is a movie about redemption and second chances.  It's premise is never preachy or weepy, but stoic. Set against the bitter winter landscape of Newfoundland, the imagery is a projection of those bitter and desolate souls the story revolves around.

But no film can express the rich language and unique flow of the original.  In addition, the plot has been shuffled a bit and many of the less-dramatic parts removed.  Most of the characters look and sound right, however (though Spacey isn't fat like Quoyle) and the setting--splendid island scenery, surreal flashbacks and appropriately-placed dreariness--is well-represented.

1699885,3,B0000640VK,"Proulx' writing ... thick thorny knotty depthy convoluted intense edgy ... any number of adjectives -- how does one film such?  This movie brushed the story's surface rather admirably overall, but of necessity events moved quickly forward without subtleties.  Of course this leaves gaps that only leisurely chapter development and finely-tuned prose can fill.  But as this is the movie, the characters took over and thus became the tale.  Kevin Spacey's sympathetic Quoyle grows and changes on through to the film's end.  Dame Judi Dench, splendid as always, plays self-sufficient caustic Aunt Agnis who hides a terrible secret and rescues Quoyle from himself.  (Incidentally she's a lesbian as in NOTES ON A SCANDAL but that's not a major part of this story.) Petal, in the short time she's on screen, comes off as a truly nasty piece of work (Cate Blanchett, costar to Dench in NOTES). Wavey (Julianne Moore) lays her Newfie accent on a little thick but is beautiful and vulnerable with a strong substance behind those delicate looks.  Quoyle's daughter Bunny as a ""sensitive"" (she sees and knows things psychically) adds frisson to the surroundings, and the supporting cast comes off convincingly.  And then there's the gorgeous, powerful scenery.  The foggy lonely vistas, the dangerous sea, the storms rolling in.  As a staunch fan of both Proulx and Dench and lovely scenery it's a film worth watching.  And the Pulitzer Prize-winning book a truly worthy read.",1177545600,3,1466,5.117647058823529

Not only does the story bring the wild,  beauty of Newfoundland onto our screen but the strength and will of the human spirit is inspirational to us all.

1699889,2,B0000640VK,"Are you a cereal eater?  I find that I enjoy a cool bowl of Honey Bunches of Oats in the morning to best get my sleepy engine running.  What I enjoy are the clusters of wholesome oats and honey that really do a wonder on my taste sensations.  I like these clusters because, while they may be all different sizes, they are consistent with the rest of the cereal.  These clusters do not stand out, or work as a solo meal, but instead work with the rest of the bowl to give me an overall great breakfast experience.  If a person were to ask me about a way that The Shipping News could have been a better film, I believe I would have answered with the Honey Bunches of Oats analogy above.  This film was full of nothing but character clusters that unfortunately could not work with the rest of the film.  We had cluster after cluster of events taking place, raging from childhood rape to a wife's decision to spread false information all the way to a false autopsy (hopefully not giving too much away), but instead of making this a powerful film about human suffering, we are left with an unforgivable amount of lacking substance with each character, thus creating a horrid film which leaves you nothing to fully sink you teeth into.

Director Lasse Hallstrm has directed some great films like Cider House Rules as well as Chocolat, but The Shipping News will not be as successful as these films because of Hallstrm's lack of grip on the main subjects.  He begins this film by focusing intently on Quoyle (Spacey) painting us a bold and vivid portrait of his past and leering present, but once we get this story in motion, Hallstrm quickens his pace and drops Quoyle to the backburner as we attempt to create a town of mishaps.  Everyone is depressed, everyone has seen harder days, and everyone is jaded in this film because Hallstrm wants to demonstrate a village that sees the same problems that Quoyle does.  For me, this didn't work.  Instead of making the film as depressing as the scenery, perhaps he could have created a town a bit more realistic (maybe a bit more Capra-esque - although I didn't like it in Darabont's Majestic) which would allow the minimal characters to shine without the need to bring darkness into every story.  What could have made this film stand out would be the smaller, more supportive character being funny, cute, or even a bit optimistic.  Early in the film I accepted Quoyle for was who he was due to his life struggles, but I needed Hallstrm to give me a strong juxtaposition between where Quoyle was in Poughkeepsie to where he moved to in Newfoundland.  I know he seemed like he was getting a better life, but to me Hallstrm seemed to force it and make the transition tired and without emotion.  With the strength of the secondary characters, we could have seen a stronger transition for Quoyle in this new, yet familiar, home.  The fact that everyone in town harbored some dark, nearly horrific story just felt cheap because we, as an audience, were forced to spread our sympathies thin, not sure whom to give it the strongest attention.  In my eyes, the biggest error in Hallstrm's adaptation of this Pulitzer Prize winner was the lack of the environment, both living as well as scenic, surrounded Quoyle.

Typically Hallstrm has the ability to pull great work out of even the least favorite actor.  I saw this with Toby Maguire in Cider House Rules, but alas, with this film it felt like everyone was just trying to stay warm so they swooped through their lines devoid of anything worth mentioning.  Spacey doldrums his way through his character Quoyle, giving us yet another Pay It Forward spineless performance.  Ebert said that ""Spacey plays smart characters well"", and I couldn't agree with him more.  It just seems like lately Spacey has been afraid of those types and opts to rather play soft troubled characters where he never has to raise his voice.  Julianne Moore was forgetful in this film.  She has one type of character that she plays, and whether you watch this movie or Evolution or Magnolia, you typically see the same character just with a different name.  While I have enjoyed some of her performances in the past, it seems as if as I watch her going forward, she seems to blend everything together.  Her performance in this film reminded me of her performance in The Forgotten, but with a different accent.  Dame Judi Dench only plays roles like this one, so it should be no surprise that she chose to participate in this film.  Her character is confusing, which leads me to believe that Hallstrm didn't know quite to do with the power that Dench had to offer.  The only actor that I believed did something spectacular in this film was Cate Blanchett.  Her few moments on screen as Petal, also as the main catalyst for Quoyle, was breathtakingly refreshing.  She was smart, sharp, and passionately not herself, who made for a character this critic wishes we saw more of during this sloppy film.  Again, the clusters of characters in this film were never working together to defeat a common purpose, but merely being themselves, giving us no energy, and providing us with a film severely lacking in all core elements of cinema.

Overall, The Shipping News was a bust for Spacey fans, it was a bust for Hallstrm fans, and it was a bust for E. Annie Proulx's fans.  I will always be the first to say that it is difficult work to recreate the inner-human from the written page, because a director could never physically put a character/actor in a place where the characters within the book are, it is mentally and physically impossible.  There are some books that actually are translated well onto screen, but for this film, it did not happen.  I blame the director in this case for thinking that because the scenery was horrid, the characters would need to be as well.  I also place blame on the actors for not giving us enough dedication to their characters.  If you are looking for a book that would accompany this film just as well, check out Iain Banks' ""The Wasp Factory"".  It is one of those books that could never translate well into a film, but is just as depressing as this film is!

Circumstances occur that leave him alone in the world with a 6 year old daughter to care for, until a long lost aunt (Dench) he has never known shows up at his door. He and his daughter follow her on her journey to their ancestral home in Newfoundland where he attempts to better his life and the life of his daughter, and battle with the demons in both his own past and that of his ancestors.

Things slow down once we get to Newfoundland but it doesn't really get much better. It's alright to start with but after a while nearly every scene seemed just a little off, not by much but enough to make you laugh where you shouldn't be laughing.

A story about Quoyle, a man who no one believed in. Not his father, not his wife, not himself.

1699937,5,B0000640VK,"Annie Proulx, she has a very much endowed vein for fine-intimately spoken humor. Her novel SHIPPING NEWS won the Pulitzer Prize. The Swedish director Lasse Hallstrm (""The Cider House Rules"", ""What's eating Gilbert Grape"" and ""Chocolat"") brought it full of genius to screen. It is a MUST to see the scene, where the ancestors of Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) are pulling by rope their house across the ice. The pictures shot on location (Killick-Claw, a Newfoundland harbor town) are simply wonderful. But at first you have to endure the coming in-chapter: a bad life in New York, where Quoyle is overwhelmed by hussy type Petal (Cate Blanchett), a wild, hot-blooded woman, wearing a ton of make-up and short rubber mini-skirts, always looking for excitement with good time guys and honky-tonks, by whom Quoyle has a child, Bunny. Petal soon dies in a car crash with one of her boyfriends, short after Bunny was sold by her to a black-market child adoption ring for six thousand dollars. Moreover Quoyle's parents commit suicide. In this terrible situation (daughter Bunny is found by police) Aunt Agnes Hamm (Judi Dench) appears and Quoyle is convinced by her to move to their ancestral home on the Newfoundland coast. Quoyle takes a job as a reporter for the local newspaper The Gammy Bird and starts to rebuild his life, though the weight of an awful past bears down. Encouraged by the publisher Jack Buggit (Scott Glenn) and by Wavey Prowse (Julianne Moore), the owner of a day care center, Quoyle has to change his loser-life fighting against his demons and the demons of his ancestors. Also Aunt Angie or the ""widow"" Wavey have their nightmares, but together they get all problems under control. For example the mobbing of an oil-tanker-adoring journalist (Pete Postlethwaite) or getting overboard without a life-belt or losing the house tethered on a storm-wracked cliff during a heavy, cathartic storm. (And at the side there is a romance between Quoyle's daughter Bunny and Moore's son, who suffered brain damage during birth.) Spacey and Moore are wonderful as they, at her lowest point, try to overcome their damaged hearts and love once more. So they all recover from the terrors of their past lives, especially Quoyle's transformation from passive victim into a whole human being is heart-felt. It is good to see films like that, just a shame there is not more.",1122595200,7,2365,4.959697732997481
1699938,5,B0000640VK,"I'd never seen Kevin Spacey before I rented this movie. Needless to say, I now find it a little confusing why he hasn't been embraced more. He's brilliant. Another review mentioned that Spacey was against type in this movie. I have no idea what his ""type"" is but, as incredulous as this may seem to the MTV generation, not being typecast is a GOOD thing. It lets the artist grow, and if this movie is indication, wow, I can't wait to see how Spacey challenges himself in other films.

I've seen Lasse Hallstrom's work before, and knew his work was exemplary. As to the story, I was one of the lucky ones who never read the book and so could not prejudge the film. My main attraction to the film was the great Dame Judi Dench. As a PBS fan, I know her work on the series, ""As Time Goes By"".

This film shows how desolate living in a land with no trees can be. Quoyle's miserable personal fit right in with the landscape. I was afraid to watch the film, though, and so my first viewing was with the audio commentary. I was shocked to learn the amount of CGI that was used in the film. The house on the rock is only one story high, the rest was computer-generated!

Because of the fair amount of emotion in this film, it's bound to be branded a ""chick flick"". Such a name should be a badge of honor rather than derision. Work like this is rare and I will support work of this nature with a purchase. I've learned that if I venture out and take the time to explore a movie by an unknown actor I come away with a new respect and understanding for a people I know nothing about. That alone is worth the purchase price.",1116633600,13,1612,4.210355987055016
1699939,3,B0000640VK,"I am a big fan of Kevin Spacey. I am a big fan of Judi Dench. I really like a lot of Julianne Moore's performances. So why didn't I like ""The Shipping News"" more?

Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) has had a life with few luxuries and little joy. His emotionally abusive father colors the rest of his life, shaping the outcome of everything Quoyle participates in. Working as an inksetter at a newspaper in New York, Quoyle meets Petal Bear (Cate Blanchett), a woman wearing a ton of make-up and short rubber mini-skirts. Petal lures Quoyle into bed and Quoyle has the most satisfying moment of his life, after which he promptly declares that he loves her. Petal becomes pregnant and gives birth to Bunny, their child. But motherhood is not in her plans. Quoyle is essentially left to take care of Bunny. A devestating experience coincides with the death of Quoyle's parents and the arrival of his aunt, Agnis (Judi Dench). Agnis decides that nephew and grand-niece would be better off in the family's home-town in Newfoundland. The trio travel north and take up residence in the family home on Quoyle Point. Quoyle gets a job writing the shipping news for the local newspaper, encouraged by the publisher, Jack Buggit (Scott Glenn) and soon meets the local school teacher, Wavey (Julianne Moore). As life becomes more peaceful, Quoyle must deal with his demons and the demons of his ancestors.

Directed by Lasse Hallstrom and written by Robert Nelson Jacobs, from the book by E. Annie Proulx, ""The Shipping News"" becomes the latest in a string of films that Miramax has created in a blatant attempt to win an Oscar. Much like last year's ""Chocolat"" (also directed by Lasse Hallstrom and co-starring Judi Dench), the film is trying very hard to create an emotional storm, to woo potential Academy Awards and an increased box office. I would like to say that the film fails in these attempts, but I suspect it probably will win some nominations. The more important question is: Does it deserve to win nominations?

Spacey is great. He appears every inch the emotionally beaten man. This man has been given no breaks in life and this has robbed him of all motivation. A bright glimmer of hope arrives in the form of his daughter, Bunny. His life changes a bit, but not enough. When the family arrives in Newfoundland, Spacey introduces small, but significant changes in the character, allowing him to change with the change of scenery. Judi Dench plays perhaps the most interesting character. Hard and grizzled with age, she seems to have an impenetrable hide. Occasionally, Agnis lets Quoyle and Bunny in, and warms up to them, letting the faade crumble away. Julianne Moore is also very good as the school teacher with a mentally challenged little boy and a secret in the past. The cast is uniformly good; Pete Postlethwaite, Jason Behr, Scott Glenn, Rhys Ifans and many others round out the cast of supporting characters, but they can't overcome the main problems with the story.

There are two main problems. Every single character has a secret in their past or a problem that they are trying to hide. This is intended to give each of the characters some `heft', something to allow the actor to `emote'. In some cases, it works, but when every single character has this, it turns the story into a soap opera. Also, the film doesn't really seem to know what it wants to be, what sort of emotion we should feel. The film creates some genuine laughs about each of the characters but then, in almost every case, the same thing we were laughing about becomes the dramatic pinnacle of this character. In some cases, we shouldn't be laughing about these things at all. In a way, this made me feel cheated. As I am supposed to feel emotion for this character for this thing, I remembered back to earlier in the film when I was laughing about the same thing. Now that I know the full scope of the problem/ secret/ etc., I can't buy into it.

I think both of these problems lie squarely on the shoulders of director Lasse Hallstrom and writer Robert Nelson Jacobs. I can't understand why they would do this so consistently. It robs the film of all impact. My only guess is that they were trying to alleviate the dramatic tension. Unfortunately, the dramatic tension has to be there in the first place for it to be relieved. If we laugh about something before we know what is going on, how can this relieve anything?

The beginning is a brilliant piece of filmmaking. It visually establishes Quoyle's character and his entire life up to the point where the film takes up. Unfortunately, this is not carried throughout the film.

If you can overlook the blatant attempt at trying to win an Oscar and soap opera feel of the film, there are some good performances worth catching, but the film is definitely a film that can be caught on video. I don't recommend the film, but I do recommend the performances.",1113264000,5,4884,4.685314685314685

1699941,3,B0000640VK,"I adore Spacey, Moore, and Blanchett, but this film was simply a structural and emotional botch. I may have missed the oh-so-subtle strokes of Canada and Newfoundland, like nearly the 99.9% of the audience that's not from those areas would.

A book adaptation calls for some, well, adaptation, but why expend all that effort when you can crank up some visual pizzazz and wrap them in mysterious accents from obscure island towns? Such seems to have been the thinking of filmmakers.

Spacey plays a feeble inksetter for a shipping newspaper. He's queuing up for gas one day when Cate Blanchett jumps into his car and shouts Let's Go. Cut to Spacey's place, where the two make out like rabbits in heat. Cut to 9 months later, Blanchett is pregnant and screaming a lot. Cut to 6 years later, they're married with a daughter, though it's not really much of a marriage; he wimps along the sidelines while she ignores her kid and has sex with strange men in the living room. And so forth. The movie, the relationships, the whole human nuances from there move downhill.

This quaint ground is covered in such a compressed rush that we simply have no way of getting involved. None of which was necessary in the first place as all relevant details are referenced in the latter half of the film.

For a movie so muddled in tone and texture, with such an fiercely pathetic lead character, the filmmaking sure has a confident air about it. The acting is good but the funk of weird characters is so stark I can't help suspecting that all this intensity was an intentional trope for the awards.",1106697600,3,1580,4.632142857142857

1699943,5,B0000640VK,"I am so glad I took the time to watch this movie!

As I writer myself, I am often critical of others' work. But this is one of those movies that was so well written, and so well made, that while I was watching it I could only sit there thinking: I wish I'd had the skill to write this.

Like a tapestry, the threads of the story weave together to make a magnificent whole, of which every part is simply beautiful. It is subtle yet bold, slow moving yet frenetic, ordinary yet extraordinary, exhilarating yet sad, and hilarious yet serious.

The directing is superb, the cinematography magical, and the cast top notch, comprising some of the best actors from at least three continents of the world. The scripting is wonderful and insightful, with not a wasted word, and has a sly sense of humour that sneaks up on you and catches you unawares. But whilst the dialogue is at all times brilliant, sometimes the cleverest things about the script are actually the things that AREN'T said--the implications, the realisations you are left with. This is definitely a movie that will make you think, and make you feel.

If you asked me to describe the plot of this movie, I truly couldn't. The basic premise is 'man loses wife and parents, moves back to ancestral home'. Sound ordinary, doesn't it? But this story is anything BUT ordinary. It twists, and turns, and fools you into thinking it's flowing slowly and gently, even while it is constantly throwing unexpected surprises at you (the one thing this film is NOT is predictable!) I was rivetted to the screen throughout the entire film, and that's saying something, because like many people in my generation, I usually have the attention span of a goldfish.

I have read the other reviews on this page, and I must say, some of them seemed to miss the point of this movie. One reviewer complained that you never really get to know the characters properly at the start of the movie. But as I see it, that's a good thing. At the beginnning, we know as much about the characters as they know about themselves--only what matters to get by. But as the movie progresses, the characters, especially the main ones, learn more about themselves, and in the process, we learn more about them too. Seriously, if every detail about the characters had been explained to us right from the start, it would have defeated the point of this movie, which is a voyage of discovery for both the characters and the viewers. It would have been like Agatha Christie revealing on page one that the butler did it. Where would the fun be in that? The reviewer also complained that he did not 'connect' with the characters. But I disagree, because I totally did, especially the main character, who had been told for so long that he was a pathetic good-for-nothing that he ended up believing it. He is downtrodden, bullied, the kind of man who lives a life so ordinary that no-one notices him...until the day when he does get noticed by a girl called Petal, and his life changes forever. Anyone who has ever felt hard done by, anyone who has ever been bullied, anyone who has had an imperfect family life, and anyone who has ever yearned to do more with their life, but wasn't entirely sure how, will empathise with this man from the first moment of the movie. He is drowning in the misery of his life. But given time, he might actually learn to swim...

I don't know why this movie never scored big at the Oscars or the Golden Globes. Perhaps Julianne Moore should have put on a big fake nose or something, since that was enough to win Nicole Kidman the best actress award!

This movie is great. You really should see it. But just in case you need any extra reason to watch it, let me tell you, the music soundtrack totally kicks butt! Oh, and the role of Petal is played by Cate Blanchett, who all you Lord of the Rings fans will know very well.

Kevin Spacey does a strong job as Quoyle, who takes his young daughter off to Newfoundland when his wife (the wonderful Cate Blanchett, in a small role) is killed while running off with a lover.  Judi Dench plays Quoyle's aunt, a somewhat acerbic and bitter woman, who has her own skeletons.  In Newfoundland, Spacey gets a job as the shipping news reporter, and although not qualified for the job, his tenacity and naivete eventually lead to his success.  Scott Glenn has a nice role as the gruff owner of the paper.  Love comes when Quoyle meets the lovely Wavey, played well by the talented Julianne Moore, who also has her own sad past.

After Petal dies in a car crash, Quoyle reconnects with his Aunt Agnis (Judi Dench), who has come to New York after the death of her brother, Quoyle's father.  Both at a loss, they decide to return to the family home in Newfoundland.  The old house, tied down by cables to keep it from blowing away in storms, is still standing, though it has been empty for forty-four years, and the family moves in.

Working not as an inksetter but as a reporter for a local newspaper, Quoyle reports car crashes and the shipping news.  Though he has no sense of drama and no real writing ability, he finds that some of the stories he uncovers interest people, and he begins to develop emotionally.  Through his contact with a vivid local community and the friendships that evolve, he uncovers some of his own family history, shows a confidence he's never had before, and begins to face his personal demons, as do daughter Bunny and Aunt Agnis.  Helping him along the way is Wavey Prowse (Julianne Moore), whose own life is as filled with dark secrets as that of the Quoyle family.

Adapting Annie Proulx's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel to the screen, scriptwriter Robert Nelson Jacobs remains true to the characters of the novel, but sacrifices their depth and subtlety, leaving them hollow and lacking true motivation. Spacey effectively portrays Quoyle's awkwardness and naivete but plays each scene as if it were unconnected with those going before and after, and Julianne Moore, while sympathetic toward Quoyle, does not feel like a ""real"" Newfoundlander with emotional ties to the rest of the community.  Because neither character is fully developed, the action, which is character-based, fails to move the viewer.

Oliver Stapleton's cinematography is coldly stark, filled with angry winds and weather but so beautifully photographed that in many ways it is the strongest aspect of the film.  Swedish director Lasse Hallstrom, nominated for a Best Director Oscar for 1999's The Cider House Rules, here flits from scene to scene and subject to subject, never really developing the kind of tension and drama that comes from careful pacing and strong, fully drawn characters.  More melodramatic and less humorous than the novel, the film is, nevertheless, an atmospheric and fascinating glimpse of a unique culture and way of life.

1699988,4,B0000640VK,"One thing is clear to me after watching this movie; I have to read the book for which Annie Proulx won a Pulitzer. This is an amazing story, with complex characters and which shows the idiosyncrasy of a population that is unknown for most of us. The movie shows how a broken man can heal with the help of loved ones and friends, even in an extremely tough place to live in.
Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) had a disastrous childhood, with a demanding father that specialized in pushing him over the edge without giving him any love. As an adult, he works in the print of the Poughkeepsie News as an ink setter and has no one in this world. One day he stops at a gas station and Petal (Cate Blanchett), who was fighting with her boyfriend, gets into Quoyle's car and says: ""Let's go"". Quoyle has such a need for a little love that he falls right away for Petal, she gets pregnant and they have a baby. But life is not easy for Quoyle; Petal sleeps around without any shame and does not take care of her daughter.
To make matters worse, in a period of a few days Quoyle receives a phone call from his father telling him that he was killing himself and his wife, Petal runs away with their daughter and dies in a car crash, and Quoyle's aunt shows up at his house and steals the ashes of his father. After getting back his daughter and being at a total loss as to how to go on, Quoyle ends up moving to Newfoundland with his aunt and daughter. Here he meets new people, a different culture and new challenges that will change his life.
The photography in this movie is absolutely outstanding, with scenes that leave the viewer breathless. The other aspect to praise, besides the great story, is the cast, in particular Kevin Spacey and Cate Blanchett. Even though the latter has a brief appearance, her role is so convincing, that she deserves credit for the overall outcome of the film. Julianne Moore plays Wavey, the owner of a day care center in Newfoundland that has lost her husband right before giving birth to their child.

The film  will slip by you if you let it, but will burst into full art before your eyes if you give it a chance.  This movie has even caused me to learn about Newfoundland.

That being said, I really enjoyed this movie.  It is certainly not perfect, but Kevin Spacey turns in a really strong performance.  I didn't enjoy Judy Dench's performance as much as I usuaally do.  The story is engrossing, and this is one of the few movies that I have seen multiple times; fact is, my wife and I watch it almost every month.",1064275200,,583,4.043478260869565

The story is extremely simple, but thankfully enlivened by good acting and occasional quirkiness on the part of the characters and situations (the kind of amusing quirkiness and humor we often see in this particular director's films).  The scenery is quite nice, too, though undercut a bit by a surprisingly grainy and dull DVD transfer.  The 25-minute or so ""making of"" documentary is extremely annoying, as 75% of it is basically just clips from the film (to me, that's taking the lazy route), with very little in the way of interviews and behind-the-scenes stuff.  There's also a commentary, but I confess that the film didn't sufficiently interest me enough to watch it again with the commentary turned on.  To conclude with some final thoughts about the movie itself, though I'll grant some points for subtlety, I still would have appreciated seeing more in the way of overt and dramatic examples of exactly how and why our main character stops being a doormat and reactor to the world around him and someone more in control and confident by film's end.  I agree with another reviewer who said that the voice-over narration (especially at the end) comes off as a too-obvious attempt to provide thematic focus that is lacking in the film itself.  So, in the end, the film is worth a look for the scenery, acting, and some amusing character and story bits, as well as some memorable imagery here and there (like the house being dragged across the ice), but you certainly won't kick yourself when it's over for not catching the movie in the theater.",1063238400,,1677,4.8426573426573425

Newfoundlanders will never let you forget they're from the rock, that's for sure.  Many would say that it's a unique culture but it also has variations - there are 'townies' and 'bay folk'.  This movie clearly concentrates on the rural folk who traditionally made a living off the fisheries and secondary industries.  It shows none of the sophistication of St John's (the Capitol).
The shipping news relentlessly reveals the secrets of a clearly dysfunctional family and damaged individuals.  The movie would have you believe that everyone from the rock was a victim of poverty, violence and incest and mainly gutted fish for a living.  This typesetting would hardly be allowed with any other group.
That said, I did enjoy the movie.  All the characters were delightfully played and the plot moved along well.

1700056,4,B0000640VK,"Most of the reviews here were from people who did not read the book first.  As is virtually always the case, important mental and emotional pieces of the story must be left behind due to the constraints of condensing the story into two hours on the screen.  The viewer is not exposed to Bunny's clairvoyance or her little sister and where Petal was heading when she got killed, enough of the Aunt's character, the trip to town that Quoyle and Wavey take together which provides an indication of the their growing relationship, and any number of other details which would give greater insight into the characters.  It would have been interesting to see the story of the Uncle and the dire straits in which he existed.  We do miss a lot of the inner journey that Quoyle must take in order to become the character that he develops into.  Even so, I enjoyed watching this movie several times over and all of the added features on the dvd.

Since I've not read the book, I can't form an opinion on this but judging the movie itself, I think it was well done regardless of whether it followed the book or not.  The movie ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a good example of this.  I liked this movie so much, I bought the book only to be disappointed in the movie.  However, if you judge the movie on it's own without knowledge of the book, it's a good movie.  I think this is probably the case with ""The Shipping News"".
The characters probably seem unbelievable to anyone not from Newfoundland or Cape Breton Island or to anyone that doesn't know anyone from those two places.  I grew up on Cape Breton Island and have friends from some of the most remote places in Newfoundland.

But get this! The main character of the novel, Quoyle, has ""a great damp loaf of a body"", a protruberent chin, and is endlessly morose.  So they cast Kevin Spacey in this crucial role.  Now you can see the problem with the movie.  The book turns on the reader's believing that Quoyle would act as he does because he is as he is.  But Spacey, being nothing like the real Quoyle, is run aground because there is no way that HE would react to the events in Quoyle's life the way Quoyle does.
Not the presence of Judi Densch, Julianne Moore, Spacey, Scott Glenn, or Cate Blanchett can manage to save this misdirected film.  Not that it's Lasse Halstrom's fault either.  He just got the wrong actor to play the lead role.

1700059,5,B0000640VK,"Is it possible to touch on darn near every human experience in a 111 minute film?  One wouldn't think so, but Lasse Halsstrom (director) does so with stunning clarity.
The film is about Quoyle (Kevin Spacey), a man broken apart by an unsatisfying marriage to a [witch] (played excellently by Cate Blanchett).  Before the marriage ends, they have a child, Bunny -- who is the highlight of her father's life -- and the mother is killed in a car accident. Coincidentally, Quoyle's ""mother"" and father were killed very recently, too.
Enter Agnes Quoyle (Judi Dench), Quoyle's ""aunt"" who's heard about the death of her ""nephews"" parents and is there when news of the death of Bunny's mother arrives.  It is clear from the outset that Agnes doesn't want to hang around, but feels compelled to when she sees her ""nephew"" fall apart in front of his daughter.  She recommends that he and his child come with her to Newfoundland, to discover a new life for themselves....
The trouble is, is that their old life also awaits them in Newfoundland.  Agnes is not -- exactly -- as she appears to be, nor is Quoyle's family.  Quoyle soon discovers his family lineage: Piracy and wickedness.  And he soon finds a new love interest who is just as broken as he is (Julianne Moore).
A curse on their native house in Newfoundland, ghosts, a sixth-sense that some natives have (that comes alive in Quoyle's daughter, too, as the days slip past), homosexuality, incest, murder, family bonds, and a beautifully austere landscape round out much of the story.  Didn't I tell you this film had it all?  Well...now you'll just have to go and see it for youself!  And please do.

1700060,4,B0000640VK,"In Will and Ian Ferguson's underrated masterpiece ""How To Be A Canadian,"" there is a chapter entitled ""Art and Stuff,"" in which they discuss Canadian literature, and in doing so identified the following elements present in ""The Shipping News"": incest, female character as empowered victim, graphic but ironic use of violent imagery, healing (but only at the end). This I have found true in a number of Canadian bestsellers. So how does ""The Shipping News"" hold up as a film in view of these dark elements?
First, practically none of the actors are from Newfoundland (with the exception of the fantastic Gorden Pinsent, frequently seen on ""Due South""), which is evident in the mangled accents. It gains some respectability back by being filmed on location (between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia). And the soundtrack, with five contributions from Newfoundland's own Great Big Sea, is a rollicking collection of sea chanties smoothed with guitar, tin whistles and strings during the quieter moments. However, none of the Great Big Sea songs were featured on the soundtrack CD (minus twenty points!).
The story (I don't want to give too much away since the story is certainly...original) deals with R.G. Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) and his scatterbrained girlfriend Petal (Cate Blanchett). The two have a young daughter, Bunny, and after Petal's demise Quoyle and Bunny head to Newfoundland to move into their ancestral home, along with Agnis Hamm, Quoyle's aunt. The rest of the story deals (somewhat predictably) with fitting into the new community, reconciliation with the past, brushes with death and the strength of family in the face of adversity. Quoyle works on the local newspaper writing the shipping news, which he adds his own personal touch to. We meet his coworkers (Billy, Tert, Beaufield and Jack), the lovely Wavey (Julianne Moore) who runs the local daycare and her mentally challenged son Herry, who becomes Bunny's playmate (another question: who NAMED these people?!), and long lost relatives and dark family secrets. There is a bit of strong language, alcohol use, violence (including a murder), disturbing images (including rape of a minor), and a brief sex scene, which give the film its R rating. If you enjoy artsy films, beautiful scenery, an unusual yarn, or Celtic (and Newfie) music, ""The Shipping News"" may be for you.",1045785600,,2338,5.155263157894737
1700061,4,B0000640VK,"Staring Kevin Spacy as Quoyle, a loser in life who works as an ink setter at a Poughkeepsie newspaper, this film is adapted from the novel by E. Annie Proulx who specializes in using macabre details in her moody and sad books.
Quoyle's wife, played by Cate Blanchett, is a tramp who treats him like dirt and, when she is killed in a car crash and leaves him with their 6-year old daughter, he is an emotional wreck.  That's when his aunt, played by Judi Dench enters the scene and convinces him to move back to the place of his roots, a remote village in Newfoundland where he lands a job as a reporter on the town newspaper, and falls for a local woman, Julianne Moore.
This is not a simple story, however, as there are haunting mysteries everywhere, mysteries that made me squirm uncomfortably as they were uncovered.  This is not a pleasant film to watch and the story, although fascinating, moved a little too slow for my taste.
Clearly, the best part of the film is the outstanding performance of Kevin Spacey.  I always knew he was a good actor, but this is a difficult role as we watch him transform from an emotionally damaged doormat husband into a man.  Along the way there are tears and fear and terror.  And the way he plays it, it all becomes real.  In my opinion, he should have been nominated for an Academy Award.
The setting comes alive and there was great cinematography of the harsh Newfoundland coast. The film is disturbing, as it is supposed to be, but some of the details are never explained to my satisfaction, and, at the end, there were still questions hanging.  For that reason I hold off giving it a high recommendation.  It is generally good filmmaking though and movie buffs will like it.",1045785600,5,1718,4.501607717041801

1700073,2,B0000640VK,"You'd think a story that includes rape, incest, parental abuse, a fatal car crash, the selling of children, and professional murder as a family tradition, might actually raise your pulse. But Robert Nelson Jacobs' screenplay is so resolutely inoffensive, and Lasse Hallstrom's direction so fatally cautious, that the film struggles to hold your attention for its scant 100 minutes as it skips playfully over all that nasty stuff in hot pursuit of a fairytale ending. Such an approach worked for these guys in ""Chocolat"" where the material was souffle-light, but here it's heavier and the superficiality proves fatal. This is supposed to be the story of Quoyle's transformation from exploited loser to self-determined family man with a new vision of life. But how and why does it happen? Where are the experiences that drive his inner change? What, he cheers up just because someone likes his news stories and he finds a similarly damaged girlfriend? It works in the novel, where we delve more deeply into Quoyle's character and past and come to understand him. But doing that in a film is more difficult - you can resort to dream sequences and flashbacks as this one does, but it's never really clear what these moments mean to Quoyle. Emergency explanatory voiceover is chopper-lifted in with the camera at the end, just in case you missed the point - and it's highly likely you will have. Like so many Oscar-hungry films these days, this one makes the mistake of thinking that a brilliant cast, soaring music, and a few lines of pontificating dialogue can hide an empty core. But you can't have light without darkness, you can't have growth without pain - and this film just doesn't have the nerve to go anywhere near either of them. Compare it with ""American Beauty"" and you'll see precisely what I mean.",1042329600,7,1807,4.87012987012987

1700075,5,B0000640VK,"Kevin Spacey first snapped my attention as Mel Proffit on the CBS telly series WISEGUY.  He played a drug dealing, jet-setting, psycho that went around killing people, freaking out and saying things like ""only the toes knows..."".  Well, if the toes knew, they must have know what a big star Spacey would be in just a few years.  He choses films that stretch his untouchable range in the Usual Suspects, the serial killer in 7, the gentle soul claiming to be an alien in the wonderfully moving K-Pax to this gem of a film The Shipping News.  This was a gentle, loving, heart-lifting book, so I feared when it came to the screen, all the quirkiness that made it so special might be lost.  Instead, it is beautiful realised under Spacey brilliant performance, backed by the ever eternal and radiant Juliana Moore and the utterly marvellous Judy Dench and the solid Pete Postlethwaite, and another super tour de force for the ever solid Scott Glen.
This is a story that touches your heart, the way so many of Hollywood films fail to do, and leave you smiling at the end, and maybe even leaves you missing these near friends you have come to love.  It is good to see films like that do so well, just a shame there is not more.
It is brilliantly written, with all the quirkiness you find in a small knit community, the isolation tend to make the locals revel in their bizarre personalities and even sort of wear them like a badge.  I have seen this same 'wee tight isle' in Scotland and in Ireland and small towns in the US.  Everyone knows everyone - knows the history as far back as it goes.  The past is not so distant, where people with the sight is just an everyday occurrence.
Kevin Spacey plays a gentle soul, driven by an overbearing, likely abusive father to believing he was nothing.  He felt the world pasted him by until Petal jumped into his car.  Petal is typical Hussy type, a lass out for fun and little else.  For the first time, Kevin's character feels that he no invisible.  Petal gets pregnant, have a baby girl, Bunny, and then precedes to live life just as she always had, with good time guys and honky-tonks.  She checks in long enough to upset Spacey, and pat the kid on the head.  When the child is about 8, she slips away with child in tow, running away with the latest boyfriend.  If that is not upsetting enough, Spacey's father and mother decided life is the pits and check out.
In the midst of finding out Petal died in a car crash with her boyfriend, but sold Bunny to a black-market child adoption ring for six thousand dollars, Spacey's long lost aunt,(Dench) turns up to steal her brothers ashes.  (Won't reveal what she does with them!!  She encourages Spacey to take his daughter and move back to New Foundland to where his family comes from.  Once there his daughter shows tendencies of 'the sight' but it is taken in stride.
Scott Glen owns the local paper and hired Spacey to write the shipping news.  He fears failure in this, since Petal just reinforced his worthlessness instilled by his father.  However, instead, he comes into his own.  He also begins a tentative romance with Moore, with his daughter taking to her son, who suffered brain damage during birth.
Spacey faces his demons and learns to heal, as Dench confronts her own secrets and shames, and loves to move on.
The scenery is gorgeous, raining and foggy ( sorry I am a Scot and love a bit of the wet and fog makes me want to walk in it forever.  This captures the moodiness, though the snow in May does make one shudder!)

The problem with this film is its script. The plot is sentimental, predictable drivel, starting well casting Spacey as the heartbreaking loner, but resolving his problems in such a ""...and they all lived happily ever after"" fashion that it is impossible to feel uplifted by his transformation.

This was an interesting movie in one sense, all these lives intertwined. The growth and personal lives of the characters However, I felt there was so much going on that you never got the full import of how each character was developing, until later thinking about the movie.
R.G. COYLE WAS A VICTIM OF HIS OWN INACTION
First there was Kevin Spacey's (R.G. Coyle) character and his relationship with his abusive parents.  His character was that of a beaten dog.  He runs into the character of Petal played excellently by Cate Blanchett.  She continues the abuse but also provides him with a daughter, Bunny.
His father's exit from this world is announced to him in the most causual of ways, which starts a snowball of tragedies just as an unknown aunt (Judy Densch) appears on his doorstep.
LIFE IN NEWFOUNDLAND
It is clear that life feels too much for R. G. Coyle.  It all happens to him.  He grudgingly accepts the suggestion of his long lost aunt to return to his family's former homeland.  His last name opens some doors for him and his peculiar new life is begun.
His new home is in northern Canada, where fishing and shipping is the lifeblood of the town.  His name carries weight, but he is surprised at its significance.  Everyone seems to know more than him.  Secrets abound, even within his own family.
A town widow befriends him, and their relationship develops but not without its troubles.
Not a lot changes but what does change,  changes for everyone.  This would have been easier to follow as a book as each person's life from his employer and his son, his co-workers, his aunt, the widow and her son and his daughter's lives are all intricated weaved and changing with time.  A lot like real life, but then in real life the focus is a bit more narrow.

1700124,5,B0000640VK,"""The Shipping News"" is one of those films where I find myself compelled to go out and read the novel, because you get the feeling that there is just so much more out there about these characters.  However, if you listen to the commentary track on the DVD version of this film you will probably here more than you want to about what else is in the book and what they changed/omitted/added from the book than you might possibly want to know.  Anyhow, this time around we are talking about Lasse Hallstrom's film.
The story of ""The Shipping News"" is certainly nothing new: a weary man, R. G. Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) beaten down by life returns to the home of his father and finds an entirely new life.  What makes the story work are the place and the characters.  What makes the film work is the scenery and the actors.  After a whirlwind introduction to Quoyle and the disaster his life has become, he and his daughter Bunny are taken under the wing of his Aunt Agnis (Judi Dench), who suddenly appears on his doorstep after the suicide of his father.  Her solution is to take Quoyle to Newfoundland where he finds himself suddenly working for the ""Gammy Bird,"" the local newspaper, where he is supposed to write the Shipping News.  Everyone at the newspaper is a colorful character (Gordon Pinset as Billy Pretty is my favorite of the lot) and there is Wavey Prowse (Julianne Moore), a widow lady who runs the local day care and whose life story is almost as sad as Quoyle's.  Then we throw into the mix the strange green house cabled to the point and the rather brutal history of the family Quoyle.
Obviously the guy is going to get the girl in this film, but the romance aspect of ""The Shipping News"" is such a slow and torturous dance that you are compelled to root for this couple to drop their barriers and finally find each other (this was where the unpredictable elements of the film's predictable storyline won me over).  Meanwhile each performance in this film is pretty much an exquisite little character study.  For my money Kevin Spacey is the finest actor working in films today and his performance as Quoyle is simply unlike anything you have seen him do to date.  This is a subtle performance of a man waking from what has been essentially a lifelong dream to join the real world.  Like Spacey, Judi Dench's best scenes involve silence, where a look becomes more eloquent than dialogue.  Julianne Moore turns in an understated performance that matches this pair, while Cate Blanchett in a small but pivotal role as Petal gives the film its initial emotional charge.  Scott Glenn as Jack Buggit, owner and publisher of the ""Gammy Bird"" provides the strange opportunity for Quoyle to find a new life (while gutting fish at the same time).
I would be inclined to think that those who have admired the group of actors seen in this film from their previous performances will be more enamored with ""The Shipping News"" than those who come to it from having read E. Annie Proulx's novel.  However, I like films in which I get the feeling there is much more to the characters, the story, and the world in which they live, which is why I feel so inclined to go read the novel and see what else went on up in Newfoundland with Quoyle and company.  This is one of the better character studies to come down the road for a while and if that is you cup of tea, then definitely check out this film.",1030060800,2,3394,4.512234910277325
1700125,5,B0000640VK,"Kevin Spacey works well into this thought-provoking tale of man gone back to try to find his place in the scheme of things, a man returning in search of his roots. Given the fact that doing so requires Spacey to abandon his usual self-confident demeanor and ostentatious panache in favor of a more confused and self-tortured inaction and doubt, this is a meaningful departure from his previous work. Yet he does so with more than enough skill, tact, and craftsmanship to make the central character quite believable. This is critically important, as this film is really a character study of the Spacey character and of his tortured efforts to try to find a way out of the box life has placed him in, to try to rediscover himself.
The supporting cast is memorable, as well, with the lovely Julianne Moore providing a comely yet intriguingly flawed love interest sufficient to both interest and attract this cold fish up a bit. Also, Dame Judy Dench is absolutely superb playing his curmudgeonly old aunt, a woman substantial enough to literally drag Quoyle back to his remote ancestral digs in coastal Newfoundland to help him search for his place in the family pantheon. Scott Glenn is also very good as a local newspaper publisher who sees potential in Quoyle and thus lures him into his world, as does the lovely Cate Blanchett, who promptly seduces Quoyle into a little lesson in love and regret.
I really like this film as it takes the time and energy required to turn an off-beat character study into a memorable story, one we can all relate to, and one full of the pathos and pity that life is too often writ with. It is not a particularly fast-paced movie, and those looking for a quick pace or a lot of action best look elsewhere. But if you want to take some time to spend in looking deliberately and provocatively at many facets that make up a complex and evolving human being, this movie won't steer you wrong. I highly recommend it. Enjoy!",1030060800,8,1950,4.655072463768116

1700127,3,B0000640VK,"The acting by Cate Blanchett is so good in this film. Its amazing how she can change accents and characters. I really think she is one of the best actors out there. The others turn in good performances, Julianne Moore, especially. I wish Cate would have had more film time because her acting really got me interested in the movie. The spectacular views of Newfoundland also were worth seeing. The director of this film is so good at bringing his movies to life. He captures the mood and feel of the settings so well. Remember the sets on Chocolat. I would see any of his movies just because the sets are so full of imagination and creativity. The storyline has the mystical magic in it but unlike Chocolat it didn't catch me as much and pull my interest. I remember going out and reading the book after seeing Chocolat, this movie just didn't have the intrigue that I would have liked. The storyline just wasn't catching me and if not for the sets my interest really would have deflated. But the first part with Cate really catches you and if we could just have had more of that, or built her more in the movie, I think it would have been better, more alive!

1700128,5,B0000640VK,"This film is a small, quirky character study with not much plot.  This is my favorite kind of movie, but if it's not yours, you may hate this film.
The acting here is all first rate.  Kevin Spacey's character is more subdued but less bleak than the one he played in ""American Beauty.""  Quoyle (Spacey) comes into adulthood a beaten-down, invisible lump, but life gives him a daughter to love, a job he becomes good at, a woman he can relate to as a friend (Julianne Moore), a family member (Judi Dench) who is encouraging to him, and a place to belong (Newfoundland).  He is not so broken that he can't appreciate all this, so his transformation from lump to human being is believable, not schmaltzy or feel-good miraculous.  I particularly enjoyed Quoyle's interior headline-writing as commentary on his life.  It added a touch of ironic humor to the film.
Julianne Moore is brilliant and very different than I've seen her before.  Here, she is strong, but sensitive and a little scared of another relationship with a man.  She and Spacey stumble believably and amusingly in getting to know each other.  Her affection for his daughter is an important element in his transformation.
Dench plays Spacey's aunt, one of the supporting characters, and does not dominate on screen as she usually does.  This is okay because this is not her story, it's Quoyle's (Spacey's).  However, the aunt is important in giving Quoyle a sense of family history and a connection to Newfoundland, where the aunt, Quoyle and his daughter go to live.
Cate Blanchett undoubtedly had fun playing Quoyle's bad girl wife and the mother of his child.  She has more range and screen presence than any actress of her generation.  Her place in this story is as a harmful influence on Quoyle and his daughter, badly twisting both of their self-images, but her impact is believable and pivotal to their (the father and daughter's) relationship.
The other supporting characters, his daughter and the men at the newspaper office where Quoyle works, are all fine.  Rhys Ifans (Hugh Grant's roommate in ""Nottinghill"") is warm and funny as Quoyle's buddy at the paper.
The scenery of Newfoundland very much controls the mood of the film.  It's beautiful, but scary and daunting.  So is life.  Both can be appreciated and enjoyed if you accept what is and build on that for the future.
It's a wonderful movie.  I highly recommend it.",1028505600,16,2395,4.814180929095355

And since you cannot connect with them, you don't care about how their lives are going. The acting is pretty solid, it's not their fault, I'm sure it's just the material. Just another book that doesn't live up to its expectations on the big screen. It's nice to see the depths of Spacey, as his portrayal of the bumbling Quoyle is believable.",1028419200,3,502,4.527472527472527
1700130,5,B0000640VK,"I had heard and read so many negative reviews of this film that it took me some time to break down and rent the DVD.  I am glad I did.
For some time, I've been put off Kevin Spacey who seemed like he was about to make a career in films in which he predominantly ""smirked"" in a performance, BUT in this film, Spacey shows what a fine actor he can be.  As I watched ""The Shipping News,"" I began to realize that what separated me from the negative reviewers was basic and significant: I am not in love with my own cynicism.
The Shipping News as a novel was long and tedious, poetic, yet lacking in tension and dynamic.  As a film, it has been dramatized and life breathed into the stories by the excellent actors, screenwriter, and director.  As a film, I believe to appreciate it, the viewer has to have been in the shoes and lived some of what the characters have lived through, yet survived.  Have you ever felt people ignored you because you were boring?  Or shunned you because of something ""bad"" that happened to you, through no fault of your own?  Have you ever hoped for a ""second chance"" at life?  Then you'll identify with this film.
The stark nature of Newfoundland, in all its pitiless weather and beauty, is a rich character in the film, too, so if you think of yourself only as a cosmopolitan city-dweller who believes ""country folk"" are buffons and simpletons, you'll see nothing to entertain you in The Shipping News.  Or if you're the type to whom films are just explosions, special effects, and faked sex, ignore this film.  However, if you have something left of a poetic soul, if you still yearn for the hope that the spirit can be healed by adversity and the support of those around you, if you believe that given a little help from friends and your own determination, you CAN build a life for yourself---then see this film.",1028419200,7,1842,4.439169139465875
1700131,5,B0000640VK,"My husband and I watched Shipping News and thought it was well done, well acted, and very interesting. Kevin Spacey played a character which was very different from the ones that he usually portrays and we thought he was excellent in the part. My grandmother was born in Newfoundland so that made the movie even more enjoyable for me. I liked the movie so much that I would watch it again. I sincerely thought that Kevin Spacey was perfect for the part that he played. The rest of the characters were well portrayed and you can't go wrong with Gordon Pinsent - perfect as ever.  It was very interesting to watch Kevin Spacey going through the different phases of his character from beaten-down boy to accepted and beloved adult.  I do love happy endings!",1027296000,3,754,4.619402985074627
1700132,5,B0000640VK,"Director Lasse Halstrom continues to prove himself to be outstanding at presenting sensitive human dramas with this touching film about a broken man's retreat to his ancestral roots.  This poignant tale unwinds deliberately and delicately as each of the main characters shares his or her dark secrets buried in the past.
Halstrom is an inspired actors' director who entices outstanding performances from his troupe.  He has a wonderful ability to make simple characters appear bigger than life.  I continue to admire his unobtrusive presentation, forgoing ostentatious directorial stylizing in favor of simple shots that let the story and the characters dominate.  The cinematography and choice of locations in this film are understated and lovely without the need for garishness.
The acting is superb.  Kevin Spacey, as Quoyle, once again shows his range, taking on an emotionally crippled character that is quite unlike the confident and clever characters that jump off his resume.  Spacey relinquishes all traces of the cockiness that is his trademark and brilliantly renders a pathetic nebbish whose greatest daily struggle is to overcome his own ennui.  For Spacey to suppress his natural dynamism to slip this character on so effectively is a testimony to his excellence as an actor.
While this is clearly Spacey's film, the supporting cast of accomplished veterans weaves a splendid tapestry.  Julianne Moore is excellent as Quoyle's love interest with a delicate portrayal of a character that is simultaneously supportive and insecure.  Judi Dench is marvelous as Quoyle's crusty old aunt, who drags him back to Newfoundland to find himself among the ashes of his unseemly clan.  Cate Blanchett is bodacious as the impulsive vamp who ravishes Quoyle and stays with him only long enough to give him a daughter.  Scott Glenn is terrific as the cantankerous publisher of the local newspaper who turns Quoyle from a typesetter into a reporter.
This film is not for everyone.  It is extremely deliberate and will fray the patience of the average viewer.  However, for those who have a love of human interest stories with flawed but lovable characters, this will be a treat.  I rated it a 9/10.  It is a gem of human foibles and interactions that is moving and insightful.",1026950400,5,2274,5.1580381471389645

1700189,4,B0000640VK,"The Shipping News chronicles the healing of Quoyle, a passively pathetic nobody who, with his young daughter, leaves New York for the Newfoundland of his ancestors after his wildly irresponsible wife Petal (a shockingly different Cate Blanchett) dies in a car crash with one of her paramours.
Kevin Spacey turns in an excellent performance as the fleshy-faced, bumbling, meek and hollow Quoyle. (In fact, it may be more accurate to say the film tells of Quoyle's creation--the man-child who survived his abusive upbringing seems almost nonexistent as opposed to broken.) Julianne Moore is tenderly, simply beautiful as Quoyle's love interest, perhaps giving her finest performance. Judi Dench , as Quoyle's aunt who rescues him from New York, is just good enough, though lacking somehow. The cinematography, featuring the rock, water and snow of the North Atlantic, is generally well done.
Much of the accented dialogue is difficult to understand at first, as is the plot unless one pays careful attention to the various dream sequences and impressionistic flashbacks which fill in the Quoyle family history. I will say that, several chapters into the novel, the film seems better, more direct, not thrown off balance by the author's ""clever"", continuous elimination of complete sentences and bombardment of similes and metaphors--which worked for the first couple of chapters but is now proving tedious. (And the film actually has one detail ""right"": if Petal came to detest Quoyle so much and only conceived their first child by accident, it's hard to see where a second would have come from. In the film, having but one daughter strengthens the character; in the book, the extra dulls the impact of both.) I cannot say for certain that I will finish the book.
In all, 3-1/2 stars is about right for this film. Recommended if you're looking for something quirky and ""fresh.""",1026604800,9,1876,5.133986928104576
1700190,3,B0000640VK,"The Shipping News movie has the misfortune to be based on a beautiful, slightly odd novel that is difficult to adapt to film. The main shortcomings of the movie are what's lost in translation. The events seem compressed and rushed, taking place impossibly quickly compared to the book's spread-out pace. Anguish is brief and redemption seems relatively cheap; just wait around for a few scenes and everything will work out.
Even if you haven't read the book, the movie may not be for you. Scott Glenn's Newfie accent lapses so often it's distracting. In fact, everyone's accent is distracting, and it makes it harder to take the characters seriously as people, not caricatures. And everything happens so quickly it's hard to summon enough emotional investment to care about the twists, when they happen.
There are some redeeming qualities. The scenery is beautiful. Kevin Spacey, Julianne Moore, and Rhys Ifans (unfortunately underused) turn in nice performances. There are a few scenes that shine with simple honesty. Unfortunately, though, not enough.",1026172800,3,1053,5.236686390532545
1700191,2,B0000640VK,"One would think Lasse Hallstrm could easily produce a winner with a cast such as that of ""The Shipping News"" but for some reason this film seems lacking strength and cohesiveness.  Performances by Spacey and Moore (both of whom never disappoint) are in top form and Blanchette delivers a strong character as well (though it borders on melodrama at a few points).  Hallstrm's direction, while not quite as sharp as in ""Chocolat"", resonates more consistently than with ""Cider House Rules"" (a real hit-and-miss film) but ultimately does not bring a superior cinematic work out of the story.  The repetition of the drowning theme is a predictable and trite device made more unbearable by its inconsistent meaning(s).  The use of a voice-over narrative stutters the film's beginning and end rather than punctuate them.  Dench's Eve-figure is hackneyed to the point of being totally ineffective and her performance left one to wonder if the use of shots from further back are to create distance or to just avoid placing any emphasis at all on her miserable body-language and painted-on sneer.  And frequently (with respect to dialogue as a narrative convention) we find the film emerging as obfuscatingly oblique instead of subtle.  This, combined with an unresolved ending (and we're not talking unresolved in the post-modern sense, more like ""so....?"" sense) leaves one disappointed and still searching for a reason to enjoy it.  The ""point"" of the story/film is certainly a positive one but you've got to get over its iceberg tip to get there.

1700192,3,B0000640VK,"The Shipping News is based on Annie Prouix's Pullitzer prize-winning novel. It tells the story of a broken man, a lonely man who has been undermined since childhood. Quoyle (played by Kevin Spacey) is in a dead-end job as a typesetter for the Poughkeepsie News in New York when he meets and marries Petal. Marriage and even his role of Father fail to change or lift Quoyle. It is only after both his Wife and Father die and he is persuaded by his long lost aunt (played by Dame Judi Dench) to move back to his ancestral home in Newfoundland in Canada that a process of change within Quoyle begins.
It's by no means all plain sailing! Quoyle finds out many secrets about his past and the small community he now lives amongst as he settles into the community.
Though the backdrop of Newfoundland is bleak  (though beautiful) the story itself becomes less so after the move. We see Quoyle begin to gain strength and confidence when supported by friends, family and neighbours. Where before he was frightened to tell his daughter simply that her mother was dead he now feels able to do so. He begins to come to terms with the ""unfinished business"" of his childhood.

1700194,5,B0000640VK,"I've been watching this director's films since when he was a European film director, starting with his wonderful ""My Life As A Dog.""  I was worried when he started making American films because I thought he'd turn into another action adventure director, which is what we tend to do with Europe's best directing talent. However, Hallstr&ouml;m has continued to make serious, artistic films in the ensuing years and I, for one, am grateful.  I've never seen a film of his that didn't totally engross me and this one is no exception.  I tried reading the novel upon which this is based and I put it down time and time again.  Finally, I gave up on it as too literary.  So I was very happy that I could watch the movie straight through without any hangups from its source Pulitzer prize winning novel.

Kevin Spacey is the main character and we follow his life from being a nerd in New York with a wife (Cate Blanchett) who is gorgeous but a real low life.  When she dies in a car wreck, his aunt (Judi Densch) talks him into moving to Newfoundland with her and his daughter to reinvent his life.  He does so as a newspaper reporter there.  There is also a lot of magical realism and mysticism going on in this movie, which I found very absorbing, plus humor.  Scott Glenn plays one of his best roles ever as the irascible newspaper owner, Jack, and he provides great comic relief for the film. Every actor in this film gives an A performance.  It is a dream cast and I can't imagine casting it differently.  If you are not already a fan of Hallstr&ouml;m's work, you should be.  I bought this movie the instant I saw his name on it.

Well, it must have been a very thick book, as it seems he had way too much material out there. None of the characters were fully developed. We have Spacey whimpering around making baby-sounds and the tone of his voice was exactly as he spoke -under hypnosis in K-Pak . He actually , at times reminded me of a mentally challenged person, the way he carried himself, the way he walked and the way he talked. Granted he had some reason to act strange with a father like he had. Emotionally drained,he was! And I think the scene's with Pedal should have been dumped and the rescue of Jason Behr (Dennis Buggit) by his father Scott Glenn (Jack Buggit) woulf have made a more adventuresome footage.
I felt like the house they were dragging over the ice-Come on-come on, shake it, lets go. And the scene with Judi Dench putting her brother's ashes down the one-seater in the out-house could sum-up my feelings regarding the whole film.
The cinematography was spectacular, but there was way to much to deal with, and I laughed out-right when Scott Glenn came back to life after the sea claiming him as the curse of the Buggit's called for-as they were carting him off in the ambulance, he tells Jason,(Dennis) ""son ,I have broken the curse, and now you can have your fishing licence"", the camera catches Jason and the look on his face was not happiness.

1700197,4,B0000640VK,"This movie followed the bones of the book fairly closely -- if I had not read the book I might not have noticed all of the (to me) important parts that were missing. Much of the background detail about the characters' lives was such an integral part of the story that leaving it out made me feel like behind-the-scenes developments were being concealed from the audience. And then it just....ended--very awkwardly, with no conclusion. I am just wondering if maybe some books are too emotionally complex to be made into a movie.
As another reviewer said, the director just touched on so many things without any detail about them. I think this movie would have been wonderful if it had been longer. And with such a great cast, I think that audiences would have appreciated it.
I also thought that Kevin Spacey was terribly miscast as Quoyle - his looks just did not fit at all. What could the casting director have been thinking? And although I usually love his acting, in this film it seemed that he played Quoyle, at times, as dimwitted/mentally challenged, soft and cuddly, not at all like the Quoyle of the book.
Almost all of the characters in the movie were quirky and odd, but I do not remember getting that same sense from the book. Different, yes. And some were odd. But not all. It was as though in the movie, only certain characteristics were revealed, leaving anything vaguely normal about the characters on the pages of the book or on the cutting room floor.
The scenery was magnificent and its grimness and wild beauty reflected the inner struggles and remoteness of the characters. The cinematography alone made the movie worth watching. The locale was probably the most important ""character"" in the film.

I'm becoming a Kevin Spacey fan because he seems so different in his characters.  Quoyle is different than KPAX or American Beauty.  Yet, Spacey fills the screen and captures our interest while looking like Gene Hackman's son.  Judy Dench is another tremendous star.  The added DVD materials are helpful as the director tells how he pictured her for this film while working with her on Chocolat.  The moment where she throws her brother's ashes down the outhouse hole is worth the price.  Blanchett and Moore turn in top notch portrayals.

A movie is a different medium, and the story has to be told differently.
What matters is what *is* in this movie, and what is there, makes this unmissable. The stellar cast is wonderful, but what I loved the most was the way it totally *captured* a part of the world that pretty much no other film would even attempt to portray: the northeast. Very few filmmakers try, and none have succeeded like this film.
I was born and raised in Maine, and I found it welcomed me like home: the people, the accents, the life. New York critics thought it made the locals look like yokels, but the people of Newfoundland were *thrilled* with the movie, and how it portrayed them.

As someone who did read the book before seeing the movie, I had an odd feeling that Lasse Hallstrom was perhaps trying a little too hard to be ""faithful"" to his source material.  He made a very concerted effort to touch on every important plot point -- but he didn't give any of them the chance to breathe.  He didn't have time; he had several more plot points to hit before his two hours were up.
This film was crafted by a wonderful director with a stellar cast.  It made me wish, more than anything, that an American audience would have paid money for the three hour version.  Another 60 minutes of film would have made the entire experience 120 times richer.

Think about it.  I, for one, do not.  If I did not read the book (or even if I did) then why should I care if it was better than the film adapted from it.  To me it's like saying the screenplay was better than the movie.  General audiences do not read screenplays.  It only matters what is on the screen.  The book is not the movie.  It is just where the idea for the movie came from.  I am saying all this because every review I have read about this film has come with the caption, the book was better.  Hurray, good for the book.  However this is why I was not expecting much when I saw The Shipping News, but I thought Lasse Hallstrom is a good director and the cast is very good, could it be that bad?  Not only is this movie not bad, but it is quite good.  This is why I hate reading reviews before I see movies, and why, in general, I can't stand critics.  Why didn't anybody see this film?  Probably because some critic said, ""the book was better.""  The critic probably didn't even read it.
The Shipping News tells the tale of a guy who goes way down on his luck, and finds redeption in the most unlikely of places.  It tells it well.  There area lot of characters in this story.  The names are familiar too, Cate Blanchett, Judi Dench, Scott Glen, Julianne Moore, and Kevin Spacey.  They are all very good.  Of course the story revolves around Spacey's character Quoyle, but each of the supporting players has their own role to play to flesh out different aspects of Quoyle.  I thought it was done quite effectively.
Every now and then a movie just strikes me.  This happened with The Shipping News.  I just related to it, and I enjoyed it.  I could bore readers with the whys, but really there are plenty of other reviews to read if you want a more objective opinion about this film.  I don't feel like beating this one to death.  I just liked it.
By the way, if you enjoyed this film I reccomend checking out other films by Lasse Hallstrom.  I have enjoyed every film of his I have seen (just click on his name in the box to the left).  Happy viewing.",1019952000,6,2236,4.1905882352941175
1700224,3,B0000640VK,"My three star review does not mean just three, but a negative three.  The film is good, but it hardly reaches the height of the director Lasse Hallstrom's other projects.  But, before you say something in return, let me explain.
""The Shipping News"" has merits of its own, and that's clear from the beginning: its cast attached to the film, and the stunningly beautiful locations of Newfoundland.  Kevin Spacy is a good actor, I know, and he proves it with his heartfelt performance of Quoyle, a born loser, who finds his new life with his daughter.  Equally good is Julianne Moore, who is not afraid of showing her character's frail side with little make-up possible.  This film also boasts the participation of Judi Dench, Pete Postlethwaite, Scott Glenn, and Cate Blanchett.  Oh, and don't miss that Rhys Ifans can play a normal character, and he is good, too.
And the story, simple as it is, has strong power to universally appeal to everyone's heart.  Quoyle of the protagonist redeems his lost dignity and love as a human being in the new situation given as a chance to him, writing ""The Shipping News"" for the local paper.  With the mystrious history of his family and the land itself, the story unfolds steadily, describing Quoyle's heart once hopelessly broken by his previous marriage.  And you see the beautiful, but stern nature of Newfoundland, which tests the personality of him and all people surrounding him.  Whatever you think of as a solemn drama about humanity, you find it here.
However, as everyone knows, the critical responce to ""The Shipping News"" is not exactly kind so far, compared with excellent ""The Cider House Rules"" and lovely ""Chocolat.""  The reason is, as far as I can guess, very simple.  ""The Shipping News"" is too cold.  Not cold-hearted, but it LOOKS very cold.  Of course, it is shot in Newfoundland, but that's not the point.  The point is, we got no chance to get to the heart of each character -- Wavey, Agnis, Tert, Jack Buggit, Nutbeem.  We know they have their own past while the film introduces them to us, but not enough emotional power is charged before the film goes on.  What is worse is, the sorrows and pains of them seem to be thrown into the film without being connected to Quoyle's character, whose family has its own history to be revealed.  All these episodes look jumbled in the film, which, on top of  them, depicts a deadly car accident and a beheaded man's body.  The film, in other words, shows everything to confuse its point; it looks at the past and the present; looks at grim reality and mythical history.  But it doesn't look at its heart, people.
Though her acting is superb, Cate Blanchett is given too short screen time in the film; her character, unfaithful, spitfire wife of Quoyle, is very much missed after she is gone, because, though her character is flawed much, the film knows what it wants to be while she is on the screen.  In ""The Cide House Rules"" and ""Chocolat,"" the principal characters knew what they were doing; they are also flawed, but they lived thier life, and their portraits suggested life-affirming attitudes, which have been respected director Hallstrom's trademark.
This attitude, I am afraid, seems to be buried among the cold  nature of the locations.  We don't see people's life; instead, we see a glimpse of their past, which is all shady and dark.  I know the film's intention, and I respect it, but the film is too somber to me for all its good intention.  Sorry, but if I must travel to somewhere with a broken heart, I prefer the chocolate shop of ""Chocolat.""
Kevin Spacy's daughter Bunny is played by a triple -- Alyssa Gainer, Kaitlyn Gainer and Lauren Gainer.  Did you notice that?",1017187200,7,3687,4.702492211838006

""Chocolat"" and ""Cider House Rules"" were both top-notch films and anyone who appreciated these two films will love ""Shipping News.""  Like ""Cider"" the new film is riveting -- it meanders in completely unpredictable directons, arriving at quite believable and endlessly fascinating destinations.  While watching, I was continually struck by the thought ""Man, this is a VERY GOOD film.""
  No one can quibble with the wonderful choice of settings, sometimes lush, sometimes stark, always captivating and believable.  The acting is across-the-board excellent.  Cate Blanchett will astonish you!  Julianne Moore is completely breath-taking and never misses a beat.  Kevin Spacey is remarkable, as usual.  There are also innumerable supporting cast members, all of whom are quite effective.

1700226,3,B0000640VK,"My friend Katie and I really were supposed to see something else, but it was sold out. ""What about The Shipping News?"", she proposed. I hadn't heard of it, but so what? I agreed, especially when I learned that Judi Densch was in it. She's like the female equivalent of Gene Hackman: always turns in a reliable performance.
This is a strange story, about an extremely passive, put-upon man who honestly believes the lines a trollopy Cate Blanchett uses on him, and marries her. Even after their daughter is born, she continues picking up men while he just hangs about, not conjuring up her or the audience's respect. Then, wham! Lots of intense personal tragedy for Kevin Spacey, with the upshot being that he heads out with newfound aunt Judi to Newfoundland, the place of the family's origin. Seems just about everyone in town--the aunt, Kevin's new girlfriend, you name it--has more than one skeleton in the closet. Kevin even learns about a REALLY big problem with his own deceased dad, not to mention his evil forbears. So in the end, everyone's got an armoire of dirty linen which all gets aired. Along the way, Kevin gains more self-confidence with his various revelations.
Highly atmospheric, interesting scenery of an inhospitable place. Quirky characters abound, Cate leading the pack. Not the best thing I""ve seen lately, but certainly not bad.",1012780800,3,1354,4.91703056768559

The lesson it takes Quoyle, the central character of ""The Shipping News,"" almost a lifetime to learn. Of course we, as an audience, can already pinpoint the film's moral message, given the fact that this is a character-based meller with plenty of saccharine sentiment and gorgeous cinematography. The surprise here is the director, Lasse Hallstrm, instills the film with enough interest to keep it afloat, with a little help from his cast along the way.
The film stars Kevin Spacey against type as Quoyle, a boy whose life has been shaped by the years of physical and emotional torment at the hands of his father. Life as Quoyle experiences it is simple and colorless, until he crosses paths with Petal (Cate Blanchett), a drifter who happens into his life one day and becomes his everything. This woman is a class act: she stays out late while a despondent Quoyle remains home with their daughter, Bunny, all the while pleading with Petal to give their marriage another try.
One momentous day, Quoyle receives word of his father's death, and returns home from the funeral to find Petal and Bunny gone from his life. Enter Agnis Hamm (Judi Dench), his aunt from his father's side who has stopped by to pay her respects on her way back to Newfoundland, where their family's ancestry lies. After news of Petal's death and the return of Bunny, Quoyle makes the decision to travel to Newfoundland with Agnis in hopes of regaining some semblance of order in life once again.
Once the story makes the transition to the coldly atmospheric coast of Newfoundland, more characters are introduced, more of Quoyle's family history is revealed, much to the silent dismay of Agnis, who would rather keep the wrongdoings of her family hidden from view. Quoyle attain a job at the local newspaper, makes good with editor Jack Buggit (Scott Glenn), who takes a liking to the fact that his work stirs up interest in the town; later, he awards Quoyle his own weekly column. As Quoyle makes his rounds, he meets interesting faces, and takes a liking to the local daycare operator, Wavey Prowse (Julianne Moore), a conserved woman with a young boy who suffers from minor mental defects.
The movie has two main things going for it: its cast and its wonderfully dense appearance. As Quoyle, Spacey is required to express emotion through words and facial expression, and achieves both very convincingly despite the lack of development of his character. Dench does well in portraying Agnis as reserved and quiet, while Moore shows a great deal of warmth and emotion; both actresses succeed in keeping us mystified by their characters' pasts, making the revelations more impacting and heartfelt. Various actors, including Glenn, Jason Behr, Pete Postlethwaite and more, play the local townsfolk very well; also worth mentioning is the short-lived but effectively chilling performance from Blanchett, who proves her versatility as an actress in portraying Petal as one of the lowest forms of life.
The look of ""The Shipping News"" is nothing short of breathtaking, containing its fair share of beautiful vistas that evoke the grandeur and beauty of Newfoundland. Seeing this film's setting unfold reminded me of such films as ""The Horse Whisperer"" and ""Snow Falling on Cedars,"" where the setting plays a role in the film. Here, the same type of approach is applied, and succeeds for the most part in grabbing our attention in between character development.
So what's the purpose of it all? Well, as far as I can tell, it's a coming-to-grips story in which people realize their fears and their hidden secrets and make peace with their inner torments. However, it seems that everyone but the intended character achieves this: both Agnis and Wavey face a part of their past they have long since ignored, while Buggit, after a near-death experience, reconciles with his son. Even little Bunny accepts her mother's death, but Quoyle himself spends more time helping these people deal with their emotional grief rather than devoting time to dealing with his own. One might gather that through helping those around him, Quoyle is making his own realization, which comes at the movie's weirdly cut-off ending.
Maybe he does, maybe he doesn't. One could argue that the lack of developing his character does not merit this deduction about his coming-to-grips with life. Even still, Hallstrm keeps all of this moving at a pace where no one in the audience is required to put much thought into what they see, providing us a movie where one can simply relax and enjoy the experience. This is somewhat similar of one of his previous films, ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" which derived its complexity through its simplistic approach. And while ""The Shipping News"" may not be as complex as some of Hallstrm's previous efforts, his many artistic touches are felt throughout much of this acceptably melodramatic landscape of self-realization.",1011657600,8,5018,4.9537366548042705
1700268,1,B0000640VK,"This film has a great cast of course, and Judi Dench does the most, as does Cate Blanchet. The rest are at sea in this melodramatic mess that has about as much credibility as Cider House Rules, diredcted by the same director. There are no characters here and the situations they are in or have been in are so false to the ear and eye, so Hallmark Card and it is filled with laughable revelations of the past that include incest and abortion, told in loud voices, with hilarious flashbacks, reminiscent of ""serious"" television.
Nothing has strength beacuse the director has no intelligence, nor does this dreary screenplay from a terrible novel, full of shock and schlock.
Julianne Moore is lovely and so talented; how did she get ionto this fray? Kevin Spacey is always good, but here he is really bad.

1700269,5,B0000640VK,"Rarely does a movie adhere to a book's story as well as Shipping News does to Annie Proulx' sparkling literary masterpiece, a novel about time, place, traditions and love.
The big lump of a main character, Quoyle, a sad, pathetic man (Kevin Spacey) is defined by a metaphor deftly recreated in this film: He cannot swim. As the movie opens, we find that he cannot do much of anything else either.
The inksetter for a Poughkeepsie newspaper drives into a gas station in the pouring rain and witnesses a lovers' quarrel between the driver and passenger in the first car. He doesn't get gas. A split-second courtship instigated by Petal (Cate Blanchett) saddles Quoyle with a disastrous marriage--and his child, Bunny--and ends more disastrously than it began. But Quoyle, lump that he is, unwinds after Petal leaves the picture and his parents die.
Quoyle's Aunt Agnes arrives, ostensibly to pay her respects, but with a caper in mind. Our befuddled man Quoyle leaves with her for his family's dilapidated homestead on Newfoundland's Quoyle point. The house, tied down with steel stays, appears like the ruin of Quoyle's life, and as the story unfolds it becomes clear that the sense of ruin plaguing him may be familial.
But Quoyle surprises viewers and himself as he reclaims his life. Hired to cover car accidents, he earns the respect of the paper's cranky fisherman owner, Jack Buggit, who shocks the staff when he assigns Quoyle a weekly column on the shipping news. Quoyle has no experience, but he his new friends teach him to think in headlines, providing welcome comic relief.
Like parents everywhere, Quoyle finds a friend in another parent, Wavey (Julianne Moore). The friendship takes several interesting turns.
Quoyle is haunted by flashbacks of his own life, and to events that occurred before he was born. The film's triumph, like that of Proulx' book, is in Quoyle's steadfast determination to overcome these seemingly insurmountable odds. The film's Newfoundland (like that in the book) appears dead. But as Quoyle lays the past to rest, both he and the town come to life.
Lasse Hallstrm aptly directed this film, whose score provides delight on a par with Quoyle's Shipping News headlines. Alyssa A. Lappen",1010102400,40,2223,4.994609164420485
1700270,4,B0000640VK,"Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) is a middle age man lacking in self esteem who is living a banal and unrewarding existence.  One is reminded of Thomas Hobbes' famous aphorism that men often are doomed to endure lives of quiet desperation.  He falls in love with Petal Bear (Cate Blanchett) only hours after they meet who does nothing to hide her manipulative dark side.  They have a daughter Bunny and this selfish woman proves totally lacking in compassion and loyalty to the both of them.  The movie industry has rarely put on the screen a more despicable mother in its entire history.  It is regretful that Blanchett will not likely receive an Academy Award nomination for her too short time in this film.
The very promiscuous Petal Bear is ultimately found dead in a car accident with a new boy friend.  Quoyle's Aunt Agnis (Judi Dench) entices him and Bunny to move back to their ancestral home located in Newfoundland.  This is a part of Canada that the tourists make sure they don't visit.  Summertime in May is dreary and the life of the locals indeed echoes the previously cited Hobbes as awful, brutish, and short.  Death seems to constantly be lurking in the water and on the treacherously icy roads.  People do not aspire to financial affluence, but a life that is barely one step ahead of grinding poverty.  The publisher of "" The Shipping News"" Jack Buggit (admirably performed by Scott Glenn) offers Quoyle a job as a reporter, a position that our protagonist appears totally unqualified to handle.  Lo and behold, however, Quoyle admirably grows into his new employment responsibilities and begins the process of evolving into a man of respect and dignity.  A mother with a mentally impaired young son drifts into Quoyle's life.  Julianne More portrays Wavey in a manner lacking authenticity.  Never for a moment does she come across as a woman whose only option is to remain in such an abysmally hopeless environment.
Quoyle eventually finds out that it sometimes might not be best to learn about the past.  His family tree is filled with dysfunctional and evil members.  Nonetheless,  these scenes of Quoyle finding his roots make the film worth while.  I have not read the novel ""The Shipping News"" is based upon.  Therefore, I can only speak about what is actually on the screen.  This film doesn't deserve a five star rating, but it's sufficiently good that I recommend all Kevin Spacey fans make a point of seeing it. Spacey is one of the premier actors of his era, and by himself virtually guarantees an enjoyable movie going experience.  He once again delivers the goods.",1009843200,32,2585,4.800904977375565
1700271,5,B0000640VK,"Although many recollect CHOCOLAT as Lass Hallstrom's ""classic"" film, longtime fans are more likely to connect THE SHIPPING NEWS with his earlier film MY LIFE AS A DOG. Hallstrom has a gift for eliciting excellent performances from children and oddballs living in northern climates. Like Ingmar in the older ""foreign"" film from Sweden, Quoyle has much to learn about being an adult.
THE SHIPPING NEWS is a beautiful psychological study about the transformation of a damaged man into a whole human being. NEWS  reinforces the truth most of us already know -- unconditional love can heal. The most telling line of the story is spoken by Juliette Moore when she says that when she was at her lowest point, the people in her Newfoundland village lifted her up with their love.
I read THE SHIPPING NEWS (which one the Pulitzer) and I laughed until I cried. It is probably the most humorous book I have ever read.  I took my husband who had not read the book with me to see the film and he said about 20 minutes into the film, I sure hope this thing gets happier. Those who have read NEWS know that the beginning is a bit sad but Annie Proulx makes Quoyle's travails hysterically funny. There are some funny moments in the film, and the film is quite faithful to the book, but the film is not the book, and it is not quite as funny. Words on the page do not always translate easily to film.
Still, Hallstrom and his multi-talented cast have done a wonderful job which is why I have given the film 5 stars. Judy Dench is clearly ""on loan"" from her portrayal of Iris Murdock where you can see her in IRIS beginning in mid-January. Her enactment of Quoyle's Aunt Agnes Hamm is quite accurate -- at least she matches the picture I formed in my head when I read NEWS.
Juliette Moore is perfect as Quoyle's love interest. I love Kevin Spacey, but this is not my favorite Spacy role. He definintly plays against type in this film. As Quoyle, his charcter is closer to the fellow he played in THE USUSAL SUSPECTS than the suave con man he plays in LA CONFIDENTIAL, MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF EVIL, SWIMMING WITH SHARKS, or GLEN GARRY GLEN ROSS. If you ONLY like the smart sophisticated Spacy you may be a bit disappointed.
When Spacey won his OSCAR for best actor, he said ""Thank you Jack Lemmon where ever you are.""  You'll find the ghost of Jack Lemmon in THE SHIPPING NEWS.",1009843200,68,2360,4.470997679814385

1700273,3,B0000640VK,"In his previous films (THE USUAL SUSPECTS, AMERICAN BEAUTY, K-PAX, etc.), actor Kevin Spacey has played pretty much the sharpest knife in the drawer. In THE SHIPPING NEWS, Spacey is Quoyle, a dull man with the cutting edge of a plastic butter knife.
Quoyle is an ink loader for a local rag, the Poughkeepsie News. One day, he has the great good luck to score with the local tramp, Petal (Cate Blanchett). Then follows the enormous bad luck to impregnate and marry her. Now, Quoyle's raises his six-year old daughter Bunny while Petal continues to troll for studs. She even brings her lovers home, a practice that would enrage most husbands, but not the meek and lovesick Quoyle. Early on in the film, Quoyle is beset with a series of mind-numbing personal tragedies that result in his Aunt Agnis showing up on the doorstep. She convinces her nephew to bring himself and Bunny to Newfoundland, their ancestral place of origin, to start a new life. Quoyle's great effort to see this through despite a heavy load of emotional and psychological baggage is the essence of the movie. Along the way, Quoyle gets a correspondent's job to report THE SHIPPING NEWS - and thus the film's title - for the town paper despite the chief editor's comment that he hasn't the sense God gave a donut.
The movie was filmed in Newfoundland (and Nova Scotia), so the scenery is fabulous if you like cold, windswept, rocky shores. Unfortunately, the best performances are by relatively minor characters, Jack Buggitt (Scott Glenn) as the chief editor of the Gammy Bird, and Petal. Cate Blanchett as the latter is on screen for way too short a time, and is almost unrecognizable in her role as the bimbo that enthralls. Judi Dench as Agnis is predictably competent, but her great talent is so effortless that she must absolutely shine to stand out, and she doesn't here. Daughter Bunny is used simply as the occasional walk-on prop, and could've been eliminated from the script entirely. As the new woman in Quoyle's new life, Julianne Moore as Wavey doesn't call up whatever passion would seem necessary to re-ignite our hero's fire. (I'd forgotten, though, how attractive Ms. Moore can be in a cold sort of way.)
I can't say that this film isn't pleasant or entertaining. It's both; the cast is too good to fail miserably. However, every story needs conflict, and Quoyle's battle with his inner demons never reaches a fever pitch, nor does it necessarily stand out from the internal conflicts being waged by Agnis and Wavey. At the conclusion, I got the impression that whatever Quoyle gained he got by default rather than having to really work at it. The Quoyle persona was just too much of a milquetoast, and Spacey was, in my opinion, miscast.",1009670400,3,2724,4.773305084745763

Being in many book clubs, I have seen to it that this work was always on the reading list.  Whoever I recommended it to, thanked me profusely.  It is such a touching story with the characters being developed in such a way, that you felt you were living  thier hard life amongst them.  Especially Quoyle who was always hiding his ""monstrous"" chin behind his hand, a gesture suggesting his insecurities about who he was and what he was doing.  No way did this movie give the viewer this feeling.  First of all, Kevin Spacey did not fit the part.  It called for a very large, bulky, obese man, something that can't be achieved by layering clothing.  As described in the book, Quoyle was so unsure of everything he did that it made the reader want to reach out to help him, for fear he would make a fool of himself.  Then there was Bunny, a very unhappy, angry little girl who had no respect for her father and took every opportunity to let him know this.  Judy Dench's part was probably the truest character with her mannerisms matching closest to those described in the book.  All in all, a beautiful Pulitzer Prize winning novel was put to shame on the screen.  It's sad that this happens so often.",1009497600,3,1316,4.456066945606694

In the past ten years I have visited for the first time to discover my roots. And realized I had inheirited some land from my grandparents. I had thought about going up there after finishing school here in Atlanta GA, to spend some time there fixing up the auld place. A cousin recomended I read this book called, ""The Shipping News,"" which I did, and loved it. The story somewhat reminded me of my own journey. Except for the crazed wife, and I don't have any kids. A lot of the locals had warned me that this book was based on a small portion of the populas, and in no way a representation of Newfoundland. Well after spending five summers there, I think it is very close to how it is, but I could never reveal this to the family.

The funny thing is I have such a southern accent, yet I understood every word I heard, even from the most remote parts of the island.

Although it is like a step back in time, I felt as if I belonged there, and from the time I left, I have thought of how I could go back and live.

1700276,4,B0000640VK,"This adaptation of an Annie Proulx novel finds Kevin Spacey playing a passive, bewildered man at loose ends after his faithless, self-absorbed wife (Cate Blanchett) is killed running off with a lover, leaving him with their six-year old daughter. His recently deceased father's younger half-sister (Dame Judi Dench) appears on his doorstep and talks him into relocating to Newfoundland, their ancestral home.
The bulk of the story takes place on the wild Canadian coast, forming a spectacular backdrop for this tale of wounded souls slowly healing themselves. In a new job as reporter for the tiny community's newspaper, Spacey slowly blossoms as he is drawn to a widow (Julianne Moore) whose husband drowned under mysterious circumstances. The theme of dark past secrets uncovered runs through the various incidents, with Dench confronting her traumatic past as well. The script is well-written and the performances for the most part carefully calibrated, eventually drawing the viewer in. Surprisingly enough, it is Spacey who comes off least well. Quoyle, his character, should be emotionally shell-shocked, not simple-minded, but in the early portion of the film the actor comes off as a first cousin to Forrest Gump, quite overawed by Blanchett, who makes the most of her rather underwritten part. Other supporting roles are strongly cast as well, particularly the durable Scott Glenn as a crusty newspaper editor and fisherman.",1009411200,11,1433,5.373333333333333
1700277,4,B0000640VK,"To be honest, I don't think I was expecting all that much at first from ""The Shipping News"" -- at least not after the week before, when I'd been pretty much wholly underwhelmed by ""Vanilla Sky."" If anything, I was probably looking forward to the kind of movie that I'd begin to forget about sometime between the walk back to the parking lot and the drive back home, the kind that I could write off to anyone who was interested just by saying, ""It was cute."" As it happened, though, I got much more than all that from this movie. To me, it felt like ducking into a restaurant alone for a quick bite to eat and getting not only a full meal but a good conversation with the waitress as well.

Of course, that could be the case because the idea of getting more nourishment than bargained for is the motif behind this movie, too. Kevin Spacey plays Quoyle, a simple, marginalized man employed as an inksetter for the local paper in Poughkeepsie. He chances to meet Petal (an eye-opening Cate Blanchett), a somewhat slutty type who usurps, seduces and dupes Quoyle into marrying her. Granted, Quoyle is so blindly faithful that Petal doesn't even bother to disguise her own infidelity -- not even after their daughter, Bunny, is born -- so the time inevitably comes when she leaves both of them behind forever. Thrown into a sputter by losing her, as well as both his parents (to suicide), Quoyle relocates with Bunny to his family's ancestral home in Newfoundland on the advice of his largely unknown aunt Agnis (Judi Dench, strong and steely as always), who visits to collect her brother's ashes for her own special memorial.

There, Quoyle finds that his name is widely known -- and not necessarily for the most glowing reasons, either. Looking for a production job at the paper in his new town, he instead finds himself hired as a reporter -- covering the shipping news, of course, as well as the car accidents -- and begins the long, difficult process of learning to become a journalist. He warms up to Wavey (an alluring and highly enigmatic Julianne Moore), the town's schoolteacher with a mentally deficient son and a lost spouse of her own. And, in general, the movie follows Quoyle as he attempts to build relationships and find a place for himself in a land where the stories and the legends were being told long before he was born.

Now, I haven't read the book by Proulx (although I definitely plan to read it now), but I imagine that it's somewhat of a saga. There are just so many details in this movie that seem collapsed in order to fit within a certain timeframe. Some of them even could have enough substance on their own to fill the central plot lines of other, more Hollywood-styled movies (including a few graphics depictions of death and dismemberment, although those may be deleted for the commercial release). However, here they're presented as mundane, almost everyday occurrences -- a stance that underscores quite effectively the fact that ""The Shipping News"" isn't a mundane, everyday movie at all. Lasse Hallstrm doesn't seem to have directed it so much as just to have let it develop naturally from its own rhythms. Kevin Spacey carries the movie awkwardly at first (I just read an interview with him saying that he began working on it days after ""K-Pax"" wrapped, so that may be why) but comes to blend into his role as effortlessly as everyone else does. The portrayals of the Newfoundlanders also have a concrete sense of time and place: They made me feel like a latecoming stranger in town during the first scenes, but the end of the movie just sneaked up on me like a good acquaintance suddenly saying good-bye. (And given that most of what I know of Newfoundlanders has come from hearing Canadians tell jokes about their violence, stupidity and incestuousness -- which all apparently have a grain of truth, according to this movie -- I felt a certain sense of admiration for them by the time it was over.)

""The Shipping News"" is a movie full of hardship, strife and uncertainty, but it's also a movie about the determination to keep certain traditions alive and even to build upon them. Given the social and political upheaval of 2001, I'd recommend it as a humble way to end off a year that most of us would like to forget but obviously never will. But even in a more personal sense, it's a wonderful movie to watch if you've lost a loved one, gotten laid off from work, have had a birthday that only reminds you of the year older or have plowed into any other kind of brick wall that leaves you reeling and not sure what to do next. As Agnis says when Quoyle tells her that he doesn't want to live in the past, ""You're not livin' in the past. . . . You're buildin' a future.""

Hollywood should take note of that kind of sentiment the next time they green-light a movie script based on a comic book.",1008979200,20,4831,4.573903002309469

If you are into literature, this movie is definitely for you. Fantastic cast, great story line and pretty good cinematography make this a movie worth watching.",1516233600,,310,4.654545454545454
7960035,4,B0000640VK,"The acting with this stellar cast obviously is excellent.  The film moves along slowly with the characters showing emotions or inner thoughts more by facial expression than vocalized.  Dench ropes you in, eager to know the implied dark secrets of the family returning to its ancestral beginnings. The New Foundland location lends a moody yet genuine folksy and believable feel to undesired revelations.  If you're looking for action, this film is not for you. If watching ordinary people afflicted by sordid events dealing with it, then you'll definitely enjoy this movie.",1509408000,,572,5.263736263736264
