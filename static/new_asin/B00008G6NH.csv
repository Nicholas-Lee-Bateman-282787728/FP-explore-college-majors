1844518,5,B00008G6NH,"I am the biggest Toxic Avenger fan. I can't get enough of Troma films. I have not yet seen the DVD edition of this movie. I have seen a promo copy on VHS that was sent to me by Troma last summer. I would have to say that Citizen Toxie is just as good as the first Toxic Avenger. I will admit that Toxic Avenger both 2 and 3 were somewhat disappointing, but Citizen Toxie is good all of the way through. Troma did not let me down with this one.
If you like the Toxic Avenger and if you have an appreciation for Troma films- you will love this release.",1049155200,2,550,3.963963963963964

1844609,3,B00008G6NH,Citizen Toxie is a much better movie than the other two sequels and although not fantastic has enough going for it.

1844610,1,B00008G6NH,This film is absolute garbage trash. It tries to say the other sequels are bad but THIS is the real sequel to 1984's The Toxic Avenger and that is insulting. 2 and 3 are not perfect but they blew this one away. Only true redeeming aspect of Citizen Toxie is Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD. He is trying so hard to save this disaster. Shame on Kaufman for this trash movie.,1463184000,,361,4.246376811594203

1844612,5,B00008G6NH,"In 2000, Troma Entertainment decided to go back to the character that made them who they are today with Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV. The movie stands as a calumniation of all the things Troma has learned as a studio since the first one really made a name for them in 1984 (including some jabs at their own decisions, IE: Kabukiman being a total wreck of a hero). Toxie IV takes a much more extreme approach to the series, which is a nice change up after the tamer II and III. There's some great, DYI gore effects and humor that goes so far over the top in it's offensiveness, that it's impossible NOT to laugh at. Plot wise, I'd say it's even more mindlessly fun than the original, as we're dealing with evil twins, reject superheroes, fighting fetuses, and inter-dimensional travel. Just pure, trashy entertainment.

The Blu-Ray offers an awesome transfer and some great extras, including three commentaries and interviews with the cast and crew of the movie.

If you're a Troma fan, you've probably already seen this and therefor should have it in your collection. However, I think it's also a great buy for anyone who's into independent filmmaking.",1441843200,,1159,4.7611940298507465

The movie features Toxie's evil doppelganger, Noxie, as he terrorizes the innocent civilians of Tromaville while poor Toxie is trapped in Amortville. Citizen Toxie includes all of the necessities for any good Troma movie: explosions, obese sidekicks, the Toxic portals into a new dimension, crazy special effects, a high school take over, and an amazing cast. Worth watching just for an epic battle scene where the Toxic Avenger fights Sgt. Kabukiman. Seriously, this is one of the best Troma movies out there.

1844697,1,B00008G6NH,"When he is unable to diffuse a bomb from destroying Tromaville's school for the gifted, Toxie is sent spiraling into a bizarro universe, where his evil doppelganger rules the crime-ridden town of Amortville. Meanwhile, The Noxious Offender has taken his place back in Tromaville, where he begins to spread his vile hate and corruption. How will Toxie ever get home to stop this terrible new threat? After two lackluster sequels, Lloyd Kaufman returns with what he claims to be the one true sequel to the 80's cult-classic THE TOXIC AVENGER, and depending on your personal taste, this will be either the best or the worst film you have ever seen in your entire life. We, for one, side with the latter. THE TOXIC AVENGER PART IV: CITIZEN TOXIE is one of the greatest crimes ever committed against humanity. It is s*** smeared on 108-minutes of celluloid waste. Kaufman needs to return the script to the group of immature high school freshman that wrote it and demand his $15 back. To quote BILLY MADISON: ""What you've just [made] is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever [seen]. At no point in your rambling, incoherent [film] were you even close to anything that could be considered [art]. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having [watched] it."" With the cunning humor far removed, the only thing that links THE TOXIC AVENGER PART IV to the original (besides a few measly cameos) is the absurd amount of splatter. If you enjoy movies that are drenched in rancid feces, semen, and stupidity, look no further! THE TOXIC AVENGER PART IV will meet all of your delicate sensibilities, and more!

1844698,5,B00008G6NH,"This may be the crudest, rudest, grossest, offensively tasteless film Troma ever put out...
...a perfect movie!

Casting Ron Jeremy as the Mayor, and Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf as a profane God was particularly brilliant.

Don't bother with the long critiques, the jokes are more fun when you don't expect them.

Not recommended for prudes.",1356912000,,342,5.071428571428571
1844699,3,B00008G6NH,"Some spoilers:

I thought this movie was better than the 3rd movie, and tied with the 2nd movie. The first movie is still the best one of all 4 movies.

The story is pretty interesting. Toxic finds himself in a different parallel world and a different evil Toxic avenger (Noxic) is in his world. Now Toxic has to find his world back home before Noxic takes over his world.

In this movie, there were more jokes and fights than there were in the 3rd movie. All the jokes are of course R rated and will not be good for children to see. Most of the jokes were all sexual in nature and the most yet in any toxic avenger movie. I thought Toxic's girlfriend was better played in this movie, than she was in the 2nd and 3rd movie. But, she wasn't as good from the first movie. The last two movie, the girlfriend was really stupid and slutty. Sure, she was hot, but her acting and character played was bad. In this movie, this actress played her much better and acted like her first appearance in the 1st movie - all innocent and not sure what's going on type.

There was a good fight scene, where Toxic was fighting Noxic and the Toxic twins were fighting at the same time inside of the girlfriend belly. The idea was really awesome. The fighting was all right, but the true purpose of doing that fight was to see which baby was going be born. Otherwise, the girlfriend will just die.

I do recommend this movie over the 3rd any day.

On a side note, I hope they make a Toxic 5 movie. In that movie, the Toxic twins will be alive, but I don't know how that is possible, so I would like to see that.",1317427200,,1591,4.2
1844700,3,B00008G6NH,"I've watched the first 3 a lot recently and I think Part 4 is the weakest. Sad, because its the most ambitious by far.

This film reverts a lot of things back the the first film. Toxie has his ""robust man"" voice again and his original blind girlfriend Sarah. Some of the original actors make cameos. But the magic isn't here like the previous 3. That magic is clever but goofy slapstick humor and truly brutal horror. The jokes are just too easy and sleazy. And the violence is just boring.

Troma has changed a lot since the 3rd film. Its moved away from its cartoonish Schlock Horror (""Nuke 'Em High"" and ""Surf Nazis"") to punk rom-coms with gore thrown in (""Tromeo & Juliet"" and ""Terror Firmer""). This is them trying to recapture their late 80s style. Its good to see it happen, but it doesn't quite work. Humor has changed alot too. This film is just poop, rape and retard jokes. This film is heavier on jokes, but less consistent of funny ones.

But the film deserves praise for its snotty attitude, clever plot twists and a few great performances like Sarah and Tito the Retarded Rebel. It has a great plot but just too much lame dialogue and annoying acting. Annoying editing too. It pumps some freshness into the Toxie series and ends it on a rather promising note. Hopefully there will be better sequels down the line.",1265155200,,1326,4.516666666666667

1844702,5,B00008G6NH,"Once again we are back for another Toxic Avenger review. After two rather lackluster sequels (which I, surprisingly, enjoyed), Lloyd Kaufman and crew return with the hilarious, gory, and very violent Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger Part IV.
What seperates Citizen Toxie from the other sequels is the care that was taken with this sequel. Sure, Toxie 2 and 3 were labors of love, as all Troma movies are, but they were missing some key ingredient that made the original Toxic Avenger so fun and enjoyable- a truly cohesive story... well, as cohesive a story as a Troma film can have. For instance, the thing about Toxie 3 that made no sense was his willingness to get involved with the Apocalypse, Inc company after all the evil they did in Toxie 2. Plus, those films were less about Toxie doing what he does best- fighting crime- and more about stunts and gags that truly felt way too long and way too often, whereas the fight scenes in Toxie 2 felt more like an obligation instead of something that truly belonged. It was almost like, with these sequels, Kaufman said, 'okay, let's try to develop the character of Toxie even more!' when, truly, there isn't too much more you can expand on about Toxie. He's a hideously deformed creature of superhuman size and strength- what more can you do with that?
And that's what's great about this film, is they don't really try to do much more in terms of changing Toxie's character and persona and instead simply show Toxie fans what we want to see- bad guys getting violently killed, and the frailty of the citizens of Tromaville when it comes to loyalty to Toxie.
The film opens with the Diaper Mafia invading the Tromaville School for the Very Special. What follows is a mix and mash of 'special' people being killed, and Toxie showing up and avenging their deaths. Enter Tito, The Retarded Rebel, one of the funniest characters in any Toxie film, if not the funniest.
After a huge explosion destroys the school, Toxie is transported to an alternate dimension, called Amortville, while his evil doppleganger, Noxie, or The Noxious Offender, ends up back in Tromaville. Noxie wreaks havoc in Tromaville while Toxie tries to figure out a way to get home, all the while battling Evil Kabuikman, Evil Mad Cowboy, and a host of other characters.
One of the best ideas Troma could have had with this film was to include many more colorful characters outside of Toxie and Sara (who finally goes back to her real name, after being called Claire in Toxie 2 and 3.) We have Sergeant Kabukiman, NYPD, who is hilarious as a drunk superhero who pretty much has no powers. As mentioned before, Tito, the Retarded Rebel, is absolutely hilarious and had me laughing in every scene he was in. Then we have Sweetie Honey, who some will either love or hate, but I can't imagine anybody hating her- she's another hilarious addition to the cast. On top of the other superheros, including Mad Cowboy, Vibrator, Dolphinman, and Mastur- er, well, if you're reading this, you can probably guess what comes next.
The effects in this film, too, are excellent, aside from one headcrushing scene, in which using a watermelon really didn't work for Troma here. But we have disembowelments, a cross through the throat, gunshot wounds, and a magnificent head crushing scene involving a Bible and a State book. Troma really outdid themselves with some of the effects here- just wait till the awesome hospital slaughter scene. This film will definately not disappoint gore hounds.
The comedy is certainly in every reel of this film. There's jokes ranging from retard jokes to certain, um, 'favors' performed by the lovable old Chester, who can be a little bit TOO lovable. Tito has some of the best lines in the film, including, 'These drugs are gonna blow my a$$ off.' I laughed all the way through this film- even most straight up comedy movies fail to do that nowadays, and combining the blood and guts made this just eye candy for me.
Certainly, however, this film is not for everyone. It takes a special person to appreciate a Troma film, and I am more than proud to say that I love these movies, no matter how weird people might look at me for it. However, I have only seen the unrated cut, so I couldn't tell you what is so different between the rated and unrated cuts, but I can imagine, after seeing the rated Toxie 2, that it probably butchers the film.
This is a definite buy if you enjoy these kinds of movies. It has everything a Troma fan could want.
And yes, if you are worried, there is nudity. Plenty of it.
Plus, the making of the film, Apocalypse Soon, is almost 3 hours long and is very entertaining to watch, making this package a completely loaded DVD worth your time and money.",1226793600,4,4712,4.657863145258103
1844703,5,B00008G6NH,"A few years after the events of the original, a gang of criminals named the Diaper Mafia takes hostage of a school for the special in the town of Tromaville. New Jersey's favorite hideously deformed creature of superhuman size and strength known as The Toxic Avenger and his sidekick named Lardass dukes it out with the gang but during an explosion something unexpected happened, it sends Toxie in another dimension at an alternate Tromaville called Amortville where everything is bad while an evil version of Toxie called The Noxic Offender is in Tromaville causing all sorts of trouble. But luckily Toxie's best friend Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD with a group of unusual misft superheroes must try to stop Noxie, meanwhile in Amortville Toxie with a retarded girl and a retarded teen rebel must find some way to get back to Tromaville or else the town will be doomed and will Toxie's wife Sarah give birth to either a good or bad child?

Featuring special appearences by Ron Jeremy, Mark Togel (who played Melvin in the original movie), Dan Snow (known as CigarFace from the original movie), Corey Feldman and narration by Stan Lee, this is the best sequel of the Toxic Avenger franchise. It discards parts 2 and 3 as if they didn't happen and becomes the real sequel to the 1985 cult horror comedy classic much like ""Superman Returns"" did with the Superman franchise did with continuing off where parts 1 & 2 left off pretending that 3 and 4 never existed. This is a non-stop ultraviolent ride of dark humor, graphic gore, head crushing, sex, lesbianism, social satire on today's issues especially a satire on the Columbine murders and extreme violence galore that has the charm of the original movie that made it a cult masterpiece. The film may offend some people but hey, it's great gory-as-hell and tasteless but rib-tickling fun for fans of horror comedy, Troma, gore and cult movies.

1844789,4,B00008G6NH,"I guess you probably have to be a fan of the original to aprreciate this movie, but also, as it may seem you need a lower IQ to enjoy it, you actualy need a high one to understand a lot of Troma films and this one certainly is sure to be a cult classic thats only put down by the ones who just don't get it.

Toxie is back once agian for the fourth installment of Toxic Avenger. It kicks off with a gang holding a bunch of ""special people"" hostage and demanding ransom or they die. Toxie and his new side-kick thats never been seen before this movie, Lard A** played by familuer Troma actor Joe Fleishaker. Together they run in to the rescue, but Lard demiseses and an explosion sends Toxie into an alternate world, while sending the evil Toxie of that world, Noxie, into his world. With the evil Noxie in Tromaville killing everyone and helping with evil, and Toxie in Amortville mistaken as Noxie but doing good, they find there way through the place for ansers. Will Toxie get bak to Tromaville to face off against Noxie? ....Duhhhh.

Also through the movie is the Tard's Sweetie Honey & Tito. Toxie's wife is inpregnated, Ron Jeremy, Corey Feldman, Lemmy from Moterhead & old familuer faces of the Troma team make speicel appearences aswell as Mr Kabukiman, who has been added to the movie gracefully!

The comedy is hilarious, the voilence will satasfy the blood and gore fans and this one actualy has a great plot!

It's hard to choose between part 1 and this one as to wich one is the best, but it's sure to become a favouite of the non-critical mind who instead look for flaws and nitpicks instead of just shut up and enjoy the film.

1844791,1,B00008G6NH,"This film was sent to me by a friend who also appreciates movies so bad they're good. At the end of the day though, this movie is so bad it's, well, bad. I love grade-Z cinema as much as the next person, although I am not amazingly fond of pointless gore (that's problem number one in this case), but the real problem here is that Lloyd Kaufman has taken what had the potential to be an amusing premise at the beginning of the series and gone out of his way to attempt to offend everyone. He does so, but mostly because of his lame attempts at satire. Question: is it absolutely hilarious to mock and parody brilliant theoretical physicist Steven Hawking? Apparently Kaufman thinks so, although I don't know anybody else who does. Likewise the premise of the ""Diaper Mafia"" taking over the ""Tromaville School for the Very Special"" leaves something to be desired in the taste department. I will skip the details of the extreme requisite flatulence, blind girlfriend forced lesbianism (with translator), and inter-uterine evil-twin mop fight, and just suffice it to say that at no time did this film rise from the gutter to attempt humor: in the gutter is where it should stay.

I love bad movies, I love parodies, and I love satire, but this film fails on more levels than most other films even attempt. Like I said in the title, when Ron Jeremy provides the taste, refinement, and decorum in a movie, you know there is a flaw in the film.

In attempting to be fair to the film I will say that people who actually do like the movie (for whatever reason) will love this packaging. There are multiple audio commentaries, a 95 minute long (it seems like forever) ""making of"" feature, outtakes, behind the scenes stuff, etc. The whole thing takes two DVDs, and in this case I can definitely say that the extras are more enjoyable viewing than the feature.

The premise of Toxie having an evil twin (""The Noxious Offender"", or ""Noxie"") is actually a good one. This could have been a good B-movie satire; it's a shame that it became a cheap exploitation piece, and an un-funny one at that.",1111363200,10,2082,4.591397849462366

Let me just tell you that I have seen a lot of weird, messed up, and down right insane movies, but this one has got to take the cake. They spared absolutely no expense in trying to offend every person, political group, organization, and anything and everything basically under the sun. It made me proud. I was even shocked at the extent they went, and that is REALLY hard to do. Just when I thought they had covered all aspects of humanity they would add another tid-bit of juicy offensiveness. I was very impressed with the effort that they had obviously put into this film, in excluding nothing from it's insulting and vulgar attacks. It's hilarious, full of cheese, and has plenty of violence. The plot is simple: Toxie gets mixed up with his evil twin Noxie and they end up in each other's different planes of existence-let the fun begin! Fans of troma and Toxie will cherish this movie, after I rented it I had to own it. It also has plenty of extras on the DVD, including a troma trivia game. This movie is bound to shock even the most desensitized viewer, as it did me, and delight all you morbid peoples' funny bones! Definitely a classic, and definitely worth it's weight in gold.",1075852800,2,1290,4.493617021276596
1844885,5,B00008G6NH,"THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST MOVIE TROMA EVERMADE!Lloyd kaufman has made another asskicking movie.this DVD IS UNRATED DIRECTOR'S CUT and it has 2 DISC its a collector's edition.with including 95 minute dokumentary""APOCALYPSE SOON!"" its a great movie and i think that you should now buy it because i think its the best dvd troma ever made.",1072396800,,332,4.946428571428571
1844886,1,B00008G6NH,"I love the Toxic avenger. I found the original to be a classic example of how to make a fun, clever and extremely gory laugh fest on a shoestring budget. I actually own the film on dvd. And, yes, I am aware that Troma is not the place to go if you're looking for class or fine art. This is a company that deliberately panders to the basest impulses of the filmgoing experience- sort of the home video version of ""grindhouse cinema"". But this time they've gone too far. Billed as the ""real"" sequel to the original film, ""Citizen Toxie"" manages to be boring, disgusting, loathsome, cheap ( I'm not kidding..even by Troma's low standards the effects are just awful in this film...and Toxie's makeup is the worst in the series..so bad that the design of this character from the original film looks oscar-worthy by comparison) and unredeemingly brazen as it revels in the most disgusting images put to film since ""Pink Flamingoes"". The ""plot"" involves Toxie being transported to an alternate dimension where everything is evil, while at the same time an evil Toxie from said dimension pops up in our world to terrorize Tromaville. I am a guy who can usually laugh off any image a movie has to throw at me, but  this flick had moments that honestly made me sick. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one like the plague that it is. You'd be better of just watching the original again. Way to corrupt your one legitmately interesting franchise, Troma. If this is your idea of stellar entertainment, your day has definitely passed.",1071446400,10,1521,4.654275092936803
1844887,5,B00008G6NH,"After battling with a glutonous mayor of Tromaville, a towering Godzilla rip off and even the Devil himself, Toxie now faces his greatest adversary- himself.  Citizen Toxie is by far the funniest, goriest and exploitive film Troma has put out since they originally put themselves on the map with their infamous head crushing scene from the original Toxic Avenger back in 1985.
The film's opening and closing narrator is voiced by Stan Lee and he along with everyone else at Troma Entertainment apologize for their two previous ... sequels.  They now have the chance with money, great special effects, lots of breasts, cheesy celebrity cameos and gore.  This film will also answer all of those mindboggling questions within the Troma universe you've been dying to know for all these years.
Such as, ""If they made another Toxic Avenger film, what would it be like?""; or ""If Toxie and Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD were to fight, who would win?""; or finally ""How much blood, guts, gore, nudity, Ron Jeremy, Corey Feldman, breasts, the Sgt. Kabukiman car chase scene and Joe Fleishaker be crammed into a 2 hour feature film!?""
Well rest assured that these and many other wonderful moments in cinematic history explode onto your tv screen with this jam packed 2 Disc DVD set.  Not to mention all the extras like a 90 minute documentary on the making of this film, cut scenes, 3 seperate audio commentaries, great slapstick and satirical looks at life.  This movie is a definite collector's item whether or not you are a Troma fan. And if you're not, ... watch and see what I grew up on.",1063065600,2,1571,4.782287822878229
1844888,4,B00008G6NH,"I'm curious about some of the comments of one of the other eviewers, who professes to be a long-time Troma fan and also claims to be offended by this film.  Hey, man, if you are even close to easily offended, you need to steer as clear of this film as as humanly possible.  This is nothing new for Troma movies.  My god, they distributed a movie called ""Buttcrack,"" which is about a killer buttcrack!
To deal with the actual movie, though: it's very funny.  Sick, yes.  Disgusting, yes.  But funny.  And thought-provoking, in a strange sort of way.  When a supporting character visits an abortion clinic and is assaulted by both vicious pro-lifers and sadistic pro-choicers, you are left with no choice whatsoever but to actually think for a second about where you stand on this issue.  Such things happen at several points in the film, which is sort of surprising.  You don't expect keen social commentary from a director who has fashioned a career out of head-crushing, arm-ripping, and gratuitously gratuitous nudity.  My point is, this is a movie that is smarter than it seems to be, which to me is the best sort of art.
The DVD is especially worth purchasing for the basketload of extras, which include a lenghty documentary on the arduous making of the film.  There are three commentary tracks (one with director Lloyd Kaufman, one with various of the actors, and one with the editors), each of which is excellent and informative.",1062892800,,1436,4.745967741935484
1844889,5,B00008G6NH,"This movie should have swept the oscars. Llyod Kaufman has done it once again. The greatest Toxic Avenger of them all!! Way better than anything from the mega-studios!!! And the extras and Easter Eggs make the DVD as much fun as seeing it in a theater!
If you are not a Troma fan, check out this DVD and you soon will be!!!",1061164800,,323,4.225806451612903
1844890,5,B00008G6NH,"Just buy this.  Right now.  Words cannot describe how awesome it is.  This is the definate Troma film.
  I love it, and you will too.  Why are you still reading this?
  Go get it!",1060214400,,179,4.0588235294117645
1844891,5,B00008G6NH,"WOW!  This movie has it all!  And unlike my last review for the totally RETARDED movie Unspeakable, this is by far Troma's best film and DVD release EVER!!!!  There are also so many extra's on this DVD I dare you to try and go through them all in one sitting.  IMPOSSIBLE!  No matter what the price, buy this DVD!  The film is side-splittingly funny.  The extras are so extensive it'll make you vomit.  So what are you waiting for?  BUY THE DAMN MOVIE!!!  HA HA!!!",1059264000,,464,4.352941176470588
1844911,5,B00008G6NH,"You've got to love Troma. No other studio has so elevated trash to an art form (not intentionally, at least). Taking cues from the likes of Roger Corman and John Waters, director Lloyd Kaufman truly knows how to make great bad movies. Making his films truly as exploitative, offensive and trashy as possible, Kaufman does a better job at making bad movies than most directors do at making good ones.
With Citizen Toxie, Lloyd Kaufman has nearly topped what I previously thought to be the epitome of trashy B-movies, Terror Firmer. Terror Firmer probably still stands as the ultimate Troma movie, but Citizen Toxie is not far behind. Among of the objects of spoofery this time around is Orson Welles' masterpiece Citizen Kane. Does that mean that Kaufman is trying to make the Citizen Kane of B-movies with Citizen Toxie? Possibly, and he just may have done it. I've seen a lot of cheesy, awful exploitation flicks, but few of them were as enjoyable or as hilarious as Citizen Toxie. There's everything that makes B-movies great here: over-the-top gore, gratuitous sex and nudity, crude and vulgar humor, bad acting and cameos by bottom-drawer celebrities (Lemmy Kilmister, Corey Feldman, Ron Jeremy, Julie Strain, Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf). Dare I say that Citizen Toxie may even be better than the original. Even if you haven't seen the classic 1985 movie, it will still be enjoyable. The original movie is also summarized at the beginning to bring you up to speed.
As usual, Troma has put together an excellent DVD package. It has deleted scenes, outtakes, interviews, a feature-length documentary and all kinds of fun stuff. Well worth the low price for hours of disgusting entertainment. Citizen Toxie is highly recommended for fans of the genre and anyone who can sit through a Troma movie and enjoy themselves.",1058313600,,1820,4.950980392156863
1844912,5,B00008G6NH,"TROMA fans unite!!  Toxie 4 has arrived.
Just when you thought Kauffman and TROMA couldn't possibly top themselves with offensive, yet hysterical, material... they prove you wrong.  This is probably the MOST offensive TROMA film yet... but it's also the most ""laugh-out-loud"" offering from this risk-taking independent studio.  It's all here... killing ""special"" children, lynching black men, homosexual and lesbian sex, Nazis, extreme gore, and even God (played by Hank The Angry Dwarf from The Howard Stern Show).  But that's only a minor sampling of the outrageous content Toxie gets himself involved with in this (mis)adventure.  Throw in other great characters from previous TROMA hits (such as Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD) and you have a perfect indie studio signature piece.
This 2-disc set is also LOADED with extras (out-takes, deleted scenes, interviews, auditions, and more)!  The ""making of"" documentary is worth the price of the disc, itself!
If you love TROMA or if you're not afraid to laugh at extremely politically incorrect humor, this is a ""must have"" for your collection!",1056412800,,1083,5.341176470588235
1844913,5,B00008G6NH,"I Don't even know where to begin about Troma's biggest, baddest, and most feature packed double disc of Citizen Toxie.

Good Toxie is sent To Amortvile the opposite of Tromaville and Noxie (Evil Toxie) is sent to wreak havok on Tromaville and chaos ensues! What happens next? You have to rush out and grab what could be the best toxie of all to find out. No lie, this 2-disc will keep you occupied for weeks figuring out and going through all the features and easter eggs plus the added documentary Apocalypse Soon is great too.

1844914,5,B00008G6NH,"Forget the original Toxie, Class of Nuke em High, Tromeo and Juliet, and even Terror Firmer: Citizen Toxie is the definitive Troma movie! The characters are excellent, the script is genious, the directing is inspired, and the acting is just campy enough. There is no plot to get in the way of the over the top gore, tomatoes, and ""Special"" people. Let's get to the characters, shall we? Of course there's Toxie. No intro needed. Noxie is the Noxious Avenger, Toxie's doppleganger from Amortville. Lard-butt is toxie's ""morbidly obese sidekick."" Sarah is the ever name changing blind wife of toxie. OH, in Amortville she's deaf not blind. Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD quite possibly steals the show as a drunk loser of a vigilante. Well, almost steals the show. Tito steals the show, a special crack head who is undergoing a major case of teen angst. As Tito says in the film when discovered getting high, ""Being a teenager sucks. Being a retarder teenager sucks more. Drugs make it suck less"" Toxie: ""wow, you're quite articullate for a special druggie."" Tito: ""what's atriclate?"" LOL!!! This is what the script is like the whole time, but better and even more obscene. The DVD extras are incredible, 3 comentaries, a feature length making of docu called ""Apocalypse Soon,""(don't miss the segment with the stunts coordinator complaining about his 3 FEET JUMP.) deleted scenes to the documentary, deleted scenes, bonus footage, trailers, like, 4 premiers, not-so-hidden hidden easter eggs, and more. Buy this DVD, turn off your brain, like, totally, and have some friends over: it'll be fun.",1054425600,,1581,5.015209125475285
1844915,4,B00008G6NH,"So here it is...the long-awaited Citizen Toxie.
You know, I'm getting tired of doing Troma all these favors. I buy all their movies, I watch them, I talk about them to my friends, I wear the T-shirts. But all I'm really doing is kidding myself, and biding my time until the real Troma stands up again. Because as perversely entertaining as Citizen Toxie is, it's not the real Troma. The Troma I know and love has heart, and I'm sorry to say Lloyd seems to have reached into the bowels of Toxie himself and plucked his poor, black little heart out.
Maybe Kaufman is afraid of being ""good."" His defensive-bordering-on-paranoid rants against mainstream entertainment like Spielberg certainly suggest that he's intentionally shunning competence. Look no further than his last two flicks - they're both self-referential, self-conscious post-modern satires. Fine, but ANYONE can do that! There's no heart, and that's a huge letdown, following the masterful ""Tromeo & Juliet,"" which was pure heart (and it was just as silly and campy as all the others, and it had a better lesbian scene too).
But maybe that movie was a fluke. Maybe all Troma wants to do is stink up the joint in a good way, like a big plate of onion rings on a caviar-and-lobster buffet table. In which case Citizen Toxie fits in nicely. It's fun, funny, entertaining, a good time. So are the extras, even if the documentary is a little dull. But look at the actors in Citizen Toxie! They're GOOD! They know what they're doing! Give them a chance, man. Mix up the letters of ""Troma"" and switch that T for an E and you get ""Amore""...let's get the Amore back in Troma, shall we?
So on the whole, Citizen Toxie has a good beat and you can dance to it. 4 stars. Peace out.",1053993600,,1729,4.616883116883117
1844916,5,B00008G6NH,"The original Toxic Avenger is the most famous Troma movie ever made and finally there is a worthy sequel. When I first heard of Citizen Toxie and how great it was, I had high hopes as Tromeo & Juliet and Terror Firmer were so cool. I wasn't disappointed, Citizen Toxie is hilarious from start to finish with everything that makes Troma great.
There's tonnes of nekkid girls (a few guys as well), action, cheesy Troma gore and some of the most twisted humour ever! I mean who else but Troma has the guts to make jokes about, hate crimes, penil implants, abortions and the metally challenged? I think that plenty of people would feel it's their duty to critisize such un PC humour, but really the true racism satired in this film are shown as events happening in the 'evil' dimention thus rightfully protrayed as dispicable yet how many Hollywood film makers even acknowledge that these exact evils happen in the real world? Most people would agree that making fun of the handicapped is not cool, but hey the mentally challenged characters Tito and Sweetie develop true personalities in Citizen Toxie and really aren't the tear jerking Hollywood flicks like 'I am Sam' that use handicapped people to make their films sappy and sentimantal exploiting them just as much as films that laugh at them?
Citizen Toxie has the kind of no holds barred creativity only a low budget independant film can capture. If you love Troma you will already have this 2 disc set, if you don't like Troma steer clear of this film as it embodies everything Troma represents.
As usual there are a tonne of extras on the disc. Troma certainly know how to make great DVD sets, how many big studio DVD's do you get which think that 'interactive menus' and 'chapter selection' are special features? Apocalypse Soon the making of documentry is awesome. Any big budget film 'making of' consists of a glossy set of interviews in which one dimentional actors like Julia Roberts go into the dynamics of their character acting and feature a director explaining his artistic vision for the remake of a foriegn film, but Apocalypse Soon features totally raw on set footage of the film crew. All the problems like lacklusture stunts, late actors, script revisions ect are all shown in on the spot unedited footage. LLoyd isn't painted as a character who is beloved by all crew and actors but shown reacting honestly to the day to day struggles on set.
This double DVD is amazing, very cool film, great extras, some interesting easter eggs and is worth every penny.",1051747200,7,2525,4.740909090909091
1844917,5,B00008G6NH,"Okay when I saw the bootleg edition of Citizen Toxie the Toxic Avenger part 4 I was blown away, this movie was really hilarious, the actor who played the Toxic Avenger was well built for this movie, the perfect size and everything, he also knew how to handle a mop expertly. Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf did a hell of a job in this film even though he was sober I would have loved to see him drunk in this movie. Heidi was a complete babe she did a great job playing not only Sarah the blind blonde bimbo also Toxie's love of his life but she another role since this film was about Toxie going into a evil dimension and facing the evil version of himself. You have to see this movie it is hilarious you will enjoy it. Lloyd Kaufman did a real cool job directing this movie.",1051660800,3,773,4.16

this is one of THE greatest flicks ive ever seen in my entire life.  with hours upon hours of dvd extras, this two-disc set is the greatest dvd since terror firmer.  i cant even begin to describe how amazing this movie is.  indeed it is the true sequel (although toxic avenger II is a guilty pleasure of mine).
i think the most amazing thing about this movie is it was made with 1 half of 1 percent of the amount of money a common hollywood film costs.  utter and sheer genius.",1051315200,2,580,4.333333333333333
1844919,5,B00008G6NH,"Lloyd Kaufman is a genius making masterpieces on a budget that would barely be enough to pay for one day's catering on an average Hollywood producton and he does it for thirty years now. In a world where low budget independent filmmaking means manymultimillion dollar productions by subdivisions of Warner and Disney, Lloyd Kaufman survived for three decades (and counting) with his truly independent filmcompany Troma and in doing so directed, produced and/or wrote dozens of brilliant films. (For which he received a lifetime achievement award at this year's edition of the prestigious Amsterdam Fantastic Film Festival.)
CITIZEN TOXIE: THE TOXIC AVENGER IV is his latest and even better than even those brilliant masterpieces as TROMEO AND JULIET and TERROR FIRMER. I am not going to give away anything of the story, too much is happening in any case to even begin to tell you about in a few lines, but it is SO wonderful you just have to see it for yourself. Dave Mattey is ondoubtly the best Toxie of all four films, Heidi Sjursen his best (in this case) Sarah, and even though the budget of the film is not much more than that of the first one, made almost twenty years ago the production value of this one is unbelievable! This exact same film made by one of the Official Indepentents (Miramax, how independent can one be?) would have cost at least ten times this amount. And then - they would never have the guts and the intelligence to come up with this totally awesome film in which more aspects of our messed-up world are tackled that they could cram in their entire catalogue.
Apart from a film you can't afford to miss, this 2-disc-DVD-set (and look at the rediculously low price!) provides you with SO much more. There are no less than three full-length audio-commentaries. One by director Lloyd Kaufman, and his commentaries are always at least as entertaining and insightful as the feature itself. This particular one even includes a soundsample of  Troma co-founder Michael Herz!! The second one is a wonderfully compiled track with contributions by the most important stars of the film, including Troma Action Hero Joe Fleishaker, star of many of Kaufman's past movies.
Another track is by the editors of the film and provides even more info on how such a brilliant film could be made under conditions that are difficult to say the least. At any rate - much more is there, such as loads of deleted scenes (with or without commentary), talks with the cast and crew, footage of CITIZEN TOXIE-premieres around the world, tons of hidden easter-eggs and much, much more. Apart from all this there even is a complete second feature: the 135 minute behind-the-scenes documentary APOCALYSPE SOON, which also comes complete with it's own deleted scenes! This is NOT the usual ""he is wonderful, he is great, he is the best"" docu - as the audiocommentaries do it provides a no holds barred look inside the hard-working-low-paying world of independent cinema. These people are HONEST, and where do you get that on your DVD-extra's??
There is no doubt this is the very best DVD-presentation of a movie ever - over six hours of Tromatic entertainment, and I'm not even counting the multiple viewings of the film itself with the various audio-tracks! Count those and you need a week to take in all information this instant interactive encyclopeadia provides.
If you haven't seen the other installements of THE TOXIC AVENGER, not to worry as everything you need to know is worked into the movie, without it being boring for those who are familiar.
Don't rent this one, don't watch your friend's copy but support independent cinema and buy our own copy. You never received so much value for your bucks!! (Except maybe when you bought Lloyd Kaufman's latest book MAKE YOUR OWN DAMN MOVIE).",1050969600,7,3789,4.856259659969088

This movie over uses poop and vomit gags. They are always in Troma films, but this movie pushes past what is needed. This movie has tons of cameos and some overall interesting casting, but it falls flat after marathoning Toxic Avenger movies.

The original Toxic Avenger is still the strongest entry. Two and Three are fitting. This fourth installment has a great premise, a couple neat ideas, but ultimately just makes gratuitous titty flashing boring after a while.

Sadly, I hate how Kabukiman and other NJ heroes are used. They could have been better used. Kabukiman's movie is fun and needs a sequel, but this Tromaville Kabukiman does not feel quite right, although I do like the evil universe version of Kabikiman.

The ending is good. I like how it recycled footage and left the story at a new ending at the same time. It would be nice to use that ending to kick off another sequel. There is still hope for this franchise.
