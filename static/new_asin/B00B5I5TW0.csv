8562934,4,B00B5I5TW0,If you have ever wanted to sit down with an Exorcist and ask him questions about what he does this is for you. Just a head shot of him responding to questions. Very good - but - not great. Thought it was interesting as to why only a selected group are allowed to perform exorcisms. He had a good answer.,1504224000,,303,4.066666666666666

8562936,5,B00B5I5TW0,"More of a background documentary, centered on the interview with Fr. Fortea, than a detailed documentary, but still worth getting. I would also recommend getting The Exorcist in the 21st Century, which is a more detailed documentary, highlighting Fr. Fortea, but also includes many other exorcists.",1413417600,2,298,5.5
