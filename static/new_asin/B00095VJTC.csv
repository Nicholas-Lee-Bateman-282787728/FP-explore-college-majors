2267578,5,B00095VJTC,Got here fast and the break down makes it a quick mini workout or a longer more intense one. Really love this.,1276992000,,110,4.045454545454546
2267579,5,B00095VJTC,"Sera Solstice's Foundations of Belly Dance is the perfect DVD if you want to learn belly dance, which is like learning a new language  for those who have never tried dance as a form of expression, exercise, and fun before. Belly dance is a great place to start, because there are no barriers: Age, body shape, or previous dance experience do not matter. Belly dance crosses all lines and welcomes us all. It is timeless and sensual. An art form dating back centuries, and also right for today.

Sera gives detailed explanations of every movement, making it easy to understand and follow along. Intermediate students will also benefit. If your technique needs a little in-depth ""cleaning up,"" this one is for you too! Sera demonstrates at first up to tempo with her full studio of students, then breaks it down slowly move by move with  her select Solstice Ensemble.  There's a nice flowing warm-up, followed by 1: Arm movements, 2: Upper body work. 3: Hip work. 4: Weight shifting, footwork, and more. 5: Hip undulations and all the smooth, sensual movements.  Then there's a fun ""Dance Along!"" section.

The 2 solo performances by Sera are exquisite, with her amazing technique, fluidity, beauty and grace. These solos should inspire us to keep practicing! The ""Why Belly Dance?"" section is also interesting, where Sera's group tells us what belly dancing has done for them, body, mind, and soul. Belly dance is one of the best dance experiences you can have, and this DVD teaches you all the basics to have that experience",1273968000,,1524,4.842307692307692
2267580,5,B00095VJTC,"If you are new to tribal belly dance or have loved it for a spell, "" Foundations of Belly Dance East Coast Tribal-Beginner Tribal Fusion Belly Dance"" with Sera is an ideal program to explore and aplly to belly dance basics. More than interesting and enriching, it is also fun to piece together the choreography drill sections into the dance along section. This was much like being a student in class with Sera and her students! I admire Sera's dance style, elegant arm work and teaching method and eased into it without difficulty. Beginning  belly dancers with good basic foundations will find  much that can be retained for personal use and improvement with the array of disciplined moves which embellish simple arm patterns, hip work. This is excellent conditioning and practice for a good foundation in tribal style to work towards. Several of my students achieved beautiful arm movement and movement flow from Sera's previous ""East Coast Tribal Style,Basics,Combinations and Strenth Workout"" and loved dancing LobeKnocker.

This instructional program consists of:

Welcome section- interviews with Solstice Students views on belly dance from their perspective. A memorable quote from one of Sera's student  is  to experience how a belly dance move ""feels"", rather than how it "" looks"" .

Warm up- belly dance basics with danceable  combinations. I absolutley enjoyed this intense muscle conditioning workout  which quickly  sets the tone for a serious dancer attitude with discipline and focus. This section if filled with deep lunges that I quickly felt worked the torso, thighs, upper back and arms. This is then followed by a lengthy, meditative session using seated yoga.

 The simple menu is easily navigated into 5 learning sections of technique and combinations. These sections are broken down into choreography drills taught by Sera and she is joined by dancers in a class setting. These sections follow

The sections are:
1.arms strengthening and the development of gracefulness- Sera teaches correct arm placement and  positions from closed 1st to 5th positions, using the wrist to lead the movement of the arm; elegant armwork is beautiful and expressive in dance;
2.upper body articulation- strengthening the entire torso is  dissected into large isolated circles, sways, slides. Sera adds proper arm placement, variations of chest lifts and drops. Working the torso in this section for fluidity and stability, a definite must in tribal dance!
3.hip work fundamentals and lower body toning- defining hip isolations, pelvic tucks and releases, shimmy variations
4.weight shift development,footwork and hip work hip twists-hip lifts, cut turns, diagonal hip pushes
5.hip undulations, Sera demonstrates smooth hip work-hip slides and twists, evolving figure 8s, smooth transitions from omi circles, to hip circles and undulations. Her method of teaching figure 8's is easy to learn.

The Dance along section brings all the sections together for a tribal style routine. The music compilation is fantastic for each choreography drill with varied selections from those such as Beats Antique,Djinn,Raquey and the Caveman.
To finalize, sit at the edge of your seat for 2 performances by the beautiful and mesmerizing Sera.",1273017600,2,3231,5.355731225296442
2267581,5,B00095VJTC,"Call it what you like, I will always think of this as ""East Coast II"". I'll call it that for the purposes of this preview and will call the first one, East Coast Tribal Bellydance,  East Coast I.

From the start, I can't help comparing. Both East Coasts are meant for beginners. Having been there, I think that actually both are for advanced beginners. It took me some years to get anywhere near that certain look Sera creates in East Coast I. And it was very hard work indeed. Well, I think that in many ways, East Coast II is a step up or a companion video to East Coast I. I have to say at the outset though, I'm such a fan of Sera's and of this particular style of dancing, I don't terribly care who it's meant for and how it relates to the first video. If she were to create ten videos, I'd want the lot and that is the truth. And that's even when the only difference were a change in costume. I'd still want them. I just love the elegance with which Sera and her Solstice Ensemble move - like art in space.

There's an absolutely huge description of East Coast II on the World Dance New York website. So I won't bother going into what the contents are. You have everything detailed there, including the time for each section. I'll put down instead, my first impressions.

This time we open with a whole lot more Solstice girls. They look a shade less funky than the first group and are not as beautifully costumed, but they all move beautifully. Many dancers will be happy to know that they'll see all body types here.  Not everyone is stick thin.

This time the warm up is fast fast fast. Absolute beginners will have a tough time with that. You have to have done some warm ups and be familiar with some concepts like the flat back, lunges, etc. And all the safety issues associated. The warm is also more like a dance on this video. One should watch it a couple of times before dancing along, because of that pace. Also you should note where to look during each move because that's very much part of each position. Don't approach it with various injuries to the knees and back because there are level drops. It's a lot of fun.

The movement meditation will remind you of the second segment of East Coast I. It's really an extended version of that where you use continuous flowing full upper body circles to go into an empowering meditative dance trance. It's very relaxing and massage-like. I particularly like that part.

After this, the format is quite unique. Each section that follows is a drill, a technique refresher, a workout and a combination at the same time. Oh, and did I forget to say, also a massage because most sections are made up of nice full body stretchy moves. They use full range of movement.

The arms section (which is the first drill-combo-practice-whatever) starts with serpentine arm moves. We practice different positions and arm and hand flexibility. Sera's armwork is graceful right to the fingertips. As with the first DVD, freeze at any point and you'll find a sculpted pretty picture because Sera's form is absolute perfection.

The upper body strengthening drill-combo is a solid little workout for the torso with large range circles and controlled pops. This is where you get nice and flexible.

There are two combos that focus on hipwork and let me tell you, both are very upbeat indeed. The first combo is short but intense and packed with a lot of movements to practice. It's hugely fun, again. It's the one I got first time. The second combo is full of shimmies

A third hip combo is all about the smooth moves. Horizontal eights too, though they're not so frequently seen in tribal fusion.

The whole lot of these combos goes and becomes a choreography, just as with the first East Coast. The style is very much the same except the combos here are all more upbeat. The combos are demonstrated, drilled and finally danced un-cued as one choreography to similarly funky music.

Finally there's a  tribal fusion performance by Sera followed by another that is not the usual dark fusion but more oriental in style. .

A note after working some more with the DVD: I do find that the number of dancers in the warm up and other places is very distracting. On a stage, they would look fabulous. On a television screen, four dancers is more than enough.",1272931200,10,4292,4.518709677419355
2267582,5,B00095VJTC,"So I just finished doing this dvd this morning.  I always like to remind readers that I'm a total belly dance beginner and I prefer latin/afro dance to middle eastern dance.  That being said I enjoyed the dvd somewhat. As the previous reviewer said the dvd starts with a warm-up/moving meditation that lasts about 32 minutes.  It is a very energetic standing warm-up with spinal, hip and leg moves to get the blood flowing.  I really, really liked the warm-up, even though I really disliked the warm-up music.  The meditation consists of seated sufi grinds ala kundalini yoga which moves from the hips to the upper body with arms.  Very nice.  This is done clockwise and counter clockwise.  She ends with legs stretches and hip pushes.

The combination is broken into sections.  Each section is first performed by the entire class and then by Sera and 3 dancers.  A word about the dancers.  I appreciate that Sera chose students with different body types.  Some were reed thin and some had bellies, like me :).  Very nice to see rubenesque women in bikini tops doing graceful bellydance moves.

I disagree with the previous viewer who said that Sera didn't breakdown the movements with the exception of the arms.  I think that she did a very good job of breaking down the movements and easing you into the actual bellydance movement by teaching what I call lead-in movements.  Hard to explain, but if you have taken dance classes before, you understand what I mean.  Teachers do this to keep students from freaking out by introducing a movement everyone can do and then adding layers until you're doing the actual complicated move.

She uses this technique in all of the sections.  At the end of the section, she and the 3 dancers do the combination with no instruction.  After all of the combination sections, the entire class does the complete combination from start to finish 3 times.  This is where they lost me.  I couldn't get the intricacies of the dance and found myself floundering and frustrated.  I think she should have called out the movements for the 1st round and then proceeded to the music only combination.

I have to say a word about the music.  I hated it.  It was techno, middle eastern something or the other.  Whatever it was, I found it hard to dance to.  What a shame because otherwise this is a very good dvd.  I would not call it a workout. i barely sweated.  It is rather an instructional  companion to your belly dance classes.  Since I don't take belly dance classe as there are none in my area of upstate NY, I will just use the warm-up section for my other dance dvds. If you are new to belly dance, start here.  All in all I did appreciate learning that bellydance has a movement vocabulary of its own...right down to the wrist twirls!  Who knew? I stand amazed.",1272326400,6,2795,4.611788617886178
2267583,4,B00095VJTC,"I have really enjoyed working with Sera's new DVD. It so far has been great for for my bellydance practice.

This DVD covers conditioning drills, refinement of technique, and interesting combinations....along with great tips on posture, body alignment, etc. Though, the basic arm positions for tribal are explained, just know this DVD doesn't go into depth about ""step by step"" break-downs of the basic bellydance foundation movements.

The chapters are broken down into sections for each sequence of combinations. These combinations and drills are structured to enhance your dance by conditioning, strengthening, as well as, increasing your articulation.

Chapters:

Warm-Up & Opening Meditation
Arm Strengthening
Upper Body
Hipwork
Weight shift, footwork
Hip Undulations
""Follow Along""(no cues) of entire dance (or all combinations)
2 Performances by Sera

The whole instructional is taught with continuous non-stop movement (or a flow) with a ""follow me"" type feel.

You will first, view a clip of the combo in it's entirety performed by the class, then Sera and just a few of her students, drill a few basic movements... then they add & layer to create the complete combination. Once you learn all the combinations, there is a chapter that puts all the combinations together, so you can practice a complete dance routine.

I personally enjoyed the warm-up section. I don't always have the patience to take the time I should to warm-up, but Sera made it interesting and fun. And I also liked the combinations taught, really great examples of Sera's unique style of tribal fusion.

Overall, a fun and fantastic DVD for your dance practice. You will get a nice workout with its steady pace and can incorporate the dance-worthy combinations into your tribal fusion repertoire. I would go as far to say, this program is quick enough for even the intermediate dancer to practice with--yet, I would not recommend to anyone who is not familiar with the bellydance basics.",1271376000,20,1967,5.182965299684542
8057368,5,B00095VJTC,Sera is an excellent dance and insructor.  I bought her Tribal belly dance Dvd years ago and bought this recently before they dissapear. I love her instruction and dance form. She is fun to learn from.,1457913600,,201,4.583333333333333
8057369,4,B00095VJTC,"probably one of the only bellydance dvds i've gone all the way through and felt like i got something out of it.
a good work out if nothing else... the full exercise is easy enough to keep up with.

doesnt replace real classes but a decent addition to any workout/dance dvd collection",1423958400,,283,4.4423076923076925
8057370,3,B00095VJTC,ok but not a replacement for classes.,1422921600,,37,4.428571428571429
8057371,4,B00095VJTC,"WHAT MAKES THIS DVD SPECIAL - Sera uses a somewhat strange method, maybe similar to the one used by Neon in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bellydance-First-Steps-step-by-step-belly-dance-instruction-2-hours-of-non-stop-practice-for-Total-Beginners/dp/B00095VJUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bellydance: First Steps - step-by-step belly dance instruction & 2 hours of non-stop practice for Total Beginners</a>, which I would call full immersion or ""monkey see, monkey do..."". There is not a real tutorial where the moves are broken down to its basic components and drilled extensively; they are just performed on their own and then put into a combination almost immediately.  I started with the ""workout"" and turned it off. I did the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Potion-The-Bellydance-Workout/dp/B001TZ70DU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Potion - The Bellydance Workout</a>&nbsp;practice flow and work out for a couple of weeks and returned to this one with more success. Maybe it's just you need to keep doing it even if at the beginning you feel totally clumsy and out of synch. In my opinion this DVD won't help you drill the moves (maybe I'm wrong) it will rather teach you combinations that form a beautiful style (a flowing tribal style). This DVD is not one of my favorites yet, I think I need more practise to really enjoy it. Although the last few times I used it, I like it more every time, so maybe I am starting to get it... If you are already introduced to bellydance, then you will enjoy it from the start, since the combinations are fun once you master them.

EXCELLENT BD DVD'S FOR TOTAL BEGINNERS. I may have other beginner DVD's, but the following are my top pics because all include a detailed tutorial section that break down the moves slowly and without music. Of course tutorials are boring, specially if you are not totally new to BD or if you prefer to learn by dancing from the very first step. However, if you are an absolute beginner in BD, you probably need this instruction, since you need to isolate a lot of muscles you did not even know you could voluntarily move.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belly-Dance-Basics-Beyond-with-Jenna-Belly-Dancing-Classes-for-a-Solid-Foundation-Bellydance-how-to-belly-dance-technique/dp/B000FSL8WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belly Dance Basics & Beyond, with Jenna: Belly Dancing Classes for a Solid Foundation - Bellydance how-to, belly dance technique</a>&nbsp;will provide you one of the most detailed technique sections you will find and probably the most complete one in terms of variety of moves. Jenna explains almost every shoulder/rib/hip move & footstep I have seen so far. Additionally, she practices each move together with you, giving you hints and tips during the practice, so you practice with constant reminders as if you were in a class.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Potion-The-Bellydance-Workout/dp/B001TZ70DU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Potion - The Bellydance Workout</a>&nbsp;by Neon gives you a good all round beginner tutorial plus a 50 min. beginner dance flow and a 50 min. workout, which is a bit tougher, so you can continue to use this DVD once you improve your skills.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bellydance-Beautiful-Technique-from-Step-One-with-Autumn-Ward-Beginner-belly-dancing-classes-Belly-dance-how-to-Beginner-bellydance-instruction/dp/B001L9UG6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bellydance: Beautiful Technique from Step One, with Autumn Ward: Beginner belly dancing classes, Belly dance how-to, Beginner bellydance instruction</a>&nbsp;is excellent and it includes the most detailed technique section I have seen, but only for lower body (upper body isolations and footwork are left for other instructional DVD's). However, I am not sure if it's for total beginners, since Autumn does not include individual practice time for each independent move, the only practice time you get is different moves strung together in a flow.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belly-By-Sandra-Vol-1-Isolations-Bellydance-Instructional/dp/B001SFT764/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belly By Sandra Vol 1: Isolations (Bellydance Instructional)</a>&nbsp;is also excellent for beginners. Sandra first explains each move, including muscular engagement, posture, etc. without music and also giving you truly interesting background information as to how the move is executed in ""Middle Eastern Dance"" vs other dance forms like ""African"", ""Jazz"", etc. Then she drills each move with excellent drum music, making your drilling much more fun so you do not get bored so easily. However, you would need to buy Vol 1 and 2 and still don't get as many moves as with Jenna.

CARDIO CHALLENGE: Medium TONING: Medium CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Advanced Beginner to Advanced Intermediate INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Very good MUSIC: Very good FUN FACTOR: High

CONTENT:
1) Warm-up, workout and meditation - Very good warm-up followed by a fast paced and tough workout, your cardio levels go up with toning and ""flowing"" exercises that will give you more grace and flexibility. I found this section a bit risky, specially the quick lunges, so take care of how you position your knees - even if it takes you longer to make the move. Finally a strange meditation, it is performed sitting and circling around yourself all the time, so it is a ""moving"" meditation. This ""warmup, workout & meditation"" is almost the same as the one in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Solar-Belly-Dance-East-Coast-Tribal-with-Sera-Solstice-Bellydance-instruction-complete-East-Coast-Tribal-style-how-to-intermediate-level/dp/B003BDMM2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Solar Belly Dance - East Coast Tribal, with Sera Solstice: Bellydance instruction, complete East Coast Tribal-style how-to; intermediate level</a>. In solar Sera just adds a few more exercises and modifies some of them to make it a bit more difficult; but it's basically the same.
2) Five segments, where a simple choreography is practised, for example upper body, hips, weight transfer, etc. Each segment starts with a demo of the choreography of the specific segment then some drills & brief explanations and at the end you will find the choreography of the segment repeated two or three times so you can practise it. The choreographies are not too complicated in terms of layering, but you need to know the basic bellydance hipwork.
3) Full choreography (all the segments put together one after the other) and repeated a couple of times so you can practise the entire choreo. After the second time a hip shimmy is added to the first arm segment to embellish it, so here you'll add an extra layering when you are ready.
4) Two performances - Beautiful and strong performances by Sera.

MUSIC:
Very good choice, instrumental modern music that is nice to dance to and a bit of percussions for the workout.

EMPHASIS:
Good overall emphasis, upper body, lower body, total body and nice arm movements too. I would say the emphasis is on achieving ""flowing movement"" for the entire body.

WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD's:
+ ""Flowing"" style: all the DVD is structured in what Sera calls ""movement flow"", so your practise starts flowing from the beginning. If I would like to learn the dancing style of a particular dancer it would be Sera's style for her flow and intensity or Irina's for her elegance...
+ Beautiful dance combinations accompanied by nice music: Fun to execute from the start if you master the moves (to fast paced music) and it is not too complicated in terms of layering.
+ The arms segment is really good, it is the only one in my DVD collection that explains all the various positions with their names (first, second, fifth, etc.), the beautiful arm movements are only rivalled by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tribal-Fusion-Belly-Dance-Workout-with-Irina-Belly-dancing-classes-Tribal-Fusion-bellydance-how-to-Muscle-conditioning-exercise-Yoga-warmup/dp/B00095MBQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tribal Fusion Belly Dance Workout, with Irina: Belly dancing classes; Tribal Fusion bellydance how-to; Muscle conditioning exercise; Yoga warmup</a>, and are used in all the segments accompanying the lower body drills. For beautiful arm trajectories in fluid circles and with broken line technique I now found&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bellydance-Beautiful-Technique-from-Step-One-with-Autumn-Ward-Beginner-belly-dancing-classes-Belly-dance-how-to-Beginner-bellydance-instruction/dp/B001L9UG6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bellydance: Beautiful Technique from Step One, with Autumn Ward: Beginner belly dancing classes, Belly dance how-to, Beginner bellydance instruction</a>, which I like a bit better although it is more classical inspired.
+ Music: Excellent and varied (Irina's choice of music is also very good but a bit less varied and Love Potion is also excellent but in a different style, not so modern)
+ The workout is one of the toughest workouts I have found in bellydance DVD's in terms of cardio and toning. It even might start a bit too fast (watch out for knee injuries); it's like dancing from the beginning. Maybe it's rivalled by Asharah's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Modern-Tribal-Bellydance/dp/B000UZRT4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Modern Tribal Bellydance</a>&nbsp;(a bit longer and even tougher in terms of toning, but not in terms of cardio) and Irina's warm-up (a bit shorter)
+ Leg strengthening - the workout and dance combinations really work your thighs (only rivalled by Serpentine - Belly Dance with Rachel Brice :: Bellydance Technique & Yoga for Strong, Relaxed & Sinuous Movement and Asharah's, which have special leg strengthening sections)

PD: Now that I own Sera's Solar Bellydance DVD, I think the ""Foundations"" refers to the fact that this DVD's movements are kind of a basis on which to build upon to create ""Solar"" movements. I am not sure if you need this DVD in order to do Solar; it sure helps, since you will have already mastered a fundamental part of the moves. But if I needed to choose between both, I would definitely take Solar (maybe drilling first with other DVD's).",1343088000,4,10493,6.25674740484429
8057372,5,B00095VJTC,"I highly recommend her Foundations of Belly Dance Video. I like her fusion of tribal and standard belly dance moves. Personally, pure' Egyptian/Turkish belly dance is too faux-sexy for me, and pure tribal is too ""Klingon Women."" But her style is fluid and modern without all that ""ticking"". Her steps can easily work their way into any style you do. The video is well made and she teaches the steps very well and she is a pleasure to watch.",1314057600,,440,4.582278481012659
8057373,4,B00095VJTC,"At first I was really thrown off by the speed at which the moves are thrust upon you. There is no slow motion explanation of moves; just an army of curves gyrating at breakneck speeds. It grew on me though, and over time as I became more familiar with the sequences I was able to relax and thoroughly enjoy myself. The breakdown section for arm positions is one of the most comprehensive I've seen yet, and the meditation section that always makes me feel amazing. I gave this a 4 only because there is little to no mention of proper posture, which is essential to bellydance.",1307664000,2,576,4.443396226415095
8057374,5,B00095VJTC,"I like everything about this video; the focus on the basics, the perfect cueing of the instructor, the slow, sensous pace of the drills, the cool, rhythmic music, the wonderful diversity in the class, the non-distracting clothing (you can see the movements)!  I think this is an appropriate drill video for beginners because of the slow, smooth pace and the instructor's excellent instructions.  I also enjoy the meditation warm-up.  Despite the slow and sensous pace of the drills you will be sweating because of the control required to perform the movements.

Sera Solstice, the instructor provides two wonderful performances at the end of the video which is a nice extra feature.  Along with Rachel Brice and Ariellah, Sera Solstice is on my list of favorite tribal dancers. I checked the video preview out on youtube before I purchased it.  I am a bit of an armchair bellydancer and own several bellydance videos.  This one is my new favorite because it is so doable and the movements are sooooooo cool and effective.",1295568000,4,1021,4.935672514619883
8057375,4,B00095VJTC,"There are several really good in depth descriptions of the dvd with thorough break downs of the sections.  I feel that they are all very good.  I love this dvd and the continuous flow style of teaching so that I don't feel like I'm standing there doing drill.  But if you are a beginner, a real beginner, I'd recommend another video.  There's not really a break down of the moves or teaching on how they're supposed to feel or look and a newer dancer who hasn't learned the moves and isolations before might have a hard time following.  Other than that it's really great and for people who are intermediate or advanced beginner this is perfect because it incorporates a lot of basic technique in a really fun innovative format.",1292112000,3,727,4.561538461538461
8057376,4,B00095VJTC,Watched all the way through.  DVD played smoothly and the instructor is very clear on cueing.  I like that there are all sizes and shape of women in this DVD. Looking forward to working on the drills to really ingrain the muscle memory.,1283040000,,236,4.465116279069767
8057377,4,B00095VJTC,"I love this DVD as much as Sera's previous one, and have to agree with other reviewers that this disc is not for absolute beginners and has great conditioning drills.

However, I do not understand why they had to film it with so many students in such a small space, for me it is horribly distracting. If they really wanted to show different body shapes etc, they could have rotated the students Sera breaks down moves with (make each time 3 different ones) instead of cramming all of them in one frame. You cant really see what the ones in back row doing anyway, just arms and legs.

Come on, guys, DO NOT DO THIS. I really want to see the instructor clearly not in a crowd. It is somewhat...intimidating... Not a quiet home practice but a whole bunch of people.... LOL

Loved Sera's performances! She's such a beautiful dancer and teacher!",1280707200,4,840,4.5131578947368425
