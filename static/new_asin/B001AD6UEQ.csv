8277043,4,B001AD6UEQ,"The movie was really cool because it showed Christopher Lee in his first staring role so far as I know. I thought he was doing very well in it. At one point he takes his girlfriend to see some live music and it seems he's watching her more than the performance on stage. I have read his autobiography. He actually used to do that. He'd take girls on dates to musicals, opera I seem to recall and watch their reactions. It was amusing because he figured if the girl could not abide his musical tastes they basically got the gong.  Lol. He would give the girl the side step. So I enjoyed watching him playing his reality on screen. The story is an odd one and didn't end as I expected. My only problem with the film was that it was not transferred to DVD too good. It looked old. But it is an old movie, so I just overlooked that. It made it extra nostalgic in a way. Christopher Lee said he really hated his acting in this film. But I thought he did a good job. One thing is for sure, he climbed a long way to the top from there.",1468800000,,1028,4.064039408866995
8277044,4,B001AD6UEQ,"This is an under-appreciated psychological thriller. Christopher Lee has never been better as the cold, hard-to-like protagonist, haunted by dreams of a murder he may have committed. His febrile sweaty performance carries the film.",1459987200,,231,5.823529411764706
8277045,5,B001AD6UEQ,"Sir Christopher has left us. This is a little piece that I'd never seen before and I am so grateful to Amazon . He's  better here than he ever was as Dracula. It's low budget , better than most. This is a great opportunity for Lee fans to watch the Master at his craft on a bare bones film that showcases his talents. No makeup, no costumes, just Lee doing what he  did  better than anyone else . Thank You Amazon !",1440460800,,415,4.036585365853658
