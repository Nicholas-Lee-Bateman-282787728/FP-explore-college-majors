8629152,2,B00H229C58,"The content is acceptable for people who have never had any background in caregiving... a reasonable starting point. However, the sound quality is really lacking. I had hoped to show this to some spouses in a support group, but I know they will not be able to hear several of the taped conversations and comments. Too bad. I had high hopes for this.",1448755200,,349,4.555555555555555
8629153,5,B00H229C58,I would recommend this book to anyone who is the caregiver for another. You have to take care of yourself in order to care for others. Very useful book!,1389052800,,152,4.275862068965517
