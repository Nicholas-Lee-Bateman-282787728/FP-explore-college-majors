8415023,4,B0043K8MAS,"I'm not a T'Pau fan but I love there hits ""Heart & Soul"" and ""China In Your Hand"". I lived in England at the time these songs were being played, so catchy, and brings memories of my years at England. I had to get this DVD as it's the only DVD to see the band perform. I haven't watched the whole DVD as I only watched the 2 songs I love from this band. The DVD is only in full screen and 2.0 surround, for there only DVD, I can't complain. This does come with a bonus CD.",1367280000,,471,3.816326530612245
8415024,2,B0043K8MAS,"Having fallen in love with the sound of ""Heart and Soul,"" and being lured by a classy video airing on U-Tube, I bought this DVD/CD set with hopes that it would contain the same performance; IT DOES NOT. As the performance proceeds, one wonders whether the live audience is, in fact, alive, asleep, drugged, or otherwise hearing-impaired. The video is, unfortunately, of low quality; far too much camera time is spent on Carol's backup musicians, one of which appears to be dressed to clean out a barn or do yardwork, and another appears to be wearing his wife's top... Carol is a nice looking lady, but the camera seems somewhat clueless about this. There is an interlude where she takes a break, and it becomes ""Guy's Night Out,"" and this really stretches the viewer's patience. Combine this with several nightmarish intrusions of LOUD FEEDBACK HOWL, the product of amateurish handling of the sound system, and the end product is certainly inferior to what I expected. Carol puts forth valiant effort, but this is largely cancelled-out by Montreux's shortcomings, and her supporting Band of Bums (who actually looked classy on the U-Tube clip), making this a Trainwreck Production...

8415025,4,B0043K8MAS,"I am a big admirer of T'Pau, a British band that I discovered back in 1987 and which was never well known in my country. This is the only opportunity (besides some youtube clips available) to see the band perform in its heyday (unless you have a multiregion VCR to see the 2 PAL-VHS available second-hand in the UK -""A View from the Bridge"" and ""Live at Hammersmith"").

Carol Deckers' vocals and energy are a huge ingredient of what the band was; she performs well sans the more sophisticated and -as some critics of the day wrote- ""overproduced"" arrangements (which I like just the same) of the songs included in their first album (produced by Roy Thomas Baker). The band sounds even more like a rock band live, than the pop-rock band of their records.

The response of the Swiss audience is pretty lackluster, but at the end of the concert they tend to be more ""expressive"". The biggest surprise for a fan like me is having had the opportunity of listening to the original arrangements and tempo for the song ""Thank You For Goodbye"" (a favorite); much simpler and effective. It sounds like a totally different song with the upbeat tempo. In fact Carol says that they liked this demo version much better (I guess R.T. Baker's decisions prevailed).",1333584000,2,1248,4.668181818181818
