8565951,2,B00BCJ10CK,"My first question (as with The Day After Halloween last year) is WHY????

Released under the Katarina's Nightmare Theater banner (leading one to believe they will be getting a horror double-bill), this double feature contains two forgotten aussie dramas/thillers with no suspense, gore, atmosphere etc - you know, the things most horror fans want..

The Dreaming was a snoozefest - pretty weak even as a thriller. Female doctor starts having hallucinations of an aboriginal tribe hunting her. Acting is wooden, no special effects to speak of, and the movie spends its time trying to figure out what it wants to accomplish. By the time the so-called ""shocking conclusion"" rolls around, I've already stopped caring. To put it bluntly - the film just plain sucked.

Moving onto The Initiation (not to be confused with the fun early 80's slasher - MUCH better film), this is more of a teen angst drama where a dumb troublemaking kid heads to the Outback to live with his dad, only to cause more trouble and bullying, and ends up getting stranded in the wilderness after a drug deal gone wrong. He spends the rest of the time in self-discovery with the help of a local witch doctor who teaches him a lesson. This is horror how?!? Again, by the end of it - who cares anyway? If I wanted to watch a cheesy time life drama I would look elsewhere.

Keep away from this misleading double feature, as it has no business under the Katarina's Nightmare Theater banner - which is the main reason I am disappointed. I imagine these titles wouldn't sell on their own, which is why they may have lumped them in with great releases like Mortuary, Body Melt, or Satan's Slave etc.

Looking forward to the next actual horror release, but avoid this set unless you want to fall asleep in front of the TV.",1368144000,7,1783,4.665605095541402
