7944510,5,B00005LQ3B,"Wonderful piece for pre-schoolers and kids with autism. Teaches social skills and friendship skills with clear language. Whenever my son gets frightened, he now does what little Bill did to get rid of stage fright.",1269043200,,214,5.142857142857143
7944511,5,B00005LQ3B,"My 3 year old son loves little bill and I truly appreciate the gentle tone of the video including the instrumental jazz music. Little Bill proves that kids TV does not have to be spastic and constantly loud and over the top. I think my son loves Little Bill mostly because he behaves like a real little boy. He is scared of things, happy about things and is human. Not a character made up by a board room (apparently he is based on Bill Cosby as a boy).
In any case, all the videos are excellent but the school one focuses on issues that come up at pre school. A great adjustment if your child in entering school!",1035244800,3,613,4.203389830508475
