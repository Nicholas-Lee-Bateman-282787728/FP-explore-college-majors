4107717,5,B003CAKXAC,"I first saw this movie in Austin, TX in a small theatre which caters to the independent film, and was quite blown away to say the least.  Josh Tickell (upon hearing him speak in the film) does not sound like the kind of guy to become overtly passionate about many things, but the book far surpasses the unassuming cover - his words are heartfelt and his knowledge both frightening and empowering.  He draws upon history and science to make a point that the world is both in the grip of a rather daunting proposition (that of ""Peak oil"") and that it is probably more ready for a ""Green"" revolution than the vast majority of us think... he drives a used cooking oil powered vehicle cross-country, for pete's sake.

The night I saw the film, his mother (who is featured in the film) was there selling his book afterwards.  Mrs. Dupre' is a lovely lady with a powerful presence, and seeing her merely helped to magnify the emotional presence she brought to the film.  That being said, you need not see her in person to feel it... what she brings to Mr. Tickell's film really helps to illuminate the emotional aspect of the Green Movement... something I think so many U.S. citizens (and indeed, a citizen of any industrialized country) often forget.

I recommend this film if you consider yourself not as informed as you might like to be about the Green Movement, and I recommend it even more if you already subscribe to the desire for a more sustainable world, as this movie will only bolster your resolve.",1282694400,2,1502,4.585820895522388
4107718,5,B003CAKXAC,"Tickell deserves an Oscar for this, truly. He links together so many disparate threads that have been woven together into America's oil addiction, and exported in the form of wars, pollution and so many other ills, and he does it with an unsparing eye for the truth as well as a fine sense of humor. There's also plenty of rage and disbelief, as befits any study of our present greed and selfishness, and Tickell ain't afraid to show how deep the corruption goes.

He details the oil companies' secret meetings with Cheney to draft plans for taking over Iran's oil fields...months before 9/11. The obvious non-leap of logic is casually moved past; Tickell is too smart to get caught up by the corporate media as a conspiracy nut, which is funny as most everything here is pure conspiracy fact, from Reagan taking down Carter's solar panels to the cover up of the oil spills during Katrina, which taxpayers are paying for, not the companies that caused them.

And how about the timing of the stuff in here about the Gulf, and oil companies having to drill so deeply and dangerously there? I just saw another interview on the news tonight with various local Louisiana officials who by this point, 70 days in, feel that BP and Obama are purposely stalling relief efforts, but can't figure out why. A close reading of this film might answer some of those questions.

One thing Fuel makes clear is how much power lies in controlling oil, and stopping alternative fuels. Among the many highlights here are the details of Rudolf Diesel's mysterious disappearance at sea, and how Prohibition started one year after Ford went into biofuels instead of oil and how Prohibition ended months after Ford quit using it because Prohibition had made it too expensive to make. Just one of sooo many ""coincidences"" around the history of oil in America. WMDs and many other lies are also mentioned along the way.

In other words, Tickell's long study of the subject has clearly led him to the actual facts of the matter, and he lays it out here. Our wars make perfect sense in this light, insane as they are, and our present messes in the Gulf of Mexico and in Iraq and Afghanistan are indeed all about oil, and our greed for it. Compared to the enlightened policies of Germany and Sweden---shown here in all their common sense, which we sadly lack---the USA is clearly not leading the world in anything but idiocy, while helping destroy it with great haste. No wonder this film had such a low profile upon release. It's too full of truth!

Well done, Mr. Tickell. Some of us are listening. My home has been solar powered since 2005, and I do everything I can to reduce my carbon footprint. I do wish the massive oil savings of eating vegetarian had been discussed here, and a number of other conservation ideas as well, but it's hard to get everything in one film, and the many pluses of Fuel outweigh any minuses. We need a hundred more films like this, and I think our present messes are going to wake us all up to these facts in a hurry. But I've been thinking that for decades. Maybe we really are destined to be the next dodo birds. If so, those who find our remnants can watch this and see that at least some folks knew what was really going on.

Can't recommend this movie enough to anybody, period. If ever there was a film that every schoolkid and adult alike should see, Fuel is it.",1278374400,8,3373,4.56694214876033
4107719,5,B003CAKXAC,"Widescreen Edition DVD being released June 22, 2010

""Fuel"" is a Sundance Audience Award-Winning documentary about biofuel directed by biofuel visionary, Josh Tickell who was named as a UN Goodwill Ambassador on renewable energy. Tickell explores America's reliance on oil and his own history of biodiesel use traveling the country in his Veggie Van to spread awareness.

This movie was made by the first time director and narrator of the film over the course of eleven years with interviews with politicians, historians, professors, and celebrity activists. Josh Tickell was raised in one of the country's higher oil producing regions and got to see up close the impact of the industry's control over people and the environment. After his own mother became very sick, he decided something needed to be done about this problem and got to work creating this film.

There is something refreshing about the fact that his section on the economic stimulus package for purchasing off-road heavier vehicles is already out of date since Hummers are no longer being developed. There is a focus on the demand for the Toyota Prius (which is also old news since the recall began on those), but the ultimate conclusion is that being able to use an electric car with a diesel engine running on biodiesel fuel would run more efficiently and better for the environment beyond any current Hybrid models.

For a while, it seemed like biofuel was really taking off with all the celebrity support and good press it was getting. Some familiar celebrity faces in this documentary include Sheryl Crow, Larry David, Woody Harrelson, Robert Kennedy Jr., Willie Nelson, and Julia Roberts. Then suddenly a couple of articles were released professing all the health problems that might come out of using biofuel and progress stopped.

Tickell breaks down all the math of the efficiency of gasoline versus biofuel and the effects on the environment and our health. For every one unit of energy put into creating gasoline, only 80% energy comes out of it. Alternative energy sources are crucial to curing America's addiction to oil and several are discussed besides vegetable oil. These sources give our country more hope for the future and as a nation, we all need to alert our government representatives to our desire for this change.

The tragedy of 9/11 initiated an awareness of the security component of energy dependence. Hurricane Katrina is another tragic event that created awareness on an another level for environmental issues we are all facing in our ever changing global condition. This film offers several ideas for how people can get involved to make a difference. There are tons of things you can do!

In conjunction with the release of this film, a cross-country tour of 25 stops was organized by the Veggie Van Organization featuring Tickell, co-producer Rebecca Harrell, and the world's first plug-in hybrid automobile, the Algeaus which runs on a blend of algae-based, renewable gasoline and gets 150 miles per gallon.

Bonus Features:

There is an extra about sustainable Biodiesel with HERObx, a company started to show agricultural waste can be turned into biofuels. What is fantastic about this company is that not only are they are on their second and third generations of their product but in a time when car companies are laying off workers left and right, they are hiring some of these laid off workers, particularly in Erie, PA. The people have been hit hard there and this is educating their children about alternative energy resources.

Building a green bottom line with John Paul DeJoria showcases the Paul Mitchell systems and the Patron Spirits company going green and how it has changed the outlook for their customers and how they continue to further their efforts with a groovy biodiesel train.

There is a quick featurette on the new Prius that will have a plug and be completely dependent on electricity. It will have a back-up source of gasoline but it won't go into use unless the electric battery runs down completely. It only has to be plugged in for six hours to get a full charge and can run 80 to 100 miles per gallon which is only pennies to the gallon. There is no word on how much of a toll the charging takes on your electric bill if you don't have solar panels but there is no doubt it has a much lesser effect on the environment. One claim was that driving from Alaska to Florida would produce less harmful emissions to the atmosphere than one can of aerosol spray.

There is an extra on how to save thousands through energy efficiency with six suggestions: 1) Switch your electric provider, 2) Control temperature, 3) Switch light bulbs, 4) Reduce phantom power, 5) Weatherize your home, and 6) Reduce water flow.

Besides all those extras, there is also Director and creative team commentary where they talk about how they chose the focus of the film, the sources of their information, and other discoveries made along the way. And lastly, there is DVD-ROM content that includes Tickell's complete book From the Fryer to the Fuel Tank as a downloadable pdf which includes directions on how to make fuel for under a dollar per gallon, how to run your vehicle on straight vegetable oil, and how to tmake a machine that automates your fuel processing, all in eco-friendly packaging and disc!",1277078400,11,5313,4.909698996655519
4107720,5,B003CAKXAC,"In this movie there is an interview with a former oil executive who stated that drilling in the Gulf of Mexico is as difficult as going to the moon.  BP has certainly proven that to be the case.  Besides being prescient, this movie, that was ten years in the making, is clearly thought out, powerfully eloquent yet humble.  In a very personal way it starts off and states the oil problem clearly. If you are depressed about the Gulf of Mexico oil leak you need to watch this film because the second half is uplifting.  The documentary proposes a sensible solution or more accurately a plausible energy and environmental vision for the United States of America.  This movie is sad, funny, optimistic and exciting.

It is obvious that the movie was made by a very dedicated cast and crew, a resourceful editor, as well as a creative cinematographer and director. It is without doubt a very professional production, with excellent actors throughout - a very sad story though! Alas, as in the Greek tragedies there is no feel-good happy ending. In my view, the issues about child abandonment, drug addiction, child molestation, battered women etc. were handled with sensitivity and discretion.

Then they scream because they got their wish and now their income from fuel tax is dwindling.  So they put an excise tax on the price per gallon at the pump. They still scream they want more money so the plan is to put a gps device on all vehicles and tax by the miles driven. In January Jerry Brown has a nice surprise planed, a new form of a carbon tax will be enacted. Predictions are that it can increase the price of a gallon of fuel by as much as $1.40 per gallon. Yes I drive a hybrid and I like it. However, they are going to screw over you no matter what type of fuel you use, even if you can get 150 mpg.

Interesting stories throughout this documentary. I never knew that Henry Ford designed his first cars to run on Ethanol. And it was revealed that this was the REAL reason that Prohibition was passed because of the huge influence Rockefeller had on Washington and he wanted everyone to use gasoline instead of Ethanol. This was not conjecture on the part of the documentary film's maker. It was fact.
Plus, I never knew all the facts about Rudolph Diesel and his disappearance on a cruise ship. We all know that Diesel originally designed his engine to run on vegetable oil. This documentary states that at the time of his disappearance Diesel was very wealthy. I went to one of the Internet encyclopedias and it said that at the time of his death Diesel was nearly broke. Who knows? Mysterious to this very day.

4107755,3,B003CAKXAC,"I was insulted by the beginning subtle insinuation that 9/11 was an inside job.  ""We might never know what happened on that day.""  What?

From there it improves, but eventually delves into the energy grid needlessly, which is not particularly relevant to the liquid fuel market and dilutes (nice pun, I might add) their message and argument.  Too much of the film relates to self-interested green companies, expensive & esoteric proprietary properties, and future technologies that aren't yet developed or are rather ridiculous to believe they could be afforded.  I half-expected biofuel personal jetpacks to be thrown in there somewhere.  My suspicion is this film was allowed to be made and released (and not just an internet-only release) because its opinions are not a present threat to the petroleum industry and certain ""elites.""

Fuel has hip concepts that are not all economically feasible on a wide scale, relies on an absurdly complex and diverse collection of policy recommendations, has bought into the myth of energy independence, is unfortunately focused on supply-side market manipulation (mandates at the pump, subsidies, etc.), and is backed by mostly profiteering green company CEOs and famous entertainment personalities.  Too much of it is either small-time & local-only or is far-flung & fanciful.  The one area it takes on outside of this is biodiesel, which is the main focus throughout the film and popular with Hollywood, but on a large-scale is chiefly tied to GMO soybeans controlled by just a few mega-corporations involved with various domestic & international shenanigans.  Regardless, it's also about 25% more expensive than regular diesel, which is a hurdle to mass changeover in spite of its lower toxicity and the fact that all diesel engines can already use it.

I think Anne Korin, Robert Zubrin, James Woolsey, and Nobel Laureate George Olah have a more concise, cogent, economically-feasible, and market-sound idea that better addresses national security and could be immediately implemented with the Open Fuel Standards Act making its way through Congress.  We need a simple policy that will reform not just us, but China, India, and Africa, and also simultaneously defang OPEC.  It begins with a demand-side flex-fuel mandate that requires all new gasoline cars also be capable of burning alcohols (a cheap feature), including methanol, and the elimination of alcohol and sugar import tariffs and quota limits.  While not required, it would also help to stop subsidizing corn and undercutting third-world farmers, many of whom sneak into the USA looking for work.  From there, the market will have an incentive for the mass production of methanol from plentiful natural gas, even prior to more exotic types of biofuels.  And by the way, the highest-grade diesel is made from alcohols.  All plastics can also be made from alcohols.  Gas would drop in price overnight.

If you disregard the hints of Truther fringe, hippy vegan & Gaia sentiments, and the green marketing slogans, Fuel is a valid look at the history that got us into this mess and various long-term solutions.  But it has little chance of making timely worldwide impact with such a convoluted message, not to mention lower chance of success in the short-term.  Nonetheless, it is certainly an improved message over the status quo and offers interesting information that much of the public would still benefit being exposed to.",1323648000,2,3430,5.211293260473588

4107762,3,B003CAKXAC,"One of the most important aspects of the energy problem that the filmmaker left out: exponential world population growth. A combination of different alternative energies may work if we reallocate energy and resources now for our current world population of 6.5 billion, but it is projected that total human population will double in the next 40 years. So over the next few decades, solving the problem will be made much more difficult as we will reach a point in our chilren's lifetime in which human population goes beyond the ability of our planet to sustain it, even with altnernative energy soureces. Also, it may be helpful to balance this movie with a reading from The Post Carbon Reader by David Fridley: ""Nine Challenges for Alternative Energy."" Putting all of this alternative energy into place in time will be very difficult, and America and it's leaders are still focusing on oil and not putting enough into these solutions.",1307404800,,935,4.961783439490445
4107763,5,B003CAKXAC,"Josh is so upbeat and sincere that he makes the film pleasant despite the intensely painful implications about our national lifestyle related to transportation. His childhood spent near oil refining is moving. He gives some insights I had not seen before weaving in the history behind why America is hooked on oil for transportation. We saw the premiere of the film and set a goal to convert our fleet to energy efficient biodiesel and we're 2/3 way there. We finally found a 1981 Diesel Rabbit Pickup that gets 50mpg and we can blend biodiesel to reduce reliance on fossil fuel even more. The powers that be have made it very difficult to do the right thing; watch ""Who Killed the Electric Car?"" for another facet of how we got where we are. This is a very important film to support activism on many issues:  (a) the lack of capacity to safely drill oil in deep oceans, (b) the responsibility of the oil companies to clean up their messes, (c) why do we have to wait til 2025 to be able to buy the fuel efficient cars that the industry has long known how to make?  We keep looking for how to cut fuel consumption: live next to our jobs, pay for bus passes and bicycles for employees, carpool and do several things in one trip, or we just don't go.",1304553600,2,1248,4.421739130434783
4107764,3,B003CAKXAC,"Worth a watch,but nothing really new here. The biggest change that has to happen is our mindset to energy. How come when they talk of 150mpg hybrids they never seem to take into account the electricity they use? Do they get their power for free? Biodiesel is over rated,very little if any is made without fossil derived methanol,so its at least 20% fossil fuel. Virtually nothing on ethanol,except that making it from a huge monoculture crop ie corn isn't a very good idea. There are many more better ways to make ethanol,which ultimately will become our future fuel.",1304121600,7,567,4.795918367346939

Watch this movie and you will feel GOOD.  you will feel that you can make a difference.  You will be encouraged by all the people working to make it easier for you and I to make difference and you will feel inspired. :)

A great eye opener and interesting takes on recent current events and their connections to the petrol-chem industry.",1300924800,,490,4.293478260869565
4107766,5,B003CAKXAC,"The Most Hopeful & Meaningful Documentary I've Ever Seen! An outstanding film - FUEL! You won't be worried about our society running out of oil & there's things you can do NOW to get ready for changes to come! The unofficial sequel to ""An Inconvenient Truth"" with ACTUAL SOLUTIONS!! I wish there were more documentaries made where they focus not just on the PROBLEMS but actually OFFER IDEAS and SOLUTIONS to the problems.  Think of Inconvenient Truth where Al Gore showed us maps of coastal flooding and large portions of the world under water and watch it to the end where his SOLUTIONS?? are to turn off the lights when you leave the house and buy energy-efficient bulbs.  It just felt depressing overall but this movie is a beam of hope and a joy to watch that is so rare in documentaries -- all done with a great slice of humor!  Thank you Josh Tickell for this outstanding production and all your research and efforts!",1299369600,2,924,4.587878787878788
4107767,1,B003CAKXAC,"I began to watch this film because of my interest in bio-fuels. It promised bio-fuel and delivered politics. This film could have done much to put forward viable alternative fuels, and for a few minutes it did. Shortly after the start of the film it seemed to have stopped talking about alternative energy all together and began to babble about the politics of oil.

I expected more science, more talk about FUEL, and less politics. That wouldn't be a problem because politics have large role in the viability of almost anything, but at this point, you can alienate 50% of people. This film, in my opinion, has a liberal bias, which can put off conservative viewers from being open to viable bio-fuels.

Talking about the politics of the past is not helpful in promoting the fuels of the future.

Instead of this, watch ""King Corn"" or some other similar documentaries.",1298332800,8,868,4.773333333333333
4107768,5,B003CAKXAC,"A film is for those who refuse to accept ignorance as one of their values. This documentary is a production success filled with sobering truth about our current state of oil dependence, while providing uplifting optimism about the potential for a bright future. Accompanied by a great cast of guest speakers, this film is one of the best documentaries I've seen. Highly recommended.",1297123200,4,382,5.079365079365079
4107769,5,B003CAKXAC,"This documentary has a coordinated multi-modal approach that touches upon:

1.) geology, biochemistry, and ecology in the sciences;

2.) business history, speculation, financial trends and machinations in economics including John D. Rockefeller vs. Henry Ford on fueling alternatives (yes, Ford did not win that one), and more recently, the G.W. Bush administration's possible incentive for the Iraq invasion;

3.) biofuels engineering concepts and creation from cooking grease to algae; sustainable energy from solar, wind, tidal power, and retrofitting for energy conservation (wish they had a few more minutes on conservation since that is one thing everyone can do whatever their economic circumstance).

4.) The special features has about 20 minutes of informative and practical data on four energy topics.

The writer and narrator also spins his personal life into the frabric of the work in an effective way. He leaves no doubt as to what drew and draws him to this topic and project now and into the future. This film shines some light upon this topic and I highly recommend it as one who does think and worry about the future we will leave our children and their children.",1296086400,10,1181,5.1947368421052635
4107770,1,B003CAKXAC,"While this film had much potential, it slipped into the Michael Moore type of documentary. It accomplished this in that it was so conspiratorial, disrespectful to our armed forces, and flat out nonfactual that it was sickening. By the way, I am a HUGE fan of Algae biofuels and recycling vegetable oil, so don't even go there.  Instead of Mr. Tickell focusing on the status quo (petroleum), and then offering his alternative (biofuels), he focused on major outrageous leftist claims, without any sense of moderate solutions. One of the outrages claims purported was that the United States went to Iraq and Afghanistan because of oil. This could not be any farther from the truth. Private contractors within the USA get LESS than 1% of oil from Iraq. Besides that, the armed forces are portrayed as bullies and as the bad guys. Not to mention, he had the discredited former so-called ""Green Jobs"" czar and self-proclaimed communist and 9/11 truther Van Jones on. None of this will win over any people who are uninformed, or unsure, or even opposed, to biofuels. Its a worthy cause, but this approach was completely ill-conceived, that the only people it will win over, are the ones already on that side.",1290643200,8,1202,4.863414634146341
4107771,5,B003CAKXAC,"Though this documentary mainly advocates bio-diesel, in the end calls for a cocktail to fill a sustainable barrel of oil that includes sustainable biofuels, biomass, solar and wind energy, energy efficiency, plug-in electric cars, public transportation, and non-motorized transportation.

Several very interesting real world case studies are presented, and the food vs. fuel debate is also covered. A must see for those interested in renewable fuels and energy independence.",1288569600,,474,5.869565217391305
