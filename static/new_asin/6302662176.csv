7828752,1,6302662176,"After reading the Fat Burning Workout book, I was excited to find out that Joyce Vedral had a video to go along with it. I purchased both the regular and Intensity Fat Burning Workout videos and wow, was I ever disappointed!

She rushes through the exercises, loses track of how many reps she's done, and basically seems to have not done any kind of rehearsal for this video. Even her two cohorts seem confused at times.

Worst of all, I bought these from her website and stupidly signed up for her newsletter, from which there's no way to unsubscribe!

Buy Leslie Sansone videos instead. She's great!",1128297600,,601,4.650943396226415

If you stick with it, you'll learn it just fine though and if you're a veteran weight trainer, you'll be just fine too.  This will shape you up !!  Give it a try!",1029974400,4,265,3.8703703703703702
