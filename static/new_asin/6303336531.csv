7843751,2,6303336531,"This two-tape VHS set of The History of Baseball could have been so much better if the producers and writers didn't make so many factual errors and typos/misspellings of words.  I mean, come on - if you're going to go through the trouble of making a historical video such as this, GET YOUR FACTS RIGHT!!!!!  This video is littered with tons of errors, but the biggest ones that just jump out at me are the following:

1. Gee, I didn't know Babe Ruth hit 713 career home runs.  I thought 714 was one of the most famous numbers in all of sports.
2. Gee, I didn't know Ty Cobb stole 96 bases in 1913.  I always thought it was 1915.
3. Gee, I didn't know Rogers Hornsby led the National League in base hits in 1929 with 156.  I thought he scored 156 runs in 1929 and led the league with 229 hits.
4. Gee, I didn't know Carl Yastrzemski hit .400 in 1967.  I thought the last man to hit .400 was Ted Williams in 1941 when he hit .406.

That's the thing about so many people today - they get their facts wrong, don't research anything, don't proofread anything, and just don't care about accuracy.  Instead, it's all about hurrying up so they can punch out at 5:00 and go out partying.  In this case, being that it's a video sold in stores where people will shell out money for this item, it's even more inexcusable that the people who made this are selling it and making money off this heap of historical errors.

Not recommended.  No wonder it's selling for 49 cents right now on Amazon.",1335571200,,1482,4.272401433691757
7843752,2,6303336531,"Unfortunatly, this video on the history of baseball is flawed.  The writers and producers of the film seemingly know little or nothing about the game as their are numerous factual errors and misspelling of names  (Honous Wagner? ).  It doesn't flow very well, either and the portions  of facts that are accurate are displayed in an often-not-understandable  fashion.  The lone bright spot is a rare clip from a silent movie starring  Babe Ruth, circa 1925.",950400000,5,456,5.0
