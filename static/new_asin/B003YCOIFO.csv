4228329,5,B003YCOIFO,"This is a gritty, no nonsense show that this not for young children, as there are realistic battle scenes.  If you like action and adventure, this show is a must watch, as there are very few slow parts.  It also feels like a history lesson and a travel show because of all of the places they take you.  This is a war drama unlike any I have seen before.",1468454400,,353,4.086956521739131

4228331,5,B003YCOIFO,Outstanding realism which my uncle said was very much what he experienced.  He fought under Patton in France before he was wounded by a German machine gun bullet.  These men who fought WW2 are the best of the best.  We shall not see their like again.,1468454400,,250,4.391304347826087

4228335,1,B003YCOIFO,"Oh, I like the show - a bit too graphic, but character development excellent.  But in season 1 episode 9 the producers stuck in a gratuitous  explicit graphic sex scene - stuck it in just to get the ""mature"" rating to draw the sleazy demographic.... movie/television industry executives are all disgusting filth mongerers",1527724800,,321,5.037735849056604
4228336,5,B003YCOIFO,"I'm not sure how you could find any fault in the Band of Brother Series. Put Spielberg and Hanks together, along with an incredible pool of amazingly talented actors, and snippets of interviews with the actual soldiers and you have a masterpiece on your hands.

I won't go much into descriptions, as most is in the main synopsis, and in most reviews. But I will say that I first watched this in its entirety about 15 years ago, when I was about 24. And I'm a female. And I'm not a big war movie person, or history buff. I watched one episode and was hooked. Binge watched til I was done. I've watched this entire series over 25 times from start to finish and it NEVER gets old.

Its real, and honest and poignant and you get so swept up in it and feel like you know all the soldiers by time you've gone through the whole thing.

Do not dismiss this... everyone should watch it. It's important and captivating, it's horrific and beautiful, it's necessary and iconic.",1527552000,,965,4.410112359550562
4228337,5,B003YCOIFO,"Every time I finish watching this, I think about starting it again. It is so well done and I experience every emotion as I watch. The last episode always gets me and gives me just a glimpse into what they experienced. I recommend this series to  anyone who thinks they might be interested. You might cry a bit, like I do, but you won't regret this. It's indescribably good.",1527379200,,373,4.405797101449275
4228338,5,B003YCOIFO,"I watched this series on a recommendation of my English teacher's. It's very well researched, very moving. It makes you sympathize and even feel that you empathize with these men. It makes you feel incredibly patriotic.",1527292800,,219,5.111111111111111

4228342,5,B003YCOIFO,"A masterpiece in every way. From the first minute to the last. A wonderful tribute to our WWII veterans while also fairly depicting their flaws too.
Over the years, I've purchased this on VHS, DVD and Bluray and I will buy it again if it is ever released on 4K.
Thanks to Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg for this masterpiece, and another masterpiece, The Pacific, as well.",1526947200,,371,4.552238805970149
4228343,5,B003YCOIFO,Almost twenty five thousand reviews and zero one or two star reviews. That alone should be all you need to know about this show. This appears to be realistic take on what World War II was like.,1526601600,,193,4.243243243243243

4228381,5,B003YCOIFO,"Like the Walking Dead,I discovered Band of Brothers years after it originally aired on TV.I loved every episode,and have watched some of them 3 or 4 times. I served in the Army myself,and my grandfather Donald Bytheway fought in WWII in the Pacific. What makes this ""series"" so interesting is its really more of a drama/documentary,these guys really existed. I was so interested,and drawn by the nostalgia,that I began to Google Dick Winters,Bill Guarnere,and Easy Company,and I turned up a bunch of really interesting documentaries and live interviews with a lot of Easy Company men before they passed away. It was a really weird feeling to listen to the real men tell their stories after watching Band of Brothers. I also searched Nixon Nitration works,in Nixon New Jersey,and sure enough it was an industrial town located in what is now called Edison NJ,named(unofficialy) after Lewis Nixon's father,which processed ammonium nitrate. The information about Nixon Nitration works was a whole other interesting story in itself,as it made explosive materials for both WWI,and WWII,and was the scene of an horrific explosion in 1924,that killed 20 people. This 10 episode series gave me hours of interesting,and educational entertainment. I have a deep respect for my grandparents,and The Greatest Generation,and I love how they ""got the job done"",they were a generation that didn't make excuses,and did what they had to do.",1519257600,,1422,5.2687224669603525
4228382,5,B003YCOIFO,"My Dad and I have made it a tradition to watch Band of Brothers during the holidays, but our DVD's were starting to skip so I decided to upgrade us to Blu-Ray and it is even better. The tradition lives on in higher quality. By far the best WW2 depiction Hollywood has to offer.",1519257600,,277,4.148148148148148

4228392,5,B003YCOIFO,"As others have said far better than I, this is simply the best account of WWII to ever be produced.  Every aspect of storytelling, acting and overall production is done nearly perfectly.  Nobody who ever invests the ten hours plus to watch this series from beginning to end will forget the experience.  From start to finish, Band of Brothers is engaging on every level. I don't think there's a more powerful series involving WWII that's ever been produced by anyone.  If you take the time to watch BoB, you will be rewarded many, many times over.  Truly remarkable.",1517702400,,565,4.724489795918367

4228394,5,B003YCOIFO,whats not to like about this excellent movie,1517443200,,44,4.625
4228395,5,B003YCOIFO,"Without doubt one of history's most important and crucial glimpses into a time where complete devotion was given by the butt of his rifle, and the yells of battle, and the bondage of soldiers during wartime. This is not to deny it's existence today, but rather a time of great conflict in all theatres of a global conflict.

Band of Brothers is something, I believe, our children, children's children and so forth need watch in order to actually grasp and understand what these men, and those men, from all sides of the war, gave to their last breath, footstep, and indeed action in such a horrific war to second the ""war to end all wars"".

Something to take from this versus the other American theatre ""The Pacific"", this one focuses more on the themes and brotherhoods formed by the actions of these men. The Pacific, while also amazing and important to watch at least once, focuses on the emotional trauma and ways the US Marine Corps improvised, utilized, and eventually take the Pacific theatre. Thus said, both are worthy of watching (unfortunately Prime does not include the interviews of the veteran soldiers who are played by the actors in ""The Pacific"").

May we always use this Mini-series as a testament to time that wars are not won with guns or wits, but soldiers; brothers (and now sisters) in arms. That said, no war won is given without great sacrifice. These men know (knew), and so should we.

""Currahee, Hi-Ho-Silver!"" (and Semper Fidelis), and God bless you veterans old and new, young and fragile; brave and heroic.",1517356800,,1537,4.7669172932330826

4228407,5,B003YCOIFO,"Just perfect. More than a decade after first watching this series, it still both warms and breaks my heart. Every character is real and complete, and the situations they are in are handled with total historical accuracy, even when the focus is on their personal reactions. It manages to be both totally universal, in showing the bond between men at war, and specifically American - what must they have thought, those men not much more than boys, sent thousands of miles from home to deal with an Old World war in the mixed bag of alien cultures which is Europe? The characters of the different countries they fight in are portrayed very accurately. As a Brit,I find the scenes set in England have none of the usual cliches found in war films. They show a very poignant and honest view of the England of my parents and grandparents. I'd like to say thank you to this 'band of brothers' and all the others like them - and to those who never made it back home, God Bless, and rest in peace in the foreign lands you saved from themselves.",1516665600,,1034,4.476190476190476

4228412,5,B003YCOIFO,"Best WW2 war story ever to hit the screen. I am envious of the bond these men share, something no one that hasn't experienced can understand, something I don't fully understand.

4228430,1,B003YCOIFO,"gotta be jokin ... i played a solid seventeen minutes of the new ""CALL OF DUTY; WORLD AT WAR CHAPTER 2"" and truly experienced combat firsthand. This kid's show does WW1 terribly, completely inaccurate weapons and vehicles. the tank didn't exist in the 60s dumb faces.... dummie dummie.... worst HBO show since breaking the badness.",1512691200,5,331,5.036363636363636
4228431,5,B003YCOIFO,"While Band of Brothers is certainly a great and epic war film, it is so much more.  It is a truly powerful story of camaraderie, perseverance, and the faith of men, in those standing beside them, in the most horrible of situations.  It is, at it's root, a complex series of character studies, wonderfully produced and presented.  Honestly, words are not sufficient to describe just how wonderful is Band of Brothers.

The ensemble cast is easily one of the best ever assembled, and all of the actors in this series are absolutely brilliant.  If there are any standouts, in my mind they would be Damien Lewis and Donald Wahlberg.  But again, the entire cast is amazing.

The manner in which this series is presented is practically flawless.  Each episode was magnificently directed, shot, and edited, and scored.  In my mind, Band of Brothers is truly a landmark achievement in film.  It is one of the most moving pieces of entertainment I have ever seen, in my entire life.",1512432000,2,973,4.738095238095238

8409013,5,B003YCOIFO,"Wow, simply wow!  This series paints an emotionally evocative rendering of a group of boys who fought ""tooth and nail"" for each other and in the process for every American during a turning point in world history.  It is an example of how war can bring out the worst and very best in folks who are committed through life and death to each other.",1528761600,,344,4.359375
8409014,5,B003YCOIFO,"I love the show. It feels so real. I feel like I can appreciate what WWII Vets went through much better after watching. I had no idea what it was like for them. The show does a good job making you feel like you're there with them. You feel for the characters as if they are your own brothers. They make the big questions of battle paramount to the show - How does a soldier deal with fear? What do soldiers feel about the enemy?

Just be forewarned, it is gory. I expected that much in a military film. But, there is also a very explicit sex scene in the 9th episode. There's no lead-up, it just switches to the scene in straight nudity. I wish they didn't put it in. I don't think it added anything to the show, and it left me with a very bad taste after such a wonderful experience with the previous 8 episodes.",1528675200,,813,4.113207547169812

8409017,5,B003YCOIFO,"For anyone who didn't know, this show is special because all the costumes weapons and most of the explosions are real.  The actors spent a lot of time talking personally to the actually 101 airborne veterans that are shown in the show.  It is as authentic as you're gonna get.",1528502400,,276,4.5
8409018,5,B003YCOIFO,"This outstanding series is based on the experiences of a unit of men who formed a life long bond through training and battle in a WWII flight platoon.  Specific emphasis was focused on good leadership qualities and bad leadership, along with the outcome of each; good/positive always the best choice. The story unfolded as they worked together to overcome the many obstacles that were put in front of them on their journey from training, wartime and daily life. There was nothing at all ""Easy"" about their unit other than the name itself. Jumping out of perfectly good airplanes was probably the easiest thing they ever did. Through it all, to hell and back again, their shared experiences they formed a bond that stretched a lifetime.",1528329600,,735,4.88
