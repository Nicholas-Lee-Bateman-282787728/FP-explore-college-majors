8352512,5,B0026DOR1W,"While this Fit and Functional instructional DVD is the perfect tool for a beginner it could also be used to vary or improve an established exercise regime.  Chris demonstrates and clearly verbalizes the proper way to perform each exercise, explains the benefits achieved by each one and why it is necessary to do them correctly.  He emphasizes the need to master one step before moving to the next in the sequence of the program.  These exercises are designed to increase coordination, functional strength and fat burning.

Each chapter of this DVD explains new exercises and warns of pitfalls that may be encountered if not done correctly.  Chris emphasizes the need to be ready before moving on to each next step on the video. I highly recommend this easy to understand, easy to use instructional video.",1243728000,3,805,4.933333333333334
8352513,5,B0026DOR1W,"I'm a beginner who tends to be somewhat clumsy when learning new moves or routines.  I need to see the exercise a few times, then review it and do it over and over before I seem to ""get it.""  This DVD has helped to bring home the moves and proper form Chris teaches in his personal training sessions. It's clear and easy to understand, and not full of hard to understand terminology.  I like that most of the exercises do not require expensive equipment to do them.  I highly recommend it!",1243382400,,489,4.34065934065934
8352514,4,B0026DOR1W,"This is the exercise DVD for everyone! I really liked how Fit-n-Functional's exercises were adaptable to any fitness level. This is great for young and old, novice or advanced. Mr. Nerat is obviously very knowledgable and his no-nonsense methods of teaching are clear and precise. Even if you been exercising for years, as I have been, there is plenty here to get you out of the same old workout rut and into a new level of fitness. Exercises are clearly explained and nicely demonstrated.",1242604800,4,489,4.833333333333333
8352515,5,B0026DOR1W,"Super all-round strength-training video!  Instead of featuring toothpick thin models with no muscle tone using cute li'l 3 pound dumbbells, or scary pumped-up young men hoisting massive weights, this video features real people and a realistic workout.  An excellent choice for someone starting into resistance training.  I particularly liked the segments where he shows how strength training can translate to everyday life activities.  Mr. Nerat's style is common-sense and low-key, not at all intimidating, and I think this DVD is a great value for the money!  He also covers some more advanced techniques later on, for when you need that next challenge.  I would highly recommend this DVD.",1242000000,3,691,5.351851851851852
