7855603,5,6303924948,"For those who haven't bought it, I'm not going to spoil it, but if you are into some pretty deep plots involving the mob and such, this is a great one and it has twists in it that will blow your mind!  Ben Cross is great at being a bad a** when he plays one, and it shows in here! He's even got the Italian accent down.  He should have gotten some kudos for this as well as the other actors in here, but even before crime shows became big, this movie gives you some insight as to why his character (Carlo) is the way he is via a few flashback scenes. It sort of has a ring of CBS's ""Cold Case"" to it to me because of the scenes that flash back to the parents. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what the hell is going to happen next if you never saw it. There is nothing slow moving about the plot. Just get it if you haven't gotten it yet. It is well worth the money spent. Frank Rossi is excellent, but it is clear that this picture is pretty much a Ben Cross picture.  Ben brings out the paranoia and all the other darkeness of this guy out, but he also brings out a soft side (yes there is one) too and you'll figure out where that is. Like I said, I won't spoil it.",1257292800,,1195,3.889344262295082
7855604,3,6303924948,Lance Henriksen is one of my favorite actors and I viewed this movie for that reason.  Not enough of Lance H. in it.  I think he is a highly underated actor.,947721600,4,157,4.032258064516129
