8660103,3,B00KMJB5K8,"Gritty up-north England where everybody is looking to escape misery. Don't get me wrong, its a good story and its got that English sense of dry humour that they find funny. Is it as compelling as Punchline? Its not got Tom Hanks or Sally Field, but the characters are likable and their are some great one-liners. I'd give it a 4 except that it is not American,but that's okay.",1415750400,,376,4.463768115942029
