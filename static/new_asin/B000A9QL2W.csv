8076488,4,B000A9QL2W,"These transfers aren't great, but they are watchable! I only watched The Ghost and Nightmare Castle, so far and it was well worth the $4 I spent. I will buy better prints of these 2 films, but I do not regret my purchase at all.",1374278400,,228,4.088888888888889
8076489,1,B000A9QL2W,"Even tho' the movies assembled here have a lot to recommend them (Barbara Steele in 2 of the selections: ""Nightmare Castle"" & ""The Ghost"", Vincent Price in ""House on Haunted Hill"") the presentation in laughably bad - and the claim that these are ""remastered"" prints is the scariest thing about this set!  You'll see waves and jumps from what appears to be filmed copies of movies from TV and Movie Screens ... at one point in ""Dominique is Dead"" you actually see the frame shift back into sync!  Amazing!  It almost adds to the experience of watching bad B-movies, but even these are better than average selections and deserve better treatment - unless you want to re-live the days of bad tv reception & grindhouse movie projection from when these movies were first released.  If not - BEWARE!",1175385600,11,793,4.72463768115942
