2325995,5,B0009VXMOQ,I bought dozens of exercise tapes while trying to find something my elderly mother could do in her home to remain active.  This exercise routine is the best of the lot.  I actually look forward to doing it each day.,1257292800,,215,4.35
2325996,4,B0009VXMOQ,"My Seniors exercise group has used the VHS for several years.  They love the music because it's peppy and it helps ""set"" the exercise in their minds.  It's been used enough that the accent and speed aren't a problem.  I'm buying the DVD.  Future older people may find this dated but many current seniors don't disco.  They square dance or do line dancing & some of the exercises reflect such movements.",1227225600,,402,4.605633802816901
2325997,2,B0009VXMOQ,"This exercise video has a few negatives that make me give it less than a favorable review:
1. Outdated.
2. Transitions are too quick and verbal cues too fast for an elder person with limited mobility and/or cognition to follow.
3. No adapted exercises shown or discussed.
4. Tested video with a group of 12 senior citizens with limited mobility due to arthritis and most did not like the speed or format of the exerise program.",1189728000,9,427,4.631578947368421
2325998,5,B0009VXMOQ,"I, too, have been using my VHS version of EXERCISE CAN BEAT ARTHRITIS and it keeps me moving. I have OsteoArthritis, Fibromyalgia and Crohn's Disease so finding an exercise tape that I can move to without pain isn't easy. This one fits the bill! I work at my own pace not some over anxious, 100 pound, skin and bone instructor who hasn't seen 21 yet. Yes, the British accent can get a bit annoying at times but after a while I just turn the volume off and put my own music on. I do that for any exercise tape I use and I keep my remote handy in case I mess up my routine and need the volume back.

There's nothing difficult about this DVD so if you're looking to be seriously challenged this one isn't for you. But for those who have painful joints, aching muscles or painful mid sections I highly recommend this DVD/VHS. Age makes no difference and you can hold back on days that movement is at it's worst for you. Just slow the pace down. I put my DVD on ""slow motion"". Works great on days when I can barely bend down to turn the machine on!",1161475200,8,1043,4.163366336633663
2325999,3,B0009VXMOQ,...you can stand the boring format and British accent of the woman speaking.  I found this product too annoying to be able to fully reap any benefits.,1158019200,2,150,4.555555555555555
2326000,4,B0009VXMOQ,"For several years I have been using the VHS form of this exercise program for arthritis sufferers. It works. It is a basically gentle, sit or stand set that is enjoyable to watch and do, and helps to loosen the arthritic areas and keep you more limber. I have been looking for a DVD version for some time

now here it is.",1133827200,8,321,4.17741935483871

8067725,5,B0009VXMOQ,I had a tape of this for several years and have exercised regularly.  The tape started to give trouble so I ordered the DVD to replace it.  Very good for people with arthritis.,1471478400,,176,4.303030303030303
8067726,5,B0009VXMOQ,Fun and helpful!,1454284800,,16,4.666666666666667
8067727,5,B0009VXMOQ,This is a fun video! Haven't tested my copy yet. But had used the library copy previously. Thanks a million!,1451174400,,108,4.45
8067728,4,B0009VXMOQ,Love this video. It is fun to exercise with.,1421020800,,44,4.0
8067729,5,B0009VXMOQ,"An exercise video I look forward to doing.  While it's a bit cheezy, and probably a bit out-dated, the demonstrators are just down to earth people like me, suffering with arthritis, like me, and making these simple exercises fun(ny)!  The music is fabulous and once you're familiar with the routine, you find yourself adding a few extra ""bounces"" to it to jive with the music.  I love it!",1369872000,,388,4.676470588235294
8067730,3,B0009VXMOQ,The cover was deceiving as many of the exercises were not on a chair and most of the participants were very able bodied and did not show signs of a disability from the joints.  we bought this to educate ourselves and to assist my mom on how to exercise after 35+ years of this autoimmune illness; but ended up fast forwarding many of the exercises or had to adapt it and slow the whole video down to keep up.  This is more for able-bodied and those who have not have the illness for long.,1361404800,2,488,4.180851063829787
8067731,4,B0009VXMOQ,"I like this dvd because it is helping me to be aware of how to use time throughout the day to stretch and do small exercises. Even though there is a lot of talking and not a lot of time to exercise, as the first reviewer states, it is still important to understand these basics before moving on. I am a medical professional but did not know how to take care of my own arthritis. I feel more motivated after seeing this video not to give up.",1336694400,2,440,4.068965517241379
8067732,4,B0009VXMOQ,This video is identical to the original tape version and provides an excellent exercise program for older people or sufferers from athritis.,1331769600,,140,5.409090909090909
8067733,2,B0009VXMOQ,"This DVD would be great if only they did more actual exercising and less explaining of why exercise is helpful for arthritis.  I bought this DVD to use for an exercise group I facilitate at work, but there is so much time devoted to explanations that most of the group participants were asleep before long, and couldn't benefit much from the limited physical activities it included.  These people are already sedentary, they do not need to listen to lengthy explanations, but to keep moving in order to stimulate their immunity and boost their metabolism.  This DVD misses that mark by miles!",1326412800,3,592,4.841584158415841
