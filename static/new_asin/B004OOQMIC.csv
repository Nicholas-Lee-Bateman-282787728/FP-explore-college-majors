4440751,5,B004OOQMIC,"A must see! This film elegantly explains why so many things don't seem to be right in the world today. Do we ever examine what we believe? Do we ever ask ourselves what money really is? The monetary system is not helping us in any way - it is hurting us in many ways. It's a modern day slavery. The whole global monetary system is a giant Ponzi scheme soon to collapse... but hey, don't believe me. Who am I to say this? Do your own research. There is plenty of evidence out there in the daylight, waiting for us to see. But we are so brainwashed with the way things are that we don't even see any signs or worse, we simply deny the parade of things-gone-wrong in the world today (the end of oil, environmental degradation, wars, to mention just a few). Do your research; this film is a good place to start. It will open your eyes to things most people are far from being aware of. Wake up - you are not a mindless consumer. You are not what you think you are; the world is not what you think it is; and certainly, the money is not what you were taught to believe it is. The change can only start in the heart - let it be your heart.

4440755,3,B004OOQMIC,"My gripe is that it was painfully long .
. I think 20-30 minutes would be adequate.
Case in point , I sent a short 1 minute clip of this from a YouTube video to a very liberal friend and was told it looked so boring it put her to sleep . She works in education btw.

My favorite part of the movie was when it questioned why we ponder and quarry over ""debt that does not exist ?""
""Are we f#+<n stupid?"" It asks
And then the closing scene where all the US appears to go on strike giving up all their money was a great illustration and was more thought provoking then the rest of the film put together .

As with any conspiracy type movies , all should be taken with a grain of salt . Always question everything and do your own research!

But after watching several republican conspiracy theories about impending communist take over , I thought it might be interesting to see a documentary from the leftist view point and this accomplished my goal .

My conclusion is that , not all communist governments are evil .

Cuba , for example is doing decently , not better or worse then America and over half , 53% of its population are Carholic meaning strong family values .
America with capitalism as well as socialist programs has good and bad like any other government system .
People will always compete even without money. Things like Natural Physical beauty or learned skills or fertility or health  or virtues such as patience do not always rely on money . These are gifts from God.
Money isn't the problem , greed is the problem.
I have seen many people using the U.S. Social systems to take ""free"" items that they do not need even need, due to greed.  People can be greedy without money .
You need God to avoid ""greed"" . Even In places like China where Christianity is scarce , God is still there . Everything good , comes from God.",1473724800,,1834,4.313953488372093

In fact, I am so educated as far as what society is blinded by I want to go and tell the world or as many people as possible to life the veils from your eyes and see what is actually happening around you.  Who your really working for, and where is the law that states anyone has to pay ANY FEDERAL TAXES?  There is not one that can be found anywhere, so why do we all continue to pay?  And why do we all accept the fact that all of the money circulating around is actually not real money?  How many people are even aware of these two facts?

4440799,1,B004OOQMIC,"If you already subscribe to the ideals that this movie promotes then this will be a good cheerleading session for you.

However, if you are a critical thinker you will probably be disappointed. The movie is slanted, it is not interested in  balanced descriptions of problems and solutions, it basically starts with an end in mind and ponderously works its way towards it. Along the way is a role call of the usual suspects who have caused this mess but whom seem to mostly be those on one side of the political, ideological spectrum which is somewhat suspicious but is at least consistent with this kind of demagoguery.  (Meet the new boss, same as the old boss plays as I write this) The conclusion (spoiler alert!!!) that science is what we should be using, as politics and religion have nothing meaningful to add here, to direct our lives has its own special irony as science is empirical and material and generally does not do well with things like the spirit (Zeitgeist?). Oh, and for all the conspiracy inclined, the solution also seems to be a World Resource Authority that will coordinate everything, remove the concept of property (or at least private property), create one civilization, and all use would be based on need not merit. People of only the correct political orientation need apply except it won't be called political orientation once everyone who was wrong is gone.

I think that you either have to be a believer to appreciate this or at least have a low level of skepticism in order to enjoy this kind of movie/book/sermon. As I am not the former and have a lot of the latter, I see it a mostly a waste of my time. It quickly lost its humor and its obvious attempts at manipulation are examples of insipid propaganda bordering on indoctrination. Not to say that I didn't agree with some points but that the bobble-headed pronouncements of 'obvious' truths belong in a good comedy, not a movie that takes itself seriously or that I am supposed to take seriously.  If I were 15 again I would probably like this a lot more. But then again, when I was 15 we were reading 1984, Animal Farm, Lord of the Flies, and Walden Two so your results may vary, mine taught me be suspicious of people who want to run the world.",1396224000,7,2234,4.5889724310776945

4440805,4,B004OOQMIC,"I've watched all zeitgeist films, I think part one of the first movie defiantly crosses the line with a lot of religious people. people fear death the last thing they want to hear is there view of an afterlife and a lifetime of devotion proven false. People who believe in only one way of life as the way it should be, are generally really ignorant and in denial of any true information. tried showing the film to some Catholics they looked twisted in the first part and couldn't sit through the rest.

Some people just aren't ready to wake up.
We have to acknowledge the fact that our grandparents were brainwashed into thinking this is how its just done, because ever since i was a child long before zeitgeist ever came out i kept asking the same questions what happens when we die? Why do we need money? the response was the same, you go to heaven. you need money for all things in life, your birth cost someone even your own death needs to be covered financially.

the end point is not an answer for everyone, people can argue about it being a Utopian goal because it is but there's no reason to look down or doubt the plan, because starting on a new system is better than remaining insane.

Imagine drugs are worthless, kidnapping wouldn't profit, prostitution wouldn't be worth it. The stress of paying bills non existent, no more mandatory minimum sentencing in our prison systems because it wouldn't profit. and the ability to be with loved ones instead of work or in traffic. the point of this is so we as humans can live free.

4440806,2,B004OOQMIC,"I was told about the first Zeitgeist movie because a friend thought I would like it.  I love the conspiracy theory stuff, but also know to take most of it with a grain of salt.  I loved the first movie, so decided to have a Zeitgeist marathon.  The second was good and introduced us to The Venus Project.....the supposed answer to all that is wrong with the world.  Ok, I'll bite. After all, money is the root to all evil, that's been the theme, right?

This movie continues with the failings of the monetary system and professors discussing the way our environment shapes us.  I can agree with most of that.  But then it goes to this futuristic resourced based economy, The Venus Project, as the solution to the problems we're currently facing that our monetary system has corrupted.  Supposedly, everyone's equal here.  No one owns anything.  Items are checked out of a distribution center much like a library.  As I was listening to this I heard a few things that made me say ""hey, wait a minute"".  A super computer will be the decision maker.  It will analyze, compute and ration based on needs, keeping the primary objective the sustainability of the resources.  Huh?  Not the people?  Didn't I see this somewhere before......like the movie i Robot, Gattaca or The Island....or read about the rationing of food somewhere in a history textbook.  That didn't work out so well.  All of the technology in the world can't prevent natural disasters from occurring that could put access to these resources in jeopardy.

Ok, I thought.......surely there wasn't enough time to go through the details of this society in an almost 3 hour documentary, and I'm just nit picking.  I went to The Venus Project's website.  On the home page you can buy the complete ""Venus Project Library Set"" for just $332 & if you missed their Kickstarter campaign......which they did meet their goal, you can still donate.......that ""evil"" dollar!  Of course, their argument is, we're still in a monetary economy.  If you really want to test this resourced based economy out, why wouldn't you just ask for volunteers or tangible item donations?  I then went to the F.A.Q. page.  WHOA!  There are over 100.  A few touched on my questions, but the answers completely glossed over and were very poorly executed.  Concerning actually.  I get it, you're going to re-educate everyone (brain wash) and eventually we'll all be this happy go lucky society where everyone loves each other.  Humans are emotional beings.  It's not going to happen.  I looked at their response to crimes of jealousy.  While I agree, you can get rid of certain behaviors, emotions will always complicate this.  To sum up their response,  ""people aren't possessions & you are free to be with whoever you want"".....didn't the hippies already try that?  & I'm sorry, but if some Woody Allen type tried to take my 11 year old daughter out because a computer analyzed her and said she's ready, I'd be the first one to end up in the detention center for gouging his eyes out with my checked out fork!

Apparently Peter Joseph and The Venus Project have since parted ways.  So much for the cooperative society where everyone's equal and encouraged to share idea's.......provided they align with Jacque & Roxanne's.  Now, I'm off to read Red Mars of the Mars trilogy.",1392249600,3,3304,4.790780141843972

4440812,3,B004OOQMIC,"I loved the first half of this program, and agree with the problems caused by a few people controlling the rest of us through graft and manipulation. However, the last half is filled with crap.
The 'solutions' offered is more CONTROL. More 'you only have what you need, and you get it from our system of resource, production, and supply.' Communism taken to the extreme.
Take transportation as an example. We only use a car for some 45 minutes a day he claims, so their answer is that we don't need to 'own' a car, only 'rent' one when we need it and return it when we don't - like a library book he says. How do we get home after returning it to the 'car library'? What if you live in the country, like I do? Do I walk the twenty miles? Fly? Get a ride? If I get a ride, what does the person do when they drop me off? Do they beg a ride from someone else who has to return their car to the 'car library'?
Who puts gas in the tank? Who does the oil changes? The tire rotation? Fills the washer fluid? The people at the 'car library'?
What about holidays? Will there be enough cars at the 'car library' for everyone who's going to see family? If so, what about the waste of all those cars sitting all year long? Isn't that horribly wasteful?
That's just cars. They want us to 'borrow' everything! Video cameras, computers, clothes, dishes, everything. Use it for the few minutes or hours we actually use it, then return it to the 'clothes library' or the 'dishes library'. How do we return all these things? Go to the 'car library' and 'borrow' a car, return everything to their 'libraries,' then return the car? How wasteful! Think of all the usage on the cars from the 'car library' and all that gas to go borrow everything we need or want to use everyday and then return it when we're done using it! Insanity!
Pathetic. And it's all run by whom? Who decides if my need for a car to get to work at the same time every day is important enough that there will be one available for me every day? Or to go borrow everything else I want to use every day. Or do I have to give up my 'unsustainable' lifestyle in the country and move to a city with everyone else? No farms then. How are we going to grow crops? On rooftops? Or just eat Soylent Green on Mondays and Soylent Yellow on Tuesdays and so on?
The entire last half of this thing had me laughing! It was like some crazy redux of a Russian propaganda film from the fifties or China in the seventies! Impossible answers to simple problems.

4440827,1,B004OOQMIC,"This movie had some interesting commentary on some deeply rooted problems in society.  I found Dr. Gabor Mate particularly interesting, and his insights are valid despite the failure of the rest of the movie.

Unfortunately, the incredibly disapointing conclusion of this movie is that we will just let magic supercumputers optimize all of our resource extraction, distribution, and consumption.  It's similar to the old joke of an economist stuck on a desert island trying to open a can of food.  His solution; first assume a can opener.

Finally, this movie contains exceptionally benign footage (pathetic cartoons, a jungle pond filled with oil, etc.) until you get to the part where they show A DOG BEING SKINNED ALIVE.  The casual association of this horrific and barbaric act with the other G-rated scenes, implies to me that Peter Josepeph has no sense of empathy torwards animals.

4440829,2,B004OOQMIC,"Other reviewers have summarized this so I am just going to get to the meat of my review. This documentary has some merit. The discussion of the economy and the artificial injection of capital into it in the form of extra money printing is certainly an issue. The fact that the economy is no longer based on gold but effectively a created system with no backing is indeed a problem. Healthcare, resources, etc are of course, all issues.

The problem. Not one part of this documentary shows a complete story. It is heavily skewed. For instance, the ""charts"" about how much better things are in societies that are ""more equal"" are highly limited in their considerations. A lot of variables go into determining the overall health, crime rate, etc with a society. Simple ""equality"" does not do it. Also, indicating that simply being poor is a cause of bad health and short life spans and that it isn't a choice is absurd. There have been numerous people born into lower class or high crime areas that manage to build themselves up to health, long life, and success and they are able to guide others to do the same. Drug abuse and alcohol abuse are choices. The creators blame these on soci-economic status and though lower status does increase the chances someone will turn to unhealthy habits, the fact is, they are still choices and plenty have chosen not to travel that road, and still others who have traveled that road, get off of it and make something of themselves.

There are a lot of issues in this world, and some of them are indeed touched on here. If you are interested in nothing more than something that will confirm your already existing beliefs, you will probably like this. If you wish to actually have a holistic view of how the various aspects mentioned in this video actually work so you can form your own opinion and think for yourself, look elsewhere.",1362614400,2,1868,4.640483383685801

4440835,2,B004OOQMIC,"""Zeitgeist: Moving Forward"" is the last part of the trilogy that gave us the Zeitgeist Movement. I admit that I didn't bother watching all of it, nor shall I do so in the future. It seems to be a rehash of the ideas in ""Zeitgeist: Addendum"", the main difference being that director Peter Joseph has added interviews with a number of scholars to give his little movement more clout.

If anything, ""Moving Forward"" sounds even more absurd than ""Addendum"". The film advocates a world-wide planned economy, but without mentioning that tainted term. Instead it uses the flashier monikers Global Resource Management System, Global Production Management System and Demand & Distribution Tracking System, all part of a Resource-Based Economy defined as ""the scientific method applied to social concern"". The planned economy controls everything through computers, which work independently of humans. Science and technology are unbiased, neutral and objective. ""There is no Democratic or Republican way to build an airplane"". Therefore, a strictly scientific economy will truly solve our problems and take care of all our needs.

Apparently, all (!) private ownership should be abolished as well. Everything you need can be borrowed gratis from local ""access centres"". Production is based on an assessment of human needs, including the need for leisure, recreation and music. It's not clear how these needs can be assessed or quantified by computers, but we are assured that they will. Strangely, there will be abundance despite the fact that the planned economy will be strictly sustainable and in harmony with Nature.

Our old friend Jacque Fresco is featured again. He is virtually unknown, but presented as an important inventor, political thinker and social critic. According to Wiki, Fresco used to be both a Communist and a Technocrat before striking out on his own. Indeed, the Technocrats seemed to have had some ideas similar to those of the Zeitgeist group.

As usual, we are not told *how* the brave new world should be brought about. What groups, strata or classes in society have an objective material interest in creating an international planned economy? Who could carry out such a program? How? Using what strategy? Presumably, scientists, engineers and technocrats are the vanguard of the future. But then what? Why should scientists support Joseph or Fresco?

I'm not against sustainability or even state intervention in the economy, but please, this is demented. I'm not against technology either but, once again, the over-reliance on technological solutions in ""Moving Forward"" sounds almost like a parody. A parody of Murray Bookchin or Sam Dolgoff, perhaps?

The Zeitgeist Movement is something as peculiar as a utopian socialist sect based largely in cyberspace.

4440836,5,B004OOQMIC,"This documentary will tell you.  I have watched many documentaries in my life, but never have I come across one so insightful about the causes of our collective, societal ills until I watched Zeitgeist: Moving Forward.  My husband recommended this film after viewing ""Zeitgeist The Movie"" (2007).

I've read the negative reviews of this documentary and the only thing I can think of is that it went completely over their heads.  How any reasonably intelligent person watching this film failed to connect the dots (which one should be able to do without watching ""Zeitgeist:  Moving Forward"" by just paying attention to world history and what is happening right under our noses) is beyond me.  Sadly, though the film lays out ""our problems"" clearly, people never change until things get so bad that they have to change - such is the human condition.  I guess the question is how badly do things have to get?

Not enough stars in the sky to rate this.  It's a must see and definitely something to reflect on... maybe a few who have blinders on will take them off after viewing.

4440837,4,B004OOQMIC,"Like the first Zeitgeist, this is eye-opening (if you have that capability). The analysis of economics and ""supply side"" magic-of-the-market crap is worth the price of admission. The product-vs-money economy makes perfect sustainable sense. The problem is that the situation isn't dire enough for significant numbers of citizens to want a change. Humans are irrationally optimistic and will not change until forced to, which hasn't happened yet.

The upside is that a tiny number of humans are realistic and spend useful time evaluating what options may exist if the current system crashes. They are the only hope humans have for long term survival. When the oil resources ""suddenly"" vanish, human population will head back down toward the sustainable 200M world population number and if these folks are among who is left, humanity might have a future.",1356307200,,852,5.264705882352941
4440838,4,B004OOQMIC,"Oliver Stone's movie ""JFK"", as much as I like it, is barely a movie in that it is a barrage of information. If you blink you miss something. There is no real breathing room. It's very much like this documentary.

Here's the scoop. Zeitgeist: Moving Forward propounds that the angst, horror and overall crumbling we are experiencing around the world in general, and in the United States in particular, is due to the world economic system. Writer/director Peter Joseph systematically outlines how things work and how they are doomed, by nature, to finally fail. He then goes on to outline a new system whereby not only can the world sustain itself, but crime, poverty and many other of the ills we are experiencing will be reduced to the bare minimum.

I am not  going to tell you I am smart enough to have absorbed everything thrown at me here. At two hours twenty this is jam packed with enough information to keep the average viewer busy for months. Joseph has a cadre of (for my dollar) brilliant talking heads on display addressing parts of the equation in line with their particular discipline. The first part deals with socially related items such as mass and serial killers and how they are a product of a fiercely stratified society. The second half outlines how the global economic society is set up and how, finally, it must crumble because of things like planned obsolescence and finite resources. He then shifts gears and outlines a plan to make a u-turn and get things on a track that will divert disaster.

What Peter Joseph envisions is noble no doubt, but I have to wonder if it could work. It's not the plan I doubt, it's whether or not the planet could shift its paradigm. I don't see the powers that be doing anything other than what they have been doing no matter what the cost to the rest of us. They aren't going to let go. And what of us? We are inundated day in and day out to want more and see things a certain way. It's who we are. How do we change who we are? According to Joseph, there isn't much time left and what he's asking seems as though it would take a long time. We are talking about restructuring society.

This is generally well made. I took exception to some of the unfairly heavy handed images that accompanied the script. And the end was cheesy and unrealistic. This needs to be seen by everyone, including the powers that be. I don't know that these changes can be made, but I can hope.",1356307200,5,2427,4.481900452488688
4440839,3,B004OOQMIC,"This installment of Zeitgeist seemed to be pushing some type of anti-capitalist message and there were some sections which I vehemently disagreed with.  The section on ""pscyo-social inequality"" and how he adamantly says that the root cause of poor health amongst the impoverished is ""stress"" induced by societal inequality is complete and utter BS.  This assertion has a liberal ""spread-the wealth"" undertone to it.  The poor and uneducated are in poor health for a myriad of reasons.  Among them are lack of access to healthy food, poor education on ""what's bad for them"", and the most important reason is that THEY'RE LAZY!!!! Our welfare state has also created lazy, apathetic people who in turn produce lazy apathetic children. It's not stress of inequality, but rather it's self-induced inequality!  I've only touched the tip of the iceberg, but he left out a myriad of sociological factors on social inequality and blamed nothing but our flawed monetary system and market economy.  Again, I'm not sure what political agenda he's pushing here.  Other than that, this was a decent ""sequel"" to the first film which I liked very much.

4440843,3,B004OOQMIC,"As a huge fan of the original Zeitgeist (I watch it every 4-6 months), I sat down last night to watch Zeitgeist: Moving Forward with great anticipation for three hours of cerebral massage.  Well, I got my wish---in a painfully slow, ponderous way.  The format was a back-and-forth montage of videotaped academics lecturing on neurobiology.  The lecturers laid the foundation for the connection between societal violence and poverty (poverty of both economic opportunity and of social needs). I doubt this discussion will offer much revelation to the majority of knowledgeable viewers. I kept asking myself, ""Where is this film going?""

The answer lies in the final hour (if you can hang in there that long)---where The Earth Project and a future cashless society is described in utopian details.  Lovely ideas.  A cool description of self-sustaining, futuristic concentric city design. A vision of world citizens on every continent dumping their fiat cash in the streets as a sign of independence from the international monetary cartels. [The visual image portrayed in the movie reminded me of Mario Savio's 1964 ode to civil disobedience, ""There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart that you can't take part!  You can't even passively take part!  And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus---and you've got to make it stop!  And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it---that unless you're free the machine will be prevented from working at all!!!""]

Sadly, this film does not provide insight into effective civil resistance to our unsustainable socio-political morass. It is a journey of disjointed information that leaves the viewer lost in the 'fog of rhetoric'.  Bummer.",1344038400,13,1828,5.06
4440844,1,B004OOQMIC,"I found two things quite ironic about this movie:  1) I had to pay for it.  Odd, coming from a project which spends over two hours examining the supposed evils of money.  And 2) Every single screen shot showing what their post money paradise would look like was tattooed with Jacque Fresco's name in the lower left corner.  Again, odd coming from a project which postulates that if we could just burn all our money and reset society, we would this time be successful in building one in which everyone was equal without monkey wrenches such as desire for personal attention causing competition to tear said society apart.

This project could be best described as societal science fiction.  In the best tradition of science fiction, it relies on ""unobtainium"" in order to slip past the actual thorny spots. Science fiction writers are famous for this.  If the problem with generating self-sustaining fusion is our inability to keep a massive explosion bottled up, science fiction writers simply imagine this problem away with ""dilithium magnets"" or ""quantum crystaline anthrocarbenzotrine.""  (Ok, yes, I made that up.  But, science fiction can't function without access to unlimited amounts of unimaginable power, so let's just quickly slide past the hard part, which is that such a power source is probably not available given the limitations of reality, because once we have imagined our way past it with a simple wave of our magic imaginary science, then we can just have a lot of fun dreaming of all the things we can do once that power is at our fingertips.)

At the heart of this movie is a conundrum, which is that it is a project supposedly aimed at the heart of the concept of money, but the people doing the aiming didn't think deeply enough about it to actually be able to recognize what money is.  Oh, they throw in a bunch of names of various (and diametrically opposed, I might add) historical economists as well as a momentary clip from Milton Friedman in order to name drop and therefore make it sound like they somehow have a deeper understanding of this complex topic then those dead guys who were clearly just shills for some more sinister and shadowy power, but the ironic thing is that the system they propose would not get rid of money.  At all.

Consider.  Money is not paper bills, or metallic coins, or electronic bits, or debt, or IOUs written on cocktail napkins.  It is not cowrie shells or wampum or cows.  Instead, money is simply 3 things: 1) a medium of exchange, 2) unit of account, and 3) store of value.  These functions are not necessary in a society which is not tied to the limitations of physical reality.  However, they are mandatory to any system which is attempting to coordinate the allocation of resources which exist in limited supply.  Simply burning up paper money does not eliminate the societal requirement for the function of money.  The job that money does (when it is limited to real money rather than the fraudulent expansion of fractional reserve fiat currency) is to coordinate the allocation of scarce resources, which means that money ties your efforts and decision making processes to the resources actually available to you in reality, rather than resources imagined up in some committee. Thus an economy steered by the price signals of money (again, real money, not fiat or credit money) is the real resource based economy.

When you attempt to eliminate this coordinating function you essentially blind yourself to what money is telling you about the actual state of supply versus needs in a society.  The result of this is that your efforts steadily move further and further away from the things which society actually wants and has available, which really means that your economy gets steadily less and less effective at meeting the needs of society, until it finally freezes up from its own designed in inefficiency, at which point it collapses.  This is why all communist countries have had to re-institute free market reforms, because the central command economy attempts to function without any signals to keep it aligned to reality and all command economies reliably stall their economic engines.  But, of course, this project postulates a ""super computer"" which is magically able to do what China and the Soviet Union were not capable of, so I guess that won't be a problem for these guys.  Sniff, sniff.  You smell unobtainium too?

I thought the best metaphor that this movie provided was their idea that all food should be grown via hydroponics, which will of course eliminate disease and shower abundance upon all.  They don't understand that soil is a community, its own actual ecology, in which fungi make macro and micro nutrients available to plants in exchange for drops of sugar from plant roots, each species pursuing its own self interest and finding that cooperation furthers this self interest more than isolation.  They miss that the messiness and competition in soil, the predation and the symbiosis, the constant struggle to survive, is what makes soil resilient and adaptable.  This analogy is perfect, because what this project wants to do with humans is to grow them hydroponically as well.  Separate them from all the messy human things like competition, envy, jealousy,and differences in ability and appearance which always lead to a stratified and competitive human society, and instead feed them a diet of purified and isolated positive reinforcement and good role models, because then we can finally have a society free of viruses and pathogens.

The unfortunate part is that much of what this project touches on is real.  Peak oil is happening, and EROEI is not just a concept.  America is running out of cheap energy at about the same time it uses up all the brand name good will resident in our reserve currency dollar, and these two pillars are what our complex and multilayered society is built upon.  We desperately need cogent and thoughtful discourse on exactly how our society can destratify our complex society down to a more simple one capable of existing on less energy without going through political collapse at the same time.  But, this movie is not it.",1341878400,22,6160,4.895091434071222
4440845,5,B004OOQMIC,"This is without a doubt the most influential collection of information I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. Watching this film will forever change how you look at the world, and what you think of our current ""modern"" society.

If you've ever felt that something was wrong, if you've ever looked around at all the inequality, poverty, crime, corruption, violence, misery, and environmental destruction without being able to place where it is all coming from, then this is the film you've been waiting for. Prepare to leave the Matrix behind.

Most of us can sense that something is terribly wrong with our world. We all need the same things; healthy food, water, clean air, shelter, love, education, health care, energy, and transportation, so why is it that so many people cannot access these basic things? The answer, as explored in Zeitgeist: Moving Forward, is that the very structure of economic and political systems make achieving these fundamental human needs impossible.

If this is the case, then how should we structure society to meet these goals for every human being, while maintaining the ecological balance required to continue living on the planet? The answer to this question is the highlight of the film, and underscores our immense possibilities to elevate every human being to a higher quality of life than even the richest of today.

To make this world a better place for ourselves, and put a stop with our collision course with nature, this film and others like it should be seen by everyone. We can create a beautiful society that improves life for every living being on Earth, its only a choice between fear and love.",1340928000,4,1647,4.913669064748201

4440857,5,B004OOQMIC,"The three films comprising the Zeitgeist series by Peter Joseph are extraordinary in their dissection of the modern world as a collective myth whose core is money.  Money, in this paradigm, isn't simply ""the root of all evil': it's the root of the world's entire social fabric.  Peter Joseph reduces money to its lowest common denominator: debt.  According to Joseph, money equals debt in a purely one-to-one relationship; and exists for no other reason than to accrue debt.  Since money is the core of the modern world, and money equals debt, it follows that debt is likewise the core of every modern society.  This world created by money - out of thin air, as Joseph contends - can exist only if the people of the world accept debt as their one and only way of life - their very reason for being; and, as a corollary, scarcity as their inevitable plight.  And once they've accepted debt as their rightful due, they must do one thing and one thing only: submit their labor in exchange for wages.  So far so good; but then the reasoning begins to get a little fuzzy.

A Utopian world is envisioned by Joseph and the creators of something called The Venus Project - a Utopia unlike anything ever conceived - although he insists there is nothing Utopian about their vision.  This new world would be built entirely on two pillars.  First, people must change their way of thinking, their way of seeing themselves vis-a-vis the world and others, and, accordingly, their way of behaving.  The assumption is made that this feat - greater than any feat humanity has ever undertaken - is within the realm of human possibility.  The second pillar upon which this world would stand is Technology.  Joseph contends that Technology offers the possibility of forever eradicating virtually all of the ills which currently keep three quarters of the earth's population in a state of abject misery.

Though I don't consider myself trapped in the ""old"" way of thinking or looking at the world, I do nevertheless have serious reservations about the feasibility of achieving such an unbridled state of benevolence and prosperity - not because of the understandable resistance of the current social paradigm to any change and especially a change of such sweeping magnitude; but because of the two cornerstones of this bold new world.  For one thing, technology has always proven itself a double-edged sword.  You can argue that's because technology has always fallen prisoner to those whose only concern is the preservation of the moneyed world; but since technology has always been used to maintain the status quo, the theory Peter Joseph puts forth has never been tested.  We simply don't know if technology really does lend itself to working harmoniously with the natural world - or if, by its very nature, it can only exploit the world's resources; nor, for that matter, do we know if any manner of technology can safeguard human societies from the inevitable ravages of nature.  For another thing, the ""nature versus nurture"" controversy has never been satisfactorily resolved - notwithstanding the assertion of some of the experts interviewed that the concept itself is bogus.  Joseph contends that once the myth born of money ceases to influence people's thinking and behavior, they will cease acting negatively toward one another and toward the earth; because, once all their needs are met, they would have no reason to continue their negative behavior - a contention almost impossible to prove or disprove.  I essentially agree with Peter Joseph that The Law, as it was conceived and as we know it, functions almost entirely to preserve the status quo - most especially, property rights - and, consequently, does almost nothing to make life better for the great mass of people; but I cannot agree with his rendering of humans as being conditioned solely by their society.  Reason dictates that it's as likely to be the other way around: that the kind of society humans repeatedly find themselves in may be the product of universal human traits and not merely the sinister machinations of first a priestly then a knightly and finally a mercantile caste bent upon exploiting their fellow man, as Joseph contends.

Almost every rendering of pre-history pre-supposes that the earliest humans would have gravitated toward the concept of the supernatural in their attempts to make sense of their world - and that's why they fell victim to all manner of creation myths.  But there would have been nothing in their experience to suggest magical beings as the cause of natural phenomena.  They could see lightening, they could hear thunder, they could feel wind; just because these things posed a threat does not mean the earliest humans would have concluded gods to have been the cause.  So while I readily accept Joseph's implication that the creation myths were foisted on the mass of people by a priestly caste, I think we have to look deeper to discover why these myths took hold of people's minds as they did.  People didn't - and still don't - need creation myths to make sense of their world or to render their world more manageable.  It had to have been something other than fear of the unknown to prompt people to abandon their common sense explanations of natural phenomena and take on a mythology completely alien to their experience of their world.  Best guess is that they found something in the myths they could use to their advantage - and why not?  There's nothing to indicate that people were ever disposed to look favorably upon others outside their immediate tribal setting, even if ""Zeitgeist"" does postulate that that's exactly how people would have lived prior to the creation of money.

Ironically, Peter Joseph comes very close to creating his own mythology when he blindly accepts that, given the optimal circumstances, people would gladly, even eagerly, accept others as fellow travelers on a journey of discovery; and would willingly share all the wonders and resources they find on their journey.  I sincerely hope he's right; but I fear he's wrong.  People gravitate too easily toward the more selfish modes of social interaction to ever imagine that they would willingly abandon their present way of life for one more altruistic; there's very little in human history to suggest that a majority of people would even wish to live in the kind of world Joseph envisions.  Then there's one final aspect of this entire Venus Project that's more than just a little troubling: who would coordinate everything necessary to make this new society work?  Joseph implies it would be the task of scientists; but given their penchant for playing ""God,"" can scientists be trusted to work entirely for the benefit of humanity?  Have scientists used their understanding of natural laws to create a staggering array of destructive devices entirely because they came under the domination of moneyed interests?  Or have they been a bit too eager to create anything, regardless how devastating it is, simply because they can?  This is clearly yet another unknown variable; and because it remains unknown, it would be foolhardy to blindly turn the world over to the scientists to run.",1302652800,5,7171,4.945833333333334

Hence we turn the robots into slaves and make em work their buts off for us 24 hours a day. A side effect is we end up paying for nothing! We 'mechanize' the parts of society we really don't want to do and free more of our time for the things that we do want to do, like hanging out at the beach or building a new super computer. All using great scientific and technologically advanced methods which currently aren't accessible to the general population of the world due to corporations owning copyrights and patents and all that ownership nonsense!
