2831372,4,B000Q66ISG,This has not enough info about sea power.  It does tell you a little about each subject.  Each esposide is only 30 minutes long.  They mainly only concertate on the British Navy.  They only look mainly outside when it came to talk about the Aircraft carrier in which they took the whole esposide about the US navy.  That is because we are the super power and the only ones with super carriers.,1272672000,,393,4.402777777777778

Whats worse this ""documentary"" apparently did no fact checking, in the first episode on submarines they say the U.S. Ohio class ballistic nuclear submarine was the submarine featured in the movie The Hunt for Red October.  This is patently incorrect, the submarines featured in the movie are primarily the USSR's  (""Shark"") (NATO reporting name: Typhoon) and the US's 688 Los Angeles class with the USSR's Shchuka (NATO reporting name ""Akula"") making a lesser appearance.

2831683,2,B000Q66ISG,"This could have been sooo.. much better!

I agree with other reviewers that while having an Australian perspective was interesting the numerous and blaring errors were just too much.  An example was the section on destroyers.  If the opening monolog had referenced WW ONE then it would have been correct but it referenced WWII; since the RN ASDIC had been developed in the interwar period the RN figured that they could detect and sink U-boots with easy - not correct.  The use of SURFACE ATTACK by German U-boots negated the ASDIC and it was not until the collaborative development and production of SONAR with RADAR plots (using the PPI screens) that the U-boots tactics became suicidal.

There were many other errors of similar nature scattered through out.  The section on the Harrier did not differentiate between the AV8-A (original British version) which made the pilot handle multiple tasks manually and the AV8-B (Americanized version) which automated many of the tasks for hovering.

Their was no mention of the disasterous political decision for the RN and subsequently the RAN to abandon large deck carriers (flying conventional aircraft) nor that the RN had any available carriers only because two carriers which were to be sold to India were available for conscription.  The loss of the container ship Atlantic Conveyor was a major blow because it contained the experimental USN flight deck kit which would have given the RN much more deck space for Harriers.",1454198400,,1473,5.0578512396694215
2831684,5,B000Q66ISG,"The Sea Power documentary series is great, they have tailored it so that the most novice civilian can understand military technology, they blend technology information with historical data.

2831747,2,B000Q66ISG,"I watched one episode featuring the Australian Navy. I was looking forward to seeing authentic imagery and learning facts I hadn't known before, but was disappointed. The part where they really lost me was when they started talking about the A-4, but were clearly showing video of the British Aerospace (BAE) Systems Hawke.

Then they showed some old footage of American A-4's and talked about how modern and capable the A-4 was before going on to say it had been retired from service years ago, replaced by the F/A-18 Hornet.

Overall the quality and substance of the documentary felt very low and was closer to something you'd expect from the news media rather than a full-fledged documentary.

I thoroughly enjoy military documentaries and always love to watch just to see if I can find some video or learn a piece of information I've never come across before. Even though this documentary was disappointing, there were a few good bits showing the Royal Australian Navy and New Zealand Navy underway. It's very interesting to see how crews from different nations interact and work together. It was also interesting seeing some footage of Australian submarines underway.

Overall, I don't think I'll watch many of the other videos in the series though as this one was just a little too boring.

Too bad, though I am thankful to anyone who endeavors to create documentaries on militaries as it feels like most of the content out there has been recycled over and over throughout the years. Nice to see new stuff from time to time.",1453075200,,1530,4.846743295019157
2831748,1,B000Q66ISG,"I struggled through the first episode--Submarines--even though I was ready to quit after ten minutes.  Many errors and omissions.  Time on irrelevancies.  ""Sea Power"" with a major portion dedicated to the towing and setup as a museum an obsolete (actually as of the day it was launched!) British submarine in Australia.  Was this an Australian production?  If so, does this demonstrate what the Aussies knew about what happened in WWII submarine warfare?  Much coverage of the German U-Boat war (that failed) and no coverage of the U.S. submarine war--that succeeded--in the Pacific, where with only 2% of the USN's men and materiel, the submarine force sunk the equivalent of 90% of Japan's merchant fleet and one third of the Imperial Navy.

Actually, the narrator lost me about five minutes in when showing and talking about the Ohio class ballistic missile sub and explaining that it was featured in the novel and movie (actually I think he only mentioned the movie...maybe wasn't aware of the novel?) ""The Hunt for Red October"".  In fact, the U.S. sub in the movie was the Dallas, a Los Angeles class ATTACK submarine.  I suffered to the end of the episode hoping it would get better.
