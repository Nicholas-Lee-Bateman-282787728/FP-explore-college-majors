8049844,1,B0007P0XRI,"This is quite possibly the worst childrens' DVD I have ever seen.  The visuals are awful, the singing is out-of-key, and there are no lyrics on-screen so that your children can follow along.  My two-year old looked at me during the third song and said ""No like it.""  Thank goodness this was a garage-sale gift from my mother.  Please, for the love of all that is holy, do not waste your money on any of this company's products.",1340409600,,427,4.435897435897436
8049845,1,B0007P0XRI,"it's pointless! it's like one of those el cheapo, really badly made home video that noone wants to watch! notice i wrote video because the only redeeming value are the music tracks. if this was produced as a CD, it would have been useful.",1276646400,,238,4.431818181818182
8049846,5,B0007P0XRI,"The other reviews are correct! This GHETTO budget daycare project is a hodgepodge of home video sub-VHS quality home video. The kids don't sing, they walk, run, wear heavy face-paint.

The DVD is full of rough cuts to random things, like a homeless man chasing a preteen girl in a park with a broken umbrella. Throughout the DVD, there is a thicker Mexican girl strolling around in a poofy pink dress. During the London Bridge song, they show a still of London Bridge, and show the same Mexican girl crossing a small wooden bridge in a park, to trick us into thinking it's the same bridge....

Whoever threw this together used the kids in their daycare to hop around on videotape, and made some scratch off of it.

Add your favorite mind-altering substance, and put it on after the kids are asleep. You will laugh your [..] off.

My 8-month-old baby liked it though...",1248566400,,868,4.616883116883117
8049847,1,B0007P0XRI,"This is NOT an entertaining or educational alternative to TV.  You could not ""sing-a-long"" because there aren't any lyrics at the bottom of the screen.  This is a boring collection of home videos with annoying music added.  The children in the video look like they would rather be doing something else (one is sleeping on the couch).  The video has strange and random characters like a lady with a neon pink dress who dances and blows kisses and two unknown costumed characters who ride a golf cart and chase kids. One of the adults looks like she just got out bed to relunctantly play pat-a-cake.  The video looks like it was put together with a minimum amount of thought, effort, and money.",1206489600,,692,4.639344262295082
8049848,1,B0007P0XRI,"This DVD was the WORLDS WORST EXCUSE FOR A DVD, OR for any form of entertainment!  This was a very VERY poor home video at best. Going down from there is it had nothing to do with singing along, the children on the cover were never there...oh, it was awful!  Children sleeping on beds, oh...walking....actually, its not worth repeating and DEFINITELY not worth a penny, let alone the dollars I totally, completely wasted!  I'll never buy anything from that company again, that's for sure!",1203292800,,488,4.785714285714286
8049849,1,B0007P0XRI,Where do I start?  This was the worst video EVER!!!  The kids on the cover are nowhere to be found in the video.  At first I thought there was some sort of mistake with the video editing.  There were some kids at the beginning flashing what appeared to be gang signs with their hands.  We were stunned at the content (or lack thereof).  I think the only positive reviews you'll find for this video probably came from someone who has a vested interest in it selling.....This one went straight into the trash.,1193529600,,507,4.456521739130435
