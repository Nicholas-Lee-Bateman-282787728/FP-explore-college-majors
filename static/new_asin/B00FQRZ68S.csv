6020397,5,B00FQRZ68S,Brilliantly crafted documentary. Goes far beneath the surface of Steve Rude's life and the twists and turns of his professional career and the toll it takes on his family life. Look forward to seeing more work from Ian Fischer. He's a producer and director to watch.,1413331200,,266,4.804347826086956
6020398,4,B00FQRZ68S,"It's inexplicable to me that one of the greatest comic illustrators of all time would have economic problems. Rude will always be one of my greatest heroes. This film is showing his long unseen human side and the flip side to artistic greatness, that is the price that has to be paid.
Steve's work is for the contemplative and thoughtful viewer, maybe not for the typical comic buyer. Each page has more thought per square inch (TPI) than any other artists I know of, and you will be rewarded for extra time spent in analysis.
His work on Nexus has always been superb, but he has faltered just slightly of late on other titles, and at that pivotal moment when he needed to reach a new audience. I was telling a younger comic lover of Rude's greatness, and he said ""Oh I think I've got his Captain America."" Clearly he didn't get it. I would have them look at Alien Justice, Nexus the Origin or some earlier Nexus comics. Maybe Rude never had the same love for other titles that he had for Nexus. Still trying to figure it out.
I do believe that Nexus can still catch on. I would pitch the idea to the same people who made the Hellboy movies. I would like to see Baron and Rude oversee a larger publishing venture promoting the characters from Nexus with some new artists. Why not be the Lee and Kirby of a new era, and getting back to what made comics great in the first place?",1445904000,,1377,4.341085271317829

6020401,5,B00FQRZ68S,"Steve Rude was my favorite comic book artist in the 1980s, and consequently Nexus was my favorite book. It was very interesting to see and hear his story. The film makers spent a lot of time with him, as well as family, friends, and fellow artists. You get a good view of his history from childhood to his years as an independent comic artist. His early successes were later overshadowed by his time working for the big dogs, DC and Marvel.

Suffering from mental illness he began to miss deadlines and gained the title of ""difficult to work with"" in the comic industry. His financial struggles are noted, and failed projects such as a Nexus animation are hinted at. We are left with his futile attempts to make it on his own selling his paintings in a gallery. As an artist myself I can relate to the struggles he faces trying to sell his fine art. It is a poignant documentary that left me wishing I could help the Dude.",1440374400,,922,4.423529411764706

6020408,4,B00FQRZ68S,"A great documentary on one of most gifted men in comics. Even with his battles both emotional and economical, he manages to do his best to make a difference even if it's at the cost of his own sanity. His struggle to find his place within the fine art world as displayed here is a consent battle for personal and economical satisfaction in a way he couldn't find it within his work in comics. I found Rude Dude a unique and engaging experience and a great learning tool to learn from as I'm entering a similar phase in my life as an artist.",1433808000,,540,4.252427184466019

6020410,5,B00FQRZ68S,"This is NOT depressing, and this is NOT a hatchet job.  And I have nothing to do with the documentary.  I found it while searching on Amazon Prime, and watched it.

This is a great documentary on a great human being and fantastic artist who has allowed the rest of us an unprecedented glimpse into his life.
I've been a Steve Rude fan since the early 90's.  I've read a lot of NEXUS, WORLDS FINEST, his issue of MISTER MIRACLE, his Fantagraphics sketchbook (I don't think it's available anymore), and seen tons of his covers.

 I've never had the chance to meet him, although I would like to.  I remember back in 1992... my first trip to the San Diego Comic Con... myself and a friend had to walk like 2 miles from our hotel to the venue.  For most of that, we could hear two guys talking loudly behind us the whole way... we thought two strangers were following us.  I was nervous.  When I finally had the gumption to look back... we were almost at the venue... and who did I see but Steve Rude and someone else (possibly Mike Baron).  It was him the whole time.  Hilarious!

Steve Rude is an illustrator of amazing means.  His paintings are gifts from God.  The way he sees life is a unique, stylized perfection.  His use of colors is pleasing to the eye.  His use of forms, layout, composition, and construction is 2nd to none.  If you know who his influences are, you may see snippets of them in his work... but when I see his work... I see only Steve Rude.  His comics storytelling is also amazing... full of life, vital, alive, and moving.

The documentary showcases a lot of his artwork, and has a lot of really cool interviews with people who have come to know Steve during his life.  People like Milton Griepp, John Davis, Mike Richardson, Adam Hughes, Mike Baron, the Reinholds... and many many more.  There are also lots of interviews with Steve in which he discusses challenges he has faced (artistic challenges, and other challenges).  It is very eye opening.

My first thought, upon finishing the film, was...  I need to go onto his website and buy something.  I've been on his Facebook group for a few years now.  I remember when he almost lost his home.  He seems to be doing better financially since then, and I honestly want the best for him.  He deserves it... especially how he's suffered so much for his art.

This documentary was excellent.  A portrayal of what it means to be human.  A must have if you are a Steve Rude fan.",1431561600,3,2447,4.429213483146067

6020415,5,B00FQRZ68S,"I'm biased, being a fan of his work. The documentary gave me what I wanted, a look into the mind and process of Rude's work but I got plenty more, more than I expected. It's also a peek into the world of depression and bi-polar disorder, which he suffers from. He and his strong wife allow us into their world to see the ugliness, the hardship that comes from dealing with and living with someone who has these issues. There are also some good, honest interviews with professional fans of his work.

It works well as a documentary, just don't expect to leave this film smiling.",1424390400,,577,4.443396226415095
6020416,4,B00FQRZ68S,"It's an insightful look into someone who I really admired in my teens. His comic book art was a significant step above anyone else out there, and you could see the amount of time and love he put into it in the angles he used, the background characters, the painted covers...

I can empathize with the depression, but it is sad to see Steve struggling so much. He is his own worst enemy, and he could be enjoying so much more success if we weren't undermining his own best interests all the time.

8618035,5,B00FQRZ68S,"This documentary is interesting and well done on several levels. It took courage on the part of Mr. Rude and his family to be so forthright in front of the camera about the difficulties of making a living as an artist.  What many people do not understand is that for the gifted, whether it be in music, visual, or performing arts, there seems to be a biological downside that even modern psychiatry doesn't seem to understand: creative people can be exceptional sensitive to what others do not see, feel, or hear, be frustrated at not being able to convey what is in their imaginations, and be unable to tune out what others might just consider the background noise of life. It was also interesting to see how Mr. Rude's style developed in his sketchbooks as he taught himself, his work on his own comic characters and others, and his foray into fine art, all interlaced with his personal life.  A nice touch was that some of the interviews were done in black and white, much in contrast to his intensely vivid color palette.  If Siskel and Ebert were still around, they would give this documentary two thumbs up. I was reminded of Leonard Nimoy's one-man performance ""Vincent,"" based on the correspondence between Vincent Van Gogh and his brother Theo (I think the video is available on Amazon as well).",1485388800,,1304,4.685589519650655
