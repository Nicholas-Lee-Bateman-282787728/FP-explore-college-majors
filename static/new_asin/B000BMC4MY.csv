8338662,3,B000BMC4MY,"Considering that this is the only training video on the Nikon D70 I have found it does have very good instructions, unfortunately the photography quality is very poor. Sometimes the person showing an action is partly in the way so you don't see everything. the composition is not so either and sometimes the focus is not as good as it should be for this type of video.
BUT, over all I still recommend it for those who are starting with little or no knowledge of DSLR photography. This video WILL be of great help to get you to know your Nikon D70. Both my daughter each have a Nikon D70 and we are new to digital photography so we will be studying this video intensely. Go ahead and buy one but be aware that the quality of photography is not the best but the information is very good.",1408838400,,785,4.3108108108108105
