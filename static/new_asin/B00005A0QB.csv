2929221,3,B00005A0QB,It was ok but it just seemed like a lot of scenes were cut out.  If this was the original version they should change the description of the movie.,1361145600,,146,4.0344827586206895
2929222,4,B00005A0QB,"This movie is a walking proof of the point that to judge a movie or a book or any other creative work one has to watch/read/view it, etc. by himself. Although there are obvious gaps in how the plot has been unfolded, the movie still grabs attention, and leaves much space for the inquisitive viewer's engagement in unraveling the story and the presentation of the characters.

Psychological drama by definition is not an easy entertainment with all i-s dotted and t-s crossed in the end of the story. It must carry the intrigue till the end, and often--beyond that and that is what the makers of this movie can boast of.

The seeming oddities in how characters are presented (Foster's insensitive, ""dead"" stare throughout the whole movie, and the grotesque frightening grimaces of Lithgow) in my view speak to the good acting not the poor one as it is sometimes presented in the movie's reviews.

I think that these particular ""speaking"" features in portraying the characters were chosen as the leitmotivs for their symbolic representation: those stares and grimaces stand for the ugliness of the situation when one human being could be easily arranged to be sold by a social institution to another human being in cold blood and with a hypocritical wish of prosperous future for the ""sold"" part, despite all the perversity of such an undertaking. The drama of the story in this case refers to the idea of to what extent a man can be hated by a woman for a physical and mental abuse when the murder could become the only way out, and how this hatred can lead to the crime that could be morally and, luckily to Victoria, legally justified.

In a word, it's not an easy entertaining stuff, it is a thought-provoking psychological drama rooted in sick societal norms of the past ( or the present as well?)that allowed society to treat women as commodities, i.e. be easily sold, traded and used as a walking meat by their husbands or forcefully acquired benefactors, and on top of that still be grateful to the abusers for their victims' keep. Foster's acting made this stance so obvious- her ""dead"" stare stands for the dead soul almost killed by the hypocrisy of the world around her.

By intensity of the bold acts, hidden emotions, and entangled motives, this movie reminds me of the famous Dickens's dramas, Dombey and Son in particular. The chopped make of the plot in my view does not really bring the overall quality of the movie down, but adds to the crude reality of the situation--it shows action in motion, and in retrospect, without a primitively smooth plot development. I give it a full four out of five.",1343606400,,2614,4.723684210526316
2929223,3,B00005A0QB,"There are enough reviews telling the story so I don't feel the need to tell it again.  Fact is, I understood the story,  making it utterly real.  John Lithgow was superb in his role, and Jodie Foster portrayed the character as numb - the only way a young girl would cope with a situation such as Victoria found herself.  The editing left a few holes but hey, the acting was fine with two excellent figures doing their best.  I would like to have read a book with more details, because it was a fascinating character study, though I still haven't taken enough showers to get the goo off me.  At the same time, it was creepy enough to hold my attention throughout the film, proving in my mind that it was a good story.  I usually turn off what does not hold interest, and not many movies stay with me for long.  This one has.  My recommendation is, see it and decide for yourself.",1341360000,,878,4.304878048780488
2929224,4,B00005A0QB,"A spooky movie based on a true story set in New Zealand in 1880. Jody Foster plays Victoria Thompson and John Lithgow plays Oliver Thompson. The circumstances of their marriage were strange enough: John picked out Victoria from an orphanage, and the second time she even saw him was their wedding day. She asked later how he came to choose her, whether someone told him about her, but he didn't answer.

Oliver was a business man, ran a string of grocery stores. His younger brother George worked for him, and was apparently quite smitten with his new sister-in-law. But Oliver was a bit of a pig. For one thing, he had holes drilled in the wall of Victoria's bedroom and watched her undress without her knowing it for some time. He was domineering and would not let her go anywhere without his servant as an escort, and was generally a loud-mouthed bully.

Since the movie opens with Victoria being tried for murdering Oliver, the only mystery is whether she is innocent or guilty. Or perhaps whether she is found guilty or not by the court.

The title comes from the fact that the local minister, who was a friend of theirs, was interested in mesmerism and got Victoria interested in it. One evening at dinner, he tried (not very seriously, it seemed to me) to hypnotize Oliver, but said he was too strong willed to be a good subject. He then successfully hypnotized Victoria with the greatest of ease. What became of this interest in hypnotism -- mesmerism, as it was then called -- is part of the mystery and the explanation for the title.

Meanwhile the minister, the doctor, and Brother George all seem to be in love with Victoria. Well, she does look like a young Jodie Foster, after all.",1336694400,,1695,4.602649006622516
2929225,3,B00005A0QB,"It is a strange twisting plot, but the acting of Foster and Lithgow is, as usually, excellent.
The main reason I bought this movie is because Lithgow is in it , and I think Foster is one of the best. The music is great, and the whole experience is bizarre.
 I think she did a good job for what she had to work with, which was a pretty dull script. The costuming and sets were all pretty top notch, as was most of the acting. John Lithgow, who played her husband, did a good job, in that he gave me the creeps. There was pretty good chemistry between she and her brother in law, making you believe they could have a thing goin' on.

An orphaned New Zealand girl married to an older, wealthy businessman learns to deal with his strange sexual desires.

There are so many problems with Mesmerized, it is difficult to decide just where to begin with them. This was a very poor screenplay with stilted dialog, zero character development & the plot drags like a stubborn mule. To sum it up, this film is dull, slow-paced and pretentious. This movie suffered from poor cinematography with dulled-out color & poor lighting. Jody Foster also served as co-producer.

Whatever happened behind the scenes with Mesmerized, it is clear that Jodie Foster bears culpability for much of this film's awfulness. She gave what was quite possibly the single worst performance in her acting career thus far. Throughout the entire movie, Foster's eyes have the glazed look that is so typical of cocaine users.. This is interesting in light of the fact that in December 1983, she was arrested and charged with possession of a small amount of cocaine. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a year's probation and had to pay the costs of court.

I really like Jody Foster but this is her worst. Don't waste your time or your money.",1318204800,,1807,4.564814814814815

you can see for yourself at these prices now on amazon. i have lent this out a few times already.

2929229,3,B00005A0QB,"Mesmerize means to hyponotize.  This is the flip side of Jodie Foster in her younger years as she had been put in an orphanage by her biological mother's father as an infant ""unnamed.""  The matron called her Victoria for the reigning Queen of England, and she grows into a beautiful, pensive, young lady in New Zealnd.  Out of the blue, an older, well-to-do merchant, Oliver Thompson, marries her, but she still has to stay at the orphanage not yet free (where her beauty is wasted) until she is of age.  Wehn she does go to him, a long voyage, he abuses her horribly.  She was never ""free"" as she was never ""free"" as she went from one bondage to a different kind, much worse.  It was as different as dark from light, or cold from heat.

She's called Madam in her own home, but things are not what they seem.  She has her own pianoforte.  He accused her of ""putting on airs"" -- a fine lady.  His crudity makes her quite ill.  Young brother, George comforts her and it turns into true love.  They try to run away, but there is an accident and she is the dummy who will be held responsible.  FAther and son consired to keep her as a prisoner.  She'd told George that ""I would have died had I stayed in that house.""  However, he survived and wrote her a letter which is kept hidden from her.  When she finds it, a true-love confession about providence and ""you are always in my thoughts.""

Like the oldest living Confederate widow, her much older husband takes advantage of her youth and is mean and cruel to her.  As she cares enough to give emotional support, things turn from bad to worse, and her baby is born dead because of his abusive manner toward her. She asks the priest why she didn't die, too.  I've often wondered that myself.  Oliver makes demands, distrusts her.  There appears a hypnonotist her like Terrence Weber in ""Born Yesterday"" who hyponotizes her and she is completely mesmerized and looked like a porcelian doll with those staring blue eyes.  He uses emotional abuse and she fights back by putting chloroform in his milk occasionally so that  he will fall asleep.  He had castigated her about not showing respect for old age.

The eyes and the hands of the devil are everywhere.  The priest encouraged her to divorce, as she has ""a long life ahead of you.""  The priest vanishes as soon as she is arrested for the murder of her husband.  The new doctor, Finch, makes house calls and finds mercury poisoning which attacks the liver.  He is told that it was from pesticides.  ""Your life is more important surely.""  He has no suspension of purposeful poisoning.  Oliver at the end is hysterical and suffers with his throat.  He'd been told that the state of his illness was not serious and he was fit as a fiddle.

His father accuese her of killing his son; after she is arrested she writes to George in Australia.  It was perceived that she had been spooked by supernatural forces, but the trial is held and the housekeeper testified against her.  Like mother, like daughter.",1168473600,,2994,4.51024208566108
2929230,2,B00005A0QB,"The premise for the film is intriguing. It is based upon the Victoria Thompson murder trial that took place in New Zealand during the late nineteenth century. Victoria is raised is some sort of orphanage from birth. At the age of seventeen, it is arranged for her to marry Mr. Thompson, a weird, older man whom she has never before met. She dutifully marries him, and when she comes of age goes to live with him in his home, which is run by his two creepy servants. Victoria soon discovers just how weird her husband really is. She ultimately takes the bull by the horns and finds herself standing trial for his murder by the time she is nineteen years old.

Jodie Foster places the role of Victoria Thompson, as if she were doing so under duress. She takes a character that is potentially sympathetic and makes her merely pathetic, leaving the viewer cold. John Lithgow fares somewhat better, as he does a credible job playing the weird Mr. Thompson, doing the best he can with the material with which he has to work. The film, unfortunately, is choppy and poorly edited, the story so muddled as to be nearly incomprehensible.

I can't understand why a title such as this would be brought to DVD, when so many other quality movies have yet to be released on DVD. And speaking of quality, that's the biggest problem with this movie - it looks like it was recorded from a tv with 'rabbit ears' tuned to a distant station. Picture quality - grainy.

The actress, Jody Foster, appears to be in a catatonic state throughout this film with the camera zooming in on her expressionless face and blue eyes.  She was accused of killing her husband and the doctor found chloroform in his stomach on autopsy.  There was hypnosis involved taught by the preacher who disappeared conveniently at the time of her arrest.  There was also a hint that there may have been some relation to the
young bride's father-in-law who looked like the man that left her at the orphanage to be raised until she was at age at which time this strange man appeared at the home and asks for her to marry him, pre-selecting her from all the young girls there.  If she was the illegitimate child of her father-in-law, then this was incestuous at best.  She gives birth to a stillborn baby.  We do not know if she took something to cause that, or could the blood lines have been too close.  She goes to trial for the murder of her husband and is acquitted due to reasonable doubt.  We next see her at the symphony with an older man.  She leaves there with a note and the postscript at the end of the film indicates she went to America with her dead husband's brother, George.  If this is truly based on a true story, more fact finding could have been done to support this film.",1485734400,,1966,4.377410468319559

8216460,5,B00005A0QB,"I watched this movie years ago on TV. I missed the first part of it, however, saw enough of the film to be captivated by the story. I purchased the DVD and now have seen the whole film. I know I am in the minority but I loved the film and the story is such an interesting one. The lesson for me is that you cannot micro-manage those you claim to love and you cannot force anyone to love you. I'm happy to have this film in my collection.",1475884800,,437,3.9213483146067416

8216466,3,B00005A0QB,"I was drawn in because I love Jodie Foster, and I love Victorian period pieces. But there are a lot of problems with the film, and I'd discourage anyone from watching who has anything better to do with their time! The first thing that really stood out to me were the plethora of accents: Although it's set in New Zealand, Foster's accent is vaguely British, the minister's accent actually sounds American (which I guess could be explained if he is a missionary) and the doctor's accent is also not at all Kiwi. Only Lithgow's accent is at all convincing. In fact, Lithgow is the only actor who actually seems like he knows he is in this film. The scenes of hypnotism are also sort of interesting, but insofar as they add to the plot, not thoroughly explained. Basically, it's a low-tension dud--although the cinematography is not bad.",1467849600,,834,4.680272108843537
