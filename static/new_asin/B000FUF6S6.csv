2588832,1,B000FUF6S6,"Beautifully acted talking head movie. We have varied scenes of Benito and his friends discussing socialism in pastures, convention halls, train platforms, newspaper press rooms and even in a Turkish bath. Amazingly, in the short five hours of this dialogue spanning several years of Benito's early life, they even managed to sqEEEEze in a couple of love scenes. The sub plot of Angelica, on again off again non-relationship with Benito kept the movie riveting.

I give it 5 stars, exept minus one for NO TIGER TANKS as depicted on the cover, minus another star for NO HE 111 Bomber fleets also depicted on the cover, less another star for NO INVASION OF ETHIOPIA with GAS and those kludged together but interesting looking Italian tanks and finally lose yet one more star for no COMMANDO RESCUE by Otto Skorzeny.",1159315200,3,812,4.884057971014493
2588833,3,B000FUF6S6,"Though most consider Mussolini, the inventor of fascism, to be an evil character, this movie about his life had the potential of being an exciting classic.

The real Mussolini was a fiery socialist and anti-war activist as a youth, but his keen political instincts catapulted him into power when he dramatically rejected both of these positions.

He fought in World War I, lead violent street movements throughout Italy against the socialists and other ""unpatriotic"" Italians and eventually became Europe's first fascist dictator.

As a modern Caesar, he sought out to re-establish the Roman Empire, invading northern Africa before World War II began in Europe.  He bargained with Hitler, invaded France, invaded Greece, made compelling speeches to his compatriots, and resisted the allies.

A movie that included the most significant events of Mussolini's life would be filled with dramatic twists and action.  The first time Mussolini fell, it took one of the most heroic rescues in history to save him.  The second time he fell, his own people dragged him through the streets and hung up the dead dictator for all the world to see.

If you expect to see all of this in the movie, you will be thoroughly dissappointed.  The movie is over 5 hours long, but only focuses on what happened BEFORE Mussolini went to World War I!

Instead of focusing on the events that made Mussolini one of the most interesting personalities of the 20th century, the entire film focuses on the political intricasies of the socialist movement in Italy before it became interesting.

The cover of the DVD has tanks, burning buildings, World War II era planes, a war ravaged city, and even a picture of what Mussolini would have looked like AFTER he became dictator.

This shameless deception makes the hapless DVD buyer think that he is in store for all of the excitement that took place in Mussolini's life.

Banderas acts very well and the movie's recreation of early 20th century Europe is pretty impressive.  In all fairness, the early part of Mussonlini's life is covered masterfully in this film.

Still, this does not make up for the squandered opportunity and misleading advertising that makes the film somewhat a disappointing.  If you want an exciting film that portrays the complete saga of Mussolini, do not watch this film.  But if you are interested in Mussolini's early life and appreciate the subtleties of political manuevering, you might enjoy it.  As a history buff, the film still got 3 stars out of me, but the movie might be especially boring and obtuse to the non-historian.",1157760000,6,2576,4.965034965034965
2588834,1,B000FUF6S6,"Although a remarkable, detailing of Mussolini's early life, it's just that - about his early life.  From the product's advertising, subtitle & artwork, one expects he or she is getting to see a complete life; in fact, however, the viewer sees a long and lengthy life only to WWI.  We don't see his joining the war, rise to power over Italy, and his actual Fall.  Shame on the producers and promoters of this film.",1157414400,19,413,4.554054054054054
2588835,5,B000FUF6S6,"In 1993 Gianluigi Calderone directed this biography of Benito Mussolini (script by Vincenzo Cerami and Mimmo Rafele) as a three-part television series, wisely electing to engage one Antonio Banderas, fresh from his triumph in the film 'Philadelphia' in the States, to tackle the legend of one of the treacherous leaders of Italy in the first half of the 20th century.  The DVD is now available in a 2-disc format, which allows the viewer to watch Parts I, II, and III on separate evenings.  It is a beautifully captured bit of history and Banderas proves his considerable acting chops in a role that spans the entire spectrum of emotional response.

The film opens when Mussolini, at age 19,  was disenchanted with being a schoolteacher and instead focused on womanizing and the plight of the workers in Italy.  A man of astounding power of verbal presentation and conviction, he managed to seduce not only nearly every woman who crossed his path but also the multifactioned working class, a mass of frustrated and abused workers who jumped from promise to cause to new hero with regularity in an attempt to change the sad situation of class struggle in Italy.

Mussolini (Banderas) manages to court the interest of Angelika Balabanoff (Susanne Lothar), a Russian Socialist with hard rules and concepts of her own but also a woman who could foresee Mussolini's growing importance as a leader of social reform. The story unwinds at a fine pace, pausing to reveal the tender side of the man with his marriage to his childhood sweetheart Rachele (Claudia Koll), his challenges to attack his education further through the influence of another lover, med student Eleanora (Anna Geislerov), as well as through his ruthless manner through his confrontations with Manzoni (Jan Novotny), Bissolati (Eduard Kolar), his rise to power by becoming the editor of Milan's influential Avanti! newspaper, and his leadership of the Italian Socialist Party.  But power gets a strangle hold on him and he develops the cruel Fascismo Party, and with that turns all of his supporters against him in his revolution that started for the working class into a sellout to the landowners, from his initial stance of pacifism of revolution to his active engagement in the World Wars.

Banderas does a fine job of allowing us to see all sides of Mussolini: this is not a cardboard cutout but a man with multi-dimensional characteristics.  The superb cast includes German, Spanish, Italian, and Czech Republic actors and therein lies a bit of a problem.  While the acting is excellent, it appears that each of the actors is peaking in his own tongue, that the final version released on DVD is dubbed in Italian and/or English with English subtitles.  But the dialogue is so fast-paced, filled with vibrantly important information that the viewer rarely gets to look at the mouths of the actors to see who is speaking what - so it doesn't distract from the brilliance of the film.

The cinematography and set design and costuming are all excellent as is the wondrous musical score by Nicola Piovani.  It would help to be more informed about Italian political history to fully enjoy this spectacle, but the epic does provide a fine condensation of years of world politics and the rise of Socialism that allows us to understand that strange era far better.  Watching BENITO requires an investment of time, but for this viewer the investment is well worth the effort and the subsequent pleasure.  Highly Recommended.

There was no ending, two discs, where was his fall and all the exciting aspects of his life..I want my money back and I want to return the most worst movie I have ever seen.",1252713600,3,333,4.6440677966101696
2588867,5,B000FUF6S6,"I was glued to this very long film. I seem to be the 15th review and I am distinctly in the minority in my enjoyment. Actually I agree with much of the criticism. Yes it was only his early life -- but you catch on to that right away. Obviously Banderas is not going to be playing the old Mussolini! The print is a bit grainy and off color much of the time.

It is also rather cerebral and not easy to follow. There are endless political party and ideological dealings. but while they are hard to keep up with and will be boring and indeed tedious for most viewers, they do give the flavor of an important time that we seldom think of carefully. I did a lot of backing up and playing sequences over. Yes the sets and costumes were great.

What I liked most was the characterizations. These were complex people caught up in complex issues in complex and dangerous times. Some of the acting was simply splendid in that it could bring color and dimension to these people. Mussolini and some of his colleagues are anything but one dimensional and I found myself involved in every dialogue and facial nuance trying to figure out what made them tick. I was left motivated to learn more about the real Mussolini.

But regardless of the real Mussolini, the hot headed and often overly macho womanizing Mussolini in the film comes across as a guy with abundant flaws and virtues and often it may not be realistic to judge which is which. One could say that is just him. Women can love him and be nauseated by him at the same time for example and still admire him. At times they judge him to be a ""real man"" and not just a man who acts manly. For some viewers the film may raise the issue of ""what is a real man"" and how does that attract women, and are they wise to be attracted or do they really see something worthwhile. And it is not just women. This Mussolini also had a charisma that men related to.

The women in the film are mostly great, and I don't mean just sexy, though some are quite attractive. There are some very interesting female characters.

One gets the feeling from the film that Mussolini could have gone on to be a genuine hero if he could eventually overcome some of his youthful stubbornness and could learn to control his fire. But of course we know from history that he became in fact an anti-hero. In this film we see the germs of his charisma and are not asked to pass judgment on his later life.

Again, whatever the real Mussolini was like, this was a fascinating film for me and well worth the work it took to watch it. I did not find it boring for a minute, but can easily understand why some would groan. I won't pretend that I could judge it by ""objective"" standards that would satisfy all possible viewers or even some hypothetical average viewer. That would be a fictional pretense. I will only say that I think it is possible to find a great deal of merit in it. I am really glad to have come across it.",1218844800,5,2930,4.298913043478261
2588868,3,B000FUF6S6,"Sorry to say that this item contains only the first of 3 dvds which complete the whole series. If you check the title ""a man named Benito Mussolini"" which is an import from Latin America, you'll see what I mean. Unfortunately the Latin American version only has audio in English (aufully dubbed from the originaly Italian), but it is worth watching.",1204156800,2,349,4.737704918032787
2588869,2,B000FUF6S6,"This movie certainly doesn't deal with Mussolini at the height of his power, nor his downfall. The film covers the period of his life from about 1902 to 1915, prior to Italy's entry into WWI.

Perhaps a better title for this would have been ""The Many Loves of Benito Mussolini"" as he seduces his way across Italy, Switzerland, and  Austria.  With varying degrees of success, he uses his charms on every female he meets - from the most influential woman in the European socialist movement to a naive 17-year old.  After debauching one young wife and mother, who is disowned by her husband's family and her own, Mussolini points out that socialism advocates free love and rises above petty bourgeois morality. (Although he has no plans to provide for this now homeless girl or her baby.)

For the most part, the film glorifies the youthful Mussolini's struggles and idealism.  A few weak criticisms are offered by other characters, including his wife and influential members of the socialist party, who point out that what he truly wants is not the realization of ideals, but power - regardless of what it takes to acquire that power.  Nevertheless, the film comes across as more of a tribute than a criticism of the future fascist dictator.

Politics aside, the film is gorgeous to watch.  The sets and costumes are beautifully detailed and amazingly accurate. The music is lovely.

Antonio Banderas, as Mussolini, is probably the only member of the cast who will be familiar to North American audiences. The actors do a fine job with a script that consists mostly of discussion and dialog, with a few fiery speeches of socialist rhetoric thrown in.

The film can be watched in Italian or English.  The English dubbing is laughable.  It sounds more like the kind of dubbing you would hear in a 1960's Japanese cartoon or a ""sword and sandal"" import movie.  The English voices step on each other's lines and don't allow time for reaction. Banderas does not read his own lines in the English version.  The Italian language version sounds much better, but it's hard to read subtitles for over five hours; you miss a lot of what is happening on the screen.

There are no special features available on this two disc set.

I'm giving this two stars because of the beautiful ""look"" of the film, and the excellent cast.  However, this is a terribly long, tedious film that manages to only deal with a fraction of the subject - a partial look at ""the rise.""  Content wise, it's an objectionable valentine to one of the 20th century's most vile leaders. The English language soundtrack is horrid, and the subtitles aren't much better.  Recommended only for the most ardent history buffs, or students of late 19th century Italian architecture.",1199145600,4,2731,4.80728051391863
2588870,1,B000FUF6S6,"If I could give this movie a 0 star I would.  This movie has nothing to do with the rise and fall of Mussolini.  What it has to do with is the formative years of Mussolini.  It does not show how Mussolini morphed the Italian Socialist party into the the Italian Facisit Party, how Mussolini siezed power in Italy, or how Mussolini lost power.  What it does show is a Mussolini that beds many women.",1194480000,,398,4.266666666666667
2588871,2,B000FUF6S6,"The cover of this film is completely misleading, as the film does not cover any of Mussolini's REAL rise and fall, but only the early part of his life as a Socialist newspaper editor.  To add insult to injury, it's HORRIBLY dubbed, even Banderas, and is over FIVE HOURS long.  It just drifts from dull dialog scene to another and watching it, I kept phasing in and out of consciousness in the vague hope that there would be some payoff in a cheaply-staged World War 1 battle a la GOOD MORNING BABYLON at the VERY LEAST!  No such luck.  The movie drags on and on until it abruptly ends right before Italy enters World War 1.  No invasion of Ethiopia, no annexation of Albania, no World War 1, no Graziani, no rescue, nothing.  Who ever thought this movie was a good idea?  There are some good period costumes though, and the acting is good by all (though I've never seen any of the supporting actors ever before).

Alas, we're left with no difinitive biopic on Mussolini, the 20th century's 2nd-most fascinating dictator.  Those interested are better off seeing LION OF THE DESERT or THE LAST 4 DAYS - both with Rod Steiger playing said dictator.",1166054400,5,1145,4.546341463414634
2588872,3,B000FUF6S6,"The Movie title is very misleading. This movie covers a short span of Benito Mussolini's life. Starting when he was a schoolteacher at the age of 19. And ending when he gets control of his own daily paper, which occurs during W.W. I. This actually took me by surprise since the movie is over 5 hours long and its title indicates that we will see his entire life. This movie is also dubbed, and not well at that.

Now the part of Mussolini's life that is depicted gives us a view of what he was like in his twenties as he gained power in the socialist movement. All you will see is how he maneuvered himself through the political intricacies of this movement in order to gain power, his volatile personality and his womanizing. If you expect to see anything more then this, do not watch this movie.

On the positive side, and the reason I gave it three stars, is that the wonderful sets and wardrobe were true to the period. And the acting was well done.",1163116800,26,953,4.348314606741573
2588873,1,B000FUF6S6,"What a terrible movie.  Not at all what I expected.  Anticipating a sweeping biopic of Mussolini's ENTIRE life (especially considering the 307 minute run time) imagine my surprise when the film ends twenty years before the start of WWII!  Instead we get Mussolini as a young ne'er do well aspiring Socialist.  This is probably the least interesting part of Il Duce's life story.  Rise and Fall?  It showed neither.  A more appropriate title would have been ""Mussolini in Love"" or maybe ""Springtime for Mussolini.""  Also, what is with the picture at the bottom of the box?  That (and the title) indicates that this would cover Mussolini's actual rise to power as the leader of Fascist Italy.  Additionally, on the back of the box there is a picture of footage of German Soldiers in WWII that isn't even in the film!  What is that about?  If you are interested in Mussolini I recommend you sit this one out.  If all you want to see is Antonio Banderas mug for the camera then I would suggest Zorro.",1162684800,12,996,4.622857142857143
2588874,5,B000FUF6S6,"I just finished watching the 1993 Gianluigi Calderone directed biography of Benito Mussolini, ""Benito: The Rise and Fall of Mussolini."" Being a DVD in 2-disc format it was a long movie, but Antonio Banderas' portrayal of one of the treacherous leaders of Italy in the early 20th century made it worth seeing. He presented a dark side of Mussolini that obviously made him feared by many. Antonio also proved that by age 33, he already had become a well-seasoned actor.

 The setting seems true to the period. There was a strong cast and dramatic plot twists. But, Desperado fans may not like the film. Those who liked the drama of `Evita' may. Also, the movie is dubbed so that it deprives fans of Antonio's unique voice and accent. Parts of the movie were sketchy when it came to historical facts that made Mussolini's name go down in history. The focused seemed to be on Mussolini's early life and political maneuverings that must have later made him great.

There was little footage of WWI or Mussolini's role in the war. We only see a few tanks, planes, and no real war coverage. Still, I am glad that I was spared seeing Mussolini's second fall--in which his people dragged him through the streets and hung him up for the entire world to see. I gave this movie 5 stars for its effect of Drama. But, beware of violence, sex, and nudity.",1161561600,2,1339,4.594142259414226
2588875,5,B000FUF6S6,"The review by Grady Harp would be impossible to top.

All I can add is that the story marvelously depicts how individual common workers in this age were passionately involved in the development of highly literate political and social debates, and in earnestly pursuing radical principles we could barely recite today.  Modern nations have relatively quickly converted vast numbers of us into spoonfed and unenlightened materialists, not really upset by politics until they frustrate one in getting more and newer stuff.  How cultivated societies shifted political outlooks after the two great wars, and eventually the cold war, is the bigger historical story, much better understood through the contrast provided by this account of Benito's role during his younger years in Italian and international socialist/facist politics.",1160870400,2,826,5.592

8126652,3,B000FUF6S6,"There's much to like & dislike about the movie, and the man.  Not many movies like this.  I like how it shows his home-life, his relationship w/ his family & wife & how it reflects his interactions w/ everyone else.  I felt so sad for his poor wife.  If only they could just sit down & discuss things respectfully..., just as he could have done w/ his friend/follower before he murdered someone & ruined his life.  These interactions & how they are portrayed are deep & revealing.  So much intrigue & passion.  You just have to love the passion of Italians.  Such beautiful people!
I've actually heard the ""Strike me by lightning"" argument before!  LOL.  I thought it was funny too, cause who are we to demand ANYTHING of the all-Wise?  Perhaps there are worse ways to punish a man than striking him with lightning, which, so I hear, the man doesn't have such a great reputation.  It's sad that the movie didn't get into the rest of the story, but perhaps it was the author's intent that we request it from him.  I for one would love for the producers to continue till the true ""fall"" of Mussolini.
I love that character of the woman who cried a lot.  Such passion!  Such inner-beauty, & conviction.  They all had such conviction, just, not in exactly the perfect ideals & principles,necissarilly, but it was nice & good entertainment to see how it all unfolds.
I also enjoyed the interesting talk about marrying the right woman.  Not sure I agree w/ it, after all, didn't Socrates marry a mean one?  but, interesting yet.",1408060800,,1522,4.553505535055351

I searched online to see if there was an additional release that had the requisite DVDs to cover the Rise and Fall of Il Duce with no success. This film covers the formative years of Mussolini as a socialist writer, leader and newspaper publisher. This is interesting, and is probably an overlooked part of his life, but the film ends bluntly as he starts along the road that would lead him to absolute power. This film is beautiful, and the acting is generally good. Banderas gives a very effective performance. The film has a slow pace which would have been OK if it ever got to the most prominent episodes of his life! I get the impression of a larger project that either lost its funding or plunged off a cliff. I listened to the Italian dialog with English subtitles. This meant that I was reading rather than viewing the film, but I hate dubbing. I am not sure that the voice I heard was Jose Banderas but it was close enough to forget about. Overall, the film depicts an important era in Italian socialist politics, and is valuable for that reason. However, it falls far short of fleshing out the rise of Mussolini, and his ultimate demise. If you are a Banderas fan this is a worthwhile purchase if you buy the DVDs at a bargain rate.
