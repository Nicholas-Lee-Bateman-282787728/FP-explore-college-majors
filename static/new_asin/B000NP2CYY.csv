You get this series.

It is either wildly ambitious or so flailing in its intent that it could have been six separate series.  It feels to me more of the latter, that this is a project representing every nuanced cliche, cinematic trick or technique Finkelman could remember at the time.  The characters are engaging, but for only a few minutes (that's all we get before we're thrown into another scenario).  The plots are momentarily intriguing, but then are interrupted by... song?  Obviously, here's one fellow who never learned the lesson of 'Cop Rock.'

I continue to be a great admirer of Ken, and will queue in line to see his next work as well.  The aftertaste of this series is like when your best friend shows you the dreariest and most forgettable photo album you ever saw.",1209168000,5,1015,4.502732240437158
