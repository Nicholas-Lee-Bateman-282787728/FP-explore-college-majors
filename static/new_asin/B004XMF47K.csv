8447171,2,B004XMF47K,I love the story but this film leaves a lot to be desired. The characters are choppy and the dialog is absolutely flat. There is no inflection in anyone's voice. Surely the filmmaker could have hired someone to make the story come alive! I am a teacher and I read this story to my classes every year. I have tossed this version. It is not worth keeping.,1494374400,,353,4.2835820895522385

8447176,5,B004XMF47K,"I have tried reading John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress but get lost in all the allegory and confused as to who is who and what they each represent. I read Little Pilgrim's Progress and understood much better but watching this video it all came together and made perfect sense. I could see my own trials and struggles (oh, the Castle of Giant Despair!) and was encouraged by seeing faith in action. Scripturally accurate there are parts that may be frightening to younger children such as Christians battle with Apollyon. I watched this with my grandchildren who were 5 and 7. The 5 year old was scared but I stopped the video and was able to explain from the Bible what was happening. The battle is real and at times scarey even for grandmothers, but we have a Savior who we can call on in out time of trouble! Yes, the animation leaves a bit to be desired and the monotone voices are distracting... but only in the beginning. You quickly become so taken by the story that you barely even notice them. A great visual of the Christian walk. I can't recommend it highly enough.",1419897600,,1074,4.541237113402062
8447177,4,B004XMF47K,"Good movie for the kids. The animation is kinda lame, but the story more than makes up for it. Also can be a little intense for younger viewers, my four year old won't watch some parts alone.",1404172800,,191,4.1891891891891895
8447178,5,B004XMF47K,This was a great movie. I thoroughly enjoyed sharing it with the kids. They really understood what it means to be a Christian.,1371600000,,126,4.521739130434782
8447179,5,B004XMF47K,"Great video for understanding the gospel.  Though children may be scared of the monsters, my 8 year old says it's scary, because of the monster and will only watch it with me.",1370822400,,175,4.46875
