8024997,5,B0002A2VX2,"As a die-hard ""B"" western fan I consider myself very lucky. We now have the ""Monogram"" western packages, the""Durango Kid"" from Sony, ""Lash La Rue"" (not pristine but very watchable), Tim Holt westerns, ""Range Rider"" from Alpha (surprisingly good quality), Lone Ranger, and - oh and of course many of Gene Autry's films, all excellent quality (apart from Lash). ""INDIAN TERRITORY"" remains one of my favourite Autry's - full of action, a good if standard plot, Gail Davis and a particularly good matching of stock footage, something ""B"" westerns disdn't always accomplish. The fights are hefty (tho doubles are obvious with the 3 Gene/Monte Hale punch ups.). 7o minutes fly by. I just wish some of the prices were lower, take a gamble on ""used"". I did, and it was perfect quality and delivery. (P.S. I forgot to mention the xtras which include a filmography of Gail, an excerpt from ""Annie Oakley, and a ""Melody Ranch Theatre"". Also...I swear the still at the bottom of the DVD cover does not appear in the film...Oh and James Griffith steals the film...and Pat Buttram is preferable to the awful Smiley B.)",1518739200,,1104,4.8465608465608465
8024998,5,B0002A2VX2,"This is another good action western from director John English, known as one of the best directors of B-westerns.  Autry starts out as an Army sergeant but before long he is back in his cowboy garb.  The story takes place in the desert in and around Pioneer Town, the movie set developed by Russell 'Lucky' Hayden, and located near Palm Springs.

One major discrepancy about story lines and filming locations is apparent here.  Why were so many plots written as being stories about cattle ranching when the locale is so obviously nothing but desert, rocks, and mountains?  You would think the producers would notice that there is scarcely a blade of grass for the cattle, but this shows up in so many westerns.

Gene sings two songs that were hits in 1950 when this movie was produced:  ""Chattanoogie Shoeshine Boy"" (a hit by Red Foley) and ""Irene Goodnight"" (a hit by The Weavers) along with another one or two songs.  The movie quality is excellent.",1403740800,,951,4.721212121212122
8024999,5,B0002A2VX2,You cannot get much better than a good Gene Autry movie. The Quality is very good and the restoration is top notch.,1358121600,,115,4.2727272727272725
8025000,5,B0002A2VX2,"It's funny about Gene Autry's movies of the late 1940s and early 1950s; he always knew when he had a good vehicle to work with, and when it was run of the mill. You can see it in his intensity, or lack of same, in acting his part.

This is one where Gene's interest is obviously riveted by the plot and his fellow actors from the start. He's a former Army captain working for the Army to find out who is provoking renegade Apaches into ambushing wagon trains bringing supplies to the settlers. He uncovers a renegade half-breed and an arrogant Austrian aristocrat transplanted to the late 19th Century American West who are behind all the trouble, and deals with them after several encounters.

Autry is given considerably more dialogue in this film than in many of his movies, and he handles it well. Heck, he even speaks in the Apache language in two scenes, as he is a ""blood brother"" to an Apache chief whose life he saved when Gene was just 18. It's doubtful that Gene Autry could actually speak any language except his native English, but he was a superb mimic who makes the Apache language in this film, and Spanish in a number of songs he recorded in his career, sound very convincing.

Gene's expertise at fight scenes, learned during his many pictures, is on display here, as he is engaged in at least five brawls during the film -- one with two Apaches who are trying to knife him, three with Kirby Grant, who plays his friend, a young Army officer very touchy about his dignity and rank; and the fifth and climactic one with the Austrian, who is determined to kill Autry. Gene appears to have done all the stunting himself, which was sometimes true in his movies, and sometimes not.

The film includes some excellent cinematography of rampaging cattle and Indian attacks on settlers, although a minor complaint is that there are a few scenes of obvious stock footage from earlier Autry movies. But, that was usually the case in B-Westerns.

All in all, I highly recommend this film. It's got a good plot, great action scenes -- and a fully engaged star who knew a good Western when he was in one.",1348444800,,2108,4.536842105263158
8025001,5,B0002A2VX2,"This fine Gene Autry picture is different from other Autry films in that it is set in the Old West. There are no cars or telephones here - Gene communicates by smoke signals!

""Indian Territory"" features a wonderful song: Chattanoogie Shoeshine Boy.

I am looking forward to the release of two other great Gene Autry films from Columbia: Loaded Pistols (available from Amazon, but not in the restored version) and The Last Roundup. According to William K. Everson, writer of A Pictorial History of the Western Film, these two pictures are among the best B-Westerns made anywhere. I've seen Loaded Pistols and I agree.",1129680000,3,617,4.923076923076923
