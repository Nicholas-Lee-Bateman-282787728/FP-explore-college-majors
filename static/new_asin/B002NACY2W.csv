8374881,5,B002NACY2W,Great for all Penn State fans.  Especially if you were a student there at the time and lived and cheered those great memories that were on that DVD.,1506988800,,148,4.285714285714286
8374882,5,B002NACY2W,"If you are reading this, looking to buy this dvd, then chances are you know all you need to concerning the game itself. Therefore, I'll spare you the history of it.
Presented without commercial interruption, this is the complete ABC telecast with the exception of halftime as both pregame and postgame are included. Perfect picture quality throughout although the majority of the second quarter has a tracking issue(I know, VHS, right?) at the top of the picture. Quality is still wonderful but that top distortion exists. Also, there are edited huddles(a pet peeve of mine) at different times during the game. I counted six but may have missed or overlooked some so there may be even more than that. These are minor things though. Overall, this is an awesome keepsake from JANUARY 1, 1983.",1486339200,,790,4.902985074626866

8374886,5,B002NACY2W,Saw the game in Mexico live with spanish announcers over the english speaking ones. Small mixed crowd of die hard fans from both sides sitting in a little room with small tv. Still a great game to watch every few years.,1354665600,,219,4.365853658536586
8374887,4,B002NACY2W,"Very well done duplication of this game, great quality.

I would have given it 5 stars had the extras not been a disaster. The box says 'season highlights' and I see none for Georgia and all I see for Penn State are highlights from the Pitt game. That is one game, not a season. Odd. Misleading.",1263772800,2,295,4.267857142857143
