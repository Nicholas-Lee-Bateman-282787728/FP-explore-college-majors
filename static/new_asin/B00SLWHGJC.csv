6991432,5,B00SLWHGJC,"Before stumbling across The Marcel Perez Collection; I had never even heard of Marcel Perez...  Marcel Who???  Unfortunately Marcel Perez has been largely forgotten in our modern fast paced world; that is, until now!  This is truly a wonderful collection of 10 films of a true pioneer in the silent comedy field.  5 films from Italy that have been preserved by the EYE Filmmuseum Nederland & 5 films from the United States preserved by The Library Of Congress.  In the Italian films Perez plays Robinet in each short which range from 4 - 8 mins.  In the American films Perez plays multiple characters and these are my personal favorites.  The running times on the US shorts run from 12 - 21 mins each and have a little more depth than the Italian films.  As an FYI not all of these shorts are 100% complete; it is what has survived, some with newly created title cards that do the films justice!  Please do not let that bother you, as it is common for many silent films & shorts to be missing sections and it does not take away from the overall story.  Many thanks to Ben Model & Steve Massa for creating this collection, we all owe them a debt for providing this national treasure!  So slow down; take a step back in time and enjoy an evening on the couch... watching The Marcel Perez Collection!",1422316800,5,1297,4.476595744680851
6991433,5,B00SLWHGJC,"About three years ago, I had the pleasure of seeing for the first time, a comedian from the silent era by the name of Marcel Perez at the Museum Of Modern Art's ""Cruel And Unusual Comedy Series"" and have been a die hard fan of Perez ever since. No comedian (from that era) has seen such a comeback with modern day fans of silent comedy than Marcel Perez. THE MARCEL PEREZ COLLECTION will give fans a glimpse to see one of the silver screen's earliest comedians in this dvd of ten restored shorts from his Italian and American film career. Perez made his film debut in 1900 some fourteen years before the arrival of Chaplin and quickly became popular with European movie audiences and by the 1910s, it was only a matter of time until Perez would unleash his fast paced cartoonish screen antics among American audiences. By 1915, Perez was an international superstar by the the time he came to America and this dvd showcases his best surviving European and American comedy shorts.

Restored by the Eye Inst., the first five films focuses on his Italian comedies, while the final five films on the disc comes from his American one and two reel comedies are restored by the Library Of Congress. Here are just a few highlights of some of the films on this collection.
ROBINET'S WHITE SUIT ('11) the earliest surviving film has Robinet (Perez) trying to keep his white suit clean with disastrous results.

MADEMOISELLE ROBINET ('12) Takes a look at Robinet trying not to get caught by his girl's husband as he dresses in drag only to get hit on by her husband and several other men.

ROBINET IS JEALOUS ('14) Robinet decides to spy on his wife and leads him into difficult comical slapstick situations.

A BUSY NIGHT ('16) is a real treat and probably the best introduction to this comic genius. In the film, Perez plays Tweedledum and 15 different roles and even spoofs Ford Sterling. The real star is the jaw dropping visual effects in which makes you think there was several Perez clones among the set.

CAMOUFLAGE ('18) Perhaps the real bonus on this disc is this film. Originally released as a two reeler, only the second reel survives and was restored by the LOC last summer. The plot has Tweedy following an actress (played by his real wife, Nilde Babette)for whom he thinks she's a German spy and works for the Kaiser, only to find out she's an actress. Very cartoonish, gags well executed and outright. Perez uses different disguises ranging from blackface to a walking humanized pile of trash. The film works well as a one reeler.

YOU'RE NEXT ('19) Shot in New Jersey, this short has Tweedy running amuck in a movie studio. This film was shot at the old Kalem studios, perhaps best known today for releasing the HAM AND BUD comedies during the 1910s.

SWEET DADDY ('21) The only short that features one of Perez's 1920s film work. In it, Perez plays a henpecked husband who is chained at the neck by his wife in the kitchen and when he tries to stand up for himself, she throws him out of the window where he is dangling for dear life. Once she sends him to the store, Tweedy becomes smitten by a stage actress and tries to woo her with great success until his wife shows up on the scene and all hell breaks loose with cartoon gags.

His American films are the best on this disc, shot in Jacksonville Florida, Cliffside, NJ and Yonkers, NY are some of his best work. The difference between Perez and Max Linder, is that Perez had the better success here in the States than Linder did.

In all, this is the best release from Ben Model and Steve Massa and fans will certainly not be disappointed with this dvd and the booklet from Steve Massa on Perez's film career is accompanied. Undercrank Productions has been a godsend to fans of silent film comedy and I urge all of you, to get this dvd and discover a true pioneer of film comedy .",1422316800,8,3840,4.53757225433526
6991434,5,B00SLWHGJC,"Marcel Perez: For too many years he has been a rather small footnote in film history. Yet he labored in the industry from its very infancy to the apogee of the silent era. This collection of short films starring (and many directed by) Marcel Perez should convince you that here is a talent whose sharp edge has been unfairly dulled by the cruel passage of time, and only because of the scarcity of his surviving film heritage. Yet, viewing this assemblage of films (some of which are over a hundred years old) , one is constantly amazed and pleased by the innocent, yet technically innovative nature of these short subjects. Perez is like a rose pressed between the pages of a forgotten book. Though faded, its beauty remains, and reminds us of pleasures just on the cusp of forgetfulness, but easily retrieved if we make the effort to remember.",1422316800,4,845,4.677852348993288
6991435,5,B00SLWHGJC,"For silent film buffs this may well turn out to be the #1 DVD of the year. But it's more than that: for comedy fans The Marcel Perez Collection marks the comeback of the century, for it highlights the work of a comedian who was until very recently almost completely forgotten and unknown, even to hardcore buffs. Throughout his screen career, which spanned some twenty-plus years in Europe and the USA, Perez was variously known behind the scenes as Marcel Fabre, Fernandez Perez, Marcel Perez, etc., while his screen persona was variously called Robinet, Tweedledum, Twede-Dan, Tweedy, and Bungles. (Where posterity is concerned, the variant names were decidedly a drawback for film scholars.) Like his contemporary Max Linder, Perez began with very short, simple comic premises, and gradually worked his way to longer and more elaborate creations. But also like Linder, unfortunately, his life was beset with tragedy. Health problems forced his retirement as a performer in 1922. He worked behind the scenes as long as he could, but died young in 1929, and was promptly forgotten.

In recent years, however, film historians Ben Model and Steve Massa have labored to bring the surviving work of Marcel Perez back into public view. They have sponsored a number of film screenings, at the Museum of Modern Art and elsewhere. Mr. Massa devoted a chapter to Perez in his silent comedy tome Lame Brains and Lunatics, and this chapter has recently been updated and expanded into a book entitled Marcel Perez: The International Mirth-Maker. And now, happily, a representative sampling of comedies, beautifully restored, have become available on DVD, thanks to the tireless efforts of Messrs. Model & Massa.

The disc is split into two sections. The first represents Perez's European origins, with five shorts made in Italy between 1911 and 1914, while the second part represents his American output with five shorts made for various companies between 1916 and 1921. My favorites include Robinet is Jealous (1914), which highlights Perez's impressive physicality and energy; A Busy Night (1916), in which, thanks to remarkable camerawork, Perez plays multiple roles, years ahead of Buster Keaton and Lupino Lane; Camouflage (1918), which features some laugh-out-loud sight gags; and Sweet Daddy (1921), a crazy farce that plays like a live action Tex Avery cartoon.

The prints generally look quite good, considering their age, and all are backed by Mr. Model's lively and inventive piano scores. (Meanwhile, Mr. Massa's book makes the ideal source for background information.) This disc is a pleasant surprise for silent comedy buffs, especially the ones who think they've seen it all, and that there's nothing new to be discovered. I'm pleased to report that The Marcel Perez Collection proves them wrong.",1422316800,13,2800,5.217777777777778
6991436,5,B00SLWHGJC,"First class presentation of some rare and worthy films.  A mixture of Perez's European and American comic shorts.  The films are charming, distinctive, and most importantly very entertaining. Good picture quality, excellent musical accompaniment by Ben Model.

6991437,5,B00SLWHGJC,"Following up on last year's ""The Mishaps Of Musty Suffer"" DVD, Undercrank Productions has produced this collection of obscure shorts from the forgotten silent comedian Marcel Perez. In collaboration with the EYE Filmmuseum in the Netherlands and the Library of Congress, Undercrank presents five films from Perez's Italian period (ranging from 1911 to 1914) and another five from his American films (1916-1921). The films look surprisingly nice (this was obviously a labor of love on everyone's part), and Ben Model's scores are PERFECT for them. More importantly, Perez himself was a talented comedian who has been undeservedly forgotten. For silent film fans - and fans of silent comedy in particular, this is a must have. Also, don't forget to pick up Steve Massa's book ""Marcel Perez The International Mirth-Maker,"" it's very much the companion to this DVD and will provide interesting background that will add to your enjoyment of these films.",1422316800,6,948,5.28476821192053
8698856,1,B00SLWHGJC,"Given the cumulative five stars posted for this reissue of Marcel Perez comedy shorts, my one-star review is contrary and dissenting. Perhaps this may be a case of ""Sorry, but I honestly don't get it."" If that proves to be the case, then my apologies for this review. I give it one star, not for quality or enjoyment, but for the fact that devoted cinephiles worked to make available the work of a hitherto forgotten film comic. Beyond that, I was astonished at the horrid quality of the purported ""HD digital transfers"" (note the absence of a claim of restoration). My family and I felt we must be trying to watch a rude transfer of some old kinescoped TV shows. On a more important matter, one reviewer claimed that Perez was ""funnier than Chaplin"". That blasphemy, on the evidence as presented in this dvd, is absurd and an insult to a master. Perez' physical antics lacked the poetry of his comedic contemporaries, unless sticking out one's tongue is an indication of deft physical comedy. The situation, gag and reactions captured on these eight shorts were old and discarded by comedians of talent and ambition by the time (half before 1915 and half between 1916 and 1921) Perez made the total of eight one- and two-reel films that comprise the offerings on this dvd. As to as mention of a pamphlet by the highly respected silent film and comedy maven, Steve Massa, it did not accompany the dvd I received from Amazon. That is merely a packing oversight. Watching this dvd was painful. My rule for reviewing dvd, cds or books is to review only work I admire, or work I think might cheats a customer. That said, My opinion may well be a disservice to a comedian. I think not. And a warning as to how technically wretched this dvd is. That is my service to prospective purchasers--this from one who happily watches unrestored Monogram and PRC westerns issued by Apha dvd.!",1485302400,5,1876,4.653614457831325

8698860,5,B00SLWHGJC,"Let me start by saying that, as in my review of the accompanying Steve Massa Booklet; Marcel Perez: International Mirth-Maker, I am a little positively biased being the Grandson of Marcel Perez. However, throughout my life I was never able to view any of my Grandfathers films for the same reason that my Father never got to see them. We were always told by anyone whom we were able to contact about Marcel that all of his films were apparently lost or destroyed. Thank the film gods that this was finally proven wrong through the unending perseverance and hard work of Ben Model and Steve Massa! And although it didn't happen in time for our own Father to see the results, I and my younger Sister, Juanita have been blessed to see our Grandfather on screen for our first time. I must say that I am truly grateful, as this collection of his Italian and American films are absolutely amazing! His comedy is, in my humble opinion, really on par with or even better than others of his era. Ben Model does an excellent job providing the musical score for all of these films which keeps the action and interest moving along. If you want to see one of the pioneers in the silent film era you really must buy this DVD and the companion book Marcel Perez; International Mirth-Maker by Steve Massa. The 10 film DVD is constant comedy and the book has many wonderful still photos and much needed and appreciated narrative about Marcel's life.
Happy viewing and reading!",1422576000,18,1459,4.593869731800766
8698861,5,B00SLWHGJC,"Well it just doesn't get better than this. Finding good comedy is always a joy, but discovering a ""lost and forgotten"" comedian that makes great entertaining comedy is a thrill akin to finding a beloved lost piece of jewellery- and the Marcel Perez collection is just that:a jewel of a dvd. Covering 5 of his Italian films and an equal number of his American works, Marcel Perez: International Mirth Maker is fast, funny, inventive and worth it. Pair this with the Marcel Perez booklet and you have a silent comedy discovery like no other.",1422576000,2,539,4.74468085106383
8698862,5,B00SLWHGJC,"Great to see this long-forgotten comedian finally getting his due, with this expertly-curated set comprising some of his best European and American shorts. There's more to silent comedy than Keaton, Chaplin and Lloyd. Thanks to Ben Model's Undercrank Productions, we've already had a chance to see Musty Suffer, plus rare features from Monty Banks and Johnny Hines. Undercrank also produced those wonderful ""Accidentally Preserved"" DVD sets. This Perez collection tops them all and is a ""must-have"" for silent comedy fans.",1422576000,2,522,5.5375
8698863,5,B00SLWHGJC,"Marcel Perez was a pioneering, irreverent and VERY funny comedian in the early days of motion pictures. Under a slew of different character names (Robinet, Bungles, Tweedy, Tweedledum, Twede-Dan), Perez starred in 200+ films, both in Europe and America. While it seemed Perez' entire celluloid career had disappeared from the face of the earth, the archivists of EYE Filmmuseum and The Library Of Congress, with film historians/preservationists Steve Massa and Ben Model, have located quite a few of his imaginative comedy short subjects. Ten films, several co-starring the talented comedienne Nilde Barrachi, have been rescued and restored for this DVD compilation. It's a pleasure to see the dancer-like Mr. Perez gleefully thumb his nose at the early 20th century conventions here in the 21st century.",1422403200,3,804,5.44
8698864,5,B00SLWHGJC,"This is a beautifully produced DVD, both in terms of the quality of the films rounded up from all over the globe and the wonderful musical accompaniment that supports them. Marcel Perez is a delight to watch, not only for the zany situations that he dreamt up for himself and his cast members, but as well for the graceful athleticism of his strenuous routines. He makes some of the most eccentric movements look completely natural, and I can only assume that his early days in the circus included a lot of acrobatic work. No, you've never heard of him before, but you won't soon forget him. The book that accompanies the DVD is a treat as well, and nicely profiles this long lost and almost forgotten genius.",1422403200,3,709,4.590551181102362
