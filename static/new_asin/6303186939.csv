7840306,4,6303186939,"This gets four stars AS A ""B"" MOVIE from me.

It is worth a little fun.  The only live-action-mixed-cartoon I have ever really enjoyed.  That's cuz the live action (the human hosts of the roaches) are total background characters, perhaps.  It has quite a few funny scenes, the slob single-male being the land of milk and honey to the roaches is very funny.  His love interest has created war and horrible losses for her roaches, cleaning, no food, spraying, very difficult existance.  But if the human man and woman  fall in love what will happen to the fat and easy roaches in the bachelor pad???  Will the woman clean???  Will she move out of her own place, giving new hope to her own roach colony?  And what will happen if the two roach colonies become aware of each other and communicate?  Can they join forces and live together???

If you've got a couple of hours to kill, it's worth a laugh...",1377302400,,899,4.515527950310559

Adorable Cartoon cockroaches and real live Japanese actors (they never seem to speak.) In my opinion, the film feels grainy or poor quality, perhaps on purprose, to enhance the kitschy ""B movie"" appearance? Not sure, but the cartoons are super cute! Our cockroach Hero and Heroine must accept a travel adventure to save the day! I don't wish to spoil the movie, but this has the first ""talking turd"" way before South Park ever did that...",1315008000,,554,4.831578947368421

7840310,5,6303186939,"A compelling story of two roach colonies that are in opposite extremes of existance.  One colony that lives in a single guy's apartment and the other in the apartment of a single woman.  It echoes a tale of two cities.  One nirvana, the other a constant battle for survival.  The animation is simply like no other.  If you don't like roaches you will love this movie.  It has a compelling story as the two colonies face extinction.  A must have for any animation collection.  Simply a classic.",1022976000,8,493,4.586206896551724
