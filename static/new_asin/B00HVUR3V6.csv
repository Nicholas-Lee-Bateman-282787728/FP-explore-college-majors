8636569,5,B00HVUR3V6,"Barre is my new fitness favorite and this workout from Barre 3 doesnt disappoint.  Sadie Lincoln, the co-founder of Barre 3, leads this 60 minute barre studio workout.  Almost every section emphasizes the core, which is a good thing for me.  I don't like working my core, but I persist because I can clearly see results.

The equipment needed for this workout:

* Chair or other waist-high surface for support
* Light dumbbells (Sadie uses 2 pounds)
* Mat
* Small playground ball or Barre 3 core ball.

The workout is divided into 5 10-15 minute sections so you can pick and choose the length of your workout, depending upon your schedule.

The sections:

* Yoga Flow & Core  13:52 minutes
* Legs  12:32 minutes
* Arms & Core  12:51 minutes
* Core & Stretch  12:06 minutes.

Even though the workout is divided into these sections, the flow between the sections is seamless.
I love this workout because like all the other Barre 3 workouts that Ive done, it sneaks up on me.  While Im doing it, Im thinking, This isn't so tough.  But then the next day, both my legs and my core are talking to me!

Here are more details about each of the sections:

YOGA FLOW & CORE

Sadie does her signature warm up which includes some nice gentle yoga flows.  I love using yoga to get my body warm and ready for the work.

LEGS

This is all standing leg work.  You start with the infamous power legs, which entails various leg exercises while the ball is between your knees.  All I can say is ouch.

You also do lunges, squats, plies and end with a well-deserved stretch.

ARMS & CORE

This section begins with cat cow and flows into crazy cat cow.  I love cat cow because of how it gently stretches my spine.  With crazy cat cow, you go on top of your feet when doing cat.

The standing sweeps with your legs while moving your arms holding light weights is a nice way to get your heart rate elevated without any stress on your joints.

GLUTES & CORE

This section has my least favorite exercise.  Its the one where you're lying on your back, with the ball under your sacrum (Im not exactly sure what is the sacrum, but anyway).  You then proceed to do things like bicycle or raising and lowering your legs.  Im never sure exactly what the ball is supposed to accomplish, but I persist.

You also do the dreaded diamond exercises with the ball under your side.  These are killers!

CORE & STRETCH

Sadie makes every minute count in this workout and this section is no exception.  Pelvic tucks with the ball on your stomach is the basis of this section.  These movements are small and may seem insignificant, but its critical to get understand and practice the pelvic tuck while you're doing core work.

All in all, this is a great workout.  The pace is slow and controlled so you can really focus on your form.  Sadie is a master teacher.",1400976000,28,2821,4.417153996101365
