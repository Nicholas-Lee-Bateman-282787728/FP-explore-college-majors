5467765,5,B00AQ590FK,"Mill Creek has given us the first 28 episodes on this 3 disc set of another show I watched as a child. It wasn't as good as my other favorites (Power Rangers and VR Troopers), but it is up there. I didn't think we'd ever see this show on DVD though. I don't know anyone else that is around my age that even knows about this show. It only managed to complete one season before being canceled. I am excited to see more American Tokusatsu being released onto DVD, and I hope Mill Creek releases Volume 2 with the remaining 25 episodes.",1363219200,3,532,4.2254901960784315

5467767,5,B00AQ590FK,"I don't know how many people actually watched this when they were young, but I watched the show until it stopped airing and wore the VHS out! I couldn't stand the anticipation for this thing. My local stores had almost every CookieJar logo show out except this one, so I ordered it via Amazon, and I'm glad I did! The show is top-notch when it comes to Power Rangers-Like shows and even flows a little better than the Power Rangers in terms of story and action. (Now if I can just get them to re-release the old toys...)

If your kid is a Rangers nut and you can't afford the newest DVD set then get him this and he will be rocking to electric metal while an Ultra Man spin-off tears into Godzilla-like creatures in computer circuts. How can you go wrong?",1361664000,,755,4.316901408450704
5467768,5,B00AQ590FK,"I used to wake up before 5:30am to watch this show daily, and LOVED it (I was in my early 20s no less lol).  I've had some of the VHS shows that were available from this, and have been waiting for this to be on DVD for SO long now.  I've already pre-ordered.  This show definitely counts as cheesy, but it's just so much fun, and at the time it came out, was a very unique premise.  It's also a load of fun to say the name of it really fast to people who've never seen it ;-) lol.  SO excited to get my DVDs - my son will be watching these with me - a new generation of fans =)",1360713600,,577,3.7355371900826446
5467769,5,B00AQ590FK,I absolutely loved this program of 1993! I will say it is kind of a pre-curser to the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers also of 1993! I myself will also say this show sparked my interest in computers! Any kid today should watch this show to learn the responsibility in owning and operating a computer or computer-like devices! Remember to use your powers for GOOD kids! No creating mega-virus monsters to attack electronic systems! But none the less it was and still is a great show! I will be adding this to my video library! Go Team Servo! Let's Samuraize Guys! Let's kick some GIGO-BUTT! Amp up the Power!,1358208000,3,603,4.592592592592593
5467770,5,B00AQ590FK,"It was the 90's and MMPR was tearing a huge chunk out of the collective wallets of parents all over the United States. Wanting to get in on the craze, DIC imported a interesting spin-off of Tsuburaya's Ultraman called Denkou Choujin Gridman after Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters From Beverly Hills (which also had some very Ultraman like elements to it) had failed.

The show (rebranded Superhuman Samurai Syber Sqaud) is about a young teen named Sam Collins and his three friends who play in a band called Team Samurai. One day Sam is mysteriously sucked into his computer and bonds with an anti-virus program called Servo. The series follows him attempting to take out a rouge government program named Kilokhan as well as his lackey Malcom Frink, who supplies him with digitally scanned artwork of monsters which he uses to create ""mega-virus monsters"" so that they can wreck havoc on the digital world.

To assist Servo are ""helper programs"" that are piloted by his band mates. There's Vitor (a red jet fighter), Borr (a mobile unit with twin drill bits), and Tracto (a tank with two laser guns on the sides). Servo combines with these to obtain powerful armor that transforms him into ""Samurai Synchro"" in order to better combat Kilokhan's minions. There is also Jamb and Torb, which create ""Samurai Phomo"". Jamb can also be used as a projectile flamethrower, not to mention that the two can form their own independent mecha. Same with Vitor, Borr, and Tracto.

Now do keep in mind that this show came out when the internet was in it's infancy. The show could hardly be called a success in it's home country, but surprisingly it did rather well here. Had it been released or conceptualized a bit later, it probably wouldn't have been just a footnote in Eastern Superhero culture.

All in all though, the show is very enjoyable and I'd dare to say that it's even BETTER than Power Rangers, but that's just my own opinion So if you like Ultraman, Megaman NT Warrior, & Tron, then do yourself a favor and get this DVD You WILL NOT regret it, trust me",1356825600,9,2051,4.704735376044568

5467794,4,B00AQ590FK,"Sam is the Leader of the group - the main hero and the singer in the band. Sydney is the computer genius and keyboard player. Tanker is a jock and a drummer. Amp is a goof ball character and a base guitar player. In the physical world they're best friends, high school students, and muscians. In the digital world they're The Superhuman Syber Squad - virus hunters.

Kilokahn is an artificial intelligence. A malevolent program out to destroy the human race. Malcolm Frink is a classic hacker character. An outsider furious with society. He sits behind his computer while his viruses do damage. He causes damage from a distance, not truly experiencing the effects or feeling the results.

In syber space Syd, Tanker, and Amp pilot various attack vehicles. Drago's an enormous jet. Borr's a tank with twin drills, that can fly or burrow underground. Tracto's mini tank with lasers. Vitor's a red fighter jet with lasers and missiles.

Vitor, Tracto, and Borr could combine into a powerful humanoid robot called Xenon, or merge with Servo - becoming the Samurai Synchro. Drago could transform into a mechanized Dragon, or combine with Servo - becoming the Samurai Phormo.

The series personifies computer viruses. Giving them monstrous appearances, and in some cases having them do things that are physically impossible. However many of the viruses do things that are technologically possible, and they give dramatic examples of how dangerously dependent on computers society is. Phones, Police Records, Climate Controls, Shipping Systems, The Time Directory, Bank Accounts, Water Treatments Systems, Military Systems, Power Plants, Scholastic Records, and Smog Control Systems. All are completely controlled by computers.

The DVD set includes the 3-part origin story and 25 other episodes. It's great to have the Syber Squad back.",1420329600,,1830,5.2320819112627985

5467837,4,B00AQ590FK,"OK, this is one more american adaptation for a japanese serie. This time they transformed Gridman into Superhuman Samurai. In fact, the serie got really cool for a low budget production.
You'll get a lot of fun watching it on a decent sound and image quality, with a cool menu and etc.

I just think the dvd's should not come on papersleeve cases, i'm used to get dvd-boxes with places to attach them properly...but whatever, the series and the DVD production stills pretty ok.",1381968000,2,477,4.678571428571429
5467838,5,B00AQ590FK,"Superhuman Samurai Syber Squad sees Matt Lawrence in arguably the best role he ever had, fighting digital Megavirus Monsters created by... Tim Curry?!  It doesn't get any better than that.  Give this show a chance for a true feeling of the care-free 90's at their best.  If you were born between 1984 and 1988, this is a must-have.  If not, it's something worth seeing as a portrait of what early 90's ""computers"" were all about in a predominately pre-internet world.  It makes Power Rangers look timeless!  I highly recommend picking this up for a good laugh and some legitimately (okay, maybe not ""legitimately"") good storytelling.  Grab the DVD set, pour yourself a bowl of cereal and travel back in time.",1380585600,5,708,4.85

I hope its not too late. If you WERE a fan and you wanna see it again, Just pick up this set. at this price, You cant afford not to. PLUS You can help us bigger fans complete our collection. I wrote letters to Buena Vista as a kid asking them to release more on VHS back in the 90s. But here we are its on DVD.

Wish i could get my hands on the Rockin Metal tracks that played through this series.
My faves are the ones you here through the Battles against SKORN [His masters Voice],

I liked:
Electric Warrior
Protecting the Real World
Isn't it Shocking?

Some of my faves. The band or Bands who made those songs so memorable shoudl step forward. I would so pay for those works.

8555941,5,B00AQ590FK,"I really liked this show when I was young and it was originally on the air. I remembered it fondly. I almost didn't rewatch it because I did not want to ruin those memories and often shows do not hold up to nostalgia.

Luckily, I did. This was a fun show. It is well executed. Like Power Rangers, this American show merges action sequences from a Japanese show to mesh with American teenage actors. However, I have the unpopular opinion of thinking that Superhuman Samurai did it better. One of my gripes with both American and Japanese super sentai shows is that toppled buildings often go unnoticed. I hate that in most superhero shows. If a monster and a robot are fighting and topple a building it should be noticed. Only intermittently did anyone in Power Rangers seem to deal with that. Luckily, Superhuman Samurai places the Japanese fight footage inside of a computer system. It makes more sense why it goes unnoticed.

Still, like many kid focused shows you have to over look some illogical story elements. Apparently the local high school only has about three rooms. Some of the jokes are lame. Most are still funny.

I like that it feels dated. I love that this show shows the misunderstanding of how computers and internet work. That is not a negative but a nice setting detail.

This show is not for everyone but clearly, after all these years it is still for me.",1506470400,,1376,4.604081632653061
8555942,4,B00AQ590FK,"I bought this for nostalgia. I used to watch it everyday before school. It's definitely worse than I remember it, but it's not a bad show. The first few episodes were weak, but there is a continuous storyline that is not just monster of the week. For it's time, the battles were actually pretty well done. Some of the Kilokahn logic progressions didn't make sense to me, especially since he is suppose to be a program. Overall, this is now a guilty pleasure of mine.
