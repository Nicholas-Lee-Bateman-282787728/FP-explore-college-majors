8183788,4,B000O77L2Y,"I have seen Deicide live once without impressing me.  The most annoying thing was Glen Benton monologue between each song... Sad to say but Deicide frontman is an idiot.

Thankfully, this low production live was edited to remove the non-stop Benton verbiage... That make the DVD watchable and enjoyable.",1391731200,,303,5.163265306122449
8183789,2,B000O77L2Y,"I don't know what those of you who are saying this has great sound and production have been watching, but to my eyes and ears, this is one of the worst professionally released concert dvds I have ever seen.  The video quality is very grainy, with many far away shots, and shaky closeups.  It's almost as if it was made to look like an audience filmed bootleg.  If this were an audience shot, unofficial bootleg, I would be praising the video and audio quality, as it would be quite an achievement, given those circumstances.  However, for a professionally recorded and released dvd, the quality is below average and very lackluster.  As for the audio, there are no choices for different audio settings, and the audio we do get is very muddy (again, like that of a bootleg).  As one other reviewer pointed out, there are glitches in the sound (blips and skips that sound like a poorly ripped audio cd).  The show itself is excellent, and the band puts on an awesome performance.  If I were to base my rating on the show alone, I would have probably given it at least 4 stars, but due to the poor production, I cannot.  If you want an excellent quality live Deicide dvd, I would highly recommend either When London Burns, or the dvd that comes with the Earache Classics reissue of Scars of the Crucifix (featuring the original lineup).  The former is the best, in my opinion.  I had gotten When London Burns for Christmas the year it was released and loved it.  I was expecting more of the same with this release, but was sorely disappointed.  Overall, I would only recommend this dvd only if you already have the aforementioned other releases and can accept a bootleg quality release sold as a professional quality release.",1240444800,,1722,4.60655737704918
8183790,3,B000O77L2Y,"This DVD feels shummy in production, but Deicide step it up enough to still warrant a watch, or maybe even purchase.

What first struck me here was the camerawork - a distant ""bystander""-camera mixed with a few shaky closeups, that's probably the biggest letdown of the show. The audio felt a little muffled at first, but it actually picks up after a while. There were a few glitches here and there, not sure if its just my disc, but the concert was watchable overall (the ""Homage""-video was off the entire time though). I have to say production-wise overall, it's a disappointment.

The first three or four songs are run through so damn fast you'll hardly be able to distinguish them from one another. But after that it's a pretty satisfying, all-around brutal show. Pretty much the whole thing is a vicious attack, and the band keep up the relentless pace, throwing in plenty of skillful drumming and melodic guitar. I could mention a lot of great songs here, but the highlight would be ""Walking With the Devil in Dreams You Behold"", which is just an excellent driving mixture of guitar, mid-pace, and a bit of great growling vocals that are especially nicely structured.

I can't say for sure, but if you're doubtful,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-London-Burns/dp/B000ECX088/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When London Burns</a>&nbsp;might be a better option than this one (at least production wise). But it's safe to say Deicide can bring a kickass show.",1236384000,,1503,5.2803347280334725
8183791,5,B000O77L2Y,"I really hated the Hoffman's leaving and expected the worst when I got ""The Stench of Redemption"". I was blown away at how technical and melodic Jack and Ralph contributed. I still like the chaotic Hoffman riffs and scales, but this concert was awesome! Jack Owen made it look easy. Glen Benton was on point, too bad there wasn't two of him for both sets of vocals. The sound and quality are really well done. Plus, there was a huge selection of songs spanning all the albums. I highly recomend this to anybody that likes Deicide or fast extreme metal. Honestly, it was like a different kind of Deicide, but worth every penny.",1186790400,6,626,4.548672566371682
8183792,5,B000O77L2Y,"In this DVD you get exactly what you want, Deicide in Concert! The production values are very good and the sound is excellent.  While other bands such as Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer have changed their sound, sold out, and gone mainstream Glen and crew still prove that they are the kings of extreme metal.  This dvd also contains two music videos and interiews with the band members.  I highly recommend for all fans of Deicide.",1180137600,4,432,4.733333333333333
8183793,5,B000O77L2Y,Deicide is one of the best death metal bands on the planet. This dvd will not dissapoint any Deicide fan out there. It is for sure a must buy. I wish tho they would have added the Scars of the Crucifix video on it along with the Homage for Satan video and Desecration video which are included on the dvd. I believe those are there only videos but I am not sure.,1179792000,3,361,4.027777777777778
