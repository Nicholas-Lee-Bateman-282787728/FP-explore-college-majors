4933908,5,B0062RY3Z8,"Such a sad story. I really do believe that something happend to her that caused her to not know what she was doing. I mean really, the police and others wants us all to believe that she was just sitting behind the wheel , with her whole life in the car with her, and was just chungen the liquor down...Drank more than an everyday drinker would in such a short time..Pay attention to the time frames...in 20 min, she went from fine, talking to the sister in law on the phone, to driving all crazy...Dose not make sense...",1362441600,7,520,4.316326530612245
4933909,5,B0062RY3Z8,This documentary shows the ripple effect of drinking and driving on others. We are all affected when a tragedy of this scale takes place. Aunt Diane's behavior is examined throughout the film. Her family is in denial of the accident and is convinced she must have been ill to cause such an accident. Diane's autopsy reveals she was well over the legal limit for alcohol use. This is a film I show in my first time offenders DUI class but I recommend it for all. The impact of this film stays with the viewer for a long time.,1350691200,14,524,4.357142857142857
4933910,3,B0062RY3Z8,"The true mystery to me is the behavior of Daniel Schuler and his sister in law Jay. Quite frankly, I find Daniel a most unlikeable person. He complains about the burdens of ""doing everything on his own"" and ""being a single parent"", and in the next shot his sister in law Jay, who watches Bryan in the afternoons and evenings, tells us that he has the whole day off and still complains. He never mentions his deceased daughter at all, and the thing that seems to distress him most, judging by his behavior, is that he misses his late wife's $100,000 yearly paycheck.
Jay declares that as far as she knew, Diane only smoked pot very occasionally, at bedtime to help her sleep. Then Jay lights up a cigarette for the camera and says with a little chuckle that no one knows she smokes. Hmm.
While Bryan pages through the special photo album Daddy made for him, there is a photo of his deceased sister Erin holding a beer bottle. Nice.
Then, these two sit at a table with Dr. Werner Spitz, one of the most respected forensic pathologist of his time, and after he kindly explains to them that he finds the pathology reports on Diane to be correct, they ask him with straight faces if he feels there may have been a mistake and if they should have her body exhumed. He looks at them as if to say, ""You're kidding, right?""
Most telling of all, at the end of the movie, Bryan and Daniel walk along together in what is supposed to be a warm father son moment, but when Daniel reaches for Bryan's hand, his son swats it away.
There is no justification for what Diane Schuler did, whatever her reasons were, or whatever happened. But all I am sensing from the Schuler family is a truckload of guilt, and a king size case of denial.
My heart goes out to the Hances, the Bastardis, the Longos, and to Bryan Schuler.",1332720000,242,1801,4.37910447761194
4933911,3,B0062RY3Z8,"Aunt Diane unfolds the events of that summer day in a heartbreakingly patient fashion that makes the accident itself feel like a persistent impending weight. (Showing photos from the scene was doubtless controversial, but the way the film is set up, we have to be there at the end.) But the facts presented at the time are still uncontroverted and when the final credits roll we still don't know much about what possessed a woman with five kids in her van to get so drunk and stoned and that she drove the wrong way on a New York parkway -- killing herself and seven others. It's sometimes hard to tell where Garbus was going. Why devote time to former friends who were no longer close to Diane? Why explore Diane's estrangement from her mother? Why spend time pinning down a private investigator on what seem like housekeeping issues? And why doesn't she explore the migraine angle -- a logical inference from the surviving son's description of Schuler's behavior? If Garbus had a theory, she might have let us in on it!",1329350400,11,1021,4.6464088397790055
4933912,5,B0062RY3Z8,"This documentary uses 911 calls, interviews with family members and police, and security camera footage to reconstruct the events leading up the tragic car accident which killed eight people in two cars including Diane, the driver.

As the story unfolds, we realize that this story is less about a mystery and more about the power of denial.  Diane's husband and sister insist that while she drank ""sometimes,"" she ""would never do that when she had to drive.""  We learn that yes, she smoked pot from time to time, ""when the laundry was folded and put away and the kids were asleep, never when she was with the kids....it was mainly to get her a good night's sleep...""

Before the accident, Diane is seen on a convenience store security camera wandering around before returning to her car packed with children- was she trying to buy medication for a migraine?  We'll never know.  What we do know is that the blood tests taken on her after the accident reveal elevated alcohol and marijuana levels.  Diane's relatives don't believe the report- must be some mistake.  So they demand a retest, which reveals the same thing.  They still don't believe it- ""what are we supposed to do now?""  They meet with an expert on the subject- ""could the tests be flawed, could it be the result of a stroke from an abscessed tooth?""  No.  ""Should we dig up her body and have her tested again?""

By the end of the documentary, we realize that Diane's family will simply not be convinced that Diane was in any way responsible for the accident, which occurred after Diane drove her minivan 1.7 miles at 70 MPH in the wrong direction, in the fast lane, in almost straight line, before colliding with another car (and killing everyone in that other car.)  We realize that if Diane had left a notarized suicide note, a videotaped confession, and 80 empty bottle of whiskey had been discovered scattered around the back seat, her family would probably feel exactly the same way.

I'm not condemning the family- they didn't kill anyone.  They didn't force Diane to drink or smoke pot before climbing into a minivan filled with kids.  But I wonder how much of this sad denial existed before the accident, and if a little more clarity and acceptance might have been more useful to Diane than ""oh well, she only drinks and smokes pot on rare occasions."" I wonder if this almost pathological refusal to accept the truth is a thin mask for the guilt felt by Diane's family- no, We could not have done Anything, because Nothing Was Wrong.

I'm reminded of people who will not accept that a family member has committed a horrible crime despite the evidence, or the family of a murder victim who are convinced that the guy in custody MUST be guilty, because it's not possible to live without some level of closure.  Diane needed help but didn't get it.  Diane's family needs help too- and I'm not sure this documentary will give them any comfort, because they don't seem to really want it.

Great documentary, but it's not a mystery.",1324425600,326,2999,4.663498098859316
4933913,5,B0062RY3Z8,"This was a very haunting view of a terrible accident which killed eight people.  The film showed how the family was affected, particularly Diane's husband and sister-in-law.  Denial seems to be the reaction of all, at least at first, based on their intimate knowledge of Diane.

I am familiar with the area of the accident, having lived close to the Pleasantville Rd/ Taconic Parkway intersection for years.  I don't believe anyone had ever made that type of mistake before, but I agree it really should not be as easy as it is to get on the wrong way, if that is what Diane did - unless she made some kind of u-turn across the divider further north.  Nevertheless, it is extremely gripping to see how the family and surviving son must deal with what happened as a result of that fateful driving catastrophe.

The video sequencing was good, and I thought the view of the camp where they were the previous weekend was helpful as I was not sure when I read about it in the paper what exactly they were talking about.",1323302400,6,1014,4.5136612021857925
4933914,4,B0062RY3Z8,"This was something I didn't expect to watch to completion, but it drew me in. You have a family who believes that they know Diane intimately and cannot reconcile what happened on that parkway. And perhaps they're right. Money can only go so far though, and their resources are limited. I applaud both Jay and Danny in their perseverance - I would want to know as well. All in all, I'm undecided, and would like a more in depth investigation of Diane Schuler's mental and physical state prior to the accident.",1521936000,,508,4.593406593406593
4933915,4,B0062RY3Z8,I happened to be on the Teconic Parkway that day. I was driving upstate to pick up my son at a friend's house.  Just south of where this accident happened all traffic just came to a dead stop. I couldn't see what was going on but later I found out i was only one exit away from this. I was able to inch my way up to the next exit and then re-enter the parkway further up. But I didn't find out what the traffic backup was from until I saw it on the news that night. I've often thought if I had left earlier or been driving faster the car she hit could have been me. A sad sad story. The families will be dealing with the repercussions of this for the rest of their lives.,1521417600,,671,3.897810218978102
4933916,5,B0062RY3Z8,"Great documentary about a very sad case. FYI- there are some extremely graphic crime scene photos so be prepared.

The guys over at True Crime Garage podcast recommended this documentary- I watched it and, although its such a sad story and we will never know the truth, it was informative and interesting to watch. I have to say that I believe she had some sort of medical event happen and she mistakingly grabbed the vodka and chugged- maybe thinking it was water. Who knows what her state of mind was at the time. It's just sad so many people lost their lives that day.",1517961600,,571,4.490384615384615
4933917,2,B0062RY3Z8,"did jointed and biased .. this film reveals less about the ""why"" of the events of the day leading up to the accident . Touches briefly on the other victims killed (Bastardi, Longo) who are rightfully angry at what transpired in the investigative stage(s) or rather, lack thereof .. I believe the accounts and interviews in this movie are about antiquated truths, and that the toxicology reports are accurate (Twice !) and this was a senseless, negligent murder of 7 individuals by a closet addicted person who was holding on, white knuckle, to the perceived appearances she felt she must keep up to the rest of the world .. we all hav our foibles and our stories .. but at the risk of driving with FOUR kids in the vehicle, theres just no excuses . She should hav pulled over, stayed where she was, something. Anything . Now how many lives and families are affected and this smokescreen-movie perpetuates the denial of the family, who probably went to these lengths to 1.) salve their guilt and 2.) avoid more huge lawsuit(s) than got filed against them already .. (IDT theres a Statute of Limitns on murder/Negligent Homicide) . Fast forward to still-the-lip-service of this denial, and viola' .. Hollywood will make us a movie .. lets do that ! Show a few dead corpse pictures, and sheesh yes that's our girl we love and believe in so much .. I WOULD NEVER ALLOW PICS OF MY DAUGHTER LIKE THAT ! SHAME ON YOU !",1517529600,,1411,4.559055118110236
4933918,2,B0062RY3Z8,"Heartbreaking story but there were no answers given at all.  This doco was a total waste of my time and in my opinion did nothing but exploit this horrible tragedy and had nothing to reveal..  Diane was drunk and stoned, her husband will never know why.  I can't imagine dealing with the level of emotional stress and feelings of guilt for what his wife was responsible for. I pray that he can stop this non-sensie and move on.  She was impaired, does it really matter why?  Will it make anything better? No.  Terrible doco with nothing to reveal, nothing new to say.",1517270400,,567,4.509803921568627
4933919,5,B0062RY3Z8,Heartbreaking story.  Goes to show you the length that family will go to try and protect one another.,1517011200,,101,4.611111111111111
4933920,3,B0062RY3Z8,terribly disappointing.  this certainly was a terrible tragedy.  but it was just painful to watch.  Maybe I just expected too much of a definite resolution by the end of the film. Its certainly showed how survivors deal with grief in different ways,1516320000,,248,4.857142857142857
4933921,4,B0062RY3Z8,"Good documentary which shows the family members in complete denial about the accident and most likely, Diane's addiction, typical of addicts and their enablers. Thou doth protest too much is the feeling I get from watching this.",1516233600,,228,5.1891891891891895
4933922,5,B0062RY3Z8,"I feel sickened and disturbed by this excellent documentary--investigative journalism that will stay with me for a long time--because the veneer of denial and lies is so real that it brought up images of all the closet alcoholics and drug addicts I've known. The answer, the truth, is in the dialogue: Diane was a private person (what female best friends DON'T talk about their marriages?); Diane was secretive, controlling, suffered early loss, smoked pot, drank, and acted a part that covered what was really going on inside. Perhaps the husband knew; more likely he was in denial too--drinking and smoking right along with his wife. All those kids, screaming, whining, tugging at her with their neediness, a woman whose own mother abandoned her. Diane was certainly a maintenance alcoholic and drug addict. Her family and friends enabled her with their denial and avoided prosecution with their lies.",1515801600,2,903,5.149659863945578
8491443,5,B0062RY3Z8,"An excellent documentary.  The forensic evidence is overwhelming.....she should not have been driving that car.  There should be adaptable technology that would have turned that car off once she entered the wrong way lane..... or, perhaps, something as simple as iron spikes that slant and cut tires of vehicles that enter in the wrong direction yet permits cars that are using the lane correctly to glide over them and not retain any damage.....",1529107200,,446,5.095890410958904
8491444,4,B0062RY3Z8,"Diane is the perfect example of a rabid control freak, a victim of untreated childhood trauma and abandonment. Everything has to appear perfect in every way lest we find weakness. Her easily controlled dishrag of a husband is typical  of this sort of family dynamic. As she feared, when she did loose control which was of course inevitable, it was in a big way that lead to this tragedy.",1529020800,,387,4.608695652173913
8491445,4,B0062RY3Z8,"What's wrong with Aunt Diane? Well, she's a damned drunk, that's what's wrong with her---and it's why she killed herself and seven innocent people. I give this video four stars because it's an intriguing documentary of a troubled yet successful woman with a difficult past: a psychological portrait. Kudos to the film maker for her objectivity and restraint. That said, I could barely stand to watch Diane's family sputter their fumbling and pathetic excuses---""the bottle of vodka was used for the pina coladas they all drank at the campground"". Right---and I'm the reincarnation of Queen Victoria. Give me a freaking break!  Yeah, I guess I sound like Dr. Phil today---but really. Wake up. It's a case of Occam's Razor here, folks.",1526947200,,733,5.0578512396694215
8491446,5,B0062RY3Z8,"Tragic.  It seems obvious that the lady was most likely  a high-functioning, secret alcoholic. For her to have that much alcohol in her bloodstream and still be looking normal, able to walk into a gas station without stumbling, shows she probably had years of drinking that heavily so her body is used to it. The family is in denial. While there are medical issues that might put alcohol in the blood (some people digest sugars into alcohol, it's rare, and likely would have been known before she reached that age), there aren't medical issues that put THC in the blood.

How could she drink so much and smoke pot in a campsite without anyone noticing, though?  Did she wait until they left to do it? And why did she not smell of alcohol or look drunk to anyone?  Did she go all weekend without a drink and then stop somewhere and chug?  Her mom did abandon her when she was little, so maybe she had unaddressed emotional issues...

She smoked DURING THE TRIP.  Oh, sure, ""On a rare occasion, she would, but not this time...""  Sure.  She smokes pot sometimes, but she didn't do it on the day THC was in her blood.  Denial.  Her husband and sister-in-law are in denial.  And an, her husband is a piece of work, bemoaning how hard his life as a working single dad is while his sister raises his son for six days a week.  Saying he never wanted to have kids and Diane was supposed to be the one raising the kids.  Wow.

(Oh, just read an article saying that her hubby did eventually admit they had been drinking that weekend...he knows full well what happened, he just doesn't want to admit it.)  It's a really well-done documentary.",1526601600,,1630,4.452702702702703
8491447,3,B0062RY3Z8,"The family of Diane Schuler search for supposed information to clear her of wrong doing in the death of her children and those of her brother.  The husband and sister-in-law (pronounced sister-in-lar) cannot wrap their minds around the fact that there was enough alcohol in her system to be considered intoxicated.  She also registered as having had marijuana in system.  Needless to say, these two ran around trying to convince everyone that a toothache killed her.",1526256000,,466,5.105263157894737
8491448,5,B0062RY3Z8,So very sad and tragic. This woman was obviously hiding a drinking problem. I hope the family can recover.,1525824000,,106,4.631578947368421
8491449,3,B0062RY3Z8,"Wow. The dad completely ignores his son and admits he never wanted kids and they were ""Diane's thing"". This woman was obviously drunk and murdered eight people, and her family is in complete denial.",1525478400,,198,4.852941176470588
8491450,4,B0062RY3Z8,This documentary still haunts me to this day after watching it almost 2 years ago. Very chilling story that leaves more questions that we'll never have the answers to.
