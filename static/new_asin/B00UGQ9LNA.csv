8706399,5,B00UGQ9LNA,"Charlie Wilson's War, 2008 film

The film begins with the silhouette of a man who launches a rocket towards the camera. [Symbolism?] Next we see a meeting at the CIA where ""Charlie Did It"". [Or did he?] Congressman Charles Wilson gets an award. ""This is based on a true story"". [It is not a true story in itself.] In April 1980 some people are bathing in a small pool. Dan Rather is on the TV news, the talk is about falling dominoes. Is the Free World doomed unless the Afghan people can defeat the foreign invaders? Charles Wilson must return to Washington DC for an important vote. We learn about his servants and supplicants who want his influence. Wilson will be placed on the ethics committee, he wants something in return. Charlie has all women working in his office. Is he a typical Congressman? Joanna calls him at night.

A CIA agent complains about his assignment. Does Gus lack diplomatic skills? Not so you'd notice. Gus talks about his work over lunch. Joanna wants to use Charlie's influence. Why does Congress say one thing and do another? [Is it to fool most voters?] Joanna reviews past imperial actions. She has powerful contacts and influence. [Or is she being used by others?] Russian helicopters attack the ground like some kind of invaders from another world. Charlie meets President Zia of Pakistan, he wants guns and money and control. ""Go to Peshawar to see the refugee camps."" Planting toy mines is part of a diabolical plot. The land there is dry and barren. Charlie gets a briefing about Pakistan. ""It would draw attention."" The local CIA agent must follow orders.

Charlie tells about small town life in Texas, and how he became interested in politics. Gus is sent to see Charlie. There is sudden bad news, a scandal about sex and drugs in Congress. [Is this to put pressure on Charlie?] Charlie gets a report on arms. They need plausible denial. Congress doesn't know what its voting on! Charlie's district wants only two things: their guns and low taxes. There is a man in Israel who can help get Russian arms to Pakistan. Can a belly dancer help in diplomatic maneuvers? President Zia agrees to the trade. Was Joanna saved by religion? Charlie talks to another Congressman, Doc Long, who needs a deal. The Congressman makes a speech to the Afghans, and gets cheers. [What was the translation?] Arms like anti-tank missiles are transported into Afghanistan. `Stinger' missiles can destroy helicopters in the air. Afghanistan becomes the first country to defeat the Russian Army. So what will the Afghans do in the future? ""We'll see."" Does anyone in Washington care afterwards?

This is a very clever and cynical film that reveals the personalities of the actors behind the scenes in Washington, an expos that doesn't preach. Who is in the Dept. of Agriculture building? This story is well edited and fast-paced as it glides over the background. One Congressman can get elected because of financial support from far outside his district. Do they also knock over any challengers? Fund are doubled or increased ten-fold without any oversight. Do other Congressmen keep a harem in their office? I wonder if these women are asked to provide companionship to other officials? Great Britain lost two wars in the 1870s to conquer Afghanistan and control opium production. No mention of this cash crop in this film. One effect of the Soviet intervention in 1979 was to break up the estates of the big landowners. People raised food rather than opium; this caused a shortage. Who is profiting from the opium crop today? Bankers in Houston?",1516579200,,3562,4.834426229508197
