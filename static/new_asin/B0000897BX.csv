POS Amazon was great it did not come with the book  so they did not charge me. I think I still wasted my time. crap.,1296086400,2,278,3.6
8715841,2,B0000897BX,"This is not something to buy if you want to learn how to play bass. The DVD lasts for about 10 minutes and it is simply an interview with three teenagers who try to persuade you how you should play bass if you want to get into music. The commputer CD that comes with it is geared towards absolute beginner, and tailored to kids. The best think in the whole set is the little booklet that has the scales in it, but that's about it. This may be a nice gift to a 13-year old, but skip it if you're an adult or if you already know what a string or a note is.",1103328000,36,554,3.8684210526315788
