3005886,5,B000XSKDFQ,This is a great introduction to basic yoga moves broken up into 20 minute segments. I love Sara Ivanhoe's easy-going style and the fact that she really encourages you to only do what you can safely do.,1237507200,4,201,4.45945945945946
3005887,5,B000XSKDFQ,This is my first Sarah Ivanhoe DVD. She is fun and gives great instruction. They are great workouts and there are several on this DVD. I'll definitely be buying more of her DVDs.,1236902400,3,178,4.424242424242424
3005888,5,B000XSKDFQ,These 2 DVDs have 5 short (and 1 longer)workouts.  Great as add ons.  Beginner/ Intermediate level.  Lots of variety here.  Intructor is very pleasant.  Scenery is beautiful.,1235952000,8,174,5.296296296296297
3005889,4,B000XSKDFQ,"i bought this dvd wanting more of sara ivanhoe. i think she is a great instructor and explains things very well. i was a little disappointed with the fact that this dvd is just a compilation of her 20 minute workout series. i already owned 2 of those dvds and i guess that was the disappointing part. the bonus on the ball segment was nice, it is 45 minutes in length and i enjoyed it. all in all this is a perfect dvd for those wishing to own the 20 minute body makeover set and it is so much cheaper. but i wish i would've known. anyway, i use this disc and i do enjoy it.",1233187200,29,574,3.956896551724138
3005890,5,B000XSKDFQ,"Sara Ivanhoe's new DVD series, Yoga Target Zone Body Makeover, is essentially her 20-minute Yoga Makeover 5-Volume Gift Set from Natural Journeys repackaged and includes, as a bonus, her On The Ball Yoga Workout. The whole series has been combined onto 2 discs, as opposed to 6, and is a real deal for the price can't be beat.

Filmed on a gorgeous location in Hawaii, Sara takes you through a series of five different programmes that focus on different elements of fitness and target specific body parts: buns and thighs; flat abs; weight loss; toning with light weights; and power yoga.  Sara doesn't waste a minute of time in each compact but complete 20-minute practice.

If you already own the previous gift set, as I do, I would recommend passing on this set.  If you are unfamiliar with Sara, or are looking for a nice way to begin a yoga practice without having to commit too much time in a day, this is a great place to start.  She has a pleasant and friendly personality but she's not a cheer leader.  She does, however, know her stuff and is as encouraging as a video yoga instructor can be.  I would highly recommend this series to anyone interested in looking for a gentle and simple introduction to yoga or to the intermediate practitioner looking for a quick yoga practice on days when time is short.

Another Natural Journeys yoga DVD I would highly recommend:  Hemalaya Behl's Yoga For Urban Living.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hemalaya-Behl-Yoga-for-Urban-Living/dp/B00009W0VH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hemalaya Behl: Yoga for Urban Living</a>",1226793600,63,1609,5.229571984435798
3005891,5,B000XSKDFQ,"I love everything Sara Ivanhoe does. If you're not familiar with her she's very ""normal""  no talk of traveling to India, or how Yoga is her life.  Her workouts would be comparable to Denise Austin, however I'm more partial to Sara's personality.

I have been working out regularly for years, doing Yoga intermittently.
Typically I wouldn't want a 20 minute Yoga class.  I've always done classes that were a minimum of an hour.  However it's very easy to put a couple of the workouts together without too much repetition.

Each segment is pretty fast paced. The set is beautiful.  It looks like they are on one of the beaches in Southern California, however they are in the grassy area but you still see the water in the background.

As with her other videos, Sara gives you good pointers without too much detail.  None of the poses are too advanced, but there is enough variety that even an intermediate person wouldn't be bored.  You move very quickly from pose to pose.  The point of these workouts is not to hold the poses but to keep moving to keep your heartrate up.

The workout with weights really isn't going to tone the individual muscle groups unless you're totally out of shape, but the weight gives you enough added resistance to feel like you've got a good workout after 20 minutes.

The bonus workout on the ball is fantastic.  It's much longer and is more of a full body workout.  ( By the way, this is the same workouts that are sold individually or as a boxed set.. they are titled differently, and promoted for losing weight.  The background on the box/covers is white.  This is just a better deal because they are all combined here in one two DVD set at a lower price with the added bonus workout.)",1221955200,116,1717,4.54071661237785
3005892,5,B000XSKDFQ,"This is a great work out DVD.  I enjoy Sara Ivanhoe as a yoga instructor & have a couple of her DVDs.  This one has 2 discs with 6 different  20 minute workouts that are targeted towards different sections of the body.  I like that if I'm pressed for time or not really feeling like exercising I can pop this in and do a quick 20 minute segment but still feel like I got a decent work out.  Or if I'm feeling like a more vigourous work out I'll do a couple of these work outs or include one with other exercises.  You get a nice mix of yoga with some more pilates type work too for the core.  The workouts are easy to follow but don't get boring after you've done them multiple times.  I can't stand when work out & yoga DVDs move too quick and don't give me time to get into the pose or feel the effects, this one does not do that but it does not drag on either.  The On the Ball Yoga bonus section is a little longer (I think) but really gives you a good toning work out.  I found the ball work to be good for opening my hips too.",1456012800,,1032,3.8947368421052633

3005895,5,B000XSKDFQ,"I love this DVD. My husband and I are both beginners to yoga. We started out doing a few of Sara's 15 minute yoga session on Hulu Plus and we decided we needed something a tiny bit more challenging. These videos are probably easy for people who already have some prior knowledge of yoga, but they are perfect for us.

I love all of the sessions on the first disk, Power Weight Loss, Core, and Weights. On the second desk, the Lower Body session was a little bit too easy for me. I haven't tried the Power Sweat or On the Ball yet.

I can feel my shoulders and arms getting stronger. I can tell my husband's back and core are toning up. It's great! I highly recommend it for anyone starting out.",1431561600,,694,4.2105263157894735

3005906,5,B000XSKDFQ,"Sara Ivanhoe is a top notch yoga instructor who is easy to follow.  She is great at encouraging each student to go their own pace while keeping up an easy and educational routine for experienced and novice practitioners.  She takes you a little beyond traditional yoga with ""Power Tone With Weights"" but that departure is subtle.  One only uses small weights, but they make it interesting.  I recommend any Ivanhoe class, especially if you are unsure if you will enjoy yoga.",1410307200,,474,4.814814814814815
3005907,4,B000XSKDFQ,I really enjoy this series. I have two small kids so if I can squeeze in a 20 minute workout I'm lucky.

3005909,5,B000XSKDFQ,This dvd is wonderful for someone with less than 30 minutes and beginner/moderate yoga experience. Sara Ivanhoe is the best yoga instructor to follow as she has a very pleasant voice and goes at a great pace with reminders to breathe.,1403222400,,234,4.7317073170731705
3005910,4,B000XSKDFQ,"I love these 6 workouts.  Each lasts for about 20 minutes.  To be clear, these aren't difficult and lengthy workouts.  But I don't always want a heart-pounding, hour-long routine.  How I use them is this.  Every morning, before going to work, I get up 20 minutes early and do one of these workouts.  They feel sooooo good to do.  They relax and stretch the body, while also working and toning the muscles.  Afterwards, I feel refreshed, alert, and ready to face the day.  And sometimes, if I've had a long day and want to stretch and relax a little, I'll do one of the workouts about an hour before going to sleep.  They are perfect for that.  And Sara is a sweetheart.  She never becomes annoying morning after morning.  I only wish that she would create another half-dozen 20 minute workouts!!",1393200000,,795,4.553191489361702

I got it to help with fibromyalgia and arthritis, as well as a workout to do in the winter. It truly helps with my health issues and I've never felt better. It also super-tones your legs, thighs and butt. I like the leg workout, power sweat, and power weight loss sessions. Do them every day or so and you'll really like the results. Working on breathing and calming exercises is a great stress release and honing in on the stillness and peace within. Great DVD.",1389484800,,565,4.4423076923076925

She shows you how to do easier poses and then shows you how to do harder poses that you may or may not be ready for. It's a good DVD for beginners, not so much for people who are advanced, but there aren't many videos. It's only 2 hours and I never use the power ball yoga because I don't have an exercise ball.

I used to do boring cardio and weight routines, but not anymore. This DVD is pretty much my only workout and I feel like I have more strength than ever before. These routines are very addicting.

3005921,4,B000XSKDFQ,"This DVD set includes a total of six previously released yoga practices:  five 20-minute routines that formed instructor Sara Ivanhoe's ""Yoga Makeover"" series, originally released in 2004, and a bonus workout which is a bit longer,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-on-the-Ball/dp/B00009W0VN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga on the Ball</a>.  I had previously reviewed all of the practices in the Yoga Makeover series, and so I have described each of them below.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Weight-Loss/dp/B00049QQP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Weight Loss</a>
This practice is well-suited to those who prefer greater movement in postures rather than holding static poses for a longer length of time.  Sara begins with a chair pose vinyasa, adding arm movement and a forward bend and linking the series with breath; this is followed by a standing backbend combined with forward bend series. Next comes a vinyasa that is repeated throughout the workout: you move from plank to cobra to down dog, again combining the series with breath. From a 3-legged down dog position, Sara leads you into several series of standing poses: she begins with triangle/revolved triangle, moves on to warrior/side angle pose/revolved side angle in the next series, and finishes with crescent lunge/revolved crescent lunge. She completes the plank-cobra-down dog vinyasa between each series, eventually substituting upward dog for cobra. Finally, the practice ends in a seated position with head-to-knee pose and a brief hand mudra.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flat-Abs/dp/B00049QQI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flat Abs</a>
Here Sara leads a challenging yoga practice aimed at strengthening your core abdominal muscles. She begins with standing side bends, adding a twist with a knee lift. Next comes some additional seated stretches with forward bends, twists, and spine rolls. Sara then moves to an all-fours position and leads some particularly challenging work moving from down dog to plank pose with one leg pulled in towards your chest. This is followed by some additional seated twists, including a twisting boat pose. Lying on your back, you'll then perform Pilates-like abs moves such as criss-cross, bicycle, and stretches with both bent and straight legs. You'll also perform a half sit up with the legs both bent and straight as well as side knee drops with the legs both bent and straight.  This is a tough, challenging practice which is likely to feel overwhelming for beginners.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sculpted-Buns-Thighs/dp/B00049QQLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sculpted Buns & Thighs</a>
This nice lower body practice does a good job of thoroughly stretching the legs and opening the hips. Sara begins the practice in a standing position with several variations of chair pose; each variation is held for a few breaths. She then moves on to a triangle-warrior series for strengthening the leg muscles followed by a temple pose (a plie squat)-fan pose (wide-legged standing forward bend) combo which really stretches the legs, especially the hamstrings. The practice then moves on to the floor for camel pose, first performed with one hand only on each side then both hands. Finally, there is a lunge-lunge twist-pigeon-cobbler series that is perfect for opening the hips, and Sara finishes the practice with a simple seated yoga mudra.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Power-Beauty-Sweat/dp/B00049QQL4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Power Beauty Sweat</a>
Here, Sara does not rely on a traditional series of sun salutations to build heat in the body; rather, she adds movement to standing postures to intensify. She begins in a seated position with a simple side stretch and twist, then moves to kneeling for a kneeling side stretch (gate pose) and side plank. From here, the practice evolves to standing postures, including fan pose, a standing twist, and chair--each pose is repeated with movement and then a twist to both sides. Balance work comes in the form of eagle pose, and then there is a series consisting of dog pose, lunge, runner's stretch, and cow (or bull) performed to both sides. Dolphin pose further strengthens the arm muscles, and finally, there is a lying hamstring stretch. As with all the practices in this series, Ivanhoe ends with a mudra for detoxification here.  Overall, this is a nice, short yoga routine for focusing on standing postures and stretching the spine and hips.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Total-Body-Tone-with-Weights/dp/B00049QQLO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Total Body Tone with Weights</a>
This feels like a yoga practice with some toning work thrown in. Sara begins the practice with a few brief stretches in a standing position then picks up the weights (she is using 2-lbs.). She leads you through some standing shoulder work in mountain, tree, and chair poses and ends the segment in eagle pose, which I found a bit awkward with the weights. Next comes a warrior series where you hold your legs in the warrior position while working your arms with bicep curls and flies. Sara also does side angle pose, using the weights in sort of a one-arm row to an overhead lift, which I felt was a nice shoulder opener.  Sara then moves to the floor with triceps/core balance work performed from a hands and knees position. Next comes bridge pose while ""bench pressing"" the weights; the second set is performed on one leg, which was particularly challenging. A few additional stretches bring the practice to an end right at 20 minutes.

Because Sara does not provide detailed instruction, I would not recommend any of these routines for those with no prior exposure to yoga.  However, many experienced beginners are likely to enjoy her calm, down-to-earth manner.",1373846400,2,5949,5.785142857142858
3005922,5,B000XSKDFQ,"I have purchased a few copies of this DVD because I have worn them out.  I have several yoga dvd's and a few by Sarah Ivanhoe.  I have used these 20 minute workout routines for over a year now and my body has become more defined, much more flexible and stronger.  You can make the workouts intense or easy.  It's up to you.

The routines are broken into segments which you can run all at once or short segments if you don't have the time all in one sitting. The sound and picture quality is very sharp and Sara's instructions come through very clearly. After I got used to the routines I could easily look away from the video and keep up with what was going on.

3005931,5,B000XSKDFQ,"The 5 stars supposedly speak for themselves, however, let me reiterate:  I LOVE THIS DVD!

 I was a little skeptical, at first.  I searched through Amazon looking for a yoga dvd that would fit my lifestyle.  I'm a college student, with limited time to devote to exercise no matter how much I'd like to.  So when I came across this product, with its already flourishing reviews (for the most part), and the allure of a supposed total body makeover within just 20 minutes a day, I was both excited and yet somewhat suspicious.  I looked around some more but found nothing that quite fit my needs as this DVD seemingly did and, anyway, nothing else had nearly as great a rating of 5 stars like this one.  So I bought it!

I was surprised at how ""easy"" it was to get into the routines. Though I've yet to try the routine using an exercise ball (again, college student, did you know those things run upwards of $30 at Target?!), I've tried everything else, and everything is VERY doable even for a yoga novice like myself (although I have dappled in yoga in the past, I was not particularly successful at it, so I still consider myself an amateur).  My favorite routine is definitely the Power Weight Loss.  It really does get you sweating if you're willing to push yourself in order to GET yourself sweating.  The Core Power workout, however, is probably tied for first too, though.  I really do feel like it has aided in my core development.  I've never particularly had, nor really wanted abs, but after doing the Core Power workout regularly these past 3 months I have noticed a significant difference (as have others) and I'm even beginning to make out a silhouette very much similar to Ivanhoe herself, which DEFINITELY pleases me.  All other routines are great as well, but I feel these two are my staples.

Now for what everybody wants to know, does it actually give you a TOTAL body makeover?

The answer, for me at least, is a confident and ecstatic YES!  To give you some context, I had been loosely dieting (that is, just eating healthily and not starving myself of any particular food group like some diets demand) for about 5 or 6 months prior to ordering this DVD which I ordered around mid-January 2012.  I had lost 15 pounds just eating healthily alone and sought to add some exercise to boost not only my health, but also, of course, my weight loss.  And it worked!  I weighed myself recently (I don't very often) and discovered I've lost yet ANOTHER 15 pounds.  I credit this very much to this dvd, which is the only exercise I've truly done the past 6 months other than walking to and from class on a daily basis (however, it's the summer now, and I'm still glad to report my weight loss has been maintained!).  I started out doing a routine, for 20 minutes, as advertised, every other day when convenient.  I've since boosted it to every other day plus additional days when I feel up to it, sometimes even doing two routines in a row if I have time (like I said, it's the summer now).  My legs are stronger, my body is more flexible, my core is starting to outline, and my arms are getting less and less flabbier (I credit this to plank pose and chaturunga!).  What's more, I FEEL healthier AND stronger AND satisfied with my body despite the fact that I've got, ideally, a little ways to go if I want the
""Ivanhoe"" physique.  This is the beauty of yoga, in my opinion, and it definitely applies to this DVD.  Without seeing dramatic results like some exercise routines promise (need I mention it, like ""Insanity""?), the gentle, rhythmic, though highly demanding practice, and ART, of yoga allows one to feel accomplished in not just one's bodily needs, but one's mentality as well.  This has definitely been a plus with this DVD as it was one of my lingering skepticisms as I began trying it-- would it give me the mental benefits as well, given that it only takes 20 minutes? The answer again is yes.  At the end of each routine, Ivanhoe runs you through a mudra that really does act as she promises.  I feel my body calming down to such an impressive degree that sometimes I run through mudras during the day when I feel particularly stressed.  They really do work!

So, over all, it should be clear:  I LOVE THIS DVD.  I really haven't needed to do anything else besides go through routines regularly and eat healthily (which yoga encourages intrinsically) and I've lost 15 additional pounds, 30 pounds over all in a year! Not a DRASTIC change, but, believe me, a highly noticeable change not only to myself but to my family and friends.  Though it may take time, it's highly worth it, because it's really easy to stick to!  The routines are fun, though challenging, and that's something most dvds and workout regimens can't guarantee.  In my opinion, this DVD really, truly is fun AND effective.  I can't wait to order more of Sara Ivanhoe's stuff!

If you choose to order it (which, obviously, I highly suggest you do), good luck and have a happy body makeover! (You will. ;))",1339977600,11,4998,4.540782122905028
3005932,4,B000XSKDFQ,"Yoga Body Makeover Series with Sarah Ivanhoe is a 2 disc set with three workouts on each disk.  The workouts are Power Weight Loss, Power Tone With Weights, Core Power, Lower Body Power, Power Sweat Detoxify, and On The Ball which is a bonus workout.  All workouts were originally issued separately.  With the exception of On The Ball, the workouts are 20 minutes each.  The On The Ball workout is about 40 minutes long.  Each of the workouts is high beginner or low intermediate level.

The Power Weight Loss workout is unlikely to help anyone lose weight, but it is a good short workout for flexibility and strength.  Power Tone With Weights uses 1 to 3 pound weights.  Core Power seems simple compared to other core workouts I have, but it's surprisingly effective.  Lower Body Power is my favorite and is definitely a good lower body stretch.  I have not yet tried Power Sweat Detoxify but I will.  I do not own a stability ball so I won't be using the On The Ball workout.

I enjoy Sarah Ivanhoe's approach to yoga instruction.  Her cueing is excellent and she is friendly and encouraging.  This is not pure yoga as Sarah incorporates some moves from Pilates and weight training.  While Sarah appears alone in each of these workouts she gives instruction on modifications.  I particularly like the way she tells you not to worry if you cannot stretch as far as she can - she tells you to keep a sense of humor on the balancing poses, and no one cares if you can get your head to your knees and similar comments.  In fact, I enjoy Sarah's thorough instruction and friendly manner so much I intend to purchase more of her yoga workouts.

My only complaint is that if you want to do more than one workout it is impossible to run them together.  You have to watch the exercise warning and the complete opening for each.  The disk will not allow you to fast forward though much of it.  In my mind, this significant annoyance was foreseeable and should have been addressed when Natural Journeys' decided to re-release these workouts as a compilation.",1339286400,2,2049,4.574175824175824

Don't make the mistake i did and bought both dvd's and later realized the redundancy.

A SIDE NOTE:
It can get really confusing buying exercise videos because they always come out with another version. And ive accidentally bought dvds I already owned because they might change the packaging and make me believe that its a new product.

Other than that, sara ivanhoe is awesome. Wonderful teacher and down-to-earth. She is great! I'd highly recommend it.",1334793600,2,695,4.864406779661017

I've been doing this routine every morning because its only 20 minutes- and I can already see a difference in my posture and core. She's fun, calming and with a price of $6.99, its totally worth it. I just light some incense and candles and I'm on my! The only reason I didn't give it 5 Stars was because there's 2 work outs that require a ball or strap or something which I don't own.

If you want something VERY easy, this is a nice DVD.  BEWARE if you have bad knees.  Mine aren't particularly bothersome, but she does A LOT of things on the knees.  Even if the DVD was faster paced or more challenging, I would not be a fan of this one for that reason. It is also a little annoying that the same intro and roughly the same ending (a tad too mystical for me) are on each segment.  She is a good instructor if you need clear cues.",1320537600,5,621,4.008130081300813

Great regardless of your fitness level, not too difficult, not too easy and there are basically six different routines including one that uses free weights and one that uses an exercise ball.

Sara the instructor is great, she's brief and to the point and does a great job of explaining the movements without a lot of fluff.

I originally purchased this to introduce a new yoga DVD into my collection, and it has a great selection of not so common poses which are not too difficult but very effective once practiced with regularity.

Do not pass this up.  I'll be looking for any other DVDs that she has out there!",1314316800,,717,4.476923076923077

3005950,5,B000XSKDFQ,"I've tried quite a few yoga videos including the Gaiam fitness DVDs.  I ran across Sara Ivanhoe on the series All Star Workouts on FitTV.  I immediately liked her because she uses normal language (saying things like ""give your leg a klunk forwards"") and her workouts are challenging enough for an intermediate (which is what I consider myself) but not too hard or complicated for a beginner.  I also have the Crunch yoga video she has out but I like this one because sometimes I am pressed for time and don't have a lot of time to work out but still want to do something.  They're not so challenging that I can't do the poses but not so easy that I don't feel like I've done nothing.  The On the Ball routine at the end is nice too because I had a fitness ball I wasn't using and it's a little longer workout for when I do have more tine.  It seemed easy enough while I was doing it but when I got done I felt it.  Personally I prefer Hatha/Vinyasa yoga to Kundalini yoga.  I've tried other videos and they're either too weird (chanting and other things I'm not comfortable with) or too challenging.  By far Sara Ivanhoe is my favorite yoga instructor.

I am a busy wife, mom, & Paramedic and have found myself needing to be in better shape.  My daughter got Wii fit for Christmas and I found that I liked how I felt even after doing the yoga moves on there.  So, I began searching for something more.  This was probably the best rated of any that I found and I now agree with them.  I feel that some of these moves are very challenging, BUT Sara goes through all in such a way that you can learn them easily. She also, gives the easy way and the challenging version for many of the moves.  I would recommend this to anyone that wants a good start to getting fit.  I already feel the difference and have only been doing this for about 10 days.  20 minutes goes by quickly believe it or not.  If your wondering buy this one!!!",1302307200,,895,4.097701149425287

3005958,5,B000XSKDFQ,"""Self-acceptance, in my opinion, is the highest practice in yoga.""  This enlightened philosophy permeates through Sara's courses.
The New York Times reported on research confirming that self-compassion leads to greater happiness and less anxiety, see ""Go Easy on Yourself, a New Wave of Research Urges"" on 2/28/11.  The logical implications if followed would mean that if we are more accepting of our own imperfections and mistakes and know that we are stretching to improve (sorry I couldn't resist), we would be more accepting, less afraid, less judgmental and less jealous of others.  ""If you fall down [during balance poses or life], just laugh at yourself and get right back up"".

These 20 minute videos are perfect for doing in the morning before work and they offer something different every day.  As Blaise Pascal wrote ""I made this letter longer than usual because I lack the time to make it shorter"".  One can tell that Sara crafted these  routines in a very precise and well balanced manner.  I have been practicing yoga for 14 years and I find Disk 1 to be a masterpiece, with a perfect synchronicity of breath and movement, downward dogs and upward dogs, warrior and reverse warrior, plank poses and more.
Yoga is not a competition.  As Sara says ""No one cares if you are all the way down.""  For beginners don't worry about getting the poses exactly right, just ""concentrate on breathing and moving together"".

One word of warning, it is nearly impossible to resume watching in-studio DVDs after using this series.  It was filmed in Hawaii with gorgeous views of sailboats, gentle crashing surf, palm trees swaying in the breeze, and the occasional bird or two hopping around the green grass in the background.  Life is simply better outdoors.  The video is expertly done using many different camera angles with nice transitions.  One downside is that you have to fast forward through the DVD introduction on each of the five workouts, as the chapter points do not match up.  As other reviewers have noted, Sara's style is very down to earth.  She really shines at the end of each practice when she thanks you for joining her.  Add it to your cart and when it arrives it may even bring a little smile to your face :)

The 1st one I ordered, and used so much got scratched, so I had to order a second one.  Amazon your profits are going up on me. :-)

That tells you how much I prefer this Yoda DVD.
Its the one I use most often.

I like the instructor.
I like the length of each of the segments. 20 minutes.
I like the quality of the scenes and most of all the instruction.

There are modifications at various points, and I don't feel guilty if I can't wrap my foot behind my head 3 times.
Sara is REAL.  While she looks like a model, she doesn't try to have you exercise like you're a model or have been doing yoga for 15 years.

For those who think its too short?  This is probably not the video for you and Sara clearly tells you this up front. She says if you only have 20 minutes, then this is the workout for you.  If your life permits you to have hours of yoga practicing time, then at least you've got options to combine the workarounds.  Its difficult to shorten a 1 hour DVD workout to 20 minutes. I've tried it disrupts the flow.

Sara obviously has worked with a lot of different people in different stages of their yoga fitness.  (read stiffness) And seems to know just what to tell me when I'm in that half moon pose about to fall over, or if my head will not go all the way to the floor on the straddle forward bend and tells me no one cares. That's what I need to hear.

So if you want a down to earth workout, with good instructions, and you can't put your nose on your toes, and your goal in life is not to be come a swami, this is the yoga DVD workout for you.

When my back yells out, ""... you haven't been exercising, get your butt to the mat"" this is the workout of choice, actually I just leave it in the DVD player. Saves time. I've only got 20 minutes!",1288310400,,1796,4.01123595505618

I love the variety that this DVD offers, and Sara is my favorite yoga person yet.  I started back up again (since before my second baby) last week (I did four of the workouts), and I've already lost two of those annoying pounds.

I get bored if I do the same video repeatedly, so I figured I would give it a try. I absolutely love it! Sarah is an excellent teacher, VERY easy to follow, very precise in what to do and how to do it. She knows just when to remind you to breathe and loosen the jaw (when it is getting tough!) and is a very comforting guide. It is a little like working out with a friend.

Pros:
1) excellent instruction in breathing and explaining the poses
2) 6 different workouts that each work a different part of the body - doesnt get boring too fast
3) not a whole lot of ""cosmic"" yoga - mostly focuses on the workout
4) workouts are only 20 minutes long, but you can easily go from one workout to another and change up the routine to keep it interesting.
5) great price!

Cons:
1)Workouts are too short to do just one. To get a full workout, you would have to do at least two of them.
2) You have to sit through the introduction at the beginning of every workout... cant just skip straight to the workout
3) The Abs workout isn't nearly as good as I was hoping...

The one thing I wish I could do would be to play 2 workouts back to back like the 10 minute solutions series allows.  The 20 minute workouts are convenient, sometimes I want it to be longer.  The ball routine would be great for beginners.  If you are new to yoga, don't expect to get everything right the first time.

My heartrate stays in the fat burning zone and I sweat while doing the weight loss workout.  I feel great afterwards!",1257897600,,248,4.590909090909091
3005975,5,B000XSKDFQ,"I've had time to practice every routine on this 2 DVD set and I love them all. As I'm an intermediate yoga practitioner, I initially thought these routines might be too easy, but this was not the case. Sara's instruction style is very relaxed, very easy to follow and the background music is not distracting. I have quite a few yoga DVDs and this set is definitely my favorite!",1255910400,,377,4.478260869565218
3005976,4,B000XSKDFQ,"My husband has seen me reap the benefits of practicing yoga over the years and though he is in fantastic shape he wanted to become more flexible and gain some of the relaxation and stretching benefits that yoga provides.

Together we tried the core yoga and the power weight loss segments and I tried the balance of the dvds alone.  Each segment, with the exception of the stability ball work out is 20 minutes.  The ball workout is about 45 minutes long.  The dvd is geared to beginner/intermediate, but I felt that it was much more heavily balanced toward the beginner end, so for my husband this was perfect.  Not a lot of time commitment, good instruction and good stretching with prayer twists, down-dogs, etc.  I found that a few of the workouts just didn't give me enough though, as I was used to doing more, so if you are above a beginner level you may find yourself a little bored. The core workout was nice with controlled movements that are much like pilates, which would be excellent for those trying to work with a minimum of time and want maximum benefits in toning their abs.

I enjoyed the 2nd disk the most, which covered power sweat, lower body power and on the ball yoga.  Power sweat was not as intense as it sounds though. The ball workout was an interesting twist and was a longer workout so I felt like that one was the one that I would do most often. I also liked the extra added core work you got as you had to keep yourself stable on the ball throughout the poses.

Sara's instruction is excellent and the settings are beautiful and calming.  I also like how at the end of each workout she includes a mudra, which is a hand gesture used in yoga and meditation as a way to ""seal your practice"".

Now that I have done this one, I would definitely like to try one of her intermediate workouts such as Yoga on the Edge.  She is a good instructor, with good form and cueing and keeps the workout positive and upbeat without being too chatty or over the top.

If you would like a little taste of yoga in short segments (nice if you are short on time or want to supplement your regular workout) this would be a good beginner series.  You can also do like I did and add several segments together to make a longer workout covering several of the workouts.  That's the best part-putting together what works for you!

Enjoy and be healthy!",1250294400,18,2354,4.389400921658986
3005977,5,B000XSKDFQ,I think that this is a great yoga workout for beginners and intermediates.  20 minutes make it perfect to add in to any day and there is an option to do all of the works at once as well.

3240387,5,B000XSKDFQ,"Sara Ivanhoe's new DVD series, Yoga Target Zone Body Makeover, is essentially her 20-minute Yoga Makeover 5-Volume Gift Set from Natural Journeys repackaged and includes, as a bonus, her On The Ball Yoga Workout. The whole series has been combined onto 2 discs, as opposed to 6, and is a real deal for the price can't be beat.

Filmed on a gorgeous location in Hawaii, Sara takes you through a series of five different programmes that focus on different elements of fitness and target specific body parts: buns and thighs; flat abs; weight loss; toning with light weights; and power yoga.  Sara doesn't waste a minute of time in each compact but complete 20-minute practice.

If you already own the previous gift set, as I do, I would recommend passing on this set.  If you are unfamiliar with Sara, or are looking for a nice way to begin a yoga practice without having to commit too much time in a day, this is a great place to start.  She has a pleasant and friendly personality but she's not a cheer leader.  She does, however, know her stuff and is as encouraging as a video yoga instructor can be.  I would highly recommend this series to anyone interested in looking for a gentle and simple introduction to yoga or to the intermediate practitioner looking for a quick yoga practice on days when time is short.

Another Natural Journeys yoga DVD I would highly recommend:  Hemalaya Behl's Yoga For Urban Living.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hemalaya-Behl-Yoga-for-Urban-Living/dp/B00009W0VH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hemalaya Behl: Yoga for Urban Living</a>",1226793600,63,1609,5.229571984435798
3240388,5,B000XSKDFQ,"I love everything Sara Ivanhoe does. If you're not familiar with her she's very ""normal""  no talk of traveling to India, or how Yoga is her life.  Her workouts would be comparable to Denise Austin, however I'm more partial to Sara's personality.

I have been working out regularly for years, doing Yoga intermittently.
Typically I wouldn't want a 20 minute Yoga class.  I've always done classes that were a minimum of an hour.  However it's very easy to put a couple of the workouts together without too much repetition.

Each segment is pretty fast paced. The set is beautiful.  It looks like they are on one of the beaches in Southern California, however they are in the grassy area but you still see the water in the background.

As with her other videos, Sara gives you good pointers without too much detail.  None of the poses are too advanced, but there is enough variety that even an intermediate person wouldn't be bored.  You move very quickly from pose to pose.  The point of these workouts is not to hold the poses but to keep moving to keep your heartrate up.

The workout with weights really isn't going to tone the individual muscle groups unless you're totally out of shape, but the weight gives you enough added resistance to feel like you've got a good workout after 20 minutes.

The bonus workout on the ball is fantastic.  It's much longer and is more of a full body workout.  ( By the way, this is the same workouts that are sold individually or as a boxed set.. they are titled differently, and promoted for losing weight.  The background on the box/covers is white.  This is just a better deal because they are all combined here in one two DVD set at a lower price with the added bonus workout.)",1221955200,116,1717,4.54071661237785

This one has 2 discs with 6 different  20 minute workouts that are targeted towards different sections of the body.  I like that if I'm pressed for time or not really feeling like exercising I can pop this in and do a quick 20 minute segment but still feel like I got a decent work out.  Or if I'm feeling like a more vigourous work out I'll do a couple of these work outs or include one with other exercises.  You get a nice mix of yoga with some more pilates type work too for the core.  The workouts are easy to follow but don't get boring after you've done them multiple times.  I can't stand when work out & yoga DVDs move too quick and don't give me time to get into the pose or feel the effects, this one does not do that but it does not drag on either.  The On the Ball Yoga bonus section is a little longer (I think) but really gives you a good toning work out.

These videos are probably easy for people who already have some prior knowledge of yoga, but they are perfect for us.

I love all of the sessions on the first disk, Power Weight Loss, Core, and Weights. On the second desk, the Lower Body session was a little bit too easy for me. I haven't tried the Power Sweat or On the Ball yet.

They feel sooooo good to do.  They relax and stretch the body, while also working and toning the muscles.  Afterwards, I feel refreshed, alert, and ready to face the day.  And sometimes, if I've had a long day and want to stretch and relax a little, I'll do one of the workouts about an hour before going to sleep.  They are perfect for that.  And Sara is a sweetheart.

3240418,4,B000XSKDFQ,"This DVD set includes a total of six previously released yoga practices:  five 20-minute routines that formed instructor Sara Ivanhoe's ""Yoga Makeover"" series, originally released in 2004, and a bonus workout which is a bit longer,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-on-the-Ball/dp/B00009W0VN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga on the Ball</a>.  I had previously reviewed all of the practices in the Yoga Makeover series, and so I have described each of them below.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Weight-Loss/dp/B00049QQP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Weight Loss</a>
This practice is well-suited to those who prefer greater movement in postures rather than holding static poses for a longer length of time.  Sara begins with a chair pose vinyasa, adding arm movement and a forward bend and linking the series with breath; this is followed by a standing backbend combined with forward bend series. Next comes a vinyasa that is repeated throughout the workout: you move from plank to cobra to down dog, again combining the series with breath. From a 3-legged down dog position, Sara leads you into several series of standing poses: she begins with triangle/revolved triangle, moves on to warrior/side angle pose/revolved side angle in the next series, and finishes with crescent lunge/revolved crescent lunge. She completes the plank-cobra-down dog vinyasa between each series, eventually substituting upward dog for cobra. Finally, the practice ends in a seated position with head-to-knee pose and a brief hand mudra.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flat-Abs/dp/B00049QQI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flat Abs</a>
Here Sara leads a challenging yoga practice aimed at strengthening your core abdominal muscles. She begins with standing side bends, adding a twist with a knee lift. Next comes some additional seated stretches with forward bends, twists, and spine rolls. Sara then moves to an all-fours position and leads some particularly challenging work moving from down dog to plank pose with one leg pulled in towards your chest. This is followed by some additional seated twists, including a twisting boat pose. Lying on your back, you'll then perform Pilates-like abs moves such as criss-cross, bicycle, and stretches with both bent and straight legs. You'll also perform a half sit up with the legs both bent and straight as well as side knee drops with the legs both bent and straight.  This is a tough, challenging practice which is likely to feel overwhelming for beginners.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sculpted-Buns-Thighs/dp/B00049QQLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sculpted Buns & Thighs</a>
This nice lower body practice does a good job of thoroughly stretching the legs and opening the hips. Sara begins the practice in a standing position with several variations of chair pose; each variation is held for a few breaths. She then moves on to a triangle-warrior series for strengthening the leg muscles followed by a temple pose (a plie squat)-fan pose (wide-legged standing forward bend) combo which really stretches the legs, especially the hamstrings. The practice then moves on to the floor for camel pose, first performed with one hand only on each side then both hands. Finally, there is a lunge-lunge twist-pigeon-cobbler series that is perfect for opening the hips, and Sara finishes the practice with a simple seated yoga mudra.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Power-Beauty-Sweat/dp/B00049QQL4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Power Beauty Sweat</a>
Here, Sara does not rely on a traditional series of sun salutations to build heat in the body; rather, she adds movement to standing postures to intensify. She begins in a seated position with a simple side stretch and twist, then moves to kneeling for a kneeling side stretch (gate pose) and side plank. From here, the practice evolves to standing postures, including fan pose, a standing twist, and chair--each pose is repeated with movement and then a twist to both sides. Balance work comes in the form of eagle pose, and then there is a series consisting of dog pose, lunge, runner's stretch, and cow (or bull) performed to both sides. Dolphin pose further strengthens the arm muscles, and finally, there is a lying hamstring stretch. As with all the practices in this series, Ivanhoe ends with a mudra for detoxification here.  Overall, this is a nice, short yoga routine for focusing on standing postures and stretching the spine and hips.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Total-Body-Tone-with-Weights/dp/B00049QQLO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Total Body Tone with Weights</a>
This feels like a yoga practice with some toning work thrown in. Sara begins the practice with a few brief stretches in a standing position then picks up the weights (she is using 2-lbs.). She leads you through some standing shoulder work in mountain, tree, and chair poses and ends the segment in eagle pose, which I found a bit awkward with the weights. Next comes a warrior series where you hold your legs in the warrior position while working your arms with bicep curls and flies. Sara also does side angle pose, using the weights in sort of a one-arm row to an overhead lift, which I felt was a nice shoulder opener.  Sara then moves to the floor with triceps/core balance work performed from a hands and knees position. Next comes bridge pose while ""bench pressing"" the weights; the second set is performed on one leg, which was particularly challenging. A few additional stretches bring the practice to an end right at 20 minutes.

Because Sara does not provide detailed instruction, I would not recommend any of these routines for those with no prior exposure to yoga.  However, many experienced beginners are likely to enjoy her calm, down-to-earth manner.",1373846400,2,5949,5.785142857142858

3240428,5,B000XSKDFQ,"The 5 stars supposedly speak for themselves, however, let me reiterate:  I LOVE THIS DVD!

 I was a little skeptical, at first.  I searched through Amazon looking for a yoga dvd that would fit my lifestyle.  I'm a college student, with limited time to devote to exercise no matter how much I'd like to.  So when I came across this product, with its already flourishing reviews (for the most part), and the allure of a supposed total body makeover within just 20 minutes a day, I was both excited and yet somewhat suspicious.  I looked around some more but found nothing that quite fit my needs as this DVD seemingly did and, anyway, nothing else had nearly as great a rating of 5 stars like this one.  So I bought it!

I was surprised at how ""easy"" it was to get into the routines. Though I've yet to try the routine using an exercise ball (again, college student, did you know those things run upwards of $30 at Target?!), I've tried everything else, and everything is VERY doable even for a yoga novice like myself (although I have dappled in yoga in the past, I was not particularly successful at it, so I still consider myself an amateur).  My favorite routine is definitely the Power Weight Loss.  It really does get you sweating if you're willing to push yourself in order to GET yourself sweating.  The Core Power workout, however, is probably tied for first too, though.  I really do feel like it has aided in my core development.  I've never particularly had, nor really wanted abs, but after doing the Core Power workout regularly these past 3 months I have noticed a significant difference (as have others) and I'm even beginning to make out a silhouette very much similar to Ivanhoe herself, which DEFINITELY pleases me.  All other routines are great as well, but I feel these two are my staples.

Now for what everybody wants to know, does it actually give you a TOTAL body makeover?

The answer, for me at least, is a confident and ecstatic YES!  To give you some context, I had been loosely dieting (that is, just eating healthily and not starving myself of any particular food group like some diets demand) for about 5 or 6 months prior to ordering this DVD which I ordered around mid-January 2012.  I had lost 15 pounds just eating healthily alone and sought to add some exercise to boost not only my health, but also, of course, my weight loss.  And it worked!  I weighed myself recently (I don't very often) and discovered I've lost yet ANOTHER 15 pounds.  I credit this very much to this dvd, which is the only exercise I've truly done the past 6 months other than walking to and from class on a daily basis (however, it's the summer now, and I'm still glad to report my weight loss has been maintained!).  I started out doing a routine, for 20 minutes, as advertised, every other day when convenient.  I've since boosted it to every other day plus additional days when I feel up to it, sometimes even doing two routines in a row if I have time (like I said, it's the summer now).  My legs are stronger, my body is more flexible, my core is starting to outline, and my arms are getting less and less flabbier (I credit this to plank pose and chaturunga!).  What's more, I FEEL healthier AND stronger AND satisfied with my body despite the fact that I've got, ideally, a little ways to go if I want the
""Ivanhoe"" physique.  This is the beauty of yoga, in my opinion, and it definitely applies to this DVD.  Without seeing dramatic results like some exercise routines promise (need I mention it, like ""Insanity""?), the gentle, rhythmic, though highly demanding practice, and ART, of yoga allows one to feel accomplished in not just one's bodily needs, but one's mentality as well.  This has definitely been a plus with this DVD as it was one of my lingering skepticisms as I began trying it-- would it give me the mental benefits as well, given that it only takes 20 minutes? The answer again is yes.  At the end of each routine, Ivanhoe runs you through a mudra that really does act as she promises.  I feel my body calming down to such an impressive degree that sometimes I run through mudras during the day when I feel particularly stressed.  They really do work!

So, over all, it should be clear:  I LOVE THIS DVD.  I really haven't needed to do anything else besides go through routines regularly and eat healthily (which yoga encourages intrinsically) and I've lost 15 additional pounds, 30 pounds over all in a year! Not a DRASTIC change, but, believe me, a highly noticeable change not only to myself but to my family and friends.  Though it may take time, it's highly worth it, because it's really easy to stick to!  The routines are fun, though challenging, and that's something most dvds and workout regimens can't guarantee.  In my opinion, this DVD really, truly is fun AND effective.  I can't wait to order more of Sara Ivanhoe's stuff!

If you choose to order it (which, obviously, I highly suggest you do), good luck and have a happy body makeover! (You will. ;))",1339977600,11,4998,4.540782122905028
3240429,4,B000XSKDFQ,"Yoga Body Makeover Series with Sarah Ivanhoe is a 2 disc set with three workouts on each disk.  The workouts are Power Weight Loss, Power Tone With Weights, Core Power, Lower Body Power, Power Sweat Detoxify, and On The Ball which is a bonus workout.  All workouts were originally issued separately.  With the exception of On The Ball, the workouts are 20 minutes each.  The On The Ball workout is about 40 minutes long.  Each of the workouts is high beginner or low intermediate level.

The Power Weight Loss workout is unlikely to help anyone lose weight, but it is a good short workout for flexibility and strength.  Power Tone With Weights uses 1 to 3 pound weights.  Core Power seems simple compared to other core workouts I have, but it's surprisingly effective.  Lower Body Power is my favorite and is definitely a good lower body stretch.  I have not yet tried Power Sweat Detoxify but I will.  I do not own a stability ball so I won't be using the On The Ball workout.

I enjoy Sarah Ivanhoe's approach to yoga instruction.  Her cueing is excellent and she is friendly and encouraging.  This is not pure yoga as Sarah incorporates some moves from Pilates and weight training.  While Sarah appears alone in each of these workouts she gives instruction on modifications.  I particularly like the way she tells you not to worry if you cannot stretch as far as she can - she tells you to keep a sense of humor on the balancing poses, and no one cares if you can get your head to your knees and similar comments.  In fact, I enjoy Sarah's thorough instruction and friendly manner so much I intend to purchase more of her yoga workouts.

My only complaint is that if you want to do more than one workout it is impossible to run them together.  You have to watch the exercise warning and the complete opening for each.  The disk will not allow you to fast forward though much of it.  In my mind, this significant annoyance was foreseeable and should have been addressed when Natural Journeys' decided to re-release these workouts as a compilation.",1339286400,2,2049,4.574175824175824

It can get really confusing buying exercise videos because they always come out with another version. And ive accidentally bought dvds I already owned because they might change the packaging and make me believe that its a new product.

Sara the instructor is great, she's brief and to the point and does a great job of explaining the movements without a lot of fluff.

3240455,5,B000XSKDFQ,"""Self-acceptance, in my opinion, is the highest practice in yoga.""  This enlightened philosophy permeates through Sara's courses.
The New York Times reported on research confirming that self-compassion leads to greater happiness and less anxiety, see ""Go Easy on Yourself, a New Wave of Research Urges"" on 2/28/11.  The logical implications if followed would mean that if we are more accepting of our own imperfections and mistakes and know that we are stretching to improve (sorry I couldn't resist), we would be more accepting, less afraid, less judgmental and less jealous of others.  ""If you fall down [during balance poses or life], just laugh at yourself and get right back up"".

These 20 minute videos are perfect for doing in the morning before work and they offer something different every day.  As Blaise Pascal wrote ""I made this letter longer than usual because I lack the time to make it shorter"".  One can tell that Sara crafted these  routines in a very precise and well balanced manner.  I have been practicing yoga for 14 years and I find Disk 1 to be a masterpiece, with a perfect synchronicity of breath and movement, downward dogs and upward dogs, warrior and reverse warrior, plank poses and more.
Yoga is not a competition.  As Sara says ""No one cares if you are all the way down.""  For beginners don't worry about getting the poses exactly right, just ""concentrate on breathing and moving together"".

One word of warning, it is nearly impossible to resume watching in-studio DVDs after using this series.  It was filmed in Hawaii with gorgeous views of sailboats, gentle crashing surf, palm trees swaying in the breeze, and the occasional bird or two hopping around the green grass in the background.  Life is simply better outdoors.  The video is expertly done using many different camera angles with nice transitions.  One downside is that you have to fast forward through the DVD introduction on each of the five workouts, as the chapter points do not match up.  As other reviewers have noted, Sara's style is very down to earth.  She really shines at the end of each practice when she thanks you for joining her.  Add it to your cart and when it arrives it may even bring a little smile to your face :)

The 1st one I ordered, and used so much got scratched, so I had to order a second one.  Amazon your profits are going up on me. :-)

That tells you how much I prefer this Yoda DVD.
Its the one I use most often.

I like the instructor.
I like the length of each of the segments. 20 minutes.
I like the quality of the scenes and most of all the instruction.

There are modifications at various points, and I don't feel guilty if I can't wrap my foot behind my head 3 times.
Sara is REAL.  While she looks like a model, she doesn't try to have you exercise like you're a model or have been doing yoga for 15 years.

For those who think its too short?  This is probably not the video for you and Sara clearly tells you this up front. She says if you only have 20 minutes, then this is the workout for you.  If your life permits you to have hours of yoga practicing time, then at least you've got options to combine the workarounds.  Its difficult to shorten a 1 hour DVD workout to 20 minutes. I've tried it disrupts the flow.

Sara obviously has worked with a lot of different people in different stages of their yoga fitness.  (read stiffness) And seems to know just what to tell me when I'm in that half moon pose about to fall over, or if my head will not go all the way to the floor on the straddle forward bend and tells me no one cares. That's what I need to hear.

So if you want a down to earth workout, with good instructions, and you can't put your nose on your toes, and your goal in life is not to be come a swami, this is the yoga DVD workout for you.

3240462,4,B000XSKDFQ,Love this dvd. Due to medical issues I was taking a gentle yoga class. This dvd steps it up without being stressful. I feel I get a good workout with it. The exercise ball is a great addition which I didn't know was included at the time I ordered. I was just looking for a little ramped up yoga. So now I have another venue to use when exercising. This is great because I do get bored doing the same thing. Would recommend it.,1284768000,,426,4.083333333333333
3240463,5,B000XSKDFQ,"This workout comes with 2 dvds with a total of 6 - 20 minute workouts; 3 workouts on one dvd and 3 on the other.  Definitely recommend to those just starting off wanting to experience yoga.  Also recommend you by this 2 disc dvd set rather than buy each one of Sarah's individual workouts.  Comes with Bun & Thigh, Ball workout, Upper body, weight loss workout, weight workout, and core (abs) workout.  You can play all the workouts to get a full hour of a yoga workout or play one at a time for your convenince.  It's a great value for all workouts in one!",1284249600,,557,4.266666666666667
3240464,5,B000XSKDFQ,"Sara Ivanhoe is truly an inspiration for learning the healing art of yoga.  She has excellent cueing, her explanations with the flow of the exercises is thorough, and she has a pleasant personality.
In case you are wondering how you may begin your yoga practice, please start with her in any of her DVD's.  I recommend this DVD because it has five 20-minute chapters that you may use individually or create a combination.  The  6th sequence on the ball is easier starting off, though it's twice as long as the other 5 chapters.",1274832000,,527,4.634408602150538
3240465,5,B000XSKDFQ,I really didn't think that I would get so much out of these short work outs but I have lost 3 pounds. and because they are so short I don't have any problems fitting them into my busy day,1274659200,2,187,3.8205128205128207
3240466,5,B000XSKDFQ,"I have been practicing yoga for over 2 years, but I still tend to prefer instructors who are slow and descriptive. Sara Ivanhoe definitely meets my needs. Her instructions are very thorough and easy-to-follow, and she really exudes a sense of warmth. This DVD offers several options for quick work-outs. I have enjoyed them all. It is a great deal and an excellent option for anyone just learning yoga.",1272067200,,402,4.840579710144928
3240467,5,B000XSKDFQ,"My youngest baby is 9.5 months old, and my oldest is 2 yrs.  I've been trying to drop those last few pounds since before I got pregnant with my second.  The high impact workouts (aerobics etc) were too much for my recovering prego hips, so I thought yoga would be better.  Plus - any time in the past that I stick to yoga a couple of days a week, my back and core always feel much better.

I love the variety that this DVD offers, and Sara is my favorite yoga person yet.  I started back up again (since before my second baby) last week (I did four of the workouts), and I've already lost two of those annoying pounds.  Of course, I've combined with diet, but I've lost inches from my waist already, and my legs are already more toned.

Love the variety, love the instructor, love the results, love how I feel....love it.",1270512000,,821,4.258064516129032
3240468,5,B000XSKDFQ,"I have been looking for a good yoga series that will challenge me by working different sets of muscles in each one. I get bored if I do the same video repeatedly, so I figured I would give it a try. I absolutely love it! Sarah is an excellent teacher, VERY easy to follow, very precise in what to do and how to do it. She knows just when to remind you to breathe and loosen the jaw (when it is getting tough!) and is a very comforting guide. It is a little like working out with a friend.

Pros:
1) excellent instruction in breathing and explaining the poses
2) 6 different workouts that each work a different part of the body - doesnt get boring too fast
3) not a whole lot of ""cosmic"" yoga - mostly focuses on the workout
4) workouts are only 20 minutes long, but you can easily go from one workout to another and change up the routine to keep it interesting.
5) great price!

Cons:
1)Workouts are too short to do just one. To get a full workout, you would have to do at least two of them.
2) You have to sit through the introduction at the beginning of every workout... cant just skip straight to the workout
3) The Abs workout isn't nearly as good as I was hoping...

This is the best yoga DVD that I have come across so far. Excellent for beginners and the poses can easily be made more difficult if you are closer to intermediate.",1268697600,4,1336,4.1505791505791505
3240469,5,B000XSKDFQ,"I love the variety here. Good for beginners, but with optional poses to use as you progress.",1267315200,,92,4.470588235294118
3240470,5,B000XSKDFQ,"Before you purchase any of Sara Ivanhoe's 20 minute yoga videos separately, buy this set!  I was glad people shared that the content of this DVD was the same as the individual ones.  This 2-disc set has 5-20 minute yoga workouts (more like 18-19 minutes with the intro) and one 40 minute yoga routine on the ball.  All of them give a nice yoga workout.  The one thing I wish I could do would be to play 2 workouts back to back like the 10 minute solutions series allows.  The 20 minute workouts are convenient, sometimes I want it to be longer.  The ball routine would be great for beginners.  If you are new to yoga, don't expect to get everything right the first time.  In order to fit a decent workout into 20 minutes, Sara moves quickly.",1263081600,,741,4.318840579710145
3240471,5,B000XSKDFQ,"I've been doing Yoga Zone videos which are awesome, but I needed variety and more of a challenge.  These DVDs meet that criteria.  My heartrate stays in the fat burning zone and I sweat while doing the weight loss workout.  I feel great afterwards!",1257897600,,248,4.590909090909091
3240472,5,B000XSKDFQ,"I've had time to practice every routine on this 2 DVD set and I love them all. As I'm an intermediate yoga practitioner, I initially thought these routines might be too easy, but this was not the case. Sara's instruction style is very relaxed, very easy to follow and the background music is not distracting. I have quite a few yoga DVDs and this set is definitely my favorite!",1255910400,,377,4.478260869565218
3240473,4,B000XSKDFQ,"My husband has seen me reap the benefits of practicing yoga over the years and though he is in fantastic shape he wanted to become more flexible and gain some of the relaxation and stretching benefits that yoga provides.

Together we tried the core yoga and the power weight loss segments and I tried the balance of the dvds alone.  Each segment, with the exception of the stability ball work out is 20 minutes.  The ball workout is about 45 minutes long.  The dvd is geared to beginner/intermediate, but I felt that it was much more heavily balanced toward the beginner end, so for my husband this was perfect.  Not a lot of time commitment, good instruction and good stretching with prayer twists, down-dogs, etc.  I found that a few of the workouts just didn't give me enough though, as I was used to doing more, so if you are above a beginner level you may find yourself a little bored. The core workout was nice with controlled movements that are much like pilates, which would be excellent for those trying to work with a minimum of time and want maximum benefits in toning their abs.

I enjoyed the 2nd disk the most, which covered power sweat, lower body power and on the ball yoga.  Power sweat was not as intense as it sounds though. The ball workout was an interesting twist and was a longer workout so I felt like that one was the one that I would do most often. I also liked the extra added core work you got as you had to keep yourself stable on the ball throughout the poses.

Sara's instruction is excellent and the settings are beautiful and calming.  I also like how at the end of each workout she includes a mudra, which is a hand gesture used in yoga and meditation as a way to ""seal your practice"".

Now that I have done this one, I would definitely like to try one of her intermediate workouts such as Yoga on the Edge.  She is a good instructor, with good form and cueing and keeps the workout positive and upbeat without being too chatty or over the top.

If you would like a little taste of yoga in short segments (nice if you are short on time or want to supplement your regular workout) this would be a good beginner series.  You can also do like I did and add several segments together to make a longer workout covering several of the workouts.  That's the best part-putting together what works for you!

Enjoy and be healthy!",1250294400,18,2354,4.389400921658986
3240474,5,B000XSKDFQ,I think that this is a great yoga workout for beginners and intermediates.  20 minutes make it perfect to add in to any day and there is an option to do all of the works at once as well.  Her voice is great and I appreciate that we spend the same amount of time on each side.,1247097600,,275,3.807017543859649
