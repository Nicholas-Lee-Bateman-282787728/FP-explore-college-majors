5833273,4,B00DMK6WN4,"I loved Monsters, Inc.; it's still one of my favorite Pixar movies. It's a touching movie about friendship and the lengths one monster goes to for a friendship even when he doesn't necessarily agree with his friend. And the relationship between Sully and Boo brought a tear to my eye in his willingness to let go of something that he loves to do what is best for that something. That something being Boo. However, it's the challenging of the norms that make the film standout. It's the demonstration that we ought to be constantly questioning the status quo and tradition so that we know whether there are better ways, now, than there were when those traditions were established that make the film really shine. [And I would bet money on it being a subtle jab at Disney, whom Pixar had fight every step of the way to get Toy Story out in the form we saw it in, because Disney wanted a more traditional story.]

But there is none of that in Monsters University. It is, in every way possible, a standard Disney film. Well, okay, maybe it's not standard Disney, but it's certainly standard. Two guys, rivals, have to learn to work together to overcome some great obstacle and, in so doing, they learn they are great partners. And, because of that, friends. It's the plot of virtually every buddy cop movie out there. Except Monsters U is in a school setting. There is nothing in the movie that is beyond typical.

Which is not to say that it's not enjoyable, because it is. Very enjoyable. It just doesn't feel like Pixar; it feels like Disney. Safe. Traditional. And that's disappointing. Because what we learned from Pixar is that traditional, for them, was challenging tradition. But that was before Disney. Don't get me wrong, Disney can make great films, but they are hardly ever challenging.

All of that said, Monsters U was enjoyable. It was fun to get to see Sully and Mike again and, even, Randall. Dean Hardscrabble was a great, new character, completely freaky, and Helen Mirren was excellent in the role. I wouldn't have wanted her paying any kind of personal attention to me. No, not even to tell me good job, because even ""good job"" from her would seem to carry some kind of menace.

Visually, the movie made no improvements over its predecessor. In fact, the animation seemed flatter. More plastic. But, then, it has been a while since I watched Monsters, Inc. so there may be some amount of idealization going on in my head as far as that goes. Still, after more than 10 years, you'd expect some amount of improvement, especially after the richness of the animation in Brave.

Many people say that it's unfair to judge Pixar movies by their previous endeavors, but I don't really agree. That's kind of like saying you shouldn't judge a McDonald's cheeseburger by other McDonald's cheeseburgers. Pixar did, after all, establish what a Pixar movie should be like. They are also the ones that have allowed Disney to mess with their recipe, which it's hard to fault Disney for since they own Pixar, now. However, these new Pixar burgers don't taste quite the same, quite as good, as the old ones. So, it may be true that Monsters University is a fine a movie, which it is, but it's not a fine Pixar movie. Of that, it falls short.",1372118400,4,3240,4.627826086956522
5833274,5,B00DMK6WN4,"The first thing I can say about this film is that I was smiling all the way through.  Although it is many years since I went to college, this one really hits the mark.  It works so well because it avoids many of the usual teenager cliches and actually attempts to view the experience as it is really ""felt"" by the characters.  Another ""plus"" for me is that the University itself is based upon the University of California at Berkeley.  Because here I went to law school and my offices are nearby, all brings back good memories.

Despite the many interesting monster characters, three stand out.  Mike is the student who everyone picks on. His success depends on applying himself every day for school through hard work and study. Obviously, he does not have the look of a ""scarer"" and thus has to work harder (and smarter) than everyone else. (Students who are a little ""different"" from their fellows will definitely relate to him).  ""Sully"" is the jock in the class, a true monster with natural talent but he cares little for actual studying. It's likely he was admitted to university because his dad was a famous student. When Mike and Sully eventually become roommates, they seem a mismatched pair...who don't even like each other.  But they learn and grow and find ways to respect the other.  ""Dean Hardscrabble"" is the tough teacher who thinks neither of them have the ""right stuff"" to succeed and, boy, is she frightening in her own way. Helen Mirren injects real menace to her voice as a caterpillar/dragon figure. (Don't forget the librarian - who has some surprises of her own).  Every college student encounters at least one tough and mean professor - think Dr. Charles Kingsfield of the ""Paper Chase"".  The students at Monsters University must figure out how to survive under such an intimidating teacher. Mike Wazowsky plans on winning the annual scare contest to prove himself worthy. But...he has to assemble a team - including Sully - to win.  The problem is that most of the team members are weak...so each has to improve. Few cartoons make you care about the characters as people...this one truly succeeds in that department. Truly, Pixar's most impressive achievement with this feature is that the team developed true-to-life personalities for the ostensible monsters. That's why I prefer this prequel to the original.  Perhaps not as clever, but more down to earth.

Another ""plus"" for the film is the attention to detail such as recreating the real look of a dorm room: The cheap desks, the posters on the wall, the bunkbeds, the claustrophobic feel of those rooms.  On the lawn, characters throw frisbees, the library is daunting, the celebration party in the fraternity illustrates the fun of the madness.  All the animators paid a lot of attention to their own experiences to make a college look right.

Like many Pixar films - the humor is directed at the young, teenagers, and the mature - so there are connections for everyone.  Yes, this is a perfect family film and one of the best Pixar offerings in years.  I hope it finds a large audience. The ending is quite astonishing...with intriguing lessons for the viewers...but to reveal it might spoil the importance of seeing the film.",1372032000,,3209,4.812386156648452
5833275,4,B00DMK6WN4,"Mike (Billy Crystal) has always dreamed of being a scary monster who's part of the scare team at Monster Inc. Being a student at Monsters University gives him that chance, except no one there thinks he's scary enough. The over-confident Sullivan (John Goodman) is the monster everyone sees potential in but he thinks he doesn't even have to try because his family name is already legendary.
  The two compete over who's scarier and can't stand each other. However, when they both get kicked out of scare class, they have no choice but to team up with an oddball fraternity in a scare games competition. If they win, they are back in scare class, if they lose, they are out of Monsters University.
  Kids who aren't familiar with underdog movies or an adult fraternity movie might enjoy it more than grown-ups. While in Monster's Inc, Mike said he knew Sullivan since the 4th grade, not college which is another flaw. Despite flaws and the plot not being extremely fresh, the film does have plenty of charm though and preaches a good lesson about being yourself. But it's predictable, while Pixar still hasn't done anything too special since Toy Story 3. I was entertained, but just like Cars 2, the movie was unnecessary and really shouldn't win any Oscars.",1371945600,2,1257,4.778801843317972
5833276,5,B00DMK6WN4,"Monsters University brings everything you expect from a Pixar film: well written and lovable characters, a great sense of humor, and an original and well told story filled with great messages and morals. Where MU differs from the rest of the pack is that it brings these elements all together in such a way the proves to he irresistibly charming and incredibly funny, I couldn't help but have a smile on my face throughout the entirety of the film.

With Monsters University, I can finally say that the Pixar drought is over!

MU tells a prequel story, one that didn't seem necessary at first glance. I was excited, but hesitantly so. Regardless of the reception, I knew that I was going to see it. After 2 years without a Pixar film (would not see cars 2 or brave), I couldn't stand it any longer. After all, Monsters Inc. is my favorite Pixar film! Afterwards, I was pleasantly surprised.

First off, I need to say one thing: Monsters University is the funniest Pixar film to date. I was rolling in my seat with laughter at points, but unlike most Pixar humor it wasn't only the slapstick or the funny facial expressions that struck my funny bone, it was the way that Pixar nailed the college experience on the head. Fresh off the college train, it was equal parts amusing and wonderfully nostalgic to see Pixar's ""college movie"", which was pleasantly free of vulgar language or overt sexuality; it was simply a purely funny and charming world and story the whole way through.

In some ways, MU had to have been the hardest film to make for Pixar. Since the genre relies so heavily on garbage humor, Pixar had to constantly think outside of the box to deliver both a funny and ingenious tale while avoiding everything that the genre has become known for in Hollywood, and Pixar brings its A game. Sure, a couple of jokes fall flat and are there purely for children's enjoyment, but just about every bit of humor is in here for people in college and beyond, and I applaud Monsters University for being so slyly mature and funny for an older audience.

But it's just not the humor that rocks in MU, the story is true and heartfelt. Mike is going to school to learn how to become a scarer, where he meets a young, inexperienced, and egotistical Sully. It's an interesting dynamic that totally works, one that I honestly didn't see coming. The characters are all well written and have great development, neither rushed or forced.

It's also relieving to see tons of brand new characters and how they develop Mike and Sully's relationship, all of whom are charming and unique. The story is filled with great messages for moviegoers of all ages, too. I also really felt for Mike and his striving towards academic success; his story resonated so much with me. My theater was cheering at points, and at others the tension was thick in the air. That's only happened in a select few other films, but not once in an animated film, which proves one thing: I wasn't the only one in love with these characters on the big screen! After an interesting and amusing series of events, Mike and Sully are forced to work together in the Scare Games to prove that they are more than just a pretty face.

The third act takes an interesting and creative turn, one that was equal parts surprising and conclusive. Even if MU lacks that freight train pacing and a ""Boo"" character to keep tensions high and the plot moving progressively forward, I think having that same dynamic would've made MU too safe and too similar. And that is what I found the most delightful about MU's story: it was original. It didn't rely on Monsters Inc. for cannon; the story totally works on its own, which is the most commendable quality of MU. Prequels usually fall into the same formula and rely on its brand to sell. MU can stand alone an apart from INC, or right alongside of it, and that's my biggest compliment for MU.

And once again Pixar Has utilized their beautiful RENDERMAN technology to bring the world of MU to life, with gorgeous CGI and believable characters. Presented in Sony Digital 4K, MU pops off the screen. The music by Randy Newman is quite fantastic; drum lines permeate an otherwise typical score, giving the music a unique feeling. I did miss the unique swing/jazz styles of INC, but it was good to see that some of the tunes from the original worked their way, respectively complementing the action on screen, as a nice little nod to the adventures to come within Monsters Inc.

So, am I a Monsters fan? You bet. And the premise of a prequel? I was hesitant. Not any longer.

Charming, hysterically funny, and most of all well told, well written and relatable, Monsters University could've been the most disappointing cash in of the summer. Thank Oozma Kappa it wasn't!

Final Score: 9/10",1371945600,6,4772,4.62219598583235
5833277,5,B00DMK6WN4,"I remember seeing Monsters Inc. in theaters when it first came out. I was absolutely obsessed with it and it was one of the best family movies I had ever seen. Fast-forward a couple of years and I heard news that there was going to be a prequel to Monsters Inc. I'll admit it that I was pretty skeptical and I didn't really see the need for a prequel. I had thought that a prequel was kind of ridiculous because Monsters Inc. could be a perfect stand-alone. After seeing Monsters University, I realized how essential it is to the viewer that we get the backstories of Mike, Sulley, and Randall.

  Monsters University has proven to me that Pixar can still make amazing, emotional films. Cars 2 was one of the most disappointing movies I had ever seen and I was worried that somehow Pixar would botch Monsters University. Monsters University is a fun movie that the whole family enjoy and it's impossible not to be entranced by this touching story. MU hits all the right notes and is not only emotional but it's also an extremely entertaining film. I loved watching Mike and Sulley slowly develop into the characters that I loved in Monsters Inc. It was also interesting to see how much Randall transformed from the beginning of MU to the end. I definitely would have liked to see more of Randall and how MU changed him.

  Even if you aren't familiar with Monsters Inc., Monsters University is still a treat! With it's stunning visual animation, spot-on acting by John Goodman and Billy Crystal, laugh-out-loud humor, and touching moments, it's impossible not to become a fan of the franchise. If you go in to MU, without seeing Monsters Inc. I'm almost 100% positive that you'll want to see Monsters Inc. right afterwards. Monsters University is definitely a noteworthy movie and it was well-worth the 12 years or so wait. Pixar has out-done themselves once again and I can't imagine them making another movie like Cars 2 ever again after seeing MU.

  Could there be another Monsters Inc. film? There very well could be even though Monsters University wrapped up nicely. I would love to see another Monsters Inc. movie only if it's executed well. Pixar stills knows how to make a terrific movie that people of all ages will love. I'm so excited to see what Pixar has in store next and I hope I enjoy it as much I enjoyed MU. I'd highly, highly recommend seeing MU and it surpassed any expectations that I had for this prequel. I definitely plan on seeing it again once it releases on DVD.",1371945600,3,2490,4.615384615384615
5833278,4,B00DMK6WN4,"When it comes to animation, Disney's Pixar is second to none.  Pixar continues to one-up itself by producing impressive animation, while incorporating interesting stories for children...and adults.  Typically, animated features are catered towards children, yet certain films aren't necessarily as widely popular as others.  For instance, Toy Story continues to be adored by children, while also maintaining critical acclaim.  Oddly enough, Pixar's first creation (Toy Story) is still the benchmark for future productions - not just for Disney, but also for rival animators DreamWorks (Shrek) and Illumination Entertainment (Despicable Me).  The future of Pixar appears to be extremely bright as they focus on creating fresh new ideas while still revisiting popular characters from the worlds of Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and the newly released Monsters Inc. prequel, Monsters University.

Billy Crystal and John Goodman reprise their roles as Mike Wazowski and Sully Sullivan (respectively) in Monsters University, telling the story of their first meeting and the events leading to their friendship.  Mike believes he's destined to be a professional ""scarer,"" but no one finds him to be even remotely scary, despite his endless knowledge on the subject.  On the other hand, Sully comes from a well-known family of scarers, and believes he doesn't need to study to become a success.  After instantly becoming rivals, Mike and Sully are both kicked out of the scare program for their short-comings, and are forced to work together to earn their way back.  Mike makes a deal with the university headmistress, Dean Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren), to allow them to reenter the program if their ""joke"" of a fraternity, Oozma Kappa (OK), wins the schools scare competition.  The OK fraternity must walk the tough path to victory as a team and prove their doubters wrong or face further embarrassment from their already harsh critics.

After a boatload of hoop-jumping, another Monsters film has finally arrived.  But, was it worth the wait?  It's a bit of a complex question, but the short answer is yes.  It's not as though there have been a shortage of quirky animated films during the 12 absence of Mike and Sulley, but in case you haven't been able to tell by the long lines of people waiting to see Monsters University - the duo has clearly been missed by fans.  Did it take too long for a sequel (prequel) to arrive?  Of course, it did.  However, good things come to those who wait, and for the most part, your patience will have paid off when you're in your seat, preparing for the bright colors to attack your eyes.  And, rest assured - the disdainful feeling that has mounted over the years between films will evaporate, leaving you to enjoy a film that remains loyal and true to the wondrous characteristics of the first film.

John Goodman and Billy Crystal pick-up as though they had never left off, quickly going from best friends in the first film to rivals in the prequel.  It was a bit of a shocking turn of events, but it makes for a much more ambitious plot as opposed to the simple idea that the pair would best friends from childhood.  These two characters come together in a very unlikely scenario, which is the major reason this film turns out to be as interesting as it is.  Surprisingly, there really isn't any hardnosed villain to battle in this film as there was in the first film (even though Steve Buscemi does return as the future evil-doer, Randall Boggs).  This film is more about Mike and Sulley being forced to work together for a common goal:  to win a competition in order to take one step closer to achieve their dream of becoming a scarer.

Monsters University is a typical theme-driven film that puts the main characters in the usual situation of having to look outside themselves and rely on others for help.  Both of the main characters know what they want to achieve, but life serves up roadblocks for them and if they apply themselves, they can achieve their goals regardless of the unforeseen hurdles.  Speaking of hurdles, competition plays a major factor in the lives of these characters once again - as it did in the beginning of the first film with the scare competition.  Monsters University features the Scare Games for roughly half of the film, including events focusing on the importance of teamwork, rather than focusing on individual accolades.  However, the premise is the same as the majority of other group competition films, with the OK fraternity being outsiders and dysfunctional at first, then learning how to come together and function as a team.

Overall, Monsters University is equally as enjoyable as its predecessor, combining bright colors with an enjoyable plot, not to mention plenty of laughs along the way.  The plot makes for an interesting dynamic, meshed with a successful narrative that bridges the gap from the beginning of the duo's college career to the beginning of Monsters Inc.  Although it's still a bit questionable that Disney chose to do a prequel rather than a sequel, it's still a film that anyone can enjoy - even if you didn't see the first film.  Mike and Sully are just as enjoyable as before, meaning their return to the big screen will easily appease the fans.  Monsters University has been slated to be a box office powerhouse from the moment it was announced and it will clearly content for the title of the highest grossing animated film of 2013.

5833279,5,B00DMK6WN4,"From the opening scene, Monsters University gives laughs and a visual spectacle of cute and lovable characters. Pixar rarely disappoints and the bar is always set high. However, this movie managed to exceed my expectations. I expected a cute, heartwarming story with an uplifting ending, but Pixar never ceases to surprise. The story was funnier and more intelligent than I expected. The story was, of course, fun and exciting from the beginning. However, the story was unpredictable, refusing to fit into stereotypical molds by fooling you into believing the stereotype was occurring before overthrowing it with twists and turns. The story delivers constant laughs and a handful of unexpected twists that are as believable as they are unusual. Also, Pixar delivers an incredible cast of voices and beautiful animation. The visuals are stunning and the returning cast is great, with the new characters providing exceptional fun. The film is an overall joy to watch with great jokes and fun characters. The film is great fun for kids and a refreshing break from summer action blockbusters for adults. This is a great movie for all to enjoy between the rush of super-hero/ action films. I recommend this film for all ages.

The Pixar short is fantastic, by the way. A story about an umbrella and many other inanimate objects that can move. It is a love story, and it is original and fun.

Pixars decade-long reign over the animation genre certainly has been compromised in recent years by DreamWorks, Blue Sky, and Disney Animation. So while the company that has dared to push the envelope continually in the last few years (death in Up; holocaust allegory in Toy Story 3; pseudo-demonic possession in Brave) as the re-open a book that has been closed since 2002,Pixar triumphantly reverts back to their more traditional roots by drawing up emotions form the story and characters instead of focusing on spectacle as they had been in the last few years. The character dynamics between Mike and Sully out do the 2002 original, and fit the perfect juxtaposition that Pixar has traditionally hung to.

5833320,1,B00DMK6WN4,Very disappointed in that when the outside plastic came off there was nothing to keep movie cover on . I have never bought a movie that the cover does not stay on it so you know what the movie is that you have when storing it.,1510272000,,226,3.9347826086956523

5833322,4,B00DMK6WN4,Basically this is a prequel to MONSTER'S INC. The relationships are better explored and you see how the various characters came to know each other. A little slower in spots but still quality entertainment. May have left room for another sequel fitting in before the original.,1509840000,,275,5.0

5833383,5,B00DMK6WN4,"Warning this review contains spoilers. What I like about this movie is that even thought Mike is unable to achieve his big dream of being a scarer, it does not break him. Too often today we tell kids that with hard work they are guaranteed to achieve their dreams. Mike learns to accept his limitations and seeks a new path in life that makes him happy. I think this movie has a good moral lesson about getting back up when you fail.",1485648000,,433,4.2926829268292686

5833469,5,B00DMK6WN4,"Quite frankly, I love this movie.  It may be even better than Monsters, Inc., but only because I found the 'baby talk' of Boo annoying.
This is a perfect back story to help us love the characters of Sully and Mike even more (if that is possible).  Great story line, great voice acting, top of the line cgi, laugh out loud humor, heartwarming story without the sappy ending -  make this one for buying for a collection - albeit a digital one.
Kudos on a fantastic film.
Great for kids and adults alike - can be watched before or after Monsters, Inc",1474675200,,547,4.3431372549019605

5833520,5,B00DMK6WN4,"Although Monsters University came out after Monsters Inc., I'd recommend watching Monsters University before watching Monsters Inc. if you haven't seen either of them.  Mike's childhood difficulties being picked on and bullied and not fitting in are familiar to so many children, and the way these shape Mike into the can-do determined monster who firmly believes he will accomplish his dream in one way or another will have you cheering him on throughout the movie.  How he uses his ingenuity, imagination and stubbornness to transform Sulley into his friend and mold a group of defeatist outsider fraternity members into a winning team is laugh-a-minute entertainment with a subtle lesson for everyone.",1470700800,3,704,5.333333333333333

Yes, I know it's just Revenge of the Nerds with monsters, but this movie had really good heart, writing, animation, and it found ways to surprise me. Every time I thought I knew how the next scene would play out because it looked like they were going to reach for a tired clich they found a way to revitalize said clich and make it fresh, turning it into something totally unexpected.
 In short, I expected another waste of time like Cars 2 and instead I got a really great movie. Definitely recommended.",1459468800,,608,4.577981651376147

However, the plot and storyline simply didn't have the same grab as the original. This feels to me like another movie that Pixar has done in order to capitulate to Disney's agendas. I hope at some point they will be able to do more to grow some original stories and ideas that made Pixar's movies so fun in the first place.",1453161600,,483,4.627906976744186
5833743,5,B00DMK6WN4,wonderful movie,1453161600,,15,7.0
5833744,4,B00DMK6WN4,"Every time Pixar goes back to the well to attempt a resurgence on previously
popular titles, I get a little nervous.  Sometimes they succeed (Toy Story 3) and
sometimes they fail miserably (Cars 2).  Fortunately, Monsters University falls
pretty much in the category of succeeding and being on par with the original film.
Perhaps the reason this new venture seems so fresh is because of the fact that
Pixar decided to do a prequel rather than a sequel.

We all know the story of Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sullivan (John Goodman), the
top scarers of Monsters Inc., but did you know how their relationship began?
As the film opens, we meet young Mike Wazowski, a one-eyed pea of a youngster
that just doesn't fit in with the rest of his monstrous schoolmates.  On a class trip
to the infamous Monsters Inc., Mike realizes his dream of becoming a top scarer.
Moving forward a few years, Mike's determination leads him to Monsters University
where he meets Sully, the big blue furry creature who seems to be riding on the
success of his family's name despite being a below grade-average student.  The
two become rivals which leads to their expulsion from the school's scare program.
How the two go from rivalry to becoming best friends is the basis for the rest of
the story.

Once again, Pixar has done a remarkable job producing a beautifully realistic
animated film with an engaging story, some laughable moments, and likable
characters that are brought to life thanks to top-notch voice talents that include
Steve Buscemi (Randy) and Helen Mirren (Dean Hardscrabble).  Of course, what
would a Disney feature be without some hard-earned lessons for kids to learn about
teamwork over self importance.

By now, you would expect a Blu-ray like this to be flawless in picture quality.  It
certainly lives up to those expectations.  The transfer from the digital source is
impeccable, allowing for an exceeding amount of detail within the animation where
you really appreciate its fine textures.  There are no artifacts to be found anywhere.
The film is filled with vibrant fall colors by day and soothing pink sunsets by evening.
Didn't really notice anything within the transfer that conveyed deep black levels.  Still,
this is the sort of picture perfect presentation you would expect from Disney/Pixar.

The only disappointment to be found here is the 3D imagery.  Once again, instead
of giving something special to the folks that pay a premium to see this technology
in the theaters and homes, Pixar is pretty much playing this one by the numbers.
There are varying amounts of depth and dimensionality throughout the film ranging
from average at best to looking a bit flat during scenes that are not well lit.  Anyone
hoping for ""In-Yo'-Face"" pop-out is going to be sorely disappointed.  The filmmakers
gave no opportunity to provide its audience with a little added fun.  Instead, we have
various body parts (elbows, fingers, heads) that at times seem to cross the screen's
dividing line, but alas, pop-out is kept very much at bay here.  As I watched this film
wearing eyewear, I couldn't help but think that the added dimensionality really added
nothing to the experience other than one single moment at the end of the film that
involved falling confetti.  However, by the time that moment arrived, it seemed too little
too late.

The only thing that is remotely immersive about this presentation at home is the
7.1 Dolby TrueHD soundtrack (downconverted to 5.1 on my system).  It has been
quite some time since I have seen Dolby TrueHD displayed across my receiver and
its presence is truly welcomed here.  The lossless mix is quite engaging thanks to
its seamless panning of effects across the entire sound field.  In scenes crowded
with an array of monstrous characters, voices are effectively carried from one side
of the room to the other. In quieter moments, such as Mike reflecting by a lake, the
rears supply just the right amount of ambient sounds of nightfall.  One of the most
impressive moments of the film where all the channels seem to be utilized at once
is during a challenge where characters are running to avoid stinging glow urchins
that are being hurled towards them.  LFE is very prominent, particularly at the moment
we first meet Sullivan bursting into a classroom, or moments later when a scare canister
flies out of control.  Even party music provides enough bass to shake 'da house.

What I still have left to mention is Randy Newman's score, recorded with a 112-piece
orchestra, whose musical variations dominate the entire sound field throughout the
full length of the film without managing to drown out the vocals.  In all, I was very happy
with the consistency in volume within the soundtrack.

The Ultimate Collector's Edition of Monsters University arrives as a 4-disc set
(Blu-ray+Blu-ray 3D+DVD+Bonus Features BD).  Also included is a Digital Copy
of the film.  It arrives in a cardboard slipcover that oddly, is not lenticular.  There is
a treasure trove of extra features -- too many to list -- but includes featurettes on
just about every aspect of the film's production and animation.  There is also an
included bonus Pixar short entitled, The Blue Umbrella.

I thoroughly enjoyed the film and would recommend it on its
entertainment merits alone without the added dimensionality.",1453075200,,5319,4.939325842696629

My concerns were quickly washed away when I leaned over and asked him if he thought she was scary and his reply was, No Mom shes really cool. She has wings.  Gotta love boys.
 Youll love all the great features of Monsters University because it gives you flash of all the fabulous things about College and developing challenges like studying and building friendships.

5833826,5,B00DMK6WN4,"2 thumbs way up from my 3 year old! This movie not only captivates small children, but has a major re watch factor ( always good to have a movie like that waiting in the wings ). In addition I find the film quite enjoyable myself, a HUGE plus! Nothing worse than your child watching a movie you can't stand over and over..:

Furthermore my love of this movie is predominately based on the nuances and hidden morals embedded in the plot. I won't put any spoilers in here, but essentially Mike Wysowski proves that you can accomplish anything with the right amount of heart and hard work. Also he learns that sometimes we don't always end up where we set out to go, but we always end up where we were meant to be.",1445558400,,711,4.266666666666667

We were discussing the two ""Monsters"" movies and my older grandson recommended this one because it introduced the main characters of the first movie.  Billy Crystal and John Goodman were excellent as the voices--perfect matches for the personalities of the characters.  The story line was interesting enough to keep this discriminating grandmother  and my 3-year old grandson entertained.  You don't have to see the first movie to understand this one as the story stands on its own.

On the other hand, if you really liked Cars 2, you might enjoy this. To me, it just didn't stand up to the high quality of Pixar's other films.
