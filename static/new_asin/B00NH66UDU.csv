8678176,5,B00NH66UDU,"I've just added this Blu-ray, which I was fortunate to receive a review copy of, to my list of top 10 classical music discs. The performances of the varied works included are exceptional, and the disc's picture and sound quality could not be better.

Things start off with a bang with Stravinsky's Symphony in Three Movements. The piece still sounds very modern, with offbeat rhythms and brutal attacks -- all in a day's work for the extraordinarily nimble Berlin Philharmonic under the baton of Simon Rattle.

Amazingly, the response of the audience in Moscow's Tchaikovsky Conservatory is tepid. In fact, the camera captures attendees with bored expressions (along with a stifled yawn or two). Are they still holding a grudge against the expatriot composer?

Next is the Bruch Violin Concerto, with Russian violinist Vadim Repin doing the honors. He's fully up to the demands of this highly romantic concerto, from the fiery allegro of the first and third movements to the meltingly beautiful adagio of the second.

As excellent as the sound is on this disc, I wouldn't have minded a little more audio spotlighting of Repin's bowing. Maybe my ear has been too trained by studio audio recordings, which tend to place the soloist more forward in concertos. That said, this disc provides a nearly perfect approximation of what one would have experienced in the hall.

The concert ends with the Beethoven Symphony No. 7, and what an ending it is. It's everything one would want, and has increased my own appreciation of the work. The orchestra plays as one in a highly suspenseful performance. Yes, suspenseful. Somehow, no matter how many times you've heard the work, Rattle will make you feel as if you're hearing it for the first time.

The first movement is tight and muscular -- and fully satisfying on its own. The second is incredible in the way Rattle and his musicians build it from the finest pianissimo to a crescendo and back again. This is mesmerizing music-making, and the study in contrasts show off the orchestra's full capabilities. The last two movements are simply thrilling.

By this point, even the blas Russian audience members have been won over. They offer a standing ovation and several well-deserved ""bravos.""

Again, technically this is one of the best Blu-rays I've seen. The HD image is extremely sharp and lifelike. The sound (once you switch from the stereo default to DTS surround sound) is vibrant, clear and immersive.

Needless to say, this is a keeper.

8678177,1,B00NH66UDU,"My fault.  I had ordered it six years ago and had forgotten -- and could not find the copy in my collection.

But six years ago, it amazed me that the acoustics could be so good in such a vast, industrial plrace.",1418601600,,212,4.023809523809524
8678178,5,B00NH66UDU,"This 2008 edition in the series of concerts held by the BPO every year on May 1 to celebrate its founding was held in the Tchaikovsky Conservatory - the same setting as the previous concert with Karajan in 1969.

The chosen pieces for the concert make an interesting mix. The concert opens with Stravinsky's Symphony in 3 Movements which may well have been unfamiliar territory for many in the (young) audience. However the performance has been part of Simon Rattle's repertoire for a very long time and here it receives an immaculate performance. The textures are kept very clear with every strand of the orchestration easily identified. The expertly chosen tempi allow for this clarity and the performance avoids any trace of heaviness. It receives polite applause at the end.

The next item features the popular and gifted violinist Vadim Repin who delivers a serenely lyrical interpretation of Bruch's romantic Violin concerto 1. This performance allows time for each phrase to breathe naturally and, once again, any trace of heaviness is avoided. This concerto suits the capabilities of the Berlin strings perfectly and the whole effect is one of a sustained soaring song. The more virtuoso passages are taken very quickly and with immaculate accuracy and with seeming ease. Not surprisingly this performance receives a more enthusiastic reception than the previous Stravinsky.

The concert ends with a rousing performance of Beethoven's Symphony 7 which concludes with a satisfying blaze of brass from the horns and trumpets. Although the symphony is played by a sizeable modern orchestra it is clear that both Rattle and the players are well aware of current thinking as regards authentic performance style. As a result the tempi are kept on the move and, once again, undue heaviness is avoided although it is quite clear that this is the weightiest item on the program. The audience clearly enjoyed this performance and respond accordingly.

The imaging is good and the camera work shows a complete understanding of the scores as is typical of the Paul Smaczny team. The sound formats are presented in DTS 5.1, DD 5.1 and stereo. It is worth mentioning in addition that the balance of the solo violin in the concerto is more naturally balanced than is often the case with no significant artificial highlighting of the solo line.

The blu-ray mastering has been achieved with considerable success and the transition from DVD to blu-ray has resulted in greater clarity of both sound and vision akin to a veil being raised. This is another very fine disc in its entirety.

Potential purchasers should note that his disc is available either as part of an advantageously priced four disc box set listed under the conductor's name or as this single disc issue. Those who already own part of the contents of the box set (Waldbuhne 2007 & 2008 plus Europakonzert 2007 & 2008) would be best advised to continue with the single discs while those who have none of the discs need to consider whether the box set or the single discs offer the best musical /economic option.",1416614400,3,3068,4.970760233918129
