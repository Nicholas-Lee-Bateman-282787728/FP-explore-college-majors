1653387,4,B00005R1N2,"As a child growing up in the 70's, one show that was on constently in reruns was DRAGNET. Staring writer/producer/director Jack Webb as the ever stolic Sgt. Joe Friday of the Los Angeles Police Department. But the shows that I saw growing up were the color episodes produced in the late 1960's. And it wasn't untill the early 90's when I saw a few of the Original shows produced in the 1950's, back when the series was also enjoying a successfull run on radio, now as an adult watching these old shows, they still never cease to entertain me.""Bad Boys"" is no exception. From the first notes of the opening theme, to the rapid fire dialogue that has become a series trademark, down to the familar image of the hammer stiking down baring the MARK VII LTD. logo, one thing that remains true... this is classic TV at it's best, and more importantly... DRAGNET at it's best. I thouroghly recommend it! Also be on the look out for a very young Leonard Nimoy (long before anyone ever heard of STAR TREK) in one of his first professional roles as a punk. You'll love it just for the nostalgia of it.",969667200,12,1091,4.46

1653396,5,B00005R1N2,"I don't think I ever saw these shows as reruns back when I was a kid, but enjoy the heck out of them now.  Most of the episodes were filmed in 1953, and much of the photography is iffy, but I doubt there is much that can be done about that--these no doubt languished in a vault somewhere until mastered onto DVD.  Still, the episodes are all enjoyable, and I have gone through them all now.  I also enjoyed reading the insert guide to Jack Webb Dragnet; I had no idea there was that much history to the show.

Good stuff, recommended for fans of the series in the 60's.",1438646400,3,569,4.1454545454545455
1653397,4,B00005R1N2,""" This is the city, Los Angeles California."" I always liked Jack Webb's opening narration to Dragnet and this collection is a sort of ""best of"" of the fifties episodes. Of course it is governed by what episodes are available as they have appeared on previous collections. However the big draw with this set is the souvenir tin with an embossed police badge, good enough to have out on display. There are some gems in this collection including two episodes in which Sergeant Friday fires his gun, The Big Break and The Big Thief. Action was always rationed in Dragnet as not doubt Jack was aware that real life police officers are not involved in shoot outs every week. I would be curious to know in how many of the fifties episode did Friday use his gun? My only complaint is the dubious condition of some of these episodes, it is a pity they could not have been remastered. Otherwise if you do not have a Dragnet collection then buy this one. Efficiently made on a low budget Dragnet always gave a convincing portrayal of every day police work. One final note, I always enjoyed the little conversations between Friday and Smith about everyday life, ""What do you think Joe?""",1435968000,,1174,4.595238095238095
1653398,5,B00005R1N2,"These shows are based on the format established by Webb on his Radio Show Dragnet.

Watch for  ""the Big Producer with Martin Milner selling porn to the kids in his High School class, Lee Marvin as a  homicidal organic food freak, and ""The Big Boys"" with one of the greatest sci-fi actors in tv history as a member of young pucks doing crime on their way down to L.A.

1653418,2,B00005R1N2,"Probably the most boring show with cops.  Two numb-nuts who are about as wooden as an elm chair crack boring low-range crimes with about as much gusto as opening a stale can of sardines.  There's little dialogue at all, just ""Yup, yes, sir, okay, what next?""  It's also packed with anti-rebellion wisecracks and an ""obey the cops"" mentality.  Utterly absurd and idiotic considering that 97% of ""officers of the law"" are on the 'take'.  I'm glad Serpico (1973) came out.  Enough of these old shows that portray cops as ""upholders of the grand law"".

Stick with Baretta (TV Series 1975-1978).",1404259200,,590,4.84
1653419,5,B00005R1N2,"As others have remarked, this is one of the only sources for original episodes of the 1950's version of ""Dragnet.""  These are not digitally processed, super high quality episodes. The transfers were done from 16mm prints of the series that had considerable wear and tear.  Not terrible, but one has to put up with scratchy film and a few edit glitches here and there.  At least one of the ""Dragnet"" episodes is actually from ""Badge 714,"" the syndicated version of the series. It's the same episode with a different series title.  Since there are few options for the original ""Dragnet"" at this time, it's this or nothing.  Even so, I'll give it five stars.

Jack Webb, who directed each episodes, as well as stared in the series, was a TV pioneer.  He created a specific look and feel for ""Dragnet"" that was one-of-a-kind at the time.  Others would soon pick-up on his techniques - clever camera angles, the use of numerous close-ups (TV's were much smaller in the 50's), and what some call the monotone dialogue delivery.  It's actually isn't monotone; that is an unfair criticism. What Webb sought to do what to make his series seem more real by encouraging his cast to deliver lines in a more realistic way.  In other words, not ""acting,"" but the way people naturally interact. I was impressed by his skills.

The 1950's version seems more realistic than the revival in the late 1960's. And for much of it's original run, the 1950's ""Dranet"" was a top-ten TV series. But, by 1967, Webb seemed to be tired of ""Dragnet"" and the revival is lacking.  If you want to get an idea of what the show was really like, buy this set and enjoy it.  Overlook the not-so-good 16mm prints this set was transferred from. If you can transcend this, you won't be disappointed.",1394409600,11,1759,4.635483870967742
1653420,3,B00005R1N2,The shows are classic and was so happy to see any of these old gems available and in a very nice tin.  On the down side the packaging holding the dvds is made of thick hard cardboard with an unstable center that doesnt hold the discs in place. A few of mine have light scratches from reciving a discs loose in the tin but so far are playing fine.  It would have been nice if someone could digitally clean the old show but it doesn't take away from the viewing experience.  Ive only watched the first disc so far and wanted to let others know that the first and last episode on that disc are switched ... named one thing but playing another.  All things aside this is a great crossection of classic 1950s Dragnet.,1392940800,2,712,4.2518518518518515
1653421,5,B00005R1N2,"I was a little kid when this series first arrived in the early fifties, but only watched a handful of the shows for which the unmistakable opening music and hammering the Mark VII emblem were probably the most impressionable for me. There were few TVs at that time, and my Dad assembled ours to the delight of our neighbors who didn't have the money to risk on one these new-fangled contraptions that would begin to flicker whenever the drama intensified. But attention would always affix to what was currently airing, and they always showed up to see the Dragnet episodes in their entirety. It was Jack Webb's greatest achievement, and remained popular when brought back in the late sixties again.
This original series ran when Los Angeles was still a tiny little city. The word Freeway had never been uttered, and none existed because freeways were not necessary yet. The west side had a scattering of beach houses owned by rich easterners, and orchards were in abundance over the entire area that have since been replaced by buildings, cement, people, and traffic. I have a better understanding of the show now, and it introduced several no-names that eventually went on to become very famous. Aside from everything in this collection beginning with ""The Big..."" the only other annoyance is the noticeably scratchy reproduction with lots of shadows of collected lint, as if to represent many showings using a motion picture projector. Much of that is phony these days and someone is making their living by adding this affect to some not so old digital videos, probably only being noticed and ridiculed by just a few of us.",1383350400,4,1625,4.870036101083032
1653422,5,B00005R1N2,Yes this brings back so many memories...terrific stuff!  A time when innocence was real.  It must have been great to have police back then who really cared...,1381968000,,158,4.814814814814815
1653423,4,B00005R1N2,"This box set marks the first opportunity I've had to see original ""Dragnet"" episodes from the 1950s. While the prints of the 22 episodes included are pretty battered, with some in worse condition than others, I'm glad I finally got to see this important and innovative series. What impresses me most about it is the attention to detail in each of the cases presented and an emphasis on the minutiae of the investigations. Each case is completely different from all the others and all are based on actual cases. This is what police work is like, not the endless shootouts, fistfights and car chases we became used to in so many 1970s police dramas. In only a handful of the episodes in this set does Sgt. Joe Friday even pull out his gun. I only recall two in which he actually fires it. Instead we see him question a steady parade of witnesses and grill a stream of suspects, intercut with scenes in the police lab as forensic scientists break down the secrets held by the various crime scenes. We see the human side of the equation as crime victims and family members confront the criminals with the human cost of their actions, as when a grieving husband (played by Michael Ansara) confronts a callous hotrodder who ran down and killed his pregnant wife or when the father of a boy killed in a shooting accident visits the boy responsible and offers forgiveness. While Joe Friday (Jack Webb) usually kept a tight lid on his emotions (which sometimes boiled up in barely-restrained anger at the criminals), the loved ones of victims did not. Friday himself has a moment of self-doubt and recrimination after he kills a man for the first time in one episode, but is talked through it by his understanding girlfriend.

While the series was shot on a low budget, using a mix of cramped sets and L.A. locations and making judicious use of closeups, it made for a very streamlined look and feel, with an intense focus on the facts of each case as uncovered in the investigations. Things don't always take a predictable turn. In one episode, a husband's insistence that his wife shot herself with his army pistol is undermined by circumstantial evidence pointing to the husband's guilt, which dictates Friday's line of questioning. Friday seems so sure of himself, but only after a forensic expert's thorough examination of the crime scene can the truth be known. Some episodes dealt with previously taboo subjects, including child molestation and drug abuse, with marijuana and heroin openly mentioned, despite Production Code restrictions that apparently extended only to movies of the time and not television.

Arguably the best episode on this set is ""The Big Producer,"" in which a onetime silent film producer, now reduced to turning out obscene literature for sale to high school kids, takes Sgt. Friday and his partner, Frank Smith, on an elegiac tour of a crumbling, abandoned movie studio where the producer had shot his silent western classics. The scene was filmed at an actual standing movie backlot that seems to be in genuine disrepair with crumbling buildings and a debris-strewn western street. There's a touch of SUNSET BOULEVARD in this episode, not a big surprise when you remember that series star Webb had, in fact, played a major supporting role in the famous Billy Wilder movie. Another highlight is ""The Big Cast,"" which casts Lee Marvin (Webb's co-star in YOU'RE IN THE NAVY NOW, 1951) as a serial killer questioned by Friday and his partner for nearly the entire episode, culminating in a confession over a meal at a health food restaurant.

The series is filled with terse sum-up messages delivered bluntly by Friday to criminals and his partners. In one episode, a confessed killer insists his motive for murder was ""just cheap,"" prompting Friday to say, ""You got it wrong, Henry. Wait till they read you the bill,"" following which we learn that Henry was executed in the gas chamber at San Quentin. In the episode about a fatal accident caused by the .22 rifle, Webb shares this moral with his partner, ""You don't give a kid a gun for Christmas."" When a nice old lady who'd been forging checks in order to give to charity claims she only wanted to help the poor the way the good Lord did, Friday responds, ""Well, there's a big difference, ma'am. He didn't use a checkbook.""

I've seen episodes of the 1967-70 revival of ""Dragnet"" (which has come out in high-quality box sets from Shout Factory, licensed from copyright owner NBCUniversal), and I would argue that the later series too often sacrificed the focus on police investigation to veer into stern lectures and diatribes against the counterculture. Clearly Webb felt the police, as an institution, were under attack in the 1960s and had to be defended. In the 1950s, they were a trusted authority and one could celebrate their work by simply portraying it as it was practiced on a day-by-day basis (relying, of course, on cases that had been successfully solved).

This set is a public domain collection from Echo Bridge, so we can't expect much in the way of quality. The authoring is pretty sloppy, with 12 episodes on one disc and only 4 chapter stops total(!), and the other ten episodes split up between two sides of the second disc although at least on that disc each episode gets a single chapter stop (better than none). Also, one episode, ""The Big Confession"" is erroneously labeled ""The Big Frank"" on the DVD case and disc menu. (""The Big Frank"" is not in this set.) I don't know what it would take to get the original copyright owner to remaster the entire 1950s series and release it properly. I'd spring for it. I'm just glad I got to see these episodes. They were quite a revelation.",1381881600,4,5677,4.771108850457782
1653424,3,B00005R1N2,"I grew up watching Dragnet when I was a kid and have enjoyed collecting watching the old black and white episodes from the 1950-1959.  The one problem is that prior to his death, Jack Webb sold all the master prints.  If you get any of the collections you are bound to get some of the same  episodes.  There was a pretty good dose of repeated episodes in this collection, so beware what you buy.  Also time hasn't been kind to some of the prints, depending on the source.",1374883200,7,471,4.306818181818182

1653434,5,B00005R1N2,"This is a review of the Dragnet DVD box set produced by Madacy Entertainment. It is copyrighted 2006 and can still be purchased new from Amazon.com, and both new and used from Amazon Marketplace sellers.

This set comes in a colorful, embossed tin box. Inside is a well-made, fold-out holder with five DVDs. Each DVD contains five Dragnet episodes from the 1950's for a total of 25 episodes. The picture and sound quality of each episode is above average. Keep in mind that these public domain Dragnet episodes are not TCM quality, so you will see some scratches and imperfections on each film.  But, for the most part, these classic episodes are easy to watch.

Unlike most bargain bin  collections of Dragnet's early public domain episodes, this set is certainly a cut above the rest, and it is evident that Madacy put some time and effort into this affordable collection.

Also, included is a booklet that contains some great pictures of Jack Webb and the original Dragnet cast from the 1951-59 series. Also, a brief history of Dragnet is presented from it's inception with the 1946 noir cult film ""He Walks By Night"" in which Webb played the part of a police forensic scientist, to Dragnet on radio in 1949, and then to its transition to early television in 1951.

Other reviewers have listed all 25 episodes, so I won't do that here. If you are looking for a nice selection of Dragnet's 1951-59 shows, chances are that you will not be disappointed.",1342224000,16,1453,4.723320158102767
1653435,3,B00005R1N2,"I picked up this particular set in Target for five bucks, which I thought was a pretty good deal for 22 episodes of the 1950's TV Dragnet that appear (based on the package copy) to be two double-sided DVDs, 1 side having 7 episodes and the rest having five each. (This listing claims 4 DVDs, not so!)

It turns out, there are two DVDs, 1 is double-sided and 1 is not. Disc 1 has 12 episodes on it, in four ""movies"" of 3 episodes each, strung together with no breaks and just the titles for a menu. Kinda difficult to pick just one episode to watch that way. Disc 2 both sides have direct-access menus, but all five episodes on them are again strung together in one long ""movie"" (each ep is a chapter). Side 1's menu calls it ""Vol. 3"", side 2 is ""Vol 4"", both have a photo of Jack Webb and different color backgrounds.

Since the 50's Dragnet is in the public domain -- anyone can sell them -- I imagine this could be a repackage of the dollar-store DVDs I've been seeing for years, it would account for the inconsistent appearance of the separate discs.  If so, I overpaid at $5 for what would have been $2 or $3 in dollar-store packaging. But, it was an impulse buy and there are a lot of releases of the 50's series, you could do worse.

Episodes included is identical to this other release :&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragnet-Classics-V-1-4-DVD-Pack/dp/B001M45O9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragnet Classics V. 1 4-DVD Pack</a>&nbsp;(presently more expensive than this one)

Picture and sound quality is about what one would expect from a 1950's TV show; reasonable, but not fantastic, with tape hiss in the audio and scratches on the film. There is a disclaimer about the age and quality at the start of the discs. It's doubtful the original studio would spend money to locate and clean up the masters for these shows, even if there's a market for it, so ""mediocre"" is as good as it gets. Video's not that important for this type of show, anyway, as it's mostly dialogue-driven. The stories themselves are less silly or preachy than the late-60's show, and Friday gets into some fistfights (including a great uppercut in the very first episode here, ""The Big Crime"", where he's stopping a child molester from getting away).

I rated 3 stars: pluses are that it's Jack Webb and Dragnet (which I like), I got it pretty cheap and there's 555 minutes of material (about 9 hours) for my money. Minuses for picture/audio quality and attention to detail (or lack of), and misleading formatting of the episode list on the package.",1338854400,12,2575,4.788288288288288

I learned quite a bit from the insert that was in the box about the show itself and the actors especially Jack Webb.

Some actors & clips are used in multiple episodes in different roles which you will see. Jack Webb is terrific with his acting, dialogue & story lines. The key factor for me is Webb's/Joe Friday is believeable. Friday comes across as the real thing, GREAT! You also get an early performance from future Oscar winner Lee Marvin as a nut killer. Dennis Weaver (""McCloud""), Frances Bavier (""Aunt Bee/Andy Griffith"") & a very young Martin Milner (""Adam 12"") show up. Nice package job & price make this a good set to have.",1222560000,33,687,4.733333333333333

1653442,5,B00005R1N2,"This Dragnet set is a compilation of episodes from the original TV show that ran from 1951 to 1959.  They entered the public domain due to an oversight in maintaining the copyright and now we have a sample of some of those many episodes which have never been released.  The scripts in this series are nearly unmodified radio scripts and the actors were chosen more for their voices and delivery than for their looks.  Each story is based on actual events, making the early Dragnet one of the first ""reality"" shows.

These episodes are much more noir-ish than the later shows that most of us are familiar with.  The show is less pessimistic than most film noir, but still gritty and deliberately realistic.  Jack Webb is outstanding, showing the passion that was robbed from him after filming hundreds of episodes and seeing his career stagnate into one role.  This is a brilliant taste of the original, archetypical cop show, that, as Webb observed, ""was as real as a guy pouring a cup of coffee.""  If you like Dragnet from any era, want to see how it became the much copied and much parodied phenomenon, know how cop shows got started, or just enjoy an outstanding bit of 50s drama, then you should drink a big gulp of Joe Friday and buy this set.",1218672000,56,1248,4.565022421524664

I know the cover art shows Bill Gannon(the great Harry Morgan on the cover but the episodes contained on this set are the ones starring the late Ben Alexander and in a few episodes Herb Ellis(not the guitarist of the same name) as Frank Smith.

1653446,1,B00005R1N2,"Amazon is really starting to annoy me. I've complained about this before, but apparently nobody cares.  When you find this DVD (like many others) on Amazon, there's virtually NO information given about what the disc contains. There's no episode list or season number. I can't even tell if this is from the original TV series or the later episodes with Harry Morgan. Other classic TV shows are even more confusing! It seems odd that we had to wait 50 years for these shows to become available, but even more odd that so many different publishers seem to have the rights to these. Some offer Season One on a single DVD, while others have Volume One instead. Still others collect up what they believe are stand-out episodes and put those together on a DVD.  Then you see things like Season One Part One, or where Seasons One and Two are in a single set, then Season Three comes out by itself as Volume Two.  On rare occasions you can even find a box set called The Complete Series.  What the heck???  Are you TRYING to confuse everyone?  It seems really greedy to me, especially when you break the costs down into Price Per Episode.  There's an unbelievable range when you look at it that way. Then there are the shows where the first season or two is issued, but nothing more ever comes out.  What happened to these?  Why not complete the entire series once you've started it?  My guess is not enough people bought the first one to justify making the next one. That's greedy, folks. Then there are the quality issues. I've seen this said many times in other reviews, but it's worthy of repeating here: If you're going to release old TV shows on DVD -- make them the best possible technical quality you can!  Don't EDIT them.  Don't replace music (because you didn't want to pay for the rights).  Don't use damaged prints or a really cheap transfer process.  Clean them up digitally!  And for God's sake, please don't speed them up so you can cram more onto a single disc!  Have a little respect for the people who created these fine works of art -- and also for those of us who shell out our hard-earned dough to buy them!",1196726400,34,2120,4.481770833333333

1. The Big Show
2. The Big Shoplift
3. The Big Hit-Run Killer
4. The Big Crime
Dragnet focused on the methodical procedures used by the police to solve cases and employed a documentary film approach to tell its stories.  The 1950s black & white version of Dragnet is generally recognized as being superior to the color version that appeared in the late 1960s and was largely based on the radio version of Dragnet that began in the late 1940s.  Although Sgt. Joe Friday (Dragnet creator Jack Webb) had several different partners in the 1950s series, all episodes on this DVD feature Ben Alexander as Officer Frank Smith, arguably Friday's best known partner, and certainly the best known of the 1950s version.
All of the episodes included are in the public domain and so you will find them on other Dragnet DVDs.  However, the episode ""The Big Crime"" is tougher to find than the others and deals with the crime of child molestation, which is somewhat surprising to see in a 1950s television series.
The video images and audio from this Alpha Video release are generally good, though the episode ""The Big Show"" has some print damage in the early goings.  Expect to see some film speckles and the occasional scratches on each of the episodes.  That said, this is a decent release for fans of the original Dragnet television series.",1049932800,34,1454,4.7312252964426875

The episodes are full of print scratchs, blurry vision, poor sound, well you get the point......just awful.  They may try to pass this off as age of material which is crazy.  They are bad because no one took the time to clean up the original film before transfering them to tape.  And worse.....they are using the same transfer material from their VHS tapes to put out their DVD version.  They were so lazy they didn't even take time to cut out the ""break marks"" (These are indications to TV stations to ""place commercial here"").  I wish companies that put this kind of garbage would just go out of business and I truly wish companies like AMAZON.COM would be encouraged not to even offer such poor quality.
