8456670,5,B0054GOO9S,"I really cannot put into words how fantastic this DVD is. If you are an old time Championship Wrestling from Florida fan and Eddie Graham was your hero like me this DVD will fullfill ALL your expectations and more. For 3 hours we listen to the late Mike Graham all the while wondering WHY WHY did Eddie, Mike & Mikes son ALL commit suicide by shooting themselves. Mike's graphic discription of how Eddie REALLY died is shocking. And as expected so much inside information on WCW,WWE, & the NWA. Inside information on stars like Chris Benoit, Lex Lugar,Dusty & Dustin Rhodes, Scott Hall, Ric Flair and many more. This is what you've been waiting for all these years. And now with Mike gone this is his final words.",1376179200,,713,4.578125
