2126958,3,B0002VJHG0,"""Les Mysterieuses Cites D'Or"" is the French way of saying ""Mysterious Cities of Gold"".  The title is in French because the soundtrack is in French...there is no English soundtrack anywhere on this release.  Be warned, because this important information is not mentioned anywhere in the listing.  It shouldn't be a surprise, though, because ImaVision is a Canadian company that produces Little House On The Prairie for USA in English, but all of their other releases are French Canadian.  If you speak French fluently and enjoy this classic animated cartoon, then you'll surely enjoy this release.  If you don't speak French, then be careful about buying it.",1121990400,16,657,5.160377358490566

2126986,5,B0002VJHG0,"'The Mysterious Cities of Gold' is a Japanese-French animation series. Set in 1532, the story follows the adventures of a young Spanish boy named Esteban who joins a voyage to Peru in search of the lost cities of gold and his father who has gone missing there. On his way, he and his friends set examples in honesty, courage and generosity which we can only applaud. Thanks to the creators of this series, we can all sail with Esteban and his friends through the treacherous Straits of Magellan; visit strange creatures of Galapagos Islands; marvel over the breath-taking beauty of Macchu Picchu; fly on a condor over Amazon rainforest; flee the marauding soldiers of Francisco Pizzaro and have wonderful adventures in an exotic realm.",1404777600,,735,4.935483870967742

2126988,5,B0002VJHG0,This cartoon series is what inspired me to travel to study South American history and travel to Peru as an adult.  Now I am buying the series to share with my children in the hopes the enjoy it as much as I did and learn from it as I did! The cartoon and the characters were both well drawn.  Every time I go back and watch I find new things each time. Definitely worth buying on DVD!,1397520000,,384,3.9740259740259742
2126989,5,B0002VJHG0,This is such a great series.  I saw it 30 years ago on TV when I was a kid.  Bought it for my 11 year old and he loved it too.  It is very family oriented and has good history lessons about Latin America.  Would recommend it for anyone who likes adventures and history.  I hope they come up with a sequel soon like I read on Wikepedia that they were going to!,1394582400,,359,3.863013698630137

2126995,5,B0002VJHG0,"I watched a bootleg version of this before the DVDs came out, it seemed like the producers forgot about it in the early 2000s. In many countries they stopped showing it after the 1980s and there was no way to buy this series on VHS. If you compare most anime with this cartoon, it's like going from eating dog food to eating at a 5 star resturant in Paris. The visuals, music, plot and characters are superior in so many ways, even for a 1980s cartoon.

The new series that's coming out looks really good as well and it's a good break from all the plotless, over the top, moe anime crap that's cursed the modern world.",1374192000,,618,4.282051282051282

2126997,5,B0002VJHG0,"The Mysterious Cities of Gold. A unique show, a French-written, Japanese animated story about a young Spanish boy brought to the New World by a group of conquistadors trying to find El Dorado. It feels sort of like an Indiana Jones story set in the 1500's with mild science fiction elements.

I'm happy and surprised at how well it holds up. The Spanish are portrayed as greedy and brutal, the Inca are portrayed in a sympathetic light. Tao, who looks like he would normally be the comedy relief is actually the smartest of the group, a descendant of the lost race of Hiva. The complicated feelings Esteban has for Mendoza (who is both a father-figure and a villain) is deeper than you would normally find in a kids show. I also appreciated that the children in the show were voiced by actual children, rather than adults. And the music is to die for.

The discs have a few extras. Nothing outstanding. I wish the video had been remastered. A couple of the episodes were noticeably darker than the rest. But really, the fact that the show has been released on DVD at all is a miracle. I would rate this set at five stars even without any extras.

Highly, highly recommended. They don't make kids shows like this anymore.",1370822400,,1220,4.561643835616438
2126998,5,B0002VJHG0,"Not only are the cities mysterious, for a long time in my mind the show itself was mysterious. I always had a memory that as a child I saw a show about cities of gold. In my mind, I was 7, 8, or 9 roughly. I remember there was an anime type show (before any of us knew what anime was) about three children who ran around South America looking for lost cities while being constantly chased by dumb villains. Along the way, they used a giant solar-powered flying bird and a solar-powered ship. It was only on for one or two seasons. It was one of very few shows I remembered that had an actual ""end"" to it.

Until the rise of YouTube, Wikipedia, etc., I wasn't even sure that my memory was true. Did this show really exist? The only reassurance I had was that one time my friend told me that he remembered the same thing on Nickelodeon.

Until one day, I found a clip on YouTube.

Memories flooded back in a bizarre and slightly emotional ""It's real!"" type way. That theme is both haunting and epic. I dare you to find anything that good in the last 15 years. I had been very anxious to get the set on DVD, waiting until it became halfway affordable. I logged on to Amazon a few weeks ago and grabbed it for about $21, eligible for free shipping -- you can't beat that!

I have watched the first 11 episodes and I love it! My twin 4-year-old boys do, too! They are constantly talking about it and asking questions, even humming the theme song from time to time. What a great father-son bonding experience! For this price, why would you not buy it?

Before buying, I saw a small handful of critical reviews relating to the quality of the DVD's. Really? What were they expecting? This is a Japanese produced French language show dubbed into English from the very early 80's. I have no problem with the quality. I have no problem with the sound -- in fact, I like it. I feel exactly like I'm watching Nickelodeon 25 years ago. Sure, it's 80's quality, but that's the way it's SUPPOSED to be - it's fine... there is no loss of fidelity, it's just that the fidelity was of a certain style to begin with! I think I'd actually like it less if it was ""touched up"" digitally. (The only, incredibly minor complaint, is that there is no closed captioning available.)

And my 4-year-olds have no complaints, either!",1369872000,9,2301,4.351981351981352
2127019,5,B0002VJHG0,Finally this is out on DVD. I remember this show when I was a kid and couldn't wait to get home to see it. It was surprising to see it on Amazon. I don't know how I missed it!,1369785600,,175,3.5128205128205128
2127020,5,B0002VJHG0,"An older animation series that I missed as a kid, glad I found it as an adult.  Has a great story and long enough to keep you entertained for a good many days.  There was something funny going on with the DVD that I figure I should mention.  It is nothing serious, basically (at least with my copy) when I try skipping ahead through the opening parts where the company's all show off their names and such before you get to the main menu, it will not skip ahead it will just keep repeating the company logo bit.  again nothing to worry over, just let it all play out with out skipping and you will make it to the main menu.",1368921600,,622,4.115702479338843
2127021,4,B0002VJHG0,"With all the cartoons kids watch today, this is a refreshing blast from the past with a small bit of educational value.

2127040,5,B0002VJHG0,"This review is for the set released in October of 2012

I have no real recollection of Mysterious Cities of Gold (MCoG) from when I was younger, but I did remember the theme song.  And I am very glad I did, because it led me to discover this gem of a series.  I am through the first disc and halfway through the second and I am very pleased with this series.  Especially for the roughly $26 I paid for it!

6 discs with roughly 7 episodes each is a lot of cartoons.  I have so far watched the first disc and half of the second.  The animation is perhaps a little dated, but I don't have any complaints about the quality of the visuals or the sound.  However, I went in expecting to be transported back to my childhood watching Nickelodeon, so take that for what you will.

Each episode is followed by a brief (few minutes) narration and live action sequence covering some historical aspect of the previous episode.  An example is after the episode where the character of the Governor is introduced, a narrator describes the actual historical figure while showing footage of his statue, drawings of Incan warriors he and his army engaged, and the ruins of Incan villages - except it's more interesting than how I described it.  The footage and narration remind me of The Gods Must Be Crazy in terms of image and sound quality.  It's a very nice change from the ""And knowing is half the battle"" type of cheesy moralizing done at the end of some other shows from the era.

The story itself is engaging, but I didn't expect it to be such a hit in my household.  My 3 1/2 year old son and my wife both love the show and will watch it on their own when I'm not around.  My wife tolerates my anime habit well.  Sometimes she'll even sit with me through an episode of a particularly good series (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Last-Exile-The-Complete-Series/dp/B003VOVW7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Last Exile: The Complete Series</a>, for example), but I don't think she's ever watched one on her own accord - but she will with MCoG.  To me, that speaks volumes about the quality of the MCoG.

The reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars is because I couldn't deduct a half star for the worthless extras.  At least for the first disc, it was a few silent clips that were cut from the final release and a few production sketches.  Perhaps some people will like the sketches, but they did not add anything for me.  However, the set does come with a book that summarizes each episode and has a brief bio of the major characters (and there are quite a few).  This is well done, but I don't want to read it until I'm through the series for fear of spoilers!

Overall, I am VERY pleased with being able to snag MCoG on the cheap and I am excited to share the series with my family.

I'll update the review after finishing the set...but don't hold your breath.

12/2012 update: My family and I finished the series.  It was very good.  My son loves it and asks for it all the time now.  I've bumped up my rating to 5 stars.  There is one extra that interviews the voice actors for Mendoza, Tao, Zia, and Esteban.  We haven't bothered to check the rest of the extras out since we wanted to finish the series.",1351468800,3,3227,4.504302925989673
2127041,1,B0002VJHG0,"This series is an absolute classic make no mistake, but what VCI has done with this is so crazy it borders on lunacy. They have taken a series which was previously released on dual layer discs(the runtime on each disc goes way beyond the 3 hour mark in total) and looks fairly good, and crammed it onto 6 single layer dvd5's. The result? Awful 1-3mbps video bitrate, and HEAPS of compression/artefacting issues to add to the already old look of the show.

A total poster child for how not to treat animation on dvd, and a god awful effort from this firm VCI.

I am an international buyer from the UK, and i only bought this NTSC R1 version to avoid NTSC-PAL conversion issues, but honestly i wish i hadnt bothered as at least the UK set come on dual layer discs with proper video bitrates, and from what i can tell better video detail aside from that too.

Hugely dissapointing.",1349395200,34,878,4.440993788819876
2127042,5,B0002VJHG0,"In sheer terms of imagination, animation, depth, wonder, and spark..... MCOG shines bright. As epic as Robotech, the scale is enormous, and it's a fun ride!

There are shows and films that deserve attention, and there are ones that are just legendary. Without a doubt, you are looking at one of the treasures of the 20th century. It's implausible to think of a world where this show is not relevant, preeminent, and essential.

Even when you think it can't get any cooler, it does. And does not disappoint. Please honor yourself and check this series out.

5 big stars. AMAZING!!",1327363200,,579,4.77
2127043,3,B0002VJHG0,"The content: this was a great series. I watched it with my younger siblings after school back in the '80s. Much nostalgia here. That is preserved.

The box says ""fully restored picture &sound."" Don't believe it. I have both the NTSC Region 1 and the PAL Region 2 sets. While the NTSC version has much reduced noise and grain, it has much lower detail as well. Additionally the telecine process they used is way off so any modern playback device will get a bit confused. Every mistake you could make mastering these DVDs was made. Crushed blacks, bad cadence, ham-fisted noise reduction. It's a poster child for how not to master animation on DVD.

If you care about video fidelity as well as nostalgia then get the Region 2 discs, assuming you have a way and know how to play them of course.

Five Stars for the content
One Star for the mastering quality
So: three star rating.",1308960000,10,877,4.537974683544304

Now i can rewatch and complete the story.
They also include the feature mini documentaries that go with the story. Hours of fun. ( literallty, this thing is over 50 episodes of half an hour each... if this was a feature film it would be more than 24 hours long ! )",1298419200,,369,3.933333333333333
2127045,5,B0002VJHG0,"Back in the 80's my sibling and I would watch this during the summer, or if we were home from school for various reasons... It seemed like Nick was sketchy about when the show would air, as we were never able to see the entire arc... still we loved this show.  I had been tempted by the bootleg offers here and there over the years, but wanted a real legitimate DVD of these, so never purchased those. Finally Hulu began hosting episodes.  I watched the first two with my kids and knew that I had to buy the entire series on DVD immediately... Shows are not this good any more, let alone Kids shows.  The lovely wife made me hold this collection until Christmas, but on that day we started watching this as a family.  We are one full disk (7 episodes) in and it is great.  The kids love it, are learning a bit about central American mythology and history and enjoying a great show.  Deeper characters and stories than you find elsewhere.  My 9 year old loves that there is some ambiguity over who is good and bad... she reads lots of books and the typical Good/Bad dynamic of most children's shows is simple and somewhat boring.  While certainly a chidren's show, this is deeper and more story and character oriented that most. It is fun and even if you didn't grow up watching it, it is a wonderful series.
I am finally getting to see the rest of the episodes I didn't when I was a kid, and also introducing my children to one of the best anime shows ever created.",1293408000,2,1465,4.321167883211679

2127047,5,B0002VJHG0,"Note: I've recently heard of consistent defect problems in these sets and was horrified enough to check them out; here is what I've found.  I've checked out 3 different sets on the same DVD player:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SONY-SX910-Multi-System-Zone-All-Region-Free-DVD-Blu-Ray-Player-100-240V-50-60Hz-World-Wide-Voltage/dp/B00SHTYRCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SONY SX910 Multi System Zone All Region Free DVD Blu-Ray Player - 100~240V 50/60Hz World Wide Voltage</a>.  One had no errors in ANY of the items from main feature to extras, and I checked them all, but two of them had errors in the exact same place: disc 3, episode 16: The Urubus, when Lana meets her father again as he responds to her call on the shore of Lake Titicaca.  In both cases play comes to a halt.  To me this confirms that the defect exists, is identical, but is not present in all cases, and it gives you something to check upon first arrival.  Please let me know if you hear of any variations.

Frankly, I'd argue that this is one of the best adventure serials ever made, period, but at the very least it is unquestionably the best paced.  I love adventure serials, but one of my pet peeves with the format is the all too common poor pacing, especially in quest serials.  What I mean by that is that you need only watch the first episode or two, the last episode or two, and occasionally one or two critical episodes in between in order to know the whole story, to see all the mysteries resolved.  Most of the episodes, however well written, are filler or red herrings that are not important to the telling of the main story.

In contrast not a single episode in this serial is wasted.  Every episode sees an important clue discovered or deciphered, an important lock unlocked, an important tool acquired or learned more about, an important piece of knowledge obtained, an important ally won or a dangerous enemy thwarted, a significant character development or team building exercise, or at the very least, significant physical progress being made on a journey stretching from Barcelona to the land of the Incas to the Amazon jungle to the land of the Mayas.  Even the interlude among the Amazons, arguably the least important to advancing the main storyline, results in them figuring out how to power up a vital tool when it gets shielded from the Sun by the jungle canopy and discovering and deciphering the purpose of another example of advanced Hivan technology.

It is the 16th Century, and everyone it seems is looking for the mysterious cities of gold.  Unsatisfied with the wealth he has stolen from the Incas, Francisco Pizarro is seeking them, and he even has an important clue, the Golden Quipu, which supposedly reveals their location.  Unfortunately he hasn't yet been able to, uh, ""persuade"" any Incas to decipher it for him.  However, for some reason (perhaps because he finally realized who her father was) he now believes that the Inca girl he once gave as a ""pet savage"" to the Spanish royal family can read it and can be more easily ""persuaded"" to read it than an adult.  So he has secretly sent Senior Gomez and Captain Perez of the Esperanza back to Barcelona to retrieve the now 11-year-old Zia.  Explanations would take time and might not be persuasive so they have decided just to kidnap her.  However, sneaking into the royal palace is not something a prudent man does when he can hire a reckless man to do it for him, and as everyone knows, Mendoza, the navigator, ""will do anything for gold.""  No need to tell him the real reason, though.

But Mendoza already knows.  If he didn't know before, he knew as soon as he saw the medallion of the Sun Zia wears.  He found an identical medallion around the neck of the baby boy he saved by insanely swimming to the rescue from Magellan's round-the-world expedition at the height of a Pacific storm over a decade earlier.  He stole the Sun part of that medallion at the time and has since come to believe it is connected with the cities of gold.  In Barcelona Mendoza runs into that boy now 12 who hears the same story from his foster father on his deathbed, and Mendoza after producing the stolen medallion in order to establish his bona fides, offers to sneak the boy onboard the Esperanza and take him to the New World in search of adventure, his possibly still living father, and perhaps even the cities of gold.  With no remaining ties to Spain, Esteban agrees, hoping to find his father or at least learn who and what he is.  In the hold of the Esperanza the two children discover each other, become fast friends, and realize that their identical medallions arguably somehow link their origins and probably link their fates.

That's just the first episode.  After this things start to get complicated.

One of the best parts about this serial is the intricate character interactions.  True, everybody is searching for the same cities of gold but for widely differing stated reasons with widely differing true motives and with widely differing extremes they are willing to go to in order to get what they want.  Amongst an army (or several) of brutal treasure hunters, Mendoza stands out for his refusal to harm the children in the apparent belief that if he follows them around long enough and helps them out long enough, eventually they will come to trust him...

or at least let something important slip.  Esteban, who grew up Spanish and owes both his life and the opportunity to tag along to him, tolerates Mendoza more than Zia, who'd gladly never see another Spaniard for the rest of her life, but even she gradually realizes that there is merit in a person who insists on keeping you alive and unharmed even if it is for all the wrong reasons, in hopes that you will eventually become useful to him.  It is all fine and dandy to dismiss Mendoza's help amongst Incans who treat you like a national hero, but amongst other ""peoples"" who would sacrifice you to their gods or dismember you in order to harvest your young and healthy cells, a competently treacherous Spaniard and his two loyal imbeciles (loyal precisely because they realize they ARE imbeciles who'd stand no chance on their own) make a nice ace in the hole.  (Mendoza's treachery tour de force, which involves switching sides twice, has to be seen to be believed, including the climax when Esteban schools the teacher.)  A lot of fun is also had with the differing approaches to problem solving between Tao, a 13-year-old Hivan boy who joins up later and Esteban.  A scholar and an inventor, Tao prefers to carefully plan his moves when lives are on the line while Esteban is inclined to trust to luck and just wing it.  This leads to a great deal of trouble between the two, especially when Esteban's recklessness succeeds beyond all reason!

Only VERY loosely based upon Scott O'Dell's second novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-King-s-Fifth/dp/0618747834/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The King's Fifth</a>, this serial significantly alters that novel's premise by tossing into the mix all of the wildest and most radical theories regarding the mysteries of pre-Columbian South and Central America, including lost civilizations, highly advanced technology, and the lost continent of Mu (Hiva).  Watching this series when it was first shown on Nickelodeon even lead me to purchase and read the then new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-Cities-and-Ancient-Mysteries-of-South-America-Lost-Cities-Series/dp/093281302X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost Cities and Ancient Mysteries of South America (Lost Cities Series)</a>, and I was astonished to learn how much of this serial was based upon existing theories.  I contacted the Illinois-based author, one thing lead to another, and we ended up meeting and exchanging copies of videotapes, for my part receiving my first look at the somewhat overwrought but nevertheless amazing movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MacKenna-s-Gold/dp/B00004TJJU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MacKenna's Gold</a>, based upon the famous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-Dutchman-Mine/dp/0966209184/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost Dutchman Mine</a>.

Defects?  Only the occasional nitpick.  English subtitles would have been nice as would the French and Japanese soundtracks with their own English subtitles for comparison.  (I'm curious to know what changes were made now that I know some changes WERE made.)  A musical soundtrack CD would have been another nice to have since the original soundtrack album is long gone and out of print.

One of the nice things about these DVD's for fans who only watched the show on Nickelodeon is that the missing live action documentary segments have been restored.  These short educational features, included because the series was targeted at public education TV channels, often explained the facts or in some cases the theories behind the plot devices used in that episode: the Nazca lines, the lost continent of Mu (Hiva in this show), the Amazons, etc.  Fittingly, the documentary segment on the last episode ends with the mysterious disappearance in 1925 of renowned British explorer Col. Percy Harrison Fawcett who vanished while seeking to find&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lost-City-of-Z/dp/1400078458/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lost City of Z</a>.

Note: Be sure and unfold and check out the poster that comes with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DELUXE-EDITION/dp/B001QKB2XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">(DELUXE EDITION)</a>&nbsp;but not until after you've watched the serial at least once.  Why?  Because on the back of the poster is a map of the whole expedition, including the named locations of all the important places.  It should clear up some mysteries, like the true location of Pizarro's Fort.

Among the extras included on the DVD's, the most interesting to me was the interview with co-creator Jean Chalopin, which revealed among other things that these 39 episodes were originally intended to be the first season of a seven year long serial that would have had the heroes seeking out each of the seven lost cities of gold all around the world.  The second year was to be set in China, the third in Japan, then on to Africa and Southeast Asia, but the first series wasn't financially successful enough to attract enough funding.  Recently Mr. Chalopin got&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mysterious-Cities-Of-Gold-Season-2-The-Adventure-Continues/dp/B00GYW2JNE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mysterious Cities Of Gold - Season 2: The Adventure Continues</a>&nbsp;made, but it has not yet been released over here; however, if you have something that can play all regions DVD's and Blu-rays (I use and can highly recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SONY-SX910-Multi-System-Zone-All-Region-Free-DVD-Blu-Ray-Player-100-240V-50-60Hz-World-Wide-Voltage/dp/B00SHTYRCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SONY SX910 Multi System Zone All Region Free DVD Blu-Ray Player - 100~240V 50/60Hz World Wide Voltage</a>), you can play this British version.

Pros:
1.  The series is awesome.

It is narrated very, very well throughout the whole edition.
The episodes are clearly made to teach morals and are fun to watch. I remember watching them in the 1980's, that's why I bought them to show my daughter and help her to learn some history of another part of the world.

2127084,5,B0002VJHG0,"Did you watch the Mysterious Cities of gold as a child?  I saw this cartoon series back in 1986 at the age of 6.  I loved in the first time as a kid, and I'm thoroughly enjoying re-watching the episodes as an adult.

This cartoon was originally done in French, and was then dubbed in English by Canadian actors.  It's about three children, one Spanish, another Incan, and a third from a different South American tribe and their search with three Spaniards for the mysterious cities of gold.  It's fantastically entertaining, especially if you have any interest in South American history.

If you have children and are looking for an educational cartoon, I think MCOG is an excellent choice.  I remember becoming interested in the Incas and in the Spanish led by Pizarro after watching this cartoon.  Each episode has an education segment afterwards.  Some of the segments seem a bit out of date and even inaccurate at times, but they will no doubt pique a child's interest to learn more.

The extras that come with the series are stellar.  There are interviews with the actors and all kinds of information about the original creation of the series and the English dubbing.",1244419200,3,1172,4.752475247524752

When I was young I enjoyed it but watching it as an adult I realize I missed a lot of what was going on and enjoy the details even more!

This DVD set is great, I would say there is no need to buy the more expensive deluxe set. This comes with a booklet containing a synopsis of each episode along with descriptions of all the characters. (Even minor ones like Father Rodriguez and Apu.) Also, each episode on the DVD comes complete with episode review, episode preview and the documentaries!! The documentaries were a surprise since Nickelodeon didn't even air those when they were originally broadcast.

This release spreads 39 episodes out between 6 discs. Each episode is presented along with its original, corresponding documentary. Additionally, there are DVD exclusives on each disc. The features are engaging, although it would've been nice to segregate the extras to disc 6, making it easier to find them!

Also, it is true that there are no other language options or subtitles on this disc. This is a little disappointing, as the documentary on the voice-over acting discusses the differences between the french and english translations frequently, making me wish I could hear some of the original french!

Yet, despite my criticisms, this box truly is very very good.

CMR's release is inferior, as it has no liner notes and no extra features. Nor does it have subtitles or other language features.

So, while I have rated the MCoG Deluxe Edition as 4/5 stars, a more precise rating is 9/10. The one point reduction is due solely to the lack of language and subtitle options. Otherwise, this set is an excellent purchase. It is well worth the price, and fans of the show will love it!",1241913600,22,1787,5.656716417910448

Along the way, they encounter friendly and not so friendly natives, technological wanders from a land long lost, and of course greedy, bloodthirsty Spaniards who stop at nothing to reach the Cities of Gold and plunder them of their wealth.

The Mysterious Cities of Gold has long been one of the deepest treasures of my childhood.  Everything from the characters, the storytelling, and the themes envolved come together to form in my opinion one of the last great masterpieces of the 20th Century.

Accompanying them on their adventures is the brave Spaniard Mendoza, and his loyal, but cowardly croonies, Pedro and Sancho.

This anime masterpiece was brought together through the smart minds of both France and Japan, legendary producer Jean Chalopin (Heathcliff and Inspector Gadget) and the famous music collabo Haim Saban and Shuki Levy.

The subplots all find their ways into the main conflicts, the anime is spectacular and the music is both catchy and breathtaking.  For a little trivia, a few pieces of the music scores (the danger suite and the anticipation theme) were featured in another cartoon, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, a year later in 1984.

The lack of other languages is a negative, but not enough to cost a star in my review. I think there must have been some issues with obtaining the French dialogue or something. The series was not released here in Canada which is odd for a North American release and I assume it has something to do with the lack of French dialogue since everything here is obliged to be bilingual.

I didn't notice an option to watch the series without the mini documentaries after each episode, but I don't mind since the docs are so 80's cool.
The post cards are super cute but not overly special and the poster, while pretty, is permanently marred by folding creases. Oh well. Bonus booklet is very nice.

This is an amazing show. Its clever, beautiful, funny, full of adventure and discovery... And you learn real life things in every episode (or after, during the wonderfully 80's mini documentaries). This will be the show I raise my children on, not that ADD causing waste of time bologna they push on innocent young minds today. Thank you for FINALLY making this show available in North America!

2127133,5,B0002VJHG0,"After 20 years of waiting, its finally here.

The Mysterious Cities of Gold is a show most of children would have seen on Nickelodeon in the mid-80's.  A rare collaboration between French writers and Japanese animators (overseen by none other than Hayao Miyazaki himself), it combined strong characters with rich artwork, and set it all in a more or less historically accurate 15th century Meso-America.  39 episodes in length, this series tells one continuous story, told primarily from the viewpoint of the show's three main child characters.

Along their journey, these children demonstrate the virtues of love, friendship, kindness, and self-sacrifice, without any of the artificial constructs normally placed into such stories.  They learn and grow, becoming deeper, more mature people as they explore and come in contact with real South American cultures, which are painted in a positive light.  The primary antagonists are the invading Spaniards, seeking to look the new world's gold for their own profit.

From a decade where everything was a glorified half-hour toy commercial, the Mysterious Cities of Gold stood out due to it's emphasis on story telling and character development.  And, unlike other series of it's time, when the story ends, so does the series.  No attempt was made to milk this show for every last penny, it has a definite start, middle, and end, so there is a tangible sense of completion and satisfaction upon completing your viewing.

In addition, each episode contained, at the end, a brief history lesson about the real world versions of items and places visited by the characters in that episode.  These were cut from various non-English versions of the series, but are here in full educational glory.

Never before released on video (either VHS or DVD) in America before now, and filled with great extras, this is something that should not be missed.  For those of us that grew up watching the adventures of Esteban, to a whole new generation of children that have never experienced a cartoon of this caliber, you simply cannot go wrong here.
