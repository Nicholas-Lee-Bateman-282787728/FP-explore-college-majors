720224,5,6303625967,"I watched this movie when I was growing up and it is a great early 90's movie - the clothes, the ""cool"" words and hair styles!  Its a great ""back in the day"" movie.  I recommend it to anyone who remembers ""Urkel"" or ""DJ"" from Full House or even ""Winnie Cooper"" from The Wonder Years!

Definitely 5 stars!",1155686400,3,304,4.206896551724138
720225,3,6303625967,I had remembered seeing this movie on tv as a kid. This moive is filled with former abc sitcom stars. Jennifer Aniston before friends was just as atractive then as she is now if not more.,1138665600,3,187,4.222222222222222
720226,5,6303625967,This was my favourite movie when I was growing up - watched it 1000 times. I live in New Zealand and the DVD still plays in our machines (I was told it wouldn't). BUY IT - YOU WILL LOVE IT!,1120176000,4,189,3.75

7854015,5,6303625967,This movie used to come on every summer on network television. I would watch it each and every time. I loved this movie so much I bought it as an adult. Some things never get old; Don't judge me. :),1388361600,8,198,3.975

7854017,5,6303625967,"I saw it when I was a kid, so the nostalgia factor keeps this movie good in my eyes. Just a light movie about kids at a summer camp. Lots of clichs and stereotypes, but it's fun. Plus all your favorite early 90s child stars will be there.",1383868800,6,238,3.9791666666666665

7854020,5,6303625967,"If there was a movie of the late 80's/early 90's this was it.  This movie had actors/actresses from every hit show at that time.  DJ (full-house), Chad Allen (Our House), the Urkle kid (Family Matters), Brian Robbins or Eric (Head of the Class) and countless more.  This movie was filled with stars.  My sister and I used to wait yearlong to see this movie when they played it once every year growing up and then they stopped showing it.  I am glad they brought it back on dvd.",1237766400,4,477,4.375
7854021,4,6303625967,"First of all, the cast is awesome. John Ratzenberger, Jennifer Aniston pre-nose job, Danica McKellar, Breckin Meyer, Jaleel White, Candace Cameron Bure- you don't get much more 90s that this cast! I remember watching this movie with my sister all the time when we were younger, but then the VHS was misplaced. That rap... oh my. Too funny! And, this is actually quite family friendly, despite the lothario after Jenniger Aniston's character and the occassional innuendo- most will go right over kid's heads.",1237507200,16,507,5.120481927710843
7854022,5,6303625967,OH MY GOD!!!!!  I have been searching for this movie for at least 5 years!  Turns out I was spelling Cucamonga wrong.  I haven't seen this movie for at least a decade and it was one of my absolute favorites growing up.  I highly recommend it to everyone who's a fan of the cheesy 80's!,1180483200,,285,4.127272727272727
7854023,5,6303625967,"I remember when I first watched this movie when it came out, I was only around 11 years old and I absolutely loved it.  I taped it and watched it a lot.  When I saw that it was released on DVD I was excited because I had not seen it in a long time.  I highly recommend this movie because I still found that it was highly entertaining.  I think a big part of its entertainment value for me rests on that it brought me back to my childhood.  I think that children will love this movie as I did.  This movie is the reason I decided to go to camp when I was younger.  I recommend this movie to everyone but especially kids around 10-13 years old I think that they would really enjoy it.",1173312000,4,682,3.9705882352941178
