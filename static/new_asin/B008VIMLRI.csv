5185156,5,B008VIMLRI,"Love it,Love it,Love it. This is a gem of a show that stills shines brilliantly today. I remember growing up with this show and this DVD brings back such precious and youthful memories. I don't why some idiot at a network station has not put this in syndication. Today's generation needs clean,wholesome and hearffelt humor and family values badly. I can't wait for the next season.",1392854400,,382,4.803030303030303

5185160,4,B008VIMLRI,"Arnold and Willis are back for another season of one of televisions most memorable sitcoms!
During this 1981-82 Season, Arnold (Gary Coleman) lands in trouble with the law when he tries to join the Goochs private club, Willis (Todd Bridges) sues the basketball team when he is replaced by another player, Kimberly (Dana Plato) goes on a forbidden weekend skiing trip and Philip. Drummond (Conrad Bain) learns of a love child he had while serving in the Korean War!

One of the true classics from the golden era of TV sitcoms, DIFF'RENT STROKES focused heavily on family values, social issues and big laughs throughout it's whole 8-year run.

This 1981-1982 Season of DIFF'RENT STROKES takes me all the way back to memory lane to when I was 9 years old in the 3rd grade & was shown on NBC every Thursday night at 8PM before QUINCY, M.E. at 9PM and when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was president.",1389830400,,967,4.616279069767442
5185161,5,B008VIMLRI,My Son is in love with this show aside that I told him that this was one of my favorite shows when I was his age.  He keeps on telling me that the shows now a days suck and that he loves watching 80's shows. I couldn't say it better myself.,1388361600,,240,3.7058823529411766
5185162,4,B008VIMLRI,"This show was much better than I thought... So where is Season 5??? How am I supposed to get to season 6, where Michael knight of Knight Rider is in a two parter with k. I.T.T. at Universal Studios??? My favorite two episodes.  Here's the catch... I will not purchase season 5 until I see season 6 released.  I will live with the first four seasons.  Dana Plato was fired after season 6, and her death years later was very sad.  She was very pretty and had a future, if she tried harder.",1386806400,2,487,4.204301075268817
5185163,5,B008VIMLRI,"The continuation of this great family sitcom is awesome. My 12 year old son is requesting all seasons by the end of the year. He is laughing as hard as I did when I saw it in the 80's. Arnold, Willis, Kimberly and Mr. Drummond will forever be part of our family.",1380758400,,262,4.0576923076923075

5185165,5,B008VIMLRI,"I love, do you hear me, loved this show when I was growing up. Just watching this show on DVD definitely brings back some good childhood memories. Just wish the kids had better lives outside the show, but that's the magic of television, where you can just sit back and escape. I remember this was the show when I first developed a crush on Janet Jackson when she played Charlene DuPrey, Willis' longtime girlfriend. I also had a crush on Dana Plato. Being able to see her each week was my main reason for tuning in. I hope 'Shout! factory' continues to release the remaining seasons.",1373587200,6,583,4.509433962264151

5185167,5,B008VIMLRI,"In ""Diff'rent Strokes - The Complete Fourth Season"", the original cast returns, including Dody Goodman returning as the charming & eccentric Aunt Sophia. The serious subject matter blends in quite well with the comedy in episodes such as ""Health Club"", where Willis & Arnold are denied entry into Mr. Drummond's exclusive club, & in the episode titled ""Crime Story"" - a two-parter with Arnold & Dudley being bullied by two schoolyard thugs in giving up their school lunches. Willis escorts girlfriend Charlene in Mr. D's limousine in ""The Car"" & Arnold fears for Mr. D's safety in the episode ""Dreams"". Willis acquires a service station job in ""Lifesavers"", & Drummond learns he has a son whom he never met in ""Hello Daddy"". This fourth season is worth watching, where the viewer can learn many a life lesson through successive viewings while picking up many a laugh all the while. After all, in spite of the serious subject matter contained herein, this is still a sitcom the entire family can view together. Make this season of ""Diff'rent Strokes"" a must-have on your priority shopping list ASAP!

5185168,3,B008VIMLRI,"The writing & directing went downhill after the second season.  If not for Gary Coleman, I'd rate it only two stars.  The subject matter & issues became serious, & that's not why viewers liked this show.",1363824000,,203,4.611111111111111

I watched these in first-run as well as syndication. The episodes are all great, and it's nice to see Janet Jackson as Willis' girlfriend.
