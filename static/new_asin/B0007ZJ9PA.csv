8054803,5,B0007ZJ9PA,Incredible. Just how I remember seeing it at the movies. This dvd copy is nice and clear compared to others that had grainy video and poor audio,1434672000,,144,4.37037037037037
8054804,1,B0007ZJ9PA,"The Tokyo Shock (Media Blasters) release of The Brave Archer 2 (aka The Brave Archer Part 2) was postponed indefinitely, i.e. it was cancelled and never released. Currently, the best way to view this film is to get the IVL (Celestial) DVD or VCD.",1414540800,4,246,4.613636363636363
8054805,2,B0007ZJ9PA,The movie is copied porly. It keeps going back and forth with different languages. Movie should be reviewed before selling.,1408147200,,123,5.2
8054806,4,B0007ZJ9PA,"The movie started off slow but quickly brought the action! Once the training started everything else flowed right along. This movie was better than the first one! Now remember the title means nothing, it had nothing to do with the story, nor any of the action! It may be part of a series but the stories change. Its a good movie to watch or rent.",1239667200,,346,4.338461538461538
8054807,3,B0007ZJ9PA,"For those reading this review, this info might be unnecessary but anyhoo; director Chang Cheh, the godfather of HK cinema & screenwriting guru, I Kuang, decided to translate Chin Hung's epic Brave Archer novel to the screen in 1977.  Can't say that I've read the novel, but I did hear it's a sprawling, multi-character, multi-plotted epic so I guess they did the correct thing and break it up into four parts.  I haven't seen the last two, but I did see (and own) the first two installments.  Being a huge Shaw Brothers fan and Chang Cheh completist, even I'll admit that both movies are confusing, it's as if Chang & Kuang were high when they wrote the script.  Characters appear, then disappear; sub-plots are brought up, then forgotten about.  Personally, I don't really care, but I do recommend this series to die-hard genre fans (like myself) only.

Part 2 was given to us by Red Sun (Morgoth has written a lot about them), and they did a fabulous job remastering the picture; blemish free print and 2:35:1 widescreen.  I believe it's uncut at 110 minutes, and this version offers a Mandarin & English soundtrack.  Don't bother with the English channel, it's incomplete & is accompanied by a loud hissing sound that makes it barely audible, flush it.  Stick with the Mandarin version, the subs aren't that bad.  They're in the black bar on the bottom, but sometimes they flash on a bit too fast.

As far as the movie goes, despite some confusion and a slow middle (except Sun Chien's cameo), there is some good fu on display choreographed by Liang Ting, Lu Feng & Robert Tai.  Most of the actors from part 1 are back in character, but I did notice some changes.  The actress who played Fu Sheng's intended (Tien Niu) was replaced.  Also, Kuo Chui & Danny Lee weren't given to do much, and Simon Li hardly had any fighting scenes.  Some of the martial arts was strange magical stuff, like Johnny Wang's ""frog style"".  For me, the meat of the movie comes at the end when Fu Sheng & his girl get captured by the Beggar Clan.  Look for Lu Feng, Chiang Sheng(R.I.P.) & Tu Lung, all playing different roles since they're characters in part 1 died. The end fight between Fu Sheng & Lo Mang (who's character in the Weird Six was replaced by Tan Chun-Tu) was awesome.  I must have rewound that fight like three times in a row, I just wish it was longer.

Like I said, for the completist and hardcore fan.  If you like and enjoy old-school, Shaw Brothers, Chang Cheh, the late Fu Sheng & the Venoms (especially Lo Mang), then you have to own this, case closed.",1204588800,4,2555,4.537117903930131
8054808,3,B0007ZJ9PA,"This movie continues the Brave Archer Movie series of which there are 5. This second one serves mostly to continue the story and there are not as many well choreographed fights as in parts 1 and 3 and 4. As a collector of venom movies or Fu Sheng movies its a must have but don't expect too much. The saddest part for me is all the lost footage that is apparent from the flashbacks in the story. Priceless film left on some cutting room floor in Hong Kong lost to us collectors forever. Oh, this is one of the few films that Wei Pai appears in with the other venoms but if you blink you'll miss his appearance. It's in a flashback of a subplot. This movie's english title ""Kung Fu Warlords"" is so much more appropriate for this classic tale adapted from a famous novel. The first 2 parts are best enjoyed as a marathon.",1204329600,,819,4.256410256410256
8054809,5,B0007ZJ9PA,Completely Uncut! I would like to see more Shaw Brother Classics rereleased By Celestial Pictures! The Brave Archer series is one of the most Bizzare and amazing Kung-Fu movies of all time.,1121644800,2,189,4.9375
