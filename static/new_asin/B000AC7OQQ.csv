8077589,4,B000AC7OQQ,"After seeing all 8 volumes, watching Shima-chan's struggles to be her best and make her dreams come true - I didn't expect a great powerful ending, having been let down by others such as Chrono Crusade,Petite Princess Yucie,Princess Tutu, Kiddy Grade...

This ending shines and extends the story out to where you can imagine far into the future. A great full circle ending that leaves you with no questions and no sadness... Must see series!",1139011200,3,441,4.88
