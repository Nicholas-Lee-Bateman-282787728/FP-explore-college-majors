8574215,5,B00BUUGRME,This DVD is in excellent shape. I was so excited to be able to find this series on Amazon. I used to paint when I was in high school but my paintings were recognized as 'surrealistic'. Now I know that what I had painted then is now called 'inspirational or prophetic' art. My passion can be expressed freely through painted media so that what I 'see' in my mind may help to minister to those in need. I can't wait to see all of the teachings and will order the rest of the series as soon as I am able to get the funds.,1502668800,,518,3.9903846153846154
