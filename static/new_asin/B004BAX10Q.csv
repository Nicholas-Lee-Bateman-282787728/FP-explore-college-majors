8421842,2,B004BAX10Q,"Of all the Disney ""Ape Pen"" DVD's, this is no doubt the WORST !!  Why ?  The narration KILLS this DVD !!!  The film footage is great....but the guy narrating this is ABSOLUTELY THE WORST person they could have ever picked to do so !!  BORING...monotone....dull....pathetic written script, and is as corny as all get out !!  Just AWFUL !!",1437868800,2,337,4.55
