2113088,5,B0002PUGWU,"These DVDs are awesome with some of the mosst amazing scenic cruises in the world.  If I could, I would like to just take off a year and go on each cruise.  However, I will get to each one sooner or later in my lifetime.  You just can't imagine how beautiful these places are until you watch these DVDs.  Very inspiring for someone who wants to travel the world.",1320969600,15,362,4.202898550724638
2113089,4,B0002PUGWU,"VERY GOOD BOOK IF YOU ARE CRUISING THE DIFFERENT ISLANDS IN HAWAII.  THE ONLY THING LAKING WAS MAPS FOR DRIVING TOURS, OTHERWISE VERY COMPLETE AND EASY TO FOLLOW.",1276732800,,162,4.785714285714286
2113090,5,B0002PUGWU,"This beautifully shot and narrated DVD takes you from Nova Scotia to the Rhine River castles, and to the mysteries of Easter Island. We have traveled to many of these places and this DVD urges us to travel even more. For the armchair adventurer to the ""on the go"" adventurer, this DVD is a winner.",1161475200,52,297,4.418181818181818
2113092,5,B0002PUGWU,I enjoy dvd's of travel when I walk on the treadmill or station bike. Winter in the north is no fun and I hate walking out in the snow and cold. This dvd does not show much in the way of being on a cruise ship but was still nice. It isn't something that I would watch for a evening movie but for what I use it for it is great,1394668800,2,325,3.591549295774648
2113093,4,B0002PUGWU,"This video is very enjoyable, and is great for filling the hours on a rainy or snowy day.  My only improvement would be that the video explain or identify more of the things seen in the video, for example the names of birds.",1388966400,,224,4.209302325581396
2113094,5,B0002PUGWU,"having gone on cruises to Alaska, California coast, Mexico, Caribbean, I know that there are other countries that cruises are offered and want to know more, this offered that and more insights.",1388188800,5,193,5.0625
2113095,5,B0002PUGWU,"The Reader's Digest DVDs are an excellent bargain: they include beautiful photography and music. This is one of their best and I was able to receive it in the mail in four days for only $11.44 including shipping. This is typical of the other titles I have purchased from Reader's Digest. My only complaint is that I have only found two titles on Blu-ray. I would like to see more. The DVDs come from Questar, based in Chicago, which is known for its excellent travel videos in the industry.",1383004800,7,490,4.51685393258427
2113096,3,B0002PUGWU,"Saw mostly the boat and water and was hoping to see more land views as though I was taking a cruise and got off in different
locations to see beautiful landscapes !",1382659200,,164,4.15625
2113097,5,B0002PUGWU,I love travel video and this one hit just the right note.  I have already watched it twice and it is in my permanent collection.  Great overview of places I will never get to so it is wonderful to be able to see some of those spots.,1380067200,,232,3.9148936170212765

2113099,5,B0002PUGWU,"Kudos to Reader's Digest for compiling breathtaking Scenic Cruises of the World! Whether you have been there done that or thinking about going on a scenic cruise or wanting to simply enjoy scenic cruises from the comfort of your favorite armchair at home ...this assortment of scenic cruises to more than 20 countries, islands and exotically varied locations will not disappoint you!  It is one long scenic cruise that we will gladly ""go on"" again and again.

2113100,4,B0002PUGWU,"Been to most of these places that were in this DVD. There just as breathtaking on T.V. as in person. The movie or DVD was great,...scenery was breathtaking,...if you haven't done any of this ,...i would suggest,...... go and do at least one of these cruises,...you won't be sorry!!",1355443200,4,281,4.755102040816326
2113101,5,B0002PUGWU,"I loved this DVD, and wish Reader's Digest would make many more like it.  The photography and narration are excellent, and the DVD highlights so many different and fascinating locations.  It has three very long segments, so you get your money's worth.  (I keep it on the TV in my kitchen and watch it over and over as I cook, and I catch my kids watching it as well.)",1336089600,20,367,4.2898550724637685
