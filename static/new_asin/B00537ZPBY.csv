8455043,5,B00537ZPBY,I think that Nim's Island is a wonderful movie for children - to get them thinking about the world we live in and our relationship to it.  This DVD is an excellent follow on to the movie to continue to get them to think about the things we do and the consequences they have for the planet and the creatures we share it with.,1355702400,2,324,4.0625
