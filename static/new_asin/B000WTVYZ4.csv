8225670,5,B000WTVYZ4,"This is a great video, very well done in HD, and offers a lot of insight to insomnia and gives some valuable advice. Just what you would expect from the Mayo Clinic",1435104000,2,164,4.15625
8225671,5,B000WTVYZ4,"GAIAM and the Mayo Clinic teamed up to make this healing and comforting DVD. It explains what integrative medicine is and addresses lifestyle issues that may be causing the viewer to experience insomnia. Really I'd get this just for the ten minutes of relaxing meditation practice led in a non religious way by Rodney Yee. Then there is an excellent 27 plus minutes of yoga practice that is appropriate for most body types. To do the yoga you do however need some props. I used a folded blanket, chair, strap, yoga mat and towel. I wished I still had my yoga blocks. They would have been very useful for one pose in particular.

There is much to view on this DVD including a fun shopping trip to a grocery store you will wish was close to you. All that organic food! Also a nutritionist teaches you what types of foods not to eat that will cause acid reflux which may cause you to not get to sleep properly as you'll be uncomfortable. I also find that not eating any sugary foods near bedtime is key.

What I was shocked by was that the doctor doing the shopping trip advised the viewer to drink diet sodas. I thought that was a no no in the world of health. You may prefer ZEVIA which I adore. It tastes just like pop but is made with stevia. I even take it with me when I go out to eat now.

This video is a good introduction to solutions for insomnia. I just wish they'd had more practical solutions besides many obvious things like not staying online until you go to sleep. Some breathing exercises would have been helpful. Although Rodney Yee does cover some of that territory in his yoga section. I felt very sleepy after doing the yoga and meditation. I think it was also because of the music playing in the background. It was very relaxing.

What this DVD will introduce you to is a book written by one of the Mayo Clinic doctors called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NO-MORE-SLEEPLESS-NIGHTS/dp/B0042EP9CY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NO MORE SLEEPLESS NIGHTS.</a>

So I felt this DVD talked about mental, physical and emotional well being and had many tips that would help you sleep better. There are also lots of extras. You can view additional sections about GAIAM and The Mayo Clinic. The Mayo Clinic sounds like a wonderful caring place. It is world famous for its care.

I do not however believe in mother earth although I respect the earth. If you go to the GAIAM website which is recommended please note that I do not believe everything they do. I do however think this is a great DVD. Please also consult with your doctor before you begin any program of fitness or meditation.

8225673,1,B000WTVYZ4,I bought it. I watched it. I found it useless because it is so vague. It's more an infomercial for Mr Lee and his yoga class than anything else. It only cost $5+ so it was easy to stick in the trash. Let me save you time and $...here is the substance of the video. Insomnia is a problem. Eat a healthy diet. Exercise. Explore yoga. Sleep.

8225674,2,B000WTVYZ4,"The video ""Insomnia"" from the Mayo Clinic wellness solutions series provides some practical advise for dealing with insomnia, but lacks specific detail.  A portion of the video gives general advise about eating healthy food that applies to all aspects of health and is not particular to insomnia. A portion of the video shows an extremely fit yoga master sitting in a cross legged position that would probably cripple me. While yoga seems like a good idea for physical and emotional health, the sitting position of this yoga master is simply unrealistic for most people. The discussion of conventional therapies is so vague as to be essentially useless.  This video doesn't provide as much education about the subject as I had hoped and left me disappointed with the lack of substance.",1208044800,31,785,5.030769230769231
