2837781,4,B000QFAFOK,"Tommy Tiernan is a great comic. His high energy delivery is something that will have you and everyone around rolling on the floor.
WARNING this is not for young viewers because Tommy likes to curse. To quote him ""The English language is like a brick wall between me and you and F**K is my chisel""

My only complaint is that this is really light on extras. You are basically paying for a bit more than an hour of comedy and Tommy describing his trip to America and the differences between American comedy and Irish comedy.",1229385600,,521,4.484210526315789
2837782,1,B000QFAFOK,"Saw a bit of his act on TV, thought he was funny...bought the DVD. NOT FUNNY......very low class humor, offensive, dumb, boring.",1227657600,2,128,4.863636363636363
2837783,5,B000QFAFOK,"This CD is GRAND ALTOGETHER! His timing is great, his accent charming and his sense of humor whimsical. I laughed out loud in my car while listening to it for the first time. If you're Irish it is even more enter-taining. I highly recommend this comedian",1225756800,,254,4.543478260869565
2837784,5,B000QFAFOK,"what a funny, funny guy! No-holds-barred humor. If you want to roar with a good, long belly-laugh, buy this DVD.",1216512000,2,112,4.65
2837785,5,B000QFAFOK,"So funny, definitly not for children or those who don't like raunchy humor, but as odd as it sounds his raunchiness was done with taste,(in otherwords not overdoneMy7 husband and I laughed and laughed so funny... love those Irish men!!!!",1211414400,,237,4.95
2837786,5,B000QFAFOK,"This is one of the funniest comedy stand-up DVDs.  We watch all the Comedy Central stand-up routines and this one is a little darker than most of those.  I have watched this edited and the unedited version is simply brilliant.  It might be considered a little raunchy for some, but that doesn't offend me in the least so I found it extremely funny and enjoyable.  This one is worth the purchase for your collection and you won't feel this is just like all the other ones in your collection.",1210291200,2,490,4.47191011235955
2837787,5,B000QFAFOK,"I hope to see more of him! I usually do not laugh at comedians, so when I find one that really cracks me up I want to share with everyone. Tommy is the guy to share with everyone; I laughed until I hurt. I don't know what he's on, but he is really on top of his game!!!",1208563200,2,269,3.6551724137931036
2837788,5,B000QFAFOK,"This was one of the funniest stand up routines I have seen in awhile. I  saw the edited version on Comedy Central and had to buy it. There was a lot of bleeped out language in the version on tv and they skipped the raunchiest parts, but the best parts were the same. I have watched it more than once. Friends I made watch it, said I should not have built it up because then it would be disappointing, but within five minutes they were laughing out loud. Now, it helps that my husband is from Dublin so I know the sense of humor, but Tiernan's timing is great! He is dead on in his description of some of the differences between Americans and our friends across the pond. If you like stand up that does not play to the lowest element in this country, check it out! It's not Jon Stewart but then again, he is not Irish.",1208217600,3,817,4.138364779874214
2837789,5,B000QFAFOK,"Few stand-up comedy DVDs really capture the energy of the comic. This was especially a challenge with Irish comedian Tommy Tiernan. This DVD has to be one of the best filming jobs ever.

Tiernan is in fine shape with only one lull near the end of the show. In many ways, this show is a celebration of the twisted and sometimes dark human experience, especially the Irish version of it. This stand-up comic has the ability to never really be negative while still pointing out flaws and imperfections

If you like Tiernan and have seen him live, you will certainly not be disappointed. If you are unfamiliar with this comic, it really is worth your dollars.",1206230400,7,655,4.637931034482759

2837791,2,B000QFAFOK,It was the worst comedy show I have seen in a long time.  Omg.  They guy is not a funny stand up comic in my opinion.  Maybe that's why I never heard of him.  The product came quickly and undamaged.,1358208000,,198,3.875
2837792,5,B000QFAFOK,This Comedian is my husband and my very favorite in the world. We own every DVD we can get a hold of it and just keeps getting funnier,1356912000,,134,3.8214285714285716
2837793,5,B000QFAFOK,I laughed so hard that I was finding it difficult to breath.  Fantastic!  If you haven't seen Tommy Tiernan's material before or even if you're an old fan -- buy this DVD! You won't regret it.,1343174400,,192,4.305555555555555
2837794,5,B000QFAFOK,"I absolutely love this!! it's just how i remembered it when i first saw it on tv, except none of the words are bleeped out. so it's actually kind of better.",1338163200,,156,4.064516129032258
2837795,5,B000QFAFOK,I watch this a lot more than i should probably. Just something mental to help me through my mental life. I actually just bought this as a Christmas present for my dad. My boyfriend and I quote stuff from this show all the time. GREAT BUY!!,1325462400,,239,4.217391304347826
2837796,5,B000QFAFOK,This DVD is so funny. I laughed the entire time. Everyone needs to see Tommy Tiernan in action. I Loved It!!!!,1299888000,,110,4.285714285714286
2837797,5,B000QFAFOK,"This was an excellent stand up routine.  It not only cracked me up, it also cracked up family members in their 60's and 80's as well.",1277942400,,133,4.115384615384615
2837798,5,B000QFAFOK,"Everyone I've shown this DVD has wanted their own.  Pure energy.  If you like George Carlin, Bill Hicks, Eddie Izzard, or Doug Stanhope, then you have seriously critical taste in comedy.  If you like the energy (not material) of Dane Cook then you will be in awe of this guy; his energy is genuine and he is the real deal.  He is way beyond the edge and a must for the edgy comedy connoisseur.
I can't quite make the comparison of Tiernan to any these guys, because he's in his own category.  This can be checked out on youtube, there are plenty of clips of him.  He IS pure energy, filtered into delicious raw comedy.  A friend in Ireland first told me about him, and this DVD does not disappoint.",1245888000,,698,4.323076923076923
2837799,5,B000QFAFOK,"Recieved this recent DVD as a Christmas gift and immediately popped into the big screen. AMAZING!! I had already seen much of his work on youtube but the live performance on a regular stage makes a huge difference.

To start, Tiernan is best known for his signature manic movements and soaring rhetoric. A small club, or worse, a grainy, tiny youtube cut cannot do justice to this crazy Irish comedian. The camera work here zooms this guy right into your eyeballs but never gets in the way. No artsy digi-tricks here, just a hugely intense Tommy Tiernan getting right up in your face with a one-two punch line. This guy must collapse at the end of this show after ninety solid minutes of swooping, hollering, stalking, and laughing without a moment's rest.

He's an Irish comic in the way a Pit Bull is a dog. You don't dare take your eyes off this guy especially as his ears go back and a growl rolls in. Americans like to say, ""nice doggie"" to hostile looking animals and a fairly spectacular example of this occurs when he begins the wind up for the next hairy drop into the hyperkinetic abyss of helpless hilarity.

He starts on the many incidences of demographic class oppression, for example, the Jews during the Holocaust. The audience realizes that this will be a darker bit and laughs easily waiting for the next level of windup. Then he brings up the black slaves. Again, an easy laugh. We're so used to acknowledging that others are going to brain us forever for having anything to do with this horrendous worldwide practice that we simply don't make the emotional connection anymore.

It is a stunning moment just after this laugh when Tiernan simply stops and stares. Is this a pause for dramatic emphasis? Okay. Another laugh rises through the audience, the kind I call a ready laugh. Not a deep rolling laugh, just a gentle encouragement for the comedian. Go ahead make my day. The audience settles down and waits...

Tiernan must break the silence with something. He's obviously not going to stand there until the audience leaves. But he offers nothing that can be construed as another element of windup. The camera closes in on his face several times during this spotty bit and each time the comic's face stares blankly back at a still tittering audience.

Finally he explodes, ""F@*&K you, Chicago!!!"" The reaction is robust laughter. But surprisingly, Tiernan takes no victory lap across the stage and back while waiting for the audience to settle down again. He actually looks down at the floor of the stage as though an answer to why-are-they-laughing is going spring up into his head. He is so obviously flummoxed that he starts the next line by turning his head to speak it to the backdrop. It was an excellent exposition on the hazards of foreign comedy tours.

He is a master comedic story teller as are many Irish funny men. But their souls are forever set to burned toast with jelly on top. Every line speaks to the painful reality of common humanity that we must deal with each minute we breath. The Irish, however, excel at keeping despair at bay by laughing at it. He is not of the same mold as modern American comics who deliver a rat-a-tat, guns blazing, series of one liners. It takes a while to prepare the listener for more complex commentary. One settles in to hear an orator of the first order with patient expectation. The reward is like a sledge hammer waiting to sneak up and smack you in your funny bone.

Americans have lost their cultural memory of such style. Tiernan mentions his admiration for such iconic comedians as Bill Cosby and Lenny Bruce who mastered this form so many years ago. Some times it has unfortunate consequences.

He wanted to speak of oppression as a set up for a bit about how America deals with it. Clearly he did not expect as strong a laugh as he got when he was enumerating who did what to whom in history. It was the nervous twitter he expected indicating a penitent attitude to our sins. Instead he got a ""so... go on..."" kind of easy laugh.

And so the difference of an American audience from an Irish one slams into his conscious reality and fairly knocks his timing for a sliver of a bit. It was fascinating. The Irish have fought for their whole existence on this planet. The rampant hostility gathered from war, pestilence, and disease has trammeled the Gaelic soul, toughening the exterior while tenderizing the inner spirit.

As a third generation Irish gal my memory is chock full of emotional scenery. Going to pubs with my father as a little girl where I would be hoisted up to sit on the bar while his drunken friends made teary acknowledgements of what a sweet little thing I was will forever be one of my fonder recollections. Pressing coins into my hand, they all urged me to be so sweet forever more as they smiled and cried at the same time. My father referred to me his whole life as, ""the doll"".

Spoiled I would have been had not my parents given me eight male siblings. They fought with each other and me in eternal family warfare until each left home. Never in all their fighting days, though, did anyone take it seriously. Puppy play. Violent only in appearance. Furniture overturned, lamps broke, shirts ripped. My father would wade into the fray with his belt swinging to tame their wild child natures.

Can an American mindset ever understand or accommodate this kind of parenting? Today, my dad would be called before state authorities for his obvious barbarities. Tommy Tiernan strays often into such socially embarrassing territory with gusto. Take what you will from it.

All of my brothers matured into wonderful men. They aspire to rule their families with great kindness and concern. They are the paradigm of the model male American. But so few recognize that it is a luxury gifted to us by men who didn't have a lot of resources in their quest to save their sometimes wretchedly poor family from the social annhilation so common to that period.

And Tiernan has traveled that well worn road. His upbringing sounds Dickensian to our neatly manicured minds. Mother sounds insane, father sounds uncertain, two animals fated to wed and war for evermore. He is packed up and shipped here, there, and everywhere; always the new guy. His religious background is a soul that's there and not there; the Zen of spiritual experience. And from all this we learn who he is, right here, right now.

In a compelling interview included in the bonus material he is the very opposite of his stage presence, speaking of himself with halting uncertainty. We Americans are a certain bunch. We are not at all surprised when someone stops us on the street for a camera/mike interview on all subjects great and small. Rarely do we react with such humility and pause as Tiernan does on nearly every question. I came to conclude that he really doesn't know who he is and never will. He is a man of public exposure, defining himself by audience reaction every day. A work in progress. A funny, funny man.",1230249600,3,6982,4.659626320064988
