4486493,4,B004WD1IQQ,"Great entertainment, it was great to see this show again. I was also amazed by the guest stars being recycled episode to episode, playing the bad guy or gal in one episode to playing the good guy/ gal or side kick in another. When you're a kid you don't those things. A must have to a western collection.",1316995200,,304,4.258620689655173
4486494,5,B004WD1IQQ,Being a fan of Gene Autry since I was young. I must admit  that I really enjoyed watching these shows.  The humor though at times a bit corny never the less was funny. His shows had a moral to them that even now  could teach some of us a valuable lesson. Pat Buttrum played his supporting role very well too .,1310428800,8,309,4.032786885245901

4486496,4,B004WD1IQQ,"Don't know about Gene Autry TV shows running 30 minutes but the industry standard length in the fifties was 25 minutes which allowed five minutes for commercials/station breaks.  Have Gun:  Will Travel, Rifleman, Cisco Kid, Roy Rogers, Tales of Wells Fargo and other fifties westerns ran 25 minutes each.
  Frankly, Gene Autry was my favorite western when I was a kid.  Looking forward to having the set.",1304812800,3,404,4.970149253731344
4486497,3,B004WD1IQQ,"Although I have Pre-Ordered this Gene Autry Box-Set I have to say I am very skeptical about the Runtimes of the show.

According to Timeless Media's description of this set there are 26 episodes and some extras with a Total Runtime of 650 minutes, this makes each episode a maximum of 25 mintues.

Yet I have the two DVD issues of the Gene Autry Show issued by IMAGE Entertainment(available and bought from Amazon) and each show runs for 30 minutes.  So how can this new set be UNCUT ?  Although I would like to give this set 5 stars, for now I would rate it at 3 stars because of the seemingly apparent cuts.",1303344000,4,609,4.315789473684211
8445032,5,B004WD1IQQ,"Though I love westerns, I didn't get to see much of Gene Autry when I was a Kid.  That was when we only had two channels to watch on TV.  So now I am making up for all the episodes I missed 60 years ago, and loving each one of them.  These videos are great to watch with the grandkids - something found very rarely with today's media.",1471478400,,334,3.8823529411764706

8445037,5,B004WD1IQQ,In 1950 Gene Autry with his own production company decided to take a crack at TV.  This show ran from 1950 to 1955.  The TV shows were filmed between movies Gene was making for Columbia Pictures.  In this season he produced two color episodes.  Gene made sure these shows were of a educational nature as to morals and right from wrong.  For Gene Autry fans this is a good one to own.,1383868800,3,383,4.263888888888889
8445038,5,B004WD1IQQ,"For a disk manufacturer to give us an offering requires quite an expenditure!  First the original must be located, and it is generally not in very good shape. Then an economic decision must be made- Is it worth the tremendous cost tor the restoration and will we be able to recoup our cost and make a small profit? Thankfully a decision was made and a small production run commenced. Thankfully Amazon mad a decision to market The Gene Autry show at a reasonable price. Get it to enjoy while you can.",1376006400,2,500,4.4945054945054945
8445039,5,B004WD1IQQ,I was a youngster when this was on TV. I bought it to remember way back then. It is nice and clear and was a good look at the old days.,1363132800,,135,3.3870967741935485
8445040,5,B004WD1IQQ,"I am 55 years old and live in Australia, so I am fortunate enough that as a child I was able to catch the tail end of the Golden Years of American television. Being a boy my favorite tv shows were naturally enough - Westerns, and I watched them all, or at least tried to. Hopalong Cassidy, The Rifleman, Wagon Train, Have Gun Will Travel, Bat Masterson, etc, etc.
One show I don't remember seeing as a child for some reason was The Gene Autry Show. Having become a big Gene Autry fan over the last 10-15 years or so through his music, The Gene Autry Show was the first thing I purchased from Amazon, and not only was I not disappointed I was absolutely delighted. I think the G. A. Show was perhaps the best Western tv show ever made, especially so considering when it was made. The photography and the on location scenery it catches is simply stunning and the prints on these dvd sets are crystal clear, they look as if they were only filmed last week.
The Gene Autry Show set a very high standard for other Western tv shows to attempt to match, and very few did. Likewise, the dvd sets of the Autry Show have set a very high standard of quality for any other dvd releases to match, for new or old tv shows alike.
What can one say about Gene Autry that has nor already been said by the volume? Having caught up with his tv show as well as more and more of his movies, my admiration for him has only grown.
I think Autry is largely under rated as an actor, I don't think enough people appreciate how hard is to come across as natural as Autry does. And what a role model, something the world is lacking in these days!
In watching the Gene Autry Show, as well as a number of his later movies, I have been bowled over in discovering Pat Butram, whom I had only ever known of from that great comedy classic from the 1960s, ""Green Acres"".
Pat Butram has become one of my favorite cowboy sidekicks, he is an absolute delight to watch. Watching these Gene Auty shows it is quite obvious that Autry and Butram had a natural affinity and the warmth between the two is great to watch. Autry always looks genuinely amused by Butram's antics.
If you are a Gene Autry fan you no doubt have these dvd sets already. Everyone else, what are you waiting for ?",1363132800,4,2243,4.255269320843091
8445041,5,B004WD1IQQ,"Great collection, and I hope tp be buying the remaining seasons soon; any chances of any of the other Flying A shows being released to DVD? Show such as The Range Rider, Buffalo Bill, Jr. and Annie Oakley?",1329868800,,205,4.421052631578948
