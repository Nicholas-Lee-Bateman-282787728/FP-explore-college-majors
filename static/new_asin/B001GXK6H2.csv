8307326,3,B001GXK6H2,"This DVD did have a few funny moments but I can't say that I'd feel very comfortable showing this to the whole church body. Simply omitting curse words from an act doesn't make the material ""gospel"". I'm not saying that the material wasn't funny. 'just saying that it's not church setting appropriate. I felt a little misled by the title. A more accurate title might be ""Prime Time TV Ready Comedy"" and not ""Gospel Comedy Allstars 2"".",1292803200,3,434,4.64935064935065
