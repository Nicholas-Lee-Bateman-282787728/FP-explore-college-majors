8480867,5,B005O0RKOK,"While many like Hector Babenco's brilliant, raw 'Pixote' better, I find his deeply emotional portrait of two lost souls surviving together in a South American prison cell even more riveting.

The two towering performances - William Hurt's feminine gay storyteller, and Raul Julia's angry but frail (emotionally and physically) leftist are by far the best work either has done on film.

The intricacies of their slowly evolving relationship are complex, powerfully moving, and sometimes disturbing,

And while probably 60% of the film takes place in one room, the film never feels like a play. It's always cinematic.

A special film that holds up to repeated viewings.

The blu-ray is definitely a step up from the DVD, but if you only have access to a PAL DVD player, this is certainly better than nothing.",1445385600,,806,5.030075187969925
