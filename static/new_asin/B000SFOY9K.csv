8205241,2,B000SFOY9K,"The Wiggles get crazy on the lyrics here.  Murray goes crazy on the mic and lays down some of their best lyrics to date:

""How do you want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a Wiggle in the cash game livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a Wiggle in the cash game livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
Love the way you activate your hips and push your a** out
Got a Wiggle wantin' it so bad I'm bout to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club,
oh sh you got me fiendin' body talkin' sh to me but I can't comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance...""",1449532800,,725,3.7012987012987013

8205244,3,B000SFOY9K,"I bought this Wiggles video for my granddaughter, however, I was not happy with the quality of this video. Content was good, however, I was disappointed that the picture was not entirely clear.",1318550400,,193,4.878787878787879
8205245,5,B000SFOY9K,This is a very nice video for a concert. Video and sound quality are excellent. I think the Wiggles are more interactive with audience in this video than the non-concert one. My kids love to see Jeff doing the hand stand and start practicing it after watching the video. They watch this more often than the other Wiggles DVD we have.,1288656000,,333,4.475409836065574
8205246,3,B000SFOY9K,"LOVE the Wiggles, wanted all DVD's Wiggles but this one left us disappointed.  Daughter didn't have the patience to stay a captive audience and dance with the group as she does on their other videos (not live tapings).  Sometimes the camera was panned so far back from the stage (audience shots) a tiny tot could lose interest.  Great classic Wiggles songs and dancing just not the favorite format.  We've seen them LIVE in person and it's just not quite the same nostagia :)",1258156800,,475,4.686746987951807
8205247,5,B000SFOY9K,I bought this video for my 4 month old grandchildren thinking they would enjoy listening to the music.  They love watching it too!  Who would have thought that we would have to limit the TV time for 4 month olds?  They love the bright colors & laugh out loud as they watch.  Highly recommend for all ages.,1251244800,,305,4.298245614035087
8205248,5,B000SFOY9K,I bought it for my 1 & 1/2 year old daughter and she loves it.  She dances and sings to all the songs.  She loves waking up Jeff.,1242691200,,129,3.5714285714285716
