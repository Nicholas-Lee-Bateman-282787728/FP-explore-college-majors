8375265,3,B002NPCJU4,"Monsters in sword-and-sandal films tend to veer between the passable and the laughable.  But here, thanks to the great Carlo Rambaldi, are two of the best.  Although the dragon moves stiffly, it looks real.  I especially liked how it moved in and out of the swamp.  The medusa is up for debate... some viewers have likened it to a one-eyed Cousin It or have laughed at how it lurches back and forth like a chicken.  But I thought it looked dark and creepy, like an evil squid.  Either way, the medusa is helped greatly by the gorgeous matte paintings of the bleak valley and the eerie statues of the past victims.  Say what you will about the medusa itself, you must admit that the valley has an incredible atmosphere, like a Dali or de Chirico landscape.

In between the monster scenes, you'll get a standard and unimaginative peplum, with a dull hero played by Richard Harrison (Giants of Rome) in a brown tunic.  The story has nothing to do with the original myths, though the characters were partially inspired by the myths.  The dragon and the medusa seem related like Scylla and Charybdis.  The heroine has more personality than usual; note how she seems naive and yet skillful at once.  The hero is weaker than the usual fusto type; he often seems more lucky than strong.  Brian Bankston, whose Cool Ass Cinema blog grew to fame in 2009 from peplum posts, calls the movie ""dumb but hugely enjoyable.""  I concur.  Many other myth-oriented pepla are superior (Goliath Against the Giants being one of the best), but Medusa is still worth a fan's time.  Time-lapse effects are used for the petrifications.  The American print features the great ""Mighty Sons of Hercules"" TV theme song.
