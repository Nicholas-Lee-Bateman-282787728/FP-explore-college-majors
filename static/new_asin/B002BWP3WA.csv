3896211,5,B002BWP3WA,There's nothing that I can say that the previous 2 reviews didn't cover.  I have been waiting for this movie since it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year.

3896223,5,B002BWP3WA,"Im not old enough to really have watched blackxploitation movies in their prime but the internet is a wonderful thing and black dynamite is a great parody and tribute to the genre. Questionable acting, weird camera shots, Jive Turkey's, Ridiculous villain plots, Soul, Funk, Style, and Kung-Fu all done on purpose mind you. My favorite part of this Blu-ray is actually the extras that have the cast and crew talk about what inspired the film and how blackxploitation films had an effect on their lives when they were younger.",1518048000,2,525,4.910112359550562

3896248,4,B002BWP3WA,"Michael Jai White (Jerry Springer movie) stars and co-wrote this sometimes hilarious, raucous, and outrageous homage spoof of the blaxploitation genre.  Everything that was good and bad about Shaft and Superfly; or The Mack and Black Belt Jones (checkout the commentary) is here for your enjoyment. It will help alot though, I'm sure, if you enjoy some of the blaxploitation movies. Otherwise, you may wish to go nowhere near BLACK DYNAMITE.
But, this is good the second time around too, because you might have missed a movie reference the first time; and the commentary will spell out a joke or two that I have to admit I did not see the first time (there is a visual 'joke' ''Where did the shot come from?'' that is actually a reference to the MLK assassination! THAT takes balls...!  And, yes, I laughed when I realized I MISSED the obvious 'posings' by the actors...).
Michael Jai White admits he is, basically, imitating Jim Brown's acting and is flat-out hilarious when portraying the ""thoughtful Jim''. There is a lil' bit of Fred Williamson in there too.
Sally Richardson-Whitfield is perfect in 'fro' and hotness playing the Pam Grier 'look' named ""Gloria"" (for Gloria Hendry who was in Black Belt Jones; and Black Caesar...).
Bryon Minns who plays ''Bullhorn'' also co-wrote with Jai White and Director Scott Sanders who, together do the (good) commentary.  It's easy to look passed the one or two times in commentary when what they are saying and 'trying' to be funny about is just not funny.
4 1/2 stars for plenty of laughs and great stock footage used to represent 70's because it didn't matter if it might have been a car chase clip from tv's Police Story! All part of the fun!
Same car is used for different car crash explosion too!
Checkout ''B.D'' (as he is sometimes affectionately called) tell the little sisters he does not know who their daddy is.  ""MY mama said my daddy is ""BLACK DYNAMITE!""
""UH, lotta' people with that name.""
BLACK DYNAMITE is sometimes offensive and appropriately inappropriate in its affection for the genre.

The 'investigation' of Code Kansas and the ridiculous, roundabout way the players end up singing 'little richard' should be much more well known.  The 'Kansas' sequence is a classic, comic moment as good as Mel Brooks or Richard Pryor -- rolled into one.

3896280,5,B002BWP3WA,"There is a true difference between parody and satire. This is pure satire compared to 1988's I'm Gonna Get You Sucka which was straight parody. This was made with a love of the films that were watched by a good many of us underground and grindhouse film junkies known as blaxploitation. Certain films saved studios (Shaft, anyone?) while others brought us empowerment. However, later on in the genre and decade, the films started to become cheaply made and more to exploit pockets than make empowering messages.
This satirical piece gives a beautiful homage to greats such as Jim Kelly and Jim Brown and such films as The Mack, Black Belt Jones and Willie Dynamite. The jokes are are made with as much love and respect to the genre. This piece had side-splitting pieces and parts just too hilarious to point out.

Black Dynamite is a great homage to the 'blacksplotation' films of the 70s and capture the vibe of those films.

Actor/martial artist Michael Jai White plays the lead of Black Dynamite. He does a great job as a self-serious, jive talking, hard as nails brotha who cleans the streets of drugs. He eventually discovers a plot that takes him to the highest levels of government.

Great martial arts, a great cast and an obvious love for the source material make this a hidden gem

This is definitely a must see for anyone who enjoys fairly raunchy comedies (or even if you don't, because this movie is great).

3896595,5,B002BWP3WA,"I was fortunate to first watch this on Netflix on its limited run, what I saw I couldn't believe. Most comedies I watch may produce a smile or even a giggle. Black Dynamite produces outright laughter. Mind you, it's made for a particular audience (as is any comedy). It spoofs and satires all the famous Blaxploitation movies of the past, from cheap budgets to terrible acting, to reused footage from other movies, and plots so outrageous it just has to make sense.

I bought it on Blu-ray the next day, and the quotes haven't died since. If you find this listed for under $15, it's a steal. It's not one of those ""It's so bad it's good,"" it's a great movie because it makes fun of all the bad ones so perfectly. Hope you check it out.",1423785600,2,735,4.364963503649635
3896621,5,B002BWP3WA,"Although not mandatory, I highly suggest viewing films such as ""The Mack"" or any of the films starring one of the most famous black exploitation actors, Rudy Ray Moore. In particular, ""The Human Tornado"", ""The Return of Dolemite"" or ""Petey Wheatstraw"" will suffice. Regardless, Black Dynamite will generate more laughs than you will anticipate (at least for me it did) . I feel these films will enable one to appreciate the writing and everything else in between because Black Dynamite truly captures the essence and feel of what these films were all about during the 1970's. In fact, Black Dynamite is better, a whole lot better.

Yes. He is here folks. Black Dynamite. (Michael Jai White) He is a lady killer, a smooth talker, a  former Vietnam veteran, a dominating kung fu master that has a way with words and very little time for shenanigans. When Black Dynamite's brother is killed by a shady organization, he vows to clean the streets for good because drugs, thuggery, and gang violence reign supreme in a world of filth. Black Dynamite has had it. When he finds out that drugs are being sold to children in a local orphanage, well look out, it ain't pretty, but it is extremely and highly entertaining nonetheless.

Besides Black Dynamite, there are a slew of other characters that are priceless and extremely memorable. Creamed Corn, Bullhorn, and Saheed will also push your lung capacity to its limits as your face will be stuck in a fit of laughter. Some of the most memorable scenes include the following:

 The infamous Creamed Corn Chase, Uncovering the Anaconda Malt Liquor Mystery, and the never ever forgotten Pimp Council scene.

The writers (Scott Sanders, Michael Jai White) the director (Scott Sanders) and the rest of the cast truly knew exactly what they were doing. I believe there were an array of talented individuals who specialized in just the right things to make this film what it is, a masterpiece. The representation is purely authentic. The way it is filmed transforms one back right into the heart of 1970's. (shot in reverse color) The film soundtrack was actually recorded in full analog using equipment from the late 1960's. It is not hard to tell how passionate the cast was into making this. In the bonus features, the writer and director believe that black exploitation films were boring and truly wanted to make this an entertaining film. The film is short, running at just 84 minutes, but what an 84 minutes it is.

If you have a sense of humor and even a slight appreciation for this genre of films, well then you have found your golden treasure.",1423440000,,2589,4.8044943820224715

I now get the nods to Dolemite, but it still was just as hilarious even before knowing all of them. It's a good movie for a spoof and has a pretty good plot, not to mention so quotable. It's the best kind of cheesiness and will bring a goofy grin on your face. It gets the shoestring budget 70's Blaxsploitation look and vibe down to a tee.

There are some really funny, unintentionally bad films; but I don't think I've ever seen a film that was deliberately, and successfully, comically ""bad."" Every shot was carefully choreographed, down to the boom mic visible in some shots, and the sometimes-flaky audio.

This film has everything you could ever want: kung fu; a badass mother with an afro, a sick mustache, and a revolver; a plot that has no sense of direction; characters who read out stage directions; and a film that just, overall, has a proud, unabashed ability to revel in its own plot holes.",1399334400,,591,4.784313725490196

African action legend Black Dynamite goes after 'The Man' for killing his brother Jimmy, for pumping heroin into local orphanages and for flooding the ghetto with hopped-up malt liquor.

It's just so cliched and dumb. So it's acceptable for a black person to use racial slurs against white people as long as its in a comedy huh? And to shoot honkeys in the [blank]? There was no moment in this movie where I completely lost my serious face.

3897244,5,B002BWP3WA,"If you're looking for the perfect black-sploitation parody movie, you've found it. It's faithful to the genre and doesn't break character with obvious self-awareness (unlike Austin Powers) but it's great with its over the top 70s costumes and production values complete with (probably intentional) editing mistakes. If you can *get* what the ""ooooo"" is in the malt liquor advertisement ""it gives you ooooo"", you'll love this movie.

the hero is a black ex-CIA agent who goes on a mission to clean up the streets and take down an evil organization targeting the African-American community. He convinces pimps to stop selling drugs in the neighborhood, teams up with revolutionaries reminiscent of the Black Panthers, and wins the adoration of his contemporaries (including a special lady). There's plenty of action including kung-fu and nun-chucks, car chases, and the best the 70s had to offer. The hero is tough and doesn't take any guff from anyone.

Some of my favorite scenes:
- after the evil organization sells heroin to orphans, Black dynamite hears a 10 year old orphan talking like a smack addict
- two girls playing jumprope are approached by black dynamite and a lady he's trying to impress. One says ""my mom says my daddy's name is Black Dynamite"", the other says ""me too"", BD replies with ""quiet girls, there're a lot of people with that name""
- Anytime BD beats up multiple people at once

I see this becoming a cult classic, but I don't think it has a lot of mainstream appeal (as you can see from its dismal box office numbers).

But here we have one - ""Black Dynamite,"" the comic tale of an ex-CIA agent/kung-fu master/Vietnam vet (amusingly played by the appropriately deadpan Michael Jai White) who vows to take down all the drug dealers in his gang-infested `hood.

""Black Dynamite"" captures the look and sound of the period perfectly - the polyester suits, the mile-wide lapels, the bell bottoms, the ceiling-scraping afros, the jive-talkin' dialogue and boom-box soundtrack, the shag carpets and paneled walls.  Even the film's muddy picture and faded colors - a result of its being filmed in Super 16 - approximates the movies of that era (at least as they look when viewed today).

But the script is considerably less successful, since it bases its humor more on mimicking mannerisms than on anything resembling original jokes.

It's ultimately a one-note comedy, that, almost by definition, hits a point of diminishing returns after a time. But there's no denying that the movie IS fun - and a little nostalgia-inducing - to look at.  It's also inoffensive and good-natured.

But by the time Dick and Pat Nixon, not to mention the karate-chopping ghost of Abraham Lincoln, arrive on the scene - along with the inevitable blooper-reel running alongside the closing credits - it's long past time to take a powder on ""Black Dynamite.""",1344643200,,1464,5.0

The love the writers and director have for the genre is definitely here. From the slightly grainy film transfer to the incredibly authentic score, this is the real deal folks!! Michael Jai White and company have made a masterpiece here and if you don't find this funny from start to finish, I can't imagine what WOULD make you laugh. It's as good as a comedy could get, simply because it takes some of the ingredients that were unintentionally funny in the old blaxploitation films of the 70s...and subtly amplifies them for comedic purposes. You REALLY have to pay close attention to get every laugh out it. Some of the jokes/laughs happen so suddenly and in an almost hidden fashion and, when you get the joke, it's infinitely funnier than you could have imagined. When a song plays with a vocal arrangement...listen to the song and the lyrical content. I have had to go back several times and play certain parts over because I was laughing over the song that was being played. Watch for what would be considered technical glitches...and you can see they're brilliantly orchestrated.

Michael Jai White's performance is played so over the top, but straight at the same time. Think Leslie Nielsen's brilliant performance in the original Airplane...it's THAT good.

It's become my favorite comedy of recent years. I would even go so far as to say it's become one of my favorite comedies of ALL TIME.

Most of the time the films people will list in their 'Best Comedy Movie' lists are WAY overrated(I am looking at YOU ""Animal House""!).

If the AFI declared Black Dynamite to be the best film of all time(they gave that honor to ""Anchorman"" IIRC), I would have no objection. The film is THAT GOOD.

Sure parodying 'Blacksploitation' films may seem like an easy thing to do for those of us who vividly remember how bad movies like ""Dolemite"" were, but the Wayans bros. tried and failed to do it successfully with ""I'm Gonna Get You Sucka"". Black Dynamite succeeds in spades(er...am I tempting Black Dynamite's wrath by uttering that phrase?)!

My only complaint about this DVD(well the non-blue ray version at least) is that a lot of the extras such as the PSAs starring Michael Jai White and Tommy Davidson and such, which are damned near impossible to find online since they took them down off the web site, are not included as extras here.",1331510400,,1288,4.640350877192983

3897445,5,B002BWP3WA,"Dear Reader,
  Black Dynamite is an amazing movie as it is a satire/spoof of blaxploitation films from the 70s. It was shot in about two weeks, which would make you think its not that great of a movie, but it only adds to the comedy and makes the movie that much more enjoyable. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great laugh. The blu-ray case is awesome because it does NOT contain for discs for watching the same movie. Alice in Wonderland contains the blu-ray, 3D blu-ray, dvd, and digital copy which marks up the price. This blu-ray does not. Its just the blu-ray so that is why it is so cheap. Other than that the movie came on time and in perfect condition.",1329091200,,673,4.333333333333333

The plot is resolved about 1/2 way through, then again at about 2/3 of the way through, then it picks up again and gets again resolved in the end.  They tried to pack too much plot into 1 film.  They would have been better off to have saved some of it for a sequel, which I would gladly watch or purchase.",1324425600,,550,4.25
3897470,5,B002BWP3WA,"For starters, I will go on record as saying I haven't seen SHAFT, SUPERFLY nor FOXY BROWN in their entirety. From what I have heard, they are three of the most well known of the Blaxploitation genre - a type of film especially popular in the 1970s, coming out of the Black Power Movement and also social consciousness. There were clear distinctions between good and evil, hero and villain, civil and unacceptable behavior. Of course, this behavior was punishable and taken head on by the likes of title characters like Shaft (Richard Roundtree), Superfly (Ron O'Neal) and Foxy Brown (Pam Grier). These were larger-than-life live action super heroes of immense stature, fearlessness, and sex appeal, with a firm foot on their own side of the law - boundless rules were broken and bent to uphold what they knew to be right. Especially, if the villains they were seeking to eradicate were drug dealing, pimping or openly discriminating against their brothers and sisters, in their local communities.

BLACK DYNAMITE (2009) examines themes of drug dealing, pimping and Vietnam flashbacks, told with a swaggering soundtrack, grainy 70s inspired photography, killer kung fu moves and a cast including the likes of Michael Jai White (Dynamite), Captain Kangaroo and Tommy Davidson. The self parodying jokes are fast and furious, the slapstick delivery of lines and plot developments are outrageous and unabashedly politically incorrect, and themes are strongly depicted. Black Dynamite is a Vietnam War Veteran and defender of truth, freedom and swagger. Dynamite is seeking to avenge the death of his relative, as well as put an end to drug peddling in local orphanages in town. Along the way, he makes time for romance, comes head-to-head with pimps, hustlers, and the like, and also gets a chance to demonstrate his kung fu moves, as well as his knowledge of Mandarin (Chinese).

My only complaint? This outrageous ride through Dynamite's world ends much too quickly.",1323475200,,1963,5.13125

3897473,4,B002BWP3WA,"It's true the character played wonderfully by Michael Jai white is named Black Dynamite. That there tells you where the makers of this film were headed. Basically a combination of loving tribute and satirical spoof to 1970's Blaxploitation and Kung Fu films that's what this film is. One can tell Jai White and his co-conspirators grew up watching films like Coffey,Shaft,Cotton Comes to Harlem and Hit man .They also saw their share of Shaw's Brothers Hong Kong imports and general Dragon Theater type films with action packed Kung Fu and Karate. What sets this apart from similar fare like Undercover Brother and I'm Gonna Get You Sucka is the grittiness and edginess that those two more sanitized films lacked. The makers were sure to include badly shot car chase scenes that look so fake,silly names like a guy named Cream Corn and another Chicago Wind,over the top almost Batman tv series level Kung Fu fights ,pointless stock footage and a kicking 70's soul soundtrack you dig. No cute nicknames here like White She Devil or lame mayonaise jokes. No point in going too deep into the story as it's very cut and dried. Black Dynamite's little brother Jimmy(Jimmy Dynamite?) gets whacked by ""The Man"" and BD swears his revenge. BD is a former CIA operative and ex Vietnam Vet who's righteous and a ladies man to boot. In an over the top flashback scene we see BD in nam( complete with stock army footage) where he's complaining about how the Chinese were treated(oblivious to the fact that Vietnamese people do not in fact speak Chinese  We also see how smooth our man is as he tries to sway Gina a hot little Black Power Sister to his side. The racial elements may make you cringe as they are purposely crude and over the top as sometimes the real Blaxploitation films were. Jokes about Malt Liquor,Black Men's um endowment,pimps and politicians all appear at one time or another. Basically if you can laugh at such things then you will enjoy Black Dynamite. Remember Black Dynamite is the only man who has a Momma and was an Orphan.",1318204800,,2037,4.72191011235955
3897474,5,B002BWP3WA,"I came at this film almost completey cold. I am a comedy fan, and have enjoyd such films as Pooty Tang and Underrcover Brother in the past, and someone suggested I see this. All I knew was that this was a blacksploitation parody, and that was about it.

When I started watching the film I was almost sure that the movie had been shot in the 70's. I knew it was a new film, but it wasn't until the appearance of Tommy Davidson that I realized, ""HOLY SNOT! This is all new!"" This just goes to show that the makers of this film did an outstanding job of recreating the whole 70's feel.

At first several of the scenes seemed off kilter or poorly planned. I quickly became aware that this is exactly what the film maker intended. From that point on, it gave me great enjoyment whenever I caught one of these 'planned mistakes'. Yet, this did not distract me from enjoying the movie or following the plot. It was just a topping on the sundae.

I have not seen any of the 70's Blacksploitation flicks that this movie is an homage to/parody of. THAT DOES NOT MATTER! If you are a fan of corny action films, comedy, or are a student of film, then you should find this movie to be fantastic!

I just found the whole movie as slow as Fred Sanford walking in his yard. Plus where are the laughs? I just found it fell incredibly flat.

The trailer is what sold me on renting the DVD. Don't be fooled. The trailer is all it has going for it. Stick with the original '70s movies of the genre.

I have an extensive Blaxploitation collection. I'm a huge fan of the genre and the history connected to it. Needless to say this movie has ALL of the elements that made these movies classic. It highlights the flaws and subject matter that made these movies awesome. Not to mention it also has some pretty unexpected cameos.

You HAVE to be a fan of the genre and you HAVE to have a certain type of humor to get the majority of the jokes in this movie as many are subtle. Its almost comes off as one big inside joke to anybody who is a fan of the Blaxploitation genre.

My suggestion to anybody watching this movie for the first time is to rent it because it isn't for everybody. However, if you have a good sense of humor and are familiar with the genre you'll most likely want to buy it and add it to your permanent collection.",1304553600,,1091,4.286407766990291

3897495,4,B002BWP3WA,"You're gonna have a tough time finding a bigger blaxploitation fan than me, so it was just inevitable that I'd watch this one.  I'll admit I was a bit leery because most of the films I've seen that are a spoof of a genre I love ended up being big disappointments(Isle Of The Damned-spoof of Italian cannibal films, Lost Skeleton of Cadavra-spoof of 50s sci-fi to name a few).  My fears were laid to rest, however, because I really enjoyed this movie.  Clearly all those involved are really into the genre and went to great lengths to make it as authentic as possible.  The music is fantastic, the fashions are right on, as are the vehicles and much of the filming style.  I initially thought the humor was going to be in the outrageous style of The Naked Gun/Scary Movie/Airplane, etc.  While it certainly has moments of that(especially in the second half), the humor comes from exaggerating the elements that made the original 70s films unintentionally funny at times.
And of course special mention must be made of Michael Jai White.  He does a very impressive job of channelling the spirits of Richard Roundtree, Fred Williamson, Jim Kelly and Jim Brown.  His performance is dead on.
That's about all there is to say really.  You don't need to be familiar with the source material to find it entertaining, but if you're like me and have a love for those old films, this movie is truly a treat.",1302480000,,1395,4.615384615384615

Shot on era-appropriate film with matching wardrobe, hairstyles (oh, the hair in this movie), transportation and window dressings, if I didn't know any better I'd have sworn it was an authentic gem from the heyday of Sweet Sweetback and Superfly TNT. Despite paying homage to an era that wasn't exactly known for its realistic portrayal of the world, Black Dynamite somehow manages to be even campier than its forefathers, to great effect. It's amazingly successful at taking every aspect of the genre to task, from acting to editing to photography to the trainwreck of cliches that defined the decade, yet the story still manages to effectively one-up itself dozens of times before it's fully played out.

3897531,5,B002BWP3WA,"Black Dynamite is one of the best films of 2009. A hilarious send up of the blaxploitation films' of the 1970's, it surpasses the quality of its 1980s contemporary I'm Gonna Git You Sucka and is on par with the Naked Gun and Airplane! parodies from that decade. You'll be talking about this movie for days and reciting the one-liners verbatim. This is one of the most fun movies I've had the pleasure to watch in a long time.
Michael Jai White is Black Dynamite, a former government agent now neighborhood enforcer out for revenge when finds out his brother has been killed by The Man. That's the premise of this movie and that's all you really need to know. On his quest for revenge as he cleans up the streets there are tons of jokes based on the gaffes you'll be talking about for weeks on end. It's a conspiracy that leads all the way up to the White House and the President in a Kung-Fu climax that has to be seen to believed.
Black Dynamite was one of the best movies of 2009. Forget that Avatar nonsense, THIS movie should have been nominated for some Oscars! Everything from the set design to the music is the highest quality. For a film costing about $3 million dollars the set design, costumes and cinematography and production values had the feel of a big-budget period film, and the quality was on the screen in every frame. My only complaint about this fantiastic film is there wasn't enough Salli Richardson in it!
In their portrayal of the bad acting of those 1970s flicks, the entire cast gives a great performance with several standouts. Michael Jai White is awesome as Black Dynamite. This is gonna be his signature role; he takes his craft to the next level in this one. Tommy Davidson is hilarious as Cream Corn. Byron Minns steals scenes as Bullhorn. Minns feels like he was channeling the spirit of the late Rudy Ray Moore, in some frames it was like Dolemite was speaking through him! His rhymes and his one-liners are unforgettable. Kym Whitley is hilarious as Honey Bee; she channels the late Lady Reed in her portrayal of the character. Nicole Ari Parker disappears into her character and Salli Richardson is a delight to watch as Gloria.
Director Scott Sanders crafts a beautiful film that looks like it could have come from the 1970's. Cinematically, there's no distinction between this 2009 film and the classic blaxploitation movies that came from the late Samuel Z Arkoff's American Interantional pictures in the 1970's. Everything here is so period accurate it's not funny! White, Sanders and Minns must have sat down and meticulously studied every blaxploitation film from the 1970's frame-by-frame. I've watched dozens of Blaxploitation films from Dolemite to Foxy Brown to Black Samurai, and all the gags the in-jokes made about the genre and this film are right on the money.

This movie is, in short, brilliant. I laughed until I cried, then I laughed until it hurt, then I laughed until I had to pause the movie because I was afraid I was going to pass out.

The plot? It's the same plot as almost any other blackspoitation movie, and the production is all the better for it. The corrupt Man is destroying black youth by pushing a powerful new drug. The only person who can help is a reluctant Black Dynamite, who only joins the fight when he suffers a personal loss. How does Black Dynamite help? By kicking one screen-full of ass at a time, repeatedly. Chow some popcorn, rinse it down with soda, repeat.

It's all here, and it feels incredibly authentic while at the same time being fully updated. The film is shot on grainy 16mm. There are frequent jump-cute to simulate shoddy editing. There's violence, sexuality, and ""bad"" acting aplenty. Newer film techniques are used to add extra flavor in very subtle ways- an elderly lady answers a door and pretends she doesn't have the information Black Dynamite is looking for, so he kicks down the door, and wire-work is used to make her fly across the room in incredibly over-the-top fashion. This is a perfect synthesis of new and old techniques, as pretty much the only thing that's not gratuitously overused is wondefully-absent CGI. The film does lose a bit of steam in the final act, including the use of some small CGI effects, but it's otherwise phenominal.

Michael Jai White is absolutely phenominal, in both look and ability, paying homage to classics like Shaft and Dolemite. His transformation to character is nearly perfect, so that at times I could swear I was actually watching an old Dolemite film. White clearly did a lot of physical training to make sure he was the complete package in this movie, and his physicality makes every fight scene an incredibly visceral experience. Everyone's acting is excellent(or terrible) as a scene requires, and the costumes are spot on.

If you love ""bad"" movies (kung fu, MST3K), then this is probably one of the very funniest movies you'll ever see in your life. If you've seen and enjoyed movies like the original Dolemites and Shafts, then this is a must-have for your collection. It's unfathomable how Michael Jai White can keep proving his incredible talent in movies like this, and not get bigger roles.

It is a laugh riot -- the room was hooting and hollering for the duration, cheering Black Dynamite and his cohorts on. First of all, the film LOOKS as though it was actually filmed/shot in the 1970s. The color stock itself, as well as the artificial ""wear lines"" making the print look vintage, add to the illusion. The story line both milks, mocks and celebrates the standard conventions and tropes of the Blaxploitation genre. So many hilarious and quotable lines! The bizarre and convoluted sinister plot that BD works to thwart is a scream, as is the unforgettable Nixon tie in. The transformation of the ghetto into a suburb overnight said more about America's failures to address real need in underprivileged urban areas than any government report ever could. I laughed harder at this movie than I have at any film in a few years.

I don't think this will be nearly as funny if you haven't seen a handful of the original blaxploitation films, like Shaft, The Mack, Black Caesar, Dolemite, Superfly, and so on. But if you have, this will crack you up at every turn. Michael Jai White is actually a better badass than most of those guys, and certainly funnier. His script and performance here show that he is truly a connoisseur of those old slices of cheese, as well as a pretty fine martial arts expert.

There are a couple of classic lines in BD, none of which will get past the sensors here, so you'll just have to hear them for yourselves. I particularly liked the ""You're a diabolical dick-shrinking maternalbreeder"" scene, which is as over-the-top as one expects this whole movie to be. Director Sanders gets all the details right, from the completely '70s colors and film stock to the argot and bad acting that filled the drive-in screens of the time (and if you weren't around then, you can't even imagine how much more relaxed and fun this country was. Who ever thought we'd be nostalgic for the Watergate era?).

Yet that's the interesting aspect of BD. It's clearly a satire of these films and mimics their tropes with many a twist. But it's also a rather loving homage to them, and there are moments when it seems to be playing it straight for the laugh rather than going straight for the laugh. Lines are blurred but all to good effect, and this flick has cult classic written all over it. It's also got a perfect score by Adrian Younge, so convincing that I thought much of it was old school funk trax from the 70s.

Some of the cameos are pretty funny, with Arsenio Hall among them. He's the Dick Clark of black actors; he never seems to get older. But in the end this film is all White's, and that's all right, because he's got the goods and is ready to show The Man that mighty ain't righty when it's always for whitey. Can you dig it?

All in all, a hysterical send-up if you know the originals, and pretty funny even if you don't.",1272931200,,2027,4.438172043010753
3897630,3,B002BWP3WA,"This spoof of the notorious ""Black exploitation"" films of the 70s is considerably amusing. Could have been funnier, but it has its moments. First of all, as is the case with any satire, it requires a deep familiarity with the original films and 1970s culture to really ""get"" much of the humor. For example, few born after the 70s would ""get"" scenes such as the animated Zodiac characters having sex (back then, there was a popular series of illustrations of zodiac characters in a Karma Sutra poses) as well as the Nixon spoof. The Rudy Ray Moore caricature ""Bullhorn"" is on the money with his outlandish rhymespeak (it is too bad the real Moore died shortly before this film was released). Other good scenes include the outrageous word-association game Black Dynamite plays with his comrades in order to unravel the main mystery in this film, the way the background voices shout ""BLACK DYNAMITE! DY-NA-MITE!"" whenever the title character does something, and the Black Panther movement caricatures who recite stage directions along with their lines in the film. While it effectively lampoons the period and genre, I think that non-fans of such films and those too young to remember the 70s would not find a true apprecitation for the film and it could have been better as a whole. But for what it is, it is good for fans of Blaxploitation to guffaw while having your buddies over for beer and pizza. I would put this at slightly below the original blaxploitation spoof HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE and on a par or slightly above I'M GONNA GET YOU SUCKA!",1272844800,5,1542,4.8007518796992485
3897631,5,B002BWP3WA,"Much like Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, Black Dynamite pokes jibes at blaxploitation not by being mere parody, but by simply BEING a blaxploitation film, warts and all. Rife with all the technical gaffs and oddities of a real shoestring-budget 70s flick, BD is completely faithful to the era it references. Although this flawless emulation kind of goes off the tracks in the last quarter, it's for the best as it allows the movie to have the kind of satisfying resolution a lot of ""real"" blaxploitation movies couldn't seem to manage. As someone who hasn't really kept up with Michael Jai White since Spawn I was thoroughly impressed by his chops, both comedic and karate. That he also co-wrote the film makes this kind of an unexpected tour-de-force and one well worth watching.

On the visual side: It's interesting that the older film stock this movie was shot on actually captures dark colors as darker than shadow, which often appears grayish. This subtlety, as well as the garish colors of the film's costumes and sets are flawlessly captured on this blu-ray, and the sharp detail makes it easy to pick up the little details (such as boom mikes poking the hero's 'fro or the camera focus being nervously played with) that are packed into every scene.

If they had such an award, it would, without a doubt, go to makers of this very amusing parody/satire of 1970's blaxploitation films.

But the best way to enjoy this would be to have a movie night with a group of friends, popcorn made to Creamed Corn's exacting specifications, and your cool beverage of choice.

I really wanted to get a sense of where soul cinema was coming from before I watched something that sent it up.  And I'm glad I did because understanding what inspired Michale Jai White as well as what he and director Scott Sanders were trying to achieve made ""Black Dynamite"" that much better.  There are a lot of very amusing scenes worthy of quoting, but the one that just burned itself into my memory was the scene in the restaurant where every character is able to follow some of the most convoluted logic that ultimately proved, without a single doubt, how ""White-y"" was out to get them.  And it wasn't just any honkey; it was the head honkey from the 1970's!

As much as this sends up the soul cinema/blaxploitation genre, it shows even less mercy to the kung fu movies of the era.  It is so hard for me not to quote the film to make my point, but I would rather not spoil it for anyone who has yet to see it.  Suffice it to say that I will never look at the Shaw Brothers films in quite the same way again.  Okay, I'll just say this and leave it alone: Kung Fu Treachery!

3897633,4,B002BWP3WA,"The 1970's saw a proliferation of movies popularly termed ""blaxploitation.""  These were action films, generally R-rated, featuring African-American actors in starring roles as either cops, bad guys turned good, martial arts experts, or other men of power waging war against street thugs, drug dealers, ghetto pimps, and especially the corrupt white establishment, referred to as The Man.  The best known are ""Shaft"" (1971) and ""Superfly"" (1972).

""Black Dynamite""  pays homage to such films by capturing their look, style, and over-the-top action.  The action-comedy-spoof follows the exploits of ex-CIA agent and full-time ladies' man Black Dynamite (Michael Jai White), out to avenge the death of his brother against kung-fu masters, drug-dealing pimps, and The Man.  Whether he's taking down drug dealers or sweet-talking curvaceous honeys, he's the man out to stop The Man.

Director Scott Sanders provides a letter-perfect parody on a par with ""Airplane!"" or ""The Naked Gun.""  He incorporates all the clich&eacute;s of the genre, from Afro hairdos and machine-gunned one-liners to continuity errors, non-sequiturs, excessive zooms, split screen, visible boom microphones, faded color, and close-ups to overemphasize ""dramatic"" dialogue.  White, however, manages to avoid totally burlesquing the lead character by portraying him as an earnest action hero.  The movie is great fun at first but wears out its welcome long before its ninety-minute running time.  The spoof might have been more effective as a short.

""Black Dynamite"" is available in both DVD and Blu-ray formats.  Both contain filmmaker and cast commentary, deleted and alternate scenes, and two featurettes.  The Blu-ray edition contains, ""The 70's: Back in Action"" featurette.",1271980800,,1746,5.665384615384616
3897634,5,B002BWP3WA,"Who the hell is interrupting my kung-fu?

How do you parody a genre that is already on the edge of self-parody?  Why, to play it deadpan ""straight"" - or rather, to play it just - so - slightly - bent that manages to come off as both a top-notch example (if there is such a thing) of the genre itself and a loving and affectionate spoof of it.  This is what Keenan Ivory Wayans' I'M GONNA GET YOU SUCKA attempted - and didn't quite succeed in doing - just a few years after the original craze had died down; this is what director Scott Sanders' BLACK DYNAMITE, co-written by Sanders and stars Michael Jai White (Black Dynamite) and Byron Minns (Bullhorn), succeeds in - well beyond my wildest expectations.

Just about everything in BLACK DYNAMITE is perfectly calibrated, starting with the plot, which starts out as a revenge story as our hero (always referred to as Black Dynamite, his real name never revealed) sets out to avenge the death of his younger brother but quickly gets involved in uncovering a drug conspiracy that proves to involved the new Anaconda Malt Liquor, which does just something I won't spoil for you that results in one of the best lines in the film (which I can't quote here unfortunately).  Along the way he terrorizes a gay-acting pimp who happens to own a beauty parlor (have we seen this before?), busts up a pool hall with some kung fu action, gets involved with a militant black power sista, and gets the license to kill he used to have as a member of the CIA in 'Nam back - though he loses it again well before he traces the conspiracy to a secret island laboratory (""Kung Fu Island"") off the coast of LA run Dr. Wu, and eventually all the way to the top - the very top.  Of course there's a car chase - actually a couple, with the footage very obviously reused - and a really excellent chase on foot that is one of the very few scenes you could lift out and put into a serious action film.

But it doesn't stop there.  The characters all play off old blaxploitation stereotypes, but the bigger roles go beyond mere mimicry.  White's super-buff Black Dynamite has the coolness and fashion sensibility of Richard Roundtree, the toughness of Fred Williamson, and the kung fu skills of Jim Kelly all rolled into one, but with just a little bit of sardonic sauciness that's all his own; Minns' Bullhorn is a rhyming Rudy Ray Moore replica - except he's also got something of a Mr. T vibe going and he's a little smoother with the ladies than he ought to be.  Most of the other characters are pretty broad stereotypes, and you can find echoes of blaxploitation stalwarts like Pam Grier or Bernie Casey without looking too hard.

The dialogue kicks it all up a notch, or a flying kung-fu kick.  Black Dynamite to Pat Nixon after smacking her down: ""First Lady, I'm sorry I pimp slapped you into that china cabinet.""  To fiendish Dr. Wu:  ""Your knowledge of scientific biological transmogrification is only outmatched by your zest for kung-fu treachery!""  There's hardly a line in the film that comes off entirely straight or normal - but also hardly any that wouldn't seem at home in some of the more outlandish original blaxploitationers of 1974-76 or so.  And then there's the pitch-perfect cheapness of the look; filmed in 16mm with a lot of grain and often significant changes in contrast and color balance from scene to scene, with a lot of deliberately poor editing or outright mistakes (actors reading stage directions at one point; a stunt double replacing an actor who doesn't look anything at all like him in the middle of a fight scene) which always seem to happen just when the action is flagging.  Again very few of these are really over-the-top and when they are they're brief; Sanders and company know not to overdue things, at least not until the utterly outlandish ending in the White House.  But that, too, seems to fit the whole context of the film, which all adds up to something like a summation of and pinnacle of the genre as much as an homage.

DVD note:  The commentary by Sanders, White and Minns is icing on the cake - they seem to have memorized every blaxplo flick and are totally aware of which moment of what film every moment of BLACK DYNAMITE hommages, and they've got some great making-of stories.  The making-of featurette is fun, and there's a huge treasure-trove of deleted scenes which, while generally pretty funny, make pretty clear that the filmmakers really knew how to put this film together and what the best stuff they had was.

It's probably too much to ask that we'll get a sequel to BLACK DYNAMITE, given that it got practically no theatrical release, and how much work went into it - but I'll sure be looking forward to future projects from these guys.  I hope they get to do something else soon; I don't laugh easily, but BLACK DYNAMITE just about killed me, and I could use more of it.  Can you dig it, mama?",1271980800,,4886,4.551369863013699

Everything in it... the music, the acting, the camerawork, the lighting, the look of the film stock, etc. transports you back to the 70s. And I can't believe that this film didn't get nominated for best costumes or set design! There are times when you can easily believe you're watching a film made 35-40  years ago.

The only drawback to this film is that it seems to lose its way about 2/3 of the way through, as the plot takes us out of the 'hood and to an uncharted island run by a sinister Chinese mad scientist.

On that, be warned that this is a Region A title, and even if your blu-ray player is dezoned for DVDs it might not play blu-rays from other regions.  I got around this by buying a cheap ($159) blu-ray player from Dick Smith that I knew could be switched between regions using codes I found on the internet.

It is all very much within the times, although I did notice one slip-up when Gloria said something about getting the kids off crack, when it should have been smack (to be consistent with the rest of the movie, and the fact that crack didn't appear until after microwave ovens became commonplace in the '80s), but it was perhaps left in on purpose, in the spirit of blaxploitation movies often retaining all kinds of bad takes just because the cash wasn't there to do it again.

In the trailers you really only get a good sense of the main character, but the supporting characters are awesome as well.

BLACK DYNAMITE is fun, plain and simple.  The true magic behind it is that it manages to look like the films it parodies, down to the visible film equipment, the shaky cameras, the confused looks of the actors, the color tints, the rhinestones... This film is a visual treat, creating an atmosphere that carries it past a few lame jokes and some poor comedic timing on the part of minor characters.

Overall, the film doesn't click quite as it should.  Hate to say it, but it just doesn't.  But it's far, far superior to the other spoofs getting made these days; BLACK DYNAMITE is an ode to the days when spoofs actually had a purpose, when comedy was treasured and not wasted on a bunch of fart jokes and untimely bodily secretions.  And the film is the perfect vehicle for lead actor and co-writer Michael Jai White, who owns every scene with near-perfect comedic timing and charisma.  White kicks butt, takes names, and is so damn funny you'll wonder why it's taken him so long to do a film like this.  While BLACK DYNAMITE may have its flaws--and there are, sadly enough, several--White makes it all worthwhile.  A fun and funny film, and a breath of fresh air in these days of stale spoofs.",1268265600,4,1456,4.604651162790698

(Like that enormous piece of celluloid toilet paper ""Kung Pow: Enter The Fist"". Remember that ""spoof"" of karate films? If you said yes, I do feel sorry for you.)

3897717,5,B002BWP3WA,"I reviewed this movie a month ago after buying it, I thought it was very overrated and corny at the time, so I  gave it 3 stars. Well, after watching it I became re-interested in blaxploitation movies again. So I decided to revisit these movies I grew up enjoying, since I hadn't watched any of these in a few years. While watching the old Blaxploitation movies again, my eyes were opened to the connection between them and Black Dynamite. This movie is spot on accurate of many of the blaxplotation movies from that genre (of course making fun of them the whole time (parody)). Every time I watch Black Dynamite, I'm in tears I laugh so hard.

So now every weekend I rent other Blaxploitation movies, then rewatch Black Dynamite again to see the similarities......I see something new every time, and it makes the movie funnier each time.

So if you didn't like it the first time(like me), maybe you've forgotten the poor acting, dialog, and directing from the old blaxploitation movies. Check out Dolemite, Black Belt Jones, The Mack, Shaft and Truck Turner(my personal favorite), just to name a few that will help you understand the parody that is Black Dynamite; A definite early classic.",1267488000,,1191,4.771844660194175
3897718,5,B002BWP3WA,"I was very skeptical going into this movie.  Was it just going to be obnoxious humor that would be targeting a specific demographic?  Was this just going to be a cheesy waste of money?  Was it going to be jam packed full of the same actors that you see over and over and over again?  I did not want to see Beyonce Knowles playing Foxy whatever with Ludacris playing someone else.  They are talented, but I am tired of feeling like every movie has to have a rapper just to make it hip.  I did not want to see a bunch of ""over exposed"" guest appearances that we see now a days.
To my surprise, the movie was not overdone with over commercialized pop stars and I could not get over how well it tapped into the classic 70's genre.  The humor was clever, intelligent and I was entertained all the way through!  I absolutely loved how they would solve the complex riddles to come up with a motive and the plot was too finny!  The explanation of the pimp slap had me rolling and the end was classic!  What was so brilliant was how Scott Sanders (Director) did not make this goofy and unwatchable like you see movies now  a days (Scary movies, Date Movie, Epic Movie etc.).  I feel like most directors would have ruined this thing, but the Director did a masterful job!  Someone else mentioned how quotable the lines are and I could not agree more!  Hilarious!  I cannot say enough about Michael Jai White either!  This guy was dead on with everything throughout the entire flick!  I could not get over it!  Please give us more, but please keep it true to the genre and avoid being ""goofy"" like the movies mentioned above.  I have been telling my friends to check this one out and they all love it!

  My only issue is that some scenes got cut down on the DVD release versus the in theater experience. An example of this is the diner scene (not enough to spoil, read it!): In the original viewing of mine, BD says, ""what company makes M8Ms?"", one of the militants exclaimed ""White man!"". That part got deleted! In the DVD is goes straight to the other militant saying ""Mars Candy Company!"" The yelling of white man made that part pretty damn funny. But it'll go unnoticed to future viewers.
  The part is still hilarious, but the exclamation of that line tops it. Other bits of the film were cut out as well but to new viewers that is not a concern, they (or you) will laugh your ass off.

All I have to say is I think they did themselves a favor by giving this a limited release because it'll definately be a cult classic, and IF there is a sequel it's going to be huge (reception wise).  The soundtrack was just like the old 70's music and wasn't over the top stupid, the camera work was good, the story was ridiculous (in a good way), and this cast was perfect.

I just did not find this funny at all. It seems people found the humor in the fact that it just mimmicked an old movie. However, the movie didn't have anything funny.

Let see: Wow, was it hilarious that a boom mike appears in while MJW was filming. No.

Was the whole Richard Nixon scene at the end funny because he knows kung fu. Not really. Nor
was it funny when a ghost of Lincoln appears.

The cut scene while driving on the highway. Nope no hilarious.

The pimp scene with Arsenio, Tommy Davidson, Brian McNight, no humor there either.

Did I watch a different movie? All the slight gags in this movie have been done before in more recent movies. If you never saw them then maybe I can see why you laughed.

In fact, the director seems to have watched all the classics of the era (especially the American International Films), and lifted a bit of this and that out of each one...

Also featuring some spectacular cameo roles from Arsenio Hall, Brian McKnight, Miguel Nunez, John Salley, Nicole Sullivan, Mykelti Williamson, and Bokeem Woodbine.",1266278400,,1102,5.134078212290503
3897885,5,B002BWP3WA,"Let me start off with a simple statement about this movie. I loved it! The thing is you can't just rely on three simple words to convey how much or explain why.

The brainchild of star/writer Michael Jai White, BLACK DYNAMITE is not only the title of the film but the name of its main character. Composed of nearly every hero found in the classic black exploitation (or blaxploitation) films of the seventies, Black Dynamite is a man who beds every woman he meets and beats down any man bold enough to get in his way. The film is a tribute to those films as well as a parody of them and ranks with the best Mel Brooks had to offer in his tributes to his favorite genres.

The story opens with a mysterious shadowed figure ordering the death of a traitor to his organization of dope dealing members of the black community. The bad news is that this man was also the brother of Black Dynamite.

When word reaches Black Dynamite...let's just call him BD...he rages. BD returns home for his brother's funeral only to be chastised by his aunt for letting his brother become involved in drug trafficking. After all, he had promised his mother that he would look out for his brother.

Before he can take to the streets to clean them up for good, BD's old GI buddy and former CIA member arrives at his house to let him in on what's going on. It is at this time that he asks BD to stand aside and not make the streets run red with blood in his attempt to get to who killed his brother. Like that's gonna happen.

With the help of club owner and best friend Bullhorn (Byron Minns in a perfect tribute to blaxploitation star Rudy Ray Moore) BD is led to another character from the neighborhood, Cream Corn (Tommy Davidson). Corn tells him he can get answers at the pool hall run by Chicago Wind. What BD finds is Corn sold him out and a group of thugs waiting to beat him down. Too bad they don't realize who their dealing with as BD uses his kung fu skills to take on the whole group.

Clue after clue leads BD to the main man responsible for the death of his brother. And by the end of the film he finds himself on Kung Fu Island facing off against that main man who is behind an evil conspiracy that will affect every black man on the planet.

But there's more. Not only does BD come across gangsters trying to ruin the world, he meets a young militant woman named Gloria (Salli Richardson-Whitfield) who is trying to get rid of corrupt politicians. Gloria also works at the local orphanage where children are being hooked on smack, something BD doesn't take kindly to. His feelings on the matter make for another hilarious scene.

The plot seems simple, right? Well in fact it is. But it's not the plot that makes this film as wonderful as it is. Many of those classic films also had simple plots and plenty of action sequences puffed up with filler to make the movie longer. In fact that is part of the humor found in this film. Ideas and portions of all of those old films are put to use in the plot here. Drugs, dead family, trying to save the neighborhood, girls both good and bad, conspiracies, all of these were used at one time or another and here all of them are tied together.

It's not the story that makes this movie so great. It's the loving care it takes to make it appear as if it was made during the heyday of the genre. The film stock used (watch the extras where this is even discussed), the sound equipment, the production design, the clothing, all make you think you're watching a film made in the seventies. And the job these film makers do is fantastic.

And then there are the mistakes. Not real ones but intentional ones. To tell you all would be to spoil the laughs you'd get while watching. So here is one, a blatant one. While a scene involving BD is going on, the boom mike dips down into the shot. Not only that but you can hear it as it bumps into his afro while he glances up to see it there, waiting for the director to yell cut and start the scene over. But when these films were originally made, budgets were so tight that many times directors just kept rolling and included the scenes, messed up or not.

There is so much to see here and enjoy that in describing each one it would take away what the viewer would get out of it. Most of the seriously funny portions are discussed in the extras where White and crew talk about their love for the originals as well as where they got their ideas for this film.

As with the films of Mel Brooks, there are so many things you want to talk about when describing it but at the same time want others to enjoy; proof of this lies when I recall seeing BLAZING SADDLES for the first time. Everyone had told me about Alex Karras punching out a horse and how funny it was. By the time I saw it, there was no humor to the scene. Just know that BLACK DYNAMITE is a film that requires you to pay attention to get all the jokes. It also helps to have an appreciation for the original films in the genre.

Michael Jai White does a tremendous job here. Having mostly played action roles that use more of his physical presence than acting abilities, he displays a great sense of humor here in his portrayal. This may sound strange but to act is one thing, but to try and act poorly is not an easy task. White does it to perfection here leaving the viewer to wonder how it was he was able to not fall apart laughing while making the film.

In watching this film I found myself laughing out loud at parts and chuckling at others. And while I watched, I knew that when I would watch it a second or third time I would find more to laugh at while enjoying the things I found funny the first time around to still be funny. This movie may not have opened wide or been given a fair shot at the theater but it is sure to find a following on DVD. And with any luck it may even give a boost in sales to the originals that inspired it. In any event, this one is a movie not only to be watched but to add to the collection of those who love comedy. And we can only hope for a sequel.",1266278400,,6026,4.215091066782307
3897886,5,B002BWP3WA,"Saw ""Black Dynamite"" in the theaters, and it was fantastically fun.  As I recall, there was a direct quote from Dolemite's ""Disco Godfather"" (""Where - is - he - and - what - has - he - had?"") within the first few minutes, and that clinched it for me - the filmmakers knew exactly what they were doing.  Although it gets a little silly (well, more sillier) towards the end, it's still the best homage to 70's action movies that I've ever seen.

I'm Gonna Get You Sucka relied on Blaxploitation All-Stars to give the audience a wink, and Grindhouse ironically spent tons of money trying to make the movie look cheap.  This movie actually feels like it could have come from the Seventies and it never seemed like the creators were trying too hard. Of course, it doesn't hurt that Michael Jai White can actually battle kung-fu treachery with the best of them and is built like Apollo Creed.  Somehow, the movie throws ""honky"" and ""cracker"" around all over the place without feeling racist or mean-spirited.  I can imagine myself getting along fine with the revolution.  Check out the sound bytes on the movie's home page.  Tight and outta sight!  Here's hoping that the team gets together to do another one very soon.

3897950,5,B002BWP3WA,"It all began when actor Michael Jai White (""Spawn"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""The Underground Bounty Hunter"") was listening to ""Superbad"" by James Brown on his iPod and suddenly he came up with an idea to have a film spoofing '70s blaxpoitation films (1970's exploitation films targeting urban Black audiences).  White got together with a few friends and began taking photos of himself in '70s outfits and hooked up with director Scott Sanders (""Thick as Thieves"") and their friend and fellow actor Byron Minns (""Undisputed"", ""South Central"") to help craft ""Black Dynamite"".

The low budget independent film was screened at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival and was picked up by Sony Worldwide Acquisitions for distribution and now is being released on Blu-ray and DVD.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Black Dynamite"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  What the film does well is capturing the look of a 70's film by shooting via 16mm color reversal which brought in more grain and contrast.  Blacks are deep and gave the film an older look.  Thus when combining 70's classic footage (such as scenes from ""Charlies Angels"", ""Swat"", etc.) from the Sony Library, it works with this film.  The grain is intentional and so the colors are definitely not natural but it works for this film as yellows and brown colors definitely stick out and blacks are much deeper.  Also, the Blu-ray manages to capture the detail of the clothing, the hair, the hardware, the walls and surfaces.  It's a very cool looking film on Blu-ray.

As for the lossless audio presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA, again...I was very surprised and impressed by the audio.  It helps when they brought in Adrian Younge, a musician who still plays 70's music and brought in that 70's style of feel for the film.  Dialogue is clear through the center channels, music and action come on strong as well.  There are many action scenes from fighting to car chases, car explosions, gun shots, especially near the end of the film that takes advantage of the surround channels.

I suppose for a low budget independent film, I was not expecting too much from the audio.  So, to hear the lossless audio being utilized with crystal clear dialogue, music and special effects, I was very pleased with the film's soundtrack!

Subtitles are in English, English SDH and French.

JUDGMENT CALL:

At first, I was a bit skeptical about ""Black Dynamite"" but after watching the film, I can tell you that I absolutely enjoyed this film.

The storyline spoofs '70s blaxpoitation and Kung-Fu films but where a lot of those films back then were cheesy and were being pumped out like crazy because they were what was making money for the film companies during that time, ""Black Dynamite"" manages to capture the good from those films and make it a hilarious, action/comedy film.  What makes this film work is the costume design, the afro's, the slang, the jive talk, utilizing '70s footage, along with finding homes that still have maintained the '70s look (yes, shag carpets and all) and of course, the use of '70s style funk and soul music. For characters, you got the jive-talking pimps, the militants, the crooked cops and politicians, the whores, the drug dealers...all integral to the film with dialogue filled with'70s expletives and ethnic slurs.  An obvious nod to ""Shaft"", ""Superfly"", ""The Mack"", ""Return of the Dragon"" and ""Foxy Brown"" and other films and the talents of that era.

Just a tremendous job by the filmmakers and performances that worked for this film.  The fact that it was done for under $3 million is quite impressive!

From the naked women, to the militant and his men armed with machine guns, the talent made this film quite believable as if it was a '70s film.  The choice by director Scott Sanders to use the Super 16 Color Reversal film stock was a perfect choice as the film literally looks and feels like like a '70s film.  For a low budget independent film, the Blu-ray manages to enhance the look and feel of this film as you can see a good amount of grain and the colors are just vibrant.  Audio quality from the dialogue, music and the special effects are well-done and also a good amount of special features are included as well.

If there was one thing that I felt wasn't impressive was the studio's handling of the distribution for the film for its theatrical release.  There have been a lot of small, absolutely dumb comedy films that have received decent screenings across America and for once, we have a creative and enjoyable African American comedy film written and directed by African-Americans with a multi-ethnic cast and a film that has received positive reviews from film critics but yet it received a very limited screening nationwide.  Definitely not cool.  But fortunately we get a solid Blu-ray release for ""Black Dynamite"" and if you have any interest in this film, I can easily recommend this film to be included in your collection.

""Black Dynamite"" is a film that just makes you laugh from beginning to end.  For those with familiarity with blaxpoitation and even old Kung-Fu films, you can't help but be amused and impressed by what the filmmakers were able to accomplish.  Even for those who aren't familiar with the films back then, there are enough jokes that viewers can still enjoy.  It's a well-crafted, very creative film that is worth checking out and worth owning, especially if you enjoy comedy films.  And yes, I am hoping that there is a sequel.

""Black Dynamite"" is a solid Blu-ray release and definitely recommended!",1265328000,18,7062,4.900589721988205
3897951,5,B002BWP3WA,"I saw this movie and I was laughing from beginning to end! It is the funniest movie that I have seen in a long time!!! The movie theater here in houston texas gave it a standing ovation!!! it should have gone mainstream at AMC!! not sure why?

My boy bull horn did an outstanding job!! He's come a long way since the DWC newsroom back in the Bronx!! I always knew he would be great at comedy!

This movie is a stone gas!! I'm sure that I missed some of it because I was laughing so much!!

If you liked the Hangover which was funny...you'll love this movie..by a mile!

3897952,4,B002BWP3WA,"This movie is just fun all around.  It never takes itself seriously, but doesn't come across as being self-righteous.  The script is fantastic, and I'd put it on the level of The Big Lebowski as far as being able to quote it all day long.  The music is great too and really captures the funky ass-kicking throughout the movie.

I have to admit, the theatrical version was not my favorite.  I saw a leaked version on the web that included all of the deleted scenes plus a few changes.  Personally I liked that version more, and I was hoping it would be included in the DVD.

3897954,5,B002BWP3WA,"Black Dynamite is probably the funniest most intelligent movie of 2009. The movie is filled with details that are an amalgam of Superfly, Dolemite, Willie the Pimp, Avenging Disco Godfather, and too many more to mention. The humor is subtle and over the top at the same time, but is presented with respect to the audience. This film bears multiple viewings, as you will not see every detail the first few time you watch it. It is subtle, it is gonzo, and it is probably the best film you will see from 2009. Brilliant movie.",1264464000,2,524,4.526315789473684
3897955,1,B002BWP3WA,"I'm a big fan of 70's Blaxploitation films, but you don't have to be to hate this. It was one of the most idiotic movies I have seen in a long time.

African action legend Black Dynamite goes after 'The Man' for killing his brother Jimmy, for pumping heroin into local orphanages and for flooding the ghetto with hopped-up malt liquor.

It's just so cliched and dumb.  So it's acceptable for a black person to use racial slurs against white people as long as its in a comedy huh?  And to shoot honkeys in the [blank]?  There was no moment in this movie where I completely lost my serious face.

I didn't laugh once in the theater, maybe just once but that was at a fat lady who had fallen out of her chair in the theater.

Pretty awful movie and it's a shame you can watch this film in Germany.",1264377600,6,794,4.218543046357616
3897956,5,B002BWP3WA,"I saw Black Dynamite this weekend and must say it's the most fun I've had at a movie since I first saw Airplane when I was a kid.  I was laughing non-stop from beginning to end and can't wait for the DVD version of it.  Seriously folks, a really GREAT comedy!",1263945600,2,259,4.0588235294117645
3897957,5,B002BWP3WA,"Definitely one of the best movies I've seen this year. Sure, the trailer gives you 75% of the good stuff from the movie, but in a world where so many trailers are better than the films themselves, this is really saying something. Black Dynamite (he never has any other name throughout the whole film) is riveting in nearly every scene he's in, and there were at least two laugh-out-loud funny scenes for me.

The film is also full of great lines:

- ""You're doing alright for yourself. Look at this place - you must have an 8-track in every room.""

- ""I get off in 15 minutes.""  - ""You're right about that.""

- ""How did you get in here?""  - ""I walked in.""

- ""I'm spending more on bail money than I'm gettin' in tail money.""

- ""I will not hesitate to lay the hammer down, on any clown, that comes around.""

Yes, there's lots of rhymin' jive in the movie, not to forget all the gratuitous mention of whiteys, Uncle Toms, crackers, and every other black cliche. The little things are really funny too, like the Captain Kangaroo Pimp, or the ""Chili and Donuts"" fast food joint. The sexy zodiac animation, as well as the over-the-top closing credits animationare also a nice touch. The ""seventies effects"" run throughout the film, such as the crazy driving scenes, and the ""Bruce Lee's deadliest duel"" daily workout is pretty outrageous.

The storyline gets ridiculous at one point, and the ""nefarious plot"" bit really outstays its welcome, but when it goes to the level of ""Enter the Dragon"" and then takes it one level higher, it really goes off the wall. I wonder if this one will become a cult classic on the level of ""The Big Lebowski.""",1263772800,4,1638,4.522033898305085
3897958,5,B002BWP3WA,"This is the FUNNIEST MOVIE I'VE SEEN IN MY LIFE.  (And I've been around since the ACTUAL 1970's.  And, I'm a MOVIE COLLECTOR.)  There are a LOT of funny movies out there, and a lot of different kinds of comedy that I like, dating back to classics from the 1930's; but for ME, this is THE BEST OF THE BEST.

Simply put, watch the trailer, which you can find either on youtube, or right here on Amazon, on the main Black Dynamite DVD product page.  Just below the product image of the DVD product, is a small video window with a trailer.  The movie is JUST LIKE THE TRAILER.  If you love the trailer, you'll love the movie.  I don't know HOW they made the ENTIRE MOVIE every bit as good as the trailer, but they did! (usually the trailer is always ""the best parts of the movie"" - not here!).

Most importantly, BOTH the main actor, AND the guy who did the soundtrack, have an obvious un-deniable LOVE for what they were doing.  It REALLY COMES THROUGH.  You can tell they THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND, and LOVE, this style of movie, and the classic 1960s-70s style of vintage soul music.  This entire movie was actually the brainchild of the lead actor, Michael Jai White, who himself is an avid Blaxploitation movie collector, who would invite friends over for parties where they'd watch old Blaxploitation films - then he started Dressing The Part in '70s suits & the afro wig - and it grew from there.

Black Dynamite is a real LABOR OF LOVE, and it's FROM THE HEART... and it's DY-NO-MITE!!  (Once you see the movie, you'll want to pick up the soundtrack album by multi-instrumentalist Adrian Younge, too!)",1263081600,28,1601,4.513888888888889

3898000,5,B002BWP3WA,"Hilarious! Scott Sanders and Michael Jai White get it right! I grew up on so-called ""Blaxploitation"" movies and have a love/cringe relationship with them today. Some of them are so cheaply made/edited that they are unintentionally funny. Black Dynamite mines the tropes and trots them out for solid belly laughs. Sanders and White obviously love the genre and do it proper justice. It's unfortunate that the studio botched the release. With an honest promotional campaign this film really could have earned its money back at the box office. Hopefully the DVD sales will right the wrong. Now... It's time for you to 'rip it up and out the ground and find out what's going down' with Black Dynamite.",1261526400,5,697,4.915254237288136
3898001,5,B002BWP3WA,"If you have even a smidgen of Blaxploitation film viewing under your belt you will LOVE Black Dynamite. I had the pleasure of seeing this in NYC a month ago with my friends. We were constantly bowled over laughing ourselves silly. From the opening moment to the ""sex"" scene to the climax, Black Dynamite lovingly parodies the genre while making a film that clearly looked and sounded like it was from the Grindhouse era.

Michael Jai White is absolutely the MAN and his performance is perfect. Purposely stilted (as is everyone else around him), White unleashes Kung Fu and Jive-talking-Fu to his many enemies and friends. The film's payoff is one of the funniest I've seen in years.

I appreciate all the love and stupendous silliness put into the making of Black Dynamite and I, for, one would love to see Mr. White return as the title character.

I hope the dvd has all the Fight Smack in the Orphanage site clips, that ""Ding Dong Roar"" rip on Sesame Street was almost as funny as the film.",1258761600,15,993,4.598870056497175
3898002,5,B002BWP3WA,"I pre-ordered ""Black Dynamite"" back in September. I patiently waited to receive the disc which should have been released on 11/17/2009. You can imagine how P.O.'d I was to open my package from Amazon on 11/19/2009 to find I'd been shipped ""Black Soul Dynamite"" a 3 disc collection of marginal 70's/80's exploitation films instead! Evidently the DVD release has been pushed back until early 2010 with not specific date given as of yet.

Amazon's customer support explained their shipping error. However no explanation was given as to why customers who pre-ordered the ""Black Dynamite"" DVD were not informed of the change in the release date or why the original orders were not put on hold.  Anyone else have this experience? Two big thumbs down to Amazon's customer support for not being on point informing it's customers about the pre-order status for this title.

Update 02/17/2009: I've finally viewed the DVD (courtesy of Redbox). Very Funny film overall. No real complaints here.  However I was hoping that the DVD extras would be more extensive. It would have also have been nice to included the alternate cut of the film that's circulating on the net for some time now.

I am not going to go too much into details as other reviews have covered the movie. I just want to give my 5 star rating as it is beyond funny. I was laughing pretty much none stop to the point of tearing up. Its been a long time since my face and stomach have hurt after watching a movie. As some other reviews online will say, the ending did go in a weird and kind of dumb direction but it really didn't take away from how great the rest of the movie was and its definitely worth seeing.",1258329600,3,659,3.925373134328358
3898004,5,B002BWP3WA,"Wow.  All i can say is Wow.  This movie was so damn funny that I started crying in the theater.  I had to wipe my eyes of the tears of laughter because I was missing the next scene.  If you like the Naked Gun film series, or ""I'm gonna git U sucka!"" Then Black Dynamite should be right up your alley.  So impeccably made to resemble the 1970's Blacksploitation films while incredibly tongue-in-cheek, Black Dynamite is just a non-stop laugh fest of obscure sight gags & goofy dialogue.  When the boom mic hits Black in the afro in the 1st 10 minutes I knew we were in for a good time!

It's really a damn shame that this movie fell on deaf ears, after 1 week in the theaters you couldn't even find local showtimes b/c it was bumped out but it is more than worth the little attention it received nationally.  I'll be buying copies of this movie on DVD for all my friends for Christmas without a doubt.  I predict that Black Dynamite will go down in film history as a great cult classic.  Ten years from now every college kid will have Black Dynamite in their Blu-Ray collection.  From the opening scene with Black Dynamite's brother Jimmy being found out as a rat, Black Dynamite hits the ground running & the audience hits the floor laughing.

I really can't say enough about Black Dynamite.  It is undeniably the most fun I've had in theaters in the last 5 years!  ""Main Man Black Dynamite!"" -  ""But Black Dynamite, I SELL DRUGS IN THE COMMUNITY!"" -  Classic comedy gold!

Buy Black Dynamite on DVD without a doubt that you will be entertained.  Fans of the Simpsons, Mr. Show, Always Sunny in Philadelphia will all enjoy Black Dynamite.",1258243200,71,1638,4.439597315436242
3898005,5,B002BWP3WA,"Michael Jai White is really the selling point of the film since he is Black Dynamite and you're with him the entire film. I hadn't seen much of White's work before this, but I'm definitely wanting to see more now. His fight scenes are top notch and from what I could tell, it looked like he did the majority of his own stunts. The word I've been hearing is that he's a fairly impressive actor overall, but has just never really picked the right roles and never really broke into the mainstream. Maybe after playing Gambol in The Dark Knight helped him out a bit because he definitely has a bright future as not only an action star, but an actor as well. Other than his superb martial arts work, White's comedic timing is also really important in a film like this and it really pays off. There's a scene where a boom mic is noticeably in the shot while Black Dynamite is giving a big speech. He draws attention to it by repeatedly glaring at the mic throughout the scene, but doesn't miss a beat of the dialogue. Ridiculous scenes like that were crucial in the overall enjoyment factor of the film.

Black Dynamite may not be for everyone, but it will be hilariously awesome for most who actually get to see it. The film somehow manages to blend comedy as absurd and ridiculous as films like Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy or Zoolander and have hard hitting action scenes that are noticeably a tribute to classic Bruce Lee films. This blaxploitation parody comes highly recommended, can you dig it?",1258243200,5,1504,4.529411764705882

It has everything you could want- action, humor, more action, more humor... some romance tossed in.... you just can't beat this obvious labor of love from Michael Jai White and Scott Sanders. It's an ode to the old 70's films but is earnest in its love, not derogatory.  The humor is witty and the action is amazing... it's as close to a perfect film as I've seen in years!  Bravo!

The film has everything from the classic ""afro centric"" dialog, to the horrible acting and editing to the semi porno sounding score, and custom soundtrack ( all done on purpose to mimic the production value of the classic blacksploitation films.)  The writing is pitch perfect, and Michael Jai White plays Black Dynamite to a tee.  There are tons of cameo appearances from the comedians of hollywood Tommy Davidson being one of the standout supports.  If you are looking for a high quality Hollywood film...then you won't get the joke...and this may not be for you.  Black Dynamite is a treat for the eyes and the funny bone, and in my opinion lets Michael Jai White shine in a way that even his staring vehicles have yet to do.
