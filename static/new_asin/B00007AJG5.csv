1804604,5,B00007AJG5,"I had this movie along time ago before dvd's were created. Always enjoyed all the fine actors and one of my favorite repeat movies. Nick nolte, Tim Hutton , and Armand Assante fan. Great proformance by Paul Caldern another great actor .",1396656000,,236,4.642857142857143

1804606,4,B00007AJG5,"My tastes do not like my favorite actors being the bad guys so I always watch movies like Q&A and Perfect Murder with a little caution. However, I liked the Death Wish and the Substitute movies because of perceived justice happening. But, when cops tend to get even with all bad guys by getting even with a few I get squemish.

However, a 4 star rating means that I will watch it again so it has to be well made, a good story, good acting, and entertaining. Nick Nolte in 48 hours was so good that I have been a fan ever since. So he can do no wrong. No not so. He has been in some crappy movies. One about football comes to mind. This was bittersweet. Is that the term for wanting the good guy to win when he may not?",1389744000,,718,4.020979020979021

1804619,4,B00007AJG5,The bad guys were well done - the good guys were pretty thin - and the sex star was terrible. Nick was very good - but no fun like in 48 Hours.,1233360000,,143,3.5
1804620,2,B00007AJG5,"Apart from establishing the premises of the plot, I didn't find the first hour or very intriguing - quite the contrary actually.  The relationship story between Hutton and his ex-girlfriend was appalling.  Those scenes played out like a bad soap-opera and had me fearing the worst for what was to come. Lumet should have kept his daughter out of it (and all scenes relating to it). It took a while for me to get used to Nolte as the bad guy too, as I've never seen him play the full-on villain before (he's usually the hard-edged good guy).  He was as over-the-top as many of the other players in this cop corruption movie (doesn't Sidney Lumet do anything besides cop-corruption movies?), and there were times when I could swear Timothy Hutton was trying to remember his lines.

Surprisingly, I actually found myself getting interested for a while somewhere near the last third of the movie when ""character development"" and the study of racism fade out to actual plot.  Actually got interested to see if they were gonna nail him as the setting shifted over to Cuba and I had to pay attention less to ""character performances"" and got to see more story-line action.  There are still too many names and subplots though which could make more sense if you were insane enough to watch it a second time.  Some pretty sordid *#%&! thrown in as well for good measure. If I'd paid attention more maybe I'd have got more from it (but I doubt it).  It was painful to watch much of the time to be truthful. This movie tries to take itself very seriously but there were moments near the end where I was almost ready to laugh it was so stupid.

Amazon reviewer does a pretty fair job with this one.  It starts off with some interest, smoulders under lame stereotype scenarios for the next hour, actually starts moving fast again as the ending approaches, then loses it's pace and continues to get lost in names and convoluted action until, until.. you realize you've been had.  I'm surprised I made it to the end actually.  This movie had a bad amateurish feel and just wouldn't end.  Enjoy.",1205280000,,2077,4.596205962059621
1804621,5,B00007AJG5,"Excellent performances by the three leading actors two of them with well defined roles, the third one, Nolte, at the line between bad and good with a clear definition of values at the end.",1173657600,,188,4.5588235294117645
1804622,5,B00007AJG5,"Well directed film with amazing performance by Nick Nolte...

Nolte gives one of the most scary performances of a bad cop ever...

Conveys the complexity and superficial front of a corrupt police officer...

Timothy Hutton is also very good as a new guy who is assigned to the case...",1171497600,,284,4.755102040816326
1804623,4,B00007AJG5,"Nick Nolte plays a tough cop who plays rough but always gets his man. He is much respected by all his companions and bosses. However, all is not what it seems because sometimes things come out his way because he fixes them so they do. There is a chain of corruption going all the way to the top and of course the inevitable chief looking to be appointed governor. Poor Al does what he can to trap Nick Nolte's character and despite the deaths of various shady characters who ""won't be missed"" he does it but all ends in a great disappointment for him when the ""Powers that Be"" decide that the best thing would be to forget all about it and let everything carry on as before. He complies because he is ""blackmailed"" by the department threatening to bring out some of the shady dealings of his late father which would reduce the pension to which his mother is entitled.",1155686400,,867,4.391304347826087
1804624,3,B00007AJG5,"I've been an avid movie watcher and fan - especially of action movies - since I was in 5th or 6th grade.  I remember begging my Mom to take me to see ""Lethal Weapon,"" but she had reservations about her 9 year old seeing such things.  One way or another, I won out and as we watched the movie together she slowly realized I was able to handle such a movie and, looking back, this was where I became a true film buff.  Soon after, all gloves were off.  Next came ""Die Hard"" and Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and Steven Seagal movies.  I used to wait impatiently for the weekends to roll around so I could get to the local Pick-N-Save video store and rent the latest releases.  So much so, they knew me there - like, who was this kid and how can he possibly understand or enjoy half the titles he rents?  I mention all this because ""Q & A"" was one movie I remember picking up the box countless times at the Pick-N-View, not knowing the actors, or even understanding that the title meant ""question and answer;"" I thought it was two guy's names, like ""Tango & Cash,"" but I always felt drawn to it.  I passed it over again and again in my youth.  But a few years ago I got on a Nick Nolte kick, for some reason, and realized I had never actually seen this movie.  Imagine my regret when suddenly this movie, that I held the VHS box of over and over again as a kid, was suddenly hard to come across.  So more years went by and from time to time this movie would pop into my mind, but I could never find it.  Then yesterday I was at Wal-Mart and there was a display of movies for $3.88.  ""Q & A"" was one of them.  Now, $3.88 is less than a rental fee, not to mention I may have been willing to pay even more for it just because I couldn't believe after all this time of not seeing it anywhere, there it was.

It's probably a good thing that I did not pick this one up as a kid because it is not the action movie that I thought it looked to be.  Years later, after becoming a huge fan of ""NYPD Blue"" and that type of police drama (character driven, gritty, and realistic) sometime in the last 10 years or so was probably the best time to finally watch this movie.

That was a long preamble to a simple review.  ""Q & A"" is extremely well written.  The dialog, situations and characters feel completely life-like.  The movie grabs you from the start, and even though there are no big action sequences, you remain enthralled and entertained by the story itself.  Unfortunately, the movie does not sustain those attributes.  What is a fascinating character study for the first hour and a half soon wears thin and turns to clichs.  The movie is over-long anyway, so it would have solved two problems by cutting out a half hour or so.  I would argue it could use a shot of adrenaline, but I think if it were a tight 90 to 100 minutes, trimming the fat and leaving the best stuff in, all the adrenaline that is needed is provided by the dialog, story and performances.  The movie is also interesting as an inter-racial interaction character study.  But after the 90 minute mark or so, everything goes over the top in a way that a gritty, real life drama just should not do.  And the movie is no more exciting or action packed for it, so why bother.  Certain subplots could also have been jettisoned.

Over all this is a flawed, but still compelling film that's worth a look; especially if you are a fan of gritty, dialog and character driven police procedurals.  They just needed an editor and/or a script doctor for the final third of the film.  But I can say this:  ""Q & A"" is easily the best DVD I have ever purchased for $3.88.  It's also the only one, but worth every penny.  Ten bucks?  I'm not so sure.

If you dig this film, or this TYPE of movie, also try ""Serpico,"" ""Bad Lieutenant,"" ""Cop Land,"" ""Narc,"" ""Dark Blue,"" and the recently released (as of this writing) ""Dirty"" and ""16 Blocks.""",1150243200,,3878,4.2571819425444595

1804627,1,B00007AJG5,"Watching this film is a little like being a spectator at a bad acting competition, with spot prizes for wooden expressions to play for. Jenny Lumet wins both, with extra credit for random overacting, but Timothy Hutton puts up a grand fight for second place. The script is wordy way past the point of tedium: it HAS to be based on a bad play. It's like a very literate writer trying desperately to be authentic, but unwilling to discard a single line he's ever heard in a cop movie. Never mind: you can have a fine time playing 'count the hard-boiled cop cliches'. Cheap special effects, along with a listless score and jarring theme song,reinforce the impression that nobody's heart was in it.
Some distinguished people were associated with the making of this film. I hope they've had a good long think about what they've done.",1081468800,,828,4.678082191780822
1804628,5,B00007AJG5,"Being a nyc hispanic native i know this film is true in its essence. the performances especially by nolte are fabulous. nolte should have at least been nominated for his portrayal of a nyc corrupt cop. if you have lived in nyc this is a film that you should see for its location scences and gritty story. one reviewer wrote what did the main character (hutton) see in her, i can tell you she was smoking hot in the film. i am surprised i have never seen her in anything else  and that is a shame..  there is also a touch of humor especially when the evil nolte meets his maker. however the scene between blumenfeld(character) and hutton towards the end about things being buried is very haunting in deed considering the atmosphere that we all live in this society.",1072915200,,764,4.45
1804629,5,B00007AJG5,"This is a must-have for anyone seeking a gritty portrait of the shadier slice of life in New York. This movie has it all- corruption in high places, police brutality, institutional racism etc. Nolte turns in a really great performance!",1054771200,,235,4.9
1804630,3,B00007AJG5,"While  I agree with some reviewers who felt that this film started off strongly then fell off a bit as it progressed, I have to take issue with a couple of reviews that stated (not verbatim) that the racial politics of NYC as depicted in the film do not accurately reflect real life. One reviewer (the Amazon critic, I believe) went so far as to refer to the race dynamics in Q&A as far-fetched.
Wellllll.. as a Latino, raised in the Big Apple but having spent much time up and down the East Coast, I have to respectfully disagree on that one. Granted, Q & A does take liberties with the interpersonal-relationships-as-microcosm-of-the-social-picture thing, but the actors, some of whose performances go waaaay over the top, are more to blame than the story itself .
The film is based on a book by Edwin Torres, who also authored After Hours and Carlito's Way, both of which provided the basis for the Al Pacino starrer of the latter name.  Torres, who grew up in Spanish Harlem, wrote these books while working as an Assistant District Attorney in Manhattan. He is now a Judge in Manhattan District Court. Point being that though the general suspicion and distrust among the races might appear to some of us in the 21st century as inaccurate, they are based on Torres' observations of the various peoples in and around Spanish Harlem during the 1960s and 70s, and are actually quite on target.
Anyone who has ever found themselves staring down the business end of a police department-issued service pistol during a routine traffic stop can attest to this. And I say this not as a gripe, or as a means of using this forum as an online soapbox, but to state that sometimes, just sometimes, the veracity of a world create for the screen but based on ""real life"" can only be determined by the subjective views of those who've experienced it, one way or the other. But don't take my word for it, ask a cop, white, black, Latino or whatever else, if race plays a part in how people treat him or her when they answer a call.
That said, Q & A does present a bleak, seemingly hopeless picture, but viewers shouldn't fault it for not providing cut-and-dried solutions to our social problems. Instead, watch it as a small slice of life, as experienced by a select few, and glean your own answers.",1053907200,,2286,4.58679706601467
1804631,5,B00007AJG5,".
A truly gripping, action-packed and yet really moving cop film with a _raw_ complex plot (no other way to describe it) and some absolutely brilliant performances by Nick Nolte (as Brennan, a puritanical white cop too blurred by his convictions to see the error of his racist, reckless ways), Armand Assante (as a latin drug warlord and the antagonist of Nolte's character) and Timothy Hutton (as Riley, an ex-cop lawyer assigned now by the DA's office to investigate Nolte).
This is no LA Confidential or City Hall because there is much lesser of Hollywood here. Instead, expect some in-your-face narrative of police corruption, compromised idealism, racism, even a pithy take on homosexuality. The biggest surprise is the Puertorican druglord character played to the T by Armand Assante, right down to latin American quirks and verbal cadence - easily Oscar nomination material.
What's a review without some gripes though, so here. The one thing that befuddles the plot a little is the character of Riley's subplot romantic interest. Lumet's daughter herself played this role and I found her to be more than a little taut. This little apparition of an ex-love will have you wondering about what it means to the story otherwise (clue: not much) especially a reference to Riley being surprised on seeing his latin american girlfriend's father because he was black. Why this was anything special I do not know -- I'd be surprised to have a latin girlfriend for 2 years and then see her father and find out that he was black. If there was some highfalutin racism meme intended, I'd venture to say it fell flat on its foot.
Secondly, perhaps some (only some) scenes may be a tad overdone in terms of their dramatic rendering e.g., a totally unnecessary scene with a transvestite prostitute snitching away in front of the druglord or a scene with Nolte dealing with prostitutes and actually groping one of them to determine whether (s)he was a woman. Such needless scenes, and there are preciously few of them thankfully, somewhat bogged down the otherwise perfect pace of the movie.
Nonetheless, this is quite an intelligent film with a very real, gripping theme and terrific acting all round. Definitely worth at least a good evening's rental.",1052092800,,2242,4.965425531914893
1804632,4,B00007AJG5,"I thought it to be an exciting police drama about corruption within the force.  Excellent performances by most, although what the Timothy Hutton character saw in Nancy Bosch (Jenny Lumet) eludes me.

1804633,4,B00007AJG5,"Like Glengarry Glen Ross, the film itself is average--a typical Lumet film which rails against the system but does nothing to solve it's inherent problems.

7974750,5,B00007AJG5,Brilliant,1523145600,,9,9.0
7974751,5,B00007AJG5,"This later effort by Sidney Lumet demonstrates that he did not lose his ability to serve up a cinematic gut punch.  Adapting Edwin Torres' novel Lumet posits the idea that the institutional corruption inherent in law enforcement is a microcosm of society as a whole.  True heroes or villains are hard to find possibly Lee Richardson's world weary assistant D.A. being an exception.  Heck, Armand Assante's drug dealer is one of the more nobler figures here.  Brutality, corruption, and bigotry rule the roost.  The film's most despicable figure, vicious cop Nick Nolte in another admirable turn, engenders a modicum of sympathy.  Survival in this cesspool requires some degree of compromise.  If you read this film correctly it isn't entirely an exercise of cynicism.  Watch the last shot of the film carefully and there is a suggestion of hope for this cruel unforgiving world.  As for the work of the ensemble cast, impeccable.  Kudos to Jenny Lumet, the director's daughter, for offering a complex reading of Assante's biracial girlfriend.  A possible false note may be Patrick O'Neal being a tad old for the character he was playing but effective nonetheless.  When released in 1990 this film was met with a mixed critical and commercial reception.  In these politically correct times it may meet a similar fate because of its frankness particularly in its portrayal of gays.  Regardless, another feather in Lumet's cap.",1519344000,,1424,5.108225108225108
