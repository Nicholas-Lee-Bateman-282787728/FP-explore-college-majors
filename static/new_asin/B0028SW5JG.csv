3874331,5,B0028SW5JG,"Ordered for my mom, a big fan.  It arrived quickly, sealed etc... No problems.  Haven't given it to her yet but assume it works fine.  Would buy from seller again.",1291680000,2,163,4.366666666666666
3874332,5,B0028SW5JG,"The tongue belongs to Judge Judy, the pint-sized Queen Bee of the Judge shows where she cheerfully presides hurling barbed insults at the litigants before her.  Where else can you watch a jurist perched behind her bench, wearing a black robe with a white-laced collar and red wig(she's grey off camera)litigating small claim cases, where her kindest words for both plaintiff and defendant are ""moron"" and the ever popular ""idiot"". She's my kind of gal, I know a lot of morons and idiots but I hold my tongue and just admire the way she tosses around such adjectives with unbridled glee.

Sometimes you start to feel bad for the poor creatures who appear before her, but any cash judgements she awards are paid by the production company, so that softens the abuse somewhat.

Judge Judy has hinted she may soon hang up her robe and that would be a shame, because the older she gets the meaner and crankier she will get and just imagine the tongue lashings she will administer then.

If I had a small claim case I would happily appear before Judge Judy and bare the shredding, as long as at the end of the day I am pocketing a check for 5 grand. I'd suffer the acid-dipped tongue but cash the check. Case closed.",1276387200,17,1209,4.532110091743119

3874343,5,B0028SW5JG,Judge Judy is unique in her environment of the court room. She is quick with the humorous comment and has no problem with putting someone down who needs it.,1361145600,,156,4.413793103448276
3874344,3,B0028SW5JG,"I purchased this as a gift for my mother, Judge Judy's #1 fan.  The picture indicates this is a nice boxed set of two DVDs, when in reality, I received two DVD cases held together with shrink wrap.  Misleading and crappy.  The quality of the printing on the DVDs was pretty simplistic and looks like it could have been produced in someone's basement; just simple black and white lettering.  There was no effort to clear up any of the film quality.  There's no high def stuff here.  No closed captioning either, which makes no sense since CBS already did this when the show aired.

It was very clear you weren't getting a lot of episodes from the start, with only 100 and 105 minutes per DVD, but there are a fair number of bonus features: Interviews, promos, and things of that nature.  Most of these cases look like they're at least a decade old, so long time fans probably won't remember them.  They also don't feature credits at the end of each episode, which is great for people like my mom who don't want to watch them (and irritating for people like myself who like that kind of trivia/info).  If you just want some episodes of Judge Judy, these are the only couple of DVDs available, and my mom loved and watched these immediately.  However, I was disappointed with the quality of the packaging and the DVDs themselves.

If CBS would release either an entire season of Judge Judy or just more DVDs in general, I'd absolutely buy them for my mother.  I realize putting a show on DVD with different people on every episode would be a challenge, but I think they'd be pleasantly surprised with the sales.  Hope they'll consider this in the future.",1356480000,10,1651,4.533783783783784
3874355,5,B0028SW5JG,"in over twenty years and only two dvd's
maybe she knows what she's doing
but seriously, stop co-signing loans people",1353542400,,116,4.85
3874356,5,B0028SW5JG,"I have been a fan of Judge Judy (and also the People's Court) for many years and my 90+ year old mother became a fan as well. When she became an invalid and could no longer leave home, I bought this DVD set to send to her. She has watched it until she memorized it. For myself, I have learned a great deal about the law from watching court TV and this has been valuable to me as I became an entrepreneur. It is a fun and easy way to learn the law. It is also a lesson in how to conduct your personal and business affairs and to be a responsible citizen. While Judge Judy is sometimes given to throwing out the law or being a bit inconsistent in her rulings (cause she gets disgusted with one or both litigants) she does send a strong message to viewers to obey the law, to not lie in court or try to embellish your story and to do what's right. I like that. Watching the DVDs helps you avoid annoying commercials, and I like that too.",1351900800,2,934,4.054054054054054
3874357,5,B0028SW5JG,"I think this is the best programme on television and if I could ever meet Judge Judy and attend one of her shows, it would really make my day.",1350604800,2,142,3.9310344827586206
3874358,4,B0028SW5JG,"The two-pack contains the same 2 DVDs that are featured in ""buy all 3"", which makes no sense and is misleading. Why is this shown this way? I thought I was buying 4 different DVDs, when in fact I got 2 copies of each, and now have to go through the hassle of returning the 2 duplicates.",1343260800,3,286,4.035087719298246
3874359,5,B0028SW5JG,I used to watch this show on tv and it was good. Actually it still is. Theese cases are anyway. My two favorite are when the couple sue a limosine service after they caused them to miss their prom and the girl who sues the popular kid at school for the cost of her dress after he stood her up for the homecoming dance. A lot of the others are good too. the only problem is that some of them are a little to serious. However you should still get it because its good.,1341187200,,465,3.9574468085106385
3874360,5,B0028SW5JG,I bought this as a gift for a family member. She enjoyed it and it was shipped fast just in time for Christmas. Highly satisfied with this Dvd set of Judge Judy.,1326153600,,161,4.0625

3874362,4,B0028SW5JG,"series is good and comical, judge is easy to understand and i like her sense of humor there have been some cases where i think she brazenly overreacts but this is a show..so that is understandable she does tend to go on tangents if you don't want to hear her rant at someone then don't buy it.",1311897600,,293,4.157894736842105
3874363,1,B0028SW5JG,I already had the singles. I was lead to believe these would be two different Judge Judy episodes. This was a scam. It was advertised with the two singles plus the 2-pack. But the 2-pack consisted of the same 2 singles. SO  I got stuck with 2 each of the SAME dvd's. Shame on you.,1308441600,4,280,4.090909090909091

8356947,1,B0028SW5JG,As funny as it was to see judy yell at people this show has more commercials than show. Not to mention the horrible editing especially after the case has ended you can tell they are piecing together what the people are saying about their cases. Reminds you this show is fake. What really ruined this show for me is the ungodly amount of commercials. If you really want to see this show you can watch it commercial free on youtube. I guess it doesnt matter who judge judy is screaming at as long as she is screaming at someone?,1429920000,,526,4.3232323232323235

8356955,5,B0028SW5JG,I have always been a Judge Judy fan so I was really excited to find it on DVD. I don't know why people complain about the packaging.
