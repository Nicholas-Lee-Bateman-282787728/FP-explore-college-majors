599194,4,6303202225,"Rocket science it's not, but it is a good action flick.  Ice-T plays a homeless man who is tricked into going on a hunt where he becomes the hunted.  What it lacks in dialouge and character buildup, it makes up for  in pure adrenaline.  Gary Busey does a great job playing a demented hunter.  This is a good movie for DVD because of the explosions and superior sound.  If you want to watch a movie that will get your heart pumping and your  mind flatlining, buy it.  It's worth it.",961372800,5,481,4.266666666666667
599195,3,6303202225,"This is a moderately suspenseful action film with a stellar cast, some breathtaking mountain cinematography and a great musical score. In terms of dramatic tension and scripting, it is by no means in the same league as the  likes of ""Deliverance"", ""Southern Comfort"", or even  John Woo's more stylish rendering of virtually the same theme, ""Hard  Target"", with Jean-Claude Van Damme. I do feel, however, that critics  and audiences alike have been too severe in dismissing it, since it is a  tale that affords plenty of entertainment and amusement.",959299200,9,548,5.112359550561798
599196,3,6303202225,"You've heard about southern prejudice where humans are hunted for sport. Ernest Dickerson does a good job of balancing his cast where he establishes that this story is not about white on black crime. Ice T is a transvient  who becomes convinced by Charles Dutton to accept an offer to go hunting.  After being flown to a remote cabin in the woods, T finds out that he is  the one being hunted the next morning. Ice T is convincing but works little  on dialogue to make his character likeable and Dutton is so likeable that  he fools everybody. The setup is too confusing. Not until Gary Buseys  dinner speech do we feel something is about to happen. Ice T could've been  less hardened at first making his heroic chracter more likeable. The  scenery is beautiful and editing well done. Good performances by some great  actors like Gary Busey and F Murray Abraham. This adventure into the dark  side of the human mind is very predictable with some minor surprises. Not  executed well enough to be for everybody. If you like psychologcal  thrillers, you'll accept the movies shortcomings. Ice T as well as many  actors from hip hop need to work on they're three dimensions of character.  To Ice T's credit though he's good at geting the bad guys!",958780800,,1243,4.6422018348623855
599197,3,6303202225,"Surviving the Game came traipsing in a year after Jean-Claude Van Damme's much more popular Hard Target. Both films featured down-on-their-luck men being used as human prey for rich. bloodthirsty psycho's desperate for the thrill of the kill. Ice-T is a good actor, but not in this film he ain't. Though he still out-performs JCVD as the man on the lam.

T plays Jack Mason, a Seattle hobo plucked from the streets and given a job in the wilderness. Without asking any serious questions or growing suspicious he sheepishly accepts the offer. Upon arriving at a remote forest cabin (actually Lake Wenatchee Airport, if you don't mind me spoiling the magic) he meets a bunch of wealthy weirdos and is well fed and watered. When he wakes the next morning Mason discovers that his job is to run as fast as he can back to civilization.

Director Earnest Dickerson has no control over his cast and allows them to overact to ludicrous degrees. F. Murray Abraham, Oscar or no Oscar, has no idea what he's doing. Gary Busey turns up, goes mental, and then exits (a stupid mistake as he's the most interesting character). John C. McGinley goes over the edge with the minimal of back-story, which only just starts getting interesting before he too exits. It's like they actually wanted to strip the film of any engaging substance.

They try to inject some kind of subtext with the character names. Mason is the everyday working man. He is hunted by men called Hawkins, Griffin, Mr. Wolf and Wolf Jnr. He is employed by men called Cole and Burns, and taken to a place called Hell's Canyon. If writer Eric Bernt was trying to be clever it's lost in the bumbling incompetence that cripples the action scenes.

The whole film is shot like a cheap TV movie, which is twice a let-down as Dickerson himself is a former cinematographer who really ought to know better. The editing is a joke (dead characters mysteriously reappear in some shots as well as the fact that both day AND night seem to last all of two minutes out in the wilderness). The dialogue is terrible, and frequently badly ADR-ed as a quick fix to the consistently poor narrative. A sense of place and location is apparently irrelevant...

What does STG have in its favor? Um...nice music and pleasant scenery. In a film with a wide cast of character actors playing psychos in a story that has been the inspiration for many other action movies that's a pretty disappointing couplet when you're trying hard to recommend it. Stewart Copeland's score IS very good though, and I'm surprised it's not on CD. And the lovely hills and mountains of the Pacific-Northwest will no doubt inspire you to go out for a summertime hike.

Surviving the Game could have been great, but is merely an incredibly dumb, badly-directed pot-boiler, and a massive guilty pleasure.

The DVD, released in December 1999, looks like crap. The back cover features still from a scene not featured in the movie. The extras are minimal. Warner ought to put this out on Blu Ray.",944956800,7,2994,4.713193116634799
599198,5,6303202225,"The acting is superb,the characters have depth,the plot makes sense,the scenery(mountains like NorthernCA) is beautiful, and no sex scenes,and no hideous,senseless violence. In my opinion,the director and everyone on the  crew was excellent,to get all that stuff right,the director deserves alot  of credit. If you like survival movies,tactics,strategy,etc you will love  the movie. If you like IceT you will love the movie,Gary Busey is nuts as  usual (awesome)Odds are there will be a character in the movie that you  will identify with. The movie is powerful and moving. Get it.

599267,5,6303202225,"One of my favorite movies. The movie looks great on this re-released DVD. The only issue I noticed with picture quality was one small scene where Mason rolls off the cliff, it looks like VHS footage (it's only like a 2 second scene, but it was noticeable). Other than that it was fine. This DVD is basically a re-release of the old DVD so it has those old type of Special Features, where's it's just text of what movie the actor played in previously. It would have been nice for this to be re-released with at least a commentary track or short documentary/interviews with the cast.

Other than the minor issues I have with it, it's still a great buy of what used to be an out of print DVD.",1500854400,,689,4.3

599788,4,6303202225,"I  think  the  beginning  of  this  film  started  out  in  Los Angeles,  &  it  ended  in  Seattle.
Mason  (Ice T)  is  a  homeless  person  &  lives  on  the  streets.  Him  his  dog  &  that  old  man  named  Hank.  &  Cole  (Charles  Dutton)  after  getting  a  good  look  at  Mason  &  seeing  how tough  he  is  while  threatening  a  police  officer  trying  to  defend  Hank,  he  sort  of  follows  him  around.  Cole  always  hides  his  true  character  identity  under  some  charity  institution  or  whatever  you  call  it.  Going  around  helping  the  needy  &  homeless  people  by  giving  free  lunches.  &  searches  for  those  whom  he  thinks  have  got  enough  guts!
While  searching  for  something  to  eat  in  a  dumpster  Mason  finds  a  handgun,  Hank  says  the  first  thing  you  do  when  you  find  a  gun  is  check  to  see  if  its  loaded.  Then  if  you  feel  uncomfortable  about  handling  one  the  best  thing  to  do  is  get  rid  of  it.
Life  is  tough  for  Mason,  he  doesn't  want  anyone's  help  &  is  reluctant  to  take  any  job  because  he  doesn't  want  to  be  taken  advantage  of.  However  he  does  have  a  change  of  heart  when  Cole  tells  him  to  go  find  a  guy  named  Burns  (Rutger Hauer)  to  find  out  what  he  can  about  a  job  in  the  wilderness.  You'd  think  they'd  only  need  help  gutting  animals  then  skinning  them  or  filling  deer  feeders,  This  definitely  is  a  twist  for  extreme!!!!!!!!!!
I  won't  deny  this  movies  got  the  action!  But  be  prepared  for  kind  of  a  half  action  half  horror  type  of  movie.  Burns  promises  Mason  a  good  job  which  pays  very  well,  he  advances  him  20.00  then  200.00.  Then  fly  out  to  a  cabin  a  long  ways  from  the  city,
&  Mason  meets  the  other  guys  Hawkins  (Gary Busey)  &  Mr. Wolf  (Abram  F Murray)  (An Innocent  Man),  they  love  a  good  challenge  to  see  just  how  much  guts  one  man  has,  All  the  time  they're  thinking  is  this  guy  a  good  competitor.  The  rest  of  them  they'd  killed  in  the  past  were  no  contest  for  them.  Too  easy  for  them.
I  liked  Hawkins  story  about  Prince  Henry  Stout  who  use  to  be  his  dog.  &  then  one  day  his  father  forces  him  to  fight  him  to  the  death.  So  he  could  discover  his  manhood.  Mason  may  have  said  he  left  his  wife  &  kids  to  die,  &  he  was  calling  himself  a  murderer.  To  me  I  think  that  whatever  he  did  he  didn't  mean  it.
However  the  following  morning  Mason  learns  a  rotten  surprise,  he's  the  victim!  &  the  hunted.  Its  no  job  at  all! But  a  quest  for  one  to  fight  for  his  life,  &  I  guess  to  see  how  smart  you  are.  Burns  &  Cole  had  played  a  trick  on  him.  The  son  of  Mr.  Wolf  whoever  he  is  in  real  life  seemed  to  be  the  only  one  aside  from  Mason  who  appeared  to  be  startled.  While  everyone  else  was  spitting  in  his  face  &  treating  him  like  a  piece  of  garbage!  Which  its  not  every  day  that  you  wake  up  &  find  a  gun  pointed  at  you  as  quick  as  your  getting  out  of  bed,  realizing  this  could  be  your  last  day  on  earth!  One  by  one  he  outsmarts  his  pursuers.  He  had  been  brought  up  to  believe  that  Burns  &  Cole  were  his  friends.  He  puts  up  a  pretty  fair  fight  with Hawkins  after  setting  the  cabin  on  fire,  &  manages  to  buy  himself  a  little  more  time  before  they  continue  their  chase.  These  guys  don't  hunt  bear  or  elk  or  deer  but  vagrants.  Yet  we  come  to  realize  somebody  does  have  good  techniques  after  all  when  it  comes  to  using  your  head.  Mason  jumps  off  a  high  cliff,  kidnaps  one  of  them  &  takes  the  walkie  talkie  thing  away  from  him  to  communicate  with  Burns.  He  also  tells  his  story  to  Griffith  who  comes  to  his  senses  the  following  day  &  gets  killed  for  trying  to  turn  against  Burns  &  the  rest  of  the  group.  Mason  also  cuts  down  a  tree  by  shooting  at  it  to  make  a  bridge  across  the  ravine.  He's  no  fool  &  he's  going  to  do  whatever  it  takes  to  survive.  Okay  yeah  &  so  much  for  the  rest  of  the  gang  trying  to  confront  him,  now  its  just  him  &  Burns!  Burns  thought  he  could  get  away  by  returning  to  his  office,  Mason  though  shows  up  dismantles  the  car,  &  hides  in  the  alley  to  get  a  good  advantage  on  Burns.  Burns  wasn't  as  smart  as  he  thought  he  was,  I  believe  he  thought  Mason  was  unloading  the  gun  as  he  walked  away.  He  might  have  just  put  the  empty  shell  back  in  the  barrel,  I  couldn't  say  for  sure,  But  Burns  got  it  bad!!
Good  movie!  Its  not  for  everybody  though!  One  part  is  so  gross  you  may  want  to  fast  forward  through  it!  In  this  show  one  will  truly  learn  of  another  mans  cunning!  Afterwards  I  guess  Mason  went  back  to  being  a  homeless  person  wandering  the  streets  again.  Being  homeless  is  one  thing,  but  its  another  to  challenge  ones  dignity!",1444521600,,5205,4.118266978922716

I'm being quite generous here, but I'm giving it a 5-star rating anyway - just for the scenery, the background music, and the fact that it's a greatly-revised version of the original film ""The Most Dangerous Game"" from back in the late '20's or early '30's.

It is amazing how Ice-T was outsmarting them on every turn. It shows that, just because you are homeless and might not be dressed in a suit, we are still people.

Lots of landscape cinematography and plenty of action. So come on New Line Cinema bring this to blu-ray already!!!!",1310169600,,264,4.760869565217392
600716,3,6303202225,"Surviving the Game (1994) is an adrenalin, action-packed movie that
is overdone at times, to the point that it's almost comical,
otherwise psychotic, which is not altogether surprising considering
the roster, which includes Rutger Hauer (of Blade Runner, Spetters,
Hitcher, Bone Daddy etc fame), as well as Gary Busey (Under Siege,
Eye of the Tiger, etc fame) and a few others lesser known, as well
as the rapper Ice-T, a unique actor in his own right.

Once again, for some, this movie's action goes overboard, and
becomes somewhat laughable. At the same time, the special effects,
the action, quick pace of the story keeps viewers on the eye of
their seats.

Although a predictable to a certain extent, the story unfolds
logically, and the charisma of the actors contributes in holding
and tying everything together.

This is a keeper, and does have some replay value ...for the
special effects and roster of actors in the movie.",1307145600,2,931,4.955128205128205
600717,4,6303202225,"For everyone who gave this movie a one or two star score, maybe you should watch it again. First off, set aside the overdone premise and the monotonous acting of Ice-T and look at the rest of the cast and the production values. The cinematography was excellent with beautiful Pacific Northwest views as well as some good action sequences. The cast is excellent in their roles, some subdued like Rutger Hauer as the cool, cold-blooded leader of the hunt and Charles Dutton's misleading benefactor turned group bulldog and never once losing his temper.
Then you come to the other side of the human personna-the loonies. Some of these roles border on ""camp"" and give the film a much needed comic side. As always, Gary Busey will endeavor to be the lead nut. His story of his ""Birth mark"" is chilling and his actions in the hunt are ones of a primitive. F. Murray Abraham is excellent as the Wall Street power who unleashes his inner demons in the wild. However, kudos go to John C. McGinley for his portayal as a man who can't come to grips with his daughter's unsolved murder and has just given up on his life. He is just looking to exact revenge on his daughter's killer by making Ice T a parallel to him and savoring his opportunity to get even.

The homeless guy (Ice-T) is up front about his lack of wilderness expertise, but is desperate for the money so agrees.

The rich guys (Rutger Hauer and Charles S. Dutton) fly him to the northwest for the ""hunt"".  There they are joined by the other four hunters.

Ice-T learns, early on, that it's him they are going to be hunting.  The movie shows how this one, insignificant homeless, down on his luck nobody, can outsmart the richest of the rich, the wealthy men who would have him as their trophy.",1286668800,,815,4.442953020134228

600842,3,6303202225,"The latest instalment in Sid the Elf's review file is Surviving the Game starring the impressive Ice-T(the fourth best acting rapper ever!), Gary Busey(YES!), and Charles S. Dutton who had such illustrious roles as TV's Roc and that wierd groundskeeper from Rudy who let that little leprachaun live in his office. Sid has to have a little soft spot for this one because it's as if someone saw the ledgendary Death Ring and said ""You know what? This movie could be good if we put some money into it and got some D-list actors, instead of brothers and sons of D-list actors!""

However, we must say, Surviving the Game fell short. And how could it not? How dare it try to be like Death Ring? The first thing that was wrong was they killed off Busey in the first 20 minutes. This one would have jumped up to 5 stars if we could have seen a totaly insane Busey running around after Ice-T for an hour. It did have some gems though like Ice-T telling the guy who recruited him for ""the game"" that he would run to Alaska for $20. Awesome! But instead the guy has Homeless Ice run on a treadmill for like 5 minutes then gives him the cash. And since he was homeless, with his $20 Ice rented a fleabag motel room and bought a bottle of $3 wine and got messed up in the bathtub. He was probably trying to put himself out of misery by catching Hepatitis in that bathtub, but no such luck. Instead, he was hunted by Roc, Busey and the gang.

He did, however manage to elude that crew for a while. Although, some of his manuvers were totally unrealistic. When you catch this one, notice how the leader of the pack is chasing T up the hill he could have shot him like 30 times, but decides not to. Remember, this is a good thing. And he throws rocks at this sissy and makes him fall to his death. That was cool.

So, while Surviving the Game did not live up to the daddy of movies, Death Ring. It was still enjoyable. Sid would say take a look at it if you've worn out your Death Ring VHS and are in the mood for a little human saffari.",1194825600,,2021,4.203608247422681

600847,4,6303202225,"In Hollywood,it seems to me that directors of films seem to take real life events(example,John F. Kennedy's assasination)or sometimes(and probably usually as well)make movies of events that happen in real life but that never really happened. A good example of the second thing I just mentioned is hunting,and sometimes,directors turn the game of hunting around for movies and make movies where humans instead of animals get hunted. I'm not a big fan of hunting(with this being said,I'm not an animal rights activist either)and I've never watched films like ""The Deer Hunter""-however,I found ""Surviving The Game"" to be nothing earth shattering,but a very good movie. Read on for my review of this:

The movies starts off in Los Angeles with Ice-T portraying Jack Mason,a homeless man who lives out on the streets. His best friend is Hank,an old homeless man,and a dog. Things are going pretty bad for Mason-but pretty bad becomes worse when Hank dies of old age and his dog is run over by a cab. Mason can't take it anymore-and is about to kill himself until he is saved by a church organist named Walter Cole(Charles S. Dutton)who wants to help him,and introduces him to his friend Thomas Burns(Rutger Hauer).After meeting Burns,Mason is offered a job as a hunting guide for Burns,Cole,and their friends out in Colorado in the Rocky Mountains,and Burns tells Mason that if he helps them,he will be given the money he needs to get back on his feet. So,Mason,willing to do anything for a buck,takes the job,and then flys out to Colorado with Mason and Burns and then meets all of the hunters.

But the next morning,Mason discovers a big surprise. The surprise is that Mason is the prey,and the hunters are the people who he was supposed to help. After Mason finds out everything and has gotten dressed,he heads out the door while the hunters enjoy a nice,leisurely breakfast. And once the hunters have finished their breakfast,the hunt begins.

""Surviving The Game"" is one of the most interesting,fast paced films I have ever seen. To quote myself and Motley Crue in a VERY odd and a VERY different way,this film is kind of the ""Same Ol' Situation""-the reason for this is because the same thing(movies where humans instead of animals get hunted)that happens in other movies,and it happens again here. The performances in this film are pretty good. Ice-T did a pretty good job as Mason. He(Ice-T)is not a bad actor,nor is he a great one. Personally,I think the part of Mason should have gone to Denzel Washington instead of Ice-T,but Ice-T pulled it off pretty well. Rutger Hauer did a really good job a Burns,but as far as acting goes,the best performance in this film probably would have to go to William McNamara. In this film,McNamara played Derek Wolfe,Jr.,the son of Wall Street businessman Derek Wolfe,Sr.(not a real life person,a character in this film)who's father was kind of pushing him to do what he was out there to do,except he(Wolfe,Jr.)like Mason,did not know that Mason would be the prey instead of animals,and he was left with a hard decision-should he do what is right or should he satisfy his Dad? The chemistry in this film is really strong,and McNamara is a strong part of the chemistry you will find in this film. Also,director Ernest Dickerson,who directed other films like ""Juice"" and ""Bulletproof""(see my review,it was an action/comedy film that found Adam Sandler portraying a drug dealer,no,I'm not kidding!)so that provides another good and interesting reason for watching this film.

Under the steroid-like direction of Ernest Dickerson, a mostly competent cast elevates this above its actual merit.  The main flaw is the casting of Ice T as the ""hero""; the man tries hard but he is not a good actor and he cannot carry the weight of this movie.  Fortunately, he is surrounded with some expert character actors:  eternal badguy Rutger Hauer shines as the menacing co-founder of the hunting group; Charles D. Dutton chews up the forest in his role as Hauer's partner; John C. McGinley takes acting honors for his psychotic cowboy overwrought with the unsolved murder of his daughter; Academy Award winner F. Murray Abraham brings his dramatic flair to the role of William McNamara's psychotic daddy; Gary Busey is very chilling particularly in the tale of how his father introduced him to manhood.  The movie is paced effectively and there is an ironic twist at the end (see my title for a hint).

But, the morning after they wine and dine him, these perverts awaken him with the news that HE is the hunted, then throw him outside, unarmed, with only a brief head start. The fact that they have SWAT-style weapons, motorbikes and wireless communication is part of their thrill.

Once again we have a movie where some hunters hunt down a human instead of an animal. A bum that lives on the streets named Mason (Ice T) gets approached by a man (Charles S. Dutton) who works at a shelter about a possible job opportunity. The job is being a hunting guide for a group of hunters. The leader of the hunters is Rutger Hauer, who is once again playing the bad guy. Mason is led to believe this is just a job. He is then led to a cabin in the middle of nowhere and everyone sits down to dinner. They drink a bit, converse and you get to meet the characters. Mason soon learns, however, that he is the prey. He wakes up in the morning to Dutton holding a pistol in his face and Hauer explaining what the game is.
The game is that the hunters (Hauer, Dutton, Gary Busey, & F. Murray Abraham, John C. McGinley, & William McNamara) will eat a leasurely breakfast while Mason can run for his life. After breakfast, the hunters will then go hunt their prey.
It's kind of an interesting plotline. I know it's been done over and over in movies, but the characters are what makes this movie fun. Each one has their own personality. Hauer plays the cool bad guy. Dutton plays off him very well and tricks Ice T. Busey plays the insane role better than anyone. McGinley makes a good, big Texan. And Abraham & McNamara play a good psycho-father, good-son combo. The Ice T character is really hurt by the fact that Ice T can't act his way out of a paper sack. He has never been a good actor. He never will be a good actor. And I don't see why all these rappers think they need to be in movies. If they have talent (Ice Cube isn't too bad depending on the role), that's fine. Ice T doesn't have any acting talent.
But, you don't watch this movie to see acting talent. You watch it to be entertained for two hours. The movie definately delivers in that area. It's a testosterone filled ride that most guys should love and will purchase for the low price it is selling at.

600918,3,6303202225,"This movie is worth seeing for Ice T alone. He's brilliant. As an actor, he's not technically skilled...but he definitely gets himself into his role and does a lot more with his natural ability than many actors could do after years and years of training. As a modern day adaptation of ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (which is a truly phenomenal film -- if you watched this one, you should check that earlier film out -- you will be amazed for several reasons), this film shoots itself in the foot by giving the ""game"" away in the opening titles. But it makes up for that by developing the story of the central character played by Ice T and using that character as a more deeply imagined hero. As Mason, a way down and out homeless man, Ice T is very convincing. He seems to have been driven nearly wild even as the film opens...living on the streets surviving like an animal. Willing to stop at little or nothing to stay alive. But then life turns dramatically sour even for Mason and he wants a way out. Ready to kill himself, he is pulled back from the brink and offered a chance to get on his feet. Mason is a fighter and he accepts the offer. Grudgingly...but with the appreciation that this could be his only chance. He is then brought to a wilderness cabin thinking he will act as a hunting guide. The crew of actors who play the hunting group are amazing -- all of them have made careers out of being wonderful sociopaths. And at times, things get a little hammy but director Ernest Dickerson -- making a very interesting choice of projects here -- keeps things from going too far over the top. In no time at all, the hunt is on and Mason realizes what his role is in it. He must survive the challenge using his wits and his will. From that point on, the movie runs at a breakneck pace -- pausing shortly to catch its breath. Toward the end, there is one major continuity goof (night in the wilderness lasts only about 10 minutes and then the sun appears again approaching midday)...but you can ignore it and pay attention to the action. That's what films like this are about afterall. Enjoy the ride and don't examine it too much.",998870400,19,2133,4.402531645569621

Its just one of those movies every time its on TNT or TBS you just have to watch it.  I have recently gotten the DVD there is a lack of extras on it but all in all for the [money] I paid for it, it was totally worth it.",994464000,3,380,3.7125

Five or Six rich men hunt human beings but they meet their match with Ice-T who plays a homeless man.  Their sport is tho hunt live people (I wonder if this is a true story?)  Good movie for a Saturday night!",990921600,3,300,4.303571428571429
600921,4,6303202225,"This movie may not win any awards, but if you want to see a decent action-thriller movie, this is one to consider.  I liked the twist it had and there was some good acting by Rutger Hauer, Gary Busey, and John McGinley.  Depending on your personality, it can be an edge-of-your-seat thriller, or predictable ""bad guys vs. singular good guy"".  But, overall, I liked it. (What does that say of my personality?)",969926400,11,408,4.638888888888889

As adults we understand it's just a movie, however, it's content is disturbing and could make one wonder if this really happens.",1518393600,,268,4.977777777777778

7841212,5,6303202225,"I think this is an extremely underrated movie. I'm not sure why there are several negative reviews. The action is great and there are several awesome one-liners. No, it's not the deepest movie, nor is it very thought-provoking, but it's damn entertaining. I remember seeing this at a movie theater in Mountain View, California with my dad and just loving the hell out of it. I hadn't seen it in about 23 years and seeing it again reminded me why I love every minute of it.  Ice T and the dudes who play the bad guys (one of them is in 'office space', another one of my favorites) are great in this. The Prince Henry Stout scene with Gary Busey alone makes this movie worth seeing....and the bad guys are so evil that I found myself really rooting like hell for Mason to take it to each and every one of them. Watch this move. Hell, buy it. You won't regret it!",1515456000,,860,4.308641975308642
