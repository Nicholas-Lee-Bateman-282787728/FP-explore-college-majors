8108467,1,B000EDST0Q,"I find it interesting that the 5-star reviews are all by ""people"" who have only this book in their list of reviews... Hmmm.

I haven't seen it, but I'm suspicious.",1238198400,,163,4.433333333333334
8108468,5,B000EDST0Q,this dvd is hot!!! all the info and great materials is a must for the persons who want to have great success in seeking the music industry. i cant wait to hear about fruits of all who have taken the knowledge from this creative dvd,1217376000,,231,4.155555555555556
8108469,2,B000EDST0Q,"First, I would like to mention that the overall DVD is not produced professionally. They say that you have to use CDs not CD-Rs to make copies of your album and they use DVD-Rs to make copies of this DVD! The sound is not professionally recorded, I guess they used a couple of HandyCams to produce this DVD with the internal microphone of the Cams. You hear a lot of shhhhhh, and to hide it they played a rap music in the background all the DVD.

I think the DVD is made specially for rap music industry, because I find it hard to apply the tips suggested in the DVD on other types of music like jazz or flamenco.

Still you can learn new things from this DVD, but not much.",1212019200,,674,4.137404580152672
8108470,5,B000EDST0Q,"I work for a major market radio station in the nyc and before even knowing about this dvd I just mentioned to a guy who wanted to submit his demo to a radio station to get airplay. I basically told him the same thing that was mentioned in this dvd. Before buying this dvd, I read some of the comments and wanted to find out for myself. This dvd, although 2 yrs old, has valuable information to anyone wanting to get into the music business, ""regardless of genre"". I'm a producer and jazz musician and this dvd can apply to anyone. Doesn't matter whether you are a country, gospel, r&b, jazz singer/musician/producer....whatever. I would definitely recommend this dvd to anyone interested in being successful in the music business. Especially with the changes in technology, one should take heed to the best road to take when you are trying to ""make it"". There's obviously more to learn than this dvd but if u get involved you will. Watch it as many time as you like and gain as much info you can absorb and stay focused!!!!!!!",1189468800,,1026,4.551351351351351
8108471,5,B000EDST0Q,"This DVD is one of the best items an aspiring artist, musician, producer, singer, song writer and any one else who aspire to make it into the industry can ask for. I have personally been in the music industry for over 10 years starting as an recording artist signed to Sony/Columbia  and have read hundreds of books that basically got me no where closer to my dreams or goal to make it into the industry. I spent years going to open mics and music conferences, networking and getting numbers, just to get no call backs. This goes on everyday to millions of artist such as yourself.

This DVD takes you behind the doors and into the minds of industry A&R's, producers, celebrities, lawyers, and so many more. It guide the viewer step by step on making it into the music industry. 80% of the industry executives interviewed in this 90 minute film has not work in the hip hop field, so the last review is very false. The rules to succeed in the music industry apply to all genres of music.

This film is a must have!!!! Gain the inside edge, know your craft,

and discover ""How to make it in the music industry"".",1160092800,,1109,4.421568627450981
8108472,2,B000EDST0Q,"We are a musical family who has been exploring how to enter the music business for several years already and were looking forward to what this DVD would teach us.  Though the processes of getting into the business are sure to be similiar, it seemed to be geared toward the hip hop industry -- which doesn't apply to us. The DVD bascially was a compilation  of people's opinions.  Granted, there were some nuggets of good information but mostly we found it boring and fast forwarded at times just to make it to the end.  Overall, this wasn't a useful tool for us.",1155340800,2,562,4.480392156862745
8108473,5,B000EDST0Q,"You hear celebrities talk about how it took years to become an ""over-night success."" But what you never hear talked about are blow by blow accounts of what it really took to get them to the kind of career they're enjoying now. It's always shrouded by a certain degree of secrecy which never gives a music hopeful a clue as to where to begin the journey.

This is what is unique about this DVD. It's the first time  significant players in the music industry have come together to give a dedicated newcomer a handbook on what it takes and how to maneuver through the system to get from having a great sound to bringing your sound to the public. Steps to Stardom Vol. I belongs in the library of every musician, vocalist or otherwise.",1144022400,,731,4.447761194029851
8108474,5,B000EDST0Q,"This awe inpiring documentary uses the backdrop of the music industry to teach anyone and everyone how perseverance, commitment, and TRUE LOVE for the craft of their choice can lead to the realization of one's dreams. Industry professionals  provide honest and elaborate explanations and detailed descriptions of the ""behind the scenes"" of the music industry. On a universal scale, this film teaches us to KNOW the ""ins and outs"" of whatever craft we may be exploring. Its encouraging lessons of KNOW YOURSELF, DON'T BE AFRAID and DO THE WORK transcend into any and all art forms.",1138924800,3,580,5.041666666666667
8108475,5,B000EDST0Q,"In a business that can be as cruel as a den of lions it is inspiring to see a production that takes it time to delve into the many struggles an up and coming artist can and will encounter in the evolution of his/her career. What makes ""Steps to Stardom Vol I"" stand out is it's willingness to show the errors an artist can avoid and within the same token offer a positive outlook towards success with astonishingly honest tips and methods used by artists, producers and A&R's already established in the music industry.  This is definitely a DVD to be owned, especially anyone seeking great advice on How to Make It in the Music Industry.",1138924800,2,637,4.491379310344827
