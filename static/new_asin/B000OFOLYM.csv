8325543,5,B000OFOLYM,"From the stunt horses in Hollywood to the inventive saddle maker, it is clear that the underlying resonance lies in each person's devoted love to their horses. This film is very beautiful, showing varied aspects and topics that relate to man's connections with the horse, and his/her desire to be a partner, to give back to the horse so much of what the horse is willing and able to give to us. The interview with Redwings Sanctuary, in particular, was quite informative and poignant and something that I can now refer my clients to in order to gain understanding of the rescue industry and especially the PMU rescue horses.
Beautifully filmed and incredibly informative....I cannot wait for the next series!!!",1279152000,2,710,4.925
8325544,4,B000OFOLYM,"This DVD provided four interesting topics related to our beloved horse. I only wish it was a longer DVD and covered more interesting horse issues.

Rudy Ugland, horse trainer for the film industry demonstrated with two of his specially trained horses (Ajax & Woody) how he gets them to do special ""tricks"" on command like rearing and falling.

Redwings Horse Rescue, organized by caring horsewomen reviewed several horses & donkeys  that were rescued from distressed situations.  Many of them were rescued from the slaughter house!  Redwings showed examples of how with care and compassion, they  enabled these horses to have a better life and bring them back to health.  I was truly surprised about  Premarin where groups of draft foals were being sent to the slaughter house simply because they needed only the pregnant mare's urine to produce a medication for hot flashes.  The foals were only an unessential by-product!

Michele MacFarlane showed her beautiful, flashy American Saddlebred pintos.  Wonderful, stylish horses to watch in motion!  Love their high-stepping gait!

John Bozanich showed the foundation work of his patented flexible tree saddles and how his saddles enable it to work with the horse's dynamic movements.  His design provides a more comfortable & balanced saddle both for the horse and the rider.",1260057600,4,1325,5.218009478672986
8325545,5,B000OFOLYM,"This first episode profiles several successful and reknowned horse experts and examines their relationship with horses. While these individuals  come from from widely different horse activities and backgrounds, they all share in common an  immense respect for horses and an appreciation for the equine contribution to mankind throughout history.  They were selected because they have made a difference in the well-being and/or performance of horses across the country today, and this makes them stand above the large pack of indistinguishable""horse experts"" out on the horse lecture circuit today.  My overall takeaway from this episode, which was enhanced by the beautiful filming of horses in action, was how much more we can accomplish with our horses if we take the time to explore the nature of our underlying bond with them.

I look forward to the next episode.",1202428800,15,867,5.299270072992701
