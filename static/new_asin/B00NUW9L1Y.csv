8680364,5,B00NUW9L1Y,Grew up with Mr. C and I met him years ago. I still love his old shows. I never missed them as a kid.,1491523200,3,101,3.25
8680365,2,B00NUW9L1Y,This was in black and white and probably one of his first shows so it was not very good.  I returned it.,1482451200,2,104,3.727272727272727
8680366,4,B00NUW9L1Y,old but good,1476403200,2,12,3.3333333333333335
8680367,4,B00NUW9L1Y,"This video shows you Perry Como at his best. He is always very relaxed and charming with a good sense of humor throughout.
His voice is very good from the beginning to the end and the songs he sings vary nicely from ballads to swinging tunes.
Very enjoyable and a trip down memory lane.",1454112000,2,286,4.314814814814815
8680368,3,B00NUW9L1Y,"It's good to see some of Perry's television work come out on DVD, but the quality of the transfer here is only ""fair"", both in terms of video and audio.  You can still enjoy the programs, but this is of lower quality than, for example, older Red Skelton programs that were recently released.

In terms of content, the first show on the disc is an hour long Como show from January 17, 1959.  Perry's guests were Nat King Cole, the McGuire Sisters, and Dick VanDyke.  Perry sings ""St. Louis Blues"", ""Breezing Along with the Breeze"" and ""Prisoner of Love"".  A medley of hits involves all three singers.

The second show is one of the short ""Chesterfield Supper Club"" shows.

The third show is another of the short ""Chesterfield Supper Club"" shows, and includes Perry singing ""Sway"", ""Someone To Watch Over Me"", ""Papa Loves Mambo""  Peggy Lee is the guest.

The fourth program is the ""All Star Revue"".  This episode is hosted by Danny Thomas, and has the best audio and visual component on the disc.  Ironically, this show has nothing to do with Perry Como, although there is an interesting cameo by Eddie Cantor!",1425427200,8,1108,4.65979381443299
8680369,5,B00NUW9L1Y,SUPERB!!!  Hopefully there will be more of Perry's excellent archive shows forth coming in the future.,1418083200,7,102,5.375
