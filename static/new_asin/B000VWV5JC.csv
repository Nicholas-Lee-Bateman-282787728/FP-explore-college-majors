8220381,1,B000VWV5JC,"I purchased this DVD thinking it would be about formulating chords. It is simply a compilation of clips featuring someone playing chord after chord. There is no instruction whatsoever. You can get the same thing from a chord chart. Although Mel Bay products generally are good, I don't recommend this one.",1332979200,,305,5.0
