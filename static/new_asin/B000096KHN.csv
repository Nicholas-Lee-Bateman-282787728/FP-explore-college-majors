7989977,3,B000096KHN,"It from the era when Wonder Woman gave up her powers and lived as a mortal. The production values are very low(this being 1970's television),but the story is engaging and the plotting well done for the era.

Wonder Woman is presented as in a very 1970's way that unlike early Lynda Carter episodes does not hit you over the head constantly with feminist platitudes but instead portrays women as compassionate yet capable. Gone here is the classic bustier,replaced with a blue zip-front tunic over red leggings,and a large gold belt with built-in grappling hook (bracelets do something too but cannot remeber what).

Ricardo Montalban is the villan here,another amazon is helping him.

This is far better than 65% of Lynda Carter series(which tended towards insipid pap),but is very different from the Wonder Woman most are familiar with. Keep an open mind and you may enjoy this!",1155513600,2,879,5.006849315068493
