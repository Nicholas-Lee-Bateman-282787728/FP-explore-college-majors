2119600,3,B0002TRUJI,"While not outstanding episodes, both these stories are very entertaining. I'm not sure, but believe at least some of the shots in the first were taken on board the Queen Mary which is permanently docked in Long Beach, CA. It's always good to see Leslie Nielsen and I kept waiting for him to do something funny but the role was strictly serious. Instead, Jo Anne Worley (Laugh-In) and Vicki Lawrence (Carol Burnett Show) were the silly ones. The second story teamed Jessica once again with Harry McGraw played by the wonderful Jerry Orbach.",1154822400,,539,4.806451612903226

2119607,4,B0002TRUJI,"I remember watching the show with my grandmother years ago, but it's quite amazing that I'm loving it even more now. MURDER, SHE WROTE showcased the talents of Angela Lansbury as retired schoolteacher and acclaimed mystery novelist, Jessica ""J.B."" Fletcher. Jessica's inspiration for her books comes in the various murders and intrigues that constantly come her way, even in her sleepy hometown of Cabot Cove, Maine. Recurring characters include Sheriff Amos Tupper (Tom Bosley), local fisherman Ethan (Claude Akins); and Jessica's nephew Grady (Michael Horton).

MURDER, SHE WROTE ran for twelve seasons (plus several additional TV movies); and attracted a veritible galaxy of guest stars, drawn from the stage and screen. There's no gratuitous sex or violence on display; bad language is kept to a minimum...yep, these were the days, alright! Perfect entertainment for those lazy weekend afternoons.

Episodes:

""Footnote to Murder"" - The literary world is abuzz when an author is killed during a New York writer awards convention. Guest stars Kenneth Mars, Morgan Brittany, Vincent Baggetta, Robert Reed, Pat Harrington Jr., Talia Balsam and Diana Muldaur.

2119610,4,B0002TRUJI,"The first episode on this tape is an average, enjoyable Jessica Fletcher story. But the second one is a treat! It's one of the few episodes that features the town of Cabot Cove, Maine, with quite a bit of outdoor scenery for a change. If I recall correctly, a California town is the actual filming site, but it works! Additionally, there's a rather sad and unexpected twist to the ending making this one of Jessica's best mysteries.",1154822400,2,432,4.623376623376624

8031678,5,B0002TRUJI,"Murder, She Wrote: Jessica Behind Bars is a fine 1985 episode starring Yvonne De Carlo. Yvonne has some real nasty dialogue, and boy does she deliver it.

This episode  is titled Jessica Behind Bars, and the plot puts her in a women's prison. Fans of Yvonne De Carlo will like this the most.",1435017600,,504,4.662921348314606

8031681,5,B0002TRUJI,"I absolutely adore Jessica Fletcher, English teacher turned mystery writer/ sleuth. I have watched all of the seasons of Murder, She Wrote and am still amazed at how wonderfully this character was portrayed by the great Angela Lansbury. I was a teenager when this show first aired, and remember dreaming of moving to a place like Cabot Cove (and sometimes still do!).

Anyway, I was saddened when this stellar show came to an end after many successful seasons. Then I discovered there were four made-for-TV movies made after the show ended. I managed to catch some of these shows on TV when they were aired, and only lately came to discover that they are available on DVD.

These are four full-length movies. In South by Southwest, Jessica gets entangled in espionage while traveling to El Paso by train. In A Story to Die For, Jessica attends a speakers' conference where a former director of the KGB is murdered. The prized manuscript which supposedly contains some classified information is missing. Jessica initially tries to stay out of it, but inevitably finds herself embroiled in the case. A Story to Die For is my favorite in this collection because it is the most philosophical of all four movies, dealing with friendship, trust, loyalty, and is also quite emotional.

In The Last Free Man, Jessica travels to a university in Virginia and inevitably becomes involved in a case that takes her back to the past, and where she discovers that one of her relatives back during the time of slavery was a progressive Southerner and an excellent sleuth herself (Lansbury plays a dual role here). The Celtic Riddle is set in Ireland and is another riveting mystery. Jessica has to deal with a killer who is determined not to let anyone get a fortune, one where Jessica herself is a beneficiary. Besides the riveting plot, the bonus is the beautiful cinematography.

Ardent fans of Murder, She Wrote should definitely watch these four movies, and those who are familiar with the show will enjoy identifying guest stars from TV's golden years. I highly recommend this 4-movie compilation for fans of the show, and just about anyone who enjoys a good mystery.",1397520000,,2157,4.869209809264305

8031683,4,B0002TRUJI,"Murder, She Wrote 4 Movie Collection, 2012 film

The ""Murder, She Wrote"" TV series was on broadcast TV from 1984 to 1996, a very long run for a series. It benefitted from its original time slot (8 pm Sunday) with stories designed for a wide audience appreciation (dramatic murder mysteries that were not frightening). I used to watch it the first couple of years (it followed an investigative news show), but then a change in the producer or stories led to a lower quality. ""Jessica Fletcher"" was a murder mystery writer who also assisted the local Sheriff of ""Cabot Cove"", a small New England rural town. This was different from the classic Private Investigators who dealt with a grittier environment (Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe, Mike Hammer, etc.).  Was the name ""fletcher"" chosen to recall ""archer""?

These movies were made after the series ended. I found them of varying quality. The cast always has a lot of extras, a cost avoided in many TV shows. The fans of Jessica may not care about the story as long as Jessica can demonstrate luck and serendipity in solving the murders that break out when she is in the vicinity. (Would you want her as a guest in your home?) One interesting thing about her character is the lack of a partner to comment on or question the events. But this may be needed for novels rather than movies. Jessica also seems to be more passive than a Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Poirot (little involvement in background investigations). But this series' success is proof of its formula.

""South by Southwest"" is the best because of its heritage. The story echoes many famous movies. Parts reminded me of ""Foreign Correspondent"", ""North by Northwest"", ""The Lady Vanishes"", ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", ""The Thirty-Nine Steps"" (the train station ""Hannay""). The ending echoes ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"". Jessica's involvement in intrigue as she goes about her business was the start of many Eric Ambler's novels. It begins when Jessica meets a ""Stranger on a Train"". The valuable item sought is a memory chip to encrypt (or decrypt) data for US satellites. A lot happens before the chip is recovered. Note the product placement.

""A Story to Die For"" occurs when Jessica works as a Motivational Speaker (people pay money to hear famous people make a speech). One of the speakers is a former KGB official who wrote a book. Another is a double for a popular radio talk show host (with a substance abuse problem). There is another novelist ""Warren Pierce"". One of these is found shot dead, the solution requires finding the motive among people who never met before. Jessica does it.

""The Last Free Man"" takes place in 1860 Virginia. Men talk about the possibility of war. A newly married man is shot dead at night! Sarah (Jessica's ancestor) investigates. And so does Jessica in modern times. The murderer is discovered, but politics creates a cover-up. Jessica learns the secret about a man who seems to have been buried in two different graves! A man will revise history because of this new evidence. [Note how this skates over controversial subjects.]

""The Celtic Riddle"" was adapted from a novel and is set in Ireland. A man is seen on videotape, his will divided his property in an unusual way. Each heir is given a clue to find a valuable treasure. Only by working together will they be able to locate this hidden treasure. The story involves family secrets. The solution requires solving a riddle from these many clues. [Would this happen outside of a novel?] It is needlessly complex, and requires translating English to Gaelic (only a young woman can do this). The motive arose from family history known to only a few. Everyone wants more than what they have, a classic formula for murder. [Ever read ""The List of Adrian Messenger""?]",1374537600,,3764,4.799382716049383
