5351574,2,B009MO5E10,"Premium Rush is a tonally-confused, poorly-written summer spectacle that will leave most mature audience members wanting more. Thirteen year old boys, on the other hand, should have no trouble getting amped up over the action...but maybe they shouldn't. The film presents negative racial and gender stereotypes in strikingly non-chalant fashion. More on that in a moment. First you ought to know that the plot is cardboard thin: a one-dimensional tough-guy bicycle delivery rider (played by a sleepwalking (or riding) Joseph Gordon Levitt) is targeted by a lowlife cop (the type-casted psychotic Michael Shannon) because he picks up a package worth quite a bit of money. Cue the chase scenes, which are admittedly pretty entertaining with convincing CGI for the most part.
The problem is the script which is peppered with an ungodly amount of flashbacks, super expository narration, a frame narrative that loops back on itself with twenty minutes left in the movie, and character so paper-thin that you will never remember them when the credits roll. Take Willie, our ostensible hero, his one and only defining characteristic is that he likes to ride his bike with no brakes! Woah, so symbolic. Spare me. Oh yeah and Teenage Wasteland plays as a book-end device.... how clever! It is also worth noting that the film is incredibly sexist and racist, as well. Though it includes a number of female and ethnically diverse characters, these folks are given very little to do. The black guy, for example, is presently as a cartoonish villain with no real redeeming qualities other than his muscles. And the Asian character is given nothing to do but mourn for a family member and get choked by another character in a ruthless intimidation scene that seems entirely out of place in an otherwise jaunty summer flick. Why even put that scene in there, one wonders, other than to feed helpless female stereotypes. Ultimately, Premium Rush is like riding an aesthetically pleasing bike with a chronically flat tire-- no matter how hard you hit the turns, you'll still be left wishing for a much more finely-tuned experience.",1345939200,,2114,5.077586206896552

5351576,4,B009MO5E10,"Mid to late August has perennially been a weak time for new theatrical releases. When I was growing up, it was always the dumping grounds for expected hits that studios shuffled away in full acknowledgment that they weren't the films they were supposed to be (hello, ""Superman IV: The Quest For Peace""). These days, some minor hits have popped up in the waning days of August, and this year has produced another sleeper: screenwriter David Koepp's exciting PREMIUM RUSH.

A tidy, edge-of-your-seat thriller that recalls Kevin Bacon's `80s misfire ""Quicksilver"" in premise only, ""Premium Rush"" likewise follows a NYC bike messenger - here superbly portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt - who's been charged with delivering a parcel to Chinatown...one that NYPD cop Michael Shannon is highly interested in. Trying to stay one step ahead of his pursuer, Gordon-Levitt darts in and out of midtown traffic, trying to figure out what he's carrying and help out a college acquaintance - a young Chinese woman - whose life seems to be riding on the outcome of his delivery.

I've long criticized some of Koepp's scripts for high profile summer movies (particularly his efforts for Steven Spielberg, including the underwhelming ""War of the Worlds"" and""The Lost World: Jurassic Park""), but ""Premium Rush"" - written with John Kamps - ranks as one of his tightest, and most satisfying, screenplays, managing to mix a fast-moving action film with a twisty, compelling story that packs more of an emotional punch than anticipated. The authentic locations add immeasurably to the film's many scenes of Gordon-Levitt and his fellow bikers being an inch or two away from certain disaster, maneuvering through a maze-like succession of traffic, pedestrians and lousy Big Apple drivers; Koepp the director, meanwhile, deftly mixes in flashbacks to tell a story that works just perfectly in the short, 90-minute time frame employed here.

""Premium Rush"" didn't make much noise in theaters this past weekend, and seemed to fly under the radar completely in terms of most viewers' pre-release awareness (I hadn't even heard of the film until it opened Friday). That's unfortunate, because it's the complete opposite of the bloated, overlong $200 million typical blockbuster most studios are interested in these days. If you're looking for a short but sweet, fresh Hollywood movie, ""Premium Rush"" puts a splendid cap on the (surprisingly good) summer movie season of 2012.",1345852800,,2445,5.232142857142857
5351577,4,B009MO5E10,"""Premium Rush"" mixes elements of movies like ""Vantage Point,"" ""Breaking Away"" and ""Fast and Furious.""  If this combination appeals to you, then by all means race to the theater or buy this movie now.  There is not a moment wasted in this taut thriller as it starts at 6:30 P.M., jumps back to 4:30, brings us to 5:45, then jumps to a different character earlier at 1:30 that afternoon.  All of these pieces come together to help explain what happened at the critical 6:30 juncture of the movie, which then propels us to the ending.

All the actors are fine, but the real star is the cinematographer who takes us whizzing through crowded NYC streets on the heels and wheels of the bike messengers that are at the heart of the movie. Do we need to believe that Joseph Gordon-Levit is really riding the bike in long scenes?  Of course not!  Did we really believe Christopher Reeve was flying?  No.  Do we really think Sylvester Stallone was getting punched in Rocky 3?  No.  Do we really think Sharon Stone wasn't wearing....Yeah, we do.

Anyway, this is a fun movie, and doesn't pretend to be anything pretentious.  Let yourself enjoy this ride.",1345766400,,1143,4.6318407960199

5351586,5,B009MO5E10,"I finally got around to watching Premium Rush, and glad I did. I was trying to watch Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, which is also a great film... but too slow-paced for me to adjust to. Basically, my mind (and sometimes my body) run at about the speed of this film, which, to be precise, is up to 50 mph on a bike on the (always jammed) streets of New York City. (OK, I do up to 60 kph on my two wheels.) I last stayed in the Lincoln Square neighbourhood, which I recognized during the Central Park sequence. As usual, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is flawless, and his supporting cast were fully up to the task. Not only is Premium Rush easy to watch, it's a glorious accomplishment for athletics and film combined. If you haven't seen it yet, and if your mentality is as fast-paced as mine, this could be the film for you.......

5351605,3,B009MO5E10,"I'll be completely honest on this. I liked the story of a guy who gets trapped in the middle of something illegal when he is assigned the task to deliver a package to someone who goes by the name of Sister Chen. The backstory of the Chinese woman who was trying to somehow bring her son over to New York from China was interesting. Willie's love interest decides to help him with his quest of dodging the police officer who is chasing him in order to deliver the envelope he was given to Sister Chen by 7:00 pm the same day. However, for me, the editing decisions made to blend in the flashback scenes with the current day happening scenes were confusing at first, but somehow, I was eventually able to figure out that these were flashback scenes. These continuity errors do hinder the viewing experience, and I am not sure if this is the actual director's cut, but this film needs to be re-edited to solve the continuity errors that are prevalent. Other than this, the stunt scenes with bicycle manoeuvre scenes amalgamated with Willie's character was definitely something to be interested in.",1480377600,3,1094,4.644329896907217

5351640,5,B009MO5E10,"I haven't had this kind of feeling for a long time. I had a huge doubt before watching this film. What can a bike messanger film can deliver?
 A little fun perhaps? Well, I was totally wrong.
[...]
 It gave me a huge joy. I laughted the whole time not because it was funny but it was so fun to watch.
 Joseph Gordon Rivett and Michael Shannon were so fun to look at through the whole time.
 But most of all, the special effect that made this chase scenes make real was the real deal.
 When Joseph was going to the opposie lane to get rid of Michael, when he was crashed with cars, I was like not able to see straight.
 The cars are dashing so fast and almost about to crash into Joseph's bike or really crashed from time to time.
 He just wanted to deliver the small envelop to save this Chinese woman's child's life. (Which is acually a bit corney but was ok)
 The navigation Effect showing the whole city from the above was also fun to watch as you will see.
 This movie again shows how important the script is.
 It is so small and simple but very delicate and detailed it was. They won with the idea not the budget or big time actors.
 Some will of course complain the fact that they used the poor Chinsese involement and all but that's just a small part of the story and which movie didn't?
 Lethal Weappon 4 and so many other movied did. So let's just forgive them about that.
 The cat chase mouse thing was totally fun to watch the whole time.
 Especially knowing the fact that Michael Shannon is a dirty cop who is really desperate to earn money since he is gamble eddict and lost all the money and has a lot and lot of debt and about to die for that. He is chasing for something which is in Joseph's pocket.
 But Joseph has to deliver it for not only for money but for this Chinese girl.
 He think that this delivery can save this girl's daughter. Now it depends on his single delivery.
 He is a very 'earnest' man.
 The endless chase starts and that will drive you crazy.
 Are you ready for this?
 David Koepp is an amazing writer and wrote many great scripts before such as MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, JURRASIC PARK, SIDERMAN, WAR OF THE WORLDS. He made hidden masterpiece STIR OF ECHO and now this film.
 Don't miss this one.

Other than that though, this really is an example of a missed opportunity. Despite trying some creative plot techniques, the story loses its way mid-way through and there is not nearly enough character development to make any of them particularly believable.

5351644,1,B009MO5E10,"Comes across like a really bad remake of 80s movie QuickSilver gimmicked up to try to hold interest. QS was a drama with one lightherated sequence, had a plot that made sense and included good reasons for the characters being/doing what they were/did  --and not on so extremely predictable you;re bored out of your mind, characters you cared about with back stories (even the barely mentioned ones were interesting), a nice bike trick sequence, lots of fast action riding scenes, believable good and bad guys, an ending that finished up loose ends and meant something.  Premium is confused about whether its supposed to be a decent drama, a dumb comedy, or sheer boring idiocy coupled with enough fast but boringly numerous utterly predictable bike rides and cutesy gimmicking by way of overly graphic simulations of someone using situational awareness to find the clear path of travel and so many multiple flash forward/backs it's supposed to be a challenge to keep track but merely becomes eyerollingly overdone and silly. Characters are so 1D they practically do not exist.  The bad guy is ludicrously silly most of the time, and the good guy is frankly a loser who learns nothing.  There is one bike trick sequence, predictably entirely by the main character.

The movie plays as if someone saw QS years ago and the main parts of it, removed anything in the way of character development or plot development, stuck everything else in a bag, shook it up and removed it randomly, then wrote a screenplay incorporating the elements in a different order of first appearance than the one used in QS and finally added many more bike speed scenes and a couple of gimmicks to try to keep people's interest in the too-thin-for-this-length-movie story.  If you like bike actions scenes and don't care about the rest, you may like it.  If you;re looking for a good story, go find a copy of QuickSilver and enjoy.",1472428800,,1904,4.8580246913580245

5351688,2,B009MO5E10,"First I'll start out by saying that this movie is a lot like a little kid's birthday cake: 10 percent cake and 90 percent icing.  In other words, it's a lot of smash and grab and very little story at all.  Now, before I go to ripping this film to shreds (this is something that as an aspiring filmmaker and published author I can get carried away doing) I'll list a few things that the movie did right.  The cinema-photography in this cyclist action flick is something to be marveled at, what with the incredible moving shots they get of the actors moving on bicycles through heavy traffic in New York as well as the amazing stunts done on the bicycles (props to the stuntmen).  The movie used a very interesting manner of organizing the story, starting in the middle, skipping to the beginning, skipping further back and then going ahead.  This allowed me, the viewer, to get an idea of each character in-depth and it was interesting to see how all their stories, Wiley, Sargent Monday, and Nima, interconnected.  Also, the Sherlock Holmes-style that Wiley used to survey his split-second options while on the road was very interesting and truly encapsulated the decision-making process a New York cyclist carrier has to go through.  What I'm trying to say is that the movie had a lot of potential to be pretty good, but unfortunately, these few neat party tricks weren't enough to save it.  Now, I'm gonna move onto the slashing.  I'll warn you right now that this will have spoilers so if you just really have your heart set on seeing this movie, you might as well click away now.  For you who don't care, I'll just say that the story line is pretty predictable.  Let's start at the top with a confession from yours truly.  The only reason I really had any interest in watching Premium Rush was that I'm a high school theatre and movie fanatic who really likes Aaron Tviet (For you who don't know who that is, he was the curly headed dude from Les Miserables.  If you don't know what Les Miserables is, don't even bother reading this review and go watch it, because it's an actually GOOD movie) and I figured if he was in this movie, it might be worth watching.  If you reader are watching this movie for similar reasons, I'm just gonna break your heart right now by telling you he is in the movie for literally 17 seconds (yes, I counted) at the beginning of the movie and never appears again, but while that did disappoint me, that wasn't enough to turn me off to the movie quite entirely.  After all, I like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and General Zod as a dirty cop seemed a pretty promising bad guy. (Seriously though, couldn't have given Aaron Tviet one more scene? I mean he's listed on IMDB before one of the main characters.  What's up with that?)  Sorry,I'm getting ahead of myself, let me address the story.  It opens up on New York City, with Wiley (Levitt) a New York carrier who likes to take chances and get into trouble.  It's made pretty clear that he originally wanted to do law or something but was too much of an adrenaline junkie to sit behind a desk.  This is a subplot of the movie never truly delved into or explained and it is one of many.  We find out that his love for danger has put him on his fellow carrier and girlfriend, Vanessa's (played by Dania Ramirez) bad side since he missed her college graduation or something for a bicycle race.  This is another issue that is never again addressed in the film and leaves a gaping plothole, like why is Vanessa still working as a carrier when she has a college degree and could be doing bigger and better things?  There appears to be an attempted love triangle ad maybe even history between Vanessa, Wiley, and another carrier Manny, but that also is  never explained.  Anyway moving on, apparently Vanessa has a Chinese roommate, Nima (Why?  You guessed it.  Not explained) and she gives a very important envelope to Wiley (this was right after Aaron Tviet's 17 seconds of fame) that she has to be delivered by 7:00 pm that day.  Clearly it's more than what it seems and we find this out for sure when Wiley is suddenly stopped by New York police officer, Sargent Monday (Micheal Shannon) who demands him to hand over the envelope.  Naturally Wiley refuses, so rather than playing it cool like a regular bad guy would through the use of bribery or clever deception, Monday immediately threatens Wiley's life and so follows a 15 minute or so bicycle and car chase.  Okay, so that's a little overkill,  but maybe it'll get better.  Did I mention the random phone calls between Wiley and Vanessa during all this regarding their maybe failed relationship.  Maybe not.  We don't know!  Sorry, getting off track again.  Fast forward, or should I say rewind, a few minutes, we find out that apparently Monday owes a lot of money to a Chinese crime syndicate.  Finally, backstory!  We're finally gonna get into the meat of the story right? Wrong. The flashback is extremely confusing and vague and within two minutes we go from Monday losing a game of Chinese poker to him killing a guy in the street with a lot of incomprehensible cursing and yelling and mumbling in between.  Long story short.  He needs money, and the ticket that Nima gave Wiley is worth a lot so he's gonna steal it.  So follows more cycling and chasing and cursing, etc., etc..  Wiley decides to send the ticket back to Nima so he doesn't have to deal with it.  Skip to in between flashback of Nima kicking Vanessa (She's her roommate for some reason remember?) out of their apartment and going across to a shady salon to purchase a ticket for thousands of dollars that she has to get to some lady called Sister Chen.  This scene is another confusing one because due to the odd choice of close ups, it makes us feel like there's something more to the people Nima's making a deal with.  I'll just tell you up front, there's not. Anyway, Monday finds out, chases her, threatens her and BOOM! We're right back where we started a half hour ago with Monday threatening Wiley.  Skip back to the present and Nima's ticket is picked up by another carrier after Wiley drops it off, making Nima cry right in front of him.  She then reveals that the ticket is for the Chinese underworld to smuggle her son over to the U.S..  WHAT?  WHO COULD HAVE SEEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT COMING?  Yes, the smuggling of an illegitimate kid is cliche, but at this point I was thinking, ""Okay, finally a little bit of emotional drive that has otherwise been lacking in this Micheal-Bay-flick-wanna-be"". I thought this just in time for my hopes to be dashed in yet another 15 - 20 minute bicycle chase between Wiley and Manny, who now has the ticket and is delivering it to Monday to managed to change the delivery address so he can get it.  This scene goes on WAY too long.  Sure, this is an action movie so there's gonna be a good bit of blood, sweat, and tears, but watching shot switches of Wiley and Manny just pedaling and panting and cursing and yelling, even calling each other while their riding multiple times trying to get the ticket handed over, gets old pretty quick.  Like, the career of Macaulay Culkin quick.  Seeing Manny get tackled by a police officer cyclist (by the way, he's been chasing Wiley since the beginning of the movie and is a failed attempt and comic relief) was a wonderful sight.  Now Wiley has the ticket and all is well, but low and behold, guess who shows up?  Monday, and we're back in another drawn out chase scene, only now, Vanessa is there too.  Wiley gets hit by a taxi *oh no*!  Sudden flashback to him making out with Vanessa in a bar talking about luck and Bhudda followed by another maybe insinuation that Manny and Vanessa have history together.  Who knows?  Suddenly we're back in a hospital truck where Monday tortures wounded Wiley (side note: props to Joseph Gordon-Levitt to still doing a great performance while having to listen to Micheal Shannon's horrible dialogue about how the phrase ""Suck it"" and ""Douche-bag"" are impolite and childish) until he agrees to hand over the ticket.  We get to a bicycle barn where Wiley lies about the ticket's location (who would've imagined that?) and steals back the ticket with the help of Vanessa and guess what happens next?  You guessed it.  Another 20 minutes of bicycle stunts as they escape...again.  This entire movie is a gigantic time loop, but we'll save that for the end, I'm almost done.  Wiley takes the ticket to Chinatown where he is again threatened by Monday (I guess police officers don't have much else to do in New York) and it looks like the jig is up for our hero, but lucky for him, who comes to save the day?  The cyclist carrier cavalry?  So...you're telling me there's a huge coalition in New York among the carriers to immediately come save the butt of one cyclist just because the word is given by one guy or gal?  Not to mention, where were these carriers two hours ago when Wiley first nearly got killed?  And why is Manny there?  Just five seconds ago he hated Wiley's guts and now he's going out of his way to help him?  This part made the least sense, honestly.  Nonetheless, Wiley's busted  butt is saved somehow, even though Monday has a gun and still could have fired a few rounds and had this whole thing done with, and he gets the ticket to Sister Chen who makes preparations to bring Nima's son to America as well as her...mom I guess?  Again not much is explained.  Monday's Chinese gangster friends suddenly show up and shoot him in the head, an injury that killed him surprisingly slowly.  His response to being shot reminded me of Olaf from Frozen, ""Oh look at that, I've been impaled..."" (or shot I suppose).  This was super disappointing, but then again, Monday was a pretty disappointing villain.  He wasn't clever like someone like Khan, he wasn't scary like Hannibal Lector, he was just overly angry, and frankly not that bright, so I suppose his end was fitting.  Anyway, Wiley gets Vanessa, they kiss a little bit more.  The movie ends with Wiley riding his bicycle.  All is well in the world.  Oh, expect for the car that runs into the taxi behind him as he riding, a sight that he looks on with an ""Oh, shucks"" kind of look on his face.  Was that supposed to funny?  Because it just came off as deeply disturbing.  Credits roll.  The end.  Overall, I think the movie was extremely ambitious and I think if maybe the writers had worked a little bit harder at developing the characters and their interconnecting story lines, this movie could have been very good. (Also, they could've given Tviet a little more screen time, but again that's just me.)  I always applaud writers for trying out a new story rather than just making a sequel or a knock-off, but this unfortunately there wasn't much story at all, and rather relied on used up, cookie-cutter plot lines to put together a action flick that left nothing to be envied.  Alright, off my soap box.  All I'll say is this.  If you're in the mood for a movie that's just for background noise and not so much thinking, this is the movie for you.  This is the kind of movie you watch when you're stuck at a relative's house and you really just don't want to talk to your crazy aunt and you don't have internet or cell service and Premium Rush is the only DVD your 13-year-old cousin owns.

Action packed with tons of bike stunts and uniquely animated ""crash"" scenes intermixed with genuine crashes and a captivating story line, Premium Rush blows the dust off Kevin Bacon's Quicksilver! Its segmented time sequence might be hard for those who dislike ""flashbacks"" to enjoy, but each segment ties into one another with fluidity that makes the movie uniquely individual and easy to keep up with. The characters, unlike most movies, do not share the same level of fluidity, instead coarsely interacting with each other in a way that's shockingly realistic. Movies that can capture a human quality are always enjoyable, but Premium Rush goes beyond that with character interactions that are decidedly real world.

 This is the hippest film of the year of all the ones that I have seen.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt is rapidly becoming my favorite star.  This is a very cool, very well done chase film.  Gordon-Levitt plays an unlikely character, a recent law school grad who doesnt take the bar exam.  Instead, he gets a job running other peoples packages and messages around the jam packed streets of New York City.  Not entirely crazy.  A good friend of mine got his law degree and instead of taking the bar exam he went to Alaska and became a cook.  But Gordon-Levitt in this one likes the speed and danger of riding around the big apple as fast as he possibly can.
 In New York coyotes are called snake heads, at least in the Chinese illegal immigrant community.  The package the Gordon-Levitt caries is a receipt for $50,000, the savings of a desperate Chinese woman who wants to slip her young son into America.  A dirty cop who loses money in some incomprehensible Chinese gambling game needs the 50 large as well and is perfectly willing to kill the messenger to get the scratch.  It all happens quickly because a ship is about to leave China and the money must be in the hands of the snake head absolutely, positively by 7pm.
 Gordon-Levitt has made some extraordinary films, from Angles in the Outfield in 1994 to the wonderful independent films Brick (a must see film noir crime flick set in a contemporary California high school) and 500 Days of Summer to his more recent big budget Hollywood block busters Inception, G.I. Joe: the Rise of the Cobra and this years The Dark Knight Rises.  He is an outstanding actor.
 His co-star is Dominican born Dania Ramirez, a 33 year old Latin beauty who appeared on the popular TV show Heroes.  She also had roles in X-Men: the Last Stand and the exciting Zombie flick Quarantine.  She is very fit as another bicycle messenger.
 Director David Koepp does an adequate job in this his fifth outing as a director.  This is essentially a long chase movie, but Koepp does put in the things that make it fun, including several episodes with a bicycle riding policeman.  But it is Koepps efforts as a writer that he will be remembered for.  He has penned such major action hits as War of the Worlds, Spider Man, Mission Impossible and Carlitos Way.  His writing is quite good where his direction is workman like.  John Kamps shares the writing credit.
 It made me feel young again to see this three and a half saw blade action flick.  It has a PG-13 rating but not much in the way of extreme language, no naked people (but Ramirez is in a tank top throughout the film) and only two murders.  I think I like this one more than the general public.  It cost $35 million to make and has only taken in $18 million in two weeks.  It runs a fast passed 91 minutes.",1445731200,,2794,4.47920792079208

5351717,2,B009MO5E10,"Bike messengers tooling around New York City at 25-30 mph on bikes with no brakes and hard geared with no coast mechanism. A messenger bag over the shoulder and a bike lock chain around the waist. A helmet and possibly knee and elbow pads their only protection. The hazards carelessly opened car doors, unsignalled lane changes and abrupt turns and kamikaze pedestrians. All this for $80/day or about $20,000/year if you stay healthy. If it's got to get there a bike messenger can do the job faster than any other service.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt has no less than four stand-ins. A real-life bike messenger adept at negotiating city traffic at speed, a bike racer, a stunt bike rider and a pro-stunt man for the dangerous accident scenes. All have physiques to match his lean compact frame. The DVD Supplements that demonstrate how the action was captured are a must-see. There are no high-octane chase scenes  la Fast and Furious but the kinetic energy of an unprotected human body captured close-up on a bike travelling up to 40 mph in traffic is quite dramatic.

The movie is special effects laden. The storyline is all about getting there as fast as possible. As portrayed these riders have a lifestyle but no life and therein lies the film's weakness.",1440288000,,1254,4.823255813953488

I was not impressed with the female lead's biking skills, nor her role in the story *at all*. As a female cyclist, I found that very disappointing. It was a little unbelievable that a skinny rider using a single gear bike could best a someone who was clearly a very strong athlete on a top-of-the-line racing bike - in a straight race. That was implied in the first scene. The underlying plot is simple, so you don't have to think about it much (which is good). The actors playing the hero and antagonist were really great.

5351763,3,B009MO5E10,"I don't know of any other movie besides this one that makes a story out of bike messengers and bike culture but, for what it's worth, PREMIUM RUSH was a fairly fast-paced and engaging watch. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Wilee, a New York City bike messenger who's been given an envelope to deliver. However, things get a little hairy when a dirty cop (Michael Shannon) wants to get his hands on it. That's basically it, so for those looking for something a little more complicated or substantive you might as well look elsewhere. Still, there is enough here to recommend. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is as good as he usually is, even for such a thinly written role. The real standout is Michael Shannon, who I've loved before for playing crazy or wacked-out characters. I highly doubt that his character was written so well, so I would chalk a lot of what he did to Shannon himself. He was so fun to watch, and he had a lot of great lines. Other than those two, however, the cast were basically placeholders while character development was all but absent. But yet, the film had some interesting visual elements. One of these that was used several times was when Wilee would come up to an intersection and it would visualize all of the possible scenarios in slow motion. I thought that was pretty cool, even though it got a little tiresome the last couple of times. Also, considering the lower budget, there were fill-in computer animated sequences that mapped a route from point A to point B, I guess as a means of reducing how much footage they had to shoot. I wasn't as keen on that shortcut but, again, it did look kind of cool. The final, but crucial, element which makes this film work was the bike action. It was fast-paced, energetic and filmed well. Not to mention that there was a lot of it, which should come as no surprise since most of the film is was one long chase. Overall, I wouldn't say that the film is that special with the exception of the uncommon subject matter. Bottom line, they were able to take a rather thin conceit, stretch it just enough and add some visual flair such that it makes a decent way to pass 90 minutes.",1422662400,,2135,4.51937984496124

5351803,1,B009MO5E10,"The top Amazon review of this film states: ""Just a good popcorn type movie where you don't really have to think."". I completely disagree. If anything, avoid popcorn because you'll choke on it in your frustration or end up throwing it at the TV. As far as ""not thinking"", you'd be better served and more entertained watching Jerry Springer.

Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a less-than ambitious underachiever who has found employment as a bike messenger in Manhattan --  and surprise! he is the best at it. So although he has poor character and a rocky relationship with his girlfriend (which, by the way, their story-line is a total yawn) we ""get to"" see his other side on the bike. We ""experience"" him expertly zooming around the city at 20 mph... if even that. Understandably it's an extremely dangerous job to have in a busy crowded city, which I'm sure the writers thought would make this a real nail-biter, however it falls depressingly short of ""tense"".
  Basically, he gets a package that the ludicrously dramatic villain, Bobby Monday (Michael Shannon) wants. The racing scenes are ridiculously unbelievable and boring. The action sequences are nothing new... The only novel element was how badly I wanted Bobby Monday to die so I wouldn't have to watch Michael Shannon embarrass himself any longer.
  Honestly, I WOULD be interested in watching a documentary on these messengers and their bike culture, which is what originally attracted me to this film. Joseph Gordon-Levitt also had something to do with it, since he usually involved with spectacular films/projects.

5351805,5,B009MO5E10,"Like any vehicle action chase film, this isn't trying to come across as realistic, it's just trying to entertain, and it does that nicely. You've got plenty of near misses for the good guy as he pulls off impossible moves through traffic, weaves through pedestrians on footpaths and jumps over hazards, all without making his bike unrideable as most of these actions would do in reality, with your standard vehicle chase scenes of cars spinning out of control and crashing in the background while the bad guy in a car, and a cop (for this movie on a bicycle) in pursuit for pretty much the entire film.  But so what?  If this was reality the underworld Chinese guys would simply phone the other person from a phone booth or on a disposable mobile phone and tell her with some sort of code sentence like ""set Johnny free"" that the girl had paid and to release her son.  But for this film to work, the delivery of a raffle ticket receipt with a smiley face drawn on it is required, and even more ridiculously anyone can cash this in for the $50 000 it cost to buy it if they are in possession of it. So unlike common sense reality where if a corrupt cop were to steal it and give it to them they'd just tell him, yeah nice raffle ticket I don't know anything about $50 000, but if you think that's a cheque try taking it to a bank and see what they say. But for Premium Rush, if the bad guy gets this ticket (at least in his mind) he gets the cash to pay his gambling debts.

Like all these sort of vehicle chase movies the outcome is pretty predictable but it sure was a lot of fun getting there. There's plenty of bike stunts, crashes and other action.  I would have preferred the movie didn't start off with a ten minutes to the end scene showing you what's going to eventuate, (and there were also a number of other flashbacks catching you up with what went down throughout the movie), but even with that, and some absurd being able to function seemingly without care with broken ribs that in reality would make it difficult to breath even when not on a bike doing mad stunts, entertainment wise, this just works.

If you liked this one and want a similar concept of a tad unrealistic but lots of fun to watch plot film involving bike chases check out the 80's movie BMX Bandits (don't be put off by the fact it has Nicole Kidman as a child actress in it), it's quite good, with bikes ridden in all kinds of places you don't see them everyday, they're even taken down a waterslide while trying to avoid the bad guys at one point in that one.",1417478400,,2543,4.298538622129437

5351810,4,B009MO5E10,"To sum it all up for you, this is the Quicksilver movie of this generation. However, I find the plot in this movie to be much more interesting than Quicksilver. Basically a message that has a couple of hours to deliver a package that could also cost him his life and it almost did. Combined with some old school stunt work and some CGI, I really think that the film did really well letting us take a look into the bike messenger world. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Wilee and the cool thing is that he's not only the main character and hero of the film but he plays a character that doesn't get his way all of the time. He doesn't win every situation but he's able to think on the fly and outrun everybody at a moments notice. A role like this is a lot more challenging than playing a super hero that can use his powers at a moments notice and save the day. In this case, Joseph's character had to hustle and scramble to get things done and when you're in the streets of New York City, you're going to need more brains than brawn to beat your enemies!!!

5351837,5,B009MO5E10,"Please keep in mind that this is a Hollywood film, a work of fiction, not a documentary nor a training film. I'm reasonably sure the cast, crew, director, producers, and every lawyer associated with the film disavow any intent of getting people who watch this film to emulate it in their daily lives. Okay? Good!

Ever since I first watched ""Bullitt"" (starring Steve McQueen, 1968) I've been a fan of GOOD chase films. Gods know there are plenty of BAD films in this genre. Watching a GOOD one is that much more pleasant.

That this is a chase film relying on bicycles is even better. Yes, I'm a person who rides a bicycle daily. Because I do so I believe I see things that those who don't ride miss. Barring a few minor things this is a GOOD bicycle movie as well.

The chase scenes are terrific! There are bike-on-bike chases and car-on-bike chases and both are so well shot that I kind of forgot where I was. I suppose it's a good thing that I'm not very familiar with the geography and physical layout of Manhattan as I'm sure there are a few edits that violate space-time as we know it.

One of my favorite things about the film was the three times the lead character was shown discovering a route through traffic. There's something about finding that bike-shaped hole that draws me in.

The lead characters, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Shannon, Dania Ramirez and Jamie Chung, do a great job (though not Oscar winningly so). There isn't anything particularly new in the storyline, plot, or character relationships but what's there is presented in an entertaining manner. I never cringed during any of the love-interest scenes or the character-development dialog, both of which can be fatal to a movie like this.

It seems Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a great deal of his own riding up to and including the crash that sent him through the rear window of a cab. I believe the director used some of that footage in the film. Stick around for the first bit of credit roll as you will see the crash results.

If you want this to be an anthropological study of the NYC bicycle messenger culture you will be disappointed. You might get a Hollywood version of it, largely through the use of extras, but it isn't real.

If you want to complain about the characters riding in traffic, violating laws, and the whole ""brakes are death"" thing . . . well, go elsewhere. This is entertainment, damn it! ;-)",1409443200,5,2404,4.600467289719626

The acting was very ordinary and boring with the exception being Michael Shannon (as the bad cop) who played the role very over the top - he turned on a dime from comical to maniacal in some scenes.

5351863,3,B009MO5E10,"For a film involving the material presented, Premium Rush is actually pretty decent. It's not a great movie, but there's some fun to be had with it.

JGL is good as always and Michael Shannon does is fantastic as the over-the-top villain. The film has a great start quickly setting up the plot and getting right into the action. The action scenes and stunt work in the film are excellent and really well choreographed. There are some unique little things the film does as well that I really enjoyed such as the moments where we would see JGL planning out which route he would take next inside his head. It has a nice little B-Movie feel with an 80's vibe which I really dug. There was also a surprisingly amount of funny moments in the film thanks the whole light hearted tone the film takes. It never takes itself too seriously, but it never becomes too silly either.

However, Premium Rush flaws take some of the fun out of it. My biggest complaint of the film is the flashback scenes. In the start of the film, we get the idea that it's going to be a non-stop action thrill ride. However, when the film gets toward the 2nd act when the adrenaline gets going, the film stops to fill in the gaps in the story using lengthy and boring flashback sequences that drag on forever. It felt has if the flashback sequences alone took up about a good 20-25 minutes of the films short 90 minute running time which really bothered me. I understand the need to fill in the gaps in the story, but when you throw them in once the adrenaline gets going and they drag on for a good amount of time, it becomes rather frustrating to the viewer. Besides JGL and Shannon, the rest of the acting is pretty bad, especially Jamie Chung who is doing one of the worst Asian accents that I've ever heard. There was also one scene towards the end of the film that felt really out of place considering the film's tone.

Overall, Premium Rush isn't that great or even memorable ( I actually forgot about it very quickly after I saw it), but there's enough fun to be had with it to make it worth a viewing. Nothing you need to rush out in see, but it makes for a good viewing on a day you've got nothing better to do and a perfect rental.",1395273600,,2209,4.3180722891566266

5351889,4,B009MO5E10,"Uh-oh, it's actors on bicycles on the streets of New York, acting. Not FedEx, not UPS, the closest descendant to the Pony Express, in my eyes, is the aggressive bicycle messenger. The amended credo should be ""Neither rain, nor snow, nor sleet, nor crazed cabbies, nor inattentive pedestrians..."" In New York City, home to eight million, 1,500 daredevil bike couriers navigate the bustling steel canyons at 30 mph, and Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) styles himself the speediest one. He rides his fixie - this super lightweight, single gear, no brake having bike - with wild abandon. For this daily adrenaline fix, he gave up law school and a life as a paper pusher. He mentions how it's a good day if he makes $80.

Well, different strokes for different folks, Wilee. I wonder, is it worth the $30 he's offered to premium rush a mysterious envelope from 116th & Broadway all the way to Chinatown? Wilee collects the package at 5:33pm and is given the delivery deadline of 7pm. For the best bike courier in Manhattan, this should be no thing but a chicken wing. But, Wilee, man plans and God laughs, and one simply never plans for intervention from a dirty cop with ""impulse-control issues.""

There are some terrific elements to PREMIUM RUSH. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, of course, handles his business. The stunt work is impressive. The chase scenes are eye-catching stuff. Dania Ramirez as Wilee's slighted girlfriend/fellow messenger is gorgeous eye candy. It's plenty funny. PREMIUM RUSH reminds me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cellular-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/B0006D3HGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cellular (New Line Platinum Series)</a>&nbsp;in a lot of ways. Both narratives are framed around a breakneck race against time. Both make use of the city and its denizens as obstacles. Both feature stand-out big bads in the shape of crooked constabulary. Michael Shannon's performance as NYPD sleaze Bobby Monday is a mini tour de force. Shannon veers close to caricature territory but never quite goes over. The whole time, he generates this sense of crazed menace, of alarming unpredictability. Inasmuch as a fellow lead actor can steal scenes, this guy does so. He's like if one of the Three Stooges had turned to the dark side.

It's a film constructed of familiar bits. We're given broad strokes in terms of character work, and that's okay. That, and the simplicity in plot allow the filmmakers to give the audience what they want: compressed storytelling executed in real time - barring a flashback or three - and reliant on spellbinding action beats. This film demonstrates that old-fashioned creativity and big hustle and well-done practical effects can trump the almighty CGI. There are four permutations of the chase, all four involving Wilee and his beloved fixie. I love the recurring gimmick in which we get a peek at Wilee's split-second internal process as he calculates his safest passage thru the lethal streets of Manhattan. As Wilee projects possible scenarios, we see the resulting mayhem and carnage play out should he choose the wrong route. I think these are the only moments in which CG plays a part. Anyway, it's nice to see Joseph Gordon-Levitt take a break from the more ambitious projects. Here, it's obvious how much of a blast he's having. I can even tell his four stunt doubles are having equal doses of fun. And how awesome and comic is that bike cop, him what's a stunt guy that's never acted before? That put-upon bike cop may've been my favorite side character. Maybe he should've paid heed to Wilee's terse, all-encompassing philosophy: ""Brakes are death.""

When I saw he was going to be in an action thriller, about bike messengers in Manhattan, I couldn't wait to see it, but sadly I was very disappointed. It's a normal day for bike messenger Riley (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), as he picks up a package and goes on his way. Everything is fine until a strange man tries to run him down and steal the package. From there its a race through NYC to see who gets the mysterious package first. Premium Rush is Gone In 60 Seconds on bicycles. The plot is weak, the story is predictable, and the whole film is basically one big chase through Manhattan. Yes, Premium Rush is exciting at first, but after a half hour, it gets very tiresome, very quickly. JGL tries his hardest to turn this film into something, but even a star of his caliber can't save this film, because there really isn't anything to save. It's as if the producers said, lets have a car chasing a bike in New York City and develop some kind of story around that. It doesn't work, because seldom I have been this bored and frustrated by an action movie. It stars one of my top 10 favorite actors, but there really isn't much of a role for him to play.

I'll probably watch it again real soon just for the adrenaline rush. Plus, I adore Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Also, love the ComboFormats that are offered in movies now.

Another fun performance is that of the cop in question, played by the terrific Michael Shannon, who plays his part with humor, intensity, and brutality.

It's about bike messengers, the risks they take and the fast paced lives they lead.  I watched it this weekend with my daughter -- she's 26 and I'm 59 -- and we were both on the edge of our seats, yelling at the screen and cheering for the good guys.  Joseph Gordon Levitt is so easy on the eyes, too!  The camera work in this movie is nothing short of stunning and the pace never slows down.  The crazy wild-eyed nutcase of a cop is played by the same actor who plays the crazy wild-eyed IRS psychopath in Boardwalk Empire.  Has a great story attached to the envelope he is trying to deliver and keep away from the bad guy.  We liked it so much we're going to buy it.  Usually I do hobbies while watching a movie, but this one had all my attention and flew by!  The ONLY reason I didn't give the DVD set five stars is they didn't put any extras!  Really?  I cannot believe they didn't have extras for this movie.  With all the stunts and camera work involved, not to mention how in the world they filmed through busy NYC streets, there must be tons of great bloopers, outtakes and deleted scenes!!!  Shame on them for not taking the time to include those for the purchaser.

5352020,5,B009MO5E10,"This is a movie about a bad cop and a guy who thwarts his evil plans.  But there's too much bicycle riding in it.  It seems like every other scene has at least one person riding on a bicycle.  Sometimes there are three or four and (spoiler alert!) at the end there are a whole BUNCH of bicycle riders circling the bad cop.  Usually, someone is chasing someone else, and the person being chased is on a bicycle.  Why always a bicycle?  People could be chased while driving a car, and many movies have had such scenes in them.  Maybe if they varied it up a bit- make people chase each other on ATVs through a swamp, or on foot through a crowd or something.  While I'm not opposed to bicycles altogether, it hardly makes sense to have an entire movie about riding them.  The rest of the plot was pretty good.  The good guy helps someone out, gets his girlfriend to love him even more, and thwarts the evil plans of a really bad cop.  What more do you need than that?  Certainly not bicycles.

My verdict: Great Movie! (But too much bicycle riding)

P.S. Not to be picky, but the ENTIRE MOVIE takes place in New York City.  A little more variety would have been nice.  They could have shot scenes in Trenton, NJ or a generic small town in the middle of Texas.  Of course, to get there you'd have to drive something other than a bicycle, so there's your reason.

I shouldn't be able to predict the movie from the first scene, but unfortunately that's what this movie was....predictable. Being a biker myself..I did enjoy the biking scenes. Acting was below average. Watch it once from some one who already owns it; not worth adding to any worthwhile movie collection. Two much better choices are 2 seconds (a great cycling movie), or Red Light Go (if you want to see what being a messenger is all about).",1370736000,,579,4.523809523809524
5352022,4,B009MO5E10,"Premium Rush is perhaps one of the most exciting bike-riding movies ever.  It's about a delivery boy (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who's job is to make prompt deliveries without anything standing in his way however... what if someone were to come out of nowhere and demand the delivery boy hand a package over to him?  This is the situation Joseph faces one afternoon.

A guy (played by Michael Shannon) that we soon realize is a dirty cop associated with the Chinese mafia (or at least pretends to be associated) demands that Joseph hand over an important letter but... he refuses to, and since the delivery boy has a ton of experience on his bike given the fact he has to swerve around heavy Manhattan traffic all day, he's easily able to evade the cop.  Of course this is all entirely unrealistic since in reality a cop chasing a biker around presents a LOT of dangerous situations that wouldn't end well for either of them, but for the sake of an action/adventure film, it provides a good deal of entertainment watching the biker outsmart the cop time and time again as he knows all the secret shortcuts and hidden entrances between buildings that enable him to always stay one step ahead of the cop.

One little detail the movie utilizes that I really admire is whenever Joseph is presented with a tricky situation so he contemplates the possible worst case scenarios involving a bike accident in his head before making the appropriate action.  Nice details there.  We actually *see* the possibilities of the worst case scenarios, since the movie writers went the extra mile and included them.  Other times Joseph finds himself racing against others (either friends of his, or friendly competitors- not really sure which) in the hopes of making a delivery before they do.  Friendly -but serious- competition basically.

My only complaint is when all this bike riding excitement takes a back seat so a storyline involving a China town in Manhattan can develop, and specifically a Chinese woman who's desperately trying to legally get her young son out of China and into the United States.  Michael Shannon's police officer character constantly finds himself roughing up -or attempting to rough up- either Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character or the Asian people he deals with.  As a result, the bike racing excitement takes a back seat so this aspect of the storyline can develop which creates some slowdown and boredom from time to time (and the reason I'm taking away one star from the overall rating).

Overall, despite the occasional boring moments, Premium Rush mostly delivers in bike riding, cop evasion entertainment.",1370736000,,2628,4.945454545454545

The thin premise of director/co-writer David Koepp's film works up to a point, as long as the film's story keeps moving on, with bike chase scenes that are thrilling and exciting. ""Premium Rush"" benefits from nice stunt work and effective editing, as well as the on-location cinematography of Manhattan.

But the film uses one or two too many flashbacks in following the back story of those who got involved with the envelope. With an exception of Michael Shannon's enjoyable performance, there is not much in those flashback parts that are really interesting.

Being a bike geek who actually does ride a fixed-gear bike in traffic pretty often (albeit in downtown Boston), I know I'd get killed trying to do half the stuff Wilee pulls.  And the ""fixed-gear versus gears"" rivalry between two messengers is nothing new; Kevin Bacon and Lawrence Fishburne were there first in ""Quicksilver.""  The chase scene in Central Park is pretty realistic, however.  I've occasionally cut corners, had to jump a curb or two, or cut across grass--just not while racing someone.

5352045,4,B009MO5E10,"""Premium Rush"" was apparently a late-summer release -- not usually a help at the box office.  I don't know how it did in that regard but I found it to be very exciting and visually involving with some good  touches of humor along the way.  The lead character ""Wiley"" is played  by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, whom I consider to be a very gifted actor judging from some of his earlier films, notably ""Mysterious Skin"" (2004) and ""The Lookout"" (2007).  He is also fine in this film with great screen presence and physical ability; he did many of the risky bicycle stunts himself.  He plays the part of a delivery guy on a bike in busy Manhattan who is attempting to deliver a package that his adversary, well played by Michael Shannon, wants to grab before he can deliver it.

Basically this is a rather simple set up story wise, but the  cinematography throughout Manhattan has to be seen to be believed.  The camera car is the real hero of the film and is shown in the special features section as being a highly maneuverable vehicle having a camera arm in its roof extending several feet beyond the front or back of the car.  I imagine the cinematographer would be sitting in the back seat with camera controls and a video-assist set up providing control of a Panaflex hanging from the end of the arm resulting in the some very nifty shooting.  Watching on a flat-screen of a decent size, the viewer's sense of motion and involvement is undeniable.  Gordon-Levitt's ""Wiley"" character hooks us right from the start and we are on the bike with him thanks to the subjective POV shooting made possible with the camera car.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt has had a few small but important roles in some recent big-ticket pictures; I'm predicting that his blockbuster is not too far away.  :.",1366502400,,1771,4.634615384615385

5352048,4,B009MO5E10,So the main reason I even watched this is because I really love Joseph Gordon-Levitt and have been a long time fan since his 3rd Rock days. With that said this was a good movie!  The scenes from the view point of the bike messenger were unique and gave you the feeling that they really process a scene that way and that quickly. Chase scenes where good. Acting from the main characters was also very good. It kept my interest and I have a new fascination and appreciation for bike messengers!,1364688000,,492,4.406593406593407

5352050,4,B009MO5E10,"I am a fan of Joseph Gordon -Levitt, even back to `Third Rock from the Sun' because he got to act with the tremendous John Lithgow. Here he takes on the role of Wille (pronounced Wylie as in Wylie Coyote) who is a bicycle courier in New York City. He works for a negotiated price for each gig. He has an on and off sort of relationship with co worker Vanessa (Dania Ramirez - `American Reunion').

Well he gets asked to pick up a letter from the University for a mere thirty bucks and get it to a specific address within two hours. First thing that happens is a corrupt cop tries to get it from him, but Wille does a runner or rather heads off in the mad traffic being pursued by Detective Bobby Monday played with pantomime nastiness by Michael Shannon (of the really good `Take Shelter' and the not so really good `Pear Harbor'). Thus we are all set for a high octane chase through Manhattan and I must say the last time I saw this many `horns' getting blown was in a cheap porno.

This is a sit back and turn your brain off kind of flick. It is just a full throttle action fest based on bicycles and a few cars getting in the way and ineptly crashing into things. There are also issues around Chinese immigration and the troubles they encounter in order to get into a country - even legally and the culture rift there is between them and the West and it is all handled rather well. There is also the relationship bit which sits quite well within the stories context.

Directed by David Koepp who is more famous for his writing abilities but he did direct `Stir of Echoes' and has worked on `Spiderman', `Mission Impossible' and even that last `Indiana Jones and the Crystal Meth' or what ever it was called, but either way the guy clearly has talent. He crams all this action into 91 minutes so there is no way you are ever going to get bored. If you like this there is a great little Korean film called `Adrenaline Rush', about a motor bike courier and lots of explosions which is also an action fest on two wheels.

The corrupt cop was the best of the bunch.  He had this attitude like ""Are you really going to make me kill you?  You know killing you will really spoil my day.  Just do what I want and we will both be happy.""  He was hilarious.

Another interesting thing about the movie was the manipulation of the time line.

This was easily one of the worst films I've ever seen, in any genre. I mean, it's not quite as bad as ""Jade"" or ""Showgirls"" or ""Poetic Justice,"" but it's pretty close.  In fact, the lack of that extra layer of pure awfulness makes this less of a classic than those steamers, since this film suffers more from mediocrity and poor direction than from pure, cosmic-level stinkiness. My wife and I went into this with low expectations, anticipating a not-great-but-watchably-mindless action flick with two actors we admire (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who has been doing amazing work recently in films such as ""50/50"" and stone-faced Michael Shannon, who was riveting in ""Boardwalk Empire"".)

From the opening first few seconds, it was apparent that the director was playing this for laughs, with the character stereotypes so broad and the plot and script so brazenly bad that the idea was hey, just relax into it and enjoy the ride. Sadly, though, there wasn't enough substance behind the nudge-nudge, wink-wink to sustain any real interest, and the laxness of the filmmaking infects the entire project. The performers clearly quit trying early on: Gordon-Levitt goes all Keanu and blank, happy to cash a check for just riding a bike round and getting a good workout, while Shannon barks and shouts and glowers his way through bad scene after bad scene -- an actor who thrives on restraint was told to over-emote and chew scenery, and it was a huge mistake.

At its core, ""Premium Rush"" is simply not a good film. It could have been an okay popcorn-muncher but it wound up being a worthless dud. Like, shockingly lame. There's one fun scene with James Hong speaking unsubtitled Chinese, but that's about it. There's really nothing else worth watching in the entire film. (Axton)",1363564800,3,1785,4.94

5352149,4,B009MO5E10,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

It's hard to find the right term to summarize Premium Rush. One of the film's best qualities is that it's unique. This is definitely something that's never been done before, and if it has I've never seen it. Another solid thing about Premium Rush is that it's fun and it's engaging. There are no firefights, there are no huge explosions, but at the same time it manages to be an adrenaline rush.

Premium Rush follows three characters, Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Bobby Monday (Michael Shannon), and Nima (Jamie Chung), throughout a crazy day that manages to entangle all three of their lives together. Wilee is a bike messenger out of, what seems like, necessity. He can't see himself in an office and he doesn't like suits. Still, the thrill of riding alone isn't enough. Wilee's bike contains no gears and no brake. His bike can't stop, and he doesn't want to.

Bobby is an officer for the NYPD who has a pretty bad gambling problem. That's where Nima comes in. Nima is a quite, reserved, woman who works at a college. Her main goal is to import a special package from China. Bobby's sharks tell him that he needs to intercept the ticket that she gave to Wilee if he wants to smooth things out.

I wasn't really expecting the film's story to take this route, but I still found it enjoyable. Gordon-Levitt gave another fantastic performance as Wilee. If he keeps this up he's going to have one of the most versatile catalogs in the film business. He isn't afraid to take on a role and it seems to be working in his favor.

As much as I wanted to like Shannon's performance I found it to be somewhat forced. I don't know if it was because I didn't like his character, I hated Bobby with a passion, or if I just genuinely did not like his performance, but I didn't find him enjoyable. He isn't terrible and, at times, he does a good job, but his performance isn't consistent. Chung didn't have as big of a role as the other two main characters, but she delivered in all of her scenes.

The only thing that really irritated me about the movie is that, in two scenes, there was conversations between two characters that was all in Chinese. This wouldn't be a problem, but, unlike almost every film ever made, they didn't include subtitles. So the viewer is sitting there like a moron because they have no idea what's being said. In one of the scenes the conversation last at least 90 seconds so it feels awkward for those don't speak, or understand, the language.

Overall Score: 8/10 - I highly doubt Premium Rush will go down as one of the greatest films ever created. However, while it isn't necessarily jaw-dropping, it manages to keep the viewer interested throughout the entire 90 minutes. I think it could have benefited from a more intricate plot, but I would still recommend watching this if you have the time.",1361232000,,2870,4.582846003898635
5352150,5,B009MO5E10,I enjoyed the movie. It was something different and not boring at anytime. The whole family was able to enjoy it together.,1361232000,,122,4.590909090909091
5352151,3,B009MO5E10,"There are a lot of great looking bicycle stunts provided in the new thriller Premium Rush, nearly a dozen stunt people are credited with these eye popping visuals that take up a great majority of the movie's running time. The movie has also boasts a good cast to it's disposal, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Michael Shannon lend an air of unexpected respectability and add weight to what on the surface would at least appear to be a generic potboiler.
 Following the exploits of a Manhattan bike messenger, Wilee (Gordon-Levitt), as in the coyote, who could be a lawyer if he wanted, but can't stand to wear suits and has a need for daredevil thrills that he finds in the New York streets working for about eighty bucks a day. Bobby Monday (Shannon) is a seedy cop who looses a large sum of money at a gambling house in Chinatown, then makes a careless loan and goes across the street to bet and loose at another gambling house.
 There paths eventually cross when Wilee is entrusted with an envelope from his girlfriend's roommate that Monday wants to get his hands on. The reason is of little importance, this is what ""the master of suspense"" Alfred Hitchcock referred to as ""the McGuffin"", it's what drives the plot, but the audience doesn't particularly care about. The cop is dogged in his pursuit of the package, and thus Wilee, and is willing to chase the young man across the near entirety of the city.
 Told in more or less real time, the movie is a fully charged and a willing suspense tale that is regrettably underdeveloped, at times tragically routine and far too often silly, resorting to fairly obvious and unconvincing developments. It sizzles at first and then fizzles in the middle. With so much going for it, it would seem a rather surprising stumble.
 The camerawork by Mitchell Amundsen is the main asset of the film, helping to get the audience into the feel of the chase and the bike messenger lifestyle. If the rest of the movie utilized this sort of skill and adventure this film would really be able to move more and could offer a lot more thrills. As it is the thrills are dangerously few for a thriller. The editing is taunt in the service of tedious direction.
 The leads could be good too, but are given too little to do, they aren't offered the chance for any depth in their roles. Gordon-Levitt has charisma and in the past has proven to be a capable lead performer, but he just fails to have anything to show here and ends up lacking the necessary spark. Gordon-Levitt has been having an impressive year with solid roles in strong movies like Looper, the Dark Knight Rises and Spielberg's Lincoln, 2012 will be remembered as the year that he came into his own as a star, but at least one of his movies will be completely forgotten. Shannon, a very talented character actor, likewise is good, but his role lacks any meat, he is regrettably just a typical movie bad guy.
 Directed by David Koepp, one of Hollywood's top screenwriters with credits on blockbusters such as Spider-man, Mission: Impossible, the first two Jurassic Park movies, as well as Angels & Demons and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. As a director, Koepp is a different story though, his credits are by far less impressive including the failed Ricky Gervais vehicle Ghost Town, the Stephen King adaptation Secret Window and something called the Trigger Effect. Premium Rush does nothing to elevate his flagging ambitions as an auteur.
 Despite a great start, Koepp's script, which seems to be aimed at thirteen year olds, is amongst his worst, chocked full of clichs, unlikely developments and some of the most laugh out loud dialogue of the year. Gordon-Levitt's assertion that ""breaks equal death"" is likely be the most memorable part of this whole shamble. It also lacks suspense, the needed tension and a satisfying conclusion. Koepp is known for trouble with third acts, but this time he flounders in beginning of the second.
 Any attempts at character development is strictly relegated to the realm of clich.  Wilee's girlfriend, a fellow rider named Vanessa (Daniela Ramirez) wants him to act more mature and finish his education or she's breaking up with him. Wilee has a rival for Vanessa's attention who's also a hot shot messenger. Then there is the subplot involving human trafficking that is not only under investigated, but all but discarded and when used strictly as a plot devise, it would seem the movie is in favor of this human violation atrocity.
 Premium Rush feels long for ninety-one minutes and by the mid way point I had had more than enough bicycle chases for one movie and just wanted the whole thing to get on with it's story, but it doesn`t really have one to get on with. Then it develops into a ridicules, sad sack of a final twist of simplistic sappiness.
  I have an undeniable fondness for a well made action film, I have great admiration for a fine tuned thriller, but Premium Rush is neither, it fails as the most rudimentary escapist entertainment. In the end this all plays out like the Jason Statham Transporter movies at about fifteen miles per hour. Or maybe it's ambitions were just to be training wheels of anarchy.

If this combination appeals to you, then by all means race to the theater or buy this movie now. There is not a moment wasted in this taut thriller as it starts at 6:30 P.M., jumps back to 4:30, brings us to 5:45, then jumps to a different character earlier at 1:30 that afternoon. All of these pieces come together to help explain what happened at the critical 6:30 juncture of the movie, which then propels us to the ending.

All the actors are fine, but the real star is the cinematographer who takes us whizzing through crowded NYC streets on the heels and wheels of the bike messengers that are at the heart of the movie. Do we need to believe that Joseph Gordon-Levit is really riding the bike in long scenes? Of course not! Did we really believe Christopher Reeve was flying? No. Do we really think Sylvester Stallone was getting punched in Rocky 3? No. Do we really think Sharon Stone wasn't wearing....Yeah, we do.

You've got a nod to current bike culture with the debate between the typical geared/brake bike set-up versus the hip ""fixie"" culture now with no gears/brakes.  Also a very tiny cameo of a modern dirt jump mountain bike.  Aside from the bikes, you get a story line that is pretty much what you'll be expecting from the previews, no real surprises or twists, but good none-the-less.  I would say this is kind of a light action-drama (most of the action will be from the bike scenes), with plenty of Joseph Gordon-Levitt (he's a good actor and we enjoy most of his movies, so if you're a fan you won't be disappointed).

action film of this past year with a team of young attractive cast and the great Michael Shannon as a cop.

5352272,4,B009MO5E10,"Is this a 'smart' movie?  No.  It's clever at times, but I doubt you're going to tax any brain cells.  However, this is an extremely 'fun' movie.  If you're expecting the Joseph Gordon-Levitt from Brick, Inception, Looper, or The Dark Knight Rises, you might be disappointed.  If you're expecting the Joseph Gordon-Levitt from GI Joe, you might be pleasantly surprised. Really, this movie is a PG-13 Crank mixed with a contemporary Gleaming the Cube for urban cyclists. If that description sounds like something you'd want to watch, I think you'll have a good time with this movie.  If that just sounds terrible to you, you're a boring person who needs to loosen up and have some fun.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character development in this movie begins and ends with ""I like to ride a bicycle fast and recklessly."" Some movies would try to tack on more levels of character development here, but Premium Rush only gives a quick nod to the fact that he has a life beyond his bike.  But he is extremely charming while riding said bike. Michael Shannon is the perfect dirty cop.  Again, you don't need much character development here, he's channeling every dirty cop you've seen in another movie. And he's the perfect actor for it; he just has that creepy vibe you might recognize from his time on Boardwalk Empire, it's like the off-putting delivery of Willem Dafoe in Boondock Saints mixed with the poor impulse control of Gary Oldman in Leon/The Professional.  And there's some other people who like to ride bikes, or give people on bikes stuff, or chase people on bikes.  Really, the only other person you'll likely remember after the movie is over is Aasif Mandvi AKA that guy from The Daily Show (and Jericho, remember that show?).

This is a chase movie, with wackiness and bike culture aplenty. And a plot point that either requires a previous understanding of hawala or a willingness to just overlook the need to understand it, as the movie is moving too quickly to stop and really explain that.  If you want to watch Joseph Gordon-Levitt be charming, ride a bike, and thwart Michael Shannon with his traffic predicting brain powers, this is the perfect movie for you.  If you're the kind of person who gets hung up on films needing a 'plot' and 'character development', you might want to sit this one out.  But you really should try and join us in the first group--sometimes you just need to turn off your brain to have a fun time.",1358121600,,2436,4.712264150943396

I was surprised at how entertaining it was.  I'm certainly glad I rented it and I eneded up adding this one to my video library.  Although you might expect it to be somewhat predictable, there is enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seat.  It isn't as simple as being able to ride a bicycle, and many are getting an education or starting a business.  On the street there is danger everywhere, and it may not be from a speeding car.
A bike courier finds himself harassed by a police detective wanting an envelope he picked up for delivery.  As the story unfolds we see there is the life of a small child at stake weighed against a cop willing to do anything to pay off a gambling debt that could cost him his life.  The courier is also being chased by the bicycle police for causing an automobile accident.  What may start out as some background on the daily life of a bicycle courier goes far deeper and makes you realize the kinds of things they carry from point a to point b may be life changing.  When I showed this to the wife and stepdaughter they enjoyed it too.  I hope they make a sequel.

5352295,4,B009MO5E10,"Ok, let's face it...this is a movie that doesn't quite fall under the category of ""epic"" or ""a masterpiece"", but that being said, the movie was actually quite enjoyable to watch.

Joseph Gordon Levitt is super cool in this movie, as he typically is in many of the movies he's in.  The rest of the cast wasn't too bad either.  LoL, the guy that plays Levitt's boss in the movie...I hadn't remembered seeing him since the 2nd Spiderman movie, the pizza shop owner Parker worked for.  Good times.

Anyway, I won't waste any time going into detail about the premis of the movie, as you can just as easily see that in some other reviews or on the movie's main page, and I certainly won't spoil anything for any of you.  All I'll say is that the movie contains some thrilling bicycle chases (I felt so bad for the bicycle cop, LoL...those who've seen the movie know what I'm talking about), and there is some good humor in it too.

One thing's for sure, I don't think I could do what Levitt and some of these other couriers do in the film, least of all in New York City, but it sure makes for an exciting movie.  Definitely give this one a watch folks!",1357862400,,1146,4.322429906542056

5352311,5,B009MO5E10,How do you make a movie about bicycles entertaining and thrilling? The answer is Premium Rush.  I originally thought this would be along the lines of Quicksilver but what a difference 26 years makes.  Incredible footage of bicycles messengers screaming through the streets of New York.

I can see the quality drop from 4 to 1.  I use a Roku box to stream movies.  The quality of one star sucks.  The movie is blurred and pixelated, the sound is borderline garbled.

5352389,5,B009MO5E10,"Get ready for this rock 'em sock 'em roller coaster ride on two tires. This is the Joseph Gordon-Levitt outing as a bike messenger supreme. I loved this film.

There are a lot of neat elements. First time director David Koepp rivets us to our seats with the almost non-stop biking action on New York's savage streets. He did a kickass job on the action elements with some tight street level shots of the bikes in motion. It tracks, though. Unlike a lot of action films that get caught up in the action for its own sake. All the activity fits and furthers the story. Very nice use of the GPS as a tool for the messengers and also for shooting out a map for the audience to see and understand the context of the riding. Koepp has first rate screen writing credits including Jurassic Park, Spiderman and Panic Room.

So, what about the story. It involves JGL in the role of Wilee ( as in Wiley Coyote, beep beep) three time winner of the best bike messenger award. He used to do trick riding, but now confines himself to his fixed gear single speed bike with no brakes, a true wheelman.

His hot ex-gf, Vanessa,  played by Dania Ramirez, also delivers the goods on two wheels. Their issue though is that Wilee quit law school to ride his bike while Dania is working on the bike to get a straight job and leave bike messengering. They have split up because he blew off her school program for a bike race.

The plot gets interesting quickly and mysteriously. Koepp here gets credit for his non-linear delivery. You have probably seen the trailer on TV which shows Wilee being chased on his bike and screaming into the phone about what was in that package.
Koepp fills us in with a number of flashbacks that work wonderfully for my money. They reminded me of Tarantino's use of them in Pulp Fiction.

A very clever cop with a gambling problem played by Michael Shannon provides the dark side of the story. He wants the message the Wilee has contracted to deliver. Wilee, of course, refuses to give it up. So, we have an establishment cop for a heavy pitted against a bike messenger who wants to play by the rules.

And the fun begins with the first of many chases.

It's fascinating that the whole bike messenger world is an outside-the-establishment scene. The writing is so good that you don't know if this is just good-guy vs bad-guy, or really an anti-establishment story. As authoritarianism has flourished in the last few years, the idea of authority figures being evil is a logical response.

Not incidentally, I loved the James Cameron TV series Dark Angel with Jessica Alba as a bike messenger. There is a slight reminiscence of that off the grid camaraderie here, too.

I always liked JGL in Third Rock From the Sun also on TV.

I recommend Premium Rush highly. It will definitely make you want to get out an ride your bike - just not through New York traffic.

They did a great job on the DVD, too!

The film crew hired a bunch of real bike messengers for some of the scenes. Also, JGL trained like an olympic athlete for his part. Nice scenes of them riding and also interviews with the main characters about their roles and preparation. I loved the film, reviews elsewhere and highly recommend the DVD.

The director had a really good idea and he executed it well.

BTW, I am a serious bike rider and this for my money the best biking movie ever.",1357171200,7,3353,4.473770491803279
5352390,3,B009MO5E10,"If you don't want to think but want to see a decent movie with some nice action shots, this is it.  JGL is good in it but if they picked a better bad guy, that would have improved the movie dramatically.  He is terrible.",1357171200,,220,3.977272727272727
5352391,5,B009MO5E10,"This movie is an instant favorite, the kind i'll watch many times. It just arrived in the mail today and the story was riveting.

5352392,3,B009MO5E10,"It's great to see Hollywood picking up on the fact that people sure seem to like riding bikes these days and also to showcase some of the daredevil moves that define alley-cat racing. All viewers will be impressed by the riding in this movie and a good many of them will be utterly amazed to see what kind of moves can be done on 2 wheels. That said, I found this movie to be pretty weak. Viewers who are interested in seeing some truly incredible riding should check out Lucas Brunelle's alley-cat racing documentary ""Line of Sight"" instead.

I've seen it twice now and I still don't understand what the Bad Guy was up to.  I don't want to spoil anything, but JGL plays a bike messenger and the Bad Guy wants something he is carrying.  I still don't know why the Bad Guy wants that envelope, how he found out about it, etc.  I will have to pay more attention the next time I watch this to see if I can figure that out.

5352440,2,B009MO5E10,"Despite strained efforts at building excitement this was a boring film from start to finish.  The plot is poorly conceived, and the character's are one-dimensional stereotypes.  As for the plot i ask: Why is the bike messenger required when the woman requesting the delivery ended up at the destination at the same time as the bike messenger?  She obviously had plenty of time to take the thing herself.  I understand suspending disbelief in drama, but this really tests the viewer's intelligence.  That said, if you have 90 minutes to kill on a poorly conceived vehicle for 20 mph action where the biggest looming threat is an opened car door, then by all means spend your $3.99 on Premium Rush.",1356739200,,696,4.815126050420168
5352441,2,B009MO5E10,"Levitt and Shannon should be embarrassed to be associated with this, and I figure in time they'll admit it.  It's like a Saved by The Bell movie with better production value.
The story doesn't develop enough to warrant an hour and a half and the soundtrack reinforces the feeling that there's nothing new being shown.  It's so corny at times you wonder if it's supposed to be an ironic spoof with Levitt doing a cheap Franco impersonation from 127 hours and Shannon coming across like a much less interesting Ray Liotta dirty cop, any one of the many he's played.  And I'm a fan of the acting work of both Levitt and Shannon, most notably Shannon in Take Shelter, an all time great performance in a role tailor made for him.
If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have rented, and I refuse to justify money and time spent by pretending this is anything more than garbage.  What a waste.",1356739200,,890,4.441717791411043
5352442,4,B009MO5E10,This was a decent action flick.  The movie moves forward and backwards in time through a series of flashbacks so you'll be confused if you step away from the screen to grab a snack. There were some really violent scenes that may be too intense for kids and squeamish adults.  You won't be bored watching this film and you may need to pause it so you can catch your breath during some of the chase scenes.  Enjoy!!,1356652800,,413,4.337662337662338

Wilee is a messenger that delivers rush packages in New York on his bike. He has no brakes, on his bike and we wonder how he is still alive.

It happens that the receipt represent the exact payment of a Chinese immigrant student to the Chinese mafia for her son to come and joint her. It also happens that the amount of money also represent the exact amount that a corrupt NYPD detective owes to the Chinese mafia. Who is going to get the ticket and what is going to happen to the little Chinese kid? Now you got the plot and you probably even guessed the ending.

This is about a bike messenger in New York (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who takes a dangerous package that puts him in great peril, even more than the constant running of red lights in rush hour. This features two of my favorite actors in Gordon-Levitt and Michael Shannon; I like them so much, I didn't even bother looking up anything about it, I just went. Unfortunately, though, this is only adequate. I could never get 100% excited or invested, and I think that is largely due to the story not being terribly strong; there are a number of cliches in this, and it feels awfully familiar for an otherwise original movie. The things that Premium Rush does have going for it is the fact that it is pretty non-stop, and there is extra depth that Shannon and Gordon-Levitt add to what would be shallow characters; JGL brings the charisma and Shannon bring the intensity. If you are a fan of the X-Games, you'll probably get more out of this, but for me, this never felt substantial at any point, and was just a decent way to pass the time.",1356220800,,1073,4.536082474226804

5352557,4,B009MO5E10,"For a change of venue and scenery as far as thriller/chase films go PREMIUM RUSH takes on the bike messengers of NYC and manages to create a story about the derring-do of bike messengers, the seemingly endless tales of bad cops, the cruelty of Chinese immigration cartels, love, and snappy dialogue and provide an enjoyable ride about the great New York City. Written (with John Kamps) and directed by David Koepp whose screenplay writing credits are most impressive, the cast is terrific and seem to be having a great time with this fast paced escapade.

Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is one of 1,500 bike couriers in Manhattan who rides on the edge by having a bike with no brakes. `I like to ride. Fixed gear. No brakes. Can't stop. Don't want to, either.' He has finished law school but has put off taking his bar exam because he can't face the idea of living behind a desk in a boring job. He works for a courier service run by Raj (Aasif Mandvi) along with his girlfriend Vanessa (Dania Ramirez) and a rather wild lad Manny (Wol Parks, excellent!)On this day, Wilee has a delivery that is so valuable that a corrupt NYC Detective Bobby Monday (Michael Shannon), who needs the money, begins to chase Wilee throughout the city to get it before the envelope is delivered. The plot includes Vanessa's roommate Nima (Jamie Chung) who is in the throes of attempting to payoff the Chinese cartel in order to allow her young son to be brought into the country. The plot twists and turns are managed by frequent flashback episodes they explain the path of events that occur as crises. The supporting cast is strong- the NYPD bike cop (Christopher Chance) and the crew of Chinese actors who clutter the den of the Pai Gow players where the action comes to a head.

This is an entertainment movie with some clever cinematic devices and a lot of comment about our present state of communication and law enforcement and immigration problems.  Gordon-Levitt shines and Michael Shannon gives us a repulsively sicko bad cop in full bloom. Grady Harp, December 12",1356134400,,2051,4.723463687150838

I'd compare this movie experience with Crank, such that it's got a decent plot but the cinematography, action, and humor more than make up for it. Definitely worth a rental if not a purchase, and I'd suggest blu-ray to make the most of the action-packed scenes.",1355788800,,612,4.666666666666667

Gordon is slowly becoming my favorite kind of guy. He's growing into his big head quite nice and in this movie with a lot of his wonderful sarcasm and leg shots, I was clearly enjoying myself twenty minutes in the movie.

And amazingly the movie got better after that.

5352561,4,B009MO5E10,"Action-thriller made watchable by a very personable Joseph Gordon Levitt, whose confident presence bolsters the plain unadorned screenplay.

Not as freshly revealing as its<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kevin-Bacon-predecessor/dp/B00006S4O5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kevin Bacon predecessor</a>, but superior to many others cut from the same or similar bit of creative cloth.

Bike messengers, while seemingly an anachronism displaced from history, is in fact a cottage industry that survived the digital revolution. Despite email, secure servers and PDFs - there are still things that require point-to-point hand delivery. Legal documents for the most part, but includes many other items that cannot wait or be trusted to the mail service. Primarily employing young people who live for speed - the premium rush - they skillfully dodge and wind their way through New York City's notoriously congested traffic; and are the go-to service when it absolutely has to get there without delay.

Levitt plays Wiley, as in the funny toon coyote, and is quite possibly the best messenger currently rolling on two wheels. He's certainly the most daring. To the admiration of some, to the jealous chagrin of others: The young man doesn't utilize a brake system. His bike is two wheels and an alloy frame. That's it. He never stops.

Chosen by an old friend from college to make a very special delivery. One that has terrible ramifications should he fail his assignment.

And seeing to it that he does fail is a desperate and dirty cop. Neck deep into the Tongs, cold-blooded and ruthless Chinese gangs with ties back to the old country, he needs what the delivery dude is carrying and is willing to break every law and every bone in Wiley's body to get it.

As the cop and Wiley employ increasingly clever and viciously improvised tactics from their particular bag of tricks - the stakes of their street battle becomes higher and more dangerous. People start to get hurt. The pair pull out all the stops when it becomes clear that blood will flow regardless of the outcome.

JGL is certainly making a splash these past two years, headlining in no less than five major productions - a sure sign that Hollywood is prepping him for much bigger things.

Good.

Looking forward to seeing more of the actor.

Movie Notes:

- One of a small handful of films that mentions the underground Hawala remittance system. Although frowned upon by the US government, is one of the most widely accepted money transfer processes used around the globe. Estimates, and there aren't any hard numbers, generally put the value at more than half-a-trillion dollars a year exchanging hands through what is essentially an honor system.

- I see from IMDb's listing that JGL's character is listed as ""Wilee"". But since I see and hear that as Willie, I'm going with the official name of the funny injury-prone predator.",1354579200,,2919,5.174097664543525
5352562,4,B009MO5E10,"This movie uses the extreme bike messenger culture of New York as a backdrop for an action/adventure story. So it's mostly a 90-minute chase scene, with a few flashbacks & some plot elements thrown in there.

The extreme bikers are similar to Parkour (PK / Free Running), where they don't stop for anything, do some stunts, etc. It's visually interesting. The plot is a bit of a cliche - Joseph Gordon-Levitt is carrying a package that could take down some dirty cops &/or the Chinese mafia, so he's being chased and hunted.

My other complaint is that it didn't have more bike stunts - they missed some real opportunities here, nothing here was quite as exciting as the Parkour documentaries I've seen. Nonetheless, it did keep my interest. And I think one of the goals was realism, so this is definitely not ""Transporter"" or anything like that.

I wasn't very aware of Joseph Gordon-Levitt until fairly recently (Inception, Batman, etc). He is hitting a really nice stride with his career, and in this movie he completely took on his character, 100% believable.

The style & cinematography reminded me a bit of Danny Boyle's 172 hours (starring James Franco). Crisp and fresh.

So even if the plot was a bit formulaic, I still give it a solid 4 stars because of great acting, eye-popping camera work, and a think-outside-the-box premise. I'm pretty sick of traditional Hollywood action movie, and it's so cool watching an ""under the radar"" flick like this provide as many thrills as a Blockbuster Bond movie.

Wilee likes to ride and is reckless. Once we get some quick character introductions, Wilee has to pick up a message from Nima...a premium rush, and deliver it in China Town. There is a policeman (Michael Shannon) with a gambling debt that is attempting to intercept the message.

The plot is straight forward with no twists. Most of the film is bike riding. The film starts out as a flashback and then gives us flashbacks within the flashback to explain plot points. I was rather bored with the whole film, but this might have a younger audience appeal.

I though, how good can a movie about a guy who rides a bike be? While this is not amazing it is a pretty tense and exciting action movie. The race scenes are fun to watch and seeing how Wilee comes up with his routes is interesting to see.
