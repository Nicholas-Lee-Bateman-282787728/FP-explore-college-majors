8004170,3,B0000WUQRA,"Shon Harris materials are an excellent training resource. Highly recommended, but for this video package, I learned a very expensive lesson after purchasing. Unlike a school book that you may resell as used after class, Shon Harris (Logical Security) End User License Agreement (EULA), does not permit you to resell as used or even un-used, nor give it away, nor rent, or lease it; they only allow you to distroy it. In short - you're about to pay a very expensive fee with no authorized way of recovering any partial investment. Now that I'm done with the CISSP, I tried offering through eBay my used original DVD package, Logical Security contacted eBay and removed the ad. That's when I became aware of this situation. Just wanted to provide others a heads up before they step into the same situation. Stick with the book - better detail in there anyway.",1172275200,13,857,4.758389261744966
8004171,5,B0000WUQRA,"Shon Harris's video is very helpfull to every candidate all over the world. I'm Chinese, but I bought Harris's CISSP All-in-one certification guide (3rd edition) from Amazon.com. I really want to attend this 6-hour, challenging exam, and I have the CCNP, MCSE, A+Ci-Net+ , and CIW associate certificates. But I'm only a college student, I have no working experience, so I do not match the condition required to attend the CISSP exam (it requires about 3 years on-job experience). So I have no choice but admire you guys :( So, study well and pass the exam on your first try!",1105315200,,574,4.75
8004172,4,B0000WUQRA,"I viewed the video that came with the CISSP All-in-One book. It was on Domain 5, Cryptography. I think Shon Harris did a good job in the video, but she seems to repeat the same thing twice or even three times during the lecture. We all know CISSP covers a lot of topics, so I think she could have just say things once, not over and over. Maybe some of you might like it.",1090540800,2,370,4.013513513513513
8004173,5,B0000WUQRA,"But it doesn't stand alone.  In other words, don't expect to just watch these DVDs and pass the test. A good CISSP prep book, like Shon Harris' All In One CISSP, this CISSP DVD Certification Package, and a significant amount of private study will be necessary for proper preparation for a grueling six-hour exam that covers a broad array of knowledge in both computer and physical security. For some, an additional review boot camp experience might be also necessary.
However, this DVD Certification Package is excellent.  It is very well done and will be a big help to those aspiring to attain the CISSP level of security certification. Shon Harris is hard to beat as a CISSP instructor.  She literally ""wrote the book!""",1082419200,7,721,4.845528455284553
