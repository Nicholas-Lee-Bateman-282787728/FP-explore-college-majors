The approach is diametrically the opposite of all other ""get a date"" books. Instead of playing aloof, hard to get or jerky, be confident, direct, and most of all show honest, sincere appreciation. Of course you have to mix it with humor and some of the other things Zan recommends.

Done correctly, the effect is neither the usual squirmy, needy man, NOR the manipulative jerk. It's of a powerful, confident, sincere person who isn't afraid to show his interest and accept the consequences. Women don't meet guys like that, and (according to Zan), they really want to. And it's worked for me, so the proof is in the pudding. It's about being REAL, not manipulative. What a breath of fresh air ... for men, for women; for everyone.

Believe me, you won't regret this.",1328054400,5,830,4.79020979020979

The only good thing I learned from him was how importent it is to have a higher purpose in life which is not women. All the rest of contents in the DVDs is nothing but hot air.

it takes much more then the: smile, wink and romantic guy schtick to have real and solid success with women. His whole stuff seems like it's out of the 1700s and not practical when dealing with modern women today.

He doesn't explain how to have the 'state of mind' of a natural in terms of unconsious energy and that's why all the people I have talked to are not getting any results with his stuff.

Some say that his stuff works great for him and for more 'advanced guys'. Well then, what good is his teachings if he can't help someone who has little or no experience? Not much of a teacher...

If he had said that his stuff is for 'advanced guys' and not Beginners that would be cool. But he doesn't say that & welcomes beginners with open arms or 'palms', as they account for at least 90% of his cashflow.",1321315200,3,1091,4.151658767772512
