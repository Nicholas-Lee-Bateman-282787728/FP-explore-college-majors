2565426,1,B000FH8H7Q,This was the most offensive Disney movie I've ever seen. Half the scenes contain some level of sexual assault. Turned it off held way with no intention of every finishing it. Wish there was a return policy for this.,1510272000,,215,4.538461538461538

2565440,5,B000FH8H7Q,"I watched this movie with my wife for the first time ever about two weeks ago. I'm 32. She had seen it a great number of times growing up, so she knew all the songs. It's a well done movie and worth getting. Kids will love it.

With that said though, being 32, male, and more than a little sarcastic...this story is about two 16 year olds that fall in love and want to get married within a two minute space of time. One is a thumb sized girl and the other is a fairy prince. Once they meet, everything turns bad considering that everyone outside of Thumbelina's house is intent on kidnapping her, marrying her, and breeding her like a prized pony, regardless of what she wants. I pretty much spent the first watch of this movie pointing things like that out, laying on the sarcasm, and then, later that night, sleeping on the couch.

It's a good movie though. I've seen it a few more times since. If you don't have it, I'd recommend getting it.",1490227200,,944,4.297752808988764

It's a really sweat story and the characters are wonderful. I highly recommend it. I haven't tried it on any boys, so, I can't say if it crosses over to both/all genders.

2565488,1,B000FH8H7Q,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it was horrible. I can't believe they marketed it to kids. Rather than being a hero with her own agency and forward motion, Thumbelina herself exists primarily to get passed between male characters. She gets engaged to the fairy prince within five minutes of him breaking into her house, damaging her storybook, waving a sword at her, and then yelling at her for staring at him. If you leave aside the Peeping Tom prince, three (other) sexual predators chase after Thumbelina, but it seems to bother her more if somebody says she's not pretty than when she gets kidnapped and assaulted. (In fact, after getting kidnapped in her nutshell-bed, she apparently has a good night's sleep, wakes disoriented, but is immediately won over by her kinapper's promise to make her a star!) The narcissist bird who is the narrator somehow never thinks to fly her home, even though she could apparently ride double on a bumblebee with the prince, and at one point comforts her with the sage advice that it doesn't matter of the beetles don't think she's pretty as long as the cute guy she's crushing on thinks she's pretty. Also, the racism was atrocious in that ""this was made in 1994, not 1924, what on earth is your excuse??"" kind of way.",1465862400,,1266,4.681614349775785

The whirlwind romance between Prince Cornelius and Thumbelina is compelling and the first song they sing together ""Let me be your wings"" still brings a tear to my eye. Yeah I know that is pretty mushy but it shaped my young mind and that is still what I would like as far as romance. He promises her a future and support in whatever she wants or needs. To me, that song weaves his commitment and strengthens their bond. It is sad for a lot of the movie, but there is a little comic relief in Giacomo the sparrow.

2565574,5,B000FH8H7Q,"I bought the Original Soundtrack of this film because Barbara Cook was featured on it; and I genuinely loved the album. The songs are a perfect blend of Barry Manilow and Broadway (what's not to like?) and the album features Barbara Cook, Carol Channing and Charo all doing songs perfectly suited to their voices and singing styles. As an adult without children, I wasn't surprised that I had missed the film; but I eventually became aware that no one I knew had ever heard of it. So I ordered it just to see why it had been received with such disinterest. To begin with, it's immediately obvious that the animation does not approach the Disney and Pixar standards that people are used to today. But the story is charming and the songs (I would argue) are far more literate and tuneful than most of the animated films I've seen in the past two decades. I suspect that the major problem with the film is that the hero is a handsome young 16 year old who (throughout the film) refers to himself as ""The Fairy Prince."" I can only imagine the howls of derision and catcalls this must have produced from an audience of 'tween's in 1994. The film is more than gay-friendly. The heroine's ballad is a virtual sequel to ""Over the Rainbow"" and the final wedding sequence takes place in front of a rainbow-colored panel that would not be out of place in a Gay Pride Parade. But I would think that  very young children (girls especially...but boys too) who are still young enough to clap their hands if they believe in fairies would thoroughly enjoy this film. And for any Broadway enthusiast  (gay or straight) who loves Barbara Cook and Carol Channing, I would think this film is a must. Unfortunately the Soundtrack is currently out-of-print, but hopefully it will eventually be re-released.",1459555200,,1783,4.6571428571428575

Here's my suggestion - to find out about the original story and it's author, check out Wikipedia and go to IMDB for some decent reviews from the average ""Joe.""  If neither of those options seem appealing to you then you can be a rebel, take a chance and just go ahead and purchase the movie.

2565731,5,B000FH8H7Q,"A lush production by the noted non-Disney animation impresario Don Bluth. The musical numbers are excellent and relevant to the story. Fine soundtrack adds to the drama.

It's bit of a period piece, only in that political correctness had not spoiled Bluth's lively adaptation of Andersen's storyline. Thumbelina is allowed to dream of a life in fairyland, and despite failing to establish herself as a clichd, steel-willed Disney heroine, is quite a likeable character, pursuing her dream with unflagging will. Her travails center around her being compelled to perform, finding her way in a hostile world, and fending off the unwelcome attention and connivances of a leering toad, beetle, mole etc.so, not too much unlike real life, then. There is plenty of action, thrills, and slapstick for the kiddies.

There's an over-the-top depiction of Mexican toads, with an incredible Charo-esque toad matriarch, and a Maurice Chevalier-channeling swallow. Only wince-inducing to the PC crowd.

Lovely old-school animation, much more dynamic in action and theatrical expressiveness than anything Disney made after 1953. Detailed backgrounds and vivid palettes add to the lush visuals.",1430784000,,1177,5.527777777777778

2565787,4,B000FH8H7Q,"This might be my biggest ""guilty pleasure"" movie. Except I don't feel guilty for liking this. I will proudly tell everyone I know that, yes, I'm 26 with no kids, I watch intelligent movies like ""Casablanca"" and ""Blade Runner,"" and I also love ""Thumbelina."" And not just for nostalgic reasons. Yes, this movie is part of my childhood, but I mostly lost interest in it after age eight, until my mom got me the DVD when I was in college, a Hanukkah gag gift. Re-discovering it, I realized that this movie is fun even for an adult (with certain tastes).

Is it a ""good"" movie? For what it is, yes. ""Thumbelina"" isn't trying to be a true family film, that appeals to everyone; it's clearly meant for very young girls, and never pretends otherwise. If adults like this movie, it's almost certainly because it appeals to their child-like and/or girly side. The supporting characters are over the top in their cartoonishness; the scenery barfs glitter and sparkles almost more than ""Labyrinth;"" and most of the characters have the mental maturity of seven-year-olds. People probably love and hate this movie, for precisely those reasons.

Flaws? A lot of the supporting characters will really irritate anyone over age nine. (How annoying are they? One of them is voiced by Gilbert Gotfried.) Some of the songs are pretty painful (""Marry the Mole"" actually won an award for being the worst musical number in an animated feater.) And the stupidity of the main characters will infuriate anyone looking for logic in this story. (The swallow can't carry Thumbelina on his back when she's drowning, or trekking for months to find her way home, but he can suddenly be her chauffeur at the end when she needs to meet up with the Fairy Prince. WHY?)

Strengths? The animation is lovely. Many of the characters are cute and sympathetic, and their stupidity is forgivable (with them being fairies, animals, or old ladies). Some of the songs are beautiful, especially ""Let Me Be Your Wings."" And how about the fact that someone actually decided to adapt a fairy tale that *isn't* Grimm. (The original ""Thumbelina"" is by Hans Christian Anderson, author of ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""The Snow Queen,"" and ""the Tin Soldier."") I for one am getting sick of seeing the same few fairy tales retold over and over (""Snow White,"" ""Cinderella,"" ""Red Riding Hood,"" ""Jack and the Beanstalk""....) I don't mind seeing an Andersen or Arabian Nights tale once in a while.

VERDICT:
If you have a daughter age seven or under, you might consider buying this movie for her. If you have a penchant for corny, fairy tale cartoons like ""Swan Princess"" and ""Snow White,"" consider watching (or re-watching) ""Thumbelina.""",1418342400,,2671,4.863736263736263

After a day or two curiosity got the better of me and I watched the tape; I was blown away and would keep watching it again and again.  The movie does have a lot of action and there are few moments where it will tug at your heart strings. This film ended up being one of my first lessons of not judging a book by it's cover or in this case a movie by it's box art.

There are a few moments in the movie that may scare some viewers, but it is still a great movie.

My only gripe that I have is that I found out that the movie is actually an anime series that consists of 26 episodes; when series was edited for American viewers it was reduced into this movie.  Which leaves me wishing I could find the original series with an English dubbing or subbing so I can see Maya and Noble's entire journey to the land of south.

It's a shame to give this movie two stars as it is hand drawn and must have taken a ton of work to produce.  Some very nice backdrops and decent animation.

So far as the story goes, this is definitely childish.  Characters act in unrealistic ways.  Why is everyone obsessed with dancing and singing?  What do rats and moles care about money?  The mother wasn't phased at all when a tiny woman emerged from her plant's flower.  The character dialogue was very childish.

The worst thing about this movie was the bad message it sends girls.  Thumbalina's main purpose in life was to get married and be pretty.  She was distraught when a beetle called her ugly and once someone called her pretty, she was all happy again.  She was pretty much air-headed and floundered around, barely able to walk.  No innovation when it came to getting out of scrapes.  She just said ""I give up, it's impossible.""  She was manipulated by whoever was around her, singing and dancing around to their whims.  Throughout, all the little bugs and critters were trying to court her.  It seemed to archaic to hear a song about how she should marry for money, and she almost goes through with it, saying ""he would be able to take care of me.""  Talk about the perfect image of the helpless woman.

To give the movie credit, it was probably produced in a time when a woman's main goal was to get married, and female independence wasn't so prevalent.  But even though it's not the movie's fault for it's time period, the movie didn't have enough going on in other areas for me to still enjoy it.

I did not much care for the artwork style of many of the characters.  They were a bit cheesy: The huge boots on the bird, the googly faces of the child insects, the old-style cartoon look in general.  However, the fairies were pretty cool.  I suppose it's up to personal opinion though.

I definitely would not recommend watching this movie unless you like childish things and don't care about quality story or characters.  There are plenty of other cartoons out there that have a little more brainwork involved in their dialogue and I can happily sit through them.

2565894,4,B000FH8H7Q,"While on vacation earlier this year, my daughter discovered `Thumbelina', and every time we were waiting for her sister to awaken from her nap so that we could get back on the beach, we watched this movie.  EVERY DAY FOR AN ENTIRE WEEK!  Yes, it is a bit of overkill and enough to drive any sane parent absolutely crazy.  I tried to get her to watch something different, but the idea of a fairy Prince Charming and a little girl who gets to practically become a fairy was too much for her to ignore.  She had to see it over and over again because it basically encapsulated all of her life long ambitions.

Yes, she is five and yes, she wants to be a fairy.

`Thumbelina', which is adapted from the famous Hans Christian Anderson fairytale, tells the story of a little girl born out of a flower who is no bigger than your thumb (thus her name).  She is depressed that there is no one else her size, but that all changes when she meets Prince Cornelius, a fairy who just so happens to be her size!  No sooner do the two fall in love, Thumbelina is kidnapped by Mrs. Toad and basically spends the rest of the film in some sort of slavery in exchange for whatever little help she can get to return to her beloved.  Eventually all is right and Thumbelina is reunited with her Prince, but getting there is quite the journey.

For me, this has some major pluses and minuses.  The musical arrangements and songs, produced by none other than Barry Manilow, are beautifully composed and are as good as some Disney classics.  The spirit of the film is also quite nice, and the balance of tension and romantic splendor works well.  My main issue comes from this permeating air of selfishness and cruelty.  The fact that nearly everyone poor Thumbelina meets merely wants to take advantage of her is not a great thing to promote or browbeat our children with.  It's a sad message and takes away from the story (although I am aware that it is a big part of the story itself).  I just didn't like that message.

Still, the film as a whole is fine and has great moments.  My daughter loves it (obviously) and that is always the most important factor.  Thankfully she has conceded to watching other things as well.",1376611200,,2197,4.420398009950249

I felt compelled to help some people by deciding if the blu ray version of this movie is right for them. Let start by saying that I collect all of Don Bluth animated classics, but whatever opinion you have about the movie itself, I respect. Not everyone can be pleased by the story-line selected by a director on any of old times classic tales. But as a collector that buys the blu  blu ray versions of such tales, I expect that at least some special restoration is done in the video transfer to be worth the upgrade. Well that restoration is non existent in any of the Don Bluth movies. The only movie that is an exception is Anastasia. Other than that, they all deserve ONE STAR for video restoration.

As for this great tail, it is a refreshing story of love and innocence even to the point that the antagonists were tame and truly adorable.  I miss watching something with the family (wife and two small kids) that I could truly say had no subliminal messages or double entendre.

Musically, it was  a pleasant surprise to find out that Barry Manilow was in charge of all the music.  Perhaps I'm out of the loop, but this was my first experience with his music covering an entire movie.

Although it is a very cute film , i think small children will enjoy this best [Like Disney's Snow White  these films small children

2565956,4,B000FH8H7Q,"When I remembered this movie, I couldn't help but to recall how strange it was for a Don Bluth film. In his other movies Don Bluth has never hesitated to scare children. His movies are great but lets not forget that they have been known to have really scary characters and climax. Note: the T-rex in Land Before Time, Rasputin in Anastasia, and scene in All Dogs Go To Heaven were Charlie has a nightmare were he has been damned to the realm of burning hell. Yet when I remember this one, I didn't remember anything scary. in fact I didn't ever remember there being a scene when things turn that bad. I believed it seems to maintain a ""Kids movie"" label.
  So I bought and watched it. And I will admit in the beginning I thought I was right. It did seem like something that was created for only kids, (mainly girls) nothing more. But then I kept watching and I heard some quotes that caught my attention and made me wonder if there was something else to this movie that were not seeing.

  **Spoiler Alert**

  In the beginning see shows us her innocence and wish to be loved by someone just right for her. Very traditional. She cant to notice that she is very tiny, and has seen anyone who matches her size. She is different. In the beginning she asks her mother if they is anyone in this world her is like not, and because there is not, she wishes to be bigger. Her mother tells her not to wish to be anything other than who she is. This made me think back to all the young girls of the real world, who also wish to be something there not. Skinny, Tall, or ""pretty."" I think its important for not just young girls, but all people of all genders to accept there difference, and learn to love themselves.
  There is also a part where after she was been used multiple times by greedy people (or err...rodents) she says, ""there is no place in this big world for little people."" There are people in this world who will see someone who is pretty and talented and used that to their own advantage. In fact the victim doesn't have to be pretty, but very vulnerable and naive. There are little people who won't be able to protect themselves by the evil of others. There are liers who will promise to give money, or maybe make you famous, but you may not realize it till afterwards what there true intentions are.
  And one more thing she says which i'm still trying to understand. ""Winter has killed everything, including the sun."" She then even sings a song about it. And then says the quote again. And if a character says something more then once, and/or sings about it, it must mean something. In this movie winter is symbolic of something, whither it is time, loss love, or maybe the greedy people. It kills everything, including the sun, which I've always known to be symbolic of hope.
  So I actually do think Don Bluth keeps his tradition of taking a darker route in this movie, but this time he did it in a different way. I think maybe he wanted to create an evil that is reflective of motives of real people. Maybe he wanted to tell a story that warns us about a danger in this world that is deeper than just a scary face. Maybe he wants to tell us that compared to the world we are all ""Little People"" and this is a big world for us. Full of things that can makes us happy, as long as things that will use us for their own gain. And eventually we need to say no and not allow us to been taken advantage of. We have to have a say in our own life.

 So in conclusion, it SEEMS like something made for little girls, but I think only if you listen to what is said, you can understand what seems to fall on deaf ears. The story of Thumbelina, a little girl in a big world, a world with both beautiful people, and those with their own motives.",1335484800,,3740,4.253878702397743

2565969,4,B000FH8H7Q,"The story of Thumbelina was originally a fairy tale by Hans Christian Anderson. It's the story of a thumb- sized girl and her adventures in life and love. The film begins with an old woman. The woman is lonely and has always wanted a child of her own, and one day a fairy grants her wish and gives her a small seed. The old woman plants the seed and kisses it when it's ready to bloom, and inside she finds a tiny girl no bigger than her thumb, whom she then calls Thumbelina. Thumbelina is quite contented with her life on the old woman's farm. She tries to help out with chores, but only seems to her herself into scrapes whenever she tries to help. She loves her mother though and is happy. One night, Thumbelina is singing to herself in her room when, as chance would have it, the prince of the fairies flies by her bedroom window and is enchanted by her voice. He takes her for a ride on his pet bumblebee and they sing and fall in love. He then returns her to her room with the promise of returning. On that romantic ride through the meadow, a frog over hears Thumbelina singing and thinks to herself that this small girl would make a great addition to their travelling show and would make her son a good wife. So she kidnaps her that very night while Thumbelina slept, before the prince could come back to marry her. When Thumbelina awakes and discovers what the frogs have planned for her she runs away from them and tries to make her way back home, but being so small she can't see above the grass. The frog whom she escaped from is hot on her tail so quickly makes her way through the company of various bugs and birds and rodents who both try to help her and try to capture her. In the end the swallow, who also is the narrator of the story, helps her find her way to the vale of the fairies, where she hopes to find her prince.  They end up getting married  and Thumbelina grows a pair of wings to match her prince's and they all live happily ever after.

I liked this movie a lot when I was a kid. I'd sing the songs with my cousin when we watched the movie together, though apparently according to Wikipedia the `marry the mole' song won the worst original song award. I remember feeling kind of awkward that all of these creepy guys wanted to marry Thumbelina and I guess that sort of took away from the movie a bit for me, but overall the memories are pleasant. Thumbelina isn't a strong character by any means, she sort of just gets tossed around by fate and always needs rescuing. The prince also isn't any knight in shining armour. He acts as a boy would, shirking responsibilities and spouting idealism without having anything to back it up. The villains are also kind of one-dimensional in their drive to get Thumbelina. Besides being struck by her voice, which isn't enough to make someone fall in love, there isn't really anything substantial in their desire to marry her. Besides a few character flaws however, this really is a sweet film. The songs are catchy, I like the animation, and the story is adventurous with a kiss at the end, short, sweet, and nostalgic.",1285977600,,3089,4.359375
2565970,5,B000FH8H7Q,I have loved this movie since I was a very little girl and saw it for the first time.  It has an interesting story and funny characters.  The music is even good.  I recently bought it for my daughters so they can watch movies I liked as a kid.,1285372800,,243,3.9183673469387754
2565971,4,B000FH8H7Q,"I absolutely loved this movie when I was younger. I still like it now. I'll try not to give away too much on this review. Well, here goes:

Thumbelina is not your tough, smart-mouthed ""spunky"" sort of girl. She's sweet, and sheltered, and seems to be the only one of her size in the whole world. She loves her mother very much, but is lonely. On the night her dissatisfaction with this comes to a head, she meets the fairy prince, who is charmed by her shy beauty and lovely singing voice. They fall heavily in like to the tune of the very pretty ""Let Me Be Your Wings"" and he wants her to meet his parents.

Before this can happen Thumbelina is kidnapped, being prized for her singing talent, by a group of musical performing toads. Her escape is assisted by various friendly animals/insects but she's trailed by the toads (among other creatures), and the frightened girl tries to make it home, nearly freezing in the coming winter.

Thumbelina, never having known what was in the world or what its creatures might think of her, is bewildered but optimistic, occasionally feeling hopeless but always getting back up to try again to make it home. She does learn to accept herself as she is, and stand up for herself to those who want to control her life (even if her only option is to run away from those trying to domineer her). In the end she is reunited with her mother and *SPOILER* marries the prince who loved her just as she was (but probably neither of them complained when *SPOILERx2* she gets her own wings).

Some commentators have the complaint that Thumbelina is weak, and lets herself be walked over. I gently remind them this movie came out before ""spunky"" was in, and that Thumbelina is, again, very sheltered, amiable and compassionate (the latter two being attributes it won't hurt children to see as being good traits to have). And eventually the girl does decide to take her life into her own hands and *SPOILERx3* escape an unwanted marriage she felt obligated to because of the help she received by the would-be groom and his friend. She is assisted by others, being way out of her comfort zone, but since when is getting a little help a bad thing?

Another good thing is the subtle point, in the form of a conversation with the sparrow, that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and if you and those you love are perfectly happy with who you are and what you look like, don't care so much about what others think.

No character death (though it looks like there is at two points, but the sparrow is not dead, merely unconscious, and the prince frozen in ice), no blood or bad words. Overall, it's a sweet movie suitable to younger girls who like stories about fairies, music, and friendship, with good triumphing over--well, not evil, but certainly villainous creatures determined to get their own way. I deducted a star merely because the stupid beetle creeps me out, I really hate bugs. Hope this helps. : )",1281657600,,2933,4.555977229601518
2565972,1,B000FH8H7Q,"The main character is a moron. The songs are dreadful. The animation, though, was good.

I swear, I could never, ever sit through this movie again. If I had to listen to those chickens screech out THUMBELINA! just one more time, I know I'd go postal.

One of the worst animated films I've ever seen.",1276646400,,299,4.418181818181818
2565973,2,B000FH8H7Q,"I regret watching this animated film.

As a child, Thumbelina was one of my favorite heroines. She was strong and curious and took care of others. Disney's Thumbelina is codependent on a guy she barely knows and meets the same day, she is afraid to go out and find her way back to who she is and what she loves, she is ditsy and silly.

At one point, Miss Mouse, a field mice who takes in Thumbelina away from the cold, tells Thumbelina that she has an itsy-bitsy brain. Indeed, the heroine of this movie is anything but heroic - she can't figure out to help her friend swallow, she is helpless and is afraid to leave the toad and the beetle who force her into situations she doesn't want to be in.

The main reoccurring theme of the movie is sung by the swallow, who also serves as a narrator for the story. He says you don't need an education (to learn math or science), you just have to follow your heart. What kind of productive lesson is that?

Moreover, the only lesson that's worth teaching to kids - Thumbelina's mother smartly states that Thumbelina must not desire to be anything but what she is and should be proud to be herself - is glanced over and barely gets a minute's notice.",1274313600,,1192,4.331838565022421
2565974,4,B000FH8H7Q,"My 5-year-old daughter who loves fairy tales loves to watch this animated feature of the classic fairy tale Thumbelina. We've had this DVD since she was three but she loves this movie and always enjoys a repeat viewing. The animation is actually quite well-done, perhaps not as polished as some of Disney's animated offerings, but certainly not shoddy either.

Thumbelina is beautifully-rendered in this animated feature, she is lovely and fragile and her fairy prince Cornelius is suitably dashing! Thumbelina goes through many adventures and trials in this feature - getting kidnapped by a family of toads, only to be rescued by a chivalrous swallow, but she ends up in other precarious situations. The songs are suitably amusing, but not exactly memorable. However, to a 5-year-old, these little flaws did not seem to matter. Unlike some reviewers who found Thumbelina's characterization unappealing, I felt her character grew as the story progressed - from a naive and frightened young girl to one who is more aware and sure of herself as the story comes to an end. Final verdict - an above average, beautifully-animated adaptation of a classic fairy tale that is sure to fascinate young children (and dare I say, some adults!).",1272153600,,1232,5.099009900990099

Although the animation itself is good, the plot and storyline are horrible and truly boring.  To add insult, the title character of Thumbelina is made to be a weak, sniveling, pathetic excuse of a girl.  Throughout the film, my daughters and I came up with ways that Thumbelina could get herself out of the situation if she would just think about it.  Furthermore, although she is put into bad situations over and over again, only once does she actually have the gumption to say ""NO"".  Very annoying.  We will be ""losing"" this film ASAP as this is not a character I want my children modeling themselves after.

2565983,4,B000FH8H7Q,"THUMBELINA, Don Bluth's 1994 animated musical fairytale, was unfortunate in that it opened the same year as Disney's ""The Lion King"", a film which stormed the box office and took attention away from any other animated offering for that whole season (""The Swan Princess"", another non-Disney feature also fell heavily at the 1994 box office but quickly recouped it's losses in home video sales and with two subsequent straight-to-video sequels).

Despite lukewarm reviews--and a highly undeserved Razzie Award--THUMBELINA comes to life with soaring Barry Manilow musical numbers (""Soon"", ""Let Me Be Your Wings"") and a fantastic voice cast including Jodi Benson (""The Little Mermaid"") as Thumbelina and the superbly talented Gary Imhoff as Prince Cornelius--what a singing voice!

It's a movie that has only gotten better since it's original release, because only in hindsight (with safe distance from ""Lion King"" mania) can we now fully appreciate the delicate story of one small girl's quest to find true love and her unique place in the world.  A true animation classic in my book!",1250294400,,1081,5.273255813953488

2565995,5,B000FH8H7Q,"Thumbelina is a wonderful movie based off Hans Christian Anderson's tale, no improvisions. My mother bought me the tape when I was 6 years old, and I was immediately blown away by it! It was a heart-moving tale about a tiny girl in a big world who gets kidnapped by singing toads and journeys to find her way home. Thumbelina also gains courage, and finds friendship and love along the way. Especially when she falls in love with the Fairy Prince Cornelious.

I was also very touched by the mother-daughter love expressed between Thumbelina and her mother. The old woman wanted a child for so long and was so happy she received Thumbelina in a flower and loved her with all her heart. The pain the two of them suffered of missing each other when Thumbelina was kidnapped. It would make me cry a lot. It's like the bond me and my mother shared.

Another thing that I loved about Thumbelina was that it had a mixture of action, drama, and comical moments along with romance, which makes it perfect for kids and adults. The songs were another part I loved! They were so much fun to sing to, I would sing them all the time, even now at age 20 I still do sometimes! lol My favorite songs were ""Let me be your wings"" and ""Soon.""

Thumbelina is one of teh best films ever, even now as a young adult, it is still an enjoying part of my life. I highly recommend this because it is not a kids movie only.  It is a classic tale with a moral that we all need to follow.  No matter what size you are, there is no limit to what you can do, as long as you have faith in yourself.

2566005,4,B000FH8H7Q,"I've had this movie on video for years now. I remember watching it as a child and enjoying it so much, I didn't care that the film barely resembles the story of Thumbelina at all. Recently, I managed to find the one copy of this movie Wal Mart had in their one dollar DVD bin. I snatched it up, and just yesterday, I finally watched it. It's as cute as I remember.

The film tells the story of a young girl named Mia. Mia is a troublemaker, and desperate to change her behavior, her mother visits a good witch. The witch gives her a book - Thumbelina. For the spell to work, Mia must become interested in the book and have her mother read it to her. While reading it, her mother falls asleep. Suddenly, Mia shrinks into a two-inch tall creature and is transported to The Land of Her Mother's Dreams. Mia must now go to The Land of South and get the Crystal Prince to wake her mother up so she can re-enter her own world. She is helped by a good witch named Angela, who gives her a pair of magical red shoes and a pendant which helps Mia direct her own personal power. Mia also befriends Noble The Sugar Fairy and Hoppy, the toad who's parents try to force her to marry. She also makes friends with a kindly field mouse named Aunt Ruth and a kind swallow. However, she must also face her enemy, the wicked witch Cassandra.

For a cheaply made budget DVD, this one's actually quite good. The movie is likely sourced from the same VHS video I have, or even more likely, maybe that VHS's higher-quality source. The colors are just a tiny bit washed out at times, and it's a bit grainy, but otherwise, it's a very clean transfer. The sound mix is also quite nicely done. The menus contain animation and good design and the movie's theme song plays over them. Not bad for a cheap DVD job.

If you find this at your local dollar/cheap-o store or Wal Mart or the like, please don't hesitate to snatch this one up. It can be pretty hard to find, so don't let the opportunity to own this pass you by.",1170979200,,1990,4.245382585751979

If you like Disney style classics, (Sleeping Beauty, Aladdin.. etc..) you'll love Thumbelina. At 16 years old, I love it even better than when I used to watch it as a little girl and hum along with the songs. Speaking of the songs, I adore the music! Let Me Be Your Wings is so sweet, I would buy the DVD if only for that scene and song which replays in a few reprises throughout the movie. The other songs are also catchy, and although not as pretty, I dare you to listen to Jacquimo the sparrow's song, ""Follow Your Heart"" and not hum it to yourself the rest of the day. ;) I highly reccommend this movie to anyone with a love for Fairy Tales and good, clean romance.",1168560000,,983,4.406593406593407

Who says animation has to be top-notch in order for the movie to be good? And the music is great, too. Even ""Marry the Mole"" is not such a bad song.

2566020,5,B000FH8H7Q,"Don Bluth's Thumbelina is an inspiring story with gorgeous animation. Bluth, creator of The Secret of NIMH, An American Tail, and The Land Before Time, as well as many other amazing animated films, got his start at Disney.  Bluth then started his own production company.  Right now, in 2005, his company is no more, but Bluth has left a tremendous body of works that will be enjoyed for generations.

Bluth's retelling of the Grimm Brothers fairy tale Thumbelina is enchanting.  Thumbelina (voiced by Jodi Benson)is innocent and naiive; if adults can remember when they were that way too, once upon a time, it will enhance their enjoyment of the film.  Thumbelina lives with her mother.  She is lonely for a friend her own size.  One fateful moonlit night, she meets the Fairy Prince Cornelius, and falls in love.  Unfortunately, Thumbelina is kidnapped by Mama Toad (Charro) to be a singer in her troupe, and a wife for her horrible toad son.

Throughout her difficult journey and separation from her home, other well-meaning creatures try to tell Thumbelina what she should do and who she should be.  Everyone wants to control her; no one wants to let her find her own path.  Her only faithful friend is the charming Parisian swallow, Jacqimo, who gently encourages Thumbelina to never give up and follow her heart.  Staying true to yourself and not caving in to the pressure of what others think you should do, and what they think is best for you, is difficult to do.  This movie will strengthen anyone's resolve to resist anyone else trying to make them into something they don't feel they are meant to be.

The opening scenes of the swallow's flight high over Paris is breathtaking.  Barry Manilow's songs are wonderful, absolutely wonderful.  ""Let Me Be Your Wings"" is as good as Aladdin's ""A Whole New World.""  The ending credits have charming montages of the characters, so watch the credits roll to the very end.",1126483200,,1921,4.807926829268292
2566021,4,B000FH8H7Q,"Lovely animated musical version of THUMBELINA featuring a fantastic score by Barry Manilow and the well-executed animation style of Don Bluth.

Tiny Thumbelina's peaceful life with her mother is enlivened by her chance encounter with Cornelius, Prince of the Fairies.  They quickly fall in love when the thumb-sized waif is kidnapped by overzealous Mrs Toad as a prospective new bride for her oldest son. She escapes only to find herself hoplessly lost in a big big world.  Salvation comes in the form of the kindly Mrs Field Mouse who offers Thumbelina a warm home during the bitter frost.  However even the Field Mouse expects something in return, so Thumblina is forced to marry her neighbour Mr Mole.  At the 11th hour Thumbelina escapes with the help of Jacquimo, a swallow that she saved from death, who reunites her with Prince Cornelius and her mother.

This film features lush animation from Don Bluth.  As other reviewers have noted, the woodland scenes and characters are reminiscent of Bluth's masterwork THE SECRET OF NIMH.  The human characters are beautifully-drawn.

Jodi Benson, who also voiced Disney's LITTLE MERMAID, is perfect in the role of Thumbelina.  Broadway veteran Barbara Cook plays Thumbelina's mother.  The other roles are voiced by Carol Channing (Mrs Field Mouse), Charo (Mrs Toad), John Hurt (Mr Mole), Gary Imhoff (Prince Cornelius), Gino Conforti (Jacquimo), June Foray (Queen) and Kenneth Mars (King).

Barry Manilow offers a score of lovely Broadway-styled songs including Thumbelina's soaring ballad ""Soon"", Mrs Field Mouse's pleading ""Marry the Mole"", Mrs Toad's rousing showbiz anthem ""On the Road"" and Jacquimo's inspirational ""If You Follow Your Heart"".",1123200000,,1696,5.310861423220974
2566022,5,B000FH8H7Q,"Many adults have awarded this film a low rating based upon their own expectations of a film.  They are appalled at the film's quick pace, overly bright colors, and saccharine music.  What they must remember is that adults are not this film's target audience.  Children have short attention spans, are attracted to bright colors, and appreciate catchy tunes.

  I will admit that this film is not made with adults in mind in the way that ""The Lion King"" or ""All Dogs Go to Heaven"" are.  There are very few jokes and references that will go over children's heads (although they might not appreciate seeing an animated Charo as much as their parent's will!)  If adults are willing to place themselves in a childlike mindset, they should enjoy this film.  But the true measure of the film is how many reviews say, ""It's my child's favorite movie!""

  If you are looking for a film to enjoy on a Saturday night with your significant other, skip this one.  But if you're looking for a film that will delight your children and quickly become a favorite, I highly recommend this film!",1118620800,,1076,4.659574468085107
2566023,3,B000FH8H7Q,"This movie was really pretty good.  It was a typical Don Bluth.  I liked it.  BUT--BUT--and again, BUT!--I cannot stand idly by while these empty-headed yahoos have their say about this movie's animation!

  I would first like to say that I DO know something about animation. NO, I'm not an animator, but that's my dream.  I have watched many movies in my quest to figure out how to make a good movie using animation.  I have come to the conclusion that the public in gemeral has NO CLUE what really good animation is.  This movie's reviews have convinced me for certain.  For example, the reviewers on this have complained of ""dated animation"".  The only thing dated about it is that it's GOOD, unlike the other trash being made in the U.S. these days (Pixar excluded).  You can say what you like about the drawings--some of them are pretty weird-looking--but guess what?  THE DRAWING IS NOT THE ANIMATION, FOLKS!  See, this is what the general public doesn't understand.  If you just look at the ACTION, not the DRAWINGS, then you're really seeing the animation.  Do you see what I'm saying?  Okay, put a blank mask over the figures in your mind; imagine stick figures.  Just don't pay attention to the design or drawing.  Then you'll see the beauty of the movement in there.  Try it; I can't explain it that well.  Let's see... Just, if they were stick figures, but still moving the same, you could see the motion and get what I mean by ""good animation"".  Compare that to the runs on 8s and 12s in many 2D stuff (seen pokemon lately?  how 'bout Yu-Gi-Oh!--which is a bunch of talking heads with no different mouth positions?). This just puts that completely to shame.  It just isn't FAIR!  don Bluth's just TOO good!  Let me be that good someday, PLEASE...

  Also, on the scruples about the romance, I'd like to point out that it's a lot better than, say, Snow White's (as wonderfully animated, scored, and characterized as that movie was!, the romance was a fairy tale one).  I mean, at least Thumbelina and Cornelius MET! It's strangeness, I'm sure, comes straight from the Hans Christian Anderson story.  Anyone read the ORIGINAL Little Mermaid?  Or Steadfast Tin Soldier?  Guess what?  In both cases, the main character(s) DIE!  Did YOU know that, in the fairy tale, Ariel was GOING to kill Eric so she'd live, but then decided to ""become the foam upon the waves""?  Well, she was, and she did actually ""become the foam u[pon the waves"".  However, in the DISNEY movie, everyone lived happily ever after, and Ariel was a selfish brat--""You know, I saw this guy I kind of liked the look of, so I'll just endanger my entire kingdom and him so I can go be smoochy."" Thumbelina was a good, innocent, nice character.

  The music was really good, too.  The songs were funny when they were supposed to be, and the others were lovely. The singing wasn't even too vibrato or inhaler-y, and they managed to keep the horrid, ghastly, synthesized pop-version of ""Let Me Be Your Wings"" until the end of the credits, so that many of us wouldn't have to be subjected to it.  All-around good music.  Actually, I, the Anti-Romantic (as I've been dubbed) really enjoyed ""Let Me Be Your Wings"", and had it stuck in my head for the next few days and DIDN'T MIND IT!  How impressive is that?

  All in all, I really liked this movie. I would recommend it if you enoy animation or animated movies.  If you like blood and gore and swearing and other idiocy like that, I wouldn't suggest watching it.  (I WOULD suggest going and finding a brick wall to bang your seriously messed-up head against, but, hey...)",1111881600,,3592,4.6075949367088604
2566024,2,B000FH8H7Q,"I was babysitting when I saw a copy of this movie in the very, very back of the kids' movie shelf.  I grabbed it and thought to myself, ""Hey! Why is this in the very back?  I used to love this movie when I was a kid!""  I eagerly turned it on, expecting to be filled with a nostaligic feeling enjoying the movie...

But boy, was I ever wrong!  I can see now why they had that movie in the very back, hidden away from all eyes so that no one will have to suffer sitting through it.  The movie was fake and way too fast.  Think about it, the beginning Thumbelina is wishing how she can find a love, then by some strange coincidence Cornilious appears who just happens to be the prince, who just happens to fall in love with Thumbelina.  Then you see the two of them go on this flying ride (I found myself comparing it with Disney's Aladdin's flying carpet scene) on a bumblebee and they sing how much in love they are, and are practically engaged by the end of the night.  So...they spent what, not even an hour together before ""falling in love""?  Sheesh...is that a sign of laziness or rush?

The animation got to me, was it really that bad?  When I was a kid I didn't remember it being that bad.  I think you'll notice it the most the scene after the little ""Bumblebee"" ride when Thumbelina looks up longingly after her prince...you can tell that the artists were really going for a delicate, graceful, soft feeling there, but...it just came off as tried-too-hard-and-didn't-work-out.

I was going to give this movie a one-star review, but I can't deny that when I was a kid I used to love this movie...this is an example of how kids view things differently, a lot of reviewers reviewing this movie are saying ""My kid loved it.""  Okay...well...how come none of them are saying what they, themselves thought of it?

Another reason why I didn't give this a one-star review was because of the music.  My, my, my...how did they get Jodi Benson to do this degrading role?  She's worthy of Disney film voices, she's beyond this.  Barry Manilow provides much of the song scores!  That's definitely a plus, the music in this film is cute and charming for the most part, but comparing it to Disney is a mistake.  ""Let Me Be Your Wings"" is considered by some to be as good as Disney's best...I do hope that no one really thinks this, that is such an insult towards Disney.

I will have to say, however, that the music is catchy.  The song with the beetles was just priceless.  Thumbelina looked very lovely dressed up as a beetle and the song brought excitement to the film.  Not really necessary, though.

To sum up, it's a cute film...but also very odd.  What was the point of this?  Why did Bluth make an attempt at this?  Your child may enjoy it, I know I did when I was a child, but take a second look at it and you may just see it for what it really is.

I've heard that Thumbelina by Goodtimes is pretty good, nicely made, wonderful animation, and beautiful music, I would recommend that you check that one out instead of wasting two hours of your life with Don Bluth's Thumbelina.",1111449600,,3077,4.366197183098592
2566025,5,B000FH8H7Q,i loved this movie. it is perfect. i recomend this movie for every one who likes a movie about a girl being swept off her feet and having trouble getting back to her prince. you have to see this movie.,1110931200,,201,4.05
2566026,3,B000FH8H7Q,Our 3 year old loves this movie!  The voices (and singing) are wonderful although the supporting character animation is a bit garish compared to the 'main' characters of Thumbelina and the Fairy Prince.,1097107200,,202,5.121212121212121
2566027,4,B000FH8H7Q,"This is an incredibly cute movie that I would gladly watch over again. The story flows pretty well, the animation is way above par (even though I spent the entire movie thinking how much Cornelius and Thumbelina resembled Fox's Dimitri and Anastasia), and the voice acting was wonderful. I liked all of the voices chosen, but I of course had a hard time separating Thumbelina and the Little Mermaid (cause they share the same voice actress). Anyway, this is a great movie, and I recommend all see it, no matter what your age!",1089158400,,525,4.655913978494624
2566028,5,B000FH8H7Q,"I didn't see ""Thumbelina"" until I was in my 20's, but since I love animation, it didn't make much difference.  I love this movie and finally got it on DVD a couple days ago.  Jodi Benson did another great job lending her voice to the lead character and the music was great too.  The only complaints I have about the movie, to echo other reviewers, is that some of the animals in the farm were very strange looking.  Also, I couldn't help but notice that Thumbelina was constantly losing her balance no matter where she was standing.  Still, I think Don Bluth did an excellent job on ""Thumbelina"" and that it deserved much more recognition.  I admit, I'm a softy for fairy tales, and I actually love her innocent, naive personality.  It was great to see her make the right decision at the end though, even knowing she might be alone.  Unlike what some reviewers have said, I think that makes her a great role model.  We all have to go through a learning process.  But without being silly and over analyzing the film's psychological effect on society, it's just a fun and enjoyable movie that I would recommend for any young girl or adult who's young at heart.",1083283200,,1158,4.497607655502392
2566029,2,B000FH8H7Q,"Dude, Don Bluth. What happened to you man? Why do you insist on telling stories that are just too long and too confusing to be movies? Watching this movie was like watching a million plots combined into one. It seemed like every two seconds Thumbalina would wake up in another stranger's home voiced by yet another celebrity. This movie does get some points for some nice CGI action and good music. Can't recomend this one. It's just too much and not enough at the same time.",1079568000,,475,4.534883720930233
2566030,1,B000FH8H7Q,"What a terrible, depressing film. As we were watching, my three year old daughter kept insisting that this was not the 'real' movie, and wanted us to fast forward! I can see what she meant -- the scenes just kept getting weirder and weirder, with Thumbelina just going along for the ride. Evil frogs. Evil Mice. Evil moles. Evil beetles. Evil story. Evil plot. Pink headed dog thing that makes Goofy look good. 30 second love affair in the first few minutes. 30 second marriage to wrap it up. 2 hours of pain in between.
Life is too short to spend on this junk. Want interesting, non-Disney heroines that you wouldn't mind your children emulating? Try Kikis Delivery Service or My Neighbor Totoro. Want a beautiful movie with good voice acting and story? Watch Nemo again. Whatever you do, avoid Thumbelina.",1077926400,,807,4.7304964539007095
2566031,5,B000FH8H7Q,"My grand daughter enjoyed this movie so much.  It was so incredible to watch her relate to the music.  And towards the end, she smiled so big, she clapped her hands with joy, and she walked to bed dancing.  This will definitely become one of her favorite movies.  This was a excellent buy.",1060473600,,289,4.39622641509434
2566032,4,B000FH8H7Q,"I'm fifteen, and I saw this movie just recently while babysitting for some little kids.  That was a week and two days ago.  The movie and songs have been going through my head ever since.  I have to say, I loved it, as much as I did when it first came out.  I agree with all of you that those tufts of hair on Thumbelina are kinda funky looking.  The scene in the mole's house is one of my favorites.  I love the song ""Sun"".  It is really poetic and symbolic. All in all, I think it is a great movie, although certain aspects of it are a bit farfetched.  Such as Cornelius freezing, and the bugs just thawing him out.  Hello?  How unreal is that?  But I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good love story or good music.",1056931200,,727,4.049295774647887

I have been in love with it ever since I got it a few years ago, and it is something you will never want to turn off.  The plot is cute and romantic, to say the least; all of the characters are great and the music is to die for (""Let Me Be Your Wings"" is a song you'll find yourself singing no matter where you go).
A definite favorite; see it today! =)",1053993600,,440,3.7717391304347827
2566034,3,B000FH8H7Q,"We would've given this a higher rating, but the freaky bugs, george washington chickens, punk ox, the can-can birds, the dog and the bird (Jacquapo, and if that's not how you spell his name I couldn't care less). Cornelius could really lose the cowlick and thumbelina's weird bang thing could use an adjustment. Their romance blossomed very quickly. The only songs we liked ""Let me be your wings"" and ""marry the mole!"" THe mouse was so cute, but the mole was really freaking us out.
And Thumbelina's hairdo at the end could change. But the best character has to be the pink-haired frog. ANd the beetle. Though i must say, the frog who wants to marry Thumbelina made up his mind quicker than Cornelius (which is saying something). Just two seconds, and he says ""Mother...I love her"" (even though I don't know anything about her).
Disney could have made it better.
We know and understand that this review probably wasn't the best or most convincing one, but we felt like writing it anyway.",1048896000,,987,4.710982658959537
2566035,5,B000FH8H7Q,Thumbelina is a great film. Funny in some scenes such as the musical with the singing frogs and the Beetle ball. Very touching at the beginning and very end. Best of all no political correctness which gets rather annoying after all. Thumbelina's innocence and timidness irks some people. But I find it rather charming. because she grows up towards the end.,1025654400,,356,4.852459016393443
2566036,5,B000FH8H7Q,"I just rented this movie this weekend and watched it with my six year old daughter. The story line is not so predictable like Disney ones are, and there are a lot of twists and turns in the plot. I don't like the fact that this is again another ""My Prince Will Come, and we'll live Happily Ever After"" story like all the others, but at least there is MORE to this story than that.
It shows that males can lie and cheat to get a girl...and that sometimes you have to look out for yourself and don't believe everything you hear. So based on that I give it 5 stars...plus the singing is great, and so is the animation. This movie is not cheesy like some others you may find for kids. Definitely get this movie, it is more than worth it.",1017532800,,733,4.1328671328671325

I am always captivated by the ""Let me be your wings"" segment which feels more like a  Rogers and Hammerstien film than it does a cartoon. Try not to compare it to a Disney film and you will really enjoy it. Yes it has a few moments that I wish weren't in the final cut but on the whole it has a place in my heart where Secret of Nimh sets. What a great animated musical.",1004400000,,525,4.0

The only part I don't like is the part when the mouse sings ""Marry the Mole""...you might want to screen this movie first to make sure it won't scare your child (: But I'm sure if they're over the age of 7 they will adjust ....just putting in my opinion.

2566040,5,B000FH8H7Q,"What gives? This is a sweet, endearing, lovely story with great animation--so why do so many people dislike it? Heck, after watching this  movie, *I* daydreamed about being Thumbelina. Admit it, wouldn't you like  it?
The traditional Hans Christian Anderson story: A woman who wishes for  a daughter is blessed with one in a flower--and she's about six inches  tall. But this doesn't matter to Mother or her array of barnyard animals,  who love Thumbelina dearly. However, soon a handsome fairy prince named  Cornelius arrives and is smitten with Thumbelina. After taking her on a  ride on his pet bumblebee, he has to leave but promises to come  back.
That night, Thumbelina is kidnapped by a family of singing frogs,  but as she escapes with the help of a French swallow, she ends up in deeper  and deeper trouble.
Some things in this movie are rather cloying--the  jitterbugs, for example--but they're too small a part of the movie to be  noticeable. Thumbelina is not a macho heroine, so don't expect her to act  like one--she's a lost, frightened girl who's been sheltered all of her  life. She shows remarkable strength and I got the feeling that the  Thumbelina at the end was very different from the girl at the  beginning.
Cornelius remains my favorite character. Our first glimpse of  the adolescent fairy is after he escapes from a royal parade, where he is  forced to sit on *snicker* a white butterfly. He's strong, funny,  interesting, lifelike, and... dare I say it?... sexy.

Also a big  take-off of performancing arts where a swallow is made up just like a mime  clown and the bugs all attend a glitzy nightclub. As for the wee heroine  with her amazing mane of golden Rapunzel-like hair, she is a bit of an  airhead, yet she is quite an innocent young creature.
