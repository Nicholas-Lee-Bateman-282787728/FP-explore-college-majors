4235499,3,B003ZTDZVY,A sad story that recalls my life as a closeted homosexual husband many years ago.  Though Ran has a beautiful kissy face and luscious lips the sexual scenes are stiff and awkward looking...especially their first intimate encounter up on the roof. More revealing dialogue might have helped viewers understand their motives.  After being dumped by another gay man (in denial) the jilted young lover barely has time to recover before he immediately jumps from the skillet into the fire with eyes wide open. This complex relationship needs more time to develop but I guess a small budget doesn't allow a lot of reel time. Did the married man commit suicide at the end? I didn't.,1295740800,7,674,4.852173913043479
4235500,5,B003ZTDZVY,I love the movie so much in the sense that these men are torn between being religious and submitting to their sexual and emotional desires for each other. I was a little bit sad at the end but it is what it is especially in a place like Jerusalem and other places that are just as strict. Highly recommended for the open minded,1290729600,10,327,4.2063492063492065
4235501,5,B003ZTDZVY,"If you are looking for a ""gay themed"" film that is ""warm and fuzzy"", where the misunderstood and rejected are eventually accepted and kind of understood with the film coming to a loving happy conclusion (boy finds and loves boy living happily ever after) FORGET this film of ""Eyes wide Open"" because in actuality it's a very sad film telling a very sad tale of misunderstood love indeed.

This superb, wonderfully directed and acted film raises the question of what does one do when merely falling in love goes against a person's  beliefs, upbringing, family and friends etc.  This film tells the tale of Aaron who is living as an ultra-orthodox Jew in Jerusalem with his wife and family seemingly on the outside to be happy.  Enter into his rather ""closed"" world Erzi a handsome young man seeking a job which Aaron gives him.  Against all that is important in Aaron's life the two men fall in love and as Aaron states, he becomes alive.  Of course, there are many obstacles preventing them from being happy together.  The major obstacle is the community which is very ""up in arms"" that Aaron, their butcher and pillar in their community is spending so much time with Erzi who is a man ""with a past"".  None of this seems to bother Aaron who seems to think that he can handle it all.  Erzi knows better.

In conclusion, all that I can say is that this film will stick to me for a very long time because it is a movie that I found to be very haunting.

I must add that the mood of this film is captured beautifully by its photography and the way it is filmed.  The film is set almost entirely in one neighborhood that is located in a rather bleak looking area of Jerusalem that is void of any color only reflecting tones of grey.  There are only a few moments on screen that show any color--when Aaron and Erzi get out of the neighborhood to a stream otherwise, everything including the inhabitants of this shown neighborhood look grey.",1290211200,21,1934,4.491428571428571
4235502,5,B003ZTDZVY,This  dvd is already available  in Europe so  if you can play region 2 dvds then get a copy now otherwise  make sure you  see it when it is availabe in USA. This is one of the most memorable  gay films ever - much better than  most of the  cliched rubbish that is common in  American gay films. One gets sick of the American gay films  in which  the  cast are usually very good looking  and almost everyone lives in  expensive  homes but  the films are  not  true to life like the European  and Asian gay  films. They are far superior in reality and  storytelling.  I am lucky to live in a country in which most of out dvd players/tvs are multi region and can play any format. You are missing out on the world's best  in Gay cinema by only  being able to watch region 1 dvds.,1286496000,10,775,4.081081081081081
4235503,5,B003ZTDZVY,".....Passion.........then carried along through the mores and strictures of a religious sect foreign to most of us, until we reach a Devastating Ending.  The devastating (only word that fits) sense of loss and despair breathed by Shakespeare into a centuries earlier ""Romeo & Juliet"" is in no way greater than the sense of loss and despair created by the religious, non-accepting fervor we see directed at the two ""Romeos"" of this film.  It is enough to make any understanding viewer weep.

(( Here is my approach to obtaining/reviewing Gay content films. Simply, it's seeking the holy grail of that genre, or looking for the ""Addictive Film""---that movie one returns to time and again). Selection/purchase comes from finding new releases by favorite directors/screenwriters, and from your comments at major online DVD sales or review sites. Rarely, I come across the ""Addictive,"" those watchable every couple of months or oftener---see *** area below.  Thanks for sticking with me so far ))

NOTES:  Possible Spoilers Ahead  /  This review based on earlier released European DVD version obtained through Amazon.com/UK

As an aside, if you're considering watching a movie like this, then possibly you are of a ""certain persuasion.""  That being perhaps the case, please play a little simulation with me.....a little game of suppose, or what if.  Alrighty, then.  Now, consider yourself and someone you've come to know, perhaps a longtime friend or fellow worker.....maybe a member of your club.....your pick-up sports group. You're in a little game of one-on-one,  possibly out on a hike, swimming in a stream pool together, sharing a tent.....when.....Suddenly, you begin sensing a difference in your thoughts about him---maybe even feeling that something similar is occurring on his part.......OR, as in this film's story, you find yourselves in a 2-person workplace, alone and away from the eyes and ears of others, just trying to get the job done.  AND, in helping each other move equipment and work supplies around, you notice your fingers touching in handing off items one to the other.....there is a brushing of arms as you pass.  THEN comes a stillness and closeness in the space you're occupying with this other person.....and those sensations begin magnifying, driving you into a mentally agitated state.....your eyes sweep around, but always return to that other person.....you have to move and nervously pace a bit.....all these things occurring as you feel your senses jumping into overdrive.  Even more, there's a thrumming within your body which is growing.....growing; your skin nerve-ends begin experiencing, like, tiny electrical waves.  Uncontrollably, your eyes are drawn, as by magnets, to those of the other person.....you cannot look away.....and it seems neither can he.  It is now that you find yourself moving toward the one who has become the center of everything happening to you.  At last, in this very instant, the two of you are reaching out with your hands, eyes locked.....FINALLY, they touch........And then it happens.

As for some specifics on this movie, at its heartrending core are a main and a secondary lead whose performances could hardly be bettered.  They wonderfully play two men for whom the briefest and smallest of smiles seems the norm for expressing some bit of happiness in their closed-in existence.  Yet there are rare in-public times (but only when they are together) when we witness instances of laughing camaraderie, which seem to lighten their societally controlled lives.  And, yes, there are times we cry for them as we realize their moments of ""bliss"" in coupling are likely to be short-lived.

A couple of things to specifically watch for:

-- The most heart-stopping moment in the film comes as our main lead is being pummeled, shouted at and questioned by his own religious leader over what's seen as his ""unacceptable relationship and activity"" with another.  Then, of a sudden, Aaron surges back, blurting out:  ""I WAS DEAD......AND NOW I'M ALIVE!""

-- A group bullying scene, as the film's last 10 minutes begin, will break your heart.  To this viewer, it not only ""symbolizes"" the beginning of the end (in the very worst sense), but actually ""is"" the beginning of the end.  Watching the eyes and body positions assumed by our leads in these filmed moments will tear you apart----for the realization hits us that a tearing apart is precisely what is happening.

There is only one DVD Special Feature to speak of---a Writer / Director Interview (possibly English not being a first language accounts for a less than smooth presentation of ideas).  Consisting of a series of questions asked, they include:  director's background (non-gay and non-religious individual), to include his filmmaking history / the philosophy and thinking behind this film / effect of low budget on sticking to script / political and national implications of the film within the Nation of Israel.  Nothing is provided concerning interrelationship of the two male leads during filming----something that would have been of interest to, at least, this viewer.  Sadly, there is no during-the-film commentary.

PS--Never have I hesitated in placing an Excellent film on my shelf of ""Addictives""......still a heavy heart made me waiver in this instance.  Rest assured, though, that's exactly where this production is going.

4235504,5,B003ZTDZVY,"Such cruelty is unimaginable, but so close to us. We are in a Jewish community in Jerusalem, one of these communities that live by the Torah a life totally locked up in that logic. A man gets married, has children, works all his life, goes to the synagogue every single time it is necessary, celebrates Sabbath, dresses the proper way, speaks proper language, kisses the jamb of the door when he is coming in or going out of a house, apartment or store. That's a very routine-like life that does not accept anything that goes against this routine, these rules, this pre-formatted life. If the man is a butcher his whole life and his family's depend on the community that must be convinced that he is pure, he is no sinner. And sin is all-pervading in this community. The result is sad in many ways: it is absolute solitude right in the midst and the heart of a human community, a solitude that kills the heart and the soul because the only thing that this man may desire is forbidden, and that is love, love from an equal, love from a man, love from another human being made in the image of God. That forbidden love is divine because it brings together two direct representatives of God, sons of God, Adam and Adam, full equality, the supreme desire of love, to love your equal, to love yourself in the other and let the other love himself in you. But that kind of love is banned by the Torah (Leviticus 18:22, ""You must not lie with a man as with a woman. This is a hateful thing."" Leviticus 20:13, ""The man who lies with a man in the same way as with a woman: they have done a hateful thing together; they must die, their blood shall be on their own heads."") But at the same time the butcher Aaron who accepts Ezri under his roof is then in a serious dilemma when the people around him start being menacing and aggressive because in Genesis 19:5-8 it is said: ""They called to Lot, ""Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them."" Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him and said, ""No, my friends. Don't do this wicked thing. Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don't do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof."" And this means Aaron has to protect Ezri. But nothing is that simple and Ezri who has no one except Aaron will leave to enable Aaron to live in peace. But Aaron will not be able to live in that peace. The end is sad, very sad. This film is about that kind of bigotry against gay people, or even nothing but gay desire in the name of a law that is in pure contradiction with the famous Lot story that brings God's fire onto Sodom: the people in Sodom did not respect the law of hospitality, and history repeats itself. The people of this community did not respect the law of hospitality either, but God seemingly brought his fire down onto the host and the guest. Sodom upside down in a way, though in perfect order according to the Torah in another way. There could be a third way but it would mean to leave the community, wife, children. But we can wonder if the departing Ezri and the departed Aaron have not done just that. The film is great because it is delicate, slow and entirely introspective to the point of making the story unreal, at least to our eyes that are wide open and can't see no justice in that law of fire. When one was stoned to death in Jerusalem in the old days, he had to be thrown over the wall of the city, he had to dig his own grave in which he was buried up to the shoulders and then the people could stone him to death, at least that's how James, Jesus' eldest brother was executed. Times may have changed but our stoning techniques are maybe less brutal or bloody but they are just as effective.

4235505,5,B003ZTDZVY,"The Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in Durham, NC has done it again.  Last year the film ""Shank"" stood out as a movie that was very unpleasant to watch in many ways because of the extreme violence, but it won many of the audience members over with the interesting storyline, great acting, and great directing that it exhibited.  This year, the first selection that I saw at the festival was ""Eyes Wide Open"".  It was made in Israel and was in Hebrew with English subtitles.  Again, this movie, too, was unpleasant to watch in many ways because it is a story about two orthodox Jewish men who meet and fall in love, a situation that obviously will not sit well with the orthodox Jewish community.  So, I approached the film from the beginning with the thought, ""This story probably won't have a happy ending.""

Aaron, the older of the two, starts out already married with four children.  With the death of his father, he has taken over the family business, which is a kosher butcher shop.  One day, a younger man, a yeshiva student comes into Aaron's shop and when Aaron discovers that he doesn't have a job or a place to live, he graciously makes the young man, Ezri, his trainee and assistant and offers him a place to stay in the basement of the butcher shop where his father had sometimes stayed overnight when he ran it.  Aaron is an avid reader and studier of the Talmud and wants to make what he studies in the Talmud a real part of his everyday living.  At first, he sees Ezri as someone upon whom he can practice his good deeds.  But, as weeks go by, with the two men spending so much time together at work and studying the Talmud together, both men develop a strong physical attraction for each other.  At first Aaron acknowledges the attraction they feel, but tells Ezri that it is something they must overcome to become better Jews.  But the attraction becomes so strong that finally even Aaron can't fight it.  He tries to maintain his normal relationship with his wife and children, but he finds himself making more and more time for Ezri and their love-making.  Inevitably, word leaks out to the community about Aaron and this younger stranger who came into town with no family and friends.  With a little background checking, people find out that Ezri was thrown out of his previous community for having homosexual relations with someone in that community and was thus abandoned by that man as a result.  Community members approach Aaron and tell him point blank that he must send Ezri away and resume his life as a family man and as a respected man of the community.  Otherwise, they will stop trading in his shop and stop socializing with him in any way.  Everything within Aaron doesn't want to send Ezri away and he even goes so far as to tell one of the elder Jewish leaders that he was not alive until Ezri came into his life.  I was right; the movie doesn't have a happy ending, but it does pose some very important questions that those who are so opposed to gay and lesbian love need to answer.

First, do gays and lesbians choose this lifestyle?  For that matter, do heterosexuals choose their lifestyle?  In my estimation, neither gays nor straights choose their lifestyle.  We are either gay or straight from birth.  It is so much a part of our makeup that the only choice we have is whether to do anything about our desires or to pretend to be something we are not.  If that is true, where is the wrong-doing?  It is true that in this story, Aaron might have been able to have hidden for the rest of his life these desires that were so heinous to his community if Ezri had never shown up, but Ezri did show up and because he did, life with his wife and children could never go back to the way it was before, even if Ezri leaves town.  Ezri has put the gleam in his eyes and the pounce in his step.  What do you think the odds are that Aaron would be on the look-out eventually for another man that would do the same?  I'd say those odds are very good.  A film that plants those questions in our minds, is nothing less than a great film.",1282608000,53,4061,4.410738255033557

4235508,5,B003ZTDZVY,"The artistic beauty of the film is incredible, with excellent performances by the cast throughout. It centers around a gay relationship, but there is also an important side story about a forbidden straight relationship. The setting is in a Haredi area of Jerusalem, many of the scenes are from the Meah Shearim community, although being that I lived near there I can tell they weren't all shot in that neighborhood. What is realistic about the movie is how the community would react to such a scandal, but there are a couple of scenes that never would have happened in that community, (don't want to give away plot details). I'm pretty knowledgable of the Haredi community in Israel, I lived in one for a year and I have always lived in Orthodox communities. As a gay man myself, I have personally gone through some of the processes that these characters go through in the film in terms of the religious struggle associated with homosexuality. I was also especially impressed by Ravit Rozen, who plays the wife of the lead. It's a definite see, but don't think that you're getting a completely realistic picture of the Haredi community, although it is pretty close. Also, the focus of the movie, to me at least, is the interpersonal struggle of the lead. This isn't a movie about gay discrimination, that aspect is just what keeps the plot going. It's a struggle of religion vs. reality. Reward to come in the next world, or joy and fulfillment in this one. I relate very much to that conflict. I did think the end was a bit drastic and unrealistic though, but it added to the theme of the film and it is a movie after all, so things are going to be sensationalized.",1476230400,3,1666,4.6127946127946124

4235511,1,B003ZTDZVY,"Sad, I am sad for misreading the description.  Wish I had never seen it.  Don't watch this movie.  It portrays the Orthodox Chasidic world as a system rather than as it truly it, a relationship.  Most people do not understand the reasoning behind why Chasidic Jews do things and want to ascribe certain beliefs about the practice.  Yet, this movie while true in some forms gives a very poor viewpoint of the Chasidic.

4235513,5,B003ZTDZVY,"I found ""Eyes Wide Open"" quite revealing and quite disturbing and contradictory at the same time.

I think that what I found contradictory was the fact that here you have an extremely repressive and strict religious community that pretty much separates the sexes and pretty much demeans women and makes them dress and act in a sexually unattractive manner. Similar to Muslim life, women are pretty much not supposed to leave the house and are not encouraged to have an education or a profession. Women are kept separate in synogogues and even at weddings women dance with women and men dance with men. Men are ALWAYS together in school, in worship in the work place and socially. So here you have the perfect breeding ground for homosexuality when women are only relevant for reproduction and cooking and cleaning and not considered attractive or equal to men.

And yet homosexual relationships Do exist and are sort of swept under the carpet so long as they don't become public knowledge and they occur more often than most in the Community care to admit. And of course, the women aren't stupid. When their husbands grow tired of them, they know that it is NOT because they have met another woman because that simply is not physically possible in their community with all women under lock and key, so who could their husbands be having an affair with, I wonder ???",1473120000,4,1365,4.755274261603375

This should spare the rest of us from all that whining in the one-star section.
Now to the movie.

I found this a fascinating portrayal of the way religion is used to CONTROL people by making very sure everybody conforms to a set of dogmatic proscriptions.
Set in Israel, and firmly in the Jewish faith, there is an immediate discrepancy between what is being preached and what is being done in its name.
A young man arrives by chance in a rainstorm outside a married man's butcher shop.
The newcomer claims to be seeking to enter a yeshiva, but is really homeless, having journeyed long way to be with a former male lover who now has completely rejected him and their prior relationship due to religious beliefs.
The butcher finds him again later sleeping in a synagogue, and kindly offers him a job and rudimentary accommodation above the shop.
Rumours soon abound about the newcomer, ...mostly that he was asked to leave a former institution for ""doing favours"", which we are led to believe were of a homosexual nature.
Despite the general fear and disapproval of the young man, the relationship with the butcher becomes close, eventually ending up as a sexual one too.
This whole process is shown with incredible sensitivity, .....the slow breakdown of the formerly ""heterosexual"" butcher, and then the unstoppable rush of desire when years of repression are swept away and he discovers the joy of his true self.
We're shown his wife and family, ... including his somewhat perfunctory sexual relationship with his wife....which seems to hold little joy, but conforms to the dictates of their religion and society's expectations.

Of course in such a small community, rumours soon spread and a sort of religious vigilante group threatens violence if the young gay man is not turned out.
The story moves quite slowly, but every scene is depicted with such realism and intent to show how one's true self is always crushed by religious dogma. That and the horrible dilemma faced by a man who has for so long denied and repressed his true feelings to devote himself to the cultural expectations of marriage and raising a family in the Jewish faith.
There is quite a bit of Jewish traditional religious practice shown, but it is there for a purpose and never bogs down the narrative.

Performances are all excellent, but that of the married butcher stands out as being exceptional, in his role of a man torn between duty and a sudden unexpected rush of true love arriving later in life. The actress playing the wife is also extremely good, caught between feelings of betrayal and love, she never appears bitter or vindictive.

When privately challenged by the Rabbi as to why it is so hard to just ask the young man to leave, the butcher says "" Before I was dead. Now I am alive! I need him!"" It is most apparent that he does indeed, and the relationship continues until the outside situation becomes intolerable.
Another piece of dialogue then adds to the poignancy.
The butcher says, (without much conviction); ""This has to stop. I have a wife and children.""
The answer from his younger lover is ""And I only have you....""

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie on all levels.
Totally free of sensationalism, or gratuitous material, there are scenes of the two men together, but these are handled with sensitivity and joy, rather than becoming salacious.
There is also some male nudity, (quite distant) but please don't allow that to discourage you from this quite wistful and poignant film.

The ending is somewhat enigmatic,......we are not told what becomes of the handsome young man, and are left to ponder on just exactly what the outcome of the last scene might be with the butcher back in the ritual bathing pool.

A highly recommended and for once intelligent addition to Gay Cinema.",1443052800,,3954,4.805882352941176

I certainly would have liked a happy ending and was hoping for one but was not overly surprised by the ending. In non-cinematic life there are similar endings playing out like that in the movie in every day life but we are just not aware of it unless we know the individuals or it makes the newspapers or local network news. The one thing I would really like is for people reviewing movies where the love interest is between individuals of the same sex be it male or female stop using the term 'homosexual' or 'lesbian'.

4235560,4,B003ZTDZVY,"***Spoilers ahead***
I'm of two minds about this extraordinary, gripping movie. Or perhaps the director himself is of two minds about his material --which shouldn't surprise me.
One way or the other, the movie itself is not clear about whether Ezri is just a tormented soul or the demonic ""seducer"" he is accused of being by the yeshiva students. There is a scene near the end, at (or around) the yeshiva when Aaron makes a heart-ripping discovery that distinctly emphasizes the second possibility.
So we don't really know if what Aaron's final desperation is due to the fact that he cannot go on loving Ezri, or to having realized that Ezri never really loved him. And thus we cannot be sure if the director is questioning the dogmas of orthodox Judaism or reaffirming them.",1383955200,,775,4.791044776119403
4235561,3,B003ZTDZVY,"I found this movie enjoyable and an interesting subject matter but there are definite problems with the script.  The acting is good and the choice of actors was done well but there is an issue with chemistry.  The main characters relationship seems awkward and forced, to be expected to a point due to the subject matter but their display is beyond what would be reasonable.  Even the scenes where they are intimate are lacking.  Instead of a romantic exchange, their display has no commitment and in my opinion these types of movies don't need to full frontal but at least be sensible in the directing.  The content of the sex scenes needed to be rawer and excited, not wooden.  In this instance the act should've been more explicit, not implied.  Actually this movie has too much implied substance.  I don't mind movies where emotions and thoughts are left to your imagination but there is too much of an open door in this movie.  I got confused at times about the actor's motivation.  There's a scene in the walk-in freezer where they get to the nitty-gritty, seeming to get off on each other but there is no implication as too how it was done.  They stand up the whole time and it lasts maybe five minutes.  Did they give each other a hand job, were they so aroused they released without the need of the other or was both forgiving for being equally impotent?  It is not shown what exactly happened.  I am not trying to be offensive in my questions but it is the basis for my puzzlement; their hands where not shown to be out of the depiction much, adding to mystery.

Ezri leaves all he knows to come to Jerusalem to be with a man that rejects him due to religious conviction, no explanation or implied idea of the nature of their previous circumstance.  Obviously they had too of been hot and heavy but you have to come too that conclusion yourself without guidance.  Then he was rejected and made out to be some kind of orthodox whore, quickly getting caught up with Aaron.  Also the ""Morality Police"" shows up literally calling him a ""curse to righteous men"" but there was nothing shown that would bring them to such a conclusion.  There was no open public display of affection or someone shown reporting a dirty instance but we are made to believe he is a social degenerate.  Why was he called unholy?  No idea was given and it led me to question the sense of it all.  The only thing that I noticed that would raise an eyebrow, so to speak, was when the Rabbi told Aaron he knew of Ezri by hearsay and that he was forced out of his previous school but when asked why, all that was said was ""for doing good deeds"".  That is not enough to get the full scope of the problems he had faced.  I am glad some viewers understood what was going on and some of the problem could be the views take (mine) but I think some of the fault still lays squarely on the screen writers shoulders.

Aaron is another character that has a confusing motivation.  His father dies, he inherits the butcher shop (I suppose), and needs help to run the shop.  One minute there is no connection and then, boom; they are lovers, no real display of growing desire or a clear beginning for the cause and effect.  Don't get me wrong there a few scenes where Ezri wants to jump Aaron's bones but there is not enough time from the relationship's development.  There is just too much room for doubt and too much implied without justification.  Then there is Aaron's wife and children, obviously another tool for deep turbulence but it is poorly used and once again; why would the wife start suspecting.  I guess it is the fact one day the shop is closed and times he comes home late, no reason given to suspect his young protg.  She does know that Ezri is staying in the storage room, and a few times there are odd looks between her and the young man but nothing more shown, you are supposed to assume it is implied.  Aaron is an older man and the viewer is led to believe he has kept a very orthodox life, so why would everyone jump to the idea he is having a homosexual affair?  He is known in the community for his heart felt dedication and willingness to except the burden of being God's slave (he says that).

The only gratuitous scenes are Ezri's backside and Aaron's frontals, which believe me is not a pleasant experience.  As some others have noted, the movie ends as so many other gay movies do and it would have been a much powerful film if the result was positive.  I have wondered for some time why gay movies always have to be about unrequited love and the homosexual community gets shafted.  Perhaps it is assumed by directors that it will make their product more palpable to the public but it makes our love seem doomed due to being sinful, that God does not like it so it is not meant to last.  You'd think in our day and age we would have already conquered that hill but alas, still we are fighting to have same gender love validated.

After all this is said and done, I still recommend this movie because there is something about it I still found beautiful.  The music only adds to the tragic feel but it should considering how it ends.  I apologize if I gave too much away regarding the ending but this type of film cannot be expected to end any other way, I suppose.  Ezri is gorgeous and Aaron is attractive in his own way also, I guess it is another reason to watch the movie.  Both, I felt, acted well and fit the part, their costumes were realistically designed, except that I doubt orthodox Jews would have ear piercing holes. LOL!  Give the movie a try and perhaps you will come to a different conclusion like the other reviewers have.",1355875200,4,5634,4.406189555125725
4235562,5,B003ZTDZVY,I was hesitant about this one. Didn't take it quite seriously. What it did was illuminate my ignorance and teach me that I can't judge a movie by it's cover. This movie is definitely one of the best gay romances I've ever seen. Without excessive dialogue this movie was superb at envoking emotion. The actors were superb. This movie was educational for me and enlightening. Homosexuality abounds and it doesn't care what your religious preference is. Love is love and desire is desire. It sickened me to witness how a community could willfully ostrasize a person due to fear that another could essentially infect them with homosexuality. The ending was not happy but the movie forcefully made its point.,1336089600,,703,4.915966386554622

LOVE IS THE MOST POWERFUL FORCE IN THE UNIVERSE. It has no gender, it has no religious dogma,it has no nationality, it just has DEEP LOVE AND COMMITMENT. Though this story has the beauty of love, it does not go past the hate of religious bigots to the light of true love of two men who have found the secret of that human connection. My heart bleeds for the love lost here, but this story fails to move to the next level so many of us have found...long ago. Spare me the ""tragic"" ending of love unfilled. My partner and I have found 47 years of true love and commitment, in spite of hateful religious influences in our earlier lives.

4235565,2,B003ZTDZVY,"Had this films central theme been about religious intolerance or against religion in general, I would have given it 5 stars. It is a perfect example of what happens in a culture when religion becomes more important than the people themselves. The film goes out of its way to show rituals like the washing of hands, dipping in water, and kissing the Mezuzah as being inane, while the religion itself sacrifices the people who practice them. It also reveals the power and control this type of system has over its people, ruling with fear under the guise of faith. As you can clearly see in the film, it creates hypocrisy, witch hunts, self-righteousness, fault-finding, gossip, and hate, as people are subjugated to the belief system and begin policing each other. People are judged and condemned solely on belief and not on truth, facts, or science. It also gives you a clue as to why the religious right would want a religious social structure in America. Imagine controlling or just influencing the belief of the religious mind.

I found the odd and unusual acts scattered throughout the film unnerving, insane, and embarrassing. For example, the man walking forward and backward in the same place over and over, and the men rocking and ""preaching"" while facing a wall. Add to this, the mundane debating over scripture and putting up a facade to everyone around you, while at the same time taking note of what they are doing, became laborious. Again I say, imagine controlling or just influencing the belief of the religious mind.

The film reveals the victims of this system are not evil, wicked individuals, but people who simply cannot ""fit"" the mold they are being forced into. Israel and Sara are in love, yet she is betrothed (not of her choosing) to a man she doesn't want to marry. Ezri, a young Yeshiva student, has broken up with his lover, a fellow student, who has chosen his religion over his relationship with Ezri. Aaron, an older gay man, who has denied his sexuality for years and is now married with children, forced to face reality when he falls in love with Ezri. These are all threatened with physical harm by the ""morality guards"" if the don't obey and conform and stop their ""sinning"".

There is no laughing, no joy, no passion in the film, which comes across as being unremarkable, dull, and sluggish. This may be just a cultural difference or purposeful direction that I don't understand. I kept hoping for some energy between Aaron and Ezri but found their relationship contrived and tedious, lacking a spark. I felt Sara and Israel had more of a connection. Because of this, and the religious aspect I mentioned before, I gave the film 2 stars. If the film had centered on the relationships alone, I would have given it minus 1 star, if it were possible.",1325721600,4,2782,4.743801652892562
4235566,5,B003ZTDZVY,"This is a rather haunting and disturbing film, but this fact by no means makes it bad. In fact it is a very good and gripping film. It explores many conflicts: between homosexual desire and Orthodox Jewish teachings; a wife, children, and years of comfortable marriage vs. a lover; a somewhat open-minded rabbi against the closed-minded views of his congregants; freedom and self determination vs. community values; and extreme religion over enlightenment. Viewers will need to decide if Benjamin Franklin was correct when he said: To be overzealous in religion is to be irreligious.

The film's two lovers are a very devout butcher, the son of a highly respected man, living in a poor enclave of meticulously religious Jews in Jerusalem. He shows his religious devotion from the beginning of the film until the end. Yet, he is drawn to a handsome young man who his community considers an evil influence, who they want to drive out to protect themselves and their children.

The film, made in Israel, is in Hebrew, but its subtitles are easy to follow. There is only one mistake. When translating the Kaddish prayer, the subtitles translate it as a prayer for the dead. Actually, there is no mention of the dead in the prayer; it is a glorification of God. This error is inconsequential to the film and does not mar it in any way.",1323561600,2,1330,4.778260869565218
4235567,4,B003ZTDZVY,"This is one that is hard to place in existing genres. It tells of the story of Aaron Fleischman (Butcher played by Zohar Shtrauss), who is actually a butcher and purveyor of all meats kosher. He is an ultra orthodox Jew whose idea of fun is studying the Torah and being given to unexpected bouts of group `singing'. He is married with kids and is considered by his closeted community to be `righteous'. This is set in Jerusalem in a part of the town where civic pride is a phrase yet to enter their vocabulary; tarpaulins for roofs, graffiti everywhere and just dust on everything.

Then one day a young student stumbles into his shop and asks about work, this is 22 year old Ezri (Ran Dankar). He is initially rebuffed, but a later encounter sees Aaron offering Ezri the job. He soon becomes essential to Aarons existence, who now challenges his entire belief system, including religion and home life. Things move on a pace once Ezri has taken Aaron to the springs for `an immersion'. However everyone knows everyone's business and no one is allowed to do as they please. The phrase `no good will come of this' is a recurring theme.

There is only minimal background music which adds to the tension that is ever present, especially as rumours of Ezri `the sinner' soon become common knowledge and the `Modesty Guards' get involved. This film has explicit scenes of Torah study, graphic scenes of meat handling and full frontal views of ropey shop fronts. But despite all of that it has a strange energy that pulls you along with it. It is also very brave to have tackled such a subject and all power to Israeli cinema for doing such a great job.

He finds his match in Aaron who, though basically indistinguishable on the outside from others of his Orthodox sect is completely unique on the inside. Through the many meaningful silences and expressive gazes between the lovers, I found myself reflecting on my own stereotypes and pegging of people that I really don't know anything about. All of us are having our own experience of this existence and you can't tell what that is just by looking. I also loved the resiliency and patience of Aaron's wife Rivka for allowing her husband to have his experience even though it brought her pain and some shame. There really was no other way to end this movie. Do you really think Aaron could return to the life of a dead man after feeling so alive? The actors were riveting especially the one playing Aaron.

4235575,4,B003ZTDZVY,"I've been on a great roll of movies out of Israel lately (more on that later) and surfing around for more interesting Israeli brought me to this one.

""Eyes Wide Open"" (90 min; originally released in 2009) is set in the Orthodox Jewish community in Jerusalem. Aaron, married father of 4 kids, hires an assistant (Ezri) for his butcher shop. For reasons unexplained, Aaron bcomes attached to the young man, and soon things become physical. Eventually thre are rumors in the community, and Aaron comes under ever-growing pressure. The rabbi confronts  Aaron, asks him why he hasn't send the young assistant away, and Aaron responds ""I was dead, and now I'm awake. He's important to me"". You'll have to watch it for yourself how it all plays out in the end.

What attracted me to the movie was to see how this ""coming out"" story would be told in the context of the Orthodox Jewish community in which the movie is set, and at that the movie succeeded for me. The film did not convincingly bring the transformation as to how or why Aaron develops these feelings for another man. Still I'd say this is worth checking out. If you are looking for other great Israeli movies in recent years, let me just mention Lemon Tree, Or My Treasure, Free Zone, Tehilim, For My Father, Seven Minutes in Heaven, My Father My Lord, Walz With Bashir, and of course last Fall's theatrical release Lebanon.",1298678400,3,1381,4.651639344262295

8410966,5,B003ZTDZVY,Much better than I had anticipated. Much more story depth (mixed with beauty and sorrow) than most gay-themed movies made in English-speaking countries. A very strange eye-opener of orthodox Jewish culture and customs (I know I could not live there without going crazy). Marvelous acting and storytelling.,1505692800,,305,5.51063829787234
8410967,3,B003ZTDZVY,Not gonna spoil the movie but the ending was such a letdown. Acting? Great! Plot? Interesting! Ending? Very abrupt and unsatisfying. It's definitely a movie I would watch again though. Everything was going perfect until the last portion of the movie (sadly). I liked this movie nonetheless.,1498348800,,290,5.191489361702128
8410968,3,B003ZTDZVY,"I would actually give it a 3.5 if they allowed halvies. The film was well done. A bit on the slow pace, but the two actors seemed to work with together giving us a believable display of passion. Typical of most gay films, its theme is on prejudices and there is no happy ending. In fact, there was no true ending. I won't spoil it but to say its one of those writer's cop out closings: ""I don't know how to end this so lets just do this peddly thing, then fade to black.""
It never works.",1496016000,,487,4.030927835051546
8410969,3,B003ZTDZVY,"Another gay themed movie written for a straight audience in order to inspire guilt.  There's no happy ending here.  If you like seeing Orthodox Jewish Mafia and unhappy, inconclusive endings, you might like this movie.  It's time they started making gay romance movies for a gay audience...that are on par with the gazillions of hetero romance movies - you know the kind with happy endings.  Or is that too forbidden???",1492041600,,419,4.942857142857143
8410970,5,B003ZTDZVY,"Lest one forget, this magnificent film serves to remind you all over again how well represented prejudice and intolerance is even among those whose history should have shown them better. I thought of that wonderful old actress from 1985's ""Dangerous Liaison"" sighing about ""...how little world changes."" A memorable film, memorable performances. I'll take this over ""Brokeback Mountain"" any day.",1480723200,,395,5.6
