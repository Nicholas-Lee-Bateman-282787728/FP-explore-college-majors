688561,5,6303619983,"This was the first movie I had seen Russell Crowe in, and I have been in complete awe of him ever since.  This movie is a touching story of a father and son both trying to find love, and the difficulties they both have.  The father, Harry (Jack Thompson), is a fifty-something widower who, after being single for many years, turns to a computerized dating service to find a special someone.  Jeff (Russell Crowe) is a young gay man trying to find his match among the gay community.
Harry finds Joyce, a divorcee about his age, and spends most of the movie romancing her.  Jeff, however, finds and looses Greg, a young man who has chosen to hide his homosexuality from a judgemental father.  Greg finds the openness between Harry and Jeff to be too much for him, and he avoids Jeff, depsite the obvious attraction they share.  Tragedy strikes, and changes everything, but the movies still ends with a smile.
The movie never looses it's lighthearted feel; even the serious scenes are relatively short and are quickly followed by a quip or two to make you smile again.  This sends across a strong message that we shouldn't take life too seriously, even the rough spots, because it's just too short.
This movie would definitely be a shock to most of the recent Crowe converts, since all of his most popular American releases have involved him as a man's man, rough and just sensitive enough to win the girl.  Seeing this movie in a rare appearance on cable TV, my brother (who supports homosexuality if he doesn't have to see any PDAs) turned to me and said it was such a good movie he didn't even care about seeing two men kissing.  He and I both found it amazing that this often-publicized womanizer could play a gay man as convincingly as he did.
If you are a Russell Crowe fan, this movie is a must see.  His performance, as well as that of the other actors, is astounding.  While I don't mind having to buy it secondhand, I would think that re-releasing this movie would be a huge business move on any studio's part, and it would help Crowe's newest converts to appreciate him that much more.",995068800,23,2093,4.525198938992043
688562,5,6303619983,"This movie is very hard to find in the United States, and I cannot understand why it has not been re-released.  I would think that someone would want to cash in on Russell Crowe's post-Gladiator success by making this film available again.  I mean, they re-released his atrocious ""No Way Back"", for crying out loud.  But alas, it appears that no one has caught on to this little gem (or that a re-release is being deliberately suppressed--that's the conspiracy theorist in me coming out).
In any case, I was lucky enough to rent this video a couple of years ago, before it was stolen from my local video store and never replaced.  What a delightful surprise it turned out to be.  ""Sum of Us"" is, at it's heart, the story of a boy and his dad.  Jeff (Crowe) is looking for love in Sydney's gay bar scene.  He desperately wants someone with whom he can share his life, have a beer with, cuddle up to... ""Is that too much to ask?""  His father, Harry (Jack Thompson), doesn't think so.  He desperately wants his son to be happy, and to find true love.
Much of the film is hilarious, due in large part to Harry's keen interest in his son's sex/love life, and his openness to discussing it in front of other people.  Harry is too supportive, you see, to the point of embarrassing Jeff beyond all hope.  The young man whom Jeff fancies is not accustomed to such candor.  In fact, he is keeping his own homosexuality a secret from his judgemental father.  In the meantime, Harry is looking for love himself, now that he's nearing retirement, which causes its own comedy and drama.
In ""Sum of Us"", Crowe and Thompson break the fourth wall, and speak directly to the audience.  This actually works for this film--it does not distract the viewer or take them out of the story.  In fact, I felt the same little thrill one does when hearing a good piece of gossip.  These little asides to the audience also contribute greatly to the humor.  But it's not all fun and games.  Jeff is a very sensitive young man, who's been deeply hurt by lovers in the past.  Jeff wears his heart on his sleeve, and all of his insecurity, excitement, disappointment, longing, and adoration play across Crowe's face in a heartbreaking, uninhibited performance.
Thompson plays off Crowe perfectly, and vice versa.  Their relationship is completely believable--you would think that they really were father and son.  Getting on each other's nerves, pushing each other's buttons, knowing each other's weaknesses.  This is a relationship rarely seen on screen--a close, loving, warm relationship between a parent and child.  Dysfunctional family relationships are more volatile, dynamic, and therefore more dramatic in the minds of most screenwriters--normal people are boring.  Jeff and Harry are anything but boring, and they take the viewer right along with them.  You'll find yourself caring deeply about both Harry and Jeff, hoping, hoping, hoping that everything will work out for each of them in the end.  This is a very engaging story, due in large part to the performances of Crowe and Thompson, and the chemistry between the two.
Don't miss it.  I just purchased a used copy from, and it was worth it.  This is a movie that I'm sure I'll watch over and over again, the kind of movie you dust off once a year and discover something new about it each time.",994032000,38,3326,4.6977547495682215
688563,5,6303619983,"The Sum of Us, Proof, Romper Stomper and Hammers Over the Anvil are in my opinion the best of Russell Crowe's earlier works. Which is pretty funny since they aren't that old. In four years he managed to span the range that most actors strive for in a lifetime.
The Sum of Us is a love story at heart. It doesn't matter if you're gay. It deals with what eveyone feels inside. Jack Thompson and Russell Crowe have that special chemistry that endears these characters to you as father and son. True, for a change this father is accepting and that's where the humor lies. John Polson is great as the love interest.
This film is heartfelt and heartwarming and one of the reason's I  have come to appreciate Mr. Crowe's work. He is believable. These small little films really focused on characters and had directors who really put their hearts out there as much as the actors.",978652800,,870,4.506329113924051
688654,5,6303619983,"This film is an example of how the most simple plot can be the most emotionally successful with the right actors and director. Starring the young and unknown Russell Crowe before he came to hollywood, this is a most unlikely story of deep, unshakable love, trust and acceptance between a father and son. Especially unusual because the father is a randy although aging heterosexual, and his son is a confirmed homosexual. It is to his credit that Crowe makes his character very simply believable without any trace of self-consciousness. As life requires, there is tragedy, but if anything the father-son bond is made even stronger. If this movie does not pull on your heart, maybe you should check your humanity level. Don't know how I missed this one.",1475020800,,751,4.875

Yes you see two men kiss but there is NOTHING other than that in this film. So homophobes can relax and just enjoy a very well written, funny and compassionate film. A dads love and open-mindedness for his son leads you on a non-stop fun ride and then dad has a life changing event and his son shows the same love for his dad and his situation.

688927,4,6303619983,"This is a simple homespun tale of a widower father and his son who falls in love. The only difference is this is one of the first Australian films to create a ""normal"" regular bloke (very well played by Russell Crowe) who is gay, and John Polson (not quite as good  -  Russ deserved better) is the object of his effection. The other ""new"" line taken here is that Dad (Jack) is completely and affectionately and proudly supportive of his son in every respect. He doesn't however tell blind date from the dating agency Deborah Kennedy and this derails a promising relationship for the two older singles. A friendship between them endures however and Russell and Polson are set for a ""happy ending"". It's a bit slight, a bit long and a tad mawkish at times but a talented cast keep it entertaining. Jack Thompson (the director employs the trick of having him talk to the camera from time to time) is on the whole delightful and he and Crowe carry the show.",1364428800,3,953,4.502890173410405

688930,5,6303619983,"A comedy, one more, in this life that is so little comic indeed.  We start with the promise of a revolution coming through and we end with a request or piece of advice that you better be home soon, and in between, love, romance, tragedy and a lot of empathy and misery with a little bit of happiness sprinkled on top, at times angry happiness because of the silly decision you took and it broke the potential happy development you were hoping for and looking forward to getting on a silver platter. You just got Saint John the Baptist's head.

We are dealing here with grown up men and women all in strange situations. A young gay man living with his parents and the father behaves as if he did not know and he turns ugly when it becomes news stuff on TV. Another gay man living with his widower of a father who is not gay but accepts his son the way he is though he is invasive, maybe an intrusive voyeur, and in a way blocks his son's way to happiness.

That same man gets in touch with a lady through some meeting club and the two fall for one another but the night when things were going to go through, New Year's Eve, at his place, the son being out for his own fun, she comes across some gay magazines and cannot accept the fact that she had not been told before, and if she had it would not have changed anything because she just does not want to go across this line.

Just minutes after she drove off, when the fireworks start celebrating the New Year, he has a savage and wild heart attack or stroke and he will remain paralyzed on one side and without the capability to speak any more. In other words she broke his heart and that is not a metaphor, she literally did break his heart, boom.

That is sad, very sad, but it is a comedy, so there must be a happy ending and life will take care of some haphazard meeting of the two young men and then life will be on tracks again. But gosh it is not easy to build your own happiness when you are not a photocopy of the standard middle of the way unoriginal model imposed by ethical and moral norms in our society, even when things have changed legally. Between the law and reality there is more than a simple Strait of Malacca: there are thousands of hostile pirates with weapons everywhere up over their heads ready to raid your life to prevent you from being happy.

Enjoy the details.

688932,5,6303619983,"A great movie that focuses on the love and acceptance between a father and his son. Yes, the son is gay, but the movie does not show anything overt or offensive, in my opinion. If such a thing bothers you, however, it would be best to avoid this because his father accepts that part of his life without condition and, in fact, goes a tad overboard in trying to make his son's new boyfriend feel at home.

The actors are Australian so you must get used to their slang as well as their accents. Quite charming, actually.  This was done very tastefully, no
exposed body parts. The rapore between Crowe and Thompson as father and son is a beautiful example of natural unselfish love and respect that all families should experience. From time to time the actors talk to the audience through the camera and it works well. Crowe shows he can play any type of character very well due to his dedication to his craft.

Most ""gay"" movies are so badly acted, too overtly sexual, or just plain boring...lacking in substance and truth.

689023,4,6303619983,"Twenty-something Jeff Mitchell (Russell Crowe) is a gay plumber and footie player who lives with his father, Harry (Jack Thompson).  The two have a close and loving relationship and Dad is forever trying to fix Jeff up with nice men.  Harry, a widower, misses being in love and tries a computer dating service for himself; the lady he meets seems just about perfect, until he tells her about his son.

This is a very sweet father and son story, with Crowe and Thompson both convincing, sympathetic, and utterly likeable in their roles.  Filmed in Sydney, the thick Aussie accents and slang may be a bit hard to understand at times, but they make the story seem very real and intimate.  I would have given the film five stars (I did give it 3.5 stars) had it not been for the very annoying gimmick of having the actors break character and talk directly to the camera every few minutes.  This was especially distracting when the father, paralyzed and mute from a stroke, suddenly started moving and speaking normally.  I gather this is a holdover from the stage play, but it definitely destroyed the continuity; each time an actor spoke to the audience, we were reminded that it's only acting and we had to start all over in our willing suspension of disbelief.  It would have been so much better if they had just used voice-overs or, better yet, skipped the narrations altogether.

Since no story lines are concluded, this is basically a slice-of-life drama, a peek into a life shared by father and son.  The sight of Russell Crowe in footie shorts is reason enough to watch this movie; his many fans will enjoy seeing him in his pre-Hollywood days in this simple and lovely love story.",1187222400,4,1685,4.662162162162162

They live together in Sydney.  The twist is that Jeff is gay and Henry is fine with it.  Sometimes a little too fine with it (he has no problem walking in while Jeff is in bed with someone.)  The only thing that worries Henry is that Jeff will not find someone.

Jeff has a guy that he fancies, Greg (John Polson).  He finally gets the nerve up and chats him up.  They go back to Jeff's place and as things start to happen, Henry walks in.  Rick is taken aback by Henry's openness to his son and him.  Everything seems to be going fine but Greg isn't ready for something more permanent.

Dad too has found someone, Joyce (Deborah Kennedy).  He's crazy about her and asks her to marry him.  She says wait three months.  On New Year's Eve, Joyce comes over and she discovers that Jeff is gay.  Let's just say that she does not take it well.

This is were the film goes a little astray.  Henry has a stroke and he is now bedridden.  One day when Jeff is taking Henry grocery shopping, they run into Greg.  Jeff decides that he is ready to pursue Greg one more time.

This is based on a play and sometimes characters breakout into monologues into the camera.  You get used to this right away.  It is a great look at a different kind of family, a functional one.

689073,5,6303619983,"I saw a portion of this movie on IFC, and I got on Amazon and ordered it right away.  This piece is well acted and well written, and with all the trite, Hollywood movies selling these days, that's saying a lot.

I also read the reviews and knew I had to write my own, even though I haven't watched the entire film.  To be a parent, a good parent, is to want what's best for your child.  Sometimes we want this so much, we go a little overboard.  Harry does this at times.  He understands that his son is going to have a tough time finding love in a homophobic world, but he desparately wants that for Jeff.  The asides to the camera are some of the best, and often comic, aspects of the movie.

Don't let some of the other reviews throw you off this movie.  Yes, the dad goes over the top, but the important thing about this characteristic is that it's real. Movies should reflect our real emotions and motivations.  No parent is perfect.  But this movie, with it's poignant writing and real portrayals, is pretty close.",1134172800,5,1020,4.315789473684211

689076,4,6303619983,"There aren't many movies that focus on adult fathers and sons who get along (I can't think if any others, actually)--so, the fact that the son in this movie (played by a young and adorable Russell Crowe) is gay makes the premise even more original. And Crowe's budding relationship with a possible love interest is also handled very well.

I especially like the fact that the two men are very sexual, yet also have things such as love and romance on their minds. (most gays in movies are either all about sex, or are nice and funny--but seem asexual) The father also is a well-developed character who embarks on a relationship of his own.

I'm not wild, though, about the talking to the camera bits--especially in a couple of instances when one character physically can't speak at all. That might work on stage (the film was adapted from a play) but it doesn't quite here. Still, if two of the scenes at the end--while not sad in tearjerker way--don't bring a tear to your eye, then your heart is made of stone!",1102636800,5,1011,4.549450549450549
689077,5,6303619983,"""The Sum of Us"" is a beautiful story about the unconditional love between a widowed father, Harry (Jack Thompson), and his openly gay son, Jeff (Russell Crowe). The movie shows a rare glimpse of a father's acceptance and willingness to try and understand his son's sexuality. When Jeff has a date, Harry is there to make sure his son practices safe sex, and when Harry has a stroke, Jeff is there to assume sole responsibility for his care, preparing his meals, helping him get around, and taking care of all his needs. They may drive each other crazy at times, but their unselfish acts of love for each other are heartwarming without being sickeningly sweet. I love this movie because it is honest, funny, wonderfully acted, hopeful, and real. Russell Crowe gives a brilliant performance early in his career. He is so believable you forget you are watching a movie. Jack Thompson is perfectly cast as his father. He is warm and funny. I recommend this movie to anyone that has ever loved or has ever been in love. It is a feel good movie.

Two thumbs up for Russell Crowe, all my respect to him!

689081,5,6303619983,"At first ""The Sum of Us"" seems like a familiar variation on the bossy parent-rebellious child theme, albeit a fairly entertaining one. The twist here is that the child (Russell Crowe) is a strapping gay man and the parent (Jack Thompson) is a widowed father entirely sympathetic to his son's lifestyle and need for romance. The early, farcical going has plenty of low-voltage laughs, as the well-meaning Thompson inadvertently breaks up a planned hot evening between Crowe and a new potential lover, and Thompson utilizes a dating service to meet an attractive divorcee. The two principals address the camera in knowing asides a la ""Shirley Valentine."" Halfway through, though, the story takes unexpected, darker turns and ""The Sum of Us"" attains a new level of profundity, becoming a moving meditation on the enduring strength of love, both familial and romantic, in the face of adversity. Crowe, caught here before the calcification of Hollywood superstardom, is loose, just buff enough, and charming; Thompson's turn as the father, by turns overbearing, loving and finally dependent on his son, is superb. Their fully-formed, utterly convincing relationship is what carries the picture. Highly recommended.",1067212800,49,1209,5.368421052631579

The story line at times is a bit hackneyed and sappy, but the warmth between father and son overcome any faults with the script.
The real success of this film is in the performance of Jack Thompson as the father and Russell Crowe as the son.  Released in 1994, this was Crowe's big break and he had to fight to get the part.  He gives a very funny and tender performance.
John Polson and Deborah Kennedy give admirable performances as Crowe's boyfriend and Thompson's fiancee respectively.

689212,5,6303619983,"Years before Russell Crowe won the Oscar for Best Actor for the 2000 film ""Gladiator"" and received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for the 2001 film ""A Beautiful Mind"", he starred in the lesser-known, 1994 Australian film ""The Sum of Us"".  Adapted by David Stevens from his own off-Broadway play of the same name, ""The Sum of Us"" is the story of a widowed father, Harry Mitchell (Harry Thompson, who played in the 1980 film ""Breaker Morant"" and the 2002 film ""Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones""), and his rugby-playing, 24-year-old gay son, Jeff Mitchell (Russell Crowe).  The two maintain a strong father-son bond, but each is searching to find companionship and happiness while continuing to contend with the death of Jeff's mother.  Harry, who is a ferryboat captain, does much of the cooking and housework for himself and Jeff, and is completely accepting of his son's sexual orientation.  Jeff, who works as a plumber, assists his father around the house that they share while struggling to find descent men to date.
One night, Jeff meets someone, Greg (John Polson), and brings him home on a date.  Harry's enthusiasm for Jeff actually having a date encourages him to benevolently intrude on their time together.  After Harry finally leaves, Jeff and Greg begin to share some intimacy, but a final interruption from the well-meaning Harry ends their date prematurely.  Greg, who cannot be open about his sexuality with his own parents, becomes uncomfortable in the unaccustomed, but accepting environment of the Mitchell's home.  Harry, who also makes efforts to find love, meets the divorce Joyce Johnson (Deborah Kennedy).  A strong romance develops between them, but when Joyce inadvertently discovers that Jeff is gay, she leaves Harry.  Shortly thereafter, Harry suffers a severe stroke that leaves him mostly paralyzed and unable to speak, but Jeff takes care of him.  Jeff hasn't forgotten about Greg, whose life has also changed.
Sadly, ""The Sum of Us"" received little attention in the U.S. following its release and no Oscar recognition, but it did win the Australian Film Institute (AFI) award for Best Adapted Screenplay.  It was also nominated by the AFI for Best Film, Best Editing and Best Sound, and John Polson was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, as was Deborah Kennedy for Best Supporting Actress.  Overall, I rate ""The Sum of Us"" with 5 out of 5 stars.  I applaud writer David Stevens and co-directors Geoff Burton and Kevin Dowling for their portrayal of an affirmative relationship between a father and his gay son in a bittersweet comedic drama.  The film sends a positive message to the audience regarding tolerance and acceptance, while simultaneously showing the pain endured when intolerance and misunderstanding are allowed to destroy.",1048809600,14,2776,5.083700440528634

Crowe's performance as a painfully shy young gay man looking for a REAL relationship,is at the same time, joyous and sad, but always eye opening and thought provoking. His ease in bringing this man to life is the reason I remain a fan of this actor. He brings so much to every character he plays, breathing life into small moments that send us home with little treasures to remember, maybe just a glance, a movement,a passing thought that flits across his eyes. He and the other main actor have a wonderful raport. I enjoyed tremendously the humorous asides of the father. I heartfully reccommend this movie, it is truly a keeper, one to watch again and again.

Jeff, played by Russell Crowe, lives with his widower father Harry Mitchell played by Jack Thompson. Much of the movie is about Harry's concerns that Jeff doesn't have a boyfriend. The repartee between father and son will make you laugh; the scenes of Harry's mother and her Lesbian lover shot in black and white will make you cry.
There is no much to like about this movie. Russell Crowe does a terrific job of acting in the intimate scenes between him and a man he brings home from a bar. The fine acting here should convince anyone-- should they need convincing-- of just how awful Will Smith's similar scenes were in ""Six Degrees of Separation."" No man as macho as Smith would dare to kiss another male on screen.

689251,5,6303619983,"""The Sum of Us"" offers comedy and heartfelt drama in spades, and features a young, charming Russell Crowe in an early role as a gay son living with his straight father, played beautifully by Jack Thompson.  Aside from being a character study that blends intimate family moments with universal truths ANY audience will relate to, the film dares to stretch further than most literate ""gay themed"" movies, and succeeds on all levels.
It also features several heartwrenching scenes that deserve a place in cinema history for being truly affecting, irrespective of issues or morals surrounding human sexuality.  Specifically, a relationship between two elderly women - Crowe's grandmother, and her longtime companion Mary - is etched in a powerful, human way that defies categorization.  The women grow old together until each of their families decide they can no longer care for each other and separate them against their will.  There are moments between the two actresses that will literally take your breath away - that is anyone who has a pulse will find themselves ripped apart by a sequence where Thompson describes what it must have been like for the two women to spend a final night together, holding on for dear life, knowing they only have a few moments left on the planet as a couple.  It's a brutal eloquent moment, rarely captured in film, and far surpassing the crocodile nature of tearjerkers like ""Terms of Endearment.""  If you've ever loved someone with all your heart, you will quickly put yourself in the women's shoes, contemplating what life would be like without your significant other at your side.  Unlike death, the separation of these two soul mates ranks among the most startling, affecting moments of pure sadness any filmmaker has ever fully realized.
This is a vivid look at relationships and families that deserves a wide worldwide audience.  The DVD is available only in Canada, but the video version is worth the price - not only for Crowe and Thompson, who shine in what could've been run-of-the-mill roles, but for the eloquence with which it captures true, undying love.

689254,5,6303619983,"For starters: This was a play before it was a film. Both came out of Austrailia where both are set. The play is brilliant (I directed a community theatre version several years back) and the movie remains very true to the play.
If I had to make a comparison, it would be to Steel Magnolias - and that's not really fair to either play/film. My comparison is not so much on the content as it is to the theme and the way it plays out during the course of each. The first act (and yes, films can have acts) sets up the characters for the audience. It allows us to get to know these people. This is an effective mechanism if the characters have any substance and bear getting to know. It is also the act where the humor is rapid fire (think the dialogue in Truvy's hair salon). In The Sum of Us, the first act is filled with heartwarming knowledge and second hand stories that will have you laughing yourself sick.
The second act (most plays today only have two) is tragedy lightly peppered with humor (the graveyard scene after Shelby's death - and here the grocery store after the father's stroke).
There is not a single bad performance by any actor in this film. In fact, it's full of top notch Austrailian actors of both stage and screen. It was this film that introduced me to Russell Crowe (who would go on to win an Oscar for Gladiator and deliver wowing performances in L.A. Confidential and others).
Russell Crowe as the gay son who has no luck in the romance department has a very cool father who, while he would prefer his son were straight, knows that what he really wants is his son to be happy. His father, in fact, constantly tries to push his son into a relationship with one or another of his dates. This has varying hilarious results. (In a second hand story we are told that the father interrupted the son and a date while they were ""coupling"". The response to the son from the father upon seeing this: ""Mind the sheets."").
I've already given too much away, although this isn't a film to be watched for surprise, but rather an elegant and eloquent character study that shows us that love and patience can truly conquer all.",1004659200,6,2136,4.410126582278481

Russell Crowe plays Jeff, who just happens to be a young gay plumber looking for a partner. The film gains credibility from the fact that 'Jeff' is not the stereotypical gay character and 'Harry', his father, is far from the stereotypical dad. Jeff does not want his life defined by one thing--just being gay. He wants far more out of life and a life partner. Both Russell Crowe and Jack Thompson deliver powerfull performances as father and son and will have you laughing and cheering both of them on in their pursuit of love; but perhaps shedding some tears as well, as their own love for each other is put to the test!

7851367,5,6303619983,"I have loved this little known Australian film since I saw it come into the video store where I was working in the '80's! Interesting to see the not yet so famous Russell Crowe and the brilliant Aussie actor Jack Thompson as a wonderfully supportive father to his gay son. I was lucky enough to begin to see all the talent that was in OZ by watching these little gems that snuck into the assorted lots of videos bought by stores going out of business and it opened up a whole new venue of fantastic actors, original storylines and new (to me) filmmakers. Not too long before this I managed to see ""Tim"" with Mel Gibson & Piper Laurie, another unique film and also a gem.
Russell Crowe did a great job playing a young gay man in Sydney who ends up meeting a young man (John Polson) who is very closeted with a homophobic hateful father of his own. He's truly shocked at how open, encouraging and friendly his new potential love (Crowe) has for a father in Thompson. To the point that he's not sure he can be around someone so accepting. Meanwhile Thompson is a widower trying to find love of his own, back before the Internet, and uses a videotape dating service and seems to have some luck.
It's hard to imagine these films being made in the U.S. even today, although you might compare ""The Sum of Us"" to the over 15 year old indie film ""Big Eden"" with Arye Gross & Eric Schweig. Another great little love story.
I do have to wonder if you'd see Russell Crowe taking the risk to make this film today if it was offered to him, knowing just how big a star he was going to become. For some reason I don't think he would but don't let that stop you from enjoying it like I do every time I see it.",1494806400,,1692,4.2253086419753085

7851371,5,6303619983,"I own all of the Australian and USA DVD editions of ""The Sum Of Us""  - which is just about my all-time favourite film. The Olive Films Blu-ray is clearly superior in terms of video quality - with the only annoying point being that it is a touch dark throughout. This was remedied easily by changing the brightness setting on my TV. The audio has a couple of very minor glitches which were not in the DVDs - and I probably notice them only because I've seen the film so many times, and I could do an A-B comparison between this Blu-ray and the DVD editions. The main thing is that there is a huge amount of more detail in the Blu-ray edition. There are no extras - which is a pity (but the only bona fide extra on any of the editions was on the first Kaleidoscope/Shock label (Australia) one - and that a poorly recorded brief video interview with actor Jack Thompson. In July 1994 I recorded our community radio program's presenters as they interviewed the playwright/screenwriter David Stevens and that 28 minutes gives a great insight into the characters and background of ""The Sum Of Us"" - to hear it via my archive search for: david stevens queerradio",1477267200,,1155,4.4739336492890995
