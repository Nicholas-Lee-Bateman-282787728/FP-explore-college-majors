2062557,5,B00024I2VI,"My first experience with Baby Einstein videos was almost four years ago with my first daughter.  Who screamed every time we tried to show her it.  I ended up giving it away.

Fast foward to this year.  My second daughter, who's 16 months old, has some developmental delays.  After chatting with moms of other babies with delays and hearing how much their kids enjoyed Baby Einstein videos, I decided to give it a second chance.  After staring at them all at the store, I chose Baby Da Vinci, as it talked about body parts and one of the milestones my daughter hasn't hit yet was the pointing to body parts one.

Well, first viewing - my older daughter, who just turned four, sat down and watched it.  The toddler showed vague interest...until the monkey puppets came on.  I thought she wasn't paying attention to it then suddenly heard her laughing hysterically at the monkeys.  After a few viewings, she fell in love.  Even my older daughter wants to watch the ""monkey video"" as we call it.  My toddler is now waving (something the monkeys do), something we couldn't do after literally months of us encouraging her to wave to us and showing her how to wave.  I also notice that she's become more vocal since she first watched this video.  (I have noticed she's a huge fan of music, so maybe it has something to do with the music?)

And one other bonus - my toddler was cutting molars and woke up just unconsolable one night.  Finally after a half hour of her crying and nothing working, I turned on Baby Da Vinci - as soon as the catapillar came across the screen, she calmed down!  Anyone who's ever been up with a really unhappy baby can appreciate that!",1097452800,86,1657,4.488294314381271
2062558,4,B00024I2VI,"I have all the Baby Einstein DVDs. Regarding the last two releases:  My son did not care to much for Baby McDonald the first few times I played it for him, however it eventually grew on him.  Baby Da Vinci was an immediate hit for him.  I am in the process of teaching my 18 month old his body parts so I think the DVD had meaning for him.  I look forward to Baby Noah being released in October.",1093996800,5,395,3.962025316455696
2062559,4,B00024I2VI,"I have all the Baby Einstein DVD's for my 26 month old son.  This DVD held his attention and he moves along the the ""Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes"" song.  This is the classic format, with the addition of French and English.  Thank goodness the original songs like the one that appeared in Baby Newton have gone to the wayside.",1093910400,4,328,4.433333333333334
2062560,2,B00024I2VI,"I have most of the Baby Einstein videos. The last 2 releases are the worst work yet. The latest video, Da Vinci looks like they spend 2 days on it, mastered it, and shipped it out. The bonus materials are a joke. The Puppet show, is a total of 3 x 10 second clips. The DVD plays repeated company branded intros with more plugs to their web site. The original videos were good, and now, it's obvious that it's just a cash cow for Disney/Julie Aigner-Clark, so the value has gone down the tubes.  If you are new to these videos, start with the first ones like Mozart, where they actually cared about baby development.  I would not recommend buying this new.",1093910400,78,655,4.360655737704918
2062561,5,B00024I2VI,"We don't allow our 14 mo. old to watch much TV, but we allow 1 Baby Einstein video every couple of days. Since we purchased this particular video, he goes downstairs and starts pointing at the TV and yelling for us to put it on. He LOVES Baby Da Vinci and we love to listen to him laugh and laugh. I started singing the ""Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes"" song the other day and he actually started pointing to his knees and toes!!! I think that this video is one of the best Baby Einstein's I have seen.",1092787200,4,502,4.13265306122449
2062562,5,B00024I2VI,"At first, I did not expect a lot, but this DVD is packed with what us bilingual parents are looking for!!  Once you choose which language you want to listen to (English, French, or Spanish,) the DVD plays in that language and the words are written in that language on the screen for you to read to your child. There is also a Bonus Material section which is packed with ""discovery cards,"" ""the five senses,"" puppet shows,"" and ""story time."" All narrated in the particular language you choose.  So you get more than just a DVD movie.

My 18-month-old loves it.  We play it in Spanish and he can identify his own body parts as he watches and listens. He points at his nose and eyes when he sees that section.

I have been waiting for a DVD like this a long time.  Thank you!",1092700800,9,772,4.289655172413793
2062563,5,B00024I2VI,"My daughter (currently 18 mos) does not watch television, but she has watched 30-90 minutes/day (spread out) of the various videos from the Baby Einstein collection.  Now that she is so eager to communicate with us, by husband and I are literally blown away by how much this series has taught her.

The first time she watched Baby da Vinci she was totally into it.  Touching her own eyes, ears, etc. and laughing at the puppets.

THANK YOU Baby Einstein for helping my baby laugh and learn, and for teaching me how to teach my baby!",1092182400,10,532,4.510416666666667

2062589,3,B00024I2VI,"I think I got this video too late. My son is 18 months old and this movie does not interest him. I will say it's slow but it does show a lot of exterior parts for children to get to know.....but the introduction to each part is terribly slow.
I think it just didn't work as my son could name everything all ready, and all ready knew the head, shoulders, knees and toes song. So he pretty much ignores this film when it's on so we don't watch anymore.
I wouldn't recommend this film as one of the better Einsteins, but I suppose younger children may like it?!",1404432000,,558,4.175925925925926

He actually watches the video and smiles at parts that he likes no matter how many times he has seen it. Big help for when I need to put him down to do housework.
The video has cute little puppets and lots of pictures of other babies and toddlers. It has very pleasant music and is pretty relaxing so your baby can fall asleep to it as well.",1341705600,3,516,4.222222222222222

I decided to play it this week for my son and it starts getting hung up within the first minute.

all in all, I am not particularly pleased with this purchase, but that's the risk you take when buying a used item I guess",1327622400,19,384,4.065789473684211
2062604,2,B00024I2VI,"i got this for my son when he was around 11 months because he loved this other baby einstein dvd that is for sounds I think. well he hates this one. he is super busy and this has lots of parts that drag in it, and he really loves the cartoon monkey and bee but the show more of real life pics in this which he thinks is boring. this is probably fine for those babies that are pretty content with just anything, but if you have a little explorer I would skip this one.",1320105600,4,467,3.9263157894736844
2062605,1,B00024I2VI,My baby finds the video so boring. He won't sit to watch  it because it doesn't have a way to keep his attention.

2062608,1,B00024I2VI,My son really enjoyed watching this DVD though not as much as his Baby Noah DVD from Baby Einstein.  It was just unfortunate that we were only able to watch it a few times before the DVD stopped working.,1295654400,11,203,4.205128205128205
2062609,2,B00024I2VI,"I was surprised to find that the dvd is pretty much without any spoken language.  After reading the description, with reference to language tracks, I expected to find words spoken along with the classical music.  That is not the case.  Puppets introduce each section of the dvd.  They say ""eye"" one time and show a picture of an eye.  Then there is a long track of classical music accompanied by images of eyes.  No repetition of the word. This is the case with each body part.

I interact with my toddler as we watch dvds, so I'm able to provide the verbal stimulation, but I was disappointed that we didn't get to hear other voices saying the word.",1292976000,18,650,4.4576271186440675

The very first one was Baby Beehtoven which captured her attention at the age of 3 months then we progressed into Baby Mozart, Baby Wordsworth and now she just recently got this video as a gift and just loves it.  The monkeys and Elephants are some of her favorites as is the Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes song.  Before the video she was able to point to her hands, feet, and belly but now she also knows nose, ears, mouth, and head.

2062620,3,B00024I2VI,"If you're going to buy a children's video, this a great video for toddlers.  I recommend it over other kids' videos because it is fun, not too fast-paced or cartoon animated, and the puppets are really cute.  My kids liked it.

Having said that, I have a beef with the title ""Baby Einstein"" and marketing this to babies.  It seems to imply that watching these videos is good for babies, which they are NOT!  These videos may be great for older kids, but definitely not for babies' brains.

After some research I found out that: 1) brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping. 2) for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%,  3) for every hour of television viewed daily at 4 yrs old, there is a significant odds increase for being a bully later on, and 4)consistent, heavy television viewing (more than 2 hrs daily) throughout early childhood can cause behavior, sleep and attention problems.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under 2, and no more than two hours of media (tv, videos, video games & computers) daily after age 2!  I think it's important for parents and caregivers to be aware of this so they can make better informed choices. I hope it encourages some people to limit television usage for babies and look for other outlets when possible.

For those looking to calm babies and build better brains, I recommend baby carriers because studies show that infants who are carried an extra 3 hours per day cry 40% less, and this effect is lasting over time!  Frequently held babies pick up verbal skills faster and develop better core muscle strength and balance.  Also, learning to communicate in sign language can reduce frustration and tantrums, accelerate language development and promote parent-child bonding in infants and toddlers.",1200355200,2,1907,4.906542056074766

2062624,4,B00024I2VI,"Of the six Baby Einstein DVDs that I own (the others being Mozart, Bach, Galileo, Monet, and Van Gogh) this one is arguably the most educational.  It correlates pictures of various body parts (eyes, ears, nose, mouth, face, hands, feet) with the appropriate word in 3 languages, and my 10-month old daughter enjoys watching it.  The puppet work is alright, although not as good as the puppet work in Baby Monet.  In the bonus material, the story about the monkey getting a bath is a nice touch.  Unfortunately, there is a part on the Spanish track when the woman says ""el agua es tibia"", instead of ""el agua est&aacute; tibia"".  This is a blatant error in Spanish; the difference between the verbs ""ser"" and ""estar"" is one of the first things taught in the first year of high school Spanish.  Indeed, the entire story is a very poor translation of the English track; it sounds as if someone who doesn't know Spanish translated each word individually using a dictionary.",1179705600,,969,4.704142011834319

Very doubtful! One of my big BE complaints is that they don't reinforce the spoken word with the images. They say the word once in three languages, and THEN show pictures, so there's no continuity between word and object. BEs other major flaw is that they show images only tangentially related to the concept they are presenting (such as showing the game Mouse Trap to introduce 'Mouse', how many babies are going to get that?)The puppet shows also tend to contain content that babies won't get, such as an elephant sneezing because another elephant put pepper on a flower. Overall, BE misrepresents the educational value of thier products to a frazzled, sleep deprived audience who just want the chance to get a cup of coffee for once. That said, it is soothing for babies, and I did enjoy the music. Buy it used.",1168905600,2,990,4.662857142857143

2062633,4,B00024I2VI,"So far the baby einstein vids have been overall pretty good. This video is better than some of the others I've seen, I feel, because it exposes the children to French and Spanish which our baby (6 mos) picks up on fairly quickly and thus keeps his interest. The other video he loves is the Wordsmouth one (go figure, another language video). This video has a few puppet shows with monkeys that are really cute, unfortunately our son doesn't like the monkey puppets very much so this one and the dolittle one in that sense don't peak his interest as much as the others. The only real complaint I have about this video is that it only shows a couple pieces by Da Vinci and with all the sketches/studies he did on body parts they really could've incorporated a lot more of his work into the video making it a real winner (and true to it's title) for us since our son loves artwork. I did notice some snotty noses but I hardly think my son is going to notice that so I don't see how it matters but I will say this about the children; they are hardly as cute as the kids in the earlier vids.",1165968000,,1086,4.225961538461538

While I know that watching tv too much is unhealthy, she will not even give regular television a second gland (which I'm glad about). However, there are times when I need her to be more calm like when I change a diaper, try feeding new foods, and right before and after naps. These movies have been lifesavers to me.

This one in particular is nice because it is introducing the body by identifying the same parts on babies and animals. I love to give her a bath and do the ""head and shoulders, knees and toes"" song with her and point to the different parts. She also loves to stand in front of a mirror and we'll point out our eyes, mouths, etc. This movie is a great introduction for babies and toddlers to understand their body parts.",1141430400,5,888,4.317365269461078

She's fascinated with other kids so that made it more entertaining with her.  She knows ten body parts now which I'm so happy about.  We love this video!",1138752000,5,472,4.076086956521739
2062647,5,B00024I2VI,"My son turned 4 months old right after Christmas - when he got Baby Da Vinci as a present.  I bought it for him because he is completely in love with the television set, and I figure if he's going to watch it, he may as well watch something that's good for his development instead of just whatever happens to be on.

The first time I put this on I was AMAZED.  The video isn't meant for a child as young as my son, but I was hoping that the music (he LOVES music) would keep his attention.  And boy did it!  The whole video did!  He sat there in his little swing and just stared at the set.  He laughed at the puppets, he was even ""talking"" to the babies on the video - babbling is more like it, but he only does that to things and people he likes - so I'm impressed!

So far I am truly amazed by this video.  We have two Baby Einstein CDs that we listen to in the car on the way to the babysitter's house in the morning and he enjoys them as well.  I will definitely be purchasing more BE videos & CDs for my boy, and would recommend them to any parent as well!",1138233600,5,1062,3.8976744186046512

I like that there is little narration. It gives me the opportunity to reinforce the body part and point without totally competing with the TV.  It allows us to interact more. When my daughter sees the catepilar come on, she shrieks with excitement. The DVD extras could be more generous. Overall this was an excellent kids DVD",1135641600,3,449,4.6
2062649,1,B00024I2VI,"This is my first and only Baby Einstein DVD.  I won't be buying another.  Where is the narration?  Are all Baby Einsteins this lacking?

First complaint - not enough narration.  For each segment, the narrator speaks the body part one time in English, French, and Spanish, then repeats one time in English.  Then we see about three minutes of images of that body part.  The narrator speaks the word one more time.  Then a puppet intermission, then the next body part.  It's about four to four and a half minutes from the beginning of one segment to the next.  During that time your child hears, ""mouth, la boca, la bouche, mouth, <three minutes>, mouth.""  That's it.  How can you learn to speak a first (or second) language without hearing it?  How about a little repetition?

Second complaint:  too few body parts.  The back cover of my copy says it covers ""head, shoulders, knees, toes, and more.""  I know that's a song title, but I thought we would move on to the stuff you don't hear all the time like teeth, knees, etc.  No, you get just the basics:  eyes, ears, mouth, nose, face, hands and feet.  Thanks, but my child didn't need help on those.  I can't believe that's it.

If you want to look at pictures of body parts with music, get this DVD.  If you want your child to learn the names of body parts in English, skip this DVD and sing the song instead.  If you want your child to learn body parts in French or Spanish, try Brainy Baby.  It covers at least this many body parts plus many other topics.  Its narration repeats each word several times and later reviews them in a different order.",1135296000,76,1601,4.43448275862069

She has been equally fascinated with Baby Noah and Baby MacDonald (which became a favorite).  However, Baby Da Vinci has her truly interacting along with the DVD as opposed to just clapping, pointing, and bouncing about in excitement!  It is so cool to see her learn to pat her head, pull her ears, rub her knees (her newest discovery) and explore my face for my eyes & nose!  Her favorite part is the Head Shoulders Knees & Toes sing-a-long.  She practices finding the correct body parts while I dance along with the DVD.

I love that it teaches the various body parts which will be a great educational tape when he does get a few months older.
