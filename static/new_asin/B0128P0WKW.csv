7343768,5,B0128P0WKW,"Captivating, spellbinding, and impossible to stop between episodes.
The story of a small rural English village as WW2 unfolds. Foyles War set the bar with sets, story & costumes on WWII home front drama and the ladies of HOME FIRES HAVE MET THAT CHALLENGE. Well done again Masterpiece. From the Julie Summers book Jambusters, 2013, and Summers can be spotted as a cameo character in episode 2. Filmed in Cheshire England, the story setting as well, it is nostalgic perfection.
Cast is overall great, allowing many memorable characters to unfold, too many to mention. Leaders of the Womens Institute with their banter and one-upmanship are brilliant played by Francesca Annis (Restless) as Cameron the outgoing head, and Samantha Bond (Downton Abbey) as new President Barden. Dr Campbell (Ed Stoppard Upstairs, Downstairs) and wife Erica (Frances Grey Vanity Fair) portray an important couple with as much finesse as the Simms, a writer & wife battered couple (Mark Bazeley The Queen) (Claire Rushbrook The Mill Mutual Friends).

SDH SUBTITLES for all 6 hour episodes. NO bonus materials except ads.
[1] AUG 1939 pre-war fears and friction causes the Womens Institute (WI) to divide. Past President walks out, followed by many of the higher class members, expecting collapse, or a plea to return. Viewers are introduced to many of the town locals. Blackberry jam becomes a WI saving project.
[2] SEP 1939 War has begun. Great Paxford WI new leadership proposes plowing the cricket pitch for food production. More characters unveiled.
[3] NOV 1939 war continues and more sons and husbands opt to fight. The new Paxford WI pushes for everyone to do their part. Both love and anguish prevails in local marriages.
[4] FEB 1940 The WI plans for a town air raid shelter. A conchie is exposed. A first fatality for the village of Great Paxford.
[5] MAR 1940 Rationing, a blind evacuee from Liverpool, a mourning bride, and personal triumphs. Paxford citizens doing their bit for the boys, except for a white feather. Secrets exposed.
[6] MAY 1940 Frances fall is anticipated. Ambulances are the new WI target. Some threads close, others left open for a 2nd season as the sky fills with planes depicting the front is ever closer.

I must comment on the delightful, soulful, music of Indigo Girls for the theme song. It can be found as a download single Theres still My Joy; & on the album Holly Happy Days. Mine is in the mail to listen to until season two of HOME FIRES is available.",1446940800,46,2475,4.890476190476191

7343771,5,B0128P0WKW,"Positively addicting, riveting acting, plot has twists and turns in it that keep one glued to the screen. It's as good as anything I've ever seen like this!

So glad I have the DVDs to savor after the broadcasts are complete. I'll go back and re-watch them for maximum effect!

Brilliant in all ways!",1446508800,30,300,4.537037037037037
7343772,5,B0128P0WKW,I loved the history this presented. Every episode had me eager to watch the next episode. It detailed the emotions that came up in real life situations. Some emotions were harder to hear but that is reality. Homosexual behavior was shown and was done so in a diplomatic way. Hard to watch but not left out in order to show every aspect of how it had to be dealt with.,1445904000,38,367,4.257142857142857
7343773,4,B0128P0WKW,"I hate that it comes out after 4 episodes have already aired on PBS. I see that some of you posted your dislike of the "" homosexual"" couple. Well, I assure you that I like them tall dark and handsome, but it does  not bother me one bit. I rather think that it was part of history as punishment for homosexuality was extreme. If you recall a recent movie about code breakers, it details the horrible treatment one had to endure to "" cure"" homosexuality. If you want history, you got it.",1445817600,35,485,4.271739130434782
7343774,1,B0128P0WKW,"This movie had me going & ready to purchase right up to the point in Season 1 Episode 4 where they just HAD TO PUT IN A HOMOSEXUAL COUPLE!!!!!! Why was that necessary or required? What people choose to do in private is their choice why am I being forced to watch it in my home? A warning of some type should've shown an Adult Content advisory at the least. It currently has an NR rating. Also, according to my grandmother who was an adult during this time period, that nice girls did NOT go & play in the hay with boys without getting a name for themselves & everybody knew who they were & definitely didn't marry them. I see many of today's ""standards"" being shown as common place, they weren't. Very disappointing all the way around & not a true retrospect of the times.",1445817600,43,772,4.294520547945205
7343775,5,B0128P0WKW,"This 4  hour series (six 47-minute episodes) was produced in 2015 by the British commercial network ITV  the reason it is less than an hour. It aired on PBS in the US in a somewhat edited edition. ( I didn't see the TV version but there are  some expletives.).  And the package says Full UK-Length Edition

It begins in a small English village in 1939 just as Hitler is coming to power and war is evident. The town has an air force base but most of the young men were leaving for France to help the war effort. In the first 30 minutes we are introduced to the main characters  and there are quite a few  and we lean that the town is so small that it has one mailman (on a bike), one butcher store, one church and eventually one fallout shelter will hold all the towns residents.  Like every small town (and every melodrama) there are people with secrets and some folks make foolish decisions that will impact both their life and the lives of others.

The series is actually perfect for binge watching or at least watching Disc 1 straight through (2  hours) and then the second.  For a movie about war there is no real graphic violence as the action all takes place in the town, which is now left with mostly the women, children and men who served in the last war. And there is discussion of sexual identity as well.

The cast includes many actors youll recognize from other BBC and ITV series. I can never remember their names but their faces are very familiar. And Id like to point out that music theme that plays at the beginning and end of each episode is wonderful. It is way too modern for the period but it seems to work and will stay in your head at least an hour after the music stops. (Update: I found the recording of the theme streaming here: [...]

Now I promised no spoilers but I feel I should let you know that the series was greenlighted for a second season which began filming in September. This BD/DVD goes up to Spring 1940 and the war is far from over. Many of the story lines are tied up, but not all (just as in life). Some relationships are just beginning while others have ended and there are few unknowns. I don't want to dissuade you from watching the series by pointing out that it will continue. The time spent watching this show will be rewarded by watching some superb British actors tell the story of Britains war efforts (as seen by the actions of those left at home.)

There are English Subtitles but it doesnt appear to have closed captioning.

The release date is October 27, 2015. I was provided an advance screener for an objective review.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

I especially felt for Pat Simms and her struggle for a modicum of independence from her husband. Wonderful acting. I ordered the second season immediately after watching all of the first.",1501459200,,414,5.0144927536231885

Oh well, some probably found the realistic treatment of the control freak who abused his wife as too close to home for the current political crowd.

Am very upset it was cancelled after only 2 seasons.",1494288000,,284,4.480769230769231
7343812,4,B0128P0WKW,"I purchased both seasons.  It really helps to be able to use the sub titles that you can access with the DVD's.  I also watch the shows on my PBS channels and perhaps it's just me; but I lose much of the dialogue without those subtitles.  The show itself is a great look into the trials that were commensurate  of that period of history in a country that was literally thrust upon them in a Country under the guns.  It makes one gratefull that this country was not directly under that type of pressure.  I'm a very old man, but I clearly remember that period of time",1493596800,,566,4.242990654205608
7343813,5,B0128P0WKW,Good show.,1493164800,,10,4.5
7343814,5,B0128P0WKW,"This is Season 1 of a 2 season series about a group of women in a small English town and how they live their lives pre-WW II and then during the war.  It's kind of like the series ""Cranford"" only a century later.  These women are strong and resilient.  Their stories do not intertwine but they are all members of the Women's Institute and that is what forms their bond of friendship so while they each have their own story, the series also focuses on them (along with minor characters) as a group.

This is beautifully done: the clothes, the hair, the set decoration, the town, everything....it feels like you're watching it in real time during WW II.  Francesca Annis is SO fabulous in this and such a great actress;  and Samantha Bond (Lady Rosamund Painswick from Downton Abbey) plays her part brilliantly.  Claire Rushbrook (Mrs. Simms) is just incredible playing a woman who is both mentally and physically abused by her husband.  All around, the acting is perfection.  These actresses (and men actors) just absorb themselves into their characters.

This series also confirms how all British people just came together during the War because they had one common goal.  It was representative of how a small village all knew each other, helped each other, celebrated their joys, and cried for their sorrows.

If you're a member of Amazon Prime, you can view this Season 1 in its entirety thru Prime Video.  You won't be disappointed.",1492905600,2,1435,4.784552845528455

7343816,5,B0128P0WKW,"This production is simply outstanding!  I am interested in the characters, their problems, their dilemmas...Their ""ordinariness"" demonstrates the heights and depths to which all human beings can rise and sink given the force of tragic circumstances.

The WW2 environment was well done and the story line is good,  I resent having social issues forced on me through screen/tv.  I watch a series for the drama/story not when a writer cowardly uses a good story to force a social issue on othersfor this reason one is the best i will go.",1488240000,,413,4.061728395061729

7343829,5,B0128P0WKW,"I'm a Brit, been in US 39 years. This is a truly great series, I gave it 5 stars .  I was  born just after the war in a small village in Devon England.  I agree with most of the 5 star reviews, but if you loved season 1,you are going too love season 2 even more. I have an all Region player so that I can order the British Dvd from Amazon .co.uk. I'v had my season 2 DVD for over two weeks now. The season 2 disc for the US won't be out until April 2017. You can get an All Region player from Amazon.com. All prices low to high. In season 2 disc one, the rescue of 3000 Czechoslovakian soldiers from Dunkirk France,End up in Great Paxford Most of the villagers welcome them. There is so many new story lines, some make you sad and others make you very happy.  Well with that said, ITV Studio that put it on Tv has now cancelled it, even with very high ratings.  It ended with  a  HUGE cliffhanger, me and most of  the British woman in England are furious. the series writer Simon Block is trying to get a new tv company to take it on.

Most people see the US as the true winners of WWII which isn't necessarily wrong. However, the British people really deserve a ton of credit as well. If they hadn't have held on as they did, the world would most likely be a very different place. That is why I really love a well crafted show set in that period.

We were just sorry to see it end.  Would love to have seen many more.  These amazing character actors actually ""became"" the people they were playing!  Totally realistic.  Provided a wealth of information about what was going on ""at home in England"" during WW 2.  We will be watching this over and over in future.  Without a doubt, the best DVD series we have watched in years.",1471219200,,540,4.835164835164835
7343852,5,B0128P0WKW,"What a wonderful series showing what one group of women did for the war effort and how that work was tied to changes in the social and economic situations of women in Britain. Wonderful to see Francesca Annis and Samantha Bond together. They are a remarkable pair of antagonists and both grow as people during the series. We don't see enough of middle aged and elderly women on tv or in film. They are backbone of many societies and deserve more screen time.  I think it was remarkably short-sighted of ITV to cancel this series after the second year. There is no reason they could not have played this out to match the duration of the war, just as Foyle's War did.",1470787200,2,665,4.450819672131147

It is availabe only for region 2. NOT for North America!!!!! What kind of fool made that idiotic decision??!!",1468108800,,446,4.753246753246753
7343856,5,B0128P0WKW,"I thoroughly enjoyed this great series!  There are some familiar faces from Downton Abbey and they brought their wonderful acting talent to this series as well. It is a wonderfully plotted story that happens during WWII in a small English town. The different families and people depicted all have very interesting avenues that makes this series a must see.  Very good! It is totally believable and the characters are deep and interesting. I reminded me of a Julian Fellowes write, but I don't know who actually wrote this without researching it.  It's worth your time to see.  You will be hooked.  I surely hope there is a season 2 on the way.

Which was not the case so I paid 20 something dollars for program I watched on Amazon prime  that I paid for in January. I double paid for same  show .

7343861,5,B0128P0WKW,"I am in Downton Abbey withdrawal and asked a British friend of mine to recommend a movie she liked similar to Downton Abbey.  She recommended ""Home Fires"" and I am so glad she did. Not quite as good but the music is fantastic as is the scenery. The plot will suck you in. Can't wait for season two.  A must see. Historical and for the entire family.",1465603200,,349,4.1940298507462686
7343862,4,B0128P0WKW,A lovely piece of nostalgia.  Between the ages of 4 and 9 I lived in London during the blitz.  It is indelibably printed on my mind and this movie captures perfectly the atmosphere of the times down to the smallest detail.,1465516800,,222,4.390243902439025
7343863,5,B0128P0WKW,"Incredibly good and very true to the period.  Loved all the characters, the story lines, and the closeness I felt for the people as well as for England.",1465344000,,152,4.428571428571429

7343876,5,B0128P0WKW,"This series is about the people in an English village as the Second World War rages. The young men have enlisted and all are away except for the older men, children and women. I could not miss one episode. Many of the actors I know I've seen before, but the one I know for her excellence is Francesca Annis. Years ago, she played Lily Langtry in a series for PBS.
 I was pulled in by the love, heartbreak, and everything you can imagine that goes on in a village. There are twists and turns in the plots. I won't mention any of the plot lines, just get the DVD and enjoy! British television triumphs.",1462320000,2,600,4.2631578947368425
7343877,5,B0128P0WKW,"Yet another British classic! My husband and I watched the first season on PBS, and we were hooked immediately. And because I'm far too impatient to wait for season 2, I decided to order the DVD set of season one. There are many familiar faces, including Samantha Bond (Lady Rosamund on Downton Abbey) and the spectacular (and far too underrated) Claire Rushbrook (who plays Brenda Blethyn's white daughter in the movie Secrets and Lies). Great acting, great writing, and great direction.",1462147200,3,487,5.0246913580246915

7343882,1,B0128P0WKW,"Undoubtedly the most contrived, man-hating program I have ever had the displeasure to watch.  If your scene is watching and listening to a half dozen women bitch at everything under the sun and have to be in charge of all aspects of wartime in a small English village, then this video is for you.  For me, it is predictable and degrading to women.  It is also a waste of talented actresses such as Samantha Bond and Francesca Annis.  The multi-starred reviews really suckered me into buying this--I shall be more careful in future.",1461024000,5,531,4.67741935483871
7343883,1,B0128P0WKW,"An extremely contrived 'soap opera' geared to aggressive women who despise men and the wars they provoke.  Great cast but their hearts are not in their roles as they, with their extensive careers in TV, can sense the banality of the script.  I feel for Francesca Annis and Samantha Bond because they are so far above this predictable plot it shows in their performances.  This DVD is solely for acute women's lib proponents whose minds are as narrow as the writing and directing.",1460246400,4,479,4.746987951807229
7343894,5,B0128P0WKW,Home Fires is an excellent British programming series to watch and I so hope the new season shows up shortly. I would recommend anyone to watch it and enjoy it as much as ideas,1458345600,2,176,4.205882352941177

7343896,5,B0128P0WKW,"What a treat to see the prewar world of Great Britain from the perspective of the women who, in the words of Samantha Bond's character Frances, would be the ones to be left at home to count the cost of war in terms of lives lost and people devastated by the violence.",1457654400,2,267,4.153846153846154
7343897,2,B0128P0WKW,"OK and done well. However, I didn't really like the characters and will not buy season 2.",1457654400,,89,4.294117647058823
7343898,5,B0128P0WKW,I loved this series and hope they will do another season.  It was well-acted and a good story.,1457136000,,94,4.222222222222222
7343899,5,B0128P0WKW,"Ladies - you MUST watch this! You will be so inspired as this story, inspired by the facts of history, unfolds in the lives of women in Britain during the WWII era. What can we do in our day to rise to their examples? In today's unstable economy, should we plow up our back yards to grow food for our families and communities? Why not? BBC: We MUST have a follow-up to find out what happens next in the lives of all these characters we so readily come to know and love! Fantastic acting, directing, editing, and most of all: script!

7343902,5,B0128P0WKW,"Another wonderful PBS series. It doesn't take long into the series for one to know the dynamics of the village, its people. How they come together at a wedding, despite their differences, and the same with a funeral. The Village is there for each other and together they will survive the impending World War II. There are people you love and few you really don't like at all, like real life, but with a bit of British Historical Flare.",1456790400,3,435,4.518987341772152
7343903,5,B0128P0WKW,"I watched this first season on PBS, and decided I had to have it. A good story line about the women left behind during the war. I would highly recommend this.",1456617600,2,158,4.129032258064516
7343904,1,B0128P0WKW,"The BBC (like Disney) has one script:  woman are so smart and brave and right; men are so clueless when they're not just plain evil.  This narrative is not true.  This narrative has been getting old for at least 20 years, but they still keep cranking it out.

Also, they go in big for anachronism.  The church was central in British villages at that time, but it gets completely written out of the script.  Lies of omission.

This is fantasy, not history.",1456358400,8,455,4.475609756097561
7343905,5,B0128P0WKW,"This series is captivating.  An interesting time period just before WWII in a small English village, the human interest stories and history make this worth watching!",1455926400,,165,5.346153846153846
7343906,5,B0128P0WKW,A wonderful series.  I will enjoy it multiple times. It has a  great depth of characters and stories,1455840000,,100,4.5

7343908,3,B0128P0WKW,"Let me say right off the bat that I loved movies and books that are set in World War 2.  I really wanted to like ""Home Fires"" but after watching this I can that I am kind of sorry that spent my money on this movie.  While there were parts of movie was entertaining, but watching a character being hit by her husband was a fun for me. Also, did they really needed at a lesbian storyline?  Overall ""Masterpiece: Home Fires"" was okay but this movie that I will be keep in my library.",1455321600,,480,4.085106382978723
7343909,5,B0128P0WKW,A must watch for anyone who loves a good British production and one that is based upon history.  I simply didn't want it to end.,1454630400,,128,4.12

7343911,5,B0128P0WKW,"Saw this series on PBS: loved it!! Purchased the dvd version and love it just as well with one exception. I know of one scene that was on the PBS broadcast that is not on the dvd. The scene in episode one , where the new school teacher is getting interviewed by the local board committee. I even purchased a region 2 set from Canada and this scene was also excluded from the dvd version. Strange , because scenes are usually deleted from PBS broadcasts but are intact on the commercial dvd volumes. Other than this, I really enjoy the series and have read that a second series is in the works!",1454544000,,593,4.303571428571429

7343913,5,B0128P0WKW,"Great series... enjoyable in its own way. what we enjoyed about it was that it was women dominated (actor wise) and depicted the era of WWI from the perspective of those left behind, which were mostly women who had to cope in ways that were often creative, crazy, maddening, and controlling.",1454284800,,291,4.7254901960784315

7343915,5,B0128P0WKW,"After having seen the miniseries on PBS, I purchased this as a Christmas gift for a colleague at work who hadn't seen it, and she loved it as much as I did. The cast is stellar, the story lines are realistic, intricately interwoven and emotionally affecting without being treacly.  The period setting is also superbly accomplished.  It literally ends ""up in the air"" with a second season obviously in the offing, with the series likely intended to last throughout the war years. As for the item itself, it came in mint condition and I was told it played without a hitch.",1454112000,,570,4.633663366336633

7343917,5,B0128P0WKW,"Rachel Hurd-Wood is absolutely stunning in this BBC series!  Not only is this series very interesting from a historical basis, but we get to see the most beautiful actress in the UK give the performance of her life!  Rachel shows us the joy of getting married, as we see her in her gorgeous wedding dress, and then she melts our hearts when she loses her new husband in a tragic accident.  Truly, while there are fine performances by other actresses in this series, young Rachel Hurd-Wood steals the show!",1453939200,,505,4.651685393258427

7343921,5,B0128P0WKW,"A good overview of the challenges facing the British at the beginning of WW2, with interesting sub plots.  Unlike some British productions, the dialog was understandable.  So often. I will spot something that sounds interesting, but the British accents are so thick, that I do not understand what is going on.",1453593600,,309,5.03921568627451

7343930,3,B0128P0WKW,"Home Fires (I keep wanting to call it home fries!) is a story about the people of a small British town in WWII. As a historical piece, it captures the problems of the times with war being a huge influence in how life changes. There are personality struggles, practical issues, romances, and casualties. The cast is convincing. Somehow it doesn't ever get really interesting though. If a series is great, I can't help but binge watch it. It took me two weeks to get through 6 episodes of this. The plus side is I finished it. It wasn't horrible, just not ""must see"" tv.",1452643200,,568,4.471153846153846
7343931,5,B0128P0WKW,"A deeply moving show, impeccably acted, with a score I can't get out of my head.  I can't wait for the next season.  Will have to order another copy as my mother who I lent it too shows no sign of returning mine anytime soon.  A truly addictive show.  Drama, heartwarming scenes, everything you could want and more.",1451952000,,315,4.379310344827586
7343932,3,B0128P0WKW,"This is a great show.  I watched this on Masterpiece.  I also purchased the PBS DVD version to view again.

I would not have purchased it had I known.",1451952000,18,247,4.125

7343934,5,B0128P0WKW,"I just watched my DVD (this same version), and there are at least two scenes from of episode 1 left out of the version that was broadcast on PBS:  the scene where the teacher is being interviewed for the job and the scene where Steph tells the WI that she has blackberries on her land and the WI can pick them.  Why are these scenes missing from a DVD that says UK version?  The episodes on these DVDs are all @ 47-48 minutes long, but the versions that were originally broadcast on PBS were longer.  There's a scene missing from episode 2 as well:  the scene where Mrs. Barden tells Clare to go check out Spencer's girlfriend at the telephone office.  I'm disappointed that this set, claiming to be the UK version (which I presumed would be an unabridged version), doesn't have complete episodes as broadcast on PBS!  Does anyone know if the full episodes are available anywhere?",1451606400,11,880,4.531645569620253

7343942,5,B0128P0WKW,"Masterpiece Home Fires is one of the best series I have ever seen showing what's it like at the beginning of a war your country is getting involved in and sending the men, family and friends,  to serve their country.  I enjoyed watching it so much I was disappointed when I reached the last DVD.  I am going to watch it over and over again since I know there is a lot that I missed in watching them for the first time.  I am pleased to be able to add it to my ""movie"" collections.  Thank you Amazon for offering such great movies and series!",1447113600,6,541,4.114285714285714
7343943,5,B0128P0WKW,"'Home Fires' is not about military operations---it is about the people who lived through that horrible period in an English community and how they met the challenges the war forced upon them. All of them! That includes a former /lesbian couple, young heterosexual lovers, spousal abusers, adulterers, black market cheats, those caught in historical class prejudices, mothers who wished to hold their children close, conscientious objectors, as well as the altruistic--all of whom you find in this fine production. World War II was never as neat and clean as the movies made during it wanted the home front to believe.  Being human in a time of crisis is a messy business.  Like life in general, it is full of greys---not black and white.  This series  understands that.  It kept getting better with each episode.  Powerful performances by all.",1447027200,44,843,5.072463768115942
8725619,5,B0128P0WKW,"This was an amazing portrayal of several women whose lives were affected and changed by WWII in the small, rural town of Paxford in Great Britain at the beginning of the war.  Each live very different lives, a farmer's wife, a housewife abused and severely controlled by her husband, a butcher's wife, a late teen to early twenties servant girl, a teacher struggling with her attraction to women, a doctor's wife and their two daughters, an accountant who somehow gets trapped into illegal dealings with thugs trying to control her, the nosey busy-body telephone operator, and  the two strong leaders butting heads over who's the best leader in the ""Women's Institute"".  They all change from struggles tearing them apart pre war, to working together for the betterment of all as the war threatens to end life as they know it.  Their lives all intermingle as is so true in small towns but what comes out is the great love they have for one another as their men and sons leave one by one. True, it's more a ""Chick Flick"" as women play the starring rolls.  Mainly the story revolves around their local ""Women's Institute"", a group similar to our Junior League whose purpose is to better the lives of those in their community. I loved it, and my greatest fear is that after Series II it possibly has been discontinued, with the second series ending with many tales left untold.  I sincerely hope Masterpiece will continue this series as it grips you like Downton Abby and so far, you just must find out what happens next.",1535673600,,1517,4.684210526315789

8725624,5,B0128P0WKW,"Both seasons of Home Fires have the depth, excitement, and engagement you'd want from any full length movie. The fact that this is a 12-episode TV show, and not a big-budgeted Hollywood extravaganza makes it truly amazing. Don't be frightened off by the fact that the sponsoring TV network, ITV, made an egregious error by cancelling the series after two seasons. That does not reflect on the show, but on the stupidity of the overpaid ITV executives.

Rest assured that while the cancellation of the series so early in its life is a disappointment, the two season that did air, and did make it onto Blu-ray, are stand-alone, and brilliant. You WILL be wanting more! But you will also be somewhat satisfied with what we can get, because what you get is amazing, complete in and of itself. You won't short-changed, as such, nor be missing critical pieces to enjoy all of that, ""as is.""

In North America viewers may find it comforting to know that thousands of Brits protested to ITV about their idiotic cancellation. The show is that good, and that beloved.",1524441600,,1057,4.739130434782608
