53333,4,0783228252,"It is a good thing that I got a chance to see this movie on Disney Channel (after seeing the first two from 1986 and 1991, of course). The new character whom they call as Cholena (an Indian mouse) is so cute, but for me, sooooo FORGETTABLE!
At least whoever came up with this movie should have made it less violent. (That is why I omitted the one star enough to to make it a genuine 5-star.)
After all, it's a movie good enough to watch at your own risk (while you can see it at the video store anyway).
P.S. Did the mice really move back to New York after settling at the frontier in the 1991 movie ""Fievel Goes West""? If there's a web site to tell us the reason, then PLEASE do so!",1018569600,,683,4.029411764705882
53334,5,0783228252,"FIRST IMPRESSIONS: Ok.  I honestly have to say that before I watched this film, I had some doubts and apprehensions.  Ever since NIMH II I told myself that I would avoid sequels like the plague.  I even THOUGHT that it was going to be NIMH II once again.  But I hunkered down and tried to enjoy it and suprising as it sounds, I did! PLOT: Pretty okay as plot lines go.  Everything is as it was put in the editorial review.  Fievel and Tony stumble upon a treasure map, and instead find an underground Native American mouse civilization.  Meanwhile, Papa Mousekewitz has to deal with the daily grind of late 19th century labor and finds the hope and courage that he thought he had lost.  The movie has morals all right, but not forced into the viewer.  It deals with fear and prejudice and mixes it with hope and dreams.  It wasn't the most formulatic plotline in the world either.  This was actually kindof original and well conceived. ANIMATION: The animation was one of the things that made me anxious before seeing it.  Fortunatly, it was a familiar animation group that I've seen on Tiny Toon Adventures and Animaniacs.  It wasn't Bluth, but still it was very well done for a direct-to-video.  The animation itself makes up for the few toony gestures in the movie because I've seen it on Tiny Toons all the time. CHARACTERS: I'm glad they didn't ruin any of the characters for me.  Fievel was way too cute in this one!  Voice and all.  Tanya was a plus on the character roster too.  Her design was like that in the first movie and for that I'm grateful.  NOT to say that I didn't like the Fievel Goes West model, but she's cuter in this design.  They brought back Tony, who wasn't there for the second movie, so that's also a plus!  He's pretty cool.  I'm glad they didn't ruin Tiger, like a certain other company did to a certain crow in another sequel!  He was more or less the same as he was in the first two movies, but didn't get very many lines though.  The new characters didn't come off as formula, especially not the villians.  Cholina was the best of the new characters.  She was really sweet, especially on Fievel. MUSIC & SONGS: They just started with a song after viewing Mannhattan Harbor.  Frankly, that song was quite relieving, because it's the sequel's way of saying, ""there ARE songs in this!""  But there were only three, and for this I'm grateful that Universal didn't saturate the sequel with them.  The songs were pretty good, even the villians' song ""Friends of the Working Mouse.""  ""Anywhere in our Dreams,"" sung between Cholina and Fievel, was my favorite.  They did use the music track from the first movie thought.  At first this annoyed me, but they integrated it with their own track pretty well.  Later, I welcomed the classic music along with the new. FINAL THOUGHTS: All in all, this was a pretty good movie for a direct to video sequel.  It's a good movie that deserves a fair chance before judgement.  YES the second movie was shrugged off as one of Fievel's dreams, but I think his innocence and cuteness makes up for that.  It was neat that they kept all cats out of this movie except Tiger, so in that respect alone it probably is truer to the original movie.  But again, see it for yourself.  You may be as pleased as I am!",982972800,8,3265,4.480475382003395
53335,3,0783228252,"Being a video-only release, AT3 doesn't stand on a par -nor it pretends to either- with the former two movies about the Mousekewitzes saga. Japan-outsourced animation is typical Saturday morning TV fare and  storyline is more or less on the same level. However, for anyone who has  come to love Fievel and his pals' antics across the years, those pitfalls  won't matter much. And kids won't complain at all either - the adventure  story plot and vibrant color palette present will keep them well engaged  and amused to the end.",957744000,,527,4.811111111111111
53336,3,0783228252,"On it's own, this was a good movie. Unfortunately, though, it was the third part to an excellant series. The quality wasn't as high as the previous American Tail movies. The animation was, well, bad. Fortunately  the few songs were good (especially ""Anywhere in our  Dreams"").  The story was also OK. It deals a little with racism (the Americans don't  like the other mice because they are Natives) and how the Europeans took  over the Natives' land. This is perhaps something that children should  watch. They'd enjoy it for sure. Like I said. It's good on it's own, but  only on it's own. Worth the money anyways....",953251200,,618,4.719626168224299

53364,4,0783228252,"The first film was decent, the second film was a bore, but I usually think of this one even better than the first. Maybe I don't watch this series as much as I used to, but I still think of this as the best in the series. I like the colorful Saturday morning animation in this movie ( much better than the Disney Direct to video crud). Also, this movie in the beginning somewhat indicates that the events in ""Fievel Goes West"" was a dream (Thank goodness). This film teaches about the unfairness of greedy bosses in the American sweatshop, and why immigrants came to America in the first place. The Native American mice are wise, and the mysterious adventure that leads Fievel and the crew to them is well done. I like how this is the only one in the series not to have villainous cats. And speaking of villains, the factory rats are pretty good villains. I really liked their song ""Friends of the Working Mouse"" and it was the only song that caught my interest. ""We Live In Manhatten"" was fairly okay, and ""Anywhere in your Dreams"" was sweet but a little too soft. My only two problems with this movie ( though not as bothersome as the ones I had in the first) were Tanya getting a little crankier, and McBruisce cruelly beating up the worker ( did he die?). Wasn't it the police's job to stop cruelty? Oh well, it's a nitpick. Nevertheless, I consider this one the gold trophy of the American Tail series.",1406505600,,1407,4.415384615384616

53399,5,0783228252,"I love this chapter in ""The Adventure Too Big for One Movie"". I was 6 when this movie came out, so maybe that's why i prefer it over the original 2, (also why i prefer 90's Disney over ""the Classics"") but still watched the first 2 enough to know the story. I watched this one more than any of the others, and as stated in my title i never cared for Feivel Goes West all that much. It's not a bad movie by any means, it's still better than cartoons nowadays (though unlike one reviewer here I love Disney). There's many reasons, but mainly it was a recycled plot of the first movie. But this is a review of number 3, not 2 so, back to the point.. I won't tell you about the plot. I really liked the story, it was interesting, and actually heavy for a kids movie i thought.. Reminded me of the first movie with its plot, how it tells kids about a hard subject in a fun, enjoyable way. And yes, Feivel does mention having a dream of going to the west, suggesting the previous chapter mentioned above was just a dream. I however have read online that this means this film and the next (and last) take place before the second film, so its foreshadowing in a jokingly way. But i prefer to think of it as a dream, which makes part 2 a little more enjoyable for me. The animation is cheap and not as great, but this was direct-to-video so i don't see why people are so hard about that fact. But Dom DeLuise is back as Tiger, and Tony, who was left out of Feivel Goes West (another reason for my dislike of it), is back too, with a bigger part at that. Bottom Line, your kids will no doubt love it, and you should like it better than the other awful kids movies im sure you are also subjected to. Just don't expect it to surpass the original, and remember its straight to video, and you will be pleasently suprised.",1331683200,5,1806,4.162857142857143

53403,2,0783228252,"Plain & Simple- An American Tail & Fieval Goes West (1 & 2)...are two of the greatest cartoon movies to date...Why? Because of Director Don Bluth. i.e. (The Land Before Time.

The Original 1st Bluth movie surpasses all of the others.)

Stick with the originals - Only try'n to Help!",1122595200,9,282,4.62
53404,4,0783228252,"For various reasons, I refuse to watch Disney cartoons, and until my two-year-old figures out how to get somebody to rent them for her, she won't see any either.  The *American Tail* series is one of the few great options left.
This installment is neither as well drawn nor as musically satisfying as its predecessors, but it may well be my favorite cartoon movie now.
Of course, that's because I *like* the ""political correctness"" that one reviewer derided.  I think that immigrant laborers and Native Americans, struggling for their place in an unforgiving City, make far better heroes than princesses and princes waiting for their divine rights to be recognized.
If workers'/aboriginal rights seem like kind of a drag to you, then you may want to head over to the *Lion King*; I'm sure Disney will be happy to take your money.  If you'd prefer that your kids grow up with the (true) idea that America's story is more complicated than it first appears, this movie will be a great start.
And it's not like your kids will be bored with it.  Since the DVD arrived three days ago, my daughter has frequently arisen from her nap already asking for 'mouse.'  She likes Fievel and Papa just plenty, and I like the fact that she still has no idea who Mickey is.",1082246400,8,1255,4.635135135135135
