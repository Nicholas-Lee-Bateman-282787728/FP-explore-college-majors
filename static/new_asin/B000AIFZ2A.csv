8723233,5,B000AIFZ2A,"Bears, Too Close for Comfort is an excellent documentary that shows actual problems associated with an over abundance and mismanagement of wildlife in NJ due to politics interfering with science.  Tom Phillips is to be commended for keeping an even keel with this highly controversial issue.  This movie is a must see for all NJ residents and other states with similar problems.",1122422400,,378,5.080645161290323
