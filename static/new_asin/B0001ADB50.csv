1983802,5,B0001ADB50,"To those that have never seen this british crime series I say buy it you won't regret it, I had seen it off and on on PBS for years but this was the first time I came accross the entire collection. Robbie Coltrane ( from Harry Potter Fame) is an outstanding talent in the series and it is done so well, for those that don't know him, he has been a very popular stage and screen actor in Great Britan for years .",1207872000,5,411,3.963855421686747
1983803,5,B0001ADB50,"Great wind-up to the series. The casting is perfect. As always, the stories are thought-provoking and gritty, but told with humour and compassion. Buy all three series, and watch them in order, or you'll miss the carefully crafted progression through the main characters' lives.",1180656000,5,278,5.340909090909091

1983805,5,B0001ADB50,"How can you be angry, enthralled and perplexed all at the same time-watch this series. I need to hit the pause button just so I can catch my breath. Highly entertaining",1173744000,4,168,4.451612903225806

1983807,5,B0001ADB50,"Cracker is great but I need more!!!!!

I have watched these seasons over and over!!

Hopefully there are more seasons on their way cause who can live without it. Once you watch this series only A Touch of Frost can equal it!!!",1156809600,2,226,4.357142857142857

1983809,4,B0001ADB50,"Another terrific British mystery series. Robby Coltrane is so effective at portraying ""Fitz's"" flaws one wishes the character would just put a gun to his head to put him and his audience out of misery.",1123891200,3,201,4.771428571428571

1983841,3,B0001ADB50,"Seasons 1-3. These comments address several seasons, so clearly good enough to keep watching. I like the idea (sharp psychologist helping police) but after binge watching (yes, I did!) I noticed a disturbing trend in the female characters and their relationships. I'm not particularly sensitive to that, so it took watching several episodes in a row - but it's there. The writers hate women? Times have changed that much? Not sure, but once noticed it kinda permeated the show and made it less enjoyable which was a bummer since, again, the idea is quite cool. I'll skip forward a bit and see if the more current episodes portray women in an ever so slightly more realistic light =)",1425340800,,682,4.788135593220339

1983845,4,B0001ADB50,"As the episodes continue on, the violence and pathology escalate.  People's behavior becomes more and more extreme and improbable.  That said, this is still a delightful series, far above most TV crime material.",1400371200,,211,5.363636363636363
1983846,5,B0001ADB50,"Wonderful, all of these series. Great actors like Shaun Evans Roger Allam, Robbie Coltrane, backed by by a fine ensemble of actors in the best tradition of British theater. We are spoiled by this level of quality. So give us more.",1394409600,,230,4.634146341463414
1983847,4,B0001ADB50,"Cracker reminds me somewhat of the character who plays The Mentalist.  Difference is that his character is very interesting in the story - complications at home with his wife, children, and girlfriend, plus his bad habits - gambling and drinking, for example.  I am somewhat bothered by the fact that he give a profile on a killer, having so little details from the story - he is a psychiatrist.  This seems a little unrealistic, but watching his character and his relationship with the police is what intrigues me.",1393113600,,515,4.829545454545454
1983848,5,B0001ADB50,I love the taught suspense and psychological overlay. Robbie Coltrane is well cast as a dysfunctional genius who struggles with his own family..,1374537600,,144,5.304347826086956
1983849,5,B0001ADB50,"Yep he solves the most convoluted mysteries, but can't see his own life get wrung out like a used dish rag. Don't you just love a Hero that can see everything except that tree in the middle of the road? Anyway they took him as far as he could get from home and set him down in Hong Kong. Even with people that speak English he still needs an translator. Nothing new there. Coltrane shines thru even in an ending that might not be what you expected.",1373068800,,448,4.160919540229885
1983850,4,B0001ADB50,A good murder mystery from a different perspective.  The main character is a police psychologist and has a number of faults that make for entertaining viewing.,1372032000,,159,5.115384615384615
1983851,4,B0001ADB50,"You love him or hate him, or love to hate him.  The characters in this show are very real, which is refreshing.  They are ALL flawed in one way or another.",1368144000,,155,3.967741935483871
1983852,5,B0001ADB50,"I bought the first one and couldn't stop after that, his acting is terrific, you'll love the entire series. Drama with some comedy thrown in, great!",1362960000,,148,4.730769230769231
1983853,5,B0001ADB50,"This series was recommended to me by a friend from the UK and I was somewhat fearful it would be in the starchy (but still often great) Masterpiece Theater mold. Wrong. This is a tremendous series and this is its best season. Cracker is the UK term for a criminal psychologist and Cracker as played by Robbie Coltrane (Harry Potter) is one of the most memorable psychologist detectives of all time. Coltrane is a big hearted, big bodied, hard headed, gambling, drinking real person. His flaws are not overplayed, but you get a whole person. The writing for this series is at a very level so that every episode is original and unpredictable. The only clear comparison I can think of is ITV's, Vincent, which is also not to be missed. While Robbie is effective at ""cracking"" criminals, he not a magician of the more typical US mold. Interestingly, there is some real criminal psychology underpinning the series. As an added treat, the sound tracks to the episodes are unique and very tasty. Absolutely first rate.",1356480000,,1011,4.75
1983854,1,B0001ADB50,"Already have season 2,  you stated you were selling season 3, so I bought it.  But you sent season 2...
I'll keep it, and give it away as a Christmas gift.

I'm still looking for season 3

CRACKER is a great show  but your service only rates one star.

Happy New Year",1356307200,,267,4.038461538461538
1983855,4,B0001ADB50,"Second and third seasons a must--then see if you want the early one.
More modern PBS series are slicker--Zen, Wallander, Insp Lewis, but for its day,
Fitz was like a forensic  Freud.
Still not on the same level  as any and all the Jeremy Brett Holmes series but, worth a try.
Certainly better than his Harry Potter act but he finally got to make dough!!$$",1354752000,,355,4.446153846153846
1983856,4,B0001ADB50,"Many people don't like the character being portrayed, but even they love the show. It's unique--which isn't easy to pull off in these times. I personally like the character. He's deeply flawed, as are we all.",1329523200,,208,4.805555555555555
1983857,5,B0001ADB50,Crime psycologist who has many bad habits.  However Fitz understands the criminal mind better than the UK police.  This is another UK product worth seeing.,1319500800,,155,5.16
1983858,5,B0001ADB50,"Excellent service.  The items arrived quickly and I totally enjoyed all the episodes.  I wish they had more seasons to buy (I've bought all of the cracker seasons I could find on the amazon website, and hated for them to end.)",1238025600,,226,4.487804878048781
1983859,3,B0001ADB50,"First of all, I want to say straight out that every Cracker episode prior to this one definitely deserves 5 stars. This one, however, is the final compilation (in UK, it's released as series 1 and 2-- not divided into 3 seasons) and, it's a complete let down to the earlier episodes. White Ghost, the finale (not including the 2006 episode that also has nothing to do with earlier episodes)is the poorest conclusion for a character-driven series that I've ever seen.

During the series, we met Fitz, a brash, alcohol-guzzling, chain-smoking psychologist. He is brilliant. He understands everything going on around him and can read a person like a book. Watching him is an experience. The stories are so well-written and the characters so intense, that this entire series (up until what is sold here as the Third Season) is a joy.

But, the third and final season just doesn't tie up any of the loose ends. It gives some suggestion, but nothing really. And, by Fitz' mention of Penhaligan in the last episode here, any question that you might have felt had been answered was obviously incorrect.

In the episode just prior to White Ghost, we find out Penhaligan has given her resignation. We find out how Cracker truly feels about his wife (well, kind of-- as he walks out of the hospital leaving her standing alone). And, that's that.

In the last episode, we never see any closure. And, Fitz calls home, too, and his wife lives there! And, he asks for Penhaligan to be sent to Hong Kong to help with his case, and she can't come. But, that's all. So, we never find out how these three are now interacting with eachother and that's the biggest letdown after all this character buildup from the prior episodes.

The last episode here is a good episode-- but it belonged somewhere in the middle-- it deserved to be a much earlier episode. For those of us who watched these faithfully, I believe this is a letdown.

Obviously, I still recommend watching it if you've watched the other 2 sets.  It's acted well, the writing is excellent, and the plots are tight.  It's just a let down since we want some relationship closure.",1230681600,17,2121,4.6675603217158175
