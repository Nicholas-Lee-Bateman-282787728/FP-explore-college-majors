2725980,5,B000M7G0FK,"I viewed this DVD at the request of a friend for possible use with young women at our church. Though I have been married for 17 years I found it refreshingly honest, revealing, and powerfully honest about what God requires of the child of God while waiting for Him to bring you your mate - or not.  These Godly women show us all how to be the women God has called us to be whether we marry or not!  The women are dynamic, assured, successful, beautiful, and Godly, thus their stories and journey can help us all while we wait on the Lord, and inspire the unmarried to trust God's Word and plan for their lives.",1186617600,,610,4.25
2725981,4,B000M7G0FK,"I was introduced to the SOULMATE dvd this past Wednesday during bible study.  The Pastor showed it to all the single women and men of the church and truly, it was an amazing experience.  Even life altering.  SOULMATE seeks to peel back the layers of dishonesty that shroud many single Christian women and gives you a peek into their real thoughts and desires for a husband.  I found the dvd to be filled with practical solutions and each of the participants who speak, with particular mention of actress/comedian Sherri Shepard, entralled me and taught me things I never knew about myself.  There are also very uncomfortable statistics that will open your eyes to the truth of our world and, hopefully, inspire you to act differently and seek God.

HOWEVER, there is one caveat that stops me from giving this dvd a full 5 stars.  SOULMATE is geared toward two groups of Christian women: single-no-kids, and married.  For those who are single WITH Children, there is precious little to guide you.  Single mothers deal with many of the same issues that married women do, except that they do it completely alone, with no help.  That isn't addressed.  But it should be.  Particularly as the statistics given state that 70% of all African-American children are born into single parent households.  It would be helpful if they'd acknowledge that with more information, in much the way Feona Huff of Solo Mommy Magazine does.  In any case, the dvd is still a must have and perfect to share with your friends who don't realize that, in searching for a husband, they are searching for something seemingly more elusive than the Loch Ness Monster.",1181260800,8,1636,4.817204301075269
2725982,5,B000M7G0FK,"This DVD engages in transparent dialogue about the metamorphosis experienced in the season of singleness. I recommend that single sisters throw a ""Girlfriend's"" party to view, discuss and affirm each other. It is packed with food for thought and nuggets of truth. I loved it!!!!",1179792000,2,278,5.2
2725983,5,B000M7G0FK,"Soulmate is an insightful video.  It address many of the issues facing single (and married) Christian women of all ages but, especially women of maturity.  Those who have been in the struggle for a while.  Those who have had life experiences.  There is a strong message to be learned without being preached to.  This video will become part of our women's bible study.",1173398400,8,367,4.761904761904762
2725984,5,B000M7G0FK,"This documentary is truly a blessing. After watching and listening to Christian women discuss openly their desire for a husband and their journey it was a true eye opener. It really helps you to realize that GOD's time is not our time regardless of how beautiful, smart, or talented you are. What we want and what GOD wants may be 2 different things. This movie is a must see.",1171238400,,376,4.463768115942029

2725990,3,B000M7G0FK,"This is a Christian based documentary, that depicts dating and celibacy among women of African/Black heritage, so the opinion is a one-sided one, but in all honesty I believe women of all cultures should give it a watch, if only for a good conversation piece, Rather or not all these women were honest is not really my concern and most contrary to some reviewers belief were being honest, it is always hard to accept another's opinion it seems

Great for Church gatherings, especially Church women's leadership groups, women gatherings, it does not bash you over the head that you are a sinner, or some evil doer, just gives you an ideal of how to relate or adjust to a situation that you might have not thought of yourself, it also has some interesting facts and statistics in there, also get your boyfriend to watch along with you, be nice to get a mans views on this issue",1391126400,,875,4.573248407643312
2725991,5,B000M7G0FK,"Highly recommend! this DVD. It was informative, moving, and made me feel validated that I am not alone in trying to find ""the one"".  It is not an easy process, but you have to be content with yourself, first and foremost.  If you don't love you, how can you expect anyone else to?  Some of us blossom later in life, and we may make a lot of mistakes along the way, but that's OK. Don't be discouraged.",1390262400,,401,4.181818181818182

2725998,5,B000M7G0FK,"This movie definitely is inspirational and gives a glimpse of African-American women in the 21st century doing great things.

2725999,2,B000M7G0FK,"This documentary is for single older ladies only. Not very interesting...it just stated the obvious. With the exception of the author, she gave really good advice. I am married but I have had this same conversation with every single woman I know. Everybody knows if you play around in your 20s: dating jerks, being selfish, spend most of your time career chasing or basically not taking yourself serious there is a good chance that you will be single in your 30s and 40s+. I do think it is absolutely heartbreaking and truly unfair that sometimes black woman have to pick between being highly educated/independent/successful or finding a man. But unfortunately that's just the world we live in. Maybe one day that will change for our daughters. In summary I think there are good black man, you just have to know when to ""hold them & when to fold them"".",1358294400,,852,4.724832214765101

2726003,4,B000M7G0FK,"Good documentary. SoulMate provides an honest look at being single and Christian. I appreciated the variety of topics covered and the mixture of expert opinion and thought. SoulMate is a great movie for singles and in particular successful singles that are asking ""why am I still not married."" This is a honest perspective of singleness among African American Women and successful women in general.",1343606400,,398,5.234375
2726004,5,B000M7G0FK,"This is the most refreshing and frank discussion I have ever seen on the Single/Married issue.  I appreciate the openness and honestly of those interviewed.  I appreciate that everyone wasn't saying the same thing like what usually happens in a discussion about singleness.  I appreciate that men were also able to weigh in on the issues and the wise godly counsel that to two male church leaders (pastor & a bishop)were willing to impart.  And lastly, I'm especially grateful for the willingness of Mrs. Andrea Wiley (though married) to make this documentary for her single sisters.  I really appreciate the way it was handled - quite tastefully done!!!",1339372800,,654,5.018518518518518

Some things that I want to happen, such as marriage and a family might not happen. So what do I do? Get upset or get to living and creating depth within my life and others that will be an inspiration? Never stop loving and living your life because you are not married or have not found your soulmate.

2726006,4,B000M7G0FK,"Well, I expected a movie, but rather this was a video with various women from all backgrounds and status.  Each spoke about their current relationship, if applicable, wating for the ""right one"", and the plight of single black females.  However, I won't take anything away from what the video was designed to do.  It encourage women to allow God to provide all of your needs, and trust that He will do just that; further, don't settle for just a pair of pants, and don't give away your ""cookies"" for free! This was also very thought-provoking, causes closes self-examination and so much more.  There is hope for ""all the single ladies"".  I am glad I made the purchase.",1312675200,,667,4.666666666666667
2726007,1,B000M7G0FK,"This movie wasn't at all what I expected.  It's more of a documentary, not a movie with a story line.  It was about a study of single christian women and each one of them discussing their problems and/or joys of being single and trying to live a christian life.  It was a group discussion, sort of like a therapy session.  Not worth the money.",1311379200,2,343,4.3125

2726010,3,B000M7G0FK,"THIS IS NOT A MOVIE. It is a documentary about why African American women are not getting married, how they cope with it and deals with the primace that the more educated an African American woman, the less likely she is to get married. The women in the documentary are BEAUTIFUL and successful. Women are going to have to exercise their options with other races and cultures (except Africans). It also talks about the lack of unavailable/ overlooked black men.",1293408000,3,461,4.775

2726012,3,B000M7G0FK,"Well put together because it builds anticipation and you keep on watching, but it does not fulfill like it's title implied. I could not relate. I bought this DVD knowing it wasn't a movie but based on the five star reviews I expected it to be more. The frankness from each woman may help others but I've seen that when a woman is determined, desperate, and willing to settle even the lessons learned in this DVD will not be remembered. The truth of the matter is that most of the woman who shared don't seem to realize that if they were totally surrendered to Jesus Christ, Living for Him alone, and everything is about intimacy with Him, they would be complete in Him. Being complete comes from only HIM alone, and that completeness causes you to lack NOTHING!!!!! I shook my head in agreement with everything that Bishop Ulmer said; others said words of wisdom also, but he saved the day and caused me to give this DVD three stars. I've prayed for the Lord to guide me to single women I can lend this DVD too. I believe GOD can use it for HIS glory. That's what are life should be about--HIS Glory!",1279238400,,1100,4.397058823529412

I knew nothing about this movie, but I'm so glad that I purchased it!  It's deeply compelling and truthful to the MAX!  I highly recommend this dvd to women who have never been married and even the one's that have and faced disappointments.  It's a very good movie/documentary.",1277942400,,407,4.676056338028169
2726014,5,B000M7G0FK,"I have purchased several copies of this video and I always keep two copies on hand. I love the Lord and I am celibate according to His Word of presenting my body as a ""living sacrifice"". I share this with mature friends who are embracing the same reality with God in their lives, and also, young ladies at my church who may experience peer pressure in highschool, or college. It's just a wonderful way to let others know that they are not alone in trying to live a life for Christ. It also allows black women to understand that being smart, educated and powerful doesn't mean that you have to succumb to not being feminine and allowing a man in your life. A man of God will love you and help you remain true to the Word of God, not try to persuade you againist it. You are God's glory and should carry yourself in that way. God will bless you with someone who is equally yoked with you and your beliefs, or God's mandate rather. Don't give up. God is faithful and will reward your faithfulness. I am still waiting and I do live a very, fulfilled life in Him. Great friends, great career, and awesome God! God created man and woman to be together to glorify Him, as they prosper together in this world. As couples, all races, we have a mission to live according to the Word of God to show the world that there is truth, peace, prosperity, and a reality in serving a true and living God.

Now, it turns out that it is very intresting because it is not just talking about being single but about success, sex, children, feelings, marriage after 40, children, life, pain by real women some known and unkown in their own words.

Bottom line if you are single and over 30 you may appreciate this documentary and how these women feel and what they are going through as they explain their different journeys.",1243468800,26,509,4.644444444444445

However, if you are not a DEVOUT Christian...in the stereotypical sense of the word then don't purchase this video. The majority of the interviewees are from the same demographic, meaning they work in the entertainment/publishing/motivational speaking fields. Most of the women, if not all, were highly educated.

However, I didn't know I was in for a lecture on celibacy. I think the preacher who spoke about what women have to relinquish if they were to get into a relationship was very insightful. But the women were not representative of me nor of any of my friends.

I gleaned from this video my own interpretations and it had nothing to do with religion. But it helped me to see that I'm not alone in this world of Single Black Woman.

When I showed the DVD the women in our group were totally engrossed in it, noone wanted me to turn it off and it has already been making the rounds as everyone is borrowing it from me.  This was the most honest discussion I have heard from Christian Women about their struggles.  It was encouraging to those of us who struggle to hold on to our virtue.  As a single mother trying to live my faith daily I was disappointed that our point of view was not discussed, to often Christians with children and living single are overlooked in books and movies about living single and saved.  However despite that one issue this was one of the best investments I have made in my DVD collection.  The frank talk and bearing of souls will help all who are open to it.
