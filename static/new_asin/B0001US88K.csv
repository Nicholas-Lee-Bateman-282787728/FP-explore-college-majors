8267208,5,B0001US88K,"This is an outstanding dvd; the sound quality is amazing (we all know how dodgy that can be; just listen to the Barrington Levy dvd from San Francisco). Some of the most amazing roots reggae footage ever shot; Bob Marley singing while a very young Stephen and Ziggy skank onstage, and incredible clips from Lucky Dube, Third World, Barrington Levy, the Skatalites, Ziggy and the Melody Makers and Aswad to name a few. This is one of my favorite alltime reggae dvds, ranking right up there with the Reggae on the River dvd. Enjoy!!!",1169942400,2,531,4.659574468085107
