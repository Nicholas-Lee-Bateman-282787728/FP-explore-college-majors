8198701,4,B000R34V3M,"A good story with some swear words.  The teacher shows he cares about the inner city blacks in his class and gets results.
Unfortunately the copy of the movie I got from Netflix and the copy I bought later BOTH don't play right.  They stop often, and then the dvd
continues, which means you miss dialogue.  Thus the dvd is defective.  This is a shame, because I like the story.",1507075200,,377,4.3428571428571425
8198702,4,B000R34V3M,"This film is the African-American version of ""Stand and Deliver."" This has been re-released as ""A Hard Lesson."" Jeff Solomon (Jonathan Sale) is a parole officer who is asked to teach a class of 12 troubled unruly teens how to read. He has to buck the teaching system as well as having to gain the trust and respect of his class, all who have criminal records.

Jeff is white and Jewish. His wife Marsha (Heather Tom) leaves him because she wants him to be in a job that makes more money. Jeff is also unusual in that he was adopted and raised by African-American parents in a far fetched story. He gets advice from his dad (Glynn Turman) who was also a teacher. Meanwhile there are robberies going on in the neighborhood.

Heart warming ending in a film that has border line acting. Like so many produced African-American films this one contains excessive amount of dialouge and discussion about the problems facing the black and Latino communities rather then just let us experience it. 3 1/2 stars.

Parental Guide: F-bombs, a grope scene, married couple briefly in bed, no nudity.",1341619200,4,1083,4.689473684210526
