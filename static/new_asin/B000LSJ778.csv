I just thought it was going to be more in depth and better.  Don't waste your money on this video.  I still don't know what the Paleo diet is???",1199923200,,317,4.114754098360656
8471872,1,B000LSJ778,"I boght the DVD and found it disapointing.  It had a lot of ""filler"" such as the history of dumb-bells and stuff that you really never wanted to know.  As far as the DVD, is shows Burke going through his workout which is basically the old Metzer workout.  It breifly touched on diet, suggesting to follow the Paleo diet. I paged throgh the book at the bookstore and decided against buying it because it is way overpriced $40.00?? and really not much in it beyond the video.",1169769600,3,473,4.413793103448276
