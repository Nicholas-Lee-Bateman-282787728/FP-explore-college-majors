I do like busy beavers free version so i thought dvd would be better or at least same quality but i will have to return item due to above. I never open level 2, only opened level 1 then decided to return.",1511222400,,316,4.031746031746032

8691458,5,B00QJ4UB3M,"Our toddler has fallen in love with these learning videos... I mean, he has a craving for knowledge & will stop whatever he's doing (& special request daily) to watch Shapes, ABC's, etc. Much to my dismay, I can't stand them haha & blame my husband for discovering these on YouTube, but there's just something about the colors, slowness & the way the videos are made... We feel these really helps reinforce what we're already teaching him! He's already singing his ABC's to the end, spells words just looking at the letters, counts past 10, finishing simple sentences & on track with many 3 year olds in the basics, & he's only 2 yrs, 2 mo. old! We think these videos are an important component to his advancement... Even when I want to claw my eyes/ears out (no disrespect, Busy Beavers, you're definitely doing a great job!)",1421798400,2,826,4.625850340136054
