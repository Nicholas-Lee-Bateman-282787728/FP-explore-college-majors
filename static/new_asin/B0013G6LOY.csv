8314321,5,B0013G6LOY,This is one of my favourite episodes ever. I have enjoyed Peanuts for a long time and how can you not with it's great sense of humour and clever storylines those kids definitely have their heads screwed on right. You don't get quality like this animation anymore. A must for all Peanut Fans ,1503964800,,291,4.490566037735849
