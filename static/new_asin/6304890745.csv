The songs are not as catchy as the Disney version but the story is much better with beautiful, stylized animation and great voice acting. The only drawback is I can only find it on VHS, oh well.",1362268800,,303,3.903225806451613
8625094,4,6304890745,"If you haven't already, I recommend you read the book before watching this movie; you'll appreciate it better. The greatest aspect of this film is the animation and artwork; the animation is not as fluid as Disney's version but it's much more dynamic and the artwork much more stylized. This version follows Kipling's Mowgli stories much more closely than Disney's version (although not ""almost down to every last detail"" as another viewer posted). The one gripe I have is the dubbing; it's quality is inconsistent. Some of the voices are excellent; such as Sher Khan, Bagheera (which in this version is female), and Kaa. However, Chil sounds like a witch (instead of a bird of prey)and the songs feel awkward (even more awkward than Disney songs). I don't know how closely the Russian dialogue follows Kipling's language but the English translation presents many lines that are out of place. I imagine this was done to add levity; it is a children's movie after all. Environmental sounds, however, are excellent. It would be awesome if this was restored and transferred to DVD with some changes to the voices and dialogue. Still, this film is excellent and should be watched by anybody that enjoyed Kipling's Mowgli stories (which is everybody).",1251417600,2,1246,4.9951923076923075

Maugli follows the actual Kipling book almost down to every last detail. The animation is beautiful, and the characters aren't just hydrogenated, packaged products, especially manufactured for public consumption.",1120694400,,426,5.173913043478261

It teaches a great deal about  self discipline and strength of character,  incredibly important lesson's for our children.  The graphics are unusual and  fantastic,  I recommend this to all young and old,  enjoy  :-)",950486400,,278,4.76595744680851
