Last Hero in China

THIS IS THE UNCUT VERSION OF THE MOVIE! This is not the retarded

Xenon or that other generic company version who decided to call

this movie Deadly China Hero and cut the film down 20 minutes!

This film is 110 minutes long! Picture quality is no different

from the other versions! Meaning it's got some degration and

stuff but overall watchable!

Heroes Among Heroes

The is the only version you'll find in original language w/

imbedded subtitles! The Columbia version (ironicly called Fist

of the Red Dragon) has no Cantonese version! Columbia version

has better picture and english dubbing sounds old school which

is fine! But I rather have World Videos version cuz it's in

original language!

Instant Kung Fu Man

A descent kung fu movie! But not one of Yuen Wo Pings best

films! He did the fight choreography for this film! The picture

has the video transfer quality, meaning faded picture, white

speckle and all that, but it's again watchable!

OVERALL: I love this collection to DEATH! World Video is known

to me as for making poor quality DVD's!

1. Everytime the movie goes to the next chapter, the film pauses

for an instant!

2. An hour into the film, the film will stop for a second then

the movie time clock will start over and the film will continue!

3. Their extras and their creative menus suck but that's no big

deal!

As far as I know, Last Hero has non of these problems! Heroes

has the #2! And Instant has #1 & #2! But these are the kind of

problems I can get over and I still love these DVD's!",1121644800,3,1613,4.462068965517242
8280848,4,B00006IUL9,"Last Hero in China ROCKS!!!  Yuen Wo Ping at his finest, adn Jet Li is a good as he is in Tai-Chi master.
Instant Kung Fu Man, is kind of a yawner.  Get Iron Monkey 1 and 2 instead!!
Overall, 22 bucks for three DVD ain't bad!!",1050364800,,226,3.7872340425531914
