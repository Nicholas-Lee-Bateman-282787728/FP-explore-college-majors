6071800,5,B00GC2KI2U,Happy to own this now with my four seasons of Alice. I have all my FLO. I also loved the remaining series of ALICE. People just complain to much. They gave some FLO time on the final eposide of Alice. I wished when Vera got married they would have invited Flo and Belle to the wedding. Flo was my favorite too but the rest of the characters on Alice was just as funny. Vera and Mel cracked me up. I want to own the whole series.,1385769600,5,428,3.988372093023256
6071801,5,B00GC2KI2U,Once Flo left Alice the show was never the same and yeah Flo wasn't the best spinoff but it's still enjoyable and rarely seen in syndication so it's a good DVD set to add to your collection and a chance to enjoy more of Polly a holiday as Flo.,1385596800,13,243,3.979591836734694
6071802,3,B00GC2KI2U,The biggest mistake they did was to let Flo leave Alice. She's a wonderful character and fun to watch but I'm not too crazy about the Flo series. Spinoffs are tricky and I feel that this one just didn't work. Still it's great that they release this series so we Flo fans can get a chance to see it.,1384992000,15,298,4.067796610169491
6071803,5,B00GC2KI2U,"Polly Holliday is who made ""Alice"" the successful series it became.  Anything Ms. Holliday is in is a treat.  It's great to finally be able to see all the episodes of this series, which like another reviewer wrote- it's never on t.v.  Thanks for the laughs, Polly!",1384646400,19,264,4.574468085106383
6071804,4,B00GC2KI2U,This show is never on TV so it's great that the complete series (29 episodes) is finally on DVD.  Lots of guest stars.,1384473600,11,118,4.130434782608695
6071805,3,B00GC2KI2U,"Flo: The Complete Series aired originally from March, 1980 through July, 1981. After four seasons as the feisty waitress at Mels Diner on Alice, Flo Kiss My Grits Castleberry (Polly Holliday) got her own place to run. Passing through her Texas hometown while on the way to take a hostess job in Houston, she impulsively bought a run-down old farmhouse she remembered from her youth, and set out to make it a successful business. Not used to being the boss, Flo had difficulty running the place, renamed Flos Yellow Rose. Earl, the bartender, hated working for a woman, Farley was the obnoxious mortgage holder, Les was the house piano player, and Randy was a mechanic who worked at a garage next door. Another character was Mama Velma, Flos mother.

This spin-off finished in Neilsens Top Ten for its first, short (6 episodes) season, but when it faced tougher competition in its second-season time slot, the ratings plummeted and the show was canceled. In an attempt to create a comedy ensemble, the producers incorporated a colorful group of supporting characters, but none really hit comedy pay dirt. Ms. Holliday carries most of the shows through her sunny personality and amusing dialogue. If you think of how perfect the casts of The Mary Tyler Moore Show or M*A*S*H were, you can see how opportunities were missed with Flo. Polly Holliday was nominated for an Emmy Award for her work on Flo.

All 29 unrated, full-screen episodes of the short-lived series are included. There are no bonus features on the 4-disc DVD set.",1486944000,,1527,4.869230769230769
6071806,1,B00GC2KI2U,Save your money...I had this on my Christmas Wish List and wish they hadn't gotten it for me.  Bad story lines and even worse supporting cast. I can see why it didn't last. I'm only on the first disc and don't know if I will finish all of them.,1482710400,,244,3.979591836734694
6071807,4,B00GC2KI2U,"If you liked the series ""Alice"", you will like ""Flo"".  The series is fun and silly, a lot like most of those CBS series were in the 70's.  When pressures from work and life get you down, this is the perfect remedy.  Not all of the episodes were outstanding, but there is enough good ones to keep everybody entertained.  I'm writing this review about a year after having seen it, so I don't remember a lot of specifics about the episodes.  I know I watched all 29 episodes within a week though, so that's pretty good for me.",1468281600,2,523,4.295918367346939

6071815,5,B00GC2KI2U,This DVD was purchased as a gift for a friend who loves the old shows from the 70's and 80's. I remember her telling me a few years ago about the TV show Alice and then she mentioned Flo. I figured I would surprise her with this DVD. She was completely surprised and she said she enjoyed it very much. She has watched it over and over again.,1434499200,,341,4.029411764705882
6071816,5,B00GC2KI2U,Flo was the best part of Alice and I admit when she first started her own series there were a few episodes that were not that great but as the series went on and you got to learn her characters the shows were actually really very good. I was only like 12 or so when Flo aired and I do remember watching some of these but some I don't remember at all. I bought this set and I also bought the first four seasons of Alice love them all.  If you like Flo on Alice give her a chance but keep watching as you learn her characters her own show is really as much fun as Alice.  The reason I believe it was short lived is because they kept changing her time and it never had a real chance to get an audience. The first season the ratings were very high but the second season they started moving her to times in which she was opposite big sitcoms like Laverne & Shirley and other nights in which she was opposite other big tv shows on other networks.  They should have left her on her original night from season one and it might would have stayed on tv longer.,1432425600,,1050,4.038461538461538

6071824,5,B00GC2KI2U,"7.25.14 - I ordered this dvd set some months ago and I stagger the episodes because I want the fun of watching it for the first time to last as long as possible.  I watch an episode every week or two weeks, knowing there are only 29 episodes.  I'm in the middle of disc 3 of the 4.  Polly is an absolute hoot to watch, she's so adorable and cute, ya almost forget this show is from 1981, 33 years ago!  Also because the show is set in a bar, it's easy to forget the actual time period, fresh off the 1970s.  And it appears remastered, it looks good on my LG HD LED big screen tv and not all blotchy like some old shows on new tvs.

I will say that this show definitely misses the mark but ONLY, and I do mean ONLY because of the supporting cast.  The creators/producers/casting people could've done a WAY better job casting this show.  The supporting cast was not only unappealing physically but personality-wise as well.  You feel no sympathy or connection to the supporting characters.  Farley the banker tops the list of annoying, unappealing characters.  The sister, Fran, is right up there too, MAN is she ridiculously unappealing, she is the exact opposite of Flo, its impossible to believe they are sisters.  There's prissy but her level of prissiness just doesn't fit this family at all, none of the other member's of Flo's family are like that at all, so she's just unbelievable as a Castleberry.

The piano player is just plain weird.  The bookkeeper and Flo's best friend is, well, okay I guess, fortunately she's not on screen much enough to notice.  The bumbling gas jockey who comes in is just goofy.  Her bartender is okay but again, physically unappealing.  However, he DOES deliver some funny lines.  It's almost as if they wanted Flo to shine even more, so they purposely filled the supporting roles with unattractive actors.  There were so many other character actors they could've hired back then who were much better looking.  I'm not all into looks, I'm speaking objectively actually, the American public watching tv shows likes to look at the attractive characters more.  Flo absolutely pops like a birthday cake every time she enters a scene.  She totally steals the show.

I DO like Mama.  She has some good lines and is believable as Flo's Mama.  The actor who played Flo's long-lost father on Alice, reprises his role on Flo also, in a VERY touching Thanksgiving two-parter episode.  We get to see the entire Castleberry clan, including her rodeo-star brother, J.J., although he is much more subdued on Flo.  Muuuuuch more subdued.  But, so far, this Thanksgiving episode was the best.  It displays Polly's range of emotion and they use the camera effect using a single camera to follow her through the best and most griping scene of the episode, which added even more drama because you saw real emotion from the actors involved.  During this scene, Flo tries to convince Mama to step outside to join the family at the dinner table, including her long-lost ex-husband, Flo's Daddy.  I'm tellin ya I had tears in my eyes, it was THAT well-played by Polly, the Mama, the Daddy AND the rest of the Castleberry clan, each with their own opinions and feelings about Daddy's return and sharing the Thanksgiving Day table with him.  Punch ya in the stomach drama.  With those classic, CBS, 1970s close-up shots.  This was the episode that gave me credence to continue on with hope for the rest of the series episodes.  Some hit, some miss but overall, it's fun to watch.

By the way, the Mel episode was okay, but very predictable.  Ya just have to deal with Mel's annoying bossiness while Flo keeps her temper in check, when all along you just want her to go the hell off on Mel and let him have it!!!

It's a shame this show didn't go longer.  From what I've seen so far, it could have.  Polly was definitely Flo here, but for me personally, I appreciate her character on Flo even moreso than on Alice because we get to see an expansion of her character, we get to see Flo more intimately than we did on Alice.  When you compare the character on both shows, we met Flo on Alice but ya really get to know her on Flo.  So THAT is the reason I give the show 5-stars, simply for Flo.  She was a very sweet, genuine, caring, sympathetic, deeply scarred, nurturing, confident as all git out without being arrogant, and extremely funny character.

If you're a true Alice fan, and loved it mostly for Flo, then I think if you watch this spin-off, you'll see it has it's gems.",1406246400,13,4489,4.5575

6071826,3,B00GC2KI2U,"Flo was an OK show. It didn't last long. I think a season and a half which all of the episodes are included here. I really believe Flo should have stayed with Alice.

Another surprise was to see Lucy Lee FLippen who had finished doing Little House on the Praire where she played Alonozo WIlders sister and school teacher and in Flo she played  Flo's Prim and proper sister Fran .  So if you loved the series Alice you would want Flo to complete the series So Kiss my grits and buy it, I dare ya.  yay!!!",1388275200,8,829,3.8875739644970415

6071832,5,B00GC2KI2U,"I almost couldn't believe my eyes when I came across the short-lived series Flo on Amazon's Unbox Videos - and now on DVD. This series hasn't seen the light of day since it left CBS in 1981. OK, I think TV Land aired 1 episode many-a-Christmases-ago, but that doesn't really count.

After being the belle of the ball on Alice for 5 years, Polly Holliday took the opportunity to spin her character off into her own show. The short first season was a ratings knock-out, finishing in the Nielsen Top 10 for that year. Also, airing after M*A*S*H didn't hurt.

Season Two came with a different (and competitive) time slot (Monday's at 8) and things starting sliding down hill from there. CBS didn't seem really invested enough to find ""Flo"" a better time slot, instead they flipped it around, back and forth. Even landing on Saturday night's for a short period of time. The death blow to any show searching for an audience, even back in the early 80's.

Cancellation came that spring for ""Flo"". Bringing with it an end to one of the most engaging sitcom characters to have ever existed, with her war cry ""Kiss My Grits"" being silenced forever.

I'm sure Holliday wanted nothing to do ""Alice"" again, even if an offer to return existed. It was widely rumored Linda Lavin was extremely jealous of the popularity of Holliday's ""Flo"" - and with good reason. Alice paled in Flo's shadow.

Holliday went on to other successes in theatre, TV and movies. But, she'll always be remembered best for playing that red-headed spitfire from Cowtown, Texas. The larger-than-life Florence Jean Castleberry.",1388188800,32,1584,4.787545787545787

8622116,1,B00GC2KI2U,"they say there's nothing new under the sun.
when the Friends spinoff about Joey came along, it struck me that the Industry had at last come up with something new and original: the the further adventures of the least interesting and/or deserving character.
but it turns out that even that had been done before.
for the most part, Alice was one of the better sitcoms of the late '70s and early '80s. the characters of levelheaded voice of reason Alice (Linda Lavin), ditzy but thoughtful fellow waitress Vera (Beth Howland), and chauvinist but ultimately conscientious chef Mel (Vic Tayback) had the sort of effortless chemistry ever series producer prays for. but sadly, that chemistry was frequently disrupted if not neutralized completely by one Florence Jean Castlebury (Polly Holliday). no more grating, obnoxious, unwelcome character ever wreaked worse havoc on an otherwise quality series. Steve Urkel, Scrappy-Doo, or Jar Jar Binks - hell, Steve Urkel, Scrappy-Doo, AND Jar Jar Binks - couldn't match Flo's raw power to suck all the entertainment value out of a production simply by showing up.
directors like to say that casting is 90% of their job, which certainly sums up what went wrong here. Flo is alledgedly the proverbial village bicycle, but the fact is, Polly Holliday is nowhere near attractive enough to ever hold that post in real life. and even if she had been, she's still so irritating, such a quintessential fingernail on a blackboard, that if she ever tried she'd be a damn sight more likely to to frighten any potential paramours into chastity for life. a singularly shrill, off-key voice, which already made Fran Drescher sound like Pavarotti, always seemed to rise about ten octaves whenever she invited someone to ""kiss mah gree-its."" (which itself didn't help matters any by being the single most insipid catchphrase in human history.)
so presumably all those truckers who came along and asked for Flo were not particularly picky if not full-fledged masochists. or maybe Flo had sold her soul to The Devil, in which case why didn't she get some sex appeal out of the deal to go with whatever pheromone she got?
eventually, thankfully, those in charge of the series realized that a character could be sassy and sardonic without making a viewer's skin crawl, and one Jolene Hunnicutt (Celia Weston) was eventually introduced. this much more personable, not to mentioned prettier, new waitress managed to add to the dynamic, no doubt bringing the chemistry they'd been hoping for to begin with. on that day, a mostly exemplary series would finally become watchable.
but they had to make that void before Jolene could fill it. the question is, why go to such lengths? why spend time and money giving Flo the series of her own she hardly deserved? surely it would of been easier, as well as more satisfying, to kill her off in a fire or a car crash or something?
but then again, why kibitz about how they got rid of her, as long as the vicious harpy was gone at last?",1520726400,,2991,4.866666666666666
