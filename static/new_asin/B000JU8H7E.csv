2679195,3,B000JU8H7E,"EVIL Nazis steal the immortal heart of Frankensteins monster and give it to the Japanese during World War II.  Apparently they couldn't just send flowers.  Fast forward to 1960 and a mysterious boy who managed to survive the attack on Hiroshima.  He is resistant to radiation and grows quickly.  When he is first sighted he is struck by a car.  Instead of calling an ambulance, Dr. Bowen (Nick Adams) and his date throw food at him.  Later, the boy is captured and because they have compassion they chain him up in a cage where he loses a hand.  The boy escapes and heads for the hills.  They nickname him Frankenstein (because Billy would have made too much sense).  Naturally, they try to kill the boy.  Cant have big boys running around.  Even when they are trying to do you a favor by defeating the monster Baragon who is running around wrecking home.

The scene where Dr. Bowen hits this boy with a metal stool..........!  And one of the doctors is less concerned about protecting the boy than he is with getting the heart back, and maybe a piece of his flesh, so they can study it!!!",1463875200,3,1089,4.494897959183674
2679196,5,B000JU8H7E,"World War II, the still-beating heart of the Frankenstein monster is transporter from Nazi Germany to Japan for experimentation, the A-bomb is dropped, and the heart is lost. Twenty years later, a feral boy is running ramped in Japan and feeding on small animals. He is captured and soon grows to amazing height. It is determined that he is the Frankenstein monster. A bunch of news reporters start to agitate the monster. Despite regular warnings from one of the scientists looking after him to stop, the reporters continue to agitate him. Finally, Frankenstein escapes, kills one of the reporters and goes on a rampage through the streets. Escaping to the wilderness, Frankenstein tries to live a peaceful life. But human society considers him a danger that must be destroyed. The scientists who looked after Frankenstein try to prevent this, but are unable to sway people to their side. Meanwhile, a new monster, the underground-dwelling Baragon, appears and wreaks havoc, destroying villages and eating all the residents. Of course Frankenstein gets blamed for this, which only gives the people even more incentive to destroy him. After a few unsuccessful attempts to destroy Frankenstein, the real culprit is revealed, and Frankenstein and Baragon duke it out in a terrifying action-packed death match. But this is one battle that will have no victors.

Includes the American edit ""Frankenstein Conquers the World"" as well as the international and original Japanese edits ""Frankenstein vs. Baragon"". The international edit includes an alternate ending in which Frankenstein battles a giant octopus.

Overall, I really liked this movie. It's really both a Frankenstein movie and Godzilla-like movie. You really feel for Frankenstein in this movie because, as Frankenstein should be, he is not evil. The film also has a gothic atmosphere to it from the very beginning. Those aspects really make it feel like a Frankenstein movie. Then you also have the monster Baragon and the giant monster fight in the end that make it feel like a Godzilla movie. It's a nice combination of the two, and it really is a good movie. It's heart-felt, dramatic, scary (in some parts), and the end is really action-packed. Highly Recommended!",1450483200,,2225,5.160664819944598

2679200,2,B000JU8H7E,"Frankenstein's monster looks like a knockoff Boris Karloff, which completely differs from the original story written by Mary Shelley. Victor Frankenstein is Swiss, not German, although he attended a German university where he created his monster.

The ending of his fight with Baragon is very anti-climatic, then out of nowhere he gets pulled under the water by a giant octopus? That's really lazy writing.

This film definitely isn't worth the price people are selling it for, but it is a necessary addition to any Toho kaiju film collection because its the first appearance of Baragon, who would later make a cameo appearance in ""Destroy All Monsters"" and would be one of the creatures that would fight Godzilla in ""Giant Monsters All-Out Attack"". But when you consider how unceremoniously monsters like Baragon meet their ends in films like this, it's no wonder that Godzilla is the King of the Monsters.",1425686400,,907,5.080536912751678

2679242,5,B000JU8H7E,"This is a must buy for all Horror, Sci-Fi, monster film fans. I got this film 2 years ago so this review is late but I had gotten the film for 25 bucks. Now yes this film is cheesy, fun, and a must buy. So Dr. Frankenstein is being apprehended by officials but before hand he gives the Monster's heart to Japanese scientists. They heart can never die due to a protein liquid and the monster can always grow back. However the h bomb is dropped on Hiroshima and the heart is never found that is until a man noticed a feral boy eating the heart causing him to mutate into an ever growing Frankenstein Monster. Nick Adams stars as Mr Bowen and a year later Adams would play in Invasion of Astro Monster/Godzilla vs Monster Zero 1965. So tests are done on the growing creature but he get's angry and soon escapes. Meanwhile a monster called Baragon a reptilian type mammal is wrecking havoc. Baragon has a heat beam, can burrow underground, he has a horn but he never really uses it for anything, and can leap long distances. Frankenstein's beast is blamed for the death of cattle and people. Well that is until Baragon is discovered. The last 12 to 25 minutes is just a war. It's Frankenstein's creature vs Baragon after an awesome battle the Frankenstein creature wins. Now in the English dub & Japanese original he sinks below the earth where as in the International release after Baragon is killed Frankenstein's monster battles a giant octopus which are always cool. Now Baragon  is a unique cool monster and is one of my favorites next to Godzilla. There are 2 discs disc 1 includes International film release, Japanese release, and trailers. Disc 2 contains the English dub, original trailer, special announcement, deleted scenes, and octopus footage in case you don't want to see the full International release. This is one of my favorite  Toho films and one of my most favorite films of all time. There was a sequel to this film called War of the Garagantuas which is also awesome and a must buy and was released on DVD with Rodan a DVD that I'll be buying at the end of this month.",1363392000,,2086,4.530503978779841

The main reason I bought this was because Kumi Mizuno has a pretty big role.",1360281600,,354,4.057142857142857

2679246,5,B000JU8H7E,"This movie is so awesome it makes boris karloff (who played the monster in the 1931 movie) look like an actor in a ed wood movie. Media Blasters has gave this Toho fan-favorite a deserving dvd treatment. The US version is good, the theatrical version is great, but the international version surprised me. There's an alternate ending after frankenstein killed baragon, a giant octopus appeared and dragged frankenstein into the lake, supposedly killing him. This incarnation of frankenstein made fans feel bad for Frankenstein's tragic ending. We cheered as he beat the living crud out of baragon. Come to think of it, Baragon is played by Haruo Nakajima (Who played godzilla, rodan, and gaira the green gargantua in war of the gargantuas) There's one scene that got my attention when baragon ate a horse.

Japanese Monster Movie fans, rejoice to Media Blasters' hard work. Rejoice!",1338422400,,881,5.075862068965518

2679249,3,B000JU8H7E,A fun japaneese monster movie that I remembered as a kid. It is a bit different than the old godziller movies. This one seems to be a bit more Americanized than that. It surely holds your interest. How it can grow from the heart of the matter.,1325635200,,243,4.191489361702128
2679250,4,B000JU8H7E,"This DVD is well worth the money. You get 3 different versions of the film, lots of extras, and a audio commentary. The movie itself is not your normal Kaiju film. It takes little while to get to the action but it is a very fun film. It was good to see the scene of Frankenstein fighting the giant octopus even though it is a little out of place considering the setting. A good purchase or gift for fans of Japanese monster movies.",1322870400,,431,4.204819277108434
2679251,5,B000JU8H7E,"I picked this for the nostalga value.  Like many purchasers/reviewers of this film, I remember watching it when I was younger and the world was (so much) simpler.  Putting it in, I decided to watch the Japanese version (which I had  never seen before).  I was surprised at how much fun it was and how good the movie was.  The plot actually wasn't stupid; it followed along well, and I really think that the fight scenes were good.
You can get someone to watch a movie with a 200 foot tall Frankenstein just with that hook, but to get someone to sit through the whole film, you must have a good story and you have to tell it well.  I think this succeeds.  I know about dubbing, but I still wonder if Nick Adams speaks Japanese?",1317600000,,726,4.294117647058823
2679252,3,B000JU8H7E,"This is the kind of film that was on in the afternoon on the UHF channels, because the VHF mainstream would never stoop to broadcast.  So in middle school,  my pals and I would gather round to watch this and laugh, kind of a rehearsal for hanging out in bars later in life.  This one is particularly outlandish and bad, but definitely fun.  Frankenstein is like a regenerating monster, so all but a little of him can be destroyed and he will grow back, with a kind of proto-human mind and some sensibility.  He gets chased, then there is this evolved dinosaur that swims through the rock beneath the earth complete with a bioluminescent horn.  They get into a fight and guess who wins?

Recommended as nostalgia for those who grew up in the 1960s.  Alas, my kids refused to watch it with me because it was too crude.",1287360000,4,816,4.429530201342282
2679253,4,B000JU8H7E,"Following the successes of Toho's other giant monster movies, FRANKENSTEIN CONQUERS THE WORLD capitalizes on more World War II fears materialized in the form of a gigantic Frankenstein monster that brings with him mass destruction but also the hope of regenerating lost tissue to those afflicted by nuclear war. Japanese scientists recover the heart of the Frankenstein monster before the fall of Germany during the Second World War, with the intent of learning its secrets in order to benefit mankind. The heart and its observers are then buried in the Hiroshima blast, but 15 years later, it births a radioactive monster that begins growing at an accelerated rate. The monster takes to the hills with Japan's army hot on its tale, but when terror strikes in the form of the dinosaur Baragon, Japan's only hope lies in its would-be destroyer! Like his reptile counterpart, the monster is a condemnation of war and nuclear weaponry as told through this fantastic tale. Ishiro Honda delivers more incredible filming, superior miniatures, and high production values that stand up against many of Toho's greats. Composite shots pairing the miniature set designs, the monster, and the comparatively tiny cast are handled with flawless precision early on in the film. It is the final third that forgets all of the strength and originality of the plot and becomes just another average monster brawl. FRANKENSTEIN CONQUERS THE WORLD is a winning effort from the Golden Age of Toho, and is sure to appeal to any Kaiju Eiga fan.

2679255,5,B000JU8H7E,"""Frankenstein Conquers the World"" (or ""Frankenstein vs. Baragon"") is a wonderful Japanese-American kaiju movie presented here by Tokyo Shock in a beautiful package. The package contains two discs and three versions of the movie, one primarily a Japanese release, one primarily for American audiences, and one for International audiences (which seems to be the Japanese version with the alternate giant octopus ending). Note that there are other versions out there, but three versions are plenty for me. The set has numerous extras including deleted scenes, extra footage, previews, still photos (of lobby cards, advertising materials, etc.), and a wonderful commentary by Sadamasa Arikawa, the chief cameraman and director of special effects (who appears over the International version).

The short version of the plot is that the Germans realize defeat is imminent in World War Two, so they give the heart of Frankenstein's monster, which cannot be killed, to their ally, Japan, for secret military purposes. Unfortunately, the experiments get underway in Hiroshima early in the morning of August 6, 1945, just as a B-29 drops an atomic bomb on the city. Fast forward fifteen years and a mysterious mute waif who eats dogs starts terrorizing the community, while nearly simultaneously Baragon appears destroying some oil fields. Clearly the film is headed for a conflict of epic proportions, and over the remainder of the movie Frankenstein grows enormously, tangling with Baragon in amusing fight scenes. Depending on which version you watch, a third kaiju, in this case an enormous octopus, wanders through the forest to join the fight as well.

This is a very entertaining film on a lot of levels, but mostly in a fun man-in-a-rubber suit (or lots of makeup) takes on all contenders way. The film is the first Japanese-American kaiju joint venture, and features Nick Adams as a scientist in the lead role. The supporting cast are largely Toho regulars, and the acting is above par for the genre.

For me the single most enjoyable feature of this package is the commentary with Sadamasa Arikawa, who is very informative and entertaining. He reveals many techniques of technical filmmaking and discusses working on kaiju films (and especially provides insight on director Ishir Honda). He addresses editorial differences between the versions and attempts to explain (with marginal success) the giant octopus issue. He is also to be commended, as the lighting and special effects on this film, while not totally perfect by today's standards, are excellent for the time.

I highly recommend this set to fans of kaiju, and to people who just want to watch a great and unusual Japanese sci-fi picture from the 1960's.",1264809600,14,2715,5.205949656750572
2679266,5,B000JU8H7E,"I watched this movie for the first time about a week ago, with eager anticipation. And I watched it in the best setting possible: With a mixed group of friends. Some loathed this film. Some loved it. All were entertained. I thought it was a great, action-packed monster flick, and would recommend it to any Godzilla or daikaiju fan. It was fast paced with a fairly intriguing (if simple) plot. The opening sequence in Germany is a great throwback to the other Frankenstein films. And I was greatly impressed with the suitimation of Baragon. The big fight at the end was fast and furious. I found Baragon to be almost as well concieved here in his original appearance as he was in GMK (one of my favorites). The picture is beautiful, and the inclusion of both English and Japanese versions is always a treat. I do wish there were audio commentary, as the ones on the Classic Media DVDs I've found to be quite engaging. But for me the best special feature is the ""international footage"" which is an alternate ending. I saw this ending before seeing the movie itself, so when I was with my friends I told them they had to see it after the film. It got big reactions because it is so random, but I thought it was better then the real one, partially because of its random nature. Over all, the DVD was a great experiance. I found it just as good as its semi-sequal, War of the Gargantuas.",1255305600,5,1383,4.448818897637795
2679267,4,B000JU8H7E,"Of course you know when the Japanese get a hold of the ""Frankenstein"" character, it's not gonna be a Hammer style gothic horror flick, no sir!  It's gonna be a Godzilla-ish Kaiju type deal!
Frankenstein Conquers the World(or Frankenstein vs. Baragon if you're watching the Japanese language version) is the powerful and emotionally moving story of a vagabond boy who has been exposed to much radiation from the Hiroshima atomic bomb.  If that weren't enough to put a damper on your day, he also has the heart of the Frankenstein monster(the heart was on a Nazi submarine and salvaged by a Japanese sub and it's crew)!  As we all know, this deadly combination of radiation and Frankenstein hearts in a Japanese film of the 60s means that the boy will grow quite large and have to deal with toy tanks, surf rock, nosy scientists and model kit villages.  And if that weren't enough, he's got to deal with an evolved dinosaur that burrows under the ground.....Baragon, that is!  Baragon's making the Japanese countryside into a buffet, and letting the blame fall to Frankenstein(the monster is always referred to as ""Frankenstein"").  It's inevitable that there will be a smackdown between Frankenstein and Baragon before it's all over.
Needless to say, you have to be a fan of these kinds of movies.  While not my preferred genre, I have seen quite a few, and I've always felt this to be one of the most entertaining due to the bizarre concept.  Plus I had seen it when I was young on TBS(Ah, the good old days of the TBS Saturday afternoon movie!).  So there is a nostalgia tie in there for me.
  It seems like the idea was to make Frankenstein a part of the stable of Godzilla and friends, but it didn't happen.  Baragon made a few appearances in other films though.  Fun.",1239408000,3,1770,4.652733118971061

The film stars the catchy and beloved Nick Adams who starred in the Godzilla classic, Monster Zero and the lovely Kumi Mizuno who also starred in Monster Zero. Now for the main attractions themselves. Frankenstein is portrayed differently here. In this film, he grows into enormous size and strength. But he isn't portrayed as a destructive, mindless monster here, he's a gentle being who wishes no more then food and a nice place to live. Baragon is quite an interesting monster being able to dig underground and having a heat ray similar to Godzilla's. Oodako well, looks like and acts like a giant octopus and gives Frankenstein a good fight (He's in the International version only, not the original nor the American). Ifukube creates another fantastic score that captures the creepiness of this film. Now for the DVD. We get three versions, International, Japanese and American. The 1st disc has the first two versions as I mentioned before and the 2nd has the American version, though sadly, it isn't the beloved AIP version we all grew up with. We get lots of goodies and an informative Audio Commentary that I'm sure you'll learn a thing or too. The quality for the film is fantastic but it's a little bit too dark in some scenes but it's not a major problem. All in all, a great movie presented fantastic on this DVD that you should add to your collection of monster movies.",1214352000,2,1478,4.710424710424711
2679272,5,B000JU8H7E,"This movie was ALOT of fun and has all the elements of circa 1960's
weirdness/creepiness that I love watching. It is the imperfection these films possess that make them so enjoyable to watch. The funniest part of the film is when the scientists first examine Frankenstein and they insist that ""He is distinctly caucasian"" when its soooo obvious that he is Asian!
If you liked ""War of the Gargantua's"" ""Matango"" and even ""Gorgo"", you will also love this movie as well.  I must admit that I like ""War of the Gargantua's"" better, and I hope that is soon released to DVD.",1214006400,2,567,4.6138613861386135

[[ASIN:B000JU8H7E Frankenstein Conquers the World / Frankenstein Vs. Baragon] This DVD changed all of that.  What a pathetic waste of money.  Initially, I thought Frankenstein was an alien.  This was certainly not any Frankenstein I've ever seen! I still don't know anything about the plot but my biggest question is how this Frankenstein, at times, was as tall as a dinosaur and at other times, appeared to be a dwarf.  If you are looking for a good Frankenstein movie, don't purchase this one.",1212969600,7,606,4.901960784313726

I had not seen this one for many years and I was doubled over with laughter watching it! It is great that they released this film and I would have given it 5 stars,but I remember some different scenes as a kid that ended up in the deleted scenes section of this release. Still all and all a great buy with 3 versions of the film and lots of extra goodies. I would love to see ""War Of The Gargantuas"", ""The Green Slime"" and "" Yog Monster from Space"" released!

2679285,5,B000JU8H7E,"I want to make it clear that I am upset about the innacurate information about the product that is
on the cover. i am not unhappy with the DVD or movie itself.

False advertising!!
I eagerly awaited this DVD which preported to contain both the Japanese original and the original AIP
american version. However, The english version supplied is simply the Japanese version, which is a very different
and less exciting edit from the american version. So its false advertising. ITS ALL A LIE.
Every time Tokyo Shock announces the release of a Toho title they always promise something they cant deliver.
Classic Media has had the same problem with their new Godzilla discs. DONT PROMISE SOMETHING IF YOU
HAVENT GOT IT YET, you Jerks!!
With Atragon it was the original AIP dubbing. With this release it is the american version.
The version they provide is the Japanese version with the AIP dub track layed over it.
Even worse is the fact that they have tacked the original AIP credits at the beginning to try and fool us.
Which means that they definitely had access to a print of the original.
The Japanese version has many alternate scenes that are lamer than the american version.
Example:
AIP/MARON version: Frankenstein is confronted by police cars. He pics one up and hurls it..
TOHO version: A police car swerves and crashes while avoiding Frankenstein.
Which sequence would YOU rather see?
They will probably offer some lame excuse like, ""The AIP print wasn't of the quality we wanted to present on DVD"".  The fans don't care about this!!!!!  Its okay if its not perfect.
We just want to see the movie we grew up with!!!  Idiots!!!
Im sorry if I am insulting in this review, but I am really getting tired of this.
Tokyo Shock should not advertise that this disc contains the american version. IT DOESN'T!!!!
It would be more apropriat if the cover had a red flag saying: WARNING- DOES NOT CONTAIN AIP ORIGINAL!!!
And don't go telling me Im wrong, because I have the disc and the US cut is not on it. The ""american version"" on this disc is not THE original american version. It is a different cut, made from different takes.",1180396800,19,2123,4.668449197860962
