8587083,5,B00CX3FT94,"I will watch anything that Simon Bird is in.  I also enjoy Joe Thomas, so watching Chickens was a no-brainer for me.  The best surprise, though, was Jonny Sweet.  This guy is just as funny as the other two, and his acting style is reminiscent of the guys from Monty Python.  I loved Chickens.  I enjoy that type of humor, done masterfully by three very capable comic actors.  The supporting cast is also excellent.  The writing is top-notch.  If you want a taste of the show without buying the DVD, you can watch one free episode on You Tube.  Just type in Chickens and Simon Bird.  I've already watched that episode four times--just brilliant!  The entire series is excellent--you can't go wrong with this one.",1472169600,,711,4.608
