6599352,5,B00MQ2XBB0,"This I can say with confidence that it does have dub as well as subtitled for those who are wondering, even if amazon doesn't say it. I am excited to see one piece being released like this although out of other anime out there like bleach ,naruto shippuden ,and any fairy tail after the first two box sets, one piece has had pretty good dvd sets for a reasonable price. The anime mentioned before are like $20 to $40 dollars for 12 episodes a set. But yeah his name is Zoro, can't believe someone missed that. Correct name or not it's a really good deal to buy this",1409616000,8,565,4.2407407407407405
6599353,5,B00MQ2XBB0,"I love the massive episode release, but his name isn't ""Zolo"".
Zoro is his name and correct spelling.",1409097600,11,101,4.666666666666667
6599354,3,B00MQ2XBB0,"I love this show, I really do, and these boxes are a great value for the money and look amazing on a shelf. My only gripe with this is the dvd cases, they are made out of literally the most fragile plastic known to man. I've ordered one of these and a replacement set and BOTH sets had cases with cracks, chips, little bits broken off, etc. I had to swallow my need for perfection and choose the set with the least damage. It's not really Amazon's fault either, they package the things really well, the problem is the cases might as well be made of thin glass! And these are NEW items too, I would NOT recommend used sets!

Edit: So I received box 3 from a seller on ebay, and guess what? That set came in PERFECT condition, not a single crack, broken bit, or anything on any cases whatsoever! I don't know what Amazon is doing, I suspect its not the delivery itself that is damaging these items but the in-warehouse stuff. Maybe people are throwing these boxes around or something? These really need to be handled with care because inside the box itself, the items jostle around. Anyway I'm a little disappointed in amazon. Some random ebay buyer gave me a perfect condition box with no damaged dvd cases when TWO orders from a major seller like amazon of the same item BOTH came damaged! I don't know whats going on, I usually have nothing but good things to say about Amazon...",1461110400,,1380,4.390625
6599355,5,B00MQ2XBB0,"Excellent product, if you want four dvd collctions of one piece then these box sets are the way to go plus it will save you money then just buying them individually at a time",1461110400,,174,4.147058823529412

6599358,5,B00MQ2XBB0,This is a great deal to get 100 or so One Piece episodes at an affordable price. The set contains episodes with both the Japanese and English dub and offers English subtitles. The box itself is sturdily built and looks nice on any shelf!,1453075200,2,237,4.409090909090909
6599359,5,B00MQ2XBB0,"I can not begin to say how impressed I am with this collection set.  As a huge One Piece fan I was happy to here that not only do you get four collection dvds, but also the Roronoa Zoro wanted poster, 3 stickers and 4 art cards.  I have to say that it is really nice having a single box to hold all of the four collections.  However, I can see some people not liking this, but if your like that, thankfully you can keep the collections outside the box.  Overall, it is a high quality product.  I definitely recommend this!",1452211200,,522,4.128712871287129

6599363,5,B00MQ2XBB0,"Every has a reason to be where it's at. It should be close to shabody, near end of impel down. Or even after ace dies. Its only like 100 episodes off but you can't argue over a great deal like this. So I'm ok and will get the boxes and or single collections one by one.",1446854400,,269,3.8214285714285716
6599364,5,B00MQ2XBB0,I'm a HUGE fan of one piece these box sets are amazing for anime fans looking to build their collection or a new Fan looking to get into one piece I recommend these,1446508800,,164,4.0
6599365,1,B00MQ2XBB0,"The Video quality is nice and the marathon feature is really good (One scene after the other without the in- and outro)

Why 1 Starrating then?
The box was damaged on serveral corners and the CD covers were crashed inside as well.
I want to collect all the boxes and put them on a self, but with all the damage it isn't that nice now :(",1444953600,,336,4.090909090909091

6599368,4,B00MQ2XBB0,"Good collection, the shipping was handled well and the episodes are just the regular box sets in this nice bigger box set. It should be purchases mainly by people who never bought the normal box sets or to new comers to the series.",1429228800,,231,4.395348837209302
6599369,5,B00MQ2XBB0,"Just got Collections 1 & 2 delivered in perfect condition and I love them. The boxes are sturdy and the extra content included was a nice touch. Just went ahead and ordered the 3rd Collection.

I am actually very impressed with Funimations dub of One Piece I thought the American version would butcher it because of all the Japanese lingo but Funimation suprised me and 90% of it is in tact. I personally think all the voices fit very well and even have the same pitch of voice as their Japanese counterparts.

Dont enjoy the dub? No problem, its got Japanese with English subs. Much like the Dragon Ball DVDs.

If you are a One Piece fan you will want to pick these sets up.

Also a tip, on your tv or ps4 or whatever you use to play DVDs, set it to full screen. If some of the earlier episodes are in the old school format they look bad on an hdtv otherwise. It looks great if you full screen it though. Not ""stretch"" you must use fullscreen.",1428537600,,944,4.256983240223463
6599370,3,B00MQ2XBB0,"It be nice if American made into a season dvd. Like season 1, 2, 3. There is about 600 ep in one piece.  Japanese made their dvd in a season box",1426118400,,144,3.6451612903225805
6599371,4,B00MQ2XBB0,The package came on time and was in good shape. The box that holds all the DVDs together is sturdy and nice to look at. This show is a riot.,1425340800,,140,3.7
6599372,5,B00MQ2XBB0,Such a great box set! Been waiting for something like this for the longest time! Can't wait for the 3rd box and I hope they release a 4th one soon!,1424822400,,147,3.933333333333333
6599373,5,B00MQ2XBB0,"This box set comes with 3 stickers, 4 art cards which are basically the pictures of the DVD cover just like the first box set,  but instead you'll get a  Roronoa wanted poster/stickers, so I'm guessing the third box set will be a different character. And inside the box you'll see that the logo is different with the swords. As well with the DVD holder. Like I said in the last review, if you haven't seen the series yet or don't have the individual dvds then I definitely recommend picking up the box sets!",1424131200,24,507,4.382978723404255
6599374,5,B00MQ2XBB0,"It is in fact from Funimation for those who said it isn't, Great Deal for Collectors who want to save room on there Shelves plus Comes with a WANTED Poster just like the First for Zoro, 3 Stickers of Zoro/Zoro's flag type and 4 Poster boards. However, The only thing I hate is that even though I Pre-Ordered it, They sent the Package without any type of Protection and the 2 Top right hand Corners were damaged... As a Collector of Anime, I simply won't accept Damaged products. Had to return my Package...

But the Anime is great either way!!! I suggest starting on the First Collection before buying the Second though, Skipping ahead makes you lose Interest.",1424131200,5,660,4.593220338983051
6599375,5,B00MQ2XBB0,Very cool,1422057600,,9,4.0
6599376,5,B00MQ2XBB0,Lol to those who complain about zoro being spelled zolo it's just a translation thing it's even like that in printed manga volumes it's something that happens all the time with l and r when they get translated just pay it no mind.,1421798400,,230,4.372093023255814
6599377,1,B00MQ2XBB0,I just noticed something. The actors listed on here are not the regular actors from Funimation. I think this is the 4kids version just re-branded in a different box. I say this because the pricing is off. We can singly buy more episodes for cheaper than this box set. Also as someone else said in a previous review his name is not Zolo its Zorro. I do understand the reason why in the us manga its Zolo because of licencing issues with the character Zorro but they can get away with it in the anime. I wouldn't buy this until they give us clear indication this is the Funimation verison. The 4kids version was heavily edited. They cut many episodes and destroyed the series. They edited out Sanji's cigarettes and put a lollipop in place. Ridiculous.,1419811200,,750,4.522058823529412
6599378,5,B00MQ2XBB0,Ive been watching this anime for years and its been my favorite also. The fact that they are releasing these episodes in a bundle is a big scoop of happiness. Its worth it in my opinion,1415664000,,185,4.166666666666667
6599379,5,B00MQ2XBB0,Great price for fans who haven't bought any of the anime. And those who complain about the last episode this is a box set of one piece collection 5-8 which ended with episode number 205.,1415404800,,186,4.3428571428571425
6599380,3,B00MQ2XBB0,"I decided to send Amazon an email about his name being Zoro and the exclusion of the last episode of the G-8 arc, maybe if enough of say something it can be changed.",1412985600,3,165,4.03030303030303
6599381,3,B00MQ2XBB0,"I love the series and I believe this collection will be great along with the first box, except for the fact that they listed the last episode at 205 here, immediately leaving a huge cliff-hanger until the next box set releases. Those who've watched One Piece past episode 205, will know that the G8 filler story arc ends with episode 206, which is also the last episode before One Piece switches to widescreen format and HD broadcasts. 206 also ends well and contains nothing from the next story arc, so to have this end at 205 when they could've squeezed in one more episode to at least make this set seem complete, screams nonsensical laziness to me.

I hope Funimation will address this annoyance before the final product releases.",1412812800,5,734,4.689922480620155
6599382,5,B00MQ2XBB0,I'm not complaining Mich about this since I can see why they would mistaken his name for Solo. In the US release of the manga his name is Zolo but in the anime its Zoro. Just clarifying,1411430400,3,185,4.027027027027027
6599383,1,B00MQ2XBB0,I am pretty skeptical about this. Funimation has the rights to one piece in the U.S. and this says nothing about Funimation.,1410134400,4,124,4.681818181818182

8673863,5,B00MQ2XBB0,This product arrived in excellent condition. I had heard some complaints about the conditions of these boxes but it would appear that Amazon has fixed that. I did not have any noticeable wear on the box or on the individual DVD cases inside. This box is a great deal for any One Piece fan at a price that beats buying these collections individually.,1474243200,,349,4.555555555555555
8673864,5,B00MQ2XBB0,Great show,1469404800,,10,4.5
8673865,3,B00MQ2XBB0,The animation itself is 5 Stars.  But Amazon sold us a broken collection box.  A few DVD cases is broken in some type of way.  I had to be careful with all of the little pieces falling to my floor (I have babies crawling around).  The box and case itself is part of the reason why we purchase Collection Box.,1467936000,,308,4.083333333333333

8673867,4,B00MQ2XBB0,"While i watch this online, I bought this dvd set for my husband.  It's okay but he found some of the audio goes in and out on one of the disc and said that that one was unwrapped already when he opened the box set.  I don't know it that was a return and he got a bad one.  Otherwise the images are good.",1464912000,,303,3.703125
