2642616,5,B000HT38DU,"Well worth the price of admission. All three movies are good. 15 minutes is a very dark crime thriller. Frequency is a wonderful time travel type of story, with a twist.",1354060800,,169,4.483870967741935
2642617,1,B000HT38DU,I bought this item solely for the movie thirteen days in the triple pack. I thought I was saving money and so got that pack because it was three movies for the price of one but the only one that didn't play was thirteen days so I through out the movie. I went back and bought another one so I wasted 10 bucks tryinf to make a deal when I should have just bought in the first place,1341100800,,380,3.8846153846153846
2642618,5,B000HT38DU,"Purchased this DVD for Thirteen Days specifically, however all three movies are excellent and well worth watching. Glad to add this to my collection.

Excellent seller and super fast shipping. Arrived before expected.",1341014400,,217,5.575757575757576
2642619,3,B000HT38DU,"I have noticed that there are two editions to Thirteen Days listed on Amazon.  The ""Infinifilm Edition""  (listed as both 2000 and 2001??) and the 2006  ""basic edition"" triple pack?  I don't know what they call that edition.  The Infinifilm version is sold as a stand-alone single DVD and is also listed on some pages as being the version included in the Triple Pack.  But just a moment ago I saw the unnamed version listed in the Triple Pack and also as a stand-alone!

Clearly I am confused as to which version is ""better.""  I'm going to buy the Triple Pack just for the bargain 3-for-1, but I'd really like to know if there any differences between the two?",1339286400,,658,4.470588235294118
2642620,5,B000HT38DU,My dvd came very fast and in perfect condition. I highly reccomend this seller!!five stars all the way. I will most likely buy from them again. Thanks again!!ray,1326585600,,161,4.785714285714286
2642621,5,B000HT38DU,"EXCELLENT PACK, WORTH THIS LOW PRICE, EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCE FROM ROBERT DE NIRO ; I LIKE THIS MOVIE, YOU WILL NOT REGRET THIS PURCHASE.",1305590400,,139,5.086956521739131
2642622,5,B000HT38DU,"If you like suspense thrillers, unusual plots, great casting, great acting you are in for a treat with this triple feature.  They get you hooked from the beginning and keep you involved through-out. My favorite of the three was ""15 Minutes"" starring Robert DeNiro and Edward Burns and two of the most believable psychopathic killers you have ever seen on the screen.  I enjoyed ""Frequency"" starring Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel with its unusual plot and surprise (and very satisfying) ending. ""Thirteen Days"" was the behind-the-scenes action of President Kennedy and the U.S. government during the ""Cuban Missle Crises"" with the nuclear threat to the U.S. by Russia. It was cast very well and the actors both resembled and acted like the people in real life they were portraying.  If you were alive in the early 1960s and remember the event this will bring back a lot of feelings and memories. This DVD is a great bargain--it's a keeper and I strongly recommend it!",1278028800,6,966,4.878048780487805
2642623,1,B000HT38DU,"I'm not making an opinion based on the films themselves, but I gave this one star because it's all of the movies are in fullscreen. I mean who needs fullscreen anymore? Anyways... If that doesn't bother you than by all means...",1247443200,19,227,4.560975609756097
2642624,5,B000HT38DU,"This NEW LINE Triple Feature contains three excellent pictures that were released in 2000 and '01.

In the fantasy FREQUENCY, a man is able to speak to his long dead father via ham radio. The Northern Lights create an atmospheric condition in October of 1969 and '99 that makes this possible.

By knowing minute details of Mets/Orioles World Series games that haven't been played yet (in the past), John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) convinces his dad (Dennis Quaid) that he is indeed his six-year-old boy talking from the future. During a long ham chat John tells Frank how he can prevent dying in a work accident that's due to happen the next day (in 1969). This changes the course of history however-- with terrible personal consequences for both men.

In the story's jaw-dropping climax, the villain (Shawn Doyle) simultaneously attacks both men in 1969 and '99, while the ham transmits what's occurring.

15 MINUTES is an ultra-violent crime drama that stars Edward Burns as a fire marshall and Robert De Niro as a detective. De Niro's final scene is unforgettably gruesome. Here, two Eastern European thugs make a Super-8 movie of their several brutal slayings. Kelsey Grammer is the exploitative news journal TV show host who assists the killers for the sake of ratings. (Includes cameos by Charlize Theron and Kim Cattrell.)

THIRTEEN DAYS concerns the Cuban Missile Crisis as seen through the eyes of JFK's friend and assistant, Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner). Bruce Greenwood is excellent as President Kennedy.

Although not well known, the supporting cast are all fine in their portrayals of the familiar characters central to this 1962 event: Adlai Stevenson, Bobby, Jackie, Bob McNamara, Max Taylor, LBJ, Ted Sorenson, Dean Acheson, Curtis LeMay, Pierre Salinger, Andre Gromyko, Dean Rusk and more.
