8350903,5,B0024ZFT5U,"Firstly, I should state that I've seen 2 other versions of Devdas prior to watching this film, the 1955 Dilip Kumar version, as well the 2002 Shahrukh Khan version. While I much preferred the former version as it was well directed/acted, I honestly detested the story in both versions, and had trouble understanding and relating to the self-destructive aspect of the main character. In Anurag Kashyap's Dev D I have fallen in love with the story and characters. While Devdas has been redone too many times, this version is not a re-telling of the novel, but rather, a contemporized version of Devdas. Unlike mainstream Bollywood directors, Mr. Kashyap has decided to swim against the current and try to be a part of a wave occurring in Indian cinema that is trying to evolve a long stunted industry. With Dev D, we see not only the most substantial part of this wave, but also the most groundbreaking work to emerge from an industry infamous for bad overacting, mentally unstimulating (and frankly insulting) cliched stories, and depraved directing that would've given the late Ed Wood an ego boost.

The film is cast with no-names in the leading roles, something that surely made producers hesitant to fund the film, but what a great idea to actually go with talent over super-models (not that anyone is lacking in the looks dept., the actors are beautiful still, they can just now..you know, ACT). Abhay Deol in the lead is fantastic, the best Devdas incarnation yet, and honestly all the performances are so poignantly achieved and wonderful. In Dev D one can actually see and understand the decisions this flawed character makes and anyone who's been heartbroken will surely relate to one of the three main characters. There's no over-acting here, it's quite unbelievable that these performances came out of an Indian film; it makes it that much easier to get engaged in the story.

Dev. D was produced by independent studios, and understandably so. No major Bollywood studio today would fund a film with the raw content of this script which depicts real people and their actions. For some comparison, the 2002 blockbuster production of Devdas had a budget of almost $11 million compared to Dev D.'s budget of little over 1 million, yet the cinematography is lavishly gorgeous in Dev D. There's even some fantastic and innovative camera work used for some of the scenes where Dev is intoxicated. Yes, that's right, for innovation, the director actually tried changing up cameras and altering lighting to achieve effects to serve the story rather than dumping millions on a ridiculous dance scene, or flying out to stock a random mountain with dancing girls to pass off as ""innovation."" The film may not have the over-the-top sets and obscenely expensive saris on every female, but the film is shot on location showing the cities as they are and colors/lighting are used artistically to add to mood and compliment the music as well.

And the MUSIC! How about an Indian film that does not use the A.R. Rahmans and Anu Maliks and regular playback singers that have virtually monopolized Bollywood's film-music business. The film doesn't once contain a scene where everyone gets up and starts dancing, but songs are played in the background with sensitive lyrics that parallel the characters feelings. At the helm of the music is Amit Trivedi in his second film to score which contains wonderful songs, and he may very well provide the most variety of styles of tracks for a given soundtrack for an Indian film. Like Kashyap, Trivedi is making a blatant push against the conventional Bollywood standards by implementing his own unique voice and by bringing along some great, unknown talents to bring the songs to life.

I can almost not heap enough praise on this film. From an original story which I couldn't stand for its flagrant melodrama, Anurag Kashyap has artistically crafted a brilliant masterpiece which will undoubtedly only gain reverence and appreciation with age. I love this film, and highly recommend it to anyone wanting to watch a great piece of cinema, and especially to anyone who, like me, had been frustrated with the trash spewing out of Bollywood for years. Having grown up amidst 90's Bollywood (a dark ages for Bollywood in my opinion), Dev D. was a much welcomed breath of fresh air.",1295136000,3,4310,4.924346629986245
8350904,3,B0024ZFT5U,"This Devdas is no loser. In Dev D. Anurag Kashyap and Abhay Deol resurrect Devdas and make him contemporary. Here you have Paro who is not afraid to take a naked picture of her and send it to Devdas or Chandramukhi who is a sex worker and into role play. This Devdas is different and is in sync with modern times. This one is not only in to drinks but drugs as well. The Dev das story line is not different from the book Dev is in love with Paro but after hearing a rumor about her sexual escapades,cuts her off and so Paro in order to spite Dev goes off and marries someone else, thus beginning Devs downfall. Lenny is a student who is forced to be a runaway because of a MMS scandal, which causes her father to commit suicide. She sets up shop with the help of Chunni a pimp, and becomes Chanda. A escort by night and a college student by day. This is the time when Dev enters her life..The ending is different and keeps up with the modernity. I loved the songs but they were too many and unevenly spaced. Emosional Attyachar is brilliant. The star of the movie is undoubtedly Abhay Deol, one of the few actors who can make a movie shine. I watch a movie simply because of his presence since he has a penchant for working with unknown directors. You will absolutely love his selfish portrayal of drug addled and drink fueled Dev D. I gave this move three stars. 111909",1259971200,,1370,4.252873563218391

8350906,5,B0024ZFT5U,"Is it just me or does DEV D represent some kind of tectonic shift in
contemporary Indian cinema? The director has imbibed all he can of world cinema and then spat it  right out - you can see thecolors and verve of Scorcese's Mean Streets (or are they the colors of Michael Powell and Godard?), Cammell's Performance, Wong kar Wai -- but on a purely visceral level, I'm  reminded so much of Amores Perros. Whatever: Anurag Kashyap, is a great synthesizer and also an original,  is the most exciting new filmmaker
to come to my attention in ages. This film deserves to be seen in art houses all over the world.",1247270400,2,608,4.45945945945946
8350907,3,B0024ZFT5U,"I did not see the original Devdas so I can only go on this movie as a stand alone movie.  I have watched many bollywood movies and I know what I like.  Although I enjoy the musical intervals, I also liked how this one had good music but without the singing intervals.  The acting was good and the direction made the movie seem more western.  I didn't really care for the main character.  His double standard for his love interest (it was ok for him to sleep around but when he found out that she had he called her a slut) and his immaturity (he sulked when she moved on after he rejected her) was so irritating to me that I stopped the movie.  I have yet to finish it.  I will one day.  The movie itself is well done.",1244332800,,717,4.071428571428571
