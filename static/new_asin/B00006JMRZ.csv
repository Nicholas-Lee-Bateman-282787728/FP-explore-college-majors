The 10 Faces of Sonny Chiba set has slightly better picture and it even has the optional Japanese track for the first movie whereas this set doesn't. Still, all of these budget Street Fighter sets released in the US look blurry like old vhs tapes. If you're a real Chiba fan, I suggest getting a region-free dvd player and the region-2 Street Fighter boxset from Amazon UK. The improved picture and audio is a night-and-day difference. Otherwise, get the 10 Faces of Sonny Chiba set since it's better than this set and costs about the same.",1291593600,2,692,4.4140625
7970384,1,B00006JMRZ,"It's better than a worn,non-tracking VCR tape but that's not saying much now is it! This set has only one thing in it's favor,it's wide-screen,that's all. My set has that screen digitation going on in several spots(Return is the worst)I also have serious doubts these are unrated versions of these films. I have all these on Tape and I can't tell any difference. All in all not worth the [...] bucks at all unless you were to pay [...] bucks for used VCR tapes!",1271462400,,461,4.5
7970385,4,B00006JMRZ,"For anyone not in the know, The Street Fighter series is the tale of bad ass mercenary Terry Tsurugi (played by THE Sonny Chiba) and his brutal quests for revenge.  These films are more exploitation than martial arts mastery but Sonny is still a joy to watch in action, whether punching in a goons skull or ripping his genitals off (WHAT!?).  The Street Fighter is the only true classic of the bunch that every self-respecting fight fan should see, however the rest of the films are still a good, violent time on varying levels.  This set, released in 2002 by bargain bin DVD company VCI, leaves allot of room for improvement as far as picture, sound, special features, etc., but I've found that with every other Street Fighter release as well (there is a nice Region 2 collection but you need a region free player so...).  That being said it's far from the worst of the bunch and looks (widescreen) and sounds (english dub only) pretty good as far as these go.  Truly what's nice about this set is that you get 3 out of 4 films uncut (Sister Street Fighter is the R cut) and all on 2 discs in one case (with pretty polished and nice artwork... actually doesn't look as cheap as it is if that type of thing matters to you).  I got this new for $7.99 and I'm happy with what I got... until someone more respectable picks these up and polishes them the way they deserve (are you listening Tokyo Shock?) you could do far worse than this affordable set.",1189382400,15,1449,4.428571428571429
