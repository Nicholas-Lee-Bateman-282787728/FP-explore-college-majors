8604283,3,B00EDP5K30,"This video is the first in a series of three, aimed at self-improvers. The subtitle specifies this as for an approximate rating level 0-1000 and this I feel quite optimistic. As one reviewer pointed it out here, lower level players may not appreciate the style of game walkthroughs and may not benefit from the finer points of strategy. There are 10 suggestions here:

1, Concentrate. I think the loser of this game was not so much lacking in concentration, but simply was lost due to not knowing what to do. So drifting is not due to not trying to pay attention, but more due to getting lost in strategical points. Planning is a difficult task when improvers are told to start with e4 and attack and learn tactics and things will get better.
2, Stick to the basics. Here Karpov loses a game against Christiansen due to a tactical blunder. Fair enough. If you make howlers, like leaving two pieces unprotected at the same time, you lose the game . But telling Karpov do not run before you walk sounds a little off; clearly he was beyond his toddler period.
3, Chess is an attacking game. Do not be timid.
4, Ask the most important question. Great advice.
5, Learn tactical control. Learn basic tactics. Great advice.
6, Cut out game-losing mistakes. Look for checks, captures. Great advice.
7, Playing vs. study. Here I miss the ""what to study"" part. Study what? 20 minutes a day is OK, but most improvers may study more than that. The problem is that this is unfocused and confused (Openings? Tactics? Endgames?)
8, Dont ignore the endgame. Great advice. I think shouldering of the kings should have been discussed here.
9, Write all games out and look at them with a stronger player. This advice is often mentioned but my problem with this is that ""stronger"" is relative and he/she may not enjoy too much looking over my idiotic fumbles over the board. A much better advice would be to learn to use computers and software, like ChessKing, Shredder, etc. These show you exactly where you went wrong and what tactics did you miss. ChessKing actually has a great FREE and downloadable book in PDF format (The Ultimate Guide the Chess King) written by Steve Lopez about the use of software (any software, not just ChessKing) to help self-improvement. If you have a good, stronger chess player who is willing to work with you, great, but most of us have no such luck.
10, Do not be afraid of losing. Here in the Gurevich- Hector game (1992) we see a Caro-Kann as an example of crazy, fearless, unorthodox and speculative playing (Caro-Kann and crazy?), yet it was the blunder of a Knight move that lost the game, not a balls-out gambit play.

Overall, this is a helpful program, but I think improvers would benefit more from a What is that you do wrong than a What is it that you should be doing approach. There are not many authors that could significantly help a struggling improver (Purdy, Heisman, Horowitz, Znosko-Borovsky and recently Igor Smirnov are among the few), just as runners may not be the best helpers of those who are learning the walk.",1527897600,,3050,4.646296296296296
