was that created so many problems.  I had seen it on A & E when it]
was shown there...liked it alot; but was somewhat disapointed in the
CD itself.  This is understandable when you live on blue ray.

8263648,5,B0016OKQTE,"Far be it from me to question the less than concrete proof of the Vatican and our Protestant bretheren but was the entire Jesus saga about not wanting to pay Roman taxes? From what I saw, the land of Israel was arid and did not yield many crops, Jews had to pay taxes to the temple and people barely got by. No one was revolting until the Romans came and demanded they honor Rome's pagan gods and PAY TAXES. This caused the everyday Jew to have even less and that is when they started stirring up trouble with the jewish elders who had no problem paying homage to Rome. While this show really illustrates the Romans as cruel tyrants it also showed me that in their eyes Jesus was nothing more than a criminal who was justly put down. As for the Armaggedon talk, it clearly illustrates that the jews saw the end of times as happeneing right before their eyes in their lifetime and were not predicting the actual end of the earth but the end of the Jewish religion.

Would we act any different if some American Indian was dodging taxes, commiting murders and calling for the end of the U.S. government?

We would out his ass down just like the Romans did Jesus!!

Moral of this DVD - Just pay your taxes and don't commit crimes and you can live in peace!",1305158400,3,1252,4.319148936170213
8263649,1,B0016OKQTE,"How can you trust them to get the events surrounding the fall of Jerusalem right when they can't get early Christianity right?  They pitted Paul and James against each other as rivals of two different streams of Christianity. They said point blank that the prophecy of Jesus concerning the end of the world did not come to pass and the Biblical authors (specifically Luke) had to go back and re-write their gospels to compensate for the failed prophecy. There were some other really bad things too, but I highlighted some of the worst. It has a completely naturalistic and liberal perspective on religion and I would say they had a clear agenda to cast doubt on the Christian faith. They also portrayed Josephus as a trader who couldn't be trusted and casted doubt that he faithfully reported the truth in some areas. That may be true but how can I trust them? Their credibility is shot.",1299196800,,887,4.685897435897436
8263650,5,B0016OKQTE,"Yes I give this 5-stars but only for the history. The creators of this really, really miss the Bible story and the conclusions regarding the teachings of Jesus, Paul, Peter and the early Christians are WAY off. But the secular history about Rome's seige of Jerusalem, the effect on the city and the final outcome are very, very good. It is well illustrated and narrated and quite exciting! I highly recommend this video for the history and I also highly recommend that you completely discount the observations about the early church and it's teachings.",1275436800,5,552,4.882978723404255
