8056188,1,B0008GCZ3Q,"I made the mistake of purchasing a series of 7 DVDs of Winkelman's katas. I have seen these katas performed better by yellow and orange belts. These disks are a total waste of money if you are looking for something to really show you proper form. they are fine as a refresher to remind you of the proper order of techniques, but nothing more than that. To see a supposed master walk through a kata rather than display proper form is shameful. Seiuchin kata performed without bent knees, some stance changes pivoted around a stationary leg instead of stepping through, Naihanchi kata walked through with back turned to attacker at times... too many mistakes to even list.

my qualification? ni-kyu in Ishin Ryu, many years of doing these katas with a 7th dan who insists on perfection.",1233878400,,784,4.7226277372262775
8056189,5,B0008GCZ3Q,"This video clearly presents both kata and bunkai (prearranged kumite), for Bo and sai. I am not an Isshin Ryu student (I am a nidan in Uechi Ryu), so I don't know how many kata they have for these weapons, but it presents these in a way where they can be learned. Also, the application parts teach concepts which I can incorporate into the material I am learning from Master Gushi.",1168473600,,381,4.380281690140845
