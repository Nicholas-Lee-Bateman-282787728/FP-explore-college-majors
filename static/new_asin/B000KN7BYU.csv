2696546,3,B000KN7BYU,"My husband and I had taken private dance instruction and were looking to learn some new figures, so we are not complete beginners.  The dancer's form on the DVD is very good, and the steps taught are useful.  However,  I felt that the instruction was too fast paced.  You continually have to stop the DVD to learn the steps, rather than having the instruction repeated a number of times.  I ordered an intermediate swing dance DVD from a different series and found the instructional pace much better.",1235088000,11,500,4.7011494252873565

8158362,3,B000KN7BYU,"Like all T.M.'s videos, every thing is in a hurry. It is good for a quick reference of several steps.",1421798400,,101,4.1

8158368,1,B000KN7BYU,Couldn't watch more than 2 mins of this. It's so dated. The studio decor and dress were just too off-putting. Will have to keep looking for that 'perfect' ballroom dancing dvd to help us move to the next level beyond beginner.,1293321600,,226,4.536585365853658
