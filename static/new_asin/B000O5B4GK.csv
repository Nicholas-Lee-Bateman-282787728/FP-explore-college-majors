Don't know what kind of award they won.  It's like watching an old filmstrip that has been
converted to dvd form.",1304121600,,211,4.675675675675675
8183116,5,B000O5B4GK,"I have volume 1 and 2. I must admit these cartoons hold a strange good quality compared to alot of the new cartoons. The cartoons are somewhat mature, making them perfect for teenagers,young adults,adults etc. The animation is old but fair,NOT over the top,corny or cheesy. The stories and the direction is realy unique from other bible cartoons. It's like you are watching a suspense mini series! I did a brief review on Vol. 1 that should have been longer. Bottom line, I believe these to be the BEST BIBLE CARTOONS out there. Buy both volumes and remember THIS PARTICULAR SERIES was awarded for a reason.",1287964800,4,607,4.735849056603773
8183117,3,B000O5B4GK,"The quality is not that great, but it holds true to the bible. There are not frills and deviations from the actual bible stories, so  I would suggest it to anyone who would like to teach thoir kids (ages 4-8) about stories in the bible in an illustrated way. Also get Vol 1.",1208563200,,274,4.169811320754717
