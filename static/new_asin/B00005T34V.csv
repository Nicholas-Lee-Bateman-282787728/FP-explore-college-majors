What was interesting to me is how he shows that sacred sites around the world could be more than just pretty places to visit, they could in fact hold secrets to the origins of mankind. The segment on healing was great. There is so much info in this presentation , I've watched it several times. A great video to own !",1070409600,2,464,4.406976744186046
