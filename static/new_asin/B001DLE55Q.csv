Over time I bought the 4 DVDs separately, and I love them so much  I bought 2 full sets to give as gifts. I highly recommend these DVDs to anyone who wants to learn sign language.  Thank you Tim Riley and Hayden Riley for creating these joyous sign language DVDs. God bless you both.",1397260800,,457,4.772151898734177
