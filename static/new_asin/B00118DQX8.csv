3063243,4,B00118DQX8,O Thou Transcendent is lush movie with great video and audio of RVW's music and performances of the music.  Wonderful history of the man and events that shaped his musical psyche.  This video will make you want to go and buy more of his music.,1204848000,8,243,4.377777777777778
3063244,5,B00118DQX8,"Tony Palmer's film biography of Vaughan Williams presents the composer as a complicated genius and noble spirit who endured much frustration, disappointment, and tragedy in his life and expressed it in his music...a far cry from the popular image of RVW as sentimental folk tune recycler.  The narrative is put forward using interviews and file voiceovers (most notably from RVW himself, his widow Ursula, and biographer Michael Kennedy, but including a wide, and sometimes surprising, group of talking heads).  Beautifully filmed and leisurely paced, the film helps confirm Vaughan Williams as one of Europe's (not just England's) greatest 20th century composers.  Excerpts from musical performances--newly recorded as well as file footage--give strong implicit evidence that Vaughan Williams was also a great symphonist. Palmer makes a mistake with the use of graphic late 20th- and 21st-century war and famine footage in an attempt to reinforce his otherwise well-founded argument that RVW's music is tragically pessimistic and relevant in the modern world; however, these few moments are only a small blemish on a highly successful and personal portrait.  Highly recommended.",1202947200,30,1179,5.606741573033708

3063256,5,B00118DQX8,"This is not so much a review as an opportunity to add five stars to this outstanding production. It deserves even more stars, were that possible.

After seeing so many awful films biographies of Schubert, Beethoven, Chopin,Mozart, et. al. only a few great film biographies stand out in my mind, e.g.,  Tchaikovsky, Sibelius, Rachmaninoff. Now one more can be added to the list at or near the pinnacle. That is Palmer's, O Thou Transcendent. Some reviewers disagree, I see, but their reasons seem a bit superficial to me: for example an objection to the minute of carnage in a 2 1/2 hour film...not to forget that RVW was an ambulance driver and saw in real life a lot more than a few seconds of the bloody horrors of war and the death of very close friends who worked with him. No it is not pleasant. No, it may not be suitable for children. But when has war ever been?

In this production we have a great balance of biographical material, interviews, and samples of the great variety of his works, wonderfully performed by Sian Edwards, Tamas Vasary and Sir Adrian Boult among others. Not only are the slections perfect for RVW, but here is an opportunity to listen to reflections by his second wife,Ursula, and of Sir Michael Tippett, Lord Armstrong, the composer Mark Anthony Turnage and Lady Barbarolli, among others. This is an extraordinary work of film- making about a great English composer. If you do not see it you will have missed 2 1/2 hours of pure delight. Most highly recommended.",1262995200,6,1495,4.67680608365019

Tony Palmer's film left me wanting more -- to know more about his music and to listen to it.  On that basis I think that film must be rated a success.  In addition the scenic shots of England were beautiful.  Even with only a standard upscaling DVD player and a 53"" Sony SXRD HD Screen there was amazing clarity and vibrancy in the images presented.

3063258,1,B00118DQX8,"""O Thou Transcendent: The Life of Ralph Vaughan Williams"" has to be one of the worst documentaries I've seen in a long time. From start to finish, there was nothing of remote substance found. The interview segments made absolutely no sense and didn't even pertain to the subject matter about 99% of the time. The editing, or lack of, was terrible as it was completely cut-up and very erratic. The entire documentary didn't follow any kind of timeline at all. The stories told from the various people being interviewed made absolutely no sense and were more of a personal nature and not much in the way of Vaughan Williams' actual history. The images involved throughout were very distasteful, which I'm sure this has been mentioned, but there were several images that were totally uncalled for like the images of a dead child and not to mention stacks of dead bodies, which are out-of-place in this type of documentary, which is supposed to be about Vaughan Williams and not trying to provoke controversy.

That said, I can't possibly think of one good thing to say about this pathetic excuse for a documentary other than I wish I had the 2+ hours back from watching this film. If you are expecting a documentary that follows a timeline and that deals with Vaughan Williams' life in a competent way, then do not watch this. I would have been ashamed to have even released this garbage for people to see. It surely doesn't do any justice to this man's beautiful music, if anything, it makes a mockery of it.",1252108800,7,1506,4.683018867924528
3063259,4,B00118DQX8,"I read the biography of Ralph Vaughan Williams, RVW, written by his widow, Ursula, to present to a book club to which I belong.  The book was long, full of musical minutia, and if I hadn't been obligated to discuss it, I would not have finished the book.  After slogging through 400 pages of details that made my eyes cross, but compeletly skipped over the main story, I was left with not much interesting information to discuss with my group so I began researching more about the man.

I found this film to be very helpful.  It includes footage of Ralph Vaughan Williams himself, Ursula, and several people who knew them well and revealed more of their fascinating story than Ursula was willing to tell.

The music is breathtaking, the English landscapes are beautiful, and this film gives more insight into this giant of 20th century music than any other single source that I found during the course of my research.",1240531200,7,917,4.670807453416149
3063260,3,B00118DQX8,"I love the music of Sir Ralph and was looking forward to seeing this long ""documentary"". Surely the 2 hours 28 minute duration could have been much shorter and make the same impact, if not moreso.
Perhaps Mr Palmer is getting old and this forms part of the stupid elithist political left that usually comes from the UK, but to show recent images of burned children (and twice!) was totally unnecessary.
Such manipulation has made me lost respect for Mr Palmer and will make sure that next time I buy anything with his name on it I will inform myself carefully. There was absolutely no need to put such incendiary material (especially considering its recent origin) in a documentary. I wonder what sir Raplh's would have thought.",1234224000,6,728,4.74015748031496
3063261,3,B00118DQX8,"A great fan of RVW's music, and excitedly looked forward to viewing this piece......sadly disappointed in the result.

Tony Palmer does an interesting take on RVW's creative motivation....namely that it was to express in his music the various sufferings and tragedies of his own life and of his times. That may be so, it may not be. After all it was RVW himself who responded (I paraphrase): ""....a man wants to write a piece of music for the sake of the music itself"" when critics and reviewers wanted to interpret first his 4th, then his 6th symphony as about WWII and the turmoils of that era. Undoubtedly every artist in any media is of his times and influenced by the pleasures and pains of his own experience, but that does not necessarily mean that he is writing programmatic music to literally depict those times or events.

As another reviewer here has said, for Tony Palmer to repeatedly show brutal, horrible and tragic images from recent times (now 50 years after RVW's death) as a means to illustrate his own interpretation of the great motivational force in RVW's output, was a mistake. That did ruin this film.

And on a technical note, the repeated footage of mostly only two orchestras playing chopped up and mixed up excerpts from the several symphonies got to be confusing (and I do know the music) and uninteresting visually. For example, there is only one second symphony, yet it was identified in three separate ways as if there were three separate symphonies in question.

Also this film would have greatly benefited from sub-titles, remaining visible always in my opinion, but at least with the option to turn them on. Many of the interviews were unintelligible due to poor diction or fast speaking or the age of the person being interviewed.

And finally, the RVW voiceover is not identified as to source. When and why was this recorded, if it was actually RVW telling his life story? If not, who?

In the end, if you are a fan of RVW, you will want to see and probably own this DVD for your own reference collection, but it certainly was more of a disappointment to this RVW devotee than it should have been.",1221004800,16,2134,4.677333333333333

The film maker included very graphic and disturbing film images of dead and dying children to emphasize the horrors of war. I really believe this hurt the film. The horrors of war could have been depicted in a way that did not draw us too far away from the subject matter, which is a great composer and his music. At the end, it was the gruesome images of tragedy and destruction that stayed with me, not the man and his transcendent music. I'm not against powerful images and shaking things up when necessary, but the film maker, for all of his good work, crossed the line to the point where his creation left me angry and disturbed, not enlightened and inspired. A few substituted scenes could have made the point and still kept the focus on the composer and his work. I would have given it 5 stars otherwise.",1219968000,27,970,4.394444444444445

However, Tony Palmer has created a documentary that has so many terrible editing choices in it that it becomes a tedious endeavor to watch it through in one sitting. The term ""Mickey Mousing"" applies far too often.  Twentieth scene of a brass section playing sad music from a VW composition, cut quickly to a war scene from AFTER the composition was premiered, back to the twentieth view of the violin or cellos or four bass players.  Military music, cut to thirtieth snippet of brass section, cut to scenes from WW II, back to the bass, over to a soprano and baritone, cut a scene of the U.S. Stealth plane that seems as much an advertisement for a weapon as a condemnation of it.  There are some interesting interviews (John Adams, Andre Previn, Sir Adrian Boult, et al).

8240998,4,B00118DQX8,"Tony Palmer's lengthy (148 minutes) documentary on English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958) proceeds in a timeline from the composer's birth through his life, music and events and generously shares music videos and performances of the composer's work. As a composer that portrayed the devil in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Job-A-Masque-for-Dancing/dp/B00000DNQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Job A Masque for Dancing</a>, the vast emptiness of Antarctica in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Symphony-No-7/dp/B000005GHU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Symphony No. 7</a>, and expressed controlled rage in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Symphony-No-6/dp/B0000023AX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Symphony No. 6</a>, Palmer wisely describes RVW as hardly the simple pastoralist many consider; an underlying tension in his music, the film shows, comes from his personal experience in the ambulance corps during World War I (where 6 of the 8 people he enlisted with were killed including fellow composer George Butterworth) and his sensitivity to his own and others' interpersonal conflicts.

What keeps this film from being electric is its English pace and methodology, which is to say it's fairly slow and plays out in a predictably linear fashion. It has many affecting sections that underline the narration and first person commentary from RVW family members, friends and cohorts in the musical world. But the plain fact is this is a slow-moving documentary that occasionally borders on dullness. When I compare it to the last composer bio I watched,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Khachaturian/dp/B0002Y4SQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Khachaturian</a>, the differences were stunning, day and night in terms of number of film clips used, overall pacing, and rapidity with which the parts accelerated.

But, like the differences between the garish and sometimes superficial music from Aram Khachaturian and the more sophisticated and accomplished compositions from Ralph Vaughan Williams, this film has greater substance. There is more to discuss about this composer's life, much the reason it takes 2 hours and 28 minutes to say it all. What adds depth is RVW's personal agenda -- his despair over the Great War and the disappointment from his first marriage (the rage that led to the Symphony No. 4) -- that helped form his agenda.

Though most know English folk music was one of RVW's driving forces, he was more than a painter of sentimental  musical portraits. Vaughan Williams regularly projects undercurrents of dissatisfaction, fear, even bleakness, sometimes in his works considered pastoral such as the Symphony No. 5, the Tallis Fantasy, or the Norfolk Rhapsody. When one listens to an appropriate reading of such music, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-one/dp/B000000AG5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this one</a>, you can hear the tension beneath the nice veneer on top. This duality is commonplace in Vaughan Williams' music and this film helps you understand where the mismatch came from.

The film includes testimony and performances from a lot of famous people -- conductors Adrian Boult, Sian Edwards and David Wilcocks, composers Michael Tippett and John Adams, the compser's wife Ursula and widows of Barbirolli and Holst, Mark Turnage, Jordi Savall, Simon Keenlyside, Joan Rogers and many others. The musical sections are more generous in this than most composer biographies and all are used to demonstrate his changing musicianship throughout his lifetime.

I have one gripe about the production -- not enough onscreen titles. They don't always identify the music being played and, while most speakers are identified the first time they appear, if you forget them, you're not going to get much help remembering them in their next appearance. Created in 2007 for the 50th anniversary of the composer's death, this is, with some warts, a good addition to the list of composer bios. Anyone interested in Ralph Vaughan Williams the man or the composer will find something new here.",1334793600,2,4225,6.213675213675214
8240999,5,B00118DQX8,"Not to take anything away from Tony Palmer and his achievement, but there was another documentary/bio of Vaughan Williams.  In the 1980s Ken Russell the great cinema bad boy created a documentary with the aid of VW's widow, his second wife Ursula.  Whether it is currently available or not, it was broadcast both in Britain and the U.S.  My memory tells me it was around 60 minutes, but it could have been longer.  Its premise was the study of contrasts in VW's life: an agnostic who wrote some of the most beautiful church music, a patriot who was a socialist and a pacifist, a musical modernist who found his voice through England's musical past (e.g., folk songs and the works of Tallis and Byrd).",1315267200,2,700,4.620967741935484
8241000,5,B00118DQX8,"This is a brilliant account of the life and the music of Ralph Vaughan Williams, made by Tony Palmer. All RVW's major works are treated, mostly chronologically, and justice is done for every symphony right through to No. 9. The commentators are excellent - a major contributor is Michael Kennedy, his biographer who knew RVW and had written extensively on his work. There are insights into RVW's married life and, subsequently, interesting interpretations of the symphony that has caused much speculation, No. 4. One of the best features is the use of recorded comments over a number of years by RVW himself referring to aspects of his own life and music. I was waiting for reference to The Pilgrim's Progress and, appropriately this came towards the end, reviewing RVW's life-long interest. The standout moment for me was the mother's impassioned lament for her sons in ""Riders to the Sea"".  (Unfortunately there are no references to Hugh the Drover, Sir John in Love or The Poisoned Kiss: I guess they just couldn't fit these in without exploring a sub-theme). The film music was well-covered. Tony Palmer makes use of a wide variety of people for commentaries and his examples from The Sea Symphony should draw people to this work: I could almost feel the seaspray coming from the loudspeakers and you certainly see plenty of the sea in action. Despite its 150 minutes in length, I found it riveting viewing all the way through.",1294185600,,1431,4.888888888888889
8241001,2,B00118DQX8,"There are good things about this documentary.  Some of the interviews are great.  The music and musicians are well-integrated into the film.  The musical selections provide a good balance between the well-known pastoral works and lesser-known pieces.  The later symphonies show that Vaughan Williams's creativity never flagged and I'm glad that this documentary featured them.

But the film is marred by a lack of focus and a heavy-handed opinionated approach.  A disproportionate amount of screen time goes to a revisionist biographer whose name escapes me.  Some of it was interesting but I'd have preferred more meat and less fluff.

The low point, and the reason for the 2-star review, is the montage of horrific scenes illustrating man's inhumanity to man.  The idea is relevant: Vaughan Williams was marked by his experiences as an ambulance driver in WWI and by the friends who didn't come back from it, like George Butterworth.  The execution of this idea though is brutally and amateurishly clumsy.  I get that the 6th Symphony is bleak, I don't need to be hit over the head with it.  And I'd like to be able to listen to it without having it tainted by the filmmaker's vision of it.

Unlike other viewers, I don't want the 2+ hours back.  I want my joy in Vaughan Williams's music back.",1289520000,11,1296,4.858447488584475
8241002,2,B00118DQX8,"If you're any kind of fan of RVW or British music in general then this documentary is a must.  But it pains be to say it.  Tony Palmer, the filmmaker, has a reputation as a great documentarian and as the keeper-of-the-torch for classical music, but this is a puzzle to me as I have always found that the mark of a great documentarian is to tell me everything about the subject and nothing about himself.  Sadly, one of the great figures in classical music is subjected to an insidious affectation of Palmer's whereby if he feels that the composer's music was inspired by terrible socio-political events then he is compelled to edit together a corresponding video montage of often completely unrelated war atrocities.  Dead children from the middle east, famine victims from Africa - contemporary tragedies which have absolutely nothing to do with Ralph Vaughan Williams - are depicted through the use of the most shocking and gratuitous footage.  And, to make this deplorable editorializing even worse, these montages (as well as those of the English countryside and the great English cathedrals) are not particularly well-thought out, well-executed or well-integrated into the whole.  The upside is the wide range and quality of the contributors like Michael Kennedy and Ursula Vaughan Williams.  I wonder what she might have thought of Palmer's nonsense had she lived to see it....",1271894400,9,1383,5.066079295154185
8241003,5,B00118DQX8,"OK, I'll admit it. Call me shallow and sentimental, call me a lover of pastoral fluff. But Ralph Vaughan Williams is my favorite composer. There you have it.

Until I saw this treat of a documentary, however, I knew surprisingly little about the man. For me he was a black box, out of which came sounds that epitomized 20th century English composition in all its non-Continental, non-intellectualized glory.

And for the record, as the film points out, and as anyone who actually listens to Vaughan Williams will tell you, his music goes far beyond pastoral fluff. There is real darkness there as well, reflecting his experience in World War I and the turbulence of World War II -- not to mention difficulties in his first marriage. One family eyewitness, for example, calls his 4th Symphony a ""rage"" against his first wife.

That is the kind of first-hand familiarity with the subject that this documentary is filled with. It is a welcome relief to have not only experts and biographers, but also friends, associates and family members commenting on Vaughan Williams' life and work. (Not to mention quite a few spliced-in voiceovers by Vaughan Williams himself.) The same type of first-hand knowledge was also characteristic of the only other Tony Palmer documentary I have seen to date -- his treatment of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maria-Callas/dp/B000S84NMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maria Callas</a>. I plan to look up more of Palmer's classical documentaries.

Other reviewers have complained about the graphic images of suffering children contained in the film, which are intended to convey the horrors that lie behind the composer's work. I can see their point. The images are gratuitous and they were a mistake in this film. But not a fatal one. Overall, this is a great work for anyone interested in Vaughan Williams and his music. Five stars and more -- highly recommended!",1267574400,5,1933,5.30718954248366
