2219949,3,B0007M6PLE,This is an interesting documentary based on the value of its being a  tribute to Spencer Tracy by Katherine Hepburn.  It was produced for public television in 1986 and is interesting because of the people involved and is a valuable piece of history.  It is also a bit slow moving and drags in parts.  Katherine's letter to Spencer at the end drags on way too long!  It meant a lot to her though.  I'm glad I saw it.,1215302400,3,415,4.256410256410256
