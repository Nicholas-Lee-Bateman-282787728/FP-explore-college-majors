2654201,5,B000IB0DEE,I wanted this DVD because I graduated from Marshall and was there during this time frame and the DVD brought back soooo many memories.  Excellent service.,1329868800,,154,4.923076923076923
2654202,4,B000IB0DEE,"The Ashes to glory story of Marshall University was very interesting, sad, and motivational. It is amazing to hear the true story. The DVD arrived early and was exactly what i had asked for.",1327104000,,190,4.617647058823529
2654203,5,B000IB0DEE,I was a pilot for Southern Airways and knew the Crew very well - when I see how many lives it affected it hurts - enjoyed the DVD,1294358400,2,129,3.642857142857143
2654204,3,B000IB0DEE,"This is a good documentary for seeing the real people, and hearing the real timeline, but it is a dull, plodding documentary.  The overly dramatic (and sometimes overly loud) score, the childish animation (a blazing football) and the inability to make you care from the beginning mar this story.

Told in bits and pieces interspersed with footage from later seasons, interviews with families that lost parents (but none with families that lost players), no background as to why Lengyl felt the need to help out...honestly, it was boring.

I mean no disrespect to anyone involved with Marshall - this just wasn't the documentary to honor any of them.",1275868800,3,649,4.9907407407407405
2654205,5,B000IB0DEE,Having seen the movie We Are Marshall I wanted to dive deeper into the tragic story of the plane crash and the teams (as well as the towns) recovery. The interviews were great and the non-Hollywood story was just incredible.,1204934400,5,224,4.625
2654206,5,B000IB0DEE,This video was very informative. I enjoyed it very much.  It explained a great deal about the actual event.,1204243200,3,107,4.631578947368421
2654207,5,B000IB0DEE,"Watching this documentary brought back many memories of that ill-fated night.  My mother was a librarian at the James E. Morrow Library.  I saw the way it changed her, for she knew all but six people on that plane.  I attended many funerals during the weeks after.  I watched as the team, university, and the town recovered.  This documentary portrays the real images and feelings of the time.  I know because I witnessed it first hand.  I am grateful to Deborah Novak, a Marshall graduate, for telling the story that should have been told long before.  A much better presentaion than the Hollywood version!!  The story of Marshall University Football, its tragedy and triumphs, is THE life lesson that sports teaches us.",1198108800,15,721,4.844262295081967
2654208,5,B000IB0DEE,"I, being a former member of the Marshall football team (1967), a 1971 graduate of MU, and had known several of the players who died in the 1970 crash, this documentary tells of the true situation of Marshall Univ. before and after the trajic plane crash.  The recent movie, WE ARE MARSAHLL, told the storyline, but not exactly the truth.  After seeing that movie, I ran to Amazon to get this documentary that I had seen several years earlier on TV. I am really glad I did.  It brought back for me the deserving honor to the team members, the coachs, the supporters, and others who died on that cold, rainy, night in Novemeber 1970.  A night I'll never forget.",1172361600,30,659,4.466666666666667
2654209,5,B000IB0DEE,"I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE CD THAT I PURCHASED.  THE SHIPPING WAS EXCELLENT, AND WAS FOR A GIFT WHICH THEY THOUGHT WAS GREAT.  THANK YOU.",1168300800,4,136,4.1923076923076925
2654210,5,B000IB0DEE,"This is a thrilling, moving story of the tragic plane crash that wiped out the Marshall football team in the early 1970's, and the courageous, uplifting recovery by the families, the team, the university and the whole city. Interviews with people who were there and rare footage of the team and others make this one of the most interesting (and authentic) sports documentaries I have ever seen.",1163030400,39,394,4.895522388059701

2654216,5,B000IB0DEE,"I was watching one of my favorite movies this weekend - WE ARE MARSHALL, and I noticed a reference to this documentary. Of course I HAD to see it. I really enjoyed watching it, after seeing the movie. The documentary is well done and covers the 1970 plane crash and the aftermath of the tragedy. You actually get to meet the real people that were there and involved. They talk to the football players and others that did not make the flight for various reasons. There is always someone that gave up their seat for another, and this was true on this flight as well. These things make you pause and reflect. Survival guilt is always present when something like this happens. I was amazed at how many children were left orphaned because of this plane crash. Such a heart-wrenching situation! The people associated with the school and town were resilient, and have healed and recovered...but NEVER forget. Such a thing changes all involved, and makes those who were not, take pause. I enjoyed this documentary very much.",1412812800,,1016,4.713483146067416
2654217,5,B000IB0DEE,"As a Marshall alum, the telling of the story is very important to me. It's important to the entire school, no matter when you went there. It's our story and proof that the term ""We are Marshall"" is more than a chant. It's who we are. Strong, resilient, and fighters. Survivors.",1387756800,,277,4.450980392156863
2654218,5,B000IB0DEE,The best video you can get for the real story of the plane crash and rise of the Marshall football program. Amazon needs to change their review though.  This came out long before the We Are Marshall movie and is not a tie-in at all.,1384387200,,232,4.155555555555556
2654219,5,B000IB0DEE,"This film is far superior to the other documentary The Return of the Thundering Herd. I had copied this from t.v. but when saw it on Amazon decided to order the DVD.  This has some things that were not on the PBS showing and is, of course, much nicer than my copy.  It is very well done and brings that event to life so that you have a real feeling of what this tragedy meant to this town. I highly recommend it.",1377043200,,412,4.012195121951219
