Seeing the other band members and how they've aged is a kick, but hearing what them and others have to say about Joe makes it worth buying. Wait until Amazon gets some new stock in - it's good but it's not $90-$100 good.",1441584000,,359,4.070422535211268

8332974,5,B001PCNYGY,"I love this DVD because I believe Joe Strummer is probably the greatest front man in music history. I first heard the Clash when I saw Rock the Cashbah on MTV when I was eight and pretended I was in the group playing a string instrument he had fire and passion. I hate when people try to use this song to promote war in the middle east this is the furthest from the truth and not what Joe Strummer was about (Google how Joe Strummer felt about Rock the Cashbah being played on the AFN during the Gulf War). I only wish this man would have made more music with Mick Jones, Topper Headon and Paul Simonon it is sad that this group  only lasted six or seven years because they put together classic album. Thank you Mr. Joe Strummer and the Clash for writing and singing beautiful and passionate music.",1431129600,,798,4.28476821192053
