1502996,4,B00005JM20,"Rowen Atkinson is Johnny English, a man working at MI7 (though parts of the movie say MI5) as support to the field agents.  When all the agents die, he is given the opportunity to protect the Crown Jewels, which get stolen from under his nose.  He is then assigned to find out who stole the Jewels and retrieve them.  Followed by his assistant, whom Johnny is constantly giving secret agent advise to, he embarks on this mission.
Granted, this movie is another spoof of the James Bond movies, but while others compare it to Austin Powers with a little Bean and The Naked Gun mixed in, I would prefer to compare it to the Pink Panther/Inspector Clouseau movies - only much funnier.  Now, mind you, I rarely see comedy films in the theatre and most comedies in my opinion are almost never really funny, the films may get at best a smile out of me with their humor.  This movie actually had some lines that made me chuckle (the Austin Powers movies got me to smile).  While most of the movie's plot is predictable, the scene where Johnny finally gets his man, Pascal Sauvage (played by John Malkovich) is a refreshing twist on the roles of England's government.  The only thing that comes to mind of what I didn't like in this film was John Malkovich's very horrible attempt at creating a Frenchman's accent while speaking English. The best he was able to give sounded more Creole, or Cajun, which while the latter is a dialect of French and both are common in Louisiana, they are not true to the country he is supposed to represent.  What I thought was very interesting and even a spoof in its own right, was that the main title theme was performed by a group called Bond.",1058659200,,1670,4.488448844884489
1502997,4,B00005JM20,"Rowan Atkinson has been a staple of British comedy for over 20 years.  He plays a most familar character to people familar to him, the bumbler who tries to bluff his way through things.
Many of the scenes in this movie are predicatable but funny  many others were just out there and laugh out loud VERY laugh out loud.  Where I was the crowd went from one extreme to another.
It isn't a movie to be seen twice, the predicatable laughs are still laughs but the laugh out loud scenes are just not to be missed.
worth the money, not sure if its a buyer",1058572800,2,549,4.20952380952381
1502998,3,B00005JM20,"This film has already been released here in Colombia, which is weird since usually films arrive here late rather than before they are released in U.S.A. I saw two days ago and well, I have a things to say to the audiences from the states. You could say this film is a mixture between Naked Gun, Bean and Austin Powers. One thing I found negative about it is that it copies jokes from various comedies, I don't want to be a spoiler so I won't say which, but some of the jokes will seem very familiar. But the good thing about it is that is not a waste of a film, and Rowan Atkinson proves that he can also be funny talking. I think he did quite well as the other James Bond spoof. He is not as exagerated as Mike Myers, so this film is different. And he managed to stay away from the Bean persona, something I was afraid of. The plot is as simple as Bond plots are today, only with various comedy twists. Johnny English starts as Monneypenny, he is just a in this particular film, MI7 clerk, until every agent is wiped off(funny situation that will not be revealed here) so he has to take on the biggest mission that was pending, which involves the crown jewels and a french tycoon in the sort of Goldfinger played by John Malkovich, who did his best to perform the character with dignity, and I think he escapes from stinking by the fingernails. The film is carried out just like Bond movies, the agent meets the girl, the villan, something happens, he gets close to something, he fails, he gets close to the girl, the bad guy almost makes it, but fails and gets busted, endind with the agent and the girl. Very straightforward, but every situation is filled not to the brim, which I think was the smart thing to do, with funny situations. And although many of the jokes are rip-offs, Atkinson managed to make them his own. The film is very short, but feels longer, I don't know why. The end is rather stupid, but I admit that it stirrs laughter, not because of the situation but because you can't help but crack up with Atkinson's face. I don't think many people will like, unlike the Bean skits and the film, I think some will find it stupid and unnecessary, but nevertheless, I think is a fun movie, and if somehow people get tired of or don't want to see either Matrix Reloaded, or Hulk, or X2, or T3, or any of the other box-office killers, try to tke about and hour and twenty minutes to see a silly but funny little comedy that spoofs James Bond. I don't think it will be a hit, and if it is, oh the humanity, because it's far from being great, but it's worth the money, specially in summer vacation when there is basically ""nothing"" to do. See all of the other summer pop corn movies before this one, otherwise you will probably hate it beacuse you could have seen something else. But it won't be a total waste of money, you will laugh because it's not at all a stupid teen flick with disgusting sexual situations and fluids, sounds and smells. It has it it's own very silly and simple way, integrity and dignity, it's hard to find, but it is there. One star for Atkinson's performance, the other for being balance in it's jokes, the other because it doesn't fall apart like many comedies, in stupidity and desperate necesity for a laugh, and the last one because it basically does not totaly stink.",1056067200,26,3307,4.361426256077796
1502999,4,B00005JM20,"Rowan Atkinson is very funny in this ""Mr Bean meets James Bond"" comedy.  Plenty of pratfalls and camera mugging together with the inevitable English toilet humor.  And I mean TOILET humor literally!  The ever-popular ""take over the world"" plot is given a slight twist thanks to the twisted characterisation of John Malkevich (alias Pascal Sauvage)and his droll patience with the inept Johnny English's attempts to thwart his plans make for some head-shaking chuckles. This is a film that all the family can enjoy and the kids are especially tickled by Johnny English's ability to rise above his own ineptitude.  Lots of belly laughs and good fun.

1503000,5,B00005JM20,"... the offspring was Johnny English. Rowan Atkinson delivers another incredibly funny performance as the secret agent who can't do anyhting right and still manages everytime to save the day. Script writers were right on target when they decided to create Johnny English resembling Atkinson's most known character: Mr. Bean. It's all there: the funny faces, the stupid situations, the babbling, the confusion. If you are aquainted with Mr. Bean, you've already seen it all, but you're going to laugh again.
I said there are stupid situations, but the movie is not stupid at all. Extremely well produced, with the classy kind of humor that doesn't need any swearing. Every scene contains an intelligent joke; in fact, only once I found a joke I didn't like. There are some memorable scenes that made me laugh even on my way back home.
Rowan Atkinson is, obviously, perfect for the character, and it was in fact written for him. He does a splendid job, but he will be forever stigmatized as a ""Mr. Bean"" actor, even if there were times when I could glimpse him as a more serious actor.
Natalie Imbruglia surprised me as the mandatory pretty girl in spy movies. She doesn't let the viewer down. John Malkovich once again as the villain, this time as the effeminate frenchman trying to accomplish a strange evil plan on england. In fact, the mere presence of Malkovich in the cast is proof of a good production. Ben Miller did a good job as well as Johnny English's sidekick.
""Johnny English"" is a perfect movie in the genre it was purposed to be: hard-laughing, above-average-intelligence comedy. 90 minutes of fun.
Grade 9.0/10",1051142400,37,1625,4.827956989247312
1503001,4,B00005JM20,"Johnny English is unashamedly a spoof on the James Bond series of movies, and hilarious with it! Movie promo ""He Knows No Fear. He Knows No Danger."" He Knows Nothing. Rowan Atkinson delivers a very controlled performance of a character which is a hybrid between TV's 'Mr Bean' and his Insp. Raymond Fowler in the 1995/96 BBC television series 'The Thin Blue Line'.  Johnny is attached to MI5 and believes he has the suave, debonair Bond persona, even to the point of having all the Bond gadgets and driving an Astin Martin sports car.  In reality he is a bumbling idiot, adept at using the wrong gadgets and making the wrong decisions.  The role may have been created just for Atkinson and indeed, it is hard to imagine anyone else playing Johnny English with such finess.  The obligatory love interest is provided by Natalie Imbruglia (Australian singer/actress) as Lorna Campbell, the vixen, or is she?  The villain of the piece is John Malkovich as a scheming Frenchman, Pascal Sauvage, who has a penchant for the Crown Jewels and is the object of Johnny's disaster laden adventure.  Ben Miller is a brilliant foil for Atkinson's comedy, at times providing his own brand of hilarity in the role of Bough, the offsider to Johnny English. This is 90 minutes of sheer fun and provided the cinema audience here with some of the best comedy in years.  Predictable but a most hilarious romp.",1050883200,9,1388,4.758333333333334
1503002,4,B00005JM20,"When James Bond thought it is safe again to save the world, in comes another spy spoof with a difference, it stars Rowan Atkinson..
While the Canadian Anglophile Mike Myers did it so well with Austin Powers, adding a lot of surreal touches, Rowan Atkinson is the real deal, creating a spy that has inherited a lot from the characters that has made his name over the years, Mr Bean with his muscle and face twitchings and helplessness, and Blackadder with his nasty but harmless remarks, especially against the French.
There are also elements of Inspector Clouseau too, Johnny English is too a loner who happens to be responsible for a big case just by incredible turn of events. A 'idiot' who happens by sheer good luck to solve the case against all the odds, with an annoyed superior and a faithful deputy who saves the day.
Although there are brilliant comedy moments in the film esp in the sushi restaurant, and some well timed slapstick which seems a rarity in comedy films these days, the script is somehow uneven in places,but it all works out fine at the end.
John Malkovich plays yet again another 'psycho' but as good an actor as he is, he always delivers flawlessly, while the gorgeous Nathalie Imbruglia returns to acting after a break for a successful music career and is quite good as English's side kick.
Peter Howitt,the ex TV star of the sitcom Bread turned director (he has to his name Sliding Doors and Anti Trust),proves to have made a good career move.
In short,Johnny English is a funny movie, is Rowan Atkinson's movie, tailored for his abilities and talent, one that will leave you with a genuine smile or two.",1050883200,4,1633,4.653979238754325
1503003,4,B00005JM20,"This was an extra on the ""Bourne Identity"" rental DVD.  It may be the best bits but it whetted my appettite to see the rest.  Rowan Atkinson dryly shakes and not stirs Mr. Bean and James Bond and it's a happy marriage.  ""I can assure you sir, that this is the most secure location in all of England"" is going to be one of those bar reunion replay scenes, when everyone is doubled over in drunken laughter thinking of the look on Rowan's face.

1503111,4,B00005JM20,"I give it low three stars. My family gives it a solid four star rating.

Why did I give it so low of a rating. It really does not mesh with my sense of humor. Although I did chuckle here and there.
I didn't buy this for me though so I can say that it was a hit with my family and that is enough sometime.

Johnny English knows nothing. Really. He bumbles around finding the crown jewels. His butler and his wife help him behind the scenes. There is slapstick humor and toilet humor and plays on words. This movie has some greatly funny parts and some low key humorous parts but generally almost every scene is an opportunity to laugh or smile.

This is not what I would consider a 007 spoof. I say that because although it is somewhat 007ish, you can watch this movie having never watched a 007 movie and still find enjoyment. This is not an over the top movie like Austin Powers and this is not a serious movie like 007. This is a funny movie with a plot that the whole family can enjoy. That is the important part- it's not offensive, not too serious and stuffy, and there are not parts where I felt that I had to cover my kids eyes for those few minutes.

I would certainly watch it again with my family.",1492473600,,1207,4.145299145299146

1503219,5,B00005JM20,"What if Mr. Bean was a spy...and could form articulate sentences...?  Penned by the lead writers of the last several Bond films Johnny English features comic genius Rowan Atkinson as the unlikely hero surrounded by a talented cast.  Natalie Imbruglia sparkles as Johnny's foil and romantic interest and Ben Miller charms as his competent but under appreciated subordinate.  Finally John Malkovich chews the scenery as only he can.  The film's only flaw is that it doesn't quite seem to know how serious it wants to be, a dilemma common with many comedies that straddle the line between action thriller and screwball comedy.

1503793,5,B00005JM20,"Silly fun. I love Rowan Atkinson--and his 'Johnny English' is a fusion of both Black Adder and Mister Bean.

A fun, energetic, fast-paced Bond spoof, with John Malkovich as an enjoyably egomaniacal Bond Villain planning to usurp the British Throne.
The premise is that the villain's catastrophic master-strike has eliminated every trained field agent in the Secret Service, and into this crisis only Johnny English --a bumbling desk clerk who dreams of Double-O status--is left alive to step into the void. He finds himself catapulted to ranking Top Agent by default, before any of his shell-shocked superiors can realize how hopelessly incompetent he truly is.
Hilarity ensues.

There's a pretty girl. Special effects and stunts worthy of an actual Bond flick. An absolutely essential, endlessly loyal, Baldric-esque assistant/straight man. A script that successfully walks a fine line between suspension of belief and total absurdity. And a killer theme song that's worthy of the real Bond franchise.

'Johnny English' succeeds hilariously where the later remake of 'Get Smart' mostly fell short of their mutual premise, an aspiring Walter Mitty bumbler suddenly thrust into License To Kill status.

It's fun. It's silly. We've watched it half a dozen times. This one's a keeper. And the theme song is worth having as an MP3.
There's also a sequel: 'Johnny English Reborn'. Check it out.

Hope this review is helpful. Enjoy!",1416614400,,1426,5.26431718061674

What a treat this movie was, from start to finish.

Rowan Atkinson is soooo funny. I can't remember laughing that much, in a long, long time. I felt great afterwards. A stress-buster of the very best kind.

This is family entertainment at it's best.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

1504036,4,B00005JM20,"I love this movie!  Before I get into details, I will tell you a little about myself.

I live in Toronto, Canada and I enjoy movies.  I am a huge Rowan Atkinson fan.  I own the complete series of Mr. Bean, both Mr. Bean films Bean the Movie and Mr. Bean's Holiday, all of Mr. Bean: The Animated Series, both this film Johnny English and it's sequel Johnny English Reborn and even a vintage min tin 1989 Mr. Bean action figure!  I am also a fan of James Bond.

In November 2011, I saw a TV ad for the 2011 sequel to Johnny English entitled Johnny English Reborn.  I had never seen the first film.  I thought because I was a fan of Rowan Atkinson, I might enjoy Johnny English Reborn.  I saw it and I loved it!

A few weeks later, I was watching TV to see what was on.  I found Johnny English!  Unfortunately, the movie was almost over.  I turned off the TV and went to bed.

The next morning, I went to a local HMV and found this film for five dollars.  I bought it and watched it that evening.  I loved it!

WARNING: THE NEXT PARAGRAPH IS A SPOILER ALERT

I understand that some people do not like this film because of it's anti-Catholic scenes.  Near the end of the film, there is a scene where Johnny English(Rowan Atkinson) pulls down a priest's pants and you can see his bare buttox.  Being a Roman Catholic myself, I found this scene both offensive and funny.  That scene is the only reason why I am giving this film four stars instead of five.

SPOILER ALERT ENDED

Overall, Johnny English is a very funny movie which will get both audiences young and old crying with laughter.  I recommend this film.

Atkinson is hilarious here and Ben Miller as his sidekick is also very funny in a subdued way, dutifully putting up with and attempting to gloss over Atkinson's absurdities.  Natali Imbruglia is the lovely heroine constantly managing to get Atkinson out of one jam after another.  I'm not completely convinced of John Malkovich's playing a Frenchman, but he was OK and funny at times.  Although you might not think it, the picture greatly benefits from being in Blu-ray having some, but not quite enough for me, beautiful shots of London.  An exceptionally  enjoyable picture as an updated Pink Panther type of movie but with really fresh ideas.",1348185600,,729,4.934426229508197

1504043,5,B00005JM20,"I was in graduate school at the University of Washington in Seattle in the 1960s. Seattle had four art theaters at the time and all showed foreign films, a rarity at that time. I became an English comedy aficionado. Some of the films were just hilarious and so much different than American comedies. I can't remember the movies themselves, but some of the leading actors were Alec Guiness, Peter Sellers and Terry Thomas, plus I'm probably shorting a few others. In any case, I loved their comedies. The could be very visual and slapstick or subtle and droll, or a mixture. One thing was certain. They were very funny.

I totally lost track of British comedies over the past few decades, then all of a sudden I became aware of Mr. Bean as played by Rowan Atkinson. It's the old British comedy through and through. Trust me. I've watched the Mr Bean Series and then Bean, The Movie. Very funny. Try them, you might like them, but it takes a certain twisted mind.

In any case, Rowan Atkinson is also responsible for ""Johnny English,"" a DVD movie I watched last night. I found it on the five dollar rack at Wal-Mart. English, played by Atkinson, was a bumbling government secret agent. It seems the queens jewels were stolen and English was the only available secret agent who might solve the crime. Pity the British people. Johnny English is a bumbler of the first order. His foot is firmly in his mouth, right up to the knee. Almost nothing goes right as he bumbles his way through the mystery. And it's funny. Lot's of laughs roll out, some of them side splitters. It's an old-time British comedy, all over again. The acting was.... Well, you wouldn't expect great acting on this kind of farce, would you? Expect a lot of distorted facial expressions and things of that sort. It fits. The filming is quite good and some of the stunts rival those of the Keystone Kops. It's all a good time. I finished the DVD with a smile on my face.

As per the DVD, we used a PS3 to watch it which supposedly up-converts it, either way the video quality was excellent. Another nice feature of the dvd is 5.1 audio.

Rowan Atkinson is simply one of the most masterful comedy actors of our generation. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys clean, clever, silly, endearing, funny comedies.

Personally the casting department could have done a better job such as adding Liz Hurley to be the female agent, she's better known for her roles in movies like Austin Powers, International man who shagged me, another Austin Powers movie, but since this was a lower budget film I guess they got what they could.

That said, this film doesn't really suffer from dry British comedy; but there just aren't enough scenes to keep the audience laughing, only the middle of the film where we find Johnny English unsuccessfully trying to be like Tom Cruise in ""Mission Impossible"" and working undercover while injecting himself with a nerve agent is the best selling point of this film.  Too sum it up, it's like The Naked Gun & Austin Powers rolled up into a moderately low budget film.

Wasting a starlet this photogenic on a prepubescent knockoff of Austin Powers should be considered a snickering form of inverse sexual harassment. In fact, I have to wonder whether it wasn't this stinker that set off the listless downward spiral of her once-promising career.

After the spectacular breakout of Imbruglia's ""Torn"" music video in 1997, her follow-up releases failed to measure up to her initial success. And as her big-screen debut in Johnny English inspired little more than catcalls from movie critics, Imbruglia took refuge in a five-year spokesmodel contract with L'Oreal. After a long absence from music, her 2009 come-back album subsequently vanished without comment. Currently, Imbruglia has found a comfortable gig in the Paula Abdul role in Australia's ""The X Factor"" knockoff of American Idol.

Perhaps the most humiliating turn of events, however, has been the fate of Imbruglia's ""Torn"" video on YouTube. While the original version has garnered over 2.2 million views, it was recently edged out in popularity by the bedroom karaoke performance of fresh-faced amateur vocalist, Marie Digby.

It is one of an outstanding comedy films that combines the clumsiness, laughing out loud moments, and romantic scenes of Rowan Atkinson who is a director himself. It can be described as the combination of Mr. Bean and James Bond 007.

The film has some similarities in both Mr. Bean and James Bond 007. There are many moments in Johnny English that remind the viewers of Mr. Bean. One of them is when Atkinson is in the shower with a duck toy that babies usually play with when they take a shower. This film is different from Mr. Bean due to the fact that the viewers will not be able to hear audiences laughing when Atkinson does something stupid that we usually hear from watching Mr. Bean. It is a film not one of the series that ends in half an hour. The film itself takes about one hour and twenty-eight minutes. In Mr. Bean, the viewers can easily notice that Atkinson plays in the role of a mute person, but not in Johnny English. He speaks with his British Accent in Johnny English. It is also different from James Bonds 007 on account of the film being taken only in United Kingdom instead of all over the world.",1174435200,,1247,4.351931330472103
1504226,4,B00005JM20,"When I was in the mood for a spy spoof to watch with a certain James Bond film, I decided to give the Austin Powers films a miss, and sample Johnny English (other hopefuls would be Spy Hard, but my recollection of that film is that I wanted to walk out of the theatre--and then there's Spies Like Us, but, uh, no, not right now).

Johnny English stars George Lazenby--oh no wait, that's Rowan Atkinson--and an Australian with very little acting experience, George Lazenby--oh no wait that's Natalie Imruglia.  It is Atkinson, as the title character, who helps make this a delightful surprise, along with some pretty funny sequences:  for instance, Atkinson having trouble with his tie in a sushi bar, Atkinson involved in a car chase where the car he's in is hanging from the winch of a tow truck.

The knocks against this film, when they come, seem to be as follows: we've had too many spy spoofs, the plot involving John Malkovich as a Frenchman trying to become ruler of England is too ridiculous, and the film isn't that funny.  To all this frippery I say:  how many, exactly, is too many spy spoofs?, this is a comedy and the outrageous, shamefacedly contrived storyline is so brash and amorphous that it's a daring nonsensical joy, and finally, though not all the gags work perfectly, I found I was laughing most of the way through.

Uh, not to put too fine a point on it, but who is saying we have too many spy spoofs...fans of the TWENTY-ONE Bond films?

More thoughts on the gags:  sure, Atkinson's intrusion on a funeral and its results goes on a bit long, and a buttocks-shot joke harks right back to Naked Gun 2(and a half), and the drawn-out results of our bumbling hero's parachute jump onto a skyscraper are only mildly amusing, but there are many more tidbits that I don't want to spoil.  It's not true at all that this film is only funny the first time round; if You Only Watch Once, then you deny yourself repeated exposure to Malkovich's bad French accent, and the guy with the eyepatch, the banana-shaped scars, the bad teeth, and the frizzy orange hair.

I think that Johnny English is pretty consistent in doling out the laughs, and that makes it a success as far as I'm concerned.  We probably won't see a sequel, so those who feel we have too many spy spoofs shall have their petty little victory, I suppose.",1171152000,2,2332,4.5393794749403344

1504287,4,B00005JM20,"""Johnny English"" is a completely unnecessary film, and seems to know it.  Virtually no effort has been made to make this movie anything other than an excuse to watch Rowan Atkinson make a complete fool of himself for 80 minutes.  The question you must ask yourself before watching this movie is, is that enough?

For me, the answer is yes.  I can't explain why - I just find Atkinson to be hysterical.  His scene as the priest in ""4 Weddings and a Funeral"" is the funniest in that hilarious movie, and his brief moments in ""Love Actually"" steal a movie that doesn't want to be stolen.  Others will disagree with those sentiments, and those folks should probably steer clear of ""Johnny English.""

Do we need another James Bond spoof?  Probably not.  Do we need a movie in which a beautiful woman makes a comment to Atkinson, and his response includes the terms, ""plastic toys"" and ""soft cheese""?  I sure did - I had to pause the movie I was laughing so hard.  So for me, the experience of watching Atkinson play a bumbling James Bond figure was wonderful, even though I know the movie isn't a ""good"" film.

Maybe that's part of its charm.  John Malkovich, one of the great actors working today, also seems to know he's in a bad movie.  So he plays the French villain badly, like he's in on the joke.

Who says Austin Powers is the only name in spy spoofs?  Johnny English may not be as flashy, silly or ok maybe even funny as Austin Powers, however he may indeed have more charm, likeability and certainly more believability.

Nearly everything in this cute satire could indeed happen and perhaps that is the funniest - or scariest thing about it.  Austin Powers and Inspector Closeau may be bumblers or more interested in ""shagging"" than in getting the bad guys and saving the world - but Johnny English is focused.  He's always wanted to be a top spy and when he gets his chance he makes the most of it - while making a hilarious mess of it!

Granted the plot and even script are weak, but Rowan Atkinson rises above both and it's his inherent comic genius at timing that really saves the day.  Overall the laughs don't come full throttle, but their are several scenes which had me busting at the seams - and rewinding the DVD again and again.

Rowan does a fantastic job, as he usually does, as the lead Johnny English; the spy who was chosen for this specific mission because all of the other spies are dead.

Rowan Atkinson is superb as the bumbling, inept spy who takes on a high profile case because all of the other agents were killed at the funeral of the Agent No. 1.  Ben Miller is delightful as English's assistant and pop singer Natalie Imbruglia is surprisingly effective as the femme fatale.

1504337,4,B00005JM20,"Being an avid fan of Rowan Atkinson, it was with great anticipation that I saw this movie. I was very interested to see how Atkinson would cope in a full-length feature role that was not Mr Bean.

The character of Johnny English seems to share a lot of the traits of Bean, with the slapstick comedy and so on. Also, like Bean, English has moments of brilliance where he gains some small victory over the circumstances he is placed in. However, there is enough originality in English as a character to make him something new and not just a carbon-copy of Bean in a suit with a gun.

John Malkovich puts in a fine showing as the villianous French guy with designs on the crown and throne of England. Actually, I was really impressed at how genuine he sounded with his French accent, (though I am sure some French people simply cringed!).

While the movie is not going to go down in history as a classic and all-time great, it is certainly a great way to have a laugh or two. I had a ball watching this movie, and recommend it for anyone wanting a light laugh and a good solid dose of it.",1129852800,2,1085,4.3088235294117645

1504339,5,B00005JM20,"Johnny English is definitely one of those movies where you just can't imagine any other actor playing the lead role than the one chosen.  Rowan Atkinson plays a character who is as adorable and driven as he is a pathetic idiot, which actually somehow makes it believable that a female character could fall for him.  Between Johnny English's charm, his joie de vivre, one cannot help but fall in love with this character whose determination constantly leads him to ruin every mission he takes on.  Despite the obvious blunders, it is the subtle moments that cause the greatest laughs.  Atkinson's remarkable timing and his subtle physical actions will bring on the laughs regardless of what script is thrown his way.  I had seen some of his earlier works (Bean) and I actually enjoyed this movie equally, if not more.  Though die hard fans seem to complain this movie does not live up to the Bean legacy, I see this film as a great introduction to Rowan Atkinson for those who have not seen Bean.

No credit seems to go to Johnny English's partner, Bough (pronounced ""Buff"" and brilliantly played by Ben Miller).  Bough is the straight man who can actually get the job done, but due to his rank he must ride in the dangerous wake of his mentor, English.  The way Atkinson and Miller play off each other is astonishing.  Bough seems to recognize English's errors, but cannot admit them either out of respect to his superior, or possibly even sympathy.

This movie contains the perfect balance of slapstick and spy action/adventure.  Certainly there is a moment here or there that I find forced or not as funny as it could have been, but all is forgiven since most of the film leaves me laughing more each time I watch it.",1125273600,3,1719,4.655629139072848
1504340,4,B00005JM20,"The ""spy-spoof"" sub-genre has been a regular staple in comedy films for about 40 years.  As a result, after seeing Flint, Matt Helm, Austin Powers, Cody Banks and many others too obscure to recount, it would seem that the sub-genre has nothing new to offer.  ""Johnny English"" is another entry into to the field, and while it may not be a particularly original spy-spoof it is still enjoyable, largely because of its excellent casting.

The plot revolves around an evil capitalist (is there any other kind) who is launching a master plan to take over England for a purpose too loony to reveal here.  He is played by John Malkovich doing the most over-the-top Frenchman impression since Peter Sellers.  Opposing him is Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson), a bureaucrat for the English government who becomes a secret agent when all of England's other secret agents are killed.

The main thrust of the film's humor comes from Atkinson's portrayal.  Johnny has no training, no talent and isn't particularly smart.  Everyone can see this, except Johnny himself.  For example, there is a running gag about Johnny being unable to effectively use his gun.  In one scene he field strips it and reassembles it, proudly holding it up to reveal he has forgotten to re-insert the trigger.

Despite his shortcommings, Johnny is completely unflappable, in the wondefully stereotypically-English manner that Atkinson so masterfully portrays.  As the screw-ups mount one just wants to shake our hero and scream, ""get a clue.""  And still our hero glosses over his errors and carries on.

Besides, Rowan Atkinson doesn't make the sexiest of hero's to fall in love with as he smashes into the wrong buildings, and constantly bumbles around destroy 'covert' operations.

I expected more, but for once the trailer was funnier than the movie, and frankly, thats never a good thing. You'd rather sit and watch the trailer three times over than spend uninteresting time over the whole movie.

For children maybe this would be interesting, but not for us that expect more out of a film. Quite a letdown, because I waited a long time to see this movie come out to DVD.

A far descendent of French impresario Pascual Savage from the Real Dynasty -the unbeatable John Malkovich- empowers the Jewels of the Crown due he considers the time has come for him to rule the nation to his own style.

There are admirable memories of the previous and famous work of 007  Goldfinger . But also it's a brilliant and surreptitious wink to Henry V.  Our clumsy hero and distorted image of 007 -Johnny English-will be the designed special agent who will stop those machiavellian plans.

Atkinson plays the title character, a bumbling paper-pusher who inadvertently kills all the real MI-7 secret agents.  He's dreamed about being the suave, smooth-talking secret agent, but, in truth, he's the worst agent ever.  Ironically, he is left as England's best agent.  Talk about one heck of a large promotion!  Sounds like that should spell doom for England?

Through his bumbling and misguided style, English (with help from Natalie Imbruglia and Ben Miller) goes toe-to-toe with Pascal Sauvage (played by John Malkovich).

1504398,3,B00005JM20,"There's not much to say about ""Johnny English"" except that it's a reasonably funny film with good acting.  Rowan Atkinson plays Mr. English with less-than-expected buffoonish flair.  I really was hoping that he would bust into one of Mr. Bean's signature screw-ups, but Bean this ain't, so don't expect too much slapstick.  Natalie Imbruglia is lovely as ever, and provides a solid performance as an Interpol agent who helps out English.  Ben Miller is a standout as English's straight-laced sidekick.  He's Watson to English's Sherlock Holmes.  John Malkovich gives an uninspired performance as Pascal Sauvage, who's after the crown.

The film rolls around for about an hour and a half until we get to a big climax that's funny, but leaves you wanting more.  In fact, the entire film plays this way.  You always feel as if every scene could be just a little bit funnier, but for some odd reason, it isn't.

Others have stated that this film tries to be ""Austin Powers,"" but I disagree.  Granted, it is a spy-spoof, but it isn't as blatantly silly as ""Powers.""  It actually comes across to me as an attempt to be a somewhat intelligent, yet dry, spoof of the ""Bond"" flicks with a little Inspector Clouseau thrown in for good measure.

Overall, this isn't a horrible movie.  When it's smart, it's very smart, and the antics of Atkinson are always fun to watch.  However, the movie is just a little too slow and a little too ""blah"" to be considered more than a rental.  If you really love Atkinson, as I do, you'll probably want this for your collection.

Turns out that a French criminal {who owns a most impressive Office Elevator!} with distant ties to the Royal British Family systematically eliminates those who would inherit the title should anything happen to the queen who is threatened with the taking of the life of her beloved poodle, so she signs her title away to him - and just as he is about to be crowned, Johnny English saves the day in a feat of hilarius acrobatics, engaging in many adventures along the way, inclusive of a lunatic display at a fun-eral, swinging around in his sharp spymobile on a crane, literally climbing up a ""poop-shoot"" to access the enemy's lair, parachuting on to a building, predictably, the wrong one, among many other instances interpolated with that distinctive Mr. Bean style, although much more talkative. Although I would have to say that probably the funniest scenes were when he was accidently struck by a muscle relaxer, to which he sloshes and slurrs about the place.
The character is intended to be unintentionally funny, but Atkinson does best as Mr. Bean however, and this film could have just as easily been named ""Bean. Mr. Bean"".

To put it bluntly, I think they expect too much of him in this film. He does not possess the comic genius of say a Peter Sellers, to pull it off.
Sure there are some pretty funny scenes, but the laughs are too few. The movie even stoops to bathroom humor to try and get some laughs, but even this tactic does not really work very well. Therefore, I would not recommend this movie unless you are really in the mood for a spy parody type film.

1504533,3,B00005JM20,"As I watched JOHNNY ENGLISH, I was constantly reminded of the Peter Sellers' Pink Panther movies. Unfortunately, JOHNNY ENGLISH suffered from the comparison. The style and feel is quite similar, and Rowan Atkinson is a funny guy, but many of the gags looked vaguely familiar. When Johnny was practicing his karate moves, I kept expecting Kato to jump out from hiding. Of course, he never did. Much of the movie is like that, and it suffered from the comparison.
JOHNNY ENGLISH also needed more of a plot. The professional reviewer above describes it as ""tepid"", and I agree. It's supposed to be a spoof, so it can get away with being something of a cliche, but despite some creative gags, the plot just doesn't go far. In fact, it would have helped if some of the deleted scenes had been left in. The movie's not very long, so it's not as if they wouldn't fit. For example, the quick shot of John Malkovich's position in the royal family tree is much more meaningful if the scenes that show him bumping off other distant family members is left in. So is his lethal elevator.
JOHNNY ENGLISH has some funny moments, but Atkinson's character comes across as a poor man's version of Inspector Clouseau. This is a comparison that Atkinson should try to avoid. Not that I didn't enjoy this film. I did. But it isn't good enough to rise above a mediocre three stars, nor did I enjoy it enough to want to watch it several times.

Us pursed-lip adults sometimes have to relax, let our facial muscles go(lower those eyebrows, unfurrow the forehead, unpurse our lips, and unclench our jaws) and let humor, even slapstick humor, get the best of us. Some of us are so full of our previous knowledge of movie-viewing or Mr. Bean and Atkinson material(""I saw this and I saw that and this movie just ain't as blablabla"" or ""Atkinson ain't as good in this as in yadayada..."").
Children don't care about the history of movies and Atkinson tv series. Watch kids enjoy this movie. They know how to have a good time in the moment. My kids were in stitches over Atkinson's antics and all his facial expressions.
My husband got a good share of laughs, sometimes to the point of tears---and it is good to see my husband laugh even if it is over Johnny English. Myself? I have to admit I laughed too.

Consider the following example of outrageously unfunny verbal wit: ""I think I'd rather have my bottom impaled on a giant cactus than exchange pleasantries with that jumped up Frenchman,"" says Johnny, unknowing that the 'jumped up Frenchman' is standing right behind him.  It doesn't even raise the ghost of a smile.  Rowan Atkinson should resign himself to the fact that his metier is as the silent Mr. Bean.
The film begins well enough, with an amusing daydream sequence, where Johnny English - pen-pusher at M17 (comic cousin of Britain's M15 spy agency) fantasises about his dangerous, dashing life if he were the notoriously brilliant Agent One.  When Agent One, and the entire M17 spy corps are killed - through English's blunders - his dream becomes reality.  It is up to him to save England from the machinations of a megalomaniac Frenchman, who wishes to claim the British throne and turn the country into a massive prison.
With a plot and characters like these, there is obviously the potential for Johnny English to be a humorous Bond-spoof, but the potential remains largely inactivated.  There are occasional moments of genuine mirth, such as a hearse being chased by a tow truck, and the subsequent scene in the graveyard, but these are few and far between.  The jokes are signposted a mile off, and include juvenile toilet humour.  One does get the impression the scriptwriters were rather low on inspiration and in the resultant morass, one joke is even utilised twice.

1504618,2,B00005JM20,"I love Rowan Atkinson. Love 'im, love 'im, love 'im. The man is funny. But good lord, this movie could have been a whole lot better. Bond via Bean? Yes, but sorely lacking in so many departments...
You see, someone said to some movie executives ""let's make a movie with that Bean guy again and see if it makes more money."" If you haven't seen Bean:The Movie, you shouldn't. It cost probably less than $30 to make and that's including a hefty fee for Burt Reynolds. But it made a killing around the world and thinking of all that money persuaded the studio to offer Atkinson another movie.
The Johnny English character was originally created for Barclaycard (Visa) adverts in the UK in the early 1990's. Amusing, clever, and certainly referential to the Bond franchise, no-one would have considered it ripe for a movie. But hey, when the studio is laying out the cash, anything goes. But then, the studio says ""Well, it has to appeal to the greatest number of potential viewers, so lets leave out a lot of stuff that fans would know and appreciate."" Which is why this movie runs a painfully long 80 minutes. At least that's what the timer read; I kept leaving the room during the more excrutiating moments.
I love Atkinson, I do, but the English character is a mess. You don't know if he's supposed to be a bit thick, a clumsy chump, or just really lucky. There is absolutely nothing to develop him as a person. You don't even know if he's supposed to be an agent or a desk clerk. Rather than a Walter Mitty fantasy, however, English bumbles along from cue to cue and offers Atkinson a chance to do his mugging, which was great for a mute character like Bean, but cringe worthy in a spy spoof.
Malkovich chews through his scenes, but overall, this would have been a great one-hour special for cable instead of the full movie treatment. The DVD has a few specials, but a hastily assembled ""Spy Tips"" feature just re-hashes bits from the movie. I wanted to watch the ""Deleted Scenes"" but decided against it, as I couldn't bear watching what they cut because they hoped to attract more people. There was also a ""Making Of.."" feature, but I gave up after they focused too much on filming one explosion. Good grief, when that's more interesting than the movie, it doesn't bode well. It's middle of the road for a DVD release as far as extras go.
It was reported that Rowan Atkinson took some time off to treat a mild depression after the reviews of this film came back. It's a shame, because he is truly one of the greatest modern comedians that Britain has produced. But I don't think it was his fault. I mean, who walked into the studio meeting and said ""Can our problems be solved by using Natalie Imbruglia in this movie?""
Here's hoping Atkinson exercises a little more caution in the future when choosing film projects; or at least goes with a studio that makes movies for a fanbase instead of a marketing demographic. Two out of five stars.",1076889600,3,2940,4.5281954887218046

This isn't a raunchy spoof of spy movies like the AUSTIN POWER films. Instead, it's more like a comical homage.  JOHNNY ENGLISH reminded me more of Inspector Gadget than Austin Powers and Atkinson's portrayal made me think of a younger Don Knotts.

1504620,4,B00005JM20,"""Johnny English"" is a surprisingly funny spy-spoof starring the hysterical British comedian Rowan Atkinson (aka Mr. Bean).  Being a fan of the British TV series ""Bean"", I was curious to see if Atkinson could break out of his role as the inherently childish Mr. Bean and carry an actual full-length film with his antics.  I'm happy to report that yes, indeed he can!
Yes, the plot is stupid, but it provides Atkinson with plenty of opportunities to work his magic.  Unlike many ""comedies"" nowadays, most of the jokes in this film are actually FUNNY and don't cause you and your movie companion to look quizzically at each other, wondering whether or not THAT was actually supposed to be funny .  Some moments truly made me breakout into hysterical laughter.  Let's see, there's a tie getting caught in a sushi bar roll around, Johnny mistakenly taking the staff of a hospital hostage, the Archbishop of Canterbury's rear end being exposed on national TV, Johnny (again mistakenly) disrupting a funeral service and dancing atop a coffin which he believes contain the crown jewels, the French jokes...  And that's not all ;-)
If you're looking for a good time at the movies, or rather a family-friendlier version of Austin Powers, try ""Johnny English"".  It's relatively inoffensive, funny, and highly entertaining!",1076198400,2,1311,5.013824884792626
1504621,3,B00005JM20,"While this is not exactly a ""good"" movie, it is funny.  There were moments when I laughed hysterically such as when Johnny triumphantly unmasks the Archbishop of Canterbury's derriere, only to find no tattoos.  Oliver Ford Davies who played the Archbishop was a good sport to do that scene.  Rowan Atkinson is someone I've never seen before; and I found his physical comedy to be hilarious.  Neal Purvis and Robert Wade who wrote Bond screenplays for ""Die Another Day"" & ""The World's Not Enough"" actually don't make enough of a coherent plot which would have enhanced the jokes and made the picture hang together.  Greg Wise, who is known for being the father of Emma Thompson's baby, does a great cameo as Agent One.  Singer Natalie Imbruglia as Lorna Campbell is quite beautiful, but one fails to see any real connection with Atkinson.  If his nuttiness had charmed her, we might find their connection more authentic.  I really enjoyed Ben Miller as Bough, the straight man.  He has a great scene coaxing English off a coffin and out of a graveyard when they've followed the wrong hearse.  Director Peter Howitt has ""Laws of Attraction"" coming out with Julianne Moore & Brosnan; I hope there's a better script there.  John Malcovich, who I understand actually lives in France, seems to concentrate more on his accent than anything else.  The DVD deleted scenes are interesting, but one can also see why there were deleted.  The little elevator chamber where unwanted dignitaries meet their demise was an interesting quirk that is cut out.  The DVD game seemed like more effort than bang for the buck, but nice try.

1504624,3,B00005JM20,"I waited for DVD to watch this one, and I'm glad. It's a mediocre film and it's much easier to enjoy a so-so movie at home than when you're paying $8 in a theater.
Johnny English is Rowan Atkinson's spoof on spy films. Yes, it is a spoof. I've seen more than one review that lauds this as a ""serious"" spy movie that simply has funny moments. That's ridiculous. This is a spoof. There is nothing about this plot that is believable or the least bit surprising. Not that that's bad - just please don't think that you are about to view a serious ""spy"" film that has a legitimate plot, a formidable villain and a believable love interest. What it actually is, however, is a pretty funny Mr. Bean-esque romp through England. It's fun watching Atkinson bumble his way through awkward situation after awkward situation. Similar to the Pink Panther films.
The movie's concept is that all the secret agents in England are killed by a terrorist bombing- all except for Johnny English and his sidekick Boff. The timing couldn't be worse for England, since there's a plot uncovered to steal the Crown Jewels. Enter the bad guy, Pascal played by John Malchovich. Now, I have to enter a little side comment here. Malchovich does an accent and he honestly sounds like a Frenchman with brain damage. It just doesn't work. I've probably heard worse, but seriously - it's difficult to concentrate on anything he says.
From here we get to see Atkinson, the least suave spy ever, put in situation after situation where he screws it all up. It's almost always funny. It's when the plot tries to develop that the movie fails a little. It's very unbelievable and has a Frenchman becoming King of England. Overall, it works somewhat, since it clearly defines the movie as a joke and not to be taken seriously, which strengthens the humor in places and weakens it in others.
Natalie Imbruglia plays the mysterious woman whom we all know is really a spy. She's beautiful, and it's worth watching just to look at her for an hour and a half.
All in all, give it a chance. The special features are fun and the movie has laugh out loud moments (Atkinson telling the head of the secret service that they are in the ""most secure place in the whole of England"" just as a huge explosion rings in the background, for example). I think it has some repeat watchability. I don't know that I'd buy it. Rent it first.",1075507200,2,2376,4.553738317757009

Together they thwart a Frenchmen's attempt to become King of England and transform the entire island into a prison for the world's criminals.
Johny helplessly bumbles his way through this movie as only he can. A high speed chase through the streets of London between a hearse and a tow truck, the take over of a hospital and its innocent patients, a five story climb up a sewer pipe leading directly to a bum troff, and finally being crowned King himself!
It must be hard to be a secret agent, you have to keep track of your truth serum and knockout gas, the knowledge to correctly assemble your sidearm, and most of all you must know who is an imposter and who is not.

He gets himself into embarrassing situations and needs help getting out, almost hitting the top of the ""cool"" scale but having life stop him before he gets there.

1504687,4,B00005JM20,"Johnny English (the movie) has two kinds of jokes: the see-'em-coming-a-mile-away kind and the sneak-up-on-you kind. The former are usually not so funny, but the scene is usually saved by one or two of the latter coming immediately afterward. For instance, Johnny English (the man) is climbing up a vertical sewer piper and winds up (wait for it) covered in poo - not so funny. Shortly thereafter,
[spoiler ahead]
English draws his gun and fires a nice little poo bubble
[end spoiler]
- now that's comedy.
English frequently comes off more like a British version of The Naked Gun's Frank Drebin than a bumbling James Bond (a la The Pink Panther's Inspector Clouseau). It's not necessarily bad, but it's been done before (granted, they both have). English does best when he doesn't have his faux suavity engaged and is just trying to get the job done. Co-stars Natalie Imbruglia and John Malkovich do a good job with their roles, as do Ben Miller and the other supporting actors. The Aston Martin DB7 Vantage is a thing of beauty.
The DVD itself makes a poor first impression. No chapter card insert accompanies the disc; not a big deal, but it comes across cheaply. Then there's the forced viewing of three movie trailers; fast-forwarding is permitted, but you can't skip directly to the menu - this happens every time you play the DVD and it gets old halfway through the first time. Once you get to the main menu things get better: there are some nice bonus features and the DVD-ROM extras are enjoyable as well.
This is a well-played spy farce (not quite a full-on Zucker Bros. spoof). It's predictable at times, but always amusing - and frequently laugh-out-loud funny. Check it out.",1074470400,2,1686,4.777397260273973
1504688,2,B00005JM20,"I am a fan of Rowan Atkinson, but after watching Johnny English, I am convinced that Rowan Atkinson is funnier when he relies upon his gifts in the realm of physical comedy.  Given, when his voice is disembodied from him (as it was in his role in Disney's Lion King), he is certainly enjoyable to listen to.  The film left me with a disconnect, however, between his refined British accent and the physical comedy he tried to pull off in JE.
Unlike his Black Adder character, whose pratfalls are simply comedic justice being served for his character's devious conniving, JE is portrayed as a person trying earnestly to be a good secret agent but who ""cocks up"" nearly every endeavor.
While the film gives the viewer a few good laughs, anyone looking for the uproariously funny exploits of a Mr. Bean episode will be sadly disappointed.
The plot is weak, and seems only to be a vehicle to get the viewer to the next gag.  Character development is virtually nonexistent, and the use of the supporting cast is irregular.  The viewer leaves the movie wondering what really transpired between JE and Natalie Imbruglia's beautiful but poorly developed secret agent.  Similarly, the character of Bough is unevenly dispersed throughout the film whenever a gag needs a ""straight man"" for effect.  In fact, all of the characters, including Malkovich's villanous Frenchman, are very static throughout.  If you're looking for character arcs here, don't.  In fact, bring a level, because the characterizations in the film are quite flat.
The few sight gags that are on-target in the film are not exploited for their full comedic value, while others that were not that funny to begin with are revisited ad nauseum.  In short, the movie zigs when it should zag, thereby failing to live up to its comedic potential.  If this is your first brush with Rowan Atkinson, know that he is capable of being much funnier than he winds up demonstrating in this film.  Watch a season of Black Adder, check out Mr. Bean on DVD, or even witness Atkinson in a supporting role in ""Rat Race"" and you will get a better sense of his unique brand of physical comedy and have a much heartier laugh.",1074470400,2,2161,4.751336898395722

This is simply a tedius movie with very few chuckles.  When the two funniest scenes in the movie involve sight gags with Mr. Rowan Atkinson and his gun (accidentally dropping the clip out of his gun and the chamber sliding off his weapon) you know you are buckled into an unfunny ride.  The fault does not lie at the feet of Mr. Rowan, who does a good job with the material.  He's like a modern Peter Sellars.  I wish he was the top choice for future Pink Panther movies instead of Steve Martin. Neither does the fault lie with the script.  Obviously, satirizing this genre has been done to death, but often it can still be funny. Call it old reliable. I'm placing the blame here on bad editing--that is, this film has no sense of comedic timing.  It should have been required that the editors of this movie watch the early Pink Pather films, Casino Royale, and the pre-90's Zucker-Zucker-Abrams movies.  Comedy like this is not genius, it is predictable.  It is the execution of the gag which is funny, and unfortunately, the editors of this film thought they were editing a romantic comedy. Austin Powers succeeded because it was a spoof that spoofed even it's own comedy genre, and because it had good direction and good editing.  They went into it thinking they had a unique spoof.  Johnny English fails because it is routine and it didn't even have the guts to go balls-out comedy because it was relying on the premise to carry the whole movie.  Because the editing was more appropriate for a John Hughes movie.  Because James Bond himself does a better job of satirizing the genre.  Save your rental money on this one.  Rent the first three Pink Panthers instead.  Or, just rent some non-Sean Connery James Bond flicks.  They are a better laugh.",1073779200,4,1904,4.599406528189911

I think the fans of Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean will not be disappointed. Although he plays a very different (and talking) character in this movie, I still spotted some classical ""Beanish"" behavior - like messing up and trying to cover it up rather then confess.

He is an actor and a darn good one as this movie very ably proves.  The movie is not over the top spoof like Austin Powers nor is it a serious spy movie like James Bond.  It's just a spy movie with a great plot, an evil bad guy, some pretty cool action scenes, some great comic moments, and a flawed hero.  The bad reviews and negative comments must be from people who were expecting an entirely different sort of movie.

1504736,3,B00005JM20,"Rowan Atkinson tries to start his own Hollywood franchise with this reasonably funny spoof of the Bond movies which coincidentally (methinks not) is written by Neil Purvis & Robert Wade who wrote the 007 movies THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH & DIE ANOTHER DAY (& who according to IMDB will write Bond 21- due for release 2005).
The World appears to be geared towards imminent disaster. French businessman, billionaire, supervillain & megalomaniac Pascal Savage (the always excellent John Malkovich) has stolen the supposedly heavily guarded Royal Crown Jewels from under English's nose (its not said if these include Bonny Prince Charlie's earrings)& is now setting in action his master plan of turning England into the Worlds largest prison: straight after he manages to get himself crowned King!
Assigned to save the free world from the clutches of this ""jumped-up Frenchman"" is British Intelligence Agent Johhny English (Rowan Atkinson). English has been selected not for his skill & ability, but because he & his partner Bough (Ben Miller) are all that remain after all the other agents are killed in a bomb blast. Thankfully his new partner is the smart & beautiful agent Lorna Campbell (Natalie Imbruglia-whose acting ability leaves much to be desired).
Predictibly the film is littered with plenty of slapstick gags (& a couple of mild gross outs- this is a PG movie after all)which Atkinson fans & kids will love.
The special highlight for me is the scene where English crashes a funeral & is saved from disaster by posing as an escaped mental patient! My only complaint is that Robbie Williams sings the title song ARRRGGGGHHH!! How people call him a ""rock star"" is appalling!

While many of the jokes are predictable and the humor not terribly sophisticated in the way that Blackadder or Monty Python often provide, Johnny English nevertheless made me laugh out loud more than once, largely due to the excellent delivery and timing of Rowan Atkinson. There is a lot of fun physical humor similar to what one might expect from Atkinson's Mr. Bean or Peter Sellers playing Inpsector Clouseau.
Of course, the slapstick silliness of it all means that many kids will enjoy this, especially if they've seen a few classic James Bond movies first and part of the fun of this movie can be watching it with your children just as sharing the original James Bond movies with them can be a fun shared experience for those of us who grew up watching Sean Connery as 007.

Apart from a painfully predictable plot, the supposed humor in this attempted spy movie spoof has a surreal, numbing quality -- the kind that you could watch to cure insomnia (or jetlag, as in my case.)
Not to mention a complete lack of layers. Johnny, hopeless at everything, manages some spectacular driving. Why not have something ACTUALLY spoofy, like him fighting with his shoelace and accidentally become a driving ace?
Instead we have to put up with the endlessly one-dimensional Johnny actively 'covering' himself, clueless but cunning ala Mr Bean (and NOT working.) We only get more and more redundant situations where Johnny has driven up the wrong path, again borrowing without success from the hapless Mr Bean.
And don't even get me started on the poor John Malkovich, whom I adore in general, but copiously sympathize with for his own situation of perpetual flummox in this film -- let's face it, he is no Dr. Evil.

1504809,3,B00005JM20,"First, let me say this is not a typical Hollywood comedy.  The origin of Johnny English, this spy spoof character, is a series of British TV commercials for credit card company televised in 1992.  The director is Peter Howitt (""Sliding Doors"") and the star is Rowan ""Mr. Bean/Blackadder"" Atkinson.  And the film companies are Universal, Working Title, and Canal Studio, the trinity of hit film makers like ""Bridget Jones.""  So, the basis of the film is for the audiences of UK, where ""Jonny English became the No. 1 hit three weeks in a row.
The story made by the writing team (Neil Purvis and Robert Wade) who wrote for the two real Bond films (""The Wolrd Is Not Enough"" ""Die Another Day"") is just what you expect from this now overcrowded genre of spy parody films.  You got a comic hero who takes himslef very seriously; the ""master mind"" or ""evil genius"" played by John Malkovich with phoney French accent, and a hapless sidekick who unwisely (and unaccountably) follows the main character.  Oh, and a beautiful lady whose identity should be somewhere between undercover agent and enemy in disguise.
Frankly, I did not laugh as much as I expected, but the some people around me are enjoying the film so much (and I saw it in Japan), so it is purely a matter of taste whether or not you like the film.  As far as the gags and gadgets are concerned, there are nothing unique or original, but as this is Atkinson's film, if you find his mugging face funny, you will have a good time all through the film.
As you expect from many British comedies, Rowan Atkinson's approach to his character is very low-key, and even serious.  Of course you are supposed to laugh when we see him confidently do stuffs like car chaces or gun-shooting, and as you always know, he blunders at the crutial moment.  Unlike Austin Powers, Atkinson plays Johnny English character quite straightforward even in incredibly stupid situations.  It sounds hilarious to some of us, to be sure, but as you know, the definition of comedy depends on your cultural background.  In that sense, this is very English.

You understand the plot: all of the MI7 agents have been killed at a funeral, and fourth-string Johnny English is called in to investigate the pilfering of the Crown Jewels.  Fairly simple, but you want to watch Atkinson work his magic.  Yes, this film atones for the miserable Mr. Bean Movie.
This film has something for everyone: action, subtle roman and sexual tension, and intelligent comedy.  In addition to the opening credits, there is one scene that captures the essence of the comedy.  Johnny English is in the office getting his badge, an filling out his secret agent paperwork, when he accidentally shoots the secretary with a dart pen.  A sub-normal comic would have left the joke end there, but Atkinson and Co. stretch eh humor out as English watches the paramedics come in and resuscitate the poor damsel.
As to nudity, there is one scene of an Archbishops bottom that goes on a little too long, and there is a scene where Johnny English climes up a sewer into a castles outhouse.  Other than these two scene, the is absolutely no vulgarity.  We can safely call this a Mormon alternative to Austin Powers.

3. Are aware of and like, the movies that Austin Powers makes

5. enjoy sight gags and a good ""straight man (or woman).""
6. are a Rowan Atkinson fan already.
A lot of things I have read about this movie seem to be stuck on Atkinson's Mr. Bean character.  That is not who we see in this movie.  For one thing, Johnny English speaks and he speaks quite a bit.  Pay attention to what he says too, very funny in context.  I think he is more ""Inspector Clousea"" than ""Mr. Bean"", an English Inspector Clousea with his own straight man as sidekick with some ""James Bond"" gadgets thrown in the mix.
I liked the movie and if you are in the mood to giggle, I recommend going to see this movie with someone who ""gets"" British humor, or go by yourself, it is great fun even alone.
By the way, don't forget to check out PBS for Mr. Bean reruns and (in my area at least) the brand new series of Mr. Bean cartoons!",1063584000,2,1098,4.107476635514018

The joke structure gets repeated again and again and again. The only other frequent joke is English's Bean-like behaviour when he thinks he's alone in his bathroom.
This movie is a yawn from start to finish, redeemed only by an original take on the requisite car chase: when English's high-speed sports car has been impounded by the clampers for illegal parking, he drives off in the truck carrying his car.
After making so many masterpieces for the small screen (namely 'Mr Bean', 'Blackadder' and 'Not the Nine o'Clock News'), it's so frustrating that he has yet to star in a great film. (His funniest movie performance so far is still the cameo vicar in 'Four Weddings'.) Maybe he should take a few risks by taking the Alec Guinness roles in a re-make of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets'.
The sad fact is that when you have fantastic talent and you get financial rewards to match, the urge to work diminishes and some of the inventive genius disappears. Atkinson does very few TV shows now because British TV is so poorly paid compared to movies -- hence the main reason why Bean is now a cartoon. (Financial reasons are also what keep writer Richard Curtis, Atkinson's buddy from Oxford, off our TV screens.)
Atkinson's on-screen personas have always kept women at a psychological distance. Most of the time, his characters were desperately afraid of women -- he found them incomprehensible. Yes, he may have bedded a couple in 'Blackadder', but you get the impression he was no more intimate or revealing of himself than he would have been in a pub conversation with a man. Here in 'Johnny English', we see the character genuinely open up to a woman, Natalie Imbruglia. The revelation is not a particularly attractive sight, but I know how the middle-aged male ego is keen to show its interest in women.
I have been following Atkinson's career since seeing him in the 'Inferiors' review in the late 1970s at Oxford. In comic terms, 'Johnny English' is the low point. If he is ever to shine again, he needs to re-think his approach. I don't think Hollywood is the answer for Rowan. I'm pretty sure that Richard Curtis is.",1061856000,7,2364,4.78239608801956
1504813,4,B00005JM20,"This is Rowan Atkinson's best leading role, not that this is saying very much.  However, Rowan Atkinson's character is a good-natured buffoon that tries his best, which is a separation from the more selfish character of Mr. Bean.  However, it's impossible to have a complete separation, and we see a lot of skits that Atkinson has already done multiple times in other venues.
Another weakness to this movie is that it is just another spy spoof, akin to the numerous Leslie Nielson movies we have all seen.  It is almost a believable plotline though, which would've made the movie a stronger satire, had not John Malkovich's role had not been so entirely unbelievable.  Needless to say, Malkovich took a weak character and made him worse, and his performance was enough to keep me from wanting to see this movie again.
But there are some very funny scenes that make this movie very fun.  There's a hilarious chase scene, along with a series of funny scenes at the headquarters of the secret organization involving Atkinson that left me out of breath.  Atkinson's brilliance along with strong support from the rest of the cast (minus Malkovich) make this movie a worthwhile trip, as long as you keep your expectations low.",1059955200,2,1220,4.841346153846154
1504814,4,B00005JM20,"Do not confuse this intelligent movie with the James Bond spoofs like Austin Powers. The subject matter seems similar but the comic genious of Mr. Atkinson demonstrates that a movie can be funny without using [physical]inuendo and [stuff]. If you followed the Blackadder series you already know that Atkinson's character acting is beyond Mr. Bean. Too bad that this movie has been advertised as ""Bean meets Bond for American audiences. Unfortunately he is stuck with that image of Bean. His wit and vocal characterizations are in the same class with the finest comic and dramatic actors. If you want to see a clean movie for the whole family this is for you. Even there is some harmless bath room humor. If you want to explore the intelligent comedy of Rowan Atkinson go beyond Mr. Bean and see his hilarous Blackadder series.

1504883,5,B00005JM20,I find the set of Rowam Atkinson's movies rather slapstick so this movie was a pleasant surprise.  Being from England myself I tend to prefer English humour but my friend who is American went with me and we both laughed all the way through the movie.

Good story good content one of the best movies I have seen all year. The whole spy thing needed a new face and Mike Myers isn't cutting it any more, at least not for me he isn't. Please get off your ass and go see this movie (or I will send a Frenchman to your house to insult you and generally stink up the place).

1504885,3,B00005JM20,"One of the funniest actors in the trade, Rowan Atkinson is responsible for many hilarious appearances as Mr. Bean.  But if your looking for another classic Bean performance, this is not the movie for you.  Atkinson is again funny as ever but the movie is redundant and puts Atkinson in situations that are to scripted and not the silliness that a hardcore Bean fan is used to.
  This is defiantly a very fun and hilarious movie that includes lots of humor and funny scenes and will delight young audiences.  The movie can get boring at times and even the youngsters will get bored with redundant and insignificant scenes.  But they will be satisfied.
  You follow Johnny English through his embarrassing adventures as he tries to be a master spy.  He never quite becomes a great agent, or even an adequate agent but does end up saving his country by being crowned King of England.  This should give you an idea of the seriousness of this movie.
  If you want a few cheap laughs, then this a classic.  But for the regular moviegoer, this is a funny movie but can be boring because of a complete lack any sort of plot.

See this movie if:
You are a big Bean Fan
You love movies just for Laughs

Do Not See this movie if:
You like comedies with a recognizable plot
You dislike kiddie humor",1059609600,,1304,4.447257383966245

1504887,3,B00005JM20,"Being a longtime fan of Blackadder and Mr. Bean, I would watch Rowan Atkinson in anything. ""Johnny English"" is a similar premise to Austin Powers, but not nearly as funny or raunchy. But it succeeds as a vehicle for Rowan Atkinson to give some good one-liners and a few unique facial expressions, so I pretty much got what I expected.
Johnny English (Atkinson) is a middle-level secret agent who is, by default, given the biggest assignment ever handed down...finding the stolen crown jewels, and to thrwart an evil French billionaore's (John Malkovich) plan to take over England. He is not exactly 007 material, though, and he goes through the entire movie bumbling around and making as many mistakes as he can in the 90 minutes the movie allows. His sidekicks (Ben Miller as his smarter partner, and Natalie Imbruglia as his sexy partner/love interest) spend the entire movie both showing him up and keeping him out of trouble.
The acting from Atkinson and, in particular, Malkovich is top notch, considering the type of movie this is. Atkinson plays a less-silly (but equally inept) Mr. Bean, while Malkovich hams it up as a Frenchman with a surprisingly convincing accent. Imruglia has never looked better, and provides the strong female lead needed. The script is surprisingly smart at times, and has a few snappy lines about the French (a popular target in British comedy) that will raise a few laughs. While it it not non-stop laughs, the funny moments are all good ones.
""Johnny English"" is just what you would expect- a watchable comedy that has no aspirations to compete with Austin Powers. Going into this movie with the highest of expectations would be a mistake, but if you are looking to lose yourself in a dumb comedy, you can do no better than ""Johnny English"".",1059264000,9,1777,4.848684210526316
1504888,5,B00005JM20,"This movie was hiliarious!  I came to the movie expecting the usual Rowan Atkinson boring schitck but instead was quite surprised at just how versatile this actor is!  I laughed so much that I only felt slightly embarrassed by it for all of 3 seconds after I realized people around me were laughing just as hard!
Excellent comedy to take in on a weeknight!",1059264000,,356,4.546875
1504889,4,B00005JM20,"In my review of Bruce Dessau's biography on Rowan Atkinson, I mentioned how the comedian alienated many Brits and critics with the overbaked-by-Hollywood Bean movie.  Well, he has triumphed with the James Bond spoof Johnny English.  If this movie isn't enough to convince his countrymen that he is going back to his roots, nothing will.  I, being an humble Anglophilic American, am convinced and cheer him on.
After all British special agents are assassinated, it's up to Johnny English, originally an ungainly desk jockey whose closest work in espionage involved handing agents their mission files.  This is a chance for him to fulfill his dream of being a suave agent, and he is chosen by Pegasus, the code name of the MI7 director, to protect the Crown Jewels at a party held by Pascal Sauvage, a Frenchman who has designed many prisons in Europe.  Well, guess what happens?  Oh, he meets and falls for Lorna Campbell, played by Natalie Imbruglia.  Their second meeting at a sushi shop is hilarious.
He is assisted in this by Bough, his harried co-worker.  Much of the gags involve gadgets misfiring under English's handling them.  Others involve English's bumbling at the expense of other people.  While tracking down the perpetrators in a sham hearse, he mistakenly follows a real hearse en route to the cemetery.  He terrorizes the mourners, even the widow.  Fortunately, by the time he realizes his mistake, Bough rescues him in time by making everyone think English is an escaped mental patient who was accidentally released early--""his release date is 2028.""  English catches on and not only feigns a mental case, he even utters indistinct guttural sounds that left me smiling.
Rowan Atkinson plays the title character in a more reserved manner.  There are none of the high impact facial aerobics that carried the Bean movie more than the story.  However, the funniest sequence involves Johnny English doing a funky dance and jamming to Abba's ""Does Your Mother Know.""  And a poopoo joke is actually quite funny.
John Malkovich has the most thankless role as Pascal Sauvage, affecting an exaggerated French accent and sporting bad hair and unappealing makeup.  Then again, this is Rowan's second starring vehicle, so what else can we say?
And pretty Natalie Imbruglia (Lorna) proves she's just as good an actress as she is a singer.  Then again, she starred in The Neighbors soap opera in her native Australia.  Her slender figure, pointed chin, and raven black hair really highlight her competent, unruffled performance.
Veteran British actors Tim Piggott-Smith (Pegasus) and Oliver Ford Davies (the Archbishop) appear, the latter having some really humiliating moments, including the tattoo gag lifted from The Naked Gun 2.5.
The laughs are in the vein of Black Adder, i.e. the best laid plans of mice and English, and Fawlty Towers-like misunderstandings and mishaps rather than the silent comedy of Mr. Bean.  There is an in-joke in the movie.  This movie is touted as a James Bond spoof, right?  Well, there is a Bond that appears in this film--four of them.  I'm of course referring to the female techno/classical string quartet Bond, who play their tune ""Kismet"" at Sauvage's soiree.
At one point in this movie, Johnny says resignedly, ""I'm a spent force.""  That's not the case with Rowan Atkinson, who comes up with a nice winner and showing that's he's a tried and true Englishman, to Queen and country, to the core.  Those who are turned off the juvenile mugging of Austin Powers and want something less loud, less gross, and more reserved, Johnny English is just the ticket.",1058832000,2,3594,4.989932885906041
1504890,3,B00005JM20,"I have often admired Rowan Atkinson in my living room. He has a riveting presence and is quite talented in the slapstick manner of a Charlie Chaplin. Unfortunately, the same magic is not evident when transferred onto the large theater screen. Atkinson does not suffice in the lead role of Johnny English. This James Bond spoof fails every time John Malkovich is not included in a scene. The latter actor portraying the laughably sinister French businessman, Pascal Sauvage, who wants to become King of England is hysterical and provides the right type of balance for this role. Natalie Imbruglia does a serviceable job as Lorna Campbell, the love interest of our not too bright secret agent.
The scatological jokes were over the top and I personally could have done without these yucky attempts at humor. Also, Johnny English is far too slow paced and is about eight minutes too long. I can only give this film three stars. You might wish to wait until it is released in dvd format.",1058745600,,982,4.7823529411764705
1504891,4,B00005JM20,"First of all, this film is great! I'm sick to death of people comparing it unfavorably to Austin Powers. It's an apples to oranges comparison, sort of like comparing the Three Stooges to Monty Python. The Three Stooges are funny, but they never could have given us the Dead Parrot Sketch or the Spanish Inquisition, nor should they have.
Similarly, Johnny English is not Austin Powers and is not meant to be Austin Powers.
Austin Powers is an example of a broader American style of humor directed at the whole English spy genre.
Johnny English is an example of English wit with the same subject, but the approach is completely different.
English wit is subtle, with the exception of Benny Hill, and Johnny English is a brilliant example of it.
The only reason I'm not giving this film 5 stars is a poorly done scene involving a funeral that goes on way too long and violates a couple of the character relationship rules that had been established earlier in the film.
Aside from an occasional weak scene, if you loved Black Adder you'll love this film.",1058745600,,1051,4.655913978494624
