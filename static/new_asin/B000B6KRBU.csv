8324967,5,B000B6KRBU,Very high quality set. I recommend watching the extras to see just how cheesey 90s Japan comedy was.,1465862400,,100,4.611111111111111
8324968,4,B000B6KRBU,"This is a 3-volume OVA derived from the original Captain Tylor TV series. It cant really be called a single OVA series since its actually comprised of 2 independent story arcs with widely different tone, and surprisingly, different visual style and feel. While the first arc, starting at volume 1 with An Exceptional Episode follows the comedic styling of the TV series, volumes 2 and 3 are the core of the OVA series and are a departure from the original comedic tone, into a dramatic war saga with zero humor and absolute lack of comedy. Not only that, but the visual style changes dramatically, making you wonder if you are still watching Captain Tylor or another anime.
Despite the attempt at comedy on the first volume, it simply fails in comparison to the original TV series. This isn't just a departure in the sense of comedy and feel, but even the characterization is radically different from what we are used to. While on the original TV series Tylor goes from a fool and incompetent commander, yet with some wit and a bit of luck wins the loyalty of his crew, this time around the crew does a 180-degree shift in personality for no apparent reason, it makes the whole thing feel like we are back at square one. Most disappointingly is that while the show has 2 arcs in 3 volumes, the final episodes provide no resolution, little explanation, and end the Tylor series with a whimper rather than a bang. Overall, a notch below the original, but its still a decent anime.
On the technical side, this boxset is the way boxsets should be made. No fluff, no overly huge packing, just a small, tight, good looking box with the DVDs, the CD soundtrack, a 32 page booklet with an extra story from the original creator, beautiful 64 booklet with artwork, trivia and extras.
Definitely a great looking set, worth it for the anime/Tylor collector.
Overall 4.5 stars for the boxset, 3.5 stars for the content. But thats not the manufactures fault.",1440115200,,1944,4.670553935860059
