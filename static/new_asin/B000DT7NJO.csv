8102590,4,B000DT7NJO,"A sweet and human film that is perhaps just a little too slow and distanced for it's own good.

The strengths of this French film set in post-communist Russia include quiet but powerful
observance of detail, and understated, very real and perceptive performances.

But somehow, I was never as drawn in or moved as I expected to be, based on the amazing
reviews this received.  And maybe that was the problem.  There's nothing like review
over-hype to set you up for a let down with a small, quiet, intimate solid film.  So I will
give this another look, and report back if my feelings evolve.",1342742400,,592,4.6
8102591,4,B000DT7NJO,"A modern Georgia's story of fragile strong old mother going to France for visiting her son-economic migrant just to accept a grim tragedy of his passing away.

Depicting exotic for the Westerners Georgian mentality issues, it would be much better comprehended if money for a trip undertaken by mother, daughter and grand-daughter was not made from selling rare books bought during communist epoch, and having grand-daughter returning to native land rather than refusing to.

Clich damages impressions of this half-sci-fi story.",1218153600,,527,5.493827160493828
8102592,4,B000DT7NJO,"Despite that this is a French production, majority of the movie is set in Georgia (Russia) of a Georgian family that speaks French.  Otar is the GP son who decides to go to France to earn more hard currency.  Once in a while, he shall call his mother in Georgia and from the mother's body language, we know that she's the mother's boy.  The mother stays with her daughter and grand daughter.  The movie is made without much fuss and it gleams through effortlessly.  Then, tragedy strikes and Otar is dead.  To spare the feeling of the old woman, the daughter (coercing her own daughter to play along), they concoct an excuse that due to work reasons Otar couldn't call back anymore.  Instead, ""he"" resorts to writing lengthy letters.  The twist comes back towards the third quarter of the movie when the old lady surprises everyone else by booking all of them air tickets to visit Otar in France.  The ending is handled with much sensitivity.  Here, amid the strife that family is going through day in and day out, one thing remains, blood is thicker than water.  We would do irrational things at times for the love of our loved ones unconditionally.  As revealed in the movie, it is akin to a metaphor of the ex-Russia where people live through the lies and the question raised is that what happens when the lies are revealed and how are people are going to live through the truths?  Would that make their lives better or worse?  A remarkable film made by a first time Director.  Highly recommended.  Forgettable extras.",1143676800,,1521,4.619402985074627
