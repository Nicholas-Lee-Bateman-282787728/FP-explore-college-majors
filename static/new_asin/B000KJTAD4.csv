8459403,2,B000KJTAD4,"I guess this DVD would be okay if you just bought your first digital camera or didn't understand the basics of photography, but it sure doesn't help at all with the advanced features of this camera.

Throughout this DVD the instructor refers to ""Part Two"" where all the advanced features will be explained.  Trouble is there is no ""Part Two"".  I emailed the company twice trying to determine when ""Part Two"" would be available but they never responded.  Great cutomer service, huh?

I'm sorry I bought it.  $25 down the drain.",1176076800,7,526,4.725274725274725
