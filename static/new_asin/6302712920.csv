498172,5,6302712920,"This movie has a sort of Grease feeling to it.  Early 60s, big hair, and great classic rock music!  Ricki Lake is just 'the bomb' in this movie.  She really showed the overweight people that being that way doesn't change  who you are.  Also, Debbie Harry was just awesome!  She is funny and I  really love her in Blondie.  The rest of the cast is great and if you get  the chance, see this movie.  It also deals with integration and segregation  and the 'bad guys' really get it in the end.  It is a good story and gives  a good message.  LET'S DANCE!",943920000,,551,4.173076923076923

498288,5,6302712920,"One of my top 50 movies. I suppose the material is good enough to withstand updating for a new generation, but I prefer this original due to the cast, in particular the wonderful Divine. This movie would have launched him on the sort of mainstream career and success he always craved and richly deserved. Alas, God had other plans...

This is such a fiercely brave elegant movie that it should be compulsory viewing for all high school students - it covers so many issues. But above all it's life lessons with tremendous fun.

The dance routines are neat and well done. There's even room for New York post expressionist painting amidst the hair hoppers, extra large dress sizes, The Corny Collins Show, scenes from the negro ghetto and Motormouth Maybelle's 45rpm record shop.

This DVD deserves to be in everybody's collection - the picture and sound quality is fantastic even on an 60"" LG OLED TV - but not on my shelf. It's too good!

It also explained integration in the 60's, something we are still dealing with, in a way that did not horrify my boys, but led the older ones to want to learn more about the changes we have made and the changes we need to make. This is a far more important film than one viewing would lead you to believe. It brings up the horror of segregation, in a way that makes you think, young white kids dancing on a show with one day a month for the people who made the music they danced to. It's a classic and the dances are all real and well done. A snapshot of time when we grew as a country, but were still a long way from grown.",1470355200,8,712,4.02112676056338

498930,4,6302712920,"Sunny 1988 comedy directed by John Waters has enough of his edginess to keep it diverting and enough of a message that you're happy the younger generation has taken it to heart.  It's 1962 and chubby teen Tracy Turnblad (Rikki Lake) has one desire -- to dance on the ""Corny Collins Show,"" Baltimore's version of ""American Bandstand.""  Tracy crosses paths with the upwardly striving von Tussle family, and at the same time her consciousness is raised when her teased-up hair gets her sent to Special Ed., where she meets several African-American students demoted there for similarly irrelevant reasons.  Tracy discovers that the black kids aren't allowed on the Corny Collins Show except on the rare and specified ""Negro Day.""  And the plot thickens.

This movie is a delight.  Waters crams it with period detail (one of the kids on line for the Corny Collins Show is reading a paperback of BLACK LIKE ME) without sacrificing his usual shock value -- this is Divine's last film role, as Tracy's agoraphobic mother Edna Turnblad.  Edna's husband is played by Jerry Stiller, who is worried about Tracy's growing activism.  Edna soothes him by saying -- utterly deadpan -- ""After all, dear, the times are a'changing.""  With self-aware nuggets like that, and a supporting cast that includes Debbie Harry and the late Sonny Bono, it's no surprise it went on to spawn a Broadway musical, a film of the musical, and a revival.  In fact, my only gripe about this original HAIRSPRAY is that it may be a little too busy -- but it is always fun.  Recommended.",1415232000,4,1547,4.821969696969697

This I believe, is the only movie in which he did not play the lead character, but instead Ricki Lake did.  And, as I understand it, he was not happy about being second, and it actually irritated him, but during filming he grew very fond of Ricki Lake and even asked her to share a pie with him.  It showed his wonderful ability for character acting and I loved watching him! Lots of great music and dancing and the story, set back in the early 1960's was silly, which is just the way I like it!

499068,4,6302712920,"Arguably the high point of John Waters' career, HAIRSPRAY is a fun, energetic and infectious movie with a top-notch soundtrack and earnest performances from everyone involved. The story centers around Tracy Turnblad (Ricki Lake), a ""pleasantly plump"" teenager who spends her afternoons watching the Corny Collins Show, where teenagers dance the most popular dances to the latest tunes. She manages to get on the show, and from there hopes to bring integration to Baltimore, Maryland (this takes place in 1962). While still maintaining some of the weirdness which made John Waters (in)famous, this film rises above campiness because of the social ideas it embraces, e.g., racial equality. There's also hints of commentary on fame and child stars, akin to themes explored in more explicit ways in his previous films, but the focus here is on bringing people together. And what better way than through music and dancing? Just about everything in the movie works, from the retro fashion which has been lovingly recreated/exaggerated to the choreography and music. It's so catchy that you just want to get up and dance yourself. Still, the movie isn't without its negatives. The narrative is a bit thin, and the conflict is resolved a little too easily, but this can be mostly forgiven because of the strength of everything else around it.

499114,5,6302712920,"I've been a big fan of the original Hairspray for many years.  While it is one of John Waters' more tame films, the odd characters are still there, and you really root for the underdog.  Waters is definitely an acquired taste, however this film should appeal to a wider audience than some of his earlier work.  When I bought this Blu-ray, I wasn't expecting much since the case did not list many extras.  Boy was I surprised!!!!  First of all, the video is very crisp and clean.  The colors just pop off the screen like never before.  The sound has also gotten a boost since the previous DVD release.  When I bought this, I was thinking that I was just getting a hi-def version of the film with a couple of extras like the DVD.  I was quite surprised when I popped my disc into the player and discovered there are quite a few good extras on this that are not listed on the package.  Having the film in a good hi-def version was justification for purchase, but with all of the extras, this is really a no brainer purchase.  All of the extras do a good job and showing how those involved truly loved the work they produced in this film.  The audio interviews with Divine are........OK I'll say it DIVINE.  They just leave you wanting to hear more from him.  If you're a fan of this Waters' classic, you owe it to yourself to pick up a copy of Hairspray in high definition.

499115,5,6302712920,"I viewed my Blu-Ray copy of the movie and throughly enjoyed it. This product is a good transfer of the cult favorite. The only negative thing was some of the special features, interviews with people, I didn't like. Not for appearence, but they were too odd for me. I did like the original featurette that was included. I like this movie better than the film starring, John Travolta as Edna Turnblad and Michelle Pfiffer. I would have much perferred, Harvey Firestein, recreating his performance from the original Broadway cast. The other thing I do not like about the musical version is changing the character of Velma Von Tussel into a career woman. It was much funnier with Divine as Edna and the station owner. The budget might have been the reason for this. The soundtrack might be viewed by some as inferior, but John Waters explained this in the featurette. Between this version and the musical, I would choose this version, which was truer to the period.",1394323200,2,961,4.7604790419161676

The film hilariously spoofs the social issue of integration during the 50's merging into the 60's.  The story is centered around ""The Corny Collins"" dance show, a take off on ""American Bandstand"", so yes a lot of music and dancing here!

I would say this is definitely his cleanest film, and in turn his most family friendly. I'm not going to give you a synopsis, since you can just read the description, just know that this is a funny movie filled with great music and dancing, and a great performance from Divine (her final one, in fact). You really can't go wrong.

499168,4,6302712920,"Hairspray is a 1988 comedy film written, directed, and produced by John Waters. It stars Ricki Lake, Shawn Thompson, Debbie Harry, Divine, Sonny Bono, Michael St. Gerard, Colleen Fitzpatrick, Leslie Ann Powers, Jerry Stiller, and Ruth Brown. Hairspray was Waters' first film to be aimed at a wider audience and to have a serious subject matter. It was also the first film of his to be given a PG rating.

Hairspray centers on ""pleasantly plump"" teenager Tracy Turnblad (Ricki Lake) as she pursues stardom as a dancer on a local TV dance show, called The Corny Collins Show (Shawn Thompson). Several other conflicts surround her: her mother, Edna (Divine) does not want her to get hurt because of her size; she rivals Amber Von Tussle (Colleen Fitzpatrick) for being Miss Auto Show 1963; she falls in love with Link Larkin (Michael St. Gerard), Amber's beau; she tries to break the stereotype of African-Americans (Ruth Brown, Clayton Prince, etc), and takes her friend, Penny (Leslie Ann Powers) with her all the way.

Hairspray was described as being ""way beyond Grease"" in its 1988 theatrical trailer. It's not, though. Hairspray is far more serious than previous Waters' films, but still obtains a campy overtone. At the time of its release, the film earned favorable reviews and made $8.3 million at the box office on a $2 million budget.

This is a respectable movie, a movie that deserves a second look. It is not a classic, but more of a cult classic instead. It could be something to go down in the record books. Somebody had to like it, subsequent Broadway adaptations broke box office records, and a 2007 remake is one of the top 10 movie musicals of all time. It is, too, something people may find more unrealistic rather than breaking standards. It's a good film, by no means a great one, but one that will stand the test of time. Check it out, you shouldn't be disappointed.",1376956800,,1887,4.764525993883792

HAIRSPRAY was considerably more accessible than previous Waters films, a campy romp on several still-controversial themes set in the early 1960s.  Very loosely based on diverse but factual incidents, the film concerns overweight teen Tracy Turnblad (Ricki Lake), who desperate who is desperate to win a spot on the local afternoon teen dance show.  But when Tracy breaks through, she incurs the wrath of Amber Von Tussel (Colleen Fitzpatrick), the show's reigning beauty and the daughter of racist parents who oppose intergration.  Tracy quickly becomes frustrated with segregation, which keeps several of her friends off the show and out of the local amusement park, and before you can say ""the times, they are a-changing"" she and her friends precipitate a race riot.

There are a lot of things that make the movie click, and not the least of them is the cast.  Ricki Lake and Collen Fitzpatrick are beautifully cast, and the film is crammed full of notables, many of them considered cult stars in their own right, including Mink Stole, Pia Zadora, Ric Ocasek (former front man of The Cars), Jerry Stiller, Debbie Harry, Sonny Bono, and Ruth Brown.  But the queen of the cast is, of course, Divine, aka Glenn Milstead, one of the era's most notorious drag queens and a performer who completely defined bad taste as an art form.  It's hard to beat Divine, whether in the role of Tracy's outrageously obese mother Edna or the small part of Arvin Hodgepile, racist amusement park owner, and sad to say HAIRSPRAY would be among the last of Divine's films before his death in 1988.  But the cast isn't the only thing here: the story itself, which includes the cruelty of cliques, checkerboard chicks, Alan Ginsberg's poetry, and wickedly funny dialogue (""Tracy Turnblad, once again your ratted hair is preventing another student's geometry education"") is a knockout.  If you can sit through HAIRSPRAY without laughing hard then there's something wrong with you.

At the time a good many of Waters' fans were unenthusiastic about the film, which they described as a sell-out.  It was not as extreme as PINK FLAMINGOS--but then few things are, and perhaps that moment in Waters life had passed.  Although HAIRSPRAY was not a major box office success when first released, it quickly became a cult classic on VHS and DVD, and it remains my own favorite of his works.  Earlier films might make you cringe, and later films might be too glossy, but the 1988 HAIRSPRAY is in the Goldilocks Zone: Just Right.  And I might add, never mind the later stage musical and it's own film adaptation, for they truly pull the teeth of the original.  Strongly recommended.

499470,2,6302712920,"Okay, it wasn't all dull, but most of it was.  Some of the storyline was good, especially the part with the character played by Ricki Lake being being seen for her dancing talent, but overall it fell flat.  There was a lack of tension in the story, and somehow the characters, many of whom just came across as caricatures, lacked enough depth for me to care about them one way or another.  Also, I hoped this would be a better John Waters film than his others, but instead I found there was too much stupid comic stuff in there, which detracted from what could otherwise have been a better movie.  This said, I still like Divine, in both of his roles.  I actually watched the film to see him in action, and he produced.  To me he made the film.  (I saw the John Travolta version and Travolta doesn't hold a candle to Divine.)

One other thing I realized while watching this, and it is just an interpretation so take it or leave it:  I felt the whole racial tension and integration versus segregation theme throughout the movie was really not about race at all, but instead a disguised plea for acceptance of alternate sexual orientations.  Marginalized black people (and I think marginalized fat people) really represented gay people, which I felt John Waters couldn't, because of anti-gay prejudice (this was filmed in the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s), say directly.  I sensed this about halfway through the film, and I became convinced of it the more I watched.

Also, as an aside, I felt a lot of the sexuality stuff from the film was vulgar -- and unnecessary.  To me this also detracted from the film.

I've also read that John Waters originally wanted to cast Divine in the role of Tracy Turnblad, but couldn't because he wouldn't have garnered a PG-13 rating with his leading lady, a 40-year-old man in drag, getting sexual in dark alleys with male actors representing 16-year-old boys.  (Incidentally, from what I just read of Divine's biography by Bernard Jay, that was exactly what Divine was into in real life.)

So instead he gave the part to Ricki Lake, age 19.  Good call.",1299196800,,2099,4.599462365591398

You know you are watching a Waters film when you see Tracy (Lake) kissing with her boyfrind Link (Michael St Gerard) in an alley saying how romantic it is while she shakes a rat off her shoe.

The film was very corny, but that was the idea. In fact, one of the characters is named ""Corny Collins.""  What a great name! It was pretty charming film, too, with the put-ons about the old American Bandstand-type dance shows that were television for years. ""Hairspray"" features some good 1960s music, too, and some of the dances in here are hilarious.

The first half of this movie is about local teens of that period and the dance and petty jealousies in the group while the second half theme is all about racism. It's almost like two movies-in-one.

The film takes place in Baltimore, and whether racism in that city was a bad as filmmaker John Waters portrays it here, I don't know, but I wouldn't be happy if I lived in that city and saw this movie. They don't come off looking too good!",1235001600,,859,4.52258064516129

499666,4,6302712920,"Make no mistake.  This is not the current theatrical release. This version came out in 1988 while Sonny Bono still lived.  And Divine was DIVINE as Tracy Turnblad's (Ricki Lake's) Mom.  Do I like it better than the current release?  I'll let you know when I see the new one.  I like this version just fine.

Special kudos go to Divine as Ma Turnblad. I laughed every time I saw her on the scene. Deborah Harry as Velma Von Tussle was absolutely fabulous.  I laughed so hard my sides ached.

But beneath that sixties glitz there was a deeper issue--segregation.  ""Hairspray"" hammered the message home pretty hard, but they were right.

This film takes me back to the day.  I wonder if every major market had a teen show back in the Sixties.  In Oklahoma City, it was ""The Scene"" with Ronnie Kay.  The kids were clean-cut, well-dressed, and the 'clean teen' image.  I wondered why ""Scene"" didn't play the Motown that I enjoyed on the radio.

I got my answer from network TV. ""American Bandstand"" and ""Soul Train.""  ""Soul Train"" got the spot nobody else seemed to want.  As soon as I discovered it, I watched both shows--so I could hear a bit of both kinds of music I liked.

I'd like to think we've come a lot further than that now.  Soul, R&B, rap, and hip hop have crossed the boundaries and I'm grateful to see it.",1195257600,3,1315,4.426778242677824

Tracy was horribly likable. As in I liked her character in spite of myself. John Water films are always interesting; this was no exception.

I was a little confused about why the hair was changed towards the end after meeting the girl who scared them. But, eh, I'll watch it again to see if I can figure it out.

The humor was well put and the ""BAD GUY"" characters were nice and irredeemably bad and laughable. Who doesn't like laughing at mean people who try to be scary when they're really just sad?

Then I was curious about the original 1988 Hairspray.  My daughter was crazy about it back then but I never saw it.  It has Ricki Lake as the plump girl trying to get to be a regular on the Corny Collins Show, an after school teenage dance program.  Ricki Lake makes a cameo appearance in the 2007 version but has no spoken words; she's just observing a dance competition from the audience.  Jerry Stiller is in both movies, playing the part of Mr. Pinky in the 2007 version.  It is so much fun to compare the two movies, both the 1988 and the 2007.  They are both based on the same subjects, integration on The Corny Collins Show.  The character names are the same but played by different people.  Both versions have terrific sound tracks, but different.  I never would have bought Hairspray 1988 if it hadn't been for the re-make.  The 1988 movie is WONDERFUL and so is the 2007 version.

499716,3,6302712920,"After seeing the 2007 adaptation of the musical, I wanted to see this version to compare it. I had seen it before but it had been a while. I don't think it'd be fair to compare it to the 2007 film considering if this film wasn't around, we wouldn't have the broadway version or the new version on screens now. That being said, I always see this film in the ""musical"" section at stores. It's not really a musical at all; it's like those movies with a good soundtrack that at times eclipses the actual film and acting; the music plays a large role in the film but the actors aren't performing the songs. This is more about dancing, segregation, race and for that, it's an entertaining film.

I think the weakest part of the film is the writing. So much is packed into the plot that it seems to skip around and you're not left with a really good or concrete understanding of why things are the way they are. You don't truly believe Tracy and Link are in love; they seem thrown together for effect without any explanation. Amber in the film automatically dislikes Tracy, again, with some reason but not to the level portrayed in the film. A lot of the dynamics and relationships are fully explored in the film; you don't get or see the mother/daughter bond between Tracy and Edna here and there are parts where it's just silence, where you're waiting for something to happen or it feels as if a joke's gone bad.

Now, for the good, the dancing is great. I found the best dance scenes to be toward the end with Amber doing 'The Roach' and Tracy's response, 'The Bug."" It's a very light film, meant to be fun and not taken seriously. Divine is humorous, doesn't try to 'be a woman' as John Travolta tries to be in the latest adaptation. Once you realize Divine is in drag, the jokes over pretty much and Edna fades into the background. Jerry Stiller plays Tracy's dad, but again, he's funny and after a while even his character gets lost.

DVD wise, this version of the film is begging for another release. Perhaps a special edition with commentary, extended scenes, deleted scenes, SOMETHING because all you get here is the trailer. After seeing the 2007 version, this seems a bit lacking in many areas, flat and simply boring. Yet, I believe it's still watchable and entertaining in its own way when you seperate it from the different versions it spawned. Check it out at your own risk. It'll at least get you up and dancing.",1188172800,3,2421,4.472850678733032

499721,3,6302712920,"Previous to owning this movie, I'd only seen two John Waters movies, and they were Cry Baby and Pecker (the latter I always forget about for some reason). I picked this up recently when the remake came out at the cinema - which no one will go and see with me, but then I'm an early twenty something who wants to go and see the Bratz movie as well! - just to see what it was like, and I loved it.

Much like Cry Baby, it's simplistic, cheap, cheerful, and full of laughs. Viewers will spot a couple of familiar faces from Cry Baby, the major one being Ricki Lake herself, who is now a chat show host in the US. Big hair was beautiful back then and oh boy, did everyone in this movie have big hair!

But this is a film not just about hair and music, it also has an underlying racism theme, and then of course, there's Divine. Words cannot describe Divine, and I doubt John Travolta playing the same role in the new movie is going to even come close to being as good as Divine. Something I never thought I'd say. Divine plays two roles in this - the role of Tracey Turnblad's mother, and also, the male version of himself, which is very strange to see. (He was also John Waters 'muse'.) He actually died not long after this was released, which I didn't realise until I read it, and it's such a shame.

Ricki Lake is brilliant in the starring role as pleasantly plump Tracey, a girl who loves to dance, and is determined to steal the hunk of the show from the skinny girl. This is ultimately what the film is about, with some hilarious 'cameos' from Sonny Bono and Debbie Harry as the skinny girl's OTT parents, and spot the Cry Baby person!

I'll probably be waiting until the DVD of the remake of Hairspray comes out, I have my doubts, as it won't have such an eclectic cast (two stars of High School Musical anyone?) but it should be worth seeing, as long as it doesn't outdo the original.",1186790400,2,1888,4.236111111111111

499757,5,6302712920,"Hairspray is one of John Waters' more mainstream movies in that it deals with the themes of racial tensions leading up to an integrated Baltimore, teen angst and first true loves, and those incredible dances and dance shows on TV from the late 1950s into the 1960s. Of course, with Hairspray being a John Waters movie, characters become grossly exaggerated for a humorous effect; you get a very funny, playful and harmless cast of both young and older people in Baltimore facing changing times as they try to live their lives as best they can.

Tracy Turnblad (Ricki Lake) is an overweight teenage girl who can shake off jokes about her weight with a type of self-confidence that is truly remarkable. Tracy and her friend Penny Pingleton (Joann Havrilla) enjoy watching and dancing along to The Corny Collins TV Show in Tracy's living room at home; and one day Tracy sets her mind to trying out for the show with some support from her friend Penny. When Tracy does try out on the Corny Collins TV dance show for dancing teenagers, she wins a spot on the council almost immediately! This upsets the stuck up, racist reigning queen Amber von Tussle and her parents (Sonny Bono and Debbie Harry) who make their living running Tilted Acres, a segregated theme park in Baltimore. As Tracy's star rises she also charms the heart of Amber's boyfriend, Link Larkin (Michael St. Gerard). Of course, this means war. Amber and her parents must--I mean, must--find a way to disgrace Tracy so that Amber can remain the star of the show and ultimately win the highly coveted 1963 Miss Auto Show award. Of course, as this all happens, Hairspray pokes fun at the obsession some people had with getting their hair to be as high and as perfect looking as they thought it could or should be.

The movie moves along at an even pace and the action keeps your attention. Look for John Waters himself as the psychiatrist hired by Penny's parents when they find out she has a black boyfriend named Seaweed. Divine turns in quite a performance as both Tracy Turnblad's mother and Arvin Hodgepile, the TV studio owner who could can The Corny Collins Show if it becomes integrated against his will. As if that weren't enough, Ruth Brown plays the role of Motormouth Maybelle, a female record store owner who is a prominent integrationist in Baltimore and who also sometimes judges on The Corny Collins Show.

Overall, the acting exceeds my expectations for a John Waters flick; and the choreography shines in great scenes where large crowds must move about. I won't give away the plot; but if you want to see excellent choreography look not at just the complicated dance scenes they had to manage but also the race riot scene near the Tilted Acres segregated amusement park.

The cinematography works well; and each character is developed nicely as the movie goes along. The casting is flawless, too.

Hairspray earns its keep quite well; it will hold your undivided attention as you howl with laughter all the way through! The DVD also features commentary by John Waters and Ricki Lake.

When it comes down to it, Hairspray manages to do be funny, hold your attention and explore rather serious issues concerning racial tensions, segregation, integration and the first true love each teen inevitably experiences--all at the same time and all in the same movie. That's quite a feat; and I recommend this film for fans of John Waters movies but also for people who enjoy comedies that involve social commentary. Great!",1181692800,18,3490,4.789036544850498

but if a tourist will just spend a few pennies on this dvd, they will get a much more exciting ride.  first off, the viewer can hear wonderful classic tunes by the ikettes, peggy march, lesley gore and so many others!  second off, the viewer will see divine pass his/her crown to ricki lake and her performance as tracy is a star-making turn! not to mention divine offers stellar support as feisty mrs. turnblad.  thirdly, there is a great ensemble of john waters regulars and new faces in support of our two wonderful stars!  fourth, baltimore is a bright, sunny place as captured through the lens of waters' sharp memories.  and the memories make the fingers pop as the choreography takes us through one dance craze after another--but they also make the head snap as we have to look at the issues of racial inequity, class structure and body types and we really have to ask ourselves--who is meant to dance, why and where?

499804,5,6302712920,"A lot of people don't know that this film was based on a true story. In 1962 Baltimore, The Buddy Deane Show was Baltimore's answer to Dick Clark, but unlike Clark's show, the Deane show was segregated, and attempts were made to integrate the show.

Director John Waters was a teeanger in Baltimore at the time, and the film is an amusing but loving tribute to the local culture of early 1960s Baltimore (Deane himself appears as a reporter trying to interview the Governor). A pre-talkshow Rikki Lake is the heroine who leads the effort to integrate the show. She was quite heavy at the time and infects the movie with her uplifitng spirit, representing for the ""women of size"" in the same way Queen Latifah would a few years later.

Lots of good scenes. The black nightclub scene, unlike similar scenes in other popular comedies, succeeds in capturing the atmosphere rather than mocking it with stereotypes. The dance segments are also quite interesting. Based on surviving films of the original Deane show (called the ""Corny Collins Show"" in this treatment), the kids do a dance called ""The Madison Time"" that is clearly the older brother of the Electric Slide of recent times. A comical dance called ""The Roach"" also stops the show (my older cousins told me about this song and dance and for years I thought they were making this up).

The soundtrack also strives for 1962 Baltimore accuracy, filled with regional R&B hits popular in Baltimore at the time (such as the classic and infectious ""Hide and Go Seek"" by Bunker Hill) as opposed to the usual Stax and Motown tunes often used to represent the era.

Get ready to slap your knees in hysterical laughter when one girl's hysterical mother seeks to ""rescue"" her daughter from a visit to the Baltimore ghetto, especially when she tells R&B legend Ruth Brown (RIP), ""Don't put any of your voodoo on me you-you-NATIVE WOMAN!""

The DVD also has one of the most informative commentaries around (with Waters and Rikki Lake some 15 years later). Really helps clear up a few things for those unfamiliar with the actual events that inspired this dance and laugh fest.

Yeah, the civil rights movement wasn't this entertaining, but it does give some insight into the mores of the era, as well as making you howl in laughter and shake a tail feather.",1165363200,7,2296,4.741854636591479

499807,5,6302712920,"I first heard of Hairspray a few years ago when Harvey Fierstein was winning acclaim playing the transvestite role on Broadway. I heard of it once again, when I read that John Travolta would be playing that same role in a theatrical version of the film. Around this same time I saw a movie called ""Pink Flamingos"" which led me to discovering John Waters, which led me to finding this film. ""Hairspray"" is not Waters' best (in my opinion), but it's definitely a special and funny film that is a far cry from other efforts by Waters. First off, it's his first and only film to have a rating under 'R' (In fact, it's rated PG) and while it still contains a few vulgarities; It's actually a pretty tame movie. The film takes place in the 60's, where hair (and hairspray) was the rage. Equally popular is The Corny Collins Show, a TV dance party that all the kids just eat up. One in particular though, dreams of being on the show and becoming famous. This is Tracy Turnblad (Ricki Lake, 'Serial Mom')...

A plump girl, with loads of talent who suddenly becomes the biggest star of the show. With the help of her agent/mother Edna Turnblad (Divine, in his last role) she becomes a celebrity in the eyes of all around her, except for the jealous Amber Von Tussle (Colleen Fitzpatrick) and her jealous parents (music icons Sonny Bono and Deborah Harry). Jerry Stiller also co-stars as Tracy's father. The movie has some great set pieces, makeup, and costume design. Although, someone should have pointed out Divine's frequent 5 o'clock shadow. Instead of using vulgar sights and sounds to humor the audience, Waters' instead went for charm and some physical humor. Although one of the funniest lines is when Divine says to Stiller ""The times they're a-changin'. Everything's just blowin' in the wind."" Which, for all those people who have no knowledge of pop culture, is a reference to Bob Dylan songs. All the actors eat up the scenery, Ricki Lake captures the naivitie and perkiness of Tracy perfectly...Divine, who I've never been a huge fan of, is hilarious playing dual roles (including one as a man). Jerry Stiller is also fantastic. The movie also, surprisingly, has a lot to say about racial segregation...Although it doesn't take itself too seriously. You don't need to be a fan of John Waters to enjoy this movie.

499810,5,6302712920,"""Hairspray"" captures early '60s life in Baltimore as Tracy (Ricki Lake) a young and chunky fan of a local dance TV show makes her way to become the star of it. Though she is poked fun at, nothing stops her including winning the heart of another dance regular on the show. The action of the story is centered around her as she also tries to have the dancing show entirely integrated. This movie is a very cheeky one that also adresses some very important social issues like civil rights. Tracy and her friends discard the snobbish attitudes towards minorities and strive for integration for everyone. It's a very cool flick filled with great early '60s rock'n'roll and R&B classics. There is a soundtrack, but sadly not all of the 30-some songs heard in this movie are there. It'd be nice to have all the songs though like ""American Graffiti."" There is an all-star cast including Sonny Bono, who stars as the father of Tracy's rival on the dance floor, rhythm & blues legend Ruth Brown as the town dee-jay, Motormouth Maybelle, and  Divine as Tracy's Mother. All you MPT viewers from Baltimore, look for Rhea Feiken in a cameo role as Tracy's geometry teacher. It's also interesting that once the parents each get a good look at what their kids are into, they become hip like them. You've got to see this movie to know what I mean.

499826,5,6302712920,"John Waters is renowned as the king of shlock, bad taste, gender-bending, and outrageousness - pretty much covering the waterfront of any subject society declares off limits.  In a business of greed-driven copycats lacking nerve or creativity, Waters is that rarest bird of all, an original.  While Hairspray has rude moments, it is his most approachable and appealing film.  Waters manages the impossible trick, he is disrespectful without being mean, tasteless without being vulgar, and over-the-top without being pointlessly crazy.

Consider the Hairspray cast.  Who else but John Waters could have assembled Ricki Lake, Ruth Brown, Divine, Debbie Harry, Sonny Bono, Pia Zadora, and Ric Ocasek?  When you get to hear Pia Zadora reading Alan Ginsburg's ""Howl,"" you know you've hit paydirt.  The dance segments are simply fantastic (form a big strong Madison line) but the highlight of this movie is all about wardrobe, specifically the matching outfits worn by Divine and Ricki Lake.  This is bad taste carried to the point where it is flirting with high art, you will not believe your eyes.  That Waters manages to sneak an interesting racial integration story into Hairspray only proves that the clown, as in Lear, is the one who has the ear of the King.

Technically speaking, the DVD extras are sparse, as is true for most films made before the DVD era.  Pretty much all there is consists of the theater trailer which, if I'm showing the movie to newbies, I always show first as a sort of cinematic appetizer.  The commentary is fine and informative.  Other than that, I'm not sure the DVD needs any more extras, as this is a pretty straight forward film.

The sound and color transfers were done well, and the subtitles are very accurate.

As a teacher, I plan on using this movie as an easy and non-controversal springboard into discussions about the 60's, racism, and civil rights.

Link & Tracey are both modern-thinking teens who share a love of dancing, an interest in black culture & both strongly support racial equality which I think brought them together.  Besides fabulous acting by the entire cast, this movie also focuses on (often times with wicked humor!)politics, racial segregation/intergration & interacial romance. All the songs in the movie go perfectly & really set the mood of each scene. This is a ""feel good"" movie that you can watch over & over again & never get tired of it!

499833,4,6302712920,"I've seen essentially three versions of Hairspray:

Version M:  Ten years ago, and heard it through a 4"" TV speaker.

Version P:  The play in Manhattan, in August 2002.

Version S:  Shortly after the play, the movie again, but this time through a 200-watt (RMS) two-speaker sound system.

Conclusions:

(1)  The movie and play are both excellent, but except for the names of the characters quite different.  I recommend seeing both.  Put simply (very simply), the focus of the movie is on the teenager, Tracy, while the focus of the play is on Tracy's mother.  What both the movie and play have in common is that at the end the focus-of-the movie/play goes through an adventure after which she emerges feeling significantly better about herself (dare I say that ""her self esteem improves?).

(2)  I actually enjoyed Version S better than Version M, probably due primarily to the significantly better sound.

(3)  I was 16 in June 1962 when the movie takes place, so I remember the time, and the movie captures both teen values and their relationship with their parents that I remember.

(4)  When Seaweed's younger sister says to Tracy with unqualified joy, ""You're my favorite dancer!"" she succinctly captures the powerful (and almost certainly unintended effect) that TV had on integration.",1096329600,4,1292,4.957943925233645
499834,5,6302712920,"After seeing Hairspray: The Muscical at the Pantages Theater in Los Angeles, I was tempted to watch the original feature film again, not having seen it for a few years. It is as good as I remember it, maybe even better.

Hairspray is a light entry for John Waters, the king of ""Shock Cinema."" After totally out there films like Polyester and Pink Flamingos, Waters made his first PG Hollywood film, which quickly had a cult classic on his hands.

The film made Ricki Lake a star, when she played Traci Turnblad, a 'pleasantly plump' teenager who teaches 1962 Baltimore a thing or two about integration after landing a spot on a local TV dance show.

Hairspray is a clever and witty satire of 60's life. It's supposed to be tacky and pro-America. It does have some deeper moments and some points to make about discrimination. But essentially it's a warm hearted, campy, funny flick. You only have to see who the director is to know that you aren't going to get another run-of-the-mill Hollywood story of overcoming adversity. It's a trashy take on pop culture of the 60's and the performances are great.

The film oozes John Waters even though it is very toned down compared to his earlier films. I love the storyline because it has to do with very realistic themes that were happening in those times. It's sad to know that this was Divine's last movie, but at least he went all out in it.

Obviously, the film must have some charm to have a stage musical made out of it. I did like the musical better, because the songs are just terrific, and I think this should be remade as feature film version of the stage musical. It would be a terrific companion to this, especially since many fans won't have the chance to see the spectacular musical on stage.

The terrific cast also includes Sony Bono, Ruth Brown, Deborah Harry, Vitamin C (Colleen Fitzpatrick), Jerry Stiller (Ben's dad), Leslie Ann Powers, Mink Stole, Ric Ocasek, and Pia Zadora, who all seem to be having fun with their roles. This is a great film that provides a rolicking good time for its audience. Fans of the stage show should definitely see where it all began.",1092700800,12,2128,4.586842105263158
499856,5,6302712920,"I think it's safe to say that Hairspray is a unique motion picture.  The film, while providing nonstop fun and laughs throughout, also manages to not only confront but to roll right over prejudice in several of its nefarious guises.  I was a teenager when this film came out, and sadly, it was the death of Divine (just before the movie was released) that made me aware of this film.  I don't know if that publicity helped or hurt ticket sales - Divine, for those who have never heard of him, was famous for playing female roles, and Hairspray had begun to rejuvenate his whole career.  As for the film, it's extremely campy in the best of ways, overflowing with great singing and dancing from the early 1960s, and it is the type of film that makes you feel good after you watch it.
Ricki Lake plays Tracy Turnblad, a big, bold, and beautiful teenager who dreams of dancing on the exceedingly popular Corny Collins dance show.  Her mother, played by Divine, isn't too crazy about modern music and dancing - until Tracy auditions and gets a spot on the show.  Strutting her stuff in front of the cameras, she quickly becomes Baltimore's newest sensation.  This does not sit well with Amber von Tussle (Colleen Fitzpatrick), as Tracy steals her man and then threatens to win the coveted title of Miss Auto Show 1963.  Tracy is overweight, but she likes herself just as she is and easily dismisses the fat jokes thrown her way early on.  The big issue in this film, though, is segregation.  Tracy and her best friend Penny Pingleton (Joann Havrilla) soon become friends with some of the black kids in town and begin working toward integrating the Corny Collins show.  Collins is all for the idea himself, as currently the Negro show runs only once each month under the controls of sassy Motormouth Mabel (Ruth Brown).  The station manager will not hear of integration, though, and Penny's mother is aghast to find out that her daughter is in love with an African-American.  This is 1962, of course.  The whole segregation issue becomes the basic foundation of the movie as it dances its way to the end, making Hairspray a wonderfully entertaining film with a serious message behind it.
The film is blessed with many interesting cast members.  Divine plays not only Mrs. Turnblad but also the station manager, Jerry Stiller plays Mr. Turnblad, Sonny Bono and Debbie Harry (and Debbie Harry's increasingly interesting hair) come together to play Amber von Tussle's parents, and Ric Ocasek and Pia Zadora show up as Beatniks in a strange little cameo appearance.  Of course, Ricki Lake pretty much steals the show as the big girl with big dreams, although I found Joann Havrilla's performance as Penny Pingleton quite captivating in a weird sort of way.
It is very difficult to describe Hairspray; you pretty much have to watch it to get a true feel for its entertainment assets and social commentary underpinnings.

Like the first time I went to see GREASE at the movies I went to see that movie with about 16 different people every night and did the same with HAIRSPRAY it brought back memories with the music and in the 60's when I was a teenager I fell head over heals with the movie they don't make enough of these genre anymore wish they did.  Any way loved it emensly and it will always hold a special place in my heart forever. I am now going to buy the DVD and play it over and over again and again.  This is the movie that I fell in love with Ricki Lake and I just discovered Divine who was marvelous in both parts so if you want to go back in time just you sit back in your best chair and view this movie just like I did over and over again and again you get tired of it trust me.",1069372800,,921,3.836842105263158

499859,5,6302712920,"I saw this film when it first came out in 1988.  I loved it then.  I recently saw it on the small screen.  I loved it even more.  Maybe its because I've followed the career of its star, Ricki Lake, and have seen her transformed from a chubby teenager into a slim talk show host.  Maybe its because I can appreciate the comic genius of director John Waters who is willing to push the envelope over the top on every scene.  Maybe its because I really enjoyed watching the double role played by the transvestite called Divine.  Maybe its because of the outrageous clothes worn by all the characters.  Most of all though, I know its because this film made me laugh out loud.
Hairspray is set in the early sixties, when teen age dance programs were all the rage.  And its about a fat girl who doesn't fit in, but yet is a terrific dancer.  She becomes a teenage idol though and the whole city loves her. She's smart and sassy and also wants to force the dance show to racially integrate.  And she manages to do this with just the right degree of gumption, comedy and romance.  The casting includes Sonny Bono and Deborah Harry as the parents of a teenager who is Ricki's competition, Colleen Fitzpatrick. And the singer Ruth Brown not only has a role of the mother of a teenager who is trying to integrate the show, she sings too.  Divine plays the role of Ricki's mother as well as the male owner of the TV show.  And Jerry Stiller is cast as Ricki's father.
All in all, the film is bursting with talent.  I sat there, relaxed, and laughed my head off.  This is truly a funny comedy.  Highly recommended.",1066089600,20,1600,4.351351351351352
499860,5,6302712920,"John Waters purists may argue that HAIRSPRAY, his great crossover hit, is nowhere near as lowdown dirty and outrageously sidesplitting as his earlier guerilla films, but there's no denying that this is his smoothest piece of work, with by far the best performances. Everyone by this point knows that the film concerns the attempts of Tracy Turnblad, ""an upper lower-class"" overweight white girl from inner-city 1962 Baltimore, to get onto a popular local television dance show and then to integrate it successfully. The entire cast (even the supporting throwaway parts: catch the facial expressions of Amber's friends when she's dissing Tracy in class)  is just about perfect, and is led by three magnificent teenage performances: Ricki Lake as the supremely confident Tracy; Divine, as her charmingly pushing mother; and the scene-stealer Colleen Fitzpatrick as Tracy's rival, the abominable blonde Amber. One thing that really helps the film is the superb soundtrack from the early 60s, which keeps things hopping, and the marvelous dancing (particularly on the part of Lake and Fitzpatrick) to accompany it.
The DVD version is really a treat, offering one of the finest and funniest director's commentators ever from John Waters: it's amazing to hear how much background was behind the film, which chronicles his real-life obsession with a similar Baltimore early 60's dance show. There are also some comments from Lake, who unsurprisingly reveals what a diva she really is (she's STILL upset with Waters for making her dye her hair for the film!). But the Waters's comments are laugh-out-loud funny, and there are far more of them than Lake's, which is a blessing.",1062547200,3,1668,5.223880597014926
499861,5,6302712920,"""Hairspray"" is a hilarious musical by one of the funniest directors of our time, John Waters! ""Hairspray"" revolves around the lives of Baltimore teenagers in the 1960s and how they deal with relationships, race relations, status, and the Corny Collins Show! The Corny Collins Show is a ficticious American Bandstand. All of the cool kids are dancers on the show. Ricki Lake's character, Tracy, has big dreams about being on the show. After an audition, she is given a coveted spot as one of the dancers. This begins a rivalry between her and a snobby young lady (played by Vitamin C).
Ricki Lake and Divine give excellent performances as mother and daughter. There are also great performances by Sonny Bono, Debbie Harry, and Jerry Stiller. The music and dance sequences will definitely have you tapping your feet. Even through all of the fun and hilarity, there is also an important message you can learn from.
I would highly recommend this film to people who would like to see a good, well-acted, and very funny film!!! You won't be disappointed!",1054857600,11,1048,4.860335195530726
499862,5,6302712920,"John Waters is a brilliant director, in Hairspray we see the final apperance of a much beloved Cult Icon. Divine was just about to hit mainstream, just when Hairspray hit the Top 5 Box Office. Divine passed away, none the less, Divine gave one last wonderful gem in Hairspray.
Deboarh Harry, yet another ""POP CULTURE ICON"" gives a great performance, as does Pia Zadora, Ric Ocasek and Mink Stole. The movie is set in Baltimore, where TV Dance Shows and Theme Parks are segregated along Racial lines. Hairspray is light hearted and just jam packed with great music. This is also Ricki Lake's
debute, and she is just fantastic as ""Tracey the Hair Hopper""

It combines serious drama with comedy. It even has a little domestic drama in it-but in a funny way. Ricki Lake is Tracy Turnbald, an overweight teenager who dreams of being on the ""Corny Collins Show."" Her arch rival, Amber (played by teen pop sensation Vitamin C, prior to her orange and yellow hair) will stop at nothing to destroy Tracy (Lake). Tracy is on top! She makes it on her dream show, gets her dream guy and has a fab wardrobe. The only thing that is in her way of a good life is the struggle of integration. Tracy's best friend Penny (Leslie Ann Powers) falls in love with an African American boy, Seaweed (Clayton Prince), and stuggles to keep him because her family is so racist. Will this all end out good? Well, you're just going to have to see it! I've never seen the musical, but I heard it is extremely simillar to the movie, so go see that too!!!!

Ricki Lake was perfect as Tracy, and Divine the perfect mother!

This movie and indeed all John Water's movies are a true depiction of Baltimore life past and present.  Everything you see in the movies can still be seen on the streets of ""Bawlmer"".  I must admit I am surprised that there is such a following as us ""Baltimorons"" thought no one else would understand the truly local humor and culture.

Debbie Harry and Sonny Bono are other famous faces to pop up in this hilarious comedy playing their characters gloriously over the top but the golden star must go to chat show queen, Ricki Lake who excells in her role as over weight Tracy Turnblad.

499893,5,6302712920,"""Hairspray,"" marks the mainstream feature film debut of Baltimore, Maryland's most eccentric film director, John Waters. Incorporating his hometown and his love of sixties tunes,  ""Hairspray"" chronicles the rise of a chubby Baltimore teenager  (Ricki Lake in her film debut) as she rises to the top of a local dance  show. Being the underdog in this movie, Lake's performance as Tracy  Turnblad is classic and her rise to the top makes this one of the feel-good  movies in recent years.
On the way to the top, Tracy faces fierce  competition from snobbish Amber Von Tussel and her racist, conservative  parents (played by Deborah Harry and the late Sonny Bono). Faced with a  growing demand to intergrate the show, the movie takes place in a major era  in American history as the Civil Rights movement is starting to take  form.
In comparison with his other films, I feel this is Water's best  work. He truly has made Tracy Turnblad somewhat of an antihero due to the  fact of her weight and social background, but it works perfectly. At the  end of this movie everyone will be screaming the words ""Free Tracy  Turnblad!"" over and over again (surprsingly, that line has become a  major pop-culture line on many college campuses throughout the United  State).
Supporting actors such as Divine, Jerry Stiller, Ruth Brown, Pia  Zadora, Rick Ocasek, and Michael St. Gerard (Doesn't he look like Elvis?)  bring life to this film and the film's style, costumes, and soundtrack will  give many a feeling for 1960's nolstagia.
In conclusion, this film should  become an addition to anyone's video library. I can't wait for the DVD  version to come out. Until then, buy it! You won't be disappointed.",961977600,11,1691,4.883802816901408
