genere (maneaters mega monsters) most of their stuff is quite good.",1306108800,,155,4.571428571428571
4392532,3,B004K4FUVQ,"Dinoshark had nothing ""big"" in terms of quality either way, although there were small things I enjoyed. The characters get considerably more focus than the Sharktopus cast, the attacks are more ambitious than most Syfy films while showing some restaint from reaching ridiculous levels like Sharktopus, Corman acting in his film demonstrated he's still enthusiastic about filmmaking after all this time and hopefully will produce many more monster films

Dinoshark has much more replayability than Sharktopus actually, it's pretty fun while not getting over-the-top. Sharktopus meanwhile has more spectacle but once you've seen that there's not much motivation to watch it again.",1304985600,,678,5.647058823529412
4392533,5,B004K4FUVQ,"Dinoshark is a fun monster film packed with entertaining pieces, good fx (cheap), and characters that are pretty human. I bought this Sharktopus on DVD and comparing the two is a bit difficult because Dinoshark takes itself more serious, while Sharktopus lampoons Roger Corman films of yesteryear. The reason why those old Roger Corman monster movies are still entertaining to this day is because they took themselves serious, when you make a film that's too self aware (Sharktopus), you lose the charm. I'm glad to say that Dinoshark doesn't make the same mistakes, its a straight up monster movie that's very similar to Jaws. I also love the fact that both Dinoshark and Sharktopus were set/filmed in Mexico. You really get an idea of how beautiful the country is and how much fun the crew must've had filming both pictures.",1304899200,4,826,4.9071428571428575
4392534,3,B004K4FUVQ,"SYFY keeps pumping them out but this one isn't as much fun.
The creature isn't all that impressive and his kills are redundant and predictable.  Eric Balfour who showed some potential on TV's 24 is in line to be the new Casper van Dien of cheesy SyFy movies especially in light of his roles in RISE OF THE GARGOYLES and SKYLINE.
Moderately entertaining, but doesn't meet even SyFy's lowered standards.",1304035200,,401,4.728571428571429
4392535,4,B004K4FUVQ,"As BIG shark movies (of a prehistoric nature) go, this was pretty standard.  I don't fault it for that.  I went by the endorsement: Roger Corman Presents, and snapped it up.  Roger has a good sense when it comes to cheese.  He is, unfortunately, a terrible actor and should have taken a cue from Hitchcock: don't speak, just occasionally wander through.
I love monsters with enormous appetites and/or a bottomless pit for a stomach.  I immediately lost track of the number of folks it chewed up.  How they all fit in there I'll never know!
Of course, there was a dopey cop, there always is, that, and a doomed sidekick, plus a damsel under dressed.  It was pretty much what one could hope for in a movie of this type.  Another keeper!",1303948800,9,734,4.507575757575758
4392536,5,B004K4FUVQ,"This is what I wanted to see; a B movie. This could not possibly happen which is half or more of the fun but some of the things it is criticized for such as a teacher coaching a sports team is absolutely realistic.

This is light viewing. A way to relax spending some time watching a monster movie. They didn't camp it up. They pretty much played it straight. It isn't funny and it could give kids nightmares. The special effects are obviously special effects. This is a low budget film but again that is part of the charm to me at least. There is a lot of gore.",1303862400,3,562,4.155963302752293
4392537,1,B004K4FUVQ,"I love the sy-fy channel just as much as the next guy, but someone needs to bring an end to their ridiculous ""sy-fy original movies."" I came across ""Dinoshark"" on the sy-fy channel and allowed it to play while I sat on the couch and did some work on my laptop. I expected little from ""Dinoshark"" other than some mindless entertainment, but I was truly unprepared for just how craptacular it really was.

Do the people who make these cheap movies put ANY thought into them at all? Understandably, budgets are tight for this kind of film-making, but that's no excuse for the unbelievable horrendous dialogue in this movie, the absurd parallels to ""Jaws,"" the stupid special effects that don't make any sense in a logical world bound by the laws of physics, or the just plain overall bad movie-making.

Avoid ""Dinoshark"" at all costs. It WILL make a victim of you!",1300147200,5,861,4.657894736842105
4392538,5,B004K4FUVQ,"Its awesome with gore,action,and high speed chases also with Eric Balfour in the movie.

Lets talk about gore, it tears then apart limb by limb like the surfer who jumped in the air and the dinoshark chomp on him and when a guy on a water jet and the dinoshark jumps in the air and grabed him. A-W-E-S-O-M-E

Also the action part has guns and a rocket launcher also frags but a harpoon that shots the shark in the eye.

The high speed chase is when Eric is trying to reascue a kid, I thought the kid was going to get eaten, but thank goodness he did not die.

so if any of you people say its a bad movie you are stupid.",1298678400,2,619,4.008130081300813

4392663,1,B004K4FUVQ,"There are many B Movies that are awesome because of how terrible they are- over the top stuff, actors who're obviously enjoying the parts and not trying for too much drama, etc. Dinoshark is not one of those, it is just plain bad. Even though it has Roger Corman's name involved (and he's 'acting' in it) its nowhere near his usual standards for these things. Way too much backstory, character drama and just plain talking by people who can't act. If you like the kind of movies this is supposed to be, buy ""Dinocroc vs Supergator"" instead.",1366070400,,540,4.577319587628866

4392665,4,B004K4FUVQ,"A classic ""B"" movie only works if the actors take it seriously and play it straight. In Dinoshark, they do. As always, the CGI could have been a little better but what the heck?!",1351987200,,178,4.264705882352941
4392666,3,B004K4FUVQ,"It wasn't too bad for a B movie and was even moderately entertaining.  However, the actress who played Carol was very annoying.  She looked rather awkward and seemed to be a bit old to run around in skimpy shorts and bikini tops.  Don't get me wrong I get the movie is full of bad acting and girls in swimsuits but the character of Carol was older and suppose to be a respected researcher and dressed like a teenager....so yea pretty awkward.  The way she spoke was rather annoying too.  I could have done without seeing the lead male actor's plumbers crack when he jumped down to the lower level of the boat...but this isn't a high quality movie and I tend to be forgiving when mutated monsters attack.  This isn't one of the better monster movies I have seen so I would only recommed it if you have a mutated monster addiction.

And do not expect alot of extras on the DVD.  You pretty much get scene selection and trailer for the movie.",1329264000,,939,4.38728323699422
4392667,4,B004K4FUVQ,"Roger Corman proves you're never too old to make a cheesy bad movie, unleashing Dinoshark on an unsuspecting world.  After spending the last 150 million years or so frozen in a block of ice, the creature (basically a shark with the head and scales of a dinosaur) decides he is more than due for a vacation and sets off for the sun and fun of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.  Like any tourist, Dinoshark overindulges himself in the local cuisine, takes part in a number of outdoor activities, and just has a great old time.  Even though his trademark killing move includes jumping out of the water, only one man ever manages to see him - local boat operator Trace McGraw (Eric Balfour).  Authorities blame the first few deaths on a tiger shark - and then they apparently just stop caring, no matter how many people disappear or die. They are apparently more concerned with drug smuggling (yeah, right) than a rash of local deaths.  There's certainly no Mexican equivalent to Roy Scheider's character in Jaws running around yelling ""Get out of the water!""  Instead, it's game on for all the excursion boats, parasailers, jet skiers, and swimmers - and nothing is going to stop the big regatta festival.  In other words, it's feeding time at the Dinoshark corral.

Unfortunately for Dinoshark, it makes the mistake of eating the bottom half of one of Trace's friends - that makes it personal for him and mutual friend Carol Brubaker (Iva Hasperger), a tall, blonde Princeton graduate who supposedly teaches but spends most of her time coaching girls' water polo, hanging out in a seedy bar, studying marine biology just for the fun of it, and holding off the advances of creepy old men.  Together, Trace and Carol set out to find and kill the creature.  With what, you ask?  Well, it seems that any Mexican can borrow all kinds of heavy equipment from the military - and the local bar owner is Mexican.  Carol also has connections with a local scientist (played by none other than Roger Corman himself) who might be able to determine the creature's vulnerabilities.

The special effects of Dinoshark are both good and bad.  On the bad side, it's obviously a computer generated creature, and some of the shots of it swimming along tend to be on the repetitive side.  On the other hand, many of the killings are of the up close and personal variety, with Dinoshark clasping victims in its jaws and taking them down to their bloody deaths.  We're also treated to several shots of gory remains, which I certainly appreciated.  In the end, it doesn't really matter that the creature looks smaller than it should or that what should be the most spectacular scene in the film lacks any excitement whatsoever - the special effects are still a positive, as far as I'm concerned.

If you're a fan of the ""awesomely awful made-for-TV movie genre"" or happy traveler in the schlock-filled world of sci-fi B-movies, you're probably going to enjoy Dinoshark.  It's a heck of a lot better than a lot of the low-budget movies Roger Corman has made over the years.  It's true that there's a lot of bad acting on display among the supporting cast (including Corman), but I think Balfour and Hasperger actually do a pretty good job carrying the movie on their shoulders.  This is just a good, low-budget monster movie made in the old B-movie tradition, and I quite enjoyed watching it.",1310428800,20,3355,4.730240549828179
4392668,3,B004K4FUVQ,"You already know what you are getting into when you rent a movie like this. A bunch of random scenes where various people are consumed while people wander around thinking it is just an ordinary creature such as a tiger shark wreaking havoc. One guy witnesses the truth and almost nobody believes him. Sadly, the creature targets that guys friends in addition to various vacationers, and said witness goes on the hunt to destroy creature who is consuming these people. The creature, Dinoshark, is of course always at the right place at the right time.
So, we get some funny deaths...the surfer, the lifeguards and their boat, the parasailer, and so on. Of course, plenty of hot chicks are consumed along the way.
Eventually, our hero takes a jet ski and a grenade to do battle with the Dinoshark after it eats a tourist tourboat, and all but one of the people on it, while the hero's hot girl compatriot, who is a professor, water polo coach, etc...follows him, looking incapable of doing anything herself.

Basically, it is exactly what you expect....campy, funny, characters who cant help but make bad choices, with some requisite bad acting and a silly looking creature to boot. It is pretty much average as far as B movies go. You will probably enjoy it, but you also probably won't give it much thought for too long after watching. In fact, i can barely remember what this review was supposed to be about....",1309478400,3,1412,4.716599190283401
4392669,5,B004K4FUVQ,"Ok so I haven't watched the actual film yet because I just watched the trailer and I'm pretty sure it showed every single kill in the movie, the plot, and the ending. So if your thinking about spending the money to watch this on Amazon.com just check out the trailer and you can get all the high points from the movie.",1309132800,,318,4.229508196721311
4392670,4,B004K4FUVQ,"The film's called ""Dinoshark"" and it came from Syfy. What's that tell ya? It's a micro-budget creature feature. The question is, does it deliver? Yes.

This is another take on the well-worn ""Jaws"" theme but stands out because it takes place in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and features a nigh super prehistoric shark.

Although the dinoshark itself and the things it does (like taking down a helicopter and jumping over barriers) are unbelieveable, the story and characters take it seriously, so the viewer is able to suspend belief and enjoy the flick for what it is.

I was impressed with the good group of characters and their believable relationships. The filmmakers obviously put some effort into the story.

Eric Balfour stars as the protagonist, Trace, and Iva Hasperger is his female counterpart, Carol. Balfour would make a great Sub-Mariner or Spock with his angular look and Iva is all-around gorgeous, top to bottom. In fact, the women in the film are a huge highlight. Outstanding job on that front.

Bottom line: ""Dinoshark"" is nothing to write home about but it delivers as a made-for-tv nature-runs-amok flick.
