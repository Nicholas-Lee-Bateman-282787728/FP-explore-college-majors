8159115,5,B000KUCTTU,In the beginning technical and somewhat boring but as info progressed it actually got down to the nitty gritty. For a beginer such as I very informative.,1319500800,,153,4.703703703703703
8159116,5,B000KUCTTU,"I have to admit, when I ordered this video for work I was skeptical (mostly because of the superhero demonstrative characters) but it actually is a really well made very easy to follow film. It's jam packed with really good information, enough so that I ended up having to take notes and watch it a few times to get it all.

Really fun too, doesn't get too bogged down in dry facts, but tries to pass on the information while keeping it light and fast paced so you don't get bored.",1309824000,,481,4.285714285714286
8159117,4,B000KUCTTU,"The ""Introduction to Mold Making and Casting"" DVD is a good introduction to the subject, but geared to Smooth-On's line of products. Smooth-On does make very good products but they can be over priced. If you are just getting started in mold making and/or casting, this video is a good beginning point and a Smooth-On starter kit might be the way to go.

The video does a good job taking you through the process of selecting a model, making a mold box, preparing the model for duplication, mixxing and pouring silicone, demolding, mixxing and pouring casting resin, and various finnishing options. You can learn quite a bit from this video that can be applied to this hobby.

As you get more experience, check out other sites by doing searches on words like ""casting resin"", ""silicone"", ""hobby silicone"", etc. You will find many sites offering good products at prices that are likely better than Smooth-On.

Recommended for the beginer, experienced mold makers will get little out of this DVD.",1229817600,9,992,4.892857142857143
