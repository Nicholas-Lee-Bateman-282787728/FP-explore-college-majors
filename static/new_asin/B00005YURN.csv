1677003,3,B00005YURN,"I Love the wiggles!  We have most of their videos, but I have to say we were very dissapointed with this one.  The quality wasn't their best and the songs weren't all that ""catchy"".  The dances were done by a different choreographer, and the children used weren't as professional as others used in other videos.  Our 1 year old son doesn't pay any attention to this video at all!...",1018051200,5,382,4.492753623188406
1677004,5,B00005YURN,"My son will be 2 this month and he has just started liking The Wiggles.  Before them he would not sit still long enough to watch anything.  He loves these guys, so do I!  He has learned so much from them.  All kinds of words, dances, and he knows all of their videos and songs.  I am not kidding!  They are great!  We now have 4 of their videos, 1 DVD, and one cassette tape!  You won't regret your selection!",1017878400,,409,4.025
1677005,4,B00005YURN,"My grandson Christopher loves music, and this is one of the best we have bought. He is so happy when we play it. He has learned all the music and the dances, and he is only 2years and eight months. I recommend this to all.",1017014400,2,222,3.9555555555555557
1677006,5,B00005YURN,"This is the latest video from The Wiggles - maybe I'm biased being from Australia but these guys are great.  My girls love them (1 and 2.5 years)and dance and sing along to their favourite songs.  Each song has simple dance moves so that your toddler can easily copy Jeff(Purple Wiggle), Murray (Red Wiggle), Greg (Yellow Wiggle) and Anthony (Blue Wiggle).  Captain Feathersword (the friendly Pirate), Dorothy the Dinosaur, Wags the Dog and Henry the Octopus all feature in this video as well.
What I like about The Wiggles is that the guys really enjoy what they do, they have a great time singing and dancing for the kids and the kids love it.  You can really tell they love what they do.
This video has lots of kids dancing and getting involved in the songs as well as one song which is all animation which is pretty cute - ""Caveland"".",1014249600,24,838,4.529801324503311
1677017,3,B00005YURN,"I like the format of the Wiggles on this DVD. They still use the real backgrounds (not the CGI ones in later videos) and they have children singing and doing motions that get my kids attention. However, there is a reason not many of these songs have made it to multiple DVDs or a Best of DVD. This is definitely geared to a more ""down under"" crowd. The songs my 16 month olds like are: Wiggly Party and Caveland (interestingly, this is a computer made cartoon of Wiggles singing as cavemen). They will pop their head up from time to time to catch some of the other songs on here, but this DVD just doesn't seem to be as bright and catchy as some of the other ones are. We are collecting all the Wiggles DVDs that we can though so this was a definite must to purchase. I rated it with three starts because, again, my kids don't seem to be as interested in this one as some of the other DVDs the Wiggles have made.",1401148800,,912,4.15819209039548
1677018,1,B00005YURN,"This is the worst company i have ever dealt with, i bet there products are cheap and not worth it..
i do not recommend working with this company or buying anything off of this company your best bet is to run and buy a little cheaper or more expensive i would rather spend more money not to ever have have to deal with them again.",1393372800,,329,4.076923076923077

1677021,5,B00005YURN,"This DVD is very entertaining for children. My 2 year old son loves The Wiggles and he especially loved this dvd. He danced to many of the songs and laughed at the funny antics of Captain Feathersword. Even my 7 year old son enjoyed the songs and dances! We borrowed this dvd from our local library, but I'm sure we'll purchase it soon. I even enjoyed the lively songs. Well, worth the money if your children like The Wiggles!",1223856000,,426,4.405063291139241
1677022,4,B00005YURN,"My daughter and I love their dances. She especially loves the song ""Hoop-Dee-Doo! It's a Wiggly Party"", the music is so beautiful. I'm glad I've bought this DVD.",1191542400,,161,4.785714285714286
1677023,5,B00005YURN,"I had never seen or watched the wiggles before until my son showed in interest in singing and dancing. Hoop-Dee-Doo was the first Wiggles movie I bought for my 18 month old son and he loves this wiggles movie! (I too enjoy watching and singing along with him). The songs are catchy and fun with easy to do dances for the kids to follow. My son mimics the dancing and hums the tunes. If I would let him, he would watch this movie all day over and over.",1163030400,,451,4.136363636363637
1677024,3,B00005YURN,"I wondered what all the fuss about the colors was about, now I know. Yikes! It is enough to give you a headache. The songs are just okay and I didn't see where many of them would stick in my head if I ever purchased this DVD (we borrowed it from the library). My daughter seemed to like it, though. Unfortunately, I watch DVDs with her a lot and I wasn't dying to see this one again, and we have enough other good Wiggles material already that I don't need to buy one I am not excited about.",1162339200,,491,4.020408163265306
1677025,5,B00005YURN,"My 16 month old daughter, Marina, has loved the Wiggles since she was 2 months old. She is learning so much from them. She can do the dances to Rock-a-Bye-Bear and Point Your Fingers and Do the Twist.(which can be found on Wiggly Adventure). Hoop-Dee-Doo Wiggly Party was her first dvd of them. It is a wonderful movie. Even though they are a show for kids as most parents know these songs will get stuck in your head. lol. Play your Guitar with Murray is diffenately one of them.",1154649600,,480,4.404494382022472
1677026,4,B00005YURN,My son and I both enjoyed this movie.  The songs were catchy.,1154390400,,61,4.083333333333333
1677058,2,B00005YURN,"My 2 yr old daughter absolutely loves Wiggle Time so I purchased this DVD thinking she would love it as well.  Where are all the nice ""simple, catchy songs"" like on Wiggle Time?  The sets are elaborate, the songs are long.  Neither my daughter nor myself enjoy this DVD.",1130803200,2,270,4.469387755102041
1677059,4,B00005YURN,"My daughter loves The Wiggles. My daughter loves dinosaurs. This  dvd has a song called Caveland on it which is animated with dinosaurs. In the ""special features"" section there is a featurette on how they animated the video. At first all she watched was the one song over and over again. Then she got into a bunch of other songs. For adults, it's pretty boring. The Wiggles are on a set and just sing one song after another. Unlike The Wiggles Safari, which is set in the Australian Zoo with crocodile hunter, Steve Irwin. That is a better dvd. It's on location with loads of animals. I kind of enjoy it.",1128729600,,604,4.441441441441442
1677060,5,B00005YURN,Both my boys loved The Wiggles and one boy still does. Excellent and joyful melodies and good modeling for responsible citizenship.  These four are very entertaining and it is very obvious that the love what they do.,1126569600,,216,4.837837837837838
1677061,5,B00005YURN,"This is one of our families favorite of the Wiggles dvds. This dvd is great - colorful set, lots of music, kids dancing, and just lots of fun! This is one you don't wanna miss.",1105747200,,176,4.057142857142857
1677062,5,B00005YURN,"MY SON ABSOLUTELY LOVES THIS TAPE. HE CAN WATCH IT OVER AND OVER (AND OVER), BUT THEN SO CAN I. THE SONGS ARE REALLY CATCHY TO SING TO. MY SON LOVES TO DANCE THE HOOP-DEE-DOO POLKA. A GREAT BUY!!",1104969600,,195,4.0256410256410255
1677063,5,B00005YURN,"Okay, I'm biased.  Barney the dinosaur drives me up the wall.  So I cannot express the relief I felt when my daughter, who at the time was three, discovered this particular Wiggles video.  Watching them sing and dance to catchy tunes instantly broke her Barney addiction, and the Wiggles became her new favorite.

From Captain Feathersword to Henry the Octopus, the characters are quite original while remaining simple enough to entertain and relate to a young child.  Also the tunes are catchy, and the acting good, and the dance and action scenes quite well choreographed.",1102723200,,574,5.0
1677064,4,B00005YURN,"As with the better Wiggles videos, this one has lots of song and dance, and isn't dragged down by a tedious ""plot"". Some of their best songs are ""performed"" and kids play an important part.",1097971200,9,189,4.428571428571429
1677065,5,B00005YURN,"Out of all our Wiggles Videos, and we have them all, my son loves this the most. I think because there are lots of kids in it. The whole video is very simple.

It does get a bit corny in certain areas...La Cucaracha is a bit corny. Marie's Wedding is a very neat song and dance. But for all you Wiggles Mom's there's Fun On The Farm- I have to say I'm not big on overalls on a man but these guys sure know how to make them look good. :-)

It's worth the buy!",1094169600,,458,3.8105263157894735
1677066,5,B00005YURN,"As usual, the Wiggles incorporate dancing, fruit salad, eating (Anthony, of course), playing with dinosaurs (not just Dorothy), and songs and traditions from other cultures--Ireland and Mexico, to name a few.  The guys just get better and better!",1088985600,,246,5.473684210526316
1677067,5,B00005YURN,"My son is going to be 2 and he is absolutely in love with this video. He watches it about 5 times a day and before he goes to bed he asks for ""Uggles"" and has to have a Wiggly Party. I got him Top of the Tots first and he was hooked until I bought him this one and gets upset if I try to put on the first one. He dances like an Emu and lifts his leg in Hoop Dee Doo and even takes Mom by the hands to dance with him. All of the balloons falling in the beginning make him crack up and he calls my husband and myself every time they fall. My husband and I get a little tired of putting on his other tapes over and over again but Wiggles we never get tired of. We find ourselves singing the songs all of the time even when its not on. Someone commented on there being too many kids on stage and taking away from the Wiggles characters themselves. I have to totally disagree. Kids need to be able to associate and they love seeing kids their age having fun too. I love also how the Wiggles include children from all races and have children with medical challenges. Showing children that everyone should be accepted regardless of how they look. It's just great!",1085097600,5,1156,4.030434782608696
1677088,5,B00005YURN,"my 2 year old son loves this dvd! I can hear him jumping from the other room to the music and turns around and has loads of fun! at his age he is not to concerned about copying the dance moves, he usually has a ball making up his own.he watches it two times and asks for more. the songs are catchy and entertaining as well. I would recommend it",1084752000,,344,3.9285714285714284
1677089,5,B00005YURN,Great fun if you are a Wiggles Fan! My daughter loves this DVD and it one of her favs of the Wiggles. The tape or CD that goes along with this is a blast too. You can't go wrong with the Wiggles and the 1-4 age group. Highly recommend buying this.,1078099200,,247,3.8627450980392157
1677090,5,B00005YURN,"My daughter- 15 months- loves this video.  She would watch it twice a day, every day, if I'd let her.  The tunes are catchy;  they, unfortunately, get stuck in my head, too!",1074988800,,173,4.34375
1677091,4,B00005YURN,"What a nice surprise this Australian children's troupe is for American parents.  Four peppy former rock musicians, dressed up like 1960s Star Trek extras, put on a happy clappy musical show that our kids can't get enough of!  The troupe of costumed sidekicks is also first-rate, the frenetic Captain Feathersword, especially.  The songs are memorable, and your kids will enjoy hearing you sing them in between viewings (if you are a singing-type parent like me, that is).  Production values are good, and the whole effect is very appealing for the preschool audience.  Hoop-dee-doo, indeed!",1073952000,,590,5.23404255319149
1677092,5,B00005YURN,"I have a 2 1/2 year old granddaughter. We discovered The Wiggles on The Disney Channel last spring. My granddaughter was immediately charmed, much to our dismay. The adult s here found them really annoying. But, it wasn't very long until we could sing along with all the old favorites. This video was the first we purchased. It holds her attention all the way through. She is usually not wanting for it to end. We also own Wiggly Safari and Dorothy's Magical Birthday Adventure. The latter is more in the format of a real movie. It is very entertaining in a Beatles ""Help"" sort-of-way. So far we love every one of the videos. Thank goodness for the Wiggles...anything that keeps a 2 year old busy for an hour at a time had my undying gratitude!",1068768000,,744,4.518518518518518
1677093,5,B00005YURN,"My 21 month old absolutely loves the wiggles, and I can replay this tape over and over 10 times in a day and he never get's bored. I would recommend this to everyone who's child loves the wiggles",1066608000,,195,4.157894736842105
1677094,5,B00005YURN,This is the best Wiggles video. We do have (and love) all of them. We have watched this one over and over again. Still love it. Even the parents will find themselves singing along with this one after the 4th or 5th time seeing it I promise :-),1062720000,,243,4.083333333333333
1677095,5,B00005YURN,"I own 6 Wiggles tapes, two cassettes, and have been to one of their concerts. I have no kids, but I have five neices and nephews I babysit constently. They all like the wiggles and they all love Hoop Dee Doo. There is not too much Captain Feathersword if the kids had their way he would be in every skit. The accent don't bother the kids and I would recommend this movie. It is different ,but it would get boring doing the samething over and over again. The songs are just as catchy, even the dancing don't bother them because they just make up their own dancing. The captain's magic buttons scetch is my neices favorite. This movie is great along with Yummy Yummy, Wiggly Safari, Wiggles Bay, Magic Adventure, and Wiggly Party. Can't wait for the next wiggles movie to come out!!",1060300800,2,780,4.461538461538462
1677096,3,B00005YURN,"My 20 month-old daugther and I love The Wiggles.  She is happy and entertained as she watches, sings, and dances along.  I am happy to be seeing four real men -- not purple dinosaurs or Elmo or animated creatures.
Although my little girl enjoys Hoop-Dee-Doo!, I think she gets more out of the television series and DVDs like Yummy-Yummy.  In both those, each short but sweet segment has a unique feeling -- they are easy to sing to and easy to dance to.  In other words, I think those present more variety and balance between talk, songs and dance.
However, with Hoop-Dee-Doo, the segments seem longer.  (Try keeping a 20 month-old's attention longer than necessary!)  The songs seem longer, there seems to be more talking.  The stage eventually gets boring.
Do I regret buying this for my little girl?  Nope, because I know she enjoys hearing the songs and seeing the colorful personalities.  However, I would prefer to get a different Wiggles DVD that is easier for her to participate with.",1060041600,4,992,4.754385964912281
1677097,5,B00005YURN,"We have 6 Wiggles VHS tapes and 2 Wiggles DVDs, as both of my boys (ages 2.5 and 14 months) adore the Wiggles.  This one is, by far, my 2.5 year old's favorite! He begs to see ""hoop-he-hoo"" all the time and would be perfectly content to watch it all day long.  In fact, while we were out at a park today, he found a small wooden stage and proceeded to climb up and sing & dance to ""Wiggly Party"".  I'd DEFINITELY recommend this video to Wiggles fans.",1056672000,,450,4.090909090909091
1677134,5,B00005YURN,Our daughter watches this for days - dancing away to the songs.  Ohter videos like the Safari don't hold her attention for even 5 minutes.,1055548800,,138,4.52
1677135,4,B00005YURN,"My 17 month old received this video for Easter.  She likes it and it will keep her interest, but she has a little bit of trouble following it.  She prefers Wiggle Time as those songs are also on the television show she watches.  The budget on this film was obviously greater than on previous releases by the Wiggles.  The colors are bright and they songs are fun.  I love that the video will get my daughter up and dancing.",1054684800,,423,4.30379746835443
1677136,5,B00005YURN,"Yes, we all watch our Wiggly friends on Playhouse Disney...we all know and adore the TV shows, and if you ONLY enjoy those, you should stick to: It's Wiggle Time, Toot Toot, and those sort.  I don't know why anyone would have such strong feelings against this video...Having said that, I enthusiastically recommend Hoop-Dee-Doo! It's a Wiggly Party.  I have a 15 month old and a 4 year old and they are just absoulutely entertained by this Wiggly hit!  It's 50+ minutes of free time for mommy and daddy while it's on.  Just fabulous.  And it's fun to watch with them which is an added bonus.  We have millions of children's videos and DVDs that bore me, and more importantly have bored my kids over time.  I know all of you know what I mean.  Well, not this one.  They even like watching and dancing to the credits, amazingly enough.  Very catchy songs and fun dances get them on their feet and jumping around...even the baby claps along and shuffles her feet to the Wiggly beat!  Yes sir, money well spent.  BUY IT NOW!!!  =)",1052438400,2,1026,4.481081081081081
1677137,4,B00005YURN,"My son loves the songs on this video and it's fun to see how the kids have grown up on the show....The songs are cute as are the little kids but it's a little more ""in your face"" with strange back grounds and some louder noises that sometimes scares my two year old....he loves the songs and dances and I would recommend this show!",1052265600,,331,4.1875
1677138,5,B00005YURN,"This was the first Wiggles video that I bought and I absolutely loved it, as did my daughter, even from the age of 10 months. There seem to be a lot of people who started with earlier tapes who feel that this tape is not as enjoyable but this is still one of my favorites, mostly due to the upbeat songs and constant motion. I LIKE the small children on the set, they seemed to give my daughter a point of reference, the dancers on other tapes have moves which are difficult for her (she is now 18 months). Of course this will change as she gets older.
This tape is fun and easy on an adults ears and I can heartily recommend it.",1052179200,2,629,4.080645161290323
1677139,4,B00005YURN,"I had never heard of this group until recently, but my 2-year old son never tires of this video.  At least twice a day, he cries ""Wiggles"" after which viewing this DVD is the only thing to calm him down.  The numbers are musical and catchy, and the performers are overall pretty talented.  A good change of pace from ""Elmo"" and ""Barney"", which my son seems to have lost some interst in.  I have not viewed any other Wiggles videos, so I can't compare this to earlier ones.",1050969600,,472,4.329545454545454
1677140,5,B00005YURN,"With the exception of ""It's A Wiggly Wiggly World"" (which is in its own class, given the original material and guest performers), this is by far the best Wiggles video.  It's fast-paced, the songs are catchy as can be, and it's wildly entertaining.  If you're not afraid to let your guard down, you'll find yourself dancing along with your kids throughout.
And you'll be winded by the end of ""Wiggly Party"" and ""Hoop Dee Doo,"" the opening numbers.  Thankfully, there are slower numbers strategically placed along the way, such as ""Move Like an Emu"" and ""Marie's Wedding,"" giving both the big and little folks a chance to catch their breath.  But before you know it, you're back to a ""Fun on the Farm"" a ""Wobbly Dance,"" or a ""Wiggle Hula,"" and the frantic pace is on again.
This tape gets constant play in my house, and neither I nor my daughter seem to tire of it.  My hands may get a bit sore from the ""clap-clap-clap-clap"" during ""Hoop Dee Doo,"" and my arms and legs a bit tired from dragging my daughter around during my sad attempts at the polka, but that's well worth the price of admission.
This is a quality production throughout, even if the computer-animated ""Caveland"" seems a bit out of place.  The kids won't know the difference--they'll love it all.  And unless you're anti-Wiggles, you will, too.  Let go and have fun.",1050624000,,1332,4.614406779661017
1677141,5,B00005YURN,"Our 18 month twins love this video (mommy and daddy love it also), very up beat. New songs and dances... I have read other peoples reviews and can't believe that anyone would put this video down, very strange????? Our children enjoy all the colors and all the new songs, I don't know about your children but our little ones get bored with the same thing over and over and this video is full of new songs. And like all toddlers and infants they enjoy all the bright colors and upbeat music. And as usual Captain Feathersword is funny, he definatly adds some extra fun to the video, and yes he is alittle off but in a enjoyable way.  I think in this day and age people look for something to be critical or suspicious of in everything and I am probably one of the most protective parents you will meet, and there is nothing wrong with this video, my husband and I cannot even understand why or how anyone would find something wrong with this video. We give this video a big thumbs up!!!! AAA+++",1049500800,2,991,4.356756756756757

1677154,2,B00005YURN,"My daughter and I love the Wiggles and their videos are a part of our day.  We have enjoyed Yummy Yummy, Toot Toot, and Wiggle Time.  This video has been produced more recently and I am very dissapointed.  Their previous videos have been at a slower pace with calm and gentle backgrounds.  This video has hypnotic backgrounds and a much faster pace.  I'm not sure I can put my finger on all of the changes.  The Wiggles themselves have severly short haircuts which looks kinda of military, and not warm and friendly.  Dorothy, Wags and Henry all have a different look and none of these do I see as good.  The music is more at a disco tempo then one suited for little ears and eyes.  It also seems as though the Wiggles themselves are trying to be more animated and trying too hard.  My daughter pays no attention to this video although she loves her other Wiggles videos.  I can only assume that some Madison Avenue type got to these guys and they surrendered the precious innocence and gentleness they once had.",1049241600,,1012,4.475409836065574
1677155,3,B00005YURN,"We own six(!) Wiggles videos, and this is probably our least favorite.  Well, I suppose I should clarify:  the two-year-old in our house enjoys all of them, but her parents faces fill with dread whenever she selects this one.
Our biggest complaint:  too much Captain Feathersword.  We liked him in the previous videos, really we did!  But this time there are FAR too many scenes of Captain making faces, Captain singing in a high-pitched voice, Captain falling down, and Captain just generally hamming it up.  Yes, he's attempting to be funny, but he quickly becomes quite irritating.  The long intro scene to the ""Captain's Magic Buttons"" song is particularly tiresome.
Beyond that, the overall video just seems rather dull compared to the others.",1046390400,7,748,5.032520325203252

My 4 1/2 year old also loves it; she dances and sings all the songs.  The hand gestures that go along with the songs are easy to pick up, and the songs are catchy, yet just silly enough to intrigue both of them.  We're definitely buying a second Wiggles video.
I find the Wiggles a refreshing change from cartoons, even though it's a bit surreal viewed through grown-up eyes...",1045958400,,530,4.27

He does enjoy some of the tape like the hoop dee doo song (the first one), Captain's magic buttons,the farm song and Marie's wedding.  This is a definite good buy but in terms of choosing your first couple of wiggly videos I would choose Toot toot, Wiggle time, or Yummy Yummy.

My daughter loves all of the forst three videos - she doesn't even glance at the screen when I play ""Hoop-de-Do"".  All of the computer generated backgrounds and kids dancing all over make it confusing to little kids. The dancing is lacking the creativity and enthusiasm of previous videos too.  I love the Wiggles, but I don't recommend this one for younger fans like age 1-3.  I HIGHLY recommend ""Wiggle Time"" and ""Yummy Yummy""",1042156800,,597,4.813725490196078

And until now, she generally wouldn't pay attention to much on TV. (Not that we want her glued to the set, but a DVD she enjoys once in a while is a good thing.)
The campiness of this DVD makes it great--the [bad] costumes, the [bad] ""How to Make an Emu Costume"" sketch and the subtle cultural differences. (""If  you don't have a guitar, just use a cricket bat."" Yeah, OK, Greg. Sure.) Nevertheless, you can't argue with what works, and the toddlers I know that have seen this thing can't take their eyes off it. Best description I've heard yet: The Wiggles are a cross between the Monkeys and Barney.",1037145600,,747,4.452554744525547
1677202,5,B00005YURN,"I highly recommend this DVD.  It is the only Wiggles DVD that we have and our daughter loves it.  She likes the music and dancing the most.  We often skip past the ""talking"" sections, between the dances.  We bought this DVD (along with others) to keep our 14 month-old daughter's attention while we drove from California to Tennessee.  She is now 17 months old and this is her favorite DVD.  She has most of the Baby Einstein DVD's and likes them too...but she can dance to the Wiggles by following the children in the DVD. The only down-side is that we can't seem to find any other Wiggles videos on DVD that we like & we don't want to buy VHS.  So we're still waiting for the others to come out.",1036972800,,697,4.2748091603053435

1677204,3,B00005YURN,"My 16 month-old loves the Wiggles, and after a few skeptical viewings on Playhouse Disney, so do I.  We have Wiggle Time and Wiggly, Wiggly World.  My daughter is just getting to the age when she tries to mimic the dance moves and hand motions she sees.  So it is somewhat disappointing to see less of the fun and easy choreography that marked the Wiggles earlier works.  There is nothing for her to try and imitate, so she loses interest more quickly.  It seems that most of the choreography is somewhat random, as there are many children of different ages and abilities throughout the video.  The songs are lots of fun, however, and quite catchy (maybe moreso for me than for my kid!).  The graphic backgrounds don't bother me as much as some other reviewers, although they do get repetitive after a while.  And while I love Capt. Feathersword, he tends to get rather shrill sometimes.  I think he's quite talented, but his voice can get an octave or two too high.  Overall, I love the Wiggles' commitment to entertaining children.  They always look like they tremendously enjoy what they're doing.  And it is fun to try and pick out Greg and Murray's kids and Anthony's neice and nephew.  But this video doesn't have quite the loopy joi de vivre that most of the others have.  This may be better for older kids, but I don't think it will hold a toddlers interest as much.",1035158400,18,1374,4.555102040816327
1677205,4,B00005YURN,"The Hallorans are gone! They were the excellent dancers from the other tapes. Their Choreographer was Leanne Halloran, who played Officer Beaples, who is also gone. The contract The Wiggles had with the Donna Halloran School of Dance is over for good. The songs are wonderful, but the dancing is non-existent with the new Choreographer (who was Dorothy The Dinosaur) Leanne Ashley. Although she herself is an excellent dancer, as a Choreographer, she does not deliver and the pizzazz the Wiggles once had is gone. Still my 26-month-old loves this video a lot.
My other complaint is all the songs, with the exception of Caveland, are performed on the same background stage. I liked the other videos where they go to the beach and to other locations for their songs. The songs are as good as they get and my child adores this tape, so that's all that matters I guess. I only wish Leanne Halloran and her daughters would come back! It was great seeing them all grow-up from Dance Party through to Wiggly Wiggly World. Now they are gone forever and it makes me sad, even though my daughter does not notice, it is obvious without the Hallorans, The Wiggles are lacking much of their magic.
These songs are wonderful and follow the CD exactly except the Beach song is missing. I have all their CD's too and this one is the best along with Yummy Yummy. This is the only video that follows the CD closely. If you do not mind The Wiggles and the children dancers sitting around and occasionally waving their arms and wiggles their hips, instead of dancing, then this is a wonderful tape to own. The did skip something in thier artwork for this one though. Seeing that same stage on every song gets dull fast. The songs are so good you will be able to look past all the defects in this film and enjoy it, I promise you...",1034294400,7,1811,4.541284403669724

So needless to say ""Hoop-Dee-Doo"" was one of his first DVD's. Although it didn't have his favorite songs from older videos such as ""Fruit Salad"" and ""Rock a bye your bear"" he still became a fan of it and has pulled it out numerous times requesting to watch it. Although it doesn't follow the TV show version on this DVD, it is cute and the songs are catchy! So don't be surprised if you find yourself singing them around the house!

1677210,4,B00005YURN,"My first introduction of ""The Wiggles"" was a blurb of their show on the Disney channel when I was picking my son up from daycare.
I thought that it was very goofy and silly seeing grown men dance around and sing.
Now that we've bought this dvd, and I have watched it in it's entirity about fifty times, plus have seen my son's reactions and dancing, It is still goofy and silly but it's all in good fun. Like any party.
You party pooper reviewers out there, not every single thing you watch is all that educational for you! so why should everything your children watch be? If you really think about it there is a sense of education here. My son has learned to appreciate polka, rock, dance/pop music, and folk songs. This video helps them to appreciate music and also they learn that dancing is fun. Plus, younger children, like my son, don't really watch it that much and see those annoying patterns that many reviewers mentioned.
I am glad that two of these wiggly men are attractive, at least, much more attractive than Steve, of ""blues' clues"", which I have to watch every day as well.  Anthony & Greg totally rock!!!! And I think they all look like they are having a really good time.
Isn't that what all parties are supposed to be about?
If you are really concerned with visual patterns, this maybe a bad choice of video. Otherwise I recommend it for children between the ages of 1 1/2(like my son) and 7.  Most of the children in the video are between these ages, and they all look like they are having a good time.
This is a FUN video..It's pure entertainment....and we all like to be entertained from time to time..

I agree that the high production doesn't add much, and I also prefer to skip straight to the songs. The songs are just as compelling as other Wiggles material.  In fact, this volume is ideally suited to the DVD format.  Most times, I can skip the parts I don't like without my son even noticing.

My daughter already knows all the motions to Wiggle Hula and loves to have us sing this one to her.

There were kids dancing in almost all the segments which was nice - my son loved seeing them. As always the 4 Wiggles & their 3 animal friends & the Pirate were fabulous.....I think the Capt. is absolutely hilarious (antics & all). Overall, music wise this DVD is rather good (my son & I had no problem at all with the Aussie accent)....good for kids to know there are other races out there with different language pronounciations, etc.  General content-wise....slightly better for older children...put it on at night, make them dance like crazy & put them to bed exhausted!

7957129,2,B00005YURN,"Among movie roles, music-video cameos and court appearances, the Wiggles remain frustrating yet fascinating characters because it's obvious that they have decided to make their journey for self-discovery open to the world. Their personality seems split right down the middle -- one half collected and reflective, the other coiled and venomous, waiting (like the ""shining serpent"" contained within the meaning of their name to strike out at anything in their path.

The same group who are capable of poignant paeans to black women like ""Brenda's Got a Baby"" and ""Keep Ya Head Up"" is the next minute lickin' and chuckin in ""I Get Around"" of lickin' off shots at everyone from the cops to that jealous brutha down the block. Imagine Murray's debonair face screaming ""Thug Life,"" gat in hand, spliff in pocket, lashing out at a society that he blames for their rage and the impoverished condition of their people, often without looking at their own contribution to that misery. Women chasing men, nationalist revolutionaries, smoky-eyed thugs -- they have juggled all three roles, and as a result, their two previous albums, Wiglacalypse Now and Strictly 4 My Thugs, were plagued by convoluted thematics that proved distracting if you wanted to think about the ideas beyond the beats.

Most of the songs on Wiggles Hoop Dee Doo is their third and best album, demonstrate that underneath their hardened postures is a method. Sure, the thug life still hangs around them, remorseless and defiant, but for the first time since ""The Streetz R Deathrow"" and ""Papa'z Song,"" the Wiggles let the listener look at the roots of their anger. With less thuggin' clouding the picture, Wiggles examine some of the results of the gangsta lifestyle: paranoia, the promise of death and a combative relationship, with a higher, all-powerful authority.

Stylistically, ""If I Die 2 Nite"" is their most acrobatic turn at the mike since the Warren G-produced ""Definition of a Thug."" Producer extraordinaire Easy Mo Bee (Notorious B.I.G., Craig Mack) lays the beat low and thick while Wiggles' Murray drops his alliterative maxims: ""They say women and paper is poetry, power and pistols/Plottin' on murderin' peeps' fore they get you/Picturing pitiful punk dudes coppin' pleas/Puffin' weed as I position myself to clock Gs.... Been seeking psychotics/Society/Somebody save me/Addicted to drama so even Mama couldn't raise me."" Like their cohort B.I.G., the Wiggles ask if there is a special part of heaven reserved for castaway thugs who commit despicable deeds sometimes with the best of intentions.
