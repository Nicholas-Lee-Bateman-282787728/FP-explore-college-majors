8292430,4,B001DAVU96,"The title leads us to believer that the subject is Tim Eyman and his petition campaign ""battles,"" however, the real (and more important) subject is the political process, and role of citizens in a democracy.

Because Mr. Eyman appears to be very guarded while on camera, it is difficult to know with any depth, what is really going on for him.
We are left with depending on those who offer opinions about him. And these opinions vary widely.

I was confused by several comments, from his supporters, that a major reason for all the negative reactions to his campaigns was due to a ""liberal"" media.
This concept of the media being liberal is false.
Many reports have been made about the content of American media, and it has been found to be overwhelmingly conservative.

Perhaps, his supporters were unwilling to listen to reporters' reactions to Mr. Eyman's grandstanding, as well as his ignoring the costs and effects the campaigns would have on the running of the state, and of the resulting negative economic impact.

I had hoped this documentary would have given some financial assessment, to explain just exactly what was at state by dramatically cutting budgets.

I was shocked to see, scrolled up the screen, a list of some 30-plus types of state taxes.
The impacts of all these taxes most deeply hurt those with low income.
This is currently the only way all taxes must be gathered, because Washington State must pay for all functions and services without having an income-based tax.

While the documentary did not go beyond showing Mr Eyman explaining his campaigns, it prompted me to think that, rather than noodling around with this or that tax, the more basic element to change would be to create a far more fair, income-based tax, and, at the same time, to greatly reduce, or completely remove, the majority of the lesser taxes.

Tech stuff:
  4:3 format
  Decent photography -- very little shaky-cam -- although the camera's auto focus liked to be about 2 feet in back of many people.
  Excellent sound; everyone could be clearly heard.

That said, I don't like how the DVD protrayed all non-elected opposition to Tim Eyman as either bullies, farces or spendthrifts.  There is one state senator - Jacobsen - who I feel was protrayed sparingly but fairly.  There is some intellectual opposition and genuine concerns about how Eyman's antics thru direct democracy are anywhere from incomplete (my view) to horrendous and a sequel showing how Eyman's initiatives have resulted in cutbacks wouldn't be so bad.

Just like Tim Eyman, ""The Battles of Tim Eyman"" is noncomprehensive but enlightening as to a point-of-view.  I would get the DVD just for the history alone.",1317427200,,784,4.992307692307692
