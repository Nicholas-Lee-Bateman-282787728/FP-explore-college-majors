8133547,1,B000GNOHE6,"i just found this dvd annoying. The music attempts to evoke the feeling of a young trendy viewer, although the narrator sounds like Robin Leach. Most of the suggestions, boutique and hotel- wise are for tourists with 'beaucoup bucks' to spend, not very practical! This guide shows more of the inside of premises' than the outdoor scenery, and left me feeling empty. It does give you a nice 2-minute glimpse of the canal, street and park views but not nearly enough.",1313712000,,465,4.753086419753086
8133548,1,B000GNOHE6,"I just got done watching ""In The City"" Amsterdam. I rented it along with in the city Berlin. First off you have to go threw several menus and click on each sub group. Each sub group is about two - four mintues long. If you could watch the dvd start to finish it may be enjoyable. There is just to much hassle to watch this travel video. The tag for this dvd series ""For the traveler that likes to go off the beaten path"" There is nothing new in this video and you learn no inside secrets. It seems like they got a copy of Frommers and film the sites in the book. Oh Yeah for the college age type you will not learn anything Wink Wink about Coffehouses!",1162944000,,652,4.062015503875969
