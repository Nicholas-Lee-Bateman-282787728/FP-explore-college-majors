636236,5,6303383335,We saw this at the cinema when it was released and it has remained one of our favorites. It was great to see it again if only in our living room.,1473638400,,145,3.7096774193548385
636237,5,6303383335,"I love this movie. Odd, quirky. It's the opposite of an action film. It's an inaction film. A slow down and savor. I saw it in the theater when it came out and it is better on the big screen, but it works better than I thought on the small screen.",1464134400,2,247,3.8627450980392157

636241,5,6303383335,"I had to watch this movie for one of my classes. In the very beginning I thought it was going to be a another boring movie, but as I kept watching it I fell in love with it. This movie is awesome.",1445644800,,196,3.6904761904761907
636242,5,6303383335,Great film,1435968000,,10,4.5
636243,5,6303383335,"A great movie for all that can appreciate European/French/Italian movies with a very unusual plot! If your recipe for a great movie is a film that follows a somewhat clear story, including some standard ingredients, look elsewhere though. This is very different from Holywood drama and is best suited for cineasts who have found works from other Italian (and French) directors great.

If you happen to know Italian, it is even much better, as the original dialogue is hilarious sometimes. Especially when Nanni Moretti meets with Jennifer Beals and her husband on a street in Rome. Maybe that's my only negative with this version - the subtitles miss a few great points in the movie, but not to the extent that it's not fully enjoyable.",1430352000,4,736,4.888
636244,1,6303383335,Awful. Did not even watch the whole movie. I would even ask for a refund.,1424390400,,73,3.933333333333333

636286,5,6303383335,"Excellent film. Very good acting, diction and superb views of Rome and the islands off the coast of ITALY. The Orange on Stromboli was a sight to behold. I enjoyed the film VERY much, saw it twice.",1403568000,,197,4.351351351351352
636287,3,6303383335,"Great for scenery of Italy - I can see why they compare the director to Woody Allen, he complains. But he is not as funny or annoying as Woody Allen.  The scenery and the chance to see some small mediterranean islands up close is worth it.",1398902400,,239,4.195652173913044
636288,5,6303383335,"This is so difficult to find this film in NTSC format that I took it even though it's a Korean import. And there is no disappointment, despite the relative weirdness of have a Korean DVD import of an Italian film with English subtitles.",1394236800,2,236,4.511627906976744
636289,5,6303383335,Great movie. Always looking for Italian movies for my partner.  She really enjoyed it and it helps her practice her second language.,1388966400,,132,5.0
636290,5,6303383335,"A wry look at life, Italy in the 90's, and common human situations from one of Italy's best filmmakers.  Nanni is a lovable nebbish. Sit back and enjoy.",1359504000,,152,4.428571428571429
636291,4,6303383335,Sopratutto questo e' un bel film. Ci sono alcuni momenti in cui e' noioso e sembra che non ci sia una propria trama. Gli altri parti pero sono comici ed interessanti. Mi ha dato un po' fastidio i sottotitoli ma non ci posso fare nulla.,1351468800,,235,4.2444444444444445
636292,5,6303383335,"What a great film!  Without the benefit of reading any reviews ahead of viewing the film it might be perceived as somewhat odd, but I cannot speak highly enough about this wonderful film.  I now love Nanni Moretti and want to see everything he has done.  His sense of humor and joy are so refreshing.  If you need a 'feel good' movie, look no further.",1233446400,,351,4.3538461538461535
636293,5,6303383335,"Absolutely criminal that this, along with other Nanni Moretti films, are not available on dvd here in the states.  This is an absolute stunning piece of work, one that I cannot get tired of watching, no matter how many times I view it.  As an avid Vespa and Lambretta collector myself, I am a bit biased as well.  But, that aside, it's fantastic and has the proverbial Moretti mark throughout.  The scene with Jennifer Beals is priceless and worthy of whatever you have to do to see it.

Stupid studio execs, put this out on dvd today...along with the complete Moretti filmography as well.",1134864000,5,589,4.625
636294,5,6303383335,"This is one of my favorite movies -- a joy to watch repeatedly, especially the opening scenes riding through Rome on his Vespa and his hysterical take on families dominated by their children.",1128124800,10,191,4.818181818181818
636295,5,6303383335,"By the end of this movie, in a very particular, specific moment, I think I finally understood, for the first time, what making movies is all about, what movies are for.

Just don't expect explosions (although there are plenty of them) or street chases (um, there's a long one, too) ;-)",1121644800,8,285,4.588235294117647
636336,5,6303383335,"I've watched parts of this movie at least a dozen times: Moretti watching the dancers, running into Jennifer Beals, riding his scooter by fine Roman apartment buildings, pretending to be a director of a musical about a 1950s Trotskyist pastry chef, and, finally--I don't know how he makes such an everyday act so memorable--drinking a glass of water. Something incredibly human about it all.",1105920000,5,391,5.125
636337,4,6303383335,"This is one of my all time favorites!  Not only does it show some beautiful scenery throughout Italy, but the comedy is quite funny.  It's a great family movie!",1095379200,,160,4.482758620689655
636338,5,6303383335,"There are so many things that make this movie great, but to me two things stand out. The melancholy scene of the Siremar ferry passing behind Nanni on the island of Stromboli that foreshadows his bout with cancer in the third act. And the redemptive and glorious act of drinking a simple glass of water. If you don't want to buy a Vespa after seeing this movie you have no soul.",1010361600,9,378,4.338028169014085
636339,5,6303383335,"Even if youv'e never been to Roma or Stromboli and you don't know who Silvana Mangaro is. Indulge in this story of life and comedy and then if you still don't like it, book a trip to Italy and you will be hooked.",1007078400,2,212,3.953488372093023
636340,3,6303383335,"Italian cult director Nanni Moretti's film is in 3 parts, all narrated by his diary entries. In ""On My Vespa"", a tracking camera follows him as he rides around Romeon on his scooter, meeting Jennifer Beals (what a feeling!) and visiting the bleak site of Pasolini's murder. This episode is notable for the great shots of apartments, Beals' radiance and Moretti's funny encounter with a film critic who has praised Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer. In ""Islands"", Moretti travels with his friend Gerardo, visiting Lipari, Salina, Aliandi, and the primal Stromboli. ""Islands"" features the black sands and smoking volcano of Stromboli, a flowering cactus, a donkey, and Gerardo fleeing from Aliandi because it has no TV. In ""Doctors"", a cure for an itch leads to something more serious undetected because of medical incompetence. This last episode is the most entertaining, in spite of the theme, because it presents a narrative, whilst the first 2 are in a more random documentary style. However, one's patience is severely tested by the characters of ""Islands"", and the audience fighting exhaustion by the last one. Moretti tends to hold the camera too long on his subjects and the quirkiness wears thin. Both ""Islands"" and ""Doctors"" feature the sad, lovely music of Nicola Piovani.",992563200,4,1282,5.109523809523809
636341,5,6303383335,"This movie is a joy. Rome looks beautiful from the back of Moretti's vespa and the scenes on the southern islands and in the mountains are stunning. Moretti's observations on popular culture, modern medicine and politics are dry and very funny. And there are episodes of lighter humour, like the infuriating but delightful children who jam the public phone system and the encounter with the American tourists who provide 'Bold and the Beautiful' updates to Moretti's soap opera-obsessed companion. Many images from Caro Diairio linger in the memory and it is a movie which will pass the test of time.",982022400,3,600,5.01
636342,5,6303383335,"When I watched this movie for the second time a few days ago, having first seen it two years ago, I remembered how I had instantly fallen in love with it the first time that I saw it. After I first saw the film, I couldn't remember the name of it but fortuneately an Italian friend reminded me of it a few weeks ago.  This film's soundtrack is unforgetable and the cinematopgraphy is outstanding. His personal ""Odyseey"" through the Italian islands and his funny, yet poignant, drive through Rome and the countryside on his Vespa come to life through Moretti.  Thid film whisks away the viewer on a deeply poignant and comic personal journey. I love the part when he joins in the dancing and then sways from side to side on his Vespa while listening to Khaled's Didi. By the way, one reviewer asked about the music from the dance scene- the name of the song is ""Visa para un Sueno"" by Dominican superstar Juan Luis Guerra. It is available on his '440' album. Juan Luis Guerra is one of my favorite musical artists, along with Khaled. Any film that has their songs back to back in a soundtrack (something I didn't think possible!)was clearly tailor made for me, but everyone can relate to this film and find meaning in it. The piano interlude and scenery during his journey to the slain Italian director's momument is haunting. Highly recommended.",982022400,11,1345,4.6

636344,5,6303383335,I think this movie surpasses my all time favourite - Unbearable Lightness of Being - because it is so wonderfull to watch AND listen to. The scenes  where Nanni wanders are sublime - the music is the best and I managed to  buy most of it from various sources - eg. the music playing when he is  looking for the monument to the slain Passini is by Keith Jarrett - the  Koln Concert on ECM - BUT what is that great music being played when all  those people are dancing and Nanni joins in? The scene in the sandwhich  shop with Nanni mimmicking the singer on the TV is hilarious - my new  favourite movie. Try the Hairdresser's Husband - same feeling!,966556800,2,648,4.262295081967213
636345,5,6303383335,"A MUST SEE. BUT. THAT PIANO PIECE. THE ONE WHEN HE'S RIDING HIS VESPA TO  THE SITE WHERE ITALIAN FILM DIRECTOR PASOLINI WAS MURDERED. ITS PLAYING IN  THE BACKROUND. WHO DID THAT? TRULY ONLY A GOD COULD PLAY LIKE THAT. SEE THE  MOVIE JUST FOR THAT, YOU WONT BE SORRY. ENJOY THE REST WHILE YOUR AT IT.

7845127,5,6303383335,Good movie,1502928000,,10,4.5
7845128,4,6303383335,"If you only enjoy movies with a strong plot line, this is not the film for you. As the title suggests, it is presented as entries from Moretti's diary, and so has a rambling, meditative tone like a diary might. I found it a bit slow, but ultimately rather charming. It is divided into three parts. The first consists of the director's reflections on himself (how he wishes he could dance, etc.) and Rome, as he drives around the non touristy neighborhoods on his Vespa in summer, when most people are away on vacation. The second part shows him and a friend visiting the Aeolian Islands in search of peace and quiet so they can concentrate on their respective projects. They reflect on the foibles of the locals, and are revealed to have foibles of their own. In the final part, he is back in Rome going from doctor to doctor in a seemingly endless search for a cure for a persistent itch. I liked the scenery and the insight into some neighborhoods in Rome, but found third part a little less interesting; it's mostly a chronicle of all the bizarre and unhelpful prescriptions he received. I'm glad I watched it, though; it has a certain charm. It is a good movie for people who are learning Italian, because Moretti speaks quite clearly and slowly. The voice-over and much of the dialogue are easy to understand, though unfortunately the English subtitles can't be turned off.",1499385600,,1378,4.628571428571429
7845129,5,6303383335,"For anyone who has ever lived in Rome, ""Caro Diario""Dear Diaryis -da non mancare- not to be missed!

In the unforgettable opening scenes, Moretti conveys us via motorino up via Dandolopast graciously sprawling 1920's housesand Viale XXX Aprileunder the dappled shade of tall plane trees to Monteverde Vecchio (where he lives, incidentally). Seeing Monteverde through Moretti's eyes is surely the next best thing to being there!

Throughout the film, which portrays not only a thin slice of the Moretti's life as filmmaker, but also a critique of Italian cinema of the 80s, we are treated to Moretti's quirky sense of humor. In one of my favourite scenes, he complains about the static tendency of Italian films to portray its protagonists perpetually lamenting, in monotones, that time is passing, that they are getting older and  there is nothing to be done about it. In his imagination, Moretti ends up assaulting the putative filmmaker for his lack of imagination and innovation.

The signature of ""Caro Diario"" is imagination. Part two, in which Moretti and a writer-friend try to get away from the magnificent chaos of Rome and begin 'island hopping' in the Aeolian Islands, they discover that because of television there is no such thing as 'away'.  The remote isles of Lipari, Salina, Volcano, and Stromboli have their own annoyances (as when they arrive in lonely Salina, only to be invited by a swinger in flashy sunglasses to Una Festa di Cattivo Gustoa Festival of Bad Taste).

Part three, which turns serious, nevertheless, retains the charm of the film, which is to surprise and delight the viewer, who is partaking in a film that is truly and thoughtfully innovative.",1495324800,,1681,5.050541516245487
7845130,1,6303383335,"Boring, shallow, ugly to look at, awkward scripted performances of people trying to be natural, not interesting nor amusing in any way.",1484352000,,135,5.181818181818182
7845131,5,6303383335,"This movie is narrated in voice-over, as if while writing in a diary -- alternating with dramatized scenes.  It starts as a travelogue (first of wonderful neighborhoods around Rome, then of islands off the southwest coast of Italy) and soon gets a bit surreal and humorous.  The last section details a series of visits to dermatologists, who never really paid attention and failed one after another to diagnose a serious illness.  I won't tell you the ending, but it was satisfying!  I can see why this is a prize-winning film -- the narrative structure and style are super interesting, and Nanni Moretti is always great.",1482883200,,621,4.885714285714286
7845132,5,6303383335,"Funny, interesting, incisive look at society. Probably applies worldwide, not just to Italy. I enjoyed watching it.",1480291200,,115,5.823529411764706
7845133,4,6303383335,"Great and glorious Italian humor: following the idea that only in Italy could a Fellini become a ""documentary"" filmmaker, Moretti documents to his diary his wonderful and eccentric views of what is a marvelous and only somewhat eccentric culture. From Rome to Stromboli, his humor seethes with volcanic possibilities.  Five stars were impossible when the last piece on medicine became predictable and too repetitious.",1476921600,,417,5.515625
