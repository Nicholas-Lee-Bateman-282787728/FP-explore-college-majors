3868666,4,B0027UY88G,"In the interest of full disclosure, I should preface my review by saying that I watched this film on pay-per-view cable, not Blu-ray. Nevertheless, I found this to be a solid and compelling WW2 drama. As a WW2 ""buff"" I am a bit embarassed to say that I know virtually nothing about the German occupation of Denmark, or that country in general for that matter. This is the true story of the Danish resistance movement, but more specifically the legendary figures of Flame and Citron; two friends who reach the status of underground heroes for their brazen assassinations of German occupiers and Danish collaborators alike. Flame in particular, the soft-spoken, sharp-dressing 23 year-old, manages to become the most hunted man in Denmark. The film is a bit slow and drawn out, but I found it quite suspenseful as the men navigate the treacherous underworld of partisans and Gestapo spies. Friends turn out to be foes, and vice versa, and what spy thriller would be complete without the perfidious seductress who entices our heroic protagonist to his own downfall? The acting and script struck me as most excellent and the cinematography, while simple, was well done also. The brief shots of the Danish countryside were quite lovely, while the majority of the film takes place in the dreary, uniformly gray mass of downtown Copenhagen. This sets a very somber mood for the film. The film is in Danish and German with English subtitles. 4 stars.",1251504000,40,1442,4.913934426229508
3868667,3,B0027UY88G,"The start is painfully slow and the dialogue hard to comprehend even to those who understand Danish (due to actors mumbling similar to recent trend in Hollywood!) but the story gains momentum as the 2 Hours ++ movie moves on. It ends up a very decent movie that shows well the situation in the Danish underground movement during 2nd world war, the risks they take and the often unclear and conflicting objectives among the influencial parties in the resistance.

Some have personal motives, financial or otherwise, and others various motivations to resist the Nazi occupation and all are only united in their wish to overturn the Germans and free Denmark. Not much unlike the resistance in other more current occupied territories be it Palestine, Iraq or Afghanistan.

The actors deliver good performances (not withstanding their mumbling which non Danes are luckily spared) even though highly acclaimed Mads Mikkelsen (James Bond and various other International movies) once again plays his character the same way he seems to play most of his characters - with little facial expression - short mumbling lines in a seeming aim to look tough and slightly troubled.

But all in all a very decent movie closer to 4 than 2 stars",1250380800,9,1224,4.990196078431373

3868671,4,B0027UY88G,"Ole Christian Madsen, the Danish director of the exquisitely shot, exciting World War II film Flame & Citron, knows his Hollywood.

Set in Nazi-occupied Copenhagen during the final years of the war, Flame is a terrific, if sometimes monotonous, real-life thriller about two members of the Holger Danske resistance movement whose heroism earned them each a posthumous Medal of Honor.

With its moody, noir lighting and poetic voice-over, Flame rehearses virtually every element of the classic genre piece: violence, sex and romance, gunplay, spies, betrayals, a femme fatale, and a murderous Gestapo officer.

Madsen also has a good ear for melancholy. He balances the whizzing bullets and political intrigue with an elegiac tone and an existential edge just this side of nihilism.

Imagine Spielberg on a Nietzschean bender.

Flame opens with grainy newsreel footage of German soldiers entering the Danish capital. ""Do you remember when they arrived?"" Flame (Thure Lindhardt) asks in the voice-over. He's trying to explain why he does what he does for the resistance.

Soon we see what Flame and his friend Citron (brilliantly played by Quantum of Solace's Mads Mikkelsen) do. They assassinate Danish Nazis. Flame is so good at his job, the Gestapo has put a hefty reward on his head. He's a star.

""I know I'm doing the right thing,"" he says in the voice-over. ""It's the only right thing.""

That belief is bolstered by a bureaucratic machinery that legitimizes the killing: The duo are given kill assignments by a lawyer, Aksel (Peter Mygind), who in turn answers to the British Army and a set of Danish political bosses in exile in Sweden.

Yet, as the film progresses, we're hit by a series of uncomfortable questions about the morality of war and the meaning of heroism.

Are the assassins justified if they're ordered to kill someone the political bosses don't like? What if they accidentally hurt a civilian?

The situation spirals out of control when Flame falls for the beautiful resistance spy Ketty (Stine Stengade). Soon, he's investigating her as a possible double agent.

By the end, his work becomes harder - though not impossible - to justify.

Flame has some rough, tedious patches - at 130 minutes, it's simply too long. And its reiteration of Hollywood cliches isn't always successful.

Regardless, it is, along with Paul Verhoeven's Black Book, one of the most accomplished films to come out of the recent wave of neoclassic and revisionist WWII films, which includes the equally boring American and German versions of Valkyrie, In Tranzit, and Defiance.",1479772800,,2573,5.095238095238095

There were some moments that left me wondering if the two men were lovers (cha ching). If the real  Flammen and Citronen were that good together, it would be hard to believe they weren't.

The premise for this was really intriguing. Not gonna lie, I love stories that are filmed beautifully, from the principal actors to the scenery the entire thing is gorgeously presented -- which makes it all the more haunting in how desperate and devastating this noir work is. Beauty, counterpointed by tragedy. It also had the added benefit of introducing me to a slice of history that doesn't get discussed in America, such as other countries outside of England, France and Germany who were affected by the Nazi regime. I love foreign films, so subtitles don't bother me, but if you're one of those people who can't be bothered if everything isn't Americanized for you, just don't.

This film was enlightening and frightening. This was a chapter in history that I never knew and it is sad and amazing. The performances of the support cast...wow. Mads Mikkelsen as Citron is brooding and so very serious. My biggest kudos go to Thure Lindhardt as Flame. Not only did he nail this as he does every part he has ever done and which I recommend every movie he has ever done and they are, to name a few, Keep the Lights On, Angels And Demons, TV-The Borgias, Fast and Furious #6, The Brotherhood and Love In Thoughts.

Dramatically, I was drawn in immediately and rivetted to my seat the for the duration of the movie.  What impressed me the most about this movie is summed up in one word: restraint.  The viewer can feel the intensity of emotions desperately seeking release, explosively, in the characters.  And yet the protagonists impose a discipline, a professionalism on themselves-- which competes and sometimes loses to zeal.  I especially liked the paradox of Flame and Citron. Each of the partners were a paradox unto themselves.  Of all the characters in the movie, Flame, the image of fierce intensity, the sharp end of the spear, outwardly was the coolest of them all.  The fact that the story was based on real people who performed real acts and suffered real consequences gives the film orders of magnitude more resonance, for me.  I cannot say enough about the entire production.  The look, the sound, the cinematography, the costume design--all magnificent.

3868722,4,B0027UY88G,"This film (English subtitles) covers the exploits of two young men who were part of a group of Danes resisting German occupation of Denmark by, primarily, killing Danish collaborators, and sometimes branching out to assassinate Germans.  As in all wars, the innocent suffered, both from assassination operations and from German retaliation.  As the group continued to operate, the question arose, and bedeviled especially Citron, whether the leader of the resistance group, allegedly getting instructions from the British, was targeting Danes  who were aware of his business dealings with the enemy.  In addition, someone within the group appeared to be assisting German authorities in exposing group members; the Germans had posted a substantial and ever-increasing reward for Flame, the most notorious of the group.  As might have been anticipated, Flame and Citron came to a bad end.  Perhaps as a consolation, both were posthumously awarded medals.  The traitor apparently received the German bounty for Flame's capture and enjoyed a long and peaceful life after the war.

The film was well acted and one got a sense of the humanity of the main characters, motivations and flaws included.  If one is looking for an uplifting film where good triumphs over evil, skip Flame y Citron.  However, if one wants to view aspects of life in an occupied country, it probably hits the mark.

3868729,5,B0027UY88G,"This is the first Danish movie I've seen, and rates as one of the most powerful in any language. The deep, closer-than-brothers bond between the two men, Citron and Flame, would've been a tremendous challenge for any two actors, and Lindhart and Mikkelson pulled it off beautifully.

I use the word 'beautiful' a great deal when describing this film, with reason.

I've read many criticisms of this film and it seems to me that many of the critics like to focus on what they perceive as the moral ambiguity pervading the film, its supposed nuanced shades of gray in a genre notorious for its stark and strictly binary Good versus Evil storylines. Sorry, but I don't see the ambiguity others have discerned. Historically, neither Citron nor Flame had any problems whatsoever shooting Nazis and collaborators. Neither would I. And neither, I think, would most moral people with the nerve and the courage to take up that kind of bloody but necessary work. I happen to think the subplot involving the assassination of supposed innocents was made up by the director and the screenwriter since I could find no supporting documentation showing that the two men were deliberately misled on the nature of their targets.

Historical discrepancies aside, the two actors portraying Citron and Flame deserve all the accolades they've received for their respective roles. To play Flame, Thure Lindhardt embraced an almost surreal calm, a coolness under pressure that showed without telling why his character was so good at what he did. It grieves me a little in a way that Mads Mikkelson, arguably one of the greatest living actors in any language, has become somewhat typecast as a villain in television and movies. I mean, I'm sure it's good for his career but--based solely the range of his performance in Citron and Flame--Mikkelson could play any character anywhere in anything and do it better than anyone. And then, of course, there's Stine Stengade playing the double/triple agent femme fatale, Ketty Selmer. That character could very easily have devolved into cliched cartoon with a lesser talent, but Stengade brought depth to that role, gave Ketty Selmer a level of complexity that almost made her character sympathetic. Almost.

As a last observation, I've fallen in love with the sounds of the Danish language. I've never heard it before, at least not at length, and had no idea that any Germanic language could sound so....I don't know. Melodic maybe?

It asks the question ""is their something in your life that you are willing to fight and even die for, some higher purpose?"" Many of the characters were doing their best to ensure their own survival or the survival of their nation, comprimise, betrayal, greed, fear, revenge, justice, and love for country are all on display here.

These men were recognized for their efforts after the war ended.  In the interest of not including any spoilers in this review, I don't want to say more.

I was so interesting to see WWII through the eyes of another country other than the U.S.  I was intrigued by the emotion and dedication these characters had.  You can't help but admire how passionately they fought for what they thought was right.  Mads Mikkelsen as Citron was magnificent.  I was so drawn into this inner struggle that I almost lost sight of the greater theme of the movie.  Citron struggles internally with the violent acts he has to see/commit. And, you can see through Mikkelsen's dynamic face and mannerisms how badly Citron yearns to be the good man his family wants, but also the soldier is nation needs.

As other reviews have noted, the characters are not without flaws, and dutifully employed by the actors; Flame particularly crackling, brooding, intense, with the increasingly popular Mads Mikkelsen as his supporting, conflicted, disaffected partner. Key moments in the film are punctuated with dramatic camerawork and snappy timing in the edits; time was clearly spent refining the film, not exhibiting any of the rush-job Hollywood-ism happening stateside. The conflict in Denmark is well-lit here, depicting the split in Nazi reception and the double-agency of taking sides. The history is delivered in a rich, exciting package, with characters which are complex and sympathetic. My only blip if I had to take issue with something, was some truly unbelievable plot concoctions in the later portion of the film. Don't get me wrong; the ""fireworks"" are impressively done here and only add to the high drama-high action one-two-punch this film's certainly got in its wheelhouse.

In general the movie is about Danish patriots killing Germans, without regard for the consequences, i.e., the reprisals by the Wehrmacht or Gestapo who gun down a dozen innocent civilians to avenge the murder of a German officer.  Further lack of realism is provided by Stine Stengard who plays the double timing seductress/spy.  The best actor in the movie is Mads Mikelsen (Citron) although the director strives to make Flame the hero of the scenario.

Overall fairly entertaining, definitely not worth watching more than twice.  The best part is the respect the Chief Gestapo officer offers to the remains of our unfortunate heroes.",1375660800,,718,5.0508474576271185

The Danish Language is so beautifully delivered by all the actors,
The Subtitles act like a guide for a concert musician instead of words translated.

 Both Bent and Jrgenknown, posthumously, were awared US Medal for their heroism by President Harry Truman

But despite some plot complications--most of them demonstrating the untrustworthiness of all those whom Flamme and Citronen deal with, except for each other--this movie is mostly a monotonous sequence of brutal acts of extreme violence, of shootings with guns.

3868808,5,B0027UY88G,"This was an excellent film through and through! ""Flammen & Citronen"" (""Flame and Citron"") from 2008 and directed by Ole Christian Madsen, was set in Nazi-occupied Denmark between, April 1940 - October 1944. It tells the story (based on actual events), of two legendary Danish resistance fighters: 'Flammen' (Thure Lindhart) and 'Citronen' (Mads Mikkelsen from ""After the Wedding""), who were no longer certain of the point and purpose of their mission. This film was very honest in its depiction of the brutality of war, but without the glorification of the actions of one side versus the other side. Here the brutality is depicted by both sides (that's unbiased honesty), and it showed us that the so-called enemy wasn't so easy to discern (sometimes they came from your side), like many of the Hollywood-war films would like you to believe! Here loyalties were questioned and tested, as to who can really be trusted during chaotic times like these (even love was tainted). I give the director a lot of credit for having the courage to show, that even the head of the Gestapo in Denmark 'Hoffmann' (Christian Berkel), (one of the characters called him the greatest mass murderer in Denmark), was not a stereotypical embodiment of evil (he actually respected his adversaries, especially 'Flammen'). All in all, this was an excellent film depicting war for what it really is, a hoax and a crime! There are no heroes and winners when humankind is stripped of all humanity for the sake of national pride, or any ideology that condones war and murder!! The entire cast in the film were absolutely fantastic. This is once again proof, that only non-Americans (I have yet to see a film made here to make me think otherwise, with the exception of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece ""Apocalypse Now"" 1979 and Brian de Palma's recent ""Redacted"" 2007), can make films approaching a discourse that's closer to the truth of the matter.

3868826,4,B0027UY88G,"The facts are that these flame and citron existed and killed people. They really took it out there and they remind me of how bloody the eastern countries resistance movements were, like in poland and yugoslavia.  They are Danish national heroes and they deserve to be. The movie on blu ray looks great and it's subtitled in english. The movie is well done and has a start and ending point which helps in any movie.  It uses first person narration from Flame to explain who is what and what is going on which is fine too.  The story is based on facts and it has them take down several people but it is all taking place in the last part of their story mainly. When they are used by a bad leader and then go on to anger their leadership in Stockholm.  The movie tries to hard to place todays sense of morality into those times.  People were not torn as much by war. You killed people , they died, if you made mistakes you had to just accept it.  The feeling that the real flame and citron were tormented even if they killed the wrong people is probably wrong too. They probably were not happy about it but it was understood by people of the  past that you had to keep it to yourself when in wartime.  There were at least 64 members of flames and citrons group who died during the struggle. Both men engaged in bombings too. So It's probably right to say that this is loosely based on them because the ending is probably some 21st century fabrication. (betrayals etc)
Although their final fate isn't in doubt , this movie isn't probably on the level. I wish that movies wouldn't interject todays moralities and antiwar sentiments onto the past. But this is still a good movie because you get a feel for the desperation of resistance fighters who most likely will not survive the war.",1276387200,,1779,4.386018237082067
3868827,5,B0027UY88G,"Ole Christian Madsen's ""Flame and Citron"" equals, to my mind, Melville's mind numbingly powerful ""Army of Shadows""--something I had not honestly anticipated.

Flame (Bent Faurschou-Hviid) and Citron (Jrgen Haagen Schmith) were the action heroes of Denmark's Resistance to the Nazi Regime and having read about the two of them it is not too hard to understand why.  Infamous for doing what most were both reluctant and terrified to do (actually shooting German soldiers and members of the SS in the street), it seems that it is less the effectiveness of the two men than their bravado and sheer physical courage which is so venerated.  Though in the movie it is haphazardly implied that each had a plan for escape, these plans could have only been very vague. People were tortured and hung for a fraction of what they did and they managed to pull it off for two years. Both were killed in precisely the ways the film depicts in 1944. None other than President Harry Hiroshima Truman presented Flame with a very posthumous Medal of Freedom in 1951.

These two heroic and also terrifying individuals are played brilliantly by Thure Lindhardt (Flame, looking every bit Dostoevsky's Raskolnikvov) and Mads Mikkelsen (Citron, the actor's performance as this man tortured by his responsibilities to his family and his unwavering commitment to the Resistance is so powerful as to be frightening at times) are caught in a wretched web of lies and deception no more romantic than a Gothic novelist's version of Fabio going mad.

While we are given very little insight in the past of these two, it is obvious that Citron has something to prove about his manhood (the scene in which he tries to reconcile himself with his wife goes to show exactly how the impulse toward violence, however nobly conceived, indelibly stains the human psyche) and that Flame has paternal issues which often disable him from executing authoritative members of the Gestapo who see his youthful weakness and exploit it.

The irony is that their superiors talk about ""liquidation"" in precisely the same terms the Third Reich talked about ""liquidation"" in terms of massacring Jews.  Madsen's obvious point is driven home with ruthless clarity: at what point does the righteous revolutionary become as bad as the tyrants they rabidly pursue?  Why did these two take little interest in sabotage, perhaps hiding Jews or saving them? The answer may be that since they had no foreknowledge of the Allies winning the war they saw what they were doing as the only possible means: getting rid of the German army and all collaborators one by one before they take over the world?  That is far too simple, and the answer is infinitely more complex and ominous.

That old edict, ""violence begets violence"", is in the end a truth they learn far too late.  The twist in the film which reveals that they have been badly misguided as to who they have been assassinating and leaves nothing for them but horrendous guilt and yet a determination to act on their own.  It seemed pretty obvious to me who was betraying them from the moment the person was introduced into the film, but Flame probably figured he wanted to live as a normal man and not just an assassin at least in one area of his life.  Whatever one's quabbles about their methods, one cannot help but admire the way they go out, just as they lived.  A movie which is a meditation on conscience in a time where right and wrong were discarded like cheap deck of Uno cards.  A masterpiece.",1274659200,10,3495,4.801666666666667
3868828,4,B0027UY88G,"FLAMMEN & CITRONEN (FLAME AND CITRON) is a dark long film that will prove to enlighten many about another aspect of WW II we know very little.  Written (with Lars Andersen) and directed by Ole Christian Madsen it unfolds a true story about two 'heroes' of the Holger Danske resistance moment, a large group of Danish citizens who fought to kill not only the Nazi invaders but also the Danish supporters of Hitler's movement: the heroes are Flame (Thure Lindhardt) and Citron (Mads Mikkelsen) and the course of their lives is traced with brilliant use of sound, cinematography, a pervading darkness which serves the story well, and attention to minute details that makes the viewer almost involuntarily involved with their mission, their plight and the final results of their work.

In addition to the outstanding performances of Lindhardt and Mikkelsen, there are excellent performances by Christian Berkel as Hoffman, leader of the Gestapo, Stine Stengade as the puzzling spy/counterspy/ love interest Ketty Selmer, and a cast of bit players that remain in mind's eye long after the film is over.  Though produced as an epic (and the film is a very very long 130 minutes!) the interaction between the lead characters is clearly defined and they come across as credible resistance fighters whose plight is always one of duress and fear.

As in all stories about war that are honest, there is no clear line between right and wrong, between survival and heroism, and it is to Madsen's credit that he keeps us in the shadows with every encounter.  War is war and it alters everyone who is touched by it.  Grady Harp, May 10",1274572800,2,1620,4.872727272727273

My father had a small Fiat and a gasoline ration at the start of the war because he was a physician, and made house calls, but the ration soon disappeared. I would think a Dane driving around in a car would be subject to constant checks. Trucks with Norwegian drivers were not unusual, but cars, other than official ones, were not. Then there were all the shootings. The Norwegian resistance (in which my father played an active role,) tried to avoid acts which might trigger too much attention or retaliation against civilians. I can't believe the Danish resistance acted differently. This was like a ""Bonnie and Clyde"" movie, in which the resistance members ride into town, hold up the town's only bank,shoot and kill a dozen people, and ride out again, as if there were no marshall or deputies to be concerned about.",1272326400,17,1006,4.721590909090909

The movie can be viewed in Danish, or German with English subtitles.
So on to the movie.
Despite growing up in Europe, and having an interest in WWII both historically, and in film, I was somewhat ashamed to admit that I knew virtually nothing about the impact of that conflict on countries like Denmark, it always seemed to be just rolled in to a more overview of the annexing of most of Europe at the time.
Flame and Citron (based on true events) is a stark, but visually compelling deep, deep drama that manages to be entertaining and informative at the same time.
Don't expect wall to wall action, this is more of a smoldering story that even feels like it plods in places, but the tension and drama feel real, even stifling at times.
Thure Lindhardt (Many may remember him as the Swiss Guard who gets locked in the vault with Tom Hanks in Angels and Demons) is outstanding playing the 23 year old, fiery red headed Flammen (Flame). He's idealistic, energetic and driven by his love for ""Mother Country"" to kill the enemy at all costs, but also introspective enough to know he's living on borrowed time, and that the orders he carries out make him at times question his conscience.
Mads Mikkelsen (Casino Royale, Clash of the Titans) plays the older Citronen (Citron) , estranged from his wife and child, and so weighed down with the weight of the German occupation, and his resistance dealings, he always seems weary, unkempt, and deeply depressed throughout the movie.
Both actors (and indeed the whole cast) are excellent.
At a little over 2 hours, some may find it a little to slow and long, but I enjoyed it thoroughly.
Although dark in it's depiction of a struggling people under the boot of the Nazi war machine, with local people turning traitors, spies and double agents, betrayal and murder. The film has a personal feel to it. The violence is never stylized or gratuitous, and the strong human story of love and death is well depicted throughout.
As a movie going people we need to get over our avoidance of foreign language films, the popular cry of ""I'm not paying to READ a movie"" is small minded and means that movies like this invariably go straight to DVD, or only get limited releases in theaters, and that's a shame.

If you like spy thrillers, drama's or have an interest in WWII movies, this is certainly worth a look. 4 stars",1270166400,4,2696,4.593360995850622
3868832,4,B0027UY88G,"""Flame and Citron"" were the code names of a 2-man team of assassins who worked for the Danish resistance Holger Danske group during World War II. Their real names were Bent Faurschou-Hviid and Jorgen Haagen Schmith. The film takes place primarily in Copenhagen 1944, when the duo targeted Danish collaborators and Danish Nazis. Bent was usually the gunman and Jorgen the driver. Bent (Thure Lindhardt) is a 23-year-old educated and affluent idealist who has chosen to live under an assumed identity, in a basement, and kill people for his country. Jorgen (Mads Mikkelsen) is 10 years older, living on alcohol and pills, growing ever more distant from his wife and young daughter.

Flame and Citron go about killing people as if it were everyday business, which it has become for them. They pick up their orders from Aksel Winther (Peter Mygind), go shoot people in the head, and go back into hiding until the next hit list is prepared. They're not killing people; they're killing Nazis. At least that's what they tell themselves. But, as tends to happen in nations occupied and divided by war and ideologies, things get muddy. Bent becomes infatuated with the mysterious Mrs. Ketty Selmer (Stine Stengade), who works for Winther, or for someone else, or for herself. And Winther orders the assassinations of some German Abewahr agents, which provokes a bloody retaliation.

""Flame and Citron"" is a good-looking period drama. It's compelling and, frankly, violent enough that its 2 hours and 20 minutes don't seem too long. The visuals are conventional, and we've all seen countless World War II dramas set in Europe. But these ideas are a little different. Instead of simply heroic fighters and Nazi oppressors, we see an additional layer of people: Those who, for whatever reason, played both sides. Those who were mercenary. Those who took advantage of wartime circumstances to advance themselves unscrupulously. We see that the Resistance often knew about these people but thought it in the best interest of their cause to use them rather than kill them. Politics makes strange bedfellows, often with unintended consequences.

Bent, Jorgen, and their comrades, the men taking outrageous risks and doing appalling things for the cause, are subject to the vicissitudes of their commanders and the delicate politics of occupier and occupied. Mads Mikkelsen underplays Jorgen a bit, I think. But Thure Lindhardt is fascinating to watch as Bent, a brave and intelligent young man who would normally have every opportunity for a comfortable and accomplished life, but who, instead, is a killer living dangerously in a world that is impossible for him to comprehend. I don't know how much of ""Flame and Citron"" has been fictionalized. Both men received honors from the Danish government and the US Congress posthumously. But this film has some interesting things to say about the politics of occupation and collaboration. In Danish and German with optional English, English SDH, and Spanish subtitles.

The film succeeds with us at many levels.  The cinematography was amazing.  Each scene was well-composed, the lighting and colors were all stunning.  There is violence but it is not spectacular violence for the sake of violence.

The characters are well developed and interesting.  As the story unwinds you see human behavior in an occupied country.  Some cooperate with their oppressors (the Danish Nazis), some resist, as Flame and Citron did and some stay in the middle trying just to survive...moving to one side or the other depending on who the likely victor is.  One of the keys to this drama is the treachery of many of the Danes.  The people in the ristance never knew whom the trust.  The Gestapo was accurately portrayed as they work in the community to gather information and extend their tentacles in order to control people.  This is an excellent drama more out of the 1940's and 1950's vintage, not an action-adventure spectacle",1267315200,2,1301,4.792792792792793
3868835,4,B0027UY88G,"The 2008 Danish drama ""Flame & Citron"" (""Flammen & Citronen"") centers on the two real-life resistance fighters in the Nazi-occupied Denmark: Bent Faurschou-Hviid codenamed ""Flame"" (Thure Lindhardt), and Jrgen Haagen Schmith or ""Citron"" (Mads Mikkelsen). Like Paul Verhoeven's ""Black Book"" (very good film from Holland), the story of ""Flame & Citron"" is told against the background of the occupied European countries during WWII and their people, but the Danish film directed by Ole Christian Madsen relies less on plot twists, though some part of his film looks more like a film noir.

""Flame & Citron"" begins with the muffled voiceovers of Flame, obviously angry, and the real-life footage of German soldiers. The film doesn't spend much time introducing historical facts or the back stories of Flame and Citron. Instead, we are introduced to the ways in which the two fighters carry out their assignments (namely assassinations) directly given by their superior Aksel Winther (Peter Mygind). Both believe in their cause until a series of events happens, which will make them suspect that they actually didn't understand the whole situation about their activities, political or otherwise.

Reportedly the most expensive film made in Denmark, ""Flame & Citron"" offers several action scenes involving gun shooting and explosions, and they are all competently done, but the 130 minute film's true focus is the two main characters Flame and Citron and the tormented psyches as the fighters who start to doubt their activities. Thanks to the superb acting from the cast, and the beautiful, grey-hued photography, ""Flame & Citron"" remains gripping throughout, though it must be admitted that some plot devices (fictional, I believe) look clichd, such as the protagonist's estranged wife and Ketty (Stine Stengade) a femme fatale-like figure playing a key role in the second half.

Flawed and overlong, ""Flame & Citron"" is still an absorbing and intense war drama and action.",1265846400,,1968,5.341935483870968
3868836,4,B0027UY88G,"When I heard about this Danish movie, I was intrigued by its premise of resistance activities against the Nazis in WW II Denmark (a country that is also famous for its rescue of most of its Jewish population from the Nazis). Based on true events, ""Flame and Citron"" tells the story of two men, Flame (Thure Lindhardt) and Citron (Mads Mikkelsen who also impressed me in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/After-the-Wedding/dp/B000OCY7JE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">After the Wedding</a>)who are part of the Copenhagen Resistance Movement against the Nazis. Their primary mission is to kill Danish collaborators and Nazis, be it man or woman, young or old. Their lives are fraught with risks and danger, and this makes it difficult for them to forge any long-lasting relationships. Flame is drawn to a mysterious woman Ketty (Stine Stengade) who claims to also work for the Resistance as a courier and who seems to know quite a bit about Flame. Citron faces domestic problems as he is unable to commit time nor be there when his family needs him. The film explores the moral ambiguities in Flame and Citron's work - yes, the Nazis are bad and the collaborators should be punished, but is murder justified, especially when one isn't absolutely certain of guilt (in the case of collaborators).

The bloody nature of their work takes its toll on both men and Flame has moments when he wonders about the morality of what he does - refusing to kill women, and balking from shooting a target who claims not to be a collaborator. It becomes quite apparent that things are not quite as they seem. The story is fast-paced, and there's plenty of action, but at times it does seem that this focus on action and complicated story arcs (double agents, competition between the different factions within the Resistance, etc) detracts from the actual development of the characters. The two leads are credibly portrayed by Thure Lindhardt (Flame) and Mads Mikkelsen (Citron). The cinematography captures the quiet beauty of the Danish landscape, which makes for a startling contrast to the violence portrayed throughout the movie. I'd recommend this to those who like WW II dramas, especially accounts of resistance movements. Also recommended is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Army-of-Shadows-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000NOK0HG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Army of Shadows - Criterion Collection</a>, a 1969 movie which offers a grim portrayal of the French Resistance.",1265241600,4,2533,5.613577023498695
3868837,4,B0027UY88G,"This film succeeds on many levels. It is lovely to look at, with the gorgeous Danish countryside and majestic city of Copenhagen as settings. It is effective, capturing very clearly what the world must have been like at this time. It is compelling. We sweat and worry and shout and cringe with the lovingly portrayed characters. Those are all good things. They make an entertaining film. But it is more than that as well.

There are movies that try to do very little, ""exploring"" or ""suggesting"" or other mealy-mouthed words demonstrating that there is no real theme to them. When a movie ""explores"" the theme of love, I know that people will be in love, but that no particular idea beyond a platitude or two will be discussed. But this movie does an amazing job demonstrating a very easy to state but challenging to convey theme. War is confusing. It is hard to know who is on your side. People lie to their advantage, and when their lives are at stake, they can lie quite convincingly. When nearly everyone is lying, and with a lot to lose, it is challenging to separate the deceitful from the honest. How does one decide who is who? Yet guessing wrong makes you complicit with evil, or dead, or both.

Flame and Citron are two idealists who believe they are acting for good. But things are never what they seem, and by the end of this film you will realize just how beautifully this film makes that clear. I don't know if passivity is the answer, but even when you clearly know what the good is, who is working for it and who is working against it is very difficult to identify.

And then, to tell us that movements need heroes, even if they're false ones, and conclude the film with the information that these two men were canonized as heroes, well, the irony is perfect. No easy answers here, even when the film is over, but a lovely portrayal of the confusion, anxiety, and exasperation that accompany life in trying times.",1264118400,52,1929,4.537356321839081
3868838,4,B0027UY88G,"In German and Danish language with English subtitles. Based
on actual events.

In 1942, during WWII, a group of resistance fighters were
formed in Copenhagen, Denmark and named ""Holger Danske"";
a group which liquidated traitors and at the same time
attempted to avoid intervention by the Germans. Two of
the group's most famous members were Jorgen Haagen Scmith
""Citron"" and Bent Faurschou-Hviid ""Flame"" whom the Germans
eventually sought out for the death of several Nazis.

""Flame and Citron"" is a Danish produced drama and the most
expensive film made in Denmark thus far. It is directed adeptly
and really captures the essence of Denmark and what it must
have been like during Nazi occupation. The content is taken
very seriously with little in the way of hyperbole and the
actors portray their characters with stark realism. The pacing
is done very well and maintains ones interest until the very
end. The scripting is also handled very well in this wholly
political drama, so much in fact that you don't want to miss
any important dialogue, which is a majority of the film.

Being a part of the ""Holger Danske"" meant living one's life
on the edge and made maintaining a relationship virtually
impossible. The group was twice infiltrated by the Gestapo
resulting in the death of 64 of its members. ""Flame"" and
""Citron"" however are steadfast in their fight for the democratic
state of their country amidst the Communists and Fascists.
Thier loyalty to Denmark is unwaivering, however, they eventually
find out that all is not what it seems - deceit and confusion
are rampant in war and they quickly realize that they are no
excpetion to these rules.

A impressively done war film well worth the rental price and
the purchase price for WWII enthusiasts.",1260403200,94,1756,4.922297297297297
8355127,4,B0027UY88G,"This is an interesting, true story, which suffers from a poorly-written, confusing, script. The actors are good and a lot of money was spent on production. The film holds your attention. As the movie opens; viewers are unclear why these two men are killing people. The young man, called ""the flame"" both for his red hair and for constantly lighting cigarettes, is the shooter, and a bit older man called ""the citron"", the lemon, a nickname for his sabotaging German cars and tanks, is his getaway driver. They work for Denmark's Resistance in World War 2. They killed 22 Danish persons, who collaborated with the Nazis. The Danish Resistance as a whole killed 400 collaborators during the Nazi occupation of Denmark. Though the Gestapo zealously hunted these two men; the German army did not retaliate against Danish civilians as long as the Resistance limited themselves to killing Danish collaborators, rather than Germans. When the Danish Resistance killed a German officer; the Germans retaliated by killing say, 20 Danish civilians chosen randomly.
  There is a scene where a Resistance fighter is in a house surrounded by German soldiers and seems to just walk out of the house for no reason. The house had been set on fire by the Germans forcing him out.
  There is another scene where some Resistance fighters have been betrayed, and we find out what happened later, and who was responsible. It would have been better to show in advance the Resistance fighter telling his friend secrets; telling about the safe houses; and then being betrayed.
  The film needed a much clearer script, especially because it is in the Danish and German languages with English subtitles, which often appear and disappear quickly.
  The film seems unbelievable that these two men could be such prolific assassins with such simple methods and with a large price on their heads, but it is a true story.
  The film fails to explain whether they killed any innocent people by mistake; whether their superior, who gave them their orders, was careless or intended to kill innocent people for some unknown reason.",1525910400,,2094,4.974212034383954
