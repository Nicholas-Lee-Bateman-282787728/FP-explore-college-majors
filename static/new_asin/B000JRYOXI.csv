It's a 1997 movie with a few drawcard actors in it.  Mary Tyler Moore plays Kathryn, an old lady who has invested her money in starting a restaurant with another elderly lady which is doing quite well.  One night she waves her other closing staff off, telling them to not wait for her, she'll close up.  But when she opens the backdoor, there's a young man sitting in a car in next door's parking lot giving her a dirty look.  She goes back inside an asks the police if they wouldn't mind sending someone to the car park, it's probably nothing, but she's old and a little scared.  It must be a pretty slow night as three patrol cars rock up with sirens and lights.  The occupant is asked to get out of the car, he's rightfully annoyed and tells them he's done nothing wrong and basically is being obtuse.  They break his window, drag him out of the car and give him a good working over with the batons. Kathryn watching on is shocked, she redials the police number and explains what is happening and that they need to send an ambulance. The next day an Internal Affairs detective (Edward Asner) turns up and has her go through what happened with him.  He wants her to testify against one of the cops who he's been trying to get fired for quite some time but the corrupt cop is the most popular officer on the force amongst his colleagues.  She testifies, but upon returning to her car notices a parking ticket.  This is the start of her, and her family's (which include Denis Arndt as her husband and Adam Scott as her adult son) terror as the cop she testified against, along with other officer's on the force, get their payback!

It's not a bad movie, especially if you can come across it for a few dollars at most.  Obviously as you'd expect with this type of movie, the tormentation gets worse and worse and what we learn about the bad cop's capabilities also worse and worse.  You left wondering as it escalates if he's capable of what he does why he didn't just kill Kathryn herself before the trial as this would be the much easier option, or even the internal affairs guy way before the car park beating even occurred.",1510963200,,2315,4.3534883720930235
8152719,4,B000JRYOXI,a movie with ed asner and mary tyler moore how could it be bad,1426291200,,62,3.5
8152720,4,B000JRYOXI,Of course I recall them from the Mary tyler moore show and Ed asner always a nice screen presense. I got this in a bargain bin for a dollar so I said why not. The production value of the film is good. The storyline was interesting As Ed Asner is an internal affairs officer who encourages Mary tyler Moore to testify against some cops that clearly cross the line. She does so in good faith but than there is Hell to pay. Overall it was 3 1/2 stars. I glad I took the time too look back at these too likeable characters at work. Only thing I had to suspend my beliefs on was the speed in which one of the characters trial evolved  lol Enjoy!,1246924800,,640,4.079365079365079
