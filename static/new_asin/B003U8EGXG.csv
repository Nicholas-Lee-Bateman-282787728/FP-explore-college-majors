4194664,5,B003U8EGXG,"This is one amazing DVD where you learn so much just by listening and drawing along. In weeks I noticed a big difference in my drawings and was having so much fun with the techniques I learned. It is hard to find an artist who you can relate to, has the same style of drawing that you are trying to learn. I ended up buying the other 2 DVDs, the head and the hands and feet. Being that I am a visual learner, these DVDs were exactly what I have been looking for. I have at least 75 different styles of drawing books but now I just need the DVD.",1311379200,5,544,3.9545454545454546
4194665,5,B003U8EGXG,"A great resource for pro artists & art students. Finch breaks down the figure into simple shapes, in static and dynamic figure poses, straight on and in perspective. Spends ample time constructing simple volumes, fleshing them out with muscle and visible bone structures. The video is sped up slightly, allowing time for Finch to draw the same thing several times from different angles, which is key to learning the figure well.

Of most help to me was just seeing his whole process from first spontaneous pencil stroke to finished result. You're literally looking over the shoulder of an accomplished professional comic book illustrator, as you might in an art class. Unlike an art class, however, you can pause and rewind as needed. Also of great help was his simple figure breakdown method, and instruction on line weight to represent and emphasize lighting and form, even without shadowing (which he also covers in detail).

Finch doesn't go into as detailed a breakdown of feet, faces, and hands, as these are covered in his other two drawing DVD's. And he doesn't draw a detailed diagram of the anatomy complete with medical terminology. He shows instead ways of accurately visualizing and drawing the muscles of a dynamic figure. Get an anatomy atlas if you want meticulous diagrams and names of all the muscles. This just focuses on how to draw them.

Finch's narration is good, and instructional, but is informal and without a script. Occasionally the narration could be better focused as the topic he's discussing is dropped abruptly when the sped-up video finishes a drawing and moves ahead to another topic. But this had little impact on the quality of instruction -- hardly enough to knock down the 5th star for this reviewer.

Great video for the student or pro who needs to be better and faster at drawing human figures.",1303776000,6,1835,4.9288025889967635
4194666,4,B003U8EGXG,"I'm often skeptical that you can learn anything from a DVD - give me a book and I'm fine trying to learn from it. I took a chance a while back and bought the Gnomon Workshop DVD tutorial&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Comic-Book-Coloring-with-Steve-Firchow/dp/B0013TPNR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Comic Book Coloring with Steve Firchow</a>&nbsp;and after viewing that, I was hooked. I had to go and get more of the Gnomon Workshop DVDs to try and see what they had to offer a struggling hobbyist-artist like myself.

Enter ""Dynamic Figure Drawing Volume 1: The Head."" While certainly not the last word in drawing the human head, this excellent DVD, drawn and narrated by the great David Finch, will give you added insight into the basics and some of the more complicated aspects of drawing a believable comic-book style face.

The Good: This lengthy tutorial (more than 2:15) covers the gamut of drawing the human head, from the basics of human facial construction to camera angles, male/female face-drawing techniques, hair, light and shade, facial features, and more. There's just too much covered to list it all here; suffice it to say: if you're looking to learn more about drawing a face (whether you're just starting out or have experience and want some more technical advice) this is the DVD for you. Finch narrates his drawings in this video, which are speeded up, but not so fast that you don't understand what's going on. It's invaluable to be able to see a professional's process, and this video delivers in spades.

Something else that's nice is that Finch along the way talks not only about certain tricks and tips (for instance - is your profile shot not working? It might be because you're not drawing your eyes far enough back into the face) but also about what aspects of drawing the face he personally struggles with. Hearing this from a seasoned artist with 20+ years in the business will help those of us who get frustrated when our drawings don't always turn out take heart.

Additionally: You rarely see good discussions of how to draw hair, or how to add shadows to a face, in most books. Some books cover them but, because they're generally difficult subjects, don't seem to be able to cover them in detail. Finch has a great segment on drawing male and female hair (actually a couple - they're a little scattered in the DVD) as well as a terrific segment at the end on simplifying the shading of the face. It's worth the money just for those two items.

The Bad: In all honesty, not a whole lot. If you're just starting out, this may not be the best place to begin just because there is an assumption in this DVD that you at least know how to draw a basic face. If you have that down pat, then you should be fine (if not, I recommend the fantastic book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secrets-to-Drawing-Heads/dp/1402747438/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secrets to Drawing Heads</a>, which revolutionized by drawing techniques overnight with its simple but versatile instruction). Also, how to adequately figure out how to draw some of the angles of faces isn't explained too greatly, though repeated viewings will help. Additionally, I recommend watching this video through once from beginning to end, taking notes, and then go back and watch the sections you need to review, before you start drawing. If you try to draw while watching the video, I guarantee you're going to miss something.

Overall, a superb video, and one I can recommend to almost anyone interested in drawing a comic book style face.",1299974400,9,3616,5.109983079526227
4194667,5,B003U8EGXG,"While the AlienThink instructions probably moved me toward actually thinking like an artist, David Finch's work gave me hope I could do it when I had no such hope.  He's a joy to watch and this DVD is loaded with visual and expressed instruction on how to draw the human body (male and female).  I've watched this two or three times and followed along as Dave illustrates what works - worth the time and the money.",1298332800,3,414,4.434210526315789
4194668,5,B003U8EGXG,"I love watching David Finch draw and especially learn as he explains what he's doing, why and some of the reasons he has for doing certain artistic applications.  I've watched this twice and learned more than I planned to see both times.",1298332800,2,237,4.642857142857143
4194669,5,B003U8EGXG,"This video is jam packed with valuable lessons on drawing the head and face. David Finch is an amazing artist and does a good job of delivering instuction in basic head and face drawing. He starts by showing you the basic layout of average heads. He then begins to add more detail and draws them from several diffent angles. He demonstrates altering proportions to draw short wide heads and long thin heads. He demonstrates, however briefly, drawing heads of younger and older males. Female heads, faces, and hair are covered in detail. The drawings are played at high speed so you get even more drawing demonstrations for your money. The speed is not so fast that you can not see what he is doing though. Finch wastes no time in getting to the instruction and draws right up to the very end so there is no fluff and garbage to sit through. You get over two hours of nothing but drawing demo and instruction.
  Another thing about Finch's instruction is his admittance to struggling with certain areas of drawing the face. Sometimes it is hard for a fanboy like me to imagine that such a great artist still struggles with his work. Knowing this encourages me about my own challenges I face from time to time.
  The only cons to this dvd, and these are VERY minor cons, are 1.) The instruction on drawing eye detail. He really only draws the iris and pupil one way and says so in his narration. He gives no other examples of how it could be drawn. And number 2.) There are several places where Finch seems to get sidetracked or just forgets what to say and just sits there in silence.
  Overall this is a great dvd for aspiring comic book artist or any type of illustrator. I also highly recommend his dvd on drawing the Dynamic Figure.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dynamic-Figure-Drawing-The-Body/dp/B003VY5ZPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dynamic Figure Drawing: The Body</a>",1284940800,5,1914,4.928571428571429
4194670,5,B003U8EGXG,"This is an incredible dvd. You get to watch David Finch as he sketches and draws the human figure. He starts with a basic form sketch and then lightly erases it so he can render a clean, detailed figures. He draws a variety of poses from a variety of angles. He draws from the front, side, and back. He draws male and female figures. The muscles of the arm and leg are detailed. He doesn't waist time with proper names of the muscles. He simply draws them out there for you to see. He covers lighting effects on the muscles from several different angles. At the end he demonstrates drawing a couple of examples of unusual body types. This video has really helped me with my figure drawing. I've watched it several times already. There is over two hours of instruction for you to learn from. The drawings are played at high speed while he narrarates what he's doing so you get even more drawings than you would if it was played in real time.
  If you are an aspiring comic book artist then this video by one of the best pencillers ever is an absolute must to own. I highly recommend it if you are any type of artist and want some brushing up on you figure work.",1279929600,9,1160,4.292237442922374
8405727,3,B003U8EGXG,"The content of this ""dvd"" is actually very helpful. The price is a bit high, but it does contain everything you would expect. You're probably wondering why I put ""dvd"" in quotes. That's because it's NOT EVEN A REAL DVD!! The actual disc this is printed on is STRAIGHT GARBAGE!!! It's like a data disc or something. My xbox 360, dvd players, and ps3 all show it as 'unreadable'. I put in my ps4, and it worked (kind of), but then it started skipping around to different chapters randomly. I was able to use it successfully on a Mac desktop computer, although it doesn't play like a dvd would. The disc shows that it contains a file on it, and the video is in that file. Why they couldn't just burn a regular dvd is beyond me. It's not hard. I've done it several times. (In case you're wondering, I am in the designated NTSC region labelled on the back.)

Just to further reiterate the in competence of whoever put this thing together, here's a quote from the back of the box: ""[David Finch's] artwork will be featured on the covers of the upcoming follow up to Darkest Night, entitled Brightest Day."" Yes, they actually wrote 'Darkest Night', which means they were too lazy to even use google to check if the titles were right. One simple search would have turned up the title 'Blackest Night' and they wouldn't look like idiots. I know it doesn't actually affect the product in any way, but it shows this was produced by a bunch of buffoons.",1425168000,2,1441,4.458333333333333

8405729,5,B003U8EGXG,Finch is a master and I like to get books and particularly DVDs of excellent craftsmen to get ideas.  This is well worth studying for the serious artist. The focus is more for cartoons but anyone who wants to draw the head will get a lot out of this.  It is incredible to watch him draw.  I'm afraid he is a bit over my head but I intend to go back to it again and again as I learn.  And he converted me to mechanical pencils.,1399334400,,426,3.9186046511627906

8405731,5,B003U8EGXG,"One of the best instruction videos out there. David takes you through basic shapes to making muscles and form. One of the most complete videos out there with great insight into his influences and industry tricks.

You can tell he genuinely cares and loves to teach. Highly recommend buying this DVD if you are considering it. You won't regret it and will reference it many times over. I know I do.",1380153600,,397,4.591549295774648
8405732,4,B003U8EGXG,Get ready to watch this video a few times. It's difficult to learn from a master like Finch when so much of what he does is instinct but he does a good job of explaining the steps involved in figure drawing.,1379635200,,207,4.073170731707317
8405733,5,B003U8EGXG,"Does what it says! David's style of commentary takes getting used to but he knows what he's talking about. The construction method needs a lot of practice, unfortunately there's no shortcut with drawing figures easily. Once you are OK with the basic shape and proportions it's much easier adding anatomy on top. I liked his idea making an initial drawing then erasing most of it before starting again as this allows correcting small mistakes.
Well worth buying, but be aware of additional postage and VAT costs if not in the USA/Canada.",1370131200,,536,4.9010989010989015
