7933097,1,B00005957K,"I was really looking forward to watching this DVD on the land down under, what a disappointment.  The film footage is incredibly weak, so dated it seems to have been made in the early 80's.  The quality is also poor, with the picture being so grainy I wish I would have bought the video over the DVD so I wouldnt feel as bad about wasting the money.  The content overall is mediocre but it was mostly like watching a bad commercial, doing no justice to an amazing country.",1029456000,16,472,4.340909090909091
