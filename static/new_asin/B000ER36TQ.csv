8113497,4,B000ER36TQ,"Another Soviet horror film like VIY. The Savage Hunt is from Belarus and it's got all the classic USSR hallmarks. The film takes place before the Soviet Revolution and is about a good communist student coming to his backwards bourgeoisie run town to get his rich person inheritance (in communism it's those darn chaotic middle class merchants who are the real issue) and bring logic to the town. Unfortunately, his town is filled with ghosts of a sad lady, a dwarf, and a hunting party that slays people for a kingly screw up involving a king decades ago.

It's neat to see the Soviet filmmakers engaging in Western visuals and bringing their own sensibility to it. They got a Jane Eyre meets Wuthering Heights thing going on here with some Great Expectations stuff going on. Everything is fading decadence. The mansion is filling with water, another mansion is built over tombs, and everything is covered in spider webs and other signs of disrepair. Everyone is slowly going insane from trying to survive in a place with no food while the rich eat their food or they are ratting each other out to the authorities or other rich people. The potential for seeing a form of protest in the film is there but I don't think it's really intentional. Most of the film consists of a well made gothic thriller that maintains the party line about a great many things by the end, which could've been state censor mandated but who knows.

It's a good movie to pick up and watch if you can find it.",1466380800,,1484,4.59622641509434
