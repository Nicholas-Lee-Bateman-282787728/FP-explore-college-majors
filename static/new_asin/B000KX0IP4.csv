2698372,3,B000KX0IP4,"I had mixed feelings about this movie.

I thought the portrayal of deafness was really off.  The idea that a deaf person is totally shut off from the world was just wrong.  I happen to be friends with several deaf people who lead totally normal lives.  There ARE stupid people who consider deaf people to be retarded or dumb, but not that many.

The movie started off well enough and I was interested at first, but  lost focus of the story somewhere in the middle.  I wasn't sure what it was all about at the end.  Surreal is the best word I can use to describe this movie.

I don't understand the police confession at all or even what the point of the story was.  I was just confused when the credits rolled and I thought, ""Was that it?""

Both co-stars are beautiful and easy on the eyes, though, so that might please some people.",1169251200,3,831,4.296774193548387

2698421,2,B000KX0IP4,"PLOT SPOILER (?)

This is a moody, doomy, gloomy movie about high school kids.  The first major problem is:  None of the kids look like they are in high school.  As a matter of fact, Elisha Cuthbert is 31, and Camille Belle is 27 in real life.  Who casted this movie?

The second major problems is that the film drags on and on.  Very early we get the point that Camille is pretending to be deaf and all of the high school students treat her like she's mentally retarded, and that Elisha is having incest with her father and fantasizes about killing him, and that her mother is extremely dysfunctional and addicted to prescription drugs.  Now what?

Other than a couple of uninteresting minor sub-plots, that's it.  That's the theme of the movie and it plays over and over.

Some reviewers think that there is a ""twist"" or a surprise ending.  If you must watch it because of the Five Star reviews, post a note and tell me if you were surprised.

Finally, the only thing that surprised me in this film (and warranted Two Stars) was that Edie Falco bravely strips to the waist because the script called for it.  Usually producers want the ""teenage"" girls to take off their clothes in movies to draw teenage boys to the box office.",1399075200,,1228,4.472972972972973

Or maybe only because I have a huge crush on Elisha Cuthbert. Anyway, the twist is really easy to see coming from the moment the movie starts. That's about all I have to say about this one. I only give it four stars because Cuthbert is pretty. And also because it brings up some pretty thought-provoking questions, but fails to fully tackle them.",1375920000,,466,4.765432098765432

2698455,4,B000KX0IP4,"For full disclosure, I watched this in HD on ""free"" TV, where it was edited for content.  I'm going to have to watch it again since, while I knew what people were saying, there were too many blips that took away from this underrated film.

This is the first movie that I've seen with Camilla Belle, and I think that she has some pretty decent acting chops.  She doesn't say much in this film -- she supposedly is deaf and mute -- so she has to make up for this with mostly action.  Nice work.  (After watching this film I decided to watch ""From Prada to Nada,"" which I will review later.)

I believe that some of the subject matter in this film turned off the critics, or more likely, they didn't want to acknowledge that they liked it because of that subject matter.  If so, shame on them.  Without going into too many details, this stuff goes on in the real world so just deal with it already and stop burying your heads in the sand, I say!  Sometimes life is just plain dirty, and movies should mirror what happens in real life.  Otherwise, filmmakers are just lying, which segues us right to our theme. . . .

But this film is mostly about secrets, and probably more important, dishonesty and lying.  Everyone here lies, even Ms. Belle, in an ironic twist.  But the real question is:  is it better to never hear anything, including lies, or is it better to be able to listen to lies that are interspersed with little truths here and there?  On somewhat of a side note, I have read that everyone lies, including non-human animals, and those lies actually allow societies to exist.  Could you imagine if you had to tell everyone the truth all day long?  You surely wouldn't want to talk with anyone!  ""Does this dress make me look fat?"" might be the most tortuous question of the day, for both the asker and the answerer.

This is surprisingly good dark comedy, and I really enjoyed it.  I considered going a 5, but just couldn't do it.  But a strong recommendation, and a strong 4 from me.",1362355200,,1992,4.387978142076503

2698462,3,B000KX0IP4,"I rented this movie expecting a corny thriller with some very pretty faces and perhaps some risque subject matter.  While this movie didn't deliver what I was originally looking for, I did find it enjoyable.  The real premise of this movie, to paint a complex interpersonal story using an involved but highly passive narrator (Dot), proves its potential in this movie, but this movie falls flat in many other ways.  I found the dialog in this movie to be unconvincing and distracting, and the plot had numerous holes, making the entire story seem half baked.  The movie paints a very interesting perspective on some very disturbing subject matter, but the many distractions in the film prevented me from following the emotions of the characters.

Easily Cuthbert's most heart-wrenchingly complicated role.  Not sure how this one did in the box office, but for Cuthbert fans (Girl Next Door for most of them), this really shows how deep into a character she can get, and goes a long way to get rid of that shallow, underrated stigma she gets sometimes.",1224806400,,534,4.731182795698925

I became caught up in this film, despite my original expectations not being fulfilled.  Ironically, I came to care about the characters, and rooted for closure.  This movie is difficult to review without giving the good stuff away, but if you can set aside your preconceived notions and roll with the story you are in for a wild ride.

Even the slow scenes are full of tension, and I consider this to be a Psychological thriller.  This movie is full of teenage motifs, family psychoses, action, and revelations that unfold into a great climax.",1206144000,2,746,4.6923076923076925

Some issues are covered such as how life would be for a deaf person, and incest. The acting is ok, the storyline is average and the movie goes at a slow pace.

2698490,3,B000KX0IP4,"At first glance, ""The Quiet"" appears to be the same pseudo-psychological thriller starring the hottest cast of teenagers around. It's actually quite far from that. It's a film that's part John Waters part David Lynch, but without the class of the latter and the humor of former. It's unlike anything that I've seen in this kind of film for a long time. It stars the super-talented Camilla Belle as Dot, a deaf and mute girl who is taken in by her godparents (Martin Donovan & Edie Falco) when her father dies. Her new sister Nina (Elisha Cuthbert), a beautiful, 17-year-old cheerleader hates her. Because of her problems, Dot is immediately labeled a freak and social outcast. It's clear, obvious really, from the beginning that Dot is hiding a secret or two. Same with Nina, although it doesn't take you long to figure out exactly what's going on with that. Now this is a twisted film that isn't aimed at the teenage audience most of these films are aimed at. It's looking for an adult audience as it deals with a lot of sexual topics (indeed, 75% of the dialogue is sexual in nature), incest, murder, and a whole jubilee of other weird stuff. One thing ""The Quiet"" captures well is the way teenagers talk. Sex is a touchy subject among teenagers in movies, while sex here is completely unhibited. A lot of the dialouge though is stuff that teenagers think and wouldn't actually say. ""The Quiet"" could have been a bigger hit with critics (with this subject matter, it would've never been a box-office hit) if the material was handled better. This is familar material, but it's not usually handled in major motion pictures...And the writers have clearly been watching too many soap operas. Falco, a talented actress, as Nina's mother is the stereotypical pill-popping mother we see in at least 10 movies each year. Donovan, as the father, seems to have based his performance upon Stellan Skarsgaard in ""The Glass House"" and it's not a stretch to say Falco seems to have got inspiration from Diane Lane in that same film. ""The Quiet"" does stray away from other stereotypes like the ""happy ending."" The bad guys essentially get away in this film...But it makes a lot of mistakes along the way and many ""serious"" scenes border on parody. The director messed up too by filming a few scenes here-and-there with a different camera, giving it a cheap straight-to-video look. ""The Quiet"" will surprise you when you pop it in and find out it's not the sister-sequel to ""When a Stranger Calls"" and then they'll be pissed when they don't know if they're supposed to be shocked or crying with laughter.

Not a welcome change to her new godsister, Nina (Elisha Cuthbert), who wants nothing to do with this ""freak"" at home or school, where she is a popular cheerleader. Dot tries to keep to herself, but she soon becomes a confession magnet due to her deafness to those who feel the need to get things off their chest to someone, but without the repercussions of revealing their secrets. Unfortunately for pretty much everyone in this movie, nothing is as it seems, and their actions lead to events that will tragically change the lives of those involved.

This is defintely one of those movies where you will thank your lucky stars if you have even a semblance of a good family life after watching. Dark, colorless and depressing to be sure, but surreally beautiful at the same time.

Like some of the other reviewers, I was attracted to the movie because of Elisha Cuthbert who is stunning and can act (I loved her work in the 24 series) However, even her dialogue is purile in this bomb.

Camilla Belle is simply awesome in portraying Dot. Elisha Cutbert also shows that she can indeed act (you'll know what I mean if you've seen her previous movies).

These informations are necessary to understand why THE QUIET is not your typical anonymous Hollywood film, it's a film desired and shot the way its authors wanted it to be. That's not so common nowadays.

Most of the action of THE QUIET takes place in only two locations, the Deer's family home and the local high school or more exactly, two particular rooms of the school, the swimming pool and the auditorium. Hence, the claustrophobic mood of the film, reinforced by Dot's deafness. The necessary clash between this mood and the movie genre chosen by THE QUIET'S authors, the teenager movie, is banging and brilliantly underlines the dramatic theme of the film.

2698526,3,B000KX0IP4,"Wow, has there ever been such a family of such total disfunction under one roof?  Camille comes to live with her godparents.  Godparents?  That's an oxymoron in itself.  What this film was about actually was four insane people who were incapable of functioning on a normal plane of existence.  The dolts at the school weren't much better, either being insane, clueless or just plain stupid.  Don't get me wrong here, I kind of enjoyed this film, but it was very dark and depressing.  It was also prety hard to believe that this level of mental incapacity could exist in one home.  There's a cute line about the possible results of family inbreeding in this film.  I think they may have thought about the possibilities a little too late.  Beyond that, not only was Dot able to fool everyone she met, but she did it with such ease despite obvious clues to her real condition.  Nina (played by Elisha Cuthbert) on the other hand, was --- well, she was hot to put it bluntly.  Not only was she hot, but she (her character) knew she was hot and she knew that everyone else thought she was hot.  She was so hot in fact that...Caution...SPOILER...Her dad was her boyfriend/lover.  That's not really a spoiler because it's evident early in the film.  This film was kind of difficult to watch as it deals a lot with uncomfortable situations, but if you can make it through it's pretty well done, if you can stomach it and if you can suspend belief a bit.  The ending though was very weak.  I was left wondering:  ""So what now?""  Do Dot and NIna just go off living happily ever after?  Do they become the new owners of the Bates Motel?  Do they move to the hills where they have eyes?  What?  They are obviously two nut cases set free upon an unsuspecting world.  The bottom line is if you are in a somber mood, go ahead and watch this film.  If nothing else, it will give you something to think about. At the least, you can look at Elisha Cuthbert.

2698527,3,B000KX0IP4,"A parent's worst nightmare comes true in The Quiet and this nightmare never ends. Dot (Camilla Belle) is a deaf mute and now orphan taken in by her godparents Olivia and Paul Deer (Edie Falco, Martin Donovan). She lost her mother when she was 7 and recently lost her father to a car accident. Unfortunately for this poor girl her pain does not stop with her parents. Her godparents are the worst guardians you could ever imagine and their daughter Nina (Elisha Cuthbert) is in an even worst position. Olivia is an alcoholic and she abuses painkillers, she takes them and drinks until she passes out. When Olivia finally passes out Paul molests his own daughter Nina and even treats her like she's his girlfriend and not his child. Dot has to deal with these things and school but she can't hear or speak so it doesn't matter to her or does it.

The big thing with The Quiet is that Dot is the person that everyone confides simply because they think she can't hear them. So what they want to tell they tell Dot and get the satisfaction of letting a secret go but never worry about everyone truly finding out. Even Paul comes to Dot and explains to her that he's sick and tells her all his dirty nasty secrets and thinks this secret is just falling on deaf ears. Nina who eventually thinks that Dot is just using this to be a loaner tries everything to get her to speak even telling her that she's tired of her father and wants to kill him. Dot doesn't bite on this and just keeps going about her business.

There are some major problems with The Quiet though it had the potential to be very good. For starters it's too predictable, right off the bat you know everything that's going on. The characters are done poorly; the way they develop is just way too bad. The acting was fine but the way everything unfolds just makes this movie feel dirty. Dot is like the only pure character, she keeps the movie sane but then there's this part near the end with actor Sean Ashmore that just kills her character and makes her like everyone else. Her character was the key to the movie; she kept the movie from going in outer space. When every character is abnormal or basically sick you need a character like hers to keep real. Overall this movie was close to being good but just fell flat right before the end. It's worth seeing if you have the time but don't expect any surprises.",1177286400,3,2371,4.410958904109589
2698528,4,B000KX0IP4,"I am not going to summarize the plot of this movie again since it has been nicely done by several other reviewers already, but I would like to stress out that the cast of this movie is excellent. Edie Falco, Martin Donovan, Shawn Ashmore are tremendous. Camilla Belle who plays the young Dot is quite touching and very true. But most of all Elisha Cuthbert (Popular Mechanics for Kids, 24, The Girl Next Door), dazzling as usual, gives here an insight into her great skills as an actress by vividly portraying a teenage daughter who conceals her fragility under an apparent casualness, torn apart between the love she feels for her father and the deep-rooted hate she has for him too.

The subject of this film, quite dark as you probably know by now, benefits from a great visual and musical atmosphere. I would like to take off my hat to the Director of Photography who did an awsome job here.

The only tiny little flaw I see in this movie is the ending. I grant this film only four stars because of that (although I have to say that four and a half stars would have been more fair, but it is not possible!). Indeed even though the outcome is quite unexpected and very well thought, the conclusion of ""The quiet"" feels a bit rushed (shortage of money? lack of time? poor choice during the movie editing?), as if the Director had to push herself into getting through the end of the film faster than planned. However this is the only minor flaw of a movie you won't soon forget after watching it and moreover, I have to admit it, you will watch (and watch all over again) with renewed interest and pleasure.",1177200000,9,1608,4.465986394557823

2698530,5,B000KX0IP4,"The Quiet"" is a surreal and creepy film. It is like ""Twin Peaks"" or ""Mulholland Drive"" but without the supernatural elements. It is funny in that it is really weird, but the characters in the film do not realize how strange they are.

Dot is deaf and mute and moves in with her Godmother's family. They seem to be a normal middle class family, but they're not. The father is sexually abusing the daughter and the mother is a drug addict. The daughter is cruel to Dot in front of the other kids at school. Dot makes no effort to make any friends.

But then the strangeness starts. People go out of their way to find Dot by herself and tell her their deepest and darkest secrets. Then we find out that Dot has some secrets of her own.

This is a disturbing film, especially the incest. It is filmed like a horror film. Most of it takes place in the dark. It has one of the most intriguing endings I've seen in a long time.

The professional critics missed the point of this movie. If you are in the mood for a surreal and creepy film, ""The Quiet"" gets my highest recommendation.",1176422400,21,1076,4.285714285714286
2698531,3,B000KX0IP4,"The Quiet was pretty well written in terms of certain characters, such as Camilla Belle and Elisha Cuthberts role. But I think the middle and ending could of been better in refrence to certain scenes in the movie.",1173657600,2,213,4.631578947368421
2698551,4,B000KX0IP4,"Elisha Cuthbert seems to have a flair for being in unconventional, disturbing movies like THE GIRL NEXT DOOR and THE QUIET.  First off, I thought it amazing just how much of a High School girl she appeared to be as I know she has to be in her 20s.  As always, she offers a provocative performance of a troubled young lady who is contemplating selling her body to make money.

Camilla Belle has a mysterious, demure beauty which is perfect for her part as a mousey, deaf & mute girl.  She is adopted by the parents of Cuthbert's character's parents, which initially causes a great deal of resentment.

This is quite a depressing movie which tells the story of two very troubled teens.  One is disturbed because she just lost her beloved father, who was the center of her universe.  The other is emotionally pained because she has been raised in a warped family with a sicko father who has made a habit of molesting her.  Thankfully, each of the girls find solace in the company of the other.

This is a shocking, thought provoking movie with some very nice allusions to how Ludwig van Beethoven dealt with his deafness.  It is not a movie for the feint of heart.  If you are ""normal,"" your stomach will turn inside out during some of the scenes - and that is precisely the point.  Viewer beware;  this film will be in your thoughts for quite awhile after you watch it.",1172966400,14,1367,4.463709677419355

The acting was superb, the music fit in brilliantly with the movie and this is an honest dark film.  The only reason I did not give this movie 5 stars was because the secret that Dot possessed was obvious throughout the entire movie.  The director could have done a bit more to conceal this until later into the movie.  I am not going to lie and say that everybody should see this movie.  To be honest, you should watch it with an open mind.  This is mainly due to the fact that the this movie does deal with an incestuous relationship between a father and his daughter.  I am in no way condoning incest but this movie is well worth the watch.  I sat there at the end of the movie with my mouth open still trying to comprehend all that had happened in the movie.  Hopefully you will not be dissapointed.  At the very least, rent it before you decide to buy it.",1172880000,3,957,4.174863387978142
2698553,2,B000KX0IP4,"The Quiet fails on almost all accounts. I think the best part of this DVD is the cover and the title (I mean, that's a pretty catchy, timely title, when we have movies like The Grudge, The Prestige, The Messengers, etc. etc.). Anyway, from the very opening frames The Quiet starts to lose the credibility that a film starring Camilla Belle should have. (I mean, this is the girl that made the remake of When a Stranger Calls into a decent thriller).

The basic plot is that the ""perfect"" suburban family (Martin Donovan and Edie Falco, and cheerleader daughter played by Elisha Cuthbert) have taken in their goddaughter Dot, a troubled young girl who is deaf and dumb... or IS she? Believe me, I'm not spoiling the plot, she's narrating the very first shot of the film. This is where the plot seems to falter. The characters in the film don't know that Dot can hear and speak, but the audience clearly does. This great divide doesn't provide the kind of voyeuristic knowledge you might think. It just makes it seem obvious and makes the other characters seem duller.

Especially when they start telling Dot their ""deepest secrets"" thinking that she can't hear them. The worst part about this is that they look right into her eyes while telling her, even though they know that she can read lips... so her being deaf has nothing to do with whether she ""hears"" their secrets or not.

The problems with this film are multi-faceted, but the main issue really seems to be uninspired directing. Most of the scenes just fall flat. And often there are sets that appear to be filled with smoke, but why? Why? To provide some sort of eerie feeling to the audience that the script isn't driving home?

The story is overtly creepy and melancholy, but not in a way that really connects with the viewers. Mostly audiences will come off feeling dirty for watching and ready for the whole thing to be over. Even the climactic few scenes are severely lacking in emotional connectivity. How can we care about the immense tragedy occuring, when we don't care about any of the characters?

The DVD contains a few extra featurettes, but they're just as uninspired as the film itself. The featurette entitled THE CAST is the best simply because you get to see a very bored looking director (Jamie Babbit) talk about how she didn't get the cast she originally wanted, and then half-heartedly try to cover that up by vaguely touching on the qualities of her actors. (i.e. ""Camilla Belle will play a much different Dot than Thora Birch would have."")

Overall, after viewing this film, it's very clear why it took two years to make a theatrical and DVD release. There simply isn't the audience for this film. Hopefully the next releases from Burnt Orange Productions will be more inspired than this one.",1172534400,12,2776,4.689938398357289
2698554,2,B000KX0IP4,"It would be so easy to suggest a main title for the review in an obvious word play of the film, such as ""this film should've stayed quiet"" or ""film doesn't follow own advice and shut up"" but that's too easy. Because basically watching the film you start to notice you almost like it for the wrong reasons. Director Jamie Babbit, previously known for directing lesbian drama But I'm a Cheerleader, shows a family with much sordid details and secrets but just not the right approach.

The Deer family (don't laugh, that's their last name) adopt Dot, a deaf-mute who becomes a quick target for the daughter, Nina. However, Dot's seemingly useful ability to hear but not hear what people say brings about some family secrets and tension and ultimately the bigger question is what secret does Dot have that she's not sharing?

Sometimes there are lines that are obviously meant to bring about a laughter, where because it's ridiculous and toilet humor, scatching and political or just a knowing laugh like a ""I know how that is"". But it's a bad sign when a line, meant to be serious, brings laughter. There are several lines like this in the film including one involving a guy talking about his ""manhood"". The story isn't that well-written either.  The family secret is pretty rough but there's no emotional connection so the only thing bad about the secret is what it actually is and not how it affects anyone in the film.

How's the actors? Well after awhile you mistake hotness for acting. While Camille Belle was surprising in a film called the Ballad of Jack and Rose, here she's pretty good but there's not a lot of depth to the character whereas Elisha Cuthbert, equally hot, has tons of depth but maybe not acting chops at times. While she is given enough time to develop a character, it's unfortunately not enough time before we're whisked somewhere else. Then there's the whole ""Dot's secret"" which would've worked if she didn't narrate and there was enough scenes to have you already guessing what it was.

If there's nothing else to rent and can't find anything, give it a shot but perhaps it's best to just admire Belle and Cuthbert with the sound off. Ugh, another ""quiet"" joke.",1172361600,5,2187,4.699738903394256
2698555,5,B000KX0IP4,"""The Quiet"" ranks among the best films of 2006.  The bravado of the story alone deserves high praise, but there is oh so much more.  A stunning depiction of mixed up teen hormones, dysfunctional family values, and murder reveals the danger of a bored suburban existence.

The cast is stunning, especially the under-used Katy Mixon who plays a borish teenager with the sex drive of a water buffalo.

2698556,4,B000KX0IP4,"This movie (the trailer I saw) is very misleading, I was thinking it was going to more like teen horror, but it is actually very realistic and quite brutal in a realistic manner.  You get what's going on about 20 minutes in and it's tough to watch.  Believe me it gets harder.  Cuthbert and Belle were very good in this, that cannot be taken away, but be sure you're ready to watch something this somber.",1171843200,28,404,4.36
2698557,3,B000KX0IP4,"THE QUIET comes to the big screen then back to DVD as the product of a group of television writers Abdi Nazemian and Micah Schraft and director (Jamie Babbit) and the film has the feeling that it would have fared better in a made for television format. It is not a film without merit - the cast is good, the atmosphere created is well captured by good camera people, the twist in the story survives - but something is missing that keeps it flat.

The Deers are a family with means whose generosity extends to taking in the victim of another family disaster: the troubles that hide in the Deer family far overpower the problems brought to the unit by the new member.  Dot (Camilla Belle of When a Stranger Calls, Chumscrubber, The Ballad of Jack and Rose) is accepted into the Deer household when her deaf father dies in a freak accident: her mother died when Dot was seven and from that time to the present she has been newly deaf and mute.  She is a loner, preferring to live in her own apparently silent world, finding solace in playing Beethoven piano works (the actress actually plays the works!).  Her 'sister' is high school cheerleader, foul mouthed, crabby Nina (Elisha Cuthbert) who barely tolerates Dot's new role in the house and at school.  Olivia Deer (Edi Falco, always excellent) is an interior designer mother who buries her disappointments in pills, being emotionally unavailable most of the time.  Paul Deer (Martin Donovan) is a successful architect whose apparent kindness masks a man who is having an incestuous relationship with his daughter Nina.  Dot lets the audience know early on that she is indeed not deaf or mute but elects to maintain her silence as she overhears Nina's plan to kill her father.  The manner in which these two girls eventually bond and accomplish the dastardly deed and the surprising ending of the family's dissolution make up the basis for the plot development.

Taken on the basis of the story alone the film is fairly predictable, but it is after the movie is over that in retrospect we recognize how cleverly the writers and director and actors have shown us the fragility of each character: each is not black and white/good and evil but in a misty gray zone, a general statement for just about everyone who is in the cast (Connor the walking failure boyfriend - Shawn Ashmore, Michelle the rowdy slutty girlfriend - Katy Mixon).  And it is this tendency to encourage the audience to ponder introspection that takes it to a higher level.  It is to everyone's credit that they have taken on a tale that is bravely controversial and make it work as well as it does.  Grady Harp, February 07",1171756800,2,2641,4.668103448275862

I was mesmerised by this woman director Jamie Babbit's great geat work THE QUIET and still shievering by it's beauty. It's delicacy, it's deep emotion, it's deep story and it's deep charactormaking.

They should have her direct the movie RESPIRE the novel written by Anne-Sophie Brasme 17 year old girl who bacame a best seller trend from France. They just dump that great novel to pretty actress Mlanie Laurent without second thought and totally ruined it.

I don't understand this woman director, why did she made so ugly movies and Tv series all her life and now only this one masterpiece?

This movie is so delicate and well done so that it is even scary to describe to you that I might ruin the very essence of the beauty of it.

I really had a doubt before watching it as seeing the cover will this be another lesbian story? The answer is far from it. It is nothing to do with lesbian matter.
It has something to do with darkness of this 17 year old girl who was entrapped by her own world just to have a communication with now dead father she decides to be a mute, shut down her ears (pretend that she cannot year or talk).  She constantly think of Beethoven she wants to be like him maybe. Not a genious but the very essense of being not able to hear/ listen but able to survive with that manner.
After hear father's death, her father/ mother's closest friend decides to keep her for a while.

The daughter. the classmate of the pretend to be mute/ deaf who's father is a sick person who is having sex with the daughter constantly (TWIN PEAKS)

The boy who is having trouble with grades at school who just wants to dump all his words to someeone who cannot hear choose to do so to her who happens to fall in love with her cause she cannot hear or listen.

The mother. husband of the sick man who is a drug addict who ends with becomming a bit crazy who saves the entire final wow incident that I will never reveal otherwise this whole movie will be meaningless,..

When the classmate tells the pretending recluse girl that she will kill the father tonight, she decides that she will do this herself.
One day when the daughter was trying to refuse her father's sex because her dress is beautiful and doesn't want is to be ruind for the party, the pretending girl finally kills the father.
What did the friend said? You killed my father.
But then again she was thanksful.
She was finally releived from the devil. That was a sweet taboo devil that she cannot resist.
She felt into that moster but at the same time he was a devil inside her all her life.

Being crazy, the mother half doped tells the police that she killed the husband.

The problem solved?

And then this really surprising end that I won't reveal.

8159394,4,B000KX0IP4,"In the wake of any hit movie there are numerous movies that instantly get green lit that are similar, take Scream for instance, no sooner than that film became a phenomenon we got I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, Valentine, etc. Well in the wake of American Beauty's success we got a number of movies set in the suburbs about upper middle class people and the secrets and anxiety's they may hide like The Chumscrubber, Mini's First Time, Pretty Persuasion, as well as The Quiet which may be the best of the bunch.

The story focuses on a teenage girl (Camila Bell) who seemingly has lost the ability to speak after a tragedy who goes to live with a family in the suburbs consisting of the parents and a teenage daughter (Elisha Cuthbert.) Because of her inability to speak everyone in the family including a teenage boy at her school confesses all of their secrets to her feeling that they're safe seeing how she doesn't speak, the idea being she probably cannot hear all that well either, but unbeknownst to all of them, she hears and speaks just find, just choosing not to do the former.

The film plays pretty smoothly with a beautiful yet dark mood, with good cinematography, dreamy score, and good acting with perfect casting.
As you watch the film seeing more and more characters confessing their sins to the lead you can't help but to feel like something horrible is just around the corner, particularly a situation involving the teenage girl (Cuthbert) and her Father.

The only strike I would give this film is a little choppy editing, but besides that, if your into Suburban Angst films this is a good one to check out.",1440633600,2,1643,4.61986301369863
