8570785,5,B00BMEF7TW,"One of my favorite Jean Arthur movies and costars are great also!  The guys held their own with her.  She is a wonderful dramatic actress, but I love her comedies.",1453420800,2,163,4.4
8570786,4,B00BMEF7TW,"How did one guy give this one star?  While not a classic by any means this is actually as funny as My Favorite Wife with Arthur, Douglas, and MacMurray all in good form.  Nice supporting work is also given by Harry Davenport and Melville Cooper.  Yes the plot is somewhat preposterous, but what screwball comedy isn't?  There are bunch of funny scenes and it moves swiftly.  The only recommendation I'll make is to get it in the four movie set with ""If you only could cook"" and two Rosalind Russell comedies.  That set is a bargain.",1447286400,3,532,4.489583333333333

8570789,5,B00BMEF7TW,"This is a great movie! I loved every second of it. I like it better than ""My Favorite Wife"", which is also a really good movie. But, not as good as this one.",1401408000,4,157,3.787878787878788
8570790,1,B00BMEF7TW,"My wife and I are huge Jean Arthur fans.  She is hands down our favorite actress of all time.  We own most of her most popular films and were excited to discover that several more of her movies have now become available on DVD.  ""Too Many Husbands"" sounded like a hoot and we eagerly looked forward to seeing it.  We were expecting big belly laughs throughout.  Unfortunately this was not the case at all.  While Melvyn Douglas was OK as ""second"" husband Henry Lowndes I thought that Fred MacMurray turned in a very forgettable performance as ""first"" husband Bill Cardew.  I am told that this is supposed to be a classic ""screwball"" comedy but unfortunately I would be hard pressed to characterize this one as even mildly amusing.  Most surprising to us was that even the great Jean Arthur failed to impress.  While my wife and I were able to muster a chuckle every now and then for the most part this film turned out to be a real drag.  ""Too Many Husbands"" cannot hold a candle to the Cary Grant-Irene Dunne classic ""My Favorite Wife"" which for obvious reasons this film has often been compared to.  The writing left a lot to be desired. We kept waiting for this film to get better but it simply never did.  It pains me to say this but this one turns out to be a real dud.  Not recommended.",1399766400,2,1291,4.39662447257384
