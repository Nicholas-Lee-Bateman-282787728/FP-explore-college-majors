7990756,3,B00009AV8Z,"Michael Muhney shows his potential talent in this early film. This film is low budget independent college film about sex, relationships, and friendship. Michael plays Andrew on location at Northern Illinois University in Dekalb, Illinois. The film is pretty low budget but it's a noteworthy effort. Andrew ends up spending the night with Shayna, the girl of his nerdy roommate's dreams, while they are there on Thanksgiving break. The fall colors show up naturally in the background.

Sure, the writing appears predictable and weak at some points in the film. Low budget movies are lucky to get a name at all. Michael Muhney was started his acting career at this point in 2000. He plays Andrew with a lot more depth than most actors do. The supporting cast of characters are fine with their roles. Most of the cast is relatively young adults. I would have liked to have seen older characters or familiar faces from the Chicago theatre scene.

Still it's a short, flawed, but entertaining film. The ending is predictable as usual. There were no extras in the DVD.",1409184000,,1062,4.861878453038674
7990757,5,B00009AV8Z,"I'm showing my support for Michael Muhney by putting my money where my mouth is, and buying up all the movies and shows I can find that he's in. That said, this is a rather slight romantic comedy about college romance. I have to say it reminded me of some of my own missteps in college dating. If you like Michael Muhney and romantic comedies, I highly recommend it.",1393718400,,366,4.318840579710145
7990758,5,B00009AV8Z,"This is a super fun college movie. Great for college age people or for people that want to relive that part of our lives. Michael Muhney shines as Andrew, the dorm hound dog who has a one night stand with his room-mates dream girl. Great acting by the talented cast of young actors. Well worth watching.",1328140800,,303,4.428571428571429
