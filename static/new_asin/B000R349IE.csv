2858160,5,B000R349IE,"Clive Cussler is the man who not only spearheads the diving expeditions you will view on these tremendously engaging DVDs,but he also opens and closes each segment. Cussler is well known as a bestselling author and a man with a passion for the sea and its history,specifically shipwrecks,and he has found many famous ones on his own. With his experienced dive team you will follow them into some daunting and sometimes dangerous expeditions to find wrecks hitherto undiscovered. This three disc DVD collection,all in slim packs and all in a larger cardboard insert,has its focus on WW2. Here are the eps included in this collection:
Ship of Ice-This ep focuses on the prototype of a larger ship that was to be constructed,whose main means of buoyancy was ice blocks. The idea was to eventually build an aircraft carrier of ice to combat the dangerous wolf packs of WW2. The prototype lies at the bottom of Patricia Lake in Alberta.
Diving the V-2 Rocket Caves-When Peenemunde,the location of the launch and development site of the V-1 and V-2 rockets was bombed by the Allies,their assembly factories were moved a few miles away to a location of caves. The team explores the caves,now mostly submerged. In this ep also they discover outside,frozen in a shallow lake,the remnants of a Lancaster bomber.
Leopoldville/Clayquot-The team dives on two wrecks which coincidentally both fell victim to German subs on Xmas eve of /44,one near Nova Scotia,the other on the other side of the Atlantic,having set out from England.
Minesweeper Eddy-This is a dive on a minesweeper which itself succumbed to a mine while clearing a harbour off Malta.
The Wihelm Gustloff-This is the German pleasure-built ship turned into a refugee ship,fleeing the advancing Russians. They didn't get out quick enough as a Russian sub sank the ship in the Baltic,with the largest maritime loss of lives EVER.
Force Z-The team dives the wrecks of the British ships Repulse and Prince of Wales who were sank in the South China Sea in /41.
Juno Beach-The team explores the area of the Canadian D-Day landings,farther off shore and finds some fascinating things.
U-Boat 215-The team attempts to find a rare D7 Class German U Boat. Only about 1/2 dozen were ever built and they were unique in that they had five tubes with which they could lay mines,and this one is the only one on the western side of the Atlantic and in Canadian waters at that.
Disc three contains two extras and they are:a Clive Cussler bio and most importantly extra footage from each segment.
There are some pretty unnerving moments on these DVDs,such as when they dive on wrecks at night in pitch blackness,or fishermen warn the divers about the potential of running into sharks. But if you or some member of your family loves history,finding it,diving for it or just diving in general,this is a must see. They will keep you totally enthralled from beginning to end. Highly recommended.",1326499200,2,2924,4.909090909090909
2858161,5,B000R349IE,"This series is a fine visual presentation detailing the history of ships that have influenced our modern world. It begins with a lively introduction by Mr. Cussler himself that shows his obvious enthusiasm for the subject matter at hand.  Join James Delgado and his team of divers as they explore these wrecks and carry the viewer back in time for a remarkable underwater tour. I have been a wreck diver all of my life and found this to be well photographed and narrated. I recommend this DVD set to anyone who has an imagination and a sense of adventure. It has been a fine addition to my video library and will be to yours too.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wreck-Hunters-Dive-to-the-Wreck-of-the-USS-Bass/dp/B00079RC1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wreck Hunters: Dive to the Wreck of the USS Bass</a>",1224028800,6,854,5.671875

2858163,5,B000R349IE,"This set has episode with very unique subjects. These are not the usual but sites like the last resting places of the Prince of Wales and the Repulse, an ocean liner sunk by the Russians at the end of the war and even the flooded remains of a V-2 rocket factory in a cave. I won't spoil the surprise by telling you the rest.
If you found the dives on the Bismarck and the Titanic interesting, you'll love this. This is for anyone who loves sea stories, history and or archaeology.",1204329600,13,480,4.285714285714286

8198687,5,B000R349IE,"I watched the 13 available episodes on the only DVD set which is available and wonder why they don't sell all 38 episodes that have been produced on DVD? I don't want them on instant, I prefer having them on DVD to watch them more than once. I'm sure I'm not the only person who feels like this.
Hope this is not a new trend that continues and increases over time (I recently noticed that a lovely movie with James Stewart and Brigitte Bardot, ""Dear Brigitte"" is only available on amazon instant :( :( :( ).
Please release TV series on DVD and not only on instant!",1328054400,,564,4.280373831775701
