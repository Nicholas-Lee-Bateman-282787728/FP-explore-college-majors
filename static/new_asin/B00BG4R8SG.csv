5615921,4,B00BG4R8SG,"The story of a matchmaker who is trying to make a match of a rich man for herself has been tyold in several versions, but certainly the most famous is the stage and film musical.  I will throw in the obligatory ""Streisand was too young for the part"" but it is her personality and the part of the character she is portraying that keeps the movie together from beginning to end.  This is possibly the last of the golden age of musicals.

I've done a comparison of the DVD and the Blu-ray and the video and audio differences are incredible.  The Blu-ray picture and sound are many steps above the DVD.  Colors are spectacular.

The extras (a brief but tantalizing look at the making of the ""Before the Parade Passes By"" musical number and some trailers) have been carried over from the DVD and upgraded to high definition, which is very satisyfying.  There is also a new featurette for the Blu on Gene Kelly direction the film.

Highly recommended.",1365811200,14,945,4.550295857988166
5615922,5,B00BG4R8SG,"I saw this movie when it first came out...visiting a friend in Philadelphia; Joe had just been ordained a priest, and one night he and I went to see the film.  We both enjoyed it; I loved it!  But I've always loved Barbra Streisand.  Hers is the voice against which all others are judged...and come up short.  And, as ""Dolly,"" ""Funny Girl,"" and ""On A Clear Day"" prove...she was born to be costumed!  Barbra's voice in the aforementioned musicals is at its prime.  That glorious sound, her beauty, her sense of comic timing...she lets you forget weaknesses in ""Dolly"" and ""Clear Day"" especially.  Now out on Blu-Ray, ""Hello, Dolly"" should live once more for the spectacular display it is of a vocal talent the likes of which we may never see again.",1365811200,,747,4.613636363636363
5615923,5,B00BG4R8SG,"HELLO DOLLY! My first introduction to Miss. Barbra Streisand! A flop of it time, and one of the last big expensive Hollywood musical, is finally out on Blu-ray and never look better!

Directed by Gene Kelly, starring Barbra Streisand, Walter Matthau, Michael Crawford, and guest appearance Louis Armstrong, it was the most expensive musical ever produced at that time! Everything could be seen on screen, such as the parade and the Harmonia Gardens Restaurant set! The dance numbers is a joy to watch, well shot with wonderful choreography. Too bad it was released at a bad time, when US was deep into Vietnam wars and flowers power was in full swing, no one was into happy happy musical. Oscar Best Picture for that year was MIDNIGHT COWBOY. One could see the sentiment then. Otherwise it was well made and quite entertaining!

Well remastered and properly framed at TODD-AO 2.20 (listed as 2.35 on package), detail is fantastic! Just look at Barbra clothing! The DTS-HD MA 5.1 sound great too! Little extras though - an interview with film historian and Gene Kelly window DIRECTING DOLLY: GENE KELLY REMEMBERED (New), a 1969 featurette, trailers in English and Spanish (from DVD). All extras are in HD. The only extra not port over from DVD is Fox Flix - a few Fox musical movie trailers. If that is not important to you, you can safely off load your old 2003 DVD.

The single Blu-ray was packed in an eco-Blu-ray case - those with holes! DON'T PRESS TOO HARD!

Highly recommended for musical and Barbra fans!",1365724800,5,1511,4.777777777777778
5615924,5,B00BG4R8SG,"What can anyone say about the lady who has so much talent that even when she isn't working, her previous work keeps getting her more fans. Hello Dolly is so well done that I am sure I will continue to watch it often as I do all her work. The music is fantastic and seeing Louie Armstrong do the song with Barbra just made it that much better. What a team. Michael Crawford was great and I would never have thought he would have such a great future in Phantom Of The Opera on Broadway. WOW! Can understand why it was so well done as Gene Kelly was the director. Barbra's dresses are something very special to see. Someone had a lot of work to do and did it very well. This film is in the same class as Funny Girl, Singing In The Rain, South Pacific, Sound Of Music and so many more classics. If you have never experienced this film, it is time you enjoyed a great musical. Get To Work..............",1365465600,2,897,4.190751445086705
5615925,5,B00BG4R8SG,"Excellent in all the right places. Congratulations to 20Th Century-Fox for the exceptional blu ray version of Hello,Dolly! The picture and sound are truly impressive. Like many other reviewers have stated, like seeing the film for the first time. The picture quality is as perfect as the technology of today can bring to home entertainment.  The sound was incredible! There was instruments I never picked up on before that brought such greatness to the fine orchestrations throughout our time travel back to years gone by. Thank you Mr. Kelly for your dedication to your art.

I am truly becoming a great admirer of the blu ray. This title has made me loyal of that. Now I've ordered What's Up, Doc? On blu ray and hope it is as sharp and clear as Hello,Dolly! is. Next to come Funny Girl. Heres hoping for the same review as this one.

A must for any film buff library.",1365206400,,870,4.6
5615926,5,B00BG4R8SG,"Just received my blu ray copy of DOLLY and am really impressed. The color, clarity and quality of the new high def transfer is terrific. The show is entertaining as ever and Streisand shows everyone what talent is all about. What a presence she has onscreen! And the title number is one of the biggest showstoppers in theatre AND movie history. No, it's not up there with WEST SIDE STORY or SOUND OF MUSIC, but it has charms of its own...and it is HUGE! The production values are magnificent. And it's all real. No CGI. That NYC set was actually constructed...as was the Yonkers set. And wow to the Harmonia Gardens sequence. In terms of opulence, DOLLY is an eye-popper. So is CLEOPATRA, the next big blu ray from 20th Century Fox. Can't wait for that. Oh, and a word about the packaging. Why not a blu ray book? CAMELOT had one. Hell, even NATURAL BORN KILLERS was treated to a special book. And why so few extras? A history of the show? Profile of Ernest Lehman? Interview with the cast? And the cover of the bluray is further evidence of how the studios had NO IDEA how to market a classic. The photo-shopped, cut and paste pictures are a lousy representation of the film. DOLLY had a marvelous color logo graphic that would have made a terrific cover. Instead, it appears in a tiny display on the back. Note to Hollywood---use the original graphics when marketing a classic. The art departments were far better back then and the boomers (who are the intended audience for these products) will respond to the original artwork because THAT IS WHAT THEY RECOGNIZE. I won't even get started with the awful artwork on the new GREAT ESCAPE bluray.",1364947200,6,1646,4.583050847457627

5615929,1,B00BG4R8SG,"Believe me I'm not trying to be negative here but I think this is one of the biggest movie disasters of all time. This film killed movie musicals until ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Chicago"" took the bad taste out of the world's mouth. And as such it's enjoyable as rubbernecking any train wreck can be. The picture is totally miscast in EVERY role. The level of acting is at that of an average high school play. Rent this film just to experience the horror of Michael Crawford's performance. What was he thinking? Is he trying to act retarded? This is truly one of the most embarrassing performances of all time. I'm surprised he ever worked again. Sure Bab's has a great voice but being in her twenties destroys the whole plot of being middle aged and this is her last chance at a husband. And sorry, life achievement award or not, she can't act. See this one for the HORROR ...and the unintentional laughs.",1361664000,8,899,4.521472392638037

The Blu-Ray is respectable but perhaps not based on 8K scans as the latest release of My Fair Lady, where you could almost feel the texture of the wallpaper!

The extras provided detail some production secrets and back story but don't buy it for that, buy it to preserve the classic for enjoyment over a lifetime.

From the Singing/Dancing waiters to the antics of Dolly, please be warned that it will take a while to get the great music theme out of your head.  But what's so bad about that!  Enjoy",1504051200,,640,4.482758620689655

5615935,5,B00BG4R8SG,"I actually saw the original film release in 1969. Wonderful movie, but so utterly out of place during the Vietnam/Nixon/Hard Rock era. The passage of time has been good. Now it can be seen as a step back in time to a long-ago era, like an old operetta.

Streisand reportedly never cared for the film, but she's actually fantastic. Yes, she's incongruously young, but she looks great, dances like a pro, tosses off her lines with the appropriate comedy or poignancy. AND THAT VOICE! She just soars like a comet.

The BlueRay is quite an improvement over the original, and also fine, DVD.",1499644800,,586,4.679611650485437

5615945,4,B00BG4R8SG,A wonderful musical. Excellent performances. I was a little disappointed in the transfer from the film. The colors are accurate but not beautiful and bright. The sound is fine but not the dynamic range of Dolby. This is one of Hollywood's last big musicals and it was done right. I am a Walter Matthau fan but many have rightly questioned if he was the best choice to play the male lead. It's a wonderful show and you can't get better than Streisand's singing along with Michael Crawford and the rest of the cast. Let's hope for a better transfer in the future but for now enjoy a great show.,1487030400,,592,4.440366972477064

5615956,4,B00BG4R8SG,"My mother really liked this movie.  I thought it was okay, but nothing that really grabbed my attention.  I don't know why.  I think it's because I found Streisand appealing and annoying all at once.  She fun, she's kind of cute in a New York sort of way, but she's meant to be a Jewish matchmaker, and I think that's the thing that's never really flatly stated up front, but just inferred by Walter Matthau's and Streisand's presence (extremely odd, since in the end they get married in a church instead of a synagogue).

The jokes are funny, clever and carry into the musical numbers which are rich in whit.  But the parading of effete male dancers (many of whom I'm sure were hetero family men) coupled with a kind of tame melodrama, just has me sitting in front of the TV wondering when this thing is going to be over with.  Why?  Eh, I grew up on westerns and sci-fi, so I'm not what you'd call a big musical fan, though I do like specific films in the genre.

It's just that the reserve culture of turn of the (1900) century America that is supposed to be celebrated, gets a little annoying.  It's light hearted, so we don't get perilous scene of ladies being tied to railroad tracks nor stove pipe hat and cap wearing villains running off with the deed and mortgage to some down and out family.  Instead we get the courtship ritual turned on its head, and to fun effect.  ""Stuffed whale ... wow!""

You can't fault it for its effort too much, but it's too much effort at times that I find fault with.  The lines are delivered with an honesty and zing that make the film palatable, but the vaudevillian take on reserved WASPY late 19th century America, eh ... just seems over the top, even for a musical.

Even so, I enjoyed it on its own level, but unless it's a Sunday afternoon, with a sofa, tall glass of lemonade, and air conditioning on a hot summer day, I'll probably pass up another viewing.",1475366400,,1904,4.384615384615385

5615963,3,B00BG4R8SG,"Unfortunately, if ever a film had no reason to be, it is this one.  Don't get me wrong, it is impecably produced and lovely to look at but: here is the bad news.  It is horribly cast:  most notably the pathetic Michael Crawford and a terribly weak Irene Malloy.  Even though Streisand is mis cast, she makes the film watchable.  The direction is topsy turvey especially the Sunday Clothes number.  The Dolly number is way too long and no need for Louis Armstrong.  The It Only Takes a Moment number should have adhered to its title, a complete waste of celuloid mostly because we had to endure more of Crawford.  The two main factors here are the stage show was a monster hit despite it being based on very weak material.  I assume it became a hit because of Gower Champion's brilliant staging and it was just a feel good show.  This does not translate well  to the screen even though Ernest Lehman did his dardnest to make it work.  The film was rushed into production and opening before the show closed.  If they had taken a bit more time and thought it out better and cast it properly, maybe it would have turned out better.  As far as the BLU RAY transfer? Specatacular!  And that alone makes it worth having along with Barbra.",1461369600,3,1231,4.433035714285714

5615972,1,B00BG4R8SG,"After discovering the fabulous ""My Fair Lady"" Blu-Ray, I ran out and tried another favorite classic musical, ""Hello, Dolly!"". After waiting and waiting for the disc to arrive, we put it into the player and watched 20 seconds before I ran for my DVD disc and loaded it in the DVD player for comparison. It did not take long, and sadly, the blu-ray disc was left in the dust! We play our DVDs with a Sony upconvert player, so it is a better picture quality than a typical DVD player. However, the blu-ray was still very disappointing.

The blu-ray gave you the feeling of an over-sharpened picture, when there is no detail to enhance. It looked clearer on the first glance, however, at the second you could see that it was just heightened sharpness and not true detail. We tried the title song sequence, with Streisand coming down the stairs in the gold dress. In the blu-ray, she looked like she had a very yellow dress on, with white fabric gloves. She also had a terrible skin tone which made her look like she was deathly ill. Switching to the DVD, you could see that the dress was sparkling gold and that her gloves were actually white kid leather. Her skin tone also looked healthy, with some colour. The reds of the carpet and the assorted uniforms on the male chorus looked over-saturated on the blu-ray. They had no detail in them and looked like a computer game. The DVD gave them back some detail and they looked like fabric.

We never even critiqued the audio quality, as the picture was so poor, I would never have watched the blu-ray for audio alone. Overall, a very disappointing blu-ray transfer. As we explore the new world of classic films on blu-ray, it seems that the majority fall behind good quality DVD releases. Blu-Rays tend to have over-contrasted pictures and over-saturated colour tones. Gene Kelly would be very disappointed to see his film look like this BR release.",1444867200,3,1894,4.633928571428571

I was already stunned by the marvelous transfer, which compares favorably to the spectacular 70mm print that UCLA recently showed, but then I reached the intermission, and the entr'acte played against a black and blank screen.

Overture, Intermission, exit music...just a wonderful experience. It was so good that the entire audience gave it a standing ovation...something I had never seen before.

Reduction prints left that out. Correct me if I am wrong but if a theater owner paid Cinerama a fee a Todd AO film could be advertised as being shown in Cinerama. They did it at a chain theater in Toledo with a showing of Mike Todd's Around the World in Eighty Days. It was advertised in the paper as being shown in Cinerama for the first time. Anyway, Hello Dolly looked great on the Cinerama screen and for anyone to see it presented in the same manner today would knock your socks off. The DVD home video version I have looks good even though it's a flat picture. I for one am a fan of David Strohmaiers use of the Smilebox format to give the original 3 strip Cinerama films the feel of watching them on a curved screen as intended. He also has remastered Holiday in Spain originally released by Mike Todd Jr as Scent of Mystery in Todd-70 and then converted to 3 strip Cinerama. David Strohmaier used a combination of 65mm negatives and 70mm prints to reassemble a decent reconstruction of the film and then give it the SmileBox treatment to replicate the way audiences saw it as a ""Cinerama"" film. I know, naysayers despise any 70mm film being shown as a Cinerama film but that was a part of film history when Cinerama decided to end the use of the cumbersome 3 camera process for 70mm film giving them more flexibility with filming than the three magazine Cinerama camera had. To condemn the use of 70mm film being shown on the Cinerama screen would be the same as saying it never existed. On a large screen TV the SmileBox effect works well. If you have a 3 D set you can convert the image to simulated 3D. I then select the option to use minimal 3D simulation. Then with the lights out in has the effect of an actual curved screen coming out of your wall. It improves the curved screen simulation immensely. That is my perspective of how fun it was to go to a movie when it was a real show. Now you have to suffer through what seems an eternity of ads before a movie starts...THEN an endless parade of trailers and finally the feature. Most theater screens might be up to 40' wide but not much wider much less curved. To quote Mike Todd: ""You're In The Show With Todd AO."" I t truly was once a show going to the movies.",1418342400,,2974,4.3894927536231885

A little uneven or a little too like Mae West, Barbra still works her musical magic. Maybe if Gene Kelly were to have spoken with William Wyler, who adored Barbra like a granddaughter, he might have learned that Barbra was a talent with ""the goods."" Vincente Minnelli did, and her ""Clear Day"" performance was breath-taking. One wouldn't think the Jerry Herman score would fit the Streisand vocal sensibility, but it's utterly perfect. This blu-ray really shows off this former Todd-AO beauty at it best. I saw it opening night on a Cinerama screen, and this captures the ""big screen"" delight perfectly in each production number.

 young to take on this role, especially after Carol Channing made it her own on Broadway, and touring the
country.  Certainly Ms. Channing made the iconic Dolly Levi come alive on stage.
But Ms. Streisand made this part her own on film, and is a sheer delight to watch,
and hear her singular take on this character. Her duet with Louis Armstrong during the title song is not to be missed.  Brava ms. Streisand in thefilm, and brava Ms Channing on stage.

Gene Kelly directed the film, and his experience in musicals shows in this grand production.  The video is crisp and clean with beautiful color renditions.  The soundtrack is simply superb, with vocals that seem to jump out at you during the Hello Dolly sequence.  You'd swear you're in the room with them singing to Streisand.  Highly recommended!",1368144000,,638,4.592920353982301
5616123,5,B00BG4R8SG,"Quite simply this is THE BEST that HELLO DOLLY! has ever looked on home video.  It's very apparent that a lot of love, time, care and money was lavished over this restoration.  70mm titles are the ones that seem to look especially robust on Blu-ray (take for instance Fox's earlier Blu release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sound-of-Music/dp/B003VS0CX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sound of Music</a>&nbsp;and the forthcoming&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cleopatra/dp/B00BGDDCWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cleopatra</a>).  DOLLY was filmed in the 70mm Todd-AO system and has yielded a gorgeous transfer on Blu which must be quite close to how the film looked in it's original 1969 theatrical release.

The movie gets better with age.  Barbra Streisand has been given plenty of flack, ever since the movie was first announced, for 'stealing' away the role of Dolly from original Broadway star Carol Channing - but it's actually her performance which has kept the film fresh for so long.  Streisand adopted a ""Mae West"" flavour for the key to play Dolly, and the decision was inspired.  Walter Matthau matches her step-for-step with his downplayed but still hilarious turn as Horace Vandergelder.

Michael Crawford and Marianne McAndrew are lovely as Cornelius and Mrs Molloy (although McAndrews' ill-fitting dubbed singing voice robs her of some impact during her musical numbers - it's a couple of hairs higher than her regular speaking voice).  Pocket-sized dance dynamos Danny Lockin and E.J. Peaker are outstanding as Barnaby and Minnie Faye.

We'll never see such opulence or excess on the screen again.  Musicals were fast becoming a dying breed in 1969 but the quality of the designs in DOLLY's sets and costumes are on display in Hi-Def glory here.  It is truly eye-popping.  You can literally see all the threads in Dolly's golden Harmonia Gardens gown.  It surely cannot get better than this.

If you haven't seen DOLLY before, this Blu-ray will be an ideal way to introduce yourself.  If you're already on familiar terms with the old gal, you'll be floored at how she sparkles anew.  My highest recommendation.",1367884800,9,2220,5.678787878787879
5616124,5,B00BG4R8SG,"One of the best sights and sounds on Blu-ray.  Movie was panned in its day because Barbra was too young.  Funny, looks like she could have filmed it yesterday.",1367798400,,159,4.448275862068965
5616125,3,B00BG4R8SG,"They yelled.  They were right.

She's too this.  Too that.  Too much the other thing.  Whatever it was, Streisand was most certainly miscast in the role.

Her voice, however, was not.  And this is why the detractors retreat and the yay-sayers come to the fore.

Miscast?  Yes.  Perfectly suited to the score?  Undoubtedly.

She really IS too young.  But once you get passed that you can enjoy a musical performance that has the ability to thrill you.  Her voice is sublime.  She can handle this score upside-down.  And that's saying something as it's a helluva score (though I like Herman's ""Mame"" score better).

Greivances:  Tommy Tune.  Too ""Broadway"".  The characters of ""Mr. Hackle"" and ""Mr. Tucker"", while necessary, are given too much useless screen time. And neither one can sing and both act far to stupid for their supposed age.  And their love interests as well; ""Ribbons Down My Back"" is a nowhere song.  All of which puts ""Dolly"" shamefully in the background as they are up to so many shenanigans.  Gene Kelly, who directed, should have known better.

Very little chemistry, if any, is observed between Babs and Walter Matthau, her ugly love interest.  It's bad casting.  Too bad Gene Kelly himself didn't play this role.  Or Christopher Plummer.  Or Walter Pidgeon.  Or Carl Reiner.  Or ANYONE other that Walter Matthau, who didn't enjoy the job (so goes the legend) and neither did Streisand (so goes the legend).  I wasn't there.  I'll never know.

Barbra was criticized for playing Dolly as Fanny Brice/Mae West/Barbra Streisand.  I agree with that verdict.  The gargantuan role must have overwhelmed her and Carol Channing, really, should have had it.  But Streisand got it and Hollywood said ""oh....wait a minute here....."" and Streisand got a backlash of bad publicity.  Because of everything I have just said.  The Brice/West/Streisand thing.  Bab's going after the role without care (so they say; I don't think so.  Channing had no box office power, movie wise, and Streisand did).

Still, it's a fun musical, if a bit long.  Kelly directs it as if it were 1944 and producer Roger Edens obviously opened up the checkbook.  But so many songs are too long or unnecessary.  Still, it's Streisand at the top of her form and oh sweet baby Jesus that voice has GOT to thrill you!!!!!!!!!!!!",1367712000,,2306,4.862694300518135
