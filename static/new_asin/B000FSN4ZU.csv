8126199,3,B000FSN4ZU,"Munnabhai (Sanjay Dutt) is a Mumbai mob boss busy on the job when he bumps into and instantly falls in love with Komal (Aishwarya Rai). Thereafter, visions of her appear in inopportune moments, such as when he's in the middle of pursuing his unlawful activities. Komal's image inevitably chastises him and his crooked tendencies and makes him apologize to his would-be victims. To rid himself of this malady (which is speedily ruining his criminal empire), Munna sees a physician, Dr. Rastogi (Amitabh Bachchan). Dr. Rastogi advises the don to woo the girl, not knowing that she, by sheer coincidence, is his younger sister Komal. Munna, however, steps on a thorn on his path to love. Komal is in love with Raja (Ajay Devgan), who returns the favor but is unwilling to marry her because of his unworthy status. Everything comes to a boil when Rastogi takes Komal to Malaysia to be married off, putting Munna and Raja in a catastrophic bind. The plot becomes more intense when Raja challenges Munna for Komal, never mind that Munna is a powerful underworld don.

Hum Kisise Kum Nahin can be viewed only with a grain of salt and a tongue in cheek. The film falls a bit short of realizing its goal of frothy, comedic lightheartedness. What it has to offer are wild coincidences, a half-realized romance, stereotypical sidekicks and cheesy, telegraphed fight scenes accompanied by corny sound effects. It also indulges in implausibilities such as the peaceful, friendly Dr. Rastogi, out of the blue, efficiently kicking the tush of a thug in one bewildering scene (unless that was an inside joke about Mr. Bachchan that I've missed out on). Also hard to swallow are several scenes wherein Munna, having channeled Bugs Bunny, somehow kept foiling Raja and Komal's attempts to get married. From a dvd technical aspect, the subpar work of the sub-titles is a hindrance to the viewer's full enjoyment of the film.

The good news is that Hum Kisise... stars three actors whom I enjoy tremendously: Amitabh Bachchan, Ajay Devgan and Aish. This is the fourth movie I've seen now with Amitabh Bachchan and I've yet to see him repeat himself. I can't wait to see the much touted Black. And after Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Raincoat, the pair of Devgan and Rai is in my Romantic Couple Hall of Fame. Having said that, though, I must admit I feel their chemistry here is a tad lukewarm. I'm new to Sanjay Dutt but I felt he ably injected Munna with equal doses of love-struck buffoonery, rough kindheartedness and practical ruthlessness. But neither he, Devgan nor Mr. Bachchan can dance worth a lick, which is okay because Aish dances superbly enough to make up for the whole cast.

Not much in the way of special features here. There's a second disc but its contents comprise only of a ""Making Of"" feature and a segment on the film's TV promos. I liked three of the six songs. O Sapno Ke is the most tuneful of the lot and spotlights the unsurpassed Aishwarya Rai. Ye Kya Ho Raha Hai is an amusing number wherein Raja and Komal plead their case to a disapproving Rastogi. Mein Sohni Tu has a determined Munna endlessly butting in on Raja and Komal.

Folks desiring to see these actors in superior films should check out Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, Raincoat, Khakee, I Have Found It, Kuch Naa Kaho, Chokher Bali and Devdas (yes, I know; most of these titles are Aish movies; so sue me, they're good).",1150156800,,3382,4.70777027027027
