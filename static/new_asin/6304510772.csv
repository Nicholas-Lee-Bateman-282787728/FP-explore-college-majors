893203,3,6304510772,"Having been a fan of the Vampirella magazine for many years, I was happy to see it renewed as a comic book.  Imagine my joy to see it on the big screen!  Unfortunately, that joy was short-lived because the movie is quite low budget with a simple screenplay.
As in the fanzine, Vampirella is from the planet Drakulon, and the movie covers here beginning there.  The love between her and Van Helsing, as well as her use of a formula to avoid the need for human blood, is discussed as well.  She even goes against her arch-nemesis, Vlad, who is played here by Roger Daltry.
The choice of Roger Daltry puzzled me.  He seems to have been chosen so that the director can make Vlad a rock star, which is not from the Vampirella story, but from Anne Rice's Lestat.  Why to producers of this movie wanted this in their adaptation is odd since there is only one scene where he sings.
There is brief nudity, but it seems more gratuitous than artistic or necessary.  Moreover, one of the actresses baring herself has no use to the plot whatsoever than that one moment.
If you are a fan of Vampirella, I would recommend giving this movie a skip.  If you are a fan of low-budget horror, then you might want to give this one a look.",1053475200,11,1217,4.353982300884955
893204,1,6304510772,"The name of the movie sounded familiar but it did not register to me that it was a comic book character. I was originaly impressed by the cover, I am a big horror/vampire movie fan. After I found out what the movie was by reading the reviews on amazon I watched the movie in fast forward looking for cool parts in the movie. Other than two topless scenes I fast forwarded through the whole movie. It was of very poor quality. Don't get me wrong I love B movies but this one was just bad. I wish I wouldn't have wasted my [money].",1026000000,3,529,4.145631067961165
893205,2,6304510772,"Only buy this movie if you absolutely LOVE the comic version (I do).  This satisfied my need to see Vampirella in a film but that was about it.  Talisa Soto as Vampirella was the only good acting in this whole movie.  She really did a good job (but then she always does).  The rest ranged from unbelievable.  I really find it hard to believe that after spending several thousand years on earth the head vampires would be this stupid.  Unless you have a penchant for Ms. Soto or the Original character this one isn't going to tak eyou anywhere, I wouyldn't even recommend it to general vampire movie fans.",989107200,11,604,4.495412844036697
893206,5,6304510772,"That's a very interesting question. And the movie answers that. It is a good movie because it entertains,and we all know that movies are made with the sole intent to amuse us. Of course,if they had had a whopping budget available at that time,this movie would have been better and maybe on every horror/sci-fi buff's list. The heroine is beautiful,does her job properly,and her acting is good. The effects are ok. The concept of an underground catholic militia whose main mission is to rid the world  of the pesky bloodsuckers must be original,because the movie was made 2 years before John Carpenter's VAMPIRES( I loved it too).Besides,there is lots of creativity and other interesting ideas that surprise and make up for the lack of money. John Landis (the famous movie director ) has a cameo role in it. Jim Wynorski is an accomplished director,because he always makes good  movies ( THE HAUNTING OF MORELLA,THE RETURN OF THE SWAMP THING,for instance  )using very little money. Vampirella is a good movie. Ignore those bad reviews. Those guys just want to tear other people's works to pieces. Some even don't pay attention to the details and to the story. You may ask,if it's good,why 5 stars ? Because it's a new and daring way to talk about the same subjects. And the price ? Ah,yes,steep,but I don't care. The movie is good and in my collection now.",984700800,,1355,4.782051282051282
893207,1,6304510772,"All I have to say is that this movie shouldn't have been made. REALLY bad script! REALLY bad actors and actresses. And of course,even the costume was incorrect. Vampirellla has been around for a while. They could've did much better than this. Natrually the bad aspect of this movie nullifies any sequels done correctly.",977529600,2,319,4.925925925925926
893208,3,6304510772,"If you like vampires you might like this movie.  If you like morose, moody vampires verbosely brooding over deep, dark gothic secrets that they long  to share with mortals, who would never understand them, then this movie  probably isn't for you.  If you like science fiction action/adventure,  where a gorgeous female in a shiny red costume saves the universe from  malicious destruction, then this is your kind of movie.
Alright, so Vlad  only wants to destroy one planet.  We've still got a good action/adventure  story where the female is more than just a doll. The quality is much  superiour to what one might expect, although the acting is a little uneven  in places, the suspense does not build up as much as the concept would  promise, and the special effects are a little on the economical side  (better than BBC but nowhere near Babylon 5 standards.)  The storyline is  great, the dialog is well-written, and the actors are convincing most of  the time.
This is definitely a science fiction movie, not a horror film.  The other reviews show that people either like it or hate it.  I'm one of  those who really liked this movie, despite it's obvious flaws.",940809600,11,1165,4.763819095477387
893366,2,6304510772,"Even with the names involved and the inclusion of Talisa Soto as the lead, not even mentioned as a major contributor here oddly and former PMOY Corinna Hanley received more credit, and Roger Daltery as Vlad could not help me finish this. I had the film on for maybe fifteen minutes and could not watch anymore. Huge fan of the comic books, from Warren to Dark Horse to Harris pub, and happy to call many involved in creatives my friends I could not bear the campy feel; and I think that's bad considering I watch many B movies and Toho Studios offerings. For the true fan at heart I guess and will try again to see if my opinion changes.",1322006400,,637,4.316666666666666
893367,2,6304510772,It's everything one would expect from a B movie : bad special effects and horrible acting. Some of the minor characters did pretty good acting wise but unless one is a fan of Talisa Soto or Roger Daltrey or just vampires this is probably not the movie for you.,1316390400,,260,4.326530612244898
893368,2,6304510772,"Vampirella tells the tale of the planet Draculon where the entire population are vampires. The rivers on the planet are filled with biomatter aka blood so Draculon is a peaceful place. Ella is the daughter of the planet's leader, unfortunately he get murdered when Draculon's worst criminal Vlad escapes from the courtroom and then run off in a space ship, Ella swears revenge and follows Vlad and both parties end up on Earth. Most of the movie is about Ella or Vampirella as she begins to call herself trying to track down Vlad to put an end to his evil schemes, to do this she join forces with a vampire hunter organization. The plot itself is rather ok, it is rather cheesy and campy but it is still good. However this movie do have some problems.

Problem A, the acting. I have never seen such horrible acting in any movie I have ever seen. Half the actors sound like they are reading things off a script, and the other half overdo it so it becomes completely ridiculous. Talisa Soto do an ok job as Vampirella but most of the acting is abysmal.

Problem B, Vampirella's costume. You know in modern comic book movies they do not just copy a character's outfit from the comic but rather designs something which fit on a 3D real human body, well they did not do this here. And while Vampirella's red bathing suit might look ok in the comic, it looks just horrible on a real woman on film. The costume look so cheap it is hard to take any part of the movie where it is shown seriously at all. It is not sexy, it looks stupid, like a 5 dollar Halloween costume. And to be honest the other costumes in the movie is not so good either.

Problem C, the characters seam to have read the script, not the actors, the characters. The movie beings with Ella and her father discussing Vlad and Ella expressing disgust at the notion he might receive the death penalty. Later when the older vampire is murdered his last words to his daughter is that she must not let revenge consume her. How do he know she will seek out revenge. Later when Ella have come to Earth she meets a geek, first of all the man do not blink when she tells him she is a vampire, he just takes it in one stride as if she had just told him she was from Texas, like ok, nothing strange here. Laster after Ella has left the geek stand smiling over the kiss she gave him and he is the one who names her Vampirella, something he whispers to himself. Later Ella begins to use that name, but where did she come by it, she was not around when the geek said it. I could go on and on with this, there is countless instances where the characters react to or seam to have information they could not possible have unless they had read the script.

All in all Vampirella is a cheesy film which do not do the comic book justice but which possesses it's own kind of charm. If you like me like B horror and science fiction movies then you might like this one. In a way it is so bad that it is good. I know I enjoyed watching it despite all the flaws it has.

Now just a reply to those who have given the movie a negative score because of the price. This movie have become collectible. It is not the movie's fault that few copies of it was printed so it fetches a high price. You have to decide for yourself if the movie is worth it. But why give the movie a lower review score because it is collectible. That is just as stupid as those I sometimes see who give a book or a movie for example two or three stars and then explain, the product was wonderful but it took a long time shipping. This is meant to be reviews of the actual items, not comments on shipping or collectors value.",1276992000,3,3629,4.223342939481268

893370,1,6304510772,"Back in the 1970's, I was obsessed with Vampirella magazine.  Many of the stories were well scripted with stunning visuals.  A Vampi movie was promised, but never came.  So imagine my excitement when I found out in the 1990's that a Vampi film had finally been made.  Then imagine my horror, disgust, and mild amusement once I saw this load of guano.  The most horrifying thing about the flic was the acting.  Oh, and the script...and the not-so-special effects.  The bat transformation is one step above a novelty rubber bat on a string.  Sample scene:  Vampi is prepared to reveal her true self to her would be suitor.  ""There's something you don't know about me,"" she says and turns away from the camera.  There's a sudden jerk (when they stopped the film so she could slip in her cheap red contacts and retail plastic fangs), then she turns around and HISSSS!!!  Suitor:  ""Oh, really?  What don't I know about you?  That you stopped at H*t T*pic on your way here?""  Okay, he doesn't say that, but he should have.  That scene has become a long-running joke between me and a friend who had the misfortune of watching this poop pile with me.  If you're looking for a movie that's so bad it's funny--no, even then I can't recommend it.  If you're a person who gets a canker sore and then has to keep touching it with your tongue to make sure it still hurts, then this IS the film for you.  Ouch!  Yup, it still hurts.  NOTE:  I didn't want to give this ANY stars, but the format required me to give it at least one.  That one's for cheese/camp value only.",1251244800,4,1555,4.432624113475177

893372,2,6304510772,"This movie is terrible.  I'll tell it like it is.  I never read the original 1970's comic magazine, but I have the comics that come after 1992, so I don't know how well this follows the original story line.  From reading other reviews, it apparently doesn't.

Some people may remember in the 80's when they started trying to get comic books into the movies.  This is probably the worst attempt during the first stint at trying to transfer comics to movies (though this came out in like '96).  Even ""The Punisher"" with Dolf Lundgren is ten times better than this film.  Granted I'm pretty sure ""Vampirella"" had a much lower budget... which is kind of shocking, I know.  The basics in the Vampirella story are that vampires are really from another planet, Drakulon, that flows with blood for rivers and they feed off of this regularly.  Vampirella's arch nemesis is Vlad and he was a criminal on her planet.  He gets away and comes to Earth, only after killing her father.  Naturally Vampirella wants vengeance, so she follows Vlad and his cronies.

As you can see the movie starts off pretty cheesy on some ""futuristic"" world that looks like any other 1970's sci-fi set.  After she gets off planet it goes from stupid to dumber, because all of a sudden she has this vinyl costume, but in Drakulon she had nothing of the kind.  Apparently she left the planet with this though?  At least that's what the movie implies.  I don't know, in the beginning she was relatively modestly dressed, so maybe after her father died she felt less inhibitive and decided to go with something sexier?  Sure, that works for me.  The only problem I had with this was that it wasn't her costume from the comic... it was some amalgamation of it.  I know her costume was supposed to be satin in the comics, not vinyl though.  I guess they were trying to play up some sort of dominatrix type of look.  Either way, the costume change wasn't all that great, and yes they are big deals in comics for those who don't know.

Anyway, so her first appearance on Earth is probably one of the more absurd scenarios.  There's this ridiculously nerdy kid walking in a back alley with a computer system (old computer... like the size of a microwave, yes this is filmed in 1996, unless this is some lost film) and he's being mugged.  For some reason Vampirella appears out of nowhere and rescues him by beating up the thugs.  Of course computer nerd kid thinks she's really hot.  So they go back to his place, no idea why, and he tells her some answers to these totally random questions she has, because of course he knows the answer and can look them up on the internet.  The internet is a veritable smorgasbord of information, because you can clearly look up the names of ultra hidden vampires because they are using their original names from Drakulon... makes sense to me.  Then he gives her a coat because she can't go out wearing a vinyl bikini, and then she kisses him?  The highlight of this scene was the poster for ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" in the background, which is hilarious.

So she seeks vengeance then proceeds to hunt down Vlad's friends and kill them so she can finally find Vlad.  All the while there is this top secret government organization searching for vampires too and their lead agent is Adam Van Helsing... of course.  Anyway, they cross paths, Vampirella has to convince Adam they're on the same side, and then a whole bunch of other clich and predictable things happen.  They capture one of Vlad's henchmen and they find out that Vlad has turned into a rock star... played by some musician named Daltry.  Of course this gives them the excuse to actually perform some sort of rock song?  It's about being a vampire... who could've guessed.

Just to finish this up, Adam and Vampirella work together to bring Vlad and team down in a very random and silly way that was predictable from the beginning.  Trust me; the comic books are far better than this.  If you're a fan of the comic book you may want to go ahead and NOT see this.  Otherwise, if you want to sit around with your friends and make sarcastic comments about a movie, this is definitely what you're after.  At least the girl in the movie is actually pretty good looking, so it's not like it hurts your eyes to watch... though Vlad's monster make-up was pretty goofy looking and that did kind of hurt to look at.  So I guess it ends up netting to zero for viewability since it doesn't technically have a positive constant, mathematically speaking.",1203897600,2,4500,4.568039950062422
893373,1,6304510772,"Hey, I'm a big fan of bad movies, but this one was too bad to enjoy at all. The story was dull, the casting was misguided, and the ""special"" effects were dismal (although the spacecraft models actually looked ok, other aspects such as ""morphing into a bat"" were anything but special). This movie is listed at an unbelievably low 1 million dollar budget, and I suspect that 99% of this budget went to buy the 80 minutes worth of film stock and pay Roger Daltrey's retainer fees (by the way, Mr. Daltrey seems to be quite fond of singing about being ""freed"" in many of his movies...maybe this is directed at his agent!)

 At first I thought this film would make great fodder for Mystery Science Theater 3000, but as the movie progressed, I realized that it probably would have led to mass suicide on the ol' Satellite of Love.

 I can't guess who would actually enjoy this movie. Fans of the Vampirella comic series are sure to be disappointed by the changes (the costume alteration is the tip of the iceberg here). There's not much to appease fans of cheap horror flicks either. I'm dunno if even the hardcore collectors of all things vampire-related would be too pleased with this mess, except to fill a bit of space on their shelves.

 Oh, I did like the fact that it has a very short running time.",1150329600,4,1299,4.483050847457627

The picture quality of the double feature version is excellent for DVD, so I can't imagine why this single feature version would be preferable.

Vamp camp doesn't get any better than this. Roger Daltrey (yes, that Roger Daltrey) plays the worst vampire ever; he was clearly out to have some fun and maybe score with actresses during filming. Talisa Soto as Vampirella is of course the real reason to watch the film (unless you're a diehard Daltrey fan). She wears an uncomfortable looking getup that is, essentially, a major reason to bother watching Vampirella at all.

The film was made for $1M, which adjusted for inflation is still only about $1.6M today. Jim Wynorski knows how to stretch a dollar (e.g., using the ""legal advisor"" for the film as a vampire extra), and the director's commentary track goes into detail about how he was able to pull off a Vampirella with Roger Daltrey and Talisa Soto (and what he wasn't able to do that he had wanted to) for only $1M. Despite being notorious for exploitation films, Wynorski comes across as humble (for a director), someone who continually praises others involved in all aspects of getting Vampirella to the screen.

I found Vampirella more entertaining with Wynorski's commentary track turned on. Fun facts from it:
 In a fight scene, Talisa Soto (Vampirella) was supposed to swing and miss but instead connected, breaking the nose of Tom Deters, who was at the time recovering from a nose injury.
 Wynorski claims this is the first screen presentation of a government vampire eradication agency (here Operation Purge), an idea that was later used in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer/dp/B0046XG48O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>&nbsp;(The Initiative in season 4).
 Vampirella fans cried bloody murder when this film was released because Vampirella's costume was not true to its source. In fact, Wynorski had wanted to use a more authentic costume, but Soto declined to wear it because it surely would have led to numerous wardrobe malfunctions.
 Roger Daltrey took pride in bringing his vampire character to life, which included the idea of wearing lipstick (it was not a good look for him).",1443052800,2,2602,5.673521850899743

With her powers amplified, Ella aims to put an end to Vlad before he can complete his sinister plan. Forrest J Ackerman's sexy heroine comes to life in the Roger Corman production of VAMPIRELLA, but a cheesy, low-budget one, at that. Years before the major studios were tossing millions of dollars at most comic book franchises, the independents managed to squeeze out a few schlocky entries of their own, including Full Moon's DOCTOR MORDRID (taken from a screen adaptation of the Doctor Strange comics), the shelved version of Corman's own FANTASTIC FOUR, and VAMPIRELLA. It is tough to say which is worse in this case, between the poorly choreographed action sequences, the ridiculous overacting, or the narrow-minded plot. If director Jim Wynorski's resume speaks towards anything, it is his tendency to gravitate towards cheap, hastily-made exploitation films, and this is certainly no exception. When she isn't speaking, fashion model Talisa Soto looks fine enough in costume, although the design is far less flattering than one might hope. A discussion into the differences between the comics and the film would be fruitless given the liberal use of the character, so suffice it to say that VAMPIRELLA is nothing more than B-movie fodder that can easily be avoided.
