2300378,3,B0009MDPTC,"This is an interesting and informative film about the history of the Louvre;  but it's much more an ode to the building itself than to the treasures contained within.

This award-winning film was made by American Lucy Jarvis and represents the first time anyone was ever allowed to film inside the Louvre. Charles Boyer narrates in English, and tells an engaging story of the Louvre's journey from Fortress to Palace to Museum--and its unique place in the history and heart of Paris.  The building changed physically at the hand of each of its regal denizens, and the art collection was purchased, gifted, stolen and scavenged throughout the course of centuries.  The narration is illustrated with portraits of key historical figures, as well as drawings, paintings and prints of historical events surrounding the Louvre through the ages.  Some of the nicest film footage is of the deserted galleries at night, captured when the crew got locked in the Museum one evening.

Because this DVD was released in August 2005, I assumed it was a brand new program.  In fact, THE LOUVRE was filmed in 1977, and, unfortunately, shows its age.  I've been spoiled by the sharp, clean, bright, digital quality which makes fine art DVDs such a pleasure to view.  Even older titles seem to have been ""cleaned up"" for their digital debuts in order to take full advantage of the new medium.  Sadly, no such restoration appears to have taken place with this title (at least to my untrained eye).  The interior scenes have a yellowish cast to them that distorts the colors of the paintings, and infuses THE LOUVRE with a fuzzy, dated feel.  In addition, much of the footage is slightly ""jumpy,"" which I found very distracting.  One good thing about the film's age is that we get to see some works by Manet, Degas, Cezanne, Van Gogh and others which were moved from the Louvre long ago and are now housed in the Musee d'Orsay.

The DVD ""extras"" aren't even worth mentioning.

I don't want to come across as too terribly negative.  This is still a ""must have"" for serious art geeks like myself--I just want people to understand what this DVD is, and what it is not.  It IS a lovingly-made account of the fascinating history of one of Paris' oldest and most famous buildings; it is NOT a retrospective of the vast art collection housed within its walls.  Yes, many paintings and sculptures do appear throughout the film, but they do not often appear to their best advantage.  I was pleasantly surprised by how much I learned about the Louvre's rich history, but disappointed by the secondary role assigned to art history and appreciation.",1125532800,88,2616,4.78619153674833

The narrator, Charles Boyer, spoke very clearly and had a well written, but not too cutesy, script.  I have seen this film maybe a dozen times (showed it to my HS French classes years and years ago), and I still love it. It's helpful to know a little about art and history before watching, but it can also be a good introduction for those who realize they need to learn more.",1473638400,,489,4.545454545454546

2300394,5,B0009MDPTC,"I quite enjoyed watching ""The Louvre"" with Charles Boyer as narrator. This is a vintage film but very informative as to the beginnings of the Louvre and who actually started it and when and the reasons for. It is a fascinating step back in time, both the filming in 1966 I believe and also stepping back in time to the Louvre itself. You will see many works of art and learn a lot about this museum. I recommend it to anyone who takes art seriously.",1470873600,,449,4.294117647058823

2300408,2,B0009MDPTC,The film was not clear and hard to watch. I think the information would have been fine if I had not been so distracted by the poor picture quality. I stopped watching because of this. You had to strain to see the art.,1461801600,,217,4.069767441860465

2300414,5,B0009MDPTC,"Fascinating history of what is probably the world's greatest art museum.  I was unaware of the history of the building itself.  It is , without the art work that it holds, a work of art itself.  First rate.",1456531200,,206,4.368421052631579

2300418,3,B0009MDPTC,"I enjoyed seeing the historical progress of what we now know as the Louvre, but the makers of this film did not do their homework on some issues and got them wrong.  Charles Boyer is a great narrator, but how could he tell us that ""No one knows where the word 'Louvre' comes from,"" and then proceed to tell us it might be a medieval French word for ""lepers?""  Granted, prisoners and lepers were once kept in the edifice, and that is a fascinating fact, but come on:  the name ""Louvre"" comes from the French word for ""the opening,"" the same way the phrase ""louvered blinds"" does.  The documentary is still worth watching, just to see the steps it went through at different stages of history, as it grew in size.  And it was interesting to learn that the French managed to get every last piece of art removed in time to save them from the invading Nazis in WWII.  The film does not show you much of the art inside -- this is largely a step-by-step show about how the architecture was put together and used at different times in history, and occasionally nearly destroyed.  The film was clearly made before the current entryway was created, so there is nothing on that.  I love history, so I was glad I watched, but don't use Charles Boyer as your guru when it comes to etymology!",1454544000,,1277,4.404255319148936

2300420,5,B0009MDPTC,"Really Great documentary about the history of the Louvre itself and how it was built and by which Kings.  There is a lot of information I did not know about the Louvre that is in this documentary. If you love art as I do, this is a fascinating overview of the Louvre, even though it was produced sometime ago. Forget about the picture quality, you will learn a lot. If you are traveling to Paris, this will be very helpful to view in terms of how the Louvre is laid out and for some interesting back ground for your trip.  I would also follow this up with the movie The Monuments Men and another really great film about museums is the Russian Ark, which is about the Hermitage in Russia.",1452816000,,687,4.276923076923077
2300421,5,B0009MDPTC,"This Lavish Classic, itself a work of art, by famous Producer Lucy Jarvis (herself a grand cinematic  creative treasure) leaves one speechless: narrated by celebrated actor Charles Boyer, music and scoring by the the awarded and decorated American composer Norman Dello Joio, this awarded Documentary  takes one's breath away! How could it not? It documents the penultimate sweep of 800 years of history in Art, Society, Culture, and World Events. 50 Kings and Queens, and Presidents, Dignitaries, children, animals, trees, prisoners, dogs, and even Popes have visited, or called her home! She houses nearly every Master and important artist of Sculpture, Painting, more. She herself has a jaw-dropping History alone and part to Herself. Only NBC News in  it's heyday could afford to make this lavish film production.... Millions visit her, Le Louvre, each year, for dozens and dozens of decades, and hundreds of years publicly and privately before that.
These words all fail. See and listen for yourself, undisturbed and awestruck, for a brief hour!",1450051200,2,1050,5.313253012048193

2300424,5,B0009MDPTC,"I never understood the fascination with The Louvre itself until I visited it last summer.  Now, there is so much more I want to see and learn about it and the priceless items it houses.  I was so happy to find this video.  It is very well produced, nice to look at, and very pleasant to listen to with Charles Boyer as narrator.  Since I can't just live in the Louvre, this video is a lovely alternative, with fascinating history stories that captured my imagination, as well as leaving me wanting even more...",1446854400,,510,4.451612903225806
2300425,5,B0009MDPTC,"An all-time favorite.  My original copies wore out from re-run use.  A great look at the history of a great building that never gets bogged down in an academic discussion of the art or architecture.  One personal delight is Mr. Boyer showing a series of maps of Paris with the Louvre in the center, and going back and back before the building existed.  I like to run that sequence back and forth just for the amusement of watching the changes to the city.  The photography and sound are both excellent, the script is wonderful, and Mr. Boyer is at his best as a voice actor.  The edited final product is a masterwork of the documentary form. Six stars.",1446681600,,652,4.483050847457627
2300426,5,B0009MDPTC,"The Louvre and the legendary Charles Boyer, who agreed to do the narration if he could do it his own way. I won't spoil it by saying what that is... This is an old documentary, obviously, and starts with an interview with the producer, and then goes on to a wonderful panorama of all the different types of art in the Louvre, along with this famous landmark's own story.",1444953600,,370,4.3768115942028984
2300427,3,B0009MDPTC,"Filmed decades ago, this film truly shows its age. Not only can one tell that it is dated due to the low resolution of the images, and the clothing of the visitors, but one could also perhaps argue in its attitude to the subject.

Certainly it has its interesting moments, and some of the information is rather intriguing to know, but it also comes across as pompous and annoying at times. For example, the producers spend too much time focusing on paintings that were created to ""toot the horn"" so to speak of the nobility, or at least the very rich. Many of these paintings are from the era of crazy wigs and out-of-control ribbons...which is fine, but tiresome to dwell on at length. I just found myself wanting a break from the more conceited side of art.

The narrator also makes absurd comments about how the Louvre is ""immortal"" and ""indestructible,"" as well as making the rather pompous assertion that the greatest work of art there is the actual Louvre itself. (I doubt that the Louvre would be so famous today if it had been ransacked of all its art in the past.)

It was a relief to see some of the art from other eras that did not involve over-the-top men in high heels and grey wigs, but overall this film seemed to have a certain era that it preferred, as well as a certain style, and it tended to stick with it. If overt pictorial bragging of the rich in regards to themselves and their country is your style, then you might like this a lot more than me.",1444953600,,1469,4.393382352941177

2300432,5,B0009MDPTC,"It's a bit dated, but the film is informative and enjoyable.  The history of the Louvre is the context within which the other information about the museum is couched.  So, if you are looking for lots of close ups of the art and explication of individual pieces of work, this is not the film for you.  But if you are interested in the history of the building itself, and the way in which it related to the history of France, then I would say that you would like the film very much.",1440374400,,480,4.195652173913044

The introduction that explains how the French feel about the Louvre goes a long way towards keeping my eyes from rolling during some of the sensual description of art and architecture.

I would love to see this remastered (and the lighting improved) with the addition of another hour of what has happened since 1977.

It is narrated by a true Frenchman and lover of the Louvre, Charles Boyer. The major problem is that the DVD is made from a film shot several years ago. Unless this topic really fascinates you, you will find many parts of it boring. I prefer the Rick Steves discussion of the Louvre over this one.

The museum turns out to have just as wonderful and amazing a history as any of the great works of art it houses.  I first saw this way back in high school and it left such an impression on me that more than 30 years later I still remember many parts of it.  One of the most interesting story telling devices are the models used to show how the Louvre grew, expanded, and changed over the course of time.  All the major historic figures of France seem to have been involved with this great monument over its life and their lives are inevitably intertwined in a great historic narrative.  The Louvre has such a fantastic story of its own that you could not have made up anything more exciting and unbelievable if you tried.  Watch this and you will spend more time marveling at the structure than the Mona Lisa.

Follow this up by watching The Monuments Men.  In The Louvre you find out what the French did to preserve all the great works in the museum.  The Monuments Men is another great story about other great art works protected from the Nazi.",1403308800,8,1152,4.421800947867299

But it is mostly a history of the building. I did find the history very interesting, so I did enjoy it. But I wish it had focused more on the art. The few paintings it showed were only on screen for a brief moment (of course you can pause to view longer) and very little information was provided about the paintings. If you are interested in the history of the Louvre as a building and France's history you will enjoy it. If you want to see quality images of the art of the Louvre you may be disappointed. Also, this was originally filmed in 1978 so the quality is reflective of that time.",1342915200,,753,4.2
2300455,4,B0009MDPTC,"3.5 stars, actually. kinda yellowed and dingy, but the narration is good.  if you don't know the history of the building, here's your chance.",1340928000,,141,4.875

2300457,5,B0009MDPTC,"I used the video of this during the 20 years that I taught French -- it is FABULOUS!  It is not just a dry litany of the art but a living story of the history of Paris with her Louvre.  It ranks as one of my favorite movies, one that I never tire of seeing again.  Very few students would zone out or fall asleep.  I can't say enough about this film.",1303257600,8,350,3.8194444444444446
2300458,5,B0009MDPTC,"I was a video tape editor for Wmaq-TV NBC Chicago for 33 years.
a copy of this program was added in the video library many years ago.
Being fimilar with the item I wanted one for home. As I'am  a frankophile and having read several books on the Louver in
Frenceh and English the program was found to beis very informative of the history
of the Louvre. Thank You Dana James Young",1298332800,,378,4.25
2300459,5,B0009MDPTC,"I've always believed history is taught best when we study a civilization's art rather than making our students study timelines.

This video accomplishes that beautifully, showing major events in French history and tying it to the Louvre and its treasures.

The Louvre has, of course, undergone changes since this video was produced in the late 1970's, so I have a more modern DVD I show my classes as well, but for hitting the highlights of the last 1,000 years of French history, this video is marvelous.",1239494400,6,505,4.8604651162790695
2300460,4,B0009MDPTC,"I originally ordered this DVD because I wanted to see art.  The ONLY reason that there aren't 5 stars is for this reason.  There is quite a bit of art, but not just what I was looking for.  However, it is a wonderful history of the Louvre itself.  The building, the kings & queens and the history was a splendid eye opener.  Loved it!",1234137600,,334,4.15625
2300461,4,B0009MDPTC,"Let's just say this upfront, it has nothing to do with the Da Vinci Code so forget about that.  It's an NBC News documentary from the '70s, shot on film with professional lighting and voicever by Charles Boyer, mainly about the long and complicated history of the building.  It's very, very well done, with high production values - not like a Rick Steves or Samantha Brown traveldoc (not that there's anything wrong with those).

As others have noted, the film stock has not aged as well as one might like, and while the audio is very good, the visual is perhaps a 3.5-4 out of 5.  Also, there's a little bit of staging every so often with spectators.  The most effective bit is a running feature where a costumed arm adds to and rearranges the wings and corridors of the Louvre to show how it changed over time (and it changed a lot).  Boyer has a good script to work with and does a professional job of narration.

It's only an hour long so it catches your attention, gives you useful info, and then you're done.  It deals with the Mona Lisa only as one of thousands of works of art, so don't buy this hoping for a documentary on that subject.  What it is, is a very professional overview of the joint.  Good for people who are planning to go and want to take a peek, and those who have been and want to remember.  This is a good gift for an older Francophile.",1168387200,33,1362,4.301960784313725
8063171,5,B0009MDPTC,"I have watched this many, many times.  It is a truly brilliant piece.  Having visited the Louvre, probably 25 times, I always watch this first.  Charles Boyer, the ultimate Frenchman, narrates the tour beautifully.  I saw comments that this is old and dated...Wow, their loss.  More than showing the art, it acquaints the viewer with the convoluted history of France.  When I first went to the Louvre, I entered through the doors shown.  Today,it is much busier and you enter through the glass pyramid. Don't let this distract you from the outside of the Louvre...take time to just sit and gaze at the building itself.  It is spectacular.  Walk into the Louvre as a French person after watching.",1519344000,,695,4.822033898305085

8063179,5,B0009MDPTC,"It was wise to choose a Frenchman, Charles Boyer, to acquaint Americans with the Louvre. After all, the Louvre is not simply a building that showcases some of the most important art in the world; and it is more than an object of art itself. It is also a central symbol of French civilization. Cleverly, Boyer was fairly exhaustive in portraying the changes that occurred to the Louvre during its 800+ years of history. Correctly, showing individual works of art seemed like a secondary matter. After all, the Louvre is much, much more than the sum of its parts. It incorporates the very soul of the French nation.",1482624000,,613,4.685185185185185
