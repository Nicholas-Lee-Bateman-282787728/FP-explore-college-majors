8244793,2,B001296XTA,"I couldn't even watch this entire video. She may have been considered a professional, but she is not an instructor. I expected to get more training tips instead of her sitting in a lawn chair talking. I would not recommend this to my other mini-loving friends.",1363737600,,260,4.673913043478261
8244794,3,B001296XTA,"I learned a couple things from the video, but it didn't show everything that was claimed it shows.  The title says training miniature horses for halter and it barely mentions it.  It goes more into halter obstacle.  The video is poor quality and not worth the money.",1356393600,,266,4.617021276595745
8244795,5,B001296XTA,Exactly what I needed for a quick guide on the application.  No looking through books if you forget one step.,1241222400,3,109,4.45
