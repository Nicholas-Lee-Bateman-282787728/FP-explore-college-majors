8295233,3,B001DWNUAQ,"In the near future, a manned mission explores Mars to discovery a new energy source for Earth's dwindling resources. Instead they discover a brutal civil war erupting within a previously undiscovered Martian civilization, and soon the fate of both planets hangs in the balance. C. Thomas Howell (The Hitcher), David Chokachi (Baywatch) and Jeff Fahey (Grindhouse) star in this combat-packed adventure with a whole new vision of the angry red planet!",1391644800,,449,5.338028169014085
8295234,4,B001DWNUAQ,"I bought this movie after having saw it years ago on the Sci-Fi channel.  I liked how they worked in bits of the Annunkai story into it.  There's parts of it that are a bit ""cheesy"".  It's a better movie to re-watch than some Sci-Fi movies.  I'll watch it again.",1300752000,3,262,4.18
8295235,1,B001DWNUAQ,"The special effects were pretty good. The acting was over the top and the characters were unappealing.  Listening to the silly dialogue was difficult.

The first astronauts reach Mars and find it inhabited by arrogant and superstitious goths who look like us and speak English.  It would have played better as a parody of the old space operas.  Several die in quite gross ways, like eyes popping out and heads exploding!  A Mars vamp wants a murderous earthman to take her husband out of the picture.  The commander is a bit of a psycho! She does the customary dance and strip-tease seduction.  He wants the secret of their energy source to take back to the corporation for which he works on earth. (Yes, it is another one of those movies which stresses how bad corporations are, especially those wanting to make a profit.)

One of the actors and some of the sets and props look like leftovers from a television Stargate episode.  There is a further similarity in the presence of highly advanced technology while the people themselves seem primative, like something out of an old gladiator film.  They discover that the warrior class are proposing an invasion of earth. Their priests suggest cooperation instead.  Not wanting to spoil things further, you would have to watch the rest for yourself... if you really have to do so.",1272758400,,1328,4.8061674008810575

8295237,4,B001DWNUAQ,"Crimson Force is based on the conspiracy and UFO-alien theories you'll find all over the Web about Mars. You know...  The purported Pyramid and ""Face"" that NASA photographed on Mars and then later explained as a play of light and shadows.  Cruise the Web and look at the photos -- interesting stuff.  Anyway, whether there was ever life on Mars or not is irrelevant.  The movie takes this premise, supposes that there was indeed intelligent life, and that it's still there.  In fact, the life that's there might hold the key to the betterment of life on Earth.

The movie plays with this premise by creating an overall conflict between human astronauts and martian inhabitants, as well as conflicts within each group.  Changing alliances, parallel running themes, twists, turns and double crosses accent a movie that's part action-adventure, part alien/government conspiracy, and part ""popcorn"" fun.  The ""science"" is very sci-fi, but works within the explanations given.  Thematically, the movie actually has something to say beneath its sci-fi veneer.  The cast is a who's who of genre stars.  Overall, Crimson Force is a fun ride!",1229904000,14,1133,5.103260869565218
