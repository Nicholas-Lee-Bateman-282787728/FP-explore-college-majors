3441684,5,B0019N5AA2,"I was surprised to find out this was an American made-for-tv documentary. Primarily, cuz the narrator was British (Carlo Rota). And it was about a WWII British project to fly American-built war planes from Canada's coast to the UK -- rather than by ships which were vulnerable to German U-boats.

It turns out the the maker of this documentary is the son of one of the American volunteers. And he did his father proud. I found the documentary interesting and informative. The kind of documentary I like -- it tells about a hitherto unknown niche in history. And if it contains planes -- well then, so much the better.",1299542400,2,617,4.660550458715596

3441686,5,B0019N5AA2,An extremely interesting and informative DVD.  A must for WWII aircraft history buffs.  Beautiful footage of vintage WWII aircraft and stories of little known special air operations during the war.,1270252800,,197,5.533333333333333
3441687,5,B0019N5AA2,"Having now watched this DVD twice it is the first time I have properly understood the role of Ferry Command and Return Ferry Command as my Dad would never talk much about it, despite spending from 1940 to 1949 in Montreal with BOAC as a Flight engineer, intially with Return Ferry Command.  The introduction places the activities of Ferry Command in the context of the war and the development of aviation.  It has left me with a much better appreciation of what risks all the aircrew took in playing their roles and I would thouroughly recommend it to anyone with an interest in this operation.",1260662400,3,594,4.647619047619048
3441688,5,B0019N5AA2,"The lonely, frigid, dangerous work these ferry pilots did was not reported or even acknowledged for too long, since the pretence of American neutrality would have been torn away and since exposing their routes to German air patrols would have meant disaster.  In their case, secrecy meant forgetfulness, and the immense contribution they made to Britain's ability to hold off Nazi invasion was overlooked in nearly all histories of the conflict.  This film brings them back to life, explains their mission and recognizes their bravery.  A wonderful film on a very worth subject, with the director's personal crusade adding depth to the presentation.",1260403200,3,649,5.281553398058253
3441689,5,B0019N5AA2,"I'm a little bit biased since my dad is the DVD, but still and all It was well written and very exciting to watch all the Lancs. flying around. I learned stuff maybe my dad didn't even know.
Watching this movie brought back all the stories my dad used to tell me as we'd have a few cocktails on Saturday nights.",1234051200,4,311,4.114754098360656
3441690,5,B0019N5AA2,"my father served in the RCAF during WW2. He flew planes from North Carolina to Gander Newfoundland which were picked up by the RAF Ferry Command for delivery to Europe.
we are also from Montreal (now living in Atlanta GA.) and the combination of the RAF FC and the scenes of Montreal created a memorable viewing.

A very informative and exciting story of a little known era of WW2
Thanks!",1229904000,,197,3.9
3441692,5,B0019N5AA2,"I saw this film at a preview screening at the High Museum in Atlanta. Although I am not a WWII history buff, and often find war documentaries to be boring, this was certainly not the case with this film! I found the story very compelling and in fact, was moved to tears by the end of it. Not only did it achieve high artistic standards, but the story was told with humor and compassion. The wealth of archival footage, including home movies, was very impressive and it gave the film a more personal feeling than your average war documentary. The fact that the filmmaker's father was one of the main pilots also gave it extra emotional resonance. I highly recommend this film; even an anti-war person like myself came away with a feeling of pride for what these people accomplished, and an even deeper respect for those who sacrificed for our country.",1217116800,13,850,4.598684210526316

8274745,4,B0019N5AA2,"Received ""Flying The Secret Sky"" promptly in excellent condition.  I have enjoyed reading about the life of Winston Churchill's pilot, an d his many wartime flights.  After the war, he was the chief pilot for Johns Manville, and flew a fellow croquet player around the country when she was 10 years old, letting her sit in  the copilots seat.

8274748,5,B0019N5AA2,"Excellent storytelling of a little known effort, early in World War Two, to get airplanes from North American factories to Great Britain in those desperate days when she stood alone against Nazi Germany after all the other western European nations were under Hitler's regime.  What may surprise viewers is the extent of American involvement in what was labeled a Royal Air Force program. This documentary was made be the son of one of the program's most influential and respected participants. Highly factual and entertaining.",1343520000,,526,5.261904761904762
8274749,5,B0019N5AA2,"I believe this will be my 6th order of this DVD. My son was 9 when he first watched this documentary, and  he did not move throughout the whole film because it was so well written and produced.  Years later, I still hear my son tell his friends about The ""Secret Ferry Command.""  It was not known to me before seeing the film, that Director Bill VanDerKloot's father was one of the  pilots, and I have to agree with some of the other reviewers, ""He did his father proud.""  This is a wonderful gift for all ages that are interested in World War II history.",1322611200,2,555,4.247619047619048
