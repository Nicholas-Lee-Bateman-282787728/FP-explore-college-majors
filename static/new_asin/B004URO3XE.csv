4470407,4,B004URO3XE,"Wow. I'm into episode 2 and this is a really great series. Great acting and a twisty plot that grabs hold of you. Really, really great cast and production.",1415750400,2,155,4.379310344827586
4470408,4,B004URO3XE,I'm in agreement with those that thought this series was slow but stylized; very much worth the purchase and watch.,1385596800,,115,4.8
4470409,5,B004URO3XE,"I was surfing the Web, for GOOD- dark British crime shows.and i came across this one{.The Shadow Line} with Christopher Eccleston from Docter Who and Stephen Rea from the crying game and i love both of them. Chiwetel Ejiofor, I've heard of him before!.Well anyway i wanted to this D.V.D it sound like something i would like? But there is a problem. This dvd is on a PAL-form mat,you can not watch it on American D.V.D players. You must have a desk top or a Lap top computer. Ooh! and for the visual,Please! your screen- must be a 17'' - 21 in, too enjoy this sharp and compose cinemagraphy. If you can get a larger form-mat. My Hats off  too U. Their is a few more on my must-have list that is on the PAL only form-mat. From B.B.C.ONE.",1364860800,,735,4.287769784172662
4470410,2,B004URO3XE,"Shadow Line is a disappointment worth watching. The best thing about it is that it's visually stunning. This alone makes it worth a viewing. However, unfortunately, the plot is painfully implausable, becoming annoyingly stupid by the final episode. There's some excellent dialogue and quite a few nice moments. Some wonderful acting and some awful acting. There are odd themes throughout the show including pregnancy and pussycats, which I'm sure hold some symbolic and/or psychological import to the series creator, but their significance lost in the shadows. Much like the series. Oh well, give it a shot if you can buy it cheap and don't expect much.",1361232000,4,653,5.169811320754717
4470411,5,B004URO3XE,"All of the adjectives to describe a very well produced, written, directed, and acted drama from the BBC should go here.",1356566400,,119,4.714285714285714
4470412,5,B004URO3XE,"Really good, fine acting, great detective, I need to see if there is a second series, you won't be sorry buying this one",1349827200,,120,4.260869565217392
4470413,5,B004URO3XE,"The 5 star review is only for ""The Shadow Line"" entertainment value.  Not for the product.  I bought this DVD to share with friends.  The friends were all disappointed when they were unable to watch the DVD.  It's not that it was a BluRay because I checked that out.  None of us have a BluRay player.  It was that the DVD was sent from England and over seas they have a different type of DVD, whereas it was NOT usable in the American, or North American DVD player.  The problem with this item is that it did NOT note that the DVD would NOT play in an American DVD player.  I had read the advertisement.  Be careful with overseas DVD's!",1340755200,15,636,4.233333333333333
4470414,2,B004URO3XE,"I sometimes wonder if the ""creatives"" in TV can actually read. So often they pour millions into series whose plots just don't make sense. If they had sat down and read the treatment somebody would have said "" this plot is ridiculous"". Shadow Line was brilliantly cast and filmed and built up tension episode by episode. However (SPOILER ALERT) the last episode revealed that the whole conspiracy had been designed to top up the policemens' retirement fund. Yes that is right, a $100 million per year drug smuggling plot and multiple murders had been necessary because top policemen were worried that their retirement fund would run out of money! Just one problem with this, apparently none of the ""creatives"" understood double entry book keeping and what accountants do. ""Here is an additional $100 million to add to the retirement fund"". ""Oh thank you, I will just pop it in the safe and add it to the total"". Suspension of belief is fine in some circumstances but not in a police procedural.",1333065600,6,993,4.812865497076023
4470415,5,B004URO3XE,"This intricate drama draws you in to a frighteningly compelling world of shadows, suspense and intrigue. A mesmerizing sequence of revelations embedded in a twisted plot-line will keep you addicted until the final episode. Absolutely brilliant.",1330300800,2,244,5.805555555555555
4470416,5,B004URO3XE,"If anyone should claim that there are no decent dramas on British TV these days, you could do far worse than point them in the direction of this masterpiece of intrigue and conspiracy. With an outstanding script that will keep you guessing until the conclusion of the last episode, this has everything that a good TV drama should: believable characters, crisp dialogue and outstanding production values. The story starts with a simple enough premise: a crime is committed, and two parallel investigations are launched to identify the culprit, one run by the police and the other by a crime gang. Although the whole cast do a great job of presenting an intricate criminal underworld lingering just under the surface of respectable society, Stephen Rea gives a standout performance as the lethal Gatehouse... though to discuss exactly why the character is so effective would hint at spoilers in a miniseries that is packed to the brim with surprises and dark twists. Hugo Blick is to be commended for this tour-de-force of television; let's hope that a follow-up of sorts may one day materialise.",1321920000,14,1094,5.016483516483516

4470423,4,B004URO3XE,"One must hope that the London Police are not as corrupt as they appear in this series. It begins with the murder of a major crime figure who has been unaccountably freed from prison. It proceeds with psychopathic criminals fighting to take over his ""empire"" as senior police officers cheer them on. Interestingly, the criminals seem surprised that there fellow criminals are untrustworthy and dangerous. It all ends on a suitably depressing note.",1453939200,,446,5.123287671232877
4470424,5,B004URO3XE,"The BBC just knows how to do these thrillers, especially  stories about corrupt cops.  These episodes were often terrifying, always suspenseful.  If you can stop watching, you must have fallen asleep against your will.",1450224000,,218,5.352941176470588

4470428,5,B004URO3XE,Starts slow but give it time and it unravels like a striking snake. An explosive surprise ending coupled with great acting makes it well worth viewing.,1446249600,,151,4.846153846153846

4470430,4,B004URO3XE,"This one grows on you.....started out as a 2, ended up 4....really liked it. There are twists and turns in here that you don't see coming, but when you think back over the series, they add up. I wish there were more seasons, I'd watch them.",1440633600,,240,4.239130434782608
4470431,5,B004URO3XE,Amazing. Disturbing. Can't stop thinking about it.,1440374400,,50,6.285714285714286
4470432,2,B004URO3XE,"Giving it 2 stars for the mislabeling of the region encoding by Amazon.  They state under the region listing that this blu-ray is ""All Regions"" which is clearly not the case.  I ordered the blu-ray disc and was pleasantly surprised when it wouldn't play in my Sony PS3 blu-ray player.

As for the content, the Shadow Line series itself is very enjoyable.  I watched it years ago when BBC aired it and wanted to see it again so I ordered the disc.  The show itself I would give 4 stars, the fact that disc itself doesn't play in US players is the reason for the lower rating.

If you have a region-free player, you shouldn't have any problem viewing the contents of this disc.",1439942400,,675,4.403225806451613

4470435,5,B004URO3XE,"Surprisingly, I hadn't heard much about this 2011 series from the BBC but it's complex storyline kept me intrigued through all seven episodes; it's certainly not a run-of-the-mill murder mystery.  There are some truly chilling characters and the cast is superb.  The gory scenes often lasted a bit longer than necessary but what will haunt me is that this could be more fact than fiction.",1439078400,,388,4.953846153846154

 What a total disappointment.
 I love British movies and stories based on truth,...but this one was surely based on crap,..

 This one they can burn, it is already forgotten.",1433894400,,339,4.610169491525424
4470442,3,B004URO3XE,"""The Shadow Line"" has a strange plot  that keeps the viewer guessing about what is happening and continuing to watch the shows in order to find out. Lots of twists and turns and weird characters in this one. No redeeming characters with the typical motives of greed and guilt for their behavior. Makes for interesting viewing.",1433808000,,326,4.821428571428571

4470452,5,B004URO3XE,"Fantastic series...very dark but utterly compelling. Chiwetel Ejifor is always so excellent and powerful, and he really dominates this series. The entire cast is excellent and some very creepy characters. Miss Marple it definitely is not (thank heavens). In my opinion, nobody does this kind of thing better than the Brits...although the French series Spiral was also fascinating and multi-layered.

4470459,4,B004URO3XE,Good!,1421625600,,5,5.0
4470460,5,B004URO3XE,"This is an excellent 7 hour BBC mini-series about police corruption, drug trafficking and human frailty. Pitch dark, and no important character is without fault or sins.

The performances are terrific. Chiwetel Ejiofor does very solid work as a detective returning to the job after having a bullet lodged in his brain when his partner is killed in a shooting. His memory has been damaged, so he can't remember that night, or if he and his partner were doing cop work, or were playing ball with the other side. It's a complex character, a man tortured by literally not knowing himself, not knowing his own secrets. Christopher Eccleston also does great work with an unusual and complicated role. If Ejiofor is a good guy, who may have been a bad one, then Eccelston is a bad guy with the soul of a good one. He just wants to get out with one last big score to help his sick wife, without hurting anyone. Stephen Rea is a lot of fun, if a bit one note as an ice cold super-baddie, and Rafe Spall creates a terrific, very different kind of scary bad guy -- one who is so odd, almost goofy, and quirky that it's hard to know when he's kidding, or when he'll suddenly go off in a big way. All the smaller roles are filled with top notch actors, making this a thriller that relies far more on complex behavior than shoot-outs for narrative drive and tension.

There are a few frustrating plot cheats along the way, but less than most stories in this genre (the fact that it's generally so damn good, makes the few wonky moments stand out more.). Director-writer-producer Hugo Blick has a great eye for color and noirish framing, and a feel for messy morality that serves him very well here -- and even better in his more recent mini- series ""The Honorable Woman."" If you liked that, there's a good chance you'll like this, and vice-versa.",1421366400,4,1832,4.498498498498498

Sure, one of the characters was incredibly annoying, but nothing's perfect. Unfortunately, they either ran out of money or the writer decided to rest on his laurels or something because the writing plummets downhill after episode six or so. It's really too bad, because up until then it's very good.

The police investigation which follows digs up infuriating clues that make nothing clearer and point to the usual suspects....or are they? The acting is worthy of an ensemble BAFTA.  It's the BBC's version of the  ""The Departed"" with a sly English accent. Pay close attention, the plot demands nothing less. You'll be so glad you did.",1416009600,9,467,5.213333333333333

I followed it with interest thanks to the excellent cast performing an excellent story where sometimes you do not seem to understand it all, anyway I - an Italian loving to enjoy performances in the original languages - wonder if british people can catch EVERY word the players speak, or do they have to show subtitles to understand what is spoken. These productions are so careful to anything, but the sound of words is often too quick or grumbled or fading to nothing. It happens too many times. Oh, I have to say that such lack of, let me say: education, may also be found in our Italian tv series. Once I heard a famous French actress (I believe it was Edwige Feullire) who stated that farsi capire  il primo dovere di un artista (to speak clearly is the first duty of an artist).
