4311414,2,B004AUP3OY,"A real disappointment after watching Corner Gas, which was a cute series.  Should  have left well enough alone.",1408147200,,111,5.111111111111111
4311415,5,B004AUP3OY,Brent and Nancy Butt are super stars. Also we love the no laugh track.,1406505600,,70,4.071428571428571
4311416,5,B004AUP3OY,Roberson and Butt are hilarious,1406160000,,31,5.4
4311417,1,B004AUP3OY,"We were really excited about veiwing Hiccups because
we were such fans of Corner Gas and were sad to see it end.
But Hiccups is more like Throw-UP! Will not view second season.
Sorry but hiccups was way over the top!",1403395200,,216,4.2926829268292686
4311418,3,B004AUP3OY,"The saving grace for this series is the ultra clean production, otherwise I haven't felt so uncomfortable watching a show wishing to see something to laugh about.  The cast is left hamming every scene to make up for the lack of creativity in the writing.  If Brent makes another show, i'll probably buy it, but i just feel abused as a fan for leaving my hopes high about this show.",1395273600,,381,4.428571428571429
4311419,3,B004AUP3OY,"The first disc is great, especially the first episode.  If it were rated on its own, it would have five stars.
Disc 2 gets into too much of the other people with less focus on Millie, and I find it ruins the show's fun and light side.  Rated by itself, I'd only give it two stars.  Too bad they didn't keep the focus on Millie more since it could have easily gone for six seasons like Corner Gas did with the same two actors.",1394755200,,425,4.035714285714286
4311420,3,B004AUP3OY,was ok.....enjoyed show.guess it was cancelled.i will buy season 2 to have it......the wife of brent butt was totally cute babe,1387497600,,127,5.095238095238095
4311421,5,B004AUP3OY,"Loved Brent in Corner Gas.... this show was good too, but did not top the first show and the characters of Corner Gas.",1386979200,,118,4.173913043478261
4311422,5,B004AUP3OY,"I can't say enough about how much I enjoy Brent Butt and his wife, Nancy Robertson's, comic talent.  The only negative about this show, is I can't figure out which one is a more talented comic actor (or actress!).  I first was introduced to their skill in Corner Gas, and although it's still my favorite work of this duo's, I would have to say Hiccup's is a very close second.",1384214400,,376,4.357142857142857
4311423,4,B004AUP3OY,"I couldn't enjoy this show when I first started watching it just because I'm such a huge fan of Corner Gas and had a hard time seeing Brent Butt and Nancy Robertson as any characters other than Brent and Wanda.  Although, to my surprise, by the end of the season I found myself really looking forward to season 2 and kind of sad that there won't be a season 3.  It's definitely not a show for everyone but it's original and quirky.  The subject matter is much cleaner than most other shows on TV now-a-days so I didn't have to cringe if my daughter was in the room while I was watching it.",1374883200,3,589,4.1946902654867255
4311424,3,B004AUP3OY,"Bought this because it is done by Brent Butt who did, ""Corner Gas"", one of our absolute favorites.  This is not as good; but it is interesting to see.",1373241600,,150,4.172413793103448
4311425,5,B004AUP3OY,another CTV show with Brett Butt doing a different show like Corner Gas and having fun doing this newer show,1371168000,,108,4.45
4311426,3,B004AUP3OY,Being a huge fan of Corner Gas and Brett Butt's whit I decided to buy this season.  The first episode was fairly funny but the remaining are simply okay.  Love Brett and Nancy but the rest of the cast is dull and their attempted quirkiness doesn't come off at all the same as the characters on Corner Gas.  I have certainly seen far worse shows that are still on the air but this one was just a disappointment after the wonderful Corner Gas.,1371081600,5,441,4.289156626506024
4311427,1,B004AUP3OY,"This is definitely not worth the money and not even 10% as clever nor funny as Corner Gas. Frankly, the husband and wife team of Robertson and Butts seem to have run out of gas, and that's probably why there's no Season Two available. Sad, but I had to write this to try to warn others. I gave it three episodes and couldn't take it anymore.",1367452800,4,341,4.181818181818182
4311428,5,B004AUP3OY,"it is not up to ""Corner Gas"" with which I can not help but compare it, but definitely way up there.",1363478400,,99,3.761904761904762
4311429,2,B004AUP3OY,"Series is a BIG disappointment after Corner Gas. Too bad they sold off the Corner Gas set. Sometimes people should stick with what they do well and for these people, Hiccups is not it.",1358985600,,184,4.4411764705882355
4311430,4,B004AUP3OY,Loved the cast in Corner Gas and thought I would try this series.  Did not feel the chemistry among the cast.,1356480000,,109,4.190476190476191
4311431,3,B004AUP3OY,"This is a completely offbeat and zany comedy.  I liked it a lot and would recommend it.  It is good for children, and I imagine, adults, because I am one.",1348272000,,154,4.1
4311442,5,B004AUP3OY,"Delightful and funny. Canadian television shines again.  Nancy Robertson plays Millie Upton, a successful children's book author. She sees the world as a child.  She overacts to difficult situations with what her editor calls hiccups, these hiccups inspire her books. To deal with her hiccups she hires a life coach, Stan (Brent Butt), who has no formal training has his hands full trying to defuse her hiccups and help her understand them and why she reacts the way she does. Her overreactions are how most of us wish we could say or do. Nancy Robertson is as wonderful as she was in Corner Gas. Kudos to the writers on creativity and freshness and not relying on vulgar offensive language, violence and nudity to tell a story. Bought from Amazon.com, arrived perfect condition, great price and timely delivery.",1343347200,,812,4.91970802919708
4311443,5,B004AUP3OY,"Corner Gas fans expect a change of pace with Hiccups.  The dialogue is just as hilarious but the delivery is fast.  A bit of a jolt when you watch the first episode, but that episode leaves you wanting to see the next and then the rest as you get to know these quirky and entertaining characters.  The writing is again top notch. I'm looking forward to season two.",1341187200,,364,4.323529411764706
4311444,5,B004AUP3OY,"This is one of the funniest shows out there. Nancy Robertson & Brent Butt have again produced a wonderful product for adults & kids alike, my 12 year old son almost fell off the couch he was laughing so hard. As with Corner Gas, the gentle & clever humor pokes fun at the characters and modern life. It is a shame that folks south of the border don't know what they are missing.",1340496000,,378,4.191780821917808
4311445,5,B004AUP3OY,"After Corner Gas, I really liked this show. It's too bad that they only made two seasons. I could have watched it for years.",1334793600,,124,4.208333333333333
4311446,5,B004AUP3OY,"Look, i know it is not corner gas, but by itself , it is funny , and i loved it. The acting is great , and i enjoyed the characters...just wished they had made a second season:(",1328659200,,177,3.810810810810811
4311447,5,B004AUP3OY,"After watching ""Corner Gas"" I was happy to hear that Brent Butt had created another show starring himself and his ""real-life"" wife Nancy Robertson, who portrayed Wanda on ""Corner Gas"". I was worried that ""Hiccups"" wouldn't measure up to the humor and style of ""Corner Gas"", but after less than an episode my mind was at ease. I loved every minute of this show! I was very sad to find out that season 2 is the final season...",1324857600,17,424,4.448717948717949
4311448,5,B004AUP3OY,"Being fans of the dialogue, manic bursts, and deadpan humor of Corner Gas, I took a chance on this series and am too happy with it.  My wife has had to pause the dvd more than a few time to catch her breath while laughing.  We only hope that the second (and final) series becomes available sometime very soon. We went from never hearing of the series to then hating that it was cancelled so soon within a few episodes.",1321488000,11,418,4.2125
4311449,4,B004AUP3OY,"not as good as corner gas, but as you watch each episode it grows on you, was very pleasantly surprised
very glad i bought it waiting for season 2",1321315200,,146,4.068965517241379
4311450,3,B004AUP3OY,"We loved Corner Gas and were excited to hear Brent Butt had this new venture.

Two things we enjoyed about this series:

1. Nancy Robertson
2. Brent Butt

The rest of the characters never really jelled like the CG crew -- what a great cast that was.

If you like Brent Butt and Nancy Robertson, you'll enjoy this light comedic romp as it showcases Nancy's talents and Brent's writing skills.  Plus its pretty cheap entertainment at $10.",1321315200,11,436,4.6103896103896105
4311451,2,B004AUP3OY,"I was so happy when Brent Butt came out with another show...then I purchased and watched it.  The acting is forced.  The lines aren't that funny.  And Nancy R. seems out of place in her role.  Brent, c'mon....you can do better than this!  Brent's wife in the series is cute, but not believable as a spouse nor a gardener for that matter.  Her accent distracts from who she is supposed to be..not that an accent is bad, but her acting isn't all that keen either.  The show has it's cute moments, but overall, if it doesn't get much better, with great comedic timing and talent like ""Corner Gas"", then I can't continue watching.  :(",1314057600,2,630,4.464912280701754
8420936,1,B004AUP3OY,"Everyone in our family loved Corner Gas, and Dan for Mayor (which a lot of people hated) so we thought we'd enjoy this.  But no one could get into it.  Couldn't even finish.  Nancy's character is just annoying, acting completely erratic to the point that it's just stupid.  Characters have no chemistry, and are one dimensional, and bland.  Not funny at all.  Kind of painful even coming from the high bar set by Corner Gas.  And I really wanted to like it.",1527379200,,457,4.5
8420937,5,B004AUP3OY,"Really enjoyed this show.  Not nearly as good as Corner Gas but more humorous than most of what usually passes for comedy on TV.

Too bad it seems season 2 will never be released on DVD.",1522195200,,186,4.138888888888889
8420938,5,B004AUP3OY,"I loved Corner Gas, and this one grew on me after two episodes. In fact, it reminded me of the first time I saw Corner Gas and didn't know what to make of it, then absolutely adored it. The premise is hysterical and all the leading characters ""grow"" on you, even if you don't particularly like them at the outset. Even though the situations are over-the-top, they represent genuine human foibles in a charming - and funny - way.",1502409600,,428,4.430379746835443
8420939,4,B004AUP3OY,Funny but not Corner Gas,1473811200,,24,4.0
8420940,5,B004AUP3OY,"This is a funny - no, hilarious - offering from the zany minds of Brent Butt and Nancy Robertson. They are two of Canada's leading comedians and have dealt us a witty and entertaining show. They, of course, were the creator and stars of Corner Gas, a comedy set in a small town in Saskatchewan. I don't know how big the audience was in Canada for CG, but everyone I shared it with here in the States just loved it. Hiccups is no different.

Nancy is at her flamboyant best as Millie, a children's author with her brand of rage and Brent is generally overwhelmed and sometimes out of his depth as ""Stan Dirko"", life coach. The combination is charming at times, maddening at others. But, it is always entertaining. Perhaps the best part of this is that everyone knows people like Millie and Stan.

I'm greatly looking forward to season two. C'mon, I'm waiting....",1461196800,2,861,4.548387096774194
8420941,5,B004AUP3OY,"very funny up there with corner gas, shame Australian TV networks don't air these programs from Canada.",1446249600,,103,5.117647058823529
8420942,4,B004AUP3OY,Funny but becoming very predictable ...one season is enough to laugh.,1436227200,,69,5.363636363636363
8420943,3,B004AUP3OY,This series was ok; but not nearly as funny as Corner Gas.,1435449600,,58,3.9166666666666665
8420944,4,B004AUP3OY,"I'm a big fan of Brent Butt and Nancy Robertson - you know, a big fan of Corner Gas. This is an enjoyable show and I will probably buy season two, mostly because I have an huge crush on Paula Rivera. She plays Stan's (Butt) wife, Anna.
Stan is a life coach hired to help Millie (Roberston) deal with her ""Hiccups"": unfiltered public outbursts at the daily annoyances we all experience. The thing is is that Stan is not qualified to be life coaching anyone. Luckily Millie is enamored of his abilities and she's just happens to be a millionaire children's book author. And Stan is kept motoring along because of the sweetness and support of Anna.
I thought the premise set-up in the first show was great. Millie goes ballistic on some clueless numb-nuts holding up the line at the coffee shop because he can't decide what he wants. But the subsequent shows are just about Stan trying to mitigate Millie silliness throughout greater Vancouver BC. Watchable, enjoyable and no annoying laugh track.",1432598400,,994,4.718390804597701
8420945,2,B004AUP3OY,"I expected far more from the two Corner Gas stars.  Seemed frantic at times and a show rushed to production to capitalize of fans of the aforementioned show.  Has a few (very few) funny moments, but all in all, ain't worth the time watching to get to those parts.",1416009600,,263,4.346938775510204
