341293,1,6301627288,"This movie starts with this ugly little man who is annoying not to listen to, but also to look at. (You might recognize him from his best work in ""Silent Night Deadly Night Part 5"" with Mickey Rooney. [An equally unattractive man]) His wife is a pretty one in which in real life he would not have a chance. They have a kid during some radiation experimentation and end up with a kid that looks like Brad Douriff. (Coincidence? I think not). Later on Brad Douriff is a student/teacher (we really don't know what the heck he's doing there at the a college/high school [i think it's a college]). All we know is that he is an ugly man with a relationship with a pretty woman (in which we know he would have no chance with in real life [coincidence i think not] [the men his family must have a good personality]). And all the students at the school are wearing nazi-esque patches that are to protest the Nuclear  Power Plant that is to be built. (Why you may ask? Good question.) Anyways, whenever Douriff gets mad he sets people aflame. (So maybe the men in his family don't have the best of personalities) So the movie goes on to ""explain"" why he is ripping off Drew Barrymore from ""Firestarter"", but end screwing it all up and making no sense whatsoever. Also you find out that his ex-wife's grandfather raised him and his current girlfriend, even though they didn't know about each other. So his girlfriend is a sister/girlfriend/enemy-because-she-knew-about-his-condition/

ex-wifes competion for affection. Got that?? Good. The ending is horrific in the sense of ""Get me out of here before I burst into flames of confusion and frustration!""

If you liked this movie I recomend: The Mangler (another Tobe Hooper classic/mistake.

341294,4,6301627288,"I say that this DVD is for completists because I don't think these two films are going to end up on anyones top ten horror lists in the near or far future. BUT, you do get two at once here, and the films are somewhat interesting because of the talent involved, and it is a good deal. You get both films on a double sided disc, and that is a good thing if you are looking to see as many films as possible (like me).
SOCIETY is directed by Brian Yuzna (of Bride of Re-animator fame), and the special ""surreal"" effects are done by Screaming Mad George, who has worked on many, many films.  It is about a teenager who thinks that everyone is not what they seem, and that he is paranoid.  Ideas are not explored fully, but the film tries, and deserves a look.  Yuzna includes a commentary, and the film is letterboxed.  Overall, society would rate a 3 out of 5 stars due to its plot snowballing out of control, but for people who just want to see a modern effects master do his thing, stick around for the last half hour of this film.  Devin Devasquez also plays a part.
SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION stars Brad Dourif (one flew over the cukoo's nest, childs play, two towers- Grima Wormtongue) and is directed by Tobe Hooper.  It is letterboxed, there is a trailer included and not much else, but the film is mildly interesting, especially in reenacting a bomb test from the 50's.  Overall the film is not great, but it does have mood at times. The soundtrack is especially effective when using an old standard: ""I don't want to set the world on fire.""
Is the DVD worth buying?  Well, it is if you want to see as many films as possible.  If you are a horror fan and have not seen them then yes it is worth buying (or renting).  BUT, if you want to see a great horror film, and do not want to see every film that comes along, you may be better off seeing RE-ANIMATOR, and FROM BEYOND (in Yuzna's case, he was involved in those).  For Tobe Hooper you need only to see the first two TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE films to see how he became such a well known horror director.
Hope this review helps.",1070928000,11,2078,4.275510204081633
341295,3,6301627288,"The silliness begins in 1955 with newlyweds Brian and Peggy Bell undergoing a secret government experiment to give humans an increased resistance to radiation. As an unfortunate side effect, (don't all nuclear experiments have icky side effects?)their newborn child has developed the ability to cause people to burst into flame. Alas, Brian and Peggy are our first victims and our first hint that this is not going to be a special-effects masterpiece.
Jump to the present-day (late 80's) and our little firestarter is all grown up in the form of university student, Sam Kramer (Brad Dourif). Sam's opening scene is a school play audition wherein his performance is so pathetically bad that even his loving fiance, Lisa (Cynthia Bain) tells him not to quit his day job. If this scene was meant to ease the audience into Dourif's unconventional manner of acting by poking fun at him, it doesn't work, because we'll get to cringe a whole lot more as Dourif spends the rest of the film screaming and bugging his eyes out in an over-the-top performance that, for many other actors, would be a career-ending one. Even if this movie had a decent director, Dourif is woefully miscast and should really stick to roles that welcome complete psychosis like Grima Wormtongue (The Two Towers) and Piter De Vries (Dune).
Cynthia Bain doesn't fare much better, which is a shame because she does show some promise and is one of the better actors in the movie. Indeed, seeing her smiling face early on, while dressed in some attractive, if outdated outfits is one of the few bright points of the film. Unfortunatley, the screenplay soon has her bouncing between moderate to extreme hysteria, reminiscent of the closing scenes of Pumpkinhead, but without the believable motivation. It is actually a testament to her acting abilities that she can keep a straight, albeit tortured face through an increasingly ludicrous and muddled plot. In one scene, while driving her deteriorating, flamethrower of a boyfriend to the doctor, she has to alternately comfort and express her love for him while dodging the jets of flame shooting out of a hole in his arm. With driving skills like these she belongs in NASCAR, not this whacked-out flick.
If you think this sounds completely insane, just wait, it gets better - or worse depending on how you like your camp. After all, the words, ""subtle"" and ""Tobe Hooper"" are never found in the same sentence, let alone the same screenplay. As with Hooper's other works like Poltergeist and Lifeforce, the level of chaos and zaniness can only escalate, but in this case, on a very limited budget. Soon Sam Kramer is inadvertently toasting everyone around who even mildly upsets him - from a snotty radio producer (John Landis in a cameo role) to a friendly old security guard to an evil doctor/scientist who's trying to inject our poor hero with some green goo that looks fresh out of a cylume stick. All of this culminates in one of moviedom's most memorably silly climaxes that will leave you either laughing hysterically or uttering a very large: ""huh?"".
Bottom line: If you enjoy campy movies, Spontaneous Combustion can be quite fun at times. Unfortunately, the film is laced with enough seemingly serious acting and overtones to give the viewer the feeling that it wasn't meant to be funny. This, combined with a demented musical score and some seriously flawed writing make for an experience that can only be truly enjoyed by die-hard Brad Dourif (or Cynthia Bain) fans.
As far as this DVD version goes, the transer is very so-so and the only extra offered is a theatrical trailer. Blech.",1041292800,4,3607,4.895424836601308
341296,5,6301627288,"spontaneous combustion
Function: noun
: self-ignition of combustible material through chemical action (as oxidation) of its constituents -- called also spontaneous ignition

The thought of inanimate objects -- such as a pile of rags, or an old collection of tools -- spontaneously bursting into flames, is terrifying.  Well, imagine if there was such a thing as spontaneous HUMAN combustion!  Pretty scary, huh?

For Sam, it's not only scary, it's reality.

Sam always knew that there was something wrong with him, but he couldn't quite figure out the origin of his problem.  After years of research, Sam discovers that his parents had been used in a number of atomic-weapons experiments shortly before he was born.  The government was attempting to engineer the perfect weapon for war.  When the project fails, the government hides all evidence of the project, and it becomes a tightly-kept secret.

Or did it?

No!

As a result of Sam's parents' repeated exposure to radiation, both of their genetic codes were changed, eventually being passed onto their first (and only) child, Sam.  Because of the radiation running through his veins, Sam discovers that he has the uncanny ability to make things AND PEOPLE burst into flames.

Talk about getting ""hot under the collar""!

""Spontaneous Combustion"" is a masterful horror/sci-fi movie by one of the most talented filmmakers in the industry - Tobe Hooper (""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Poltergeist"").",1035504000,7,1451,5.252173913043478
7813407,5,6301627288,"Unlike most reviews of this movie that talk about how bad this movie is and how this was one of Tobe Hoopers worst films, all those reviews I completely disagree with. This is easily Hoopers last great film and a very well executed film at that. The story line is simple, Brad Dourif plays the role of Sam in the movie. He finds out that his parents were part of an experiment that had to do with the atomic bomb and that later would kill them. As an adult, Sam discovers he has a great power to control fire and electricity but with horrible results to his body after using them. This all lead to a very odd and some what anticlimactic ending. This is good because the movie plays very dramatically and at times can be almost depressing. Brad Dourif plays a very good role in this movie (Unlike what other reviewers say) and the rest of the cast does a good job also. The only downside of the movie is the special effects were mediocre and could have been better. But, this does not take away from the movie at all. Also, to set the record straight, the only similarity to this and ""Firestarter"" is the main character can control fire. Other than that, these are two completely different movies. So, if you have been disappointed in Tobe Hooper's work in the past 10 to 12 years and you have not seen this movie, I say buy it. This truly is a great movie. 9 stars",1524787200,,1364,4.290697674418604

7813411,4,6301627288,"I ordered this out of print set because I'm a big Brad Dourif fan and I must say, that although Tobe Hooper may never have reached the level of Texas Chainsaw Massacre again, he still is a very serviceable director in the genre. Knowing that this was going to be a B movie, I had an idea of what I was getting into and the film did not disappoint. It's a fun little horror/thriller/scifi flick where Dourif steals the show yet again.

Society, which was directed by Brian Yuzna (producer of Re-Animator and director of Bride of Re-Animator) turned out to be another fun little flick. Pretty good special effects by Screaming Mad George, who has been around the block a fee times.

If you're looking for top notch horror, this probably isn't the purchase to make. If you are a horror hound like myself, I think you would probably enjoy both films.",1406678400,,846,4.522875816993464

7813414,3,6301627288,"Two campy movies about people in power and the control they exert.  In each, one character slips out of control so the movies have a common theme even if they seem completely different.

In the first movie, a high-school student feels he does not fit in with his rich family and their associates.  His fears combine with suspicions from others not in favor and a horrifying picture begins to emerge.  Finally his safety is in jeopardy and he challenges the horrific Society.

In the second movie we have a man who was born after a nuclear test designed to immunize people against radiation.  He knows nothing of his past, only that suddenly people around him are being burned to death.  His fears and concerns drive him to uncover his past and the lengths others have gone to in order to control all aspects of his life.  Unfortunately the film ends rather suddenly.

Although billed as a Drive-In Double Feature, each movie occupies a different side of a single disk so you can't just sit back and watch them both without flipping the disk.  Each movie is accompanied by its trailer and a commentary.  Picture quality is good and some of the acting is quite good even with some of the horrible lines.  All in all just what you would expect from a pair of Drive-In horror movies.",1152662400,3,1279,4.58590308370044
7813415,2,6301627288,"I remembered seeing this when I was younger and really freaking out over the carousel scene where the parents are in the bed all hot for each other. I mean, really HOT. Flaming hot in fact. That scared the (blank) out of me!

Now that I am no longer a wee lad, but am a bit older and wiser, I watched this movie with great interest. One word: ""Huh?"" This is the freakiest movie ever. And I don't mean that in a good way. It is Dumb with a capital D. Brad Dourif is weird, man. It freaks me out to even look at the guy. And the story is really lame. A psychic radio show guy gets set on fire through the phone. Sam's mentor turnes out to be an EVIL MADMAN who is trying to set him up with his sister/girlfriend Lisa so that together they will breed and create the ULTIMATE SECRET GOVERNMENT WEAPON so that this crazy guy can have THE ULTIMATE POWER. Uh, sorry. You kind of lost me back there somewhere...

The ending is... uh, funky. Some bad special effects with a memorable last line: ""Lisa, I can take your fire."" Then the movie just ends. What? It just stops. Like, ""Okay that's it. You can all go home now. Sorry for wasting your time.""

This movie would have had a great theme song if they had used The Doors' ""Light My Fire"". I can definitely see telling Cynthia Bain to ""Come on baby light my fire."" I give this movie 2 stars instead of 1 because... well I'm not sure why really. I guess I just like to witness Brad Dourif's flame-sprouting dementia.",1124928000,2,1457,4.196428571428571
7813416,3,6301627288,"I liked this movie, but there were alot of loop holes in it's logic and the end was horrible. One loop hole is 2 caracters are riding in a car, and one begins shooting flames all over the place. Neither gets even scorched.  But by the end of the movie, the one character is burnt pretty bad. On the other hand, the movie takes a creepy surreality at times that if it had maintained, this wold have been a classic. Example is at one point 2 characters are discussing the situation, and in the middle of the conversation voices from the radio add clues to the mystery. The 1950's Area 51 atmosphere is a plus. The ending makes no real sence. I do like ths movie, and love parts, but over all, the end was crap.",1115078400,2,708,4.205882352941177
