2942325,5,B000VJ3E58,"Bizarre has aged much more gracefully than one might expect.

Sure, it dates from a time when names like Bella Abzug, Henry Kissinger, Fred Silverman and Tom Snyder were punchlines in and of themselves (though barely, and more often because they simply sounded funny as punchlines), and sure, host/cast leader John Byner was probably given too many opportunities to run through a surprisingly limitd (for his talents) range of impersonations that had been serving him well since the Sullivan show in the 60's (Paul Lynde, Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, Marlon Brando, Ed Sullivan, Johnny Mathis and John Wayne to be precise, and usually in the form of ""audition reel"" sketches for famous movie and TV characters like The Godfather and Fantasy Island's Herve Villechaize), but having just transferred several season's worth of old Betamax tapes to DVD-r for safe keeping not long before this DVD series started appearing, I can safely say I still found myself chuckling at regular intervals despite knowing much of this material from heart. As such, this review DOES reference some of the sketches contained within this volume, as well as some that appear on other volumes, or not at all *yet"")

The show's writers, directors and cast had a remarkable collective ability to spin old jokes into seemingly fresh full length sketches that would usually feature heavy padding via Byner's antics and asides. Distill just about any sketch down to it's raw elements - minus sets, cast, and the usual digressions for time - and you've got jokes that had been done on any number of variety shows in the decade before this one - Bizarre reformulated the brew in large part by added healthy doses of cynicism, sexism and slapstick violence - and of course the naked women (an earlier poster was right in noticing a thankfully mute Ziggy Lorenc as a piece of furniture, but failed to point out she was wearing a bikini like four other ""pieces"" placed in a slum apartment rented out by crotchety landlord Byner).

The cast list here fails to give credit to the contributions of many bit players who went on to greater things, most notably Canada's own Mike Myers (as Byner's nephew in a show closer in which Byner reacts to a review that claims he stuffs the audience with relatives, only to learn that all but one audience member is family!), future Crow villain Michael Wincott (look closely at the Mexican Nephew seated beside Luba Goy in the legendary Bigot Family sketches), future CBC broadcaster Ralph Benmergui (for what that's worth) and Matt Craven (as a thieving bit player). Donnelly Rhodes, another Canadian mainstay who had a memorable run on the U.S. sitcom Soap, plays one of Super Dave Osborne's stunt coordinators in a second-season sketch involving a mechanical bull. There were others, including Pat Morita, a spectacularly-unfunny-even-then Victoria Jackson, SCTV's Dave Thomas (whose famous 'dueling evangelists sketch' with Byner is included on one of these DVDs), and a young standup comedian named Howie Mandel, though guest stand-ups were generally more along the lines of Willie Tyler and Lester.

In the first and, to a lesser extent, the second seasons, Bizarre would include sketches filmed outside of Toronto, including an amusing bit (available on Vol. 2) filmed in an L.A. cemetery in which ""priest"" Redd Foxx sends bad TV shows to their rightful resting places surrounded by a platoon of Let's Make A Deal contestants), a segment where golfer Dick Van Dyke wades into a pond to try and win the PGA championship, and a peculiar filmed segment where a gorilla holds up a grocery store and speeds off in a stolen Mercedes.

When something clicked on Bizarre, viewers could rest assured the idea would be tweaked and repeated on a future episode. Witness the ever-increasing insanity of the Super Dave Osborne stunts, or the ""Byner Originals"", in which the host would claim to be introducing some new comedy creation - Boy John, Johnny Jackson - that were blatant ripoffs of actual personalities of the day which would prompt producer Bob Einstein to interrupt the sketch, calmly berate Byner, and then suffer a litany of insults in return (""it's called the wandering Jew and it'll be here in about 5 seconds"", went one memorable line from a similar sketch). The Byner originals are mostly absent from these DVDs, presumably due to song rights.

The aforementioned Bigot Family proved popular enough to fill several repeat sketches with well-delivered ethnic humor. And although 90's syndication episodes usually excised the 'watermelon' gag that ended each sketch, they're reinstated for these DVD versions. Other popular returning characters included the Reverend T.V. Seewell, who broadcast from the Enzlo Veal Animal Healing Pavilion (the location of which changed from bit to bit), a Yoga For Health instructor with fake stretchy legs who invariably closed his sketch to Devo's Whip It, and a perennially bottom-rated news team (AWN) featuring a sportscaster who only favored black athletes, a drunken film reviewer (Saul Rubinek in the first sketch) kept on a leash, a clueless weatherman (Don Lake) with an atrocious toupee and a lead anchor (Byner) who took exception to his the bitter digs of co-anchor Deb McGrath by punching her out of her chair.

Another great repeat gag was often played on regular Tom Harvey, who would be whisked from a sketch to correct a supposed makeup problem, only to return to the set for a reshoot and discover doors nailed shut, breakaway furniture and real booze in the glasses. Audience members were often used to supplant ""under whelming"" actors, or to heap further indignity on Tom Harvey.

And finally, long before Conan O'Brien thought he came up with the idea, the creators of Bizarre used the process of superimposing real lips over cardboard celebrity cutouts to often delirious effect (politicians of the time singing cheesy love ballads, for example)

Bizarre's peak seasons were probably 1982, 1983, 1984, and certain parts of 1985-86, after which other comedy shows on then burgeoning cable networks (and regular broadcast TV) started to steal their thunder, signaling an end to the sketch comedy format as many had known it throughout the 60's and 70's. Nonetheless, these shows represent one of the last bastions of political incorrectness in broadcast comedy, particularly for something shown on a major Canadian network during early prime time hours!

At long last available on DVD, BIZARRE might not provide the hearty laughs it once did to those of us who were there to witness it during its initial run, but there are still many fondly recalled laughs to be savored in these volumes. And since these discs are uncut, we Canadians can finally see the boobies for the first time.",1342915200,9,6748,5.033124440465532
2942326,3,B000VJ3E58,"Bizarre was a series of half hour sketches which ran on CTV and Showtime for about five years in the early eighties.  Humour was ""broad"" and slapstick with ""star"" Jn. Byner doing numerous ingenious personality impressions.  Sometimes notable up and comers--both actors (e.g. Maury Chakin) and comedians, particularly noticeable Victoria Jackson and others (including Howie Mandell) appeared periodically as well as veterans like Henny Youngman.

DVDs have been minimally edited--most noticeable the elimination of Super Dave Osborne's hilarious lip sync rendition of Dolly Parton's ""9 to 5""--and the shows are not arranged in chronological order.  I've had trouble with two of the eight out of ten discs that I have watched--most notably with menus that failed to operate properly.

Despite these problems a wonderful opportunity of reminiscing and remembering--and actually a few genuinely funny skits (as well as many clinkers also).  Byner was certainly a gifted and versatile impressionist!

Additional note--when presented on television the shots of women's breasts were ""blacked out"" and the swear words ""beeped"".  These ""censors"" actually made the television versions funnier!",1326153600,,1183,5.72
2942327,2,B000VJ3E58,"Got a great price for a new set of the entire series.  Two reviewers loved it and one hates it.  All my life I've been surrounded by people who love ""comedy"" that I can't stand, and never heard of some of my favorite stuff (e.g., Dangerfield movie ""Meet Wally Sparks""), let alone disliked it..  No way am I not going to take a chance of something that's odd and two people loved.  The guy who hates it may be right, but comedy is too important to let other people cut me off from it.  If I don't like it, I'll stop watching.  The upside vs the downside is worth more than the $30 I'm paying.  Nobody tells me what's funny -- I decide.

Will update after watching.

Saw my comment today and realized I have a duty to watch this.  It's over 2 1/2 years since I bought it and I just gave it about 15 minutes and it's awful.  I love comedy -- hey, everybody loves comedy -- but I can't explain why stuff many find funny I find lame.  The first time we see the host, he does an Ed Sullivan impersonation, and things go downhill from there.  The sketches I've seen play as typewritten -- may look funny on paper, but not as performed.  Well, you can't argue about this.  In case you're wondering, I have enjoyed hundreds of comedy films going back to the silent era, and went mad about SCTV.  But what can you do about taste? I never liked Ghostbusters.",1313539200,6,1351,4.202334630350195

2942330,5,B000VJ3E58,"Bizarre was a comedy series that ran for 6 seasons on Showtime in the early 80s and featured outrageous politically incorrect humor with occasional nude scenes. It was unusually HILARIOUS! Very few shows can actually rip the laugh right out of you but Bizarre is one of those rare excellent comedy shows that does it more often than just about any other comedy show. Fans of SNL, SCTV and similar shows are in for a real shock if they check out this series. Bizarre had many more GREAT sketches than not, and in my opinion none of them are awful. The charming dimwit stuntman 'Super Dave' got his start in this series and his funniest stunts are in these episodes. Also another comedy sketch classic 'The Bigots' (a family of broad 'ethnic diversity' who continuously hurl slurs at each other) are featured in many of these episodes. Each disc contains 4 hours of episodes (they are dual layer so the picture quality is very good)! This is the way DVD collections should be done!

This show showcased edgy humor without taking itself too seriously. I watched this as a kid (yes, a kid), and enjoyed it same as I had ""The Benny Hill Show"". The last edgy sketch show worth it's salt was ""In Living Color"", but ""Bizarre"" was for me the jump off point in to humor, and it's a joy to have 10 whole volumes of this show in my library.

8219010,5,B000VJ3E58,"If you were a North American teenage boy in 1980 who loved subversive TV comedy, then you had to know, and love, the Bizarre show starring John Byner (who, as of this writing, just turned an astonishing 80 years old).

This sketch show was a new concept at the time, airing on both CTV in Canada and the Showtime Cable network in the U.S.

I always thought the title a misnomer (and why give a sketch comedy show a sci-fi Twilight Zone-type logo and starry night look?).  Its more like olden-days burlesque (with obvious showgirls in the female parts) than, say, Monty Python-type weirdo sketches. Twister might have been a better name!

Anyway, the host, master comedian and impressionist John Byner, was on a career high at this time; moving well beyond his early stand-up appearances on the Ed Sullivan Show, the Tonight Show, then a plum role as Detective Donahue on the sitcom Soap...now this, a star vehicle, Bizarre, what he described in an interview as ""a show-offs dream come true.""

Bizarre lasted for 6 years (3 times longer than I originally thought) which is quite a good run for a sketch or variety show. There were only ever three writers at the most, the prolific Archie Cham, Paul Grosney, and Jackie Kahane. I mainly remember CTV having to censor the topless women and bleep the swear words. When you're young, this is a kick all by itself, and tends to colour your memory of Bizarre as sleazy and cheap, as well as monotonous, particularly the Super Dave sketches, which tended to be thin variations on the same grotesque distorted-body gags. With our stupid PC world today, Bizarre theoretically shouldnt hold up, given its frequent reliance on old boys' club Playboy Magazine cartoon humor. Still...a joke not demeaning to women is, by default, demeaning to men, is it not?  Why is this OK?  More to the point, since when are jokes and sketches real life?

What a surprise then, to revisit the Bizarre show and see how its actually improved with age! It seems the original intent was indeed to do it like Monty Pythons Flying Circus, up to a point, having sketches start off conventionally, in a living room, for instance, then go off on strange tangents (Byner pulling people from the audience to play roles; Byner interrupting a sketch and treating the camera like his doctor's examining him from home).

In fact, the real joy of rediscovering Bizarre decades later is the sheer variety of comedy it presents, not just the bawdy or weird stuff or slapstick or cartoony stuff but much that is also verbal and clever and even conventional (door to door psychiatry), pantomime, old-time stand-up (Henny Youngman), ""new"" stand-up (Howie Mandel), and, Byner's many impressions (showcased to best effect in audition sketches; showing Byner playing stars such as Rodney Dangerfield or Jerry Lewis, who try out for, say, Fantasy Island or Tootsie).

My favorite recurring sketch is the Bigot Family, where the Irish dad, Italian son, Polish wife, black brother-in-law, Mexican nephew and Jewish daughter all tell ethnic jokes to each other via put downs; as satire on bigotry it's multilayered and ingenious, not to mention hilarious.

Another big asset in Bizarre is big Bob Einstein, the shows real-life producer, and, possessor of the finest deadpan since Buster Keaton, who will interrupt sketches (""John? JohnWhat are you doin'?"") he feels have become too silly or offensive.  This is reminiscent of Graham Chapmans Colonel character on Monty Python, but Einstein instead wisely adopts a stone-faced glare and a looming kind of schoolteacher-ish menace, itself punctured hilariously when he speaks, in that distinctively dry, croaking, cracking adolescent voice of his!

The remaining supporting cast is able if undistinguished; including Billy Van, whom in straight grey hair, big glasses, and his own stony glare in his various roles as businessmen, customers, waiters, etc. is almost unrecognizable as the capering looney from other classic Canadian TV shows as Party Game or Hilarious House of Frightenstein! To his credit, he certainly never upstages Byner.

Bizarre, being old, is no way as hip or slick as Kids In The Hall or Key and Peel or Amy Schumer. But that's part of its simple, chintzy, 1980s videotape charm; all encompassed in the hyperactive genius of host and principal player John Byner.

If talent can be weighed to have value, then John Byner, who can do so many things; sing, dance, do impressions, do slapstick, do mime, play subtle and broad and all points in between, is, pound for pound, the greatest, most likeable comedian who ever lived; the complete package.  His sheer, unrestrained, un-jaded love of his work is invigorating, engrossing, captivating.  Of course, some shows are better than others, thats a given.  But to me, John Byner himself never, ever coasts, or fails to please.  A man doing what he was put on this earth to do, and doing it better than anybody else.

See the John Byner masterpiece Bizarre.",1498608000,,4966,4.960240963855422
