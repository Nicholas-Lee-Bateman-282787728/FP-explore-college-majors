8030668,5,B0002Q9WCY,"I got these two movies for my granddaughter for Christmas ~ and it is a staple in our home, as well.  Who couldn't love this version of Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder? Don't get me started about the ""other"" Willy Wonka that came out a couple years ago.. that was an atrocity!  Gene Wilder is truly a warm, loving mentor in this Willy Wonka movie, and it's just one of those films that leaves you feeling so good inside!  Regarding the Wizard of Oz, I've been watching that movie for over 40 years, and watched it with my sons, and now my granddaughter.  Willy Wonka and Wizard of Oz are must have's for any good family movie collection.  FAST shipping, excellent quality products.",1174953600,,678,4.479674796747967
