7763912,5,B01GKFUZHG,Although my copy of this movie had the same issue mentioned in the other review it also fixed itself right away and it was around the end of the movie for me. It'd be nice to not have a glitch but I don't want to chance getting a copy that has more glitches. Hopefully they figure out a fix. I love the movie though.,1471478400,,316,3.953125
7763913,5,B01GKFUZHG,"Great movie, great songs..laugh out loud fun! Only problem is the Blu Ray disc. This is my second copy and both have the same problem at the 1:39 minute mark. The picture slightly screws up..at first it almost pixelates but then just dragsthen it fixes itself. I will keep this one but they need to fix this. Well worth the second watchingand many more! Great soundtrack too!",1469232000,2,375,4.611940298507463

This is a movie that is rarely found anywhere above standard-definition.

Unfortunately, it's a bit of a mixed bag.

Right off the bat: this is a BD-R disc. The disclaimer says it won't play on Xbox One but I had no issues with my copy. It comes in a normal case but unfortunately the quality is a bit iffy.

Video quality: I'd rate this about a 3-3.5. It's probably the best the movie will look, but it's filled with grain, overly saturated and uses lots of blurring effects (aka the ""star trek filter""). Definite improvement over the DVD, but that's to be expected. Overall quality really varied from shot to shot. It definitely felt inconsistent.

Audio: I didn't run it through the home theater, so I don't know if it's anything special. There is 1 audio track and my guess would be probably a Stereo one. Definitely do-able, but even on a soundbar it was a bit lacking. I know the DVD had 5.1 surround at least.

Extras: None... unless you count ""subtitles""
The DVD had the original black & white film from 1936, behind the scenes, commentary and more.

Overall, it's a mixed bag. An upgrade over the DVD (in terms of picture quality) but nothing amazing. If you're a big fan, it's worth checking out for sure. If you don't own it, go for the Blu-Ray version for the best experience.",1490054400,2,1369,4.456
8763148,5,B01GKFUZHG,"Saw this at a small theater in Los Angeles years ago. This is the same cast so it felt very familiar.  I do wish that they had filmed it more like the play. While still a lot of fun to watch, it seems a little over produced for the small play that it was.",1487376000,,255,3.7222222222222223
8763149,5,B01GKFUZHG,Gift for someone else.,1481846400,,22,4.75
8763150,2,B01GKFUZHG,"This movie is great, one of my faves but the problem with this blu-ray is that it has no features whatsoever! Not even a scene selection! My advice? Buy the DVD for the features and the blu-ray for the movie itself.",1480291200,3,215,4.2682926829268295
