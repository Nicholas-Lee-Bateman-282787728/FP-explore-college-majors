7545034,5,B018ELUCUY,"This movie is one excellent look into one of the front runners of the Dallas/Fort Worth metal scene. It takes you in depth through some of the highs and lows of the insanity that is Rigor Mortis. Having Phil Anslemo narrate this story just further solidifies the impact Rigor Mortis had on the metal scene, not just DFW. Another wonderful highlight is the interviews and tidbits from the late great Mike Scaccia(Rest in Peace). He was the fastest right hand around, and wit just as quick to match. The whole Rigor crew are a bunch of crazy characters, and this movie shows off all of it. Wonderful movie, a must for any metal head!!! Can't wait for part 2!!",1449705600,,657,4.529411764705882
7545035,5,B018ELUCUY,Great documentary. It is fun to hear the story directly from Mike Scaccia and the whole band. It also shows how different the music industry was then. I would recommend this for sure.,1449532800,,183,4.575757575757576
7545036,5,B018ELUCUY,An amazing documentary on the Fort Worth band Rigor Mortis. The Thrash Legends go in depth to the good times and to the tough times. Truly an amazing film. A must see for any metal fan.,1449532800,,185,4.166666666666667
8742056,3,B018ELUCUY,"I've been a big Rigor Mortis fan since the first CD came out.  It was actually one of the first CDs I ever bought.  So, a documentary on the band was something I was definitely interested in.  The actual product, though, is a little mixed.

The main weakness here is getting Phil Anselmo to narrate.  Phil is, quite simply, an idiot.  He talks excruciatingly slow and he ""poses"" with his voice, trying to sound ""tough"" or ""cool"" or whatever, but he overdoes it and the result is just silly.  I really don't know what's trying to convey, or if he's just nodding off, but every time he started that fake, slow inflection I wanted to reach for the fast forward button to get past it.  Urrrr-urr-uhhh-urrr-uhhhh-urrr.  He takes forever to say anything and it's so mocked-up it's practically self-parody.  It's about one of the world's fastest bands and they pick a narrator who croaks along like he's doing a bad Henry Kissinger imitation, and it's unendurable.  I believe he's a sincere fan of the band (who wouldn't be?) but... I don't really care.  It seemed like a third of the documentary was dealing with him, and he's not in Rigor Mortis.  I'm not a Phil fan, and there was too much of him here.

That aside, there are some interesting stories here... and a lot of extra, dragged-out info that is less interesting.  And, I'm sorry, but some of the guys in the band come across as jerks.  This may be a case of it's better not to know quite as much as is revealed.. but, then again, at least they're honest.  The stories about getting in fights with entire bars for no real reason are interesting, even if it seems like kind of a stupid thing to do.  And it could have used a lot more live footage.  I don't know how much actually exists from that time, but if there was any more, it would have helped a lot.

It's frustrating that it ends right as they're about to put the first album out.  It's like a big lead-up and ends right when they're about to get to the good part.  I wanted to find out what resulted in the one not-so-hot Rigor Mortis album (Rigor Mortis Vs. The Earth), but we never get there.  I know this is just ""chapter one"" and I hope there actually will be a documentary covering the rest of their career -- complaints aside, I'll buy it -- but all too often things like this are never followed up.  I'm hoping they will, but please, please, please next time leave Phil out of it.  You could have covered the whole career in 90 minutes if you had a narrator who could actually speak instead of slowly burping out word like a sleepwalking toad.",1518998400,2,2563,4.3906581740976645
8742057,5,B018ELUCUY,Goes way back to teen years and first bands. I dug it a lot.,1501718400,,60,3.357142857142857
8742058,1,B018ELUCUY,"good band , but the worst documentary i have seen. hardly any live footage, what little there was was terrible.all you get is the band members and phil anselmo sitting in a chair interviewed seperately. would be ok as bonus dvd ,when buy a cd. But  a complete rip off as actual documentary. Hopefully this will save someone else from wasting their money.",1486512000,4,354,4.619047619047619

8742060,5,B018ELUCUY,"I have to chime in with another 5 star. Best (and only, at least that I know of ) documentary about of Dallas underground metal scene of the 80s and the rivalry between Pantera and the guys from the other side of the track. The documentary is about an amazing and underrated group of musicians which have collectively produced or been a part of creating an amazing body of music. With Phil Anselmo narrating, the documentary tells the good, bad, ugly and pretty damn funny behind the scenes details of how this underdog had its day and ended up being signed with Capitol Records before (and much to dismay of) the golden boys of mighty Pantera.",1453075200,,644,4.560344827586207
8742061,5,B018ELUCUY,"On February 12th its time to welcome back four of the rowdiest bastards to ever take over the Dallas Ft Worth music scene.  Its time to learn how they did it, what happened when they did it, and what changed because they did it.  Its time to hear The Story of Rigor Mortis!

Narrated by Philip H. Anselmo Welcome To Your Funeral:  The Story of Rigor Mortis Part 1 details the formation of one of the heaviest bands to come from the Dallas Ft Worth area and how they got signed to Capitol Records in 1987.  The majority of the film features on camera interviews with managers, club owners, former band members, fellow musicians, label representatives, and the four main participants themselves (singer Bruce Corbitt, guitarist Mike Scaccia, bassist Casey Orr, and drummer Harden Harrison) talking about all facets of the early years of Rigor Mortis.
Its all here;  the bands they were in, the friends they hung with, the clubs they played, the fights they were in, they shit they did to make ends meet and how they stayed focused on succeeding and get that record deal.

Guitarist Mike Scaccia (who passed away in 2012) is featured prominently and discusses how Rigor Mortis took their love of horror movies and wrote songs that paid homage to such films as Evil Dead, Basket Case, Re-Animator and others that they watched religiously.  Musicians will dig the film for its upfront look at what it took in the early eighties for a heavy metal band to break out of the hair band scene.  Fans of Rigor Mortis will enjoy the numerous personal photos shown and all the behind the scene stories that are told of the bar brawls and early shows, including found footage of practices and on stage performances.  Music fans collectively will walk away from watching the film learning more about the impact Rigor Mortis had so many people.  Stories of Rigor Mortis with Pantera and Megadeth are told as well and several interviews with Phil Anselmo are used from early on in his career through more recent times.

Welcome To Your Funeral:  The Story of Rigor Mortis Part 1 won Best Documentary at the 2014 Housecore Film Festival.  Youll understand why once you watch this brilliant film.",1452729600,,2176,4.722222222222222
8742062,5,B018ELUCUY,"Absolutely amazing. This is the best possible documentary for anyone that loves metal, anyone that grew up in Dallas.  These awesome boys changed the face of music, but especially the face of Dallas music. RIGOR MORTIS!!!!!!  So much love to them!!!  This is an amazing piece of music history. I can't recommend it enough.",1451952000,,322,4.925925925925926
8742063,5,B018ELUCUY,"I've only had this DVD for a few days & have already watched it 3 times with friends and family, plus at the premiere in Dallas. Fantastic documentary! If you were remotely part of the metal scene back on the 80s, especially if you lived in the DFW Metroplex, this DVD will bring back some really fond memories of the era. Even if you weren't necessarily familiar with Rigor Mortis, you will love this DVD. The music is awesome and there's a surprising amount of footage of the band from back in the day. Narrated by Phil Anselmo, a long-time, diehard fan of Rigor, Phil does a pretty good job of leading the audience along Rigor's path to success. Can't wait for Part 2!",1451260800,,671,4.419354838709677
8742064,5,B018ELUCUY,"I bought the debut album Rigor Mortis without hearing a note. Radio didn't play bands of this ilk so I took the gamble which most Metal fans did BITD cause that's what you did. I loved it. I dug the music and the Horror theme. I became a Facebook friend with Bruce Corbitt and he had some lengthy history stories that I never knew because the magazines never really printed stories on them. So hearing these crazy stories for the first time from Bruce was awesome. So now anyone who buys this DVD gets the blood and guts of the Rigor Mortis story unfiltered and REAL!

The thing I really dig about this DVD is.......it's warts and all. It ain't pretty. It's an unflinching story about how 4 dudes end up becoming this amazing Metal band in total detail. AND this is only part one. It's not just a testimony to being in a Metal band and causing chaos it's also about friendship and dedication. It's also a great music documentary that I think surpasses many thrown together behind the scenes music documentaries. But as a Rigor fan it's great to hear the backstory. Can't wait for Pt. 2!",1450137600,,1086,4.457286432160804
8742065,5,B018ELUCUY,"What a fantastic way to experience the unbelievable history of the Texas chainsaw massacre of music! Having not grown up in the DFW scene, I appreciate the in-depth and well organized narration of the metal scene history. Rigor Mortis has always been an important band in the metal world, but hearing the stories and history explained by the band members and others who were apart of the madness, made for an incredibly entertaining and educational film! I highly recommend this documentary to anyone even mildy interested in music, heavy metal, horror movies, Texas history, or the the classic underdog victory story! Bring on part 2!",1450051200,,635,5.057142857142857
