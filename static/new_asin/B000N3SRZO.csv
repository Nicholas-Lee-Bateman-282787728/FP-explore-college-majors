8174423,3,B000N3SRZO,"HOW THE WEST WAS FUN consists of nine movies plus three chapters of a western-flavored TV sit-com. Cowboy stars here include Hoot Gibson, Walter Brennan, Guy Madison, Chill Wills, Forrest Tucker and Andy Devine.

NOTABLES--

THE BROTHERS O'TOOLE-- A solid cast fronted by TV's Gomez Addams (Astin). Hans Conried supplied many cartoon voices in the 1950's and '60s. Jesse White's last role was as the lonely Maytag repairman-- a part he played to perfection for many years.

MY OUTLAW BROTHER-- Mickey Rooney's comic turn as a young easterner travelling to Mexico in search of a brother who's involved with a gang of desperados. Good cast, silly premise.

PISTOLS 'N' PETTICOATS-- Twenty-six episodes of P & P aired at 8:30 pm over CBS-TV from 9/17/66 to 3/11/67. Series stars were Ann Sheridan, Carole Wells and Ruth McDevitt.

TEXAS, BROOKLYN AND HEAVEN-- Best film here has a great cast which includes WWII hero Audie Murphy (in a minor role), plus the folks who played the Wicked Witch of the West (""The Wizard of Oz""), Fred Mertz (""I Love Lucy""), Granny (""Beverly Hillbillies"") and that Maytag guy again!

THE WACKIEST WAGON TRAIN IN THE WEST-- Sherwood Schwartz, creator of ""I Dream of Jeannie"" and ""Gilligan's Island,"" tried to repeat his ""Gilligan"" success with this Bob Denver vehicle. The format of  ""Dusty's Trails"" blatantly mirrored Schwartz's ""seven stranded castaways"" concept, right down to the individual characters: the wagonmaster (Forrest Tucker) as ""The Skipper"" and Dusty (Denver) as his ""little buddy."" The lost wagon substitutes for the shipwrecked S.S. Minnow and there's even a brainy guy, a wealthy couple, a wholesome lass (Lori Saunders of ""Petticoat Junction""), and a dancehall gal (ala ""the movie star""). ""Dusty's Trails"" came to an end after one sorry season. This feature film was created from three of that sit-com's episodes.
