249291,4,6300216284,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, not only because of the intense portrayal by Peter O'Toole as Murphy, but also because of the interesting story line. If one has to make an example of single minded pursuit of an objective, this movie is one of the best. It is an uncluttered adventure in revenge for a British seaman, one of two survivors of a ship sent to the bottom by a German U-boat, who's crew was cold-bloodedly massacred while in the water. Good aerial photography, coupled with a good supporting cast and one period song. Near the end of the movie, the philosophical and moral questions thrown by an exasperated Louis (played by Phillipe Noiret) to an unlistening Murphy says more about why it was entitled ""Murphy's War.""",1004054400,6,730,4.755905511811024

Peter O' toole is (was) a great actor (playing the English survivor).  I also liked the fact that the Germans spoke German, not English.  The biggest problem with the movie was the thick British accents which at times made it very difficult to understand the dialogue.  It might have been helpful as well to somehow weave in an explanation (a little of the history) as to why the Brits and the Germans were in South America during WWII.",1472342400,,576,4.653465346534653

249662,5,6300216284,Peter O'Toole is wonderful as a stranded British Airman that sets out to take vengeance against the crew of a German submarine that had sunk his ship and machine gunned the survivors in the water.  It takes place near the Atlantic coast of South America.  An unexpected ending.,1425600000,2,277,4.75
249663,5,6300216284,"A fine performance by Peter O'Toole who plays the sole survivor of a merchant ship destroyed by a Nazi U-boat in a remote part of Venezuela. He is treated for his wounds in a missionary settlement on the Orinoco by Dr. Hayden, a woman physician who is Quaker. Her pacifist views differ vastly from Murphy's determination to seek revenge on the Nazi U-boat for the sake of his lost crew. When he persists in this goal even after word has reached the mission of Germany's surrender, he and the doctor butt heads, but Murphy, who is neither the type to take his medicine (literally, he spits out the pills Dr. Hayden gives him when she is not looking) or listen to what anyone else in the whole wide world has to say, doggedly forges ahead. She is played by O'Toole's first and only wife, the Welsh actress Sin Phillips, with whom he was married for twenty years. Philippe Noiret makes a unique contribution to the film in his cameo as a gentle Frenchman, Louis, who has lived in the area for many years, resigned to his uneventful and non-heroic life among the natives. Murphy embodies his antithesis. In the end, Louis' skills as a mechanic, as well as his boat, which Murphy appropriates, prove to be essential to Murphy's attempt to engineer the destruction of the Nazi submarine. Although O'Toole was born in Leeds, he considered himself 100% Irish. His Irish dialect in this film is sketchy to say the least but in no way interferes with a fine performance filled with humor and grit. He captures the stubbornness and tenacity of an Irish martyr--Murphy indeed goes ""down with the ship,"" but does so wearing a smile on his face.",1425081600,2,1631,4.627586206896551

249747,5,6300216284,"Peter O' Toole shines through this excellent flick that has a bit of everything in it: action, excellent flying scenes, personalities, history, etc.,etc.  I've watched it at least five times since it came out. I found it at Amazon an decided to invite my 21 year old nephew to watch it with me.  He, too, enjoyed it although the conclusions he drew from it were different than mine: two different generations perspectives on the same subject. It was interesting to discuss the theme of the movie with him; me coming off as an early baby boomer and he just beginning his adult life.  But, in the end, he agreed that my perspective had more weight than he had given it.

We've all seen pretty much all the WWII war movies out there. This one is a personal story and I can 100% guarantee that you'll be entertained for the full running time.  No bad language, no gore or guts.  Just a great story, extremely well acted and directed.",1404000000,2,929,4.5

This great revenge movie (OK, sort of like The African Queen) is one of them, with Peter O'Toole battling an icy young sub captain. Great production design - the seaplane segments are really compelling in their realism, unlike anything you will see with a plane like this.  The movie is over 40 years old, and has a great naivete to it, but it completely draws you in - especially if you like O'Toole. The ending is one of the best.

If you are a sub fan, the only drawback of the movie is the hopped-up boat they used - not a WWII version at all, inside or out, but some later style with a net-cutter added for effect. Not surprising - there weren't any original survivors to use - by the time of ""Raiders..."" and ""Das Boot"", the movie companies had to build their own mock-ups. The interesting broken camoflague of the boat is unusual, but not inconsistent with period photographs - I thought it was a good touch.

Fantastic flying scenes (specially the 1st take off from the river by O'Toole) with a beautifully restored Grumman J2F Duck amphibian. Excellent photography.

250004,5,6300216284,"As other reviewers have noted, this film is a forgotten gem.  It's long, so be prepared to settle in for the duration.  It is, as one person noted, a kind of WWII remake of ""Moby Dick,"" but it's also a meditation on fanaticism (like Moby Dick); the irony here is that the German U-boat commander, who (spoiler alert!) machine-guns helpless seamen in the water and murders Murphy's (O'Toole's) pilot, is not a fanatic; he is just a technocrat doing his job, a cog in a big war machine; he has to kill everyone so his U-boat won't be discovered.  His face shows his anguish when he shoots the pilot, and he tries to apologize; he's a ""normal"" man working in a lunatic war machine.  Murphy, on the other hand, is a man who believes in nothing but himself, a kind of modern Everyman who becomes a fanatic through his desire for revenge.  There's a lot of fuel for thought here; the Nazi is really kind of a  normal man loyal to a perverse, fanatically sick political system, while Murphy, ostensibly ""normal,"" really becomes functionally insane by the end of the film. The scene (spoiler alert!) where Phillippe Noiret walks away from him near the end of the film is telling.

The setting, somewhere on, I believe, the Orinoco or Amazon River, is interesting, and the contrasts between Murphy, the Nazi skipper, the pacifist doctor working at a Christian mission in the jungle, and the Noiret characters are engaging.  I liked the fact that there was no attempt to create a love story between Murphy and the doctor.  There is also a great scene where Murphy teaches himself to fly a reconnaissance float plane.

An interesting, different film.",1247184000,3,1639,4.679442508710801

250007,3,6300216284,"MURPHY'S WAR is an amusing World War II story in that it takes place far from Europe, the North Atlantic, or other venues where we are used to seeing the Allies battle the Germans.  In this film we find a German U-Boat hunting targets off the coast and along the inlets of tropical Venezuela.  The war in Europe is mere days from ending, yet the U-Boat commander shows no hint of reigning back his attacks.  Against this submarine threat is one man, Murphy, with a thirst for revenge.

Peter O'Toole stars as the sole surviving crewman of a torpedoed merchant ship.  After sinking the ship the U-Boat Kapitanleutnant orders the machine gunning of the survivors in an attempt to keep his submarine's location a secret.  Murphy survives the massacre and makes it to shore where he is nursed back to health by a missionary.  Already seeking revenge against the Germans for the demise of his crewmates, Murphy declares his own private war against the Kriegsmarine when an armed U-Boat shore party kills another surviving, though still seriously injured, pilot from the sunken ship.

The remainder of the film becomes a cat-and-mouse game between Murphy and the U-Boat.  Murphy becomes so obsessed with the U-Boat that he eventually succeeds in destroying the submarine at the sacrifice of his own life.

The premise of the movie is actually based on real events.  In 1944 U-Boat U-852 torpedoed a Greek steamer in the Indian Ocean.  The U-Boat commander ordered the machine gunning of the survivors in an attempt to prevent anyone from disclosing the presence of a U-Boat in the Indian Ocean. However, there are often survivors from all massacres and one rescued individual had quite a tale to tell.  The German submarine was subsequently attacked and forced to beach near Somalia where the crew was taken prisoner.  The U-Boat commander was later tried for war crimes and hanged.

As such, the first few minutes of MURPHY'S WAR are believable.  From that point the film moves into pure fiction.  The problem is that the Germans scour the local fishing village for survivors of the sinking eventually executing one injured pilot. For some reason U-Boat men ignore that fact that if there was one survivor in the village the U-Boat, merchant sinking, and massacre story were probably already well known throughout the village.

We are presented with a lone village on the coast of (or somewhere near) Venezuela made even more isolated by the German destruction of the sole radio transmitter.  For all intent and purpose the missionary, oil company caretaker, and the villagers are in virtual isolation until the end of the war.  Do not bother torturing yourself with rhetorical questions as to why nobody set off through the jungle or along the coast for help.  In order to accept the story you have to buy into a scenario where this tropical speck of the world is all that exists.

The film does not immediately give us a time frame for the story.  It is not until the latter part of the film that it is disclosed that the war is nearing, and then arrives at, its end.

No matter what film I see him in, Peter O'Toole will always be T.E. Lawrence from LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.  In many of his films he tends to play flighty-eccentric characters and MURPHY'S WAR is no exception.  Murphy's final charge with the rusty barge against the heavily armed U-Boat reminded me his similar ""No Prisoners"" attack against the Turks in LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.

This is another of those films that you have to enjoy from beginning to end without interruption.  The aerial U-Boat hunting scene, with Murphy as the self-taught pilot, is classic.",1187049600,2,3616,4.816855753646678

Peter O'Toole plays Murphy, the last survivor of a Merchant vessel sunken by a German sub, and he's obsessed with revenge. That the war ends mere days after his rescue does nothing to deter him; he will even the score or die trying. Though no classic, the film's moral complexities and simple central conflict, combined with O'Toole's convincing portrayal of a man lost in the tunnel of his own mad vision, make it a rewarding experience.

But really, Murphy got a raw deal because those Nazi's deserved to die after all the atrocities they had done. Ok Ok they were following orders just kill the Captain I guess. Great moments of Murphy flying a seaplane and not knowing how to fly, the dropping the bombs dead on with wick fuses is really far fetched but for some reason I totally was into it and never questioned that till now. The only other thing I did notice right off was the modern sub used but thats totally understandable and its a pretty boat too. I know, I know,  war is a  bad thing, and I guess a heroic Murphy ending is very boreing so that wouldn't work. However don't forget England had Chamberlain who was the worlds darling for saving the world in 1939 or so and look what happened. Highly Recommended",1129852800,7,1027,4.34375
250065,3,6300216284,"Peter O'Toole plays Murphy, one of the sole survivors of merchantman destroyed by U-Boat late in WWII.  In a swampy and remote chunk of South America, Murphy finds asylum among a group of missionaries.  The U-Boat however, won't leave him alone.  Having little more than a barge, a seaplane and his hatred for the U-Boat and its crew, O'Toole presses on a private war that looks to outlast WWII.  As those around Murphy begin to realize how his war has turned into an obsession, we in the audience begin to realize that we're watching an updated version of ""Moby Dick"", with some diferences that don't amount to an improvement.  For one thing, the U-Boat isn't content to be the hunted one - it returns to exact a revenge when one of Murphy's ideas doesn't pan out.  Also, when we get a look at the guys driving the U-Boat, we're in for a nasty shock of our own - they look less like steeled seawolves in search of a target than some obnoxious brats who need a bad shave, but otherwise could care less about Murphy once it looks like the war's over.  (At least in ""Moby Dick"" and ""Wrath of Khan"", there was the implication that the obsession was mutual.)  O'Toole acts with the same sort of epic sweep of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" - which seems ironic given the movie's ""private"" setting and less than epic scope.

That said, it's still a watchable movie - one of those that's most memorable for its final scene.  Like ""Wicker Man"", the parting shot is one that connotes fury, futility and most of all, finality.",1123545600,12,1507,4.507352941176471
250066,4,6300216284,"A merchant seaman seeks to destroy a German submarine crew in South America to avenge the slaughter of his shipmates.  Peter O'Toole is Seaman-machinist Murphy, a sardonic Irishman who miraculously survives a massacre by German submariners who unmercifully gun down his shipmates in the water after torpedoing their ship.  Murphy is rescued by a Quaker medical mission on the shores of a coastal river used by the Germans to hide their boat.  Local Indians later rescue the merchant ship's pilot who discloses that his seaplane is recoverable.  The Germans discover there is a survivor at the mission and the submarine commander executes the pilot while Murphy is retrieving the plane.  Murphy resolves to wage war single-handedly against the Germans.

Murphy's War is a very unique World War II story about an unlikely warrior who takes on overwhelming odds, and controversial when Germany is close to surrendering and ending the war in the Europe.  The movie features some exciting flying scenes as Murphy learns to operate the airplane, as well as some surprising changes when he and the Germans fight to the bitter end.
