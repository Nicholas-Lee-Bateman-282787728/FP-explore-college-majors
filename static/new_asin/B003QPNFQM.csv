8402430,5,B003QPNFQM,"Volpone is either a wealthy man gone broke, or one who merely wants to be wealthier. He pretends to be on his deathbed, while tantalizing four people by claiming that he is just about to will them all his property. These fiercely competing ""heirs"" bring Volpone jewels, silver, and other valuable gifts, and eventually show themselves willing to trade anything for money. One man offers to disinherit his own son; another offers Volpone his beautiful young wife, of whom he is otherwise obsessively jealous. Volpone's clever servant Mosca invents many of the schemes, and pretends to serve everyone while being faithful only to himself. Volpone and Mosca want to make public fools out of the ""heirs"" in addition to collecting their gifts and tips. This eventually proves to be their undoing, enabling Ben Johnson to hang a quick moral onto the end of what is otherwise a thoroughly cynical, satirical, and sometimes scabrous play.

The language is Shakespearean blank verse, but wittier. The plot has the common, rather unimportant byplays of the period, showing that, even though this performance runs over 2 1/2 hours, the period audience was eager to be entertained rather than rushing toward the plot's resolution. There is a series of interludes where Volpone's three jesters put on crude comic acts, and another series where two Englishmen hint at mysterious plots and subplots in what seems to be a takeoff on the Elizabethan spy state.  (See the book The Reckoning: The Murder of Christopher Marlowe.)

The acting in this production is very good, by and large Shakespearean. Mark Hadfield is positively brilliant playing Mosca, exuding cynical weariness while pouring forth a stream of creative reassurances, promises, assertions, glossings-over, and bald lies. In one scene, while pretending remorse for his misdeeds, when his credulous listener turns away briefly Mosca checks the time by his watch before resuming his sobs.

The scenery is bare-bones, consisting mostly of a black-and-white tiled floor, a revolving center podium, and a couple of pieces of furniture. The costumes are more or less Edwardian inspired, combined with obvious thrift-shop finds and corporate donations. (Volpone's ""furs"" consist of a ratty 1950s mink stole.) I would have preferred period costumes, but I suppose they would have been too expensive. I do think the production went too far in modernity by having the jesters strike Broadway musical poses while one jester plays the ukulele--especially since he doesn't play it well.",1285372800,,2521,5.248138957816377
