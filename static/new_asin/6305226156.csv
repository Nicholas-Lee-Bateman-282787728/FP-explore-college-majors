990468,3,6305226156,"This was downbeat prison movie based on the ""Battle Of Alcatraz"" prison riot a year earlier shocked people with its violence.  The film follows a group of convicts who rebel under the control of the cruel assistant warden Hume Cronyn (who later was considered a early pick over Lancaster in The Sweet Smell Of Success before Burt got the role) and launch a violent escape attempt.  The leader of the group, Burt Lancaster, was to have originally been Wayne Morris, but Morris could not get free of commitments and the producer reverted to Burt who he had used in Lancaster's first film ""The Killers"".  Lancaster turns in a powerful role as Joe Collins, a hard boiled career criminal determined to escape to convince the ""nice"" girl that he loves to have a operation that will get her out of her wheelchair.  The kind side of all the cons are showed in flashbacks.  Howard Duff made his first film appearance as Soldier and Charles Bickford turns in his usual solid performance.  Well acted, violent for the times, the films deals with depressing prison life and maybe too dark for some.  It is a film that will be enjoyed by those that particularly enjoy strong individual performances.

Look closely and you'll also find Ray Teal (later the long-time sheriff on ""Bonanza""),Charles McGraw (another noir staple and the gladiator trainer in ""Spartacus""), and Glenn Strange (best remembered as ""Sam"" the bartender in ""Gunsmoke"").  There's even a little ""Whit"" included in the early scenes.  Dark, but entertaining with crisp acting and a sense of tension throughout.

990648,2,6305226156,"Prison break films are a staple of Hollywood and even TV nowadays. They go back to the earliest years of the talkie period. ""The Big House"" (1930) was the first film to gain wide critical and popular acclaim. Films like Hell's House"" (1932), Hell's Highway"" (1932), ""20,000 Years in Sing Sing"" (1932) and ""The Mayor from Hell"" (1933) followed, as well as the chain gang films, the most famous of which was ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" (1932) and later ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967).

In addition to the standard prison film and chain gang films, there are a number of other sub genres like ""women in prison films"" - ""Caged"" (1950), ""Women in Cages"" (1973) - and ""escape from POW camps"" - ""The Great Escape"" (1963), ""The Colditz Story"" (1955) - films.

Here in 1947 we have a run of the mill escape from prison story, notable only for the quality of the cast that includes Burt Lancaster, Charles Bickford, Sam Levene, Jeff Corey and Howard Duff among the prisoners and Hume Cronyn and Jay C Flippen among the guards. The film was said to be inspired by a 1946 attempted escape from Alcatraz, but in fact the plot points are so ordinary that no explanatory is necessary.

Burt Lancaster (1913-94) plays the tough guy and the ring leader of the escape. Lancaster was noted for his athleticism (""Flame and the Arrow"", ""Jim Thorpe"", ""Crimson Pirate"", ""Trapeze"" ), his intensity (""Come Back Little Sheba"", ""From Here to Eternity"", ""The Rose Tattoo"", ""Elmer Gantry""), and his marvelous westerns (""Gunfight at OK Corral"", ""Vera Cruz"", ""The Professionals"" , ""Valdez is Coming""), but it's his character studies in this film, ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" (1962), and ""Atlantic City"" (1980) where we really see his true power as an actor. This was his second film, coming off a tremendous debut in ""The Killers"" (1946) at the age of 32.

Lancaster was nominated for an Oscar in 1953 for ""From Here to Eternity"" (1953) and would be nominated 3 more times and win for ""Elmer Gantry"" (1960). He was nominated for a Golden Globe 5 times, starting in 1956 (""The Rainmaker"") and including ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" (1962) and ""Atlantic City"" (1980). He appears as #19 on the AFI list of Top 50 Screen Legends.

Hume Cronyn (1911-2003) plays a power hungry Captain. He had 7 Emmy nominations and 3 wins (""To Dance with the White Dog"", ""Broadway Bound"", ""Age Old Friends"") but it probably best known for ""Cocoon"" (1985). Most of his roles were as ""good guys"" so it's interesting to see him play the bad guy. Unfortunately he is not all that convincing.

Crusty Charles Bickford plays the con in charge. Bickford appeared in nearly 100 films. He was nominated for an Oscar three times (""Song of Bernadette"" in 1943, ""The Farmer's Daughter"" in 1947, and ""Johnny Belinda"" in 1949), and each time, the actress who played opposite him won the Oscar for Best Actress - Jennifer Jones, Loretta Young, and Jane Wyman.

Fellow inmates Sam Levene and Jeff Corey appeared in ""The Killers"" with Lancaster. Both men were a staple in film noir and gangster films. Levene appeared in ""Crossfire"", several ""Thin Man"" films, and ""Slaughter on 10th Avenue"". Jeff Corey appeared in more than 100 films (""Butch Cassidy"", ""In Cold Blood"") and best remembered for his role as Wild Bill Hickock in ""Little Big Man"" He was blacklisted in the 50s and became an acting coach to such notables as James Dean, Robert Blake, Leonard Nimoy, and Jack Nicholson.

Jay C Flippen (1899-1971) plays a guard. He appeared in more than 50 films between 1929 and 1971. He was often paired with Jimmy Stewart (""Winchester 73"", ""The Far Country"", ""Strategic Command"", ""Firecreek"") and .John Wayne (""Jet Pilot"", ""Flying Leathernecks"", ""Hellfighters"").  In the 50s he transitioned to TV where he was a regular on series like ""Ensign O'Toole"" (1962-3) and ""The Virginian"" (1966-9).

This was the film debut of Howard Duff (1913-90) who is probably most famous for his TV series with wife Ida Lupino, ""Mr. Adams and Eve"" (1957-8). In the film credits he is identified as the ""Voice of Sam Spade"" which he was at the time for NBC Radio.

Jules Dassin (1911-2008) directs. Dassin did a number of film noir movies (""The Naked City"", ""Thieves Highway"", ""Night and the City"") before getting in trouble during the HUAC witchhunt and left for Europe where he made ""Rififi"" (1955), one of the earliest heist movies. In 1961 he was nominated for an Oscar as director and writer for ""Never on Sunday"".

FWIW - Jules Dassin, Hume Cronyn, Jeff Corey, Roman Bohnen (played the warden), and Art Smith (played Dr. Walters)  all were blacklisted.

William Daniels (1901-70) is the cinematographer. Garbo insisted he shoot all her films, which he did, except for 2 (""Conquest"", ""Two-faced Woman"") which turned out to be flops at the box office. When not working with Garbo, Daniels was a favorite of Erich von Stroheim, who was Garbo's favorite director (even though she made 6 films with Clarence Brown). Daniels lensed more than 150 films. He was nominated 3 times (""Anna Christie"", ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", ""How the West was Won"") and won once (""Naked City"" in 1948). Unfortunately this is one of his poorest efforts.

Miklos Rozsa (1907-95) scored more than 100 films and earned 16 Oscar nominations and 3 wins (""A Double Life"", ""Spellbound"", ""Ben Hur""). A talented composer, his work in this film is so melodramatic it borders on the comical.

1947 wasn't the best year for films. The Oscar winners were ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and ""Gentlemen's Agreement"" and the box office leaders included ""Unconquered"", ""The Bachelor and the Bobby Soxer"", ""Mother Wore Tights"" and ""Life with Father."" Other notable films that year were ""Dark Passage"" (Bogart), ""The Lady From Shanghai"" (Orson Welles), and ""Possessed"" (Joan Crawford).

The NY Times' Bosley Crowther criticized the characterizations, saying ""the foremost prisoners in this latest Mark Hellinger film seem to be rather all-around good fellows who deserve our most generous regard"" and ""On the other hand, the warden of the prison is an obvious ineffectual, the doctor is a philosophical drunkard and the captain of the guards is a rogue.""
There are lots of problems with this film, apart from the poor production values.

It's called ""Brute Force"" but there is really very little force, much less brute force. True, one inmate is forced to stumble into a stamping machine and another is tied to a chain and beaten with a rubber hose. But that's it folks! And there is almost no internal violence, nor any sense that this isn't a safe place to be, apart from the Captain and his one violent aide.

Moreover, the idea of showing back stories is intrusive helping to slow down the pace of the film, which isn't all that great in the first place.

This film is a big disappointment, considering how talented the actors are and considering that this was 1947. If you're looking for good prison escape films, here are my favorites - ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" (1932),  ""Each Dawn I Die"" (1939), ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967), ""Papillion"" (1973), ""Midnight Express"" (1978), ""Escape from New York"" (1981),  ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994), and ""The Escapist"" (2008)",1311465600,3,7128,4.854200988467875
990649,3,6305226156,"From the violent film noir classics.  Tale focuses on convicts pushed to the edge by a militant captain prison guard who later becomes its warden.  It's melodramatic at times but it's worth a look for noir fans or anyone who wants to see Lancaster and/or Cronyn in action.  Hume Cronyn, by the way, steals some of the scenes (as the captain) from Lancaster (one of the convict leaders who has a wife with cancer).  Themes are a bit too preachy, especially at the end, which is a no no these days but back then it was considered okay.

990651,5,6305226156,"""Brute Force"" is still one of the most powerful prison movies ever made.  Despite the many years that have passed since its initial release on June 30, 1947, this tense, searing drama about a volatile mix of tensions building up in a maximum security penitentiary to the point of explosion, is still one of the key films in the genre.  Credit is due to the powerhouse performances of a remarkable cast, incredibly taut direction by Jules Dassin, and outstanding production values highlighted by Miklos Rozsa's masterful score and William Daniel's moody cinematography.

By the time he filmed ""Brute Force"", Burt Lancaster already had three movies in the can; however, this was only the second of his films to be released to theatres.  His performance as Joe Collins, the hardened leader of the prison gang, is amazing, and contributed heavily to his rocket ride to stardom.  Even when he's not in the scene, Lancaster's powerful characterization dominates the proceedings.  Hume Cronyn as Munsey, a sadistic and manipulative weasel of a prison guard, provides the perfect foil for Lancaster.  The resolution of their conflict at the end of the film is well worth waiting for.

But in fact, almost every role in the film is perfectly cast and performed, from Roman Bohnen's ineffectual warden and Art Smith's alcoholic doctor to Charles Bickford's aging felon and Sam Levene's resolute non-informant.  The distaff members of the cast, playing the remembered sweethearts of the convicts in flashback sequences, appear only briefly, with Anita Colby and Ella Raines making particularly strong impressions.  Yvonne DeCarlo is ravishingly beautiful, although her Italian accent is none too convincing; only Ann Blyth truly disappoints as Lancaster's crippled girlfriend, but on the other hand, her saccharine role would have been nigh impossible for any actress to carry off.

Criterion's restoration and transfer of this cinematic gem deserves the highest praise.  I've seen this film previously on television and at a revival house, and it never looked even half this good.  The contrast is perfectly balanced, there are only a couple of barely noticeable jumps in the print, and the soundtrack is crisp and clear.  The DVD has a wealth of extras, including the original theatrical trailer, a pungent commentary by Alain Silver and James Orsini, some special short features and a neat little booklet containing essays and articles on the film and its makers.

""Brute Force"" is a film that is most deserving of the Criterion treatment, and the company has provided viewers with a package that is bound to please the most discriminating consumer.  Most highly recommended!",1288310400,,2667,5.210772833723653

990739,4,6305226156,"Long before *The Green Mile* and *Prison Break*, the French director Jules Dassin made *Brute Force*, a melodrama about men's lives in a prison system intent less on social rehabilitation and more on draconian punishment. The film's liberal-humanist approval of rehabilitation is movingly captured by the inmates' flashbacks to their lives before prison: men struggling to do good for their girlfriends, wives, and families. These men are pit against Hume Cronyn's unforgettable Captain Munsey, a power-hungry social Darwinist and Westgate Penitentiary's shrewd enforcer of the institutional code. In the conflict between the inmates and Munsey, Dassin crafts an affecting narrative about heroism, survival, and postwar American masculinity.

The Criterion transfer is crisp and clear. William Daniels's black-and-white cinematography is particularly resonant in the shadowy nighttime scenes that take place behind the prison's walls. This edition of the movie also features a few illuminating extras, including commentary by noir specialists Alain Silver and James Ursini as well as an interview with Paul Mason on *Brute Force*'s importance in the history of film representations of prison life.

While parts of the movie can be melodramatically overwrought (e.g., during the flashback sequences), *Brute Force* is a landmark of film noir and prison cinema, and is well worth watching in this powerful Criterion edition.",1230768000,2,1422,5.766666666666667
990740,5,6305226156,"Made just prior to ""Naked City,"" Dassin's gritty prison melodrama puts a twist on the archetypal bust-out scheme by revisiting, in flashback, the pre-penitentiary lives of Collins--ably played by an intense young Lancaster--and his crew, colorfully brought to life by character actors Whit Bissell, Howard Duff, and John Hoyt. In a fine performance, Charles Bickford appears as the prison's gruff de facto leader and newspaper editor who throws in his lot with Collins. The other ace in Dassin's deck is Cronyn, playing a corrupt, savage prison guard bent on bringing ""discipline"" to his inmates, while nursing a megalomaniacal ambition to replace the wimpy Warden. Aside from the ominous noir visuals, Dassin explores issues endemic to prison life and wraps them up in an ugly finale meant to evoke a Nazi bloodbath.",1182384000,2,817,5.244274809160306

This is not an easy DVD to get,so I wish someone maybe Universal,the original releasing company,would come out with a full-length commetary,with a special emphasis ,on the political repercussions that were felt by many members of the cast and crew of this and other left-leaning films.

990743,5,6305226156,"""Brute Force"" is one of the most violent film noirs of the classic era, as well as one of the most pessimistic -and this is after some violence was removed to comply with the Production Code. The story takes place within the confines of Westgate Penitentiary, an overcrowded prison whose deficient living conditions and sadistic guards make the inmates' lives nearly unbearable. Prison life is no less than a war between the inmates and guard Captain Munsey (Hume Cronyn), who routinely uses blackmail and torture to control the prisoners. When the warden revokes all the inmates' privileges in response to the deaths of two men, inmate Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster) hatches a violent and risky escape plan with his cellmates and a senior, well-respected prisoner named Gallagher (Charles Bickford).

Director Jules Dessin doesn't let a glimmer of hope into this film. The violence is brutal and wholly without sentiment or regret. The utter hopelessness of the situation in the prison is overwhelming. Brute force is the only means in Westgate Penitentiary. The standout performance is by Hume Cronyn as the Nazi-inspired Captain Munsey, an unabashed sadist who uses social Darwinism to rationalize absolute dominance of the prisoners, who are, after all, behind bars, not free to challenge him. The prison doctor, a disgraced surgeon named Walters (Art Smith), numbs himself with alcohol and articulates the film's themes. ""Do you know what this prison is?"" he says. ""One big human bomb!""

The film is a little too long, and the flashback scenes of wives and girlfriends are superfluous. This is perhaps the most blatantly existential film noir. It takes the position of Sartrean philosophy, articulated by Dr. Walters, which is juxtaposed with Nietzschean philosophy, articulated by Capt. Munsey. I'm not normally captivated by either of these schools of thought, but ""Brute Force"" kept me interested for the duration of the film. It is a brutal, beautiful film with sharp dialogue, solid character writing, and great attention to detail.

990744,2,6305226156,"""Nothing's okay,"" Westgate Penitentiary inmate Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster) says, ""I gotta get out.""  That's because the sadistic screws are keeping the otherwise tractable inmates down with BRUTE FORCE.  You treat a man like an animal and he turns into one, right?

  At least so sayeth the usually reliable director Jules Dassin in this overripe movie about a prison on the edge of explosion.  You see, the bad guys - the inmates - have a backstory, told in a series of flashbacks, that proves they're good guys under the prison grays.  They just got hooked up with bad women who made them do bad things.  Flashbacks don't lie.  They don't necessarily entertain, or keep a movie chugging onward at a comfortable clip, but they don't lie.  The prison officials, on the other hand... the otherwise decent warden is weak and vacillating.  The avuncular doctor drowns his reprehension in brandy, emerging from his alcoholic stupor  periodically to crack wry about the inhumanity of it all.

  The baddest good guy is Capt. Munsey (`Sir' to you), Hume Cronyn, an effete sociopath with a blood taste for dishing it out (he seems particularly fond of whips) and a penchant for the insinuating seduction.

  I wanted to like it, but as BRUTE FORCE plodded forward, piling melodramatic excess on melodramatic excess, I found myself fighting it.  Fighting the notion that everyone in effective authority was a heartless goon, the ineffective ones were broken (presumably by the ruthless System), and the inmates were misunderstood choirboys.  Despite its good looks, good performances and exciting final scene I had too many ""Aw, c'mon"" moments to honestly say I liked this movie.

  The transfer print is in good condition, and the disk includes a hands-free Stills Pressbook Gallery with a number of behind-the-scene photographs, publicity stills, lobby cards and posters.",1115683200,17,1866,5.105960264900662
990745,5,6305226156,"Burt Lancaster stars in this tough, grim noir-drenched prison flick, in which a sadistic prison guard (a young Hume Cronyn) manipulates tensions and weaknesses to produce an explosive situation.  The film's liberal message butts up against its obligatory ""crime never pays"" ending; the convicts are sympathetic, but doomed from the word ""go.""  A little stagey and lurid, but overall tense and suspenseful -- the ending is a real nail-biter.  Recommended.",1039564800,3,454,5.457142857142857
990746,5,6305226156,"There's a feverish undercurrent to this prison film that occasionally erupts into outright delirium ( the prison break, the interrogation scene). As delivered by blacklisted director Jules Dassin and screenwriter Richard Brooks, the film's anti-fascist message is put in your face, not in your lap. Still it's exciting stuff, except for the draggy domestic scenes that are meant to humanize the cons, but instead disrupt the film's relentless pace and super-charged atmosphere. Burt Lancaster gives a career performance, while Hume Cronyn is surprisingly effective as the sly Nazi-like warden. There are many familiar faces in the supporting cast, especially Art Smith as the humane but feckless doctor and Sir Lancelot as his calypso assistant. I suspect there's a provocative parable lurking somewhere in the subtext, something about the inability of liberals (the old warden and the doc) to contain the brute force it takes to keep people in prison. This is revealed at film's end when the camera dollys back to reveal the doc behind office bars and speaking toward the camera. Then we know the movie is about more than a bunch of desperate convicts trying to break through prison walls. Despite its many flaws, this stark melodrama keeps coming at you with the mesmerizing force of an uplifted hammer and should not be missed.",994896000,4,1330,5.162037037037037
990747,4,6305226156,"Brute Force is a surprisingly tough look at life in a prison, given the time when it was made.  Burt Lancaster stars as an inmate who plans his escape to be with his critically ill girlfriend, Ann Blyth.  He enlists the  help of his cellmates and an older, experienced inmate, Charles Bickford.  Standing in their way is a brutal, ambitious guard played very well by Hume  Cronyn.  There are a number of great scenes in the movie, including  Cronyn's beating of an inmate to the sound of classical music, and the  death in a giant press of an inmate that informed.  The performances are  good, the film moves at an excellent pace, and the ending surprised me  somewhat, again given the time that it was made.  Brute Force is a very  good movie.",949276800,,744,4.503759398496241

7885344,3,6305226156,"""Brute Force"" is called the ""archetypal prison break movie"", but, only two years removed from World War II, it sometimes plays like a war movie.

The prisoners, like soldiers on the war front, have only posters to remind them of their wives and girlfriends.  Through ""dream reverie"" segments, women briefly appear in the movie --- but other than Anita Colby's turn as ""Flossie"" (a classic femme fatale),  none of the performances are memorable.  Yvonne De Carlo is negligible in her brief appearance as an Italian love interest.  These backstories are meant to provide information about how the men wound up in prison and add human interest, but they don't contribute much, and became a source of acrimonious debate between the director and producer.

Hume Cronyn delivers the key performance in the movie (outclassing the matinee draw, Burt Lancaster) as a sadistic prison guard who has ambitions of supplanting the weak prison warden.  Cronyn gives a shaded performance of a character who essentially is a closet Nazi.  To emphasize that point, he is shown playing a Richard Wagner record while he tortures a prisoner, trying to gain information.  Cronyn's physical resemblance to Richard Nixon is rather striking, and you might also wonder if his performance had an impact on the portrayal of the prison guard ""Percy"" in  Stephen King's ""Green Mile"".

The actual prison break is very like a war movie sequence, and it is visually quite exciting.  Prison guards man a turret style machine gun as if they are protecting a beach head.

Richard Brooks scripted the movie, but you could believe it was Bud Schulberg.  There is a political edge and some philosophizing that is sometimes effective, and sometimes hackneyed.  As the film ends, the message becomes that people are universally ""prisoners"" in an age old struggle.

One interesting piece of trivia is that the movie marked the first film appearance of Sir Lancelot, as ""Calypso"".  Sir Lancelot was the singer who caused Harry Belafonte to record calypso music.  His character is also a bit incongruous to the movie, but his rhyming comments on prisoners are entertaining.",1492992000,,2129,5.068965517241379
