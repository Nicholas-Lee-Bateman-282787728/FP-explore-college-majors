2934325,5,B000VAHQW4,"I love a good work of fiction but sometimes reality can be very entertaining. This series is well-made and so intense and passionate that it brought me to tears more than one time. Every episode is a unique road to the superbowl by the team who won it and told by 3 important actors of the team. The 1985 conquest of the Bears for example is told by Mike Ditka, Mike Singletary and Jim McMahon. The stories that leads to the big game are fascinating, touching and often surprising. I love the series so much that I was comtemplating buying the first DVDs on the market which focus on one particular team and all the superbowls they won. But now, I was happy to see that they compile everything in one package. The packaging is very well made, the 40 DVDs being separated in 4 eras (66-75)(76-85)(86-95)and (96-05), 10 discs by DVD. Also, an interesting 88 page book with every conquest by every team. On the DVDs you have also a bunch of interviews that we couldn't see on the NFL network. If you love the NFL this is a great work by NFL films and Steve Sabol and a great piece of history to possess. The only thing missing is the Colts Superbowl last year but the documentary is about the first 40 Superbowl so we can't have everything unfortunately.",1195603200,24,1251,4.41991341991342
2934326,4,B000VAHQW4,"This is among the best work NFL Films has ever done, but the set is one program short.  I recently saw the America's Game segment for the 2006 Colts and there's no reason why it shouldn't be included in this set.",1191542400,5,212,4.170731707317073
2934347,5,B000VAHQW4,"Any football lover should have this in their collection. The story of each of the first 40 Superbowls is recounted on it's own beautifully packaged DVD and put into the context of the world political situation at the time, the previous history of the winning team, the personalities that dominated the game, the season leading up to the game and the Superbowl itself. Each show has been meticulously put together and many of the DVDs are inspirational in showing how teams have overcome adversity in achieving the World Championship. I'd especially call out the 1970 Colts, the 1985 Bears, the 1986 Giants and individual stories like the Steelers Rocky Bleier who left the Steelers and went to Vietnam where he was injured and told he'd ""never play football again"" and subsequently won 4 Superbowls with them. I watch one of these every week to keep me going throughout the off-season.",1314144000,,885,4.906666666666666
2934348,4,B000VAHQW4,"Hiya, I bought this box set for my cousin who is heavily involved in Gridiron in Australia.  It arrived quickly and was in great condition.  Thanks again for the speedy service.

2934349,5,B000VAHQW4,"I had been looking for this boxset in the UK for a while, but found it cheapest on Amazon.com even with extra Postage to the UK and import tax paid!!  For all NFL fans this boxset is a must.  The documentaries are even better without ad breaks but just long enough to drop 1 or 2 in every now and again for a little entertainment when you've got a little time.  Excellent.",1298505600,,372,4.138888888888889
2934350,5,B000VAHQW4,"The ""America's Game - SuperBowl I-XL"" boxed set is not only a ""must have"" for any fan of NFL football..but highly recommended for fans of sport in general.

The episodes are narrated by some of America's most well known and distinguished actors and feature commentary from some of the players and coaching staff (both past and present) who had made their mark during each Superbowl.

I had only seen a few episodes of America's Game prior to purchasing the boxed set, but was immediately impressed and taken aback by the slick presentation of each episode and the candidness of the coaches and former players featured.

Although the DVDs only run for around 60 minutes each, (this includes the main feature + some DVD extras), each episode is unique and dramatic in its own way. More importantly perhaps, each DVD isn't only just a highlights film from each Superbowl final, but looks at some of the stories,anecdotes,personalities,events and key football games of the day which helped to shape each team's season on their way to winning the ultimate prize in NFL Football.",1298332800,,1073,4.917127071823204
2934351,4,B000VAHQW4,"I bought the Superbowl Collector's Set and intended to return America's Game, not even cracked open but still factory sealed.  The reason was the reviews that I read which said the Collector's Set was action/highlights and America's Game was more interviews and extras with highlights tossed in here and there.  Well, thanks to a great wife and a gamble, I have both sets.  I don't spend money liberally so I had to think about this. I did not return America's Game; I opened it because the reviews that I read led me to believe that both were great for different reasons.  I can say this.  Having both sets is like two sides of one golden coin.  Both are beautiful in different ways.  Each has something the other lacks.  America's Game is full of highlights but uses them to illustrate the stories instead of using highlights to tell the stories.  And it is FULL of stories you probably never heard during the football seasons and Superbowls of their times!  These is a great set, just like the Collector's set.  Buy America's Game for the stories and extras; buy the Collector's set if you just want to watch season and Superbowl coverage highlights with that classic NFL narration and music.  One word of warning: like the Collector's Set, this set suffers from a quality control issue.  The packaging is done poorly.  There are scratched disks in both of these sets, some are pretty bad and I did not think they could possibly run.  They all do, at least all that I have looked at.  I don't know why this is, unless these are returned sets and they shouldn't be as both were factory sealed and I bought new sets.  Rough handling when being packed at the factory?  I was extremely careful with them as with all cd's and dvd's, since I HATE a skipping/damaged disk.  So far these are all OK and I'll keep them; I may get burned someday when I look at a disc and find one skips or whatever.  I'll take my chances since these are worth it and I don't have time to preview 60 dvd's.  But now I can watch them for a looonnnggggg time.",1270339200,9,2033,4.470108695652174
2934352,5,B000VAHQW4,Brilliant documentary series of the NFL Superbowls. As I haven't grown up with American Football it gives me a fascinating look at the behind the scenes action and also how some of the great players literally got a start in the game. It is also amazing how the players and coaches can be so easily heard during games and what types of things they say and concentrate on. First Class.,1268352000,2,383,4.485714285714286
2934353,5,B000VAHQW4,"I purchased this DVD set for around 80% less than the retail price and it was brand new, still in the packaging. This is a PERFECT gift for any football fan. I highly recommend it",1264896000,,179,4.142857142857143
2934354,5,B000VAHQW4,"Bought this here on Amazon.com - excellent product, excellent boxed gift set with informative book also included. Got mine for $39.99 ( includes shipping of only $2.98 ) !!!
Most places retail this for at least $199. + so to get it BRAND-NEW for $39.99 is a steal.
Love the narration, the storylines behind the actual game footage, the interview with the players.
Anyone who likes or loves NFL Football WILL LOVE THIS SET !!!
40 DVD  - that's right 40 DVD's !!!  Can't beat it !!!  Best thing I bought here on Amazon.com",1262649600,,520,4.51063829787234
2934355,5,B000VAHQW4,"If it's possible to wear out a DVD from overuse, then I'm sure putting this one to the test.  Fantastic production, awesome narration from a great lineup of actors, and NFL Films storytelling at it's absolute highest level.  I would have paid twice what I did for this set.  My only complaint is that the DVD's are in 4:3 aspect ratio instead of 16:9 like it was broadcast on NFL network, but otherwise very very well done!",1262131200,,423,4.467532467532467
2934356,5,B000VAHQW4,This DVD set is everything that I hoped it would be! It's a must buy for any hardcore football fan!,1261785600,,99,4.0
2934367,5,B000VAHQW4,"This is a DVD of a TV show that was broadcast on the NFL Network.

It contains some great regular season footage of the 1966 Green Bay Packers, in addition to segments on the NFL Championship Game and Super Bowl I.

I'm always interested in seeing what the NFL of that era looked like, so I'm definitely going to rewatch this DVD again.",1257724800,6,336,4.317460317460317
2934368,4,B000VAHQW4,"It's a little hard for me to review the actual dvd set b/c it is a gift for my boyfriend. However, it arrived quickly and in perfect condition. This boxset normally sells for close to $200.00. I'm in medical school and have to be careful how I spend my money. Thank you for making it possible to get this at such a great price!",1251417600,,327,4.125
2934369,5,B000VAHQW4,"I was very impressed upon viewing the 2001 Patriots Episode broadcast on NFL Network and just had to see if there was a compilation on DVD.  Sure enough there was this AMAZING 40 Disc set.  These are the most perfectly designed, well put together documentaries of the NFL and I firmly believe it always will be.  This set is packed with over 40 years of NFL history spanning from the mid 60's to early 00's.  This is a 40 disc set, with each episode plus extra interviews, stories, highlights, and history regarding the team for their respective year journeying to the Superbowl.  This is the ultimate quencher for any fan during the off-season.  In fact, no true fan would be without this compilation.  A terrific collector and an NFL masterpiece.",1248739200,,748,4.707692307692308
2934370,5,B000VAHQW4,"In 2005, the NFL Network decided to do a list of the 20 Greatest Super Bowl Champions ever.  Well, Instead of doing a simple set of documentaries, they decided to pull out all the stops.  The opening of every show is simply beautiful.  Highlighting that teams specific Super Bowl ring, and the music...oh the music, nothing short of stunning.
  Then, there are the celebrity narrators.  Men who were chosen not just because of their names, but there use of voice.  Tom Selleck, Gene Hackman, Bruce Willis, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland, Ed Harris, Martin Sheen, Lawrence Fishbourne, and my personal favorite, Alec Baldwin.
  The basic format of the show, is they select 3 men who were involved in the team.  Coaches, players, or even members of the staff.  And between the narrator, and the players they take you through the season were that peticular team won the Super Bowl.  They outline the trials, hurddles, and obsticles that team faced throughout the year.
  The major advantage with the series, was that it was produced by NFL Network, so they have unlimited access to footage.
  When you first open the packaging, you realize, that a lot of love went into this set.  The packaging is simply amazing.  All in one box, is located 4 seperate box sets, and there's also a booklet that is also a really cool quick refrence guide, and there's a bonus disk that features a program on NFL Network, were they explain how they did the voting of the list, and how the show came to be.
  I love seeing a box set that you can tell and lot of love and passion went into, instead of the typical cheap set you get.  NFL Network, thank you...this one was a deep pass for an 87 yard touchdown!!!",1248566400,3,1687,4.593959731543624

2934372,5,B000VAHQW4,I bought this as a gift for my husband who has been watching football since he was a kid.  He has loved every minute of the fantastic NFL Films dvds and tells everyone he knows about how great they are.  He can't say enough good things about how great the interviews and content are. Great gift for yourself or someone you love.,1231891200,,328,4.274193548387097
2934373,3,B000VAHQW4,My grandson is a real Football fan and plays the game too. I found this super bowl package for him for Christmas. He was so excited when he opened his gift. However when we watched one of the DVD's we were both dissapointed. I was thinking I was purchasing DVD'S of the actual Super Bowl games. After all that is what the title says.,1231804800,4,333,4.21875

2934375,5,B000VAHQW4,"This set IS football...period.  Most enjoyable are the interviews & commentary by ""obscure"" players from the Super Bowl teams.  Always helpful to hear from the guys who may not have been superstars in their heyday, nor even Hall of Famers now.  The extra features from each team's DVD are a real nice touch as well.

Just plain ""win"" with this collection.  No real football fan will be disappointed in the slightest.",1226448000,,416,4.802816901408451

2934397,5,B000VAHQW4,"The Ancient Greeks had Homer to immortalize their heroes. Modern America has Steve Sabol and NFL Films. NFL films has raised the bar on the Sport's Documentary, going beyond the boring re-telling of scores and highlights to tell the human side. Each DVD goes beyond the actual Super Bowl, providing the background for the key game. Critical factors and events of the year are chronicled.  The result is a story on par with the epic's of the ages.",1220140800,,446,4.717948717948718

2934399,4,B000VAHQW4,"I recently purchased NFL Americas Game Superbowl 1-XL by Americas Game for my husband who just loves NFL and Dallas? Anyway he thinks it is great but would love to see more interviews with past players not just the ""usual suspects"" as well as more of the behind the scenes footage that still sits in archives, including some of the funniest commercials shown during superbowls etc. Apart from that he is one very happy man and I hope that NFL brings out more of this type of box set which shows us the fans the history, sacrifices etc that these players have made to bring us this game, its great for everyone in the family.

2934400,5,B000VAHQW4,"I was waiting for this ever since they aired the America's Game series here in Germany on NASN prior to last years Super Bowl XLI. Unfortunately I bought the box a few weeks to early as the price meanwhile has dropped by 70 $. But hey, I really didn't care right after I watched the first two DVDs, my beloved 85 Bears (which made me a football fan) and the Top Twenty Countdown. I think this series is absolutely great und recommend it to every true fan of the game. Of course there will always be the problem, that once you buy such an compliation it'll be outdated next season. Same goes for any James Bond movie compilation. So maybe in forty years I'll have to buy Set II with Super Bowls 41 to 80, who knows. For now I'm just happy to own this great box.",1201737600,,760,4.1768707482993195

I have seen parts of this series and find it has enough human interest material to keep me entertained.  I had hoped it included all the games, in their entirety. but it doesn't.  It includes interviews, some game footage and documents controversy surrounding each game.",1200009600,3,532,4.29
2934403,4,B000VAHQW4,"This is more than a trip down memory lane with the NFL's best, as sweet as that may be. In separate vignettes for each season, the NFL has extracted poignant, powerful and funny interviews with current and former players and coaches. They bring each Super Bowl to life in a new, interesting, personal, and insightful way.

All our favorite teams are here - the 72-73 Dolphins, 85 Bears, 1971 Cowboys, Green Bay Packers, Steelers, Patriots, and everyone else. The NFL has created somethig special with this set.

The only thing that might make it a little better is an HD format. Nonetheless, the quality and production is first class.",1199750400,,634,4.807339449541284
2934404,4,B000VAHQW4,"This is such a fun series. You follow the winning team from the regular season through to the super bowl. It is documentary style with a narrator (different for each game), through interviews (from now and then), and some really excellent footage of the games. It focuses on the players, coaches and the dynamics that the team fought with and against to pull it together. Only thing I feel is lacking is just a little info on the opposing team.",1198972800,,444,4.5625

2934406,5,B000VAHQW4,"I absolutely recommend this product because since I saw some of them by the network cable I wish to own all of them.  This is an excelent recopilation from the NFL.

Also to buy them all is less expensive than to but it all separetely.

The video looks very good nevertheless are movies from the 60's and the music and interviews some of them are brand new.

I reconize that I'm a NFL fan since 30 years ago and I own almost all NFL DVDs, but sincerely I really recommend this one to every NFL fan.

Also I watch with my wife some superbowls and now she is getting more interested in the NFL films... and she kidding that she is more interested specially with the good locking guys ;)

Also interesting is the NFL Championship. The upstart Cowboys nearly pulled off an upset. What an ending to a great game! You'll appreciate Dave Robinson's recollection of the Cowboys last shot at a tie, which would have sent the game into overtime. If you love this era of pro football, as I do, then you'll love this DVD.",1395964800,,497,4.790697674418604
