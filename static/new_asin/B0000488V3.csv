7919705,5,B0000488V3,"I would guess I have three top favorite ski movies, this would come in 2nd.  First has to go to the MSP classic, Ski Movie - which I think has equal footage, but a better shoudtrack and editing job.  (3rd place goes to Warren Miller's Fifty)
TGR is a great company, and this movie is pretty inspiring.  The intro alone wants to make you get your skis out to sit beside you while you watch.
If you're a skier, you really can't go wrong with this movie.  I strongly recommend it.",1046649600,,477,4.208791208791209
7919706,5,B0000488V3,"One of the best ski movies, it has the worlds best skiers and is filmed in amazing locations.",952214400,4,93,4.222222222222222
7919707,5,B0000488V3,"One major ski flick!  If you love out and out, no holds barred extreme skiing this is definitely the flick for you! I have watched it 6 times and have only had the video for 2 days. This is the stuff most of us dream of  doing on fresh pow days but never get the chance to. TGR puts out the best  ski movie of the year by far. Pick up Global Storming by Matchstick  Productions while you're at it and you'll have the only 2 ski flicks you'll  ever need!  See you on the slopes! (Or in the ER! )",948672000,6,494,3.8415841584158414
