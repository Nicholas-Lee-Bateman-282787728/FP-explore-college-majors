6403973,5,B00K7817JI,"after seeing so many Gaither shows and homecoming I was sure nothing could be better. This show beats everything I saw from Bill,  We me and my wife were simply blown away by the performance. The booth brothers who are excellent were actually in a way the weakest act can you imagine and they were good. That said the Triumphant quartet is the best I have ever heard and I have over a thousand shows incluidng 20 from the gaither family. They are harmony and voice quality at it s total best. They start together and then solo , duo solo trio and finish quartet simply amazing to hear.

The third performer was taranda greene and after passing after the quartet I thought she would be lost in the show ,but she really has a voice that made you forget who passed before her which is something to do.

Greater vision came along with their three members and wow wow again asnd Finally the Collinsworth family with their six members closed off the show with such elegance and the harmony of this family is something else. Their acapella performance is something to see and hear. So Finally 10 stars for this short 2 hour show",1415491200,5,1121,4.458536585365854
6403974,4,B00K7817JI,This is a great DVD.  It has 5 different groups who sing on this.  It is almost like you are sitting there.  They have 2 different piano players play solo's and you can feel the Grace of God.  It is just wonderful.,1412985600,,214,4.023809523809524
