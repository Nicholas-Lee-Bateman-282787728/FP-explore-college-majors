You can find many videos of him on YouTube, but this video is a good starting point.
My only complaint is that I wish he would provide more recipes for his raw vegan plan.

After a week or two, I think most people would start to get tired of eating the same thing over and over again.
He states that he has more examples on his YouTube, but in my opinion, you should not have to spend hours looking through his channel to find more, I think he should provide them on the video you purchased.",1499904000,,600,4.084745762711864
