8284369,4,B001BRZQ2S,"Wish they had stuck to the VHS format where they covered each game of the season, but it was still worth buying.",1470441600,,112,4.136363636363637

8284373,2,B001BRZQ2S,I  thought it  was  a  fake  super  bowl  ring.  Was  very  sad  to  see it was a  tape of  Denvers  super  bowl  win.  The  ad  for  the product  was  mis-leading....steve.,1388707200,2,173,4.033333333333333
8284374,3,B001BRZQ2S,Probably not the fault of the seller - I guess I either didn't read the description right or did not understand what I was reading.  I purchased this thinking it was a complete replay of the superbowl game.  It is actually snippets of the game and interviews.  My husband did enjoy watching that but was dissapointed that it wasn't what we had hoped it was.,1359504000,5,357,4.461538461538462
8284375,5,B001BRZQ2S,"This really captures the year and tone before the Superbowl in great detail from so many perspectives.  It also features a lot of interview time with Elway, who really knows how to tell a story.  It's a must for any Broncos/Elway fan.",1328659200,2,234,4.5476190476190474
