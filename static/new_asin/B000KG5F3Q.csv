8156289,5,B000KG5F3Q,This was a useful video. Shawna Schuh has some great ideas for creating win-win interactions. I loved her positive energy! I think anyone who lives or works with people can get a lot out of what she has to say.,1362787200,,210,4.275
8156290,5,B000KG5F3Q,"Shawna Schuh is an entertaining speaker with excellent, creative ideas.  She shares those ideas with fun and humor so it was easy for me to watch. I am challenged in the area she is teaching and I have not yet learned to think outside the box like she is encouraging. While she does give a couple of excellent examples I really wanted more!  I wanted her to give more ""for instances"" for different situations. The DVD left me excited but wanting more ""how to"".  I tried to find more info with samples from her but so far I've been uable.  I do recommend the DVD.",1239408000,,562,4.3238095238095235
8156291,1,B000KG5F3Q,"I was greatly disappointed with this product because what I read about it and what I saw were two different things. I didn't find the presentation amusing, insightful, informative or inspiring. I had to dig to find any thing remotely useful as the presentation had no clear organization. The presenter also frequently asks the audience questions like, ""Is this true!"" "" or ""Am I right!"". Notice, they don't sound like questions, more like commands. I am sure there are much better products out there. I am grateful Amazon refunded my money because this video is not cheap: $90.00.",1179014400,4,580,4.928571428571429
