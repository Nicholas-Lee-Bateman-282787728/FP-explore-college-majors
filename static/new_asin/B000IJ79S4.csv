8351725,4,B000IJ79S4,"This 2-DVD set contains a lot of interesting information and combat and non-combat footage (some rare) of the almost forgotten P-40 Warhawk, the still popular P-51 Mustang, the B-24 Liberator, the B-17 Flying Fortress, the P-38 Lightning, the P-47 Thunderbolt, and the B-29 Superfortress. Some of the combat film is repetitive and one obviously dramatized segment of a demonstration flight is overly long and too detailed.

I was surprised to see that there's a 3-DVD set with the same graphic and a very disappointed single comment. Other than my last sentence in the previous paragraph, I really enjoyed watching this set.",1410048000,,624,5.178217821782178
