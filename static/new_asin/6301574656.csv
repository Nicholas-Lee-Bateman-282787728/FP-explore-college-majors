7812710,4,6301574656,"Studio Stoops - I think one of the more interesting things about this short is the static & hiss your hear over the soundtrack the first few minutes into this short. Can't believe no one at Columbia could not have cleaned that up, but thankfully they did so on the DVD release of this short, which is very good, btw. 4 stars

Crime on Their Hands - Another detective themed Shemp episode, which the trio of Moe, Larry and Shemp almost always excelled at. Loved when the gorilla is beating up Kenneth MacDonald & Cy Schindell and those dummies go flying through the air. Funny ending too (I helped).
4 1/2 stars

Shivering Sherlocks - An average outing, notable for the fact this was the only Shemp film directed by the great Del Lord & notable for being one of the rare times when the stock footage remake from 1955 (Of Cash and Hash) was actually better. 3 stars

Overall, a good selection of Shemp shorts.",1382572800,,907,4.451807228915663
7812711,3,6301574656,"Moe, Larry and Shemp in two from '48 and one from '50 with the usual strong troupe. All three are good efforts - there are many with Curly's replacement in this period which are better than some Curlies. ""Studio Stoops"" is one example. With some fun movie-making satirizing, the boys are off and stooging through a publicity-stunt kidnapping which becomes just a little too real (McIntyre's acting is excellent in the scenes when she's held captive). Shemp somehow winds up in the garment bag Christine was put in, and manages to settle on a ledge about 20 stories up. His life-line is a telephone which he uses to phone Moe and Larry for help. It's done in a much less frantic way than one might except, and though it is dragged out too long, it's a pretty good gag. The bad guys get caught and it's a nice wrap up.
""Crime On Their Hands"" has alot of the atmosphere of the first one-reeler mentioned, though Christine is on the side of McDonald. (She delivers a classic triple-slap at one point, worthy of note. The only sexy slap in slapstick history!). They actually manage to solve the case of the missing diamond and prove that they can succeed as crime reporters. We get a Gorilla thrown in the mix who adds some real horror to the works - though at the end he's got a clever line of dialogue. Too bad that's about the only gag which registers.
""Shivering Sherlocks"" another Stooge-noir if you will has a great early scene involving Vernon Dent and lie-detector. The versatile Christine McIntyre plays yet another character, a young lady trying to make a go of a restaurant. When the Stooges realize that they've been signing her checks as if they had credit, they insist that they work for her for free (Moe a bit more reluctantly). She discovers that she has money coming to her from some family property but to the boys something seems fishier than the clam chowder that Moe deals with (in a nice imitation of his retired Brother): the sale price is too low. The three travel to the place to discover hoods and a scary guy, who are foiled. Not much of an ending but overall it's satisfying. The (presumptive) ad-libbing on this one is a plus. Fans of Jackie Gleason might see an interesting parallel with Moe Howard's style, here and there.",1162598400,,2249,4.569306930693069
7812712,5,6301574656,"STUDIO STOOPS (1950) - an excellent stooge short! A Shemp classic!
CRIME ON THEIR HANDS (1948) - Alot of people found this one to be a weak and uninteresting short. I really enjoyed it! Shemp swallows a diamond! Another Shemp classic!
SHIVERING SHERLOCKS (1948) - A hilarious stooge short! The haunted house scene is really funny! Yet another Shemp classic!

7812713,4,6301574656,"STUDIO STOOPS, CRIME ON THEIR HANDS, and SHIVERING SHERLOCKS. This tape would be a LOT better without CRIME ON THEIR HANDS.
STUDIO STOOPS is an excellent Three Stooges short. The scenes where Shemp is hanging out the window are great. Vernon Dent is very funny as a detective. A very funny short.
CRIME ON THEIR HANDS is a pretty bad short. I don't like the scenes where Kenneth MacDonald is trying to cut Shemp open with a knife. If this short was replaced with DOPEY DICKS, SPOOKS, or WHO DONE IT?, this tape would be five stars.
SHIVERING SHERLOCKS is a very funny short, although little is new here. After the lie detector scene, the short goes into plot which basically combines BUSY BUDDIES, DUTIFUL BUT DUMB, and IDLE ROOMERS. Those are all great shorts, but I prefer those instead. This is still a pretty good short, though.
The first and last short were great, but I do not like CRIME ON THEIR HANDS.",1010966400,,909,4.548780487804878
7812714,4,6301574656,"An all-""Sherlock Stooges"" tape:
STUDIO STOOPS (1950) - A creative short, with a great cast and a lot of great scenes. The boys look hilarious in those fancy outfits. Highlight of the short is Shemp hanging outside the 10th story window, with nothing to grab on to but a phone.
CRIME ON THEIR HANDS (1948) - Another solid short, with great supporting actors Kenneth MacDonald and Christine McIntyre. The ending is surprising. Shemp acting bossy to Moe in one scene is a hoot.
SHIVERING SHERLOCKS (1948) - The only weak short on the tape.  This suffers from too many plot holes, and weak scenes. Moe acting like Curly when he's poorly redoing the oyster soup routine (that Curly did in DUTIFUL BUT DUMB) is terrible.  Some people say it was a tribute to Curly, but he could've found a better way to show a tribute to his brother other than poorly copying Curly's mannerisms.  He did this in some other Shemp shorts as well. The ending had no sting.
Had the 3rd detective short been DOPEY DICKS, this tape would've been a gem.  Still good, though.",994464000,,1044,4.596774193548387
