5763962,5,B00CZP9YWS,"Even though this is an excellent movie with great actors Some of the dates and years do not add up Mistakes in the storyline were made Which Liberace was in love with Sonya Henie  in 1977 but she died in 1969..the music is excellent ,the wardrobe is flashy over the top His Las Vegas home It was beautiful I also remember the palimony suit And the scandal that was made of it The movie shows a realistic lifestyle of two gay men At times you feel like you're actually there living it with them Hats off to HBO for having The good sense to bring us such a powerful movie That really could not be told until today ..",1371168000,6,614,4.159663865546219
5763963,4,B00CZP9YWS,"The film is based on the autobiographical novel of the same name by Scott Thorson (with Alex Thorleifson) adapted for the screen by Richard LaGravenese about the tempestuous 6-year relationship between Liberace and his much younger lover Scott Thorson. This film along with SIDE EFFECTS are purported to be Steven Soderbergh's last films he will direct.

The cast is very solid. Matt Damon embodies the role of Scott Thorson well - a young apparently bisexual man who has been tossed from foster home to foster home while he does odd jobs (he is 17 years old) tending to animals. In a gay bar he meets Bob Black (Scott Bakula) who takes Scott to a Liberace concert (his first exposure to the megastar) and to meet Liberace afterwards. There is tension in the air with Liberace's current paramour and performing partner Billy Leatherwood (Cheyenne Jackson) and we soon discover that Liberace (impeccably played by Michael Douglas) only keeps his `boys' around for a while before his manager Seymour (Dan Ackroyd) gets rid of them with a check. Liberace and Scott find common ground in being needy people without confidants and soon Scott becomes Liberace's next lover. All goes swimmingly until Liberace sees himself on a TV show and sees how aged he has become. He engages plastic surgeon Dr. Jack Startz (Rob Lowe in a very fine performance) to perform a youthful facelift and at the same time convinces Scott to undergo plastic surgery to make him look more like Liberace! And here begins the downfall: Dr. Startz prescribes pain meds to Scott who becomes addicted and moves into heavier drugs, and his behavior, along with Liberace's need for a `new face' (Boyd Holbrook), signals the breakup of a 6 year relationship - the best relationship either has ever had.

There are excellent cameos by Debbie Reynolds as Liberace's mother, Paul Reiser as Scott's lawyer, and others, but the star of the film is in all ways the flamboyant showman Liberace in some of the most interesting outfits ever created. The on screen relationship between Michael Douglas and Matt Damon is entirely credible and neither of these fine actors has a problem with being sexually physical without seeming to be a parody. There are moments that could have been cut, but as Liberace says, less is more and more is wonderful. Grady Harp, May 13",1371081600,65,2319,4.883248730964467
5763964,3,B00CZP9YWS,"I was not all impressed with this movie.  Though the acting was superb by both Michael Douglas and Matt Damon, it just seemed boring and going nowhere.  The director and production staff seem to focus on the setting and having enough glamour and glitz to go around.  Of course that was what Liberace was all about.  Still I felt there was no real story to all of this.  First the meeting between the 2 men, then all of a sudden they are in a bedroom scene and then they are going for plastic surgery.  This movie just jumps around, with no continuity.  Also Damon did not come across as a young man with his wrinkles and all.  I felt that Douglas did a great job both on and off the stage as Liberace.  He was very convincing.  I could do without all the sexual scenes and reference to acts which I know homosexuals do.  Must we be bombarded constantly with gross behavior and language.  Maybe I am asking for the stars, but I am tired of watching movies which always focus on sex.  I am surely in the minority, as that is probably why most people go to see this kind of movie.",1370822400,7,1077,4.246305418719212
5763965,5,B00CZP9YWS,"This is an intriguing and bizarre story of Liberace told through the eyes of his many-year companion Scott. I read an article about this prior to seeing it and wish I'd been more surprised by the unfolding events. This a the kind of story that is better to come into blind, without reading plot-spoiling articles or reviews. So if you are thinking about watching his film, do.

The A-team performances of Micheal Douglas as Liberace, Matt Damon as Scott, Debbie Reynolds as Liberace's controlling mother, and Rob Lowe as the vain, doctor (painfully over-done with plastic surgery) are flawless. Dan Ackroyd as Liberace's avaricious agent is excellent as well. The two main performances are riveting - Oscar performance worthy, though with the HBO distribution I guess this film will not be eligible for an Oscar. Douglas unwaveringly nails Liberace's voice and mannerism, and the film seamlessly intersperses footage of the real Liberace as a young man; Damon once again shows his incredible range as an actor playing the polar opposite of the tough guy, bad boy, heart throb role. The makeup in this movie is simply amazing. Micheal Douglas is transformed into the spitting image of Liberace and various characters age, gain and lose mass, and go through other appearance-changing life issues.

Scott is a naive and talent animal trainer and aspiring vet who meets Liberace through a friend and starts to treat Liberace's poodle. As a child, Scott had been through many families in the foster system and as a young man is seeking a acceptance, love, and a father figure. He quickly becomes drawn into Liberace's flamboyant public life and bizarre private life; after the elderly poodle dies Scott even takes on the dog's nickname. A great film that I'd love to see released on the big screen.
PS - I have to disagree with some of the other reviewers on one point: Matt Damon was well cast given the age range of his character throughout the movie.",1370736000,52,1948,4.9
5763966,5,B00CZP9YWS,"When I heard that Michael Douglas and Matt Damon were to carry the lead roles in this story, I was VERY dubious.  They are both sensational actors but I'm just so used to Michael Douglas doing films where he gets into trouble with crazy women.  Behind the Candelabra is quite a leap but he and Mr. Damon carry it off beautifully.  I was simply astounded.  The film seemed pretty close to real life from what I remember of Liberace and the music throughout just heightened this refreshing experience.  I would rate this as one of the films of the year and would even say it it's one of the best performances by both lead gentlemen.  The supporting cast was also great and all comes together to create a magnificent viewing experience.  If you're turned off by a story of gay relationships, get over it and settle down to watch Behind the Candelabra.  It's tastefully and artistically a masterpiece.",1370649600,59,897,4.632911392405063
5763967,5,B00CZP9YWS,"I should start off by saying that I typically do not write movie reviews, so I hope what I write here is helpful.

I wasn't sure about this movie at first based off of the previews, but after watching it I completely fell in love with it. It was sweet, emotional, upsetting and beautiful. Matt Damon and Michael Douglas were incredible as were all of the supporting actors! I found myself a little heartbroken by the end of the movie and could not help but crying, but I still watched it again and plan to watch it again in the future. If you are putt off by man-on-man action, just know that there is VERY LITTLE in this movie! I know that's a big deal to some people, so I thought it was worth noting. This is truly a must see and I love it!",1370563200,29,743,4.124137931034483

5763977,3,B00CZP9YWS,"It's okay.  Definitely, not the quality expected of a big screen movie.  I would expect to see this as a made for TV movie.  I also wonder how much of this movie was verified by someone other than Scott, who has a very untrustworthy character-exemplified by his current situation.  I believe he is in prison now.  He has certainly spent time there.  I was always interested as to why Scott agreed to sign over so much stuff during the Palimony suit.  Supposedly (according to the movie), the house ($200,000 value) was in his name and Liberace was just a co-signer and he was asked to sign over three cars.  In exchange, he got three cars, three dogs, his clothes, and $75,000.  Do the math?????  I bet he had wished he had pushed through those adoption papers.  Scott was with Liberace for about 6 years, I believe.  He lived for free very luxuriously, I might add.  I am not sure why he thought he was entitled to anything.  He wasn't even with Liberace long enough to claim a common law marriage.

The movie was cheesy, I think.  But Liberace was so over the top, it is difficult to determine whether it was true to his nature.  And.....it was during the 70s and early 80s, lol.

Liberace's house was bought for only $500,000!  Hard to believe.",1502928000,,1247,4.486607142857143

5763984,4,B00CZP9YWS,"Great movie, and the Blu Ray looks & sounds great- down to see little patterns on shirts. The only drawback is it would've been nice to delve into the making of it more, and telling a little about all the characters in the film. For instance, Douglas never learned to play the piano- it's CGI, and a GREAT job too! Michael has a higher pitched 'whine' than Liberace did, but his acting really off sets that. Matt is great as Scott, being brought into Lee's other world as such. The interaction between Michael & Matt is really great. I felt a little uncomfortable at times because it's so personal! All in all, it's not a 'gay' love story, it's just a love story- a bit STRANGE, but still a love story.",1498608000,2,702,4.366412213740458
5763985,3,B00CZP9YWS,"Great performances. Tough subject matter that is handled well by two stars that really put it all out there.

5763986,3,B00CZP9YWS,"It's an okay movie . Michael Douglas was truly amazing, and not surprising to me. All the actors were great I tihik I just didn't like the story line, but I had heard about the scandal, the young man who was very upset at Liberace.  I knew he was gay, and I guess all the personal stuff was to bring us to see that world with our own eyes. I think it should have been inferred but I understand why it wasn't. I would have preferred inferences and not such explicit scenes , but Liberace came out like a sex addict, the drugs, the whole under world theme. Not my favorite film and I'm sorry Liberace wasn't as classy as we grew up believing him to be. In this movie, he's being depicted as someone really low life. I'm so sorry to say this, but this is the feeling I'm walking away with. He used this young guy as a play toy. .",1496620800,3,826,4.067484662576687

5763993,5,B00CZP9YWS,"Succeeds on so many levels and for so many reasons.  Steven Soderbergh did a masterful job of taking a story that could have easily dissolved into gratuitous farce/exploitation and imbuing it with humanity and compassion, along with narrative punch.  An acting tour de force by both Damon and Douglas, especially Douglas.  Douglas has Liberace's mannerisms, walk, movements etc. down to a T, astonishing.  Both actors play their roles with just the right amount of pathos and passion, flaws intact.  A powerful depiction of one person (a narcissist, likely) using another for his own selfish purposes, leaving him with nothing.  The supporting actors, e.g., Rob Lowe, Debbie Reynolds, Scott Bakula, Dan Akroyd, Bruce Ramsay (the jaded houseboy), all concerned, were superb.

Add to this glitz, glamor, Liberace's phenomenal playing, and his charismatic persona (especially in the final scene), and it is plain to see why Liberace was a superstar.  I saw him perform in 1979 on the Queen Mary (I worked behind the scenes as a concierge and met him- an experience right up there with meeting John Carradine and Natalie Wood.  Thorsen was likely there, but I don't remember).  Liberace had his white baby grand piano lowered by crane onto the ship for use in his show (and possibly his Rolls Royce, though I may be imagining that).  He wore the white ermine robe with the yards long train, and absolutely wowed the crowd, the consummate showman.  A revealing and incisive look at a moment and place in time- if you like stories about Hollywood, celebrity, or gay culture in the drug-infused 70s and 80s, you may find this as provocative and fascinating as I did.  I recommend it for the acting alone- phenomenal.",1488758400,4,1709,4.975352112676056

5764032,3,B00CZP9YWS,"Three excellent, multi-talented actors (Michael Douglas, in what could have been an Oscar-winning performance; Matt Damon in a real stretch,
proving his acting credentials; and Dan Akroyd, a true journeyman, always able to disappear into his roles); beautiful sets, costuming, camera work; sound; and a well written screenplay; all of which nearly created another classic to compare with Ray, Walk the Line, and Beyond the Sea, Almost!
The ending was a bit hokey (Liberace ascending into Heaven?); although it was compatible with his idea of showmanship and Damon's character's
perceptions. The film would have survived that; what broke the spell were the overly graphic sex scenes between the two men. i'm not a homophobe, don't even object to a little tasteful pornography, if that's what interests you, but these scenes-brief though they were- seemed gratuitous and out of place. Perhaps they tried to send a message; if so it missed the mark--like pairing a mustache on the Mona Lisa. Too bad, it's a could-have-been. Maybe we can blame the editors.

Was Lee merely blinded by the beads, sequins, spangles, and spotlights? Who knows, but then who cares? Both Douglas and Damon tap brilliantly into the crazy zeitgeist in front of and ""Behind the Candelabra"" while paying homage to Lee's struggle in the closet. The sadness in this film's depiction of Lee's thirty-plus year career spent dissembling his sexuality is palpable and tragic; the script peels back the layers of truth in what can only be described as a skin-shedding--and shredding--homage to Lee's ineffable gifts, glitz and kitch-glam.

I liked the balance of their strengths and flaws.  Their choices not only affected their own lives but those around them as well.  It allowed the viewer to love and respect the talent and life of Liberace, rather than destroy his persona. The movie addressed Liberace's gay cover up in his social and professional life but not in his personal life.  He managed to adapt to society in order to be successful in the public eye.  Liberace was the Michael Jackson or Madonna of his day, reaching a high fame status.  He was a household celebrity in the US.  This movie is helpful for adults who want to see people as people.  It is more than a film about a celebrity gay couple. It is a love story.  Kudos to Michael and Matt for their acting talents.",1483488000,,875,4.551282051282051

5764079,4,B00CZP9YWS,"I'm torn on reviewing this. On the one hand, there is the movie itself (which, of course, is what should be reviewed) and then there is the subject matter. I don't have a problem with the gay part of it but, rather, the smothering aspects of Liberace's relationship. (Also, movies about relationships that we know are going to go south tend to put me off.) I recoiled in horror over his lavish gift-giving, his possessiveness and even going so far as to have Scott transformed by surgery to resemble himself. Yikes! Also, I did some additional internet cruising and found Scott Thorson is not one of our finest citizens. (Currently doing time in a Nevada prison.)

OK, the movie itself: It followed a coherent narrative and the performances, especially of Michael Douglas and Matt Damon, were all quite good. the opulent showmanship of Liberace was well showcased. (I'm 66 and remember seeing Liberace often in my youth on TV but cannot remember exactly on what. I do recall being a bit taken aback by him thinking something wasn't quite right. The same could be said of the Lawrence Welk Show; my parents may have liked it but it was not something kids were terribly enthusiastic about.)  Rob Lowe's character was priceless! I laughed out loud when he first appeared and I appreciated him throughout the movie. I watched this on the day Debbie Reynolds died and was shocked to realize that I didn't recognize her during the movie. (I can see her character in my head and recall being amused by her but I completely spaced on the fact that it was her. Sorry, Debbie!) And props to Dan Aykroyd for having the nerve to wear the world's worst hairpiece!

Do I recommend this? I'd give it a qualified yes. I didn't particularly care for it but only for the reasons stated in my first paragraph. The second paragraph states why I would say ""Sure! See it!"".",1483142400,,1851,4.654434250764526

5764082,5,B00CZP9YWS,"I'd heard a lot about ""Behind the Candelabra"" but I'd never made an effort to see until now. Michael Douglas is simply stupendous as Liberace, but the entire ensemble had me mesmerized. They performed so well, helped along by incredible make-up, that I never recognized Debbie Reynolds as Frances Liberace, nor Dan Ackroyd as Seymour, the manager, until well into the movie. Rob Lowe was downright scary as the plastic surgeon and I have yet to see Scott Bakula behind the character of Bob Black, the man who introduces Scott Thorson to Liberace. As Scott, Matt Damon brings depth and sympathy to a character that many people disliked and dismissed as a gold-digger. It can be a tough movie to watch, even for those of us who accept homosexual relationships, because it captures risky and aberrant sexual practices, but that's a reality in gay culture even though many gay people don't embrace such practices. In the end, the movie helped me see both Lee and Scott as victims of Liberace's ego.",1483142400,2,994,4.818713450292398

5764088,3,B00CZP9YWS,"This is the only movie I can truly say was both repulsive and spellbinding.  Repulsive because of the relationship that Liberace had with his lover and how truly dumb the lover was and how Liberace manipulated him then threw him away which you can see coming because of the personality of Liberace.  Repulsive because the sex scenes, although no full frontal, were just short of that and still repulsive.  But I have never watched a film where I was so taken in by the performances of Douglas--whom I never cared for--and Damon who I adore.  They were magnificent and so believable.  The costumes and make overs were so believable, just extraordinary to transform Damon into a young male while he, himself adds just the right inflections without overdoing it of being gay.  I remember Liberace and Douglas captured him perfectly.  Rob Lowe is also outstanding.  I wonder why they would all do this film--obviously because of Soderheim, it was brilliantly done, but so creepy..  I remember when this picture came out that no major studio would get behind it, thus it ended up on HBO.",1482969600,5,1082,4.805405405405406

The piano music was beautiful. Accuracy, I'm not sure of. But it wasn't real distasteful. It was weird seeing the two actors portraying gay men.  I remember in the 1980's, when Liberace was dying. The lawyers and agent's tried covering up his gayness, pretty much successfully.  Unfortunately, after Hudson died of Aids, people became aware of Aids and Liberace was always suspected to be gay.  So when it came out that Liberace died of Aids it might have shocked some but not everyone.  On a side note.  In the fifties, when he was on television, women swooned over him.  He was somewhat of a sex symbol.  But when tabloids came out with, I believe,, a shipboard incident, with a young boy involved with Liberace, his star did become a bit tarnished. Liberace sued and won. All allegations were dropped.  But I remember my mother never got over it. After that I think people may more so suspected he was gay. But he sure keep it a secret.  Sad story when he died. He really was a good man and a fabulous, genius entertainer.",1479859200,,1182,4.634615384615385

Second, the disc has some kind of new encryption and you cannot use it unless you are able to somehow update ""firmware"" in your DVD player.  You will need a DVD player that has Firmware version 2.0.  Amazon tried replacing the dvd but the replacement had the same issues.  I tried looking it up on the net, it seems a lot of new titles on blu-ray have the same issues and people have said they are going back to regular dvd's and not purchasing blu-ray titles due to the issue.  Amazon was great as they immediately gave credit for the purchase of this product.  The studios need to warn people of this problem.  When DVD's originally came out, they promised that they will never make players that could not play regular dvd's. Obviously that doesn't pertain to new blu-rays.

Seeing two men making love is not something I really need to see.,1476403200,,260,4.22

I just stumbled upon it, didn't notice the names of the actors, thought it was just a B-movie cable filler, and found myself completely mesmerized by the movie as it unfolded.  The acting is terrific!  Who are these people, I asked myself. To my total surprise, the actor playing Liberace is Michael Douglas!  I promise you, you will not recognize him.  And the actor playing the tall, boyish Scott Thorsen turned out to be Matt Damon.  With camera angles etc. they made Michael Douglas look like the small Liberace and Matt Damon look like a much larger person and a piece of beefcake.  They were both sympathetic characters, and I was very bought up in their lives story.  I was very sorry that Scott's drug use eventually caused Liberace to reject him.",1475798400,,803,4.685714285714286

5764125,5,B00CZP9YWS,"Wow! I don't know how accurate this is but lets assume it is dead on.....Wow. It left me with an entirely different view of Liberace. He was to say the least a little bit creepy! It in no way detracts from his talent, that is his forever, but he was CREEPY! What it doesn't tell you is that Scott Thorsen was a mere 16 when this affair with Liberace started. Creepy on top of Creepy, right? It left Scott damaged for life with a never ending drug problem, I don't think he will ever make peace with what all happened, He was just too young. Amazing what celebs get by with. That is our fault entirely. They should be held to the same standards as everyone else and I don't mean because they were engaged in a gay affair, that has absolutely nothing to do with it.

First of all, I grew up watching Liberace on all of the talk shows; Carson, Merv Griffin, Dinah Shore, etc. There was no guessing about his lifestyle and he was a genius; there was no guessing about that either.  The WOW comes in because Michael Douglas' performance is beyond superb and he is a perfect example of an actor because who would have thought that with is movie history with women (Basic Instinct, Fatal Attraction, etc.) he could pull off playing a middle-aged, gay concert piano player.  But he is outstanding!  Matt Damon is also outstanding.  Can't say enough about the acting.  We can only assume that this is accurate since it comes directly from Scott Thorson's book.

They both did terrific jobs and amazingly the setting for the movie had so much of Liberace's types of Clothing, they used one his original pianos from the museum and they remade the actual look of his home wherever possible. The whole cast is wonderful as is the film maker and crew.  If you like movies about all the lives of Musicians, you'll like this. I have eclectic taste in music, so I never mind what genre's they are. In this movie, you forget about Liberace being gay. He and Scott Thorson's life together gets to seem like a married couple going through the same problems that heterosexuals go through. The ups and the downs. The heart felt pain suffered.

The film held my attention throughout the 2 hour duration, although I must be a bit critical of Michael Douglas' performance.

This role showed him trying to mimic Liberace's nasal timbre which became almost as much his trademark as was his candelabra and glittery costumes but it seemed as though Douglas was playing Douglas.  Immediately, you noticed the actor's classic stares, icy demeanor, and ability to look weak and strong at the same time. Naturally, both Michael Douglas and Matt Damon received praise for their 8 individual interpretations, but  Douglas walked away with the most accolades.

Although Damon offered the requisite ""eye candy"", surprisingly that took second place to his acting ability and believe ability.  I was not as impressed with Douglas's portrayal.

Michael D's voice inflections, movements, characterization were mediocre at best; I simply did not see the need for this film and portrayal of a man who was, and set the precedence for ""outrageous, but entertaining"" stage presence and who truly did have talent.

Not sure what I expected, other than to hear some beautiful piano music, and catch a glimpse of his personal life, but I found this movie sleazy, from beginning to end.  Watched Liberace's TV show as a child, and as an adult, stopped watching his TV Specials because I was so very annoyed at his expecting applause for his ridiculous outfits, his new cars, his chauffeurs, and more.  If he had to wear those costumes, that was fine with me, but expecting applause for his wild get-ups and all the other nonsense his Specials presented to us, was more than I could handle.  Even today, I enjoy his recordings........and I'm not expected to applaud his outfits, cars, or chauffeurs.  This movie just brought back all the things I found annoying about him.

That being said, I was pleasantly surprised at the complex performances by Douglas and Matt Damon. They enacted an age old drama without being too cartoonish. I cried!
My parents ""forced"" me to see Liberace at Radio City as a kid and the atmosphere of the film and Douglas' performance have that same ""twinkle"". An unexpected gem!",1447286400,,444,4.933333333333334

I love the glam and glitz, in most of the movie, lol.  I think both actors did an amazing job!!  I got a little aggravated with how some of the scenes played out and then had to remember this was a true story.  I think Scott was ""fair"" in his telling of the story, considering.  IMO, I guess it's good Liberace is gone because in today's world I would certainly hope they would have put the man away regardless of his fame and fortune!!",1447113600,,612,4.315789473684211

5764471,4,B00CZP9YWS,"When I first viewed the movie, I felt the story had been told from a very one-sided perspective (Scott Thorson's) and perhaps portrayed Liberace unfairly and even untruthfully.  However upon re-watching it, I found it much more enjoyable due to the performances by both leads (Michael Douglas and Matt Damon, both amazing)  and supporting actors (Rob Lowe is a scream) which helped me appreciate more the campy, comical aspects of the movie and overlook the slanted point of view from which the story was told. Regardless of whether it's rooted in any sort of reality, the movie is so darned entertaining and ultimately heartbreaking.",1447027200,,634,5.086538461538462

5764499,5,B00CZP9YWS,Riveting movie. Both Michael Douglas and Matt Damon make you feel like you are watching the actual Liberace and his boyfriend. Each character is sympathetic at times and at other times remarkably callous. A movie that keeps you guessing as to what will happen next and suprising you even though you probably should have seen the next turn of events coming.,1446422400,,356,4.852459016393443

The four of us had a wonderful time, Liberace was very quiet, he had just finished a performance.  People came up to our table and said hello and he cordially responded.  He actually acted shy. I sat next to him and he let me try on his grand piano ring.  Liberace was a complete gentleman. It was sort of a set up.  When we got back to the Hilton, where he was staying, Liberace asked me if I would like to come up to his suite. I politely declined, which he was fine with, and I was taken back home with a nice experience to remember.  I did not care for the representation of Liberace in the movie, and prefer to remember him as the gentleman I was fortunate to meet one evening back in 1975.",1446422400,,800,4.070063694267516

5764514,2,B00CZP9YWS,"Stopped watching after one hour, and I had to push myself to continue watching up to that point.  I went back the next day and just skipped through the rest of the film. Essentially the film portrays a tragic relationship that is reflects Liberace's hyper controlling nature to the point of even forcing his ""love"" interest to alter his face. All of this is a classic form of the abuse. Liberace's victim, Scott, reflected the typical dynamic that controlling abusers look for, someone vulnerable with few family connections, a fragile sense of self, and little outside support.  I stopped watching because as a counselor I used to specialize in helping victims of abuse (sexual/physical/neglect/control) and it was too painful to watch the ongoing abuse spiral. When I went back the next day and skipped through the rest of the film, it pretty much went where I thought it was going to go -- the victim starts to stand up to his abuser and is dumped. Liberace and Scott never come to terms with their destructive habits.  There are no real insights, no attempts to change, and scant little attempts to really love one another.  For me the film was another in the long list of how much Hollywood churns out films about psychopaths, sociopaths, and abusive people. All the way to the end the film only showed the tragic nature of both men's lives. It didn't counter it much with what was good about either man. But, maybe it is for the best that we start to wake up to the reality of how much we glorify hype, glitz, and excess which Liberace reflected in the extreme. The only positive note I got out of this movie was that towards the end it did start to show empathy for the plight of gays in regards to marriage and AIDS.  In 1986 I worked with young men dying of AIDS when the disease was totally something you did not want to talk about.  I went into schools to try to educate people to get past the fear of AIDS and the gay community.  As a heterosexual woman who was young at the time, I had no idea how much the gay/lesbian culture suffered under the weight of having to deny themselves. The tragic pressure of not being able to simply love who you love was shown somewhat in this film. I have so much empathy for that.  Love is a wonderful thing no matter the sexual preference.  The key is to understand what love is something too many people (gay or straight) are confused about. Love is not about control.  It is not about abuse. It is not about addiction and getting high on thrills.  It is not about money.  It isn't even about sex.  It is about understanding, accepting, caring, and nurturing one another.  In the end of the film some glimmers of love emerged.  But, mostly it was two people struggling to know what love is in the first place and coming up short. Finally, hats off to Michael Douglas and Matt Damon for taking on these difficult roles.  May all of us gay/straight/bi/transgender learn to get behind the glitz and into a space of learning what it is like to really be vulnerable and be loved once and for all.",1446249600,10,3040,4.480072463768116

Michael Douglas and Matt Damon took big risk to play their respective roles, but it paid off because they were quite believable in their acting to play these real people.  The casting directors made some good choices.  Michael Douglas for sure reminded me of the flamboyant Liberace.  The story is a well known one of the man who had a secret boyfriend(s), but never shared that side of him in the public eyes in order to maintain his wealth and reputation as a skillful pianist.  At the time of his success, being gay was not popularly accepted and was often shunned.  Most entertainers who shared such secrets lost their careers.  This movie is about the side of Liberace people in general did not know about until after his death.",1445472000,,791,4.607142857142857

This film did not feature, however, Liberace's classical expertise of the Masters.  Not just a showman, Liberace's command of the piano inspired a love of the ""long hair"" composers on his many, many LPs.in our home.  thank you, Lee!  mrf",1444694400,,567,5.208791208791209

This is back in the 70s, mind.  We didn't know anything about what 'Gay' was.  We only knew we loved him.  Now I'm older - and I now identify as 'Pansexual' - and I still love him, and this is just a wonderful movie about a man that was supremely talented, and *very* human.  He had his flaws, for certain.  But, when you love someone, you love ALL of them, even the parts you don't particularly like.

As for Michael Douglas portrayal of Lee, I felt he was spot on.  I loved how they treated Lee's story with such dignity.

I knew next to nothing about Liberace, but having heard family members talk about what a showman he was, and hearing great reviews, I decided to give this one a go.  There's very little fluff, surprisingly.  Douglas & Damon are both excellent in their respective roles, and you quickly see them as the characters they're supposed to be, instead of just acting as themselves.  Soderbergh uses a simplistic style to focus on the relationships between the characters without being too ham-fisted.  It doesn't feel like a documentary, but rather ""fly on the wall"" narrative that lets one think critically about the relationship shown.

If legitimate, the movie does reveal a different side of life than anything that I have ever experienced or observed, not being in the industry. Having said that, it was somewhat educational! I would recommend it; it would be a good conversation starter and offer a way to discuss our pre-conceived perceptions of what the lifestyle was about back then as compared to now - more open, marriage, commitment, etc.",1441584000,,635,4.72972972972973

5764815,4,B00CZP9YWS,"This bio-pic pulls no punches in an examination of the love affair between Liberace and Scott Thorsen. It's based on Thorsen's autobiography, so it's going to make Thorsen look more positive than possibly happened in real life--was there true love or were each using each other? The ambiguity is hinted at fairly well, though the general slant is that the older man manipulated the younger and corrupted him. Perhaps this is true.

It doesn't matter--the acting is so good. Of course, Michael Douglas is such a master of costume and mannerism that he practically channels the flamboyant Vegas star, and you think you're looking at the real Liberace. Matt Damon plays the maybe-not-so-innocent ingenu well and he steals the screen whenever he's on it. Dan Ackroyd is wonderful as Liberace's agent and patient caretaker.

There is sex though not a lot of nudity (bare bums, mostly) . If you are skeeved off by gay guys kissing and more--you'll be a bit uncomfortable. The subject is handled well--it's part of the story line, to be sure. I think the director was able to portray what he had to, without going overboard. This makes the film more mainstream than I expected. The one criticism I have is that Liberace's demise from AIDS, and the subsequent brouhaha with the county coroner was not handled as sharply as I thought it ought to be. If you lived during that era, the epidemic was frightening to everyone. The obituaries weekly in major urban newspapers were filled with the deaths of young and middle-aged men, many prominent. There was absolutely no treatment for it, and the spread was like wildfire. The fear was everywhere. This was not really dealt with--so you might not understand why the coroner refused the cause of death listed by Liberace's personal physician (""cardiac arrest"") and why he went to the trouble of tracking down the actual cause. This was played down too much, in my opinion. The times were scary.

This was available in Amazon Prime, so I though, what the hey, wonder how this would work out. Surprisingly fine film that got good critical reviews.",1441497600,4,2082,4.859154929577465

The costumes, jewelry, homes, etc were lavish and in keeping with his style.  It shows how lonely he really was and how fame and fortune can complicate life.

Matt Damon plays young (very young, Lee's lover was 17 when they first went to bed) with the help of astounding makeup--he then gets flabby on Lee's cooking, and becomes wasted as a pill-popping, cocaine sniffing man obsessed with staying younger than constant parade of new flesh who shared Lee's hot tub.

Well developed story. Great performances by well-known performers about, ultimately, a relationship that goes downhill, badly. Since I didn't read the opening credits, it was a fun surprise to discover who played a few of the key characters; namely, Liberace, his attorney, his mom; Bob and Dr. Startz.

Cons:
I saw the story as incredibly sad. Not much is left to the imagination (adult theme, male-male sex and nudity, language), hence, my offering an NC-17, which, apparently, is the current name for former X rating.",1440806400,,526,5.116279069767442

Everyone is multi-faceted and this could have been so much more than a sleeze flick.

Debbie Reynolds as Liberace's eccentric mother was a surprise treat.  Her Polish accent is perfection (she sounded exactly like my Polish grandma).

5765010,1,B00CZP9YWS,An ad for homosexuality. Couldn't watch more then 20 minutes into this movie because of all the homosexual erotic undertones. I realize it's about Liberace but come on!,1440460800,,168,5.035714285714286
5765011,4,B00CZP9YWS,"Pardon the pun, but at times, it drags...but Douglas really gets Liberace right. I'm old enough to recall him being omnipresent on TV and a camp icon before America grasped what camp really was. He practically invented it. Learning more about Scott's real-life counterpart makes me realize that his role was pretty sanitized, but it does come off as though Liberace really tossed lovers aside. But then again, that's Scott's take; who knows what it was really like? But if the business about Scott being told to have surgery to look like Liberace is true, than that is some world-class narcissism. But you want to like the brilliant goofball that Liberace was (or seems to have been).

Rob Lowe is scary good, esp. scary with the plastic-y plastic surgeon role. Perfectly cast.

In some ways, it seemed like a typical celebrity pic, just with an insane amount of glitter and fur. But Douglas was so much fun to watch (even if I did not need to seem him nude) that this one rises above the usual ""fame and money will kill your soul"" narrative.

The ending sequence is really amazing! Flying! And apparently, inspired by an actual performance.",1440460800,2,1141,4.752525252525253

However, I took the time to view the film and I enjoyed it very much. There is no doubt that Liberace was quite a character and a talented performer, but I thought Michael Douglas took on quite a challenge in this role and he nailed it.  Matt Damon brought the more humble side of the story and I give him kudos for the depth be brought to the story. Of course, the public mostly guessed that Liberace was a gay man, but it was his ongoing struggle to keep it hidden that was the real drama. I don't know if Liberace, in real life, actually reconciled with his ex-lover, but it was a very nice ending to this movie...whether reality or not. I liked the film very much and was really awed by Michael Douglas' performance of Liberace--just as awesome as Meryl Streep performing the roles of Julia Child (Julie & Julia) or Margaret Thatcher (Iron Lady).",1440460800,,1018,4.386243386243386

You could see him ""acting"" like Liberace. As a biopic, I couldn't see much of any redeeming value in Liberace. It seemed to focus more on Matt Damon's character, Scott. But both portrayals seemed forced. It was definitely not a movie where you lost yourself in the story. I was constantly noticing the acting.

5765136,4,B00CZP9YWS,Awesome story and acting by some of the top actors in Hollywood. I saw Liberace in person around mid-70's when I was in high school. I love music and thought he was amazing and very entertaining to watch on stage. This movie brings out how talented this man was as well as his personal life which is surprising to watch and well done. I wouldn't recommend it to younger children or teens due to some adult content and drug use.,1439769600,,427,4.35

5765138,3,B00CZP9YWS,This flick sheds a darker light on the persona most remember of Liberace. The fact that the story was based on Thorsons book offers a completely different side of who we believed Liberace was. The acting was marginal at best though I'm sure it was difficult for 2 accomplished straight actors to step into the role of 2 very gay men. Worth watching just for the revelationary content.,1439769600,,384,4.661764705882353

I lived and worked in Vegas from 1976 to 1981 and went to his show a couple of times, best show ever seen hands down. This movie did not in any way do justice to his shows, although I do remember his blond friend driving on stage in that limo. I thought the story line made the point of the relationship between the two, but was waiting for the suit filed which they did not cover. I took off a star because it seems it would have been better to use actual clips from his real shows, so don't judge him on what was shown.",1439683200,,674,4.075187969924812

I'll leave other reviews to deal with story and plot.  It was well written, well paced and quite engaging, two hours swiftly go by.  The casting director hit the jackpot with these actors who give bravura performances, especially Michael Douglass as Liberace. His performance is no crass imitation. He is not similar to Liberace at all physically but he becomes is Liberace. You will love when he is on screen. Matt Damon also does a great job. Then you have Rob Lowe and Debbie Reynolds, good performances.

I myself am a lifelong  Milwaukeen and have enjoyed Lee Liberace's performances many times on TV and his movie, Sincerely Yours. This movie is definitely NOT for homophobes! While it tries to be sensitive, I feel it misses the mark.

5765274,5,B00CZP9YWS,"STEVEN SODERBERGH just doesn't make bad movies. He seems incapable of it. he's an old-school style craftsman & artist in the John Ford William Wyler Howard Hawks family of filmmakers who have no ""signature style"" (i.e.; they are NOT ""auteurs"") yet they make one movie after another that is nothing less than PERFECT. there just isn't a missing not anywhere in this lovely 70's-era symphony of style and design. even the color correction (or ""tinting"") looks totally 70's as the film begins, and slowly, as the 80s unfold, the colors change to reflect THAT era. Soderbergh didn't miss a beat. he's a GENIUS.

oh and by the way, the two stars give the best performances of their entire careers. Michael Douglas has never been braver, and Matt Damon shows all the artistry as an actor that his old partner Affleck simply doesn't possess. Damon is pure gold here.

If it is to wave an LGBT flag its flounders in floppery It also demeans the two characters and the people behind the roles they play but that would have to be expected.

He gave his character just the right soft touch to make you think - I wonder if he's gay. Most straight actors can't pull that subtle touch off. Michael Douglas portrayed Liberace with a little more camp. Well, how could you not? Liberace made a fortune being the campiest flame in the universe. That's why we loved him. The story itself was interesting. The phenomenon of obviously gay guys with millions of straight female fans who insist - to the death - that their  guy is all-man is fascinating. You could draw a straight line from Liberace to Manilow to Aiken. To get a glimpse of what Liberace was like behind the glitter, or candelabra, was a treat.",1439164800,,782,4.666666666666667

5765352,3,B00CZP9YWS,I was rather disappointed in this. Production values and acting were all good. I felt the story was slow and the POV unclear. Usually in a good bio-pic there is a reasoning behind the narrative and I just felt this wandered too much.,1439164800,,233,4.441860465116279

5765354,5,B00CZP9YWS,"Outrageous good made for TV movie.  Michael Douglas and Matt Damon, played the roles better than real life.  Liberace (in real life) was a total druggie and a sad bitter flaming queen.  The real life boytoy in this movie, is a real sleazy gold digg'n (scrap the bottom of the barrel) lowlife.  Matt Damon's pumped up muscled body almost looked unreal in this movie (I am almost thinking it was CGI enchancement).  Rob Lowe's role as the cosmetic surgeon was extremely good and kinda creepy.

5765387,4,B00CZP9YWS,Michael Douglas is surprisingly adept at portraying the character of Liberace.

5765465,5,B00CZP9YWS,Both Michael Douglas and Matt Damon did an excellent job with the acting in this movie; each stepping out of their usual role types.  That took some getting used to.  This is the behind-the-scenes story of Librace's life and quite a life it was.  It was distressing to learn that such an accomplished man used so many people (lots of them much younger boys) and then tossed them aside.  A good movie none the less.,1438992000,,414,4.48
5765466,4,B00CZP9YWS,"Enjoyed this movie. I don't know how close to reality of his life and estate after his death. I do remember much noise about his lover fighting for his due.

5765521,1,B00CZP9YWS,This is no movie for the faint of heart! We are not naive nor intolerant of the lives of LGBT folk. This movies portrayal of Liberace and his entourage was more than we could handle. It was a big turn off to us. Literally a turn off. We never got past the second bedroom saga. This story could have been told with so much more sensitivity without the trappings of human physical behavior. Oh yeah the acting wasn't that convincing either.

Not sure if this film is historically correct or not. It does seem to hold closely to Liberace's ex lover, Scott Thorson's biography; though, how accurate that account is, is another matter. This movie is not for everyone especially the younger generation who have no clue who Liberace was and how nave the public was back in the early 1950s about homosexuality. By today's standard Liberace would be considered a flaming queen but not so back then.",1438819200,,589,4.841584158415841

The performances are compelling and sensitive.  The art direction is gaudy and fun except when it hits you all the glitz is a masquerade.  Debbie Reynolds {as Liberace's much touted Mom) is compelling with only a few moments on screen.  This story needed to be told from an era that is now all but vanished.

5765616,4,B00CZP9YWS,"This is by no means an easy movie.  Starting off with deceptive ease and a sly superficiality, Behind the Candelabra builds, layer upon layer, a rich complex portrait that is less about celebrity, and more about -- perhaps unexpectedly, given all the flash, sparkle, and fur -- fundamental themes of human existence that confront young and old, male and female, gay and straight.  It's about the child's yearning to be accepted and loved, which, often unfulfilled, continues to haunt us as we grow up.  It's about the mystery of sexuality, and the consequences of suppression and guilt over such a fundamental part of the human experience.  It's about growing old and wanting more from life, about the solitary path of making peace within yourself, and about accepting (and, indeed, embracing) our own frailties and shortcomings before we can truly accept and love someone else.  The writing sparkles, with numerous seemingly flip, but deeply revealing lines, including Liberace's unexpected reaction to his mother's death.  There are some solid performances, too, from a strong cast.  If you're looking for a movie that complete's the journey and leaves you uplifted, this isn't it.  It leaves the audience, in part, to hike the considerable distance from where it ends to understanding.  That kind of work is always worthwhile.",1438646400,2,1329,5.172897196261682

As well as the environment people in this type of situation travel in and it was utterly remarkable to see gestures, figures of speech and patterns of behavior remembered from  personal history portrayed with such accuracy that I thought for a moment I was seeing a biopic related to people I had been friends with. This isn't to say I was part of the action, so to speak, but to see the sociological patterns portrayed so clearly was a real eye opener. No, this type of celebrity behavior wasn't confined just to the people I knew, but to a whole generation. primarily those with strong ties to the ""old world"" of Europe and its cultural implications. The generation which remembered WW2 as fresh in their memory. Fascinating. Michael Douglas and Matt Damon give incredible performances. But of course, if you're ""homophobic,"" or ""against the gay lifestyle,"" this movie would prove significantly offensive.

I remember watching Liberace perform as a child and was a fan of his as well.  This film was just unbearable to watch.  The acting was not marginally convincing, the script writing was appalling, the entire film was an embarrassment.  It felt like a script for gay porn toned down enough to play out as a feature film.

5765627,5,B00CZP9YWS,"I did not think it would work.  When this project was announced I was convinced Douglas and Damon would be too old for the roles.  I was way wrong.  The entire project from star to finish was extremely well done.  Damon and Douglas were spot on as Scott Thornton and Liberace.  The story, taken from Thornton account of the relationship is an enlightening look at the toxic effects of the closet on gay relationships in eras gone by.  Liberace worked hard to maintain his mostly older fan base that he was straight.  He felt, and he may have been right that if people knew he was gay, they would desert him.  As a result his relationships were kept secret from the public at large and all but his closely guarded circle.  As a wealthy and powerful entertainer, Liberace lavishly paid for what he wanted, luring conquests with money and dazzling them with his opulent lifestyle and fame.

The film is well made, visually perfect for the era it covers and casting is excellent in every single role.  Debbie Reynolds is unrecognizable as Liberace's mother - very effective.  I did not realize Dan Ackroyd was playing Liberace's lawyer until I read the casting at the end of the film.  Rob Lowe gives a career performance as a plastic surgeon who causes Thornton to get addicted to pain and diet pills.  Every actor was perfect in every role.

While the film does place Thornton in a more sympathetic role, Liberace is treated fairly, a victim of the times and religious bigotry of his upbringing.  As people with unlimited money and power often do, he becomes corrupted by his ability to buy what he wants and follow his own whims and lusts into trouble.  The story is ultimately sad, because they together had the elements that might have kept them happy for a much longer time, and without the sad ending of Liberace's death from AIDS and Thornton's drug addiction and subsequent criminal choices.

Again - an excellent well made film that far exceeded my expectations.",1438473600,,1968,4.688046647230321

Matt Damon was the bomb, never disappoints.  He looked really good too. He looks hotter with the more blonde hair. Lol. And Rob Lowe, omg, I don't know how he did his face so stiff and shiny plastic like, but it was so perfect for a Hollywood plastic surgeon from the  early 1980's. He was funny too. The snoring scene cracked me up. I had to rewind and watch again. Anyway, definitely worth the watch, even if you didn't like Liberace, the movie was a really good watch. And very entertaining.

5765672,2,B00CZP9YWS,"I watched this movie, years after it was first released, to finally see what all the fuss was about. Now that I've seen the expos movie, based on a story by Scott Thorson, Liberace's former lover who is now in a Nevada prison for committing a variety of felonies, I feel I have a bit more insight into gay culture. Although I am straight, I support gay marriage. What consenting adults do in the privacy of their bedrooms should not be the concern of any law enforcement agency. Now that I've gotten that off my chest, I found the movie less than terrific. The story of a wealthy, talented older man and his much-younger, good-looking, ungrateful, untalented, lover/protg has often been told -- in real life and fiction -- usually featuring heterosexual couples. Since Liberace's television debut in the fifties, I always enjoyed his performances. Sadly, this movie did little to burnish the posthumous image of a truly-gifted showman. The notion that Scott Thorson should benefit financially from this expos makes me sad.",1428710400,,1022,4.913294797687861

5765685,2,B00CZP9YWS,"1 or 2 star reviews usually get relegated to the edge of the page on Amazon as they don't sell products. This is a truely dreadful view of Liberace as performer, lover and kitsch celebrity entertainer. The worrying thing is its reactionary feel. In this day and age it feels as if Soderbergh is leading a counter revolution against gayness.

To be precise: I was left with the feeling of the film's contempt for its subject.

This was magnified by Michael Douglas's clumsy and ungraceful assumption of the Liberace role as ""what you got in public was more or less what he was in private"" all showbiz glitz with little depth. A scene with his mother exemplified that approach. His portrayal as a detached shallow ""user"" of people in general I couldn't relate to. But beyond the depiction Douglas (and if this was an attempt to broaden his acting range it failed miserably) was clearly directed to, he never really looked comfortable or in the slightest charismatic in the sense that you wondered what all the fuss was about. Yet tens of thousands regularly paid to see Liberace in his shows, returned to see him, sustained over a a long career when TV was shaping modern culture, with the roots of his ""act"" stretching back into vaudeville. The sheer hard work involved as well as the essential talent and dedication seem to be given only obligatory nods in the screen play being sidelined for a survey of the most superficial kind.

Soderbergh's understanding of what constitutes ""going behind"" amounts to a film with less depth than the gold flock wallpaper in Liberace's boudoir. In fact, that's all it is - a boudoir film with toys and costumes.

I found the Tony Palmer film ""The World of Liberace"", even with its obvious staging and artifices, a far more interesting and revealing look at Liberace.

I do realise the big argument against my view of this little film is that it is based on the personal memoir of Scott Thorsen. Hence the compromises to his objectivity. I had thought also that the Liberace estate, with its ability to call on more lawyers than an average sized African country, might have been responsible for reigning in and constraining. But news is that the 2008 market crash has wiped out a lot of the capital ($75million) that Liberace left to his Charitable Foundation. The museum in Las Vegas has closed too.

Finally OK, the hypocrisy thing, and the passing reference to Rock Hudson. The effort to cover up even the final death sentence of AIDs. We all have our hypocrisies! Get over it!",1425686400,,2516,4.719817767653758
5765686,4,B00CZP9YWS,"This is a film based on the 1988 memoir Behind the Candelabra: My Life with Liberace, by Scott Thornson. Thornson was the young lover of the flamboyant pianist Liberace (a.k.a. as Mr. Showmanship), nearly 40 years his senior. The film (adapted for the screen by Richard LaGravense) chronicles the course of their 6 stormy years together at the height of Liberaces fame as one of the most legendary Vegas performers. The film is directed by Steven Soderbergh who is also credited with Erin Brockovich and Traffic.

Michael Douglas (yes...the MD of Wall Street and Falling Down) is cast as the flamboyant Liberace, who despite maintaining his heterosexuality for the media, has an affinity for young, juicy boys. Scott Thornson is played by Matt Damon, a doe-eyed animal-loving country boy who is introduced to the entertainer by a mutual friend (Scott Bakula). From the start, Liberace is instantly drawn to seventeen-year-old Scott, who tells the entertainer he knows of a remedy that will heal his beloved pet poodle. Once this link is established, it doesnt take long before the men develop a romantic, codependent relationship. Scott moves in with Liberace and quickly becomes accustomed to the entertainers life of excess.

Scott is given the job of chauffeur in Liberaces stage show, a position that has previously been held by several of Liberaces former lovers. Scott enjoys the perks that come along with being the entertainers current love interest. After a passionate night together, Liberace tells Scott he wants to be everything to him: lover, father, friend, brother. The entertainers frankness solidifies Scotts loyalty to his older lover and the two become inseparable, much to the annoyance of Liberaces manager (Dan Ackroyd).

Scott and Liberace live comfortably until Liberace catches a glimpse of himself on a late-night talk show. Convinced he needs plastic surgery, he calls upon his drugged-out surgeon Dr. Startz (Rob Lowe). Liberace proposes Scott undergo surgery as well to look more like him, since he has expressed desire to formally adopt him. After going under the knife, Scott develops an addiction to pain medications and his life sets off on a downward spiral from here. At this point, the relationship between Liberace and Thornson has become strained and their passion parallels that of an old married couple. Liberace expresses the desire he and Scott take a break and see other people. Although Scott agrees, he has an emotional breakdown in the company of his drug dealer. It is not long before Liberace takes interest in another young man and Scott is replaced completely. The torrid relationship culminates in Scotts unsuccessful attempt to sue the entertainer for palimony. Liberace maintains the two men were not lovers, but agrees to settle out of court for $75,000, three dogs and three cars.

This is an excellent film that that gives viewers insight into the life of the legendary showman Liberace, who died in 1987 due to complications related to HIV. The chemistry between Michael Douglas and Matt Damon is entirely convincing and the actors do a fine job portraying flamboyant lovers without going too over the top. This film is a must see for Liberace fans and anyone else interested in non-traditional romances.

**Playing Devils Advocate: Its important to note the film is based on Scott Thornsons side of story and published the year after his ex-lovers death (strategy to avoid any chance of Thornson being sued by Liberace for defamation of character?). As Liberace never publicly admitted his homosexuality, there is no way to really know if everything Scott Thornson detailed in his memoir is written out of truth or colored by the bitterness of a jilted lover. Viewers (especially those with little to no background knowledge of Liberace) may find themselves despising the legendary pianist by the end of the film and weeping tears of compassion for Scott (myself included).",1425513600,,3931,5.1359375

He seemed in pain through most of the flick. It doesn't even deserve to be referred to as a picture. A bad execution of a good idea from beginning to end. I came close to asking for my money back.

5765729,5,B00CZP9YWS,"When I was eleven years old, I played in a concert in Soldiers Field in Chicago with Liberace.  He has always been my idol and was a very very nice man.  I've seen the television movies about his life, and have read the books too.  I used to watch his television program 'Sincerely Yours', back in the 50's.  I've also attended his Las Vegas shows which were spectacular at the Hilton Las Vegas.

All of the negative publicity, and negative media attention this man received was pure persecution.  He was honorable, and generous, and helped many of his students/prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s, as well as funding his foundation for continuing musical education among many other things for years to come.

This DVD movie Behind the Candelabra was very enlightening, and seemed to be truthful from Scot Thorson's perspective of all that has been written or made into movies, concerning Liberace.  It was perfectly understandable why he did as he did, and of course without Liberace being able to defend himself, we are left with little choice but to possibly accept what Scot Thorson says, since he was there, and we were not.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to learn about Liberace, but I would also insist that with that learning, they also review all the other movies that were made about him.  One starred Andrew Robinson as Liberace, and one starred Victor Garber as Liberace.

I saw Liberace in his final performance before he died, and also in his final interview with him, where he did look extremely ill.  Watch all three movies, and judge for yourself.  This DVD was another perspective about Liberace, and was a good movie.",1416787200,4,1643,4.825

5765750,4,B00CZP9YWS,"This is a review about the achievement of Steven Soderbergh and excellent acting from the ensemble cast.

Liberace was a narcissistic and manipulative celebrity who used (and paid) everyone around him to satisfy his own extreme indulgences. Scott Thorson was as much to blame for his own selfish indulgences, though he may be forgiven due to Liberace's promises of success and grandeur.

Who's to blame, here?

BEHIND THE CANDELABRA is based on Thorson's own account of the events, a somewhat sugar-coated narrative of a poor guy trying to find a level of success in a world of deception.

Sexuality aside, this is a story about a relationship founded on manipulation and promises...many promises. Liberace wanted Scott to look like him, convincing him to have plastic surgery. This alone makes me think Thorson was more involved in the relationship than may be thought.

There aren't many things about Thorson that are pretty (besides him) and his big-money foray into drugs is well explored.
Were the drugs the reason why Liberace dumped him? Was Liberace tired of him, looking for ""fresh meat""?

All of these events are well portrayed in BEHIND THE CANDELABRA, as realized by screenwriter Richard LaGravanese, and very well presented by Steven Soderbergh. It's pretty much of a no-holds-barred expose, with two unflinching performances from Michael Douglas and, especially, Matt Damon. Douglas handles the role well, free of too-much caricature but with most of the flamboyance that WAS Liberace. Damon was the best, with a lot more change of attitude and character as the film progressed. Douglas won all the acting awards, but Damon had a tougher (and bigger) role.

There's no nudity, and a lot of reference to gay sex preferences, but at the end, it's the story about a serious relationship that wasn't meant to be. Whose fault? Decide for yourself.

Excellent support from Scott Bakula, Dan Aykroyd, Rob Lowe and (unrecognizable) Debbie Reynolds added to the sincerity of the narrative being presented, and the sets and costumes were all you would expect from a film about the excessive Liberace.

Not for the prudish, I would recommend this film to anyone who thinks they might make it in Hollywood, unscathed.",1412294400,,2219,5.090909090909091

Matt Damon, on the other hand, was playing a part that would have been more appropriate when he was younger and well, how do you say it? Less plump?  I don't know what to say, but his Mother was on the set, so it probably was a sign for him not to get too personal.  I mean, actors are influenced by their Mothers too and she was definitely saying, ""Matt, I don't approve of this"" and trying to keep her son earning the big bucks that only straight actors can do. He already did a great job in Mr. Ripley, with Jude Law and was reviewed as ""too good"" so it was time to blow this one for his image as a straight guy. We will never know if the rumors are true about him, but I suspect he has a side of him that fits the part without a lot of coaching and Mommy knows about it too. As much as Michael Douglas was a surprise, so was Matt, but not a good surprise. We will really never know why, will we??",1409011200,,1135,4.0311111111111115

5765783,5,B00CZP9YWS,"Behind the Candelabra  entertains and shines due to the brilliance of Michael Douglas ( as only he could have enacted this role) as Liberace and he is occasionally matched by his on screen lover Matt Damon- in a radical departure from his regular roles.
The movie could have been a cheap, drab affair but thankfully these two stars liven up the movie and give us an insight about the world of Liberace.
The movie is based on the book by Scott Thurston played by Matt Damon and his transition from shy closet homosexual to becoming initially the driver and shortly after the lover of Liberace. Candelabra mostly centers on their five year long affair. As Thurston finally gets replaced by an even younger lover.
These lovers are inseparable in the beginning but are eventually ruined by drugs, pornography and Liberace's fixation with plastic surgery. Rob Lowe is hideously scary as the plastic surgeon.
HBO as usual brings very sophisticated visuals and production values but the theme is  that love in its first stages is almost worth giving up your life for but all great relationships wither away when fame and drugs are added to it.
Candelabra also has some amazing music in it and the credit goes to Marvin Hamlisch (who died during filming)
I enjoyed the movie despite the fact  I was not aware of Liberace the man or his music but the lead actors  played a big role in increasing the like factor.",1406160000,,1403,4.714285714285714

I still have the utmost respect for Lee as he was referred in the movie; however, can appreciate Scott's delimma throughout this part of his life.",1403136000,2,435,4.589743589743589
5765797,2,B00CZP9YWS,"Michael Douglas acts--and acts some more--going through lots of hoops to play the Liberace of Scott Thorson's tell-all tale of a jilted, embittered lover.  But in the end the film falls way short of capturing the charm, the allure, the ""campy fun"" of the entertainer-phenomenon that was Liberace--whose games we were ""on to"" yet participated in.  We winked at him because we knew he'd wink right back at us--and with a special twinkle in his eye unmatched by any other performer.

Long before Scott Thorson and Las Vegas, Walter Liberace (from Waukesha, WIs.) demonstrated precocious piano chops and exuded an androgynous charm in American households through his weekly television show.  I know that he inspired many mothers (like mine) to take their sons (including this one) to hear him give concerts in ordinary Mid-Western towns like Rockford, Illinois.  His one movie, an innocuous black and white film entitled  ""Sincerely Yours,"" was merely an opportunity to see on the big screen the persona we had witnessed on our tiny Westinghouse TV screens: he had a medium build and a broad face that had a smile that seemed to stretch from one ear to the next, remaining indelibly in place as he spoke.  His voice was all warmth and richness, resonating with the sunny, ingratiating disposition of his on-stage persona.  His ceaseless good humor completed the picture of the ""real Liberace""--a well-mannered, good-looking, playful but talented and charismatic entertainer who could be ""outrageous"" but never ""shocking.""

In addition to all of the foregoing Liberace projected a child's innocence and sense of wonder along with a sense of belief in his outsized imagination that enabled us to believe in him.  Regardless of what he wore or did on stage, Liberace managed to fill the sartorial excess and take us along on his aerial flights of fancy.  His ""swan song,"" a marathon 18-shows before family crowds at Radio City Music Hall, was in many respects a more fitting venue for Lee than the casinos of Vegas.

A key to the shortcoming of ""Behind the Candelabra"" is the film's final scene--a vision that Matt Damon's Thorson has of a faux-beatific Liberace at the literal height of his glory (as he is lifted skyward by invisible wires). Even at this moment of apotheosis, the Liberace we see, as played by Douglas, is a slightly creepy and pathetic showboat awkwardly outfitted as a drag queen, devoid of personal charm and childish playfulness.  But if we can't sense what it was about Liberace that ""seduced"" all of America (let alone Las Vegas), all we're left with is a mean-spirited  ""Daddy Dearest"" portrait and a blatant morality tale about a young man mistaking wealth and celebrity for love--and paying the price. (Sorry--been there, done that.)

The film is sensationalistic, sordid, and not a little grotesque..  So no doubt it was sufficiently entertaining to help boost the ratings at HBO.  On the other hand, it certainly muddies the memory of Liberace.  How about a little more respect for this American ""original"" who helped make Las Vegas what it is today and proved a boost to the piano industry (which, after a brief resurgence, is once again in the doldrums--replaced by all-purpose electric ""keyboards,"" some of which can be programmed to play the boogie-woogie pattern that impressed Damon's character on his first attendance at a Liberace performance).",1402790400,,3375,5.039568345323741

5765799,5,B00CZP9YWS,"There was a good deal of publicity about this film, but not being an HBO subscriber prevented me from seeing it until now that Amazon makes it available to the general audience. As most would know, the main character of the film, Liberace, in real life was an important entertainer of his time. His talent was matched only by his over-the-top choreography. As a child, I remember his multiple television appearances in prime time programming and how the adults around me marveled at his exuberance and showmanship, pretty much a precursor to the acts of Madonna and Lady Gaga today, attention-seekers marketing their talent mostly to roll in cash with intensity and a great deal of care. How Mr. Liberace was able to hide his sexual preference from the viewing public is a testament to the era's taboos on sexuality and the absence of modern-day tabloid newspapers. The film captures an aspect of the individual only the truly intimate knew. The film may well be a director's presentation of his own interpretation of the largely one-sided biographical account, but it presents a credible account of the situation. Furthermore, everything about the film is outstanding and worthy of notice, but Michael Douglas' and Matt Damon's acting are worthy of recognition. Their performance was truly excellent.

5765801,5,B00CZP9YWS,"I really enjoyed both lead actors they captured the characters and the period and the lifestyle. I grew up in that era and remember Liberace and how my gay brothers used to laugh at him pretending to be straight to protect his career. This movie really delved into the culture of that time and the sexual politics whether that be straight or gay and how certain proclivities were accepted because of the sexual politics of the time.

I actually do not think Hollywood has changed much though -there is still a huge suppression of people's lifestyles to protect their perceived fabricated career and also abuse of power by studios and producers. This production perfectly captured the excesses of Liberace's lifestyle, his humor, kindness and humanity as well as his selfishness and abuse of power. It was an outstanding performance by both Michael Douglas and Matt Damon and gives you a real insight into that time.

The attention to detail for the sets, costumes and time period really do take you into this world and his life, don't expect to just be entertained it is a great film but digs in deep and leaves you feeling the ultimate loneliness of the characters.",1401580800,2,1166,4.796019900497512

Originally shown on HBO-Home Box Office. Contains male nudity.
  Directed by Steven Soderbergh. Written by Richard LaGravenese, Scott Thorson and Alex Thorleifson.

Liberace (Wladziu Valentino Liberace) was born in Wisconsin. He was a perfect pianist who made himself a career traveling with his custom-made piano and entertaining audiences with his music.
  The first movie he was in, South Sea Sinner (1950), he was in the role of ""Maestro"", a honky-tonk pianist.  This gave him the national recognition he needed.
 He got his own television series, The Liberace Show (1952-69) on KLAC 13 Los Angeles (KCOP 13). He also performed at Madison Square Gardens and began his flamboyant expensive costumes, brocaded with diamonds and jewelry. His shows were classy and elegant.
  Elvis Presley would later take a nod from Liberace, by wearing expensive capes for his stage shows.
  In 1955, Liberace's second film was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sincerely-Yours/dp/B00CS9NI1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sincerely Yours</a>&nbsp;(1955). It was a good performance.
  Liberace made brief cameo appearances in two more films,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-The-Boys-Meet-The-Girls-Remastered/dp/B005EXA88C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When The Boys Meet The Girls  Remastered)</a>&nbsp;(1965) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Loved-One-1965/dp/B00EOBB7YY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Loved One (1965)</a>.
  He also appeared in two episodes of ""Batman"" (ABC) in 1966, four appearances on Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In during season 2 in 1968-69 and an episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Here-s-Lucy-Season-2/dp/B002M9WW6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Here's Lucy: Season 2</a>, episode 16, broadcast January 5, 1970.
  Liberace was a delightful man and always polite. He loved to play to an audience, but in the 1980's, he had heart disease and emphysema from smoking. In 1986, he found out he had AIDS.
  Wanting to die with dignity, he kept this secret from the public and he never revealed publicly that he was gay.
  Rock Hudson died from AIDS, October 2, 1985.
Liberace's last television performance was on The Oprah Winfrey Show, broadcast December 25, 1986. He had lost weight and was ill, but continued to perform the best he could.
  Six weeks later, Liberace passed away, February 4, 1987 at the age of 67.
  You never heard a bad word about Liberace. He was a showman. There will never be a man in show business like Liberace again.

5765805,4,B00CZP9YWS,"When I heard that there was a film around starring Michael Douglas as Liberace I sort of rolled my eyes and decided that this is one I'd pass on.

Fast forward a couple of years and when I saw the DVD on the shelf at the public library I decide to take it along with some ""more serious"" films.  I wasn't sure that I'd even bother to play it.  I was shocked to see Matt Damon's face on the cover, but I just rolled my eyes some more.  If I had bothered to notice that the film was directed by Steven Soderberg I would have realized that this was something well worth watching.

And it was.  As other reviewers have mentioned the film is based on a book by Scott Thorson, one of Liberace's lovers, (some say his favorite) and it covers the four or five years of their relationship.  Scott was just a teenager when he met ""Lee"" and Lee was in his fifties.  It is told from Thorson's point of view and some object that the ""truth"" is thereby not served.  I don't know; who can say for sure?  In a way the film is so good that it almost doesn't matter how absolutely ""true"" it is; it seems almost to transcend mere facts and offer a very deeply moving story about two people.

The performances are truly stellar.  Besides Douglas' rendition of the over-the-top performer with a vulnerable side, Matt Damon was truly impressive in the role of Thorson.  I think it might have been a more difficult role to pull off and he did a  splendid job.  All of the supporting cast was first rate.  I loved Rob Lowe's creepy plastic surgeon and Debbie Reynolds was adorable as Liberace's mom.  (Is Debbie ever less than adorable?!  I'd love to see a bio-pic of her!)

Special mention must be given to the sexual material.  Soderberg handled this so well!  It could have been an absolute mess in lesser hands but he presented it just right. Obviously  gay love is at the heart of the story and he doesn't skirt the issue but it's never objectionable, at least to my eyes.  Again, special recognition must be given to Douglas and Damon for their courage and professionalism in their perfomances..

This is not a comedy but there are certainly some wonderfully humorous aspects.  Matt Damon's costumes as he got more an more into his role as L's boy-friend are really funny.  Of course there are shots of Liberace's amazing costumes and beyond-elaborate homes.  I knew the guy was outrageous but never realized the full extent of it.

I think this is a very thoughtful film that gets beyond the surface tabloid aspects of what could have been seen as a sordid relationship and lays bare a whole range of human experience.  I give it four and a half stars..

5765806,5,B00CZP9YWS,Michael Douglas is incredible!!! Plus Liberace is from Wisconsin so really fun to learn more about him since I am from Wisconsin. Matt Damon is great too. Great story and super acting.,1399939200,,184,4.78125
5765807,4,B00CZP9YWS,"Liberace was part of my growing up in that we watched Liberace on tv and my mother used to play boogie-woogie on the piano. It was fascinating to learn ""the rest"" about Liberace. Good movie, good acting, and who can't love Matt Damon under any circumstances?",1399852800,2,258,4.630434782608695
5765808,5,B00CZP9YWS,"I first met Liberace at his home in the Hollywood Hills. I had parked to much in his driveway and was attending a cocktail party across
the street at the home of Susie Durant. I was a drama student at the Pasadena Playhouse College of Theatre Arts. Lee was just wonderful and he thanked me after I returned from moving my car. The year was 1958. The draft got me in 1959 and he told me to write him at his Kings Way address. We always stayed in touch. I managed movie theaters in the Middle East and was a lecturer for the DOD and based in London. We got together again in 1964. DOD paid for my doctorate in psychology and I also worked in the travel industry. I made the effort to see Liberace at least 10 times a year or so until his death in 1987. I never met Scott, however a friend had after the fact and did not care for him at all. I was living and working in Hawaii when he passed. I had talked with his manager, Seymour Heller a number of times. He was the kindest man I ever knew. Did I know he was gay? Yes and no. The subject never came up. I was on stage 16,950 times. He, many, many more. We shared one thing: ""We knew what the audience wanted and we gave it to them."" Both of our personas off stage were completely different. I still miss him so very much and the movie was just fantastic. Buy it immediately and watch two of the best actors in the industry make gay love quite worthy of respect. When Michael Douglas won the Emmy for best actor (playing Liberace), he
told Matt Damon (in the audience), ""You know half of this is yours? What part do you want, the top or the bottom? -- Matt Damon, 'The TOP'. Douglas replied back, 'You ALWAYS wanted the top.'"" HBO edited out the remarks. I will end in my role as a Doctor of Psychology. The alternative lifestyle is completely normal. Does going to bed with a member of the same sex mean you are gay? Absolutely not. Period. It's called experimentation. It happens in your teens, mid 20's, and if you marry, around age 38. To be properly called a homosexual you must at least spend one solid year with someone of the same sex. We are just now coming out of the Queen Victoria era. Prior to Queen Victoria, men had man servants. They were good to their wife and children. However ever week or so they would ask a man servant to spend some time with them down by the lake. Their time together was glorious. Never, ever, feel guilty about yourself. Use protection, Lee did not. But, always remember: This is not a rehearsal. It is better to shoot for the stars and miss, then aim for the gutter and hit it. Buy the movie. One of the best ever made.",1399161600,,2611,4.182539682539683
5765809,5,B00CZP9YWS,"A very interesting story. Both Micheal Douglas and Matt Damon did a superb job portraying Liberace and His young lover.  Even Rob Lowe did a good job and played the Dr. to the Hilt and made it seem real and as baizarre as possible as the Plastic surgeon.  Dan Ackroid made it believable ""not funny"" and can play serious roles like that very well, ( I almost didn't recognize him ?)  I found them all to be very believable and it made me wish I had purchased it new or rented a good one, because mine was worn so thin I could  barely see the any fine detail in the makeup and clothing and performances and costumes. do not buy a rental that should've gone to the trash but was sold instead as being viewable.for far more than a used video movie. There are some scenes however short that are so personal that you wish they'd left them out, but then you wouldn't have the same that are always shown in other movies today, and therefore it really makes it real.  I can just imagine Micheal Douglas and Matt D
amo discussing the fact of what the hell, if we're going to do this we're going to do this right, and then bringing the viewing audience an incredible portrayal of that relationship really was, which was that it was real and poigiant at times and funny, and ad, so sad, because it was, a real love for them both and in the end, that was established and then you consider the facts and what a sad thing it was , the reason for their separating.  I loved it, actually after I got over the 1st time I saW it and played it again, and I will be looking for it in a new like condition to see what I missed.  I hope I did not reveal it all or too much and disappoint you for this one. You should just watch the movie without allowing yourself to be skeptical, or getting your hopes up.  Its a personal story, and private to most of the public, so give yourself a gift and see this one.  They got those awards because they were well deserved!

Okay, Michael Douglas and Matt Damon are wonderful in it, the script is very good, the direction too, but still... The french (always the french!) have a definition of film that, to my knowledge can still be applied today: LE CINEMA DU REGARD (THE CINEMA OF THE EYE - meaning one look, one camera, one point of view, one Author). Yes, I know that lots and lots of Hollywood films nowadays are very bad, that cable tv movies are each time better, that tv sets are bigger and bigger, but there is a kind of magic in real cinema that even the best of movies made for tv can't reach. I liked BEHIND THE CANDELABRA very much but only as a television movie and that's it. And here I rest my case.",1396569600,,1106,4.271428571428571
5765826,4,B00CZP9YWS,"I rented ""Behind the Candelabra"" with a lot of reservations. Specifically, I thought the story would be excessively embellished and I wasn't sure Michael Douglas could play Liberace realistically.

 Happy to report I was wrong on all counts!

 This is an excellent film--the story is engrossing! It's based off of Scott Thorson's memoir detailing his relationship with Liberace and I think the movie is quite faithful to his account. Douglas gives an outstanding performance as Liberace and Matt Damon is also stellar (despite the fact he's a 43 year old man playing someone 25 years younger.) ""Behind the Candelabra"" is essentially a tragic love story about two lonely individuals each trying to gain fulfillment from the other. Liberace has fame and fortune but no intimacy and Thorson is a young kid looking for both a father figure and a lover. A very nice arrangement that works for awhile but ultimately falls apart as the ending gets ugly! The movie does not pull punches regarding Liberace's kinky promiscuity and Thorson's drug use--two critical issues that lead to the eventual breakup.

 Ultimately, ""Behind the Candelabra"" is a fascinating story with excellent performances not only from the two leads but also the supporting cast. (Especially Rob Lowe playing the creepy plastic surgeon who operates on Liberace and Thorson). I have only 2 criticisms to point out. The first would be that the film could have included more of Liberace's glitzy stage performances--the lack of performance scenes creates a gap in the story. Performing live was Liberace's passion, yet the movie largely bypasses this essential element.  Secondly, Damon's age neuters the shock value concerning the 40 year plus age difference of these men (when they first met Liberace was 58, Thorson just 17!!) Otherwise it's a very good movie worth checking out.",1396224000,2,1843,5.1644295302013425

They lack depth and are one-dimensional. The movie, however, I find highly entertaining and it's more than worth seeing. The plot is based on Scott Thorson's account of the events. Accordingly, he is the good guy who falls victim to the dangerously wicked traps of the infamous Liberace. I don't buy his version. It leads me to think the movie is ""slightly"" homophobic in that it tries to imply that Liberace's conduct as a gay man was not honorable simply because he was gay, not straight.

5765860,5,B00CZP9YWS,"I really didn't know that Michael Douglas had it in him. He is truly a marvel. But after numerous viewings, its Matt Damon that steals the show! I was so entertained. I had a dinner party and showed it to my guests and we all loved it. It deserved to win the Emmy......and sadly that Matt didn't take one home also!

How Liberace ever fooled anyone that he wasn't a total queen, is beyond me. But sure enough, old ladies from Ohio just thought he was ""an entertainer"".

Despite how sad and pathetic Scott Thorson's life has become, I think ""Behind the Candlelabra"" was an honest, even loving tribute to that old queen's legacy.

Matt Damon though is nothing short of amazing, as is, of course, Michael Douglas. They both just faded into their roles. I've always liked Matt Damon, but, have a new found respect for him. Though Michael Douglas gave an award winning performance, I haven't become the fan that I have of Matt Damon. His portrayal of an increasingly flamboyant man just leaves me speechless. While Michael Douglas immediately embraced the campiness.....it isn't the character study portrayal that Matt Damon's astounding on point evolution into a high camp gay guy.

Noteworthy supporting performances by Debbie Reynolds (another one who fades into her role), Rob Lowe and Dan Akroyd fully rounds out yet another great HBO movie. (I really wished Diana Ross would have pursued HBO for ""The Josephine Baker Story"" because Lynn Whitfield's performance is totally the way I envisioned Diana in that lost dream. My Comcast cable bill is ridiculous because of HBO original programming).

How anyone could give this film 1 star behooves me. And sure, while the love-sex scenes between Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall was a turn on, Michael and Matt's is completely the opposite.....almost nauseating especially when he reveals Liberace's wig line.

Despite the fact that I will never look at these two actors again the same way, their all out efforts to make this real was obvious and accomplished.

read somewhere that many of Liberace's piano's and clothes and other things in the movie were 'really his'  and must have been worth a fortune.

5765892,5,B00CZP9YWS,"Both Matt Damon and Michael Douglas are terrific in the HBO film Behind the Candelabra.  It must also be said that Dan Aykroyd does a great job playing Liberaces business manager who is the person who solves the problems that Liberaces narcissism and libido creates. Rob Lowe does a superb job playing the over the top weird plastic surgeon that not only does an extensive face lift on Liberace but also indulges his almost pathological narcissism by trying to reshape the face of Liberaces young lover, Scott Thorson, to look like a younger Liberace. Debbie Reynolds plays Liberaces Polish over-controlling Roman Catholic mother who is one of the few restraints on her sons egotism. However, Michael Douglas deserves great credit for the outstanding job he does portraying Liberace.  Liberace is such an oversized personality that he may be a very difficult character to portray. It might be easy to watch Douglas play Liberace and think that he is overplaying the role, however Douglas is such a skillful actor that this thought does not enter the mind of the viewer. Instead, I found I was amazed by the force of Liberaces personality and ability to control those around him and Douglas ability to allow this aspect of Liberace to emerge so clearly.

The screenplay by Richard LaGravenese is very engaging and amusing. The film is very gay and many aspects of gay life are integrated into the film in a way that few films display. It took some courage to produce and direct this film. In summary, it is highly entertaining and exceptionally well done.",1390348800,,1554,4.878787878787879
5765893,4,B00CZP9YWS,"First off, the make-up and styling behind this movie is downright phenomenal. Even with the cast list in hand, I couldn't immediately identify the actors involved in some of the roles, especially Michael Douglas as Liberace. And the brilliance ranges from this larger than life depiction of the man but also to strange details like Rob Lowe's ridiculously sculpted face - the victim of years of his own preferences (and of course skills) for plastic surgery.

Couple this with Douglas' amazing performance as the eccentric pianist, and this movie becomes a different kind of spectacle entirely. It's hard to believe that this is the same actor that has played so many gruff, serious characters over the years. And while this movie is also serious, the range of acting demanded by the role certainly goes to show just how impressive Michael Douglas really is. And it didn't feel like he was just some cheap caricature of the man - it felt like an honest attempt to bring the man to life for the purposes of telling this story.

The movie is so richly immersed in the time period. This includes the costumes, the dialog references and the many different hair styles. The level of detail invested in making this movie such an immersive experience for viewers is something that deserves honest praise and respect. They could have cut more corners in terms of how the movie could have been put together.

I'm still not a Matt Damon fan and he wasn't overly impressive in this movie. He wasn't necessarily that bad either, and that still deserves the respect that he is due. One could surely see the effort he also put into the role in the hopes of making a respectable portrayal of Scott, although at times young naivety felt a bit more like inadvertently emotionless acting.

Behind the Candelabra is a bold, surprisingly good movie. It's a hard story to tell and they made an admirable effort of telling in a way that was true to Liberace and yet also open to the prospects of his homosexuality being more than just a rumor.",1390176000,,2021,4.71671388101983

5765896,2,B00CZP9YWS,"This version of Liberace's life is definitely more explicit than the 1988 version starring Victor Garber, and is not so much about Liberace's career as it is about Liberace's relationship with Scott Thorson.  Michael Douglas plays LIberace, and does a good job of faking the piano performances, but I don't think he was the best choice to play Liberace. He didn't have the mannerisms down, nor the timbre and inflection of Lee's distinct voice. In addition, I understand the life style that Liberace lead, but the movie's presentation seemed a little gratuitous at times and a few scenes were TMI (too much information).  To me, it seemed the telling of LIberace's story was distracted with the more salacious and sultry scenes between Douglas and Damon.

5765899,4,B00CZP9YWS,"Stephen Soderbergh's BEHIND THE CANDELABRA (TV-2013) stars Michael Douglas as Liberace and Matt Damon as Scott Thorsen, his companion and  lover from 1977 to '81. Also with Scott Bakula, Dan Aykroyd, Rob Lowe, Paul Reiser and Debbie Reynolds (looking ancient as Liberace's mom).

It had to be a tough film for Douglas and Damon for they are all over each other, not just with long kisses but caresses and other intimate bedroom behavior. At some point you forget you're watching two men and see them only as a deeply committed couple.

This HBO movie based on Thorson's memoirs was a challenging project for all involved. The recreation of Liberace's glamorous stage act and excessive personal life seems true, and Thorsen isn't spared the depiction of his own weaknesses, drug dependency chief among them.

Wladziu Liberace was a child prodigy who came to prominence in an era when gays were deeply closeted. He remained publicly in denial all his life. In a two decade span Lee was the highest paid entertainer in the world, which allowed for a personal extravagance that would be the envy of any royal. Considering the man's voracious sexual appetite and need for variety, that he lived to age 67, finally succumbing to AIDS complications in 1987, seems in hindsight a miracle.

Like any biopic, ""Candelabra"" tinkers with the facts, but not terribly so. Its biggest flaw is in casting 43-year-old Matt Damon to portray Thorsen, who was only 17 when he got involved with Lee and 21 when they split. As for Michael Douglas, he looks marvelous as the human peacock this brilliant pianist was. The makeup, wigs and outlandish costuming take a decade or two off him. You can sense Douglas is having the time of his life with this role.

How much you want to know about Liberace's private life may determine if BEHIND THE CANDELABRA is a film you'd care to see. There's definitely off-putting moments, and some that could negatively affect your memories of him, but if the so-called ""lifestyles of the rich and famous"" is a passion, then you won't be disappointed with the story told here.",1389744000,3,2086,4.845505617977528

Considering the man's voracious sexual appetite and need for variety, that he lived to age 67, finally succumbing to AIDS complications in 1987, seems in hindsight a miracle.

Like any biopic, ""Candelabra"" tinkers with the facts, but not terribly so. Its biggest flaw is in casting 43-year-old Matt Damon to portray Thorsen, who was only 17 when he got involved with Lee and 21 when they split. As for Michael Douglas, he looks marvelous as the human peacock this brilliant pianist was. The makeup, wigs and outlandish costuming take a decade or two off him. You can sense Douglas is having the time of his life with this role.

How much you want to know about Liberace's private life may determine if BEHIND THE CANDELABRA is a film you'd care to see. There's definitely off-putting moments, and some that could negatively affect your memories of him, but if the so-called ""lifestyles of the rich and famous"" is a passion, then you won't be disappointed with the story told here.",1389744000,2,2086,4.845505617977528

book.  I read the book a while back, and this film is faithful to that book as I remember it.  I
don't think the performances of the leads could be bettered.  Scott admitted in the book that
he himself was becoming hard to handle after being hooked on drugs, and this film does
address that.  Liberace may have closed the door on Scott a bit soon, but his running out

5765910,5,B00CZP9YWS,"The movie played very well. Clean, clear, crisp picture, and sound, was great. Enjoyed the movie, not sure what people were so worked up about. That is real life, big deal they showed two men being intimate, this was far from light porn, as some people viewed it. (Again, they are entitled to their opinion). I believe some people were being melodramatic in their reviews, that is putting it mildly. This is 2014 not the dark ages, however they will forever show violent movies and that is accepted. I like Micheal Douglas, and yes it was a different role for him.  I believe that he did as well as he could. That was a challenge, if you want to look at him as Liberace you can, or if you want to look him as only Micheal Douglas you can, one only sees what they want to see. I saw him as Liberace, as I was focusing on the movie. That is correct this movie did not focus much on his professional life but his personal life, that the was purpose of the movie taken from Scott's perspective. Yes, it would nice to hear two sides, but that will not happen, I would like to now get the book, since I have seen the movie, even though I did watch Liberace, my grandmother did.

  The other actor Matt Dameon he did a job well done, although I have not watched many things he did. Rob Lowe, surprised me in looks in the part of the doctor, he looks better clean cut. I'm surprised that he had that small of a role. Since he carried full movies as a lead actor before. It's to bad that many people have to mask what they truly are, because it's threat to them, and has no bearing on what they are doing in public, and they not hurting anybody.  Going backs sexually explicit movies have always been a taboo, but violent movies are accepted, as I said. They are rated R and the sexually explicit movies were always rated X. They are or were always played in a separate movie house. I do not go to the movie house so I know the set up. I watch everything on DVD. So society, helped with that. Personally, I do not like writing reviews, because some people get so vile, and they attack people and issues, instead of the product, as everybody as a right to their own opinion.

5765920,4,B00CZP9YWS,"Michael Douglas playing Liberace, the lover?  Can't be done, I thought as I began watching this for the first time.  Matt Damon as the lover?  Matt Damon can do anything, I also thought, looking forward more to his performance than Douglas's.

I was wrong.  Michael Douglas does a stunning, realistic job of his role of Liberace.  Some say he talked too nasally, but if you look at a clip of the real Liberace, Liberace did talk that way.  Douglas was miles away from his usual high-class corporate roles, and he was brilliant.

The sex scenes and situations were far too much for children. But they were necessary for the film. If held back, viewers would not quite realize what their relationship really was and make it difficult to understand their roles.

Matt Damon was okay as Scott, Liberace's lover who was suddenly ousted out of ""Lee""s life. But the role was almost a throw-away role. It was one anyone could play, and it is suprising Damon took on this rather weak and uninteresting part. It did give the movie star power, tho.

Debbie Reynolds is fabulous as ""Lee""s (Liberace's) mother!  I didn't know it was her until I had watched it several times and then read it online.  She was one of Lee's friends in real life.

Another low-key throw-away role that anyone could have played, Liberace's agent, was surprisingly done by Dan Ackroyd. A top favorite as is Damon, I was surprised Ackroyd took this role.  I thought he was some unknown actor, until I read somewhere that it was Ackroyd. Well, in any role, it is good to see him and Matt Damon perform. They did both perform well, for the parts they were given.

This is the first time I've seen a glance into Liberace's real life, and I enjoyed it.  The costumes, the story, the script - and the performances!  It looked like M Douglas was really playing the piano as Liberace.

I think this film was a surprise hit, and HBO deserves the ""What Guts!"" Award for taking a chance on it.  After this, I would not be surprised to see Michael Douglas take on any role - and succeed.",1388448000,,2039,4.536986301369863

Played Copyright warning, then HBO Logo, then clip advert for HBO movies, and finally reached the Movie Menu for ""BEHIND THE CANDELABRA.""

I used the remote to click on PLAY in the Movie Menu, and the disc crashed my player (My player is completely up-to-date on all the Oppo firmware updates), The entire player froze, and I got a black screen for 5-10 minutes.

I removed the disc, then tried five more times, without getting the movie.

I then took the disc to another Oppo BD player, with the same results, and finally to an more recent Oppo Player. I played fine on other Oppo models, but will NEVER work on 83 series players. The Java Software code used by HBO on this disc locks up any of the older generation Oppo BluRay players, I was told by an Oppo engineer. If you own an Oppo BDP 83 series player, THIS DISC WILL NOT WORK WITH YOUR PLAYER. There is another HBO issued BluRay disc that also locks up these particular players. HBO does not care and will not give customer support. Oppo, I was told, tried to talk to HBO engineers about their Java code and got no help from them.

5765955,1,B00CZP9YWS,"I am totally mystified by this movie.  Why would an all star cast and production company produce a movie like this?

Liberace was an exceptional musician and one of the giants of the entertainment industry.  He was a true pioneer and innovator.  He taught the world how to truly entertain people.  The glitz was an important part of the show.  No one before him had ever entertained in such a flamboyant manner.  He raised the bar for all types of entertainers.

None of that came out in this movie.  The only message conveyed was that he was emotional unstable and sexually promiscuous.  The explicit love scenes and partial nudity added nothing to the story.  I am a fan of all the great actors in this movie and generally agree with the social agendas that they have publicly supported.  This seems out of character for all of them.  It totally lacked class.  I am unable to find any redeeming value here.

Though the acting was great, Michael Douglas was still Michael Douglas.  The tone and cadence of his voice as well as his facial expressions prevented me from seeing anyone but Michael.

If this was an attempt to support gay rights, it was a miserable failure.  The fact that he was gay was only a detail.

If you want to know anything about Liberace, I would suggest the 1988 movie, Liberace: Behind the Music.  Victor Garber does an outstanding job of portraying the compassion, joy, and humor that was always evident in Liberace's performance.

5765958,4,B00CZP9YWS,"I've never thought of Michael Douglas as much of an actor. Douglas and Harrison Ford rely on a deadpan delivery that may be appealing to some but is more vaudeville then serious acting.  Actually they are more like character actors because they never change.

However, Michael ""is"" Liberace when he sits down at the piano and  starts playing ""Begin the Beguine"". This is how I remember Liberace when my grandmother and I watched his tv show on our 21-inch B & W in the 50's.  ""Grandmother"" (who also played piano in church) loved herself some Liberace while dissing Clara Ward for being sacrilegious just because she whooped and hollered and jumped all over the stage while singing gospel.

Pianist Randy Kerber brings tears to my eyes when he dubs ""Begin the Beguine"" because it is incredibly beautiful, uplifting, and much too short. Michael Douglas and Liberace are a perfect fit.",1384732800,,883,4.86

5765961,4,B00CZP9YWS,"Totally entertaining, and the leading men are fantastic and have great chemistry together. Matt Damon is physically and emotionally gorgeous. I missed seeing Michael Douglas carry a movie, and in this he is a power house. Scott Bakula, Dan Akroyd, and Rob Lowe deliver big time as well. Rob Lowe's character is hilarious. You do feel the heart break of Scott Thurston and the frustration he must have gone through, as it seems that Liberace dispenses with his relationships like some people dispense with their outdated laptops, minus the attorney. Ouch! Crazy this was not a movie house film, as the production value is terrific. Artful direction. Kudos to HBO for doing it. For me, the added bonus was the Pretty Perky Peggy King clip of her singing ""When Liberace Winks At Me."" Her daughter was my best friend growing up, and I remember her telling me about that song which was a big hit. Peggy King is alive and well with fabulous singing chops and performing in Philly.",1384646400,,974,4.769230769230769

5765963,5,B00CZP9YWS,"I give it 5 stars simply because it was so well done in every respect. All the acting was remarkable. The detailing of the production was painstaking and almost loving. Unfortunately, our human nature is ghoulish in that we must always dig people up after they're gone and pick them apart, just to be sure they had feet of clay like the rest of us. Although if Liberace had been straight, this disinterment would not have occurred and this movie would never have been made; it would have been boring. I am sorry Liberace will not be remembered for his musicality, his ingenuity, even his thrift, and for the hard working American success story he really was. I have worked in music and the piano business for over 40 years. My compatriots and I regret there is no longer a Liberace to popularize piano ownership and piano playing.",1384473600,4,830,4.614864864864865

5765970,1,B00CZP9YWS,What a disservice to an entertainer that was the worlds greatest.  His private life was his own.  Why do movie makers  have to put out such films.  The actors should be embarrased that they took such roles to dishonor Liberace. One can see it is for the money.  I guess the book-writer just can't be satisfied with what was given to him.  He could have walked away anytime but didn't.  One can say his rap sheet says it all.,1383955200,7,424,4.291139240506329

5765972,5,B00CZP9YWS,"This was an excellent and entertaining movie.  Before this, I didn't know anything about Liberace except that he was a piano player.  I remember seeing his posters all over Vegas promoting the Liberace Museum.  It was before my time and not the kind of music I listen to or followed.  I remember thinking he looked or seemed unusual when I'd see pictures around in the media growing up.  Other than that, I knew nothing about him.  This movie paints an interesting portrait of his personal life which is that he was gay and did not hide that fact except professionally and to the world.  In a sense, I wonder if he was portrayed in the greatest light.  The movie focuses mostly on his long term turbulent love affair with a much younger guy.  He courts him in the same way older men with money court younger women.  Although, he and this guy do have a connection that lasts indefinitely.  What made this movie entertaining and so good were really the performances by Michael Douglas and Matt Damon.  They were both incredible and assumed these two people that you couldn't help but be mesmerized.  This Liberace guy was a very interesting and odd person.  Definitely worth seeing if you're open minded.",1383609600,6,1202,4.661904761904762

If you're a devout Liberace fan, don't watch this movie.  Keep your illusions that Liberace purposely set out to create for his fans-- a flamboyant man with an extrodinary gift and don't let you mothers or grandmothers watch this film - some secrets are best kept secret.  I was totally surprised by the candor of this film, e.g., how early movie stars or public figures went to great lengths to enhance themselves, like Marilyn Menroe's plastic surgery revelation.  Liberace was also into plastic surgery and enhancements during his later years. I knew some older male stars went to great lengths, before Viagra, to show themselves as verile.  I can honestly say, my jaw dropped a couple of times in disbelief during this movie at some of the revelations about Liberace; some moments were truly laughable.  Matt Damon's performance as Scott Thorson, (Damon's personal persona), isn't diminished by this role.  In fact, there is an almost like innocense in Damon's performace as Liberace comes to reveal himself to the young Scott Thorson.  You feel the trust between the two, but I didn't get what was loving between the two. Librace was a user of young men.  Behind the Candelabra will probably become a cult film for Liberace.

5766014,5,B00CZP9YWS,"Let's remain short on this one.

Liberace is a myth in show biz. A gay piano performer who all his life hid his orientation under a fake heterosexual liaison that had no real material density at all. All his life he ran after younger twinks to feel his youth back again, with a few implants. That was before the blue pill of Viagra. But one day he tried a new one who was probably slightly better than the others, more special. Description from the urban Dictionary: ""An attractive, boyish-looking, young gay man. The stereotypical twink is 18-22, slender with little or no body hair, often blonde, dresses in club wear even at 10:00 AM, and is not particularly intelligent. A twink is the gay answer to the blonde bimbo cheerleader.""That Scott accepted to have his face reshaped into a semblance of Liberace's. He accepted all kinds of crazy sex but he refused to be taken from behind, some old fear of the dark I guess, since he was let's say an orphan who had been raised in foster care and who found the perfect foster family to support him. In other words he was not ""a blonde bimbo cheerleader. 3

He was attracted by the light, the gold, the gems and jewels, the white uniform though it looked more like a sentimental sweet Halloween costume to impress old ladies, or old queens, white fur coat included. He resisted nothing except that visitor at the back entrance. Pathetic! I guess then Liberace was impressed and as long as the resistance was active he went on trying. He even tried to compensate the frustration by trying to adopt Scott as his proper son, or was it a con from a con-artist? But that kind of theatrical sublimation did not work at all. So time had come to get rid of the gnat. And Liberace did in one swat.

Till death them parted! And just before that sad AIDS moment he called Scott to come and take his last words, watch his last tears, shed some crocodile tears out of confusion and frustration. We are not told what the will gave him.

The film ends up with the cardiac arrest caused by a heart failure, turned into the sequels of the AIDS virus by some coroner's office.

The film tries to end the show, that must go on anyway, with a love song, in fact a long poem recited by Liberace to his own piano music and that song is a marvelous love song indeed, the love song of an older man to a younger man - though it could be to a younger woman all the same. The age difference that Liberace could not deal with made him over sexual whereas there comes an age when a man can love with love and not lust with sex. Liberace never found that epiphany that would have redeemed him from total fright in front of his own age. It is so good to love someone who is younger, a lot younger than you even, just for the love of him or her, for the heat and the emotion you feel in your heart that is not invaded by some hormonal and endocrinal greed.

There comes an age when the wolf in man can finally go to sleep and let the platonic emotions of the loving phoenix come out of the shadow of the receding night that will bring the illumination of the last call. To be reborn instantly from its own empathetic ashes. To be reborn instantly in the lasting memory of the loved one's responsive soul.

A beautiful film about a time when love was not accepted in the narrow circles of the straight fundamentalism of fairy bashing.

But let me give you the final sentimental, slightly over sugary love song that sounds like a Hallmark Valentine's.

Why do I love you?
I love you not only for what you are,
But for what I am when I'm with you
I love you not only for what you have made of yourself,
But for what you are making of me.
I love you for ignoring the possibilities of the fool in me,
And for accepting the possibilities of the good in me.
Why do I love you?
I love you for closing your eyes to the discords in me,
And for adding to the music in me by worshipful listening.
I love you for helping me to construct of my life
Not a tavern but a temple
I love you because you have done so much to make me happy.
You have done it without a word, without a touch, without a sign
You have done it by just being yourself
Perhaps after all, that is what love means
And that is why I love you.

5766017,5,B00CZP9YWS,"michael doughlas always played alpha males in his films who were solidly heterosexual. you pictured him shooting someone or bankrupting them, not floating over to the piano to play or floating over the stage in feathers and furs.  you also did not picture him having an affair with the also solidly heterosexual matt damon.  well, that's what these two actors did in this film and it is hard to picture anyone doing it better.  douglas becomes liberace and damon becomes his much younger lover, one is a countless series of young studs. liberace paid dearly for this of course because his promiscuity led to his contracting HIV and then AIDS.  he died of AIDS back when everyone who had it died of it.

douglas manages to catch every nuance of liberace's character.  he could be charm itself with both his audience and a new young lover he spotted on the horizon. he could also be pathetic as when he tries to hold onto any semblance of his youth via wigs, costumes, makeup and plastic surgery. he can also be a monster which occurs whenever he turns on someone who thwarts him in any way.  when he is ready to jettison a lover, he is cruelty itself. he even captures what works on stage and that is that he presented himself well to his largely female audience, charmed them, entertained them with his piano playing and costumes, just as if her were visiting in their living rooms back home.  i doubt anyone who was in this solidly middle class, middle aged female audience could have handled learning he was gay. they all believed in his ""saga"" which was he missed out on marrying the love of his life, sonja henje, the ice skater actress, and never was able to fall in love with anyone else.  his fans knew this as if it were a biblical quotation.

all in all a terrific film.  with it, its director, steven soderbergh, left film for television where he has pretty much a carte blance on developing similar vehicles for HBO and other cable channels. although it showed as tv in the USA, it was shown as a film internationally, including at film festivals.

5766026,4,B00CZP9YWS,"I was never a Liberace fan (although I never disliked him), and I strongly dislike both Michael Douglas and Matt Damon. I would never willingly see anything with either of those two actors in it. So why on earth did I watch this? I don't know, but I enjoyed it!

Neither of them is really a good actor. They obviously thought (and millions seem to agree) that they were breaking brave new ground and showcasing their immense talents in these roles, but they were just playing the same characters they (and all other Hollywood A-listers) always play: themselves, with various amounts of makeup and choreography and voice coaching to vary the monotony enough to satisfy the mindless masses who pay to see them on screen.

The best I can say about Damon is that most of the time he's easy to ignore in this movie, at least when he has clothes on; his body is so weird that it hurts my eyes, but there's nearly always something interesting to look away at. His barely-suppressed homophobia (Damon's, not the character's) comes shining through in the interview on the DVD, and it comes in handy when he gets to repulse a request Douglas makes in one of their many sex scenes. That's only one of many reasons Damon has always given me the creeps: homosexuality gives HIM the creeps.

But Douglas... Ahhhh! He's nothing like Liberace, but I had a ball watching him just being little Michael Douglas speaking with a funny voice, moving in a funny way, and sporting killer makeup and killer duds. There's something fascinating about him despite my intense dislike of him as both a person and an actor.

Enjoying this movie won't turn me into a fan, but it was fun for the couple of hours it lasted. Not great fun, but fun enough not to turn off, which is quite a feat for a big-budget Hollywood movie.

One complaint: it was stupid to have Douglas recite rather than sing ""The Impossible Dream"" in his last scene. Liberace was a competent singer, and since Douglas evidently can't sing it was dumb not to have a singer dub his voice then. It could have been done seamlessly so the audience never suspected it wasn't him singing. His plodding recitation of the song's silly lyrics ruined what might otherwise have been a fabulous scene. It doesn't matter that Liberace recited it himself; it should have been sung in that scene.",1381536000,,2318,4.630170316301703

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: If you had asked me a few years ago if I thought Michael Douglas and Matt Damon could make for an engaging and believable romantic couple, I probably would have laughed in your face. If you then continued to tell me that the pair would actually be portraying Liberace and his young lover, I probably would have continued to laugh in your face. Now, don't get me wrong, both actors are more than capable performers, but the odd pairing just doesn't scream ""captivating chemistry."" Well, it turns out that such an assumption from me would have been dead wrong, and now we have the proof. I mean, just look at that the beautiful Region B/2 Blu-ray embossed cover!

Directed by Steven Soderbergh of 'Behind the Candelabra' presents an intimate, funny, and genuinely dramatic peek into the colourful pianist's personal life, exposing a romance that starts off innocent enough but soon becomes increasingly chaotic, twisted, and unhealthy. As passion transitions into spite, and affection transforms into jealousy, the two tormented lovers engage in a roller coaster ride of emotions, all set against the backdrop of the over-the-top glitz and glamour of showbiz wealth and fame.

Based on the 1988 memoir ""Behind the Candelabra: My Life with Liberace,"" the film focuses on the real-life relationship between Scott Thorson [Matt Damon], a young aspiring veterinarian, and an aging Liberace [Michael Douglas], the flashy superstar pianist. After being introduced to each other backstage at one of the musician's shows, the two instantly take a liking toward one another, and soon Liberace hires Scott to be his personal assistant. Their relationship then quickly becomes romantic, but things ultimately start to take a darker turn. As plastic surgery, drugs, and jealousy take hold, their coupling becomes damaging, threatening to unravel both their lives.

The story is essentially told from Scott Thorson's perspective, and he serves as our window into Liberace's lavish world. At first overwhelmed by the flashy entertainer's extravagant lifestyle, the once modest and innocent young man eventually comes to embrace the many perks that come his way. In fact, he ultimately goes a little too far, and Matt Damon does a great job with the stark transformation, gradually shifting the character's personality until he's barely recognisable (inside and out). Forced to have plastic surgery and take drugs for weight loss by Liberace, Thorson has a bit of a crisis of identity, and the actor plays up the man's increasing confusion and frustrations perfectly illustrates all while remaining infatuated with the very source of his problems.

Of course, as radical as Matt Damon's transformation is, it's nothing compared to Michael Douglas' impressive metamorphosis into Liberace. I must admit, at first I couldn't help but see the famous actor behind the facade, but as the runtime continued, Douglas gradually disappeared into the role, truly embodying the character. With a solid approximation of the flamboyant star's distinct voice and mannerisms, and some great costumes and makeup as his groundwork to build upon, the actor goes on to offer a multifaceted portrayal that never feels like an imitation or a caricature. Instead, he feels like a real person, full of insecurity, loneliness, longing, eccentricity, and vulnerability, exposing the actual man behind the larger-than-life persona.

Together, Matt Damon and Michael Douglas form a completely believable couple, and at first their courtship is more or less positive. A lot of the film is dedicated to pillow talk between the two, and their conversations feel intimate and natural. Likewise, the film doesn't shy away from their physical interactions, providing a frank depiction of sex. A great deal of loving humour is also derived from the characters' innate eccentricities (again, just look at that cover!), and the filmmakers play up some of the inherent silliness and strangeness of the subject matter to great effect (Rob Lowe's character is especially memorable and should of got some form of a gong) without ever really sacrificing emotion or drama.

With that said, as funny as a lot of the runtime can be, the narrative does eventually take some increasingly dark and unsettling turns, revealing the affair's more disturbing elements, including a particularly creepy desire from Liberace to adopt Thorson and literally re-shape him in his own image. This all leads to an interesting examination of emotional control, facades, fickle infatuations, the pitfalls of fame, and the consequences of insatiable desires. What starts out as a supportive relationship grows ugly and petty, and it becomes hard to watch as the two lovers try to spite each other in painful ways.

Though the subject matter might seem inherently flashy on the surface, Steven Soderbergh mostly plays against expectations, and instead offers a rather restrained approach, opting for a more functional and modest cinematic form that adheres to a fittingly vintage look. Often letting the characters and situations simply speak for themselves, the director engenders a personal, intimate mood with well-crafted shots and movements that, while artistically designed, don't really draw attention to the filmmaking. That's not to say that the film is completely without spectacle, however, and there are key scenes where Steven Soderbergh definitely turns up the dial on his style knob.

Several recreations of Liberace's on stage performances are all appropriately showy, with a few quick cutting close-ups of the talented artist's impressive finger work gliding across his piano. Some later scenes that follow Thorson through his drug addiction are also home to more kinetic visuals, with disorienting moving shots that go in and out of focus, replicating the characters' own distraught and paranoid state of mind. As one might expect, the production design itself is also dazzling, bringing the performer's shining costumes and extravagant homes to life, adding an invaluable sense of outrageous character and personality to the proceedings. And then of course there's the film's finale, which features a brief excursion into the surreal, playing up Liberace's penchant for glitzy excess one last time to great success.

Richard LaGravenese's screenplay works in fine little dabs of detail, and serves up one or two aces. When Liberace's ageing mother (Debbie Reynolds, also totally awesome and terrific) hits the jackpot on the mansion's one-armed bandit, the machine refuses to cough up its reward. (He's forgotten to fill it again.) Scott goes to fetch Liberace, who apologises to his mother for the lack of coins. Her reply: ""I'll take a cheque.""

According to reports before the film's release, Steven Soderbergh apparently shopped the project around to several major studios, but all of them balked at the notion of making a film based on the topic. After watching the completed film, I really can't see what they were objecting too and us brits had no problem with the film, in fact we welcomed it with open arms of celebration, as we Brits are not upset with its subject matter. Sure, the concept isn't exactly commercial (OK, it's pretty damn far from commercial), but with Matt Damon, Michael Douglas, and Steven Soderbergh all on board, it at least had a good chance of drawing critical success and perhaps even some awards recognition (all things it has indeed garnered even in its small screen incarnation). Regardless, thankfully HBO snatched up the project, and the results are more than worthwhile. An intimate examination of jealousy, romance, overindulgence, and the crazy, hurtful things we can do to one another when love is involved, 'Behind the Candelabra' successfully peels back the surface layers of Liberace's later life, offering an emotional, humorous, thoughtful, and appropriately sparkling piece of filmmaking.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The film is presented in a beautiful 1080p encoded image transfer in the 1.78:1 aspect ratio. Shot on the Red Epic, the film has a distinct style that looks quite nice on Blu-ray, enhancing the glittery, retro content of the story well. The digital source is mostly clean, but there is a light layer of noise visible from time to time, and a few isolated spikes in noise during darker scenes that can be a little distracting. The picture adheres to an intentionally soft appearance with a faintly diffuse glow that helps to create a certain ""vintage"" look. Though this softer quality does limit detail, clarity is still good and there is a solid sense of depth and fine textures in characters and wardrobe choices. To this end, all of Liberace's extravagant, glittery costumes sparkle off the screen and one can make out every speck of sequins. Colours are often cast in a golden sheen, and while the palette isn't particularly varied, the aesthetic fits nicely with the 1970s and 1980s setting. Thankfully, contrast is well balanced with steady black levels and good shadow delineation. Appropriately stylised with a soft, golden glow, 'Behind the Candelabra' looks very good on Blu-ray, preserving the director's intentions without any major issues.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The HBO film is provided with a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track and a 2.0 LPCM Audio Stereo track. Optional English SDH subtitles are also included. Modest but relatively engaging, this is a solid, albeit restrained mix. Speech is clear and well prioritised, giving ample presence to Michael Douglas' distinct take on Liberace's trademark voice. The track is fairly front-loaded, but effects like crowd reactions and applause during shows do hit the surrounds. Likewise, other ambient effects like crickets or background clatter in a rowdy club are dispersed naturally around the soundstage. Directionality is decent as well, with a few key sounds (like a door slamming off to the side) being relegated to the appropriate speakers. The piano music itself comes through with wonderful clarity and dimension, bringing great range and depth to the musical performances. With that said the film as a whole is rather quiet, with a subdued sense of space. Likewise, bass activity is negligible. The sound design is a little subdued, but the more delicate approach works well with the intimate subject matter. A bit more texture and immersion would have been welcomed, but as a whole this is a fitting mix.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: The Making of Behind the Candelabra [2013] [1080i] [14:00] This HOB Special Documentary is presented with a 2.0 LPCM Audio Stereo and the same subtitle options as the main feature, this is a standard behind-the-scenes documentary with cast and crew interviews and on-set footage. The participants discuss adapting the source material, approaching the characters, and what is was like to work with Steven Soderbergh. Crew members also elaborate on recreating Liberace's extravagant homes and costumes, and there's even some brief archive footage of the man himself. Though this offers a little more than usual promotional stuff, the documentary is sadly is far too brief. Appearing in this HBO Special Documentary are Matt Damon, Michael Douglas, Marcus LaVoi, Rob Lowe, Debbie Reynolds and Jerry Weintraub.

Finally, 'Behind the Candelabra' offers an intimate peek into superstar pianist Liberace's personal life and his turbulent affair with a younger man. Through their story, director Steven Soderbergh shines a particularly glittering light on a fascinating real-life figure, while simultaneously examining interesting concepts dealing with love, jealousy, excess, and fame. The Blu-ray features a strong video presentation that respects the director's intended aesthetic, and a solid audio mix. Sadly, we only get one brief documentary, but it's still worth a look. While this isn't the most impressive disc, the technical presentation is good and the film itself is a well-crafted biopic that will likely even appeal to those who might seem apprehensive about its subject matter. When I purchased the Region A/1 Blu-ray, I had no sound and so instead purchased this Region B/2 Blu-ray and it is absolutely stunning and the beautiful designed Embossed Slip Cover is definitely far superior to the Region A/1 Blu-ray Cover. So all in all this is a stunning film and presentation and has gone pride of place in my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

5766033,3,B00CZP9YWS,"The right movie for the wrong reason.
By now we all know Liberace was not only the world's most flamboyant entertainer, he was also a homosexual.  This behind-the-scenes peek at his love life is like a weak cup of luke-warm tea.
The main glitch is Michael Douglas' portrayal of Liberace.  He's a straight guy acting like a flaming queen but never quite gets there.  It's hard to ignore his deep, reverberating baritone voice and boney frame; when Liberace had a clear falsetto and a body that fluctuated three clothes sizes at any given time, mostly husky.  The way some of the lines are delivered is really off, and some of the lines miss the point.  In an early scene,  Douglas prances across the stage talking to the audience and says ""Well go ahead, stare all you like.  I mean, you paid for it!"".  It sounded like he was talking about tickets to the show.  Liberace himself would tease his audience about how they paid for all his jewelry and costumes, letting them look, touch and marvel at the baubles.  He clearly came across as meaning that his fans made him rich and very comfortable indeed.
I think the purpose of this film could have been something extremely touching, delightful and at times, painful to watch.  But it seemed more of an exercise in showing two famous straight actors portraying gay characters in a long term relationship.  Matt Damon pulled it off and had some sterling moments.  I'd pay money to see the outtakes to this film.
I had seen this movie on HBO and bought the DVD to see what extras were included.  Hopefully, there would be behind the scenes and biographical information on Liberace.  There is one short extra on the making of the film.  It is mainly the actors telling what it was like to be in the movie.  There was nothing telling about how it felt to connect with their characters.
Kudos to Debbie Reynolds as Liberace's mother.  Who would have known if her name wasn't in the credits?  Such an amazing transformation and portrayal.
I would have to guess Scott's book gives more intimate graphic details about his relationship with Mr. Showmanship.  The  movie would have done well to take the focus off the actors and their ability to act effeminate, and nurture the authentic trappings and nuances of having a homosexual relationship with a superstar in the 1970's.

I was naive but the times were naive....In any case, when I heard about Scot Thorsen and his claims about Liberace, I thought he was lying. It was beyond anything I could accept.

5766049,2,B00CZP9YWS,"I'll probably be among the few to say ""the emperor has no clothes"" about the raves surrounding this film, but I will anyway since it's only my opinion to take or leave.

OK, so not a lot of time to develop characters within a 2-hr movie, but I thought this aspect of ""Behind the Candelabra"" movie was way too light, and the lack of motives exploration and emotional depth made the movie flat and lackluster for me.  I also thought Matt Damon was a lot more believable as a boy-toy than Michael Douglas was as a queeny older star, but again,  I'm likely in the minority here.

For me ,above all, the highlights of this movie were: a glimpse at the kitschy interior of Liberace's house, and the thought that 2 straight hunks like Damon and Douglas were cool enough to play gay men.  Society is realizing gay folks aren't all going to just disappear, although some still wish they would. God bless America in the 21st century -  the land of the free, & the home of the brave straights willing to play it gay!",1380499200,4,1005,4.376344086021505

Those of us who remember Liberace from the 60s and 70s might be able to better assess how well Douglas recreated him than someone who is too young to have lived through those relatively innocent times. To appreciate this film it helps to have an open mind. It helps to have some level of maturity.

In those days many of us thought Liberace was simply an eccentric and very talented artist. We didn't dream what might be going on behind that candelabra. The movie showed me a very sad and lonely little man whose overbearing mother pushed, prodded, controlled and steered him into this career. He never played a piano for enjoyment in his homes and was incapable of having a lasting relationship, even with someone he loved.

The sets recreated Liberace's sometimes tasteless, often tasteful, and always excessive decorating style. I felt as if I were in his Las Vegas home.

Even though I liked it very much and enjoyed it tremendously, I will criticize it just a little. The movie could have been shorter. The ending could have been less silly.",1380499200,2,1118,4.782383419689119

5766054,2,B00CZP9YWS,"There must be a dearth of TV movies if this one won 15 Emmy Nominations. Michael Douglas does not deserve an award; he didn't even try to alter his obnoxious voice to sound like Liberace, or even act like Liberace; Douglas can't act anyway. Matt Damon  deserves an award for putting up with Douglas. The movie lacks professionalism, even the picture quality is bad. Everyone knows the simple story; it's been on TV several times in many guises. This version is boring: it lacks pizzazz and the requisite camp. The end is absurd. Items in ""Features"" should have been in the movie. Rob Lowe, as the plastic surgeon, looked good; maybe he worked on himself. The music is well recorded. Douglas looks as if he is really playing the piano (if that is important to you); besides the antique autos it's the only realistic thing in the movie. The budget must have been blown on costumes and sets (including Zsa Zsa Gabor's house) with no money left for a decent production. Pehaps gay movies need gay directors. ""La Cage Aux Folles"" would have been a flop if these incompetents were in charge. It would never have become a great musical either. This turkey is dead in the barnyard. That could be good enough since Thanksgiving is lurking around the corner. I thank Matt Damon for giving it the old college (Harvard) try, though. Unfortunately the producers don't know that ""candelabra"" is plural and ""candelabrum"" is singular. All I ever saw was one candlestick on Lee's instrument. Yes, I bought it on Amazon, more than I can say for the bogus reviews.
Post scriptum: I forgot to mention that in this paltry, poultry production, Liberace credits his penile implants for his ability to peform four times a day ouch! Talk about a pain in the ...!

5766055,1,B00CZP9YWS,"Disgusting -- aside from making money, this film serves no purpose. This reminds me of tabloids that understand that sex sells. People are still cashing in on gossip about Liberace long after he is dead.

Confession: I don't like lurid celebrity exploitation films in general, and in particular I thought Mike Douglas just could not pull off the role of Liberace and that this was an insult to Liberace's fans and to his memory.

My grandmother was a great fan of Liberace and so when I was young I watched him a fair amount with her. Frankly I thought he was a joke and that his audience appeal was a big joke. Yet I did enjoy the music. And I have to say that I understand his personal appeal, even though it did not work for me. He came across as sincerely warm, gentle, playful, loving, and in a certain way he was his own man. For example he was not afraid to love and be devoted to his mother openly at a time when men were much more reserved about their feelings than they are today. He came across as an unashamed mama's boy -- and that was brave in those days, as were his glitzy costumes etc. The campy glitz and glamor were largely props or embellishments and what carried his fame was his personality.

Douglas' performance conveyed none of that to me. There was almost always something cold and calculating behind the eyes even when he was performing. He did not seem like his own man. He seemed like a guy in drag trying too hard to prove something, to be something he was not but wanted to be. He played a gay stereotype more than the Liberace we used to see on television, who came across as a real human being -- though even a kid could see that he was probably gay and had a complicated and unhappy side behind the candelabra.  He seemed to be putting perhaps his best foot forward, and that is what people try to do. Nobody is all good feet. Did that make him a phoney? Not necessarily. Douglas may have worked his butt off to play the role and it was certainly challenging, but that does not mean that his performance worked. it did not for me. It was too much a stereotype except for a few short scenes. Largely because of Douglas' unconvincing performance the film left one with the erroneous impression that Liberace had appeal because of the glitz alone, and not so much because of his warm and loving public persona. This angle would have been enough to ruin the film for me. But there is more.

it did not take long for me to suspect that no one knew enough about Liberace's carefully closeted life or personal life in general to cast his character the way that they were doing. They were fleshing out freely their stereotypes of effeminate gays and of celebrity boy-toys. These were Hollywood show-biz easy characterizations, not necessarily the truth about specific human beings. Yes the Hollywood Las Vegas scenes are a mess, but still not everyone can be painted with the same brush. Was this a revelation about Hollywood using the name and superficial image of Liberace or a revelation about the flesh and blood Liberace?  It was only a few minutes into the film that I started wondering what I was watching.

I did some googling. The facts were correct according to interviews with Scott Thorson, the boy-toy. Well, maybe and maybe not. Thorson seems terribly unreliable according to several sources, for example a May 10, 2013 New York Times article  [...] ""He's not a bad person,"" said Mr. Pelicone, who has a swirl of brown-blond hair and a cigarette habit. ""He's just twisted and kind of cutthroat.""

How much independent verification is there of the material in Thorson's book? Why should anyone care enough about his questionable book to make an expensive film and hire famous actors. It was a lot of work and money for what??? To cash in on lurid gossip about a most awkwardly closeted celebrity.

But it is not the alleged facts that bother me as much as the spin that was given to the alleged facts. There can be several ways to present a fact. The plastic surgery matter sticks in my mind. The film left the impression at the moment when the subject came up that Liberace wanted Scott to look like him because of insane vanity. Then later there was the quite vague suggestion that he wanted to be able to pass him off as his son. Thorson has said that this was in fact the motive all along. None of this makes sense to me and this critical fact needs much more interpretation than anyone has given it. If Thorson is telling the truth, how was an unmarried celebrity supposed to have explained a biological son who was then to have been adopted?  Or was this as the film implies an act of insane vanity imposed on Thorson by Liberace? Or is there some secret that we cannot know that it was actually ""twisted"" Thorson who wanted to look like Liberace because he was star struck and wanted to be his sone and look like his mentor? Nothing adds up in the stories we are getting about the plastic surgery.

It seems that no one can say much about Liberace and his boy-toy other than that Liberace was a tortured gay celebrity, closeted perhaps to the point of ""paranoia,"" and that he had a dependent close companion who was pretty screwed  up himself, and sometimes they probably did have sex. Scott was perhaps more conflicted about this than Liberace. One has to dig pretty hard to get this out of the film. Though one could argue that it is in there, I feel that it was a clumsy and un-artful exposition at best of a complex creative person and an unfortunate relationship.

The actual historical situation could have been explored in much more depth and with much more sensitivity than it was in the film. To me the film just came across as yet more exploitation of the Liberace name -- first his managers and now the film makers and publishers of Thorson's book.

Oh. Damon's performance was not bad.

And Oh -- the ""making of"" feature on the disc was not bad. But again it was superficial and pandered too much to the sexual aspect, like ""what was it like kissing a man and having your bare butt filmed?""",1380067200,36,6048,4.484545454545454

 Completely closeted his entire life as a homosexual it wasn't until after his death from AIDS in 1987 that the fact Liberace(Lee) was a gay man. Many knew but no one discussed Liberace's sexual preference as that was his wish.

The book came out the year after Liberace's death and he was totally left out of Lee's will and Scott wanted to set the story straight and have people know that he was not a gold digger.

He acted and appeared like most gay guys I knew in the 70's and 80's. Why producers and directors want to make gay characters so pug faced, spiked lip over the top gay is beyond me. Homosexuality was still very much in the closet in those days and most gays blended into main-stream society quite well. True Liberace was obvious to all but his blinded female admirer's, but still, I never once saw him in any public venue with anyone that was or could be easily picked as gay.
The acting was great, Matt did a great job as Scott and Michael carried the role of Liberace well.  However, I can see why other studios didn't want to touch it, and HBO did, it was ""to gay"", meaning, I don't think it viewed favorably or accurately who gay people really are.  Straight actors tend to always make gay characters effeminate and seriously most gay men aren't.

The film was great in a lot of aspects set details, costume, cinematography, I just enjoyed every scene of it and never got tired, was even wanting for more.  But here is an excerpt of a great critic of the movie by Micha Oleszczyk
Cannes' Piano Man

Behind the Candelabra"" is a gloriously trashy title, one you can easily imagine being greeted with a dirty giggle by Liberace himself. Given that the man was extremely secretive about his homosexuality -- as well as litigious when it came to any public rumors of it -- he would probably have hated the idea of a film about him that focuses on his long-time relationship with a man named Scott Thorson. Still, the movie happens to be terrific (easily the best I saw in the Cannes competition this year), and does full justice both to Liberace's stage persona and his everyday humanity -- which got just about buried by the tons of glitter, pomade and frills he donned to give his audience pleasure.
Steven Soderbergh has based his movie on Scott Thorson's book of the same name, adapted for the screen by Richard Lagravanese. The story spans the final decade in the life of Mr. Showmanship, and follows a predictable tangent of a birth and death of a relationship. Thorson starts out as a friend, quickly becomes a toy boy, and then an actual lover of the man who lavishes gifts and affection on him with no sense of limits. Once Liberace starts interfering with Scott's looks in order to make him into the son he never had -- complete with cooking up a legal adoption -- bumps in the road start appearing, leading to infidelity, break-up and a lawsuit.
What makes the film special is the absolute precision of Soderbergh's direction, as well as a genuinely great performance by Michael Douglas as Liberace. Somehow, ""Candelabra"" manages to both follow the formula of a biopic and go way beyond it. It's a film about a real person that feels like it didn't need to be based on one at all. Soderbergh works from the inside out: his priority is the truth of human emotions, not factual accuracy. In fact, the latter seems to be mere collateral of the director's integrity; what matters most in ""Behind the Candelabra"" is a story of two men in a complicated relationship that brings as much joy to them as it does anguish and pain.
Liberace's first appearance in the film is handled masterfully: we see Scott and his sometime lover Bob (Scott Bakula) entering an L.A. nightclub, mid-concert. The pianist on the stage is seen in a long shot and remains out of focus. What we first hear is the easy stage banter he engages in, slowly working up his audience. Once we get a close-up of him, the whiteness of Michael Douglas' teeth is matched only by the keyboard his hands are effortlessly traversing.
His skin seems to be oozing tan all by itself; mascara looks like his natural secretion. Everything about him -- the frills, the glitter, the sparkling pompadour -- screams camp, and yet the flamboyant gayness of his act is mostly lost on the audience. ""They don't know he's gay,"" says Bob, hitting the nail on the head. Liberace's rise to fame came before the gay culture and sensibility seeped into the mainstream of American life, and thus his mannerisms remained somehow idiosyncratic and ""pure."" He was the gay guy your grandma loved, mainly because she didn't have to think of him as gay. His flamboyance was seen as a function of his sensitivity; it was indicative of how difficult it was for this exceptionally tender and giving man to find the ""right woman"" who -- duh! -- must have been all he ever dreamt of.
As I walked into the theater to see ""Behind the Candelabra,"" I feared Douglas would come off as a summa-cum-laude graduate from the Meryl Streep School of Biopic Acting, which teaches amassing a bunch of gimmicks and passing it off as a role. Instead, Michael Douglas blew me away with the emotional truth of his performance, in which every seemingly imitative flourish stems from the inner life of his character. His Liberace is a man of infinite appetite and generosity. He's voracious in taking and lavish in giving. He's the ultimate sugar daddy with a heart of gold and an ego of steel -- the perfect seducer, who administers blows as often as he suffers from them himself. The film suggests it's his sweetly overbearing mom -- played by Debbie Reynolds, who perfected the part in Albert Brooks' 1996 ""Mother"" -- that was at least partly responsible for her son's near-pathological eagerness to please. When she dies midway into the film, the bereaved Liberace confesses to Scott, in a way that's both shocking and exhilarating, ""I'm free.""
Douglas has always been associated with screen seduction. He was both the victim of it (most famously in ""Fatal Attraction"" and ""Disclosure"") and its borderline-sleazy enabler. His Oscar-winning performance as Gordon Gekko in ""Wall Street"" is the closest to what we see now in ""Candelabra"": both movies are about rich older insiders luring younger men, who crave a boost in status and a lavish life style. He is so subtle and alive in ""Behind the Candelabra,"" I believe he'll be leaving Cannes with a Best Actor award.
If there's a theme running through Steven Soderbergh's varied body of work, it probably has to do with performing as the ultimate expression of self. In his famous, Palm d'Or-winning debut, people talk sex and tell lies while knowing they were being videotaped. Given multiple levels of deception and role-playing that's usually involved in a Soderbergh movie, even the ""Ocean's"" series seems like an elaboration of that basic trait (there, the performance took the form of a heist). As recently as in ""Magic Mike,"" which focuses on the world of male strippers, Soderbergh shows both the sense of empowerment inherent in performing before an audience, as well as the possible trappings of becoming too caught up in its glamour. His latest -- and allegedly last -- movie serves as a great summation of that theme.
The film ends with an ""All That Jazz"" coda, in which Scott imagines Liberace's funeral as a follies-type performance, with his late AIDS-afflicted lover singing the ultimate chestnut of Broadway resilience, ""The Impossible Dream."" As he struts his glittered frame around the stage filled with Ziegfeld girls, he looks like a star of a glam-rock band, except he's not out to titillate the audience, but to flatter it and please it. When he takes off and floats through the air, it doesn't come as a surprise at all. Show-biz enchantment came as easy to him as breathing, and -- at least in Soderbergh's movie -- lingers in the air even as the breathing had stopped.",1378425600,16,6751,4.7733105218135155
5766078,3,B00CZP9YWS,"""I want to be everything to you Scott. I want to be father, brother, lover, best friend."" This is the true story of Scott Thorson (Damon) and his relationship with the one and only Liberace (Douglas). Scott was a normal easy going gay man with a dream to become a vet. That all changed when he met Liberace. The small town boy became a drug addicted, paranoid, and revenge obsessed man. I wasn't totally sure what to expect from this movie. I knew very little about the real Liberace and nothing about this story at all. The movie shows the rise and fall Scott and the extreme things he goes through for the man he loves. The story is pretty interesting but the real reason to watch is the performance of Michael Douglas. He is great in this and turns himself completely into the character that he makes you forget you are watching a famous actor like Michael Douglas. Overall, a pretty interesting bio-pic that I thought was pretty good but the performance by Douglas is great. I give it a B.",1373241600,54,993,4.461538461538462

 While he was alive, Liberace did everything he could to prevent his adoring fans (mostly elderly women) from learning that he was gay. 'Behind the Candelabra' focuses on the flamboyant entertainer's private life, particularly on his long-term relationship with his much younger lover, Scott Thorson.

Thorson met Liberace through a mutual acquaintance and gave up on his aspirations to become a veterinarian. Instead, in exchange for material (and sometimes) emotional support, Thorson became both Liberace's lover and personal assistant. Later, Liberace entertained ideas that Thorson could become his adopted son (much to Thorsen's chagrin, Liberace never made this official by signing the legal paperwork).

Early on in this docudrama, Thorson receives a prophetic warning from one of Liberace's former 'concubines', that he too will be discarded by a younger rival. Along the way, Thorson agrees to undergo plastic surgery at Liberace's behest, who seeks to transform the younger man, into the spitting image of Liberace himself. As a result of the surgery, Thorson eventually becomes addicted to drugs, a situation which Liberace comes to despise.

On the other hand, Liberace's penchant for patronizing pornographic shops bothers Thorson, who points out that doing so, could undermine all of Liberace's efforts to remain closeted. The straw that breaks the camel's back is when Liberace tosses Thorson aside for a younger rival, leading to Thorson's big meltdown, where he is unceremoniously escorted from Liberace's mansion, never to return until Liberace's final days.

Take away the fact that this is Liberace, the over the top entertainer, known to millions, the domestic imbroglios between this gay couple, are nothing out of the ordinary. Should we really care when Thorson 'loses it' when Liberace dumps him? After all, it was strictly his decision to live an empty life where an elder benefactor provides all his material wants, at the expense of his own self-satisfaction. And does it really matter who's 'on top', during bouts of anal sex?

Despite the mundane source material, which highlights the couples' self-destructive behavior, there are moments which suggest that both Liberace and Thorson, were at heart, decent people. Take Liberace doing so much for Thorson upon the death of his foster mother (like hiring the chartered plane); by the same token, Thorson is willing to forgive Liberace, and visits him at his deathbed, just as he's about to die from AIDS.

Michael Douglas and Matt Damon do a decent enough job, recreating the roles of the two lovers; but I wonder if it would have been better if two actors who were actually gay, could have brought more to the parts. Debbie Reynolds is great, as well as unrecognizable in the role of Liberace's mother. And director Steven Soderburgh acquits himself well, in presenting this 'warts and all' portrait, of the offbeat showman.

'Behind the Candelabra' may not be everyone's cup of tea not because the material is salacious but rather because it's a bit ordinary. That includes Liberace's music, which to my mind represented a combination of the sublime and the ridiculous. In the end, there's enough here to keep one's interest, but given the subject matter, don't expect any real epiphanies.",1373241600,5,3313,5.247637051039698
5766080,5,B00CZP9YWS,"BEHIND THE CANDELABRA looks at the man behind the myth of Liberace - entertainer, pianist extraordinaire and promiscuous homosexual.  Michael Douglas is just wonderful in the role; he has the voice intonations absolutely right, as well as the body-language.  His Liberace is so in love with his self-created myth that he cannot see beyond it; to say that he is massively self-centered is no understatement. At the same time Douglas portrays him as vulnerable; however much of a star he might have been, he needed young men to lean on as well as to take to bed.  Matt Damon is equally wonderful as Liberace's much younger lover Scott Thorson; at first rather bemused that the celebrity should take such an interest in him, and then falling hopelessly and yet eternally in love.  Steven Soderbergh's film begins quite humorously, with Douglas and Damon indulging in an elaborate courtship; but the tone soon changes as the film examines the lives of the ill-matched yet inseparable couple.  The material is sympathetically yet cleverly handled, producing a compelling piece of work.",1372291200,13,1080,5.0790960451977405
5766081,5,B00CZP9YWS,"I was overwhelmed by every aspect of this film. I remember Liberache from the old days of television when I was a little kid. I found him mesmerizing. Over the years, I certainly learned to see him in a different light, but loved his talents none the less. He always seemed genuinely nice, and shared his on stage persona with a wink. When the Scott Thorson story hit the rag sheets, it came as no surprise.

Behind the Candelabra, there was another story to be told. The depth of Liberache's public denial seems sad and desperate. It was a reflection of the times in which he rose to fame. Perhaps it is the telling of his story in another era that makes it so fascinating, like going through a looking glass to his personal wonderland.

I found this film to be so compelling that I watched it several times in one week. The acting was so great, I felt as though Douglas was channeling Liberache rather than impersonating him. When I read Debbie Reynolds name in the credits, I thought that I must have missed her scene. How could I have not seen her? Only after the first viewing did I realize that it was she who portrayed Liberache's mother!

There is so much to admire in this film. The makeup, the sets, the costumes -- all perfection. However, what stays with you is the idea that no matter who the protagonists were, this is a love story -- a love story gone wrong, to be sure, but a love story none the less.

Behind the Candelabra is a film that will stay with you for quite some time. It sent me on a journey of research for more information about Liberache's life. Surely, it wasn't easy to live compelled to hide your true nature, yet always be in the public eye.

I can't help but wonder what Liberache, himself, would have to say about Behind The Candelabra.",1372204800,14,1773,4.3932926829268295
5766082,1,B00CZP9YWS,"Basically, an extended hatchet job on Liberace, Scott Thorson, and gay people in general.  It never transcends the ""Ewwwwwww! Queers!"" position.  Despite some fine work from Matt Damon, this film is a botch.  Sad.  If the Steven Soderbergh of SEX LIES AND VIDEOTAPE had shown up, we might have gotten an interesting film about actual human beings.  Alas, we got the Steven Soderbergh of those OCEAN films, and all we got is a bunch of tasteless barely one-dimensional pasteboard figures going through the highly sensationalized motions.

Liberace deserved better.  So does the audience.  A real missed opportunity.",1372204800,18,614,5.257731958762887
5766083,4,B00CZP9YWS,"Oops! Wrong Movie. Although, the truth be told, This movie bears a certain stylistic similarity to MOMMIE DEAREST.

Liberace was a ""larger-than-life"" entertainer and, whether you liked his work or not, he was difficult to ignore.

The same thing might be said of Joan Crawford, although, I must say, I liked her films far better than I liked anything Liberace ever did. I was a Joan Crawford Fan. I am not a fan of Liberace.

Joan was the reason people went to see MOMMIE DEAREST. Nobody gave a damn about Christina Crawford. Few people would even recognize Christina if she were walking along the street. Everybody wanted to see Joan Crawford, warts and all.

Liberace is the reason people will want to see BEHIND THE CANDELABRA. Nobody gives a damn about Scott Thorson. I barely remember what Scott looked like from photos in the tabloids. Tall, blond and completely unmemorable.

This made Matt Damon's work the less difficult of the two portrayals. There is no memory of a real life person with whom to draw a comparison.

Lastly, like MOMMIE DEAREST, we are only getting one side of the story. Scott's side.

As I remember, Liberace would become even more famous because of his flamboyant nature than he would be because of his piano playing. In the fifties, he came across as ""precious and peculiar"". By the eighties, he had become a Bird of Paradise and a Las Vegas Institution. If you went to Las Vegas, you had to go see Liberace. Everyone knew that Liberace was Gay no matter how much he denied it.

In this movie, Liberace is played to perfection by Michael Douglas in what is undoubtedly the finest portrayal of his long career. Douglas deserves to win an Emmy for it. Liberace is portrayed as a Predatory Old Chicken Hawk who buys his way through a succession of lovers young enough to be his grandchildren and gets away with it simply because his money and fame allow him to do so. His main interest in life is himself. Sadly, in real life, that is largely the rule among celebrities, it is not the exception.

I know less of Scott Thorson. Reading between the lines, we get a young hustler with little talent for anything else and an unhealthy appetite for illegal drugs.

It's not a pretty picture and the sexual interaction between the two men is strong stuff for television. I'm surprised that Douglas and Damon could be persuaded to play these roles as written. The producers must have paid them plenty.

The production values are great as are the supporting performances by Dan Akroyd, Scott Bakula, Cheyenne Jackson and Debbie Reynolds. It's s shame Ms. Reynolds hasn't more to do.

All in all, it's a fascinating movie but it's not for the kiddies or the squeamish among you.

Get a load of that Auburn Speedster used in the movie. Wow!",1372032000,4,2758,4.661855670103093
5766084,3,B00CZP9YWS,"I am one of those gay men who feels a bit queasy around camp, and more so when the camp inhabits ageing flesh, so I had to watch this in short spurts, taking breaks to kill a few zombies and then going back for another dose.

The film opens in a 1970s gay bar which for some reason boasts a 21st-century sound system.

After this slight blip the authenticity is pretty convincing, although Michael Douglas fails to capture the extraordinary plastic persona of the real Liberace - Douglas's version is far more human, and much less bizarre.

Given the eccentricity of the main character and the people who surrounded and worshipped him, I would have played this for dark humour: think Bob Fosse directing ""Cabaret"". Even the spurned lover throwing a super-tantrum and smashing up the sitting-room was played for sobs, when it could have been hilarious.

So I dragged my way somewhat wearily through lots of furs and poodles, and was preparing to write a hatchet job on this movie, but Michael Douglas as Liberace on his deathbed made me weep. Damn, the man can act.",1371600000,10,1064,4.67379679144385
5766085,2,B00CZP9YWS,"Movie was well-written and lavish. But Michael Douglas was, well...Michael Douglas. His performance ran the gamut from glimpses of a nearly-believable flamboyant gay man to his typical movie character. Unfortunately, Michael Douglas is a very masculine man, and so when he was being every other character he has played, Liberace was nowhere in sight. His steely eyes, calculated line delivery, and even his distinctive (masculine, confident) way of walking popped out constantly, and, for me, he lost all credibility as Liberace. It's possible I am biased since I am a fan of his and have seen all of his movies so I could not possibly be taken in by this performance. Or, I admit, it could be because he has a somewhat limited acting range and has just never left his zone. At any rate, his performance prevented me from really getting into the movie. As for Matt Damon, he slid seamlessly into the Thorson role (with no resemblence to his many other characters), but he is just too old for it and his age showed in some shots. If you are not familiar with either of these actors, you might enjoy the story.",1371513600,13,1108,4.716494845360825

8587983,4,B00CZP9YWS,"This is a difficult movie to review. For me it begs a few questions.

Apparently Hollywood rejected the film Candelabra for mainstream cinema audience as it was ""too gay"". And I notice the film has HBO stamped all over it. Well, hurray for HBO not being censorious: HBO leading where mainstream Hollywood fears to tread. And the film is about the lives of two people during times when such censorship was even more common - so maybe that explains the larger-than-even-gay life behaviour of the two characters a bit? Odd times, odd behaviour. How much of the behaviour in the film is true to the actual individuals, to gay people of that time - or down to straight people's perceptions, also the perversions of wealth? It's difficult to determine and fascinating to watch.

This film has major talent behind it, Soderbergh, Michael Douglas and Matt Damon. And I read that Michael Douglas at one time was a sex addict - of course, the public is at such a distance, who is to know? But these kind of 'facts' and his films certainly present a very straight man to me and then he takes this role and plays it with such relish, even desire. And Matt Damon, the hungry, (well-hung) puppy, happy to be his adopted son, but a little too dim to explain the bizarre relation 'normally' and convincingly to others. Bless.

So, the film is odd to watch, these two bent straights. I couldn't help but wonder how this gay old & young story translates to the straight old & young reality of Douglas' attraction to Catherine Zeta-Jones (and perhaps that's unfair, but as viewer you think these things . . .).

There is an odd (exemplary) scene: morning, showing Damon's young, naked torso in bed as he is about to wake up. When he awakes, the camera pans out to reveal Douglas' leering face alight, eagerly ready to have sex, as though he had been waiting there the whole night. It's extraordinarily lascivious, and on the balance of piss-take / perhaps bizarre reality.

I mention people's perception of gay life earlier, because throughout the film I wondered how much it supported the film (in perhaps correct perception), and then how much was cliche (in the form of generalised 'perceived' notions which can be prejudiced). But of course there is some truth in such perceptions; and particularly with this subject matter: Liberace IS such a case - fur, feathers, crystal, glitter, small puppies everywhere.

So, how to cut through such perceptions and represent 'reality'? In an area where reality is . . . a bit unreal.

Skilfully, Soderbergh, with two great actors, ensures the love in the relationship to come through and this is what saves what could have easily been a dismissable film. It's hard to make a perfect film, and when you chose a larger than life subject (which plays too easily into prejudices) it might be harder. For me, that the love does shine through in this film is the redemptive, AND NECESSARY element raising this film as a kind of document to an extreme aspect of a particular culture. It's a very fine balance (and I kind of giggle when I say that); finesse, subtlety are needed (giggle again).

Both actors are great in the film. For me, I was watching Matt Damon more, his character was more fated, tragic and unrelenting. Michael Douglas certainly threw himself into his role (I wondered how much of himself). It's still mind-boggling, the whole premise of the film - Douglas and Damon should do porn.

Why did I only give 4 stars. As I say, this film is difficult to review properly. In the end I choose gut reaction. The film didn't totally make me think WOW. I think the film's purpose was to represent a reality, it does this well. I can easily be wrong here, but I think a bit more honest dialogue might have made it more reflective of what happened. The film really DOES beg: how close was it to the reality?",1531180800,,3834,4.64306784660767

This movie describes a relationship between Liberace (Michael Douglas) and a young man named Scott Thornson (Matt Damon). The scenes are emotional and instead of a focus on Liberace's music the attention is mostly on Liberace's flamboyant, over-the-top, and (at times) overbearing lifestyle. The Movie does share some important secrets if you are a Liberace fan such as losing his virginity to a Green Bay Packer, the reason he missed so many concerts in the prime of his career, and his religious preference. There is partial nudity however, it's not as dramatic as some reviewers have stated.
