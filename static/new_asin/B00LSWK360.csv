8667849,5,B00LSWK360,"Hernando de Soto's group does great research. They discovered that the frustrations and despair that led to the Arab Spring was not initially about democracy or even genocidal religious bigotry (that is always a cause) NO the men who survived their protest suicide attempts had had their property confiscated by the Islamo-fascist regimes within 30 days of their suicide attempts. It was about property right that could not be secured from arbitrary government thug action. The American news media is not interested in individual liberty unless it is some leftist political angle on a non-existent and trivial sexual-orientation ""issue"" so they didn't report de Soto's important findings. This video helps teach the concept that secure property rights is the basis of civil society.  People cannot see their way clear to investment and reinvestment if they are insecure in their property rights. Why invest in anything if you cannot own it? Answer: people don't. AND secure property rights must begin with legal and governmental institutions, practices and beliefs that are stable, reliable and effective. THIS IS an educational video and a great one.",1407196800,,1151,5.324175824175824
