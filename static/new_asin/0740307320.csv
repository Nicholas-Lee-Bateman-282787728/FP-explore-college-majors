8324340,1,0740307320,"As a former High School Teacher now Homeschooling, I thought it would be a great idea to have the Science experiments viewed before conducting them ourselves. Yikes! The video scores a perfect 10 for being a cheesy and horrible production! It was torture to preview the videos. I will not be showing these to my twins at all! The experiments are clearly useful in further understanding various processes. I suggest you ditch the video. Save your money, and roll with the experiments just using the text and your creativity.",1508630400,,523,4.887640449438202
