3851364,5,B00265T7JC,"""Seinfeld"" was supposed to be a show about nothing - no hugs at the end, no lessons learned - just straight up human frailties. ""Arab Labor"" borrows that aspect of ""Seinfeld"" and marries it to ""All in the Family"" and then ships the whole thing over to Israel. It works completely.

When I say ""Arab Labor"" on LinkTV, I fell out of my chair laughing. I have been waiting for season one and now I shall have it! This is, far and away, one of the greatest sitcoms ever made. It's irreverent, yet playful. True, you need to know some history here and there to get some of the jokes, but it's very accessible comedy - if you don't mind reading along. I'll admit my Hebrew and Arabic aren't up to snuff, but the jokes do translate well enough for me to fall in love with them.

If you have no sense of humor, don't buy this. If you love it when sacred cows become hamburger, then this product is both kosher and halal.",1250208000,21,912,4.235632183908046
3851365,5,B00265T7JC,"I happened to glance at Link TV one day, and this series happened to be on at the time.
Since Hebrew is my mother tongue, I had to watch.
The plot is about the trials and tribulations of Amjad, a journalist of Arab Israeli descent. The show's language is mainly Hebrew with Arabic and English interspersed throughout. In Israel the title Arab Labor, is akin to shoddy labor. It was/is used as a denigrating phrase for Arab capability.
The show is funny and full of heart. Amjad is torn between the respect he owes to his scheming ""old fashion"" father, and to his modern secular upbringing, which brings him closer in spirit to the modern secular Israelis. However, since he is an Arab, he does encounter bias in every turn. How his problems are handled, is the main crux of the plot, and they are handled with love and a great sense of humor.
I highly recommend this DVD to one and all.",1249862400,27,886,4.441717791411043
3851366,5,B00265T7JC,I caught this series when a marathon of it aired on LINK TV.  The characters are all great and each episode is genuinely funny.  It is the story of an Arab family living in Israel.  Controversial subjects like rascism and religion are somehow handled with humor and humanity.  I Highly recommend watching.,1247270400,7,305,4.8076923076923075
3851367,4,B00265T7JC,"This product is mostly in Hebrew, but is subtitled in English.  I was lucky to get an early release copy.  This is the Israeli version of ""The Jeffersons"" or ""Good Times"".  It is groundbreaking as it is a series about a family of Palestinian-Israelis.  A view of Israeli and Palestinian-Israeli life  from the view of an Arab-Israeli.  He is a normal father, husband and son who is trying to fit in to a dual society.  He isn't a confrontational person nor is he controversial, he is just trying to make it through the day and have a normal life.  Not only is this a great glimpse into lives that most Americans and even most Israelis will never see, but it is FUNNY.  It is life, whether it is trying to find a good kindergarten for his daughter or dealing with parents or in-laws.",1247011200,13,782,4.4125874125874125
3851368,5,B00265T7JC,I too came upon this series on Link at my sister's home and immediately adored the characters. I'm Arabic and raised in the US but still hold strong my Arabic roots. I could identify with the love that is shown on both sides as I was raised to understand and respect both Arabs and Israelis and have friends from both cultures. I strongly recommend this series to those who want a greater understanding of how two distinct yet very similar cultures live side by side.,1393804800,4,467,4.5058823529411764

3851371,5,B00265T7JC,This series uses a personable cast and situation comedy to look at real issues of cultural difference and discrimination.

3851373,5,B00265T7JC,"I really enjoyed the first season of this TV series and am looking forward to the second season. I am familiar with the Israeli Jewish and and Arab cultures, so I got all the inside jokes. I am not sure how easy it will be for people unfamiliar with life in Israel to follow all the details, since the characters keep switching between Hebrew and Arabic and many of the jokes and slang don't translate well. Anyway, the show is first rate; it has great acting and hilarious situations plus wonderful commentary about the co-existence of Israeli Arabs and the Israeli Jewish population.",1364428800,3,585,4.689320388349515
3851374,5,B00265T7JC,"This is an utterly brilliant TV series that I believe has taken Israel by storm. It's very much a 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' for Israeli Arabs, especially for those, like our central character, who suffer a deep crisis of identity. It's about time that the Israel/Palestinian conflict, which is ludicrously self-defeating for both peoples, was treated with irreverence and to outlandish comic effect. Incredibly insightful into the foibles and contradictions of Israeli society, it treats the prejudices of both sides in an honest and unpatronizing way. Representatives of both 'sides' are humanised in ways seldom seen by their Israeli or Palestinian counterparts, several being candidly depicted as being far from saintly. The program uses humor to expose the hypocrisy and bigotry that have bedeviled all reasonable attempts at finding a political solution to this continuing Middle East nightmare. I wholeheartedly recommend it, especially to leaders of Hamas and the Israeli government respectively. Maybe they can all watch it, have a good laugh at themselves, shake hands and divide the land into 2 states asap!",1360886400,5,1114,5.445086705202312

3851377,5,B00265T7JC,"As a serious student of comedy, I've exhaustively watched almost all of the best tv comedy series the English speaking world has produced.

There's very little of quality that I haven't seen from the USA, Canada, UK and Australia going back to out of print recordings of the early days of live tv through to the latest cutting edge international web series etc

With that self credentialing, let me say this:  Arab Labor is the best all round comedy series on tv today, one of the funniest currently from any nation, standing up with the very best, reminiscent of Curb Your Enthusiasm, All in the Family/Till death Us Do Part and Sanford and Son/Steptoe and Son (the original British versions and the American remake versions Norman Lear adapted so ably of these classic, heartfelt yet hilarious socially provocative and progressive topical sitcoms), recent Ruth Jones/BBC smash hit border-crossing romantic family comedy Gavin and Stacey, MASH, You'll Never Get Rich (AKA Sgt. Bilko), Father Ted, Mary Tyler Moore/Lou Grant, the Jack Benny Show, The Thick of It of course Seinfeld as well as Classic Era Woody Allen.

It doesn't get better than this, truly laugh out loud funny, relatable, universal, and you'll hardly realize how much you are learning of how little we know about the real everyday ordinary life in Palestine and Israel behind the news.  Guess what?  It's not all politics and fighting, though these subjects are mined for lots of belly laughs and not ignored, for the most part we see the romantic misadventures, hare brained schemes, lovable scam artists, infuriating everyday little problems, families being the way they are the world round.... this show has it all with a flavor that is zany and mad in the best possible way, yet feels real and grounded in authentic social and political truths, realistic depictions of everyday life and real emotion.  All of this light, funny, not depressing but uplifting and always laugh out loud funny.

My one sentence, Hollywood pitch for this show is Curb Your Enthusiasm with heart!  It does more to heal the wounds of the conflict than a thousand agonizing dramas and breathless adrenaline fueled newscasts, and does it all somehow with a tone that is light hearted but darkly funny, universal but specific, purely entertaining yet somehow sneakily educational...

Watching subtitles with a sitcom is a new experience but it's quite easy, the lines are quick and easy to understand.  To get the full comic effect and for easiest comprehension of the foreign elements, I strongly suggest turning the volume way up!

This may seem counterintuitive, to turn up the volume on foreign dialog we don't understand, but it will really help deliver the comedy and emotions of the characters so you can more easily understand the subtitles and hilarious plots!  Trust me, you'll never watch a subtitled foreign language video with the sound low again.

Last word, buy this dvd, part of the profits support the nonprofit link tv that has been airing this show in the USA!  Thanks link for turning America on the best new comedy on TV and one of the best ever.

I think we've only seen the beginning of the great work by this talented writer and his team!

Now I will buy the DVD!",1347062400,5,3233,4.881170018281535

3851382,5,B00265T7JC,"Here is what I wrote in the daily newspaper Haaretz, about Arab Labor in July 2010:

Possibly the easiest thing you will ever be asked to do to better understand Jewish-Arab relations in Israel is watch ""Avodah Aravit"" (""Arab Labor"" ). Television viewing is usually not hard work, but the show, which returned to Channel 2 on Saturday night, makes it effortless because it is blessed with all three of the ingredients required for a top-flight sitcom: excellent ensemble acting with characters we can care about, an infinitely rich subject, and great comic writing.

Three years after the first season was seen by more than a million viewers, with consistently high ratings among Jewish (but not Arab ) viewers, the season premiere thrust us right back into Amjad's world. Amjad (Norman Issa ), a token Arab reporter for a Hebrew newspaper, is repeatedly assigned to write features that only reinforce Jewish readers' stereotypes of Arabs as quaint. He is desperate to enjoy the comforts and freedoms taken for granted by his Jewish colleagues and to be accepted by Jews, but this impossible quest twists his soul into a pretzel.

Writing separates the best sitcoms from the dunghills of mediocrity and ""Arab Labor""'s writing is not only first-rate, but, astonishingly, the work of one man. Sayed Kashua is a triple threat: He is the lone scriptwriter, he is a columnist for this newspaper and his recently released third novel, ""Second Person Singular,"" earned flattering reviews. The tyranny of sitcom rules demanding three jokes per page dooms most scriptwriters to be tediously superficial, but Kashua produces scripts that are authentic, moving and funny as hell.

The genius of ""Arab Labor"" is its ability to use sitcom set-ups to pinpoint both the most banal and torturous dilemmas facing Israel's Palestinian citizens. In Saturday night's episode, Amjad's desire to have sufficient water pressure to allow a decent shower leads him to pop naked into a stranger's bathroom while apartment-hunting - a classic sitcom situation. But when Amjad tries some ""Jewish"" assertiveness at the Water Authority, instead of improved pressure he gets a demolition order.

In real life, Arab citizens of Israel take such Catch-22s so much for granted - they can't get permits because government authorities want them to evaporate, so they build illegally and pray the axe never falls - that Kashua is able to slip the awful threat of losing one's home into family bickering, rather than playing it up as grand tragedy. Amjad's family is more outraged by his naivete than at the injustice of their situation.

Unlike Kashua's persona in his Friday column, Amjad is unaware of the futility of his quest for acceptance, so there is less neurotic despair. Amjad is ever optimistic - and forever being slapped down. His dilemma is the comic engine of the show, a subject that ranks with Archie Bunker and the breakdown of the racial divide, or Hawkeye Pierce navigating the wreckage of war with jokes and flirtation on ""M*A*S*H.""

If there were gripes about the first season, they came from members of the Arab community, where ratings of 5 to 10 percent were far below the Jewish average of 19.1 percent, according to Udi Lion, the show's executive director and director of specialized programming for Keshet broadcasting.

According to Lion, Amjad's sycophantic behavior toward Jews was anathema to the Arab audience, though it was the scheming manipulations of the Abu Amjad character (Amjad's father, played by Salim Dau ) that provoked the harshest response. Some viewers felt mocked, and critics charged Kashua with pandering to Jews (and to Keshet ) by lacerating Arab society and behavior.

""Arab Labor"" does indeed aim for a Jewish audience, focusing more on points of friction between them and Arabs than on internal Arab concerns. Lion, who feels a sense of mission about exposing Jews to the Arab experience in Israel, suggests that Arab viewers may have sensed the series was not intended for them.

It might also be that Palestinian viewers feel too much the victim to see the comedy in ""Arab Labor""; their place too insecure to laugh at the exaggerated archetypes required by sitcoms. But I would dismiss the suggestion that the show aims to please Jews. Jewish characters are skewered regularly for their prejudice, ignorance, power games and hypocrisy, and the series should make Jewish viewers squirm as much as it makes us laugh.

""Arab Labor"" wouldn't be worth watching if it didn't raise some hackles. The strident young Arab human rights lawyer (Mira Awad ), an independent, whip-smart, attractive and highly educated Arab woman who has an on-again off-again, passionate affair with a self-centered Jewish photographer (Mariano Idelman ), breaks all sorts of cultural taboos. Later this season, Amjad's family becomes painfully (and hysterically ) torn between programs for Memorial Day, Independence Day and Nakba Day, whipsawed by their young daughter's desire to fit in at her new Jewish school.

This episode, which I saw in preview, has the potential to evoke the critical element absent from all the hate-filled Knesset histrionics about commemorating the Nakba - namely, empathy. Kashua makes Jewish viewers feel what Palestinian citizens already know: Memorial Day and Independence Day are not for Arabs, whose national tragedy cannot be wished or legislated away.

Of course, to improve Arab-Jewish relations, it's not enough to watch ""Arab Labor."" But until we get off our couches to take some action or meet some Palestinian citizens, at least we can ponder how to create an equitable society in Israel while refining our sense of humor.

3851383,5,B00265T7JC,"My husband and I caught this show by accident when watching LinkTV and were smitten.  It is painfully funny, and its widely-cast net of satire spares no one.  It is an equal opportunity parody, having fun at the expense of all the characters who inhabit that overheated little part of the Middle East.  You would think that someone who locates all the hot button topics afflicting Jews and Muslims and then plays a concerto on them would offend, but the undertone of love and sympathy that runs through this comedy insures that bitterness never trumps laughter.",1310169600,3,561,4.822916666666667

Amjad and Wife (Arab and somewhat Muslim)
Father and Mother of above
Two Liberal Israelis
An Israeli male and Arab female (activist)
