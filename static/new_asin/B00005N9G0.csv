7946643,1,B00005N9G0,"Except for some sexy scenes involving beautiful women in the nude, this
film has nothing to recommend it. John Enos, a professional hunk, doesn't
even look good because he's so oddly groomed. Maybe it's the haircut.  The
script is dull and the budget very low-key. I sympathize with the director,
because he had nothing to work with.",1391644800,,333,4.842105263157895
7946644,4,B00005N9G0,"Plenty of softcore action and beautiful women. Best scene is with Playboy Playmate Katie Lohmann!! She is my all time favorite playmate, so I might not be an impartial judge, but you do get her in all her glory - FFN! And she is spectacular!! This dvd would have gotten 5 stars if they hadn't killed off Katie.",1333152000,,310,4.362068965517241

7946646,3,B00005N9G0,"A beautiful blond female cop investigates a string of murders, all blond victims. Interesting plot twists, keeps you guessing to the end. A  fair number of nude scenes, for the guys. Light entertainment.",1045440000,9,203,5.151515151515151
7946647,2,B00005N9G0,"First of all, Columbia-Tristar released a Shannon Tweed double feature for twenty dollars list price while charging this thirty dollars. Why is that?
On to the story, Shannon Tweed is a cop investigating a serial killer who killed high price prostitutes. She ends up falling in love with the main suspect. Shannon only have a couple love scenes which are OK. The rest of the girls are quite beautiful. But if you expect to see a lot of Shannon you will be disappointed as her first naked scene appears at 43 minutes mark.
The DVD is OK. The full screen picture is decent for this B movie and the sound track sounded like mono but again not much action in this one. Unless you are a diehard Shannon Tweed's fans who have to have this DVD right away, I would suggest you wait until the price drop or get a used copy as this one is not as good as Shannon Tweed's early movies.",1019260800,11,873,4.329268292682927
