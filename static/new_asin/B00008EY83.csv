Cult film sure, but one that deserves to be seen because it's good: very dark comedy.  I first saw Homebodies at The Alley Summer Film Festival in Houston, Tx in the 1970's.  Those summer film festivals are long gone history now, but I still have a great fondness for this film.",1499644800,3,370,4.575757575757576

7982349,5,B00008EY83,"When the elderly tenants of a high-rise apartment building are scheduled for relocation, they refuse to go. Construction is underway, w/ a new building going up right across the street. Even though their building is to be razed in a few days, and the power and water are turned off, they won't budge! One night, they sneak into the new building and sabotage the workers' elevator! This results in the electrocution of several workers, and a fall to their deaths! The police show up and escort everyone out, so they can be moved into a new building across town. Two women are missing! The city representative who evicted them shows up at their old apartment building to look for the two women. She's in for a big, nasty surprise! Things go completely insane from here! HOMEBODIES is a wild horror / black comedy film from 1974. Packed w/ unexpected violence and wicked humor, this movie deserves to be rescued from obscurity...",1378252800,7,926,4.75776397515528
7982350,5,B00008EY83,"Homebodies is a fun movie where the elderly tenants of an apartment building put up a real fight when a large company wants to tear down the building and force the tenants to relocate.  Filmed in Cincinnati, Ohio.",1241654400,5,213,4.605263157894737
7982351,5,B00008EY83,I saw this movie on TV way back when and it has never left my mind! A very weird and scary tale of a bunch of elderly people who live in an old building and a wicked slumlord who wants them out. The elderly take the law into their own hands and do whatever they have to do to keep their homes! Really off the wall film that plays like a black comedy with some horrific moments! WHERE IS THE DVD RELEASE FOR THIS FILM!,1184025600,11,417,3.9176470588235293
7982352,3,B00008EY83,Just today the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that eminent domain is legal for private businesses to take land from homeowners if it increases the tax revenue of a city. This immediately brought my attention to a great old movie I first saw on HBO many years ago. Imagine if the people in New London Connecticut did this to Executives of Pfizer? Thank God it is only a movie. Companies can and do run the government and people can be driven to go postal. That is the premise of the movie. Great acting by the lead character-a little old lady. She's a hoot.,1119484800,9,549,4.392156862745098
7982353,2,B00008EY83,"Homebodies is, in a word, odd. The movie is about a group of senior citizens who are losing their apartment building to a developer who wants to turn the area into a high-end residential area. The seniors decide to fight back and sabotage the construction, becoming more violent as the movie progresses.
The movie is often considered part of the horror genre, but a certain amount of humor leads me to place it into more of a black-comedy area. It's amusing, decently acted, and a bit disturbing, especially the dark ending.",1073520000,6,524,4.769230769230769
