5968262,5,B00F6SAMTA,"From the season premier, I loved this show. What makes it great is the concept. The public isn't being pranked. Instead these four friends are willingly being punished in unthinkable, embrassing ways. It's a great take on pranking that brings levity to the whole situation.

The other thing that makes this show endearing are the guys themselves. Four regular guys being who they are and having fun. You can tell that they are real friends with years of dirt on each other.

Can't get enough Impractical Jokers? Check out thetenderloins.com to see if the guys are coming near you for a live show.

5968264,5,B00F6SAMTA,"Impractical Jokers is so unique. Yes, it is hilarious, beyond funny. They NEVER mail it in and every single joke is truly comical. It is so rare to find a show that doesn't have a ""less-than"" episode or lull. Every episode is very high quality. By the end of watching this, you will be hollering for Larry and wanting scoopski potatoes!! Don't pass this show up!! And if you are wanting more, their comedy act is called The Tenderloins, they tour the US. They also have a Podcast and Sal and Q have their own Podcast, entitled ""What Say You?"" that you can find on iTunes. Be sure to follow them on Twitter and Facebook for constant updates about the show and their live tours. They also have a website: [...]",1384819200,5,708,4.412213740458015
5968265,5,B00F6SAMTA,"This is by far, the funniest, most clever show on T.V. I saw them live in Webster, N.Y., and they were even funnier. I couldn't wait for them to come out on DVD, and I will be waiting and watching for next 2 seasons to come out, and hopefully many more. Murr, Sal, Q and Joe are unbelievable. I wouldn't miss them for the world. I hope they make a fortune, they deserve it!! Go Guys!!!!",1384819200,36,386,4.092105263157895
5968266,5,B00F6SAMTA,"This was a hilarious season and a hilarious series. I did not have a chance to watch this when it originally aired, but have to say that now that this is on DVD I ended up having a hard time putting it down. You will find yourself laughing out loud at the scenarios and the audacity of some of the characters. Now that I have taken the time to watch season one, I am looking for more and you will be too at the end of this! Well done!

5968269,5,B00F6SAMTA,"This has got to be one of the funniest programs ever. I am from the UK so I have only had the chance to watch as many clips on YouTube as possible, so I'm really happy its come out on DVD. The UK version of Impractical Jokers was no where near as funny, the UK comedians were too conscientious (a bit of the British stiff upper lip) so for once it was the americans getting an original tv show ripped off.",1383609600,6,405,4.012345679012346

5968278,5,B00F6SAMTA,"The Short and Sweet Version:
- You'll laugh
- You'll laugh some more
- You'll get to a point where you just can't stop laughing...people will look at your funny but you won't care

Now the long version.
This is the funniest series I've seen in a long time. I love how they're all real friends and that's how it came together because the chemistry and dynamic between the group can be seen. You can't fake this sh*t and that's what makes it so funny. After catching a few episodes on TV, I was hooked and I literally bought every single season and binge watched it. Best decision ever.

If you're looking for mindless humor (the good kind - it's not like Jackass), this is it. The pranks are hilarious and pretty smartly thought about. You just can't help but laugh and it definitely helps when you just need a good pick me up!",1515110400,,826,4.357142857142857

5968287,5,B00F6SAMTA,"The first season of the funniest show on TV.

If you are debating on buying this or spending double for HD, I'm not entirely sure that HD is necessary for the first season. The hidden cameras they used for segments in season one are noticeably inferior in quality to the ones they used in later seasons (look at the White Castle segment in the first episode for an example). It still looks good; I just don't know that HD would make it any better.",1508889600,,447,4.321428571428571

You'll see the jokers still fumbling to find what works and what doesn't in this season, but their willingness to take risks and to make absolute fools of themselves is at an all-time high here. Its like watching four of your friends who somehow fell into getting their own TV show trying to figure out how to make things work.

Each episode is filled with amazing pranks that will leave you in happy tears! I would recommend this show for anyone who likes hidden camera show or show about pranks. The best part of it is these four guys are just real childhood friends. The chemistry really comes alive on the screen. Some shows get worse as years go on, but this show gets better with each season. I always wonder how these guys are able to come up with such fun and creative pranks. I cannot recommend this show enough!
I also want to add that these guys are now traveling all over the country doing standup and the show was one of the best things Ive seen live. We were laughing an entire show! Definitely go see!",1458259200,3,846,4.464516129032258

If you pay attention, you can tell some scenes have been shot a few times and spliced together (most notably the panty punishment for murr), extra actors can be seen in multiple bits wearing the same clothes, every time they do a grocery store bit every customer places their hands or holds the item so the label doesn't show, etc.  still, I think a good chunk is legit, but not all.",1427241600,,554,4.257142857142857

5968609,5,B00F6SAMTA,"""Impractical Jokers"" is one of the most original shows to hit the scene in years. Season One is a bit less polished than the later seasons as the guys try to find their comfort zone, but the ideas for the situations presented are some of the very best. There aren't any bad episodes in the bunch, but there are a few that rise above the rest, and frequently the punishments are the best parts of the show (especially in ""Bellydancer,"" ""Butterfly Crime Scene,"" and ""Out of TP."") There are too many great moments in the season to summarize them all, but I will say that my very favorite ""Impractical Jokers"" moment occurs in ""Drawing a Blank,"" in which the four pose as caricature artists in a mall. The set also contains some extras and commentary tracks, which true fans will appreciate.

The humor ranges from avant-garde to the crass, but there's never a dull moment with Sal, Joe, Q, and Murr.",1406937600,8,896,4.565217391304348

5968631,5,B00F6SAMTA,"Probably the funniest thing I've seen on TV since Kenny vs. Spenny. It manages to be funny without being very vulgar, something that few comedies can pull off.

The DVD itself is ok. I personally only buy Blu-rays unless the DVD is my only option. I would have liked an optional Blu-ray release but this is better than nothing. The image quality is pretty mediocre. It's a hidden camera show on a DVD so it can only look so good considering the format

The show itself is phenomenal though. I'm glad I can support the tenderloins by purchasing this DVD.",1401840000,,553,4.52

Some of the slightly inappropriate segments and comments (though they are brief) make this dad cringe a little to watch with an early teen, but it no doubt mirrors conversations in the halls of any middle school. I have never laughed this hard at anything on TV. I will be sad when I finish the 17th episode and hope Season 2 will be coming out on DVD soon (I prefer DVD over streaming).",1397606400,2,530,4.105769230769231

5968651,4,B00F6SAMTA,"Impractical Jokers is one of the funniest shows I've seen. I'd rate the later seasons 5 stars easily. The only reason this season is rated 4 stars, is that there is a lot of dumb sexual humor in this one. I have a feeling that the producers weren't sure who their target demographic was when they first came out with the show, so they probably told the guys to use a lot of suggestive jokes. In the first episode alone, they talk about hand jobs several times. It's heavy handed. It's just not as funny as when they are being themselves and doing the weird/random stuff that makes the show so great.
For those who haven't seen the show; the premise is four friends put each other in embarrassing and funny situations and whoever can't pull off the required prank has to do something the other three set up at the end of the episode. They usually have a hidden head set on and are required to do weird things in a grocery store or in a park, whatever the other three are telling them to do. For example they have to eat things off of strangers plates in restaurants without saying anything (think the Chinese Restaurant episode of Seinfeld). They have to do seemingly impossible things like ""kiss a stranger's abs"" or clip a stranger's toe nails. Sometimes they have to get people to sign petitions for causes they aren't allowed to see until they lift the paper that the person is supposed to sign, and they have to convince the person to sign it and of course the causes are ridiculous. The punishment for the loser at the end of the show has been for example; being a human pinata, having to open the door of a public bathroom while on the toilet and ask for people in the restaurant to hand them toilet paper, and giving a slide show presentation during which they have no idea what is on the slides because the other three friends have prepared it.
The show is funny because what they are doing isn't just pissing people off, it's confusing people and embarrassing the four guys. Half of what's great is anticipating the person having to go through with a particular challenge. It's also surprising to see how much people will put up with and how rare it is for someone to actually object to the weird stuff they do. Watching unsuspecting people deal with their antics is entertaining.
Generally, the later seasons are ones you could watch with younger family members. I'm glad I didn't try showing my pre-teen cousins this first season though, because I was really caught off guard by the lewd jokes. Glad the guys were allowed to eventually be themselves and tone it down.
Because everyone's sense of humor is different I'll say, I love this show and the humor I like is: Seinfeld, South Park, In Living Color, Curb Your Enthusiasm, The Office, An Idiot Abroad, Kids In The Hall, Arrested Development, Trailer Park Boys, Mad TV, sometimes old Family Guy, Tosh. O, sometimes Jackass (or for the original fans..CKY2K), Big Bang Theory.",1397260800,4,2939,4.578747628083492

This is a must have for any fan of prank shows, it's at the top of the list as far as shows like that are concerned. Four childhood friends Q, Murr, Joe, and Sal prank the public in this hilarious show. In the show they send one of the friends out into the public, whether it's in a mall, park, or grocery store. The three friends that are not in the public eye are hiding behind nearby with headsets telling the other friend what to say to people in the outside world. It's one of those shows that you'd have to see in order to realize just how hilarious it is. It's a very unique show, I've never seen anything quite like it.

Perhaps it's better, because they're allowed to do their thing without many knowing who they are.

If you don't laugh at their shenanigans, then perhaps you've got no sense of humor. They are THAT funny.

While at times it may seem the hosts are called upon to act rudely to unsuspecting victims, no one is seriously harmed, other than the hosts themselves. It is some of these moments in which the hosts fail to complete their assigned pranks and is still amusing even in their failures.",1394323200,,443,4.842105263157895

The only thing I didn't like about the DVD was there wasn't all that much extra content. I was expecting to see hours of stuff cut from the show, but for a lot of it, it was just one persons participation in a challenge, or what have you.

5968694,3,B00F6SAMTA,"So I went into watching the first season of this series with a bit of trepidation. I'll admit that I wasn't in the mood to watch it and that I didn't expect much. I mean haven't we already had enough idiocy after watching numerous years of JACKASS? Did we really need another show that had guys doing stupid guy things that were funny when we were in high school or college?

Imagine my surprise to discover myself laughing as each episode played. Seriously, there were moments when I had to pause the disc so that I wouldn't miss what was said or done next I was laughing so hard. Now, that isn't to say that everything you will see here is hilarious or that it might not be offensive to some, but for the most part it is really funny.

If you've never watched the show we have four friends (Sal, Joe, Q and Murr) who challenge each other with new tasks each week. As a matter of fact they try out several tasks with each episode. As each one either succeeds or fails their task they accumulate points until the end of the show when one is designated the loser who must then perform a task given them by the winner, almost always something totally embarrassing for most people. All tasks are done out in public and as with most shows of this kind you can either get a sympathetic ear from some folks or a belt from others. It's a risk they take but one they do with the hopes of getting laughs and thus viewers each week.

The ""dares"" that each one of these friends comes up with involve some setting up and in some cases the participation of various businesses that will allow them to pretend to be working there. For instance one event takes place in a White Castle where each member must pretend to be a waiter at the counter. The problem is that while doing so they wear an ear bud that the other three are talking into, giving them instructions as to what to say or to do. They can either choose to follow those instructions or ignore them completely thus losing that round. More often than not they follow through.

Another event had them shopping out of other people's carts in a grocery store. One of them goes so far as to take a shopper's entire cart when they aren't looking. They take food off of other people's plates at a buffet, teach a karate class, try to raise money for some odd charities and many other antics. As I said, not all work but most do and the end result is hilarious at times.

So is this series one that you'll want to buy and keep on the shelf? If you had asked me before watching it I would have said no. If you had asked me while I was watching it I'd have said maybe but let me watch some more. At the moment though I think this is a series I'd hold on to. Maybe you'll come home one night, down in the dumps and ready to just kick back. Pop this one in the DVD player and my guess is you'll be smiling shortly after the credits kick in. It will provide some stupid laughs that won't require you to think much or to be too involved. Give it a try.",1393372800,6,2985,4.193379790940766

5968705,5,B00F6SAMTA,I discovered this program on Tru TV while channel-surfing and I've been a fan since.  I have watched some of the episodes many times and I still fall out with laughter. I want to own every single season.,1392854400,,203,4.342105263157895
5968706,5,B00F6SAMTA,"I became a fan of the Jokers through a friend of mine who kept pestering me to watch these guys, and I have NOT looked back. My gauge on how funny people are is if you watch the same comedy over and over and STILL laugh. Watching all these episodes again and you cannot help but fall out of your chair, which is why I would recommend you sit on the floor when watching this DVD. My favorite is ""Old English"" from their first trip to White Castle.....hilarious!!",1392768000,,461,4.25
5968707,5,B00F6SAMTA,"My sister-in-law showed me a few re-runs of this show, and I'm hooked.  I purchased this for her for Christmas, but I've watched every minute of it myself. If you haven't seen this show yet, I definitely recommend purchasing this.",1392681600,,230,4.75

5968709,5,B00F6SAMTA,"Witty, original, totally over the top humor.  These four very funny, very human comedians have been friends a lifetime and they delight in publicly embarrassing each other in this unique reality/comedy series.  Part ""Candid Camera"" part ""Punk'd,"" there are not a whole lot of taboo subjects these guys won't try to make a joke out of.  Various stunts, set-ups and uncomfortable situations called challenges must be endured and instructions must be followed to a tee or that Joker gets a loss.  At the end of each show the joker with the most losses must complete a ""punishment.""  There has not been an episode I've seen in any season in which I have not been in stitches.  If you like to laugh, Impractical Jokers will deliver!

A side note- this is the first time I've purchased a complete season with Amazon on demand streaming.  I was reticent at first, but the experience has been flawless and I will order more entertainment this way in the future.",1392595200,,953,4.733333333333333

I now look forward to Thursday nights like I used to look forward to the weekend! :) The DVD is great too - lots of funny scenes and great commentary.",1392249600,,342,4.276923076923077

The four lifelong friends come up with some crazy pranks they pull on each other, even more amazing is the fact they get permission to pull these pranks in stores that consumers shop in. Shipping was quick fast and packaged well from Amazon. Must buy!",1390521600,,365,4.545454545454546

5968738,4,B00F6SAMTA,"I haven't laughed this hard in a long time.  The antics of these guys and the challenges and punishments they put each other through are mostly creative and hysterical.  My only complaint is that they make crass sexual references and comments in some of the episodes, which I don't find funny, and are not necessary to generate funny reactions from strangers in my opinion. But I strongly recommend this DVD set.",1390262400,,412,4.788732394366197

However, I still wish they would have labeled it somewhere warning me.  I wound up giving it to my brother so my son couldn't watch it, and have been pretending ever since that it ""got lost"". :/ I didn't know what else to do.  Anyway, it's not the product's fault, but I was just explaining why it only got 4 stars. If it were for me, I would have given it 5. It's really hilarious, just not for kids so beware of that.",1389571200,,543,4.046728971962617

I didn't realize when I ordered that this version was uncensored, making it less than desirable for family viewing.

Make an appointment with your doctor and get checked out, please!

Someone else compared it to Jackass - - while it is the same storyline - friends daring each other to do stuff - it's not the same... I would choose Impractical Jokers over Jackass any day.
If there is ever a time you are down in the dumps and need a pick me up - this is your show! It just puts you in a good mood!
I laugh so hard I cry, I laugh so hard I snort!
Awesome show, that's all there is to it!",1388102400,62,544,3.8660714285714284

I did see all the weekly inpractical jokers  (They are so crazy funny), but I got this for my Granddaughter who has been in And out of the hospital for the past months, so as she was getting better she would have this to get some good laughter.

I found it on TruTV purely by accident one night and we have been hooked ever since.  We even went to see them live in NJ and they definitely do not disappoint.  If you are looking for something to watch & laugh hysterically, you need to check these guys out.  I can watch the same episode 100 times and it is funny every time.",1387843200,2,433,3.942528735632184
5968785,5,B00F6SAMTA,A friend recommended this show to me while the first season was airing on TV.  I am so glad he did! I have never watched a show or movie that can make me sit and laugh as hard as this one does. I highly recommend watching this or seeing them live (as The Tenderloins).  I have seen them live twice and seeing them again next month.  Watch this dvd...you won't regret it!!,1387843200,2,371,4.125
5968786,5,B00F6SAMTA,"Love it! If you have a sense of humor, you will love it. If you don't, don't bother! I could watch this over and over and still laugh just as hard every time!",1387843200,2,158,3.8181818181818183
5968787,1,B00F6SAMTA,"Can someone tell me what is so funny about 4 annoying morons, overly happy to dare each other to do stupid things like walk into a grocery store, pluck food from other customers shopping carts and walk off like nothing happened? How is this any different to other lame practical joke shows of the past? In the past, they did not have commentary or microphones attached to the person doing the dare. That's all the difference is between this show and the billion others.

At least the other ones you could see prank/skit/dare piled up one after the other. But now you have to sit there and watch their before, during and after thoughts of the prank/dare they pulled off? This trend started with ""The Weakest Link"" when some moron thought it would be entertainment to film a post video of the person eliminated saying, ""Duhhh, I was not smarts enough to win, I feel sad now, boo hoo"" and it's been rammed down our throat's in so many more shows since. The bottom line is... WHO CARES???????

This show is a waste of time and space. Throwing in the boring interviews, voice overs and social commentary of 4 guys doing things that are not funny to begin with should be a recipe for disaster. Yet somehow it's gone on for 3 seasons? What is going on here? Brain Washing? Cast and Crew have made their own reviews here and elsewhere? Because I can't for the life of me understand how anyone can watch this for more than 2 minutes and not be sickened by how lame what they are seeing and switch over to something more entertaining, like watching paint dry.

These guys do nothing but pretend to have the time of their lives, which I hate, because it's so obviously fake. Then they do a dare that is clearly set up to begin with. Then they talk and pat each other on the back for coming up with their dumb ideas. Fake mock each other in way's that even a preschooler wouldn't be put off by their lame insults..... I can't write about this show anymore. It's just sickening that people could consider this to be good TV.

I expect now I will be flooded by illogical comments saying I must not have a sense of humor? If I said I didn't like Kobe Bryant, I'm sure someone will reply with I must hate basketball, or sports all together? So think before you waste everyones time with replies to this and accept the fact that there are people who don't find this show the slightest bit funny. Compared to Monty Python, Mel Brooks, Zuckers/Abraham trio... heck, even the Wayans Brothers, Trey Parker & Matt Stone, these impractical jokers are about as funny as watching cars rust.",1387584000,5,2565,4.4743589743589745
5968788,5,B00F6SAMTA,"I absolutely love this show. It really takes some intelligence to come up with new and improved ways to embarrass someone week after week. Yet, they manage to do it.

I loved the shipping process and speed. My only down fall is what it was packaged in. The box was not very secure. Things could have easily fallen out, good thing they didn't.

It's nothing like Jackass at all!",1386892800,,329,4.5

5968794,5,B00F6SAMTA,"""The following program contains scenes of graphic stupidity among four friends who compete to embarrass each other"" and it is absolutely hilarious. These guys pull the most absurdly hilarious pranks on complete strangers breaking any social rule they can think of and the responses they get are priceless. There's the incredulous look, the dirty look, and sometimes even they join in on the laughter but all in all the show is a capitalized F unny.

The guys that do this are actually just a group of high school friends that challenge each other to do more and more ridiculous pranks and the show only gets better. Their improvisational skills are outstanding and I couldn't stop laughing throughout. If you haven't heard of it, go out and see it because you will laugh until it hurts. From getting signatures for fake causes to Sal's motivational speaking there's isn't a line that they won't cross to completely and utterly embarrass their friends in front of complete strangers.",1386806400,3,982,4.951515151515151

It is not as gross or mean as Jackass...is it four long time friends that do ""dare"" each other into completing tasks!  Its all in good humor...look at the ratings already!
