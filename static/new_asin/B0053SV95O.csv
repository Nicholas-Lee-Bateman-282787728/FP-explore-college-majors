8455628,5,B0053SV95O,"I bought this without any expectations and I was certainly not disappointed.  While I didn't really love every performance I was mesmerized by Norah Jones , Elvis Costello, Wilco and Everest.  My wife is no fan of Neil's, but she sat through the whole film, which shows me that just how well these songs carried over to a more universal audience.  I'm a follower of electric Neil and his Garage band, Crazy horse, but seeing Ben Harper and the three ladies perform Ohio with a lap steel made my spine tingle..  This show brought me a fresh perspective.  Am I getting old?  Who cares, we loved it, and we'll watch it again.",1316563200,2,622,4.508928571428571
