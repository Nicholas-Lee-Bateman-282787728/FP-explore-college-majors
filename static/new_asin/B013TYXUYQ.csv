7373508,5,B013TYXUYQ,"I have been wwe fan since 1989 to present and Owen hart was one of my favorite wrestlers to watch on tv he was pure entertianment face or heel he was the true best in the world and on  may 23 , 1999 when he died i didn't see the ppv but i heard it on news couldn't beileve it not him why owen why he was the best thing wwe had since bret hart left with other for wcw, I had a hard time watching raw for his tribute he will be missed forever . Now 16 years passed since his death wwe had never done anything for owen because of martha hart his wife who could blame her she loved owen as much as we did as fans but she can still have her hatred for wwe but give his fans what they want  is to honor his legacy and life in wwe this is what dvd/bluray is about . wwe can put this out for fans but if they profit for themselves shame on them we deserve this not mcmahons to pour money in their pockets. i bought to remember owen hart and after watching this i cried because wwe didn't drop the ball they kept to the point they covered as much as they could it was a  terrific job I 've learned something about owen hart i didn't know and you will too. the story will capture your heart make you cry and be bitter towards wwe wondering what really did happen on may 23 1999 we are mad at martha for not allowing us to have memories of him but also feel for her as well as rest of hart family that they suffered more than we did as fans. it was wrong for wwe to do this without martha hart blessing but in a way it helped us remember owen hart like they did not just a wrestler who entertianed but he was a great human being outside this crazy sport  and his life was cut short because a stupid stunt mishap that could have been avoid if wwe wasn't shelfish and triple h was his friend will put him in hall of fame he deserves it for his legacy in this sport not because he died at a ppv because he worked his ass off everyday he was a wwe superstar for his fans and most important his family . rip owen hart wooooooo",1441584000,,2010,3.871359223300971

7373513,5,B013TYXUYQ,I just recently became a huge Owen fan and this dvd is great. It is lacking in running time for documentary but quickly makes it up for the great matches on disc 2 & 3. My favorite is disc 2 because his blue blazer and stampede matches showed off his unbelievable athleticism. All and all it is a great dvd and hopefully they will make an even better one,1459382400,2,354,4.144927536231884

7373518,5,B013TYXUYQ,"I was only 9 year old when the terrible accident happened to the Blue Blazer. I was so intrigued to find out that the Blue Blazer was in fact, Owen Hart, back when I was that young. This DVD is a must-own for any wrestling fan of the Attitude Era. This DVD made me cry, smile, laugh. Made me feel happy, sad, nostalgic, and so honored to have been seen Owen Hart wrestle and entertain! This set includes some great interviews, some of the best backstage stories of Owen Hart being the prankster that he is and so much more.

It's easy to forget what a mark Own made on pro wrestling, completely upstaged by his brother Brett. But he was able to leverage his access and make a great career for himself while entertaining countless wrestling fans.

7373532,4,B013TYXUYQ,"The last few years WWE has brought names back that has had problems with the company (Warrior, Savage, & Brunno come to mind) & it's only natural Owen Hart would be welcomed back. However, don't get to excited as his widow did not this set released & I heard it hurt the documentary portion of the set. I agree as the story seems very uneven & sloppy but still watchable if you grew up enjoying his work. Every WWF superstar seems to have a funny story about Owen as some are told thru out the documentary. They have a bunch of stories as extras but those feel more like deleted scenes. The matches are what to buy this set for & sadly it seems way to brief. A lot of jobber matches, his famous matches (Bret at WrestleMania X, his King of the Ring win, & The Calgary Stampede match), & a few hidden gems. Owen Hart was the first heel I cheered & still remember when he turned on Bret. I'm not ashamed to admit it but I believe I cried when I heard of his tragic death. Christ, I grew up watching this guy's entire WWE career. Overall, I enjoyed this set overall but the documentary & the extra stories were really lacking in my opinion.",1449964800,3,1137,4.220183486238532
7373533,5,B013TYXUYQ,"Owen Hart deserves this and would not have wanted his career buried after his death. He lived the wrestling business and he loved what he did. For all of you bashing the WWE and placing blame ,just remember there are fans out there that want to see OWEN at his best doing what he was great at . Burying his art is a crime. I hope to see more from Owen the King of Harts !!!",1449532800,,373,3.9210526315789473
7373534,4,B013TYXUYQ,"There's so much that can be said in regards to this man from how backstage he was always the highlight of the locker room to him being on the most talented performers in the ring but because of the unfortunate circumstances & aftermath behind his death didn't allow his memory or legacy to be fully celebrated until now here...that man is Owen Hart.  Throughout the presentation you will hear from Owen himself through unseen archival footage along with others such as members of his family (Bret, Natayla, Tyson Kidd, David Hart Smith, Jim Niedhart, Alison, Georgia, Keith, Diana, Ross, Bruce, Smith), Ron Simmons, Road Dogg, Triple H, Jerry Lawler, Vader, Rick Steiner, Billy Gunn, Scott Hall, Terry Taylor, Lex Luger, Mark Henry, Mick Foley, Edge, Rob Van Dam, Daniel Bryan, Koko B. Ware, Sami Zayn, Beth Phoenix, Jim Ross, Kevin Owens & Vince McMahon himself along with clips from an archival interview from the British Bulldog.

Normally I save my summary towards the end but I'll give it now in that I never once referred to this presentation as a ""documentary"" throughout this review because I didn't feel like it was a documentary more than a brief one hour highlight video of his career (like the old Coliseum Video VHS tapes) as we didn't get the heavy in-dept documentary that we're used to in the past in regards to a superstar which was good in some cases such as I didn't want a big amount of time devoted to the details & aftermath of his death when we heard that elsewhere but it did hurt the presentation in other places while the match selection could have been better but I was satisfied with it overall.  The bottom line is that if your looking for a heavy in-depth presentation on both his career & personal life such as the one given for Randy Savage then you won't find it here but if you want a highlight reel of his career & how much he meant to his wrestling peers along with some funny stories then that is what you'll get here but it's something I enjoyed overall & recommend.

The presentation begins discussing Owen going up as the baby of the family doing certain things to entertain that would stay with him throughout his life including what he would do with his toy monkey & pet cat before going into his time in Stampede Wrestling including the story of how he was the ""original"" British Bulldog & became the ""new sensation"" of the territory.  His run as the Blue Blazer was talked about next as far as who the idea of the character was originally for and how his style influenced future superstars along with why the character never took off followed by talking about his wrestling career such as the brief time in WCW then his return in WWE in various tag teams before heavily going into his famous heel turn & family feud against Bret with such details as who was the original family member that spot was for along with what was done both in front & behind the scenes to play it off so well & looking back at their WrestleMania X match.  His various accomplishments throughout his career was discussed next from how becoming the ""King Of Harts"" allowed him to showcase his real personality & have fun, his tag team championships teams with Yokozuna & British Bulldog, Intercontinental Champion, and how he made the Slammy Award his greatest prop to the point where he's still associated with that award to this today followed by his family reunion of the Hart Foundation & the emotional Canadian Stampede event before things started to change for the worse & why he stayed behind when the rest of family left.  The presentation concluded discussing the rest of Owen's career in WWE including why he went back to the Blue Blazer character, the memories of reaction when finding out his death & the tribute show, the irony behind who his last match was with not only behind the scenes at that time but coming full circle around a decade later, and his legacy to the point where one superstar admitted that he named his own child after him.  You get bonus stories called ""Owen Tales"" as a bonus throughout the presentation where were short stories on Owen such as the prank call Owen did on his father during WrestleMania weekend, prank phone calls he did late night to other superstars, the one time he double crossed Lex Luger, where Owen put the animals from the hog pen match, his unique relationships with fans, and why Scott Hall dubbed him ""The King Of Carry On.""

Matches Include:
Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Championship Match vs. Viet Cong Express #1 - Both men started off on the mat chain wrestling with both men working over the same specific part of the body along with having counters & reversals to his opponent's offense along with other submissions in what was a heavily mat wrestling based match.
""Stampede Wrestling"" Dec. '86

North American Heavyweight Championship Match vs. Makhin Singh - It should be noted that Singh is the wrestler known by other gimmicks elsewhere such as Norman The Lunatic (WCW) & Baston Booger (WWE) as this was mostly a showcase of Owen's aerial tactics doing moves that were either rare or never seen before such as executing a backflip of his opponent's head & another move that would become more famous 18 years later by Rey Mysterio along with a heavy arsenal of moves coming off the top rope.
""Stampede Wrestling"" May '88

Blue Blazer vs. George South - This was Blazer's debut & strictly a showcase of his unique offense at the time executing different moves like a variety of suplexes to where he left his feet various times going aerial.
""Wrestling Challenge"" Sept. '88

Blue Blazer vs. Mr. Perfect - Perfect kept taking Blazer down early on causing Blazer responding with offense sending Perfect to the outside as each man attempted the same strategy by stopping & slowing the pace down when each man started to gain momentum with Perfect attempting to keep the action grounded avoiding high risk maneuvers while Blazer did execute like some aerial offense along with others that ended up landing as expected in a solid encounter.
May '89

vs. Mark Kyle - This was one of the rare appearances of Owen in WCW that was pretty much an offensive showcase with him using different moves that would later become his trademarks along with different aerial maneuvers from all parts of the ring.
""World Championship Wrestling"" Mar. '91

vs. WWE Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels - Owen focused heavily on working over a specific body part utilizing his entire offense around that area to the point while Shawn resorted to taking shortcuts & taking advantage of distractions to have the advantage in what was a short back & forth contest.
""Wrestling Spotlight"" Aug. '93

vs. Bret Hart - They started off by trying to one-up each other in the beginning with Owen having some very entertaining taunts towards Bret before both men ended up exchanging slaps to each other. This went into a very technical match as Owen worked over Bret's back after ramming it into the steel post, doing a variation of the camel clutch, and even doing the infamous piledriver that he did to Steve Austin years later. The target would eventually turn towards Bret's knee with Owen using the figure four & hurting it even more with the ring post. Bret gained momentum back & we even had a battle of the sharpshooters before Owen was able to get one step ahead of Bret (literally) and have what was without a doubt the breakthrough performance of his career with Lawler quoting the moment perfectly, ""He didn't step out...he jumped out of the shadow.""

King Of The Ring Tournament Finals vs. Razor Ramon - Owen showed he was wasn't intimidated by Razor by slapping him right away causing Razor to respond by showing his heavy power advantage with various slams & side headlock takeovers before Owen caught Razor with his own spinning heel kick & abdominal stretch. Razor went for the Razor's Edge at one point only for Owen to counter with a backdrop that sent Razor over the top rope to the floor when someone who already made an impact in the WWE Championship match earlier in night came out to once again be an impact player leading to the birth of ""The King Of Harts.""
King Of The Ring '94
[Best Of King Of The Ring]

Lumberjack Match vs. WWE Champion Bret Hart - Bret came into this match more aggressive & physical than usual while taking advantage of the stipulation tossing Owen to the outside while Owen resorted to dirty tactics that would normally cause a disqualification along with the lumberjacks in his corner having a different effect & being more physical that heavily effected the match to the point where it caused Bret & his lumberjacks to ""give them a taste of their own medicine"" in a solid match made more entertaining with how the stipulation played out.
Aug. '94

Exhibition Match vs. Nick Barberri - This was just a quick exhibition match in New York City's Times Square to promote his upcoming tag match at WrestleMania that's only noteworthy of who decided to come out afterwords when Owen made some comments that not everyone liked.
""WrestleMania XI Public Workout"" Mar. '95

WWE Tag Team Championship Match w/Yokozuna vs. Allied Powers - For those who don't remember, the team of Allied Powers were the British Bulldog & Lex Luger doing his ""Made In The U.S.A."" gimmick at the time while it should also be noted that both men had history with one another with Owen & Bulldog being brothers-in-law while Luger & Yokozuna feuded for the WWF Championship around 2 years earlier. There was a moment of miscommunication early in the match between Owen & Yokozuna when Luger was able to knock Yokozuna down only for him to end up falling on Owen's foot but they were able to recover & work over the Bulldog. The hot tag was eventually made to Luger as both men were able to use their strength to do a double team back suplex to Yokozuna before Owen Hart was able to be the deciding factor in the match. This was a good tag match.
""In Your House"" July '95

vs. Shawn Michaels - This was the return match from their match on RAW (on the RAW 15th Anniversary DVD set) after Survivor Series that caused Shawn Michaels to be out of action for several months with the special stipulation that if Owen Hart gains Shawn's WWE Title shot at WrestleMania if he wins the match. Shawn made an entrance here that was more of a teaser for the entrance he would have at WrestleMania the next month. The opening moments was typical ""Shawn being Shawn"" showing how his charisma & having fun at the expense of Owen and even doing some comedic cheating such as pulling hair behind the referee's back. From there it went into a nice match between both men as it was good quality that you would expect from both wrestlers.
""In Your House"" Feb. '96
[Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 90's]

vs. Mankind - It should be noted that both mangers (Clarence Mason & Paul Bearer) were at ringside with Owen taking the fight right to him with Mankind coming back by ripping & tearing away at Owen's face as both men got more aggressive as the match went on with both men resorting to such tactics like biting & headbutts along with any object they could get their hands on around ringside in what was a rare match of two non-fan favorites facing off but resulted in one of Owen's most aggressive matches.
""RAW"" Jan. '97

WWE European Championship Tournament Finals vs. British Bulldog - This was the tournament finals in the country of Germany for the first new (active) championship introduced in close to 20 years with both Owen & Bulldog being current tag team championship partners. Both men had a series of counters & reversals early on while continuing to show respect towards each other before Bulldog was able to gain control using his power & focusing on the arm before Owen resorted to dirty tactics & using Bulldog's momentum against him on more than one occasion while working over the midsection with them continuing to go back & forth with different counters using variations of the same offense against each other in what was a very scientific encounter.
""RAW"" Mar. '97
[Best Of RAW: 15th Anniversary; Hart & Soul: Hart Family Anthology]

vs. WWE Intercontinental Champion Rocky Maivia - Hart Foundation members Bret Hart & British Bulldog were on the stage as Owen dedicated the match to his injured brother with Owen attacking from behind only for Rocky to recover & work over the arm only for Owen to use his momentum against him focusing on his leg area as they traded momentum throughout the rest of this solid encounter.
""RAW"" Apr. '97

w/Hart Foundation vs. Steve Austin, Ken Shamrock, Goldust, Legion of Doom - The Hart Foundation returns home to Canada for this main event where they were received a hero's welcome from the crowd with members of the Hart Family sitting front row ringside. This was a wild & emotional tag team match just based off the environment alone that had various highlights like Austin & Bret starting out, Austin constantly showing that he thought Canada was #1, Pillman mocking Shamrock & paying for it, Bulldog showcasing his power various times, the constant teamwork of the Hart Foundation including classic tag team moves from the original Foundation in Bret & Niedhart, Austin resorting to using a weapon to take out Owen Hart only for Bret to give a receipt, Pillman making an ass of himself at one point, all out brawling between both teams in & outside of the ring, and Austin trying to fight the entire Hart family. This was a great tag team match from the action in & out of the ring to the hot crowd throughout the match to the emotional aftermath with all the Hart family in the ring together which Bret Hart has testified to himself saying it was the last time their entire family was united together.
""In Your House: Canadian Stampede"" July '97
[Brian Pillman: Loose Cannon; Hart & Soul: The Hart Family Anthology; Best Of In Your House]

vs. Goldust - This was originally set to be a European Championship match against Triple H but he was injured & sent ""Hunter-dust"" as a replacement (while I got a laugh at Luna being Chyna) with Goldust attacking from behind only while being able to keep cutting off any momentum when Owen attempted to mount it by keeping him grounded & taking shortcuts only for Owen to come back with his high flying & trademark offense with the bigger picture being the aftermath & how things ended up backfiring for someone.
""RAW"" Jan. '98

Dungeon Match vs. Ken Shamrock - This match took place in the infamous ""Hart Family Dungeon"" with Dan Severn as the referee & the only way to win is by submission.  Both men chain wrestled early with Shamrock using a ground & pound offense while Owen resorted to his unique wrestling style such as a spinning heel tick & german suplex along with dirty tactics as both men attempted some moves that would have worked in a regular ring but backfired in this small environment but also took advantage of their surroundings using the walls & even putting one man's head through the ceiling at one point as this was a short match but definitely unique for it being the first (and only) match of it's kind.
""In Your House: Fully Loaded"" July '98

vs. Edge - While Edge made his PPV debut the month before in a mixed tag match, this was his first PPV singles match along with it being a rare combination of 2 canadian wrestlers facing off against each other on a PPV behind held in their home country. Both men traded holds early with Edge going after Owen's arm while showing some athleticism with a dropkick & frankensteiner before Owen was able to keep catching Edge on the outside with a powerslam on the floor & in the ring release belly to belly while going aerial himself with a top rope dropkick. They continued to trade momentum & kept countering each others offense including a moment straight out of WrestleMania X that resulted in a solid encounter between both men but the main story behind this match was the appearance of someone who would forever be linked to Edge.
""In Your House: Breakdown"" Sept. '98
[Edge: Decade of Decadence]

(Blu-Ray) Blue Blazer vs. Red Rooster - Bobby Heenan wasn't in Rooster's corner for this match as Blazer came out with a different strategy than expected with a grounded style while Rooster attempted the same but took shortcuts whenever possible as Blazer continued to use offense like a submission & eventually going aerial while Rooster singled out a body part heavily working over it & stopping his opponents attempt at momentum dead in it's tracks in a solid encounter between two skilled wrestlers once you get past their gimmicks.
""Madison Square Garden"" Dec. '88

(Blu-Ray) vs. 1-2-3 Kid - This was the semi-finals of the tournament with Kid coming into the match less than 100% with a hurt neck due to a post-match attack from Jeff Jarrett earlier in the night with Owen starting the match before the bell attacking Kid during his entrance with an aerial offense only for Kid to match it with his own along with his martial arts kicks before Owen was able to counter & deliver impactful offense of his own focusing on the back neck in a fast paced match full of non-stop action & the best match quality wise in the tournament.

DVD extras include several bonus stories of Owen's various pranks involving other superstars, how he helped his sister & her kids, how he got his first WWE match in his rookie year, how certain WWE superstars knew as a kid that Owen was the Blue Blazer, who did he personally fly into WrestleMania XII, what he did for his late nephew Matthew after he passed away, various memories of the European Title match against British Bulldog, how Owen didn't take things too seriously, stories of being cheap including a competition with Mick Foley, how he played a role in some of Beth Phoenix's important moments & matches of her career, and how past & present superstars pay tribute to Owen throughout their careers while other Blu-Ray extras where the tribute videos that aired throughout the ""RAW IS OWEN"" tribute show.

I already gave my summary at the beginning but the bottom line is that this was a nice highlight video of Owen Hart that I would recommend.",1449360000,4,18278,4.666770186335404

Why now 16 years later????
oon yeah stupid me money the WWE needs cash flow

Owen Hart's widow has said publicity she knew nothing about this release!
At first i was all for this until the info came out about his widow
Now i don't care and will not support this
The WWE and the McMahon family have profited off  plenty  of misery & death
the WWE and Vince make Don King look like Jesus Christ
and King did some terrible shady things throughout the years
more so-called Attitude era fans should take a stand against a company that don't give a damn about you
They only care about there stock holders and trying to buy there way into the  U.S. Senate
Thank God  the people of Connecticut didn't buy into the McMahon's grift
Not even the phony slimy Republicans wanted to get in bed with the McMahon's
That speaks volumes

I Love Owen Hart his death made me realize what a mickey mouse operation the WWF was/is
They got away with murder
If you wanna see a true biography on Owen Hart get the Hitman Hart Wrestling with Shadows dvd it has a bonus
A&E Biography on Owens Life and death it's heartbreaking and very sad
This new biography by the WWE is gonna be slanted and pure WWE  in the bubble BS
Why don't the WWE just go all the way and put Owen death on this set
Shock and Awe sells we all know the WWE has no moral high ground
Vince has that PPV locked away somewhere in Titan Tower

Not gonna buy this gonna stick to my guns
before you whip out your credit card and pre-order this dvd/br
think about this

7373536,1,B013TYXUYQ,"Bret Hart has been doing the interviews calling Martha Hart selfish and cold-hearted for not supporting this release and blocking the use of family photos. Since I've read her book and the details on this situation, I felt the need to present her side of the story for the people who may not know it.

Vince McMahon and the WWE are directly responsible for Owen's death. It wasn't bad luck or a tragic mistake that could have happened to anyone. They were incompetent to the point where a man lost his life. And the last thing Martha wants is for that same company to continue to profit off of his memory and likeness.

""While Sting regularly rappelled from the ceiling in WCW and Owen had done so a few times as The Blue Blazer, those were all done using a system that involved a backup cable and locking carabiner (mountain climber style harness), which was the standard, safe way to rappel. Here, the WWF had requested the use of a quick release cord (which it turned out was not approved for stunt use) so Owen could get out of the harness quicker when the stunt was over. Bobby Talbert, the stunt rigger, had been told that the reason for the change was that Vince McMahon was unhappy with how long it took to get out of the mountain climbing harness.

The investigation done by Martha Hart's lawyers revealed that the WWF had been using another rigger for years who always used the industry standard locking carabiner system. He recalled that they had asked him on multiple occasions to use a quick release, which he always refused for safety reasons.

When his $5,000 fee was deemed over budget by the WWF's Steve Taylor for the May 10, 1999 Raw in Orlando, he told his assistant to offer to do it for $2,000 because he feared a local rigger would use the quick release WWE had requested. The stunt was cancelled, and they were told they'd be contacted ""next time,"" but they weren't contacted for the Kansas City stunt. They had never heard of the rigger used at Over the Edge, who was, in fact, based out of Orlando.""

The show continued after his accident and they capitalized on his death with a Raw Is Owen special the night afterwards.

And it doesn't stop there. WWE courted members of the Hart Family to be on their side publicly when it became clear that a lawsuit was going to happen. Ellie Hart, who most wrestling fans know from Total Divas as Natalya's mom, stole legal papers from Helen Hart and faxed them to the defense. They also tried to get Stu Hart to show up ringside at Raw while the lawsuit was still on going.

Asking Martha Hart to set aside her feelings and everything that's happened so wrestling fans can see a WWE revisionist history documentary is crass. She lost her husband. Her kids lost their father. All over a stupid stunt that could have been done safely.

Owen Hart was first and foremost a family man, not a professional wrestler. He'd fly directly home after a run of show and take the latest possible flight out so he could spend the most time at home with his wife and kids. Wrestling was his way to provide for them. That is the man Martha Hart wants remembered. If the WWE wanted to honor his memory, they would respect her wishes.

When my contract is up, Im out of wrestling. Ive made plans. Ive been smart with my fiscal affairs. Financially, Ill be set. I really want to devote a lot of time to my family. Ive bought some property on a lake. I plan on doing a lot of boating and fishing. I want to continue to stay in shape. And who knows, I might do ten weeks a year in Japan. Something just to motivate me to keep in shape, keep involved a little bit but not have to deal with the politics, the pressures that are so intense right now. Ive paid my dues for twelve years now. If I continue for five more, thats seventeen years working at a pretty hard clip. I think that at that point my family, my wife and kids, have been compromised enough - Owen Hart

His life was centered around his wife, Martha, his one and only childhood sweetheart, and his two beautiful children, Oje and Athena. I recall, so often, in airports, hotel rooms, dressing rooms, long drives on endless highways, his only dream was to come home to his wife and his two children. So many times, I remember he sprinted from the door of the plane, his two carry-on bags in each hand, at a full run, worn out and weary, just to clear customs, through the sliding doors, to their outstretched arms - Bret Hart

Owen was a great guy. He didn't take the business too seriously. He didn't take anything too seriously  except his family. And he kept a lot of his life personal. Owen saw this [just] as a career where he could make some money, take care of his family. Then hed was done with it. But he was a good friend to a lot of the guys, very funny, always playing a joke on somebody. Ive been in the ring with Owen and he was unbelievablean unbelievable talent. So much so, that sometimes he would go out and have a bad match on purposeto make himself laugh. You know what I mean? Because he would think it was funny - HHH

I would like to kind of just disappear, from wrestling fans and stuff. I don't want to forget the fans and what theyve done. Theyve supported me and stuff, but at the same time, Id like to just  I don't want to be hanging on like one of these wrestlers whos sixty years old, saying, Hey, Im a wrestler. Let it go. Make your money out of it and get on. Going out and performingits an art. Id like fans to remember me as a guy who would go out and entertain them, give them quality matches. Not just the same old garbage every week - Owen Hart",1443139200,10,5588,4.340038314176245
7373537,1,B013TYXUYQ,"Bret Hart has been doing the interviews calling Martha Hart selfish and cold-hearted for not supporting this release and blocking the use of family photos. Since I've read her book and the details on this situation, I felt the need to present her side of the story for the people who may not know it.

Vince McMahon and the WWE are directly responsible for Owen's death. It wasn't bad luck or a tragic mistake that could have happened to anyone. They were incompetent to the point where a man lost his life. And the last thing Martha wants is for that same company to continue to profit off of his memory and likeness.

""While Sting regularly rappelled from the ceiling in WCW and Owen had done so a few times as The Blue Blazer, those were all done using a system that involved a backup cable and locking carabiner (mountain climber style harness), which was the standard, safe way to rappel. Here, the WWF had requested the use of a quick release cord (which it turned out was not approved for stunt use) so Owen could get out of the harness quicker when the stunt was over. Bobby Talbert, the stunt rigger, had been told that the reason for the change was that Vince McMahon was unhappy with how long it took to get out of the mountain climbing harness.

The investigation done by Martha Hart's lawyers revealed that the WWF had been using another rigger for years who always used the industry standard locking carabiner system. He recalled that they had asked him on multiple occasions to use a quick release, which he always refused for safety reasons.

When his $5,000 fee was deemed over budget by the WWF's Steve Taylor for the May 10, 1999 Raw in Orlando, he told his assistant to offer to do it for $2,000 because he feared a local rigger would use the quick release WWE had requested. The stunt was cancelled, and they were told they'd be contacted ""next time,"" but they weren't contacted for the Kansas City stunt. They had never heard of the rigger used at Over the Edge, who was, in fact, based out of Orlando.""

The show continued after his accident and they capitalized on his death with a Raw Is Owen special the night afterwards.

And it doesn't stop there. WWE courted members of the Hart Family to be on their side publicly when it became clear that a lawsuit was going to happen. Ellie Hart, who most wrestling fans know from Total Divas as Natalya's mom, stole legal papers from Helen Hart and faxed them to the defense. They also tried to get Stu Hart to show up ringside at Raw while the lawsuit was still on going.

Asking Martha Hart to set aside her feelings and everything that's happened so wrestling fans can see a WWE revisionist history documentary is crass. She lost her husband. Her kids lost their father. All over a stupid stunt that could have been done safely.

Owen Hart was first and foremost a family man, not a professional wrestler. He'd fly directly home after a run of show and take the latest possible flight out so he could spend the most time at home with his wife and kids. Wrestling was his way to provide for them. That is the man Martha Hart wants remembered. If the WWE wanted to honor his memory, they would respect her wishes.

When my contract is up, Im out of wrestling. Ive made plans. Ive been smart with my fiscal affairs. Financially, Ill be set. I really want to devote a lot of time to my family. Ive bought some property on a lake. I plan on doing a lot of boating and fishing. I want to continue to stay in shape. And who knows, I might do ten weeks a year in Japan. Something just to motivate me to keep in shape, keep involved a little bit but not have to deal with the politics, the pressures that are so intense right now. Ive paid my dues for twelve years now. If I continue for five more, thats seventeen years working at a pretty hard clip. I think that at that point my family, my wife and kids, have been compromised enough - Owen Hart

Owen was one of the most gifted wrestlers I have ever seen his legacy deserves to be remembered he was one of a kind and he had the best spinning heel kick ive ever seen anyone do. REST IN PEACE Owen James Hart 1965-1999. I think this dvd will exceed expectation no matter if they cant use pictures or footage of him when he was young training or even baby pictures I am intrigued to see this and cant wait for it.",1442880000,6,652,4.062015503875969
