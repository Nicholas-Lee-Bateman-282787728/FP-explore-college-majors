3905460,5,B002C8YSB0,I love this movie! It came in the mail on time with no problems what so ever. The disc and the case were in great condition to!,1359936000,,127,3.740740740740741
3905461,5,B002C8YSB0,"Good movie, just not the same as the old Warren Miller Movies. But if you can appreciate spectacular outdoor adventure filming and you're okay with change, then you'll enjoy this one!",1295308800,2,183,4.935483870967742
3905462,5,B002C8YSB0,"Great video, classic Warren Miller.  Awesome Blue Ray quality and theater sound makes this a must have for skiers and snowboarders.  I have seen most of Warren Miller films and this one is very unique with the stories and adventures.  Highly recommended.",1268092800,,254,5.0
3905463,1,B002C8YSB0,"The joy of all earlier Warren Miller movies was the crusty commentary by Miller. He doesn't do it any more and in its place is a banal, high volume thumping music and stupid commentary. I would advise missing this movie.",1264204800,2,220,4.525
3905464,2,B002C8YSB0,"As another reviewer says, Warren Miller is no longer involved in Warren Miller movies and it shows. One things you could always count on in Warren Miller films was lots and lots of great skiing action. In this one, most segments feature more talking than actual skiing! It's unfortunate because what skiing they do show looks absolutely jaw dropping in HD.",1262563200,,356,4.852459016393443
3905465,4,B002C8YSB0,"My husband and I are huge fans of the Warren Miller films.  When Johnny Mosley started to narrate in previous films we were like this sucks.  He gets better and better every film.  Although we do miss Warren so so much.  Great film as always.  I am from NH and ski at Okemo a lot as my season pass is good there, I really hate how they make it look like the Wobbly Barn (where the band does their gig) is at Okemo, it is really at Killington.  The skit with Jason Biggs was drawn out and cheesy.  I love the ski joring part, so awesome!  Can't wait to see what next years film will be.  Enjoy!",1262563200,2,593,4.0
3905466,3,B002C8YSB0,"It is sad that this title was sold by his kid to a company that doesn't really get it. They probably didn't like the production costs and they certainly don't have the sense of humor. I'm sorry that this is one of the few of this series in Blu-Ray, because it does not live up to expectations. The key year is 2004, before that Warren Miller was the man in charge, now it is ""Time, Inc"" and you might just as well buy any other skiing movie.

I was disappointed in the film, it lacks the life of the Miller films, that made me go and search the net to see why it has all gone wrong. Save your money and hope they re-issue the old movies.",1261094400,2,637,4.015748031496063
3905467,3,B002C8YSB0,"The latest episode from warren miller is good, but not outstanding. Missing the narration of warren, who always had a good scense of humour. Also has a section which features Jason Biggs (american pie fame) and a band (cant think of the name) which goes on a bit long.",1257033600,3,268,4.489795918367347
3905468,4,B002C8YSB0,"Ah disappointing to receive this disc and to find its 1080i, although the picture is great but 1080p is what blu ray is all about?

Also the cover says 5.1 True Hd but its 2 channel*** see below

Great snow action, shame about the 1080p, but still worth the buy.

edit, ive since upgraded my oppo player and this disc is 5.1 true hd, apologies, buy this movie its not the corny Warren Miller of old
it appeals to all ages and makes you keen for winter!",1256601600,,452,4.172413793103448

8363720,5,B002C8YSB0,"This is CD contains the great photography you would expect from a Warren Miller CD.  The scenes on skijoring take place in Leadville, CO.  Actually I was at the skijoring event at the time these particular shots were taken.  This event is hard to capture on camera, and of course, this CD captures the action, drama and beauty of the horses and riders perfectly!  The CD covers a wide range of winter action shots that will keep the viewer interested throughout.  I recommend this CD and taking a winter trip to the Rocky Mountains during the first week of March to see the skijoring event yourself!",1418947200,,599,4.613207547169812
8363721,5,B002C8YSB0,I got this for my son for his birthday as he loves skiing (I'm a knuckle-dragger). Warren Miller films are always fun and we both watch it every morning before we hit the slopes.,1394150400,,178,4.264705882352941
8363722,5,B002C8YSB0,"Warren Miller is the man, no if and or buts about it.  If you want a good film to pop on and watch with some friends or want some cool cinematography this is the film for you.",1368748800,,175,3.72972972972973
8363723,4,B002C8YSB0,"Does anyone know if this movie has a soundtrack? I've looked and I can't find one.. *shrugs* It's aggravating since there is music on here that I like. Also does **anyone** have any idea what song has the following lyrics? It sounds kind of like a country-ish song but I'm just not sure. A few of the lyrics are, ""He says words like Dog I'm down with that..."" If anyone has any idea please drop a note.

Thanks everybody!
Have a great weekend,
Kate  :o}",1365724800,,453,4.317647058823529
