5011897,5,B006P2TA44,i havnt seen this in years and i finally found the entire series in one shot the box set got here very quick and with no damage anybody trying to find this series i highly recommend watching it,1331683200,2,193,4.105263157894737
5011898,5,B006P2TA44,I liked the series and it was cooler than Star Treck. I like the cast and the way the series was made. It was nice to have show about space that was in my adult time. I saw Star Treck when I was a kid. I had a great SI FI series to watch. It took me a few weeks to watch and was sad that I ran out of episodes. I watched the whole series in a few weeks. I was rooting for all of the characters.,1330560000,3,394,3.4886363636363638
5011899,3,B006P2TA44,"Video not even VHS viewable in some parts of all episodes, maybe on a 19"" Tube TV it would look good but not on a 55"" LCD/LED TV.

5011900,5,B006P2TA44,"Love this show!  My family are sci-fi fans but we were unable to watch this series when it aired because of having a young child.  We've only seen the 1st disc on Season 1 but we already love it.  Can't wait to see the rest of the series.  If you liked Star Trek, Babylon 5, etc. you'll love this Series!",1325289600,19,304,4.016666666666667
5011901,3,B006P2TA44,"The version shown here in the photo at the time of this review is the Australian Import for NTSC and is region zero. You might notice on arrival of the product that the box and dvds are marked Region 4, PAL but they are not.

The issues: It appears as if the Australians are taking their PAL version of the series and running a PAL to NTSC conversion on the files and then putting them back to DVD. The best way to make the DVD is to use an original NTSC version. Becuase of the way this is done this version has some interlace issues in some scenes and some frame skipping issues from the frame blending during the conversion.

I purchased this to see the show, which I have heard a lot about but have never watched so for me this is perfect. But for the collector you might want to seek out one of the USA made versions. I played this on a newer Sony Blu Ray player, I can see where some older DVD players might actually have trouble with these discs.

So the 3 star review is for the product, not for the show.",1317081600,93,1013,4.106060606060606
5011902,5,B006P2TA44,Andromeda is more creative than the Star Trek: Enterprise.  It's harder sci-fi than Farscape - which is more fantasy than science.  Andromeda has cooler characters than Star Trek: Deep Space 9.  Its interpersonal relationships and humor seems more natural than Star Trek: The Next Generation.  Roddenberry's wife did a great job of producing it.,1309996800,6,345,5.333333333333333
5011903,3,B006P2TA44,"This package collects all five seasons of Andromeda, the well-known sci-fi series.  The original idea was proposed by Star Trek developer Gene Roddenberry, and there are certain similarities -- particularly the heroic captain with an enlightened vision of the future.  The premise of the series also bore some resemblance to Isaac Asimov's Foundation novels, in that the goal is to rebuild a fallen civilization.  The format was primarily episodic, although the seasons also contained long story arcs.  The results were however mixed at best.  Visually, the series was impressive, due to the extensive use of computer-generated special effects.  The scripts were, unfortunately, very uneven.  The first season was marred by implausible, overly complex plots that were intentionally philosophical but also rather pretentious.  In the second and third seasons, with a new producer in place, the scripts became more direct and entertaining.  Toward the end of the third season, the plots again became incoherent, and seemed to wander, as though the producers could not decide what to do with the premise.  The fourth season revived some of the ideas that had been used in first, with varying degrees of success.  The result was a series that was strangely uneven, with some good ideas and some glaring failures.",1308873600,14,1308,5.300970873786408
5011904,4,B006P2TA44,"Ok, so let's get down to business.  First of all, I got the Slipstream edition, but minus a few features and the box art, it's the same exact thing.  If you love this show, you should buy this series.  When I got the slipstream edition, the packaging was pretty much trashed.  However, after I called Amazon, they gave us a pretty big refund in compensation for this.  At that point, I could care less about the box.  The DVDs and cases themselves were fine, and they work amazingly well.  Truthfully, you start to hate the navigation menu, but now I am just rambling on about semantics.  Here's the bottom line.  If you like Andromeda, get either this or the slipstream Ultimate collectors edition.  If you don't, then move on.  4/5 stars, -1 for packaging, but still worth it!!!!",1305590400,7,781,4.586956521739131

5011925,2,B006P2TA44,"I really wanted to like it.  The first two episodes were somewhat entertaining.  You can see right away, its not to be taken to seriously, and is actually pretty dumb in many cases (like lost in space dumb).  The aliens look pretty stupid.  Must be one of the worse budgets in a long time.  Ship looked okay, special effects, I can live with.  I got past all that, and thought, okay, I can watch this goofy show.  I liked the idea behind the show, and Kevin S, is cool.  However, episode 3 was just too STUPID.  I was okay with the Mad Max Theme (from beyond the Thunderdome), but really Kevin and crew acted dumber than the kids.  They just destroy a solar system, and Kevin is still playing nice.  They don't even give his vampire friend an escort with all these crazy kids, esp after what they just did??  They get their ship taken over by these dumb kids who don't really know anything, and made to look like fools.  It was a bit much.  I mean these kids can't even read, but they can destroy a star, and know all about jamming.  What a load of BS.  I just lost interest immediately.  If you like dumb, this show is for you.  Its amazing it made it through 5 seasons.  I mean was this playing during Saturday morning cartoons?  1 star for Gene R.  1 star for concept and Kevin S.",1512518400,,1283,4.2190082644628095

The humor is okay, but its not my style. Some sound effects are really good (like the missile arming effect), others are not good like the ship's alarm. Some music is really good, other music isn't. One of the main themes sounds too much like star trek and it doesn't fit the vibe of the show. The special effects are good for the show's year; and it was filed in 16:9 widescreen which is good. Overall its an interesting watch.",1498176000,,568,4.419047619047619
5011944,4,B006P2TA44,"I try my best to respect others' opinions, especially when ti comes to fiction. However, in this case, I will be very blunt with my opinion, because the opposing one is not only so loud, but I genuinely believe it is doing this show serious harm, by discouraging people from giving it a fair shot.

Like most space operas, ""Andromeda"" has a pretty bad first season, and takes a while to get good. But while fans of ""Deep Space Nine"" and ""Babylon 5"" encourage newbies to ""stick with it, it gets better,"" the ""hardcore fans"" of this series are flying around the Internet doing their damndest to make sure no one sees anything but the first and worst of this show.

Season one introduces some intriguing concepts and fun characters, but is tortorously cliche. Think of all of the most overdone, basic, obvious cliches you've seen on ""Star Trek"" and its imitators; then imagine those cliches with NOTHING new even sprinkled around to try spicing them up; then imagine the show is acting like it's the first show ever to present these ideas, in the year 2000, ideas which the Original ""Star Trek"" did more cleverly in the mid '60s. Oh, and the ""villains"" are the Magog, an infantile attempt at a ""scary"" alien that when finally onscreen, look and act like bad guys from an '80s children's movie. Oh, and Beka Valentine DEFINITELY has a flash-addiction. (I here use the Tommy Wiseau definition of ""definitely."")

Then, in the middle of Season 2, comes an episode called ""Ourboros."" This was the episode when I literally shot up in my chair, suddenly going from struggling to stay focused to genuinely fascinated. This is the episode where ""Andromeda"" suddenly becomes its own show, with its own ideas and stories. It's the episode where Trance Gemini goes from being cute and kind of corny to being one of the most fascinating characters in all of science fiction.

As the good characters develop and get even better, the show also dumps the two that were apparently un-salvageable. Rev ""Religious Stereotype"" Bem goes first, and finally Tyr ""Proud Warrior Stereotype Who Beats His Chest and Growls Like an Ape, Great Trait For Your Only Black Character"" Anasazi gets shafted. (Harper's line in the series finale, ""I haven't been this happy since Tyr left,"" was like Christmas morning.)

In the last couple of seasons we get two new characters who are both interesting, well acted, and lots of fun. We also get some good conflicts for the cast, and an epic (if confusing) final battle. Season 5 isn't perfect, but compared to the neigh-unwatchable early seasons, it's solid gold.

Again, to each his own. But, if you are not yet familiar with this series, I strongly advice you ignore the ""hardcore fans,"" especially if you are already familiar with space opera.",1497657600,,2756,4.791578947368421

What is life like when exponential technological advancement occurs for so long? Do emotions matter? What is the boundary between flesh and machine. How far can VR take us?

What values will stand the test of time? How far can the notion of diversity take us? I wish I had more time to write as so much went into the creation of this series. Yes, there are imperfections.

All this ""filler"" is kind of insulting. I was waiting on some sort of big bang for the climax and was sorely disappointed. If you are a fan of this series, the set is complete.

I mention the quality issue because I think I remember seeing a review indicating a lack of picture quality.  Of course if you're not an Andromeda fan, well, that's another issue.  It will take me up to a year to go through the full set.  But it is there whenever I want it.

5011974,4,B006P2TA44,"Andromeda is a Gene Roddenberry show and his drive to portray a future of hope and comradeship, to forgive human frailty in order to show compassion, shines throughout the series.  It's Roddenberry-y.  No, hmm, it's Gene-y.  Well, you get the idea.  It's got a Gene Roddenberry feel.  I didn't like it the first time I saw it on TV, the episodes I saw were disjointed and didn't make any sense to me.  I had no sense of the characters background or why things were the way they were.  I took a chance and binged watched it while I was recuperating after a minor surgery.  (which, by the way, the pills they give you to prevent swelling are super important)  Watching Andromeda from the first episode was a total reversal.  Suddenly everything made sense and I felt invested in the characters.  Some people have compared Andromeda to Firefly (Andromeda came out a couple years before Firefly) because of the crew archetypes and the flying around in space in a lone hero sort of way.  The writing is totally different and, frankly, the Firefly acting and directing is much better, but then it's much better than pretty much everything, so you can disregard that warning as obvious.  The later seasons took a different turn, I think they changed directors and tried to keep the episodes more self sufficient.  The first seasons were the best, in my opinion, but the later seasons were worth watching too.",1467676800,,1401,4.711934156378601

But for others, I think it lacks a little something. During the shows original run, and then again watching the series on DVD again, the crew supporting Sorbo never really jelled for me.  I never really got why a starship captain out of time who needed to restore the old lost order would do so with a tiny rag tag crew vs. restoring the full roster of the ship with the competent potential crew candidates they came across.  The show many have lacked a little focus on where it was going, though it does have a grand premise.  This may be ripe for a remake someday by someone who can do for Andromeda what Ron Moore did for Battlestar Galactica.

5011989,5,B006P2TA44,"I basically loved the first four seasons and hated the last (Season 5). The series feels like it was meant to end after the fourth, with a two-part season ender in which (SPOILER) the entire crew dies. Then the last season felt like it was added on when he show was unexpectedly renewed (I don't have any idea if this was what happened, but it sure feels like that). Actually I could not bring myself to watch the Fifth Season to the end! Admittedly the fourth season was not as good as the first three, mainly because Tyr was gone, with all the edginess that he brought to the series, and was replaced by another nietzschean who was an EXTREMELY tame replacement and did not contribute much, if anything, to the story (he was a ""yes man"" for Dylan, but yes men don't hold any interest or advance the plot). Apparently they felt Rhade was too good to die.  In Andromeda Roddenberry and Majel Barrett give us another, updated take on the universe (or tri-universe) than was possible in Star Trek, with the believeable characters Roddenberry was so good at.

All of the episodes start with a quote and those (and only those) did not so much play on my computer but jerk. However, if you can wait until each ""quote"" is done, the rest the of the DVD plays fine.

5011994,5,B006P2TA44,"I write relatively few reviews but this show deserves one.

Background on me:  I'm a long-time science fiction fan, starting with TOS Star Trek reruns in the 80's.  I am ok with a bit of action but I'm more interested in the way science fiction provides a framework for investigating humanity from the outside.  I'm more into an intellectual thriller than an action blow-em-up, and I'm interested in the occasional drama if it is thought provoking.  So... if you don't align with that general perspective then my review may not be of much value to you.

I was very pleasantly surprised with Andromeda.  The first few episodes got off to a bit of a rocky start, as is common as new actors and crews start working together.  Kevin Sorbo does a great job as the lead role, and I honestly didn't think I'd feel that way.  I did enjoy the Hercules series, which is how I best know Kevin, but most people would not argue that the series was a bit campy, too much for some.  As Andromeda got started there was a little bit of that, even an offhand joke about how Captain Hunt was ""huge, like some kind of a greek god or something"" -- an obvious reference to Kevin's prior acting gig.  But as the characters and stories started to flow through the end of the first season and the second season got underway that campiness gave way to a more thoughtful and interesting production, at times very star-trek-esque.  One thing I always thought star trek did excellently was to carry some sort of moral, but not necessarily by providing all the answers.  Just by asking some of the right questions star trek invited us to think hard about who We really are.  Andromeda fell into a similar rhythm.

There are several interesting character aspects that are unique to this series.  Tyr Anasazi is a stoic and selfish genetically altered bounty hunter, who at the beginning of the show seems to sign on only because he thinks he might gain advantage.  The actor did a great job of personifying a distinctly unique television personality, and effectively portrayed a transitioning duality as the selfishness seemed to melt away as Dylan won him over, yet early on you learned that Tyr has issues and ambitions that are all his own and are likely to linger.

Then there is Trance, who is a 'whatever' complete with tail (until it is damaged).  She seems innocent but strangely mysterious.  As the series progresses we learn that her innocence may not be as it seems.  Is it feigned?  Is it honest but complicated?  It's hard to tell.  And when she ""grows up"" due to some temporal weirdness that I'll leave unexplained, the actor was able to deepen the character even further, adding a bit less innocence and a bit more uncertainty.

There was an alien ""magog"" who was some sort of furry monkish creature that would normally be hell bent on killing everyone (or more accurately using everyone as a vessel for growing young) except that he has had some sort of vision about peace and ""the way"".  It's not clear exactly how that all came about, and the magog in general are not portrayed as being particularly cerebral.  Apparently the actor developed allergies to the costume equipment and had to have a rather unexplained exit from the show, with the character going off on some kind of personal quest.  A fitting departure.  The magog remain as a major antagonist in the main plot arc.

Then there's Romy, or Andromeda, who is many things, including the ship itself, an artificial life form and AI as an android, and an avatar representing the ship's UI.  They did a nice job of making her a complex character, in fact, her AI seems to be segmented and often does not get along with itself, particular the android portion which is both connected and separate from the core ship AI.  She is not the cold ""data"" of star trek, as she seems to be doomed to experience all the emotions without really comprehending them.  In many ways she has the same struggles but with a different slant, since the AI of the future has apparently incorporated emotional capabilities.

The setting for the series is far in the future of our real earth existence, and the two human crew members are a bit of a quirky and accessibly representation of early millennial folks in their late 20's or early 30's.  Seamus Harper is a rather irreverent ""genius"" hacker boy, who while sometimes annoying and irritatingly anachronistic does add a light and human element.  He's basically a halfway decent guy at heart, and I do stress halfway, who is nonetheless weak in most ways.  His story often involves pushing his egomania to the limits where he has to break down and actually be a decent human being.  And Beka is an independent woman who really would rather be her own captain, although she does often admit it is not as much fun as it sounds when you actually have to shoulder the burdens of leadership.

The role of Dylan Hunt, played by Kevin Sorbo is one of a lone survivor of an ancient war, trapped in a time dilation near the event horizon of a black hole for 300 years.  Sorbo does a great job in his role, making Dylan seem to be a very likable and pragmatically idealistic captain, if you can forgive me describing the character using near antonyms.  He's an idealist at heart that has to bow to pragmatism to survive.  His pure heart basically wins over the other characters, and he truly becomes their leader.  As I mentioned, going into it I was not sure I was going to like series, nor the Dylan character.  The first episode of Season 1 really made me wonder, the way it started felt very dated and essentially trite to me.  As if it was another Deep Space 9 (nothing against DS9, but we don't need another).  But that quickly wore away, almost by the end of the first episode.  The utility of that initial setting was just to give some background to the Dylan that would go on to live an entirely different existence, 300 years in the future, and in retrospect it was a decent way to start.  I still hold that most new shows lack a certain cohesion as they go into launch, as the actors and the crew get comfortable with the ""new worlds"" they are creating, and this show was no exception.

The series was a bit more modern and gritty as compared with 90's trek - not in a bad way.  And they did a fairly nice job of buttoning things up when the show came to an end.  I have a MAJOR pet peeve over series that are cancelled and absolutely not resolved.  I have gone so far as to refuse watching new series for fear that they will be cancelled. After they are DONE and I know they were not then I pick them up on disc or streaming.  If that's how they want to treat me, then that is how I'll treat them.  Not a good situation but they started it.

This series is very underrated, unknown, and unappreciated material in my opinion, and is really an excellent part of the Barrett/Roddenberry legacy.

As for the DVD set, it is fine.  No special features, no subtitles, just the episodes.  The encoding is good and the sound is fine.  I listen with wireless headphones most of the time so I can hear every detail.  It may not be quite as good ""over the air"" of a normal TV speaker system, but it definitely is clean and clear audio.  Subtitles are missed but it isn't a big deal.  The lack of any extras at all was a minor bummer.  I would have liked to dig in more about Majel's role in the production and to hear more from the cast about the experience, but the set is still great without those things.",1441843200,26,7471,4.488148148148148

If your a fan of deus ex machina endings, then this might be the show for you.  By the end, half the characters had turned into jesus and were destined to save the entire universe.  I'd like to think that if Rodenberry had lived, he would have reined this train wreck in, given it some focus and slapped down the dumber plots and story lines.

5012006,4,B006P2TA44,"okay, I heard some weird things from previous reviews, one in which said the show has morals. Well, if meeting alien women and having the captain get laid is moral to you, then you are completely messed up....Two characters in particular love to get it on all over the galaxy and with no shame either. Capt. Dylan Hunt seems to get over his departed wife really quickly and sleeps and kiss girls really quickly. Seriously, kissing women soon after you first meet them doesn't happen that often in real life.

And another thing I noticed (and from my caption) these seasons re-use many of the scenes over...and over...and over...and over again. Especially the space battles. I swear I've seen one space battle of ships blowing up over a dozen times, a cloud exploding into space destroying ships about half a dozen times, and I can go on.

But, my favorite part came in season five when he pulled out a sword and a blond wig (from another show he was in) and said ""long story""  LOL!!!!!

5012033,3,B006P2TA44,well the reason for the 3 is that they didn't have blue ray and having so many disc in one case is tiring to change but it was still ok because it had all the seasons.,1397692800,,167,3.6666666666666665

5012038,4,B006P2TA44,"What a great series this was.  Kevin Sorbo as Dylan Hunt and the Andromeda Ascendant made a great team going against the bad guys.  The rest of the crew were quirky and, over the 5 seasons of this show, developed a closeness and depth that made it fun to watch.  It did get a little weird towards the end, but I chalk that up to writers trying to close things off for the series finale.",1387065600,,386,4.12

5012040,3,B006P2TA44,"Show has an decent plot with poor/reused space graphics. Captain also is more along the vein of Kirk with his womanizing. Otherwise, pretty decent. Biggest gripe is the packaging of them is very cheap, some of the DVD holders were broken in the package and falling apart.",1383177600,5,271,4.787234042553192
5012041,5,B006P2TA44,"Andromeda was an amazing show to watch, even though I had hesitation at first because ""Hercules"" was starring in it, and I wasn't sure I could put away his leatherette outfits for the more stylish officer's digs he wore on this show. I was wrong to be hesitant. The show grabbed me and sucked me happily into it's storylines week after week. I will have to say, though, I was a bit happy to see Tir leave...that character was always a bit too hard to stomach. But that is actually a compliment to the writers and the actor who portrayed him, because he portrayed the arrogance and superiority of his character's race right down to the last letter. My only regret for the show was the way they ended it, with that whole pocket universe/amnesia/I'm not sure/enough with the slashes already storyline. it just seemed like the crew was just reading their lines. The audience deserved better of the show's management.  It's always easy to blame the actors first, but you have to remember, they are doing as directed and ordered, not how they may Want to interact. Still and all the series as a whole is definitely worth a marathon or two viewings. Enjoy the series, I know I did.",1382400000,,1174,4.563981042654029

5012043,5,B006P2TA44,"This is an excellent series! I could not watch it when it originally aired because it wasn't available. Have been a big Kevin Sorbo fan since Hercules first aired. Have watched all of the Andromeda episodes and enjoyed them very much. Love Kevin as Dylan Hunt. The fact that it was a Gene Roddenberry series was the second deciding factor in my purchase. The first was that Kevin Sorbo starred as the lead character.

I have always been satisfied with purchases made through Amazon.

5012045,5,B006P2TA44,Loved it when it was on tv. I looked everywhere for streaming but couldn't find it. This is actually better. Perfect picture and no fear of freeze ups due to a lack of bandwidth.,1377820800,2,178,4.264705882352941
5012046,4,B006P2TA44,I like the premise of being caught in a black hole's event horizon and being transported into a future that no longer goes by the civilized of his own time.  This is return of one of Roddenberry's concept updated for the modern audience.  Consider the fact that this is TV show and builds upon the characters put together in a difficult situation.  Basic idea is Star Trek with super spaceship.,1377475200,,394,4.6
5012047,5,B006P2TA44,It has been a long time to get this series.  I doubt there would be enough action for today's series.  But it was a journey in time and space for me.,1376956800,,149,3.774193548387097
5012048,5,B006P2TA44,"I've been waiting for Andromeda for years, but could not afforded it because of the ridicule prices of 600, 800, and even over  thousands of  dollars some sellers are still  asking for. But then came that deal of 116 dollars for the five years series, all 110 episodes, in widescreen, exactly what I wanted. Now I can watch it at my convenience, some episode I never saw because the networks are not always consistent in there weekly presentation.
Maybe the Andromeda: Slipstream Collection has 50 dvd's. this one got 30, so what, all i wanted is to see it in widescreen without  interruption from one end to the other. Now I am happy. Thank you. Great price, super fast delivery, bought it on a Wednesday got it two days later on Friday.

5012050,5,B006P2TA44,I got this series fast. I enjoyed the tv series so much. I think of this as the most funniest show for syfy I ever seen. I highly recommend this series for any syfy and Gene roddenbery fans of star trek.,1375056000,,203,3.975609756097561

5012052,4,B006P2TA44,"By some of the comments here, it seems some people are receiving bootleg copies of the compiled boxset.  Please check your purchase and return it if it is a bootleg.
Typical of a bootleg is single layer sides with a size of a little over 4 Gigabytes (4.37 or 4.7 depending on your system).  These should be around 8GB per side for almost all the discs.
There are other ways to tell, but would take too long to go over here.
BTW, I actually enjoyed Andromeda, and with the exception of the last of the series, would give it 4 or 4.5 stars.",1373846400,2,538,4.213592233009709
5012053,4,B006P2TA44,"From a technical point of view this set isn't too bad. Many episodes look very nice on a large screen HD TV but some had scanning lines momentarily. Two discs in the set either didn't play at all or only played one of the episodes. Oddly, both were the last of a season which means there were only two episodes on the discs. Somewhat annoying, but I had another source which allowed me to at least watch the unplayable episodes at a lower quality. The show itself is fun and it has many good episodes. I enjoyed the characters as cast. Brent Stait was remarkably appealing as the really ugly Rev Bem. I like what he did with his voice for that part. Over all, this is not profound science fiction but it is very good entertainment. Worth watching several times. Kevin Sorbo as usual provided good clean entertainment in his part as lead character and producer. Kevin Sorbo and Keith Hamilton Cobb were the only non-Canadians in the cast. Cobb did a great job playing the part of  ""Tyr Anasazi out of Victoria by Barbarossa."" Lexa Doig had many memorable moments in the triple part of Andromeda on screen, Andromeda as android avatar, and Andromeda hologram. I enjoy her work a lot. Lisa Ryder was a blast as Beka. Laura Bertram was also very good in her part as Trance Gemini. Her part grew during the run of the show. Last but not least I very much enjoyed Gordon Michael Woolvett as the spunky engineering genius Seamus Harper. I'm glad they found a way to bring Steve Bacic back after the first episode. All in all I think some of the highest quality science fiction television shows are currently produced in Canada. They have NO lack of skilled actors and technical support crew.",1372118400,32,1684,4.5394736842105265
5012054,5,B006P2TA44,I did not expect this show to be this good.  I like the cast and the plot.  A different tail from Roddenberry.,1370563200,,110,3.9545454545454546
5012055,5,B006P2TA44,"Andromeda is a very different situation than Star Trek ever was, though there are similarities in many ways. I don't want to give away any spoilers, as I have been chastised in the past for doing so. However, I will say that if you are looking for a Star Trek clone, you won't find it here. I found this series to be a new and refreshing look at science fiction in space. The lead character ""Dylan Hunt"" was really the only good guy on the ship, though the others do redeem themselves throughout the series. And, it is the interpersonal stories that make this such a great series. The overall tone of inter-species relations was there, as it was in Star Trek, but the rest was a very different universe than the Star Trek universe. ****Spoiler Alert**** In this series the lead character is frozen in time in possession of this great ship ""The Andromeda"" and wants to bring back a time of peace, happiness, and unity to the universe. The ship is unfrozen by and boarded by salvager's who are not the most respectable group of characters. Dylan Hunt exercises his authority and they become his crew. Let the adventures begin. From that point on, they form an uneasy bond and alliance. But, learn to work together. There is one among them who has his own agenda ""Tyr Anasazi"" to become more than he is within his own people. And, often his agenda conflicts with that of the crew of the Andromeda. Making for some great story lines. ***Spoiler Alert*** Over. Look, if you like Sci-fi, you want to own this set. Granted season 5 was not so good. But, the rest of the seasons were great.
