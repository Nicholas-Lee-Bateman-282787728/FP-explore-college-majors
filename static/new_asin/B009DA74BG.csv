5319271,5,B009DA74BG,Very nice packaging. Comes in nice case. Enjoying it already have way thru season 6 cant wait to finish all seasons. Have several friends now watching Jag,1358467200,,154,4.7407407407407405
5319272,5,B009DA74BG,"As someone who was twelve when this series ended, I never ended up getting any of the DVDs until now.  I was not disappointed.  The design of the box is very efficient and looks great. The DVDs are in cardboard sleeves instead of in plastic cases, but I've tried out most of the discs and they are not scratched and run fine in both the television and the DVD slot on my laptop.  It is in my eyes the perfect way to obtain the entire series.  I do wish there was more bonus material- but I always want more bonus material regardless of how much there is, and there is plenty more than I have ever managed to find online and of course in a lot better quality.  I'd recommend this box set to anyone who enjoyed the series even half as much as I did.",1355875200,40,747,4.089041095890411
5319273,4,B009DA74BG,Love this box set and its cool look! Holiday gift for the folks who love the show and will be so happy to have it all to watch yet again! The bonus material and the book will surely be their favorite parts! A little on the expensive side but you get a lot for the price.,1355356800,,270,3.8392857142857144
5319274,5,B009DA74BG,"I will say for them to come out with a complete series is fine but cant they do it with out the cardbord because the dvds can scratch very easily and i just  don't it tis right
i say get them each and you are better off with that
As for the show I really think that she show was so great that is why i have all 10 seasons and they are in slim cases which is much better than this junky box set they put any kind of movies or tv series in.
You have to hold the dvd to get any kind of dvd out sorry i won't give it many stars for that reason it will get 3 stars for the box sets and 5 stars for the show,
Box sets like this are bad
If you don't have the series then an ok price but look around",1354233600,4,691,3.5460526315789473

5319296,3,B009DA74BG,"Description of the product...not the show.

Pros:
-Beautiful packaging, well thought out design.
-Comes with an insert for some fun reads, especially liked the explanation of the different ranks in different fields of the military with its corresponding emblem or mark.
-Also comes with a commemorative coin hidden behind the magnetized JAG emblem.

Cons:
-Many of the discs came pre-scratched: scratched most likely from the way the discs were sitting in their sleeves (no plastic). The scratches weren't bad enough to affect playback.
-Some seasons' folders' colors rubbed off",1448928000,,578,5.48314606741573

5319300,2,B009DA74BG,"The show was great, but we had all kinds of trouble with the dvd's.  I should have heeded the warning's of the other reviewers.  They were right.  Sorry, because the show is really wonderful..",1446336000,,192,4.588235294117647

5319302,5,B009DA74BG,"If you don't own any of the individual seasons of JAG and are a fan of this show or NCIS, this collection is a must own.  Contains every single season plus a special bonus disc with even more extras.  It's packed really nicely in a sturdy case with a nice book that describes each episode.  The amount of content in this set is close to 200 hours long.  If you're a JAG fan and want to re-live the show, you're in for hours of great entertainment.  This is probably one of the nicest complete series collections that I have ever picked up.",1439164800,2,539,4.245098039215686

Best gift I ever got. It's a great set of TV. Overall the box is great, nice little booklet, magnetic galore. I love it.",1436745600,,292,4.140350877192983

5319317,4,B009DA74BG,"The box measures 10 3/8 x 4 x 7 (not including the shoulder boards). Inside, each season is stored in its own smaller cardboard box and contains between 4 and 7 discs each depending on the number of episodes and extras. You can remove each box and store them on the shelf like regular DVD cases. With all 10 seasons, they take up about 7 of shelf space.

Episode names (with disc numbers) appear on the inside front cover of each season box and the discs themselves. Discs include all extras from the single season releases. I am surprised no one mentioned the plastic slip covers on each disc. Although flimsy, they help (but not entirely) prevent scratching when taking discs in and out of the cardboard sleeves. To make sure all discs play properly, I inserted each of the 56 discs into my Blu-ray player and played a few minutes of one episode at random. They played fine so far. I visually inspected all discs, and even the ones with scratches played.* The lost episode, Skeleton Crew, is included.

The 56th bonus disc includes:
The Jagged Edge 7-part documentary (44:00)
JAG: Beyond the Scenes (18:41)
Season 5 publicity material (5:21)
Promos (1:42)
Entertainment Tonight clips (3:37)

The Insiders Manual measures 6 x 9 5/8. Its 36 glossy pages include:
-The History of Navy JAG (TV series and real JAG corps)
-Images of an invitation to attend a special screening on February 24, 1997 of the first episode
-Premier Season Q&A with JAG Creator and Executive Producer Donald Bellisario
-Character Biographies (Rabb, Mac, Chegwidden, Roberts, Turner)
-History of Fighter Jets
-Office of the Judge Advocate General Division Chart
-US Navy and Marine Corp Ranks for Officers
-Episode Guide (titles and 1-2 sentence descriptions)
-Challenge Coin Info
-A Guide to Military Parlance
Half way through the manual, the pages appear out of order. Seasons appear in this sequence: 1,2,3,4,5,10,9,8,7,6. Does anyone else see this?

The challenge coin is hidden behind the magnetic JAG logo on the front of the box and measures 1 in diameter. Some reviews say the coin is plastic. Mine is cardboard with imprinted stickers front and back.

* NOTE: When I initially tried playing discs on my 11-year-old DVD player, some of them did not play properly. But, they play fine on my 3-year-old laptops DVD drive and my brand new Blu-ray player. If you have difficulty playing a disc, consider getting a new player.",1432944000,10,2403,4.879901960784314
5319318,4,B009DA74BG,I love the packaging. It's very stylish and it seems to be sturdy enough. I have yet to watch any of the disks so I don't know if they all work or not but I will update my review if things aren't what they should be.,1432684800,,216,3.717391304347826

5319348,5,B009DA74BG,Great packaging and in good condition. I loved the show and I think it is a pity we don't have a show like it on tv at all (and no; none of the NCIS shows go as far as JAG did military-wise).,1425081600,,191,3.5714285714285716
5319349,4,B009DA74BG,"I bought the complete series because I liked the show and never saw how it ended. I thought this would be a nice box set to own. For the most part it is. The DVDs are scratched which surprised me for something new, sealed, and not a bootleg. The packaging itself could've helped with that, just trying to get them in the V shaped slots. Later on, I realized that season 8 was missing. I had two copies of season 9. I wasn't able to return it so I had to buy season 8 to find out what happened. That was the big inconvenience to me! So much for standing behind your products...

The show itself was great up until the end of season 9. Everything seemed to leave with AJ. Season 10 was choppy and difficult to watch with all the new changes. It was like Harm and Mac were kept away from each other and any display of feelings was put on. I realize the show was cancelled and it was a scramble. Glad to see they got it right at the end - errr maybe?! ;)",1424736000,,950,4.026455026455026

It also gives him time to relax and enjoy a great show. The box was amazing to see, the challenge coin hidden behind the front panel has now joined our collection of coins, and beyond one of the top snap coming off once, it has stayed intact, and shows sturdy construction.",1417219200,,514,4.364583333333333

5319391,3,B009DA74BG,"The videos themselves deserve a higher rating but the packaging and disc quality is only so-so.  Some discs skip and one doesn't play at all.  The earlier seasons are better quality than the later seasons which play almost like they are bootlegs.  Cheap cardboard packaging offers little protection and makes it difficult to access discs without smudging.

The shows were amazing and even had episodes that were similar to actual events that were in the news at the time.  The show is well made, the actors and actresses that have been on the show through the years are all amazing.  The stories were well written.  When I purchase this mock set Amazon had an amazing deal going on and I had to try it.

Amazon actually made it fairly easy to return and get a new set.  The new set also has scratches, but they do play.  The set is packaged in a cutsy lawyers brief with epaulettes that have snaps for closing the container.  Inside  the brief each season is enclosed in cardboard sleeves with individual slots for each DVD.  The act of extracting each DVD from the cardboard slots of course scratches the DVD's.  I went to the trouble of backing up the DVD's as I am sure that the DVD's cannot be slid in and out of the slots too many times without damaging the DVD beyond the ability to play.  As to the series, what can I say it is a better than average Donald P Bellisario series with plenty of action, compassion, and of course nostalgia for those who were former Navy.",1402617600,,906,4.377245508982036

When it arrived I opened it up, thumbed through the booklet, looked around for the coin... looked around for the coin... no coin.  On top of that I had to spend time looking at disc after disc counting to make sure they were all there and finding that every single one had scratches.  I really enjoy this show but shame on Amazon.  We all know you have to be careful with sellers, but who knew we had to watch out for Amazon themselves.  Now I have 10 years worth of a tv show, which I really enjoyed, and can't be sure how much of it works.",1400457600,5,652,3.9389312977099236

5319423,5,B009DA74BG,"JAG was one of the greatest shows of the past 20 years -- bar none.  The whole family could watch it without fear of something off color, horrifying or politically correct junk thrown in.  It was exciting, well-written and directed.  The stars were clean-cut and heroic.  Wish we had some shows like it today.",1399593600,,309,4.666666666666667

5319426,5,B009DA74BG,"I loved JAG and tried to watch every episode while it was on the air, I even followed JAG from one major network to another. However getting this over the winter holidays was the best time spent enjoying David James Elliott and Catherine Bell, along with the other amazing cast. I truly enjoyed seeing the episodes in order and being able to remember all the stories from the beginning.",1398556800,,386,4.608695652173913

5319431,1,B009DA74BG,"The series gets 5 stars; the packaging a negative 5 stars. As a retired E9 who was on the USS KITTY HAWK when the F14 crash shown in Season 5 actually occurred I  expected more thought would go into packaging these historical and tragic events.  In fact both the Pilot and Radar Intercept Officer survived the ramp strike. The Pilot had very few night traps.  Back to the packaging; cardboard slips are no way to keep DVD's secure from scratches.  The box itself is cumbersome and gaudy to say the least. There is nothing gaudy about the uniforms of the United States Navy or its uniforms.  I would hope all studios take note, no cardboard sleeves. Compact packaging for a compact package.  Some of us collect movies and don't have enough space for unnecessary embellishments.",1396137600,26,776,4.711111111111111

5319434,5,B009DA74BG,"Bought this for my mother. You might think the collector edition would be more expensive than the normal series collection, but it is cheaper. This collection was manufactured newer than the original series collection. Which means the discs hold more episodes and the cases are skinnier (so they don't take up much shelf space at the warehouse, I'm assuming). Mom said she loved it and though I was spoiling her.",1393545600,,412,4.9

5319442,4,B009DA74BG,"The case for the DVDs is very nice and organized. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband, DVDs were playing good until we got into season 3, disk 3 where one of the episodes kept freezing. We thought maybe the player needed to be cleaned, but it didn't work. Disk 4 works fine, so it is that particular disk. Unfortunately, the time to replace the item expired Jan 31. So I guess we're stuck with it. If only one episode out of the entire collection is faulty we can live with it. Hopefully that's it. 6 weeks really isn't enough time for returning or exchanging an item with this many episodes to view, there should be more time allotted.",1392249600,37,649,4.327868852459017

Also read a review that said there was no disc menu and you had to watch the disc from start to finish, you were not able to pick an episode, my dvds all have a menu at the beginning.

Well worth the money I paid.",1391904000,,362,4.027777777777778

5319453,4,B009DA74BG,"This product was sealed, however most of the DVD's show scratches and pits on them.  I suspect that it was a returned item and then re-sealed.  That would explain the drop in price of over $170.00.  The DVD's do play, but often stop for no reason and have to be restarted manually.  As far as the packaging goes, it is glossy photo paper glued to cardboard, nice looking, but sub-standard for the full asking price of over $300.00.  It is colorful and unque, but cheaply made.  The coin is plastic and much smaller than the one tossed by Bud on the final episode.  The Bonus DVD with the interviews with the actors was great, but it also showed wear. The DVD's are placed in V-shaped sleeves tightly, removing them is difficult.  Each DVD has 3 or 4 episodes on them, however they are not listed on the starting frame, so if you wanted to watch #3 you would have to watch #1 & 2 first before getting to # 3, no choices here.  I gave it 4 stars for the recording, picture and sound match.  But 1 star would be good enough for the rest of it.",1387411200,39,1040,4.233502538071066

Granted it might have cost some, but there is a whole lot of shows on this set, I bought it quite a while ago and haven't finished the whole thing yet.
