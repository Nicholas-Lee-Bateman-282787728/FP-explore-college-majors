8758716,5,B01EGTFQXQ,"Incredibly beautiful, powerful and inspirational film! The DVD is in Estonian, with GERMAN SUBTITLES ONLY; I wish this extraordinary, masterful film was available with English subtitles, so more people could follow the story - though, if you can understand any German language at all, the story is told mostly visually - the images are absolutely stunning! Catch this one any way you can!",1475193600,2,388,5.174603174603175
