She is such a good actress. You feel like when you are watching this, she is totally baring her soul. Of course it's not her real soul, because this is the magic that is good acting. But it gets to you.

In the movie, she is nude a lot of the time. There are a lot of sex scenes. But at no time is any of it erotic in any way. I found that really surprising. Sex in this movie is used as a point of conflict, not pleasure or love. As such, it's kind of hard to take. There is intensity, but it feels wrong because you can see her being used and abused. This is obviously what the director intended. It doesn't make it easier to watch.

This movie is really hard to watch. Every scene ends in a bad way. ""Why watch it then?"" you may wonder. Well, the answer is Noomi Rapace. She's just amazing, there's no other word for her. She's so good. There is no pretense here. She is going for the best she can possibly be in this movie, and giving it 100%. You can tell she's doing it, and she shines.

I've come to be a big fan of hers. Otherwise I wouldn't have sought out this kind of hard-to-find movie. I'm not just a fan of her acting. I'm a fan of her commitment. She's got this fantastic willpower, this drive, that is just unbelievable. For ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", she went on a 7 month diet of nothing but protein and vegetables, and did Thai boxing and kickboxing workouts. And it still shows. In ""What Happened to Monday"", she is totally ripped.

Anyways, I'm getting off on a tangent. She is really great, and this movie is no exception. After seeing it twice, I don't think I want to see it again. The subject matter is too depressing. But the performance is unforgettable. Recommended.",1504569600,,1883,4.27808988764045
8307869,2,B001H5RCXA,"I mean, I did not like this movie so naturally, I do not have much nice things to say. For some of who are interested in, here few pointers. Movie has nudity. Full frontal, back side etc. A few almost graphic sex scenes too. Now, that's out of the way. Director, I guess, wanted to be unique but failed so bad and made a weird movie. When you think, you are watching the movie and it is part of the movie, it turns out she is auditioning for a part. There is REALY, REALY sick, whicked relation between her and her infant. I actually fast forwarded some scenes, I simply could not take it. Movie also gives the image of being very low budget 'B' movie. Actually, no outside scenes and it could as well be a theather play too! If you can, use amazon.com instant video option and rent it! Your best bet.",1373587200,,801,4.207792207792208
8307870,4,B001H5RCXA,"I was pretty satisfied with my purchase.  It played well and easily on my lap top with Windows Media Player since it's a foreign DVD.  It's true Windows Media easily let's you adapt a PAL DVD.  It also gave me the option of clicking on English which I chose, or Danish and Swedish as a language preference.  I was pleased because I was concerned about how to have that choice when it arrived at my place.  For a lot of people the subject matter might be hard to stomach, and it's definitely not for people under 16 by American standards.  Here in the states the rating would be not R, but NC-17.  Yes it's that graphic.  Do you other reviewers agree with me?  Feel free to say what you think please.  It seemed to be a somewhat independent or small franchise film, so I can see why it's probably not as big time as the Swedish Dragon Tattoo film and other European movies Noomi Rapace has made.  Dragon Tattoo is of course what made her an international movie success.  However she does bring her signature Oscar worthy acting genius to this early work of her's.  I also thought those involved in making the film did a good job by being realistic, and not glossing things over.  Maybe the baby was fussy because she had colic, and Anna was ignorent of that.  Do you all think so?  I don't have kids but like most people have family and friends with kids.  Last but not least I do not want to spoil the film so I'll say it like this, but in the last scene Anna seems to be bidding an official goodbye to everybody.  Do the rest of you think there are really two people watching her say farewell, or she's imagining it?  As I said before please feel free to comment.",1363219200,6,1664,4.292604501607717
8307871,3,B001H5RCXA,"Noomi Rapace gives what must be the bravest performance by any mainstream actor/actress in a mainstream film (meaning not an X rated)in a very long time. This film is very well produced, well acted and well done -- but the subject matter will be off putting to most viewers. Yes, it's art, and yes, the heroine suffers mightily for it. The story involves a young mother with a very fussy baby who is trying to break into the film industry. It's ultimately heartbreaking and pushing the boundaries of R rated territory. While there is no ""real"" sex in the picture there is a lot of simulated sex and this film would carry either a NC-17 label, or be unrated. The film can be found, in Swedish through bit torrent, or bought for those who have a DVD world/European player. If you want to see more Noomi after the Dragon Tattoo trilogy, this is the film for you. But don't expect to feel good afterwards. Also note that it's sometimes a hard film to find with subtitles and it was filmed in Swedish, I believe.",1323734400,6,1007,4.478260869565218
8307872,3,B001H5RCXA,"I watched it online, with english subtitles.  (those are always horribly done) I tell you even without it I could feel what the mother felt. if anyone is considering having a child, this movie may change their mind. Yes their cute and fun, but their crying can be incredibly annoying especially if a single parent.

The mother tries many many auditions and failed through some due to her baby crying and disrupting the set. Im guessing shes jobless, yet lives in a pretty big apartment with little to no furniture.

Anyways the movie is graphic in some parts. It is a drama from start to finish. We follow a single mother who tries to make it as an actress. I tel ya there are some scenes id rather not see again even in my nightmares, overall the movie was ok. it is diifuclt to really enjoy a film when you're reading subtitles",1299542400,4,829,4.440789473684211
