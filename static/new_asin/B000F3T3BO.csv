Cristaline voice , effortless performances ........
Really divine !!!",1199577600,4,119,5.315789473684211
2550256,3,B000F3T3BO,"My biggest complaint is the inclusion of several versions of the same aria. This may be OK for hearing once, but is not something I want to hear every time I play the DVD. Dessay sings well (sometimes very well) but some of the supporting cast seem bored. Also I have seen better interpirtations of some of the scenes. Dessay has made better DVDs.",1196899200,4,347,4.4375
2550257,5,B000F3T3BO,"Natalie Dessay is apsolutely marvellous in this wonderful DVD.  If you love the operatic voice, this is
certainly a terrific choice.  She gives a tour de force at every level, and if you cannot see her in person
on the stage, than this is the way to go.",1184198400,11,253,4.25
2550258,4,B000F3T3BO,"As other reviewers have pointed out, Natalie Dessay is a brilliant coloratura soprano, capable of producing a large body of tone despite her small size. She can also act, and even dance if required. I would not be surprised to see her in some future production singing rapturously even if she were being fired from a cannon's mouth or parachuting from an airplane.

If there are flaws in her performances, I would say they are two. First of all, to my ear hers is not a perfect instrument. Her very highest notes are frequently indistinguishable from screams, and therefore less than pleasant on the ear. Audiences at her performances, I should point out in fairness, don't appear to share my discomfort here. This inclination to scream seems more prominent in her later than earlier performances, and one hopes it's not the wave of the future.

Second, though she's certainly a commendable, often witty actress, she's inclined in some roles to chew the scenery. ""Lucia"" is a case in point, her performance in the Mad Scene being overacted and undersung. There's no classic artist's moderation here in the midst of the whirlwind that is her acting. Lucia may be mad, but the artist is supposed to be in control of the madness, even if the character isn't. Like Rolando Villazon, Dessay is inclined on occasion to give us too much of a good thing, so that, as happens here, the end result is less than wonderful.",1178496000,8,1411,4.755102040816326
2550259,5,B000F3T3BO,"What can I say?  Natalie Dessay, her superb voice notwithstanding, must be seen as well as heard.  This compilation beautifully documents her first ten years on the stage, and is an excellent introduction to her considerable talents.  The only, even remote problem with the DVD is that the scenes are in no discernable order--I'd have preferred them to be chronological.

Her early performances (tracks 1,5,7,9) are excellent, restrained but not stiff.  She really hits her stride in the mid-90's (tracks 3,12,13), bringing warmth and a superb comic sense to the roles.  The remaining tracks showcase one of the world's best singers at her peak, and prove that she's as good with a dramatic role as with a comic one.

I particularly liked the two contrasting interpretations of Zerbinetta.  The conventional interpretation (track 11) is a worldly Zerbinetta trying to cheer up Ariadne by fondly recounting her vast experience with men--another one always comes along.  The world weary Zerbinetta (track 2) was new to me.  Same words, same music, but she now commiserates with the princess on the unreliability of men--can't live with them, can't live without them.  This kind of nuance has to be seen not just heard.",1173312000,28,1216,5.090909090909091
2550260,5,B000F3T3BO,"Dessay is a great performer and this DVD has an assortment of baubles, with a bravura rendition of Strauss' Voices Of Spring setting the pace right out of the gate. There are numerous versions of the Olympia's Doll Aria from Tales of Hoffman sprinkled throughout, my personal favorite the outdoor performance featuring gigantic dancing dolls (people on stilts inside) and Dessay in a Shirley Temple style tutu that the wind just won't leave alone.  A really fun DVD!",1171152000,24,466,4.9743589743589745
2550261,5,B000F3T3BO,"You would never imagine all those high notes coming out of such a tiny body! And yes, she is tiny. I have had the good fortune of meeting and hearing Natalie Dessay singing Ophelia at the Chatalet Opera House and she really packs a punch vocally! This DVD is a great collection of her most memorable stage roles, with her comments before each track. Her rendition of Der Holle Rache, with the dialogue before is absolutely fantastic!",1170547200,20,433,4.636363636363637
2550262,5,B000F3T3BO,"This DVD is a nice acquisition.  The coloratura soprano, Natalie Dessay, is filmed in some memorable roles--and singing some very interesting music.  The audience and its reactions add a good touch.

The DVD begins with her singing ""Fruhlingsstimmenwaltzer"" by Johan Strauss, Jr. as a segment of a production of ""Die Fledermaus."" She enjoys singing; her technique is excellent, with good vocal effects, such as a trill, florid effects in her singing, and a nicely sung high note at the end.

Other interesting ""cuts""--the ""Mad Scene"" from Lucia di Lammermoor (here, sung in French).  She depicts Lucia very nicely, suggesting her misery and madness.  And the singing is ravishing.  She begins tearing her clothes off as she approaches the French version of ""Spargi d'amaro pianto."" The first time through, the emphasis is on the character, with some nice vocal effects. The repeat does not have the same level of ornamentation as in her CD, ""The Miracle of the Voice,"" but the scene is touching as a result of her characterization.

The two ""greatest hits"" of the Queen of the Night, from Mozart's ""Die Zauberflote,"" follow.  ""O Zittre Nicht"" is the first, followed by the even more daunting challenge of ""Der Holle Roche.""  Sounds kind of strange to hear the first sung in French and the second in German, but  Dessay sings these well in either language.  In the former, she nails the top note cleanly.  In the latter, she handles the challenging string of top notes with panache.

Interesting aspects of this DVD.  There are three different versions of ""Olympia's Song"" from Offenbach's ""Contes d'Hoffman.""  Nice vocal technique including some exemplary trills and other ornamentation.  Interesting characterizations of Olympia as well.  In addition, two versions of Zerbinetta singing ""Grossmachtige Prinzessin"" from Richard Strauss' ""Ariadne auf Naxos"" appear. Both are well sung.

An interesting cut is ""Glitter and be gay"" from Bernstein's ""Candide,"" also appearing on her ""The Miracle of the Voice"" CD (and compare with another nice version of this by Sumi Jo on her excellent ""Virtuoso Arias"" CD).  Dessay exhibits very nice vocal technique, appears to be having fun with the music, and the audience certainly seemed to enjoy themselves.

One nice thing about this work is that one can see the singer ""at work"" as well as hear the singing.  This adds a more multidimensional element to the DVD.  In the end, very entertaining.  This shows the breadth of Dessay's corpus; it also illustrates her vocal technique and her characterization of the roles that she plays.  Well worth taking a look at. . . .",1169510400,72,2608,5.065727699530516
2550263,5,B000F3T3BO,"If you would like to enjoy a soprano with absolute control of her voice, don't delay.  Order this DVD",1169424000,14,101,4.315789473684211
2550266,5,B000F3T3BO,"All the euphoric encomia in others reviews are spot on.  I have not read every word in all other reviews; but I would add the aria from ""Candide"" to the ""must be seen as well as heard"".  What a marvellous piece of singing and acting; what a face!!!!

2550267,5,B000F3T3BO,Natalie has it all:  A unique voice and exhuberant beauty to go with it!  She master the operatic scene with a commanding presence!,1363305600,2,131,4.6521739130434785
2550268,5,B000F3T3BO,"Six Stars. Okay, five stars, which seem unfair. Based on her Violetta in HD theatre last week, I bought this DVD and her La Traviata DVD. Her voice is so superb and synchronized with her facial passion that it is pointless to separate the two. Her performance brings back memory more than half a century ago, watching Anna Moffo in Lucia and Maria Callas in Butterfly in live performances. Moffo, Callas, and Dessay are in the same league. This is the highest compliment I can pay a soprano.  Dessay is easily the most sensuous soprano alive.  The pleasure of watching these three performers is 30% ears and 70% eyes.

Her versatility stretches from light roles, like Olympia, to two Mad Scenes.  Her Lucia mad scene is the ultimate. As Olympia, she is so cute and lovable.  What a doll !  I would love to purchase DVDs on her Lucia and Hoffman, but they are not available.  I wait.

Based on her acting alone, she would have easily made Hollywood, if not Bollywood.  The technical aspects of this DVD are first rate.  Both the audio and video are outstanding.

If Dessay has a shortcoming, it is her infatuation with Eurotrash, for which I refuse to buy her La Sonnambula... at least, for now.  As infatuating as Dessay is, I could succumb.

My dream DVD would be Natalie Dessay and Jonas Kaufmann in Faust.  It will have to be traditional, as Gounod intended.",1336867200,,1361,4.593360995850622
2550269,5,B000F3T3BO,"This presentation of Natalie Dessay achieves one thing among many others - it convinces the viewer and the listener that the actress we see is perhaps the most gifted and unique in today's world of the opera; and perhaps not only today's.  Her extraordinary gifts include not only flawless, superb singing with astonishing sound in the upper range - divinely effortless, beautiful, thrilling; but also her acting - her incredible dynamism on stage, her dancing and again, simply acting her role to such an extent that one forgets it is an opera!  So captivating is the impression Dessay is making...

Of all the marvelous, outstanding numbers on the DVD, with each one competing in perfection with another, I would particularly note the three representations of Olympia, her most famous aria Les oiseaux dans la charmille from Offenbach's Les Contes d'Hoffmann.  I personally has never been an admirer of this opera, but seeing Natalie Dessay performing this role made literally fall in love with this aria.  In two tracks on the disk, she is playing a doll - and I can argue without much risk that she is the absolute greatest performer of Olympia; in the 3rd track at Wiener Staatsoper/1996 production she is phenomenally mechanical, a true doll in bodily movements while she sings as a nightingale!  The next doll is at track 10, in Choregies d'Orange/2000 production, which seems to be particularly rich, funny and opulent; here she outperforms herself, I think - the impression of a doll singing is so true that one can't believe her own eyes!

And the third representation of Olympia is track 7, where she is rather playing a young maiden, confined to a strange, sinister bizarre place, populated with Boy George,Marlon Brando and other silent characters who seem to be watching over her; it is Opera de Lyon/1993 production conducted by Kent Nagano, and the mastery of this conductor is heard through playing this piece in a very unusual manner - together Dessay and Nagano managed to give it a flair of a lament of a young girl who is not free to follow her lover.  It is an amazing production, as two others above, and one can only wish to be there, alas, to see and hear it live.

Another great piece is Lucia's Mad Scene, which is excellent; the dramatism of acting, coupled with incomparable singing, is astonishing.

In Konigin der Nacht aria, Der Holle Rache from Die Zauberflote, Dessay is more virtuosic than Edita Gruberova; it seems to me that the only singer who is her equal in dazzling singing is Joan Sutherland in her best years (1950s);  but any other big name Dessay beats.  Now add to this amazing beauty of her voice with her phenomenal control over it her ability to dance and act, and you get a true phenomenon on stage.

This extraordinary performance is concluded with Duo da la mouche by Eurydice and Jupiter from Offenbach's Orphee aux enfers/1997;  it is another masterpiece - excellent singing accompanied by the most suggestive yet hilarious acting - nothing from the modern fashion (mostly German, though) of depicting explicit heavy-duty sex on stage; no, here it is full of mischief and although quite graphic, very elegant!  Such a result is much more difficult to achieve - to make the audience smile with delight and fun.  This is another production one can only regret to have never seen.

The only point of not even negative, but somewhat bizarre on this DVD is actually Natalie's comments to her pieces.  I am not sure what was the point of including them - she continues to act when commenting, and the whole impression is very insincere while providing no valuable information.  Not that I would expect any sincerity from an actress of her magnitude, but it is really hard to believe her words about Lucia's spectacle, that she was so overcome with the role that she forgot to notice she was baring herself with losing the dress.  One cannot sing belcanto and lose self-control; her talking only convinced me that at every moment she is in full and total control of her acting, and whatever she is making on stage is deliberate, as it should be.

However her comments are somewhat amusing, demonstrating once more some cultural stereotypes characteristic of a nation - if Germans can't do an opera without a gun and a suitcase, French just can't stop from sexualising everything and delving into the war of the sexes.  Dessay's comments on Konigin der Nacht aria, her words ""why should women have less power than men"" obscure the fact that in Mozart's Austria there was at the time of Die Zauberflote a recent Empress, as powerful as any man can only dream to be, while indeed the daughter of that Empress met a very deplorable fate in France soon thereafter.  No doubt French are obsessed to this day about what a girl should do, and Natalie plays into the game.

Overall, Dessay's art presented on this DVD beats any expectations, no matter how high.  I expected a lot, of course, after listening to her other DVD ""Le Rossignol"" on Stravinsky's music; predictably, she sang the nightingale and I was struck then by the beauty of her voice.  But in that DVD she does not get to act too much; here her overall talent is given an opportunity to show itself in full glory, and it shines!  Certainly she is not as conventionally beautiful as Anna Netrebko, for example, but as an overall opera actress of today she is so much more superior to Anna Netrebko, Renee Fleming and just about any soprano since she sings better or just as well and can act as no one else can.  Natalie Dessay is a tremendous, genius and genuine actress and singer.

A must to see and hear.",1302307200,2,5610,4.736896197327852
2550270,5,B000F3T3BO,"If I wanted a DVD to show friends why they should even consider the idea that they could enjoy opera, THIS WOULD BE THE ONE!

Among many other vignettes, this contains three different performances, over the years of the ""Olympia, the doll"" scene from Tales of Hoffmann.  They each have something to add to the repertoire.  For me, the outdoor performance of 2000 was dazzling with Dessay's expressive face, voice, light feet, delightful sense of humor, AND her interaction with a half dozen gigantic dolls!  Comparing the three performances might be a great way to introduce friends to the splendid art of opera.

All the arias are wonderful, but I also have to mention her Lucia di Lammermoor:  it is so dramatic and heart-wrenching that I was afraid she was going to collapse.  It really does bring back thoughts of Maria Callas.

Whether you've seen Natalie Dessay, or just read the reviews, you will soon see that she is everything we dream of in an opera singer:  great (amazing!) singing, outstanding dramatic and humorous acting, and a bundle of energy that just can't be contained.",1262476800,5,1089,4.8432432432432435
2550271,5,B000F3T3BO,"This cd demonstrates the tremendous range that she can display, and its very likely we've not even seen the best of Natalie Dessay as yet!

performed piece.  This DVD contains quite a number of different segments taken from operas in which she has
sung.  The most memorable is the ""Voice of Spring"" by Strauss within the opera ""Der Fleidermaus"" where Natalie
literally electrifies the audience and this viewer with her rendition. She also hits high F's in the ""Magic Flute"" number.  Her comments are very interesting and greatly add to her performances.

In the second version of Hoffmann, she is a crippled woman in what seemed to be a mental hospital, not a doll.  I think I had this on dvd years ago, only it was called DES Contes d'Hoffmann - I remembered.  I threw it away long ago.

In Hamlet she opened veins.  The blood spurted from her breasts and splashed down her dress.  The audience loved it.

And in Orpheus she had intercourse with a fly.

I thought I'd just discovered her with Regiment, and I loved her and so I bought this dvd.  Now I'm afraid to buy anything else by her.

If I had read a review like mine first, I would not have bought this.  I hated it.

8116890,5,B000F3T3BO,"More than two years ago in October 2013 Natalie Dessay announced that she was retiring from the operatic stage. Dessay was born April 19, 1965. She trained as both a ballet dancer and an actress and did not commence singing lessons until the age of twenty, 1985 or so. In 1991 she won the International Mozart Competition in Vienna. In 1992 she sang Olympia in Offenbach's Tales of Hoffman which became one of her signature roles and her operatic and concert stage career had begun. In a recent interview published in the January 2016 issue of BBC Music Magazine she relates ""...When I was 20 I said that I would stop by the time I was 50, and I did. Only a little early. I'm glad..."". Those on the outside can only imagine the grueling nature of operatic stage performance. And many operatic performers do not enjoy singing aged 21 roles when they are into their fifties and beyond, though many do. In 2001 Dessay was diagnosed with vocal nodules and underwent some three years of treatment before returning to singing. Some of the earliest performances on this DVD date from 1993 including the opening selection from the ""GALA"" scene of Act II of Die Fledermaus. Otherwise this DVD may be unique in that it contains three different stagings of ""Les oiseaux dans la charmille"" from Tales of Hoffman and also shown are two different stagings of the same scene from Ariadne auf Naxos by Strauss. Rarely does the viewer/listener have the opportunity to experience such comparisons. But, perhaps the highlight of this DVD is the Mad Scene from Lucia with it's length of time on stage and the virtual exhaustion of the Dessay in doing it. However, in addition is the Mad Scene from Thomas: Hamlet, which can be excruciating to watch and at times the eyes seek aversion from it's intensity. One can wonder how she might have performed Salome? Dessay is in reality a ""singing actress"".
