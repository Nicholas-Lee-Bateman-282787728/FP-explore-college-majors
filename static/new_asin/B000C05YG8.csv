Alexander Sokurov's austere, moody and claustrophobic chamber piece, ""The Sun,"" takes place in Tokyo in 1945, just as the victorious American forces are overtaking the city.  The focus of the film is on Emperor Hirohito (believed by his subjects to be a direct descendent of the Sun goddess Amaterasu ) who, holed up in a bunker in the royal palace, agonizes over how such an ignominious fate could have befallen his nation and his people - and the part he himself may have played in bringing that outcome about.

Hirohito spends much of the first half of the film engaging in deep introspection and personal recrimination, blaming himself for having placed too much faith in the power of the Empire and for relying too heavily on the enthusiasm of the soldiers rather than properly equipping the army.  Meanwhile, he pores over old family photo albums as well as pictures of glamorous Hollywood stars of the time, suggesting that he clearly doesn't despise all things American, even if that nation has become the cause of his downfall.

In the second half of the movie, Hirohito finds himself under house arrest, where his American captors ply him with wine and chocolate bars as they negotiate the terms of his surrender.  Then he's brought before General MacArthur himself, who treats the defeated emperor with outward politeness but inward condescension and dismissiveness.  The result is a subtle little game of cat-and-mouse in which two of the great figures of their time vie for position and power - both personal and diplomatic.

A largely fictionalized, impressionistic account of historical events, ""The Sun"" is definitely an acquired taste.  Its subdued tone, spare settings and desultory pacing may be off-putting to some in the audience, and the acting by the American performers is amateurish in the extreme.  But there's a haunting quality to the film as well, as a man once convinced of his own infallibility, divinity and immortality is forced to face the fact that, like the rest of humanity, he has feet of clay - and finds what a truly liberating and unburdening thing that can be in the long run.",1292803200,6,2126,4.9299719887955185
2451314,1,B000C05YG8,"Be forewarned that this is not a documentrary.  To the contrary, it is a slow, static and imponderable foreign-language film containing minimal dialogue, wooden acting and a paucity of action. Boils down to a barely watchable one-man show most notable for its lenghty pauses, odd facial mannerisms and endless ritual bowings. To add to the misery, the subtitles disappear whenever English is spoken, which hampers the accessibity of hearing impaired viewers.  This is is doubly unfortunate, since the ""Emperor's"" spoken English is broken and barely comprehensible--even to people that can hear perfectly.",1287964800,4,604,5.554347826086956

i was bored. a sense of civic duty kepy me from swapping dvds to ""The best of mr. monk"" or some other dvds i am anxious to enjoy. and enjoying is not any part of my experience with this docu/drama.
i was bothered with the slow pace. ironically the subtitles  were  unnecessarily fast.
hirohito's mannerisms suggested he was emotionally challenged- hich while true , the point was over emphasized.
""i got it, i got it"" i thought when another superflous scene seemed more to remind us again and again of his stifled  stiff slow formalized  mannerisms.

2451316,4,B000C05YG8,"""The Sun"" is the third film in Russian director Aleksandr Sokurov's tetralogy about powerful political figures as they suffer personally from their poor decisions. The first two films were about Adolf Hitler and Vladimir Lenin. ""The Sun"" is about Hirohito, Emperor of Japan, just after the Japanese surrender in 1945. The Emperor (Issey Ogata) is under house arrest in a building on the grounds of the Imperial Palace while the Allies decide what to do with him. He is attended by a chamberlain (Shiro Sano) and an elderly manservant, who try to preserve his normal routine. He is briefed by his ministers on the state of the war effort, he studies marine biology, takes a nap, writes his son, sees a guest, and meets General Douglas MacArthur (Robert Dawson), Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan, for the first time.

The way Sokurov presents this series of events gives the impression that it all happened in one day. Looking closely, that is not explicit but implicit, though the events actually took place over the course of months. There is much debate over the degree to which the Emperor was in control of the Japanese military and therefore responsible, or not, for ""war crimes"". ""The Sun"" takes the view that was adopted by the United States and its Allies, and therefore by the Japanese, after the war: Hirohito was isolated, easily manipulated by those more ambitious than himself, and a bit clueless. He was just a figurehead, and the Allies wanted him to continue to be so as Japan recovered from the devastation of war. Presented this way, Hirohito seems a lot like King Louis XVI of France or Tsar Nicholas II of Russia.

Sokurov paints Hirohito as a well-meaning fool who has an embarrassing nervous tick, is preoccupied with his interest in marine biology, and summons a scientist whose research institute has been destroyed to discuss the Northern Lights, all while Japan is in crisis and the Emperor must contemplate the implications of renouncing his divine origins. But Sokurov respects the Emperor, because he placed the future of his nation above his own pride. He surrendered. He did what was asked of him by his conquerors to smooth the transition to an occupied and new Japan. I suppose this would be true whether or not he was responsible for war crimes.

The Emperor does everything with slow deliberation, which sets the film's pace. It's slow. Issey Ogata looks remarkably like Hirohito, though I don't know if the nervous tick is accurate. The content of  conversations between Hirohito and MacArthur is uncertain and may have been fictionalized. Although Ogata's performance is impressive, ""The Sun"" would not have much meaning were these not true events. So veracity is an essential component of the film's worth, and I don't think Sokurov was concerned with history so much as his impression of the Emperor's character at a time of crisis. The subdued, dreamy cinematography, also by Sokurov, is admirable, as is Ogata's portrayal, but I wouldn't take ""The Sun"" to be history. In English and Japanese.

The DVD (Kino/Lorber 2010): Bonus features are ""Production Notes by Aleksandr Sokurov"" (text) taken from an interview with the director, a Russian theatrical trailer (1 min), and a Stills Gallery of 19 production stills. English subtitles are available for the film.",1275696000,11,3315,4.9765342960288805
2451317,2,B000C05YG8,"One of the strangest movies I've seen in a very long time, it is about the final days of World War II and the life of the Japanese emperor Hirohito. I am not sure if he really spoke in a strange, affected way, or if he always made an O with his mouth and jutted his lips out, but that's what you see in the movie. Made by Russian director Alexander Sokurov, the film has a small cast and limited locations, making it feel like a stage play.",1243641600,,440,4.011363636363637
2451318,5,B000C05YG8,"Sokurov has superceeded even his recent achievements with this simply awesome piece. Ogata's staggering performance as Emporer Hirohito is the film's pivot. Not a moment of exaggeration, mannerism or overstated camerawork. The interplay of a gloved hand, of light catching the lower rim of one eye, the regimented deep space of the palace, the ambient short-wave sound track in Hirohito's study as he jots off a haku - the list is long. An apocolyptic dream shakes him from a noonday nap. It's one of cinema's most impressive dream sequences, in keeping with the Emporer's biological passions. Later, he scans a print of Durer's,'Four Riders' which, when the camera pounces on him from behind, mysteriously enlargens so that Hirohito's head swims in its detail. As a sustained study of profound pathos, the film has no equal. The Emporer's Chaplinesque antics before the GI's cameras in his front garden are unspeakably humiliating. The annihilation of the Empire, and with it the sombre lifestyle, liberates him from the absurdly suffocating protocols that attended his deification. The film ends with him in hand with his wife, imprisioned in his palace, but 'free' to enjoy the pleasures of his children. As a raid on the inarticulate, a devastation, a change of beliefs, the abiding state of the Emporer's mind is evinced in his inability to speak. He goes to speak, the words won't come; unmitigated shock has jettisoned his tongue from his mind.",1166572800,33,1451,5.100840336134453

2451340,4,B000C05YG8,"I was searching for Japanese films on the subject of the 2nd World War, when I found this gem. While it isn't actually a Japanese production (it is in fact a Russian film), the story is told from the perspective of the emperor in the last days of the war. Some of the struggle that takes place, both between members of the imperial council, as well as that within the emperor himself, is captured. What isn't captured, is an attempted coup by Army extremists, or any indication of the emperors role in war crimes committed in his name during the war.

What we do see is a man struggling to hold himself together, surrounded by advisors perhaps unwilling to tell him the plain truth, partially due to tradition, and of course their own state of denial, yet able to see that his country is in ruins, and indirectly aware of how his people must be suffering. Restricted by tradition, and the rigid control that the military has on the country, Hirohito must decide the course of his future, and that of his country.

Issei Ogata, the actor playing the emperor, adds some odd quirks and ticks to his portrayal, which I don't know whether they are based in reality. But it adds a sense of both detachment from the world, and an inability to completely empathize with the character, which I feel is intentional. He is about to shed his divine status, and become a human being. The interactions between the emperor and General McCarthur is also fascinating. The total cultural disconnect is evident in all of the interactions between the Americans and the Japanese of the imperial court.

The scene that touched me the most is when the empress Kojun makes her appearance. While it starts off awkward and strained, there is a subtle yet clear tenderness between the two as they discuss their future. I feel that this scene was superbly played by the two actors.

I feel that this is a must see film for those interested in the Pacific War from a Japanese perspective.",1445385600,2,1959,4.620689655172414

2451348,3,B000C05YG8,"Bizarre and curious yet oddly entertaining.  The movie is set almost entirely in the underground bunker of the Japanese Emperor in the final few months of World War 2.  In watching this movie the character almost seems to be a prisoner in many ways and he seems to be close to a breakdown with odd facial ticks and a resigned demeanor about the inevitability of defeat.  It is an interesting viewpoint that is presented, but whether it is in any way authentic or accurate I do not know.  It is curiously fascinating yet ultimately not entirely fulfilling.  It reminded me a great deal of the Last Emperor or even Castaway where you feel tremendous sadness over the characters predicament and their seeming inability to do much more than survive their ordeal.",1433721600,,758,4.755725190839694

2451362,3,B000C05YG8,"As with the other 2 films in Sokurov's ""tetralogy of evil"" [I haven't yet been able to view Taurus] this film feels very slow, and much stronger on the visuals than on the dialog.  I was feeling tired as I started, and soon was fighting to stay awake for the whole viewing.
I've seen commentary claiming this was an anti-American film, all due to Sokurov being Russian.  I don't think that's a fair criticism.  Obviously during the war and for some time afterward, the Japanese themselves were quite anti-American, and vice-versa.  It's very hard to fight a total war against another country without feeling animosity toward them and justifying your own actions.  Japan at the time was highly imperialistic and committed atrocities [not that we haven't had some of our own problems in that regard, but there's no disputing who started this war, how they treated our captured soldiers, etc.}  But as with Moloch, the other common enemy of the U.S. and of Russia during World War II, the focus here is not on the war itself nor even on the population's feelings; the focus is on the Japanese emperor.

As Sokurov portrays him, he is almost a captive in his own palace and bunker, cut off from virtually all ordinary Japanese, even largely from his family.  Early on, he gazes at a photo of the empress, and I thought she must have died, because she had not appeared even briefly.  Only toward the end does she arrive on set, and he appears very glad to see her.  Both are dressed in rigid confining clothing; he begins removing at least some of hers, wanting to gaze on her bare face and hair, and she seems just as eager for some intimacy with him.  At the very end they speak of going to another room to visit their children, which we never do see portrayed.  As the film ends, they are headed toward that reunion.

The most bizarre part of the film technically is how often the Emperor's lips are moving while no sound comes out, at least in the region 1 DVD.  My assumption is that he was speaking Japanese, which is translated in a more summary form in the English subtitling and the audio track.

As Sokurov portrays him, the Japanese emperor himself never believed in the Japanese mythology that he was a deity of some sort.  Early on he asserts that at the least, his physical body is like all other humans.  Later he tells his wife that he has completely renounced any divine nature, as part of the process of surrender, and they both speak of this as being positive in that at least they will have a somewhat more normal family life.

He also seems eerily detached from the sufferings of his own people.  While cities are being bombed and thousands dying, he spends time examining a particular species of crab, which he removes from a preservative jar, making notes about its anatomy.

A briefly portrayed MacArthur is depicted as treating the emperor with the respect often shown to enemy leaders, even in defeat.  Subsequently of course, both Japan and Germany became, at least officially, staunch friends of the US, though in both countries there still is anti-American sentiment among some of the population at large.

We do not see details of the surrender process, nor his receipt of the news about Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nor his speech to the Japanese people regarding surrender.  All we see of his feelings about defeat, are his composing some lines of verse in Japanese, struggling to put his feelings on paper.  The overall sense in this depiction is not about arrogance and imagined omnipotence, but of sadness and isolation.

It will be interesting to see his portrayal of Lenin in Taurus, and whether that is much different from the other 3 films.  Once again, this is a predominantly visual study of an unseen inner personality which can only be inferred.  In the very last scene the emperor asks something about the man who transmitted his radio surrender speech, is told he had committed suicide, asks if anyone tried to stop him, then walks out, without further comment.",1421625600,2,3996,4.687679083094556

2451366,1,B000C05YG8,"This movie was straight up awful and boring. I guess there are movies that I hate worse than this, and ones that I would give one star to more maliciously, but this was indeed pretty bad and grating. It is absurdly slow and boring. Nothing really happens. I am really not one to bring up WWII and the morality blame game, but if I do see a movie that seems to assign blame, of course I'd want to see America be the good guy, especially after Pearl Harbor. This movie more or less comes down in favor of Japan and blames America as the bad guy in addition to having roughly zero plot and zero emotional payoff. I guess the Americans do act arrogant and vindictive, and I'm sure there was plenty of that during a time of war after watching their friends get killed by the Japanese. My problem is that this movie comes down so one-sidedly in favor of the nation that started the war and it is hard to watch this propaganda. This is in addition to the fact that this movie has zero artistic merit. The blurb states that the emperor ""wanders around the palace in a child like daze,"" and they got that right. You just have no idea how painfully boring it is to watch him do that, though. I guess this movie taps into the Japanese sense of philosophical contemplation, but I really really don't get it. Perhaps this movie is genius in Japan, and fits their sensibilities greatly, and if so I apologize, but as an American, there is not much in there for me. I've got no real problem giving this one star. I was expecting a more beautiful yet robust movie, and I just got the tinkering of a strange and peculiar old man.",1415491200,,1612,4.305921052631579

MacArtjhur is portrayed quite well and the emperor's interactions with him are true to the spirit of what happened, if not exactly the facts. The major flaw lies in the total absense of Brigadeer General Bonner Fellers, who, as MacArthur's Aide regarding the emperor, played a major role in the whole affair. He should at least have been shown but there was no hint he ever existed. In addition, the film shows the Americans going to the palace and bringing the emperor to MacArthur. This is not the way it happened, and not the way MacArthure wanted it. What happened is, the emperor came to MacArthur in his own car at a time of his own decision. In addition, the American Major who was shown as MacArthur's interpreter, was shown as far more defferential to the emperor than an American officer would likely have been in the days just following the surrender (though the actor did speak near perfect Japanese).

From the very first scene, I wondered how the lead actor could get away with portraying hirohito as being so degenerate, manipulative, devious and most obviously, totally unattractive.  I'm surprised ninjas haven't paid him a visit yet and helped him write his suicide note.

""Merci, pour le chocolat!""

ETA:  the film shows Hirohito having two photographs in his possession of Hitler with the Kaiser behind World War 1 who was officially at odds with Hitler so maybe the filmmaker is hinting that Hitler was just an actor hired to be the front man in the show of World War 2 so the Habsburgs wouldn't be in trouble with their British cousins again.",1371686400,,1040,4.578378378378378

2451397,5,B000C05YG8,"This is the third entry of a tetralogy about the power. The first was Molkh, the Second was Taurus and the cycle ended with taurus from 2011. Sokurov share honors with the missed director Theo Angelopoulos tracing the same road previously for other unforgettable poets of the cinema: Robert Bresson and Andrei Tarkovsky.

Sokurov makes a thoughtful insight about the livings of the Emperor Hirohito fallen in disgrace after the devastating defeat in 1945.

Gradually the Emperor shows us his human side with his virtues and demerits; his memories and nostalgias.

A slow-paced film with a rewarding script and firm narrative pulse.",1361059200,,631,5.166666666666667
2451398,1,B000C05YG8,"I was very disppointed in this film, as it's inaccuracy is staggering.  The film starts out before Japan's surrender, while the emperor is living in a bomb shelter on the palace grounds; the movie shows a palace above this, but virtually all the palace buildings were destroyed during allied bombings, and weren't replaced until the '60s.  Then there is a scene of a cabinet meeting in which Hirohito tells the ministers that they will continue the war.  Here's were the film slips into fiction - it depicts the emperor going up to his bedroom, where he awaits the arrival of the occupying Americans.  No depiction or mention of the surrender, in which Hirohito played a vital role by recording and then broadcasting his surrender speech to the nation (and in which a group of hardliners tried to prevent it's broadcast).  It does seem the screen writer confused this speech with his deification renunciation.  In the film, it shows the emperor reaching this decision on his own, and then mentions that he recorded the speech for broadcast - in reality, the renunciation of his deity was something mandated by the US occupying forces, and he read out loud in a speech to the Diet (Japanese parliament).  The film does not portray the efforts by the Japanese government or statesmen to shield the emperor from responsibility for the war, or to preserve his place in the Japanese state.  The film depicts both Hirohito and McArthur as caricatures - I've read Hirohito had an unusual, stiff walk, but I don't recall ever reading that he continuously puckered his mouth like a fish out of water, as the film shows.  Given the gross historical inaacuracy of this film, I can't see giving it more than one star.",1294358400,3,1705,4.791808873720137
8094939,5,B000C05YG8,"""The Sun"" is a remarkable film by Russian filmmaker Aleksandr Sokurov, which imagines the Japanese Emperor Hirohito in his daily activities just before, during and after Japan's defeat in World War II. The filming style is diaphanous and tense at the same time, with emphasis on the anachronistic gentleness and cultured manners of the Emperor God during the cataclysmic bombing of Tokyo.

Hirohito is confronted by General Douglas MacArthur who invites him (by way of armed MPs) to a one-on-one dinner, so that MacArthur could determine for himself if Hirohito would be tried as a war criminal. The film has a very Zen-like quality to it and may not be interesting to younger viewers or those with no deeper interest in history, but this film is an absolute must for visionaries and historians who are fascinated with the period. The Sun is one film from Sokurovs tetralogy of films about power and empire, particularly regarding World War II axis leaders.",1508630400,,957,4.98125

8094946,4,B000C05YG8,"Very sympathetic portrayal of the emperor and hit it right on the nose as to why Japan decided to take on the U.S., Britain and France.  I was so shocked to hear that when my Japanese grandparents in the cane and pineapple fields of Maui and Oahu first heard of the attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, they all cheered, ""Ten no hiko banzai"".  Why I asked my mom? She said because my grandparents went from kids living in medieval Japan in the 1890's to witnessing a fully modern Japan take on the west with the most advanced weapons of the time, the Zero fighters.  They were so proud that they helped contribute to the modernization of Japan by sending back money but more importantly contribute to what they believed was a wrong done to Japanese people and Asians in general with the U.S. cutting off all legal immigration to the U.S. in 1924 - what the Japanese in Japan in the U.S. felt was a double standard for a country who prided themselves in meritocracy and fair play.  My grandparents truly believed that the emperor and Japan were part of a great push to drive the Europeans out of Asia.  Ironically, asked my mom and dad about the nisei in Hawaii and their reaction at the time and they said that the day after Pearl Harbor they all lined up at the U.S. Army recruitment office to volunteer to fight off the empire of Japan, (At the time they thought there would be an eminent land invasion by the Japanese - it would have been civil war with the Nissei having to fight their Issei parents, thank the Lord that didn't happen).  I think my only criticism of the movie was the very ""Russian"" skew of the American occupation and especially of MacArthur.  From all accounts I have read it was the MacArthur respect for Japanese culture and the institution of the Emperor that spared the Emperor's life.  Furthermore, for Nisei like my father who served as part of the U.S. Army elite military intelligence service sent to the Pacific front as translators and administrators - they thought of themselves as 100% American and thought of the divinity of the Emperor complete Nippon bunk.",1462492800,3,2097,4.543766578249337
