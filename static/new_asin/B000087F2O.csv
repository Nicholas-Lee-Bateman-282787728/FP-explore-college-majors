7979298,1,B000087F2O,"I've watched only two of the movies in this set, ""Drums in the Deep South"" and ""Hellbenders."" On the strenth of just those two I can tell you that if you know ANYTHING about the Civil War (or even if you don't) you won't want to spend money on this set. The only good thing I can say about ""Drums"" is that it is not quite so nearly excrement as ""Hellbenders."" These are absolutely awful. ""Blood and Honor"" and ""Hearts in Bondage"" might be better, but taking the chance is not worth the cost of the postage.",1349481600,,506,4.22680412371134
7979299,4,B000087F2O,"CONTENTS of CIVIL WAR 4 Movie Pack:

BLOOD AND HONOR-- Low-rent soaper has little to recommend it. Battle scenes aren't believeable and the characters garner little sympathy despite their woes. Featured in the small-name cast is Michelle Bauer, former Playmate centerfold whose screen credits include roles in ""Bimbo Penitentiary,"" ""Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama,"" ""Wet Shots: Girls Who Dig Girls #2,"" ""Jane Bonda's Bizarre Workout,"" ""Wine Me, Dine Me, 69 Me"" and other (ahem) classics.

DRUMS IN THE DEEP SOUTH-- Fictional story based in fact: the siege of a mountaintop gun position during Sherman's Georgia campaign. Two best friends are artillerymen on opposite sides in the war. Events have them squared off in what may be a deadly duel that the woman who loves both of them tries to avert. Starts slow, but momentum builds to an ending unconventional for 1951. Director W.C. Menzies also worked on ""Gone With the Wind.""

HEARTS IN BONDAGE-- Directed by Lew Ayres (Dr. Kildare in movies), who was a conscientious objector during WWII. Fictional characters are placed within the USS Monitor vs. CSS Virginia events. Fine cast is well-used here. (Look for Oscar-winner Hattie McDaniel's sister Etta as ""Mammy."")

HELLBENDERS-- Spaghetti western concerning an ex-Confederate officer who plans to steal old cash destined for burning so he can finance a revival of the ""late unpleasantness"" (the war).
