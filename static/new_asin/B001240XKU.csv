3075126,5,B001240XKU,I purchased this DVD because I love to have interesting stuff on my flat screen. This is a very good quality DVD with very peaceful videos of marine life. The fish are very calming and the transitions are extremely smooth. This is a great video to leave on while entertaining. The music is very calming. I am also an avid scuba diver so it was also nice to se all the marine life. I hope to see more of these videos in the future.,1206489600,39,430,4.130952380952381

3075366,4,B001240XKU,This a good DVD to use as a background in an office.  My office has no windows so I use this on a video wall.  It provides a nice background to look at from time to time.  This video falls just short of excellent because so many of the scenes look so much alike.  The fish life is just okay.  So it is a good video but not a great video.,1422489600,,337,3.6901408450704225

I feel as though it is exactly what it is portrayed to be in the Amazon description.  From my perspective, seeing these beautiful creatures in their natural habitat is much more satisfying that looking at a film on someone's aquarium.  This is a nice documentary piece on oceanic life but I have found it to be a healing tool as I recover from the operation.",1422316800,3,507,4.3052631578947365

3075377,5,B001240XKU,"This really looks like diving on a reef. The water is slightly hazy which only affects the distant fish and adds to the realism. Colours are natural looking rather than over bright.
Good variety of sea life.
DVD is long enough that looping is not obtrusive.
It is scaled well for a TV so the butterfly fish don't look the size of sharks and there are many fish on the screen at one time.
Very minor criticism is that depth of field could be a little greater.
This DVD is great. I am going to have to get the other two in the series.",1416614400,3,532,4.125

When I first watched Reefscapes I was in awe. The filming is excellent, no camera movement. The color and clarity gives the impression you could be at an aquarium looking through a window into the ocean. I have had other ""ocean dvds"", but no comparison. Absolutely breathtaking.

3075494,5,B001240XKU,"Reefscapes: Nature's Aquarium (Second Edition) is definitely the best of the five different aquarium DVD's that I bought.  Reefscapes has a one hour main feature (Nature's Aquarium) and a 20 minute bonus feature (A Closer Look).  The bonus feature often shows one or two fish at a time in their natural environment with the name of the fish displayed.  The bonus feature also shows the names of the different corals.  The DVD gives you the option of showing or hiding the names of the fish and corals in the bonus feature.  The main feature does not show the names of the fish or corals.  Both the main feature and the bonus feature give you the option of playing relaxing music or natural sounds from the reef (it sounds like aquarium bubbles).  The relaxing music and the natural sounds play non-stop for the entire 60 minutes of the main feature and for the entire bonus feature.  The last 35 seconds of the main feature displays the names of the production crew against a black background while the relaxing music or natural sounds continue to play. The bonus feature has a 30 second similar ending.  Both the main feature and the bonus feature restarts automatically.  Of the five aquarium DVD's, Reefscapes and one other DVD is tied for first place for the loudest ""aquarium bubbles"".  I have noisy neighbors that make a lot of noise in the hallway outside of my room.  The loud ""aquarium bubbles"" drown out their noise (unlike the three other DVD's).  In the main feature, the scene changes about every 60 seconds, and every scene is different.  Every underwater ocean scene in the main feature has lots of corals and fish.  The scenes in the bonus feature changes about every 15 seconds, and every scene is different.",1372723200,12,1725,4.722408026755853

3075532,5,B001240XKU,"The quality of this DVD from Undersea Productions is impressive. The disc comes in a good quality case. The widescreen video is not HD, but it is clear and vibrant. There is an audio option to listen to either underwater sounds or tranquil music. The main video feature is about an hour in length and features video shot from various fixed-positions on the reef. The transitions fade from one location to another. The bonus feature is about 20 minutes of moving and close-up shots with optional subtitles showing the common names of different species of fish. The DVD automatically loops playback for either the main feature or the bonus feature. To switch between the two features access the DVD menu. There is a short segment with title and credits during play-back-loop, but do not worry, it is very short and transitions nicely back to the beginning.
I am very pleased with this DVD and have no complaints. I highly recommend this product for people who want to see beautiful scenery without narration. I also recommend it for imaginative kids (or adults) who want to pretend they are living in a home under the sea.
I am glad that this DVD is ""all-regions."" In other words, it does NOT have the annoying regional encoding playback restrictions common to most DVDs. This DVD should play on most DVD players from all over the world as long as the players read NTSC format and have not been programmed to reject ""all-region"" DVDs.

But still, the scenes are really nice and it is an enjoyable, relaxing DVD.  One other reason I knocked off a star is because if you choose the natural sound instead of music, you hear water running (like in a brook?) but the scene is under water as if you were diving or snorkling (neither of which would give you that running water sound).  It's not like I expected to hear bubbles or something. There's not much that you would hear under water as shown in the scene. I  just didn't want the music. The running water sound is calming, so it's not like it bugs me.  It just doesn't match the scene. So if you don't want to hear running water with an underwater scene, just turn down the volume and enjoy viewing the fish swimming around.",1356393600,2,907,4.280701754385965

3075552,3,B001240XKU,"The video can be watched in two modes.  Just general views of a reef or up close on various fish.  The up close view identifies the fish you are watching.  The general view just doesn't give you much color or clarity or what I expected to see on a reef.  It's as if someone was just generally filming without regard to content. I really wanted to see the vibrant colors of reefs that I've seen in the Exumas but the water clarity isn't crisp and color lacking.  The up close portion is more enjoyable but the credits run at the end of the loop and with the identification of fish showing on the screen, there is no illusion of a fish tank that I've seen with other videos.  While the music is soothing, I would have enjoyed perhaps the option of listening to bubbles or the sound of the ocean.",1348790400,4,793,4.253333333333333

3075563,3,B001240XKU,"I found the ""Reefscapes Nature's Aquarium"" DVD, to be boring boring, boring!.

Quality, colors and audio were very good with the exception of occasional pixelation. That; however, usually went away after a few seconds. The problem with the main portion of the DVD is that the scenes appeared to have been selected on the basis of sheer number of  small fish. While the colors were vivid [predominately orange] , the feeling that I had was not that of snorkeling on a coral reef; but rather that of looking at an over crowded fish tank in the pet section of a discount store. Even on our 50"" HDTV the fish were small and the sheer quantity of the little orange fellows just overwhelmed. I will probably not watch the main video again.

The 20 minute Bonus Feature, ""Reefscapes: A Closer Look"" was excellent!  If the hour long portion of the DVD had been done like the bonus section I would probably have rated it five stars.  Both parts have great colors; remarkable visibility; OK audio; and [hallelujah] no commentary.

The Bonus part consists of close up views of common reef fish in their natural environment. The scenes reminded me of a number of snorkel trips in places like the Great Barrier Reef; Hawaii; Bonaire; Tahiti, the Caribbean, etc. I would have liked to have seen shots of some of the other common reef dwellers -- like moray eels, octopi; lobsters, barracuda, tarpon, squid, sea cucumbers, and maybe even a sea-horse [memories of Bonaire] -- to name a few; and for the camera to have followed the individual fish for a longer period of time.

Overall I was very disappointed in the Reefscapes DVD. I had planned to give them as Christmas presents  to each of our four kids but I am now back to square one.",1322784000,11,1723,4.6262295081967215

I'd also love to see a Kelp forest version or a deep sea version with jellyfish and exotic denizens of the deep.",1303862400,,368,4.426470588235294

3075587,5,B001240XKU,Very cool under water shots.  Feels like you are right there filming it yourself.  I give it many stars.,1302307200,,104,4.421052631578948
3075588,5,B001240XKU,"This is an amazing DVD....  It turns your big screen TV into a life-like aquarium.

If you are looking for a DVD that brings the ocean into your living room this is the best DVD I have found.

Highly recommended",1301270400,,211,4.225
3075589,5,B001240XKU,"This is a great DVD.  I almost did not purchase it because a reviewer's comments about small fish.  Glad I did.  It is a series of reefs with fish in natural environment.  Beautiful in widescreen.  Relaxing to watch.  This is not an artificial aquarium where one expects to look at fish as if they were an anatomy project.  It is a view of reef life.  If you were to purchase a DVD called 'Landscapes', you would not expect to look at one leaf on a tree, right?  I like this DVD very much.",1286582400,14,489,4.172043010752688
3075590,5,B001240XKU,"This is GREAT.
I love the fact that the camera is in one position for long enough to really enjoy what you are seeing.  I also love the fact that you have a choice between either natural soundtrack or music.  This is a difficult option to find in relaxation tapes.",1286582400,27,264,4.26
3075591,4,B001240XKU,"I purchased this dvd to show my art students before we started our Sea Life paintings. The Upclose portion was about 20 minutes long and the students were fascinated and motivated. (great dvd for all ages) The longer version would have been too boring for them.
The longer version is more for relaxing, background for a party or event. The entire dvd would be wonderful for Alzheimer's patients to watch instead of putting them in front of a loud tv show that they will never be able to comprehend. Many Alzheimer's patients have anxiety and this beautiful dvd would be very soothing to them.",1286582400,20,592,4.701923076923077
3075592,2,B001240XKU,"This is an ok reefscape. I got it for my son, but he didn't find it very interesting. It could be my TV, but the colors are kind of dull, and the music is not the best. Oh well, I'll keep looking for a good one.",1274745600,3,211,3.608695652173913
3075593,3,B001240XKU,"The bonus feature, Reefscapes: A Closer Look is exactly what I was looking for.  However, the main 1 hour film is rather boring in that it shows mostly small fish.  It is not something I would sit down and spend an hour watching.  The quality of picture is quite good and I like the choice of digital audios.",1270166400,8,308,4.275862068965517
3075594,5,B001240XKU,"The clarity of this video is amazing and the music so relaxing. We turn it on all the time just to have soothing music while having company over and it's also so wonderful to look at. I went to their own personal web-site to view some clips of the video, as well as, you tube. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1266451200,,314,4.163934426229508
3075595,5,B001240XKU,"UNPARALLELED. Looked far and wide before stumbling on this rich, widescreen, highly detailed, ultra colorful treasure. Anyone/everyone we share it with is awestruck at the crystal clear water and endless schools of magnificently colored fish in perfect focus. This is no amateur film crew. Their work rivals anything I've ever seen ANYWHERE.....and then takes it one step beyond.

  Subtle transitions and peaceful background music will have you watching it for it's full hour length and leave you wanting more....which there is. Also included is a 2nd section of about 20mins which is even more mesmerizing as the film crews hoist their cameras from the ocean floor and swim with them through Polynesias most unreal reefs and tropical underwater gems.

If you don't buy this you will regret it. BUYER BEWARE you may have an unquenchable need to visit these locations after viewing. See their samples vids by doing a web search for underseaproductions

3075596,3,B001240XKU,"This is an interesting video and one that absolutely mimics a real fish tank.  Very realistic... Almost too realistic wherein you can hear the pump which I found annoying and distracting.  The bubbling sound was fine, but hearing the pump---not so good.",1265760000,8,253,5.0

I've contacted customer service and will be looking forward to receiving a new copy soon.

Too bad -- I was really looking forward to watching it.

I will update my review once I have the opportunity view this DVD.",1264204800,6,411,4.177215189873418
3075599,5,B001240XKU,"Really love this shockingly beautiful video. In my somewhat limited experiences as a scuba diver, I have never seen such pristine and lovely reefs. Actually enjoy the very nicely done musical background more than the "" natural "" bubble sounds which sound slightly off to me, except when on very low volume. If I could change anything, it would be to have the camera linger on many of the scenes for a longer period, because it would be more relaxing, in my opinion. There is so much to take in during each scene that the change of scenery feels a bit rushed to me. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase and look forward to many hours of enjoyment.",1261612800,,652,4.487394957983193
3075600,5,B001240XKU,"Having been to Fiji before, I thought it would be impossible to capture the experience on video.  However, after getting this DVD, I was wrong!  It's just like being on the reef and seeing all the fish and soft coral that Fiji is known for.  I found myself relaxing just as if I was diving: what a treat.  I don't know how the folks who made it did it, but they did a super job of capturing the reef as it truly is.  A must buy for divers and anyone interested in sea life.",1258761600,15,473,3.9893617021276597
3075611,5,B001240XKU,"These are stunning views of a real coral reef.  Lots of colorful fish move through each scene.  Schools of purple and orange fishes swarm over the reef.  Other fishes move through each shot.  Sometimes larger fish are in the background.  The scene periodically changes, with gentle cross-fades that don't interrupt the mood, while giving more variety to what is seen on screen.  The video is really sharp and looks great.  These reefs are really healthy.

This is more interesting than an aquarium.  And on my wide screen HD TV,  is as sharp, more colorful, and as big as a real aquarium.  But I don't have to clean it, or remember to feed the fish.  There's more variety, and just more fish, than you would ever see in an aquarium.  And live corals too.

It's just the thing to play for ambiance, or in a lobby or waiting room.

And if you are really interested in fish like I am, the section ""A Closer Look"" names many of the fish seen on the reef.  It shows a closeup of each one for a little while, with the name displayed on the screen.",1258156800,17,1041,4.371727748691099
3075612,5,B001240XKU,"I just received this DVD and popped it in my computer at work.  I played it on an extra monitor and was blown away by this well-produced look at reef life. As a one-trip-a-year scuba diver, it is a window into the world I only get to see occasionally. The Fiji reefs shown are incredibly healthy, with abundant fish life as well as other sea creatures and beautiful corals. The film quality is top-notch. I was especially taken with the bonus feature of fish and critter close-ups. I know how hard it is to observe natural fish behavior up close while diving, much less film it! I will be looping this at work frequently, and buying another copy to play at home. Really impressed.",1257897600,3,680,4.483870967741935
3075613,5,B001240XKU,"Our first video didn't have the bonus section that gave the names of the fish, so I emailed the contact.  They were VERY helpful.  Not only did they send another video that worked perfectly, they sent an extra to give as a gift.  These people are wonderful.  We were mesmerized, almost hypnotized by the scenes, music, and colors of the video.  ""Reefscapes"" is one of our favorites, and I'm taking it to the next meeting of our dive club.",1257897600,2,438,4.493670886075949
3075614,5,B001240XKU,"WOW! I just put the DVD in and the reefs are amazing. I hope to dive Fiji at one point in my life. At first I thought....this has to be photoshopped, but then I see the surge of the soft corals and too many fish for it not to be an actual reef. Excellent DVD, the best I've ever seen and I own 4 other supposed reef DVD's which are mostly somebody's reef aquarium at home with 5 or 6 fish. 5 stars Mates to the developers which are from Australia.

This is the only one to buy, you will not regret it. Viewing on my 46"" LCD and my BP is now down 20 points. Kids would love this too for you stay at home Mom's that are going nuts over seeing ""Dora the Exployer"" 100 times a day. If you're a scuba diver it will give you the fix you need until you go down again.........Make sure you buy the 2nd edition which is the wide screen version for todays larger TV's.",1257811200,82,858,3.9310344827586206
3075615,5,B001240XKU,"I LOVE this DVD.

It's calm, peaceful and so beautiful.  If you've even been diving or dream of it this DVD is perfect.  I feel like I'm back diving in Fiji whenever I watch it.  I'm giving it to all of my dive friends for Christmas this year.",1257552000,5,243,4.0
3075616,5,B001240XKU,"This DVD is so artistically filmed and edited!  It immerses me into a relaxing zone and is a welcome contrast to TV shows and movies.  It's perfect to show when friends are over for a glass of wine and sometimes I play it while puttering around my house since it has a nice soundtrack too (but it quickly becomes a diversion from my projects as I find myself sitting down to watch it)!  From the professional videographers who created the Marine Life of Fiji and Tonga - these two DVDs complement each other well.  Reefscapes weaves together beautiful and captivating scenes of Fiji's pristine hard and soft coral forests, while the Marine Life DVD provides an in-depth look at the gorgeous creatures living in the reef.  Both are great gifts and timeless additions to any DVD collection.

3075617,2,B001240XKU,"I originally got this and liked the reef sceanery of the main menu selectiion, which worked fine. Then I wanted to check out the second section. I found that the menu hangs up and the begining of the video was badly pixelated but then cleared up and worked fine. I liked the video pictures of the second section even better than the first section, they focused on individual fishes rather than the broad landscape of different parts of the reef.
I sent for a replacement for the bad disc but the replacement DVD was worse than the first DVD disc, it was completely distorted and the menues were hanging up most of the time. I told Amazon about this and sent the replacement back but kept the first DVD disc. Amazon replyed that they would not send me any more replacements.

I like the bonus footage where they show the names of a lot of common reef fish.  You won't watch this for hours on end.  It is very low key.

3309863,4,B001240XKU,This a good DVD to use as a background in an office.  My office has no windows so I use this on a video wall.  It provides a nice background to look at from time to time.  This video falls just short of excellent because so many of the scenes look so much alike.  The fish life is just okay.  So it is a good video but not a great video.,1422489600,,337,3.6901408450704225

I feel as though it is exactly what it is portrayed to be in the Amazon description.  From my perspective, seeing these beautiful creatures in their natural habitat is much more satisfying that looking at a film on someone's aquarium.

3309874,5,B001240XKU,"This really looks like diving on a reef. The water is slightly hazy which only affects the distant fish and adds to the realism. Colours are natural looking rather than over bright.
Good variety of sea life.
DVD is long enough that looping is not obtrusive.
It is scaled well for a TV so the butterfly fish don't look the size of sharks and there are many fish on the screen at one time.
Very minor criticism is that depth of field could be a little greater.

When I first watched Reefscapes I was in awe. The filming is excellent, no camera movement. The color and clarity gives the impression you could be at an aquarium looking through a window into the ocean. I have had other ""ocean dvds"", but no comparison. Absolutely breathtaking.

  I really like that you could choose not to have music or fish identification on screen but also a great option if you did.  My only wish was that it was longer and more species.",1400371200,,391,4.0519480519480515

3309934,1,B001240XKU,"I gave it a one star because when a DVD constantly glitches, hangs, and freezes, it is often due to poor quality production.  The  subject content appears excellent.

3309991,5,B001240XKU,"Reefscapes: Nature's Aquarium (Second Edition) is definitely the best of the five different aquarium DVD's that I bought.  Reefscapes has a one hour main feature (Nature's Aquarium) and a 20 minute bonus feature (A Closer Look).  The bonus feature often shows one or two fish at a time in their natural environment with the name of the fish displayed.  The bonus feature also shows the names of the different corals.  The DVD gives you the option of showing or hiding the names of the fish and corals in the bonus feature.  The main feature does not show the names of the fish or corals.  Both the main feature and the bonus feature give you the option of playing relaxing music or natural sounds from the reef (it sounds like aquarium bubbles).  The relaxing music and the natural sounds play non-stop for the entire 60 minutes of the main feature and for the entire bonus feature.  The last 35 seconds of the main feature displays the names of the production crew against a black background while the relaxing music or natural sounds continue to play. The bonus feature has a 30 second similar ending.  Both the main feature and the bonus feature restarts automatically.  Of the five aquarium DVD's, Reefscapes and one other DVD is tied for first place for the loudest ""aquarium bubbles"".  I have noisy neighbors that make a lot of noise in the hallway outside of my room.  The loud ""aquarium bubbles"" drown out their noise (unlike the three other DVD's).  In the main feature, the scene changes about every 60 seconds, and every scene is different.  Every underwater ocean scene in the main feature has lots of corals and fish.  The scenes in the bonus feature changes about every 15 seconds, and every scene is different.",1372723200,12,1725,4.722408026755853

3309995,5,B001240XKU,"Your Reefscapes: Nature's Aquarium DVD, far exceeded my expectations.  The underwater photography was superior.  It is difficult to describe the clarity of the picture, the brilliant colors of the many sea inhabitants, the sea foliage, and to top it all off the beautifull  clear blue waters of the south Pacific.  This is simply the type of dvd you must see for yourself.  Believe me, if you are looking for undersea beauty at its best, this dvd will not disappoint you.",1370476800,,471,4.8375

3310029,5,B001240XKU,"The quality of this DVD from Undersea Productions is impressive. The disc comes in a good quality case. The widescreen video is not HD, but it is clear and vibrant. There is an audio option to listen to either underwater sounds or tranquil music. The main video feature is about an hour in length and features video shot from various fixed-positions on the reef. The transitions fade from one location to another. The bonus feature is about 20 minutes of moving and close-up shots with optional subtitles showing the common names of different species of fish. The DVD automatically loops playback for either the main feature or the bonus feature. To switch between the two features access the DVD menu. There is a short segment with title and credits during play-back-loop, but do not worry, it is very short and transitions nicely back to the beginning.
I am very pleased with this DVD and have no complaints. I highly recommend this product for people who want to see beautiful scenery without narration. I also recommend it for imaginative kids (or adults) who want to pretend they are living in a home under the sea.
I am glad that this DVD is ""all-regions."" In other words, it does NOT have the annoying regional encoding playback restrictions common to most DVDs. This DVD should play on most DVD players from all over the world as long as the players read NTSC format and have not been programmed to reject ""all-region"" DVDs. All-region is good news for world travelers.",1356566400,10,1477,4.7734375

3310031,4,B001240XKU,"This scenery is nice but I wish it would have come in bluray. I guess we've gotten spoiled with HD and Bluray so we weren't that thrilled with the quality of this DVD.  But still, the scenes are really nice and it is an enjoyable, relaxing DVD.  One other reason I knocked off a star is because if you choose the natural sound instead of music, you hear water running (like in a brook?) but the scene is under water as if you were diving or snorkling (neither of which would give you that running water sound).  It's not like I expected to hear bubbles or something. There's not much that you would hear under water as shown in the scene. I  just didn't want the music. The running water sound is calming, so it's not like it bugs me.  It just doesn't match the scene. So if you don't want to hear running water with an underwater scene, just turn down the volume and enjoy viewing the fish swimming around.",1356393600,2,907,4.280701754385965

The general view just doesn't give you much color or clarity or what I expected to see on a reef.  It's as if someone was just generally filming without regard to content. I really wanted to see the vibrant colors of reefs that I've seen in the Exumas but the water clarity isn't crisp and color lacking.  The up close portion is more enjoyable but the credits run at the end of the loop and with the identification of fish showing on the screen, there is no illusion of a fish tank that I've seen with other videos.

3310060,3,B001240XKU,"I found the ""Reefscapes Nature's Aquarium"" DVD, to be boring boring, boring!.

Quality, colors and audio were very good with the exception of occasional pixelation. That; however, usually went away after a few seconds. The problem with the main portion of the DVD is that the scenes appeared to have been selected on the basis of sheer number of  small fish. While the colors were vivid [predominately orange] , the feeling that I had was not that of snorkeling on a coral reef; but rather that of looking at an over crowded fish tank in the pet section of a discount store. Even on our 50"" HDTV the fish were small and the sheer quantity of the little orange fellows just overwhelmed. I will probably not watch the main video again.

The 20 minute Bonus Feature, ""Reefscapes: A Closer Look"" was excellent!  If the hour long portion of the DVD had been done like the bonus section I would probably have rated it five stars.  Both parts have great colors; remarkable visibility; OK audio; and [hallelujah] no commentary.

The Bonus part consists of close up views of common reef fish in their natural environment. The scenes reminded me of a number of snorkel trips in places like the Great Barrier Reef; Hawaii; Bonaire; Tahiti, the Caribbean, etc. I would have liked to have seen shots of some of the other common reef dwellers -- like moray eels, octopi; lobsters, barracuda, tarpon, squid, sea cucumbers, and maybe even a sea-horse [memories of Bonaire] -- to name a few; and for the camera to have followed the individual fish for a longer period of time.

Overall I was very disappointed in the Reefscapes DVD. I had planned to give them as Christmas presents  to each of our four kids but I am now back to square one.",1322784000,11,1723,4.6262295081967215

Beautiful in widescreen.  Relaxing to watch.  This is not an artificial aquarium where one expects to look at fish as if they were an anatomy project.  It is a view of reef life.

Anyone/everyone we share it with is awestruck at the crystal clear water and endless schools of magnificently colored fish in perfect focus. This is no amateur film crew. Their work rivals anything I've ever seen ANYWHERE.....and then takes it one step beyond.

  Subtle transitions and peaceful background music will have you watching it for it's full hour length and leave you wanting more....which there is. Also included is a 2nd section of about 20mins which is even more mesmerizing as the film crews hoist their cameras from the ocean floor and swim with them through Polynesias most unreal reefs and tropical underwater gems.

Actually enjoy the very nicely done musical background more than the "" natural "" bubble sounds which sound slightly off to me, except when on very low volume. If I could change anything, it would be to have the camera linger on many of the scenes for a longer period, because it would be more relaxing, in my opinion.

Other fishes move through each shot.  Sometimes larger fish are in the background.  The scene periodically changes, with gentle cross-fades that don't interrupt the mood, while giving more variety to what is seen on screen.  The video is really sharp and looks great.  These reefs are really healthy.

This is more interesting than an aquarium.  And on my wide screen HD TV,  is as sharp, more colorful, and as big as a real aquarium.  But I don't have to clean it, or remember to feed the fish.  There's more variety, and just more fish, than you would ever see in an aquarium.  And live corals too.

It's just the thing to play for ambiance, or in a lobby or waiting room.

And if you are really interested in fish like I am, the section ""A Closer Look"" names many of the fish seen on the reef.  It shows a closeup of each one for a little while, with the name displayed on the screen.",1258156800,17,1041,4.371727748691099

As a one-trip-a-year scuba diver, it is a window into the world I only get to see occasionally. The Fiji reefs shown are incredibly healthy, with abundant fish life as well as other sea creatures and beautiful corals. The film quality is top-notch. I was especially taken with the bonus feature of fish and critter close-ups. I know how hard it is to observe natural fish behavior up close while diving, much less film it!

Excellent DVD, the best I've ever seen and I own 4 other supposed reef DVD's which are mostly somebody's reef aquarium at home with 5 or 6 fish. 5 stars Mates to the developers which are from Australia.

This is the only one to buy, you will not regret it. Viewing on my 46"" LCD and my BP is now down 20 points.

From the professional videographers who created the Marine Life of Fiji and Tonga - these two DVDs complement each other well.  Reefscapes weaves together beautiful and captivating scenes of Fiji's pristine hard and soft coral forests, while the Marine Life DVD provides an in-depth look at the gorgeous creatures living in the reef.  Both are great gifts and timeless additions to any DVD collection.

8243698,4,B001240XKU,"My wife asked me to get a pleasant, tranquil motion video for our travel trailer. I selected this Reefscapes video for her and she's quite happy with it. It's not UHD but it's not low quality either. You have the option of also setting it to tranquil music or if I remember correctly some sort of underwater gurgle sound -  or just silence. I guess you could file this under non-toxic ""eye candy"".",1517788800,,397,4.438356164383562
