8067734,4,B0009VKNMK,Grandson loves big equipment and he enjoyed this very much  His dad has some heavy duty construction equipment and this is one little boy who really enjoys everything with construction.,1375488000,,185,5.166666666666667
8067735,1,B0009VKNMK,"I'll start by saying I expected this to have some footage of big trucks and machines doing their thing at the pace they usually do it.  That is not what you get here, it starts with a long series of very quick images randomly speeding past, some machines, some not, they were each up for only a split second and fast enough flashing by to give me a headache.  Then they slowed down and showed earth movers etc for a few minutes and told the name of them etc. but still they were moving by too fast and mostly zoomed in on parts of the machine without showing the whole thing or what it was doing for more than a split second, then Cranes which was actually a good segment for the most part.  After a little of that, they added fast music and had everything speed way up showing road crews making a road in high speed, which might not be so bad but they had everything repeat on short loop (maybe 3 or 4x a second) so that it was very overwhelming for both my kids and I.  Then to end the first episode there was a series of ducks, why ducks, I have no idea, maybe to fill time, but I'd rather they showed the other stuff for longer and slower and left the ducks out.

All in all it seemed very disjointed and poor quality, while I have no doubt they spent many hours editing and most of the footage started out pretty good. I would much rather have a more clean, straightforward show with much longer segments and no looped split second repeated clips, I don't like that and neither do any of my kids. I guess this DVD was made for kids with ADHD, but I can't see how it would be any help as I think it would more likely encourage a short attention span than be of interest to those who already have one. We didn't even watch the second half, because it wasn't worth my half hour to watch more.",1292803200,,1794,4.128939828080229
8067736,2,B0009VKNMK,"My son loves trucks, machines and trains of all kinds. We got him a few DVDs so we could rotate them and not repeat the same one too much. Without question, this one is my least favorite. As another reviewer mentioned, there are montages of images that have NOTHING to do with machines - including a hot air balloon and a montage of real ducks interspersed with a ""Baby Einstein"" type image of a tin toy duck. The sound quality is very poor - it sounds like the track was dubbed from a kid speaking into a circa-1975 tape recorder with one of those little microphones. At one point, the DVD references another DVD from the same manufacturer that we had never heard of! Plus, many of the shots are very-fast motion and barely show the machines working.
Despite all this, my son will watch it because he doesn't understand how random and incongruous this thing is. I, on the other hand, plan to put this in the trash. Really a poor-quality product and not at all worth the money. I highly recommend ""Under Construction"" instead. That is a fantastic DVD that was better than all the other ones we ordered put together.",1225929600,2,1115,4.497536945812808
8067737,5,B0009VKNMK,"My son loves this DVD. He will sit and watch it all the way through (not many DVD's can do this!) I bought this before Christmas and by the time we opened it, we discovered ""Part 1"" did not work. And by the time I had time to return it, it was past the 3 month window from purchase. So if you buy it, be sure it works right away! We can only watch ""Part 2""!",1215993600,,357,3.710526315789474
8067738,4,B0009VKNMK,"Real construction machines on job sites!  What more does a vehicle loving 3 year old need.  By far, the most requested video, even requested more than the Cars movie.",1203724800,,166,4.689655172413793
8067739,1,B0009VKNMK,"My son loves trucks and vehicles. I bought Twenty Trucks (which is great and fun for kids and parnets) after renting it at the library about 20 times.

I Love Big Machines was suggested one I would like. I did not. The editing is abrupt and the volume oscillates. In short, frustrating to watch no matter how much your tot likes big machines (my son tuned out quickly and he has a long attention span for vehicles on film.)",1202428800,2,423,4.3544303797468356
8067740,2,B0009VKNMK,"We got this for our 2 1/2 yr old son who is a big machine lover.  Based on other reviews (for this product and others) we expected lots of great footage.  I was quite disappointed, and so was our son.

The single DVD contains two tracks: ""I Love Big Machines 1"" and ""I Love Big Machines 2"".  These aren't a series, and really have nothing to do with each other.  They are very different quality productions.  ILBM 1 is a series of disjointed images of machines, flashed up on the screen for 1-5 seconds.  The images are shuffled so that there are hot air balloons, diggers, ducks, bulldozers, bridges, etc. in just random order.  Completely baffling to me and my son.  In the beginning and the ending, they flick through the images very rapidly, showing them only a split second each.  I found this disturbing, and so did my son.  I don't know why the producers of this DVD would want to encourage short-attention span viewing of something that can otherwise captivate a child.  If there were negative stars for rating I would give this part of the DVD a -5.

I Love Big Machines 2 was completely different.  It came on with some music and a coherent narration by a child.  A variety of machines were introduced and nice footage was shown at a good pace -- fast enough to keep a child watching for the next bit, but long enough that they can see the dirt dumping out, or the gears turning, or whatever.  The narrator tells us what the machine was called and what it does, while we watched footage of it working.  I would rate this part of the DVD 4 stars... but...

The sound quality of the whole DVD is muffled and at times hard to understand.  I might have raised my overall rating of this DVD to 3 stars if the sound were better.

Overall, this was not a bad purchase, but we prefer DVDs that have a more coherent string of thought.  My son does not suffer from a short attention span, and can watch diggers and trucks for literally hours.  (We live in an area where there is a lot of construction, so I'm referring to watching the real things, not just videos.)  He loves the Dave Hood productions/ Real Wheels Travel Adventures (especially ""There Goes a Bulldozer"") as well as ""All About Construction"", and Totally Trucks ""Dirt Monsters"".  I would recommend any and all of those DVDs above this one.",1197158400,12,2304,4.443914081145585
8067741,4,B0009VKNMK,Our only complaint is the quality of the DVD - it won't play on our DVD player but works on the computer.....  Other than that - it is very much enjoyed by my three year old.,1183852800,,174,3.8333333333333335
8067742,5,B0009VKNMK,"My three year son loves it. Since we received it, he watches it every time that he can. Normally he doesn't like to dance, he started to sing the songs included and now he jumps with them(dancing).
The video shows many machines working at real constructions and some operators explain their jobs.
We bought other DVDs but this is his favorite.",1182902400,,343,4.639344262295082
