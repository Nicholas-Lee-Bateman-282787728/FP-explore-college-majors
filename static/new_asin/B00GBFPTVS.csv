8621942,5,B00GBFPTVS,This instructional DVD is pretty clear from beginning to end....it's not for the faint of heart.  Good luck keeping up.,1486252800,,119,4.95
8621943,5,B00GBFPTVS,"Absolutely amazing! I'm more a tribal fusion advanced belly dancer, but this DVD not only helped me cross-train in a different style, technique-wise, it improved my reaction time and speed. The choreography is sassy, flirty, joyful, and full of energy. Needless to say, it is quite a workout. It took me awhile, but I finally learned the choreo.",1458432000,,345,4.9655172413793105
8621944,5,B00GBFPTVS,A really fun choreography and it's easy to follow with lots of break down and practice. My only critique is that I like to use more of the stage and travel more in my dances than she does. However if you don't have much room to practice that could be a plus.,1424995200,3,258,3.980769230769231
8621945,5,B00GBFPTVS,"Ziva is a powerhouse,  I am so thrilled to have this DVD in my collection.  I am in awe of her drum solos. I learned allot watching this DVD. It is great the way it is broken down. So that different levels of dancers can find a pace that is best for them. I love her creative and cute moves. moves. Defiantly a must have drum solo DVD",1411689600,2,334,3.8970588235294117
8621946,5,B00GBFPTVS,"I see there are no other reviews so I figured I would add one of my own.

This DVD is no joke. It is definitely for the advanced dancer.  I have been dancing for over a decade now, but I am not a fast and furious dancer and I am more of an improviser than a master of choreography.  I enjoyed what might be called the beginner sections of this DVD, but once we got into the actual combinations, I was - the word might be - dumbfounded.  I would say, that's a compliment.  I was aware that this choreography would be for advanced dancers but it's rare for me to find a DVD (or go to workshop) where I can't easily follow along. It's really really fast!  I am still going to give it a positive review (five star) because the parts I _could_ do, I enjoyed, and I think it offers exactly what it promises. Honestly without having completed the entire thing, I usually hesitate to give star ratings, but I felt I would be offering valuable advice to say, from a third unbiased party, that this is a serious choreography.  It's definitely a challenge, and if you are looking for a challenge, check it out. After all, not many DVDs are aimed at the advanced dancer.",1391558400,7,1158,4.260273972602739
8621947,5,B00GBFPTVS,Gave it as a gift and the recipient was thrilled. She is a professional belly dancer and was so excited to receive this tape.,1389916800,,125,4.25
