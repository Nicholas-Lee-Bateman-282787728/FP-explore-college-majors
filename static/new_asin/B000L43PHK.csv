2699973,5,B000L43PHK,I am so happy that I do not have to wait years to rewatch my favorite program. Action and great characters,1172016000,4,106,4.095238095238095
2699974,5,B000L43PHK,always enjoyed the tv series when it was on.  Glad to be able to watch it again.,1169078400,5,80,3.7058823529411766
2699975,5,B000L43PHK,"Jag is the greatest TV show since MASH its intresting and funny. Everyone ive introduced it to has loved it. I got season one for my mom for christmas(we used to watcah it together when it was on air)but i ended up stealing them from her. The courtroom drama is captivating especialy for a YALE law student to be. Four days after christmas i was done with season one i immediatly got season two and wow i can see why it lasted ten years.the chemistry between david(so hot even though he's old enough to be my dad) and cathrine is amazing. I was not normally into millitary show and such (except for mash which i watched with my dad)but this show has got to be the best series ever shown on a tv screen. I love that the women are so strong yet beautiful cathrine's character is an inspiration to all young women trying to show they are just as good as the men.

Buy it you'll love it i promise",1168646400,8,892,4.216374269005848
2699976,5,B000L43PHK,I love This series please put seasons 4-10 quickly Catherine Bell is so so Fine David James Elliot is the Man. March 20 2007 can't wait,1165968000,8,135,4.230769230769231
2699977,5,B000L43PHK,"I'm glad they worked so quickly to get the 3rd season of JAG out in just a few months.  I have Seasons 1 and 2 and am enjoying them both thoroughly.  JAG was such a great TV show and it ended before it's time, in my opinion. Now at least we can enjoy them on DVD, if they don't take forever to put Seasons 4 through 10 out.  Harm and Mac had some of the best chemistry on TV, and there was a great supporting cast with characters that came to feel like family.  I looked forward to every new episode and was seldom, if ever, disappointed.  The writing, the characters, the action, the casting, the integrity of the show was beyond compare at times and I still miss it.  At least now the DVDs are coming out in pretty good time (after waiting 10 years to put Season 1 out).  Please don't make us wait too long for the rest of the seasons.  There are a lot of people out there anxiously waiting for all of them.",1165968000,20,909,4.067415730337078
2699978,5,B000L43PHK,"Love my Season 2 DVD!!!!! Catherine Bell, Patrick Laborteaux, and Karri Turner all did audio commentary and they were hysterical!!  I am sooo loving my Season 2 set that I can not wait for Season 3!!!! The camaderie b/w the characters is so sweet to watch-- their investigations and court cases are the best!!! Not to mention the chemistry b/w DJE and CB-- WOW!!!! It just gets better :) BUY SEASON 3!!! GO JAG!!!!!!!!!",1165708800,11,419,4.662162162162162
2699979,5,B000L43PHK,"I am glad that they decided to publish this set only 4 months after season 2 appeared. So I am hoping that I don't have to wait several years until I have the full 10 season collection.

Some things that I did not like so much in the season 2 box was, that there was no booklet included. I think, with a cult series like JAG, one could have put some effort into creating a nice booklet with maybe air-dates and some background information (as they did with ""The X-Files"").

Also I hope that maybe the next sets will include more specials like bloopers, interviews with the cast, etc.

Aside of that I have to say that those JAG sets are the most beautiful I have in my collection of TV-series. I like their art covers and the way the DVDs and its cases are decorated. Hope to see more of that soon...",1165449600,15,800,4.215686274509804

2700039,4,B000L43PHK,"I love this show and the only reason I have given this 4 stars is that the first episode of each disc is only able to be viewed with audio commentary from 2 of the cast members talking throughout the whole thing.  This includes while the show is running so you are unable to hear what is being said and not able to follow the story line completely.  Maybe there is a way to get around this but I have not been able to discover any as I am watching these on an external drive with my laptop with no access to television or standard DVD player.  It seems if you pay for episodes of a television show most people are doing so because they want to watch these shows, not miss out on 4 episodes because of audio commentary.",1436227200,,718,4.114285714285714

All episode plots aside, David James Elliott (Harm) and Catherine Bell (Mac) have fantastic chemistry and I rarely see comparable couples on television these days. The supporting actors, such as Patrick Labyorteaux (Bud) and John Jackson (the Admiral), continue to outshine their previous performances. The whole cast meshes so well that they seem like their own loving family, even in the midst of strife and turmoil. Needless to say, I will continue forward into Season 4 and beyond.

2700161,1,B000L43PHK,"We never watched this show when it was on TV but were told that it was exciting, true-to-life and family-friendly.  The first is true sometimes.  However, despite the military action, this particular season had some of the most boring episodes imagineable.

As far as true-to-life, I'm sure the producers knew they were taking plenty of artistic license as far as military authenticity.  I've been a Navy dependent my whole life - Dad was in the Navy and so was my now-retired Captain husband - but some of Harm's stunts are just embarrassing.  Seeing him flick a match at the chest of a guy who's just been arrested is so non-officer-like.  It's just ""jerk-like"".  He's more irritating and arrogant than charming.

With regards to family friendly, I'd have to point out to others who may consider buying this for kid viewing, two couples have premarital sex and while it's not the least bit explicit (you don't see anything), it's obvious what they do from the scenes before and after and it is presented as natural and welcome.  Please don't comment on this by calling me a prude.  This is an important issue to many families so I'm pointing it out.

On the whole, we've decided this is the last JAG season we'll watch.",1278720000,3,1221,4.712264150943396

Needless to say I LOVE Harm Rabb, he couldn't be any cuter. Season two brought Catherine Bell on the scene as Harm's Partner. I love the immediate chemistry between them and the looks Harm gives her...my heart swoons. The love is there for sure now but they cannot act on it.

The adventures are so varied and different in each show. Season two has more courtroom time it's investigations and drama.

Most of the time, it seems, the main characters are Harm and Mac (David James Elliott and Catherine Bell).  Their chemistry is amazing.  I love this series for actors and the storylines but also because alot of the storylines are derived from real life events.  The storylines are interesting and the show got better as it went along.

It's great that I have the episodes but it would've been nice to get more. Not a single minute of special features on the discs (by the way, the sticker on the front said 'with great special features!')...  Even some episode commentary would have been nice. That's really disappointing. Seasons 1 and 2 had a few good features. Season 4 has 4 minutes worth... I hope future released seasons offer more.",1189987200,,683,4.294573643410852
2700178,4,B000L43PHK,"Loved that season 3 came out so soon but was a little disappointed that they edited Trisha Yearwood's song from ""The Return of Jimmy Blackhorse"". Whenever I hear ""In the Navy"" all I can see is the male stripper with Harm's uniform. They edited that song also. What are they going to do with the series finale song ""100 years""? I mean, I hear that song and see Harm and Mac at McMurphy's. Otherwise, I really enjoyed watching JAG all over again.",1189296000,,444,4.426829268292683

2700180,5,B000L43PHK,"I plan to purchase each season as it becomes available.  I already had season 1 & 2 and thoroughly enjoyed having those so I knew I would want to continue my collection.  The optional choices where different actors, producers and directors have commentaries throughout different episodes is a nice feature which gives more insight on the making of the series and those involved with it.",1185494400,,386,4.923076923076923

2700182,1,B000L43PHK,"The program is great,however, even by having to return the first order due to it being incomplete, the replacement was also faulty. One of the discs had a unfixable scratch and one episode did not have an ending..........OH, well.....can't win them all. Wish things were again made in the US of A.  Maybe fewer errors.",1182729600,,318,4.781818181818182

2700188,5,B000L43PHK,"I rue the day when they cancelled this program from TV.  Although we practically know most episodes by heart, we now continue watching our most favorite show.  Regretfully, when the Admiral left, so did the knot that held them together.  Exentricity fit the Admiral, but it did not do well with the little General.  The CD's appear to be of good quality.",1178928000,,354,4.661290322580645
2700189,4,B000L43PHK,"first of all, let me state that i think JAG is a wonderful show with great actors/characters and stories. just love watching the show and always look forward to the next episode.

but............

releasing this season with ZERO extras is unfathomable! the initial 2 seasons of both JAG and NCIS have extras so why not this one? when i got done watching the final episode of the set i figured i would go look for the featurettes. well, they do not exist. it is certainly not a deal breaker but it is dissapointing.

so i gave season three 4 stars only because of the lack of extras. the show itself is 5-stars!",1178668800,,610,4.428571428571429
2700190,5,B000L43PHK,You are getting ready to ship an item on my recent order twice and there is nothing I can do to cancel it before it ships.  You did the same thing with NCIS 3 and I am pissed. Your system needs to be more user friendly.,1178668800,,219,3.760869565217391

2700196,5,B000L43PHK,"Season 3 and 4 are my absolute favourites. Soo, there is not very much to say, at that stage the story of both couples Harm/Mac, Harriet/Bud is very well made and the acting is great too. I especially appreciate the fine humor, that I often missed in later seasons. I hope very much we don't have to wait too long for season 4!",1177286400,,327,4.2063492063492065
2700197,5,B000L43PHK,"I am excited to get season 4 when it comes out. I am puzzled however, why all the season's are available in one giant package; yet only season's 1-3 have been released to buy individually. It is difficult to fork out $300 at one time just to get the entire bundle for most people that I know.",1176854400,3,292,4.140350877192983

A Navy pilot becoming a lawyer is a stretch and a Seal Admiral another, but otherwise this is a great, patriotic show on a lefty network.

2700201,5,B000L43PHK,"I am enjoying this season so much, even though I think I've watched some of these episodes so many times, I could probably recite some of the dialogue word for word. The DVD's give us the episodes without the commercial interuptions and its being told, in order, like a engrossing and wonderful book that you don't want to put down. We learn alot about Harm Sr. in this season, even though he was not really a main character, he was alot of the focus for Harm the whole 10 years of JAG. He meant alot of things to many Vietnam Vets I've spoken to about the show. Love this, cant wait til Season 4",1174435200,2,596,4.2368421052631575
2700202,2,B000L43PHK,"The only reason I gave this DVD set 2 stars, instead of the 5 that I would rate the show itself, is because there are absolutely NO extras on this DVD set.  No featurettes, no cast interviews, not even any episode commentaries.  While I appreciate the studios putting the season sets out in such a timely manner, I'd prefer they take a little longer and give us some fun extras to go along with the wonderful episodes.",1174435200,7,418,4.415584415584416
2700203,5,B000L43PHK,"Let's face it, most prime time TV programs in the late 20th and the early 21st century are geared to entertain.  There is nothing wrong to be entertained after a hard day of work except in what manner do we allow the TV executives/producers to manipulate us during our off hours?  The creator and the primary producer of JAG, Mr. Donald Bellisario had made a concerted effort to present both the human and the authentic sides of the life at JAG.  Now, I realized certain creative licenses were used to stimulate the dramatization of the show.  Nevertheless, the JAG series had tackled some of the serious and/or controversial subjects in the U.S. Navy and Marine Corp. recent history.  I salute Mr. Bellisario for his gallant effort to respect his audiences with dignity and truth, and to entertain America with a worthy patriotic program.
