2925413,4,B000UUX2JG,Tired of spending half an hour in downward facing dog or maybe looking to build up to one of those vids that spends half an hour in downward facing dog? This might be what you are looking for. Its yoga with a bit of bootcamp thrown in. Its start with a warm up of 10 minutes followed by fifteen minutes that focus on getting a burn in your legs. The next 10 minutes look to shred your shoulders and then 10 minutes of abs that starts weak but ends with a grimace. A nice little stretch finishes it up. The instructor seems just a bit too talkative and could have talked about a quarter less and still been completely informative. It was difficult getting into the rhythm at first but after a few times I just tuned her out. As a middle age guy who likes a variety of yoga from Bryan Kest to PM Yoga this is a yoga vid that is challenging but has really only a couple poses that I will never fully be able to do. I like doing this vid when I am not in the mood to do either Power Yoga or lift weights but the training schedule says I should be doing one or the other.,1232582400,,1066,4.009389671361502
2925414,5,B000UUX2JG,"Finally, a wonderfully produced, original, and challenging yoga practice for the intermediate/advanced student!  Alanna Zabel incorporates muscle toning and strengthening while delivering a flowing and comprehensive routine.

The routine can be done in its entirety or can be broken down into five 10-minute sessions (warm-up, upper body conditioning, lower body conditioning, core conditioning, and strength & flexibility).  She has also included an effective ""buns burner"" workout bonus feature.

The setting is pleasant, the music subtle and calming, and the cueing and instruction are professionally done and well-exectued.",1231718400,,627,6.172413793103448
2925415,4,B000UUX2JG,"I am new to yoga.  I have done pilates, tae bo, good old fashioned running swimming and biking.  But I am new to yoga.  I started with The Firm Power Yoga DVD and then added this one.  I am glad that I started with a more basic (but still challenging) DVD before trying this one.

The instructor in this DVD expects you to know a few things about yoga.  She does not give you a lot of instruction regarding how to get into poses and she does not walk you through them.  I had to do the DVD three times before I was able to actually flow through it.  Otherwise I was having to stop and watch what she was doing and then try to do it myself.  She speaks quietly and again, you have to watch to understand what is coming next.  She also doesn't give you very effective alternative poses for the beginner. Another reason I was glad to have done The Firm yoga first.  That DVD walks you through poses so that you start with the beginning pose and work into the advanced move.  As a consequence I already knew some modified poses for what this insturctor was having us do and I could move right into them when I needed to.

This DVD does some repetive motions while holding poses.  For example, tree pose while doing arm circles, warrior three while doing knee bends, tricept push ups while in a modified boat pose.  As a consequence your muscles and your balance are challenged not just in being able to move into and hold the pose .. but in the additional pushing that she makes you do while you are holding the pose.  The result is what she describes as a mixture of western and eastern philosophy .. and it creates a great burning sensation in all kinds of areas that you want to create that burning sensation in.

Once I did this DVD a few times and learned what was coming next I found it to be a wonderful work out.  There are some poses that I can't do yet (and some that I will never be able to do, this woman is VERY bendy!) but I am improving.  I like the soft music and I like the instructors quiet easy voice.  This DVD challenges me at every level:  balance, flexibility, strength and perseverence.

I reccomend this DVD if you have at least a little prior experience with Yoga.  I would have been lost without the little knowledge that I had.  Also, if you are newer to yoga, plan on doing the dvd through a few times.  Don't get intimidated by the difficulty of the poses, muscle memory will kick in and you will find that they become easier with repetition.  Also, I still do my arm circles with one arm over the TV in case I lose balance while in tree pose .. I can just set my arm down briefly to regain balance and continue on.  Don't be shy about doing a few modificiations if you are new like me.  I found that this dvd was challenging and a great work out.",1223251200,4,2773,4.200757575757576
2925416,5,B000UUX2JG,"Recently I've found myself in the midlands in Ireland, teaching yoga, with no other available classes around. So I treated myself to a whole batch of videos. I'm most impressed with this one. As other commentators have said, Ms Zabel is very personable, relaxed, in great form; the production values are high, the atmosphere is good, and the music isn't quite my taste but not too intrusive or New Agey annoying. For me, it's a great find, because she's doing just the sort of thing that I'm teaching, so it's given me some valuable inspiration. I agree with other reviewers that this might not be the best for absolute beginners (the Yoga for Dummies would qualify there); then again, it's less advanced than, say, Rodney Yee, and even beginners will pick up a lot. All in all, very nice job.",1215993600,,793,4.671428571428572
2925417,4,B000UUX2JG,"this yoga dvd is a pretty good workout for people who may have done yoga before.  I have done some classes prior to this, but this is a little more intense and I can tell I'm getting a good workout.",1211500800,,198,3.95
2925418,4,B000UUX2JG,"Menu Options:
Warm Up, Lower Body, Upper Body, Core Conditioning, Stretch & Flexibiity, Complete 50 min makeover, Special Extras (extra 10 min Buns burner, trailers).

Alanna Zable is alone in a room w/ white wall w/painted green swoosh & tree, large vases, towels in baskets & blocks to give you something to look at. The music is played at a very low volume, but it's nice, not too boring. Alanna speaks real time (no voice over) with only fitness/anatomical terms & the focus of this dvd is fitness w/flexibility. She gives good basic tutorial info, but to keep it going, she is limited in what she can say so this should not be a first yoga dvd for that reason. Alanna has a good personality & good body awareness from what I sense. This pace/work done is hard since it does all upper at once & all lower at once so your muscles will not get a break. This is best for those who have been working out regularly or some decent muscle strength.

Only listed SOME Poses in each section:
Warm-up: 10 min
sun salutations, etc.
Lower Body: 15 min
chair, twist chair, sun salutations, warrior 1, 2, 3, reverse warrior, side angle, standing split, tree (or leg straight out fwd),  (poses are held a long time
Upper Body: 11 min
some arm circles, plank, side plank, 1 armed down dog, crow, shoulder stretch, etc.
Core Conditioning: 9 min
table w/knee to nose, camel, crunches, bridge, 1 legged bridge, wheel
boat, pilates bicycle,
Stretch & Flexibility: 7 min
plow, shoulder stand, reclined straight leg to face stretch, reclined spinal twist knees to side, reclined knees to chest

Here's the breakdown of the Buns to give you an idea of how Alanna does poses/moves & then moves on:

Extra:  Burns Burner 10 min:
chair on toes, 1 legged chair, standing fwd bend, plank, cobra, down dog, down dog w/lifting straight leg up/down & pulsing straight leg, warrior 1, warrior 2, wide legged fwd bend, wide legged fwd bend w1 lifted straight leg, standing frog (wide legged squats & one foot on toes only), squat w/stretching shoulder, lunge, plank, cobra, down dog, table (hands/knees) w/lifted straight leg & pulsing leg, child's, pigeon",1205971200,22,2127,4.7196765498652296
2925419,5,B000UUX2JG,"This DVD is great.  Alanna is very professional, nice to watch without being annoying, and has wonderful form and strength.  She's also as flexible and limber as a piece of cooked spaghetti!

The studio is visually appealing, with stacked yoga blocks, a tree, yoga mats, some plants, etc.  I was calmed just looking at it.  The production quality is good.  There are five 10 minute routines.

However, this is NOT for uncoordinated people or beginners to the exercise/yoga lifestyle.  There is one part in particular that had my jaw dropping open.  In the warrior pose (warrior 2, I think?) where you are standing on one leg and have the other behind you in the air lifted (in arabesque position for you ballet dancers) with your arms out, she bends her leg and straightens it repeatedly.  I for one cannot do this.  It takes a LOT of leg strength and very disciplined coordination, which I don't have yet.  Also, there are several exercises that are very twisty, pretzel like.  It moves at a flowing, quick pace with not much time to relax between transistions.  This DVD is wonderful, but not for me.  Hopefully I can work my way up to it!  For those of you seasoned in yoga that are pretty flexible, I think you will really like it!",1201219200,12,1235,4.5963302752293576
2925420,5,B000UUX2JG,I'm a beginner for yoga.  This DVD is great!  It keeps you going...and going.  I would recommend yoga to people who just can't seam to get themselves to the gym.,1195171200,4,161,4.3
2925421,5,B000UUX2JG,"This is a find! Anyone with any interest in yoga will love this program - it targets the whole body and is a beautiful, clean, flowing, super effective workout. Get this DVD - you won't be disapointed!",1193529600,10,201,4.45945945945946
2925422,4,B000UUX2JG,"Great Yoga video. It is a good leg and arm workout and has a relaxing stretch at the end. The only thing I might change would to have a little more core strengthing, but what is on there is pretty good, I just want more.",1302048000,,220,3.911111111111111
2925423,3,B000UUX2JG,"I love yoga.  I have taken classes over the years (mostly vinyasa and the other more active ones). This video is good in that all the moves are there.  But she talks alot.  Too much for me.
Otherwise, it gives you what you need to get your yoga fix.",1300579200,,249,4.040816326530612
2925424,4,B000UUX2JG,"I liked this dvd. Alanna is very soothing and gives great instructions for proper alignment, poses and modifications.

I definitely felt a good burn using this dvd. I will advise that she does turn some of the yoga poses into aerobic, repetitious movement for cardio purposes so if you are looking for an extremely traditional yoga dvd, then you probably won't like this. Also, the dvd is split into 5 sections. A warm up, lower body, upper body, core, and stretch. You can do them separately or as a whole for a 50 minute workout. The 50 minute workout, however, is just the 5 separate workouts strung together end-to-end, so it kind of disrupts the flow.

However, she is in fantastic shape and you can tell that she really knows whats she is doing when it comes to yoga and physical fitness. Overall, this was a great workout and I definitely felt energized/relaxed after.",1272931200,2,875,4.675324675324675
2925425,5,B000UUX2JG,Awesome! Hard workout but I really feel results! I highly recommend it. You can also split it up into three 30 minute work outs for shorter exercises.,1270944000,,150,4.592592592592593
2925426,5,B000UUX2JG,"I shy away from Yoga that wants me to look for inner strength, yada, yada.  I am a born-again Christian seeking the physical benefits of yoga stretching without receiving the eastern culture's religion & influence intermixed.  I really found this refreshing and thoroughly enjoyed the challenging physical poses.  Her voice is soothing but she doesn't tell everyone how to ""open their heart,"" etc.  Jesus is in my heart and I don't need to open it for anything else.",1269907200,4,466,4.935897435897436
2925427,4,B000UUX2JG,"The yoga series in this dvd is similar to the type of yoga series that I have most often experienced at a gym class as opposed to a class at yoga studio. I consider myself a pretty average person, in terms of physical ability and to me this dvd provides a well-balanced workout that isn't too strenuous. If you are looking for something that incorporates the intellectual and spiritual aspects of yoga, this dvd is NOT for you. Luckily, I enjoy both approaches, so I still feel like I got my money's worth. I do think that if you are only going to buy one yoga dvd or if this is your first exposure to yoga, it would be better to get something with a more well rounded approach. Otherwise, if you are looking for a yoga series with a little physical challenge this might be just the thing for you. However, keep in mind that if you are very experienced with yoga or in REALLY good shape, this series would likely not be challenging enough.",1269475200,,939,4.340909090909091
2925428,5,B000UUX2JG,"I can't stand all the yoga videos that are supposed to be all calming.  This one is totally different, no beaches or oceans here!  The instructer is great and it is easy to follow.  There are several different workouts on here to help you tone all over.  I recommend this to anyone who does not want a hippie dippie type of yoga!",1245974400,,329,4.258064516129032

2925430,4,B000UUX2JG,"I've been working my way up to some more challenging yoga, so I decided to give this dvd a try.  Well, let me say it's got challenging covered!  Alana is very good a bringing you through each pose but you'll see right away that you are going to have to practice often to have good form with some of the more difficult poses.  My husband did this with me and was very frustrated at the difficulty of the poses and how easy Alana made it look.  I would not recommend this for beginners, but if you've been at it for a while and enjoy a challenge I say go for it!",1239840000,,560,4.018018018018018
2925431,5,B000UUX2JG,"I purchased this DVD based on the reviews.  There were so many Yoga DVD's to choose from so I relied heavily on feedback.

This DVD is awesome!  I've been doing Yoga for about 5 months now.  This DVD is a bit hard in places, but who doesn't love a challenge!  I like that I can choose to do specific area in the 10 minute increments or choose the full 50 minute workout.  Nice options to have especially when you have kids that want to Downward Dog with you and end up crawling under/over you!!!

Definitely would recommend.  I love feeling like I have had a work out and this DVD does just that.",1234915200,,596,4.212389380530974

8214966,5,B000UUX2JG,"I am not a yoga expert, but have a little experience and haven't done it in a while.  I needed to listen to a sun salutation to get going in the morning and did not want to learn each pose  as a beginner, I just needed the audio.  This video does the 12 poses plus another few stretches I need personally and moves smoothly without me needing to look at the video. The perfect audio I was looking for in my morning routine.  I should have waited to go through the whole dvd before my review but I was too excited to post my happiness to find just what  I needed.",1424908800,,562,4.027027027027027

I like how it is divided into various segments so you can devote as much or as little time as you want. You can also concentrate on whichever areas you want:  lower body, upper body, or core. There is also a segment for warm-up and a stretching one for the end of your practice or for any time. One segment, a longer one, combines all the segments for a 50 minute session.",1360108800,,460,4.111111111111111
