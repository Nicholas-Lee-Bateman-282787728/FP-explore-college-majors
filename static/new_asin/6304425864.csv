870491,5,6304425864,"This movie captivated me when I saw it on cable. It portrays life in a manner that is shockingly similar to reality.  Tromeo is a sick, twisted, hormone-driven high school age male, and the object of his affection is an  attractive but  neurotic high school age female who is more perverted than  she wants everyone to know. Guys?  Does this remind you of your teenage  years? Ladies?  Can you see any of Juliette in yourselves? I know that its  just a movie, and it certainly goes against every single moral I have ever  been taught; but it's just so damn funny I  can't resist raving about  it.
This film contains mediocre acting, sick sexual  scenario's, the most  deviant teenage behavior imaginable, pathetically disfunctional parenting  and an equally disturbing philosophy of life that says once you finally do  find your one true love, there will be something majorly wrong with them  (in this case, blood brother and sister).

870492,5,6304425864,"""Lets Make Some Art"" Is aparently Lloyd Kaufman's mantra these days.  Well against all odds he succeeded, in ways I don't even think he intended to.
Tromeo takes Shakespeare's play and warps it through a  surealist lens into something amazingly Post-Modern.  While other sources  are content to be merely reverential to the material and not question one  thing about it, Tromeo constantly questions the source and asks it to  defend itself, all the while paying respectful homage to it.  Its a tough  line to walk and those who prefer their adaptions to drip with slavish  devotion will not appreciate this.
Tromeo is sureal art in the best sense  of the term.  It offends, questions and attacks the norms and the  conventions of polite society, all the while taking the icons of that  society and using them to it's own advantage.
When Juliet is asked by the  ghosts of the dead if her Love was worth their lives she has no answer, and  when the cost of the distruction of these lives is taken from those  directly responsible for it, rather than the innocent, it seems wrongly  motivated, but these things are as they should be.
Rather than accepting  Shakespeare's Oh woe is me woe is me whatever shall the middle class do  ending of Romeo, Tromeo and Juliet refuses to accept the status quo, and  allows for the real possibility of change, making it a much more  responsible, and artistic achievement than the other film based upon the  same source material around that same time.",942796800,4,1484,4.737254901960784

Whereas the other Troma movies made me smile and chuckle, this one makes me laugh uncontrollably -- even just thinking about the movie!

Lloyd Kaufman's film certainly stands out as one of the most original, modern versions of the bard's creation, It may be placed in a modern-day decaying New York and full of the modern-day anti-social behavior, body piercing, dismemberment and kinky sex (which, for the more than casual reader, Shakespeare himself wasn't shying away from), but at the same time it stays incredibly close to the overall feel and point of what the play is all about, which is quite an effort. Kaufman wrote the script with his co-director on the film James Gunn, who is now famous for writing two successful Scooby Doo movies, doing the impossible by making a perfect remake of an already perfect film with his script for Dawn of the Dead and directing one of the best horror-films of the year: Slither.

Not only for the script by James Gunn, now a good influence on Hollywood while working from the inside, but also because it features an early part of legendary actress Debbie Rochon. Well known by everyone familiar with films that are made on lower budgets. The 10th anniversary edition on DVD adds to all that by including so many as-yet undiscovered gems that not only all the information one could wish for about the film itself  and the experience of making it is presented in ways that make it impossible to turn off the DVD, but also a very honest (and disturbing) look is given into the ways independent cinema has to surviver these days. In many ways the extra's on the disc are an invaluable addition to the already impressive amount given on Kaufman's film-school ""Make Your Own Damn Movie"". Furtermore historical items from the Troma vaults which include James Gunn, Debbie Rochon and other contributors to this masterpiece are included, and the film itself is, apart from looking better then ever, accompanied by no less than four audio-commentaries, each and everyone informative, excruciatingly funny and all done for serious addition to the film instead of the boring and nonsensical commentaries that are so common these days. There are new

commentaries (one with Kaufman and Gunn together), but also the one James Gunn did for the original release of the DVD but couldn't be included there for some of honesty he displays about some other people is present on this disc. With fan-recreations of a few of the scenes from the film, a video diary of Lloyd Kaufman's visit to the set of James Gunn's Slither and a visit the two brought together to Eli Roth's Hostel Birthday party and much more, this is the ultimate set everyone must own. Weather you are a film historian, someone interested in interpretations of the great Bard's work, a fan of great cinema, a fighter for independent cinema, a fan of James Gunn, interested in learning more on making films on a low budget, a fan of Lloyd Kaufman or whatever: this is the most important DVD-release of this millennium!",1158019200,20,3786,4.949685534591195

By far the most erotic scenes for me were those where Juliet is making love with the piercing and tattoo laden Ness, played by the divine Canadian-born Debbie Rochon. Debbie's Oscar-worthy orgasm sets an impossibly high standard for the rest of the movie, but it is still a first class piece of Pulp entertainment.

The other reviews have nailed it pretty well. Sex and violence, violence and sex. Yet even though the violence is of a Monty Python caricature nature, it pales compared to a lot of realistically portrayed violence as it appears in countless 'mainstream' movies.

It's basically a soft pornography movie with Alternate Reality classical pretensions, and goes infinitely beyond the excellent Di Caprio/Danes version of Romeo and Juliet in that regard.

871107,3,6304425864,"Tromeo and Juliet is a good movie. I'll say that much. It's very funny and much more clever than it presents itself to be. The funniest parts of the movie were the ones that were actually subtle plays on Shakespeare's play. For example, Juliet's fiance is named London in this movie, when his name was actually Paris. In fact, all of the names: Monty Que instead of Montague, Benny instead of Benvolio, Tyrone instead of Tybalt, and especially Ness instead of Nurse, were all very witty modernizations. An even more subtle play is when the characters start speaking in rhyme during the more dramatic moments, which was a device that Shakespeare actually used in his writing. What makes it so funny is the intelligence that lies beneath the goofy violence and explicit sex.

That said, the movie does kind of go downhill after Murray dies. Then, it just gets kind of stupid. After that point, the movie deviates more and more from the actual play, and it turns into a weird *rgy of cartoonish violence. It's almost as if the filmmakers wanted to escalate the humor as the actual story gets more tragic, but when the wonderful combination of smart humor and blood and guts is replaced by just the blood and guts, it's not quite the same. The ending could have better, too.

I liked the movie, but because the comedy towards the end felt kind of awkward, I found myself missing the Baz Luhrmann version. It's still very entertaining, though, if you don't expect too much.",1108339200,2,1468,4.686046511627907
871108,5,6304425864,"...and a Troma retelling of a classic Shakespearean tale is still as beautiful.

I think it should be noted that although I have a degree in the English language, I'm not a fan of Shakespeare.  I'm particularly not a fan of Romeo and Juliet.  No matter how many different versions I see, I'm still not convinced that these kids, who met briefly at a party, are hopelessly in love.  And I'm most certainly not convinced that a story about two teenagers who kill themselves because they can't be together should be held aloft as a great love story.  Which brings me to why Tromeo and Juliet is my all time favorite adaptation.

It should also be noted that although I have a degree in the English language, I AM a fan of Troma movies.  If you're NOT, I can't recommend this title AT ALL, since it's one of the Tromiest of Troma I've ever seen.  But my love of Troma, particularly Lloyd Kaufmann, probably plays a part in why I like this film so much.

First of all, it's narrated by Lemmy from Motorhead.  How cool is that?  Secondly, instead of Juliet having a ""nurse,"" she has a lesbian lover, and one played by Debbie Rochon, at that!  In a modern retelling of Romeo and Juliet, I thought this was much more ""modern"" than having the nurse be a housekeeper, like she was in the one with Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio.  There is also plenty of sex and violence, which director Lloyd Kaufmann describes as, ""all the things Shakespeare wanted but never had.""  And while that's an amusing Tromaism, it's probably not far from the truth.  With all the fighting between Capulet and Montague, and all the midnight rendezvous between Juliet and Romeo, this movie is probably filling in a lot of the gaps originally left to the imagination.  Especially that ""nurse.""  Why do you think she spent so much time hanging around Juliet, anyway?

Not all, but some of the original Shakespearean dialog is used here.  However, it usually comes out in hilarious corruptions of the original text.  The famous line, ""how her hand rests upon her cheek...Oh, to be a glove upon that hand,"" is not spoken when Juliet thoughtfully cups her hand against her face, but rather when her arms are tied behind her back, and her hand rests upon her derierre.

The real reason why this movie does it for me is because I really believe Tromeo and Juliet are in love.  By elaborating on the original script, James Gunn is able to create a convincing relationship between the two lovers, and establish why ""the other guy,"" the one Juliet's parents want her to marry, is all wrong for her, and is only interested in her for superficial reasons.  He owns a meat company, and we are treated to a disgusting and hilarious satire of the meat industry.  Juliet reveals she is a vegan.

My absolute favorite part of the movie is when Juliet goes to get a spell to free her from having to marry the creepy, slimy meat merchant.  Instead of a potion to make her appear dead, she is given a potion to make her appear hideously ugly.  When Meat-head sees her, his ""love"" for her vanishes as abruptly as it appeared.  Tromeo, however, loves her more deeply, and accepts her, with or without her beautiful face and body.

Of all the Troma movies I've seen, this has to be the best, with the possible exception of, ""Citizen Toxie.""  Still, somehow, ""Tromeo and Juliet"" does it for me a little bit more.  If you like Troma, this is a must see.  Some people are just lukewarm on Troma, because some of their movies can be a bit uneven at times.  If you're one of those people, I would recommend this, because it's got all the things that make Troma great, and it holds your interest the whole way through.",1106352000,4,3659,4.52054794520548
871109,4,6304425864,"First off, I love Troma movies. Everyone should. But the trouble with most Troma films, is that they get slow and boring in parts and are never honestly entertaining as a whole. This is true.

But like a few other Troma films, such as The Toxic Avenger, Citizen Toxie, and Terror Firmer, this movie, while lacking in any real quality film making, keeps you entertained through out the entire thing.

It's very creative twist on the tale of Romeo and Juliet, that only Troma could possibly pull off. It's got comedic gore, sleaze and a black man with gas. What more could one want in a film?",1102636800,,590,4.5046728971962615

871111,5,6304425864,"I've always had this fantasy that some thoroughly disreputable quick-buck movie would end up being brilliant. Like, what if some soft-core ""Erotic Thriller"" ended up having gutsy, breakthrough performances and a riveting plot? What if ""Police Academy 12"" was Oscar-worthy?
My fantasies came through with ""Tromeo & Juliet."" The very concept of a punk ""Romeo"" is brilliant - they conceived this before Baz Luhrmann's movie - but seeing as how this is Troma we're talking about, Lloyd Kaufman could have steered this in a very wrong (read: conventional) direction. Fortunately, they managed to find a young mad genius named James Gunn to write the script, and they found some hungry young acting talent who threw themselves into the project. And Kaufman, perhaps inspired by all this, finally directed like a man more concerned with making a good movie than cashing in on the quick-buck exploitation trends that nearly ruined ""Troma's War"" and ""Sgt. Kabukiman.""
Not that ""Tromeo & Juliet"" isn't a quick-buck exploitation movie. It is. It's also a hilarious and inventive comedy, an art film, a soft-core porno, a gross-out gore flick, a surprisingly moving love story, and - best of all - one of the most oddly faithful Shakespeare adaptations I've ever seen. Amazingly, it's all these things all at the same time, sometimes even in the same scene (check out Murray Que's final scene, in the tattoo parlor). ""Tromeo"" captures the spirit, the wordplay, and the abandon that so many staid Shakespeare movies completely miss. And it's one of the most energetic and creative movies you're likely to see.
I could gush on and on about ""Tromeo,"" for it is my favorite movie. Now that James Gunn is a big-time - although still delightfully weird - Hollywood writer, I wouldn't be surprised to see a surge in ""Tromeo"" sales. This is a good thing. ""Tromeo"" is a completely unique and exhilirating movie, and it deserves a huge audience. It's not for everyone, I suppose (the close-up shot of the nipple being pierced will pretty much clear the room of those who should have stayed away in the first place). But if you like a little trash in your art, or art in your trash, give ""Tromeo"" a chance.
Oh - and the budget for ""Tromeo"" was $350,000, or about what it costs to cater lunch for a week on your basic Adam Sandler movie.",1080518400,26,2313,4.828715365239295

As a Christian, I am disturbed someone would produce such an item, and then distribute it.  It is truly vile, and it appeals to the basest human ideas of sexual gratification, not to mention that it is completely lewd.  However, my opinion is tempered by the fact that it (refreshingly) lacks a P.C. agenda, and like I said, it is funny.  The acting was average, and not much worse than what passes for ""big-budget"" talent these days.

871190,5,6304425864,"First thing you need to do before you read the rest of this review is read the title of the movie again...TROMEO and Juliet...it is a Troma film. Ok...now that we have that out of the way we can move on with the review.
This film is no Gone With the Wind, but then I say to you that Gone With the Wind is no Tromeo and Juliet either. Troma is not defined by your typical Hollywood rules where movies are concerned. Troma sits off in the dark corner of the big room where all the class clowns hang out and are just in their own world. Tromeo and Juliet does what Troma does best and does it better than ever before. I never really believed that I would enjoy something more than the Toxic Avenger coming out of Tromaville. This movie quickly took over the position as my favorite Troma film. The characters are over the top and fun. The script is funny and Tromeo's black fartin' dad is hilarious. A great cast of characters with an intelligent(as in Troma intelligent) script.
I personally thought the cook for the Capulets was far more sexy than Juliet, but what do I know. I will say one thing about some of the off color content...be warned if you are easily offended. There is plenty by which to be offended in this film. For instance, a freakshow who desires his sister in every way, a father who is freakishly attracted to his daughter, as well as plenty of other off color scenes. Did you expect anything less from Troma though.
Watch for the tons and tons of memorabilia from the other Troma films throughout this film as well as the party where you see a cast of characters from the other films to include Toxie himself.
I have to say that when the characters break into their ""Shakespearean"" dialog, it just makes me giggle. Very funny if you ask me.
Overall this is a pretty solid Troma film with a nice story done in vintage Troma style.",1009843200,37,1849,4.36231884057971
871191,5,6304425864,"Tromeo and Juliet was one of the latest Troma films by Lloyd Kaufman untill Terror Firmer which is one of the sickest Troma films but before Terror Fimer this was the sickest. The movie is a Troma remake about Romeo and Juliet if you haven't figured that out yet and has very little to do with the original. What surprised me about this Troma film is that it didn't pile on the gore like most Troma films but don't get me wrong it still had some gore, and it even had serious moments and good acting. The story is about Tromeo and Juliet two lovers from two different families who hate and even kill each other. When Tromeo and Juliet marry chas soon happens between both families. There are a lot of classic scenes some are when Juliets fathers head blows off after a microwave is slamed on his head and when you meet the famous penis monster.

As is the troma tradition, the acting isn't very convincing (although I loved Capulet, Murray, & Sammy)and the script is obviously lame at times (sometimes frequently) but the main goal is just to have a low-taste bash while watching.  THere's graphic sex and violence, as Shakespeare intended, but perhaps not to these extents.  The violence isn't say, convince on the level of saving private ryan, but that makes it all the more fun.

The Bards Greatest Romance gets the Troma Treatment in the Grandest Scale. Lesbianism, Language, Gore... Everything is overdone Beautifully.
Its Storyline (and it's similarity's to the Real Romeo and Juliet) is pretty Inconsequential, but, as you've probably guessed, it's about Forbidden love between two teens whose Family's are Rivals. The makers cleverly (well, cleverly compared to a lot of their previous work) twist the more famous elements and make them more Modern, more Sick and more Funny.
The Acting is Oscar worthy, (keeping in mind I'm only comparing this to Other Troma films) Jane Jensen and Will Keenan seem to have a Genuine Attraction, which threatens to make the film... Realistic, a Realistic Troma film, Times really are Changing. The Rest of the performances bring the film back to the Troma Level we all know and love.

I think this movie is excellent.  I give it only four stars because some scenes don't work (like some of the stupid jokes about the crossbow) and there's some pretty twisted stuff in there that gets to me.

I can  admit I am wrong. I was wrong about this film. It is not the greatest most  inspiring piece ever, that I know, however I have reevulated my sense of  enjoyment. Not everything has to have hidden agendas, an abudence of  symbolism to be entertaining.
I also see that this film is quite symbolic  in some ways, and I am not sure if it is intentional. It questions the  ordinary, it asks Are we really better off now than Shakespeare was?'. Has  all our advancement, development, has it taught us how to love, to  appericate important things, or have we come to value insignificant things  like porn, body art and sex over the real themes of 'Romeo and Juliet'?  It  comments on a society which has Shakespearian titled porn, explicit nipple  piercing and a father, who in all honesty, has some serious pyschological  problems.

Just when I think Troma can't break new ground & get racier, sexier, grosser, and overall more disturbing, I see Tromeo & Juliet!
I have always been a huge fan of their older films like The Toxic  Avenger & Class Of Nuke Em High, but this one takes the cake!
Where I  thought The Toxic Avengers 1 & 2 were gross, and violent, Tromeo &  Juliet triples that!
Where I thought Troma's past movies hit a nerve and  addressed social issues disturbingly, Tromeo & Juliet came along and  just shocked me.
Virtually everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, every  public taboo is addressed in this film.  It is amazing.
I have a new  Troma favorite and it is Tromeo & Juliet.
The basic story is  Shakespeare's only demented the Troma way.  Like the ads state, Kinky sex,  body piercings, etc.  They are all included here.  What they don't mention  are all the socially 'wrong' taboos they have included in here.

When I first saw this movie I was terrorizing some  bungalow park with a bunch of friends. It was 2 Am and we sorta were getting sleepy when we zapped onto some weird movie channel and saw...
Lemmy! Motorheads  frontman, introducing some sick movie, within a few minutes first blood was  drawn and we didn't move until the flick was over.
This Troma edition  brilliantly mixes the old shakespeare tale with modern day new york, mixing  old shakespearian poetry with more contemporary dialog. the line ""What  light from yonder plexiglass breaks?"" remains one of my favourites.
The movie can best be described as an erotic splatstick, a lot of  nudity, a lot of blood and even more fun (sex + violence = cool!). I  especially love the smash into the fire hydrant and the tattoo needle  meeting someones eyeball.
This DvD has some brilliant extras on top of  that. The troma tour is standard issue on all Troma DVD's but the feature  length commentary with fellow sick mind Lloyd Kaufmann gives a totally new  insight into this movie and the making of it.

Their movies are made on half of a shoestring budget, their jokes are crude and profane, every picture in the Tromaville universe is filled to overflowing with gratuitous nudity and excessive gore...in other words, perfect.  Most people who appreciate the sub-B genre are familiar with Troma features such as the ""Toxic Avenger"" and ""Class of Nuke 'Em High"" series, and of course the classic ""Surf Nazis Must Die"".  For fans of those titles, ""Tromeo & Juliet"" should be a must-see.

Kaufman and company's take on Shakespeare's classic tale of star-crossed lovers contains all the things you'd expect from a Troma production, but so much more as well.  Actors who can actually act, for one: Will Keenan is great as Tromeo, while Valentine Miele (Murray Martini) and William Beckwith (Cappy Capulet) (over)play their roles with aplomb.  The stunning Jane Jensen, whom you may have heard before if not heard *of* (her music has been featured in several soundtracks, including this one), also does well.  Amazingly, even while adapting it flawlessly to their style of filmmaking, Troma have managed to stay true to (most of) the original work.  Some dialogues from Romeo & Juliet are incorporated into this script verbatim, with others having received a more contemporary update (""Parting is such sweet sorrow.""  ""Totally sucks."").  Finally, for those who are still bummed about the tragic end to the classic English play, you'll get a decidedly happier ending here...with a twist!

If you're not already familiar with Troma productions, then do not watch this (or any Troma) movie if you get offended by ~anything~ in a comedy.  Otherwise, cry havoc and press the play button right now!
