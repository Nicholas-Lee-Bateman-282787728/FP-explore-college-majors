8484108,3,B0032YV99C,"The material is good, but the teacher seems very lazy and doesn't always show the steps full out, making it hard to see the style. The students are lovely, but not very well rehearsed for a demonstration DVD. They seem unsure of the timing of many of the exercises at the barre because the teacher does not demonstrate clearly enough.

The introductions given for the exercises at the barre are all exactly the same as well. There should be a stylized introduction that correlates to each country's particular type of dance, not a standard or general introduction to fit everything. That makes me suspicious of the authenticity of each style the teacher is presenting. Spanish intro should not be the same as Georgian.",1348185600,,718,4.837398373983739
8484109,5,B0032YV99C,"Recommended for those who want a glimpse of character dance class. Yuliya explains carefully each movement and style and then her pupils show series. Both barre and center series are demonstrated.
I was very pleased with this dvd. The demonstrations and shown series could have been placed under separate parts of dvd.",1309824000,,318,5.134615384615385
