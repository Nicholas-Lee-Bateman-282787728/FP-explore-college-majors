5045919,1,B0070275KE,This is the most amateurly done and disconnected video I've seen on this topic.  Absolutely despicable that they include clips from such wise and honored men like Archbishop Tutu and HH The Dalai Lama.  Their words were the only ones that made sense in this entire video.  Ridiculous waste of time.,1328659200,3,298,4.803921568627451
5045920,1,B0070275KE,"Poorly edited, poorly done.  This just gave me a headache.  It could have been an interesting piece about the Mayan culture and beliefs but the director went for something more esoteric maybe?  Whatever the aim, I believe it failed miserably.  Save your $2.00 and buy an ice cream cone...a lot more entertaining and tastes so much better.",1351900800,,338,4.87719298245614
5045921,3,B0070275KE,"Rigoberto Menchu Tum and the Mayan elders were excellent resources for the belief systems of today's Maya religion and world view.  This is the first time I have seen the present day Maya discussing their religion.  Very interesting and adds a lot to the subject.

However, the geologist/astronomers (with no credentials listed) had little new information to add unless you have never researched MesoAmerican life.

  The music, segues and the silly 1-800 ad are annoying and a waste of the time of anyone who watches and it reduced the video's value.  If it could be edited this could be an excellent video.",1351296000,,608,4.901960784313726
5045922,4,B0070275KE,"Other reviewers have made very good points about the excellent content, the troublesome video production,
and the relief at finally understanding this message of the Mayan Calendar 2012.
I can only add that as flawed as the production may be, the wisdom that comes through is amazing and wonderful.
I finally feel as though I have a sense of what is happening that I can live with, and a way of interacting with the messages
regarding the end times without fear.",1348531200,2,462,4.716049382716049
5045923,5,B0070275KE,"Very interesting with a more point of view on the whole subject.  I loved it.  If you are interested in Mayan prophesies,  this video is a must see.  Extremely informative and entertaining",1346803200,,188,4.78125
5045924,5,B0070275KE,I have seen plenty of Mayan Prophecy documentaries and this one is probably the best one I have seen.  It is very well thought out and the evidence is more convincing.  It isn't just a conspiracy theory video and you can tell the people who made this took the time to do their research and interviewed people who actually know what they are talking about.  Very well made and it is a must see for everyone who is truly interested in what the Mayan Prophecy is really about.  I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes documentary films.,1346803200,2,539,4.469387755102041
5045925,5,B0070275KE,"I first saw this film on Colorado Public Television last Spring.  I ordered a copy then and have since shown it half a dozen times to friends and family.  This film is a beacon of light and hope (and truth) amidst so much misinformation surrounding the whole 2012 hysteria.  The deeper value in this film is that it provides a grounded view into the pragmatic actions mankind must make to help us transition into a new paradigm of living in harmony with our planet.  Do yourself, your family, and your community a favor and show this film to everyone you love and care about.",1346803200,2,575,4.5
5045926,5,B0070275KE,"Great doc with a lot of interesting footage and insight.  It's nice that, in a time when people are capitalizing on the 2012 superstitious scare, there's a coherent and informative film that actually addresses Mayan people and relevant issues.  I love the conspiracy montage!  Really funny with some great characters.  Impressive that this doc also addresses the origins of the myth, which is always left out.  There's hardly any speculation here.  Just focusing on the culture and Mayan interpretation of the calendar and origins.  This is easily the best 2012/Mayan doc I've seen yet.  Way better than anything on the History channel (which is pure paranoid propaganda).  As if the world needs more fear!  Ridiculous.  Well done documentary!  Totally enjoyed it!  Thank you.",1333238400,2,776,5.211382113821138
5045927,1,B0070275KE,"We felt this film was very poorly done and not informative at all. Very little fact or data was presented. Also the sources, for the most part had very little, if any background information to add validity to their beliefs. The music and segways were out of place and choppy. Shame on you Amazon for charging us 3$ ...",1332720000,2,318,4.406779661016949
5045928,3,B0070275KE,"I did find the movie inspiring, and feel that it has a good message.  However, I had hoped that it would delve into Mayan history more - who the Mayans were, and what we know of their predictions, and learn more about the calendar in greater detail.  Instead, it focused more on contemporary Mayans, and how they have continue to uphold the belief systems.  I think their message was profound and thought provoking, but just be prepared this is not so much based on history or archeology, but rather on spiritual truth.

I enjoyed hearing about how the Mayans viewed time & their calendar system, but would have liked to have learned more.  And would have like to learn where it came from that the Mayans predicted the end of the world - where did that originate?",1332028800,5,763,4.54014598540146
5045929,5,B0070275KE,"There is plenty of mis-information out there on the 2012 sensational issue. PeaceJam have worked with the Mayans on many other projects previously and have gained their trust to help them tell the real story of 2012. This bridges the style of true cinema-verite documentaries in some sections and keeps it moving with other sections that you will love if you are a Michael Moore fan. You will come away with a much more balanced view of our futures, and a bit of inspiration to 'do better.'",1331251200,2,490,4.64367816091954
5045930,5,B0070275KE,"With all the doomsday stories relating to 2012 looming around us, this film was refreshingly positive. It reminds us of what is important and what isn't. Hearing it from the Mayan Elders of their interpretation of 2012 was reassuring. If you thought Hollywood 2012 was BS, you would like this movie. :)",1331164800,3,302,4.826923076923077
5045931,5,B0070275KE,This film must be seen to understand what is happening to our world. I advise everyone to watch this and take apropriate action,1331164800,4,127,4.565217391304348
5045932,5,B0070275KE,"I attended the Denver screening of this movie, and was impressed. It is refreshing to see local talent approach a global issue, and create an informative and fun film. The world did not end, and now I know why! Thanks.
Additional Kudos to PeaceJam for their incredible vision and work worldwide.",1331078400,4,295,4.803921568627451
5045933,5,B0070275KE,"This documentary is for anyone curious about the 2012 Mayan prophecy, from those who know it best...The Mayan elders of today!  Beautifully done, this film is a 'definite' among interested and intelligent folks.",1329868800,4,211,5.393939393939394
5045934,5,B0070275KE,"I have to say - watching this with the traveling service group I was a part of last year so that we could learn a little about the hype AND see what some important folks (HH and Tutu, to be exact) had to say about it. My heart hurts for the Mayan elders who are stuck attempting to clean up the mess that Hollywood created, but this film is a great (and funny) start! :)",1329782400,5,370,3.9466666666666668
5045935,5,B0070275KE,"This is a very well put together documentary on how the Mayan elders who are alive today view what is to happen in 2012 and beyond. Rather than hearsay, you get to hear the actual Mayan point of view from the source - the Mayan elders of today. There's a lot of nonsense out there regarding 2012 but this documentary finally provides the straight story of who we really are and where humanity and planet Earth may be headed in the future. No doomsday predictions and no promises of a bright future either because it all hangs in the balance right now with what we, as a species, collectively do about the situation in which we find ourselves. I see this film is part of a movement to help manifest a more peaceful, more responsible world. Highly recommended for viewing or better yet - for your library.",1329350400,6,803,4.469387755102041
5045936,5,B0070275KE,"This movie was a great insight into what the Mayan's really believe about the 2012 and the ""end"" of the Mayan calendar. I reference it all the time!",1329350400,14,148,4.321428571428571
5045937,5,B0070275KE,"With all the crazy theories regarding 2012 it is great to have a clear and true perspective.  Very well done and informative. I feel it is important to have it told from Nobel Peace Laureate Rigoberta Menchu Tum of Guatemala, and her Mayan elders.  This is the story of the people of Guatemala, not of sensationalized media.  I highly recommend this documentary, it will provide you with the real story of 2012!",1329350400,17,411,4.680555555555555
5045938,5,B0070275KE,"As a social studies teacher, I get a little tired of explaining why the hype around 2012 is misleading and, frankly, silly; my colleague's favorite response to students is, ""Do you believe in the Mayan god of corn?  No?  Then why would you choose one misinterpreted aspect of another culture to latch onto?""  I also believe that students--and the rest of us, too--should seek understanding by working with other cultures.  If I want to better understand the Maya culture, I should speak to the Maya.  But hearing these explanations from me doesn't cut it--hearing them from Rigoberta and her fellow Maya makes the difference.",1329350400,15,625,4.971153846153846
5045939,5,B0070275KE,"This is not your standard 2012 documentary - this one actually has the Mayan's speaking for themselves, as well as insight from some of the worlds most inspiring people, including The Dalia Lama, Desmond Tutu and Rigoberta Menchu Tum.  From debunking the many myths to explaining what the Mayan's believe 2012 means, this film approaches the topic in an entertaining and fun way that still carries across the wisdom of the Maya and how it coincides with the message of spiritual leaders today.

The world isn't going to end, but tough times are ahead and we all need to pull together to get through them.  This movie left me filled with hope that we can do just that, and make a better world in the process!",1329350400,3,707,4.595238095238095

8507469,5,B0070275KE,"They were right, 2012 did not happen, it was all symbolic.  However, since the angels are GOD and part of the creative process, they could have been correct and we led the world and this part of the universe into destruction and would not know it because in GOD Mind, there is no time... hmmm",1385251200,,292,4.3090909090909095
8507470,1,B0070275KE,"The fact that it didn't happen - its 2013 and nothing happened, should be a clue that this movie is crap",1381449600,,104,4.0
8507471,4,B0070275KE,this was very informative about what the Mayan's believe in. it made me think a little like they think. it was very interresting. i would have recommended it to anyone.,1359936000,,168,4.633333333333334
8507472,5,B0070275KE,This is a well put together documentary about leading Mayan Noble Peace Prize recipient Rigaberta Menchu explaining Mayan beliefs with other Mayan leaders dispelling the doomsayers that Mayans predict the end of the world. This is a thoughtfully done film. I highly recommend it.,1357171200,2,279,5.363636363636363
8507473,1,B0070275KE,"Well,here it is. Dec 22 2012,and the world is STILL intact. Just a shame that so many people believed in lies such as this,when the maya themselves even said that dec 21 wasn't the end. What's funny about this,is how NASA made all of you new age nuts look like complete fools. They know a hell of alot more than some crook author or some crazy pagans.",1356134400,,351,4.253731343283582

8507475,1,B0070275KE,"Great for people that don't think there is a prophecy.
A total waste of time and money...not one interesting
subject was brought up...save the earth...that's a prophecy???",1354752000,,171,5.37037037037037
