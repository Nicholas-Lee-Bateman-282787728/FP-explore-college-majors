8442740,4,B004V2FVSY,"Sardar Patel played the same role what Chanakya did in classical India. This movie shows it in detail. How he united more than 500 smaller kingdoms into one nation which came into being in 1947 after centuries of foreign rule. Paresh Rawal plays a rare historic role in this film. It shows all the intricate details of creation of India and Pakistan as two separate nations. At times, he is very tough against Jinnah's demands. At times he concedes to them, applying all the political and diplomatic tactics. Sometimes, Sardar even ignores Gandhi and his non-violence and appeasement to Muslims. Ketan Mehta's direction is tight. Cinematography and art direction are appropriate. Some use of Gujarati songs is also done.",1306281600,,720,5.0588235294117645
