8074489,4,B000A59Q3C,"There are two existing versions of Director Jess Franco's 'LOS AMANTES DE LA ISLA DEL DIABLO' aka 'QUARTIER DES FEMMES'- 1972 released finally in the US by Image Entertainment under the title 'DEVIL'S ISLAND LOVERS'.  This is the Spanish Version which deletes torture sequences added to spiff up the French audience and shows Franco's original intent on trying to do a hommage to the prison genre films released in the forties and fifties.  For once, it looks like he cares about the subject and his use of photographers Jose Climent and Martial Boschero shows this in some of the beauty and clarity of the images.  Its the story of two lovers Raymond and Beatriz who are in the middle of a love triangle between an older countess and the governor of their country.  The countess is hopelessly in love with Raymond who she adopted and raised but cannot sway him away from Beatriz.  Needing to marry the governor in order to gain inheritance and riches, she vows that Raymond will not prosper without her and commits murder pinning the crime on the two lovers. They are sentenced to Devil's Island and are not permitted to see each other ever again.  The story is told in flashback by the lawyer in charge of the case played by British stalwart Dennis Price who is trying to get an appeal but the commander of the prison played by Franco regular Howard Vernon has deaf ears when it comes to justice.  The story bounces back and forth getting into exploitation territory with Beatriz getting involved with the female inmates, having a ruthless female commander played with reptilian sliminess by Rosa Palomares inflicting electric shocks and whippings forseeing Franco's own future pot boiler 'GRETA, THE WICKED WARDEN'-1977 played by Ilsa herself Dyanne Thorne, and the frustration of Prices character in trying to free the lovers.  Boasting a nice music score by Bruno Nicolai and a good script by Franco and his companion at the time Nicole Guettard, it has traces of his first prison excursion '99 WOMEN'-1968 but sometimes is bogged down with the flashback overtone.  Franco would go onto make other women in prison films but not as good as this one.  Image releases the Spanish version with English subtitles and no extras in a nice 2.35 transfer which is stretched to the limit.  This may be picked up by Redemption Films as they are transferring many Image releases in the Blu-Ray format.  For those seeking Franco's usual skin and gore frolics, you may be disappointed but its great to see him in his good filmmaking element.",1345680000,2,2532,4.822170900692841
8074490,1,B000A59Q3C,"This DVD release purports to run 97 minutes - which is consistent with the IMDb information.  However, it actually runs just 80 minutes, with all nudity edited out of the film.  Consequently, the underlying story of innocent youth betrayed by jealousy is but a weak footnote to some rather bland and uncompelling scenes of ""prison depravity"".

A waste of time and money ... even for the obsessive Francophile ...",1159920000,16,412,4.942028985507246
