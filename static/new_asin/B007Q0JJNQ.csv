5104623,4,B007Q0JJNQ,"The Review

""Marriage Retreat"" is a movie promoted as, ""A roller coaster ride of love, emotion, and comedy."" This comedic movie about a trio of unhappily married couples who decide to attend a Christian Marriage Retreat located in the mountains far from their suburban home lives resonates with both humor and realism. They are introduced to an unorthodox counseling couple who submit them to a sometimes comical program of marital discovery designed to find out who or what they are missing from their lives.  Ultimately, the couples realize they are missing the key ingredient, ""Jesus Christ.""  As they discover this bedrock of marital satisfaction, the couples then retreat into a new reality with God's guidance and acknowledge that they each need to work together in order to ""live happily ever-after.""  Although this movie is presented as comical; at times it takes a very serious look at several problems related to marriage and the need for marriage counseling.

The scenes involving our first couple, Mark and Clair, involve an internal struggle regarding whether or not they should become parents; unbeknownst to Clair, Mark grew up with an abusive father and he adamantly admits he does not want to become a father himself; unbeknownst to Mark, Clair is already pregnant and waiting for the right time to tell Mark.  Our second couple, Donna and James, are facing an entirely different dilemma; Donna is already nine-months pregnant and thinking about divorcing James who is a popular soap opera star and a workaholic. Our third couple, Bobby and Melody, are struggling financially after a drop in the housing market and Bobby has developed a gambling addiction which is tearing the relationship apart.  These scenes offer a plethora of potential uses within a counseling relationship including; gambling addictions; anger; bitterness; divorce implications; fear and anxiety; money crisis; parenting; and workaholism.

Therapeutic Implications

Biblically this movie has several scenes related to understanding marriage through Scripture.  As our couples sit inside their Christian Church prior to their invitation to attend the marriage retreat, the pastor reminds them; ""For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh (Gen 2:24).""

""Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord.  For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless (Eph 5:22-33).""

Tim Clinton and Ron Hawkins authors of ""Biblical Counseling"" offer us several helpful responses to these couple's circumstances: In the case of Mark and Clair who are struggling with the decision to become parents, Mark as a victim of abuse needs to resolve his inner struggle in order to see ""He has a new Father, Jesus Christ"" in whom he can trust.  He can realize the abuse of the past does not need to be passed on to the next generation as he heals from his father's abuse, grieves his loss, regains control, finds support, establishes new boundaries and ultimately learns that he can heal through trust in God, ""I waited patiently for the Lord; and He inclined to me, and heard my cry.  He also brought me up out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my steps.  He has put a new song in my mouth (Ps 40:1-3).""

In the case of Donna who is already nine-months pregnant and thinking about divorce and James who is a popular soap opera star and a workaholic, Donna needs to communicate unconditional love and avoid evaluative remarks, express empathy, explore factors related to the work addiction, move from what she feels must be done to realize God's unconditional acceptance; God is more concerned about who the person is becoming that what he or she is doing.  ""James needs to accept God's invitation to let Him take the burden of his life and give him or her rest in its place (Matt 11:29).""

Bobby and Melody are struggling financially after a drop in the housing market; Satan has driven the wedge of gambling addiction into the marriage which is tearing the relationship apart.  Addiction is serious, is habitual, and seemingly impossible to control.  It leads to activity that is designed solely to obtain the substance or cover up its use such as a gambler embezzling to pay off debts.  Many can be helped through Christ-centered 12 step programs.  God gave people, ""richly all things to enjoy (1 Tim 6:17); ""All things are lawful for me, but all things are not helpful.  All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any (1 Cor 6:12).

Furthermore, these couples may benefit from Everett Worthington's advice regarding marriage, ""Marriage is beneficial""; it is good for people mentally, physically and economically. [5] Les and Leslie Parrott have deemed marriage not only beneficial, but have garnered research which lists the successful ingredients of a happy marriage: (1) Have healthy expectations; (2) A realistic concept of love; (3) Maintain a positive attitude and outlook toward life; (4) Communicate feelings; (5) Understand and accept gender differences; (6) Make decisions and settle arguments; and, (7) Maintain a common spiritual foundation and goal.

As these couples learn to dispel marriage myths;

* We expect exactly the same things from marriage
* Everything good in our relationship will get better
* Everything bad in my life will disappear once I'm married
* My spouse will make me whole

then the fables of, ""they lived happily ever after"" will instead become through empowerment' ""We choose to live happily ever after; by cultivating our passion, intimacy, and commitment to each other (Robert Steinberg's Triangular model of Love); following Jesus' example of forgiveness (Mk 11:25; Lk 17:4; Eph 4:32; Col 3:12-14); and aiming for cooperation, mutuality, and co-creatively with God as the helmsman.""

Personal/Professional Implications

This writer did connect with this movie on a personal level.  The opening scenes describing the marriage retreat options between the men point of view in contrast to the women point of view was both humorous; yet unbelievably real.  For the guys, the marriage retreat is a time for them to, ""Play golf, fish, and enjoy outdoor recreation and room service while their wives get fixed by the marital counselors.""  For the women, ""It's a time for them to grow emotionally with their husbands, find some security within the relationship and to bond.""  This of course challenges the different opinions and perceptions which arise within marital difficulties.

A few of the one liners that hit home for this writer include; ""Eve was kicked out of the garden too""; ""Adam was created first, Eve was to be a ""good"" second""; ""God made women to be suitable helpers for their husbands""; ""Women are supposed to point their husbands toward God""; ""I don't just want dinner and a movie for 40 years, I want more!""  Ultimately these couples learn to communicate more opening and honestly thereby resolving the marital conflicts by movies end through acts of forgiveness, understanding and reconciliation.

Although real life doesn't always happen this way (at least within an 85 minute time span); the implications of the conclusion of the movie is, God designed marriage to be a win-win situation in union with Him and the Holy Spirit, ""Jesus answered, I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me (Jn 14:6)."" This movie impacted my ministry both personally and professionally and will influence my delivery of therapeutic services with a sincere appreciation of God's marital designs, grace, forgiveness, and ultimate redemption.",1321056000,12,8105,5.00819061801936
5104624,5,B007Q0JJNQ,"Comedy abounds within a serious look at 3 couples who decide to attend a marriage retreat center. The guys planned on getting their wives fixed while they golfed and fished, and the gals hoped their men would get shaped up. Not only was there humor in their weekend ahead, but also enough conflict to cause each couple to face the true issues in their marriages. It's a Christian look at marriage repair, right down to the Holy Bibles supplied by the retreat center for each 'camper.' Yes, it's an outdoor, rustic setting, beautiful scenery, and a place in California to be coveted, if coveting over a Christian film location is allowed.

Of course the retreat owners Dr Craig and Katrina Sullivan use some rather unorthodox methods to bring success to the couples who are quickly identified as on the verge of real troubles. This couple is fantastic, singly & as a team. Jeff Fahey is the Dr., a burned out, in-your-face, negative counselor; while Victoria Jackson plays the blonde, upbeat, whiny voiced, cheerleader type. They set the high bar for the acting in this film. Faith-based filming has certainly advanced in quality.

The three couples have 2 real husband/wife pairs. Claire (Andra Logan White)is the film/real wife of Mark (David A.R. White-actor, prod) who wants no kids and is yet untold of her pregnancy. Donna (Anna Zielinski-actress, prod) is so pregnant she's about to burst and is film/real wife of James (Matthew Florida) a soap opera star. Another interesting character is a squirrely little single sad guy with a key to a computer banned to the couples. He makes a fast change from humor to sympathy, and played by Brad Stine (Christian comedian).

You can expect problems are ironed out and all is well in the end--obviously not the norm for a huge percentage of married coupled in today's real world lifestyle, whether they be Christian or not. But it makes for a pleasant ending, and makes a point of the need for a third person being the peak of a triangle focus in a marriage. God.
It's an entertaining way to look at a serious subject, preservation of the covenant of marriage. Leaves the viewer laughing and thinking. That's the obvious intent for this PURE/FLIX Entertainment company film.

Bonus was a 30-minute look behind the scenes and cast interviews, plus trailers.
Subtitles were available, but we did notice a few discrepancies between the audio vs the text. Not enough to hurt.

My wife and I both enjoyed this feature-length film. But we already have a triangle marriage. Since were in our 60s, were together 'foreverly' (my wife's word).",1320883200,15,2580,4.867881548974943

5104647,3,B007Q0JJNQ,Marriage Retreat was an ok movie. It fell short of its potential. The premise that three guys get their wives to go on a marriage retreat together so that they can get guy time gives so much room for a great plot. Instead characters are never really developed and it seems to rush to an ending. One minute the marriages are in turmoil the next they are going on a hike and all three marriages are miraculously better. It isn't a bad movie but I would suggest renting not buying.,1424304000,,478,4.322222222222222

5104663,4,B007Q0JJNQ,"The movie was a little cheesy and low budge in its setting, but other wise good. The story of the three marriages were real enough to be relatable. The acting wasn't that great from most of the actors though. With that said, I'm still showing this movie at our upcoming marriage retreat because it shows how couples can be broken almost to the point of no return by not communicating effectively.",1396742400,,396,4.591549295774648
5104664,4,B007Q0JJNQ,"Pretty funny movie.  It does have a lot to say about the commitment to marriage that isn't talked about these days.  I would highly

5104666,4,B007Q0JJNQ,I've seen some criticism and found their perspective somewhat harsh. This movie wasn't meant to convert non-Christians but more as a vehicle to teach believers how God instructs us to have a faithful and fruitful marriage but also as entertainment. I believe it fulfilled both.,1372723200,,277,5.177777777777778
5104667,4,B007Q0JJNQ,Our family only watches movies we believe would be pleasing to the Lord. We do not watch secular TV. We buy christian based DVD's instead of TV. This movie is on our shelf. A keeper! We recommend!,1368316800,9,196,4.324324324324325
5104668,4,B007Q0JJNQ,"This film was pretty good.  It is a great story about 3 couples having marital issues that go on retreat.  It's not really a comedy, but is lighthearted and entertaining.  The acting is good and the film moves right along.  It has a good biblical theme and the Bible is mentioned or quoted often.  It would be a good film to watch for couples and families, and would make a great film for a church movie night.  It is kind of campy and often predictable but it was never boring.  It kept the attention of my teenagers and they even quoted some of the lines afterward.  I bought it on BluRay and would watch it again. (which is saying a lot for me, seeing as how I rarely watch films like this twice).  It would be a good film to loan to someone, and would make a GREAT gift.  If you are a Christian or a regular church goer, you will probably like this film.
Keep in mind though,  it's not a ""cut to the heart"" film like ""FireProof"" or ""Courageous"".  So it doesn't blow you away when it's over, It's just kind of a feel good film.  To sum it up in one word....FUN...",1367884800,,1066,4.1414634146341465

5104671,4,B007Q0JJNQ,"I would actually like to give this 3 1/2 stars, but I'll be generous. It told the tale of three married couples and their problems mixing marriage and life's problems. I wish it would have emphasized more how these couples took their relationship problems to the cross. However, I have witnessed couples face problems not a lot different than the ones shown here. This movie emphasizes how important it is to be committed to each other and how to work toward solving problems, rather than to look at divorce as the answer. Anyone going thru a divorce knows how devastating it is for both partners for years to come.",1361232000,3,615,4.651376146788991

5104674,3,B007Q0JJNQ,"I really mean that, marriage is great, when we do it right. As a Christian knowing God's plan for marriage is easy but sometimes accomplishing that plan and living up to those vows can be difficult. In today's society so many want to just quit at the first sign of trouble. 99.9999% of the time is it is purely based on selfishness. This movie touches on that issue and it does have a Christian basis. While in my life that is vital to some it might not be so. This movie is kind of like a Hallmark Channel Christmas story, Predictable but with a satisfying ending. It has humor, it shows how selfish we can be as humans, but at the end it does show the importance of marriage and understanding for it to succeed we MUST sacrifice what we want and live unselfishly.

5104678,1,B007Q0JJNQ,"This could have been a great movie, but poor production values held it back. The acting was stilted. Scenes didn't link together well, and some made no sense as to why they were included. Then suddenly there's miracles galore (sarcasm), but they had to wrap up the film in 10 minutes. A women has a 60 second labor, not likely for a first-time mother. The new father vows to quit his high-paying soap opera gig in order to focus on his wife and kid. That's nice, but you jettisoned your income source just when family expenses are going to increase. That's irresponsible and immature. This is the director's idea of a good father? Everybody resolves to do better in the last 5 minutes, despite months' and even years' worth of issues building up. Unrealistic.

5104679,4,B007Q0JJNQ,"God truly has a sense of humor, and that's where this film starts out. The seriousness of the subjects is handled in a matter of fact way with a light touch that reminded me that God is in charge. Taking one step at a time, the Lord leads His children forthrightly, in a loving chastening way, His Way. Defining moments come for the couples in a cornucopia of decisions. For the marriage counselors, faith is fortified by realizing it is in His strength that we move and have our being, not our own.",1346025600,3,499,4.376344086021505
5104680,4,B007Q0JJNQ,"This is a Christian movie that deals with the disillusion and disfunction three couples are facing in their marriages, which leads them to the retreat.

I liked this movie in that it is Christian, and states plainly for a marriage to truly work, God must be the center.

I thought though this movie moved the couples from angry to happy rather quickly, with one counseling session and one walk down a hill. That's fast work!

Also the pregnant woman, who looks ready to deliver any moment - and the obvious scene we all know is coming up - was a little tacky.

Other than, a good movie that'll help couples evaluate where they are and where they want to be.",1344902400,,657,4.45

It is not the best acted movie or best technically but it is peppered with extremely insightful and meaningful lines and scenes.
The more I've watched, the more I've learned.
Katrina, the ditzy wife of the professional counselor, turned out to be a true model of a godly wife and she is my personal hero.
Thanks to all who made this film.  I think it will touch many lives in deep and important ways.",1334534400,2,469,4.269662921348314

Overall though I learned a GREAT deal.  The one line about ""the mirror lies to you"" I was able to use about two days after I heard it with my daughter that called me about an issue she was having.  Not with her marriage but the line helped immensively with the image issue she was having.

I loved it that there wasn't any need for vulgar and infantile potty humor.  It dealt with some really serious and all too real problems in marriage.  Sure, it was corny at times - but I rather take this corniness and not stellar acting over other movies made about this subject with multi million dollar actors and expensive backdrops that teach you nothing and actually attack marriage instead of help them.",1330905600,,839,4.346153846153846
5104684,5,B007Q0JJNQ,"A husband with a gambling addiction,

A wife who is pregnant, but hasn't yet told her husband because she knows he doesn't want children; and,

A wife whose workaholic soap-opera- star husband's priorities are a bit out of order.

Three couples are having problems in their marriage and aren't even sure if they'll remain married. What are they do? Enter into the picture a guest couple at church who advertises their marriage retreat. The wives, all friends, feel this retreat might just help their marriages, but aren't sure how they'll be able to convince their husbands to attend. Meanwhile, the husbands, also all friends, think the retreat is the ticket to a relaxing vacation of fun in the sun at a beautiful retreat in the mountains.  Now, if they can just convince their wives...

Marriage Retreat is a humorous, and at times serious, look at problems that can plague today's marriages.  The marriage counselors are a giving pair whose main goal is to serve the Lord through their marriage ministry. The husband is a serious, to-the-point man, who interviews the participants, one-on-one, and leaves each person with a question to ponder.  His wife, on the other hand, is the vivacious, energetic, high-voiced, happy type who balances out her husband's more somber nature.

This movie is highly recommended and definitely worth the watch and includes, not only some hilarious parts, but also includes some takeaway value for all marriages.  There is nothing objectionable in this movie (although very young children might be frightened when one of the wives gives birth, although nothing graphic is shown).

Better yet, why not invite just your spouse to sit and watch this wonderful movie with you for a date night?

I have added this movie to my listing of mom-approved movies on my wordpress blog.
