8399907,5,B003LY6HZO,"I remember seeing this movie in East Germany when I was a teenager, it made such an impression on me at the time, that I had never forgotten about it. I was so glad to finally be able to view it again. It is a powerful anti war movie made in the cold war by Russians. It did not lay blame on anyone, it just showed the human suffering and fate in times of war.
An excellent film.",1362787200,,379,3.871794871794872
