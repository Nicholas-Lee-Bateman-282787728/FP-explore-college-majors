2891852,1,B000T28FME,"The dvd is encoded at half the resolution that the medium is capable of.

It's 16 by 9 widescreen format has been squeezed to fit into a 4 by 3 box.

The video is interlaced which means horrible lines going across your screen all the time.

This dvd was transferred at the quality of a VHS tape. It is unwatchable on all but the oldest and smallest crt screens.

For a show I would otherwise love this is treason.",1296259200,,413,4.189873417721519
2891853,3,B000T28FME,"This is an awesome Alton Brown series.  He artfully combines his love of motorcycling, and travel with food.  I too love both.  I can only give it 3 stars because of a terrible DVD transfer.  Try watching this amazing series on a HDTV.  It's horrible and painful and almost criminal as the show was obviously shot in widescreen.  They framed and matted the picture for a 4:3 TV.  For a 2006 series, ignorance of Anamorphic DVD is pretty much unforgivable.  An otherwise beautiful show, spoiled by a cut rate DVD transfer.",1262304000,11,521,4.648351648351649
2891854,5,B000T28FME,"Feasting On Asphalt is a superb four part series from Good Eats' Alton Brown.  Setting across the country in one month on a motorcycle, Mr. Brown sets out on a journey in search of authentic ""road food"".  Traversing his way through the South, into the Midwest and ultimately the road food capital of the country, Los Angeles, Mr. Brown takes the viewer off the beaten path into restaurants, drive-in's, luncheonettes and other eateries in both the small towns and big cities.  Sprinkled with his trademark wit as well as some deep thoughts, the show is an interesting and captivating travelogue of the highways and byways of this country. Plus you get to see Mr. Brown wipeout big time on his motorcycle.  The dvd has outtakes which essentially gives you four alternative episodes, so if you have already seen the original episodes these are worth the cost of the set.",1222819200,4,868,4.805369127516778
2891855,5,B000T28FME,"If you're a fan of Alton Brown's hit show Good Eats on the Food Network, or of motorcycling in general, you're going to love this series.  He rides the way I wish I could; now if I could only get away for a month of motorcycling and culinary exploration.......",1207008000,,260,4.3061224489795915
2891856,5,B000T28FME,This is fun and informational to watch espically if you travel  on your motorcycle and even in your car.....Would have bought  Feasting on Asphalt II but is not out yet. DVD would be best..seen there is a book... So buy it..you'll enjoy it.,1198368000,,240,4.558139534883721
2891857,5,B000T28FME,"Although we watch the Food Network, I guess we don't watch it enough and I'd not heard of this show until I read about it in a Motorcycle magazine last year. Then I couldn't find it until this DVD set became availible just before the second season started. I really liked the series. I'm not into racing and that has always been the primary programming shown that features motorcycles. Racing or Strugis. So to see this was a lot of fun. Alton Brown is very funny but I also liked the area history that he covered on his travels for this series. The DVD set is better because the annoying commercials are only at the beginning of each disk and can be fast forwarded through. No pop up on screen adds or all the other junk that's on all the shows now-a-days when broadcast. So now I can't wait for season 2 to be availible!",1197331200,,822,4.309677419354839
2891858,5,B000T28FME,"I have always been a devout fan of Good Eats. However, this particular series really communicates Alton Brown's love for the journey in understanding food--how food is both an expression of culture and community, as well as a driving force in maintaining and creating culture and community.

Feasting on Asphalt is filled with a reverence for the every-day people that make this country the terrific, diverse, stock pot that it is.  Watch this show, and you will want to get out there on the road, meet some of these people, eat a lot of food, and bask in the wonder of all the stories and communities that must be out there for you to discover.  It will also make you think about the micro- and macro-cultures in which you were raised, and make you curious about how the foods and traditions of your family and community came to be.

In an increasingly homogenized world of large chains and Anywhere USA towns, Feasting on Asphalt shows us that hope is not lost.  We are still here.  We are still eating and cooking and living.

A big thank you to Alton and his dedicated crew.",1191110400,18,1078,4.55440414507772
2891859,5,B000T28FME,I'm so glad to see this released on DVD.  I taped it from the Food Network and was just rewatching and remembering how much I enjoyed it.  It is very entertaining to watch Alton and his team travel/eat their way across the country.  As always I love all the extra info Alton provides.  It will be nice to see it without the commercials.,1186185600,11,336,4.285714285714286
8207189,4,B000T28FME,"Like Alton Brown but this series is a little flat in entertainment, especially for what it normally costs.
Found used set from third party at reasonable cost so ok with that. Discs were in pristeen like new condition.",1520553600,,217,4.7368421052631575

8207191,5,B000T28FME,"This series is the perfect confluence of Alton Brown's engaging foodie personality, motorcycling, and the open road.  It's a natural evolution for anyone who enjoys Good Eats *and* motorcycling, and if you've ever dreamed of motorcycling across the country, this is the video series for you.  Imagine the excitement of a motorcycle trip across the U.S. with Alton serving as a tour guide and teacher of culture and food history a la Good Eats.  In addition to talking about restaurants, he also dabbles in making campsite meals, meals heated with motor exhaust, etc.

This season has the primary 4 episodes:
1.  The South Shall Fry Again
2.  I Smell Pork
3.  High Plains Feaster
4.  California or Bust

It also has 4 full-length bonus episodes...one to accompany each primary episode.  While the bonus episodes cover some of the same ground, they are sufficiently different (and a little less formal) enough to essentially be new episodes.

Content is terrific; however, video quality is a B.  It's 480i letterboxed widescreen, so resolution is a bit low once the frame expands to fill modern widescreen TVs.  Actual picture resolution ends up being only 720x360.  There also some noticeable black vignetting in the frame and a few pixels of junk picture content on all sides of the frame.

Ebay is a great place to find this series (especially Season 2) at reasonable used prices.",1458432000,,1381,4.943478260869565
8207192,5,B000T28FME,"This four-part series was aired in 2006 to no small amount of acclaim.  It showed that Alton Brown was more than just the goofy Good Eats guy.  No, Brown has production chops as well, and this series showed that he is much more than a one trick pony.  Note that when this series aired, Brown was well on his way to being ""the guy"" at the Food Network, showing up in many different shows.

Now, in 2015, I thought it would be interesting to revisit this series.  I'm pleased to see that even nine years later, the show still holds up (and, honestly, does very well what Guy Fieri's ""Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives"" utterly fails to accomplish...).  The themes Brown runs through, which is to say the search for old-school road food and service, are still very much relevant today, if not moreso.  In our world of prepackaged, standardized, one-size-fits-all products, it's important to remember a slightly slower, slightly more unique, and much more *human* environment.

Indeed, be sure to watch the behind-the-scenes featurettes in this set, in particular the one for ""The South Shall Fry Again.""  There's a somewhat melancholy, somewhat poignant musing by Brown as he wonders what he's trying to accomplish in this series.  He expressed fear that the America he was looking for, the America that he describes in the opening as one where hospitality takes on *old* meanings, no longer existed.  And indeed, over the past nine years that fear seems even further justified to me.  Several of the places featured in this show (such as The Biscuit Place in Washington, GA) are apparently further casualties in the March Toward Progress.  And that's a damned shame.  I wouldn't trade one  Biscuit Place for one thousand McDonald's franchises.  But more and more, that seems to be where we are going.

Simply put, this series is excellent.  Entertaining and informative (I never knew what a Cake Lady was until I watched this set), with fantastic production values courtesy of Brown and his crew.  It is a classic, one that deserves watching.  Repeatedly.",1433030400,2,2048,4.881159420289855
8207193,5,B000T28FME,Loved this show when it was on TV and I was happy to find it on Amazon for a birthday present.,1388966400,,94,3.5238095238095237
8207194,5,B000T28FME,"I love this series -- and it is so hard to find! Something to note -- there are not three discs of episodes.
There are two discs with 2 episodes each. The third disc is just full of extras. It is the complete program, though.
They travel across the US stopping at local eateries to find native flavors. Very interesting!
The second series of Feasting on Asphalt (where they go up the Mississippi River) is a bit longer and also good.
There was a third -- Feasting on Waves -- but I am not sure it was ever released to

8207197,5,B000T28FME,"I'd seen this series when it aired on Food Network. My friend is a motorcyclist and I thought he'd like it. It was just as entertaining watching it the second time around. Bonus clips were good, too.",1352073600,,199,4.405405405405405
8207198,5,B000T28FME,"For you Good Eats and Alton Brown fans out there, you won't want to miss this. These seem to be hard to get now on DVD, but I think rarely the Cooking Channel shows an episode here and there, which is where I first came upon it and made me want to seek it out.

Basically, if you feel like you are full on Diner's, Drive-Ins and Dives, and other road trip food surveys, this may pique your taste buds in a different way. Of course - its the AB way. Not only do you get to learn about road food, but you get the history of both the road, the food and the culture along the way. Alton starts out in Georgia on a BMW bike with his crew (all on bikes, because he feels thats the best way to drive across the country). Alton has a fun and intimate personality that he brings. Its not the ""scientific"" brain that he uses on Good Eats, but certainly bring his curiosity about the history of the food or the restaurant. He doesn't seem so interested in what goes into making the food or how its made, per se (although he does investigate), its more about the experience of local food that cater to travelers. Its definitely not healthy food, but its tasty and its real.

The quality of the video, as others have mentioned, is not up to par. It has a VHS quality to it which is too bad. But given that this is the only way to see it, its fine for viewing. There are only 4 episodes and each episode he spends a lot of time in a particular area, and because there are only 4 episodes, you don't get to cross the country. Not sure if that was the intention, but it seemed so. Aside from the episodes, there are deleted scenes and then a bonus disc which has 2 versions of the first 2 episodes with different cuts and with commentary by Alton, which were great to listen to.

Overall its a great set. There is a book to accompany the show with photographs and writings about the journey which is also recommended.",1322956800,3,1901,4.1603260869565215
