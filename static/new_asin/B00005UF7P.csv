1665421,2,B00005UF7P,"""Epicenter"" has a neat premise but spotty execution, and is ultimately undone by lousy casting. But it's nowhere near as bad as negative commentators here would have you believe.

Gary Daniels is a techie who tried to sell spyplane plans to a foreign government, but is caught in the act by an FBI agent and stressed single mom laughingly played by Traci Lords.

Suddenly, the Greatest Earthquake Ever Known doesn't send them to the Land of the Lost, but just makes it a little bit more difficult for Traci to deliver Daniels to the proper authorities, while the bad guys try to execute them both.

You know what? This movie was a hoot. It was a low-budget, Traci-Lords-starring, direct-to-video, not-enough-Jeff-Fahey hoot, and all you h8ters can just hush the heck up.

So what if this movie repurposes a scene from ""Metro""? Have you seen ""Metro""? I wouldn't wipe the schmutz under my nads with the rest of that movie. I'm glad someone put its one decent action scene to a better use.

And to all those folks crying, ""Hey, that's the same elevator from 'Speed'!"" Find a girl, kiss her, and stop spending your time pointing out similar elevators in movies.

Dollar Tree had this for, yep, a dollar. Not sure I'd spend much more, but glad I laid out the buck for this one.",1355011200,3,1272,4.631111111111111
1665422,3,B00005UF7P,"This movie, while is not a bad movie is not a disaster film either, if you're into a disaster thrill, this is not really that, the eartquake is not the center of focus in the movie,.. just a tool, the movie is around this bad guy and the FBI agent lady, Jeff Fahey plays the bad guy (for a change.) the trama has action, drama and a good ending, the title of the movie should not be 'Epicenter',but something more on the action hero theme,.. but the acting is quite good.!",1239494400,,472,4.197802197802198
1665423,2,B00005UF7P,"If you've seen action movies such as Die Hard and True Lies, than you'll want to check this out.  Don't let my 2/5 scare you away, no no no.  This is the sort of movie you need to see once in a while to remind you how good those other movies are.  The plot, to start with, is a huge mess.  Nick Constantine decides to bring down a corporation that he blames for his wife's death, so he steals an advanced computer  chip or something.  Anyway, the whole movie revolves around this guy, Nick, and the chip that he has.  Some bald Russian dude is trying to get it from him, as well as a female FBI agent, who is transfering Nick to Los Angeles after arresting him in a strip club in San Fransisco.  Behind all this the largest earthquake to ever his Los Angeles is going on and is being covered by a newswoman about to fall asleep and crash her helicopter into some stock footage of L.A.  Ok, here's where it gets really interesting.  The FBI agent's neglected daughter is also in L.A.  Her mom, the FBI agent, is going to meet her at a mall because she doesn't want her to live with her dad, so the daughter is meeting Biff's little brother at this mall in case her mom doesn't show up.  Now, for the most interesting part of the entire movie.  During the earthquake the daughter and Biff's youger sibling get stuck on an elevator with an old man named Patrick, who carries a stuffed animal of a parrot around with him because he ""likes birds alot"".  Than there's a plot twist and another FBI agent is running around with the Russians, shooting through floors, and falling through streets in trucks.  Ok, I lied about those things being the most interesting parts in the movie, because they aren't.  Do they sound interesting?  No, they don't.  During this film we are treated to gunfights, surprisingly impressive earthquake sets, and the most bricks I've ever seen raining out of the sky.  There are minature shots of these glass skyscrapers being ravaged by the earthquake sending glass down to the streets, then, there's a shot of people running around on the streets with bricks falling all around them.  Where did these bricks come from?  Than there's scenes inside of these buildings and guys are running around, and seriously, it looks like the bricks are simply appearing and falling out of nowhere at them.  This is a must-see for anyone who's into modern action.  This'll make the big titles seem even better.  Oh, the DVD has ""play movie"" and ""scene selection"", and there aren't even pictures for the scene selection.  The picture is about as grainy as a grain barn, and the clearest audio is probably the peoples' shoes clonking on the floors.  Enjoy.",1102032000,12,2662,4.5399159663865545
1665424,5,B00005UF7P,"EPICENTER kicks off in high gear and maintains a frenetic pace that keeps the adrenaline pumping....and that's all I ask from a B action thriller.  I don't expect great acting, or deep psychological motivations.  This is a great popcorn movie.  And some other interesting things about it:
*Gary Daniels, like fellow martial arts actors Chuck Norris, David Bradley, etc., will never win any Oscars.  But this ruggedly handsome and quite different actor shows a deep desire to at least put as much as he can into his performance.  In this one, he relies on this ability rather than his martial arts.  He doesn't take his shirt off at all, and he has only one real fight scene, which is very brief.
*Traci Elizabeth Lords likewise won't make the world forget Meryl Streep or Sigourney Weaver, but given her background, her ability to rise even this far is commendable.
*It was good to see venerable character actor Henry Beckman again.  As the old codger trapped in the elevator with the two kids, he and his parrot reminded me of those great older movies where actors like Beckman played such a fun, integral part.
*And in spite of everything, the movie has a happy ending without the lovers consummating their relationship.
It's a fundamentally adrenaline rush!",1076630400,7,1260,4.859813084112149
1665425,1,B00005UF7P,"EPICENTER commits one of the worst crimes I've ever seen commited by a film and it's creators. What's that crime you ask? Stealing! I don't blame the screenwriter. I don't blame Gary Daniels (I mean for a ""B"" action star he usually makes decent ""B"" action fare) but I do blame whoever used the scenes from METRO with Eddie Murphy and the train sequences from MONEY TRAIN and the elevator scene from SPEED. Don't beleieve me? Watch this, then watch METRO and the other movies mentioned. I thought I was the only one who would notice this but apparently I am not. It's that freaking obvious! The whole beginning chase scene is from METRO. They added two bad guy characters to focus on just because Eddie Murphy and Michael Rappaport were their stand ins. I think it's absolute bull---- that the stunt men for METRO and teh special effcets people for SPEED and MONEY TRAIN didn't get paid twice. I mean, technically they worked on this stupid waste of celluloid and didn't even receive credit (not that they'd want it) for it. This film is ridiculous! Stealing scenes from another movie is, in my opinion, the laziest, cheapest, worst thing that could be done in a film. I've already seen METRO - why would I want to see the same exact chase again? I mean, if you don't have the money to make your own movie then don't make it and like director Robert Rodriguez said, if you've written something in your script that you cant afford to shoot...rewrite the script!
Skip this movie -- It isn't worth the one star...",1024790400,3,1509,4.571955719557195
1665426,5,B00005UF7P,"Epicenter, starring Traci Elizabeth Lords, has already been released internationally.  After seeing it both in theater and on the German language DVD, I am thrilled to see this US action thriller released on DVD here in the US.  The special effects are incredible.

I prefer 5.1 surround but the Pro Logic took good care of the stereo presentation. I don't generally like disaster TV but there was lots of action and violence. There was lots of shooting and explosions. There was nice pursuit scenes. There was punching and kicking. I like the helicopters. I was bothered by the romance parameter and will henceforth disregard that parameter because it played a minor role. Thank you, Amazon Prime.",1518307200,,567,4.737373737373737

7954595,2,B00005UF7P,"Nick Constantine (Gary Daniels) works for Global Technology and listens to Neil Diamond. He obtains data to track stealth bombers and agrees to sell it to the Russians (back when they had money and cared) for $15 million dollars (millions with an ""M"" and not billions with a ""B""). He is prevented by the FBI and deep cover agent Amanda Foster played by Traci ""Elizabeth"" Lords trying to live down her other film career where she couldn't act either...but didn't have to.

For some reason this takes place in San Francisco, perhaps for the ""bottoming out"" scenes, and then for no real reason they go to LA for the earthquake, when San Francisco would have worked just as well. Nick still has a chip that everybody wants. Traci insists on escorting him while Jeff Fahey places a double agent mole, which you suspect the moment his slimy looking character appears on screen.

Traci's daughter (Katie Stuart, Shadowcat X-Man 2)  is trapped at a mall and mom needs to save her before she maxes out the credit card. Meanwhile she and her prisoner need to save lives along the way and avoid the bad guys.

Horrible plot execution. Bad formula acting.

7954596,2,B00005UF7P,"Well, if there is an earthquake in California it should really be the main character and not just a supporting actor - especially if it makes you wait until the movie is almost over until it appears (kinda like the newest Godzilla movie - Big G as a supporting actor - oh, the humanity!).  Tracy was ... Tracy.  No boobs, but I wasn't expecting any.  You know, it's really a shame that American porn actors can't be taken seriously by the straight studios while Japanese A/V actors can make the transition and keep their fans as they pursue a ""legitimate"" acting career.  Nothing special here.  FBI, yada, yada, yada, prisoner transfer, yada, yada, yada.  Earthquake - people doing stupid stuff.  The usual.",1413849600,2,707,4.745901639344262
7954597,3,B00005UF7P,"While it has its faults and is definitely not a major studio megabucks film, compared to the average of its type it is good entertainment. The fundamental theme is the attempt by the FBI to recover stolen information vital to national defense. Secondary is the earthquake which occurs just as the Bad Guys and the Good Guys are in the OK Corral (so to speak) ready for a shoot-out. I agree with one of the reviewers that this should not be classified as a Disaster film, although if you are thinking of buying it from Amazon, it is best to buy the Disaster 6 Film collection which has this and five other movies, some good, others watchable, at little cost. Don't expect a Bruce Willis level of production (although a few of his clunkers were no better than this) but, with some tolerance for the acting and the script, it can be as good as the average made for TV film you might be thinking of as an alternative.",1374969600,,913,4.408284023668639
