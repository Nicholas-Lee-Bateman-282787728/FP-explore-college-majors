8140036,5,B000HJTHSU,"This DVD is so funny that I have my adult friends watch it - and they LOVE it.  We order this DVD as a present for parents of toddlers.  It's perfect for those times that you want to let your kid watch 10 minutes of TV. This particular Veggie Tales DVD doesn't have any mention of God in it.  It's just a compilation of funny, well-written, cute, music numbers that feature the veggies tales characters. Like a 'best of' DVD for Veggie Tales.",1214956800,5,442,4.301204819277109
