8395159,3,B003E1R5UK,I love this anime and everything it's one of my favorites but it is not worth $300 I only paid $30 for the first season.,1358985600,,120,3.84
8395160,5,B003E1R5UK,This one takes off where the first season left off.  With the girls coming back to the mystical land and this time their facing new enemies invading the land and old characters come back.  I think this was a big improvement of the first and it explored some new ground in this.,1351728000,,277,4.3076923076923075
8395161,3,B003E1R5UK,"Magic Knight Rayearth 2 continues the adventures of Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu, who saved the magical land of Cephiro from certain doom. This time around, the story is darker and edgier, and the three Magic Knights must defend Cephiro from three invading nations, who seek the power of the Pillar.
However, as exciting as it may sound, it sadly fails to deliver. Much of the show has the characters talk, and talk, and talk about past events and their current predicament. There are also a few unnecessary romances thrown in, which do little more than to slow the story down.
There is good news, though. Nova proves to be a great addition to the story. Basically, she Hikaru's evil twin and is possibly the most twisted villain I've ever seen in a kid's cartoon! The two opening themes ""Kirai ni Narenai"" and ""Hikari to Kage wo Dakishimeta Mama"" are also quite catchy. And there are some decent action scenes when the characters aren't busy talking it up.
Overall, not a bad anime, but not a great one either. There is some nudity including a bath scene in which the girls talk about, er, puberty stuff. And there's some fairly tame fantasy violence and some profanity. Probably, OK for kids 10 and up, but parents may want to screen it beforehand.",1345161600,,1242,4.65
8395162,5,B003E1R5UK,"this is what i've been waiting for! i am an original mkr season 1 and 2 box set owner of the dvds which i like, especially season 2's boxset was beautiful, but what lacked in both seasons was the fact that the title sequences, missing original second opening, and previews etc were missing.
now in these new sets you get digitally remastered season 1 and 2 boxsets, with original title sequences intact, original eye catchers unaltered, and the episode preview for the following ep, for each ep remastered. i love it! i bought season 2 first and i'm pleasantly surprised by the quality. i'm buying season 1 as soon as i can!

now fully remaster the ova and we're set!",1292630400,2,667,4.558333333333334
8395163,5,B003E1R5UK,"If you're new to the series, I'd definitely read another review detailing the DVD release.
If you're interested in product details, peruse on...

The 15 anniversary edition release of Magic Knight Rayearth, Season 2 has been pushed back until 09/07/2010 by Media Blasters... later is better than never.

Anime Works got a hold of the original master film for Magic Knight Rayearth, Season 2 and they have faithfully dished out a new 6-disc DVD set, digitally remastered. Is it worth schilling out yet more money for yet another release??? Simply put : YES. The picture quality is nothing short of STUNNING. Where the old versions were dark, grainy, fuzzy with black particles floating everywhere, this release is pristine, sharp and extremely colourful. I literally was shocked.

To add yet another bonus... the missing sections from the episodes, around 4 minutes, has been gratefully restored... with the original Japanese title intro, commercial exit/intros, the preview for the next episode, and the 'guessing game' (that was previously part of the 'extras'). Very much like what Hasbro has done with the 25th anniversary release of their Transformers cartoons.

Is there a downside??? Anything negative???
Unfortunately just one, that can pretty much, for the most part, be slightly overlooked... the awful method of packaging they chose... not only do we get another thin, flimsy cardboard slipcase... the disc holders are also extremely thin cardboard digi-paks... it could have been boxed with at least jewel-cases or something a bit more sturdy.

Otherwise, it is quite worth the purchase alone for the digitally remastered DVDs.",1280793600,10,1638,5.308880308880309
8395164,5,B003E1R5UK,"If you finished watching the first season of Magic Knight Rayearth, you need to watch the second. Basically, it's better in every way. Instead of a single crisis (a kid-napped princess and countless minions to deal with, requiring becoming said Magic Knights), there are now several, each one complicated.

1. A new pillar needs to be found before Cephiro disappears.
2. Other nations have chose this time of weakness to invade.
3. An unknown force of destruction wants to destroy everyone

Things basically pick up right where the first season left off. Despite their intentions to rescue the princess and save the day, Hikaru, Fuu, and Umi did something that is tearing them to pieces. They killed the princess, her lover/kidnapper, and several people who supported them, all the while thinking they were performing a brave rescue until they finally learned the truth at the last minute (the princess was kidnapped to keep them from killing her). Yeah, that sort of thing can get you down when you're a 15-year-old schoolgirl. Wishing to right this perceived wrong, the three once again are transported to Cephiro, swearing to do something to help its people.

The multiple plots of the story progress at the same time, and are all ultimately resolved rather quickly towards the end of the series, but once again the character development and a spirit of adventure keeps things fresh and interesting. Many old characters return (the ultra-cool-Clef is one character I'm particularly glad is given screen-time doing something other than give vague advice from a viewscreen {he was turned to stone in the first episode of season one for crying out loud!}), and some new characters make appearances as well. I gotta tell you though, the nice level of variety found in this season is a welcome change. You'll see former villains now acting as allies, chats between characters about just about everything, and plenty of opportunity for our three girl-heroes to act like the Knights we know they are (I just love it when after finally becoming a hero, you get to see a character ACT like a hero, and show how much they have grown). Once again, the first season just laid the foundation for a bigger story, and here is where it really starts to flesh out.

This show really is better than the first in every way. The artwork is consistently higher quality throughout, the music is better, the direction is tighter and more dramatic, the dialog is more complex, the emotional turmoil given greater buildup sharper edge, the character defined with even more flair, and the animation, fights, and overall conclusion are just...better.

You could argue that the show has less focus this time around, as characters negotiate and communicate more than just trying to kill each other like they did before, but I think that gives the show even more heart as you see that almost no one is really ""evil"", and ultimately they are just trying to do what they think is right. Except... For the first episode of the second season, you just KNOW that the shadow lady from Hikaru's nightmares is the REAL villain here, a monster given birth to by fear that seeks the destruction of everything. To me, that was the best aspect of the show (along with Hikaru's nemesis Nova who loves and hates her at the same time and provides the very best fight of both seasons in my opinion), even though it goes very much into Sailor Moon ""Doom Phantom"" territory. The real story hinges though, on the fate of Cephiro as it relates to the Pillar, and I can only say that while the ultimate ending may have seemed a bit too convenient or last-minute, it definitely is emotionally powerful and satisfying, providing a VERY much needed happy ending to a very melancholy two seasons of desperate fights to save a dying world.

I love this season even more than the first. Watch, and you will see Hikaru fall in love, Fuu win an archery tournament, and Umi defeat two fencing masters. You will see giant illusion monsters, dancing genies, and more giant robot battles. You will see friendship and loyalty, hatred and despair, but ultimately again be told a tale of the power of the heart that believes. If you WATCHED the first season you need to watch this one. If you bought the first season then you have to own it. Especially now that it is properly mastered and being sold at a bargain price!",1273881600,5,4357,4.771883289124668
8395165,5,B003E1R5UK,"This is the second season of the Magic knights rayearth and I think this is even better than the first season!
