Warning:  you have to be able to understand some Japanese as the English subtitles are quite poor in comparison to many other dramas that are similarly translated by Chinese.  Look at the positive side - you can practice your Japanese!  ;-)
The format is not sized for HDTV and thus, the picture does not fill up the entire screen.  However, the picture quality is good enough.",1357257600,,424,4.739726027397261
