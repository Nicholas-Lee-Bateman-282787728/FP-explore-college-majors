3786021,5,B001SMC9L2,"Man Hunt by Fritz Lang was a great Noir with Walter Pidgeon, John Carradine, George Sanders, Joan Bennett. It takes place during WW2 - Walter Pidgeon is being hunted by Germans (headed by George Sanders)  to have him sign a paper admitting he tried to kill Hitler during a hunt for fun/sport moment. This has some great chase scenes all around London, & a really good love interest. It was a great subplot. This has great direction by Fritz Lang; I loved the scenes where there is no sound or music while Pidgeon tries to escape the Germans. George Sanders is great in this. Watch for a young Roddy McDowall. With its great acting, a great story, atmospheric,this is an all around great film that I very much recommend. The DVD transfer is crisp and sharp.
To be honest, I bought this without seeing it first because I heard so many great things about this title. Now I can stand behind all those opinions.",1243209600,13,906,4.524390243902439
3786022,5,B001SMC9L2,"I have loved this film for many years and have awaited it coming out on video.  That said, the restoration looks great compared to TV versions I've seen.  I've only seen a few minutes of the documentary plus the trailer, but these features seem to be more than on most older films.  It's an exciting story played out against the backdrop of early WWII (even if the central premise is a bit far-fetched.)  This is one movie I can watch several times and still enjoy.",1242777600,22,465,4.435294117647059
3786023,5,B001SMC9L2,"Taut direction and splendid performances distinguish this World War II thriller about a big game hunter pursued by Nazis after he is caught targeting Hitler in his gunsights, and manages to escape back to Britain.  Walter Pidgeon is fine as the stalwart ""Rogue Male"" (the film's original title, taken from the book on which the script was based), and George Sanders is supremely villainous as the crafty Nazi who is tracking him.  On the distaff side, Joan Bennett is touching and convincing as an ill-fated Cockney streetwalker who is caught up in the conflict between warring ideologies; this is the first film of four that she made with director Fritz Lang, for whom she gave some of her finest film performances in the mid-forties (including ""The Woman in the Window"" and ""Scarlet Street"", made for their own independent company, Diana Productions).

Briskly paced and edited, ""Man Hunt"" remains a tense thriller throughout its 105 minute running time, right up to its suspenseful climax.  Seldom screened on television or in revival, and never before released on video, this classic film (which enjoys a small but avid cult following) has been long-awaited and arrives highly recommended.",1238457600,62,1193,5.134020618556701
3786024,5,B001SMC9L2,"""Man Hunt"" is an excellent thriller that doesn't look like it is almost seventy years old, and is one of my favorite Fritz Lang films. Ahead of its time in the complexity of its characters, it is about a British hunter (Walter Pidgeon) who contemplates assassinating Hitler when he gets him in his gun sight and gets caught doing so. Left for dead at the bottom of a cliff by the authorities, he lives and makes his way to a boat on its way to London. However, on the ship there is someone all too interested in his story. Soon he realizes he is being followed. Back in London he turns to Joan Bennett for help. If I'm getting the details wrong, it's because it's been about ten years since I've seen this one anywhere. Lang manages to do a very good job of portraying the Nazis in a more complex and articulate manner than other films of this time period (it was made in 1941). The following is the list of extras:

You can take Man Hunt as a far fetched adventure story, just like Indiana Jones, forget about history, check your disbelief at the door, and just go for the ride. Call it Camp by today's standards, but the film really stands on it's own and the acting is terrific!
The score by Alfred Newman (one of the giants of film scoring and uncle of Randy Newman) is super and somewhat of a precursor to John Williams, IJ,  by something like forty years. There's even a great love theme (the old English pop tune, A Nightingale Sang In Berkley Square) which is cleverly woven into its fabric.
It gets a tad preachy, in the tacked on ending, but I suspect the studio sensors had something to do with that. So, all in all, if you love Fritz Lang and adventure done in the style Film Noir this is for you.",1461715200,,917,4.42603550295858

3786039,4,B001SMC9L2,"A lot of people, myself included, like to think about certain historical events in the conditional-the what ifs of history. You know what if Robert E. Lees orders had not gotten into Union Army hands before Antietam, what if Joe Stalin had listened to his well-connected spy networks and acted on the information that Hitler was going full force to invade the Soviet Union, and would the ensuing escalation of the Vietnam War have happened if Jack Kennedy had not been assassinated. And with certain limits such speculation is worthwhile, especially to historians. Those limits being that other things actually did happen and one should not go too far in such speculations. Obviously, and the film under review, Man Hunt, about a fictional scenario involving the possible assassination of Adolph Hitler in 1939 bears this out literature and cinema have wider scope for such conjecture.

Here is how this cinematic what if played out. Well-known African safari hunter Captain Alan Thorndike, played by Walter Pidgeon, tired of the same old, same old, at least that is the story he would tell later decided to see if he could hunt big game. Could pull off an attempt on Adolph Hitlers life out in his rural retreat. He actually pulled it off-theoretically-but failed to kill the beast since (a) he was only stalking, had only been in it for the hunt not the killing, or (b) a sentry happened upon him to spoil his possibilities. That former argument is the one he made when captured and interrogated by a Major, a high German security officer, played by villainous George Sanders, who naturally did not believe him but who for his own purposes and that of his Fuehrer tortured him in order to have him sign a statement that he acted as an agent of the British government by his action (and obviously the intense reality  for war Europe in 1939 that statement might have been a tipping point for the madmen to jump the gun and roll over Europe right then). But the Captain was made of sterner stuff and balked as that request. The Major though deviously decided that the Captain could be used to further his aims if he got rid of him and substituted one of his own men in his place. But the planned killing didn't work and the Captain escaped. Now the chase, now the man hunt of the title was on for real.

The Captain through stealth and deviousness got himself back to England but with the Major and his entourage hot on his trail. He was almost caught except for the good graces of a young working-class girl in London, okay a streetwalker, played by the fetching Joan Bennett, who helped his through thick and thin, helps him because he treated her like a lady, helped him because she was half- schoolgirl in love with him, and helped him in the end by her own death at the hands of the Nazi scum. As for the Captain and the Major, after a lengthy game of cat and mouse the Captain proved to be the better hunter killed the Major after admitting that he hated Hitler and all his stood for. As the film closed we saw the Captain parachuting out of airplane, long-range rifle on his breast ready to attempt the deed against Hitler-again. Yeah, but what if he had not hesitated that first time. Enough said.",1457308800,,3205,4.59965034965035

3786047,5,B001SMC9L2,"Movie resulted in Congressional hearings because it was, ""pro-British""

A welcome addition to my DVD collection.

Man Hunt became the first war film to attract the attention of the then-neutral America's Hays censorship Office. Joseph Breen was alarmed by the script when he read it in 1941, calling it a ""hate film.""  Yes, Lang did hate Nazis (National Socialists).  Breen felt the isolationist atmosphere of 1941 America, the film showed all Germans as evil, unlike other films showing both good non-Nazi Germans as well as evil National Socialists. ( I don't remember any ""good"" Nazis in Casablanca either! )

Breen insisted that the Germans could not be characterised as so brutal.  The US censorship office would pass the film only if it would ""indicate"" brutality rather than show it.  Therefore, it did not show Thorndike's torture but left it in the mind of the audience.

Darryl F. Zanuck was also worried about Lang's anti-Nazi enthusiasm and banned him from the editing room. However, Lang and his associate Gene Fowler, Jr. secretly edited the film without Zanuck's approval.

Concerned about America's neutrality,  Congressional hearings were making progress about this film. However after December 7, 1941 all investigations concerning the film were dropped.  In light of what we now know about Nazi Germany, it is clear that the producers and director had it about right.

DVD has excellent picture and sound.  Highly recommended.

My only (small) negative comment is the fact that the DVD case is one of those environmentally damaging, thin cases, with holes in it. This case has to be thrown away and replaced with a more substantial one.",1435017600,5,1655,5.104089219330855

3786049,1,B001SMC9L2,"My goodness, the stuff the movie-makers showed in this film in the name of drama stretches the disbelief. I like Walter Pigeon, but in this film he is a walk-on. Supposedly a great white hunter with a lifetime of experience hunting big game, this guy is a complete klunkhead. In this movie, while those who hunt him are hot on his heels, he slams doors, grabs a girl and makes her scream (I guess so the Nazi will know where he is), he goes into  dark, deserted, dead-end places with his pursuer ten steps behind him. and even in the wilderness makes as much noise as a crashing herd of elephants. Yes, I exaggerate. But each of these situations happened in the film, and completely killed any belief in the 'big game hunter'.
As others have noted, the plotline is a bit clunky as well, where, for example, the story jumps from the guy dying in hospital to bailing out from a British bomber over wartime Germany without the pilot's authority.
The other area of disbelief was in casting Pigeon as an aristocratic Englishman, and then putting him into scenes with British actors who could carry the role. Why does Hollywood do that?
BTW, as the Cockney street girl, Joan Bennet was superb.
The problem, as I see it, is in the director's vision of a good story gone wrong. And why did I feel that Pigeon merely mouthed his lines?",1430784000,2,1326,4.5020746887966805

And, actually, the performance by the main characters are good. Roddy McDowell really overacts as the cabin boy--but he's just a kid. But Joan Bennett, who is quite appealing in many ways, seems to cry a lot, and she is treated very patronizingly by the main character. In other words, the film is showing its age in many respects. But it is enjoyable and suspenseful, and definitely worth seeing. Also, the commentary is quite good, pointing out how the director uses shadows, light and dark, and sound to great effect.

3786056,3,B001SMC9L2,"Man Hunt, 1941 film

The movie begins somewhere in Germany before WW II. A man with a rifle walks thru the woods. He aims at a high government official. A guard jumps on him to spoil his shot, and he is captured. His equipment is British. Capt. Alan Thorndike is questioned. Thorndike says it was a ""sporting stalk"". Is this a symbol of English decadence? Thorndike will be set free if he admits he was a government assassin. A refusal means he will be taken away for torture. Will he sign a confession? No. Will they make it look like an accident? The next morning they find the rifle but not Thorndike's body. Dogs are sent to scent his whereabouts. Walking through water kills his scent. A boat searches the lake. Thorndike finds a Danish ship and hides in a closet. It will sail to London with a stowaway. A man watches him leave then signals to other German spies in London. Is he trapped?

Thorndike enters a house for refuge from the men following him. He asks a woman for cash, he can't travel on foot. A taxi cab takes him to his brother's mansion with Jerry Stokes. Who is after him? Can he be extradited to Germany? They know he is there. Jerry brings him ""fish and chips"" to eat. Will Jerry travel with him? She will be safer alone. A watcher releases a messenger pigeon. Thorndike tells Farnsworthy to not believe any report os a ""suicide"", then leaves by the back entrance. He is followed to the train, and afterwards. There is a struggle with a tail. The victim was identified as Thorndike by his passport. The police are looking for a man with a scar on his cheek. Thorndike says goodbye to Jerry. A Bobby separates them. Jerry returns home to find unexpected visitors who want to chat. When ""D. F. Stokes"" arrives at the Lyme Regis Post Office there is a complication. He returns to his hide-out, a cave. The letter carries a threat.

He was followed! He is sealed up as in a grave. They want Thorndike alive, so he can sign a confession ""A lie is relative, as is truth."" He is given the beret owned by Jerry. She refused to talk, and was found dead in the street. The police called it a suicide. They want Thorndike's confession for a ""White Paper"" to justify the war. ""Tomorrow the whole world."" Thorndike improvises a primitive weapon. [Any animal that takes refuge in a cave is trapped.] Is he free at last? Next they show scenes of the start of WW II. Thorndike is in the RAF. He parachutes into Germany with a precision rifle and has a mission to accomplish. [Implausible, given the Gestapo's system of checking on passports etc.]

This movie was derived from Geoffrey Household's novel ""Rogue Male"", who also wrote other best-selling books. I remember the book being better than the movie. This has some implausible scenes about German spies in Britain. ""The Double Cross System"" tells how about the efficient British Secret Service. Every German spy sent into Britain was captured, then doubled, imprisoned, or executed. There were other books as well. They had a ""Most Secret Source"" that provided reliable information. ""The Two-Headed Spy"" movie tells about their cleverness.",1417305600,,3102,4.624319419237749

3786058,5,B001SMC9L2,"There's not more you can say about Fritz Lang that hasn't already been said by film historians and critics over the years and one only has to view Twilight's new Blu-ray of ""Man Hunt""(1941) to confirm that Lang was one of the greatest film makers in the history of cinema. He was there from the beginning starting in the 1920's with such silent masterpieces as ""Metropolis"" and ""Dr. Mabuse""(1927) in which his trademark expressionist style was developed. When he came to America and entered Hollywood's  studio system to direct his first American film, MGM's ""Fury""(1936), he laid the ground work for what would eventually become a new kind of filmmaking called ""noir"" that was not only different than the standard films being made in Hollywood but would shape the careers of future filmmakers for years to come. One of those Lang films was ""Man Hunt"" and thanks to Twilight's new Blu-ray transfer, this little seen film has been given a whole new life. The story is a familiar one for Lang that of a wrongly accused man being chased and tormented by a group of evil men(Nazi's) much in the same way as the main character in ""Ministry of Fear"", another Lang masterpiece. Despite it's being controversial at the time, viewing the film today it's easy to see what Lang was trying to achieve. The look of the film is simply astounding and this is very evident in Twilight's new Blu ray presentation. The cinematography by the great Arthur Miller looks glorious with all the dark shadows and expressive lighting on full display. Contrast and clarity are perfectly balanced with blacks and grays popping off the screen. Although most of the film takes place at night, you can see everything in the picture and there are no vertical lines, dirt, torn frames, or those annoying white specs. 20th Century Fox provided an exceptionally clean print of ""Man Hunt"" and Twilight has given it a high bitrate(34.99) for it's Blu-ray debut that would make Lang proud. The acting in the film is top notch, with Walter Pidgeon as the hunted and tormented character Alan Thorndike and Joan Bennett as the Cockney girl(Jerry Stokes)  who loves him. As good as Pidgeon is as the main character, it's Bennett's performance that holds the film together. An underrated actress, her performance is heartbreaking and will stay with you long after the film is over. The Audio(English 1.0 DTS-HD MA) is also superb with all the gunshots, crowd noise, trains, and even birds singing being crystal clear. ""Man Hunt"" is 102 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH. Special features include an isolated music track by the great Alfred Newman, an Audio Commentary by Patrick McGilligan, and a documentary of the making of ""Man Hunt""(17 minutes). Also included is an informative booklet by film historian Julie Kirgo. The Blu-ray disc itself is housed in a solid standard Blu-ray case. (Note: I would not pay what some sellers are asking for this title. I purchased this directly from Screen Archives Entertainment for a lot less). This is the second Blu-ray that Twilight has released from the films of Fritz Lang (the other being ""The Big Heat"" now sold out) and hopefully we'll see more titles in the future. Until then, ""Man Hunt"" comes highly recommended.",1412380800,5,3270,4.9113924050632916

This region 1 20th Century Fox release knocks the region 2 Optimum Home Entertainment version into a cocked hat. If you have a region-free player, this is definitely the one to get.

And so to the film itself. As propaganda, Man Hunt is very effective. I am not a fan of propaganda film as a rule as I resist the idea of having somebody else ramming their political agenda down my throat. But I accept that there is a time and a place for such material, and a film set on the brink of European War and made just prior to America's entry into the Pacific War would appear to be one of the most miraculous feats of timing ever pulled off by Darryl F. Zanuck, head of 20th Century Fox studio. As the documentary attached to this film points out, Fox took a risk with the film as it was made while America was still at peace and while the Neutrality Act was still in force. Congressional hearings were in motion which questioned the right of films to blatently manipulate public opinion. The Pearl Harbor attack finished all that and the general public flocked in droves to see a film which starts off with Hitler almost being killed by famous big game hunter Captain Alan Thorndike (Walter Pidgeon). The film goes on to chart Thorndike's torture by the gestapo, his escape eventually back to Blighty, his evasion of the Nazi manhunt of the title, his eventual success, resurrection and (following stirring snapshot footage of the war - the Blitz, etc -) his eventual return to Germany, parachuting down, sniper's rifle in hand, to finish off the job against the Fuhrer. All of this had a huge effect on audiences of the time who were quite happy to surrender their usual cynical powers of critical judgement to blatent emotional manipulation at it's crudest. Such is the nature of propaganda I suppose and we can't deny it didn't do its job in 1941 even if it looks rather foolish now.

As a thriller Man Hunt is also very good indeed. One of the reasons for it's success as propaganda is its success in territory where Lang literally out Hitchcocks Hitchcock. As both propaganda and thriller I'd take this over Foreign Correspondent (1940) any day. The basis for the film's success is the marvelous Geoffrey Household 1939 novel Rogue Male which is adapted very skillfully by Dudley Nichols for the screen. Lang and Nichols hit it off very well, probably because they shared similar pre-occupations. They both placed social significance above sentimentality and hatred of the Nazis was a cause for which both were eager to fight. The story is very much a black and white, goodies v baddies / hunter v the hunted scenario which makes for direct, effective drama. Important to the story is the strong characterization of chief Nazi villain Quive-Smith and George Sanders does marvels with his role. Never has 'English' gentlementality seemed so sinister. Playing against him, Walter Pidgeon does a decent job as our hero with the action of the film slipping from the Bavarian forest to a German dock, to the London East End and finally to the Dorset hills. We are treated to a series of exciting set pieces which set the pulses racing - Thorndike's capture and torture, his escape down a river, his avoiding of Mr Jones (a superbly menacing skeletal John Carradine) on the boat and then later on the London Underground, and his navigation of the trecherous East End streets which seem more like the studio Berlin of M (1931) than the real thing. Things all climax with Thorndike trapped in a cave and Quive-Smith baiting him to come out. It's a tense finale fully the equal of Hitchcock's Statue of Liberty climax to Saboteur, shot the following year.

Nichols' script is a model of punchy economy (with only a couple of tension-sapping scenes to distract - the Boys' Own indulging of the boy (Roddy McDowell) on the boat and the attempts at humor where cockney prostitute (Joan Bennett) meets the upper class in Thorndike's uncle's home). Most memorable of all is the customary meticulous mise-en-scene that Lang provides with his cameraman Arthur C. Miller. There is no doubt that Man Hunt looks thoroughly Langian from beginning to end. The film it most resembles is M, another manhunt film. The topographical shots made famous in that film loom large here. Thorndike is forever scurrying down blind alleys, hiding in nooks and crannies, cupboards and rundown apartments. The photography is all noir shadow and light with the most atmospheric stuff saved for the Underground fight with Jones. The final sequence is pure Lang as well, the confrontation between Thorndike and Quive-Smith shot almost entirely from Thorndike's point of view from inside the cave. The sense of persecution, entrapment and paranoia is unmistakable coming from this director. The visuals show Thorndike as being a Beckert, paranoid fear of surveillance never far away. I also like the way Quive-Smith is depicted when Jenny (the Joan Bennett character) finds him in her flat. Shot in dark silhouette he is dressed in black bowler hat and mack as the spitting image of Der Schranker (the chief of the criminal underworld in M). The only difference is Lang's own monocle which glistens menacingly in the half light (no doubt one of Lang's injokes as arguments between him and studio executives were long and loud about his insistence on wearing one). There's even a clever scene after Thorndike murders a Nazi where he says that he's now being hunted by both the Nazis and the British police - a clear echo of M where Beckert is hunted by both the police and the criminal underworld.

However, any further comparison with M only highlights Man Hunt's shortcomings. As thoroughly Langian as the film may look, it just isn't subtle enough thematically. Its complete lack of ambiguity in characterization and its side-stepping of Lang's usual modernist preoccupations makes the film distinctly minor in terms of Lang's overall output. M is marvelous because of its ambiguity. It's hard to decide who are good and who are bad in a film which raises all manner of questions about the modern world and how we look at it. Characters are all subtlety contrasted, mirrored and blended. The head of the underground is the police detective's doppelganger and as Beckert is hunted down we are dazzled by a mise-en-scene which ellucidates the subtlety of Lang's thematic concerns. In Man Hunt, characterisation is one-dimensional with goodies and baddies clearly stereotyped. We are never allowed to question the morality of either, rather we are just ordered (as is the nature of propaganda) to think this and think that. Thus Thorndike is a cartoon superman with no bad points at all while Quive-Smith is a pantomime Disney villain. Sanders does manage to rise above his material, but even a good performance like his can't change what is heavily capitalised and underlined in the script. Joan Bennett as the prostitute who helps our hero in London has an even harder task in a part which the studio, the Hays Office, Dudley Nichols and Lang all fought over (is she a prostitute or a seamstress?) to the point where Bennett is unsettled into giving a strange 'tart with a heart' performance. Her atrocious cockney accent doesn't help either.

So, in Man Hunt we have a very effective thriller, a crowd-pleaser which sends people away thinking America should indeed enter the war. People might even be fooled into thinking it is a real 'Fritz Lang' picture with its strong visual sense. However, enjoyable as the mise-en-scene may be, it's rendered shallow when it supports cartoon character cyphers who exist a million miles away from Lang's usual tortured ambiguity. In top Lang, mise-en-scene supports themes bedded into thematic characterization. In Man Hunt it supports a simple thriller weighed down by propagandistic freight.

I can't understand people who think Man Hunt is Lang's first great American film. That was surely You Only Live Once (1937) with Fury (1936) only fractionally less successful. There are also people who think Lang was on the skids when he made Man Hunt. This wasn't strictly true. You and Me (1938) was his only box office flop up to this point and before Man Hunt he had somewhat rescued his reputation as a reliable director with two successful westerns, The Return of Frank James (1940) and Western Union (1941). Lang didn't have the kind of control he had been accustomed to in Germany, but he certainly wasn't in desperate trouble. The best thing that resulted from the success of Man Hunt was the power it gave Lang to go on to make The Woman in the Window (1944) and Scarlet Street (1945), two films which feature the support of Joan Bennett and (in Scarlet Street) screenwriter Dudley Nichols. These two films represent Lang at the top of his game. Man Hunt (entertaining as it may be) certainly does not do this.",1411430400,2,9324,4.86469477658905

3786071,5,B001SMC9L2,"This first-rate 1941 Fox thriller was the first and best of Fritz Lang's three pseudopropaganda features commenting daringly and sardonically on the European war situation and, specifically, Germany under the Third Reich. Lang never made war pictures (excepting the anomalous AMERICAN GUERRILLA IN THE PHILIPPINES), and the trio are all essentially pre-James Bond espionage cat-and-mouse cliffhangers, with far more depth than the 007 programmers. The companion films are the excellent MINISTRY OF FEAR with Ray Milland and HANGMEN ALSO DIE with Brian Donlevy. MAN HUNT and MINISTRY both have a distinct Hitchcockian feel, with bravura touches of firing-squad wit and gallows humor.

This film was especially topical, hastened into production as Europe darkened and based on the even more topical 1939 UK spydom classic ROGUE MALE by Geoffrey Household, an author who in this work directly influenced Ian Fleming and John Le Carr among many others. The underestimated Canadian actor Walter Pidgeon, lent out from Metro, takes the showy lead as the British sportsman who only wants to take dangerously close potshots at dictators, just targeting and not firing, solely  for the sporting challenge of the chase. Pidgeon rarely played leads, and this is a fine showcase for his reassuringly civilized screen authority and ability to carry a picture. (Pidgeon followers should also check out his Disney charmer BIG RED and his cocaine-sniffing rogue in HARRY IN YOUR POCKET.)  The late great George Sanders is impossibly suave and mellifluous as Pidgeon's Anglophone Nazi nemesis, and the classy Joan Bennett here makes the first of four distinctive appearances for Lang, including the seminal noirs WOMAN IN THE WINDOW and SCARLET STREET.

3786076,4,B001SMC9L2,"Fritz Lang, the great German director, left the country in 1933 as Hitler's Nazi movement was underway.  He eventually made his way to Hollywood, but once there found that he didn't have the recognition or clout he had acquired in Europe.  While still struggling artistically and financially, he made this somewhat controversial film in 1939.  Controversial in that it was quite upfront in its criticism of Hitler's politics.  At that time, the U. S. was officially neutral.  As it turns out, Lang and his writers were quite prophetic.

The story involves Capt. Alan Thorndike (Walter Pidgeon without his mustache), a British big-game hunter roaming around the Bavarian countryside.  We see him apparently stalking, from high brush and from a great distance, a remote compound.  As we look through his telescopic lens with him, we clearly see Adolph Hitler within his sights.  He pulls the trigger.  Click.  Now he loads a shell, but before he can do anything, he's jumped by a German soldier patrolling the area.  Taken before Major Quive-Smith (George Sanders), who appears to be the military/SS/Gestapo man in charge, Thorndike pleads innocent.  The major himself, is a hunter and is quite familiar with Thorndike.  Thorndike says he was ""sport stalking.""  That is just seeing if he could get off a shot.  He doesn't kill for sport any more, even small animals.  He just likes the thrill of the hunt and knowing he could do it.

Quive-Smith seems to buy it and agrees to let Thorndike go if he will sign a confession saying he attempted to kill Hitler with orders from England.  When he refuses, he is tortured but eventually escapes on an England bound freighter.  He's helped along the way by the cabin boy (11 year old Roddy McDowall).  Once in England, he continues to be hunted by the Gestapo and Quive-Smith.  Even his brother and others of influence can't seem to protect him, so Thorndike decides to disappear.  Here he is aided by a young woman named Jerry (Joan Bennett).  In trying to read through the ambiguity of her character, it would seem that if she is not a prostitute, she's just a down on her luck seamstress.  Both occupations are hinted at but it's never clear.

In any case, she is a woman of good heart and falls for Thorndike.  That of course, complicates his escape.  In spite of Lang's heavy layer of propaganda, the film is an effective thriller as the German cut-throats close in on Thorndike.  The movie was released in June of 1941, just 6 months before American officially entered the war.  It holds up well and remains one of Lang's better American films.",1380499200,,2591,4.796380090497737

3786081,3,B001SMC9L2,"Perhaps train wreck is too harsh a characterization of this film, but it's definitely more than a fender bender. Some of the elements that grate today are no doubt linked to the fact that it was made in 1941, with a more-than-deserved anti-Nazism driving director Fritz Lang and wartime sentiment affecting the audience. If I fantasize myself watching this film in the early 40s -- much as I imagine myself being in the 1930s when I read pulp fiction like The Shadow and Doc Savage -- then the movie goes down more easily, though much of the plot is still hard to swallow. Some of these problems have been pointed out by other reviewers. For one thing, there is no sustained sense of a chase or any unrelenting feeling of suspense. The pattern is on-again-off-again: The main character is first pursued but gets away, and then there is a period of short character introduction and development, then another short chase, followed by yet another relatively calm interlude, and so on. And, to be honest, I don't quite understand why the major character doesn't just go straight to the British authorities once he gets back home. Similarly, the final confrontation between hunter and hunted seems ridiculously contrived and strangely timed, and the film's epilogue -- while in keeping with the spirit of the times -- is also quite hard to believe. I don't fault most of the casting, though I agree that Walter Pidgeon makes for a very improbable Englishman. The principal attraction of this film is the photography, which is absolutely magnificent, and the reason I keep my eyes glued to the screen, no matter what kind of cinematic wreck the picture as a whole might be. So expect a muddled and unsatisfying story with some stock characters, but keep watching: The sights are magnificent.",1353283200,,1785,4.855737704918033
3786082,4,B001SMC9L2,"Fritz Lang's ""Man Hunt"" takes you on a suspenseful adventure as you follow the not-always-brilliant protagonist as he tries to escape the clutches of pursuing Nazis.

In ""Man Hunt"" Fritz Lang ably demonstrates how he could out-master Hitchcock with his suspenseful use of camera angles, lighting, and music (even Hitch couldn't make a London street seem scarier!). Alfred Hitchcock however, more readily fit into the Hollywood studio system and its star-based actors than Lang who struggled within its confines. Lang's female characters are more than one-dimensional ice goddesses (a classic Hitchcock shortcoming). Joan Bennett does much with the role of the simple, sympathetic woman who has a will of her own, and note the expressive characterization of the protagonist's sister-in-law, who appears briefly. Hitchcock could have learned much to improve his female characterization from Lang in this respect.

Sadly the last ten minutes of this film seems to have had a war propaganda
message literally tacked onto it -- it really doesn't show any of Lang's masterful imprint at all. Disregard the last ten minutes of this film completely, and you will understand why so many speak so highly of it.

Fritz Lang seemed capable of bringing out the best in his actors, and Walter Pidgeon, Joan Bennett, young Roddy MacDowell, and George Sanders shine in their respective roles. I feel that Sanders never acted better than in this role as a Nazi villain (he did this brilliant piece of acting before he fell into the claws of Hollywood stereotyping -- a real shame to a real talent).

These all involve how Walter Pidgeon's character is portrayed. He is supposed to be the greatest big-game hunter in the world, but he lacks even basic cunning for someone who is supposed to be an expert hunter. For example, after the Nazis have spotted him in London, he continues to wear the nautical hat which stands out like a sore thumb on the street. His overall evasion efforts, even finally holing himself up in a no exit cave seem childish. And speaking of this, his whole attitude is too ""chipper"" throughout. Add to this his almost Asperger syndrome response to Joan Fontaine's obvious advances and it makes his character too shallow. Later, his bug-eyed reactions to the past events as he lays recuperating are too extreme in the other emotional direction. After all this, one is left with the feeling that his one-man assassination mission at the end is a hopeless, delusional overreaction to his finally awakening to reality.",1314316800,3,1158,4.883248730964467
3786088,3,B001SMC9L2,"There are a lot of stylish images - shadows, camera angles, et cetera - in this production but, despite its highly melodramatic storyline, it never achieves suspense.

The next sequences are better, when Joan Bennett's character enters (she makes a surprisingly good job of a Cockney accent, only occasionally slipping in a phoney vowel), but this ushers in the film's romantic theme, which softens the suspense once again. If our hero and heroine actually got into and out of scrapes TOGETHER, then romance and suspense could go hand in hand, but this is not what happens, except for one moment on Waterloo Bridge (the framing is so familiar, one expects Vivian Leigh along any minute). One could go on. For Fritz Lang buffs, this may not matter much. If so, this is an excellent, restored release.

3786090,2,B001SMC9L2,"The attitude ""One shouldn't speak ill of the dead"" seems to inform much of ""classic"" movie criticism, but it's hard not to be massively disappointed by Man Hunt, no matter what Leonard Maltin and his friends might think. Fritz Lang - director of silent colossi such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Metropolis/dp/B0040QYROK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Metropolis</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/M/dp/B00065GX64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">M</a>, manages to show only how much talking can spoil a perfectly good art form.

Parts of Man Hunt are beautifully framed, but they tend to be static scenes: Thorndike and Jerry on a bridge with a trail of street lights  fading into the London fog; a darkly framed underground station wherein a limping German with a black trencher and a cane - a prototype for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Herr-Flick-of-the-Gestapo/dp/B001B3LIQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Herr Flick of the Gestapo</a>&nbsp;if ever there was one - pursues our hero.

Here, I confess, I am scrabbling around for something positive to say. If we forget the artful cinematography, what we are left with is low grade melodrama.

The plot is quite absurd: In 1939, a famous British huntsman Thorndike (Walter Pidgeon, making no attempt at all to affect a British accent) is apprehended in Austria taking aim at Hitler with a high-powered rifle. He is relieved of his passport and ordered to sign a confession that he is an assassin in the employ of her Majesty's Government, which is presumed to be likely to spark an international diplomatic incident (on the eve of Germany's invasion of Poland!).

Absurd enough, but then Thorndike escapes on a ship back to London, thanks to a Roger-the-Cabin-Boy performance from a 10-year-old Roddy McDowall. Losing your prisoner, you would think, would entirely blow the value of any confession. But no, the hun are determined, and pursue Thorndike back to and then around London and its underground and even deep into the delightful Dorsetshire countryside of Lyme Regis.

Along the way Thorndike meets the unfortunately named Jerry, a working girl (Joan Bennett, toting a cockney accent that would have made Dick Van Dyke wince), for whom the film grinds to a halt for thirty minutes to allow Thorndike to gratuitously patronise her, and Jerry to pine winsomely for Thorndike whilst all the while mangling the traditional London dialect to the horror of onlooking rich folk such as Lord and Lady Risborough, who had no apparent function in the screenplay other than to reinforce social stereotypes. Of course, being pre war Britain there's no intimacy, let alone sex, to liven proceedings but amusingly Lang does have Thorndike stretch out suggestively on a couch in Jerry's apartment while a well-placed tower rises magnificently on a sheet behind him, Austin Powers style. Fnarr Fnarr.

Eventually the action gets going again, and we quickly find Thorndike holed up in a muddy cave with a monocle-endowed kraut outside still imploring him to sign the confession (Germany by now having rolled into the Sudetenland, annexed Czechoslovakia and invaded Poland, making the putative diplomatic embarrassment to Her Majesty yet more questionable) and declaring, po-faced, things like ""Today Europe, tomorrow ze WORLD!""  and from there the film rolls to its dramatic, implausible conclusion, backed by the same shrill and melodramatic music which has been assaulting the senses fro the outset.

At the end of the day it is Fritz Lang, so my critical brethren will feel obliged to give Man Hunt the benefit of the doubt (though surely there are limits: bizarrely Time-Out described it as ""bleak, complex and nightmarish"", which if true I missed completely), but it is really hard to see a modern audience of ordinary folk (assuming no interest in this as a cultural artefact) having much time for this at all. You would hardly say that of Metropolis.

Indeed, if ever there were an demonstration of precisely what cinema lost when it added sound, then watching this back to back with Metropolis would make alles klar.

3786092,2,B001SMC9L2,"Man Hunt is considered one of Fritz Lang's best films and an example of great film noir. I'm not so sure it is film noir nor am I sure it's one of Lang's best. The 1941 film stars Walter Pigeon and Joan Bennett, the third time the pair co-starred. Pigeon is best known for the dozen or so films he made with Greer Garson, two of which (e.g., ""Mrs. Miniver"", ""Madame Curie"") earned him Oscar nominations. I remember him best as the villain in ""Dark Command"" (1940) opposite John Wayne and as the scientist in ""Forbidden Planet"" (1956).

Joan Bennett is at her perky best in this film, the first of several she made with Fritz Lang. Indeed, she and Lang formed a production company together, making such memorable films as ""Woman in the Window"" (1944) and ""Scarlett Street"" (1945), both of them with Edward G Robinson. It's hard to believe such a talented woman is not as well remembered as she is.

Lang was one of the fathers of film noir and was called the ""Master of Darkness"". More than anyone else he popularized the German school of expressionist film, with ""Dr. Mabuse"" (1922),  ""Metropolis"" (1927) and  ""M"" (1931). Though he wasn't a Jew, Lang fled German in 1934 when the Nazis took over. He eventually came to the U.S. where he made such notable films as ""Fury"" (1936), ""The Return of Frank James"" (1940), and ""Western Union"" (1940).  Lang was delighted to make anti-Nazi films, but in 1941 Germany was a good customer for the American film market, so the issue was a delicate one.

The film has a good supporting cast with George Sanders as an obsessed German major, John Carradine as a spy, and Roddy McDowall as a cabin boy.

Lang's photography is exceptional, but there are long pauses in the action that lead to boredom. Without Joan Bennett's perky cockney presence, the film would be deadly dull. There are also long periods of complete silence, and this too appears to be a major fault, although one can understand it from Lang's long history making silent films. On other occasions the music is clearly intrusive, even though it is scored by Oscar winning composer Alfred Newman who usually does a great job (e.g., ""Camelot"", ""The King and I"", ""With a Song in my Heart"").

Appearing before the U.S. entry into the war, but after the war in Europe was already in progress, the film has many anti Nazi sentiments. The idea that a famous big game hunter was loose in Germany stalking Hitler did give some solace to people in 1941, although in retrospect it seems a little silly.

Another silly aspect of the film is Pigeon's behavior once he arrives in London. He is afraid of every shadow. He runs away from puny little German guys half his size, and a fat old man who can barely walk sends Pigeon dashing into the shadows. Here's this ""big game hunter"", a strappingly large man who is bigger than any of his trackers. Lean John Carradine sends Pigeon scampering down 2 flights of stairs. What's up with this? It just doesn't make sense and dramatically looks silly. Perhaps there is a metaphor here, that the ""strong"" Allies really don't need to fear the ""puny"" Axis powers, but if so, it was lost on me while watching the film.

Of course, a Fritz Lang film is always worth viewing and this film particularly shows off some of his more subtle photographic techniques. And Joan Bennett is always worth watching and she does a great job here.",1282348800,3,3358,4.6003344481605355

Still, despite a few too many yawns, the movie is clearly Lang's. There are some wonderful night scenes, dramatically lit, and the scene in the London tube station is gripping. Bottom line: This is worth checking out as a rarely seen Lang film, but my advice is don't expect too much. Best is to run, don't walk, to read the book.

(1941)
-----------------------
Like the more famous ""Casablanca,"" director Fritz Lang's ""Manhunt"" belongs to that brief Hollywood sub-genre of anti-Nazi political films released before the American entry into World War Two. At the time, American politics were still in the throes of anti-interventionist isolationism, and an unwillingness to enter into the violent conflict overseas. Lang, of course, had a stake in the fight -- unwilling to submit to Nazi authority, he had fled Germany several years before and reestablished his career elsewhere. Like ""Casablanca,"" the on-screen brutality of the Hollywood Nazis seems tame compared to the horrific genocidal sadism later revealed in the real-world of Nazi-dominated Europe.

The film's hero, a gallant English adventurer played by Walter Pidgeon, is roughed up by the krauts, and later hunted through the streets of London by a German hit squad sent to silence him, but the level of violence isn't that far from the gangster films of the era. The politics become less pointed as the film goes on -- the plot becomes more about the hunt and less about the Germans; also, Pidgeon meets a young girl who helps him and as they fall in love the movie becomes focussed on their relationship and the class differences between the working class girl and the debonnaire (but cheerfully un-snobby) hero. The film becomes decidedly more and more ""English,"" and slows to the pace of British films of the time, less thrilling and more cerebral. Still, it's a nice document of its time, and a fine opportunity to fill out one's understanding of Fritz Lang's ouvre. Definitely worth checking out, although a little flat towards the end.

3786101,1,B001SMC9L2,"Preposterous twaddle executed in a bewilderingly amateurish and inept way -- or perhaps several since the incredible lack of continuity, tone, realism, plausibility, suspense, and much more combine with Walter Pidgeon's bovine attempts at charm to produce a cinema curiosity to rank with some of Fritz Lang's other stupendous failures. (I thought the German ambassador was actually played by Lang but apparently not -- they could have been twins.) If you cannot predict the ending from several timezones away, you are not actually alive.

I was eagerly awaiting this DVD and was totally surprised and disappointed by such dire crap (even with George Sanders and John Carradine -- maybe I can wash my mind out by watching Viaggio in Italia instead and for the umpteenth time).

3786103,4,B001SMC9L2,"MAN HUNT (1941) has one of the most unforgettable opening sequences in movie history.

The year is 1939.  Renowned British big game hunter Walter Pidgeon moves quietly, swiftly through a Bavarian forest, avoiding sentries.  Soon, he reaches the edge of a cliff, assembles his long-range rifle and takes careful aim at his prey.

In his cross-hairs is Adolph Hitler.

Naturally, Pidgeon is thwarted before he can pull the trigger.  He is beaten and taken before Gestapo leader George Sanders, who promises him freedom if he will confess to being an assassin, sent to kill Hitler for the British Government.

Almost by accident, Pidgeon escapes and is able to make his way back to England.  He is followed by Sanders and several of his henchmen, including John Carradine, who still want him to sign the false confession that will embarrass the Brits and put the country in a difficult political position.

One of the few people willing to help Pidgeon is Joan Bennett, a ""street waif"".  [She was probably really a prostitute, but that would go against the strict 1941 Production Code.]

Adapted from a novel by Geoffrey Household and directed by Fritz Lang, MAN HUNT is a taut thriller that plays like an urban version of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME.  It is filled with the director's signature images of foreboding dark corners and shadowy streets.

The sharp black-and-white release from 20th Century-Fox Home Entertainment has audio commentary by author Patrick McGilligan and a ""Making of"" featurette.

While the movie was quite good, and Lang's direction was excellent, my enjoyment of the film was greatly reduced by Walter Pidgeon as the lead. His performance is just stiff and unconvincing. Worse, like Tyrone Power and Kevin Costner, he makes no attempt at an English, or even mid-Atlantic, accent, which made it impossible to accept him as a British aristocrat. (For similar reasons, I also hate Pidgeon's performance in How Green Was My Valley, though his part was small enough there not to ruin this classic.). I also disliked his character's condescending attitude to the Joan Bennett character; it would be interesting to know whether that choice was Lang's or Pidgeon's.

3786108,5,B001SMC9L2,"Long before Tom Cruise decided to take on tale of VALKYRIE,  a movie was made concerning the same subject, the assassination of Adolf Hitler. With the release of Cruise' film to DVD, this movie now comes out of the vault and makes its way to homes as well. The film is called MAN HUNT.

Walter Pidgeon stars Capt. Alan Thorndike, a retired British officer and big time game hunter on vacation in Germany. As the film opens, Thorndike is perched on a hill overlooking the secret headquarters of Hitler along with a pair of binoculars and a high powered hunting rifle with the best of scopes attached. Getting Hitler in his sights is easy and he pulls the trigger only to hear the click of the gun. This was an exercise in skills, not an actual killing.

But for some reason Thorndike isn't satisfied. He inserts a bullet and takes aim once more. His chance to kill Hitler has passed though as he is captured before he can act by a guard patrolling the grounds.

Taken prisoner, Thorndike is brought before the chief interrogator Quive-Smith (George Sanders). It seems that Quive-Smith is a big game hunter as well and recognizes Thorndike. During questioning, Thorndike insists that he was simply performing an exercise, just trying to see if he could accomplish this goal without following through. Not believing this news, Quive-Smith has him tortured. Quive-Smith offers him a last chance. He will release him to return to England as long as he signs a confession that he was sent there by the British to perform the task of killing Adolf Hitler. When he refuses, Thorndike is taken to the woods and dropped off a cliff with the intent to make it seem he fell to his death.

Except that luck was with Thorndike. He was caught on a branch and though wounded, was able to escape. Making his way to the docks, he sneaks aboard a vessel headed for England and with the help of a young cabin boy (played by a young Roddy McDowell), he reaches home, but not safety.

It seems that the Germans are set on getting their confession. Their agents have been aboard the boat as well. And they now wait to capture Thorndike on his home turf. After a shot chase, Thorndike is aided by a young woman named Jerry Stokes (Joan Bennett). Untrusting at first, she helps him get to his brother and then aides him as he tries to flee the country. But the Germans are always one step behind and getting closer to capture.

The movie makes for not only a great mystery but a great adventure film as well as Pidgeon's Thorndike moves from one predicament to another as he avoids capture. Each time he moves himself from danger, he puts those he cares for in the middle of it. Determined to use his test of skill to show British involvement, the Nazi's don't give up easily. And should they get their confession, an excuse to launch an attack on England is in their hands.

This movie has been praised by many who recall first seeing it on late night television as a long lost classic. Having found it that way myself many years ago I would have to agree. Simple in it's telling, it still has a profound effect when you consider the subject matter. What if someone had taken that shot and killed Hitler before he had the chance to subject the world to his madness?

Perhaps that is the major theme that the films director, Fritz Lang, was trying to express here. The German born director of films such as M and METROPOLIS was fortunate enough to have escaped Germany before his anti-Nazi sympathies could do him in. Perhaps this film was his way of hoping for a different world for the one he was born in.

In any event, Lang has offered us a tremendous thriller that holds your interest throughout. The performances are well done for the time and the story, while for some a bit unbelievable, is done in such a way as to make it possible.

This is one man attempting to take down Hitler as opposed to the German generals of VALKYRIE working together with civilians. But it holds just as powerful a story as well.

Managing to escape, he has a stroke of luck in finding a comely young boy (Roddy McDowall) who invites him on a sea voyage - but advises him to stay in the closet!
