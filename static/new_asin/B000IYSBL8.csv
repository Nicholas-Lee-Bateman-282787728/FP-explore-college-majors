8147795,3,B000IYSBL8,"I was a little disappointed in this DVD.  There is poetry being recited all the time, but there is no indication (vocally or written) as to what the poem's name is and who the poet is.  I find that very annoying and not very educational; it would be nice to have this information displayed or spoken before each poem is recited.  I therefore prefer other poetry DVDs available for children.  The photography/video, however, is really nice on this DVD.",1456185600,,451,4.670886075949367
8147796,5,B000IYSBL8,"Free of junk food, junk culture, or marketing tie-ins, this lovely video is a surprisingly engaging work.  The poetry is read by children and accompanied by contemporary, fun music that adults will actually like to listen to as well.  I bought several copies after borrowing it from the Boulder Public Library.",1223683200,,310,5.0588235294117645
8147797,5,B000IYSBL8,"Escape from all the commercial brands and come back to the real world.  This video is great, it's well done.  Our toddler loves to watch it and dance to the music.  I know she'll be watching it for years to come.  Poems come alive when they're read out loud.  Words show on the screen while the various poems are read to music and video.  It's engaging, entertaining and educational all at the same time.",1189209600,,404,4.391891891891892
8147798,5,B000IYSBL8,"My children, ages 5 & 8, truly enjoyed the Flower Child DVD. When asked why, they couldn't really identify it.

""I liked the pictures,"" my artistic-tending daughter stated. My son, 5, just smiled. It held their attention the whole time. The lighting was soft, unlike the more crass and vibrant pictures seen on more commercial children's television. While my son concentrated on the numbers, my daughter mimicked the movements during the 1-10 segment. I especially liked that piece. It was reminiscent of Sesame Street.

Flower Child DVD is a cross between Sesame Street and Emily Dickenson. It
enraptures the child view through the rhythm of its poetry and the rhythm of their everyday lives. They can identify with the everyday things the kids in the video are doing. What a great way to bring poetry closer to children's lives. It is children's entertainment at its best.
