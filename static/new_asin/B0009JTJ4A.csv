If you are a casualy fan, you may think it is not worth spending $50 for something that isn't long at all. If you are fan obsessed, love the band to death and have the money to spend, then this is way worth getting! I bought it and am glad I did. The only downer is that it is the concert version video for the song Obscure. I would rather have the real video. Oh well.",1248998400,,515,3.9615384615384617
8062079,5,B0009JTJ4A,"Average Fury is an excellent compliation of music videos from all of the fan's favorite songs including Child Prey, Drain Away, The Final, and Saku, among others. It's excellent quality, and also has a 'Making of' section for each of the videos, which is priceless for those who are interested in seeing how the Dir en Grey magic happens.

That being said, I would only recomend you spend $50 or more on it if you are a collector, or a real big fan. It honestly doesn't offer much for the price. After an hour you'll have seen everything there is to see. I recomend going to a store that specializes in J-Rock music and trying to procure a copy through them, as it is signifficantly cheaper. I found my copy in the bargain bin of a pawn shop for about $10.

In conclusion, its a great DVD, especially for those who have a rabid obsession with the band, but unless you're looking to pay a collecter's item price for it, it's probably best to shop around for a copy.",1209772800,2,964,4.379888268156424
