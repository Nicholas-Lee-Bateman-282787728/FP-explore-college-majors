8764058,5,B01GWDG5GQ,"""Deathly Hallows Part 2"" brings the Harry Potter saga full circle, as he and Voldemort come, at long last, to their final confrontation. Getting there won't be simple. Voldemort and his evil horde will lay siege to Hogwarts, gamely defended by its students and masters to the bitter end. Meanwhile, Harry, Hermione, and Ron seek the last of the horcruxes that protect the Dark Lord. Harry will learn the truth of his mother's death, and that truth will reveal the road to his final sacrifice....

The finale is a great show, full of sound, power, and emotion, the comradeship of the students, and finally, the unbreakable bonds that have carried Harry, Hermione, and Ron through so much danger. The ending is worthy of their saga. The final scene provides a bit of closure, nineteen years into the future, as another generation of children prepare to enter Hogwarts. Very highly recommended to fans of the series.",1490918400,,913,4.890322580645162
