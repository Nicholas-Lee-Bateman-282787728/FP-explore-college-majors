strongly recommended for anyone seriously interested in wrestling!",1223424000,,410,5.134328358208955
7956505,3,B00005Y6ZN,"Let me tell you something Brother! This DvD ain't bad for people who like solid wrestling, the matches are all average, no great matches here. No real big names, biggest is probably Kane unmasked. Save your money for a real DVD like Wrestlemania 17, Wrestlemania 18, My good friend Triple H's DvD, and even my 2 Disc DvD which comes out in a few weeks. Nobody cares about Smokey Mountain Wrestling, it's dead, it's gone, much unlike Hulkamania who is Here,Alive!, and still kickin [behind] in 2002! Keep it real Brothers!",1028160000,2,521,4.736263736263736
7956506,4,B00005Y6ZN,"""Before They Were Famous"" is a lot of fun to watch. The premise is simple - the DVD is a collection of matches from the now defunct Smoky Mountain Wrestling promotion of the early-mid 90s, featuring wrestlers who went on to greater fame working for the WWF, WCW and/or ECW. It's funny, even though these matches aren't from all that long ago (the oldest match on the collection is about 10 years old) it is amazing how many of these wrestlers are practically unrecognizable in comparison to their current persona. You get to see Hardcore Holly in his ""Hollywood"" Bob Holly gimmick, with long hair and a much smaller body, Tazz in his original ""Tazmaniac"" gimmick, where he wrestled as a wild jungle boy, and Balls Mahoney as the dim-witted ""Boo Bradley"". Also funny was seeing Lance Storm, who has become so great in a heel role, playing a pretty boy, sincere babyface. Glen Jacobs, who went on to huge fame as Kane in the WWF is shown unmasked as ""Unabom"". I had forgotten what an uncanny resemblance to Sid Vicious (the wrestler, not the Sex Pistol) he has. New Jack, the Headbangers, Chris Jericho, Tammy Sytch (pre-Sunny), Hugh Morrus as Crash The Terminator, Chris Kanyon as a jobber, D. Lo Brown about 100 pounds heavier than he is now, Road Dogg under a mask as the Dark Secret, pre-""Head"" Al Snow, the late Louie Spicolli and several others are also featured on the DVD. Really, the only downside to the collection is that a lot of the matches are more or less squash matches, since the focus of the DVD is highlighting wrestlers who went on to become big names in the industry, not on showing the best possible matches (though I understand that a Best of Smoky Mountain Wrestling DVD is the next wrestling DVD to be released from Kit Parker Films).
Similar to the previous Kit Parker DVD collection, ""Wrestling Gold"", this DVD also features insider commentary from Dave Meltzer and Jim Cornette. Since Cornette ran Smoky Mountain Wrestling, there is nobody better to provide behinds the scenes stories from the territory. One of the funniest stories he told was how Bob Holly actually quit Smoky Mountain Wrestling because he was making better money as a welder. I'm actually very surprised there hasn't been more of a buzz about this DVD amongst wrestling fans. It is definitely worth buying.",1024012800,5,2302,4.7288557213930345
7956507,4,B00005Y6ZN,"This as much fun as you will get watching wrestling these days.  All the matches feature wrestlers who went on to be stars in either WCW or the WWF after their stint with SMW.  Even for me who had some of thoses matches on tape it is a great compilation for the era.  I wish they would have chosen better matches as most are ""jobbers"" matches but still a lot of fun.  I guess the  big card will be release as a unit like Night of the Legends.  I hope they will continue with their great second track commentary by Jim Cornette and Dave Meltzer.  It really make the difference between a good and great product.  A must for the real wrestling fans or if you are a fan of one of the wrestlers feature on this great DVD.",1020297600,3,716,4.100719424460432

THE DVD SPECIAL FEATURES:
This is an awesome DVD.  The features are limited in number but high in quality.
1. Bios for Chris Kanyon, Chris Jericho, and Lance Storm. Great rundown of the careers of each man.  Good information
2. ""OPTIONAL INSIDER COMMENTARY"" by Dave Meltzer and Jim Cornette.  Unlike the VHS version, the DVD has a special audio track with commentary by these two well-respected men in the wrestling industry that the viewer can listen to in lieu of the original audio tracks of each match.  It's a fascinating listen/insight into the business.  You'll learn a GREAT deal about the history of the business and the stories behind the wrestlers.  Also, many of the anecdotes that Cornette shares are PRICELESS.
THE VERDICT:
Overall, this is a GREAT DVD if you are into old-school wrestling.  The actions and matches on this are decent to great. You'll get to see many of the today's stars back in their rookie days as well as some of the older stars from yesterday. If you are a wrestling nostalgist THIS IS FOR YOU. Plus, you'll learn a great deal about wrestling history through the ""Insider Commentary.""  It's a fascinating listen.
Highly Recommended",1019865600,14,5816,4.7896865520728005
