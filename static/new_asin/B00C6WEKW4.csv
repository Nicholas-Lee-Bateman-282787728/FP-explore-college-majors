8577848,4,B00C6WEKW4,"Fun movie that I think played on the SyFy Channel years back.  But for some reason, this movie is not available to buy here in the U.S.  You have to have an all region player to play this as of 2016.  Not the best movie out there, but if you are in the mood for some SyFy movie cheese... this will do.  Very fun film.",1431820800,4,317,3.830769230769231

8577852,5,B00C6WEKW4,I watched this on the Syfy channel in HD.  It's a pretty go B movie. I give it 5 stars for the storyline and the clarity of the dvd. Not to sound gross but the kills by the piranhaconda(s) were hilarious.,1424304000,,204,3.975609756097561

8577854,5,B00C6WEKW4,"love this old skool style low budget monster flick. this one starts Mike Madsen who starred in Reservoir Dogs. A lot of carnage courtesy of a big-@ss anaconda snake/ piranhna mutant. lots of swim suited big booby gals, fat dudes, drug lord/terrorist types makin a smorgasbord of fun and meals for mean ol mista PIRANHNACONDA!",1407196800,,325,4.927272727272728
8577855,2,B00C6WEKW4,"SyFy teams up with Roger Corman to bring us a TV14 bikini/ cleavage cheese fest. Michael Madsen is the smart guy in the movie.

On an island in Hawaii tourists, criminals, a movie set, botanists, and Madsen fight an impossible combination of a creature who is native to the Amazon.

The snake is computer generated and as bad as the acting. Kills are finalized with a blood mist spray.

The sound track was good as it was something I would expect from ""Pulp Fiction.""",1368316800,,467,4.535714285714286
