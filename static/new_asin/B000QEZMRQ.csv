8325641,5,B000QEZMRQ,"Monique Raymond (Florence Giorgetti), a woman traumatized by her mother's brutal death, falls in love with the bi-sexual artist Richard Lewis (played by the unknown John Ferris) and gets drawn into a gay underworld of leather men and cruising areas. After finding out that her lover betrays her with a man, Monique loses all grip on reality. Set in a pre-AIDS night world of gay Manhattan, French director Jacques Scandelari offers an extremely bleak vision of New York in the illustrious seventies. Dark alleys, pimps, freaks, perverts... yes, pre-Giuliani Manhattan was rotten to the core. A dangerous place. But it was also vibrant, alive. You could watch movies all day and night for cheap. How I loved it back then! I would prefer those hookers and shady types to the hideous hordes of tourists today. ""Monique"" is a small, interesting low-budget film that mostly serves as a nostalgia trip, but also convinces by the grimness, its nihilistic point-of-view. French actress Florence Giorgetti (you may recognize her from ""La Grande Bouffe"") gives an amazing performance here. And for ""Edge of Night"" fans, there is a small cameo appearance by 'Police Chief Derek Mallory' better known as Dennis Parker, here pushing his disco career with the Jacques 'Village People' Morali produced ""Like an Eagle"".",1343174400,,1303,5.150943396226415
