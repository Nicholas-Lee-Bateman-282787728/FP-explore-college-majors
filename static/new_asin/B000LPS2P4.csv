2711983,5,B000LPS2P4,"Dave Mustaine is Megadeth! That One Night ""Live In Buenos Aires"" is an awesome concert for Megadeth fans. The DVD itself is a bare bones release from Image Entertainment. The video transfer presented in it's 1.78:1 widescreen aspect ratio is excellent. The DTS and 5.1 Dolby Digital surround sound of this concert is outstanding to say the least. The band rips through all 18 songs, one after another and their playing is crisp and precise. The crowd is into the concert right from the beginning and the band doesn't disappoint them. There isn't a lot of movement on stage from the band, but Megadeth fans should appreciate the overall quality of this 2005 live concert from Buenos Aries Argentina. DVD tracks included are listed below:

1. Introduction

2711984,4,B000LPS2P4,"Does it get any better?, probably not!
Megadeth have always been my favorite metal band that's name starts with the letter M. Why?, because they write great songs period. Even when things were getting a little iffy, they were still a thousand times better than that other band who's name starts with the letter M.
This DVD proves that they are back and that Dave has again put together yet another kick as band. This DVD has a great selection of tunes as new and old are well represented here. The video production and sound quality are very good as well.
If I was to [...] about anything from this offering it would be that it seems to be missing to much of the before, during the set and after the show stuff. It just sorts of starts off and rips right along and then ends? I would have liked a little more of the other stuff added in just to give it more feel so to speak. It's a very good DVD and listen for sure, but it's missing some feel to it by how it was edited.
Still worth the price of admission though.",1173830400,,1015,4.183673469387755
2711985,5,B000LPS2P4,"Mustaine came through, just when you thougt megadeth was on the brink of not existing with the departure of co-founder Dave Elfson, Mustaine pulled together a great group of performers and Released the System has Failed, a great album. Now, Live in Buenos Aries captures this new encarnation of Megadeth, and does it well. I have seen the group 3 times now, and this DVD does a great job at capturing the live performance.  This album pulls some classics, but also bring us up to the newest album.  Much better than Rude Awakenings production and sound, although the set list for rude awakening was nice, this DVD's mixing and production are 10 times better. The CD should be awesome as well. Check this one out, a Rattlehead must have.",1173657600,2,736,4.6976744186046515
2711986,3,B000LPS2P4,"I was very excited to see this and was let down. The worst part about this dvd (which I was expecting to be the best) is the mix. Presented in DTS the mix is horrible. First off Dave vocals are in stereo and not in the center channel where it should be. When I watch a live concert dvd it only makes sense to have the singing right in front of you blowing you away. This is not the case for 'That One Night'. If you listen it is the drummers kit that is in the center....lame. Don't know how or why it is like this but it is. Second as the dvd progresses on it seems like Drover(drummer) is tripping over the kit and not hitting the drums at the right time.......I know this sounds crazy ..but that is what I hear. And it gets worse later on. Was there a problem? The band (at times) almost don't sound like the are all synced together........very deppressing. Back to the mix........there is no high end on his kit either. Where are the cymbals? And the guitars aren't much better. Not very clean sounding at all, no distinction between the two. Well other than that the performance is decent enough even though some songs are played to fast. And Drover(guitar) does a good job pulling off the solos. Many heart felt moments here and there and the setlist has many great choices. So all in all the footage and performance are good and the dvd flat out sucks.................just watch NIN's 'Beside You In Time' and you'll hear the difference!",1173225600,11,1444,4.391791044776119
2711987,5,B000LPS2P4,"This is a great DVD.  Nice editing, does not jump around a bunch, like other live band dvd's (see iron maiden's last few), and it really captures the live show of megadeth.  The Drover brothers are excellent in their new positions.  As compared to the Rude Awakening DVD, the sound quality here is better, much better mix of vocals and instruments, with just a hint of crowd.  Rude Awakening had a broad and excellent setlist, but this one brings us up through The System Has Failed, and adds the bonus track ""Coming Home"", previously only available on the japanese version of ""The World Needs A Hero"", but it is modified a bit to fit Argentina.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone, go out and get it.  I can not wait for the CD of this set, and am awaiting ""United Abominations"" on the Horizon.  This is a solid line up that should produce a heck of an album.",1173139200,4,863,4.389937106918239
2711988,5,B000LPS2P4,"This DVD rocks!!!First off Mustaine's voice is stellar. Way more consistent then on the Rude Awakening DVD.I love the setlist. The opening song ""Blackmail the Universe"" slays. My only disappointment was that they didn't have the pyrotechnic show that they had when I saw them live in Holmdel, NJ.But Mustaine is at the top of his game the band is tight and its great to see the fans go nuts and show them the respect they deserve.",1173139200,6,430,4.597402597402597
2711989,5,B000LPS2P4,"Recorded right after the end of Gigantour 1 in Buenos Aires, Argentina on October 9, 2005. This is it kids, the ultimate Megadeth show! Megadeth are worshipped in Argentina and they played one night outside in front of a sea of fans. The show is presented in widescreen and DTS sound, features occasional split screens and constant head banging 'Deth songs. The set is awesome and contains 18 songs (including a rare performance of ""I'll Be There""). It took me back to when I saw them for Gigantour in Sept. 2005 and 2006 in Montreal.

This is my favorite lineup since Mustaine, Friedman, Ellefson and Menza. Megadeth is half Canadian now because of the Drover brothers. This was before Dave enlisted the services of James LoMenzo (Black Label Society) as permanent bassist; James MacDonough (Iced Earth) played bass for the duration of the first Gigantour and for this show. Dave's vocals and mood are in great form, shredding along to songs covering most of their catalogue. My only gripe is that the show isn't shown in its entirety; I clearly remember Dave posting on the Megadeth forum saying that they'd perform 22 songs; where are the four missing?

As far as bonus features go; it's very slim. We're treated to alternate angles of ""Symphony of Destruction"" and that's all folks. Every now and then during the concert, we get snippets of Dave and Glen playing acoustic guitar surrounded by fans in Argentina; it would've been fun to see and hear more of that. Maybe a few videos from ""The System Has Failed"" would've been nice too (""Die Dead Enough"" and ""Of Mice and Men"" come to mind) since there weren't any on the ""Arsenal of Megadeth"" DVD set. Anyhow, this is a great DVD; better than ""Rude Awaekning"" although Rude has more songs and that bonus underground B&W show. Get your hands on this, you won't regret it.",1173139200,26,1823,4.729559748427673
2711990,4,B000LPS2P4,"Anyone who's wandering wether to buy this DVD or not, should look for a preview of ""Symphony of destruction"" that's on youtube or around the web. After hearing it, you will see why it's not a clone of the previouss releases.

Anyhow i'm very dissapointed that it did not include the hole set. I can't recall right now, but at least 3 or 4 extra songs were played that night that are not on the DVD list. This includes Skin O' My Teeth and The Scorpion.

Either way, it's a must have for anyone who's been there or to anyone who hasn't heard the Argentinian Crowd",1173139200,4,562,4.2924528301886795
2711991,3,B000LPS2P4,"..with hypnotad. With the catalogue that Megadeth has,its a pity they keep churning out DVDs with the same set of songs. Its a purely commercial move -to churn out a dvd with their commercial hits,but they are not thinking of their fans who would want somehting different for their collection. Does anybody know if Gigantour 2 is going to be on DVD..Now thats one lineup Im waiting to catch on DVD.Btw,the drummer on ""Rude Awakening"" was Jimmy Degrasso and if you found him lame and clunky - pls go back and watch She Wolf on that DVD again.",1172361600,,541,4.530612244897959
2711992,3,B000LPS2P4,"Ok this is not a literal review of this DVD - though I did see virtually the same set list with 4 more tracks from the System Has Failed at another concert - more of a statement of dissatisfaction with music DVD's and the lack of thought bands put into them, in which this is an example.

I just don't understand what the hell most bands think (they probably don't) when it comes to making music DVD's. They seem to either release a disk that doesn't cover enough of their older (and usaully better) material and flog half a dozen tracks off their latest album or they have already released one DVD (more than likely like the one previously mentioned) and release another one which has the same track listing as the old one, with half a dozen new tracks off their latest album...Yes Dave Mustaine this means you.

Ok, in this case there are a dozen songs which are mandatory from the Megadeth library...and I would not like to see them removed - and some of the new tracks off The System Has Failed are worthy of permanent inclusion, but there was a great opportunity to play some other Megadeth classics here...Take No Prisoners, Liar, Mary Jane, Rust In Peace...Polaris, The Conjuring, Skin o My Teeth, Crush 'Em (just kidding)and skip some of the tracks which are already available on the excellent Rude Awakening DVD. Oh and ""I'll Be There"" is pure cheese!

Since this concert/set-list Megadeth have retoured with Gigantour and their Gigantour set was awesome to say the least and far heavier and old school focused than this is. That song variety I previously mentioned was present too. Shame it wasn't recorded instead of this.

Is this DVD worth purchasing for 6 different songs that aren't on Rude Awakening? Grudgingly yes, but it would have been way better with 12 different songs most of which totally shred.",1170028800,7,1819,4.675
2712023,5,B000LPS2P4,One of the most underrated bands. Excellent live show and sound. Camera angles make you feel like you are on stage wiggth the band.,1388448000,,131,4.5
2712024,5,B000LPS2P4,one of the best rock and metal videos of all time. definately recommend especially if your are a megadeth fan its a must own.,1386028800,,125,4.25

2712026,5,B000LPS2P4,"Awesome live job by Megadeth, crowd is really into it. Well worth having in your collection. Great song list, some of their best songs.",1363996800,,135,4.666666666666667
2712027,5,B000LPS2P4,The crowd makes this dvd what it is. South American fans are always as equally a part of the show as the artist. Great set list and Dave is on his game.,1354147200,,152,3.78125
2712028,5,B000LPS2P4,"Megadeth's That One Night: Live In Buenos Aires is arguably the band's finest live effort and certainly one of their best DVDs. The band are absolutely on fire in terms of performance and energy, the crowd are going wild for the band and the setlist is superb, what more could anyone ask for in a concert ?

In terms of the actual DVD; the Audio/Visual quality is top notch and the whole performance is captured well, with a good job made of the mixing, camerawork and editing. Everything is utterly professional and well handled, nothing is cheesy or over the top which just allows the music to do the talking.

Surprisingly; apart from frontman Dave Mustaine, even though the band's line up at the time didn't feature any musician responsible for the albums from Rust In Peace - Cryptic Writings, or indeed David Ellefson who was on every single Megadeth album until The System has Failed, the band put down a storming performance and seem to be at the top of their game, reveling in their success and fired on by the manic crowd.

(Then) New members Glen Drover on guitar, James MacDonough on Bass and on Shawn Drover on Drums are all great additions to the band, and it isn't difficult to see why Glen lasted another studio album and Shawn remains with the band to this day.

The concert includes all the classic Megadeth material you would expect like `Peace Sells...,' `Holy Wars... The Punishment Due,' `Symphony Of Destruction,' and `In My Darkest Hour,' as well as some less played numbers such as `I'll Be There,' and the superb `Set The World Afire.'

Additionally, their then new The System Has Failed record is well represented and the songs fit well into the set along side all the fan favourites.

That One Night' was filmed in 2005 and released in 2007 and is still a brilliant live document and perhaps unsurpassed by later releases. I remember being hugely impressed with it when it was new, and watching it back now my opinion has not changed at all, which is surely a good sign. All Megadeth fans should all consider picking up a copy, this is an utterly fantastic concert and would serve as a fine introduction to the band. I highly recommend it.",1315526400,2,2167,4.630208333333333
2712029,4,B000LPS2P4,"I bought this DVD especially to see the changed line up of Megadeth. Glen Drover doesnt disappoint showcasing his blistering skills. (Too bad that Eidolon failed). The concert content is great and I don't really care what was left out of the set. They played all numbers that would make your heart swell up and give you goose bumps. the DVD has exceptional clarity and as some one writes, this is a HD recording converted to standard format and there is a different sparkle to video. I watch it on a 12 X 8 projection screen in my HT and its movie quality. The mix is super tight and the guitars are well balanced, you can hear each note every one plays all through out. This video is a piece to put in your collection. For me the biggest charm was seeing Mustain 25 years down the line and still rocking so hard with the respect of the fans. Ofcourse not all things are perfect and I will leave 1 star for some additional backstage content / interviews leading to this show.. I think that would have been just nice. Never the less, I love this DVD and worth the price I paid for it.",1309132800,,1083,4.287804878048781
2712030,4,B000LPS2P4,"I agree with comments of other 5* and 4* reviewers, but I must give this DVD 3.5 stars. Why the 1-1/2 stars lesser? Because Megadeth do NOT kick ass hard enough. Nope, they don't.

Though songs are played to perfection, it lacks the bite of Megadeth's Megadeth - Rude Awakening [DVD], which, according to me, is a far superior concert. Just hear Mustaine and Pitrelli shredding on all songs (""Dread and the Fugitive Mind,"" ""Hangar 18,"" ""Holy Wars,"" come to mind), then DeGrasso annihilating the drum kit during ""In my Darkest Hour,"" and see the crowd frenzy during ""Hangar 18"" and other songs... the whole DVD gives you an uncontrollable adrenaline rush. Astounding.

Some of my favourite songs lack the brooding and melancholy feel - for instance, ""A Tout le Monde"" has got a peppy feel, as opposed to the gritty gloomy mood in Rude Awakening.. the drums towards the finale in ""In my Darkest Hour"" are not a patch on DeGrasso's frenetic pounding in Rude Awakening..

(Gripe, gripe) I also think that the best way to start a Megadeth concert is Mustaine snarling ""Let me introduce myself."" Except perhaps, ""Hangar 18"" or even better, ""Five Magics"" (which sadly, has never been played live till recently).

4 stars because Amazon does not allow 3.5 rating, and I anyway don't think 3 stars does justice to this great concert.",1302998400,,1324,4.793859649122807

2712052,3,B000LPS2P4,"This is a pretty cool concert performance but I don't get it.  The Rude Awakening DVD is far better in my opinion.  The band line-up was better back then with David Ellefson still in the band, along with Al Pitrelli and Jimmy Degrasson on drums.  A way tighter band than what is shown here.  You only get one new song from ""the system has failed"", the rest is old stuff. They play almost the exact same songs as the Rude Awakening DVD and almost in the same order.  But the RUDE performance sounded much better with better production and tighter performances from the band in my opinion.  If you're looking for a cool Megadeth concert DVD, I recommend Rude Awakening over this.  However, I did just watch this for free on Netflix instant view, so I can't complain!",1267833600,2,764,4.492753623188406
2712053,5,B000LPS2P4,"I can't wait to see Megadeth in Austin this month.  It will be my 4x to see them.  The dvd is killer.  The sound is top notch, the production is top notch and the selection of tunes is really strong.  IMO, what makes the dvd is that the crowd is so into the band that you get the feeling that Megadeth had to be in top form, not only because of the shoot, but because the crowd was so over the top.  Two thumbs up.  Metallica has nothing on Megadeth - nothing.",1267833600,,460,3.9456521739130435
2712054,4,B000LPS2P4,"If you only own one Megadeth DVD, this is the one you should own. The video and sound is top notch. Much better than Rude Awakening. Although every Rattlehead has their own favorites, the track selection is pretty good and it covers most of the ""hits"" while spanning Dave's career. The packed stadium in Buenos Aires keeps the energy alive throughout the entire set. Dave and Glen Drover sit outside their hotel and blast through some accoustic songs as well. As a long time Megadeth/Mustaine fan, I appreciate the fact that Dave is still going strong and keeping thrash and solos alive. If you can't see them live, like I did recently in Frankfurt, Germany; get this DVD and all will be forgiven.",1246406400,,697,4.67479674796748

Backstage first. There's only a few seconds of 'backstage' in this one. They're pretty cool though, and they actually kind of enhance the concert part, which is pretty rare in all of these metal dvds...

Concert part. This is where it shines. If you ever want to see the best of the best of the best of Megadeth concert-wise, this's where you go. The whole entire concert, you can hear like a whole city of people singing everything back, even the guitar parts, it is just an insane experience. Great for background listening for sure, and fun to watch, but you might only watch it a few times, but you'll probably be listening  to it in the background 100+ times...

Talk to ya'll later.",1230854400,2,741,4.548872180451128

2712059,4,B000LPS2P4,"Megadeth fans should get `That One Night', turn the sound up, and enjoy.  This is a first class production, capturing the band giving a killer performance, in front of a huge energetic crowd in Buenos Aries, Brazil in 2005.  The 90 minute concert, includes music from the 20 year career of the band, with an emphasis on their newer material.  Dave Mustaine is fully recovered from an arm injury that caused Megadeth to be dissolved a few years previous.  He has no problems singing and playing intricate rhythm parts, then executing precise speed metal leads.  Second lead guitarist, Glen Drover is also impressive, handling all the material smoothly, no easy task for a band with a musical catalog like Megadeth.  Bass player Jimmy McDonough, and drummer Shawn Drover, display energy and aggression as well.

The venue is a large outdoor stadium, with several large video screens, and a wide stage and runway.  The video production features a variety of camera angles, without much frenetic switching.  When someone has a solo, most times you can see the guitar work.  The fans in South America turn out big for their favorites, so it's very understandable why many bands choose to video their shows there, in front of massive seas of humanity.  And Mustaine makes an effort to reach out to the audience, repeatedly speaking to them in Spanish.  Sound is available in Dolby Digital 5.1 and 2.0, and DTS 5.1.

Megadeth covers their early days with `Wake Up Dead', `Peace Sells' and `In My Darkest Hour'.  From their thrash masterwork `Rust In Peace', comes `Hangar 18', `Tornado of Souls' and `Holy Wars'.  Most of the remaining material is post `Rust'.  The band's sound started transitioning on `Countdown to Extinction' and `Youthanasia', so overall, the performance has a good blend of tempos and tones, mixing melody, crunch, and crush.

Bottom line, this is a solid performance that should leave fans very well satisfied.  Later day Megadeth is slightly less aggressive than before, but the band still packs a punch.  Guitarist Glenn Drover left Megadeth in 2008, so enjoy his fine performance with the band, particularly on the Rust pieces Tornado of Souls and Hangar 18",1220054400,,2177,4.964088397790055

This specific show in Buenos aires, argentina is amazing, i don't care what other people think, or say, this lineup is stronger than ever with the drover brothers and of course mainman mr mustaine with his amazing lyrics and the way he plays the guitar.

From start to finish,this DVD, is great for any point of view,  great songs for every megadeth era, even a mini acoustic set outside the hotel with some fans very nice moment everybody singing the lyrics of ""in my darkest hour"" beautiful moment.

even mr mustaine throw some spanish words in ""symphony for destruction"",
and this south american crowds are into every single song, amazing crowds, they appreciate what a great show is, even the megadeth chant on ""symphony for destruction""  very original and breathtaking.

2712083,3,B000LPS2P4,"Rafael you must smoke bologna.... (above reviewer) What was Dave Thinking??? His band is weak.. good music but weak. His best line-up was Dave, Al & Jimmy. They brought us The World Needs a Hero. Remeber that magical time. Dave should go back to being angry about his personal life. This political rock is just to boring. Anyway... If you have Rude Awakening ... save your money there is nothing new to see so move along. Unless you absolutley have to see the songs from TSHF and UA then go ahead and waste your money. Bad cameras abound and the sound aint much better. It sounds like it was produced by some zit faced kid going to one of those schools where you learn production",1191369600,,679,4.44
2712084,4,B000LPS2P4,"Most of the criticism I have read of ""That One Night"" is based upon the fact that a few songs from the set list (which do appear on the CD version) were left off this DVD.  And that extras are basically non-existent.  More on those issues later.

Speaking strictly from a performance standpoint, Megadeth are as tight and energetic in this performance as I've seen them since the Friedman/Menza days.  The guitar mix is strong and aggressive.  Mustaine's playing is always something to behold, but it is particularly great in this show.  I think he's actually gotten better since his hiatus to deal with the nerve damage in his arm several years ago.  His voice is also a highlight in this show.  It's strong, nasty and in key throughout.  Whether there were overdub corrections done to the performance after the fact, I don't know.  And frankly I don't care.  It is spot on and that's all I care about when I play the disc.  Even better, the soundtrack is done in DTS 5.1 which IMO, is always the preferred format over Dolby Digital 5.1.  DTS just has a fuller soundstage which is supported by the bitrate numbers when compared to Dolby Digital.

From a band standpoint I still believe the Friedman/Menza/Ellefson lineup is the best Megadeth has ever fielded.  But the current lineup does rival that one live.  The Drover brothers and James MacDonough (Iced Earth) more than do justice to the old jams and pump serious life into the new tunes as well.  The Buenos Aires crowd is completely insane throughout the show and you can see that the band feeds off of that energy song after song.

Now, onto the issue so many have complained about in this DVD.  ""That One Night"" was mastered from an HD source.  No, I don't mean this DVD is a Blu-Ray or HD-DVD (although I wouldn't be surprised to see this concert released on Blu-Ray/HD-DVD at some point given it's HD source).  ""That One Night"" is a standard DVD.  What I'm saying is that the source material was shot with HD cameras.  As such, when HD source material is transferred to a standard def DVD it takes up much more space than standard def source material does.  The result is a superior standard def DVD picture.  But that comes with the tradeoff that less content can be fit on the DVD.  As such, there was likely not enough room to fit the entire set list or much in the way of extras on the DVD.  So some tunes had to be cut.  This is of course just my opinion on why some songs were left off the DVD and not the CD.  But I'm pretty confident that I'm correct on this.

Regardless, for $15 ""That One Night"" provides one of the greatest live performances by one of the greatest metal bands of all time.  Complaining about a few tunes being left off seems like nitpicking to me.  So I give a solid 4 stars plus.",1189987200,,2770,4.4453280318091455
2712085,5,B000LPS2P4,"This is such an amazing show--it looks and sounds stunning throughout. Megadeth is firing on all cylinders, and the Argentine audience is completely gonzo, singing along to the guitar riffs like a giant collective Beavis. The band feeds off the crowd's energy and just rips the stage up, while the outdoor venue allows that energy to multiply.

As for the new additions to the band, I actually think they sound heavier than ever. Guitarist Glen Drover used to be in King Diamond, and his brother Shawn on drums has a beefier sound than previous Megadeth sticksmen. Not to take away from from Gar Samuelson or Nick Menza, but they had a jazzier style that created a breezier, but not bone-crunching backbeat.

I've followed the four pillars of American thrash (Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax and Metallica) since the 80's. Slayer never strayed from its sound, Megadeth did for a while, but has come back to its brutal roots, while Metallica and Anthrax seem to have taken an artistic fork in the road and run out of gas. When I watch Dave perform on this DVD, I see someone still bursting with energy and anger, but time has allowed him to harness that and become, arguably, the best at what he does.",1187827200,,1194,4.708133971291866
2712086,3,B000LPS2P4,"It is a good concert DVD, but ""Rude Awakening"" is much more better. Buy "" Rude Awakening"" DVD if you have limited money.

This DVD lacks some offline content, behind the scenes and stuff like that, since fans expect more inside materials.

The title denoted as ""Symphony of Destruction remix"" is not actually a remix.  I could observe no differences with respect to the standard content of the DVD.",1187136000,,398,4.739130434782608
2712087,4,B000LPS2P4,"That One Night, Live In Buenos Aires (2007.), a Megadeth live concert DVD/CD release

Five years ago, Megadeth was a band literally rusting in peace. Frontman Dave Mustaine sustained a hand injury whilst in rehab. Unable to play guitar following this, Dave was forced to disband Megadeth. Three years later and Dave is back and Megadeth are ready once again to play their classic, distinctive brand of metal. After slowly reteaching himself to play guitar, Mustaine put together some excellent material for the band's comeback album `The System Has Failed', released in 2004. Teaming up with Canadian brothers Glen Drover (guitar) and Shaun Drover (drums) plus Iced Earth bassist James McDonough, Megadeth embarked on the Gigantour of 2005. The concert on this DVD is from right at the end of Gigantour 1 and was  recorded on October 9th 2005 in Buenos Aires. Let me tell you this is no ordinary concert...

Megadeth hold something of godlike status amongst many in Argentina. The fans there are really crazy about the band (the DVD has footage at the start with fans following the band everywhere!) and give Megadeth an amazing reception at the concert. As you guessed, there is a great atmosphere throughout the concert which is really electric. What makes this concert extremely significant also is that Dave announces at the end that `We'll be back!' which told Megadeth fans worldover that `System Has Failed' and the Gigantour was not to be the band's swansong. The chemistry of the band on this live performance is excellent, Megadeth have really restored themselves to their former glory. The Drover brothers (who play on the band's most recent album `United Abominations') seem especially settled into the Megadeth setup and both perform excellently. Dave himself is a completely rejuvenated force and sings great and is back on form with the guitar after his injury. The concert set has some excellent selections plus some rarely performed Megadeth songs such as `Ill Be There' and `Coming Home'. Slightly annoyingly though is the fact that not all of the tracks from the concert are shown here. Dave did state that all 22 would be on here however we've only got 18 of them. Still though, the songs on here are fantastic. The DVD also incorporates some good exerpts of Dave and Glen Drover playing Megadeth songs on acoustic to a group of fans away from the concert venue, they get a great reception from the fans. In terms of bonus material there is a nice extra version of `Symphony Of Destruction'.

The whole concert is awesome viewing however there are some real standout moments. The performance of `A Tout Le Monde' is very memorable, with the crowd really getting into the music. `Ill Be There' and `Coming Home' are also two powerful parts of the set, again with lots of crowd participation. I personally enjoyed hearing the thrashy `Set The World Afire' and the stuff from the `System Has Failed' album was really hammered home strongly.

All in all, this (along with their 2002 DVD `Rude Awakening') is a must buy for any Megadeth fan. The band are in vintage form here and give a minted performance that more than deserves its place on this DVD. Megadeth's return to the fore has been remarkable and the band are producing some of their best work in years. I saw the band perform early this year in Bristol, UK and at the Download Festival, UK, where the crowd went absolutely mental! Megadeth are still hugely popular and are fantastic live. This DVD shows Megadeth in immense form yet again!

It was a bit lacking in special features, but hey, you don't buy a concert for the special features, even though they are a nice thing to have. They play a good variety of songs from many different albums, including a rare performance of Ill be There. Plus, Dave sings part of Trust in spanish. I thought this was a plus, even though I don't speak a word of spanish, I like it when bands do something special with songs when they play them live. If you are a metal fan, this concert is a must see for sure.",1178582400,,566,4.201834862385321

Dave always delivers.
The vibe from the audience is amost haunting as they sing the guitar parts as well as the lyrics! Had to be an incredible rush for the performers.

If you really want to know why Dave is so in love with Argentina to play live, this is the DVD for you.  There's no crowd like this for Megadeth in any other part of the world. Megadeth fans, this is a must have. Thanks !",1177632000,,248,3.843137254901961
2712094,5,B000LPS2P4,"This is Megadeth at their best.

However your enjoyment of this dvd will depend on your ability to deal with a very enthusiastic Buenos Aires audience.

I own some bootleg South American performances and was prepared for this. However, if you are someone who has only seen or heard Megadeth in the States, then the amount of crowd participation may come at you as an intrusion. They not only sing along to the vocals, but often sing along to the lead and rhythm guitar parts as well.

It's understandable, as big name US bands don't get to travel to all parts of the world that often, so they are making the most of the experience. Perhaps I am spoiled in that respect. Most bands that I am into, I get to see at least once a year. I know what to expect, and its not that big a deal.

What I would give to be in a crowd that shows their enthusiasm not by mindless moshing, but by cheering the band on through every note being played. It's a unique experience, and probably not for everyone. But this version of Megadeth...not their most talented lineup for sure...still manages to pull out all the stops. And hey, for 15 bucks which is what I got it for at Best Buy, you really can't go wrong.",1177113600,,1193,4.3125

2712096,4,B000LPS2P4,"Very good concert DVD. Camera angles are a plus. Very impressed with the Drover brothers.

I know a few people had some specific gripes about the DVD. Here's mine. A major moment in any show is the band's entrance onstage. The director chose to chop that moment out. Big mistake. The show basically opens a few seconds into Blackmail The Universe. Whoever signed off on that edit needs to have their head checked. Whoops!

Otherwise, a very enjoyable show.",1175817600,3,456,4.7594936708860756

Also, I can't understand why the beginning of ""Blackmail the Universe"" is slightly cut off.  They start the video like three seconds after the song started.

And no pyro?  Unless it's against the law in Argentina to use controlled explosives on stage, it definitely took away from the effect of certain songs they usually use it on.",1174694400,2,513,5.132530120481928
2712099,3,B000LPS2P4,"A nice concert DVD but really scarce on the extras. A bit hard to swallow considering you can buy Iron Maiden's ""Death on the Road"" 3 disc DVD set for about the same price and it's loaded with extras. However the editing is better on Megadeth's DVD.

""themusicfiend"" is right in his review where he mentions how the drums seem to be out of synch with the rest of the band later in the DVD and it's not that the sound is out of sync with the drummer. It's like the drummer is out of synch with the band. Weird. I'm also surprised that no one else has mentioned how the band member's names that show up on the bottom of the screen at the beginning of the concert are half cut off. It's as though they but in the captions before framing it for widescreen and they got chopped off in the process. Unless this is just an issue with my TV, but my TV does support 16:9 widescreen.

Other then the issues mentioned above this is a nice concert DVD and I did enjoy watching it a lot. Nice crunchy guitar tone and ya gotta love the audience. They sure love their metal. Certainly recommend for any Megadeth fan but just don't expect a lot of extras.",1174608000,9,1139,4.19634703196347
