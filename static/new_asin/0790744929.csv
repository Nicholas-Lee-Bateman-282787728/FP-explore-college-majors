114111,5,0790744929,"James Cagney in his first starring role. He plays a rascally bellhop who teams up with chambermaid Joan Blondell, and together they set out to become world-beaters. They do pretty well together until they get swindled by Louis Calhern and Noel Francis. Blondell finds the straight and narrow with Raymond Milland, but Cagney gets caught and goes to the slammer. But Blondell misses her old ""partner in crime,"" visits him in jail, and tells him she'll be waiting for him when he's sprung (she's dumping Milland). It's all as light as a feather, Depression-era escapism, but Cagney and Blondell are perfect together. The script is breezy and clever, and Blondell delivers her usual array of wisecracks. Cagney is quite a live wire himself. Good entertainment.",1148515200,2,757,5.064
114112,5,0790744929,"This witty crime film is filled with romance, two factors that one doesn't normally expect to be paired together but which work tremendously well as a couple.

The film starts out as a guy who is up to no good (Cagney) and a girl just looking for a job (Blondell) meet in a hotel where the guy works. He gets the girl a job by putting another girl out of one. He's mesmerized by the girl's good looks and despite his efforts, all he gets is a slap in the face.

Eventually, the two get to liking each other, Cagney more than Blondell. They team up to make some cash by conning crooked people out of their earnings. Their schemes work like a charm and the two are well on their way when Cagney loses their profits in a counterfeit deal that turns out to be a trick. Blondell finds a way to get their money back from the same guy and does. By this time, Cagney is in love, and so is Blondell- with another guy.

The pair splits when Blondell gets married and Cagney vows never to do another job. He can't bear to take up the life the two were living together all alone. But Blondell is in trouble; her straight laced husband gets caught in a get rich quick scheme and loses company money. She asks for Cagney's help which he readily supplies due to his love for Blondell. However, he gets tricked and the police catch him.

The film is interesting from start to finish. The love story seems truly genuine. Unlike most formula romance movies similar to this one, the characters seem genuinely attached and right for each other. The emotions are played with realism and sensitivity; not one bit of it is forced.

Another asset to this film is the lighting. The crisp contrast and soft backgrounds make for some wonderful images.

Overall, this is a gem of a film.",1126569600,5,1759,4.363914373088685
114113,4,0790744929,"It is so obvious a movie such as ""Blonde Crazy"" was made before the production code. It is way too explicit not to have been.

 The movie stars James Cagney as Bert Harris, a bellhop at a hotel in a small mid-western town. He is the kind of guy that is always looking to make an extra buck and still keep one eye on the ladies.

 One day Anne Roberts (Joan Blondell) walks in looking for a job. So Bert makes sure she's given an interview even though there are no openings. Anne gets the job and now Bert thinks she should show him some appreciation. The only thing she gives him though is a slap across the face, several times over.

 As time goes by and Bert and Anne get to know one another he lets her in on his future plan. Bert really wants to become a con-man and wants Anne to join him. Reluctant at first she later agrees and the two become pretty successful until they run into Dapper Dan (Louis Calhern).

 Dapper Dan is a person of experience in the con game. Cagney and Blondell are amateurs next to him. The two get involved in a scheme Dan is working on but find they get taken instead.

 At this point ""Blonde Crazy"" suggest a lot of things, mostly sex. Calhern has a partner, Helen (Noel Francis) whom Bert has his eyes on as Blondell looks on. And Dan meanwhile has his eyes on Blondell. These people are not that innocent.

 Through much of the film a jealousy game is going on between Cagney and Blondell. We know Cagney likes Blondell, but we are not sure of her feelings at first. But each always seems to try and make the other jealous. This leads Blondell to meet Joe Reynolds (Ray Milland). I suppose deep down though this is really a struggle for power between the two. It is an attempt to show the other they are in charge only they are not using muscle to prove their power, they are using sex appeal.

 ""Blonde Crazy"" in my opinion is not a better film then ""Public Enemy"" (which also had Blondell and Cagney) or ""The Roaring 20s"" but it is still an entertaining film with good performances from the two leads and has some clever twist which surprised me.

 Bottom-line: Entertaining pre-production code film that is pretty darn suggestive. Good performances here helped by a good script.",1123545600,7,2217,4.3707317073170735
114114,5,0790744929,"This movie has it all: charm, wit, a clever plot, Joan Blondell in one of her best roles and the magnificent Jimmy Cagney who displays the full array of his talents. In 1931, Cagney was just beginning his rise as Warner's great gangster hero of the 30's, and his screen image hadn't quite yet been perfected. He's more funny here than he was later on, and the characteristic swagger and facial expressions aren't as much in evidence. You can see Jimmy working on his persona and it's pure pleasure to watch it in this film.
Cagney and Blondell play a couple of swindelers who scam anyone and everyone who comes down the pike. Though they are dual rip-off artists, you gotta love 'em, especially the wisecracking Cagney, who throws in one-liners which will convulse you. There's a lot of unintentional comedy which demonstrates that he and Joan possessed inherent comedic timing. Watch for the young Ray Milland, in one of his first screen roles of any note. He's as handsome as ever, but his acting ability certainly improved later on.
If you're new to Jimmy Cagney, this would be a fine first film to view, along with Pubic Enemy and The Roaring Twenties. His unique gifts as actor, dancer and public treasure are shown to their best advantage here. This is a fine early film with a wonderful performance by James Cagney.",1059091200,11,1322,4.702586206896552
114115,5,0790744929,"Jimmy plays a bellhop who schemes to get his girlfriend Ann (Blondell) a job in the Hotel's linen room; entertaining complications ensue - such as Jimmy getting sent to prison!!  Cagney plays a non-violent con man who lives by his wits instead of the muscle he flexed earlier in THE PUBLIC ENEMY. It's a simple story straight out of the days of Prohibition & the Great Depression, but told with such gusto by director Roy Del Ruth and acted with such verve by Cagney and the vivacious kewpie doll-like Blondell that the charm and banter delighted 1931 audiences (in search of escapism) and the hoi polloi flocked to see this new wise-cracking love team.  The rapid fire delivery between Jimmy and 24 year-old Ray Milland drove director Del Ruth to distraction; he told them that they reminded him of ""two (unprintable) woodpeckers"" Del Ruth told the men to go over their lines and speak them as to be understood - Del Ruth claimed he could catch only one word in four!",1025481600,5,968,4.654970760233918
114116,4,0790744929,"James Cagney and Joan Blondell star as a couple of scam artists who work out detailed schemes to get money out of innocent (and not-so-innocent) people.  It's Cagney's idea (of course) to get into this, and Blondell goes along because she falls in love with him.  Before long, they're swindling swindlers and getting mixed up with people even shadier than them.  A lot of the film is lighthearted and played for laughs, although it does have its dramatic moments.  The con games they are involved in are a lot of fun to watch unfold, and as a pre-Code film, there are some interesting scenes, dialogue, and innuendo.  Cagney and Blondell are a great team together.  His talents are, of course, legendary, but Blondell is not as well known to audiences today.  She's terrific in the film, leveling wisecracks with the best of them, yet quietly effective in the more serious scenes.  The movie moves along quickly with lots of snappy dialogue (it is a Warner Brothers film afterall), and the two stars make it memorable.  Oh, and for the record - I don't think I've ever seen another film where so many people get slapped in the face!!",1015804800,12,1133,4.681818181818182
114117,5,0790744929,"Mr. Maltin et al say this movie is dated, but that's a large part of the appeal of this movie.  James Cagney is at his wisecracking best as Bert, a bellhop who aspires to be the ultimate con man, with his scrapbook of  newspaper clippings of cons that ""got pinched"" in tow.  Joan  Blondell is cute as a button as sassy Ann, his partner in crime.  These two  together are dynamite onscreen.  A must see for anyone who loves comedies  from the 1930s.  It's great to see all the period clothes and cars, and  it's interesting to note the bathtub scene - obviously pre-code stuff.  This movie is not meant to be taken seriously, just great fun.  The fact  that it IS dated is what makes it so watchable.  What movies from the  ""golden age of Hollywood"" AREN'T dated?  It was indicative of the  times.  This movie is a classic, pure enjoyment.

7791518,5,0790744929,"""Blonde Crazy"" is an exemplary pre-Code comedy-drama featuring the well-matched duo of wise-cracking ""tough guy"" James Cagney and street-smart ""classy dame"" Joan Blondell.  In this film, the two are con artists and lovers.  Their chemistry is electric, the dialogue is witty and fast-paced, and some of the shots (like the aerial tracking shot of the jail cells toward the end) are absolutely brilliant.  Pre-Code risqu&eacute; edginess is never in short supply here (Prohibition is openly flaunted and, of course, there's the famous Blondell bathtub scene).

A must-see film that is just as entertaining and fun today as it was over eighty years ago!  Long-overdue for its DVD release (Warner Home Video should have included it as part of either the Warner Gangster Collection or as part of the TCM ""Forbidden Hollywood"" series).",1345766400,4,830,5.257575757575758

7791520,4,0790744929,"This is a review for the WB videotape of their film of BLONDE CRAZY,
1931, directed at a snappy pace by Roy Del Ruth with an up-to-date story
by Kubic Glasman and John Bright.

In this no doubt rapidly filmed WR wonder, James Cagney, not much beyond his
truimph as Tom Powers in the WB hit THE PUBLIC ENEMY, plays an established
bell-hop named Bert Harris at a big city hotel who's looking for a way to make
""real money"" without having to lug around luggage in these  depression times.

When he gets a job for pretty Ann Roberts, he is rebuffed romantically but
eventually she's tempted and finally falls in with Bert's coniving cons.
Most of his cons are small time and victimize fellow con men but eventually
they run into Dapper Dan Barker,played by Louis Calhern,  a relative big timer
compared to them.  Dapper Dan takes the small fry but good but Bert Harris and
Ann Roberts have their ways of getting even.

BLONDE CRAZY is a breezy, enjoyable  look into the  very entertaining
WB pre-code portrayal of 1931 when Prohibition was still as big a factor
as hard times in these films. If you enjoy that kind of movie then BLONDE CRAZY
is for you.

BLONDE CRAZY has fine performances by James Cagney, Joan Blondell, Louis Calhern,
Noel Francis and a somewhat uncomfortable Ray Milland.

7791521,5,0790744929,"no plot rundown as the others have done a nice job of it.

essentially, this is a film that can wear repeat viewings for the sheer pleasure of it, largely due to the effervescent performances, particularly cagney's. when he spoke of dropping 'goodies' into run-of-the-mill 'programmer' scripts, he was referring, in part, to the bits of flair he brought to bert. i read that the initial rushes in which he was not allowed to improvise were a bust but once they re-shot with cagney's special touches (the mannerisms, vocal quirks, so on), it was a success. and it's easy to see why; in my opinion, it makes the film.

overall, it's an enjoyable film showcasing the chemistry with blondell. their real life friendship is evident in the sarcastic on-screen relationship. while not the typical happy ending, it's a cute and memorable one that still allows the film a feel-good quality. the linen room slapping scene is one of my favorites and serves well to juxtapose cagney's ability to convincingly reveal the comedic/lighthearted everyman behind the badass.",1260576000,2,1056,4.994318181818182
7791522,5,0790744929,"This is one of those very early talkie/precodes that I wish would come out on DVD. At this point in its history - 1931 - Warner Bros. was the mass producer of urban dramas and films that realistically portrayed the depression. Some of the films Warner made during this time were quite forgettable, and others had something special. This film is one of those special efforts, largely due to the acting skills of Joan Blondell and the great James Cagney and the on-screen chemistry they had. Cagney's character (Bert Harris) starts out as a bellboy in a midwestern hotel who is instantly attracted to Joan Blondell's character (Anne Roberts) when she applies for a job as a hotel maid. Bert wants a career as a confidence man and talks Anne into going into business with him as a partner. They work their way up from that small midwestern town into larger stakes in New York. Along the way Cagney runs into someone who ends up taking him instead of vice versa, Dan Barker, played by Louis Calhern. Calhern always excelled at playing the part of a slippery type, and his performance here is no exception. After settling the score with Dan, Anne wants out of the racket so she can marry a nice young man she has  met along the way, and this seems like the end of the film. However, there is one final twist at the end that reunites Anne and Bert in a way that is totally unexpected.

Even though this film was made after Cagney's star-making role in ""Public Enemy"", he still doesn't have his gangster/wise guy personna down yet. That makes one of the unexpected pleasures of the film seeing how he is still finding his way as far as his trademark gestures go in his later  roles. Highly recommended.",1200096000,3,1695,4.550819672131148
