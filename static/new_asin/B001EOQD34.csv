THERE ARE SOME WONDERFUL PERFORMANCES HERE, BUT WHEN PRODUCED THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD MORE REAL CHRISTMAS SONGS ON THE CHRISTMAS SHOWS. THE ELVIS TRIBUTE ON THE 1977 SHOW IS TERRIFIC, + ANDY KAUFMANS' PERFORMANCE AS ELVIS ON THE 1979 SHOW IS INCREDIBLE. ANY FAN OF COUNTRY OR CASH WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.",1450051200,,369,4.967741935483871
3556536,3,B001EOQD34,"If your a fan of the old Christmas Specials we would see on Network TV then you will love this set.  What I found so remarkable about this set was how Johnny Cash would give his guest to shine.  I love that he showed us his trip to the ""Holy Land"" because it really does remind you that there really was a man named Jesus.  This set does not have a pushy agenda in it.  It is a celebration of love & family.",1445731200,,407,3.8674698795180724
