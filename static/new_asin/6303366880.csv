They're all wonderful, but none is so all encompassing as Putney Swope.  As  the liner notes say, it's ""relevant to everything.""  Every time I  watch it, I see something else in it. I cannot imagine the space/time gap  (or drugs) that inspired the creativity of the screenplay, but it has not  been matched. The performances, for the most part, are equal to the script.  Admittedly, it's not for everyone.  My wife and I have occasionally  subjected couples to ""the Swope test,"" which requires married  couples to view it together.  At least two divorces have occurred, because  one partner laughed at every line, while the other saw no humor at all.  But the partners who both enjoyed it will stay together always.

631093,5,6303366880,"I almost ordered this DVD from Amazon but, at the last second, found it cheaper elsewhere.  But I ordered it partly because I love this old gem - and partly out of deference to Gary Johnson, the 2016 Libertarian Party candidate for President of the United States.  The connection?

Spoilers follow - so consider yourself forewarned.

Putney Swope (the person) was the only African-American sitting on the board of directors of a corporation.  When the Chairman of the Board died, remaining board members had to choose a new chairman.  But because board members either hated or distrusted all the other white board members, they voted for Putney Swope - figuring no other board member would vote for him.  So, Putney Swope became the Chairman of the Board.

In the current Presidential election, many news pundits have suggested (and rightly so) that the electorate either hates or distrust one or both major-party candidates ... so much so that they want an alternative.  Could Johnson be the 2016 version of Putney Swope (grin) - ascending to the White House because most people hate or distrust the major-party candidates?  Hey, stranger things have happened.",1467763200,,1161,5.031413612565445

631153,4,6303366880,"Though definitely a cheaply produced, 1960s period piece, Putney Swope still manages to serve up an interesting cocktail of early-Woody Allen type comedy shaken, not stirred, with biting social satire. It builds upon a clever role reversal premise, in which '60s ""movement"" black radicals take over a stodgy Madison Ave ad agency. If its message that no good deed goes unpunished, and that people of all colors are infinitely corruptible, now seems dated, it's only because culturally subversive underground movies like Putney Swope helped make these ideas mainstream in the '60s. It's worth watching for that reason alone, but there's also some laugh-aloud physical comedy, good character acting, and a bit of human pathos to round it out.",1436054400,,740,5.279661016949152

631252,5,6303366880,"This almost-unknown film from the psychedelic/revolutionary era is simply one of the Top 10 films of all time.  (In case you don't know, it's about what happens when a black man is unintentionally elected to be the new head of an advertising company.)  It is unique and/or superb in so many ways.  It includes scenes that are variously funny, shocking, amazing, philosophical, and revelatory.  Most scenes are in-your-face, but others are very subtle, which you might not ""get"" on first viewing.  I must include some notes of warning, but still ask that you view and accept and esteem the overall work.  There is one severe anti-Semitic statement, which will offend Jews (and maybe others as well).  It is uttered by a German during a spell of heavy laughter, but the film's stance is that this man is degenerate, and insensitive about the Holocaust.  There is also a self-deprecating statement made by a Chinese man that will shock and offend many people somewhat.  And there is some verbal denigration of a Scandinavian woman by a black woman that will be difficult for many people to watch.  Just remember that not only was this film shot long before certain words and topics were labeled ""politically correct"" vs. ""off limits""; it was shot in the vein of ""busting out"" and ""unbridled expression"" during the time of our greatest cultural change, with the filmmaker's goal being the realization of his artistic vision instead of the approval of society over 40 years in the future.",1409011200,4,1483,4.896

A word of warning.  There were two DVD versions of this movie.  The first one's cover has a man with an afro, leaning with back to the camera with scenes from the movie above him.  This is the full screen pan/scan version.  The newer DVD version's cover has the fist and woman picture.  This is the widescreen version.  If you care about widescreen, I would avoid purchasing from marketplace sellers that do not explicitly state which cover/version they are selling.

If you weren't a teenager or college age at the time (late 60's) this movie will probably seem to you as totally surreal or be a total waste of your time.

In this turkey, token Negro board member Putney Swope is elected chairman of an advertising agency's board of directors after the previous board chairman unexpectedly dies.  Thinking that no one else would vote for him but concerned that a boycott of their token would betray their resident racism, a majority of the other members votes for Swope.

Immediately instituting a sweeping campaign of reforms, including dressing board members in dashikis and renaming the advertising agency ""Truth and Soul Incorporated"", Swope seems at first likely to prove a creative new mastermind for the company.  However, rabid ambition drives him to overstep his authority time and time again.  In the end, he proves himself instead--in the words of one detractor--""nothin' but a jive nigger"".

Distrustful of the white-dominated banks, he decides to keep all of the company's funds in cash.  This backfires when, in a rage of jealousy, some employees and board members who feel frozen out of the action set the company safe on fire and destroy all of its money.

After I first viewed it around ten years ago I watched it over and over. I am so glad to finally have this gem on DVD.",1003536000,8,498,4.091836734693878
631430,3,6303366880,"thats the logic behind this movie. A single man makes a busiess  for the people and by the people  One man single handedly turns big business civic minded. Putney, a hep cat, makes the business grow. Not bad, a little heavy handed at times, but not bad",998438400,3,252,4.340425531914893
631431,5,6303366880,"Robert Downey's greatest success.  This film was originally described as a 'metaphor for everything' when it first came out.  It is an irreverent, unpredictable, relentlessly hilarious, almost dadaist black and white opus dei that was inspired by the directors work in an advertising firm.
It focuses on a 'token' black man on the board of directors for a upscale advertising agency, whom ends up running the entire organiztion when his constituents vote for him thinking no one else would while electing a new leader.
The actors were all part of a very peculiar clique and appear en masse in a wide spectrum of subculture films from the era.
Anyone with an even passing interest in non-conventional cinema should watch this movie religiously.  Its been a huge influence on my own tastes, and this sentiment if shared by virtually everyone Ive ever met who has seen it.",989971200,12,869,4.938356164383562
631432,5,6303366880,"It is 1970; I am 19 years old and it is my first date with a girl named Angel (her last name).  I am a sophomore at SFVSC and the week before my date, my buddies and I saw Putney Swope at the Fox Theatre in  Westwood.
With my laughing muscles in my face and stomach still aching  from the lactic acid built up during the movie, I called Miss Angel and  invited her out.  She was a prissy little girl and I thought that Swope  would be a quick way to cut through her pretentiousness.  I put her on  notice after asking her ""how gross do you go?"" in preparing her  for the film.  She accepted the challenge.
I picked her up in my bright  yellow brand new Ford Maverick.  She sneered at the lack of leather or  power windows or status car crests.
About halfway through the movie she  leaned over to me and asked me to take her home.  She hated it and hated  me.  Being a gentleman I determined that she had adequate bus fare and sent  her back home.
The movie is my absolute favorite.  A depiction of  reality demonstrating that regardless of a person's paint job, we are all  the same on the inside.
I along with my college buddies never let a visit  pass without some reference to this movie.
It was a valuable lesson in  our lives.
The passing of Arnold Johnson last month adds a touch of  sorrow to tonight's gathering of my buddies as we celebrate our 50th  birthdays.
The Borman 6 girl sure does have soul.  See the film and learn  about Chairman Mario, Mark Focus, President Mimeo, Wynn Sony, Victrola  Cola, Lawrence of Nigeria and Face Off.",960595200,34,1546,4.256055363321799
631433,5,6303366880,The best way I can think to praise this movie is to point out that it was preceded by a porno movie on my step-dads dubbed tape copy and i spent much more time watching this movie then watching the porno.(and not just because  i was only watching the porno for fifteen minutes at a time)I don't know if  Putney Swope is as politically relevant today as it was when it came out  but a midget president who invites a reporter into a three way with him and  his midget first lady merely because the reporter voted for him sounds like  a gag that could be on South Park tonight.,957571200,3,574,4.181818181818182
631434,5,6303366880,"I rented Putney Swope after I read that it is one of PT Anderson's favorite movies, and I am so glad I did.  The way this movie tackles race and politics would probably get the filmmakers into trouble these days,  with political correctness and all that.  Putney Swope is both funny and  ""relevant to everything"", as it says on the box.  The situations  could easily occur today, but none of today's directors could tackle the  subjects with as much wit and creativity as Robert Downey, Sr.",954288000,2,490,4.627906976744186
