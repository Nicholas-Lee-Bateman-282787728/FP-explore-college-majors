He is absolutely in love with this DVD and I have even hooked his dad on these.  They are so interesting and the tow truck guys are so talented in recovery of large semi-trucks that it makes these truly amazing.  Also a great teacher of driving too fast on icy roads.",1490572800,,367,4.214285714285714

8619387,3,B00FY84JDM,"This is an entertaining series, particularly if you live or travel in the Sierras.  And it might be educational for flatlanders.  Only 3 stars because:
1) Each episode follows at least three different tow drivers and constantly jumps from the action at one driver's location to another's location.  And each time they return to a location they waste a minute replaying video you already saw, reminding you what was happening before they cut away.  Sometimes you see the same clip three or more times.  If there were no repeated video each 60 minute episode would take 20-30 minutes.
2) At least a couple of the tow drivers are grossly over-acted as is common on reality TV shows.
3) If you know the area, you will find it irritating when they talk about driving in Truckee and yet they show the truck cruising by the Baxter exit.  Just a minor gripe since it doesn't detract from the story and if you are from out of the area you wouldn't even notice.",1420416000,,951,4.564705882352941
8619388,4,B00FY84JDM,That is quite a crew that works that highway. It was interesting to see how careless ( or fearless ) some drivers are. The tow people do a tremendous job but appear to be in such stiff competition ( cut throat ) with each other. The Running Bear company should have just folded their tent instead of embarrassing themselves. Just poor management. I really disliked Sam's boss for harassing him like he did and cheating him out of his bonus as he knew full well that Sam would react the way he did. Real crappy!!,1400112000,,511,4.389473684210526
