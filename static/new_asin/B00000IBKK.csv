1220143,1,B00000IBKK,"This is a disastrous episode in the Madeline chronicles.  I gave this video one star only because the posting screen will not allow me to rate it zero or negative stars!  The film tells the story of the orphan Madeline  being kidnapped into slavery by an evil gang of lace makers.  The  terrifying story line left my three-year-old twin daughters blubbering in  fear!  Blatantly contradicts all previous storylines by orphaning Madeline.  Definitely not suitable for my children, yours should approach with  extreme caution.",942624000,22,524,5.216867469879518
1220144,1,B00000IBKK,"This terribly dreadful story invloving the kidnapping of children and using hair to make lace is totally out of tune with the previous Madeline videos. Whatever positive message the writers intended just gets  obliterated in the dark aspects of the story. I viewed it with my 4yr old  who was physically shivering (yes!) at various points of the show. When it  got too much, she told me to turn it off, something she's never done when  it comes to Madeline. I watched it to the end and found it confusing that  Madeline is presented here as an orphan. An earlier video, Madeline's  Christmas, clearly shows her papa & mama. Overall, a dismal effort in  the research, writing and presentation of a Madeline story. Very  disappointing.",939254400,20,733,4.808
1220295,3,B00000IBKK,"I watched this movie before I let my 3-year-old daughter watch it, and I'm glad I did because I don't want her to see it. It is too dark for little girls--there's kidnapping, sickness, child labor, threats, lying, and general fear. It should not be shown to young children because of its dark themes. It's true that there are redeeming themes of perserverence, cooperation, and friendship, but they are overshadowed by the overall story. Although it is for older children, I don't plan on owning it because of the negative feelings it gave *me*. You would do better to get the 25-minute videos such as ""Madeline and the Bad Hat,"" ""Madeline's Rescue,"" and ""Madeline at the Ballet."" The songs are better, the stories more uplifting, and the overall tones are easier on the tender feelings of young girls and boys.",1016496000,13,811,4.8
1220296,5,B00000IBKK,"My daughter received this video for her sixth birthday, and she LOVES it!!!  The animation is great, the songs and catchy (with lots of music video style animation to go with them!) the plot is engaging enough to hold her interest, and the message throughout is wonderful:  There's nothing better than true friendship!  As a parent, I find the movie entertaining, myself, as we feel ourselves ""pulling"" for our heroine Madeline, who is adorable and has a heart of gold, as usual!  In the story, Madeline is ""tricked"" by a man pretending to be her uncle, but who in fact wants her to go to work for her in a lace factory that's run by a very evil woman (in the style of Cruella DaVille)!  Kids my daughter's age seem to really get into this theme of the evil villan or villaneous trying to capture the ""good guy"" - and then the ""good guy"" getting away.  Maybe this movie wouldn't be appropriate for a three year old (I don't think it was made for three year olds!) but for girls age 5 and up, it's a SUREFIRE WINNER.  TRE MAGNIFIQUE!",981763200,6,1032,4.4
1220297,1,B00000IBKK,"This video is quite inappropriate for young viewers - even though it is rated G.  And isn't that the target audience for Madeline???  The subject matter covered in this video is just TOO MUCH for young children to handle.  Why even go there???
My 3 year old just adores Madeline.  However, during the video, she started sobbing, which she had never done before (or since).  Nightmares were also a big issue for a few nights.  I now feel guilty for letting her watch the whole thing.
What kind of message is Disney sending to Madeline fans when she gets abducted by an evil, imposter Uncle & placed in a dungeon to make lace out of hair where an evil woman makes threats to cut off her hair to make RARE red lace?  Sure, she gets saved by her friends in the end, but that's not until the VERY end of the movie.  Yes, there's evil out there, but why not wait until they are older & can think through something like this...and let's not put Madeline as the victim!  Let's let our kids stay kids a while longer...
P.S.  Borrow it from the library (like I did) if you're still curious.  And then buy something else!",976060800,9,1110,4.339805825242719
1220298,4,B00000IBKK,"I approached the new Disney ""Madeline"" film with a certain amount of reservation after reading some of the reviews on this page.  Having watched the film twice now, I can only say, ""what is all the  fuss about?""  I found the video to be an involving, sweet little story  which is well-worth owning for any Madeline fans.
Let me address some  specific issues.  Firstly, the fact that Madeline is an orphan.  True, this  was not contained in the Bemelmans' books - but, being a feature film, this  new offering is clearly following the live-action feature released a couple  of years back by Columbia/Tri-Star, which established this fact.  It does  add some poignancy to the story and strengthens Madeline's relationship  with Miss Clavel.
As to the ""cruel, bizarre"" story, the  ""sadistic"" plot twists or the ""inappropriate"" shots, I  found none outside what most cartoons feature - and even what the Madeline  series has included to date.  Indeed, the section in ""Madeline and the  Bad Hat"" where Pepito constructs a guillotine, and the section in the  live-action film where Madeline and Pepito are kidnapped by the  ""Idiots"" and imprisoned in the back of their van (tied up, no  less) are potentially more terrifying for young children than the child  labour presented in this film, where the most menacing object is a pair of  scissors used to cut hair.  I could also list many other Disney films (Snow  White, Pinocchio, Toy Story, etc) which contain more frightening material,  too - an interest in the cruel aspects of human nature has always been an  undercurrent of cartoons and of childhood itself.
Through her trials,  Madeline is presented as a brave little girl who does not give up hope and  remains loyal to her friends.  She speaks out against the treatment she and  other children receive - and, more importantly, does something about it.  Surely these are worthwhile messages in the world we live in?  (And what a  joy it is to see the poor children in the lace-factory find a home and be  cared for in the end.)
The songs and animation are both of a consistently  high standard, though I would perhaps avoid this film (and other Madeline  stories, as mentioned above) for the VERY young children - say, under four  years - without parental guidance.  Aside from that, ""Lost In  Paris"" is a cute film which won't dissapoint.",965260800,14,2341,4.813131313131313
1220299,5,B00000IBKK,"Come to think of it, I think that this movie is much better suited for children over 8 years of age.  The songs are beautiful and the movie itself is one good surprise after another.  They certainly did a very good job of  breaking the ""dumb bad guy"" stereotype that is usually associated  with the movies that I saw.  I hope, however, that if they do a theatrical  release, that the movie will be much, much better.",955411200,3,416,4.337662337662338
1220300,1,B00000IBKK,"Let me see if I have this straight.  Madeline's father, who filled her room with flowers and toys when she had her appendix out, is now apparently dead.  A strange man posing as an ""uncle"" acts out a scheme--too subtle and disturbing to explain to your small child--for abducting Madeline away from her tearful friends and Miss Clavel.  The uncle then SELLS a distraught Madeline to a sadistic shop owner (Lauren Bacall, how's  your career going?),who keeps Madeline and other little girls ENSLAVED in  a dark basement to make lace out of HUMAN HAIR! Her best friend down there is gaunt little girl who has been there a long,long time and can't speak  without coughing.  At one point, as punishment for talking back to her captor, Madeline is placed alone in a tiny, dank cell. She is ultimately  rescued by her friends and the police before an unimaginable fate. How did the police get there?  On a tip from the ""uncle""--not  because of any act of conscience on his part-- but because he worked a plea bargain with the police to get a lighter sentence!!

My wife and I both found this video to be relentlessly cruel and completely bizarre.  Whatever positive  theme you or your child were supposed to glean from all of this--be  optimistic?...you can to anything?...hair makes a nice doily?--was totally  overwhelmed by a sadistic storyline and perverse characters that will find  you trying to comfort and reassure your child for days. (""Daddy,I  don't want to watch this!...Daddy can we go by this!...No, daddy I don't  want to see this! Daddy, where is she now?"")  It would be of great  satisfaction to me if this review would keep other small eyes from being victimized by this garbage and the utterly  deceptive, so-called editorial review.  ""Lost in a big city?""",953510400,22,1769,4.788079470198675
1220301,1,B00000IBKK,"This is a terrible video in which Madeline is abducted by a supposed ""Uncle"". She is taken to a dungeon like setting to make lace from human hair.  Worse, if it can be, Ms. Clavell and the other adults who are  supposed to care for her, just let her go off with this ""Uncle"".  She is betrayed by all the adults, and even by ""family"" in the  person of her ""Uncle"".  My 5 year old was visibly shaken, and we  fast forwarded through the last 30 minutes to Madeline's rescue.  Just a  terrible video, made all the worse because of the previous uplifting  Madeline series.  This is a negative five stars!",952387200,7,599,4.315315315315315
1220302,1,B00000IBKK,"If you are looking for a sweet movie for the younger set, steer clear of this one!  My daughter(4) and I were extremely disappointed in this movie.  Disney describes this movie as ""...full of spirited  fun""and ""...where everyone learns the true meaning of  family"".  Imagine our dismay when Madeline is kidnapped by a man  posing as her Uncle and is taken to a child-labor dungeon where sick little  girls are forced to weave lace with strands cut from their own hair!  My  daughter continues to have nightmares from this movie.  Disney really lost  sight of its viewing audience this time!",946857600,5,590,4.8
7909871,5,B00000IBKK,"I think I find nothing scary about Madeline lost in paris, though it may be a bit dark when I see the madeline getting kidnapped and taken to the basement to work at a lace store, so i think that kids ages six might need to be a little bit careful",1498089600,,247,3.8627450980392157
7909872,5,B00000IBKK,"I love Madeline, I loved when I was little, and I love it now.
It's very rare in this era of ""the birth family is the best place for children"" that we get a movie that says ""family means the people that love you""and that's why people hate this movie. Notice, that most of the bad reviews are written by parents with biological children, and not by parents with adopted children. Just so you know, I was seven when I watched this movie and was not scared by it, because of that I feel like an alien. I am 16 now and can notice the movie's theme, and why the reviews are bad.  This Madeline story, because of its theme, is close to my heart.",1301184000,,639,4.112
7909873,1,B00000IBKK,"My six year old came home from school distraught over this movie. She is in kindergarten and watched it with her class. She was so upset that she cried in class and asked to be excused from watching it the following class. My daughter does not usually get upset easily. She is a ""tomboy"" that prefers Spiderman to Barbie and baseball to baby dolls. When I asked her why it was so upsetting she told me that the girl (Madeline) loses her family and friends and has to live a horrible life. I do not recommend this movie for any young child.",1274227200,,539,4.294117647058823
7909874,1,B00000IBKK,I agree with other reviewers that this is too dark for its intended audience.  Madeline kidnapped to work in a sweatshop?!?!  And to explain about the poor girl she befriends and how she's sick because she's malnourished and never in the sunlight...it was horrible!  I wish I had previewed this one first!  My daughter was so distraught we actually had to let her finish watching it to see that Madeline and the other children were saved in the end and everything was okay.  I threw the video in the trash--no child should see this.,1217116800,,532,4.617021276595745
7909875,4,B00000IBKK,This is a movie about true friendship and courage. Madeline is one my child's favorite characters and enjoys watching the action packed and clever story of our heroine's adventure in Paris.,1145664000,,189,5.129032258064516
7909876,1,B00000IBKK,"My two daughter, ages 6 and 4, are big fans of the Madeline books.  I was extremely surprised at the content of this movie - Madeline is basically kidnapped so she can be forced to work in a dark basement making lace while the kidnappers get her inheritance, she and the other girls in the lace factory are threatened repeatedly that they will ""get all their hair cut off"" as Madame La Croc shoves huge scissors at them, Madeline is thrown in a dungeon, and one young girl in the factory is very sick but isn't allowed medicine or rest.  While I realize Disney movies often have disturbing themes (parents die, dragons, monsters, villians, etc), this movie seems especially disturbing because it shows real violence against the children in the movie.  At one point La Crock chases Madeline and cuts off a chunk of her hair.  Another girl already has had her hair cut off.  There was nothing cute or redeeming about this movie.  I would definately urge parents to view it before showing it to their children.",1140048000,4,1007,4.629213483146067
7909877,3,B00000IBKK,"As a young child, I used to love Madeline. The kindergarten teachers would read us the books at story-time, and I'd watch the cartoon at home. But this movie isn't so happy-go-lucky, in fact, I really don't think parents should let their children 6 and under watch it. It has a very dark theme. It's about how Madeline gets kidnapped, and is forced to work as a slave without pay. They work in a basement with no light, often the children go blind or get sick. You also see little children running about the city by themselves, and you see threats, inappropriate language, you even see someone's pants rip open! I was absolutely shocked when I saw this as a ten-year-old, and I kept thinking to myself, is THIS the type of film parents want to watch with their children? On the plus side, the music is very delightful, and the soundtrack is wonderful to own. But believe me, if you want to introduce a child to orphans and child labour, I suggest you have them see such films as ""A Little Princess"", ""The Secret Garden"", and Disney's ""Annie"". Or if you're a Madeline fan who needs something more childlike and friendly, check out the live-action Madeline movie starring Hatty Jones-that one's worth it.",1029283200,7,1202,4.621495327102804
