This set also includes Wiggle Bay and Wiggly, Wiggly World. Our 2 year old loves the Wiggles, as I am sure most toddlers / preschoolers would. We do lots of Wiggly dancing in our house...it's great entertainment for any family to enjoy together!",1171324800,10,402,4.597222222222222

  Any Wiggles fan should love this set. The choices of DVDs in the set could be a little better, but anything Wiggles pleases my son. I would definitely recommend this set.",1169596800,2,315,4.216666666666667

2619941,5,B000GUJZ3M,The Wiggles are part of my grandson's daily routine.  He dances with the Wiggles and burns off some of his excess energy. It's great entertainment for a two year old.,1169078400,2,166,4.533333333333333
2619942,3,B000GUJZ3M,"This collection has some middling Wiggles programming. One musical guest star DVD, a DVD with ""The Crocodile Hunter"" as a guest, and one set in Wiggle Bay. Compared to some other Wiggles productions, these three are firmly average.",1194480000,,231,5.105263157894737
2619943,4,B000GUJZ3M,"My 22-month-old son loved these movies. He is a huge Wiggle fan. Before these movies he has only watched when they are on TV.

He is always excited to watch when asked about the Wiggles and frequently pulls the box of DVD's out of the shelf and asks to watch.

These are a great tool when helping my 6 year old with 1st grade hoemwork. Anything to keep the baby busy!!!!!",1189987200,,371,4.211267605633803

2619945,5,B000GUJZ3M,My kids have just discovered the wiggles and this box set was great addition to our DVD collection.,1185062400,,99,4.555555555555555
2619946,5,B000GUJZ3M,"My DD loves ""Wiggly, Wiggly Word"" which is one of the cd's you get with this collection. Wiggle Bay and Wiggle Safari go unwatched. Still, it's worth every cent. She loves it- and I love that she loves it.",1182816000,,205,4.282051282051282
2619947,4,B000GUJZ3M,My children - both 2 1/2 - absolutely love the Wiggles and love watching these DVDs.  They can't get enough of them!  I definately recommend these DVD's for young children.,1181520000,,172,4.7
2619948,5,B000GUJZ3M,"This product is fantastic.  My son is obsessed with the Wiggles and we now have three more dvds for him.  Each one is a good length, about an hour, and the variety of music and settings in these three dvds is a nice change from the normal show and other dvds.",1178668800,,259,4.0588235294117645
2619949,4,B000GUJZ3M,Be sure to check out the extras on the DVDs.  One of the DVDs gives you a couple of Wiggles TV shows.,1178409600,,101,3.590909090909091
2619950,5,B000GUJZ3M,"My son loves these videos! He watches them almost every day! His favorite is the Wiggly, Wiggly World but he also really likes Wiggly Safari with Steve Irwin. The whole family is impressed with how well done the videos are!",1178409600,2,223,4.6
2619951,4,B000GUJZ3M,My toddler loves 2 out of the 3 dvds. She is not a big fan of wiggle bay. I think that for the price the merchandise was great.  my only complaint is that we are not familiar with all of the songs on the dvds but we do know most. My child is satisfied with them.,1173571200,,262,3.6785714285714284
8134808,5,B000GUJZ3M,Product came quickly and it was in original package. Extremely happy! Great seller and great product. Price of these 3 videos was comprable to the cost of the most expensive video alone so it was a great buy.,1325548800,,208,4.5
8134809,4,B000GUJZ3M,"My son is a HUGE WIggles fan, so I buy almost everything I can get my hands on to keep it ""fresh"" in our house. These DVD's are good...my son is OBSESSED with Wiggly Wiggle World. It's non-stop songs which is a hit for us. He isn't as into Wiggle Bay (too much acting/talking...he likes the music) and the Safari one is a little depressing for grownups b/c I can't stop thinking about how Steve Irwin died the whole time...seriously. But Wiggly Wiggly World made it worth it for us! I'm sure my son will be more into the safari one eventually as he is getting more & more into animals. I'm glad I have this package for our long car trips to visit family over the holidays!!",1316476800,,673,4.265625
8134810,4,B000GUJZ3M,"Great children's entertainment.  With all the very strange kid shows on these days, I was looking for something that I thought was ""normal"".  I read about these guys on IMDB and found them to be quite interesting.  That said, the musical interaction they offer is ideal, (my opinion) for children.",1288137600,,297,4.9
8134811,5,B000GUJZ3M,"Our son loves the Wiggles - this is a great package, though he definitely likes the songs best in  Wiggly Wiggly World.",1284249600,,119,4.409090909090909

8134813,5,B000GUJZ3M,"Our 1 year old loves this show, and we feel comfortable having it on instead of something violent or scary for her.  We are new to the Wiggles, but we like it.  The music and stuff is even entertaining enough for parents, so it doesn't get annoying or hard to watch.

I sometimes find myself humming some of the songs from these DVDs.

Good, wholesome, entertainment for children.",1200096000,,380,4.544117647058823
8134814,3,B000GUJZ3M,These are a little dated and not quite the same as the Wiggles TV show.  My daughter is not interested in anything on TV but the Wiggles show on Disney so I bought these to have in case we miss the time it is on and want to let her watch it a different time and she isn't as interested in these.  She gets excited but loses interest.  The songs may not be as fast paced and interesting as the ones she is used to.,1197849600,2,413,3.835294117647059
8134815,5,B000GUJZ3M,These DVDs are the only way I can get my baby brother to sit still for more than 2 minutes a day and get him calm enough for ME to be able to relax too :),1197072000,,154,3.3055555555555554
8134816,5,B000GUJZ3M,"So glad we got this collection for my 3 y/o son's birthday. He loves each of the 3 DVDs. Thought we wouldn't get much mileage out of Wiggle Bay and Wiggle Safari, boy was I wrong! We bought it for Wiggly, Wiggly World but appreciate all of the DVDs. Would highly recommend it if your child is into the Wiggles. My child has learned alot about animals, beach volleyball and such. Really a great set together at a cost savings.",1195948800,,425,4.325
8134817,5,B000GUJZ3M,The diversity of this set is great and my daughter loves all three dvds. It keeps her occupied and she loves the adventure and the songs.,1195257600,,137,4.3076923076923075
