8057314,5,B00095NRZG,"The tape starts with the excellent ladder match featuring Razor Ramon at Summerslam 95. It is followed up by a good Yokozuna match from Raw. I saw one before on You Tube from another Raw that was much better. This one was before In Your House against Owen Hart, which is featured on this set, and he tries to interfere to help Yoko but he accidentally spin kicks Yoko and HBK pins him with a super kick. The next match features a Superstars match against Tatanka and they keep on talking about HBK facing Yoko the next night on Raw. I guess the tape isn't in any kind of order. HBK is at his aggorant best, mocking Tatanka. A shocking moment when I saw a kid who could have been no more then seven years old runs up to Tatanka and flips him the double bird. The match was decent, nothing spectular with HBK picking up the win via super kick. We get highlights from his Royal Rumble 95 win then we get the In Your House match against Owen Hart, which is a classic.

Overall, this shows HBK at his cocky, aggorant best and made me realize why I loved WWF back in the early 90's. I got the VHS tape from a thrift store for 50 cents so I got a good deal.",1337385600,,1150,4.111111111111111
8057315,5,B00095NRZG,i loved this movie im a huge HBK fan so anything with him has to be good. some of the matches aren't plyed in there entirety but i still enjoyed it. If you love shawn i recommend this it takes place in 1995 to early 1996 so before he won the title. there is a movie called boyhood dream with his reign as champion that one comes after this one. i liked it there were matches i hadnt seen before and there were a few i had seen. i loved every minuet best birthday present ever. ill leave it up to others though. If you love wrestling and HBK  id watch it.,1304208000,,554,3.9464285714285716
