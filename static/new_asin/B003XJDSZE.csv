4216883,4,B003XJDSZE,"In 2005, the Japanese PC tactical RPG video game ""Tears to Tiara"" was developed by Leaf and then released on the Sony PlayStation 3 console in 2008. It was not long after an anime adaptation of the video game would be shown on Animax Asia and then released by Sentai Filmworks.

""Tears to Tiara"" is produced by White Fox, known for their work on Katanagatari and also their in-between animation work for series such as ""Pokemon: Diamond & Pearl"" and ""Mobile Suit Gundam 00'. The anime series is directed by Tomoyuki Kobayashi (""Ichigo 100%"", ""Rozen Maiden"", ""Utawarerumono"") and a screenplay by Touko Machida (""Lucky Star"", ""Wolf's Rain"", ""Samurai Champloo""). Music is by Takayuki Hattori (""Battle Athletes"" ""Slayers"" films, ""GTO"", ""Sister Princess"") and character designs by Masahiko Nakata (""Utawarerumono, ""Love Hina, ""Sou Nanda"").

Originally released earlier in the year on DVD from Sentai Filmworks with a Japanese soundtrack, the Blu-ray release has now been released and features a brand new English dub.

VIDEO :

At first, I wondered how the animation and art for ""Tears to Tiara"" would be, mainly for the fact that they have not done a major series before but only supplying in-between animation for major anime series.  But overall, animation and art production by WHITE FOX was actually quite solid.  One thing that helps with this series is that the tribe is constantly on the move, so there are a lot of scenes that are new for each episode.  Character designer Masahiko Nakata has had experience working on adventure-based series such as ""Utawarerumono"" but has experience working on anime series such as ""Comic Party"", ""Love Hina"", ""Soul Nanda"" and many other titles.

So, for the most part, I think that the fact that the series has experienced people working on this series and that WHITE FOX is trying to promote their name as a major anime production company, it works in the favor for ""Tears to Tiara"" as the company doesn't have a their artists working on too many titles all at once.  Overall, the animation and art backgrounds are well done and is featured in 1080p High Definition 169 Anamorphic Widescreen.

On the original DVD, I did notice some compression artifacting during some scenes and it appears that on Blu-ray, the series looks much better than its DVD counterpart.  I do wonder if the episodes were split up into three or four discs, would the picture quality be any better?  I did notice some areas where I saw a little artifacting but I was look for haloing and edge enhancement jaggies and I didn't see them.  But overall, picture quality was very good and much better than the DVD.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

As for audio, the series is presented in English and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0.  Dialogue is clear and understandable and found it much better to have my receiver set on stereo on all channels.  Voice acting is well done and a good number of talent with Makoto Ishii, Toru Ohkawa (known for the voice of Roy Mustang from ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" and Rufus Shinra of ""Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children) and Yuki Goto (voice of Mikiru Asahina of ""Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"")  providing the voices of the main characters.  There is more use of surround channels for the second half of the series.  I didn't notice any LFE but for the most part, dialogue is crisp and clear.

As mentioned, the Blu-ray release features a new English dub soundtrack.  And this is where I have a problem with this Blu-ray release.  I am a believer that if you are used to doing British or Scottish accents or born speaking that way, that's great!  But if you are not a native speaker of the language and you don't speak in an accent at all, then don't do it.  Otherwise, forcing yourself to speak with an accent is not going to turn out well.

Earlier I mentioned, The story of ""Tears to Tiara"" is loosely based on the storyline of the Dark Age of Brittania, when the Gaels, Britons, Celts and Scots took on the Roman Empire.  And I figured the ADR made the decision to have the voice talent speak in a British and Scottish accent.  And unfortunately, I felt that the voice talent were not ready for this because some talked as if they went from speaking with an accent to vocals without one.  It didn't work at all.

And as for Arthur...the Scottish accent was not too my liking.  Some other accents for other characters didn't work, it wasn't working and unfortunately, I couldn't listen to the English dub track anymore.  But with that being said, the English voice talent, these are veterans to anime series but when it comes to accents, no veteran is going to get the accent right if they are not used to talking that way for long periods of time and they get a hang of it.  Many actors and actresses for major films are able to immerse themselves in the culture and eventually feel comfortable to speak that way but I'm guessing with schedules, nailing down accents were probably difficult to accomplish in a short amount of time.

Subtitles are featured in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Tears to Tiara"" features the clean opening and closing animation and Sentai Filmworks trailers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

For the first half of ""Tears to Tiara"", the anime series has been quite enjoyable.  It does remind me a lot of ""Watarerumono"" and also a little bit from the OVA series ""Bastard"".  But one thing the series has done well during the first half is establishing storylines for the supporting characters.

Although the first episode featured a good amount of blood and violence, the other character driven episodes are more lighthearted, fun and humorous.  I did enjoy the series and felt the first half was more lighthearted and fun, while the second half of the series became much more serious and in some ways, a different anime series because things become more glum and serious.

I haven't played the previous video games, so I can't comment on how close the anime series is to the video games but I have read that the anime series utilizes the voice actors for the Playstation 3 video game and the adaptation is quite close to the PlayStation 3 video game.  As mentioned earlier, the artwork and animation is quite solid and the anime production studio WHITE FOX did a wonderful job for their first major anime series.

The Blu-ray version of ""Tears to Tiara"" definitely is an improvement over its DVD counterpart.  It still is pretty much barebones in terms of special features but this time, the Blu-ray does feature both lossless soundtracks in English and Japanese.  While I enjoyed the Japanese voice acting tremendously, I can't say the same about the English dub.  Not because it was bad but you can tell the actors felt uncomfortable with their accents.  It's not projected well in the anime series and at times, I felt the talent were going in and out of their accent back to their natural way of speaking.  So, as much as I'm happy to know that the Blu-ray does come with an English dub, it's unfortunate that the poor accents for some of the characters didn't go so well with the series.

Overall, I did enjoy ""Tears to Tiara"".  It's actually a pretty fun, adventure-based anime series in the first half and becomes another kind of beast with it becoming more serious and gloomy for the second half of the series and part of me wanted to see some of that fun, humorous style that I watched in the first 13 episodes.

If anything, Japanese RPG video game fans will more than likely appreciate the series because you can tell there will be many characters but how the writing definitely spends time with certain characters and getting them involved in the series, especially during battle.

But if you are looking for an adventure anime series and also enjoyed series such as ""Utawarerumono"" and ""Bastard"", definitely give ""Tears to Tiara"" a try !",1287619200,25,7795,4.747587230883445

The world of Tears to Tiara has magic, swords, elves, and many more fantasy elements. The story is really good and will keep you guessing episode after episode. The music is also great! It has music for every occasion and I found the music to be extremely memorable. I wish I could find the soundtrack  One last thing that makes Tears to Tiara unique and special is how each episode creates special memories. Each episode is different from the last. One minute you're dealing with a dark tone, the next your in a colosseum. Things range from there every episode is an adventure.",1416009600,,688,4.639344262295082

4216939,5,B003XJDSZE,"Great anime.  Action, comedy, great story.  They borrow from both Christianity and the Greek gods in telling their story but do so subtly.  There are still a lot of questions unanswered halfway into this anime, and I'm looking forward to finding the answers.

The main characters pictured have a lot of style, and at first glance you'd think this was one of those ""harem anime."" Not so. Give it a chance, and you may find that by then end you are pleasantly surprised much as I was.

Caution: not for the little kids, as there is a bit of blood and violence. About PG13.",1410393600,,485,4.388888888888889

4216960,1,B003XJDSZE,"This series is just another formulated anime with all the same faces, uber - powers and the like.  There are a couple of horrific twists that show 'how low' this stuff can go.

One of these twists is the complete 'rip off' of the 'King Arthur' story.  Yep, from name to - the sword in the the stone.  Many of the reviewers of this series are giving it many stars.... is it too much to ask that there to be originality, even demanded in an anime series in order for a reviewer to give it 4 or 5 stars?

Finally, this series mocks (to a disturbing degree) Judeo/Christian beliefs.  Some other reviewers picked up on it as well, but I must say it was bothersome to put it lightly.  It casts Lucifer as a hero, just trying to help humans free their minds and believe in themselves.  It casts Heaven as the enemy, interested only on enslaving, imprisoning and destroying humans. Hmmm....OoooKaaaay.... I see.  -nuff said.

Morobito should be the standard of anime, sadly the majority of anime is very formulated with the same characters/faces cast in mirrored roles, all with uber-power before they reach adolescence.",1391904000,12,1112,4.627551020408164

4216963,5,B003XJDSZE,"This was a strange but entertaining twist of Arthurian legend with some Judeo/Christian and mythical references, some Lord of the Rings, and I'm sure many others I just am too unknowledgeable to recognize. I finished this off in a week -- pretty extreme if you consider there are 26 20 minute episodes (if you skip the opening and closing credits). The first episode is the ""Demon King Revival"" whose ""true"" name is a not-too-unexpected surprise, and he's one of the good guys. The story takes a John Lennon like twist of religion and myth that black is white and white is black and the sense that religion and covenants are a perversion of the true sense of man, and that we need to believe in ourselves first and foremost.

Sounds strange but it draws you in as you get lost in the charm of the tapestry of the story as it unfolds.",1387065600,2,833,4.480263157894737

Some of the subtitles were a bit tricky because their translation wasn't quite right.  But, overall, it was an interesting way to pass the time.",1385596800,,322,4.517241379310345
4216966,1,B003XJDSZE,"I thought this would be good, but Sentai really let loose a tsunami of bad dubbing, story, and animation.  Plus the price is obscenely high for such inferior anime.  I could elaborate on the silly Scottish accents, the stupidest plot ever, the main hero is the devil, have I said enough?

4216972,2,B003XJDSZE,...but it's so DULL.  I can usually do slow-paced productions; I lived in Japan for three years and I'm used to their occassional plodding plotlines.  But this was beyond my patience.  I gave up about three-quarters of the way through the season.  I give it two stars because I like the originality of the concept.,1373068800,,314,4.654545454545454

4216979,5,B003XJDSZE,The action inside removed all doubt in the dedication of the crew who made this series.

4216982,4,B003XJDSZE,"This is a review on the Amazon Instant Video version of Tears to Tiara. It has English subtitles with the original Japanese audio. Overall this is a pretty good anime series. The first 18 episodes are really well done but the pace seems to slow down after EP 18 and never really recover until the end. I would rate the first 18 EPs 4.5 to 5 stars. The story and character development are good and even sometimes quite touching. At times, I felt like watching an anime version of Lord of the Rings.  Unfortunately, after reaching the climax in EP18, it rushed to the end with a fairly predictable ending. I would rate EP19-26 good but not great. (3 stars) So overall I would give the seris 4 stars.",1359417600,2,697,4.403100775193798
4216983,5,B003XJDSZE,I have seen many fantasy anime and many of them are sketchy at best. Japanese anime is a great mode of storytelling but it always seems to have trouble with a classic fantasy setting. This anime however does a fantastic job of blending Japanese anime storytelling with a Tolkien type of setting. This is a great show for fantasy and anime fans alike.,1353024000,2,350,4.571428571428571
4216984,1,B003XJDSZE,might be worth watching if they come ip with a dubbed version. Until they do if i want to read I will read a book,1348272000,8,113,3.56
4216985,5,B003XJDSZE,"I like sorcery anime's with abit of hack and slash like Slayers and this is no exception, but I feel the dub takes the accent thing abit too far, but that's only a minor detail, the main character having all the women around him falling head over heels for him is intresting as well^^",1333843200,4,284,4.277777777777778

4216987,4,B003XJDSZE,"On the isle of Erin (Ireland) during the medieval era, there lived a tribe called the Gaels lead by the brother and sister team of Arthur and Riannon. One day while most of the village was out on a hunt, Riannon gets captured by the Goidelic people to be used as a sacrifice to revive the Demon King Arawn. Unfortunately for the summoners, upon awakening, Arawn decides side with Riannon instead of eating her. He then joins the Gael clan as their leader in the rebellion against the Divine Empire (Rome).

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this show. After I started watching it I found it was based on an Ero game and wondered if I was setting myself up for disappointment by continuing to watch it. But I was enamored by the often terrible accents and by Arawn, who continued to be an interesting and likable character throughout the series. The accents were darn fun to listen too, and they did get better as the actors got used to speaking with them. Riannon and Arawn were the worst offenders, but by the end of the series Riannon had one of the best accents, though Arawn was still inconsistent. Fortunately with Arawn, he speaks with such a light accent you almost don't notice when he stops using it for a bit.

The accents were my favorite part of the series, but even they wouldn't have been enough if the story had been bad. But the story was actually quite entertaining and surprisingly well developed. It is drenched with Welsh and Gaelic mythology with its own unique twists. As I said before, Arawn is a great character and surprisingly, Arthur is too. I even grew to like Riannon. Most of the rest of the cast is disposable and could have easily been cut out entirely *cough* all of the elves *cough*.

For a show based on an Ero game, I expected more romance and fanservice. I was pleased to see both kept to a minimum. Morgen is very scantly clad and Llyr's top rather form fitting, but this is about all the fanservice there was. And despite Riannon's obvious attachment to Arawn, nothing ever happens between them. I admit I found it quite weird, but refreshing.

There was plenty about this series I didn't much care for *cough* all of the elves *cough*, but the good outweighed the bad and I am glad that I watched it to the end. If you have any interest in Welsh and Gaelic mythology and don't mind a bunch of whiny cutesy elves, then I recommend giving this series a shot. And make sure to give the English dub at least one episode :)",1303084800,5,2463,4.442477876106195
4216988,5,B003XJDSZE,"First of all the description of this anime is WRONG....The series IS ENGLISH DUB,not just Japanese audio. That was keeping me from buying this until I clicked the image of the collection and noticed it on the back of the case, I am now going to buy this series since I just found out and hope you do the same.",1297728000,13,309,4.166666666666667
4216989,4,B003XJDSZE,"I am pretty far into this anime set as of writing this.  The story is great so far, but I have to give only 4 stars for two reasons. One is the artifacting on the solid colors throughout the animation.  It usually isn't a big enough deal for me to write about it or give a lower rating, but it really shows on this particular blu-ray more than others I have watched recently.  The only other thing that bugs me are the voice acting with face Irish accents.  Words are not pronounced the same way consistently and it gets a little annoying.  Both of those are minor complaints and nothing that would keep me from purchasing it had I known about them beforehand. I think regular accents would have been just fine since the story can hold its own and all of the non-accented voices are fine.  If you like good characters and a good story, pick it up.  You will enjoy it.",1295308800,3,867,4.282208588957055

4216991,4,B003XJDSZE,"Tears to Tiara won't be the best anime series you ever see, but it is definitely worth watching for a variety of reasons. Leaf, who designed the game from which the TV series was developed, has a knack for putting together interesting worlds and populating them with enjoyable characters. Unlike its cousin, Utawarerumono, the storyline doesn't get out of control at the end. However, the characters, while definitely enjoyable, are not quite as robust as those in Utawarerumono. but there are a few reasons that this series is definitely worth watching.

1. The use of mythical elements from a variety of western cultural contexts is incredibly fun. Images, objects and characters from the Arthurian legends, Celtic mytho-historical traditions, Roman and Greek mythology, and a host of others are woven together skilfully. I learned a lot, especially about Briton and Celtic mythology, simply by Googling names of characters and objects in the story. My only problem here is with the way the name Lucifer is used. It simply has too strong a connotation to be used so arbitrarily.

2. This is simply good fantasy. There are classic struggles, great battles, heroes and villains and even honorable enemies. It has an epic feel that is engrossing.

3. While not all the characters are deep and engaging (and some are downright annoying), there are a few that are truly fun to watch grow and change throughout the story. And I like the character Arawn far more than his counterpart in Utawarerumono. But Arthur, Rhiannon, Taliesin, Octavia and a host of others are given endearing character arcs.

Again, if you are expecting the best anime experience EVER...this won't be it. but if you want to watch something that you will enjoy and may learn a lot from, this is a pretty good choice.",1293321600,3,1784,4.956521739130435
4216992,5,B003XJDSZE,Tears to Tiara enchanted me when I first watched it. Even the title is captivating. There are good battle scenes and mystic elements that will keep you glued to your seat. The characters' personalities fit their roles perfectly. And the plot itself will make you want to watch everything in one go.,1290038400,3,298,4.75
4216993,3,B003XJDSZE,"I could rant on and on about this, but I'm going to make this quick.  If you plan on watching this with the original Japanese soundtrack, it's a great series and the fact that it's Blu-ray only makes it better.
BUT
If you plan on watching this with the English dub, prepare to have your ears RAPED.  I couldn't watch this for more than a minute in english without getting a headache.  So I skipped around and check the voices of the majority of the relevant characters.  It really enrages me how they could take such a great series and dub it so incredibly crappily (""Crappily"" is now an official word, by the way, created solely to describe the English dubbing of this series).  Arawn sounds like a WEAKLING for crying out loud.  And the Scottish/Irish accent that Arthur has should be against the rules or something.
That said, Sentai Filmworks never did produce the same quality of dubs as FUNimation, but this is just a blatant insult to the source material and everyone who took part in the creation of it.  Kinda like the 4Kids version of One Piece.",1287964800,10,1055,4.521052631578947
