1389559,4,B0000524F7,"At my local video store I rented something that purported itself to be ""Thunderbirds.""  It turned out to be horribly edited and the voices had been overdubbed.  I was appalled. Now, the REAL Thunderbirds episodes are available in the USA and this country is in for a unique treat.  Okay, many of you won't understand the allure of this mid-60's English puppet sci-fi program.  But for anyone in their late 30's/early 40's who grew up in England, this was an essential part of our TV culture.
The visual effects director, by the way, was Derek Meddings who did many of the special effects for the early James Bond movies.  Now, A&E, how about ""Captain Scarlet""???",976665600,20,662,4.721739130434782
1389560,5,B0000524F7,"The price is pretty reasonable I picked this up for $5 with shipping. I recently watched two Thunderbird movies so I decided to buy the season episodes. I am unfamiliar with the show so that is why i decided to purchase this. This comes with two DVDs and a total of about 300 minutes. The package arrived sealed and in new condition I am happy with my purchase. If you are like me and you've never actually watched the episodes or if you used to watch the show as a kid, I would recommend that you purchase this. This is a pretty sweet deal.",1323993600,,541,4.211538461538462
1389561,5,B0000524F7,"Heck of a lot of fun watching this as a child, and still entertaining as far as I'm concerned. Corny and hokey, but it's puppets for gawsh sakes.... and they save the world all the time....with all those cool gadgets and gizmos...

1389562,5,B0000524F7,"Thunderbirds is simply one of the best childrens TV (although my Dad loved it) programs ever made. To be honest I'm not sure now whether it was made with children specifically in mind or not.

Watching it now on DVD it remains fantastic even to my 40something eyes. The picture quality is great, it has dolby 5.1 surround sound and fortunately as it is set in 2065 you can't say well that never happened (like Space 1999 for example). All the best things about Thunderbirds still remain the best. The superb opening credits sequence with the preview of the forthcoming episode. Barry Grays marvellous music and the superb puppets and models that became a trademark for Gerry Andersons productions.

The episodes on this disc are a fair representation of the whole series, with perhaps the Pit of Peril being my favourite - remember the 'Sidewinder'? The DVD has a few interesting extras including a printable CD-Rom Thunderbird 1 cross-section. Shame that there isn't a commentary (which there is on some of the Captain Scarlet DVD's) but the episodes alone make this worth getting. FAB.",1186012800,,1087,4.9021739130434785

1389564,5,B0000524F7,"Yes, yes, yes ... dunderklumpen Parker is tripping all over his cockney vowels and Tintin (the non-francophone version) is demurely aiding (wink, wink) Alan, but how can you resist a world where technology is always fallible (planes exploding, reactors exploding, grandma exploding - just kidding) yet can only be saved by the same, now infallible, technology. A feature film with non-stringy actors is being made of this series - it's a guaranteed flop already. You can't tell these stories today with the wide-eyed enthusiasm of thirty years ago. Also, when Thunderbirds was made, the directors were making mini-feature-films. Now, alas, even our biggest films are made to play on TV, just like a movie-of-the-week. It'll look like a Star Trek episode - neat, clean-cut and sanitary with all the soul sucked out of its CGI animated pores. What it won't have is Lord Lew Grade sitting behind it, marvelling at its imagination, egging on its producer, giggling like a large cherubic baby. The original can't be anything other than FAB - a Fully Aknowledged Broadcast.",1047340800,3,1067,5.102857142857143
1389565,5,B0000524F7,"I grew up on Thunderbirds and loved every minute of it.  To see the shows rendered in DVD quality picture and sound provides an awesome viewing experience, especially if you have surround sound with a good sub-woofer!  The explosions and the Thunderbird launches sound incredible.  Highly recommended as are all the other Thunderbirds DVDs in the series.",1044403200,,354,5.175438596491228
1389566,4,B0000524F7,"This series bring back memories of my childhood, an epoch that lives in the past never to resurface again, an epoch of mindless fun, carelessness and true feelings and emotions. An era of innocence and purity. Sigh.... Sigh....",1035331200,2,227,5.0
1389567,5,B0000524F7,"this 1st set is a must have for Thunderbirds fans! if you only
buy one set you should get this one for sure ! actually set 1 & 2 are my favorite ! the sound and color are crisp and clear like
it was made yesterday ! it's a real classic.",1033171200,3,236,3.6470588235294117
1389568,5,B0000524F7,"It was the 1960s-- Stereotypes still existed, bad guys were obviously bad, good guys were obviously good.  The Thunderbirds were obviously good guys, and obviously marionettes.  The Anderson special effects are very good, even if some of the underwater scenes were obviously shot through an aquarium!  The DVD captures all the nuances of the show, including the strings!  (:  The plots are at least as good as a James Bond flick.
Remember that the Andersons and ITC went on to do UFO and SPACE:1999.  The special effects on these live action shows were of the same style as on the Thunderbirds (except the strings were easier to hide in space!).  I kept thinking that UFO and SPACE:1999 ought to have splashed the ""SUPERMARIONATION"" logo on the screen!",1028332800,2,752,4.874015748031496
1389569,5,B0000524F7,"I never realized that my favorite kiddie shows were all done by the same person - T-birds, Fireball XL5, Stingray, etc. This first set is great. I was pleasantly surprised at how well the episodes held up - and how often the ideas have been copied. Yea, the effects are cheesy, the ""acting"" over the top, and the overall effect campy, but it's 60's TV. It was in COLOR. It was in Supermarionation. It even had sound.  And strings. And plenty of fire. What else could a kid ask for?  If you even liked the series, you'll enjoy this memory-trip.",1012521600,4,543,4.42
1389570,5,B0000524F7,"Money well spent, definitely. This DVD set is very impressive on all counts and truly packed (over 5 hours of entertainment!). Back in the mid 60's, THUNDERBIRDS were huge on Brazilian prime time television. I used to sit in the living-room with my father and younger brother, hypnotized by the show, although at the time we only had black and white TV in my country. Now, over thirty-five years later, I can't help but wonder at the  cool perfection of the whole enterprise, the complete devotion and seriousness of the producing team -- so much care and talent in every little detail. Make no mistake, this is no nostalgia lure, it is still really thrilling and magical with that kind of pure Zen pleasure in its optimistic display of futuristic technology and gadgetry without a trace of the cynicism and irony that prevail lately. In fact, these remarkable puppets look and act far better than many a real-life actor today. The soundtrack and music score are also of the highest standards, the picture quality a delight.",1009411200,10,1024,4.818181818181818
1389571,4,B0000524F7,"This is truly a great adventure series. I am from New Zealand and grew up with the Tracy family and their Thunderbirds aircraft and International Rescue outfit. Considering that it is nearly 35 years old the spacial effects are still impressive. I recently purchased the set 1 and 2 for my 6yr old son as a nostalga trip to my childhood so as to share some of my past with him. He is now hooked on the series and loves it. For Christmas I purchased the Thunderbird aircraft (made by matchbox) thru E-Bay and he was thrilled.
I am sure that this will appeal to any young child. Good always gets the upper hand over evil and the plots are easy to follow but to a young person still have plenty of action and adventure. The puppetry is great and every now and then you can spot the strings which adds to the nostalga without detracting from the appeal. In a world that is crying out for heros who selflessly seek to help others I feel this is a great example.
Alltogether a good program for both children and even enjoyed by many adults, especially myself.",1009238400,2,1053,4.377551020408164
1389572,4,B0000524F7,"I have been a big fan of this U.K. television series from the 1960's for years, and I spent a considerable sum of money just to get the original episodes on VHS imported to the U.S.  Some of the prints used for these videos were in bad shape, but I didn't care since this was the only way for me to see them.  Not anymore!  I got this set (along with a DVD player) as a gift and I must say that I am impressed with the quality of these DVDs (two in the set).  The image quality is very crisp and clear and the colors are very vibrant.  I have read some reviews where people wished they had digitally removed the puppet strings but I didn't find this to be a major issue.  The special features such as the ""Making of Thunderbirds"" featurette and the gallery of productions stills are great, but I wish there had been some audio commentary and/or video interviews with Gerry Anderson, whom I consider to be the British version of George Lucas. As for the re-mastered soundtrack, you definitely feel the effect of the explosions, but they stand out too much from the rest of the audio (i.e. the volume is really LOUD compared to the other audio elements).  I would have preferred hearing the original sound mix, or at least having the option to choose the original sound or the remastered version.  Overall, I think Thunderbirds fans will be happy with this set.  Hopefully, all of the episodes will be released on DVD in the near future.  THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO!",1004054400,6,1457,4.4232209737827715
1389573,5,B0000524F7,"This is amazing stuff! You will see great vision & imagination
that now is hard to find. Parents-do not fear this series:
Kids will be shown the high value placed on human life, as well as family values a.k.a. the Tracy Family, something missing in todays single-parent households. This is not mindless violence or pokemon' drivel, this is adventure presented on an intelligent level.",999388800,,384,5.015625
1389574,4,B0000524F7,"This is a follow-up to my first review of this set, as I neglected to comment on the other four episodes within.
City Of Fire - The Towering Inferno in miniature, as a ten thousand foot tall skyscraper that serves as a monster shopping mall is opened to considerable TV coverage via a hoverjet TV remote.  When a woman's foot slips off her brake onto the accelerator, her car plows into parked vehicles, and as the couple on board make for safety, their car explodes and detonates other vehicles within a four-mile-long underground lot.  IR is called in as the fire overwhelms all safety systems within the building and ultimately collapses the building - trapping a family of three in a corridor with firedoors stalled shut.  Scott and Virgil must cut through firedoors - and must do so with a cutting gas that knocked them unconscious in testing.
There are admittedly nits to pick here - that they would use a cutting gas that knocked them out is a huge stretch, as is the notion that a regular car crash would set off a fire so large as to overwhelm a ten thousand floor skyscraper's safety systems.  Still, the episode is a treat.
Sunprobe - Thunderbirds in space, as an audacious space mission - to collect energy matter from the sun - goes wrong.  Thunderbird Three with Alan, Tin-Tin, and Scott is launched to fire a radio beam to ignite the Sunprobe's retrothrusters, which have been shut off due to solar radiation.  They succeed in saving the Sunprobe, but the real horror begins when Thunderbird Three cannot fire its own retros, and Virgil and Brains must use a vastly powerful mobile transmitter on a ice-covered mountaintop to send a similar radio beam - a task made harder as parameter changes must be calculated out, a task that may take too long.
The Uninvited - This is a break from the standard rescue formula, as Scott is shot down by mysterious fighters over the Egyptian desert and is found by two bickering archeologists seeking a lost pyramid - a search that leads them and Scott to more trouble.
The Mighty Atom - The Hood is back.  In a flashback sequence to before the launching of International Rescue, he must sabotage a nuclear powerplant in the Australian outback that is powering a desert reclamation project - a project that desalinates oceanwater and pumps it into the desert, thus breeding plantlife.  When a firefight detonates part of the pump system, the resulting fire spreads with terrifying speed - and shutdown attempts fail as they cannot cut off the ocean intake.  The plant explodes in a frightening fireball (and I mean genuinely frightening), that releases a cloud of radiation that threatens Melbourne.  The cloud sequence is genuinely scary in its own right as series composer Barry Gray uses synythesizers and a choir to create a tremendously effective aura of death as the cloud rolls forward before shifting winds break it up and save Melbourne.
The opening act of the episode leaves the viewer already exhausted, so the ensuing three acts are inevitably something of a disappointment, though not all that much.  The Mighty Atom is a toy mouse - one that can photograph computer consoles and other important databanks where other espionage means cannot succeed.  The Hood uses the mouse to spy on another nuclear-powered desert reclamation project, then sabotages it to bring out IR.",998352000,,3335,4.8213660245183885
1389575,5,B0000524F7,My husband watched this when he was a child and loved it so we bought it for our five year old.  He absolutely loves it.  We also have the toy vehicles. Every boy who sees the toys and movies are mesmerized.  They all love them.  It captures their imagination and takes them on a rescue adventure.  I would recomend these movies to any boy - child or adult!,998006400,5,357,4.1911764705882355
1389576,5,B0000524F7,"In terms of fun, I really love it.  The puppet animimation does not distract from the stories, which are in fact, pretty cool.  As a 34 year old boy, these stories hearken me back to when I was a 12 year old boy.  It is a little bit like the ABC cartoon Reboot, in that you can tell the characters aren't real, but a few minutes after you forget about the drawing or puppets, and start to believe that these people exist.
My 11 year old daughter however finds them quit boring, and would rather clean her room that watch them.",997574400,,526,4.188118811881188
1389577,5,B0000524F7,"Whenever my kids ( 8 and 6 years old) and their friends want to watch a movie I recommend the Thunderbirds.  You can't loose, it's a puppet show, so there is no expectations.  But without fail these kids react just as I did when I first watched it when I was their age.  Fascination.  I loved it and the children today do also.  It just a simple, very fun action packed show.  You can't go wrong.",992908800,4,396,4.144736842105263
1389578,4,B0000524F7,"As a child in England I would race home from school, eat my food and settle down in front of the television set for the latest Gerry Anderson epic production whether it was Torchy the battery boy, Fireball XL5. or in later years UFO and Space 1999. Forget the sixties music, what about the sixties science fiction.
Thunderbirds to me is the pivotal Gerry Anderson production. Whatever was to come later from ""SUPERMARIONATION"" albeit Joe 90 or Captain Scarlet (always a personal favourite), or involving real people Thunderbirds marked the turning point.
Until that time the shows involved single setting stories but with Thunderbirds it was clear that this was a much more ambitious project. Not only was the scope of Anderson's concept much grander but the concept itself was transformed into something much more sophisticated than a simple battle between good and evil. The two dimensional characters assumed a greater depth and complexity. The future as seen by Anderson was no longer purely technologically advanced but was darker and more threatening than any future he had previosly painted. The need for secrecy and the repeating them of being in disguise postulated a society threatened by potential terrorists epitomised by the Hood, of unmistaken Asian origin.
From here, following Thunderbirds success both on television and on the big screen, the Andersons went on to develop their creations in a much bigger way. While the shows were state of the art puppeteering, the stories were better and ran for an hour rather than thirty minutes, the machines were once pure fantasy and yet...
Thunderbirds on DVD is a great idea. Perhaps running them on television would be a better one. Perhaps running a number of the Anderson creations a better one still. Gerry Anderson, like Arthur C. Clarke before him, is another of those prescient men for whom their time has come.
P.S. They are fun to watch too",988675200,10,1908,5.00314465408805
1389579,3,B0000524F7,"Yeah, a Thunderbirds dvd box set sounds really cool, but I believe that anyone interested in buying this set has already a couple of tapes at home with episodes recordings (commercially released and/or TV recorded) ...So beside the expected good quality of image and sound, the appeal of a DVD box set is realy the ""supplemental material"" ...Which in this case,is NOT as expected. Just consider that recently a U.K based magazine has given away with it's December 2000 issue,an excellent documentary on T-Birds called ""The Thunderbirds companion"" , on a DVD-Rom over 53 minutes long !) ...so I think that a 5 minute look back on the making of thunderbirds,with pictures that are not that interesting, is really not appealing to the real fan. So, I think that the producer of this set should really consider a better ""supplemental matierial"" package for future releases. Eric",988156800,4,874,4.993150684931507
1389585,5,B0000524F7,"I have been waiting for the American market to get with it and realize what the Brits have known all along -- this show rocks! All right, so our heroes display occasional moral lapses in killing villains (shouldn't Scott be a little bothered with what happens to the Zombites in ""The Uninvited,"" even if they did shoot down TB1?). Still, the subtext of slow-paced geeky technology used pretty methodically to save people's lives is great. And everything looks and sounds wonderful with the new remastering. This show was certainly ahead of its time and absolutely indispensible to those of us who grew up with it. In addition to all of the fun of seeing these episodes again, it's pretty interesting to see where technology has advanced farther than in the Thunderbirds' world and where it still lags far behind. Keep releasing these sets, Carlton and A&E. They're FAB!",986169600,7,869,4.878378378378378
1389586,4,B0000524F7,"From the bold, exciting music, to the coolest rockets, jets, and every other kind of vehicle to ever grace the screen, Thunderbirds was a show I dearly loved as a kid (here in the States, no less).  While the scripting is -- well, let's face it, it *was* a kiddy show, so the scripting is a bit juvenile, but man, even with occasional wobbles and visible strings, the various vehicles *still* have a modern look to them, nearly (gasp) 40 years later.  The Andersons went on from this to live action shows, and I do have a soft spot as well for both _Stingray_ and _Fireball XL-5_ before this, and _UFO_ and _Space: 1999_ after, but _Thunderbirds_ remains at the top of the heap.  I have no idea how this will hold up for folks who don't have that nostalgic gleam in their eye, but I enjoyed the first set enough that I'm going for the second.  Thunderbirds are Go!",985132800,7,864,4.38125
1389587,5,B0000524F7,"A wonderful transfer, nostalgic, all that ... but more than anything else this is a template for how childrens TV should be.
After watching a few episodes the format is clear: Some complex endeavour has failed. Those in charge, army generals, flight controllers and skyscraper managers attempt a correction. They are not bumblers and their heroics are serious even though they don't succeed. When International Rescue comes in, they have to work at it too, preparing, organizing. Nothing comes easy; the puppets even sweat!
Anyone who watches this show will come to understand that technology by itself is not a panacea, that it requires painstaking care and human oversight, that it often fails, and that it takes time to get things done, thus teaching the need for patience and persistence, something we tend to forget about in this day and age of ""internet time"".",985132800,2,866,5.020833333333333

I have enjoyed them all again. Where is the time they made a  weekly 1 hour series?
What I hadn't counted on is that my 3.5 yr old son is now  running through the hallways yelling: ""Thunderbirds are GO!!""
The hardest task now is to find the rest of the series  (it seems only 1 and 2 are on DVD in the US) and finding Thunderbird toys.. any hints?

1389589,5,B0000524F7,"I loved these shows as a kid, so seeing them again thirty years later is very interesting. How much of my values were unconsciously picked up from these shows? (Lady Penelope operating as an independent women, with a male servant no less; the belief that superior technology can get you out of the tightest scrapes, and so on...).
 As a child the shows seemed perfect, so as I inserted the first disk I wondered how they would look now. I was surprised that the model making and puppet characters still look great. The strings weren't as intrusive as I had feared. The technological forecast was off the mark in some respects, of course. (Tin-Tin is seen using a typewriter, not an iMac!). Some things I appreciate even more now than then. (Barry Gary's music, the Frank Lloyd Wright-esque architecture of Tracy Island.)
Equally surprising is that the plots seemed so logical then, but were in fact so full of holes. Why send The Mole down to retrieve Virgil from the Pit of Peril when the helicopter winch would have done? (To show off The Mole, of course!) How could two tiny tracked vehicles pull the 500 ton Sidewinder out of said pit? (They couldn't.)
No matter. The shows were and are one of the twin peaks of the Andersons' genius. (UFO was the other.) I hope children a thousand years hence (and adults who loved them when they were children) can watch them and smile too.",984268800,,1380,4.609756097560975
