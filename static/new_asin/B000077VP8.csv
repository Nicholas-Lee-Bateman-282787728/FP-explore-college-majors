7974275,3,B000077VP8,"Another reviewer mentioned the low quality footage of this DVD. That doesn't bother me too much - the picture is clear enough to get the point across.

This DVD did have a few useful tips - I did learn a few things. But only about 7 or 8 of the ""60 Tips"" were relevant to me. There was no advice here regarding water skiing or fishing safety.

And, there really weren't 60 tips (i.e., Tip #1 is Be Careful, Tip #2 is Different Sized Boats Behave Differently).

Also, about 1/3 of the tips were about dual engine boats, which didn't apply to me. And, another 1/3 of the tips deal with leaving the dock/slip. I don't have a dual engine boat, or a slip, so none of this was useful to me.

But if you are fairly new to boating, have a dual engine or larger boat, and experience a lot of traffic in the marina, there would be a lot of useful information here for you.",1256428800,,862,4.1437125748503
7974276,3,B000077VP8,"This is basically just a dubbing of a VHS tape onto a DVD.  There's only a rudimentary set of chapters encompassing dozens of tips together.  The instructions offered, however, are worthwhile.  It does a pretty good job of showing you some important steps in handling your boat.  You just have to ignore the horrible video quality.

If they'd re-shoot this using the same script and put a decent DVD menu on it they'd have a real winner.

If you can buy it used somewhere cheap it's worth picking up, but new?  No.",1173830400,2,514,4.521739130434782
