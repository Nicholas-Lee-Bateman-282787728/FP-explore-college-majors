8345762,5,B001V7YZCA,I enjoyed the Affairs of the Heart. I already had Series 1. I hope there will be a series 3.,1459728000,,92,3.65
8345763,3,B001V7YZCA,"I love Henry James stories and there are definitely great actors in this set Derek Jacobi, Eileen Atkins among other that if you love Brit movies and Masterpiece on PBS you'll recognize. Interesting development as they've taken six adaptations of Henry James work and turned each into 1 hour episodes with various actors. I'm glad I bought it...I was just surprised that given my usual enthusiasm for such things I wasn't more ""blown away"" then again maybe it was the fact that it had been filmed in the 1974 and released as a DVD in
2009...and by now with Blu-ray and HDTV I'm just used to brighter, shiny, images. Will have to watch it a few more times to see if it grows on me...as I noticed a few other reviewers gave it a 5. But somehow this set stands out as I've several DVD's of older movies as well as series such as The Original Upstairs Downstairs that haven't left me so flat so maybe it's not a production thing at all.
If you can find it used and cheap it's definitely worth trying.",1390348800,6,996,4.389189189189189

8345766,5,B001V7YZCA,"The actors are excellent, and while it is obvious all filming was done in the studio, the costumes and sets are splendid evocations of the times of the stories. The adaptation of 'Daisy Miller' is a good thumbnail of the novella. The other stories are unfamiliar to me in their original form but they all are dramatically convincing.

It's also enjoyable to see so many veteran actors like Eileen Atkins, Edward Hardwick, Daniel Massey & Derek Jacobi in their younger days!

8345767,5,B001V7YZCA,"6 BRITISH UPPER CLASS ROMANTIC COMEDIES, intellectual in spirit. Fantastic film versions of 6 more Henry James tales. Surprise endings, like mystery; romantic, like Austen. A Victorian immersion perfection including architecture, costumes, interior furnishings, manners/speech, and of course...
cleavage.
Where Victorian romance meets London socialite genre humor. Yes, actually some laugh-out-loud moments in these romances of the past.

There is a fantastic list of super-stars in these performances, 12 of which have filographies as bonus material.  They include Cheryl Campbell, Jeremy Clyde, Sinead Cusack, Christopher Cazenove, Eileen Atkins, Michael Bryant, Richard Morant, Barbara Murray, Georgina Hale, Daniel Massey, Diane Cilento, & Edward Hardwicke.
Bonus stuff also has a Henry James biography. American born James eventually settled in London and wrote ""Daisy Miller"" included in this DVD adaptations set. 6 individual stories, about 50 minutes each. Great TV-dinner theater.

Fun period stories, which never go out of date, and always with the climatic endings by James, where all does not unfailingly end happily ever after, but can at times. He keeps you guessing.  Of course, you'll want to get the first series as well, after seeing this second set.  See my review for ""AFFAIRS of the HEART SERIES ONE"".

If interested, here's the details:
_____Episode 1: EMMA (based on the novel ""Lord Beauprey"")
Preferring bachelorhood, Guy (Jeremy Clyde) suddenly inherits a title and fortune. Lord Guy Beauprey is frightfully (and comically) besieged by eligible females, some with pushy mother's at their heels.  He begs lifelong friend, Emma (Cheryl Campbell), for a fictitious engagement arrangement. But she has her own American suitor. What will become of Emma's true feelings?
_____Episode 2: BESSIE (based on ""An International Episode"")
Lord James Lambeth (Christopher Cazenove), visits NY in the heat of summer with cousin Percy on business. They visit in cooler Newport, at the home of a wealthy NY businessman, hosted by wife Kitty (Anna Palk) and her sister Bessie (Sinead Cusack). Bessie, with her romantic novel intellect, pursues Lord Lambeth on both sides of the Atlantic. She's opposed by Lambeth's mother, Duchess of Bayswater.  Will Cupid's international arrow strike its mark?
_____Episode 3: KATE (based on ""The Bench of Desolation""D)
Herbert Dodd (Michael Bryant) ends an engagement with Kate (Eileen Atkins) and begins a family with Nan.  After years of paying Kate in an out-of-court settlement, Dodd loses his family to deaths. Kate returns, rich, flaunting what she made of the last of Dodd's money.  Herbert plots different forms of revenge. Will Kate's own plan prevail?
_____Episode 4: DAISY (based on ""Daisy Miller"")
Action begins in Switzerland and moves to Italy as American traveler Daisy (Gorgina Hale) 'plays' with the men around her. She leaves Frederick (Daniel Massey) puzzled as to her intentions, her impropriety, and snobbish rudeness. ""I'm a fearful frightful flirt,"" Daisy admits to Frederick. What will Rome give Daisy?
_____Episode 5: LEONIE (based on ""Nona Vincent"")
Leonie (Barbara Murray) secretly finances her young lover's mediocre play. Allan (Richard Morant) fails to see the chosen lead actress is falling in love with him. Will the play be successful? Will romance?
_____Episode 6: ELIZABETH (based on ""The Great Condition"")
Henry (Edward Hardwicke) and Bertie (Derek Jacobi) vie for the attentions of a just-met aboard ship mysterious Midwest American woman. Beauty and a widow is about all they know about her.  Although good friends, the two men spar verbally (comically) about the girl. What secret has Elizabeth withheld? Which will win her favor?

Sorry for this long review, but there is lots of delightful, fun, watching in this set.
I don't just recommend ""AFFAIRS OF THE HEART SERIES TWO"" at 5-stars, but I also recommend the beginning set, ""AFFAIRS OF THE HEART SERIES ONE,"" also worthy of 5-stars. Romance viewing for couples, because even the guys can get into these stories. Classics, not chic-flicks.

Order a six-pack of microwave popcorn at the same time you order this DVD set.",1249171200,32,4155,5.423255813953489
