6798056,5,B00PEA6K0A,"I originally saw this movie on TV as a kid back around 1977, or so. It was probably on KTVU out of Oakland because they also showed episodes of Ultraman on Captain Cosmic's show. I vividly remember watching this because it was unlike ANYTHING I'd ever seen before (in all my 6 years). The hero seemed about my age and faced all kinds of scary situations with bravery... but it was Hilda who really freaked me out. The image of her sitting on top of a pole or dead tree really haunted me.
Anyway, I had no idea what the name of this movie was. I flipped through the TV guide that week and it wasn't listed, which often happened when programs were substituted last-minute. So, I watched a decent amount of anime, made friends with people who had seen way more anime than me, asked around... no one had any idea what I was talking about. Finally, Google came along and I'd do a Google search using words like, ""anime, alone boy, giant fish"" and nothing would come up...
Until this December, when I searched Google again and it took me to Amazon's page announcing pre-sale of Hols/Horus on DVD. I guess it hadn't been released on VHS or any other format in the states before, and that's why noone I met had ever seen it, etc. I was so excited to see that this movie really did exist and I was 99% sure it was the same movie I had seen as a kid, so I ordered it and watched it with my wife on New Year's Day. Of course it wasn't as confusing and haunting as when I saw it as a kid, but it held up, in my eyes. I still think it's a cool movie and I'm very glad to be able to watch it again. Sometimes you see something that you haven't seen in a while and you realize you only liked it for the nostalgia or you didn't know better or whatever. I think Horus is still cool.",1421452800,24,1765,4.118840579710145
6798057,4,B00PEA6K0A,"""Horus, Prince of the Sun"" is a 1960's anime feature film and significant for being directed by Isao Takahara and featuring early animation work of Hayao Miyazaki, both of Studio Ghibli fame. The film is notable in Anime for being one of the first films to break away from a disney-esque mold fairy tales and cute talking animals. Many Japanese animators cite the film as being their inspiration to create more emotionally challenging films. Technically the film also pushed the boundaries of Japanese animation. When it was released ""Horus"" was a commercial failure but has gone on to become a landmark in Anime.

The film holds up quite well. Diskotek Media have released a standard DVD with limited extras: a few movie trailers and some interviews. The film itself looks gorgeous. The character designs are a bit dated but the film is still fluid and the colors are gorgeous. The opening scene itself with wild wolves attacking and Horus sailing the waters of the bleak, cold landscapes of the frigid Fjords are captivating.

The tale of Horus is a straightforward story of a young boy destined for greatness. We follow our hero's journey from orphaned youth through to the epic snow battle to save his adopted village. The film introduces many conventions never before seen in animated films and created characters far more complex than standard princesses, villains and comedic sidekicks.

Younger anime fans who see the genre limited to  Dragonball Z, Bleach or One Piece will probably not enjoy this film. However serious fans of animation will appreciate this film as an enjoyable tale and also understand its merits on another level as well. Recommended!",1420761600,16,1663,5.0144927536231885

6798059,3,B00PEA6K0A,I'm a great fan of anime but Horus is not high on my list of great amine.  The characters are a little wishy washy and not true to themselfs.  The story line takes detours that seem out of character.  The movie comes together at the end but I would not recommend it to high quality anime lovers.,1432857600,,295,4.140350877192983
6798060,5,B00PEA6K0A,"I can't even describe how good this re-release is. This is my favorite 1960's anime. Discotek has done this movie great justice by remastering it, wow.

6798061,4,B00PEA6K0A,"This was an early anime back in the 1960s and '70s.  Remember seeing this as a kid.  It was called back then, Lttle Norse Prince.  Loved it back then.  Now, it's not too bad.  Remember this is me being an adult.  It held up well the test of time.  The music, well, it's alright if you can get past the corniness of it.  The interviews with the animators were interesting.  Definitely recommended for youngsters not familiar with anime.",1432166400,,435,4.4743589743589745
6798062,4,B00PEA6K0A,It's one of the first studio ghibli films where miyazaki is not even a director. Great film. Animation is dated but hey if you take for what it is it is a great film.,1430611200,,166,3.911764705882353

6798064,3,B00PEA6K0A,"During the Iron Age somewhere in Europe, a young boy named Horus (Hols) pulls the mystical Sword of the Sun out of the shoulder of a rock giant. At the behest of his dying father, Horus returns to his people's ancestral lands. He finds the people of his homeland terrorized by the ice demon Grundewald and he vows to defeat him and protect the village. He makes several new friends, one of them a young girl with a lovely voice whom might not be entirely trustworthy...

While watching this movie I assumed that it was based off of some Norse legend, but a little internet research revealed that it was actually based on an ancient legend of the Ainu, the aboriginal people of Northern Japan. The European setting was chosen to make it more appealing to international viewers. So the title is misleading - there is no indication of anything Norse and it is never even suggested that Horus is a prince.

The animation is quite good considering its age and my biggest gripe was about the quality of the picture. I watched this movie streaming over Netflix, which could account for some of the lapse in quality, but I think most of the problem is that it is just old. The voices are noticeable from a different era as well (I watched it in English, the only option on Netflix), which simply added to its charm.

This movie is a fun experience and it is very different from anything produced today. It is short, simple, and sweet. But as I said before, it is an OLD movie and you have to be prepared for it going in, else you might give up early on. I enjoyed it, but it isn't going to become a favorite of mine.",1427241600,3,1608,4.389261744966443
6798065,5,B00PEA6K0A,"American fans and would be viewers of this never before released-on-video TOEI animated classic have been waiting nearly FORTY years to see this early example of Isao Takahata's direction and Hayao Miyazaki's animation, even longer if they missed its occasional showings on TV, which largely ended over a generation ago. What's more, for those who remember Fred Ladd's well-done English dubbing that was shown on American TV so long ago, Discotek Media has wisely included it as the second audio track. The English audio is a little the worse for wear, and the English credits are unfortunately missing, but unless and until someone wants to pony up the money for a modern re-dubbing, it is better to include it than not because purists can always choose the Japanese audio track with English subtitles.

Parental note: the presumably more recent English subtitles, which vary from Fred Ladd's English dub, contain a couple of four letter exclamations some parents might find a little questionable; suffice it to say that somebody may have forgotten he was subtitling a children's movie.  In addition there is an example of Japanese style visual humor worth noting in passing: Horus is caught changing clothes resulting in a VERY brief display of full frontal nudity that most viewers wouldn't notice unless they were looking for it.

The number of future anime greats who worked on this tour de force is astonishing, and there are several extra features pointing this out, including a couple of commentary tracks, a couple of video interviews with Isao Takahata and Yoichi Kotabe, several text pieces, and a text and graphics piece pointing out the long, long shadow of this film's influences on later films.  Aficionados still consider this film one of the greatest anime films ever made and without question one of the most influential despite (or perhaps because of) all the clashes and production struggles.  It was ""diamond cut diamond"" in the proverbial sense.

Unlike most TOEI anime films of the time, this was an original screenplay by the film's screenwriter that went through several changes along the way from its beginnings as a puppet show script rather than being an adaptation of an already famous classic of one sort or another.  It started out being (VERY loosely) based on some legends of the Ainu, the aboriginal inhabitants of Hokkaido and northern Japan but was altered and shifted to a fantasy northern European setting under pressure from the Suits who figured audiences wouldn't know or care about the Ainu.  (About all that is left of the Ainu influence is in Hilda's costume.)  More importantly it was most definitely NOT just a kiddy film, exploring political and psychological themes in depths arguably unequaled to this day in general audience animation releases by major studios anywhere in the world.

In one of the most memorable opening scenes in anime history, a savage (if unrealistically bloodless) battle introduces Horus/Hols, fighting for his life against a vicious pack of wolves.  Their battle awakens a huge stone giant who frightens off the wolves.  Horus offers to remove a painful ""thorn"" from the giant's shoulder, which turns out to be a weathered and ancient sword, and in gratitude receives the sword, a prophecy about same, and a promise by the giant to return should he succeed in figuring out how to reforge it.  However, the triumphal day ends in tragedy as Horus' father dies after explaining their origin in a village destroyed by internal dissention deliberately provoked by the human hating frost king Grunwald. (Resemblances to the famous 1957 Soviet version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Snow-Queen/dp/B001F0KBU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Snow Queen</a>&nbsp;are conscious and deliberate.)  His father's dying wish is for Horus to seek out their former people, but on the way to doing so Horus is captured by Grunwald and offered the opportunity to join or die.  Managing to survive the latter choice, Horus is rescued and provisionally taken in by another village that is unknowingly under attack by the subtle Grunwald, but soon finds his position undermined first by jealous and scheming village leaders and second by the girl who is still rated one of the most complex and conflicted anime ""heroines"" of all time, Hilda, the sole survivor of another of Grunwald's massacres who has (since?) become his ally and adopted sister and been given a medallion of life that grants her magical powers plus eternal life.  (One assumes that Hilda accepted the deal that Horus refused.)  What follows is a rather fascinating three-way struggle between the heroically determined to be clueless Horus, the backstabbing Drago and his pawn of a village chief, and the agonized, treacherous, confused, but malicious Hilda (I've never seen this many expressions cycle across a character's face, one after the other, until CG animation came along!) playing them all against each other while Grunwald plots his final attack.  By the end lessons are learned, prophecies are properly understood and fulfilled, clues are gotten even by the most determinedly clueless, cute talking animals are made into avatars of psychological conflict, a gargantuan ice mammoth is battled, an in many ways unlikely hero and heroine are tested to the breaking point and beyond, and choices are made about life and death and just what one is willing to stomach doing in order to live forever (sirening well deserving adults to their doom is one thing, freezing children to death turns out to be quite another),...

all of this in a children's movie.

Note: Miyazaki fans will find it interesting to compare and contrast this film with the later&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wonderful-World-of-Puss-N-Boots/dp/B000F48DAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wonderful World of Puss 'N Boots</a>&nbsp;(1969) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Animal-Treasure-Island/dp/B000BLI5Q4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Animal Treasure Island</a>&nbsp;(1971), a couple more long lost (until recently) TOEI classics that Miyazaki worked on and Fred Ladd dubbed into English.

Note: There is now a Blu-ray edition of this movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horus-Prince-of-the-Sun-Little-Norse-Prince-Blu-ray/dp/B01N9V2YGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horus, Prince of the Sun (Little Norse Prince) (Blu-ray)</a>&nbsp;with essentially no other differences beyond the much improved picture.

Note: Politically, this is the quintessential accidentally conservative movie.  What was quite deliberately intended at the time as an anti-Vietnam-War protest and as a ""Workers of the World, Unite!"" call for violent trade unionization reads today as a warning against the dangers of deceptive infiltrators sowing internal dissent for the purpose of making free peoples easier to manipulate and destroy (You know, like Communists and Marxists used to do).

6798066,4,B00PEA6K0A,"This film is famed as one of the greatest of Japanese animation, the first film which had a sensibility which inspired its creators and many who saw it to develop the increased character sophistication and a more adult story lines. Previous Japanese animated films mostly looked to Disney and imitated his style. Animation was considered purely kids stuff.

The film Horus Prince of the Sun broke this paradigm, opening with a battle between the protagonist and a hoard of wolves with many slayings of wolves. Songs there were, as in most feature-length animation, but here they occurred as natural songs of the people of the village and as songs of the heroine Hilda who is supposedly a noted singer. The film was not a musical comedy as were all Disney animation feature films. Forced by studio bosses to include animal companions, the animators downplayed the role of Coro the bear and downplayed even more the part played by a white rabbit. The two animal friend of Hilda, Chiro the squirrel and Toto the while owl, are made to personalize the two side of Hildas personality, the good side and the bad side, and near the end Hilda, almost offhandedly, kills Toto.

This was Toeis most expensive film ever, but when the film was originally released it was only in theatres for ten days. Reviews were good but apparently the kids mostly didn't like it and few others watched it. But those few others very much loved what they saw and the film was viewed again and again at university showings and film festivals. In 2001, the Japanese magazine Animage elected this film as the third best anime production of all time.

That this very important film is finally available with both English and Japaneses soundtracks as a region 1 DVD is wonderful.",1425081600,,1747,4.7781456953642385
6798067,4,B00PEA6K0A,"If you ever wanted to see some of the early stuff that makes Japanese anime so good, this is the film. Way a head of its time,story, art work & voice acting wise.  Oh and kids like it too.",1423785600,,188,3.8205128205128207
6798068,5,B00PEA6K0A,"Some of the best DVD extras I have seen in a long time. Very literate film.  Horus, Prince of the Sun is the first anime film I ever came across. Dealing with more complex characters and situations than the usual Disney movie. It may appear simplistic at first, but on further thought, Horus opens itself up to great deal of debate concerning what is going on both onscreen and off.. I won't go into the plot because it's been pointed out elsewhere, but the heroine, Hilda, has always been a fascinating one. Probably due to the fact, she is an ambiguous character. Both good and yet capable of doing some truly heinous acts, until she makes her final choice. Perhaps this is the direction Disney will have to go in films to come; that being having more complex and more ""greyish"" characters. Makes you wonder.

Discoteque did an outstanding job with the extras. ""Every Poet is a Thief,"" and ""Just like Twins"" are some of the best essays and referenced video there's been in a long time.

It's wonderful having this available in the States. Beforehand, I had to get the French edition a few years back. Sadly, this was frustrating due to the fact that the extras were either in French or Japanese, which sincerely cut back on my enjoyment of the DVD.

It's always puzzled me, that ""Horus,"" hasn't received more critical feedback here in the States. It was shown on several cable channels in the mid-seventies, and afterwards disappeared from public viewing.  For a great while, there was scant information available on this gem, and in the past  even writing o several science fiction magazines haven't helped. Now, it's back. But it still needs to be on Blu-ray.  Maybe next year.

With all the ""Art of' and ""Making of"" texts available on current animated films such as ""Wreck-It Ralph,"" ""Frozen,"" and numerous Disney classics, there really should be one on ""Horus: Prince of the Sun,"" Just listening to the commentary, made me realize how much history and material should be researched on it further.

Lastly, a soundtrack album should be make available in the States. The music is certainly different from typical Disney films and children's music of that era, but it is enjoyable, and a proper track listing would be appreciated.

Scratch one Holy Grail off my list.

Great job Discotique

I was quite amazed at the level of quality of this film upon my first viewing of it. While there are still remnants of Disney-isms in the film due to executive interference, the final product is still surprisingly bold and daring in many aspects for an anime film released in 1968. The character of Hilda immediately comes to mind, as there is much more to her than one might initially think and she is a very fascinating character overall. I should have expected no less from such a truly visionary filmmaker as Isao Takahata. This film is a must watch for hardcore animation/Ghibli/Takahata fans interested in the origins of modern anime or simply film buffs looking for an obscure little gem that was definitely ahead of its time. It takes quite a few impressive risks, but not without indulging in some classic Disney-esque action and humor here and there as well. Highly recommended.",1471305600,,1126,4.99468085106383

Audio:
There are four audio tracks present here, done in Dolby Digital 2.0. The original Japanese soundtrack, the English dub broadcast on TBS in the early 1980s, and a pair of commentary tracks, listed in the extras section. All sound pretty good with no real distortions.

Video:
The film plays out in 16:9 Widescreen and has crisp picture quality with muted colors. Its truly a beautiful rendition of 60s animation.

Theres a ton of information to take in here.

Audio Commentary by Mike Toole: Hes become a Discotek Media mainstay and their feature releases (primarily the Lupin films) have benefitted from his anime acumen in James Earl Jones style, breaking down techniques and influences.

Audio Commentary by Daniel Thomas MacInnes: Hes the writer of Ghiblicon.blgspot.com and takes a different approach for his commentary, by reading various essays on anime from different contributors. Theres some decent insights at times but its a little distracting from the feature.

Every Poet is a Thief  Inspirations from Horus: This is an interesting and revealing gallery alternating between screen shots and quoted from different Ghibli staff of how Horus influenced them in later works ranging from Flying Phantom Ship to Heidi to Tales From Earthsea and all points in between. Theres a lot of these and its great stuff.

Horus and Hilda: Just like Twins  Daniel Thomas MacInnes gives an extensive critical analysis of the film here. Again, theres some good insights to read up on.

Reiko Okuyama: A Tribute to a Legend  Reading up on this womans contribution to the animation industry and how Takahata and Miyazakis careers turned out was a truly emotional ride. Im now wanting to see 30, 000 Under The See, 3000 Miles In Search of Mother and several other works she was involved in. Its a heck of a read.

Message of Hope  Isao Takahata conversation: This is a transcription of an interview given by Peter Van Der Lugt who spoke with Takahata at Anima, the International Animation Film Festival in Belgium.

Interview with Isao Takahata and Yoichi Kotabe Production Gallery, Theatrical Trailer: Always nice additions to have.

In Summary:
Even after all the craziness and turbulence behind the scenes though, a quality anime movie was created in Horus The Sun Prince. Its quite enchanting to take in during the musical scenes, while generally entertaining throughout the overall adventure. Knowing everything that went into this movie and this DVD, this release serves as a primer or compendium of sorts on Takahatas career, one I recommend very highly for anime enthusiasts.",1450742400,,2717,5.228110599078341
