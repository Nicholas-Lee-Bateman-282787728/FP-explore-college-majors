8613635,4,B00FA2DDRK,"I gave this film four stars because it did meet my expectations. Knowing that it was a 1954 ""B"" film my expectations weren't very high. Have to admit that parts of it gave me a good chuckle. I am in awe of the fact that old films such as this one, that obviously were not big productions, are being made available in digital format. It is definitely a good example of entertainment during the 1950s and for that reason is of some historical value.

I must make it clear though that I had very personal reasons for purchasing this DVD. My father, who passed away in 1965, was one of the actors in the film. That is the purpose behind my having bought this. My Dad was Lucian B. Garcia who played the Colonel. I was not disappointed in his performance as I thought he played his part quite well. I know that he must have had a lot of fun playing the part.

I do recommend this film for those who enjoy decent examples of the ""B"" movie genres for the early 1950s. I don't believe it will disappoint.",1395619200,2,996,4.2368421052631575
