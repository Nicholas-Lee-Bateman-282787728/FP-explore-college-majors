The film has a handsome, former college football player, an intrepid reporter, a beautiful veterinarian, the Machiavellian presidential advisor, a greedy, careless truck driver, an assortment of federal bad guys, and a very inept President.

I don't know why New Jersey was chosen as the site for the evil defense contractor, Prodichem Military Biowarfare Unit.  Perhaps, the writer or director had seen the Toxic Avenge and was making a parody.

The film began in seriousness, but once Ken Fairchild, former college football and head of the President's Secret Service detail, was introduced, the film degenerated into football metaphors and childish behaviors; for example, a raw egg pushed into someone's face.

Most truckers I have met would have been outraged by Ripley, the trucker, in this film.  Ripley knew what he was carrying in his tanker, but a briefcase of money caused him to toss all caution and safe driving rules out the window.

When Fairchild met Larraine Keller, the beautiful vet, sitting on top of her horse in the Thermal Wells National Park in Oregon, there was hope that the film might become interesting, but alas, this was not to be. Later, we are told that Larraine had been a fan of Fairchild since college.

Of course, Fairchild and Keller survived exposure to the biological agent in Ripley's tanker.  They had to fight their way through government agents and the wilderness to save the world leaders' ecological conference at the Old Mill.

Ripley tagged along most of the way until he met his end at the money tree.  You have to see the film to understand about the money tree scene.

The scenery of Ontario's Algonquin Park was the only plus for this 1996 film.
If you have ninety minutes to waste, then this is the movie for you.

If you want to see an excellent biological terror movie made with a definite purpose, then the 1971 Andromeda Strain is the one to watch reflectively.",1206230400,4,1923,4.861963190184049

I promise you will be able to watch this movie and die laughing watching it. There a lot of movies that claim to be so bad, you'll love it. I've watched those movies and just walked away feeling punched in the gut they were so stupid. I love the slow motion effects of guys getting blow away, or Bosworths' fist a mile away from some poor guy's chin while this very wimpy sounding body blow sound emerges out of thin air. There's also this hard-biting journalist that is so stereo-typically dressed you'll think you're watching a scene from the superman at the daily planet. You've got to watch this movie, I promise you'll be able to watch the whole thing, but it's a guy thing, so you got to watch it with one of your friends or it'll be no fun cracking up by yourself. Plus you can tune it out while it's still playing to talk about something else and just turn back to it without missing a beat.",1189900800,2,1021,4.268041237113402
