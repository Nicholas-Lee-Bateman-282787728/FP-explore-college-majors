Once again, Shelley Duvall's ""Faerie Tale Theatre"" delivers a solid adaptation in ""Puss In Boots,"" and the cast is so loaded with stars as to be relatively mind-boggling.

Starring Ben Vereen and the late Gregory Hines as, respectively, the titular cat and his owner Edgar, the production displays intelligence and a cool wit.  In particular, Mr. Vereen is absolutely remarkable as the wily cat, literally becoming a sort of manlike feline. His character showcases one of the most impressive makeup and costuming jobs in the entire ""Faerie Tale Theatre"" series, and his vocal inflections drive home a wonderfully odd verissimilitude.  Gregory Hines plays Edgar with likability and conviction.

If I had one complaint against this, it would be that the middle section drags almost into boredom as the cat executes the intricacies of his idea to elevate his owner and, by extension, himself to a comfortable status as nobility.  However, a perfect Alfre Woodard as Princess Lovinia and a great payoff battle of wits between the cat and a deranged ogre played by Brock Peters(""To Kill A Mockingbird"")greatly alleviates any potential major downturn.

Also featuring a surprisingly brilliant jazz score, Faerie Tale Theatre's ""Puss In Boots"" is very, very good.",1269648000,,1273,5.272277227722772
7827427,5,6302513391,"This is absolutely the best Puss-in-Boots ever made! I love to watch it over and over, and I always laugh all the way through it. Gregory Hines and Ben Vereen are at their very best here. I suppose kids like it, but I didn't see it for the first time until I was very much an adult. Now I'm just happy that it is in DVD form so I can retire my well-used VHS version. Happy watching!",1166918400,,382,3.9740259740259742
7827428,3,6302513391,"PUSS IN BOOTS is one of FAERIE TALE THEATRE's most innovative offerings featuring an all-black cast.  Ben Vereen plays the title role.

In return for some swanky new clothes, a clever cat (Ben Vereen) promises his master Edgar (Gregory Hines) a kingdom of his own and wealth beyond his wildest dreams.  And with an extra bit of cunning Edgar might just win the hand of the fair Princess Lovinia (Alfre Woodard)!

This tale is so much fun!  Ben Vereen is just about the perfect person to play the cat, with fine support from Brock Peters and George Kirby.",1099958400,2,554,4.612244897959184
7827429,5,6302513391,"This is a great movie. It's real light hearted and comical. The characters are all very love-able, except for the ogre of course! I also thought it was neat that all the main characters are African American. I highly recommend this film if you're looking for a good, clean, fun movie to enjoy.",988243200,4,293,4.547169811320755
