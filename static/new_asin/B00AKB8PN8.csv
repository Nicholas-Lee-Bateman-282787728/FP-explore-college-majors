5445098,4,B00AKB8PN8,"I enjoy most VeggieTales videos. I love the talking vegetables, the jokes that probably go over kids' heads, and the silly song that appear in each episode. I was excited when I received an offer to review VeggieTales: The Little House that Stood and this was a DVD that I enjoyed as much as the others.

The video starts out with Bob and Larry wanting to do different sketches. Larry wants to do a fairy tale story, and Bob wants to do a parable from the Bible, so they compromise and Bob becomes a builder of houses. The parable of the wise man building his house upon the rock is explained in this episode. As usual, VeggieTales takes liberties with the story to make it amusing, and in this episode the Three Little Pigs come to town and each hires a different builder. One builds with brick, one with hay, and one with sticks.  Cabbageville gets hit with a horrible flood, and many structures are wiped away, but there are some buildings that stand.  Each one of those has something in common.  It was built by Bob, and each one had a solid foundation before construction began.

The silly song in this episode was no my favorite, but it was cute. It was ""Happy Tooth Day"". In this, Larry the Cucumber sings about his solitary tooth, including showing a baby picture of when he got his tooth. He's afraid it might be lonely, so he buys it some friends.

The final section of the video was my least favorite. Bob the Tomato stars as Humpty Dumpty, mayor of Gooseville. It included lots of nursery rhyme references, but I felt it didn't have any real point to it. I suppose it was to be about helping your neighbor, but it didn't come across as very biblical.  Just as a lesson, and the constant whining to Bob as mayor was a more than just a little annoying, especially the shrieks of Little Bo Peep. Everyone went directly to Bob the Tomato with their problems, not trying to help one another or seeking help of someone at church or praying about them. Still, this section was cute in its own way. As an adult who loves VeggieTales, this segment is one I would be content to never watch again, although youngsters may feel differently. 

Overall, this was another strong, solid episode of VeggieTales and one I would recommend.

My Review:

 My children and I have always loved watching any Veggie Tales movie together. And the newest one The Little House That Stood is no different. This company is an awesome company trying to teach good character skills to our little ones and personally a few adults could stand to learn some things as well.

Well this Veggie Tales movie is a mix of fairy tale and Bible story. It is based on the parable of the wise and foolish builders and  the fairy tale story of the three little pigs. The parable is centered around the fact that we are suppose to build our lives on the solid rock or foundation which is God and with Him as our foundation we will remain strong. But if you build it on sand which is the world you will surely fail and your foundation is weak. So that is what the pigs were contemplating and of course the house with the strongest most solid foundation remained strong and up right.

My sponsors have graciously decided to give one lucky reader their very own copy of this DVD just enter below and Good Luck!

5445100,3,B00AKB8PN8,"We enjoyed the first movie selection of the DVD, a combination of The Three Little Pigs nursery rhyme from Mother Goose and the parable Jesus told in the Bible about the builders that built houses on solid rock and on sand.  It was typical VeggieTales style, all the way.

  The ""Silly Song with Larry"", one of the pieces you can count on while viewing a VeggieTales DVD, didn't disappoint us, although it might have been a bit odder than normal.  :)

  The last piece of the video was all about selfishness and helping and serving others.  It combined pieces of many Mother Goose nursery rhymes and poems into the video, which could have been very confusing to many children who haven't been read the nursery rhymes.

  My girls, however, were not happy about one very obvious part of this movie.  The mayor, whom we don't know if he is a paid government employee or an unpaid volunteer, is getting tired of serving his community and dealing with their problems and complaints.  He decides to leave and go on vacation, leaving his community in disarray.  The final conclusion by him toward the end of the story is that he should be serving his community all the time.  Sounds good - at first glance.  But the kinds of things he's asked to help with sometimes look just like economic handouts instead of gathering friends together to help solve a problem.  My girls noticed this right away and complained about it to us.  ""Let's give everyone all these handouts and do everything for them so they don't need to work together as a community,"" grumbled one of our daughters.  It's true - most, if not all of the help that is given is offered by the mayor himself, and not as people working together to solve a problem of their own.

  You may think we are really reaching far to come to this conclusion, but we all agreed that if the leader in the movie had been a pastor, we would have had entirely different conclusions.  However, since everyone in the community was always whining and complaining to the mayor to solve their problems, this bothered us.  We're not anti-government, but we also believe in churches helping and serving, and in individuals helping and serving themselves and others, not just relying on the government to do it all for them.

  As well, we didn't see anyone in the movie praying and asking God to help them first with their struggles.  Instead, they went directly to the mayor first.  We personally don't think that the mayor was representing God or Jesus, just in case you wondered.  This could have been a great opportunity in the movie to show children how to handle stress and financial difficulties they will encounter.",1362096000,29,2654,4.643010752688172
5445101,5,B00AKB8PN8,"What a great video. The Veggie Tales tell the parable of the wise and the foolish Builders. Your favorite veggie characters Bob and Larry are building houses. Bob is concerned about a good foundation. Where the others are worried about just building. Then the dam breaks and who's house withstood all the water? God expects us to build our lives on a solid foundation. Kids will learn a cute song called "" Happy Tooth Day "". Believe me you will be singing along. The last story is on being a good Samaritan. Using a lot of different nursery rhyeme story characters. This is a great movie to teach wee ones the bible when they are even 2. Good to take to church for Sunday school. I think kid's of all ages will like this. Good lesson for adults too.

5445102,5,B00AKB8PN8,"I would hardly think there isn't a person alive who hasn't heard of Veggie Tales! Now they have introduced a new DVD, The Little House That Stood along with your favorite Veggie Tales characters Bob and Larry. Once more Bob and Larry are trying to answer two different show requests, one to do a take on Mother Goose Stories and the other for a parable like Jesus told from the Bible. Like all wonderful DVD's prior, this one does a wonderful job at incorporating the two and helping children learn about making good choices.

In the first part of the video, we are introduced to a retelling of the children's classic of The Three Little Pigs. This time the story takes place in Cabbageville where three different builders are undergoing to tasks of home development, Larry chooses to build his homes from straw and give them that country feel and they are green friendly too! Mr. Lunt choose the bricks because after all, nothing is stronger than bricks! Then Bob, (the builder) decides to opt for sticks but instead has learned from experience that the foundation is what is important. Soon a building competition ensures for Builder of the Year. The three pigs come to town in hopes of buying homes and each chooses a different one due to their preferences. When the weather man indicates a massive rain storm that could flood the town, who's choice will be the wisest?

For intermission, we are once again introduced to a catchy new song Happy Tooth Day in the Silly Songs with Larry segment. Soon you'll find yourself humming along with this one long after the DVD is over.

In the final segment of this DVD, we are introduced to The Good Egg of Gooseville, where Bob the Tomato (disguised as Humpty Dumpty) is now cast as the friendly mayor of Gooseville. He's a busy mayor who spends time dealing with all the neighbors complaints and soon finds that the stress he's dealing with is causing him to crack his shell. While searching for a way out, he finds the perfect vacation, the vacation all about Me and thinks this will be the answer to all his problems. But with the Mayor gone, who will solve all the neighbors issues like removing the splinter from Miss Muffet's Tuffet? Or how will Goldilocks find more porridge? The end result will literally crack you up!

I received The Little House That Stood compliments of Big Idea Pictures and Flyby Promotions for my honest review. My family has quite literally grown up on Veggie Tales and when the opportunity came along to review this DVD, my entire family said ""YES!"" Mind you that the youngest in our household is 14. We thoroughly enjoyed this trip down memory lane as a family over dinner one night and all agreed this one is a hands down 5 out of 5 family friendly stars classic with a valuable lesson included. My 14-year-old daughter commented ""that's why its important to always make sure you have a firm foundation on anything you do!"" Guess the lessons still apply all these years later.

Bonus features on this DVD included a History of Mother Goose, behind the Scenes at Big Idea, Happy Tooth Day Sing-Along, Discussion Guide and so much more. Running time is approximately 49 minutes and includes a preview to the next Veggie Tales DVD coming soon!",1361923200,,3220,4.661971830985915

5445108,4,B00AKB8PN8,"The main story on the VeggieTales video THE HOUSE THAT STOOD is a retelling of the Biblical parable of the wise builder who built his house on rock combined with elements from The Three Little Pigs nursery rhyme. The story features the Three Little Pigs looking for developers to build them homes. Bob, Larry, and Mr. Lunt each build a house, but only one is built using plans from the Master Builder's Handbook. This story reminded me of the classic VeggieTales videos from Big Idea's heyday.

The ""Silly Song with Larry"" on this  DVD is a song entitled ""Happy Tooth Day."" Written as a kind of doo-wop song, it's a song that Larry sings in celebration of his one tooth.

The second story on THE LITTLE HOUSE THAT STOOD is a retelling of the story of Humpty Dumpty entitled ""The Good Egg of Gooseville."" This shorter tale features Bob portraying Humpty Dumpty, the mayor of a seemingly peaceful town who ends up cracking under pressure. The premise seems cute. However, out of all the VeggieTales stories I have watched, this is one of the most disappointing ones. Humpty Dumpty is made to look like the bad guy in the story who has to change his attitude, but it's really the townspeople who should be more respectful of their mayor and give him time to take a Sabbath.

Overall, THE HOUSE THAT STOOD is a mixed bag. It's got an entertaining main story, a good Silly Song with Larry, but a very disappointing second story.

5445158,4,B00AKB8PN8,"I personally know people that are antiVeggieTales, proVeggieTales, and really-don't-care-about-VeggieTales. My husband and I enjoyed watching them before we had kids, and then when we had kids we weren't so sure about VeggieTales. Sounds backwards, doesn't it?

These days when people ask us about them our reply is something like this: They are a fun, clean cartoon; but don't use them to teach Bible stories. They are entertainment. While we appreciate the fact that they are teaching character lessons with Bible stories and cartoons we didn't let our children watch the VeggieTales based on Bible Stories until they were old enough to know the actual Bible story from the Bible. There are VeggieTale DVDs that are based on literary classics that we did let them watch. While I don't always approve of the music used in the cartoons, I do like knowing that there will be no taking of the Lord's name in vain, no extreme violence, and no crude innuendos - which I can't say about very many popular cartoons.

Having said all that I would like to present my review of their new DVD Veggie Tales: The Little House That Stood. At first I was really leery when the characters started talking about mixing Mother Goose and Bible Stories. [Oh man - I also know some people that are really anti-Mother Goose.] It boiled down to a cute story about building on a solid foundation. It was not clear what that foundation should be - just that it should be solid. I actually liked the second story better that was just based on nursery rhymes and a moral lesson. Again, I look at it like clean & fun entertainment - not a Bible story lesson.

I guess that I should also confess that Silly Songs with Larry is the part I look forward to the most. Yes, they are silly but sometimes my life could use a little silly. Which brings up a question. Why is it funny when Larry mumble sings with something in his mouth? I smile at it every time!

5445159,4,B00AKB8PN8,"My family have been fans of the Veggie Tales movies ever since my oldest daughter was a preschooler.  We enjoy the fun twist they take on Bible stories and other stories, to teach Christian values to children.  The humor always captures the interest of our children, as well as tickling the adults' funny bones with a few little gems (like references to other movies and books) that the children may not catch.  Best of all, they are completely safe and family friendly.  As my 2 year old says, ""I dub Veg Tades!""  (translation: ""I love Veggie Tales!"")

The latest movie, The Little House That Stood, did not disappoint us at all.  It held up to all our expectations of a Veggie Tales movie.  It uses two different fairy tales to teach two different lessons.  The first story uses the Story of the Three Little Pigs to help illustrate Jesus' parable of the wise and foolish builders from Matthew 7.  This town has three builders, who each build a house for one of the three little pigs.  However, only one builder is building on a firm foundation.  This story is very cute and illustrates the importance of making wise choices and building our life on the foundation of God's Truth.

The second story on this DVD uses the familiar nursery rhyme of Humpty Dumpty to show the importance of helping our neighbors.  Humpty Dumpty is the mayor of Gooseville, but he'd rather take care of himself than help the citizens of his town.  When he runs away to a self-serve resort, things quickly fall apart in Gooseville. Everyone, including Humpty Dumpty, soon learns that life is better when we set aside selfishness and take time to help our neighbors.  Though this story didn't reference a specific Bible story or verse, it was still a good lesson.

We've had this movie for less than a week, and it's been watched every single day since we got it.  My 2 year old, 4 year old and 6 year old like it the most, but everyone has watched it at least once.  We'll enjoy watching it many more times, as well.

5445160,3,B00AKB8PN8,"I received a free review copy of this DVD for my family, and I have to tell you that I had to force it from the DVD player after the 15th time through. The kids loved it! However, when I got ready to write my review, I realized that we had been watching the bonus feature repeatedly and I'm not sure they watched the featured film more than once. The Good Egg of Gooseville (the bonus show) is a fun film that teaches children about loving their neighbors. The featured film was about the three little pigs and was supposed to depict the parable about building your house upon the rock - but again, my kids don't seem to have liked that one as much as the bonus film.

We are lovers of all things Veggie Tales - a love that I didn't come by until high school. As others have said, you're never too old for Veggie Tales. I'm torn between the original videos that used Bible stories to these newer movies that teach using other fun stories. On the one hand, the older videos are extremely inaccurate in their attempt to be funny, and the newer ones are based off of secular stories giving them a biblical twist. Both are cute but shouldn't be considered Bible lessons - just fun Christian based films.",1362787200,2,1199,4.328888888888889
5445161,2,B00AKB8PN8,"Veggie Tales has built a solid reputation of using Bible stories or moral themes inspired by scripture to set the stage for whatever lesson the video has set out to teach. Do the creators of Veggie Tales use straight up Bible stories all the time? No. Do they use other types of story telling to get these themes across? Yes. They've used a variety of scenarios, superheroes, and all while weaving in Biblical principles.

Even so, The Little House That Stood crosses into territory which I find uncomfortable.

As a former teacher (and mother), I value the use of Mother Goose nursery rhymes, Aesop's fables, and fairy tales as a method of teaching moral life lessons (because that's their nature and origin of these stories). However, in the case of The Little House That Stood, what I see happening is a combining of these stories with scripture.

As a Christian, I cannot find this method of weaving fable with Biblical parables to be effective, useful, or helpful in training children in how to understand God's word as the foundation of our lives.

If anything, I believe The Little House That Stood (unwittingly) portrays scripture (which is God's authoritative word) and specifically the parables of Jesus as simply another literary wisdom source rather than the source of all wisdom, which undermines the important message Veggie Tales has spent the past twenty years proclaiming.

There is no doubt children will enjoy this video. The music is lively, the stories are interesting (although I found the Humpty Dumpty inspired ""The Good Egg of Gooseville"" a bit lacking in coherency) and the animation as always is excellent.

However, there are better Veggie Tales videos which get the point across even while expounding on a different theme or topic. I'm not saying don't watch The Little House That Stood, but rather be prepared to discuss how God's word is not the same as a fairytale or fable, but gives us the true, firm foundation we need to live as Christians.",1362787200,11,1976,4.883582089552239

The Little House That Stood DVD

My Review
Remember me mentioned my dear neighbor children? One thing I see them enjoying is the rug their daddy drew into a neighborhood with roads and buildings to maneuver their cars and park them. I thoroughly enjoyed the up and down aisles chase in the building store and know it will be identified within child's play. Another thing that stood out to me was the bricks appearing to be solid and secure. Without a Firm Foundation, nothing put above it will stand ~ nothing haphazardly placed because of laziness or wanting to get it done quickly to go on to something else. Earthly materials not standing up under pressure.

The DVD starts out with write-in's from two viewers. One child wanted fairy tales/nursery rhymes and a parent wanting a clear visual story of a parable for children. I liked that in the DVD a character said he knew of a ""pair of bulls"" once.

In the second story, wait until you get to the end and find out what the ""pour-age"" does for Humpty! All of these Mother Goose ~ the goose that is somebody's mother ~ characters are coming for help from their town's mayor, who is overwhelmed with the need to see to his own. He turns a little hard-boiled until he gets up on the wall and see's what needs to be done to work together in a neighborhood. Then he is able to lead and delegate rather than trying to do it all on his own. There is a good example at the end of blame and taking responsibility for one's own actions that family's will be able to discuss together. Good conversation opener on seeing needs, helping each other, and doing what we are able to do.

5445163,5,B00AKB8PN8,"Larry and Mr. Lunt didn't see the point of building on solid
stuff. They wanted to do things the quick and easy way. This DVD shows why it's not good to do things fast or the easy way. It explains why fighting over something only makes you sad or look silly. This DVD is really neat because it tells a story with many wonderful examples for doing something or not doing it. It shows you what's right and what's wrong with doing certain things.
  The only story in the DVD about Humpty Dumpty talks about being lonely and wanting to be alone, God didn't create people to be alone,
but to love and care for each other. When we care for others, God fills us with purpose and joy! Not blaming others for things that are wrong and confessing to things that we may have done wrong ourselves.
This is just a fantastic DVD for everyone, but mainly for children 3-7 years old. Highly recommended!

5445164,3,B00AKB8PN8,"Are you ever too old for VeggieTales? Not according to my family, as none of us are the target-audience age, yet we still enjoy the cute and clever stories! (Although I'm finding more and more that there isn't really a target-audience age for these shows... The animation is geared toward younger children, but the humor and homage to literary works and films can only be understood by adults, to my way of thinking.)

The Little House That Stood is a sweet addition to the VeggieTales collection. It begins with Larry the Cucumber dressed up as a gingerbread cookie (yes, we finally get to see him with arms and legs!), and a hungry Mother Goose visiting Bob and Larry. Capitalizing on the current excitement over fairy tales (or nursery rhymes, in this case), the stage is set for some fun twists on popular children's stories and parables from the Bible.

The first story, for which the movie is named, was my family's favorite. As Larry once said in an earlier movie, the title of which I can't recall: ""I laughed. I cried. It moved me, Bob."" OK, I didn't exactly cry, but my family and I did indeed laugh at some of the lines and the antics of Bob, Larry, and Mr. Lunt. The songs are catchy (I particularly liked ""Solid Stuff""), some of the voices are rather interesting, some of the lines and references to modern culture are pretty funny, and the lesson on the importance of having a firm foundation for all areas of a person's life is shared in a fresh and clear way.

The ""Silly Song"" is just what the feature's title promises: ""silly."" Of course, all of the ""Silly Songs"" are supposed to be rather ridiculous, but some are more creative and catchy than others. My family mentioned that some of the ones they loved in the past were ""Barbara Manatee"" and ""The Gated Community."" This one about Larry's tooth (a throwback to the ""I Love My Lips"" song?), while instrumentally enjoyable, was a little too weird and goofy for our taste.

The second story that rounds out the movie, ""The Good Egg of Gooseville,"" was not as enjoyable as the first story. I did appreciate the cleverness - how so many different nursery rhymes could be tied together to illustrate the importance of sacrificing for others and truly loving one's neighbor. However, my family and I agreed that the rhyming stories (like one of the stories on the Robin Good and His Not So Merry Men DVD) are not VeggieTales' best. They're a little harder to follow, rather convoluted/strange, and they're kind of annoying (maybe trying too hard to be too clever).

If you're a fan of VeggieTales, The Little House That Stood has some good points that would make it a fine addition to your collection. Overall, it's not the best of their movies, but the first story is enjoyable, and there are enough cute moments to make it worth the viewing. But if you don't enjoy the rhyming stories, take heed. And if you or your children are new to VeggieTales, other VeggieTales movies might serve as a better introduction to the shows.

5445165,4,B00AKB8PN8,"This delightful DVD  teaches a lesson about making good choices through the parable of 'The Wise and Foolish Builders' from Matthew 7 combined with fairy tales. It tells the story of three builders who used different supplies to build homes - hay, bricks and sticks - with only one building on a strong foundation. The story explains why a strong foundation is needed in daily living as well.

The classic tale of Humpty Dumpty is also retold in `The Good Egg of Gooseville.' This story deals with neighbors helping neighbors and the fact that one person can't solve everyone's problems.

The DVD also features a silly new song, `Happy Tooth Day.' It will have youngsters smiling and possibly even thinking about brushing more. It's a catchy little tune that will remain with you long after the DVD ends. In addition, there are numerous other bonus features such as the history of Mother Goose, `Lend A Little Hand' sing-along, a discussion guide, and much more.

VeggieTales: The Little House That Stood puts a new spin on some classic fairy tales and incorporates parables from the Bible. This 49-minute DVD will delight youngsters of all ages (including adults) as it brings vegetables to life, reinforces moral values, and provides countless moments of laughter.

8552984,5,B00AKB8PN8,"Every so often, VeggieTales deviates from its formula.  Usually, that means it has no wrap around, but for their latest video, it means there is no one central theme to the stories.  Instead, the two segments in The Little House That Stood are themed around a mash up of Mother Goose with Biblical parables.

Of course, if you are a fan of these computer animated Vegetables, you know to expect plenty of fun with your Biblical lessons.  Thats certainly the case here in both cases.  Heck, it starts at the very beginning when we see Larry the Cucumber and Bob the Tomato in some pretty fun costumes and meet Mother Goose (okay, just a normal goose) as our two hosts discuss the two letters from kids they are prepared to satisfy.  And in a throw back to the old days, these are actual letters and not a kid on the computer.  One letter asks for a parable while the other wants something fun from Mother Goose.  And its Larry who comes up with the perfect solution.

The first segment is the title one.  In The Little House that Stood, we meet three builders in the town of Cabbageville.  Larry builds with straw, Mr. Lunt with brick, and Bob with sticks.  But Bob also picks his location carefully and follows the master builder blue print, including creating a firm foundation.

Just as three pigs move to town, there is a contest for new builder, with our three main characters hoping to win Builder of the Year.  Oh yeah, and a storm comes, flooding Wolf Creek and putting pressure on Huff n Puff Dam.  Im sure you can see where this one is going.

Our second story is The Good Egg of Gooseville and finds Bob the one in need of a lesson.  Hes playing mayor Humpty Dumpty and is completely stressed out by the amount of work he has to do keeping peace in the village.  One Jack is practicing his candle jumping while Little Miss Muffet is finding a thorn in her tuffet and Little Bo Peeps sheep are running around town  again.  The other Jack and Jill are constantly looking for something in the well.  Meanwhile, Mama Bear is upset because she lives next to the Old Woman who Lived in a Shoe, and she doesnt like having all those kids around.  Think of what they are doing to property values.  The pressure is making Humpty/Bob start to crack, so he goes on a vacation on the top of the wall.  What will happen next?

And yes, between these two stories we get a brand new silly song.  Happy Tooth Day finds Larry celebrating the day he got his tooth.  And he has a special gift for his tooth.  The results?  Pretty funny when Bob is around.

All told, this is another fun video.  Both mash ups actually work, and the clever way they did it, especially in the first one, will entertain adults even if their kids don't get all the jokes.  There are several references adults will get and should really make them laugh.  I will admit, I didn't catch the parable they were retelling in the second story (Good Samaritan) until the wrap up, but I certainly caught the lesson.

And that is my only complaint about the video.  I like it when they have one coherent lesson they are teaching.  Here, even the verse that Qwerty spits out at the end is actually the references for both parables.  But then again, it provides the opportunity for parents to read the original parable with their kids.  Really, its a minor issue overall.  I mean, weve got a fun 45 minutes that does teach Bible lessons in creative ways.  What else do you really want?

As always, the voice talent is great.  Original creators Mike Nawrocki and Phil Vischer provide many of the voices, and they are fun.  Theyve expanded the cast quite a bit here, and all the voices match the new characters.

The animation is a good as well.  Its not the big budget quality wed see from Pixar or Dreamworks, but it tells the story well and never gets in the way.

So, ultimately, its another fun lesson or two in The Little House That Stood.  If youve got kids (or are young at heart yourself), this is a must get VeggieTales.",1429660800,,3984,4.40934065934066
