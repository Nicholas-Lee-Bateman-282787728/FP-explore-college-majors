2104134,5,B0002M5U74,"This was and is a GREAT SHOW, shows like BARNEY were just horrible and painful to watch but this is a show you can sit down and just enjoy it for what it is (a great childrens show). This show is just great for kids of all ages. They don't make quality childrens programming like this anymore. Again you have to enjoy the show for what it is and not be over critical of the time period in which it was done.",1132444800,24,407,3.975609756097561

2104171,5,B0002M5U74,"brings back fond memories.  this was part of my weekend mornings  as a kid and although watching it now at my age it seems low budget , its still good innocent entertainment for kids that actually teach something and not corrupt the innocent mind.  would love to own the rest of them  as well.",1384387200,2,293,4.37037037037037
2104172,5,B0002M5U74,"This is such a great show. 40 years later I still enjoy it, allthough I would never admit it. Good for pre-schoolers and anyone who remembers it from their childhood. Now for the pros and cons

Pros: This show was not released in traditional seasons. It was syndicated in 1972 and again in 1977. I beleve the first runs shows are the best, and all 59 are here. The video quailty is good, some video noise that is on the master tape but generally good. The shows are complete at 22.5 minutes each, and only 5 per disc so they are not over compressed. It's packaged nicely, and overall BCI has done an excellent job with this releae.

Cons: The Box Set is on 6 Double Sided dics, they all play fine but we all know the issues with DVD 18. Most ANNOYING is a BCI ""bug"" in the lower right hand side of the picture that pops up every 5 minute or so. Other than that a great set of a great show.",1384300800,3,889,4.103448275862069
2104173,5,B0002M5U74,"Its too bad people have to bash something simply because it didn't fit their bill...but this show as cheesey as it may seem today was one of the better ones I grew up on, helped me to learn to appreciate music, and the lessons in ethics and morality are certainly NOT ""rammed"" down anyone's throat...for that matter, if you didn't like it back in the day..why didn't you just turn it off? I loved the show as a kid, and despite rosy colored lenses from the past the charm of the puppetry and the wonderful themes have not lost their place in tv history for kids. I can only imagine what some of the naysayers would say about Mr. Rogers as well.",1381536000,,644,4.286885245901639
2104174,5,B0002M5U74,"My husband loved this show as a child. Although I don't remember it, he insisted we buy it for our baby.  She is 2.5 months and likes to watch TV. It has all of the episodes from Season 1 so they can watch them together. Like most children's shows, there is song and dance and a lesson.",1381449600,2,286,4.017543859649122
2104175,5,B0002M5U74,"When I was a little girl, I'd have to get up early every morning and head over to my babysitter's home where I could not fall back asleep. This show saved me. I loved it then and find it charming now.",1362873600,4,200,3.902439024390244
2104176,5,B0002M5U74,keep those youngsters entertained as well as educated about morals and respect.....this show teaches it all.....catchy tune too.....loved it as a child,1361923200,2,151,5.909090909090909
2104187,5,B0002M5U74,This is a guaranteed  child entertainer. My nephew can become very busy easily so I thought this would be the great gift for him. He can learn and it will keep his brilliant little mind occupied.,1360627200,5,195,4.416666666666667
2104188,4,B0002M5U74,"I remember this show. I was very, very young, and this show was my first introduction to sexuality in the form of Emmy Jo's smokin' HOT legs and body.

She had a beautiful face and smile, great voice, and every episode I watched with great anticipation to see Emmy Jo in her super-small micro-mini bounce around in hopes of seeing her panties. Or, when she would be sitting with her legs crossed and maybe get an up-skirt shot. Yes, I was very precocious and extremely eager to learn how Emmy Jo's body ""worked."" Although being so young and not knowing what I would do with her if I had her. But, I definitely KNEW there WAS SOMETHING FUN to be done with her.

If she was wearing pants in an episode, I put on the Super Friends, or whatever other show/cartoon was on before leaving to go to the babysitters. The only ""lessons"" I remember being interested in, was the fantasy lessons of Emmy Jo's body. Period. It's worth owning for the flashbacks! I highly recommend ALL seasons.",1359331200,2,979,4.49438202247191

2104190,2,B0002M5U74,"The messages are excellent, but it's too slow for today's audience.  The kids like the costumes, but it misses the mark in a number of areas.  When the kids are old enough to understand the messages they get bored with the time it takes to make the point, and some of them while good lessons, are sad and ugly.  Other shows like Berenstein Bears, or Franklin, or Care Bears to name a few, teach the same lessons but in a much  more enlightened manner.",1358121600,,451,4.333333333333333

The stories are hilarious, the songs are simple, the decor is deliciously 70s!
I can't say enough good about this show! It's when TV was simple and dresses were short!",1301184000,4,287,4.72
2104195,5,B0002M5U74,"I'm not quite sure what to say about The New Zoo Review. Unusual? Bizarre? Unique? All of the preceeding and more. It's so squeaky clean you feel like you need a shower after watching an episode. It's The Brady Bunch of pre-school TV. On the surface it's painfully cutesy yet at the same time if, as an adult, you peel off the cutesy layer and really listen to the messages, it's a truly great teaching/learning tool for the 4-8 year old age group. Unlike so many supposedly 'educational' kids shows, the underlying purpose of New Zoo is explaining values - what is and isn't important in life. New Zoo is all about values and morals and making the right decisions. Basic values and morals never go out of style ( or at least they shouldn't, though sadly... but thats another, much longer discussion ). New Zoo finds ways to make the value the message of each episode. In that it succeeds brilliantly.

The New Zoo Review is not for every child. Some kids have a different sense of what 'works' for them, just as some kids love a teacher that other kids simply can't stand. The same principle applies to most everything in life. My gut feeling is that New Zoo works better for the quiet, introspective, bookish child. There is relatively little physical action. Instead there is constant inter-action between the characters - conversation and song woven through situational skits about a single value or concept per episode.

One thing very few people are aware of is that the two human characters, Doug Momary (the shows co-creator) and Emily (Emmy Jo) Peden, are married in real life, were during the programs run and have been for nearly 40 years. They still work together behind the scenes in a TV production company.

In short, The New Zoo Review was aimed at the 4-8 year olds of a very different era than the one we live in today, but the messages and values it taught are still just as important now as they were then. It also had another huge fan base... 12-16 year old boys who lusted after Emmy Jo with their bedroom doors shut. For both age groups it was, in its way, very educational...",1267488000,6,2099,4.577127659574468
2104196,5,B0002M5U74,I can't believe it!!!  I finally found my favorite show as a kid.  I was 3 when The New Zoo Revue started on air.  I watched it all the time growing up in Dallas.  I also remember watching the re-runs in the early 80's.  I am buying a copy for me ( my husbands' gonna think I'm nuts) and I will buy a copy to send to my nieces & nephew.  I can't wait to watch it!,1265068800,12,363,3.6493506493506493
2104216,4,B0002M5U74,I was very happy with these dvds...brought back a lot of memories of when I used to watch the New Zoo Revue...now I get to make memories with my son...he likes Charlie (the owl)!,1257379200,3,178,4.264705882352941

2104220,5,B0002M5U74,"This is a great video for children. I grew up watching this show and love it. Thank God my Mom woke us up early because this was an early morning show which we watched before school during the week. Charlie the Owl, Freddie the Frog and Henrietta the Hippo are very funny characters. I advise parents today to order this video because it teaches as well as make the kids laugh.

2104221,5,B0002M5U74,"I absolutely loved this show when I was growing up.  I guess I was watching the reruns because I watched it in the early 80s as a child.  Your children will love it, as long as they aren't too ""grown up"" for innocent fun.",1186099200,9,221,4.0
2104222,4,B0002M5U74,"Unlike most of the other reviewers of this product, I actually KNEW Doug Momary (one of the show's stars.) Back when I was a teenager growing up in Whittier California, Doug was the City Parks and Recreation department drama director. I was in three of his summer plays and got to know him well. Does this bias my opinion of the New Zoo Review? Maybe, but since I know Doug and his background and committment to children, I know how the New Zoo Review works with children. Doug's talent extended from acting, directing, writing and music/lyrics. The New Zoo Review is Doug's crowning achievment. Children still enjoy this 'values based' program to this day.",1176163200,12,657,4.771929824561403
2104223,4,B0002M5U74,"I liked this show as a preschooler in the 70's (I think I was 3 or so when I watched it). My 4 yr. old thoroughly enjoyed the dvd when we rented it from the library recently. BUT- I must admit as an adult it can get a bit taxing after watching the same 10 episodes repeatedly- if you are buying this set, with 59 episodes, I doubt you'll run into that issue right away!

Some of the 'ballads' of Emmy Jo and Doug are a bit slow and dull, but overall it is a fun heartwarming show that I think many 2-5 yr olds would enjoy. (It is also amusing to see the clothing and other 70's laden-decor, it's like a trip back in time if you grew up in this era.)",1155340800,20,649,3.8796992481203008
2104224,5,B0002M5U74,"Finally all of season one is out on DVD. New Zoo Revue is an underrated kids' show where ""three delightful animals"" have fun at what they do. Those being Freddy Frog, Charlie Owl and Henrietta Hippo. The two humans, Doug and Emmy Jo, manage to be on hand without taking over. Yes it's the ""E"" word-- educational, and even has the ""V"" word-- values, but its not one of those plodding braindead lesson-heavy thinly disguised school shows that prodded Joe Barbera to quip that he was in favor of cartoons that were ""mindlessly funny not mindlessly preachy."" Kids love this show, and for good reason. Now that season one is out, they can let adults in on the fun.",1141084800,34,659,4.546218487394958
2104225,1,B0002M5U74,"As a kid in the 70s, I hated this show with a passion! Then, it struck me as the ""Antimuppets."" While the Muppets had the right mix of wit and charm to appeal to all ages, this was the sissified low-budget cousin with stupid costumes and even dumber characers, stories, songs, etc. Awful all the way around. Charlie the Owl, Freddie the Frog (perhaps my least favorite), and Henrietta Hippo as well as the pseudohippies Doug and Emmy Jo rammed lessons down kids throats without any wit or charm whatsoever and would only appeal to someone either under the age of three or with severely low IQs.

A couin of mine recently bought this for my neice and on a lark, I sat and watched it. It was every bit as bad as I remembered and could not take ten minutes of it. Fourtunately, my eight-year old neice said, ""This is baby stuff."" I said, YOU GO GIRL, gave her a high-five, and put in some TRUE ""edutainment"" (Fat Albert) instead, which we BOTH enjoyed.

Unlike the Muppets, Fat Albert, Schoolhouse Rock, and the wonderful ELECTRIC COMPANY that TRULY brought joy and learning to all ages in the early 70s, this was pretty much a predecessor to the nauseating, sissy antics of Barney the Dinosaur and other saccharine quiche-eating efforts that would cause the next generation of children to hold on to their stomachs in AGONY. If you can sit all the way through this, a get well card is in order.

But hey, the DVD would make a great frisbee or it could be used for target practice.",1139356800,19,1478,4.4869888475836435

When it premiered in '71 it aired at 8:00 AM weekday mornings in Los Angeles and I would watch as much as I could before I left for school at 8:20 AM. What an innocent time it was.  Doug and Emmy Jo were just two nice young adults (hi, you two) trying to help us kids. Emmy Jo was super pretty, and Doug, well, he was a nice man with a mustache, eyeglasses and a song.  I was ten years old and it didn't feel like ""Sesame Street"" to me, which was aimed more at preschoolers.  So I would watch, eat my Lucky Charms or Alpha Bits, while my mother would drink her morning coffee.  It was entertaining to say the least. I still remember the song and all the words to it.
