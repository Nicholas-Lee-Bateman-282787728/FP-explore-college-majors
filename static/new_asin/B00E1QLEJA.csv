5886364,5,B00E1QLEJA,"I am just watching this title now, I bought it at wal-mart for $5 on 8/20/13. The set contains 2 one sided dvds. Super Bwoing is the one with the guitar, Captaim Whammo is the guy with shades with the funny red black and yellow hat. Magneto Man has a magnet on his chest, Granite man looks like a roman statue, Super Scuba is in a blue scuba? suit, and Elevator Man  looks like he is on a safari but his power appears to be as giant man with a button control on his belt. The dvd plays as a three episode shorts with a play all selection. Of what I have so far seen the transfer is very nicely done, hench the 5 stars. The episodes seem like they would have great appeal for the young, but I found them to be very entertaining.",1377043200,14,727,4.0137931034482754

5886366,5,B00E1QLEJA,"I bought this because I wanted this television series in my collection. The price was great and the transfer was excellent. I had all but forgotten this Saturday morning favorite that aired on ABC, I think. It was made by the same group that did the Pink Panther cartoons. There are only a few people that watched this, but I did and Ioved it. The superheroes were offbeat and pure fun. The opening theme song was legendary.

5886385,5,B00E1QLEJA,"I remember watching these in the mid 60's when they first came out. I never saw any repeats nor any reissues on any novelty shows or channels. So as far as I can tell, they haven't been on the air since the late 60's.  The Network ran this show early, before the more ""serious"" Action Super Hero cartoons came on.  This was comedy and it never tried to be anything else and I enjoyed it as such. Super Boing came close to irritating me and my favorite of the 6 was Elevator man, my least favorite was Captain Whammo as the joke got old really fast.  Gary Lewis's theme was hip and cool.

I am having more fun watching them today since back then especially as they used the best voice actors of the day (hell of all time) and I enjoy hearing them perform",1415232000,,753,4.172413793103448

Yes kids, back in our day, we used to have to wake up early to watch cartoons as they weren't shown all-day!  The Super 6 was definitely among the top cartoons I looked forward to every week, especially the Adventures Of Super Bwoing (as well as Elevator Man and the rest).  The video on this is as crisp and sharp as you can expect from a cartoon of this age, and you can tell that it has been cleaned up quite a bit.  Overall, I am very happy that I can now share this with my kids.  High recommendations!",1407888000,3,632,4.056451612903226

5886400,5,B00E1QLEJA,"I thought I saw all the great cartoons as an 80s kid. So many reruns back then. This was a pleasant surprise. Although a few shorts are repeated many times, and Super Boing is the most often seen character, I love this. The intro song is so catchy my 8 month old son stops whatever he's doing every time it plays.",1400544000,,313,4.147540983606557
5886401,5,B00E1QLEJA,"I loved this cartoon when it aired on NBC Saturday Mornings in the late '60s (DFE's first TV show), and now it's available at a fantastic price for anyone, anywhere to see.  The theme song is great too, a killer tune by Gary Lewis and the Playboys.  I emphasize that anyone, anywhere can see this, because although I lived in a city with an NBC station that carried it during the years it was on the network, I now live near the Omaha TV market, and THEIR former NBC affiliate (it's CBS now) never carried it at ALL during those years.  I know this from seeing old TV Guide listings.  It's a shame those former kids missed a great show.  So if any of you are reading this, pick up a copy and see what you originally missed.

5886404,5,B00E1QLEJA,This little known series was part of the Saturday Morning madness of the 60's when we had an over flowing of great cartoons. This was only on one season.,1389052800,,153,4.310344827586207
5886405,3,B00E1QLEJA,"Finally watched this series. It has pretty good animation for the time, and i like some of the characters. I Really liked Granite Man and Elevator Man, very diffrent from the horde of heroes then  on the air. Elevator Man has a Sam Spade vibe going on, and he could've worked as a serious hero,  and i liked the way Granite Man spoke.l I think the writers here were reading something more than comic books!
  I kind of wish they'd done more with the other heroes. Super  Bwoing Gets old fast, and Brothers Matzoriley is funny--ONCE. Why so much of these guys? And it would have been nice to see the Six actually team up. It sounds like a series about a Super Team.
  No extras...and that's a shame. It'd be nice to know a little more about how this show was made. Model hheets or interviews, something.  But, overall I liked the show and it's certainly worth a viewing.",1388620800,,869,4.3875
5886406,4,B00E1QLEJA,"THE SUPER 6: DEPATIE/FRELING's long lost Saturday morning cartoon SUPER 6 spotlighted an agency of colorful heroes for hire, namely SUPER BWOING (a klutz on a flying guitar who talked in JIMMY STEWART's uncertain tones), SUPER SCUBA (think AQUAMAN), MAGNETO MAN (he sported a CARY GRANT voice), ELEVATOR MAN (who could shrink or grow to mammoth proportions), GRANITE MAN (a statue brought to life by his pigeon sidekick) and CAPTAIN ZAMMO (a flamboyant loudmouth). Boasting a hip ""instant ear worm"" GARY LEWIS & THE PLAYBOYS theme song, each show featured a SUPER BWOING toon, a segment starring one of his lantern jawed compadres and a BROTHERS MATZORILEY episode (average joe's, except for their three bickering heads). The story lines varied in quality while the cookie cutter villains, hardly in a league with THE DICK TRACY SHOW's FLAT TOP and PRUNE FACE, were given needed punch by voice vets PAUL FREES and DAWS BUTLER. Like TERRYTOONS' similar THE MIGHTY HEROES and the winged rodent BATFINK, THE SUPER 6 may be ""super-obscure"" now, but maybe...just maybe...that's what made them so special.

5886407,5,B00E1QLEJA,"""THE SUPER SIX"" was an NBC Saturday morning cartoon series,that debuted in Fall 1966. the very first Saturday morning cartoon
series from DePatie-Freleng,who at the time,was enjoying their success with their ""PINK PANTHER"" Theatrical shorts,which were
released thru United Artists and The Mirisch Corporation. their cartoon series ""THE SUPER SIX"" was a very creative and funny
spoof of all the Super Hero mania,inspired by the success of ""BATMAN"" in 1966,and the influence that followed! the charecters in
this almost forgotten cartoon classic,were just as funny! you have ""Super Bwoing"",a sappy teenager,who talks like James Stewart,
who flies on his Guitar,and utters.""ZIP!,ZAM!,ZOWIE!,and SWOOSH!""-which was clearly a spoof of Batman's then ballooned comic
labeling. then,you have the ever cool ""Elevator Man"",who dresses like he's on an African safari,aided by a belt,that can control his size-large or small,almost like DC Comic's ""The ATOM"",and that really cool voice,that gave this guy some great class! then there is
""Super Scuba"",another really cool player,who,with his sexy mermaid sidekick ""Bubbles"",did their duty for the ocean! and then,there is
the wacky ""Capt. Zammo"", an effete oafish,and clearly self involved zany,who is a laugh riot! and we have ""Magnetto Man"",who is obviously a Human Magnet,sans Marvel's ""Magnetto""-but on a very comedic level,who talks with an ""Ausie"" accent,with a little ""Cary
Grant"" thrown in,aided by a little boy sidekick. and last,but not least,is ""Granite Man"",a living statue of solid granite,and a very fancy
and gentlemanly hero,aided by a talking pidgeon,voiced by the late,great Daws Butler (YOGI BEAR) and finally,if not strangely,there
is ""The Brothers Matzoreily"", a tripple headed trio of morons,who have yet make to make any sense,in their well intended efforts of
whatever it is,that they do! while it isn't very about their history,""The Bros. Matzoreily"" were also seen in the opening credits of
United Artists/Mirisch's ""A SHOT IN THE DARK"",the second Pink Panther movie in 1964. all in all,this cartoon series was definately
a simple,but effective piece of good work,,looking almost and exactly like the Jay Ward cartoon charecters-especially with the voices of Paul Frees,Daws Butler,and June Foray,all of whom also worked as voiceovers on many of Jay Ward's shows,at the time!
seeing this NBC cartoon from 1966 really brought back great memeories-but DePatie-Freleng later became another big player of
providing the networks with lots of great and funny Saturday morning cartoons,until their very last series,""SPIDER WOMAN"",based
on Marvel Comics' Spider Man series,which aired in 1979 on ABC. but for ""THE SUPER SIX"",i highly recommend the show for people,who have very good taste in really simple cartoons,that have great writers,and really good voice over people. this 1966
cartoon series,was also co-produced by Mirisch-Rich Television,the production company which was responsible for the hit ABC
War Drama,""THE RAT PATROL""(1966-68) and ""HEY LANDLORD"",an NBC sitcom (1966-67) ironicly,Lee Rich was the executive
who,with Merv Adelson,formed Lorimar Productions in 1968. otherwise,this was one of the best cartoon shows from the late 60s!",1387065600,3,3203,5.688935281837161
5886408,5,B00E1QLEJA,a much overlooked animated series.. it was the start of my addiction with animation. the stories are trite and not really challenging but the fun and energy make up for the minor faults... truly enjoyable,1386201600,4,204,4.857142857142857
5886409,3,B00E1QLEJA,"This series is a missed opportunity.  Terrytoons did much better with The Mighty Heroes.  After the catchy opening theme song, you are hyped up for a good time.  Then the first cartoon comes on and the creativity ends there.",1385424000,,224,4.6923076923076925

5886411,5,B00E1QLEJA,love the pink panther and other cartoons they have done.i never even heard of Super 6 so I was worried it would not be any good..it is great..must be a part of your collection.,1382486400,,176,4.205882352941177
5886412,5,B00E1QLEJA,"This set of old Depatie-Freleng cartoons is simply beautiful! I remember watching the Super 6 on Saturday mornings when I was VERY young, and I've been searching for episodes everywhere. I managed to find a couple of bad copies of a few on some grey market sites, but into the trash they go!

This DVD set uses near-pristine transfers of the episode, with excellent soundtracks and no fuzziness in sound or picture! It's truly a joy to finally get to see Super Bwoing, Captain Whammo/Zammo, Magneto-Man, and the others! And the cartoons are still as fun as they were back in the day. I'm a super-hero/comic book geek, so it's a double pleasure.

They don't have the universal appeal of, say, D-P's Pink Panther series, but they are very enjoyable! If you're an animation fan or a super-hero fan, this set is worth checking out! And it's usually pretty inexpensive as well.",1381795200,4,872,4.730263157894737
5886413,5,B00E1QLEJA,"I completely missed this show when it aired back in 1966. I thought it was just another super hero program and stayed away. Believe it or not, it's really a humorous cartoon take on Super Heroics. All twenty episodes of the original program are here, with the bridges between the cartoons. Super Bwoing is in every show, and sounds like a very young Jimmy Stewart. He's really an incompetent teenage super hero, and rides through the air on his electric guitar. He has a funny relationship with the supervisor of the Super Six headquarters, sort of like Maynard G. Krebs and his teachers. Most of the Super Bwoing cartoons have strong or clever endings, the hardest part to write in a comedy script. The Matzoriley Brothers are the second cartoon in every episode. They are a three headed man with a separate personality for each head, one is timid, one is brash and one is Chinese. The voices are by Paul Frees and Daws Butler. These cartoons are weighed down by the complexity of the Matzorileys. They confront various villains and only a few of the cartoons are really well written. Some are very well animated, however, principally by Don Williams and Ed Love. The animation (limited as it is) was a lot of fun for me to watch. The balance of the show is divided among the other 5 heroes in the Super Six, Captain Zammo and his little sidekick, Super Scuba and his mermaid girlfriend, Magneto Man and his little boy sidekick, Granite Man and his pigeon and Elevator Man, who operates independently. Captain Zammo is the funniest, he leaves all the dirty work to his tiny sidekick, who loves Captain Zammo and never questions him. The layout design for these episodes is the work of Corny Cole and still retain a modicum of freshness 47 years after they were done. Granite Man and his Pigeon friend are OK, but have a potential that really isn't carried through in the stories, many of them have weak or inconclusive endings. However, the fact that Granite Man is a park statue most of the time until the Pigeon brings him to life has a slightly unsavory tinge to it that's humorous. Super Scuba's relationship with his Mermaid girlfriend has potential, but for the most part his adventures are routine, fighting underwater villains with outlandish submarines and ships. He's almost like Sam Spade and his secretary Effie, but without the innuendo. The underwater backgrounds are done with a ""salt resist"" technique that's not rich enough to be used in so many episodes.  Magneto Man and his boy sidekick are good looking charaters, but Magneto has one power, which are his magnetic hands, and the little boy is really the brains of the operation. This was designed to make kids feel good about their superiority over the adults in their lives. These episodes don't really have much build and are saddled with weak endings. Elevator Man is really the Joe Friday of the bunch, his power to enlarge and grow small is cleverly worked into his plots, the design and size changes are clever enough to make up for the usual weak endings. One episode is a tribute to ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"", as the life of Elevator Man is threatened after he loses his special enlarging belt; he shrinks down small enough to ride an ant up a wall!
I was very much surprised that this show was as good as it was. It's no Jay Ward, although the character and layout design was done by some of the same artists that worked on Ward programs. It's taking the Super Hero craze of the late 1960s and making fun of it. Friz Freleng's favorite gags abound, like the Matzoriley Brothers being crushed by a drawbridge several times in one cartoon. The DVD is of very good quality, played smoothly, beautiful color, good menu, no extras. Pick this one up, especially if you don't take your super heroics too seriously!",1378512000,16,3793,4.67814371257485
5886414,5,B00E1QLEJA,"An unexpected surprise. One for the quality of the release and two for the fact it got released in the first place!  This was the first made-for-TV animated series made by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises(The folks that brought us the Pink Panther theatrical shorts).  Although the animation quality is slightly lower budget - the writing and voice acting is still top notch. With familiar voices like Paul Frees, Daws Butler, June Foray & Artie Johnson(among others) you can't go wrong.
The series itself revolves around 6 super heroes-Super Scuba, Magnito Man, Elevator Man, Granite Man, Captain Zammo and the super hero in training Super Bwoing(the guy riding the guitar and always goofing up.)  The show also features The Matzoriley Brothers - A guy with 3 heads(and 3 distinct voices). The character likely modeled after a villain featured in an episode of The Inspector(also featuring 3 heads).  Each half hour program has 3 cartoons. A Super Bwoing, A Matzoriley Brothers and one featuring one of the other Super 6 characters.  It also has the in-between cartoon bumpers in tact(the way I wish some of the Hanna-Barbera cartoons of this era did).
One of the things I love about the series is the theme song - which for a fan of the music of the 1960's era - you'll recognize the vocal as it was sung by Gary Lewis!

The video transfer is absolutely gorgeous for a vintage series from 1966-Bright, Vivid colors and clear sharp lines.  Much better than what we've seen from many of the Hanna-Barbera series of the same vintage.  Sound is your typical clean mono-no major surprises there.  No bonus material-but for the price you can't really expect it.

I'm truly hoping that this only marks the beginning for more DePatie-Freleng series to see the light of day - such as The Houndcats, Bailey's Comets, Baggy Pants & The Nitwits, Super President, and maybe even some of the original TV versions of the Pink Panther show with original cartoon bumpers in tact.

If you enjoy the Pink Panther, The Inspector or The Ant & The Aardvark and like animation of this era - you should add this to your collection as well.  Supporting releases like this can lead to more like it-and that can only be a good thing.",1377216000,29,2203,4.783641160949868
