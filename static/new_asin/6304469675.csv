8205137,4,6304469675,"From the very beginning of this video up through the final curtain call, the San Francisco Lyric Opera's Mefistofele is an engaging and exciting feast for the senses. This is the sort of performance that is meant to be  seen and not merely heard - it would be an awful waste to lose out on the  beautiful visual displays throughout the opera. The meticulous attention to  detail is easy to see in every scene be it in the ornate sets and costumes  or the elaborate staging.
Ramey makes for an incomparable Mefistofele as  his always incredible vocal prowess is paired with a stunning visual  portrayal of the character. Dennis O'Neill's Faust, however, is one that  would do better to be heard on an audio recording as O'Neill's well-groomed  vocals are a pleasure to hear, but are brought down on video by his  mediochre acting - especially his nearly constantly wandering eye focus.  The soprano, Gabriela Benackova, puts on an adequate performance as well,  perhaps hindered by the fact that she had very little to work with from  O'Neill.
Overall, fantastic performance, well worth your while - didn't  get five stars because of Faust, plus the first angel scene during the  prologue seems a bit dragged.",955929600,16,1208,4.829268292682927
