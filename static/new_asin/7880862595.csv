1122673,2,7880862595,"Shanghai Calling uses the 'fish out of water' storyline: an American lawyer is relocated to Shanghai with his job and hilarity ensues. It's a film we've all seen many times before and either works really well (like Outsourced, for example) or limps along as a string of predictable scenes waiting for an ending. Unfortunately, this starts out with a relatively good 20-30 minutes but rapidly gets worse with every passing scene.

Everything shown in the trailer happens within the first 5 minutes of the film so we never get to explore the character before he's uprooted and moved. There's literally no context whatsoever about his life before the transition so it's difficult to really care how it affects him.

There are several mini plotlines that aren't particularly engaging. There's an unlikely romance between our lawyer and his relocation agent, a case of industrial espionage where the Chinese are painted as technological innovators unfairly targeted by mean Americans, and something to do with his secretary and her desire to escape her poor family upbringing. And then there's Bill Paxton - a wealthy senior executive who for some reason also works as a bartender.

What starts out as fairly light and entertaining starts to fall apart about half way where it becomes painfully predictable and the really, really weak dialog can't support the lack of characterization. I felt obliged to finish the film but ending up skipping through scenes towards the end just to get through it.",1361059200,2,1492,5.081632653061225
1122674,4,7880862595,"I've been interested in catching this film since learning about it months ago. As soon as I started the stream the plot began. No huge credits, pre-roll, or lead-up, but jumped right into it. This kind of approach followed the entire film and made it really easy to sit down and enjoy.

It has a great mix of humor, especially when the humor is built into the reality of the situation (a Shanghai native would easily forget to speak English in a casual phone call). The cast was attractive and familiar enough to add value to the overall production. I enjoyed a look at Shanghai, some hijinx, and a good message. There were some scenes that seemed to take away from the main story and just add some excitement, but in a way that took you out of the story a bit, but overall I really enjoyed the film.",1360886400,2,800,4.369127516778524
1122675,1,7880862595,"I wish i had my $5 back - I'd rather just order some asian fusion food - because that's how authentic this movie feels.

I've been to China a couple of times, and it is huge - there is no way you are randomly running into people the way homeboy ran into his crew in this movie.  This movie is a fantasy - like the hobbit, but in shanghai and with humans.  Also - if you miss the first 30 seconds of the movie, you miss the introduction of the conflict which most well done movies take about 15 minutes to get to.  I'm also familiar with law firms - non-chinese lawyers are not allowed to practice law, but that doesn't stop our keanu reeves looking hero from handing out business cards and running shop in shanghai.

It is true that there is some character development, but it is forced down your throat and it is unnatural (like asian fusion food).

The plot is contrived and has been done so many times before - I can sum it up like I can with 4,000,000 other movies - step 1: person forced into a new place; step 2: new place changes him for the better; step 3: chinese american ends up with white woman.  bam.

2 thumbs up out of 10 thumbs up.

I was fortunate to see his progression from new actor to now seasoned performer and couldn't wait to see this movie. Daniel has also appeared in X-Men Origins: Wolverine and most recently guested on Hawaii Five-0.
In 'Shanghai Calling' he plays the part of a lawyer who gets 'shanghaied' to China by his firm and watches his dreams change from wanting to become a partner to 'getting the girl' while exploring just what it means to be Asian. Of course a shower scene from this former model doesn't hurt either!

1122681,4,7880862595,"Shanghai Calling is an entertaining romantic comedy and very accurate portrayal of expatriate life in Shanghai, China. Daniel Hsia, the writer and director, has created a funny and strangely personal adventure of an American executive navigating the personal and professional idiosyncrasies of modern expat/Chinese culture. I can attest to this given I also was an expat executive in Shanghai. (Several scenes are shot in Vizcaya, the exact same housing complex I lived in from 2005 to 2008.) While it may not be as funny for those that haven't had similar experiences, there is still enough unique comedy scenes to make it an enjoyable romp for most. What makes it stand out from most of Hollywood's stereotypical coverage of life in China is that it takes conventional perceptions of China and turns them on its head.",1360627200,4,819,5.074074074074074

1123016,3,7880862595,"Daniel Henney kind of carried the movie. It had so much potential to be a ""slice of life"" movie about the unique quirks of living in Shanghai as an expat. The premise of the movie could've been used to show all the differences between city life in NYC and SH, but instead decides to go for the cliche romance story. There are unintentionally awkward scenes, as well as super corny dialogue. However, the movie does manage to put some interesting elements of living as an expat into the movie. The story is also cohesive, even if it is a cheesy and stereotypical rom-com. Daniel is also eye-candy, so there is that.",1457913600,,614,4.54054054054054

AmericaTown is an amusing conceit, and it was fascinating to have an inside look at the expat community in Shanghai.

It's like the missing piece of the puzzle living in today's world.  The compromises made to both countries in order to make this film are nearly palpable, but the content succeeds regardless.

1123635,4,7880862595,"""Shanghai Calling"" is a comedic look at crossing, and sometimes clashing, cultures.  The two main characters switch expectations when the ethnically Chinese male lead speaks no Chinese and has little desire to do so, while the (non-Asian) female lead speaks a considerable amount of Mandarin and is clearly excited about Chinese culture.

I highly recommend ""Shanghai Calling"" for both its entertainment value and its educational lessons.

1123803,4,7880862595,"SHANGHAI CALLING is an entertaining ""fish-out-of-water"" romantic comedy, an American-Chinese co-production.

Daniel Henney plays a hotshot young Chinese-American attorney, born and bred in New York City.  Hoping to make partner after winning a major case for his law firm, he is, instead, sent to Shanghai where he doesn't speak the language, nor is he comfortable with the culture.  It also appears that he is about to blow a billion dollar deal for a major client of his firm.

Written and directed by Daniel Hsia, SHANGHAI CALLING has a likeable cast, which includes Eliza Coupe, Alan Ruck and Bill Paxton, as well as several amusing sequences.  However, watching the film, I couldn't help thinking that it could have been much better had it not been a Chinese-American co-production.

Before I create an international incident, I should explain.

First, much of the dialogue in the movie is in Chinese, which is okay, but the subtitles are so small and flash by so fast on the bottom of the screen that it is difficult to read them, let alone watch what is happening on screen.  For example, what could have been a laugh-out-loud visual comedy sequence is totally squandered because one is trying to read the subtitles.

Second, screenwriter Hsia, at times, seems to forget that this is a story about Henney and his misadventures in Shanghai.  Yes, it is nice to build up the roles of the secondary characters, particularly those portrayed by Chinese actors, but those scenes distract from and impede the primary plotline.  Hsia does not protect the ""spine"" of his story and, in failing to do so, the ultimate conversion of Henney from a ruthless lawyer to a man with a conscience is not as convincing as it should be.

I am all for giving actors, whatever their nationality, more scenes, but not at the expense of good storytelling.

Still, SHANGHAI CALLING is an enjoyable way to pass two hours.

The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains a ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette.

1125016,4,7880862595,"SHANGHAI CALLING may not light any fires of excitement in filmdom but it is a successful dual country effort  to quash some misconceptions about China and the US and the news we hear daily.  And if it were for that alone it would be worth an evening's outing, but graced by a really top notch cast of fresh actors not well known  - yet - it becomes a tender little romp set in the spectacular beauty of Shanghai!

The story is a predictable one:a young handsome Chinese American Lawyer (a very fine young actor hunk Daniel Henney) who was born in America and speaks no Chinese at all is sent by his major law firm in New York to gain access into the big business happening in Shanghai - home of the manufacturers who make everything used in this country it seems! Once in China he encounters Chinese  customs of which he is ignorant, a language he does not understand, an ex-pat mayor of Americatown (Bill Paxton), a beautiful single mom (Eliza Coupe, another one to watch) who  has moved to China to give her  daughter a new life and is in charge of finding homes for new businessmen, a gorgeous assistant (Zhu Zhu)who falls for him, and a crazy ex-pat (Alan Ruck)who teaches English as a sideline to womanizing. When our young lawyer seems to fail at everything he intends to do he engages a fix-it guy humorously called Awesome Wang (Geng Le) and gradually our lawyer finds a new outlook on his cultural heritage, rights some wrongs, and falls in love.

Daniel Hsia directs and keeps the momentum  going throughout film - even when relying on the ubiquitous chase  scenes (here on bicycles). It is a fine introduction to coexistence between the new China and the somewhat backwards USA! Grady Harp, March 13",1364083200,11,1710,4.577049180327869

1125158,2,7880862595,"This could have been such a great movie.  Great casting, a funny story, a redemptive Rom-Com, a tale of two cities even...but no, it ends up a heavy handed piece of propoganda.  The ""Fish-out-of-Water"" theme starts off great, and the semi-dream sequences are hilarious.  The protagonist is perfectly understandable, and the writers create a very sympathetic image in which you are cheering for the guy even as you watch him get his richly deserved comeuppance.  The love interest is funny and sweet, and knows China like she grew up there.  The ex-pat mayor of Americatown is a traditional gone-west-to-make-my-fortune story. That is why I gave it any stars at all.

Unfortunately this is where the incredibly racist and ethnist stuff begins.  All the villians and idiots are white men, the Chinese speaking love interest is incredibly flawed and only her tough minded Chinese gal-pal can talk any sense into her.  Every Chinese person the protagonist meets is wise, urbane, sophisticated, and knows Western culture.  The writers can't help themselves it seems, and create a second love story, between the Chinese tech support guy and the protagonist's Chinese assistant which overshadows the main romantic story.  You could have sent the two Yankees home and the story would not even have missed them.  Even the Mayor of Americatown is replaced by a young, female Chinese-American (of course) lawyer.

The secondary plot about an invention being stolen from its inventor is so amazingly racist and nationalist as to defy imagination.  The government film company that made this movie misunderstands technology so badly, that they have a painter invent and engineer, on a whim, an entirely new smartphone, transparent and tactile at the same time.  No entreprenuerial spirit, no lab, no tech talk, no Steve Jobs vision or Michael Dell tenacity, just a guy painting landscapes who apparently has an advance degree in Materials Science, though we never hear anything about his education.  And it is of course the American owner of a real technology company that comes and steals the invention, when of course the artist/engineer licensed it to a home-grown Chinese manufacturer, who tells us in tears that his family invested their life savings to build what is clearly a state of the art production facility that would cost millions of dollars.

1) The acting is not good and the chemistry between characters is nonexistent.

2) The plot line is well-worn. I'm not sure how many times I've seen this movie now acted out in different countries. Know-it-all American business man goes to foreign (developing) country. Meets smart woman who knows the culture and who is initially disdainful of his bravado. Makes major gaffes based on his misunderstanding of the culture. Falls in love with woman. Starts to understand culture. Never wants to return to America.

3) The makers of this movie added a subplot in an attempt to entertain and educate. However, this subplot displays a cluelessness about gender dynamics in China. (Extremely beautiful Chinese women, in reality, are highly sought commodities and are not looking for nice guys who are the office schmucks.)",1362355200,2,1045,5.028901734104046

1125378,4,7880862595,"This is a simple, easy movie that you don't have to pay a lot of attention to the dialog, yet it's interesting for its perspective of an American as the foreigner in China instead of the usual in reverse.",1361836800,,204,4.256410256410256
1125379,5,7880862595,"funny, exciting, and with an interesting perspective on expats in China. Comedy, culture, a little love story, and some social commentary snuck in there. You won't be disappointed!",1361836800,,180,5.464285714285714
1125380,5,7880862595,"Has a good message with culture appreciation and some romance.  Also, has a good amount of humor throughout to keep you laughing.",1361836800,,129,4.863636363636363
1125381,5,7880862595,I totally enjoyed this and am glad I purchased the instant video. I'm a fan of Daniel Henney. He did a great job. There is good chemistry between the leads. It's an engaging storyline with some insight into the differences in the cultures. It makes me want to visit Shanghai and learn Chinese language and culture.,1361750400,,314,4.625
1125691,5,7880862595,"While the acting is ""meh"", the background scenery is great.  Many of the locations are places we frequented while living there.  If you've ever been to Shanghai, then you'll likely enjoy this one.",1361750400,,196,4.909090909090909
1125692,5,7880862595,"Shanghai Calling is funny, educational, entertaining and has a storyline. It shows how things work in other countries yet points-out that we all seek the same basic needs no matter how some may think we are worlds apart: love, joy and justice.",1361664000,2,243,4.809523809523809
1125693,2,7880862595,"Predictable story and no chemistry between the main characters. Watch to see Daniel Henley, because he is easy on the eyes.",1361664000,,123,4.904761904761905
1125694,1,7880862595,It didn't occur to me and my girlfriend until the credits rolled but this was a propaganda film. It's essentially a branding campaign for Shanghai to westerners. I have no idea who funded this project but the angle they work with is something to be acutely aware of.,1361577600,,266,4.5625
1125695,5,7880862595,"This movie captures the sense of alienation from one's ""home"" country in an entertaining and thoughtful manner, through the romantic/comedy genre.  Getting a look at modern day Shanghai was a nice bonus, too, and the leads are eye candy.",1361577600,,237,5.076923076923077
1125696,3,7880862595,"The basic plot of this movie has been done 1,000 times (fish out of water learns to love the locals) but it's a fun two hours to watch it play out in modern-day Shanghai. There are a few early scenes of the arrogant impatient American, but the movie quickly moves onto a few of the more subtle issues that arise when the two business cultures come into contact.

It's a  movie that is built around generalizations and finds its comedy by making fun of stereotypes. So, if you're sensitive to broad generalizations about (either) American or Chinese cultures be prepared to be mildly offended from time to time. All the common ""laowai"" archetypes are here: the ""old hand"" who couldn't make it in America but hit it big in China; the naive American businessman newcomer; the English teacher out to hit on Chinese women; the businessman who's a little *too* enthralled by Chinese culture. There also are some lovely scenes of a great city (Shanghai); the skylines of Pudong and the Bund should get Oscars for best supporting actors.  Highly recommended for expats living in (or considering a move to) China, so-so for everyone else.",1361577600,,1129,4.779487179487179
1125697,4,7880862595,"I stumbled across this movie while looking for something simple to veg out with.  A fun movie with a good cast, an reasonably original plot and no gratuitous violence or sex.  A good movie night movie",1361491200,11,200,4.527777777777778
1125698,4,7880862595,"This is a lightweight comedy with some very funny bits. The protagonist and co-stars are all good (particularly enjoyed ""Awesome Wang"") and the location, Shanghai, makes a nice setting. This is NOT a film about Shanghai per se, but about the adventures of expats in Shanghai. Very amusing.",1361491200,,289,5.041666666666667
1125699,3,7880862595,If one is looking for something mindless with so so acting and not much of a storyline this is for you.  If you have no time to spare do not rent this movie.,1361404800,,157,3.757575757575758
1125700,5,7880862595,"This adorable movie is well written. It is a love story, but more importantly, it is a story about doing the honorable thing. Not flashy, just lovely. Highly recommend!",1361059200,,168,4.827586206896552

7900140,3,7880862595,"If you've lived in China, this is a great movie to remind you of all the quirks of life. It's a little stereotype-heavy, but let's face it, most of these stereotypes (the ESL teacher who's only looking for Asian girls, the cheesy Sinophile who thinks he really gets China, etc) are pretty close to reality... The lead is VERY charismatic. The plot is predictable but enjoyable nonetheless. But... seriously... what waiguoren would call baozi ""steamed buns""?",1502496000,,457,5.026315789473684

7900144,4,7880862595,"I love this kind of story. It's a fish out of water concept with the main character moving to China for work as he tries to climb the ladder of success. Along the way he encounters interesting people and situations that causes him to rethink his life, solve main problems and end up a changed person. I love that it involves some of the slice of life of expats working and living in such a big and beautiful up and coming city. They make light of how it is always under construction. There are the scenes you assume will come with the usual misunderstandings and stepping on toes of misunderstood cultural cues. Daniel Henney was a good lead, it was great to see Eliza Coupe in her role and Bill Paxton was a bonus.",1487203200,,715,4.343283582089552
7900145,5,7880862595,Very entertaining and well acted. Loved the story line and the fact that Chinese have the same sense of humor as we do.,1486598400,,119,4.217391304347826
7900146,1,7880862595,This was seen in the cinema's and shot in 2.35:1 however Anchor Bay has chopped the sides off to give us a reduced 1.85:1. Yuck....,1480291200,,131,4.28
