8378675,5,B002RDQNH2,Great DVD of Keith Richards and the Expensive Wino's. I purchased this second copy by mistake but it made a great gift to another Keith Richards Fan.,1320710400,,149,4.555555555555555
8378676,2,B002RDQNH2,"There isn't much out there from the great X-Pensive Winos so it's worth a look, but the video and sound quality are awful. A good cell phone could do as well. A better title from the same tour is ""Live in Boston"" which is an import from Argentina and can usually be found on eBay and occasionally on Amazon. It's not exactly HD, but it sounds fine and the camerawork and editing are excellent. The band interaction really comes across and they were on fire that night. Between the first couple of songs, KR says ""We're the Winos. it's Saturday night and we're here to rock"". They delivered.",1305590400,7,590,4.472222222222222
8378677,2,B002RDQNH2,"Musics are great!
Even better than ""Live at the Hollywood Palladium"".

But this DVD's quality is very poor!
It has wrong aspect ratio, actually this film is 4:3(Standard)
but DVD player recognize as 16:9(Anamorphic).
So you'll watch the film stretch asaide, it's very strange.

I'm sorry my english is not so good, but I have to tell this to you All.",1303603200,12,350,4.721311475409836
8378678,5,B002RDQNH2,"Great video of the 1992-1993 Xpensive Winos tour.  The song selection is outstanding, the camera work is good and the sound quality is excellent.  This is highly recommended if you are a fan of Keith Richards.",1266451200,18,209,4.777777777777778
