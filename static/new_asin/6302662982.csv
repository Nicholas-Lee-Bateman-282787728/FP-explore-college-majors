7828917,4,6302662982,"This surprisingly terrific documentary includes loads of material NOT on the feature DVD.  From cartoonist Winsor McCay's legendary comic strip to character model sheets, storyboards, interviews with director William Hurtz (who worked on Disney's Pinocchio, Fantasia and Dumbo), voice actors Rene Auberjonois and Mickey Rooney, singer Melissa Manchester, choreographer Michael Peters (who worked on Michael Jackson's music videos Thriller and Beat It), and songwriters Robert and Richard Sherman (who composed Disney's Mary Poppins and The Jungle Book).

I would have given it five stars except for the short length, only 24 minutes to air in a half-hour time slot as a TV info-promo for the film's theatrical release.  Not very in-depth, but still nice to see all the rare behind-the-scenes footage.  This would make an excellent Bonus Feature on some future Special Edition DVD of ""Little Nemo.""",1289088000,,897,5.525547445255475
