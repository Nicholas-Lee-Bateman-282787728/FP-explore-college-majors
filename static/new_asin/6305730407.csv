Having lived here all my life (nearly 4 decades) I can say with all honesty that this is just ""okay"" for tourists, and doesn't come near to capturing the essence of this great city.  If I were considering a first time trip to New York, this video would not make me book my trip.  Has some good coverage of famous places, but views more like a long commercial than a video.  Save your money and just rent it from the library for free.",1039737600,,507,4.142857142857143
7895266,4,6305730407,"I visited New York in February 2001, and for me it's a wonderful city. With this video, I remember my week in the city. I like this tape, because it's no a classical video tour of the Big Apple. I recommended to all people was visited New York, buy it. Thanks.",1009238400,,260,4.117647058823529
