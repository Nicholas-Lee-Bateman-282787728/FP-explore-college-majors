On the plus side she has a great, toned body that looks as though she may have been a dancer. On the negative side, firstly, she should have re-recorded the introductions, because they're painfully amateurish. Secondly and more seriously, is the dangerous speed with which she does these exercises. Real Pilates is nothing like this, and I've been doing it for years. She's really aiming at an already fit, already supple, younger market, who want to do everything at breakneck speed, including talking. But to come to these deceptively simple movements, even at the beginners level, and try to race through them like she does, is heading straight for real injuries, especially the back. Everyone's a Pilates teacher these days, and she's an Australian - I think - who's following in the footsteps of her hyped up, frenzied American counterparts. And as a last word - the 'splits' as attention getting as it is, has zero to with fitness.",1514937600,,1090,4.834224598930481
