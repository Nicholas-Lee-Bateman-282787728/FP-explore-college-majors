8346214,5,B001VFM61Y,"For those of you out there who like a good drama/comedy show. Well here ya go! Don't confuse this with your cheesy ""seventh heaven"" type show. For those of you who aren't already fans, you might be surprised as to the edgy, difficult and realistically subjects covered in these first two seasons of Everwood. (Sex, STD's, Death, Underage Drinking, drug abuse, realistic family struggles and dynamics, etc) Sure it's light hearted and funny at times. But for me the best thing is how easy it is to relate to different characters through out the show. If you haven't been in these situations, then there's a good chance you know someone who has been. And if not, then you can at least understand and respect the perspective for which they are trying to convey. There are lots of good life lessons in both seasons, pretty much one per show. I challenge any nay-sayer to watch the pilot episode of the first season, and first episode of the second season if you question the talent of the writers and actors. The first DVD has some neat bonus stuff, unfortunately the bonus stuff isn't that impressive on the second season DVD set. Mostly just clips cut out from the episodes on that disc. However I personally could care less about bonus material considering they didn't even want to release the second season to DVD. (Shame on the WB) It's the full season 1 and 2 on DVD, great quality, easy to navigate between episodes and chapters. Most importantly it's all there, so you get the full story. I can only hope and wait for the WB to release season 3 and 4 so I can complete my set.",1255824000,,1580,4.5473684210526315
8346215,2,B001VFM61Y,"This is a great show to be certain but all this item is is both boxes shrink wrapped together in one order for $48. If you take the extra minute to do both separately, then season one is $13 and season 2 is $26. That's only $39.",1247788800,3,228,3.872340425531915
8346216,5,B001VFM61Y,"I loved ""Everwood"" when it was on television and it is just as good this time around.  I will get the whole series as it becomes available.  This series has every age group represented, unusual nowadays.  The community and families in the series are well rounded characters.  Everwood itself is a leading character.  Treat Williams is one of the finest actors around.  I just wish the series was longer.",1245456000,3,403,4.768115942028985
8346217,4,B001VFM61Y,"I ordered this series just for something different, having no previous knowledge of the tv show before, and just love it. It's just a good, down to earth series for all viewing ages; something that is hard to come
by in this day. I highly recommend it, whether you are a teen, or three times that.",1241568000,4,297,4.321428571428571
