But it is for sure filmed by some young dudes that thought it would be cool to make a movie and it's cool they tried  and im not sayin you did a terrible job for your experience level and having to use your friends as cast members and all that so keep workin at it, they might get better. But for us dudes that like cool movies...uh....this is just a case study of ultra beginner filmmakers and how lame they can be at attempting to make a movie sometimes and it's not something we can actually watch for very long because it sucks so bad.",1520208000,,669,4.1461538461538465
