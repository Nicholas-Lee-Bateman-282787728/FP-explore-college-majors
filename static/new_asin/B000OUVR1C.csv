8186791,5,B000OUVR1C,"Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Khubsoorat is a fantastic and simple family entertainment. It is well written, well acted and directed, and is thoroughly funny and exciting. I enjoyed every moment of it, including the songs, the story, the characters, and everything else it dealt with. Khubsoorat presents the brighter side of Hindi cinema, which is not melodramatic, which is more restrained and easy-going. The charm of this little gem comes from its depiction of simple everyday issues, but it also manages to make a genuine impact on the viewer. It portrays upper-class urban families beautifully, it is realistic throughout, and the acting is natural. The ever-amazing Rekha presents a different side of her personality. She lets go of her enigmatic sex-appeal and switches her exotic beauty with a tomboyish, endearingly naive look of a smart and witty girl-next-door. The result is effective - her comic timing is brilliant, and the zest she adds into her character makes Manju Dayal very memorable. Ashok Kumar is as always wonderful, gracious and likable all through as the kindhearted father, Dina Pathak is impressive as the overly strict mother, and Rakesh Roshan and Shashikala support well. I must note my favourite sequences towards the climax when Ashok Kumar's character falls ill and Manju worryingly looks after him. The scene in which he wakes up and realises she was there taking care of him was very moving. All in all, whoever you are, do watch Khubsoorat, it will make you feel much better. A pleasurable watch indeed!",1305849600,,1534,5.14
