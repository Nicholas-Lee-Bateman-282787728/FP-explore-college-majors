1352361,5,B00004TRD2,"I belive this is one of the best little Christmas storys ever written and animated. ALL my kids fell in love with Olive,even my 13 and 17 year-old! I think Drew Barrymore did a great job acting the part and I read the review from the person that says it's violent and rude. I think He/She is the one with a prob. Well I HIGHLY recomend this to kids and adults alike you'll be sure to fall in love every time you watch it!",983664000,8,421,4.023809523809524
1352362,1,B00004TRD2,"Before I begin you need to know I am writing as a parent of a 3 year-old who tries to limit television viewing to non-violent content for him at this age. If I was a single adult or childless my review would have been very different.

This video takes just a glimmer of the books' original content and makes a whole different story out of it. If you enjoyed this children's picture book then don't assume the video is the same story as I did. If anyone is wondering, the book is short picture book appropriate for babies on up. (The content of the book is innocent and happy, with no negativity or violence.)

I bought the video not having previewed it first, for my 3 year-old. It didn't seem necessary to preview a movie that was based on a picture book for children aged 4-8 and was a cartoon type movie for children. I was not happy with type of negative and violent content being marketed to young children. Based on my liking the story book, I assumed the story was the same and good, innocent content but I was wrong.

The video is peppered with negativity and language inappropriate for a small child. Here are just some of the things that go on that I didn't like:

Olive's owner loves her and is telling her that and she can't hear him. The flea is the interpreter and tells the dog that the owner doesn't love her and wants her to go away. Olive is upset and sad. (That amount of sad emotion seems out of place and unnecessary.)

Christmas is cancelled due to a reindeer being sick and children are upset.

Olive pairs up with a penguin (a character not in the book) who speaks like a mobster and sells fake Rolex watches and stolen stationery on the city streets out of a briefcase. Penguin explains that he stole the stationery when he was fired from his job at the city pound. One reason given for the termination was that he was smuggling in dirty magazines for all to read. (What are small children supposed to know about dirty magazines? As a parent what explanation am I supposed to give when my 3 year-old asks what that is and why it is so bad he'd get fired?)

There is a deranged, mean postal delivery man who hates Christmas since he doesn't like the increase in work load during the Christmas season. He kidnaps Olive and wants to hurt her. Olive escapes and rejoins the penguin.

Then they go into a North Pole bar full of nasty talking characters (including reindeer) who proceed to try to injure them by throwing them all over the room and threatening to throw them off the roof. Words such as jerk and idiot are used to name-call Olive and the penguin (who is now seen as a nice, good, character).

There is talk of how the North Pole area is in bad financial times all because Santa called off Christmas. Olive ends up flying with the reindeer and saves the day and Christmas is on.

I have no idea what the producers where thinking and to what age this would be appropriate. This is nothing like the old Christmas shows I remember from my childhood such as Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman. Marketers of the video stated this is bound to be a new Christmas classic-if this is indicative of what our society thinks as good entertainment for young children and classic material our society is really in trouble!",977875200,43,3260,4.418333333333333
1352363,5,B00004TRD2,"Somehow I stumbled across ""Olive, The Other Reindeer"" when it was shown on Fox and got instantly sucked in. The 2D computer animation was amazing. It had such a strange and interesting appearance compared to either traditional 2D or ""Toy Story"" type 3D and was the perfect medium for bringing an originally illustrated story to life. Unlike the picky people here who resent Drew Barrymore voicing Olive I didn't know who pretty much any of the actors were when I first saw this movie and enjoyed their work an awful lot. Yes it got a little rough at times in that you don't expect to see reindeer roughing anyone up in a standard Christmas story but I felt it was not objectionable. And yes Olive has a really tough time getting past all the difficult and cynical people she comes across, but guess what people? That's just like life! Olive perseveres and with the help of her trusted friend succeeds. A sweet Christmas story and a good lesson all wrapped up into one.",976579200,12,968,4.601156069364162
1352364,5,B00004TRD2,"The animation looks nothing like The Simpsons, which shows Matt Groening's versatility in the animation business.  The story is warm and sentimental (like the specials Rudolph and Frosty) with a touch of cynicism.  There seems to be a debate here whether or not Drew Barrymore was an appropriate choice as Olive.  I'll just say I think she is and we'll leave it at that.  However, Dan Castellaneta (aka Homer Simpson) steals the show as the disgruntled Postman (""Bah, bug, and hum!"").  Like the Grinch and Scrooge (classic Christmas crabs), he's a mean one- and determined to ruin Christmas and Olive's chances as the ""other reindeer""!  Also, Michael Stipe (REM) plays Schnitzel in the bar scene.  Kudos to Matt Groening and merry Christmas to all!",976579200,,748,4.983870967741935
1352365,5,B00004TRD2,"My family loved Olive the Other Reindeer. It's the story of a cute dog whose pet flea convinces her that Christmas will be cancelled unless Olive, the other reindeer, helps Santa out. Of course, Santa really said ""ALL OF the other reindeer"", but Olive is convinced otherwise, and makes her trek to the North Pole.
The voice for Olive is played by Drew Barrymore, who does a fantastic job. The simple song she sings at the beginning and end of the movie is so cute, and really adds to the special feeling the film has to offer. From the opening shot, the animation is amazing ... it truly has to be seen to be appreciated. The rest of the movie's music is also excellent, and it brings a very festive, joyous tone to the film.
Overall, Olive the Other Reindeer is sure to become a classic holiday hit, that your family will enjoy season after season!",976233600,11,849,4.448717948717949
1352366,2,B00004TRD2,"I wasn't too pleased. I bought this video for my three-year-old because he loves the book--which is sweet and innocent (Olive ACTUALLY does think she must be a reindeer) AND sooo beautifully drawn, but the movie is filled with mean people and animals who are anti-christmas, shysters or simply selfish. The entire way through the movie Olive is working her way against miserable characters. I had a difficult time watching this and finally turned it off after Olive got to the North Pole--the reindeer beating up on Olive in the bar was just too much. This isn't funny for a three-year-old innocent, it's just mean. I would not recommend this video for young kids, unless your child watches, and is used to, meanness and selfishness.",975801600,11,733,4.872
1352367,3,B00004TRD2,"Olive The Other Reindeer is a very cute movie with one big problem....Drew Barrymore.  When it comes to envisioning Olive's voice, they should have gotten someone who can do a voice that is neither male nor female.  It needed to be a mix of the two, because it's a cartoon dog!  With a female or male voice, it seems too human, and that's where this movie goes wrong.  Some people have a good voice for animated characters, Drew Barrymore does not.  I know I'm going on and on about Barrymore,  but she just does not work in this role at all, and I was kind of disappointed, because the movie could have been so much better.  Olive has a great story, and the rest of the casting is perfect.  The movie is mainly for kids, but I enjoyed it just the same.  The animation is really cool, and very unique.  Overall, it's a fairly good movie that could have been a great movie if not for Barrymore.",975715200,,893,4.293413173652695
1352368,4,B00004TRD2,"This tale of a Christmas-loving dog who tries to help Santa make his deliveries is both cute and innocent enough for young kids and hip enough for their Gen X parents.  For example there's a great line that parodies the ""you're no Jack Kennedy"" remark Lloyd Bentsen made to Dan Quayle in the 1988 VP debates.  That's going to go over the head of any kid, but they'll be wondering why Mommy and Daddy think it's so funny.  And that's not the only joke snuck in for the grown ups.
With a larcenous penguin as a companion, Olive meets interesting and interestingly-named characters as she heads to the North Pole to save Christmas.  This special truly deserved its Emmy nomination and will entertain both you and your kids.
A last bit of trivia: When Drew Barrymore (the voice of Olive) was in Woody Allen's musical, ""Everyone Says I Love You"", she was the only star in it who was able to convince Woody her singing was so bad that she should have a voice double for her songs.  That should make it all the more interesting when you get to hear Drew sing in ""Olive, The Other Reindeer"".",974332800,29,1083,4.44949494949495
1352369,5,B00004TRD2,"I just saw, Olive the Other Reindeer a couple of days ago with my neice on video, and I have to say it is one of the best Christmas specials I have ever seen.  Now, I am a Grinch who stole Christmas man myself, and even though that will always rank number 1 in my book, Olive is a close 2nd!  Olive is a cute Jack Russel who, fearing that her owner doesn't love her anymore, wants to impress him with helping save Christmas.  It seems that Blitzen has hurt his hoof and Santa needs help from, ""all of the other reindeer"" but Olive hears, ""Olive, the other reindeer!""  The animation is wonderful and the wit of the piece kept me interested for the whole short 45 minutes.  This video certainly will have a prize place on my shelf!  Oh, Drew Barrymore is great as the voice of Olive.",972864000,14,781,4.208053691275167
1352370,5,B00004TRD2,"This is the most adorable movie. It was featured on FOX, as a Christmas special. Drew Barrymore uses her lovely voice to portray Olive, a little dog who thinks he is ment to be one of Santa's reindeers. An evil postal  worker plans to ruin Christmas, and stop Olive. It is such a wonderful  story; soon to be a new Christmas classic. It is so cute, and a must to  buy. Anyone will love this movie.",961113600,17,397,4.197368421052632

1352464,5,B00004TRD2,"We viewers get all kinds of fare for the holidays. Luckily for kids, they haven't seen it all a thousand times over. Unlucky for parents, we have. Even more unlucky is a lack of creativity or risk taking by producers to try something that isn't a 'sure thing'.

The sure thing is what we always seem to get these day: the impossibly perfect protagonist triumphs over a problem with the help of friends and catchy bland songs along the way. The dolls hit the shelves, the character hits the lunch boxes, shirts, and whatever else they can stick it on and then we get the same thing next year. Of course common imagery and ideas from 'classic' Christmas entertainment is pulled in along the way and that's how it all works.

This is different- it has life and honesty. Characters are grumpy, indifferent, multi-dimensional, but the lovable dog pushes through it all with the help of an unlikely Christmas ally- a scoundrel penguin who sells counterfeit watches on the side.

There are too many subtle jokes to count- each one a pleasant discovery for adult viewers, but at the same time this is sweet and funny enough to keep kids entertained as well. I'm always impressed how songs aren't just added willy-nilly for extra-sweetness or filler.

The guys in the family love it as well as the gals.  It's a new Christmas season movie tradition at our house.  I  will say (for those reading this that want to know what a movie ""teaches"" in it's philosophy) that the ""worldview"" of the movie is pretty straight forward: that the message of Christmas is that we should try to do good to deserve the good things we get.  While I disagree with that idea, because I know the message of Christmas is that Jesus came to save sinners, (not that we can deserve the good things we get), it's still a very fun movie that I heartily recommend.",1392249600,,874,4.364197530864198

The movie is great for kids, and I enjoyed it as an adult. It is a little kiddish because there are 3-4 musical numbers throughout the movie, but there are also some jokes in there that only adults would understand.

Cute, clever, funny and sweet without being cloying, this is the story of a dog named Olive who hears the phrase ""all of the other reindeer"" during a radio newscast about Santa's possible Christmas cancellation and instead thinks she heard Santa calling her for help as ""Olive, the other reindeer.""

Voiced by Drew Barrymore, Olive is touching and sure to become an annual tradition in our household, which is why I immediately bought the DVD (and the book) for my little guy after discovering it on cable TV earlier this month.

To answer another reviewer's question, yes I have seen Tom and Jerry cartoons, however I do not let my children watch them.  In fact, my kids don't watch any TV at all and earn 1 movie night a week.  They were very confused by all the violence and anger in the Olive movie.  ""Why did the postman take Olive and the penguin?  What was he going to do with them?  Why were those people in the restaurant throwing them?  Would they really throw them off the roof?  Why did Olive lie to that police man?  You're not supposed to lie!""

Plus turning the cross upside down is just wrong, and spitting on the bible was the worst thing EVER.

... OBVIOUSLY MY REVIEW IS PARODY.

I'm tired of these 'parents' who are complaining about this movie.

Have you NEVER seen a LOONEY TUNES or TOM AND JERRY cartoon? FAR more violence in ONE of those than in this whole film, which was cute as can be.

1352530,5,B00004TRD2,"OTOR is one of those offbeat animated films that belongs in the same class as other regular films, such as Elf. Elf is one of those rare films that is unique amongst the already crowded genre of Christmas themed movies.....and OTOR also belongs right next to Elf. This has such a unique style of animation as they were trying hard to match the drawing style of the original children's book with the same name. Animation often tries to make us see cartoon characters in 3 dimensions (the exception being some of the Saturday morning cartoons  that have been produced in the USA). OTOR the book was very much drawn as 'flat' 2 dimensional characters, and the film tries to capture that same flat perspective. The film has a good mixture of voices for the various characters. Coincidentally, Edward Asner, who played Santa in the Elf movie, also plays Santa in OTOR. Age wise, this movie will probably entertain from age 10 on up. There is little that would scare a small child, and the ending turns out as expected. There is a hilarious 'North Pole' area bar that is a treat to watch for adults. Unlike, ""Charlie Brown Christmas"" animated film [which I also feel is still worth watching again each year around Christmas], OTOR has elements that amount to quick sight gags that the animators have slipped into the background of many of the various scenes. Many of these can be missed upon the first watching of the film, but the magic of DVD, is you can quickly rewind and slow down the playback to better catch these bits of humor. The only element that might offend some individuals would be the casting of the USPS mailman as the villain, especially if you work for the USPS. There are a good number of puns, both in some of the background scenes and the actual dialogue. Some of these will go over the heads of younger children, but be perfect for older adults. Around our house, the catch phrase....""except the bunny"" is used in context when we talk about good and evil. This DVD was out of print for a while, and I hope it is kept in production so that others can enjoy this film without the annoying 'USA' or ""Cartoon Network"" logos plastered on the bottom of the screen when OTOR shows on regular television.",1231804800,,2213,4.574307304785894

With the voice talents of Drew Barrymore, Dan Castellaneta, (of Simpsons fame), Michael Stipe, and music by swing band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, the film has a definite 90's vibe - the humor and attitude, as well as some semi-obscure pop culture references, root this film to the time it was made, but I don't think it is really ""dated"".

Drew Barrymore, who is one of my faves, just cannot sing.  It is so bad that I swear they forced all the other characters including Michael Stipe of REM, to sound horrific.  If this is not enought to grate on your nerves, the animation is jerky so you feel quesy watching it.

The villian in this heart felt story is a disgruntaled mail carrier who is writing scathing letters to Santa so Christmas will be canceled and he won't have to work so hard.  I don't know about you but my mail carrier goes above and beyond expectations at the holiday season.  It seems a wrong type of villian for a children's Christmas movie.

The side kick is a Penguin that sells stolen goods.

The book is ADORABLE.  I think everyone should read it but this movie is not worth the time of day.  Had I known more about it I would not have purchased it.  Yes, my children like it. However, there are many movies out there that appeal to children without really taking into account what is appropriate for children. I could forgive it if the performances and animation were good.

1352558,5,B00004TRD2,"Olive is a female brown and white mix, housebroken and owned by Tim. The voice for Olive is Drew Barrymore, also one of the Executive Producers along with Matt Groening (The Simpsons). Olive, The Other Reindeer is adapted from the book of the same name.

Anyone familiar with The Simpsons will enjoy the humor in Olive, The Other Reindeer, as well as the animation and witty dialogue that passes quickly in this forty-five minute movie. Either four or five times the characters break into song and dance that flows along with the story line. The neighborhood mailman is the only one who does not want Christmas to happen. He breaks into a solo song that adds its own animation portraying the heartache a Mailman goes through for several weeks each year. This is due to strain on his shoulders from the heavy bags carrying catalogs, cards and gifts.

The voice for the Mailman is that of Dan Castellaneta (Homer on The Simpsons), he is a short man with black hair and moustache that dons many disguises along this journey that takes Olive to the North Pole. One of the funniest scenes is in the beginning when Olive helps an animal family snag a Christmas tree. The problem is that the trees are too big for them, but Olive returns with a small green pine tree that is really the air freshener kind you hang on your car mirror. This gag went unnoticed by my son, but adults sure would get a kick out of this scene.

Olive is not your typical dog that barks or digs holes, instead she has a pet flea that cannot hear very well and mistakes an announcement over the radio that sets the journey for Olive, The Other Reindeer. While moving the dial around on the pink radio Olive is wrapping the slippers she is giving her owner Tim for Christmas. Tim is upset because Santa just cancelled Christmas because the reindeer Blitzen has broken a leg and Santa cannot fly with only seven reindeer.

The first time I viewed Olive, The Other Reindeer it certainly did sound like Santa stated he would have to get Olive, The Other Reindeer, but he was really saying ""All the other reindeer"". While this slip up seemed easy to make, Fido (the pet flea) made a few more blunders when Tim was calling into the pet house to Olive. Fido made it seem that the apology Tim was giving to Olive was the other way around and this angered Olive so much that she decided it was up to her, Olive, The Other Reindeer to make sure Christmas would come.

The character of the Mailman is a bit evil and treats the animals badly, so this might be hard to watch for smaller children. In Olive, The Other Reindeer the roles are reversed and instead of the Mailman being scared of the dangerous attack dog, it is the Mailman we need to keep an eye on. It turns out that all the letters Santa has received were really the work of the Mailman, each one telling Santa how much they hated Christmas. While the journey to get to the North Pole is going on we also see news media camped on the hill at the North Pole while Santa and the reindeer discuss what to do.

This is certainly a holiday film worth purchasing for the family or grandkids to watch the days and nights leading up to Christmas. The animation was reminiscent of The Simpsons, with the same brand of humor mixed in. Edward Asner is the voice of Santa Clause. The color is vibrant through out the movie with a fast pace of silliness thrown in.",1099699200,3,3371,4.429032258064516

1352560,5,B00004TRD2,"This isn't like Rudolph The Rednose Reindeer nor the more traditional holiday fare like Frosty. We fell in love with Olive's story when we picked up the hardcover children's book some time ago. The 1999 television adaption that originally ran on Fox keeps much of the spirit of the original book. The adaption and extension of the original story is quite good as well.
Blitzen has broken a leg and Santa may not be able to deliver all his Christmas toys this year. In a television interview he mentions that without the help of ""All the other reindeer"" Christmas may literally not get off the ground. Olive, a dog who believes completely in the Christmas spirit (and who can, of course talk and has her own television in her doghouse)becomes convinced (with a little pushing from her pet flea)that Santa actually said ""Olive the other reindeer"". Olive believes that her owner doesn't care for her anymore (due to the poor hearing of her pet flea. He confuses what her owner says and leads Olive to believe that she isn't loved or wanted. He needs to get his ears checked, Olive).
Convinced that without her help Christmas won't happen, Olive makes a trek to the North Pole. An evil postal worker though tries to stop her along the way--it seems he has problem with Santa going all the way back to his childhood. Olive also gets help from a penguin.
The animation is surprisingly true to the original artwork of the book. The computer animation is rendered as such as that the characters don't have the rounded look of most CGI creations giving Olive a unique look all its own. The songs aren't as instantly memorable as Rudolph The Rednose Reindeer (which everybody seems to forget wasn't a Christmas traditional. It was created for the Rankin-Bass Christmas television special) but, perhaps, these clever songs might eventually occupy a special place given time.
Drew Barrymore gives an outstanding and sincere performance as Olive as do all the supporting voice cast. It's a fun, clever and has multiple levels of humor. Children and adults can watch the program and appreciate the show's humor and get something different out of it every time.",1071360000,7,2146,4.818428184281843

Hey, there is a reason Nordstorm picked up on Olive and made it their advertizing campaign!",1069027200,3,475,4.987341772151899
1352562,5,B00004TRD2,The best childrens christmas video I 've seen.  We-my son is 5 and a half-watch it throughout the year because it is one I never get tired of and laugh every time.  It  is not just comedy either but very sweet and filled with feeling. Same quality as the British Wallace  and Gromit videos.  A gem!,1040342400,3,298,4.25
1352563,5,B00004TRD2,"I think that the word CHRISTmas is somewhat outdated. This is not just a religous holiday anymore. We many different people in the USA that's what makes it great. Some beleive in Christ some don't. Don't you agree if you were making a movie about the holidays and knew all people were watching whay offend anyone. Like Jewish people ect. The movie a about a cute dog that thinks its a reigndeer. ITS GREAT! Pleople who find this offensive need to read some really offensive material ""the bible""",1039219200,5,494,4.625
1352564,1,B00004TRD2,"I'm trying to think of a worse Christmas special and the only thing that comes to mind is Frosty 2...yet it, at least, was not offensive.  Matt Groening needs to stick to adult fare.  All three of my children (ages range from 7 to 15) hated it.  It was boring, the music was absolutely horrendous, and the characters (with the exception of Olive and a few others) were obnoxious and morally reprehensible.  Yet these deviants were presented as ""good-hearted.""  I can't believe Michael Stipe lent his voice to the lyrically challenged Schnitzel.  What was he thinking?  How anyone could compare this tripe to films such as ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is completely beyond me.  Please, bring back Charlie Brown, Frosty, Rudolph, and Jimmy Stewart.  If ""Olive"" is what we are heralding as a heartwarming Christmas classic, our country (and indeed the world itself) is in even more trouble than I thought.  Cartoon Christmas characters going into a bar?  Come on, Hollywood, get real.",1039132800,15,976,4.92638036809816
1352565,5,B00004TRD2,"Arguably, this is the best Christmas movie to come out since Jean Shepherd's ""A Christmas Story"" (which, it surpasses) and ranks up there with ""Scrooge"" with Alastair Sim and ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and ""Miracle on 34th Street""  with Edmund Gwynn.  It is a story which celbrates giving, not getting--and giving with great effort, way beyond one's means and talents.  It is a joyful story that we share yearly with our daughter who is now eight.  The dialog is witty; the songs are catchy; the animation is enjoyable.  The story is simple:  a dog mistakenly think's she is Santa's replacement reindeer and has the chutzpah and will to prove it.  Even Pope John Paul II makes a cartoonic cameo appearance as the recipient of a rather fetching baseball cap!  It far surpasses the rest of the Christmas drivel that shows up every December, year after year.  To paraphrase Linus in ""A Charlie Brown Christmas,"" it reminds us of what Christmas is really about.",1038614400,6,954,4.803680981595092
1352566,1,B00004TRD2,"Let me get to the point:
1. Only written Christmas word on a storefront is written ""X-Mas""
  This should be offensive to any real Christian
2. Penquin refers to pornography in explaining away his reckless
  lifestyle (dirty magazines)
3. There is a burly lumberjack character in bar who, along with irreverent reindeer, physically and verbally bully Olive. Eventually they are told off by Olive and feel guilty.  It's then that we find out that the lumberjack character's name is ""Round Young Virgin.""  How offensive is that!
3. Finally when Olive finally arrives at the North Pole we see at least 4 or 5 shots of of Santa's castle.  And what's perch up on the highest tower???  A Mennorah!!!
(...)
Excuse me for not sounding very Christian myself, but I wanted to do my part to inform fellow ""true"" Christians that they should stand clear of this horrific rendition of an otherwise wonderful Christmas story by Michael ""Christ""ie.
Which reminds me, beware the illustrated version by J. Otto and Vivian Walsh.  Although not nearly as offensive as the video, it never, not once mentions the word Christmas in print.  Hmmm...
Read between the lines folks.

1352567,5,B00004TRD2,"How could you not love this story?  The title alone will make you smile!  But then someone got the great idea of animating this story of a small but brave little dog named Olive who jumps at the chance to join Santa's team of reindeer when Blitzen is injured AND letting Drew Barrymore do the voice of Olive.  By the time you recognize the voices of Dan Castallaneta, Ed Asner, Peter MacNichol and Michael Stipe, you realize that they all signed on because this is a quality holiday story.  It has been a long time boys and girls since we have had a new one this good to enjoy during the holiday season.  Even if you have not enjoyed the charming book by J. Otto Seibold and Vivian Walsh, you will adore the movie.  Or visa versa.  If you have kids they will want to watch this one over and over, but do not worry about it; you will not mind that one bit.",1000080000,21,855,4.176829268292683

The animation is superb, Drew Barrymore was perfect -- persistant in her determination to do right in the face of all obstacles. Some complain about the situations, but really it is no different than many other classics (Grinch) in contrasting the goodwill against the negativity to be won over. A heartwarming inspiring story with lots of fun for everyone.",994636800,9,482,4.75

Of course it's different from the book so once we got the DVD, my son has zero interest in the book - but it's a fair trade off. It's cute. Even I sing the songs now lol.

""Olive"" (voice of Drew Barrymore) is actually a small dog, but when she hears Santa on the radio refer to ""All of the other reindeer"" she mishears it as ""Olive, the other reindeer"" and takes off for the North Pole with her friend Martini the penguin.  This kids' show is actually a mini-musical about the joys and difficulties of striving for the flying reindeer life.  Really, I'm not sure why this show got so little network play when it first appeared, but happily it is available in DVD now, and cheaply.  Merry Christmas!",1506902400,2,601,4.588785046728972
