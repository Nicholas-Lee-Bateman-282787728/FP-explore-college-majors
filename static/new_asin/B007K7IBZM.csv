8518850,5,B007K7IBZM,"Fernando Di Leo must be one of the most underrated Italian movie directors of the 20th century.  Too bad so little of his films have been released mainstream, the folks who really appreciate grindhouse cinema would definitely enjoy watching his phenomenal films, which are saturated with exquisite sex scenes, amazing music scores, and brutality.  After viewing his collection of movies from the 1970's few years ago (among which were: Caliber 9, The Italian Connection, The Boss, Shoot First, Die Later, or Kidnap Syndicate), I knew what I was to expect before I sat down to watch Madness (1980).  The film is about an escaped convict Gino (Joe Dallesandro) who after stealing a car heads towards a cottage where years before he stashed away a loot from a robbery.  When he arrives at the cottage he notices that it is occupied with a ""dysfunctional"" family, a sexy but nave wife, macho wannabe husband, and the sleazy sister-in-law.  What fallows next one can imagine...

The poster on the DVD is actually very misleading...no cleaver is being used in this film, but rather a pickaxe and an old-school double-barreled shotgun.  Also, there is really not much violence in this film...there is plenty of tension, and even more of great music.  The soundtrack includes music by: New Trolls, Luis Bacalov, and Roberto Soffici.  The first sex scene in the film performed by the husband (Gianni Macchia) and wife (Patrizia Behn) is without a doubt in my mind, one the hottest/erotic scenes I watched in a long time.  Add to that the song ""Dimenticare"" by Roberto Soffici and I guarantee that after watching the scene you will be aroused...Patrizia Behn who plays Lillian the wife of Sergio is beyond sexy...she has Oriental eyes and the body and figure of a sexy Italian bombshell, and she knows how to dress in order to highlight her smooth figure.  Which brings me to my last observation, all the actors and actresses (2 men, 2 females) are young, beautiful, with sex appeal, and know how to dress trendy for its time period.  I also, like the concept of the filmmakers to make the viewer sympathize and even identify with the main hero of the film...or perhaps anti-hero...but you need to watch the film to make your own assumptions about who is good and who really is the antagonist in this flick.

The entire film can be viewed on YT for free with English subtitles...under Madness ( Vacanze per un Massacro ) [Film Completo Ita] sub eng",1440115200,12,2438,4.817745803357314

He escapes from prison , kills two farmers for their car and proceeds to a country house where he buried 300 million lire 5 years previous but now finds it occupied by a trio of misfits who he must get out of the way in order to collect the spoils.  This is the premise of the latest release from Raro Video ,Director/Screenwriter Fernando Di Leo's 'MADNESS' aka 'VACANZE PER UN MASSACRO'- 1980.  Basically a four character play, the film cannot be pinned down to any genre and it may not be for everyone with its doses of kinky sex and violence but you can say one thing, you cannot take your eyes off the screen. The film has a surprisingly good performance by Andy Warhol alumnus Joe Dallesandro as Gio but the real scene stealer is the sex pot performance by actress Lorraine De Selle who sexually manipulates both her sisters husband and Gio.  Director Di Leo keeps the movie moving at a rapid clip till its incredible climactic punch line due to an excellent classical rock music score by Luis Enrico Bacalov who scored many a Spaghetti Western including Director Sergio Corbuccis's classic 'DJANGO' -1966 which can now be heard in Director Quentin Tarantino's small hommage to the Euro Western 'DJANGO UNCHAINED'. He completely fills the movie landscape as the score bursts forth endlessly in the background and out of the car radios and transistor radios used by the characters. Raro Video releases the film in a beautiful 1.85 transfer in Italian with English subtitles but skimpy on the extras with a Director Biography and Filmography also found in the illustrated booklet provided within the slipcase.  Raro Video deserves kudos for continually releasing the works of this remarkable artist including the fabulous box set of his crime movies this past year and it deserves to be in every Euro fans film collection.  Recommended for lovers of offbeat cinema, its more than just a kinky diversion and emerges as an interesting character study between these warped individuals presented by a master filmmaker.",1357430400,16,2069,4.863636363636363
