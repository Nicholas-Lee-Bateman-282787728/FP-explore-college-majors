8323555,5,B001LAGDOU,"Okay, so it may not be DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, but despite never being released in the US in any form, I love this movie. You've got a French racing team dueling with an American team at LeMans. It's a generally moody film, stylishly directed, with drama, heartbreak, car chases, and it does feature a familiar face to US audiences, the lovely Diane Kruger from TROY and the NATIONAL TREASURE series. I have purchased the DVD three times, and finally here's the one I always wanted: the original French language version with English subtitles in widescreen format, on Blu-Ray to boot. While the Dolby TrueHD audio is somewhat unconvincing (rear channels are a little TOO active, and center channel not quite active enough), the picture is sharp, vibrant, and colorful, far better than I have ever seen it before. I would like to thank the previous post for his or her review, as I wouldn't have known what was actually for sale here. I was pretty sure that the only Blu-Ray version out there was the non-subtitled Japanese release (which is what is pictured), but the disk I received from ImportCDs is indeed from China or Taiwan, manufactured by New Movie Studios--at least near as I can tell--with a different cover and no bonus features. For MICHEL VAILLANT fans (and I'm sure there's plenty besides me in the USA), this is sort of the Holy Grail, at least so far. And if you can get your hands on a copy, I also recommend the soundtrack.",1247443200,,1433,4.66798418972332
8323556,3,B001LAGDOU,"This is what I like to call a popcorn movie in the same vein as Days of Thunder or Top Gun, but with better special effects.  As a matter of fact you might be reminded of a few scenes from those films.  Also be forewarned that there is some anti-Americanism on the part of Team Leader.  The disk itself is a bare bones blu-ray disk.  There are no extras, and the language track alternated between French and English with the option of English or Chinese subtitles.  The disk is region A with is North/South America, and East Asia (except China).",1231545600,,545,4.41
