1921896,4,B0000DBK9X,"""Interstella 5555"" is a brilliant take on music videos, movie musicals, and anime.  ""Interstella"" is ""Fantasia"" for a new generation, but instead of orchestrated music, you have the sound of Daft Punk.
The film follows a rock band of four blue humanoid looking aliens.  During one of there concerts on there home planet, they are kidnapped by a evil record producer named Earl de Darkwood.  He takes them to Earth and forcefully transforms them into a band for humans.  There only hope is another alien space jockey named Shep, who is the only one who can save them.
The art in this movie is gorgeous.  Leiji Matsumoto's work in ""Interstella"" is a perfect example of why 2-D animation is not dead yet.  The character models are very nice looking and the backgrounds flourish with depth and color.
Daft Punk's music is a matter of taste.  You ether love the club/funk/rock genera, or you do not.  Because there is no dialog, the music not only must set the mood, but also tell the story and if you don't like the music, then you probably won't like the film.  All the music is taken form the album ""Discovery"" and fits very well with the themes of the movie, being space, love, mystery, and others.
My only complaint would be that the music does not fit totally sometimes with what is happening on screen.  When you have a song the is somber and slow, but you have the screen filled with action scenes, it doesn't fit as well.  I wish they could have fit everything together perfectly like in the ""Fantasia"" films, but the music is mostly beats.  It would just be too crazy to have so many jump cuts.
If you enjoy great dance music and anime, or just want to see something that is different from everything else coming out this year, check out this movie.",1071100800,2,1754,4.533333333333333
1921897,5,B0000DBK9X,"Leiji Matsumoto has masterfully crafted an indictment of pop stardom and what fame really means. Using the DAFT PUNK album ""Discovery"" as a brilliant musical backdrop, Leiji takes you on a sci-fi trip of stardom, fall from grace, loss, and the eventual recapturing of the soul.
The ending of this movie will leave you in tears of joy and redemption.
This is a masterwork, and a masterpiece.",1070668800,2,390,4.835820895522388
1921898,4,B0000DBK9X,"Animation done to music is nothing new, but ""Interstella 5555"" does a great job of breathing new life into this tradition.  Essentially an hour-long music video animated to Daft Punk's album ""Discovery"", it tells a good story about kidnapping, theft, rescue, love, and adventure across space. Music being the central theme, the highly stylized anime (brought to life by the legendary Leiji Matsumoto of ""Harlock"", ""Space Cruiser Yamato"", and ""Queen Emeraldas"" fame) and music mix makes this a fun way to spend an hour.  Epic almost on the scale of Chage and Aska's Studio Ghibli animated video ""On Your Mark"", ""Interstella"" is something relatively new, something fresh in both anime and music circles.  Hopefully the success of this DVD will inspire a new generation of stylish and fun music videos.  While the album itself has its high and low points, and the movie lacks any major dialogue, mixed together these minor flaws really don't matter.  I would recommend this video for any anime fan or music video enthusiast.  Enjoy!",1067299200,17,1029,5.059171597633136

However, it did work for my PS4. I am not sure if it will work for Xbox, or any other blu ray players. If you love Daft Punk, get it, but do not be surprised if the movie does not play on all devices. You can research whether or not your players will work on different format discs, or just keep a return label nearby. However, it is still worth it. The movie comes with a booklet with some art and a letter from the band. I feel this is a good item for Daft Punk/EDM fans and nerds who like to collect.",1497830400,,681,3.8714285714285714

1921920,1,B0000DBK9X,"I have loved Daft Punk since I was in Middle School and I've been wanting a physical copy of this film since I first saw it, and I was SOOOO excited when my sis gave me a blu-ray copy for my 20th birthday. But that went away after I tried watching it. It wouldn't even play on our Sony TV, so I tried our VIZIO TV and it managed to play it. However, the audio would skip periodically. Even the film itself would freeze from time to time along with the audio! It's hard to enjoy a film built around music without the music! I finally had to call it quits when the ENTIRETY of the guitar-solo in Digital Love was COMPLETELY skipped.
That's just a crime.

I don't know what's going on, but this disc has yet to prove it's worth.

I decided to by the Blu-ray and not the DVD. In doing this, I checked to make sure my player worked with 1080i (which it does) and was glad to see it plays in all regions. However when I tried to play it, my video signal didn't work. I checked my system and re-checked the specs on here and decided that I would try and get a DVD copy to play on my computer. When I attempted to return the Blu-ray, I eventually received a note from the vendor stating that their discs are indeed Region 2/B only, not like as listed here. Additionally, I discovered that I could only receive a refund if I had left the plastic wrap on, despite the fact that the region was incorrectly advertised and the disc never had been actually played.

I've decided I'm going to a) buy a DVD of this awesome piece of art from someone else and b) sell my Blu-ray as third party. If you decide to buy this, be very careful and thorough with your purchase.

Unfortunately I am not aware of any version with a better transfer, so if you don't own a copy of the film then go with Blu-Ray since the video is slightly better (still no where close to what you expect from Blu Ray).  If you own the DVD, don't bother buying the Blu-Ray version.

Now, all that being said the film itself is great!  And I don't think I can say anything about Daft Punk's Discovery album that hasn't already been said.  The music is fantastic, and this is the ideal way to experience it outside of going to a concert.

1921978,4,B0000DBK9X,"This is some of Matsumoto's finest work.  As a fan of Daft Punk and Matsumoto, I only gave it a 4 because those of us living in NTSC land are left in the dark. I totally overlooked that this is a PAL DVD  when ordering, which only small subset of American DVD or Bluray players will play (not mine). I also have a theory why the 1080i BluRay transfer gets such weak reviews.

The PAL DVD's resolution is 720x576, where American, Japanese and other NTSC DVDs are 720x480. The frame rates are also different, which makes it weirder.  Not one to be deterred, I (legally) ripped and converted the MPEG-2 PAL source to MPEG-4 (more effective, intelligent compression), applying light denoise, de-block and comb filtering along the way. My Mac Pro 8 Core churned on it for nearly 4 hours, but the resulting 1 GB file is absolutely spectacular. Not quite BR quality, but darned good without a hint of banding, jaggies or blockiness visible on my 42 inch Samsung. A PC, ROKU or anything else that can play an MPEG-4 *file* should have no problem with it. The problem arises when one tries to master it back to an NTSC DVD Video disc. It MUST go back to MPEG-2 and one has to throw away some resolution to get it to 480, which also squishes the picture a bit. And the frame-rate conversion leaves a bit of stutter. Also, since MPEG-2 offers less compression that's more ""brute force than MPEG-4,, the file explodes to nearly 2 Gigs.

I think this is also why the BluRay gets such lackluster reviews - Going from PAL to 1080i is going to be weird too. So the crux of the problem is the original source material format (PAL) and how bloody difficult it is to convert to anything modern or American, let alone both.  If you have a player that can deal with PAL DVDs and a TV that can display it, that is the absolute best one can get it without going through the transcoding mess I did, which produced what might be the cleanest version ANYONE in the USA has.",1423180800,14,1947,4.4094707520891365

1921991,5,B0000DBK9X,"Having been a fan of Daft Punk since ""Da Funk"" was a single on the radio, I had heard of Interstella 5555 for quite some time but never got around to watching it, especially since the only way to watch it was to buy it. I'm not one to buy movies before I've seen them (I buy movies only if I really like them), but my love of Daft Punk urged me to do so.
At the time I bought it, it cost only eleven dollars, so ordered away did I.

Now, I have to state that Discovery wasn't one of my favorite albums before I watched Interstella. I bought it on release day, expecting more of the same sound from Homework. When I heard it, I was slightly disappointed and didn't give it another chance until I decided to watch the film. I love Japanese film and animation, so getting to watch this would be a treat either way.

I didn't expect to be blown away like I was.

Unfortunately I didn't hear of Leiji Matsumoto before this, and, looking back on his works and writing this review now, I'm kind of ashamed to admit that. But now I know who is, and I'm thankful to Daft Punk for introducing me to him.

The whole film is the entire album set to a visual spectacle, nothing added, nothing subtracted, with the exception of a number of sound effects that can be totaled on one hand.

What surprised me the most was how well the music was situated to the film. It's like they were made for each other. The plot was great (though nothing groundbreaking), the characters likeable, and the animation fluid and top-notch (with a special nod to Thomas and Guy-Man making cameos).

It's an eclectic ensemble of visual and audial candy, and it made me rethink Discovery. In fact, I rethought it so much that, after listening to it again (and again and again), I have to think that it's their best album. It's not my favorite (Alive 2007 takes that spot) but I think it's their best original work. It's such a pure album from start to finish, but watching this may make you think of scenes from the film when you listen to Discovery. It did for me.",1401840000,,2029,4.284595300261096

I received it, on time, in good condition, and everything was perfect! Perfect until I noticed it was PAL version. I was pretty disappointed at that moment. I decided to try it on my laptop and it worked fine, but my on my PS3, it won't work at all. Really this was my own fault for not reading the description more closely.

The characters are really like-able, and for a movie that has no dialogue at all, that's amazing. There emotions are shown very well by the animators and give each character his or her own personality and bring this movie to life. The music only added to the effect of the animation. Daft Punk really knew what they were doing with there 'Discovery' album, and the music fits in with every scene of the anime.

this blu-ray does not play on ANY blu-ray player i tried.  complete failure.  ruined my romantic get away weekend.  utter failure

it's not just that it's defective, if you google, you'll fine many other people have the same issue.  it appears to be a region block, or some other problem with manufacturing.  a few very cheap or import blu-ray player can handle this.  most can't.  ESPECIALLY PS3 and PS4.  there's no excuse.  blu-ray sold domestically ""just works"".  that's entirely the point.

now, i have to spend time and money to get my money back.  30 mile drive to ups.  spend my own resources on printer paper, tape, TIME.  seriously?  even at cost of gas and minimum wage, i'm losing on this deal, because UPS may charge ME to pickup?  wtf.

(I saw Yellow Submarine on after-midnight TV by accident as a teenager and was amazed, lol)  My college age son turned me onto Daft Punk and this video a few months back, but only saw snippets online until now.  I read the complaints about the blue ray version, so went with the standard DVD.  I watched it for the first time last night end to end and I was VERY impressed.  The clarity and color of the animation has been called into question, and I couldn't disagree more.  This is a high quality production all around.  Maybe some folks are not familiar with Japanese animation, which is very different than what we are used to in the US.  I am not an expert, but I've seen a few other movie length Anime productions (ie. Metropolis) and this obviously is one of the more artistic and creative ones.  The scenes matched up with the music amazingly well and the ability of the animators to convey the story, expression and emotion with no dialog was outstanding.  You always know exactly what is going on throughout the story and there are very poignant scenes depicting joy, fear, panic, relief, grief and triumph, that keep you glued throughout.  Of course not every song is 'great' just like any album out there, but the story line keeps it all flowing which makes the music an even better experience.  I will finish with the fact that this is a movie you can comfortably watch with all ages, and its a wonderful addition to anyone's entertainment collection.

The attention to detail in visual story telling is superb and if you're like me,  you're left wondering whether or not the story was the motivation for the music or the music the motivation for the story; through a bit of research I come to the understanding that the story was written early in the conception of the music.

The only downside is that,  at least for my copy,  the way the Blu-ray was authored causes it to do weird stuff and react slowly when starting up and selecting things to watch.

Besides all of this, the daft punk album discovery is a masterpiece and if you can't dig the anime,  it still validates the whole purchase.",1368316800,,738,4.537878787878788

It is an engaging story, the music is great, the animation adequate (I'm now spoiled by TRON), and I like that there is no narration.

1922076,5,B0000DBK9X,"When I went to the amazon page after watching Interstella on Blu-Ray, I expected to see reviews applauding the audio quality of this amazing movie. This audio transfer is in my top 10, if not top 5, of Blu-Ray movies, it honestly ranks as one of the best I have had the pleasure of listening to. It captures every nuance of Daft Punk, completely immersing you into the album.

For that alone, in comparison to MANY Blu-Ray audio only discs, the price is on par.

But this also throws the original animation, which I have incredibly fond memories of, both on my own and through my children, as this was one of the first movies to bring them to tears (no spoilers, but those who have watched this most likely know what I'm talking about).

That alone awards this 4 stars.

Detracting one star for video quality would be fair, but to see all of these 1 and 2 star reviews... It just makes me sad.

This is a brilliant movie, and although the video transfer is not the best, it certainly isn't worthy of this horrible criticism.

Let's be realistic. Daft Punk set out to create a throw back animated feature to bring a bit of life to their album. They focused on high quality audio (the original soundtrack was DTS, which some believe to be a stronger encode than straight Dolby Digital, I am in this camp) and animation pulled straight from 1987. I agree there are jagged edges throughout the film, and no it's not as crisp as I would like it to be. However the colors are wonderfully accurate, and there are minor banding issues, but for the most part the line detail is great. I may not have first hand experience of what Daft Punk initially created, maybe the production company was lazy in the transfer and somewhere there exists a perfect unblemished video copy. However, I do doubt that to be the case.

I love this movie. I love this album. No, the video quality is not perfect, but I honestly do not believe it was intended to be.  I do not believe it deserves the terrible reviews that everyone here is piling on. The lossless soundtracks alone are enough to warrant an upgrade, and I do see that there is beauty in the video transfer. Maybe the beauty isn't enough for some people, but it is for me.

Please think before you just hastily pass this up. If you are an audiophile, you cannot put a price on the lossless upgrade. If you own the DVD and believe that you do not need or cannot hear a difference, then I suggest you keep the DVD version. The DTS soundtrack was very strong indeed, and I thought it was sonically brilliant, but nothing close to what I have now with the DTS-HD MA soundtrack.",1320624000,12,2607,4.414583333333334
1922077,2,B0000DBK9X,"First of all, nothing wrong with the film itself - it's quite enjoyable for me.

That said, what were they thinking, putting out such low quality video on a bluray?  I was in SHOCK to find the video not fitting my wide-screen.  With 480p looking video quality, I thought I was looking at a DVD.  Are they gonna say that they used up all the space on audio, because this is clearly a waste of bluray space.  My Mazinkaiser SKL DVD looks much better than this and that came out only few months ago!

And bonus feature makes no sense - no descriptive captions attached and very lacking in terms of feature.

There is no way they can justify their above $30 price tag.  I might formally complain to EMI.",1317945600,6,699,4.323076923076923
1922078,2,B0000DBK9X,"I didn't want the reviews on Amazon to be right, but they are: the Blu-Ray release of Daft Punk and Leiji Matsumoto's masterpiece is flawed, to say the very least. Even with my Blu-Ray player's smoothing in place, there are a lot of artifacts and the entire thing looks like it was shot through gauze.  My theory is that Interstella 5555 was originally mastered and edited for 480p and they never bothered to edit the film for higher resolutions or projection, which is something that's affected many anime and live-action TV series.

That being said, if you own the DVD, skip this purchase.  The 'HD' is more like an upscaled DVD rip.  I was looking forward to good bonus features, like interviews with Daft Punk, but they are not here, and the menu for the few bonus features is very confusing.  At least on the PS3 I played the movie on, there was no text to describe what the bonus features were.  Just a bunch of boxes that did different things.

I'd say get this if you don't have the DVD, but try waiting for the price to go down.  I'm a huge fan of Daft Punk and I kind of regret the purchase.",1317686400,45,728,3.9793103448275864
1922080,1,B0000DBK9X,"A few years ago I bought the DVD of this wonderful piece of art. ""Interstella 5555"" indeed is a masterpiece in animation combined with excellent House Music of the brilliant French band ""Daft Punk"".

Sadly, the picture quality of the DVD never came up to the high standard of the the music and sound - the picture was always very blurry, the colours weren't that bright at all...

So I was very excited when I read about the release of the Blu-ray version of this audio-visual experience...

I live in Germany and so I was able to get my hands on the Blu-ray a few weeks earlier than the American customers - and I strongly doubt that the USA will get a different transfer of this film.

When I started the movie, my excitement turned into disbelief and then into anger - I had to press ""stop"" on my RC.
I had to look at the label of the disc in order to be absolutely sure that I hadn't taken a DVD out of the Blu-ray amaray box by mistake.

The picture quality sadly hasn't improved at all - on the contrary: Now you are able to see an ugly judder effect and lots of aliasing added to the known blur and softness issues of the DVD picture.

If you are expecting HD quality, then under no circumstances buy this disgrace of a ""Blu-ray disc"":

Your old DVD copy is even better than this sad excuse of HD material!

It's really a shame of an upgrade...

If this wasn't enough: Please be prepared for some loud ""searching noises"" coming from your BD drive/player at the beginning of each movie chapter.

1922082,4,B0000DBK9X,"I really enjoy Daft Punk music and I like to play it fairly loud on my big stereo system. It's just awesome! My two favorite Daft Punk CD recordings were ""Alive 2007"" and ""Human After All."" I wanted to add ""Discovery"" to the mix. In looking up Discovery, I found I could get it either as the CD or with the animated ""Interstella 5555"" DVD. My thoughts were, well why don't I get the DVD? Then I'd have the music I seek plus a nice animated story on my widescreen TV as a kind of eye candy in the background. Okay, that was a mistake for me, at least initially. My first real interest was in the Daft Punk background music, not in the animation story. It would have been best to buy the Discovery CD if that was my intent.

The music on the Interstella 5555 DVD is subdued into the background of the animated story. It's sort of ear candy while you're watching the animation, just the opposite of what I was expecting. It's good music, there's no question about that but it's subordinated and I wanted it boldly out front. The problem is that it sounds soft and mellow and something like you might hear on easy listening radio. Any stereo effect is not evident. My subwoofer doesn't even seem to come into play at all and the dynamic range seems to be greatly subdued. Alas, It's Daft Punk music but not the way I like to listen to Daft Punk music.

I was very disappointed. But, it was my own fault for not being better informed. Animations are just not a big thing with me. However, make no mistake, this animated DVD is well done and I can understand the enjoyment as recorded by the very high ratings. In fact, after I watched it a few times I began to thoroughly enjoy the animated story. Now I find it delightful. It takes a while to get onto the story. One thing that helped me a lot is that I have a 4-year-old boy and he loves space things and he also really enjoys listening to music. The last couple minutes of the DVD really wrapped it up for me. Very, very charming.

Well, I'm standing corrected and I've revised this review accordingly. Now, if I want to hear Discovery, I'll put the CD on and crank up the volume. If I want to relax and watch Interstella 5555, I'l do just that and have the wonderful Daft Punk Discovery music as a background.

1922102,5,B0000DBK9X,"Daft Punk's Interstella 5555 is a movie that rekindled my interest in the French electronic music duo after 10 years of estrangement.  I first bought the album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Homework/dp/B000000WCV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Homework</a>&nbsp;after hearing ""Around the World"" and ""Da Funk.""  Shortly after my purchase I lost interest in the songs and musical genre... that is until I listened to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Discovery/dp/B000059MEK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Discovery</a>&nbsp;(every track from the album is animated in continuous chapters of a story betrayed in the movie Interstella 5555, with no dialogue and minimal sound effects).  Daft punk teamed up with legendary Leiji Matsumoto to combine their electronic music recordings with his classic Japanese animation.

I've listened to any random selection of songs from the ""Discovery"" album multiple days of every week since first being introduced to it almost a year ago, and it hasn't gotten old due in part to the creative genius of Daft Punk and Matsumoto.  Interstella 5555 gives visual enjoyment to the distinctive sounds of each track.  While I listen to the music I can picture every scene from the movie with a continued appreciation of the hard work and talent that went into creating it.  I eventually had to go out and buy this movie because it has such an emotional draw on my conscious.

Don't buy this movie if you're looking for a something with dialogue.  On the other hand, if you're looking to let go and let a movie's craft, similar to watching ""The Wizard of Oz"" while listening to Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon,"" take over... this is a perfect fit.  Interstella 5555 is definitely not the end of the yellow brick road for Daft Punk.

I am now an avid junkie of their music.  Buy this DVD, the Discovery CD and keep your eyes open for anything Daft Punk!",1270944000,,1959,5.5369127516778525
1922103,5,B0000DBK9X,"I purchased this DVD after YEARS of knowing about it - one of those situations where I kept saying ""I'll get around to it"". I was already a huge fan of the Discovery album, but I still never got around to getting this DVD.

I finally got it, and I was very happy with it!

I knew the Discovery album by heart, and I had already seen the first four tracks/videos before - just a hint of the story line. The full length film has a lot to it - cheesy 70's-inspired animation, comedy, drama, etc all wrapped up in a blanket of great dance music.

If you are a fan of Discovery, you will find yourself singing along to the songs as you watch the movie. It's a fun, entertaining film that you can watch without taking too seriously. The only downside is that I wish there were more special features, but all in all I'm really happy with this video!",1269388800,,842,4.185185185185185
1922104,5,B0000DBK9X,"I liked Daft Punk's Discovery before, now I LOVE it.
Amazing job on this animated movie set to the albums songs",1268697600,,111,4.333333333333333
1922105,5,B0000DBK9X,"First, to be honest, other than in the generic references of the pop-culture landscape, was I vaguely aware of House sensation ""Daft Punk"". Unknowingly exposed to their infectious electronic dance beat rhythms from tracks such as ""One More Time"" or ""Harder Better Faster Stronger"" by the commercial concepts of shrewd marketing firms using their material to push more things we don't need into the public conscious. Thus was I uninitiated to the scope of Daft Punk's material and the source album for this musical, the 2001 album ""Discovery"" (I wonder if the name and release year were an intentional homage to Kubrick's ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" which included the space craft ""Discovery"" famously hijacked by the HAL-9000 computer?).

It is that in being quite a fan of Anime and Japanese Animation and culture, and importantly, a fan of the animated works created or influenced by the inestimable imagination of Leji Matsumoto was my access point to this particular work. Matsumoto is very well known for his unique ""retro"" style character designs, his penchant for Science Fiction, and stories which capture the human condition with a kind of introspective discovery by the characters he creates.

However in this case Daft Punk's House Electronica with an apparently retro style from the source album fuses exceptionally well with Matsumoto's visual design.

What is most impressive is that the movie appears to be a derivative work, that is the album was created first and Daft Punk then approached Matsumoto et.al. to create the movie afterward. The music and movie concepts are fused so well that I would have thought that the music was created for the movie. It was almost as if Matsumoto was able to extract what was in the heads of Daft Punk when they created the album and expressed it visually. Indeed the appropriately corporate sounding pop name for the alien band on earth - the ""CrescenDolls"" I find hard to believe was actually the name of the track on the album as ""Crescendolls"" without that particular usage in mind! Or the track ""Veridis Quo"" and the way they were able to meld the ambiance of the Darkwood character in the movie and the corresponding movie sequence to this uniquely yet appropriately sounding track.

I am also an Audiophile, and I enjoy a wide variety of music, and am able to enjoy electronic music genres such as House. And as mentioned I am an Anime fan so it is easy to enjoy this movie. However unless you just cannot stand Japanese animation or House electronica, then this ""Animated Musical"" is just about appropriate for anyone, especially Daft Punk or Matsumoto fans.

Also if you are fans of Matsumoto you will easily recognize some of the character designs that recur commonly in Matsumoto's works. Such as Stella, the female alien band member, she is the requisite willowy retro-styled blonde. Shep, the pilot of the ""guitar space cruiser"" is reminiscent of the Harlock character. I am also quite sure I saw Captain Avatar of the Argo from Star Blazers in a crowd enjoying the Earth Version of the band as the CrescenDolls. And the blue skinned aliens will remind Star Blazers fans of the Gamilons, though these aliens are notably less hostile!

The DVD menu and interactive design is an art form itself, and its extras are not designed with the easiest usage in mind, but that can be forgiven. It is analogous to a ""fan shrine"" web site, rather than a corporate marketing web site in theme and usage.

The Audio on the DVD is well done. It is mixed for standard 2-ch stereo as well as 5.1 (dolby?) and DTS 5.1. Inserting the DVD prompts you to choose the English or French version, I used English.

I upconverted the DVD to 1080i using my Oppo BDP-83 Blu-Ray player, to my 50"" 1080i Plasma, in DTS mode direct 8-ch analog audio output to a Sunfire TGP-5 and a 5.1 speaker system consistent of Klipsch Icon Wood speakers. The sound quality was impressive, and the video, being native 480p had a high average bit rate of around 7.8 - 8.1 kb/s, and looked great even upconverted (with the lack of a Blu-Ray release this must suffice). The vibrant colors and powerful dance beats were a potent and dazzling combination to behold on a large hi-def monitor and on a high-resolution audio rig.

You could put this movie on at a party and satisfy gregarious dance types as well as the more introverted who may choose to chill on the couch, and keep the party moving just the same. Or one could just crank it up and zone out on the stunning visuals and throbbing music.

I actualy make fan music videos for some of my favorite anime an must say that this is very brilliant seeing somthing similar so professionaly done.

its just great how each scene going with the music that keeps you on the edge of your seat. my favourite song on the LP and my favourite scene in the movie is 'superheros'. i just love the was that they had the orchestra and the hero swooping down to save the aliens.

the only thing i did not like about the DVD is that the special features are hard to understand since they don't label them. so if you wanna watch the features then you HAVE to watch all of them just to know which one is which...

At first it seems like a beautiful way to present a musical album, a nice screensaver as it were. However after watching this a few times and really embracing the story and relating the scenes to the lyrics or melody, Interstella 5555 becomes quite a moving experience. You will travel through a range of emotions with each song, uplifted and happy with ""One More Time"" to quiet and emotional with ""Something About Us"". My favourite track is ""Face To Face"", and it always tugs at my heart-strings towards the end.

Beautiful picture. I rate it alongside ""The Castle of Cagliostro"" as my all time favourite Anime films.",1182556800,,699,4.5476190476190474

1922151,4,B0000DBK9X,"Daft Punk - Interstella 5555 is generally a good anime backed by good electronic music. Both elements are a hard to define. The anime has a late 70s art style, but there is no spoken diolague. So the story telling relies on gesture and imagery. The animation quality starts off good, but 'flash backs' in the later chapters make it feel a little cheep. The music follows a similar pattern. It starts off with daft punk's a-list tracks, but towards the middle of the movie the tracks just are not as strong.

The only other dissapointment would be the extras, which essentially do not exist. There are some sketches, some backgrounds, but that's about it. I wasn't really expecting any more than that, this being a daft punk item, but I would have liked more

Weakness aside, the movie was worth its price. It tells a simple but fun story with great retro characters and stylish music. I've used it on by big screen as wall candy during parties.",1168300800,3,944,4.579881656804734

Romance, adventure, heartbreak, joy, science fiction - it's all in there - in the form of a 68-minute-long Daft Punk music video.  Enjoy it.  You WILL.

I was already a fan of the works of Leiji Matsumoto, so I recognized his hand in it right away. I just recently purchased Interstella 5555, and let me tell you, it tells a story in one of the oldest of ways, by telling it purely with music combined with imagery. The music of Daft Punk is light and fun, and will leave you feeling good after each and every chappter of 5555, whether the chapter was happy or sad.

Whether your a fan of anime, music, or both - I am the latter - you will enjoy this story about an alien pop group known as the Crescendolls. Its a fun watch, and a worthwhile addition to any artistic animation afficienado's collection.

However the whole thing seems be losing dynamics in the latter half. Good concepts are not adequately developed, leaving the story predictable and somewhat clich.

This is a movie that will have you uplifted and exuberant. Set aside your cynism, oh dear and critical friends; this is a must-have. Set to the music of ""Discovery"", Leiji Matsumoto animated a masterpiece. There are no words (besides the ""Discovery"" songs), but the brilliance in animation is emoting purely through image. The album by itself was incredibly dancable, but once the context of the whole story is set out by video, it is irresistable and unforgettable. To the wannabes: this will make you look damn cool.

The music is amazing, of course, and very repetitive. Also, there's no dialogue. You need to be prepared for that, otherwise friends you want to enjoy this will be upset.

Visuals are fun and funky. They even toss in a CG scene or two to emphasize the city stature. You should take a look at the ""Making Of"" extra in the extra features menu.

The story is neat and presented sufficiently in the way everything is sequenced on the screen. There are no real plot holes, and some of the concepts are so bizarre and retro. In one particular scene, I commented, ""This is where it goes all Scooby Doo."" You'll see many retro animation and 70's pop culture references in this movie.

Using techno music from the French duo DAFT PUNK, Leiji Matsumoto builds a tale that is at once charming, rhythmic, kitsch, simplistic, touching, and just beautiful to look at. There are no dialogues other than the limited lyrics of the songs, but the vibrant colors and the magic, classic (read, ""old skool"") look of Matsumoto's designs and characters are more than enough to compensate this. In fact, this is a movie that could not work with dialogues - music is being used as the universal language here! Interstella 5555 is a refreshing spin on music videos, animation, techno house music and old skool sci-fi anime. Very recommended!",1119916800,2,812,4.725352112676056

It's basically a silent anime movie, with the soundtrack (which is the main draw of the movie) being done by French electronica band Daft Punk. The story is basic, an evil man from Earth comes to a distant planet, and kidnaps the blue-skinned musical group so that he can conquer the universe. Odd plot, but it moves quickly and fluidly. The art is beautiful, and the songs are great. The story is very good, as well.

The special features? A little mini-booklet that comes with the DVD. It has some art, and little extras like that. The movie itself has some making off segments and such, and scene selection, but they aren't labelled at all, making things somewhat confusing.

This movie is quite excellent, and if you like anime, electronica music, or Daft Punk, I'd highly recommend looking into it.",1091577600,5,879,4.738562091503268

I have to admit, although, that without the first three or four videos suggesting that there was a story behind the music and the anime I wouldn't have probably even noted this DVD, but I would have also probably bought the CD anyway, that powerfully echoing  this music is. After seeing the DVD I can only say buy it. You like Daft Punk and anime? you must buy it. You like Daft Punk? buy it because with the added animation it feels like a mature and round work. You just happen to like anime? well there are other DVDs that you should probably dig first (starting with AKIRA), but this one has no reason to envy them at all, and maybe you will end up liking Daft Punk music too.

The style of the anime is a real pleasure, reminding me of all the japanese cartoons of my childhood (I didn't know they were called anime at that time), that's a plus.",1091059200,4,1095,4.280193236714976

The songs go with the parts they play in the video. It's so good even without talking. My favorite parts in the DVD are the beginning with One more time because partying at a concert is what you think of when you hear that song. I also like Digital Love because I really do think of him going to get the girl he loves when I hear that song. Then my third favorite part is Something about Us because it is the saddest and best part of the video. Overall the video is really, really, REALLY good.

You can read the other customer reviews that say all I think, so I'll talk about something else on the DVD:
The sound itself.  The DVD has DTS and Dolby Digital.  I've only listened to the Dolby Digital so far, but it's safe to assume DTS wouldn't be totally differant.  I was a slightly dissapointed (only because I was perhaps overly expecting more) that the music itself doesn't take advantage of all five speakers.  Instead, the music is basically the same old two-channel stereo mix from the CD.

1922207,5,B0000DBK9X,"phenominal work - I never saw ""Discovery"" like I do now. I can't stop watching - it's addictive!",1085097600,,96,4.388888888888889
1922208,5,B0000DBK9X,"I bought discovery a few years back, and to be honest I wasn't impressed, so into the back of the collection it went. Then I saw Interstella 5555. Now I can't stop listening to the damned thing, and smiling when certain tracks come on, because Discovery finally has a context that is pleasing.
  Interstella 5555 really is an over the top, sentimental piece of anime, and that's what is so great about it. The fact that the hero of the story flies around in a gigantic space guitar only really bothers you the first time you see it.

  I really liked that there is zero dialogue in this movie, just Discovery as the soundtrack, and lots of non-verbal communication, meaning that there's no need for translation, or bad dub-overs. One can view it in any country.
  The animation is trully top notch, if not heavily 70's themed. It's deffinately a cheesy movie, but that cheese pays off big time in the form of charm, and in the end a kind of sci-fi optimism, which is kind of nice in an age when everyone is surly, sarcastic, and irony ladden.
  This movie will leave you feeling good, so why not buy it?",1082937600,167,1103,4.447761194029851
1922209,5,B0000DBK9X,"What a great movie. I just got it in the mail today and planned to pop it in for just a minute to see what it looked like. I ended up mesmerized and watching it straight through -- after working a 12 hour day today! At first, I was not sure if I'd like this movie enough to buy it because some people reviewing here kind of said the plot might be thin or confusing. I was thinking maybe it would just be eye candy, but I like Daft Punk and I do like animation, so I thought I'd try it.
After watching Interstella 5555 tonight, I'd say there was only one point I got lost in the plot a little bit. The animation is very cool, but more than that, it is a very positive movie with very sympathetic characters. The characters are musicians who are kidnapped by this guy who is just aiming to increase his own power and is exploiting both them and their fans to get it. He writes over their memories,  changes their skin color and their clothes, and takes them to his own faraway planet. They can still play music people like, but you can see in their eyes that they have no spirit left in them when they don't know who they are anymore. I won't spoil the plot too much, but I think that is the greatest strength of this movie is that it is affirming to the human spirit and has a good deal of faith in the human spirit all in all. And in addition to the lofty things, it has great music and fashions!
For me, it builds on the aesthetic of all the rainbows and disco dreams that fascinated me when I was a 10-year-old roller skating kid in the 1980s--bright colors, magical scenes, sparkling shimmers. In contrast to the adult 80s which have the rep for being a decadent self-absorbed time, for me this draws on the experience of kids from the 1980s, which was influenced by that adult scene, but had its own different experience dealing with that culture from the perspective of relative innocence. The movie has a reflective stance that maybe integrates those experiences. It says you are sexiest and most vibrant when you are yourself, know what you stand for, and do what's right. And it charms me how it also hearkens back to what was magic to me in my childhood.",1081296000,2,2163,4.288508557457213
1922210,5,B0000DBK9X,"Now, I may be a bit biased because I've always been a big Daft Punk fan and just recently, an anime fan.  I bought Discovery the day it came out, and thought it was overall a solid album.  I only recently saw Interstella 5555, but I must say, if you own Discovery you should watch Interstella 5555.  It really pulls the whole album together, and the visuals are stunningly synchronized with the music (like every other Daft Punk video).  Despite the lack of dialogue, the plot awakens a wide range of emotions and what better way to accomplish that than through music!  Granted, in the end the plot doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it's still an awesome buy.  Seeing an animated Daft Punk at an awards ceremony is priceless.",1080518400,,730,4.492424242424242
1922211,5,B0000DBK9X,"When I got this DVD in the mail I knew I was going to enjoy it. The animation, the music, everything about this anime rocks. Any fan of Leiji Matsumoto, Daft Punk,(or both for that matter)should definately pick up this DVD.",1079049600,,223,4.463414634146342
1922212,5,B0000DBK9X,"Every moment of film goes perfect with every sound you hear.  The plot is easily known without even the use of context clues.  Perfect in every aspect, I hope they do something like this again.
Hoorah for Daft Punk.",1078531200,,215,4.487179487179487
1922213,5,B0000DBK9X,"I cryed.  Multiple Times.  I got it in the mail yesterday and I have since watched it three times.  This movie is up there with the Sci-fi eighties classic E.T.  Buy it, watch it, cry throughout the whole thing, and then look around you and smile because life is beautiful.",1076457600,,273,4.4
1922214,4,B0000DBK9X,"Anime and Daft Punk fans have been anticipating this DVD since the first four videos hit MTV in 2001. We never expected a merger like this, but after seeing the videos, we were glued to our seats, ready for more. It comes to a huge surprise that Discovery was semi-produced to work as a musical, which actually made me like the CD even more.
So finally comes the complete musical. It's non-vocal the whole way through except for lyrics which lip-synced... humorously. There is, in fact, a story only Leiji Matsumoto could think up, and it works tremendously with the music. The designs are just as innovative as anything Matsumoto, as is the storytelling. The only detractors from the whole experience are the same as what you would get from other musicals anyway, such as plot holes, really fast editing and pace (though details are given enough screen time so the story isn't lost). Also, you can't go about watching this without bumping into cliches. Still, the pros outweigh the cons more than enough to make these passable. It asks a lot of a man to create a musical where instrumental music is constantly the foreground. In this standpoint, Interstella 5555 is excellent.
For those who haven't heard Daft Punk's Discovery before, the album is House with extra doses of funk. It heads more into disco and shameless dance than in their last album, Homework, but it is a steady progression in their sound. Songs have more of a pop appeal this time around, repetitive minimalism is toned down a step to make way for more varied compositions. There are also a couple tracks that undoubtably were meant for cinematic treatment (""Aerodynamic"" being the biggest example), which tend to make the album drift in a different direction. Most of the songs are catchy and memorable and definitely worth sitting through as a soundtrack.
It should be noted that this is one of the last cel-animated works in anime. This is during the digital takeover in anime so the compositing and motion will look a little dated. The colors, effects and tone, though, are picture-perfect. The DVD transfer is gorgeous.
A surprise to me are the extras. No commentary or other traditional DVD extras, but a heavy emphasis on interactivity, something reminiscient of Daft Punk's first DVD, D.A.F.T. The interactive game is cute, though passable. There is another feature, though, that mimics The Matrix DVD where an icon appears and once 'play' is clicked you get a look into the designs and backgrounds from the animation. Also included are biographies, the trailer, Karaoke (smart thinking), and others.
There's been a long wait for this musical, but the end result is something miles beyond expected and truly delivers. I think it goes without saying what kind of audience would appreciate a DVD like this, but it's garaunteed to get more dance music fans from the hardcore anime fans and vice versa. From the standpoint of a fan of both sides, this is a dream come true.",1076112000,7,2947,4.849206349206349
1922215,5,B0000DBK9X,"Ever since I saw Vampire Hunter D and Tenchi Muyo back when they first came to the US, I've been hooked on Anime (and just about anything subtitled since my TV had no speaker back then).
Ever since I heard 'Around The World' I said ""ooh, something different"". And I seeked out all things Daft.
Then Discovery came out.  It was another different move for Daft Punk, but that's exactly what I liked them for in the beginning anyway.  I found small samples of the videos online and enjoyed them greatly.  There was always something in the back of my head telling me that these 'videos' were a little too well produced to be left alone.  There had to be a feature-length story here.
Boy, was that little voice ever right.  I'm sure there are a lot of Anime fans out there that like Daft Punk already.  This is the Peanut-Butter Cup of entertainment.  I'm going to be listening to the voices in my head more often!!!",1075680000,,911,4.419161676646707
1922226,5,B0000DBK9X,"I was amazed that this movie works as well as it does.  I first became acquainted with Daft Punk when I was living in the UK and the first bits of the movie were released as the videos for the first four tracks on the album.
Discovery doesn't sound particularly like a concept album when one listens to it, so I was expecting that they would have to at least insert dialog or rearrange the tracks for the film, but they did not.  The visuals carry the story, but the songs are so well integrated that there is never a clash, nor does the viewer find himself wondering what is going on.  Even the motivation of the villain is clear.
Matsumoto's visuals are beautiful.  I think this film is accessible even to those who are not normally fans of anime or house music.",1075075200,30,764,4.321678321678322
1922227,5,B0000DBK9X,"I've only been a casual fan of Daft Punk, but thought it was worth checking out...and I loved it! It's thoroughly entertaining for any fan of Daft Punk and/or Leiji Matsumoto; and pretty impressive considering it would've had to be released for arts sake and not to make a million bucks.  The story is about an alien rock group kidnapped and brought to Earth by an evil music manager, with the music from Discovery, and no dialogue. I didn't really understand the story until the second time I watched it, though.",1073433600,4,513,4.637362637362638
1922228,5,B0000DBK9X,I've never seen this Music/Anime/Classic. But based on the other reviews it sounds and/or LOOKS FANTASTIC to any Daft Punk fans out there hoo have to get this. I live in America so this a rare film considering it came out in Japan and differnt countries I don't live in. By this DVD its probly the only Daft Punk avilable. Discovery is a graet album my favorite song is (I actully enjoy every one) but my favered one is probly out of all is Aerodynamic it has lots of cool tones and stuff. By this DVD it is The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. Peace Out!!,1073174400,,556,4.205607476635514
1922229,5,B0000DBK9X,"The idea of making a film out of Daft Punk's 'Discovery' album was a strange and difficult thing to do; although the album had a good variety of moods in its tracks as well as speed and themes, the album was not meant to be a soundtrack to anything. Not only was the seemingly impossible task of making an animated musical from 'Discovery' present for Leiji Matsumoto and Daft Punk, but to do one without any dialogue or subtitles.
It struck me as more of an insane effort than a daring one.
Yet, not only did they pull it off, but they made an EXCELLENT motion picture! The 65 minute story-line is astoundingly dense given the absence of dialogue, yet, never confusing for the viewer.
The animation is beautiful, fluid and tells the whole story with ease. All the songs from Discovery are present, played back-to- back and fit with all the scenes moderatly well, especially 'Something about Us'.
If you don't like Daft Punk's Discovery album, then this is one work or art you're unlikely to appreciate, if you do, then I doubt you'll be disappointed with Interstella 5555.",1072915200,12,1073,4.652631578947369

I don't think something like that could kill you. This movie is kind of a love story. It is a very sad story , But it has a happy ending. Daft Punk is a really cool band. They put out a lot of songs , and everyone of them is GREAT!!! If you like cartoons and/or Daft Punk then you should get this DVD.",1072742400,,365,3.6923076923076925
1922231,5,B0000DBK9X,"I missed the US showing of this film at the Rez Fest in San Francisco, but now thanks to DVD I've gotten to enjoy it.
The animation is stunningly smooth, and while obviously computer assisted makes me feel nostalgic for the Matsumoto anime of my youth (Star Blazers, etc)
I think the thing that impressed me was the visual story telling quality.  Details are planted throughout to allow you to understand what is going on, withough being heavy handed and over obvious.
If you like Anime or like Daft Punk, give this disc a spin, you'll enjoy the heck out of it.  If you like both, you'll love the combo.",1071878400,,603,4.472727272727273
1922232,5,B0000DBK9X,"This is an excellent movie. Firstly, I am a huge fan of the Daft Punk album ""Discovery"", so I loved the music. The animation was suprising VERY good. I didn't really expect too much, but the story ended up being very well told (with no acutual dialogue within the film) and beautiful to look at. If you love Daft Punk buy this NOW. If you like anime, you should check it out too, as it's flawless.",1071792000,,397,4.2368421052631575
1922233,5,B0000DBK9X,"I don't think that this DVD is only for Daft Punk fans. It's brilliant from beginning to end, and the director, Leiji Matsumoto, has magnificently choreographed the already fabulous Discovery album, and created a visual masterpiece. The film will appeal to anime fans too, and if, like I, you are an anime and Daft Punk fan; ""Interstella 555"" is the purchase of the year.
This is inspiring work from one of the greatest anime director's in collaboration with THE greatest Disco house group on the planet, and for that matter, the music from ""Discovery"" (aka Interstella 555 without visuals)is pioneering in it's effect on the Dance music scene around the world!
I'm expecting this to be played on screens around bars in London.
Buy the DVD!",1071619200,3,740,4.880952380952381
1922234,3,B0000DBK9X,"And really a fan is what you have to be to really enjoy it. As you may or may not already know, the DVD is an extension on four previously released music videos for tracks on Daft Punk's Discovery album. Now the entire album has been animated and tells a more fleshed out and complete story, which has twists and turns and moreover a respectable ending.
There is no dialogue in the entire presentation except in the opening credits, where Matsumoto talks about his dreams. Sound effects have been added in certain parts, and are unobtrusive to the music.
But it's due to this lack of dialogue that the story itself is very boring. Not to say that the visuals are boring themselves - quite the contrary; the artwork is beautiful - but they rarely succeed in exposing the characters' personalities. A group of extragalactic musicians are one day captured by unknown forces and returned to Earth, where an evil producer turns them into the world's most popular band. They are pursued by the female band member's shy lover, who sets about freeing the band from the producer's clutches and winning the female lead's heart.
The transfer quality is great, however the audio is somewhat subdued. Fortunately you can enjoy the DVD in a variety of audio formats, including 5.1 surround sound.
The extras are confusing to navigate, however. The menu is represented by a series of undetailed buttons with no explanation as to their purpose. But the extras are generally uninformative and unimpressive, especially the character profiles. There's also karaoke, if you're into that.
But given the limited appeal of the music itself, alongside the subpar story, the DVD really has little to offer to non Daft Punk fans and even anime fans in general. But to those who have spent the last few years wondering how it all ends, you owe it to yourself to pick this up.",1071100800,10,1848,4.778125
