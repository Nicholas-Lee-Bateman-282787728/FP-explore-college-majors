7908371,5,B00000FELV,"Since I've been a kid I've watched everything I could get my hands on about the Great Whales. This film includes some of the finest underwater filming of Blue and Humpback Whales (oh yes, and Southern Right Whales) I have ever seen. The informational content is a little thin, but then I didn't really watch this tape to be informed, only amazed. Oh the shark part. I'm trying to remember.
