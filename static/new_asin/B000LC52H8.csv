8161007,5,B000LC52H8,"As an avid film watcher I am often very critical of films. While many are split upon how the director and producer deals with the subject of this film I believe that it shows a very realistic view of it. Thalluri should not be underestimated, but his work would not have survived if it were not for the superb performances of actors such as Teresa Palmer, and others. The film would get a five star rating if it were not for Thalluri's excessive use of the ""F"" word. It was a little bit to overplayed in the script. Knowing highschooler's mouths, would make anyone admit that the usage of the word in the film was excessive and at times played down on the films excellence. However, the superb acting, aura, and hard work that Thalluri has put into this film deserve credit because it scrapes upon many issues that have never been dealt with in cinema. Finally, Thalluri's leaves the film with a very objective view point that lets the film critic or viewer experience firsthand what each teen is going through. Overall, the film was powerful, and wish Thalluri well in his endeavors with his project World War III and its funding.",1264464000,2,1131,4.5763546798029555
8161008,5,B000LC52H8,"I rented this movie, having no idea what it was about and began the movie only half watching it as I did other things. By the end of the movie I was in tears and online ordering myself a copy.

I hadn't seen Elephant by Gus Van Sant so I didn't feel like it was a rip off of that movie while watching it. I did rent Elephant afterwards and thought that movie was a complete waste of my time.

2:37 deals with many teen issues and I think everyone watching will either relate personally to one of the characters or know someone they can relate to one of the characters.

It's not fast paced, but this movie is worth taking the time to sit and listen to what the characters have to say.

Great writing and great acting!",1215388800,10,717,4.136690647482014
8161009,4,B000LC52H8,"Some of the reviews align this with Elephant, yes, there are some similarities, like:  it takes place in a high school, it's very segmented in the story telling - but that's it.  It's really a very different product than Elephant.  It's loaded with rebellion, hatred, bigotry, obsession, and a few others that would spoil it for you.  Well worth watching and owning - I'll be passing my copy around to my friends. . .",1203811200,5,417,4.594594594594595
8161010,2,B000LC52H8,"This film deals with some bold subjects, but it is extremely similar to Gus Van Sant's film, ""Elephant"".  The style and setting copies Van Sant's film so closely that it really drew me out of the film.  The problems of the various students were also rather meledramatic.  Not nearly as good a film as Elephant.",1201132800,4,310,4.6
