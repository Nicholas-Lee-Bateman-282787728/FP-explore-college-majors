6259903,5,B00IDRQ3PI,It is a very humorous show! I like the couple that still sees romance in one another's eyes everyday . There is modesty being displayed in the show as well. Buddy and Sally still know how to crack a person up with their ways of  show business. It is a thumps up to me as far as clean entertainment!,1193961600,3,298,4.0508474576271185

6259906,5,B00IDRQ3PI,"The beauty of the age in which we live is that we're able to buy these classic old TV DVDs and simply have ""Our Own Network.""  Shows such as the Dick Van Dyke Show, the Andy Griffith Show, the Mary Tyler Moore Show, etc. constitute our family's ""primetime"" viewing.  When I watch these old Van Dyke shows and laugh, I can't help but wonder if they're still truly funny, or if I'm simply programmed through years of watching them to laugh at the right moments.  But in watching with my sons, who are seeing them for the first time, and hearing them laugh and roll on the floor, I realize the humor within these shows is timeless.  Van Dyke is, plain and simple, one of the best TV comedians we've ever had.  His physical humor, as well as his timing, is sheer perfection.
Season Three of the Van Dyke show had some classics, including the season opener, That's My Boy??  That particular show has a punchline that still, to this day, cannot be seen coming by the first-time viewer.  The interviews with cast members are fun to listen to, but especially enjoyable is watching certain episodes with a talk-over track supplied by show creator, Carl Reiner, and Dick Van Dyke.  It actually feels like you're sitting with the two of them in your living room, chatting about the show itself.  If you're a first-time viewer to these shows, you have hours of enjoyment ahead of you.  If you're a repeat viewer to these shows, you have, well, hours of enjoyment ahead of you.",1085529600,24,1464,4.532319391634981
6259907,5,B00IDRQ3PI,I just thought all of you would like to know that samsclub.com is selling seasons one through three for only $39.99 each!,1081728000,22,121,4.545454545454546
6259908,5,B00IDRQ3PI,"The good folks at Image Entertainment have done it again! This third-season, multi-disc boxed set of CBS-TV's ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" (1961-1966) replicates the outstanding quality and tender-loving-care of its two predecessors.

This Season 3 package consists of five digital discs, each receiving its own ""ThinPak"" case, with appropriate (and very nice-looking!) high-resolution artwork and accompanying episode information. The outer slipcase features the ""old-time TV"" look, complete with a ""lenticular"" (3-D style) image adorning the mock ""TV screen"". The snappy-looking 3-D image offers up a ""motion"" picture of Rob Petrie (Dick Van Dyke) falling out of a jury box (from the episode ""One Angry Man"", which actually was not a Season 3 episode, but rather a program from the first season of the show).

By the way, it's also worth mentioning here that these season-three discs are all ""Region Free"" (or ""Region Zero"") encoded. This is a change from the two earlier boxed sets of this series, which were only encoded for ""Region 1"" playback.

This third-season set gives us 32 top-notch episodes with Rob and Laura Petrie and associated friends and neighbors (even though the packaging says only 31), including the hysterical ""That's My Boy??"", in which Rob is convinced he's brought the wrong baby home from the hospital. Also in Season 3: ""October Eve"", ""Laura's Little Lie"", ""Big Max Calvada"", and another of my all-time faves, ""I'd Rather Be Bald Than Have No Head At All"".
All of these episodes are uncut and unedited. The FULL shows, as filmed in 1963-1964, are presented here.
Picture quality is excellent throughout this set. These black-and-white shows have never looked so good! Good resolution, detail, and contrast. The original Mono sound is used, and it suffices just fine. The audio comes to us via robust Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono soundtracks.

A ""Play All Episodes"" option is also available (from the Main Menu). This feature makes it nice for those non-stop DVD-on-DVD marathons that every self-respecting fan of ""Great TV"" everywhere should subject themselves to at least once every few weeks! :)
BONUS FEATURES ....... Like the first two boxed seasons, this 3rd Dick Van Dyke Show set is jammed-packed with bonus material. Here's a rundown:
>> There are 2 audio commentary tracks, featuring Dick Van Dyke and show creator Carl Reiner (for ""That's My Boy??"" and ""October Eve"").
>> Two clips from the 1964 Emmy Awards (length = 2:30).
>> Assorted Cast & Crew Interviews.
>> Photo Galleries for many episodes.
>> A complete episode of ""The Danny Thomas Show"" (originally aired on October 21, 1963), in which Morey Amsterdam appears as his Dick Van Dyke Show character, Buddy Sorrell! This Danny Thomas program bears a strong resemblance, story-wise, to the 2nd-season Van Dyke Show episode, ""Ray Murdock's X-Ray"". Run time of this bonus program is 25:20, and the picture quality is quite good.
>> ""Rehearsal Footage"" (2:28) --- This extra contains a clip from an Arthur Godfrey-hosted TV documentary from May of 1966, ""A Day In The Life Of Sheldon Leonard"". We see some behind-the-scenes rehearsal footage for the season-five Van Dyke episode, ""Talk To The Snail"". Interesting stuff.
>> An excerpt (3:14) from Mr. Van Dyke's 1975 variety program, ""Van Dyke & Company"", in which Dick's former co-star, Mary Tyler Moore, makes an appearance. It's not a song-and-dance clip; it's a scripted comedy spot featuring Dick and Mary chatting. Not exactly side-splittingly funny; but it's still fun to watch these two performers get together again, nine years after the Van Dyke Show ended.
>> Easter Eggs --- There are 5 hidden ""Eggs"" (one on each of the five discs). Each is a TV ad (circa 1990s) for ""Nick At Nite"", featuring ""Chairman"" Dick Van Dyke. Be sure not to miss the one on Disc #5, in which Carl Reiner pops up (alongside Dick). That one is very funny!
These ""Easter Eggs"" can be accessed by pressing your remote's ""Left Arrow"" key while the ""Opening Titles"" chapter is highlighted. In two instances, however, you can get to the same hidden ""Egg"" by ""left arrowing"" from any of the other chapter choices as well. If an ""Egg"" is present, a ""glow"" will surround the cranium of Mr. Dick Van Dyke's artist rendering in the corner. Press ""Enter"" or ""Play"" now, and you'll see the ""Nick @ Nite"" promo spot.
>> Plus: There's also a four-page mini-booklet, featuring some third-season facts and trivia, plus an informative bio on Rose Marie.
NOTE: The packaging indicates that some ""Original Commercials"" are contained in this set.  This is an error.  There are none here.
Anyone that currently owns the other sets of The Dick Van Dyke Show from Image will, without question, want to snap up this third installment of this timeless TV classic. Image Entertainment, once again, proves that when it comes to providing consumers with superlative TV product on Digital Disc, they are a class act. With great video transfers, plentiful bonus features, complete uncut episodes, and smart-and-classy packaging -- this boxed set is another no-brainer for collectors.",1079308800,61,5071,5.059808612440191

I own all 3 seasons released so far and they are so good that I have pre-ordered Season 4.  This series includes so many classic episodes that convey intelligent comedy without the raunchiness of today's sitcoms, and many of them are in season 3:  the episode where Rob thinks that he and Laura brought the wrong baby home from the hospital, the one where Laura's old beau is now a priest, the one where Laura and Rob have to remarry because she lied about her age on her marriage license, and many more...Classic TV at it's best.

6259932,5,B00IDRQ3PI,"In today's 21st century world, the standardized TELEVISION SITCOM has become a jungle of profane language, extreme antics, and bad behaviors that would have been labeled NOT FOR FAMILY VIEWING as recent as the 1970s or 80s. That's why the early sitcom classics such as THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW are a REFRESHING BREEZE of pure oxygen for those of us who still hold to a higher standard of acceptable language or behavior. Social media and the internet have contributed to the lowering of standards for what is acceptable on television anymore, including ""family shows"" (kids have already seen too much, too soon, and things that never should have been seen).

There are still many in America who, like me, long for the good ol' days, when life was simpler and more conservative, when families still sat around the supper table and ate dinner together. Moreover, the very definition of ""family"" has forever changed now, hence, the time of innocence is but a memory. If you're longing to go back to a time when life was much more innocent, when the lines of right and wrong were clear and not blurred by political correctness and tolerance, then THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW will bring you the RELIEF you're longing for, in the world of family entertainment.

The Dick Van Dyke Show is GOOD MEDICINE for those suffering from headaches, nausea, stress, blues, and tightness in the chest. The result of viewing an episode from THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW will be a barrel full of laughter and stress-release that will lengthen your life span, along with boosting the endorphins in the brain, causing GREAT HAPPINESS AND JOY to the viewer. The Dick Van Dyke Show has awesome medicinal value to your overall health and wellness! Act now! Buy any of the seasons, and start living happier lives!",1422576000,,1773,4.771986970684039

6259936,5,B00IDRQ3PI,"In my opinion, The Dick Van Dyke Show is the all-time best show every!!! Great comedy! Great acting! And great rapport between the actors! Though there are several episodes that especially shine as my favorites, all of the episodes of all 5 seasons are fantastic!

I love all the extras and interviews that are included in this package: it is a wonderful treat and a great pleasure to listen to the interviews of the actors and actresses reminiscing and telling stories of their time together. This company also did a fantastic job restoring these great classics: the picture and sound are wonderfully clear.

The show makes me laugh from the moment they start until they are over.  They take me back to my childhood but also are very relevant to day in that they are the classic relationship/conversational humor.  Carl Reiner is a genius as Alan Brady.  But,  think of Carl Reiner, creating, developing and producing as well as writing this sitcom.  Fabulous.  Season 3 is a great choice in that the cast his really warmed up and comfortable with their roles.  Get it - you will watch it more than you think.

6259995,5,B00IDRQ3PI,"It is difficult to rate an entire season of separate episodes but I will highlight the most memorable.  If you only watch a couple DVD Shows ever, watch ""That's my Boy?""  I think any first time parent who didn't actually witness the birth has a tiny bit of this concern.  I had a c-section and there was a sheet between me and the baby at birth.  I had a lot of meds from surgery so I couldn't swear that my daughter is my baby and I did ask family who was there ""are you sure...?"" And with how the birth was handled back then it is even more understandable.  The lines are hysterical -I don't want to give away any spoilers so I will stop but it is hysterical,classy and before its time.

The other stand outs are Big Max Calneva, Rob's uncle's visit.  I didn't really like ""Turtles and Tubrodeaurs"".  The premise was forced and unrealistic and too much was forced into one show.  I also thought ""Laura's Big Lie"" was a little drawn out and unrealistic.  Overall though it was a great season and I love that it is free on Amazon Prime.

I am only 45, not exactly ancient but this is t.v. I love.  No gratuitous sex, violence, really being mean just to get a laugh.  This is comedic genius!",1379808000,,1190,4.258928571428571

The episodes include the classic Christmas show, Alan Brady Presents which is my favorite episode.  The show puts the characters in several episodes where they can show off not just their comedic talents but their singing and dancing talents too.  Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore with one other actress, Sylvia Lewis sing the Doodlin' Song and perform a dance number.  While the situations are silly and not about much of anything, they provide an opportunity for jokes and fun.  Dick Van Dyke had one of the greatest shows ever made and a very good example of situation comedy.",1348099200,,725,4.538461538461538

6260026,5,B00IDRQ3PI,"After re-watching a dozen episodes from The Dick Van Dyke Show, I changed my mind and decided that I should, after all, write an Amazon review for the series. Not because I think too many people will see my review, which will undoubtedly be hidden beneath multiple pages of previously-posted reviews. Not because I think Amazon readers need any more recommendations to get this set after reading the scores of such recommendations already present. Not even because it would be fun to reminisce as I wrote the review about everything I liked about the show over the years. No, I decided to write this review because, after re-watching these classic episodes again, I realized afresh that The Dick Van Dyke Show is one of the best, perhaps THE best, comedy series I've ever seen, and if even a single person watches this show for the first time because of this review, the effort would be entirely justified.

There are lots of funny TV shows, but I can't think of any that have affected me like The Dick Van Dyke Show has. My childhood is filled with the memories of watching the show with my father as I grew up. We sat there together, laughing out loud, over and over again, day after day, and felt like we were special guests to be asked into Rob and Laura Petrie's family each week. But were these childhood memories just a figment of my passing childhood, laughs that would disappear with time and a new social context? Not one bit. As I watch these shows in sparkling, crystal-clear DVD format (the ""DVD"" being no relation to ""Dick Van Dyke""!), I find myself laughing - and enjoying - these episodes as if I never saw them before. And even when I have the jokes and the sequences memorized - and for many of them, I do - I can find no other reaction other than to laugh out loud as I did when I was kid. This is a downright, flat-out funny, witty, enjoyable, and entertaining program.

Can comedy be funny without resort to off-color language? Can shtick and physical humour actually be supremely hilarious? Can an element of sophistication be woven into comedy so that the audience can laugh at itself without being insulted? Can timeless themes be woven into stories that actually entertain? One needs watch only a handful of Dick Van Dyke Show episodes easily to quickly affirm each of these questions. And perhaps more impressively, its easily apparent that the cast and crew pull this off silky ease, belaying the true work that was put into the show. There's no question about it: the writing, the plot lines, the acting, and the personal charm of those involved in The Dick Van Show set a standard apart from others, a standard that sees no wear from the ravages of time. It doesn't matter that we are watching black-and-white in a clearly post-1950's suburban home and work setting: we see color and modernity even as we look right through these unimportant backdrops. The themes and talent that pours out of nearly every episode is unaffected by time, setting, and costume.

I once heard Carl Reiner say that Dick Van Dyke was the most talented entertainer he had ever known. It's hard to disagree with him once we've seen the show. Van Dyke is like Rowan Atkinson, but in spades, and with an inner charm that endears the watcher. He can sing, he can dance, he can tell jokes with precision timing, he can use understatement as a weapon, and he can make us totally sympathetic to his plights without appearing whiny. Rob Petrie, but more importantly, Dick Van Dyke, strikes us as an intensely decent person imbued with a joy of life that pervades everything he does. Actually, we are CONVINCED he is an intensely decent person, and we are just there for the ride as we watch him move through life with all its comic ups and downs. He could have never done it without Morey Amsterdam, Rose Marie, and Mary Tyler Moore (not to mention all the others who worked on the show before the camera), but Van Dyke stands out as that supremely gifted individual, a talent amongst a group of talents, Holland's gift to America. That so many gifted individuals could work together without stepping on each other's toes is a miracle in itself. It's an assemblage of people rarely seen, and I fear, not to be seen again for a long time.

Season One gets off to a rocky start. In retrospect, we can see the show is trying to figure out itself, trying to understand how all the pieces work together, trying to determine how stories are to be assembled for best impact. The show was slated for cancellation twice that year, and only after Sheldon Leonard stepped in to rescue it - and a change of time slot for Season Two right after the successful Beverly Hillbillies - did the show take off.

But in Season Two, the show takes off like no rocket you've ever seen before. Season One has some strong episodes and great plot ideas, but it's Season Two that sees the cast working in a seamless, slick, and sophisticated manner that turns the show into a timeless classic. It's almost as if everyone involved realized they were given a second chance, and with that, the gloves came off, the worries were put aside, and everyone just got ""into the groove."" The show knocked out one outstanding episode after another, and by the time Season Five occurred, everyone knew that this might likely be the highlight of their careers. The show was ended at the height of it's popularity because of Reiner's insistence - he said he did not want to show to die slowly, but go out while at the top of form - and we can only wonder what a ""Season Six"" might have held for us. But it's no matter. These are comedic masterpieces at the top of form, a goal for others to try and match, and a standard by which all others are measured.

If you've never seen The Dick Van Dyke Show and wonder what it is about, I'll tell you. It's about a somewhat charmed life of a regular group of people who are talented, happy, and good natured and who face the normal problems, irritation, and strange events that are a part of nearly everyone's life. That's all you need to know. Start with Season Two and work forward from there. When you are done, go back to Season One and see how they figured it all out in those early months. But by then, you'll already be won over by the many wonderful episodes, and will doubtless be re-watching these over and over again. Millions of people of have done so over the years. To watch these episodes is to easily understand why.",1326153600,,6431,4.539655172413793

6260029,5,B00IDRQ3PI,"The reason, that there was no audience, (as in Season 1's ""The Bad Ol' Days""), is a different fact. The fact of both shows are not the same. The differences were;
on Season One's ""The Bad Ol' Days"", character ""Rob Petrie"" was dreaming that ""Laura Petrie"" (Mary Tyler Moore) was doing the housework, as if in the 1920's or 1930's decades, if not both, but extremely fast that what was filmed, was sped up to make it appear as if Laura Petrie was extremely speedy, doing her housework chores!
Why there was no audience, this time, is that Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore were still saddened of the assassination, of USA's 35th President, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, back on Friday, November 22nd, 1963, in Dallas, Texas.

6260030,2,B00IDRQ3PI,"This episode doesn't hold up well under the philter of time. A character in the show has a horrible secret that is tossed about a bit cavalierly, once it is revealed. It's unacceptable not only today, but back then as well, I imagine. The studio audience doesn't react very well either.

It's a relatively average episode of the show up to that point, but that part just submarined it for me. I've seen the whole run dozens of time in syndication, but I don't remember ever having seen this episode before. Maybe this is why. I've never seen another episode of Dick Van Dyke that I just plain didn't like, but I anti-recommend this one.",1306281600,,636,4.530434782608696

HOWEVER...why, oh why, is there no list of the bonus features? There's no list included, nothing on or in the individual sleeves...nothing. The 12-page booklet has some fun trivia, but why couldn't they add another few pages to catalog the bonus material? Do I really have to browse the menus of each individual disk?

I tried looking up each season here on Amazon as someone suggested, but that doesn't work. Example...the standalone second season set has rehearsals listed as a bonus, but after looking at every second season disk in this complete set, I find nothing of the sort.

That's the only glaring fault I have with this set. I would have given it 5 stars otherwise. It's beautifully laid out, the prints are pristine and it's packaged nicely, worthy of the show contained herein.",1302480000,,1061,4.818681318681318

It is done in quality packaging (although I wish the main box were more substantial).  There are no bad spots or edits as in some boxed DVD TV shows.  I have not watched all the ""extras"" on each individual show but the ones I have watched have been informative as well as entertaining.  In season three you can tell the actors are much more at ease and seem to fall naturally into their conversations with one another and nothing is forced as in some of season one's shows.

6260034,3,B00IDRQ3PI,"After thoroughly enjoying the first season of The Dick Van Dyke Show, I was disappointed to find that the 3rd season was not nearly as family-friendly.  I found myself feeling uncomfortable watching some of the episodes and scenes with my children.  I would not purchase this season again, even though there is still alot of great humor in it.  It isn't worth it to have to constantly be editing out the inappropriate stuff.",1286582400,,424,4.780821917808219

6260037,3,B00IDRQ3PI,"Well, we loved the first 2 seasons, but we were surprised to find ourselves disappointed by the 3rd season of the Dick Van Dyke Show.  They repeat the Laura jealous of Rob/Rob jealous of Laura theme way too often.  There were so many other themes and angles they could have pursued and often did in earlier shows.  Rob and Laura's son is hardly ever included in an episode.  And since we think of this as a family show we were surprised at how many darker themes were addressed (wife-stealing, husband-stealing, divorce, etc).  The episode where Laura meets an old flame, now a priest, had a very nice and surprising ending, when she realized that the ""love poetry"" he had sent her many years before had not been written with her in mind, but rather God.  Still, before we could get to that touching ending we had to endure more of the ho-hum Rob jealous of Laura theme.  I still think we'll try the 4th season, but we regret the missed opportunities of the 3rd.",1226361600,3,962,4.494252873563219
6260038,5,B00IDRQ3PI,"I've loved the Dick Van Dyke Show for as long as I can remember.  Back when I was a child it was a staple for us at home.  Considering the show began the year I was born it means that I primarily remember the reruns but that doesn't matter.  This TV show remains as funny now as it was then.  It just goes to show creative genius lives on no matter what.

As far as the dvds in this collection, they're brilliantly done, clean and clear.  I watched all 30+ episodes of season one over a weekend and will begin season 2 next weekend.  I purchased all five seasons and so far it is turning out to be a wonderful experience.  Don't miss out, these are terrific!",1205107200,,658,4.125984251968504

I have no idea why they decided to shorten the episodes by cutting sections out but they did. I would buy an older version because those have the full episodes.",1522972800,,328,4.576271186440678

8641360,1,B00IDRQ3PI,"I'm sure the remastering would have been nice, but I had two issues with this product.
1)  I didn't care for the packaging, all discs in one case.  Although it does take less space, I prefer each disc in its own case like the other seasons I have purchased.
2) And the main reason I returned them was that when you put the disc in, the screen with the list of episodes to choose from plays the theme song over and over and over until you choose an episode.  Just couldn't handle that.  Returned it and bought the other version, with the individually packaged discs and no looped theme song.",1503619200,,590,4.336363636363636
