I was quite pleased to see that Shawn has just as much skill teaching line dancing as he does couples dances.  We started with the basics and worked our way up to the advanced DVDs and managed to learn all the line dances in less then a month.  We did count a few sessions as workouts because they were paced quickly enough to warrant wearing our gym clothes.  Great product for anyone looking to really learn how to line dance, that is become a master of line dancing..!",1398902400,,574,4.238532110091743
8425453,1,B004DK5ZSK,"The product was clearly used - but was told that it was new!  Package was not sealed and the pamphlet was not included.  The dvds themselves are fine and I would recommend Shawn Trautman's instruction, but am extremely disappointed that I got a used product, when I paid for, and was told, that it was new.",1395878400,,306,4.446428571428571

8425455,3,B004DK5ZSK,"The video has clear instructions on dance steps but it does not spend enough time on one dance before going on to the next dance with new steps. There should be at least one full dance routine with the steps learned before bouncing into another dance. Practice makes perfect and there was no time to practice unless you stopped the video and put on your own line dancing music or constantly backed it up. We were somewhat disappointed. A lot of money spent and some of the advanced dance DVD's will never be used. I'm sorry I didn't look into this further before purchasing. My friend, who teaches line dancing, said some of the steps and turns were too complicated for beginners. I would not recommend unless you are already into line dancing and want to learn new and more advanced steps.",1315094400,2,790,4.570422535211268
8425456,5,B004DK5ZSK,"I always wanted to learn line dancing but i wanted to chose a product that would be easy to learn and detailed. I found Shawn Trautmans line dance 6-pack i love it i wanted something that was fun and also a product that would get me motivated in my journey to lose weight i have lost 18lbs so far and having fun doing it thanks shawn, debbie brooks",1295827200,4,348,4.132352941176471
