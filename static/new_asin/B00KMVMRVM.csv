6434682,1,B00KMVMRVM,"Purchased on December 30, 2014 and just now getting around to viewing.  The disc won't play and the return period has expired.  Was not cheap and this falls short of my expectations.  Was really looking forward to seeing the movie.  Suggest anyone else who purchases to check it out upon delivery so you don't waste your $50.00",1434499200,3,327,4.684210526315789

6434684,4,B00KMVMRVM,"One of my favorite movies which took a long, long time getting to DVD and VCR. It i s right up there with The High and The Mighty and Island in the Sky!  Stick it out to the very end and it is a magnificent tale of friendship and bravery ... and of that mysterious breed known as aviators.  My only objection is the missing sound of the bell in the cockpit.  If that is all that is wrong with it, however, it is really no big deal.",1431648000,2,431,3.875

6434686,4,B00KMVMRVM,Good movie for the 60's.  I saw it a long time ago but my wife (who had not seen it before) liked it.  Plot and story tend to stay with you after viewing.,1424131200,,154,3.6363636363636362

6434688,3,B00KMVMRVM,the  doc on Nancy Kwan in the DVD was quite interesting,1419379200,,55,4.0
6434689,5,B00KMVMRVM,GREAT MOVIE But it will not play on any of my three computers. It will play perfectly on a MAC Mini but just displays a black screen on the others. Someone in mastering needs to lose their job on this one. All for the stupid copy protection crap. Who would make an illegal copy of this anyway? It boggles the mind.,1418342400,,314,4.163934426229508

8660192,5,B00KMVMRVM,This is a very good movie. I saw this when I was very young and knew then that it was good. Rod Taylor and Glenn Ford are two of my favorite actors.  Good movie for its age.,1515456000,,173,3.675675675675676
