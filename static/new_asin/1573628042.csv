193359,1,1573628042,"So many things are wrong with this movie--where to begin? Well, first of all, and most importantly, it's a movie about sex, with ""sex"" in the title, and you don't SEE ANY SEX IN THE ENTIRE FILM!!!... That was a mistake. Second, this guy who's the main character is doing the worst Woody Allen imitation I have ever seen. Worse than Jason Alexander during the first season of Sienfeld! Thirdly, someone thought it would be cool to put old, late 60's Jamaican rocksteady in this movie. No movies have rocksteady in them. I love rocksteady. Why did they have to put it in this movie???!!!... WHY????!!!...
What a waste of great tunes.

Peace.",993686400,2,643,4.649122807017544
193360,5,1573628042,"This is a great sex farce. Short sweet and funny.  Mariel Hemingway is the best she's been since Manhatten. If you like Albert Brooks, Woody Allen or Gene Wilder you'll like Mike Binder a lot. I can't wait to see what he does next. He has all of the talent to be a great comic. Stephan Baldwin has a great role and Christopher Lawford is a great supporting actor. THis isn't deep or meaningul or super clever, yet for some reason, I've seen it ten times now, and this is one of my favortie comedies. This will be looked on, I think as the first of Mike Binder movies. I love it.",981244800,,578,4.160714285714286
193361,4,1573628042,"First of all, contrary to what several other reviewers here have stated or implied, Stephen Baldwin is NOT the husband in this movie. Hello! He plays a friend of the husband. Mariel Hemingway is wonderful as the initially reluctant cohort in her husband's scheme to turn her out. The sex is primarily implied, but the laughs are non-stop.",971913600,2,338,4.844827586206897
193362,4,1573628042,"This low budget sex farce surprised me and turned out to be a madcap and funny comedy.  Laura (Mariel Hemingway) and Marty (Mike Binder) are a regular couple with an ordinary sex life.  But Marty is obsessed with a fantasy where he and Laura have a threesome with another woman.  He goads  her semiseriously and when she finally shows some interest, he convinces  her to invite over a girl from work who has been coming on to her.
But  Marty soon learns that you have to be careful what you wish for.  After an  initial reluctance, Laura gets into it and finds she likes it.  We're  talking SERIOUS liking here.  Marty is initially ecstatic that his fantasy  has been fulfilled, but now that he has opened Pandora's Box (so to speak),  he is not prepared for the Sex Monster that emerges.  Laura becomes a sex  crazed Lesbian nymphomaniac and proceeds to seduce all their female  friends.  This leads to numerous awkward situations, some zany, some silly  and some just downright hilarious.
This film is just rollicking good fun.  The sex is mostly implied, so if you were hoping to see Mariel Hemingway  or anyone else naked, you are pretty much out of luck.  There is a lot of  moaning and bed shaking but nothing really provocative other than a couple  of girl kissing scenes.  But explicit sex isn't what this movie is about.  It's about the comedy, and the comedy works, so it is just as well.
This  is really the Mike Binder show.  He wrote, directed and starred in the  film.  He didn't really excel in any of these roles, but somehow the whole  exceeded the sum of the parts.  He gave a generally droll performance which  was occasionally terrible but more often comical.  He was at his best when  he was being tormented by Laura's obsession as he tried desperately to get  the sex genie back in the bottle.
Mariel Hemingway was terrific in this  film and made it truly funny.  This is her second role with a bisexual  theme having appeared in the heavy handed `Personal Best' where she was an  athlete who alternated between sleeping with her male coach and a female  teammate.  Her performance in this part was far better and she turns out to  be a much better comedian than dramatic actress.  She has a great ability  to make humorous use of her 6 foot frame and made the most of the many  sight gags in the script.
I rated this movie a 7/10.  It doesn't redefine  the genre, but it is a wacky sex farce that has more than its share of  funny moments.  If you are offended by profanity, sexual situations and  lesbianism, you definitely want to skip it.  But if you like a light  hearted and offbeat roll in the hay flick, you'll probably enjoy it.",956361600,32,2659,4.490526315789474
193363,3,1573628042,A husband's fantasy comes true and he gets more than he bargained for. A pretty good film but a bit tiresome by the end. Sexy without nudity. Humorous.,955843200,,151,4.428571428571429
193364,3,1573628042,"If you're looking for a lot of naked shots of women and hard-core sex scenes, this is not your movie (the closest you'll get is one female topless shot in the pool, and its not of Mariel Hemingway, so forget that). Hemingway and Mike Binder both do a marvelous acting job as couples married too long. Binder, as the husband, portrays what every man thinks his fantasy is, bringing another woman into bed and getting his wife to actually like it. But then she likes it more and more, and soon feels neglected. Hemingway over-dramatizes a bit by becoming more sex-crazed and obsessed for women to the point where she ruins an important business BBQ gathering at their home, which I though was REALLY off line...no matter how attracted I was to anyone, I would at least wait until business concluded before coming on to someone...that I thought was kind of unrealistic. But the movie is all-in-all entertaining nonetheless, especially for anyone who has actually tried the threesome experience. Some of the problems that could arise from such a tryst are actually represented very well. Worth a rent, in my opinion....good to show to someone who is not hung up on the threesome idea.",949881600,15,1180,4.78921568627451
193365,3,1573628042,"The premise of the movie is what happens when a wife finally gives in and allows another woman into the bedroom with her and her husband.  My husband and I saw this about a year ago and we still laugh about it.  I'm married  to one of those guys who occasionally (and jokingly) submits a request to  share our bedroom with an extra woman.  Ladies, if your husband or  boyfriend is constantly nagging you for this same ridiculous request  (either seriously or jokingly), make him watch this movie with you.  If he  doesn't change his mind, he'll have something to think about before he asks  again.
The acting is pretty good, but we're not talking Oscar quality  here.  It was a cute film.  Not too raunchy.  No great belly laughs, but  continuous giggles throughout the film.
The best component of the movie  was the soundtrack.  It's fabulous.  If anyone knows how I can get my hands  on the CD, let me know.
If for no other reason, if you're looking for a  slightly sexy, fun movie to watch as a couple, or even with your  girlfriends, I highly recommend this film.  It was a lot of fun.",949536000,7,1089,4.4213197969543145

""Men be careful what you wish for""

I remember when I was a lot younger and better looking. A friend of mine mentions what an experience a threesome would be like and asked me if I would like to have one with my girlfriend. Boy was he surprised at my response. The first thing I asked him was what happens if what you spiced up your relationship with does exactly what this movie did. Okay minus the monster.

Were no dummies and know there is a home field advantage. Or you get into the girl a lot and it makes your girlfriend think you were just trying to cheat by having the person getting all the attention from you is in your bed. Then I said, ""do you get someone you know or a stranger""
The stranger can be the one who draws them away to attentive sex. Of course most women doing each other are probably not going at it like that. I am sure it is a bit more sensual, but can get pretty intense with that advantage.

Hell the guy might just as well like sex with a man more and not realize it until it happens as well. Crazier things have happened.

193602,3,1573628042,"Marty reminds of your typical Silicon Valley type who immigrated to California, specifically the Bay Area, after achieving academic success, and cashed it to become a social success, and ""get revenge"" on the bullies of their days of yore, and marry that beautiful wife because you've proven you're a good provider.

The only problem is that said person has exchanged one set of morals for another, and found themselves in that same moral debt that they accuse to many others of.  Marty, if he were living here, would be a coder of some kind living around San Jose, or in the south bay somewhere.  He would hang out at bars filled with other silicon valley types, and fantasize about the sexual fantasies he had in high school, then decide whether or not to risk his marriage to make that fantasy come true.

So it is with this film, and we see a man whose own social habitations and own inclinations strong arm his wife with his small cute man charm, and reluctantly she succumbs to his desires.  From here the monster is created, and Marty finds that he's gotten more than he bargained for.

I've met many Marty types here where I live, and I always feel unclean afterwards.  When you don't have the kind of brawn or other physical attributes to attract a mate, you rely on your guile, and when you succeed it becomes addicting, because it's the one tool you really have to win in life.  Marty is such a man.  But Marty has a moral compass that's being led astray by another magnetic field, one that bring his wife and his whole life into misalignment.

When you have a loving, caring and beautiful wife like a Mariel Hemmingway, you're supposed to love her, keep her happy, and live your life.  You don't force her to do things, whatever they are.  You take responsibility to make sure that she is happy, and she'll take care of you.  If that fails, then you part ways.

Marty is about to learn the the hard way of the old adage; ""be careful what you wish for...""  Will he be a better man for it?  That's something film doesn't even address, but we do see a perpetual moral failure on his part time and again.

This is allegedly a comedy, and where there are one or two laughs in this film, I can't say I laughed a great deal.  In fact, because Marty reminded me of so many men of poor character that I had met, I found myself disliking him on a gut level.  Did that truncate my ability to tune into the film's humor?  I don't think so.  For all of the lightheartedness the film brings to the screen, it genuinely isn't all that funny, but for me personally, it has a kind of charm through reminding me of some of the scum bags I met during 90s dot-market boom, and before.

For the female audience; ladies, just because you married a man who is capable of bringing home six figure salaries, is kind of cute in a geeky sort of way and regales you with tales of being bullied when he was younger, that doesn't make him worthy of your attentions.  This film shows that in spades.

For all that, this film needed to be improved upon in the humor department.  But, with such an unlikable character as Marty, one is hard pressed to give the writers material to work with.  Hemmingway does give very convincing performances, and Mike Binder does give us a character that you have to decide for yourself whether he is worth Hemmingway's attentions or not.

A top notch production with first rate performances, I can't fault it technically, but the material itself is something I'm not a fan of, and I'm surprised was created the way it was.  What do I mean by that?  I think there's a better film to be made here, but I'll be the first to admit that I'm not sure how that film is to be produced.

193603,5,1573628042,"This movie was vastly under-rated upon it's release and even on DVD release. The premise of men wanting their wife to make it with another woman while they grease themselves up and dive in the middle is pretty universal. It's funny how two women making love turns men on but two men making love disgusts them!

Well, this husband gets his wish but by getting his wish, he literally opens Pandora's Box! Being a lesbian myself it isn't hard to understand and any woman reading this will understand when I say that most men have no understanding that women take a long time just to warm up in bed. Men don't get this. Two women get this instantly and this man's wife lights up like a pinball machine in the most hilarious way that threatens his livelihood, his manhood and their marriage!

Just trust me! Watch this movie and you will have a great movie night and realize that sometimes opening up that fantasy with your wife is not always the smartest thing you can do!",1354579200,2,968,4.494318181818182

193615,5,1573628042,"A movie with some very funny moments. There were a few scenes that caused me to laugh hysterically and that is usual for me when something strikes my funny bone.

Mariel Hemmingway who is a bit of a favorite of mine, definitely brings strong acting talent to this movie. Her wardrobe is interesting yet appropriate for the scenes in the movie.

Mike Binder does a great job of carrying the movie with a combination of almost dramatic acting skills but definite ability as a straight man and the occasional goof ball.

Missy Crider is always a good actress, in this movie I don't think she was given a strong enough role and the part she had did not give her adequate room to demonstrate her true skills or to allow her usual sensual self to come through.

I believe the movie would have been much better had Mariel and Missy had each others' roles. But obviously the director thought otherwise. Directors always have the right to be wrong I guess.

Warning; do not let the title or the movie synopsis fool you. There is almost nothing erotic about this movie. It is funny, but not erotic. The jacket suggests a lot of lesbian activity. Most of that activity is not seen however but implied or happens with the camera elsewhere. On the eroticism scale this movie is a 2 out of 10. There is also very little in the way of actual nudity. For the most part (with the exception of what I noted above) the movie was well cast. The plot is plausible but the sequence of events is not, hence we have a clever comedy. I recommend this movie for a good laugh only. It is not a movie to watch for the whole family due to the adult theme of lesbianism and sexual threesomes. As a non-erotic comedy I would rate this 4 stars on the Amazon scale but gave it 5 as a whole.",1319846400,5,1757,4.344512195121951

Predictably, he resents his wife's discovery of her sexual joy with females and his fantasy-come-true starts to become a nightmare. The Freudian pink elephant in the room is how she, who had no interest in exploring sexual adventures, is deemed the ""sex monster"" when it was he who had a sex monster inside his brain begging for an opportunity to destroy marital boundaries. And there must be something spiking this film's Southern California drinking water, because the married are either unfaithful or frustrated -- and the singles succumb easily to temptation.",1319068800,,947,4.925

The cast is great, especially Hemingway in a role she hasn't played before. Binder is so enjoyable you forget the stupid stuff and your just watching him bumble away which gives the movie its energy juice. Stephen Baldwin (The Usual Suspects, Spiders Web) has a supporting role as one of Binder's friends and Melissa Crider (A Boy Called Hate, Frailty) also stars as one of Hemingway's sexual partners.

193636,3,1573628042,"I am always interested in movies that deal with ""alternate life styles.""
I was not expecting this movie to be pornographic but rather, I was expecting and hoping it would be a witty view of bisexualism, something like ""In and Out"" which I found smart and witty.
I laughed a great deal at the beginning of the film.  The fact that the wife, played by Mariel Hemingway, is a very average kind of woman turned not only insatiable, but insatiable for members of the same sex, is quite amusing.  And yes, I got a little turned on by a couple of the sexy scenes.
Where the flick lost me was when her behavior becomes responsible for her husband's loss of business by behaving outrageously toward her lovers during an important luncheon.  The scene is clownish, as if we are to understand that when a woman becomes bisexual, she turns into a ""Sex Monster,"" (and the monster has to be controlled).
Why do films about bisexuality and homosexuality always seem to grow into treatises?  The messages of the film are clear: Don't ""go bi"" unless you want to: 1.)alienate your spouse, 2.) be thought of as a ""freak."" and 3.) ruin everyone's life by making a fool of yourself

 Mike Binder, (from HBO's Mind of the Married Man), is a modern day observational genius when it comes to the new millennium sexual relationship. Also, he is a fine actor with a recent and perfect portrayal of a criminal in Minority Report. If you have an ideal relationship with your spouse or significant other, you will not appreciate Mr. Binder's brilliance.

 I know that I'm not saying much, or anything, about the movie. Any explaination will give too much information away and spoil the surprises. As with anything Binder is involved in, the circumstances and situations are not as simple as they appear.

He's got the best droll take on marriage and I'm guessing this film is the forerunner of his tv show. He's an ispired comic and as a director gets a wicked performance from Mariel Hemingway who has got great timing and is still, I have to say, awesome to look at. Steve Baldwin is in this and so is Kevin Pollack. Both very funny. Fast, silly, sexy, racy, and inspired. Rent  it, buy it whatever.
