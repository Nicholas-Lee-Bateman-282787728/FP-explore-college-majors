4336191,2,B004EC5IWU,"""The Resident"" is 2011 drama/horror/thriller film that basically puts an emphasis on the saying ""if it's too good to be true, it probably is"".

It is about a woman (Juliet Dermer played by Hilary Swank) that goes looking for an apartment to stay at, eventually finds one that is just too good to be true; affordable, extremely spacious and not only that, the landlord is a good-looking, charming man that cares for his tenants (no, really, a landlord that cares!). The landlord (Max played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan), however, ends up forming a dangerous obsession to Juliet and the movie trailer pretty much sums up the whole thing. Everything you see in the official movie trailer for this movie is pretty much what the movie is like.

Two stars is actually a generous rating in my opinion because this movie did not succeed in anything that it was meant to succeed in.

The movie failed for a few reasons.

Reason 1: I think this reason is ESPECIALLY true for me, but the villain, Max, is too good looking. He plays the role of a sick, invasive, and mentally unstable pervert that peeks through hidden crevices in the wall throughout the apartment. Or at least he's SUPPOSE to seem that way. However, the way he looks and the way he acts never truly gives me that impression. Usually, the role of the villain in question is suppose to be fulfilled by a sickly looking man that's not so attractive and is more suspicious looking. Personally, I wanted Juliet to dump Jack, her boyfriend/ex? and go with Max.

Reason 2: The plot and storyline of the movie is incredibly straightforward and predictable. There was definitely no mystery in who the villain is as it is clearly revealed fairly early in the story. So due to that, you never remain alert to the details to the movie because the main perpetrator has already been revealed. The ending held no surprises and the action scenes lack all sense of suspense.

Reason 3: Drama, horror, thriller. Was the movie dramatic and made me feel connected to the character? No. Did the movie scare me or give me the sense of being horrified? No. Did it contain suspenseful, thrilling moments that put me on the edge of my seat wondering what'll come next? No. Predictable from beginning to end.

Throughout the movie, you'll probably be thinking ""oh I've seen that before"".

Don't watch the trailer, it's basically the whole movie compressed. It's one of THOSE movies.",1297296000,17,2407,4.714285714285714

4336222,4,B004EC5IWU,"Decent movie that had great potential. Worth watching. The actor who played Max was too likeable to be believable as a bad guy. Hilary Swank's character was just annoying and the actress isn't a good match for the role of this desirable woman Max is obsessed with. Didn't like Swank with Jeffrey Dean Morgan either. And the scene when she rejects this gorgeous man is unrealistic, especially since she came onto him in the first place.

I am JDM fan and have watched a lot of his movies/tv shows. He is very versatile and always great in every role.  However, I could not see him in this role.  Maybe it was because I didn't want to?  The movie has such great potential but falls flat.  There were no twists to the story line,  No suspense. You knew what was coming.  It was confusing at times as it jumped to the backstory of the characters but never really painted a full picture.  It was disjointed and just odd.

4336246,3,B004EC5IWU,"I am a JDM fan, therefore I feel it my duty to watch everything he has done. It took me a long time to watch this because I have a hard time buying Morgan as a stalker type and there were parts that were difficult to see. Even after watching, I still don't fully buy Morgan in this role the way I should, but I am glad I finally bit the bullet. Many people wrote that this was well-acted and well-shot. I agree. It's such a shame that they didn't take their time with this. Someone described Swank's character as one dimensional and it's true. I admire her loyalty to her relationship and even though it's hard to imagine turning down someone who appears to be as sweet and handsome as Morgan's character, Max, I did get it. Loyalty can really bind people. But there should have been more to show why she so easily went back to her cheating boyfriend. I mean it was easy to see how vulnerable she was, but there should have been some deeper discussion between them. It would have helped add some dimension to her character. The biggest missed opportunity was with Morgan's character and his grandfather. You got a superficial understanding about what messed up Max, but his behavior clearly has more behind it and it was left to the viewer to figure that out for themselves. You could see the grandfather had a lot under the surface that should have been explored more. I suppose the producers simply wanted us to be on the side of the victim, but how about giving me the full picture and leaving that up to me?",1432598400,7,1511,4.4

4336273,2,B004EC5IWU,"The Resident (Antti Jokinen, 2011)

I saw a number of articles at the close of 2011 that were strident--perhaps I should say virulent--in choosing The Resident as the single worst horror film of 2011. Strong words indeed, especially in a year that saw the release of such gems as Baby Shower, Red State, The Inheritance, The Human Centipede 2, A Haunting in Salem... I could go on naming worse horror films from 2011 for the entirely of this review. Which, I hasten to add, does not mean The Resident is a GOOD movie--it's just not as terrible as some folks would have you believe.

Jokinen, a TV and documentary director working on his first feature, gives us the story of Juliet Devereaux (Million Dollar Baby's Hilary Swank), a doctor currently on the outs with her boyfriend and looking for a cheap place to live while she completes her residency. She finds what seems to be the perfect apartment (and let's be real here, that's not an apartment, that's a damn duplex) in a house owned and maintained by hunky Max (Watchmen's Jeffrey Dean Morgan). The two seem as if they might be getting off on the right foot, but when the ex re-enters the picture, Max ramps up the woo he's pitching in, shall we say, not the most up-front of ways...

I guess I can kind of understand the venom; this was supposed to be Hammer Films' big comeback in the horror genre, and to say the least, it isn't. Jokinen was probably not the right director for this, first of all; his lush camerawork would have felt much more at home in a costume drama than a claustrophobic horror film. (The disastrous 1999 The Haunting remake had this same problem: if you spend more time admiring the architecture than paying attention to the plot...) Morgan did make a solid bad guy--in fact, the entire cast did as good a job as they could with substandard material, and I only touched the tip of the casting iceberg here (Aunjanue Ellis, Christopher Lee [in his first Hammer film in thirty-five years], Nana Visitor, and Michael Badalucco all make appearances)--but that phrase can be qualified with ""as long as the script stayed plausible"", which died out around two-thirds of the way through the movie. And, in the end, the whole thing felt like a weird, not-quite-ripoff of the 1978 sexy-day-real-estate movie The Sentinel, albeit without the Satanic angle.

4336283,2,B004EC5IWU,"Just watched The Resident starring 2 time Academy Award winning actress Hilary Swank .It's from the revised version of the U.K. premier horror film producers Hammer. Here are my thoughts. Good Points : Finnish Director Antii Jokinen has a good eye for colors and images. He makes The Resident a very watchable film as far as scenery goes. The film is set in NYC Brooklyn in particular and Antii makes you feel that you are amidst all that is NYC. The acting by 4/5ths of the cast is quite good. Ms. Swank is fine as the ER doctor Julie as is Jeffrey Dean Morgan as her landlord Max. Aunjanue Ellis as Julies friend Sydney is quite good and in an under developed  role Hammer icon Christopher Lee proves that he still has it. The film is 91 minutes meaning it's not overly long. Now for the bad things: The film is derivative of a slew of previous stalker type thrillers. Nothing in The Resident is something that you haven't seen before. Director Antii Jokinen is not good at pacing a story. He also adds in a dual perspective flashback shot from Max's viewpoint that is more distracting than  productive. It adds no new light other than the fact that Max's father murdered his mother and then killed himself. The writing is awful ,the plot has holes and every non Julie or Max character is under developed. We never get a feel for why Julie and Jack( Lee Pace) split up other than the stereotypical ""I never see you"" or ""We Grew Apart"" .We see that Max is nuts a compulsive stalker with a twisted world view and sexual issues. But nothing in the story really gives a good theory as to why Max becomes obsessed with Julie. His interactions with his Grandfather August played by Christopher Lee don't really explain his motivations either. August calls him weak like his father but there's no elaboration. Lee Pace as Jack is wooden and you see no reason why a woman like Julie would want to rekindle her romance with him. Even Max is a more attractive option and he's nuts. Another writing flaw is that Max comes off sympathetic for about 2/3rds of the film and you start to feel sorry for him which takes away from what he is actually doing to Julie. In a way Julie sets the wheels in motion by coming onto Max and then hitting the brakes right away. Now a lot of men and people in general can relate to being shunned and left hanging in the wind like Max was. This of course in no way justifies Max's stalking ,drugging and assaulting of Julie. But the writers make it seem as in some way Julie has it coming for leading Max on. It's funny too how Ms. Swank who's in great physical shape takes pride in showing the viewers that fact by jogging several times. stretching to show off her muscle tone and giving fleeting glimpses of her naked body  But I do think Hilary does have a great smile which she flashes several times in the film. Overall The Resident is disappointing in that it should have been much better than it came out. Swank is a fine actress and Morgan who I was not familiar with prior to this film is a good actor with a great voice. Hopefully Hammer will keep on making more films but one hopes that they are better than The Resident was.",1348012800,,3158,4.404109589041096

4336285,3,B004EC5IWU,"The Resident is about a landlord that is obsessed with his new tenant. It started off well, but ended terribly.

What did I like? It had some great tension; every time he was creeping through the apartment, I felt the suspense and was always asking ""will be get caught?"". The acting was decent. Overall, I really liked the first half of the movie.

What did I dislike? The ending was terrible. It quickly changes from a creepy little movie to a very generic slasher. You'll be able to guess every twist and turn; it looks like that killed him, he pops up somewhere else, repeat (like a Friday the 13th movie). It was also a very abrupt ending. Overall, a terrible second half.

Overall, I don't recommend directly paying to watch this movie. If you want to watch it, it's available on Netflix Streaming so save some money.

This movie has brief nudity, sex, violence and blood.",1342742400,,877,4.56687898089172
4336286,2,B004EC5IWU,"A disappointing feature from Hammer Films, ""The Resident"" is a totally predictable thriller that misses any chance at originality with a very predictable plot and no surprises. The only fun here is watching Jeffrey Dean Morgan given screen time to play a slightly more complex bad guy than we usually see in the movies.

After breaking up with her boyfriend (the marvelous Lee Pace wasted in his role here), ER doc Juliet Devereau (Hilary Swank)is looking for a new apartment and a fresh start for her life. She finds the perfect place in a building owned by Max (Morgan) and his grandfather August (Christopher Lee)with great square footage, a vintage look and view at a reasonable price. Max and his grandfather are having the building renovated and, as a result, they don't have any other tenants aside from themselves.

After settling into the place Devereau feels like she's being watched although she puts it down to exhaustion and an overworked imagination. She finds herself attracted to Max but is uncertain about carrying on a relationship with her landlord and this is complicated by her desire to see her ex again.

""The Resident"" has a good set up and a great cast but they aren't given much to do beyond embelishing a paint-by-numbers thriller that is predictable right down to the final showdown between Juliet and her stalker. It's a pity because the cast IS terrific and Swank does a fine job as the strong woman-in-peril. Lee who appeared in a number of classic (and not-so-classic) Hammer films is a nice prescence but not much is done with his character which is too bad because he still has a commanding presence on screen. There are a couple of nice imaginative touches in the film but these are few and fleeting. These imaginative moments aren't enough to save a very routine and disappointing thriller. The moody cinematography of Guillermo Navarro is also one of the saving graces of ""The Resident"".

The blu-ray looks quite nice although there are some issues with compression in a couple of scenes although the texture and color (although a little warm) are nicely rendered here. The lossless audio sounds quite nice with nice depth, clear dialogue and nice directional use of the surround format.

The special features are limited to a theatrical trailer. It's too bad we didn't get an audio commentary track that or something that gave us an idea as to the development of the film as sometimes these things are fascinating because they can truly given you an idea as to where the film went wrong.

""The Resident"" has good performances, nice moody photography but neither one can save ""The Resident"" from its predictable script and direction. The blu-ray presentation looks quite nice despite some minor issues with compression.

If you want to see ""The Resident"" I'd recommend renting it. It's not above the standard of your typical made-for-TV Sy-Fy Channel originals (well, except for the nude scenes of Swank).",1342310400,,2942,4.919354838709677

4336289,2,B004EC5IWU,"The Resident could have been great if it wasn't so predictable. To me what makes a great horror/thriller film is that it is unpredictable. I could guess almost every single thing that was going to happen in this movie BEFORE it happened which I hate. Hilary Swank plays a character who is an ER doctor in search of an apartment. She finds the ideal place that is afforable and has a hot landlord who really cares about his tenants. Once she moves someone starts watching/stalking her but who could it be? You see Hillary's character going through the same routine every night which is boring. Also it doesn't take long for the movie to let you know exactly who it is which is an EPIC FAIL!!

These are the reasons that this movie falls really short:
1. Very predictable
2. The movie trailer gives away almost everything
3. The stalker is unreveiled too early in the movie

If you have a free evening The Resident isn't a horrible movie to watch but I can find a lot better movies instead. I watched it once and that was enough. It is very forgetable not to mention (again) predictable.",1331596800,2,1085,4.50253807106599

It's just that after doing what most actresses can only dream--winning multiple acting Oscars--you would expect her to have a good sense for bad scripts.  How this one slipped through is beyond me.  This is your standard stalker movie, complete with the cliches of The Talking Killer and The Killer Who Looks Dead But Really Isn't.

Kudos to Mr. Morgan, he was a little bit creepier than your usual stalker, and Christopher Lee did a nice job in all of the 2 minutes he was onscreen, but they weren't able to save this stinker.

She looks hot on the box cover, but you put the movie in and it's the winner of the Kentucky Derby all over again.  I'm sorry, but talent and looks don't always go together, and this movie was a bad showcase for her talent.  Just like Obsessed, Fatal Attraction, Mother May I Sleep with Dummy, and Sleeping with the Idiot, this is just another in a long line of predictable thrillers with no thrill at all.  You've seen it before, heard about it before, smelled it before, etc.  Pass this one up.

4336292,2,B004EC5IWU,"I've always liked Hilary Swank and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Christopher Lee is on a whole different level. Few actors have done what he's accomplished in his ridiculously long career. But none of them could save The Resident from being just another notch on their IMDB pages.

The movie's script is terrible and that's pretty much all you need to know. The plot isn't all that creative, but this wouldn't have been a problem for scary movies. Scary movies usually have a problem finding decent actors. With The Resident, we had the problem reversed.

I would give them credit for trying, but I can't really. I don't know what their financial situations are, but it looks like these guys just did it for the money. The last half hour of the movie is pretty unbearable. I guess I give Jeffrey Morgan credit for not laughing. But it wasn't a good movie.

I don't know what position you would be in that would make The Resident a viable movie going option, but don't waste your time. Morgan might have a cult following, but don't see this just to say that you've seen all his movies. The Resident isn't good and I wished I hadn't seen it.",1329436800,2,1130,4.529411764705882

The acting was well done by both main characters although I was sad that Christoper Lee didn't have a bigger part in the film.  The pacing is nicely done.  The movie wastes no time getting to Juliet getting the willies about her new apartment.  The apartment is nicely done too.  The lighting in the apartment casts shadows and it is difficult to tell if someone is there or not.  The camera shows different viewpoints from the drain and other areas as seen through his eyes.  There were also some other creepy moments like when she is laying in bed. The ending is predictable but well done.  Both main characters get blows in and also receive blows in the final confrontation.

My only  little peeve with the movie is that we never know why he picks her.  He sees her at the hospital trying to save someone's life then...wow I just gotta have her.

This is one sick, creepy dude. She starts to sense something's wrong and makes moves to figure it all out.

I'm a Hilary Swank fan and she doesn't disappoint here. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is very good as the landlord. Lee Pace has too small a role as Swank's beau. It's shot well, cut well, good music and sound design. It's just doesn't come together. It's slow, and something in the story lacks dynamic quality. Then you get to the climax and it gets pretty stupid. It runs on too long. The landlord turns into the thing that wouldn't die and Swank can't get a good enough signal on her cell phone to call for help. A movie that tries to avoid cliche throughout turns into one big cliche in the end.

The Resident is a relatively unique idea for the story as it revolves a creepy stalker renting out a room.  This is nice in that it proves that watching someone sleep with dreamy eyes is NOT romantic, it's being a stalker (You hear that Twilight fans?  It's not cute!  It's called stalking!!).  It brought about some moments of tension but they didn't last long and they were few and far in between.  The film didn't quite grab me the way I wanted to.

Don't get me wrong; Swank, Morgan, and Lee were great as they have always been.  It truly was an all-star cast with a two-time academy award winner, The Comedian, and a Bond villain.  Problem is that a film is like a sports team in that you can't win just on the talent of a few participants.  Without the proper production crew The Resident just didn't quite cut it.

BUT THE CHILLING point of the movie isn't lost on me, I was dating a woman who got a cheap basement apartment not far from my place that was fairly large but only a small portion of a lower level of the building, VERY CHEAP, with water garbage and free cable included for under $200 a couple years ago, in the lower level of one of the biggest most expensive houses around, and the lady upstairs, an elderly widow woman in her 90's, problem is like in the movie, ""very cheap"" means the old woman and her old kids and great grandchildren were always walking through the apartment when my girlfriend was gone, checking out things, even listening in when I was over visiting, them repeating things we talked of the night before accidently or to intimidate her.  Come to find out, there was a secret door behind a hinged paneling panel, go left ajar due to a sock blocking closure, I saw a hallway the length of her apartment, two chairs, and the cellphone I was missing that I had left in the living room when I stayed one evening months prior.

4336299,4,B004EC5IWU,"The Resident has a simple set-up, but it's all in the execution and the details.  Hillary Swank stars as a woman coming out of a bad relationship and seeking a new start, who manages to land a lavish apartment in a luxury building she normally couldn't afford.  Landlord Jeffrey Dean Morgan is rennovating the entire, now practically vacant, building himself, and explains that rentals are so cheap right now because of all the noise and disturbances from the repairs, and Swank jumps at the opportunity.  One of the few other tenants of the building is its third star, Christopher Lee playing Morgan's partially infirm grandfather.

It quickly becomes evident that someone is watching and stalking Swank's character, and rather than keep everything under wraps, the movie makes like a whodunit and puts its possibilities out on the table to try to figure out.  It could be Morgan, the landlord with whom Swank seems to share a mutual attraction; it could be Lee, the kindly-seeming but sometimes suspicious-acting old gentleman; it could be an unseen, unmentioned additional tenant inhabiting one of the building's apartments.  To me, the movie does a better job at suspense and atmosphere than other recent 'obsessive stalker' movies like The Roommate, and its overall edge is sharper as it gets darker, a bit weirder and considerably more disturbing as it progresses.  All three main players give high-quality performances, and the characters, despite the familiar set-up, don't come across as stereotyped or at all dull.

Though definately a suspense thriller, I'd also classify The Resident as a horror movie, and I think it'll appeal to fans of both camps.  Speaking of its status as a horror movie - it's SO good to have Christopher Lee back in a horror movie, and it's icing on the cake that it happens to be one of the first films out the gate from recently reformed Hammer Studios.  Lee was one of horror's most prolific lead actors from about the late-50s through the mid-70s, with many of his most memorable movies being Hammer productions, then seemed to largely fade from prominence.  Ever since his big career upsurge with the Star Wars prequels and the Lord Of The Rings trilogy I've been waiting to see if he'd do another horror movie, and here he has.  Welcome back to the genre!

A lot of work has been done to restore the historic hot spot: new wood floors, wine closet, floor-to-ceiling windows, and enough secret tunnels, peepholes, hidden doors, and ways to spy on his tenants that the previous owner was probably Michael Jackson.

Sounds a lot like a poor man's Sliver, right?  Except Morgan is no Baldwin brother, and comparing Swank to 1993 Sharon Stone is laughable at best.

Well, there isn't much deviation from the source material, but there is a little spice thrown in with a People Under the Stairs motif.  Which I liked.

Some wonderful cinematography (Guillermo Navarro) and framing of the limitlessly diverse New York scenery serves as the true suspense of the movie, as it's readily apparent what's going to happen from beginning to end.  There is a tired subplot involving ex-boyfriend fodder and Max's disapproving geriatric grandfather, but no actual effort is made explaining Max's actions.

The story opens up with a female surgeon (Hilary Swank) who'd recently separated from her boyfriend seeking a new place to live. Through some chance events, she happens on a gorgeous flat. She immediately (and rightly) thinks she wouldn't be able to afford it, however, the landlord (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) cuts her a deal that seemed too good to be true. As the story unfolds, we learned *why* the deal seemed too good to be true.

This is one of those movies that's borderline for me. There were a few creepy elements, but there were elements that left me scratching my head because they seemed misplaced. A few times, the movie grazed greatness, but never quite got there. Given the script and the roles they had to play, I believe Swank and Morgan did a fantastic job, however, their performances weren't enough to save the movie for me.

Take the female lead, for instance, makes some stupid decisions that any woman in her right mind wouldn't do, especially when she starts thinking that something's amiss with her new flat. Or the landlord's father (Christopher Lee), I never did quite get the point of his role--it seemed extraneous. Finally, the end left me a little cold.

4336306,3,B004EC5IWU,"It was really hard to rate this film. On the one hand, the character of the spooky landlord falling for the beautiful new tenant has been done before. Hilary Swank, ER doctor, fresh from a broken relationship, moves into an absolutely gorgeous, huge and surprisingly cheap NYC apartment after advertising she needed someplace to live. Like a miracle, a super nice landlord practically gives the place to her after he's finished remodeling it.

He spies on her, watching her comings and goings, basically so he can turn up where she is, pretend it's accidental, and get more chances to talk to her. Okay, chilling enough, but once she decides to consider seeing her former boyfriend again things go haywire. And all that's done well. It's scary, suspenseful and the plot zooms.

But, then... Things get so improbable it's almost laughable. Hard to believe Swank took this role, considering the last half or so of the movie. How the landlord went about getting her info in the first place is just insanely stupid. Likewise how things go in the last quarter or so of the film are almost slapstick it's so weird.

I can't really recommend the movie. I've seen worse, but the ending left a bad taste in my mouth, and that's the impression I'm left with. Swank fans who want to see all her films may want to rent it, but that's about it. Oh well.",1308182400,,1340,4.6455696202531644

There are two core faults.  The first is the casting of Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the antagonist.  Morgan is just too lovable, too blindingly charismatic, to play a character we're supposed to fear or hate, although Morgan's performance is almost astonishingly good considering the material.  The second is the script: co-written by the film's ruthlessly unimaginative director, Antti Jokinen (this is his first film), the story was a dead horse two decades ago, and the writers can't even fathom why it might need to be injected with something fresh or original.  Who can't predict every point of the plot progression?  ""The Resident"" is offensively dull, a sure disappointment for Hammer fans.

And on and on....

This movie was an okay way to waste 90 minutes on a rainy evening, but I don't think I would recommend it to anyone or ever watch it again.

4336311,3,B004EC5IWU,"Director Antti Jokinen from Finland graduated from East Carolina University and has made a name for himself directing music videos.  This landed him a directorial spot on ""The Resident"" which boasts its star Hilary Swank as an executive producer.  Unfortunately, the screenplay does not hold up well.  We get to know Hilary's character Juliet Devereau, apparently an emergency room physician, who has recently broken up with Jack played by Lee Pace.  The breakup causes her to live in a hotel and search for an apartment.  The too-good-to-be-true deal that Max, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, offers proves exactly that.  Morgan was in ""P.S. I Love You"" and had a reoccurring role as Katherine Heigl's boyfriend on ""Grey's Anatomy.""  In the first act of the film, we see a budding attraction between landlord and tenant, which comes to the cusp of consummation, but something seems weird.  Act II begins and we telescopically have reverse action that takes us back to the hospital where we see Jeffrey Dean Morgan spotting Swank and grabbing her number off a bulletin board about the apartment.  Swank wants to be just friends with Morgan and rekindles her romance with Pace.  There didn't seem to be much spark between Pace and Swank.  Then the third act comes where suddenly Swank's unease in her apartment causes her to install a security monitoring system.  The gold scene in the film is watching Swank look at her own violation on the computer and breaking down entirely.  Meanwhile, Morgan for some unknown reason wakes up and decides he'll kill his grandfather, August, played by Christopher Lee.  Lee's haunting weird intensity was a plus for the film, but didn't seem to propel the story.  The film comes to its smashing conclusion and promptly goes to credits without denouement.  While the actors handle the performances well enough, the screenplay is so clunky that it does not survive as a good movie.  Taxi!",1306713600,,1921,4.971786833855799

So - it makes it clear who the bad guy is, right?  I mean - they make no bones about it right from the get-go. So, that makes it predictable.  Yet, the movie itself is still pretty entertaining.  I quite liked it but could not give it more than 3 stars.  Well, you pretty much know what's going on from the very beginning, and I thought they might throw me a twist or something, but they don't.

4336315,3,B004EC5IWU,"The Resident is the latest a Hammer Production, yes ladies and gentlemen they're back!  Any film buff worth his salt knows about Hammer's illustrious history of producing low budget and unique films during the 50's. 60's and early 70's.  But during the mid-70's, the studio went pear shape and stopped making films after their brief collaboration with Shaw Brothers Studios.  But it's the 10's and Hammer is back with it's second film (the first one was Let Me In).  Unfortunately, 2011's offering is The Resident.

The movie stars Hillary Swank (who is one of the producers of the film) as Juliet (looking quite sinewy) , a Doctor who's desperately looking for a new place to live after a break up with her boyfriend.  After find a few places that weren't quite up to her standards, she finds her dream home, a flat that is being remodeled by Max, a handsome middle aged dude who shares the building with his grandfather August (the great Christopher Lee and notable Hammer veteran).  Soon Juliet and Max become a pair until the two Exes decide to ""work things out"".  Max doesn't take to kindly to this and his obsession with Juliet and reach a nasty and brutal conclusion.

I found the movie to be ""okay"".  I mean this latest production didn't dredge up any memories of the classic Hammer Films (except the few mediocre ones that they put out).  I mean it's a sleazy thriller that the company cranked out during it's hey day.  One thing I enjoyed about this movie was it's claustrophobic feel and sweaty aura.  Other than that, it was pretty mundane.  I recommend watching this one on a slow night when there's nothing good at the video store or kiosk.

It's okay.",1305590400,,1666,4.657534246575342
4336316,4,B004EC5IWU,"Juliet Devereau (Hilary Swank, ""The Reaping"") is an ER doctor who recently divorced her husband Jack (Lee Pace, ""Possession"") for committing adultery.  She moves into a Brooklyn brownstone that is being renovated by the owner/landlord Max (Jeffrey Dean Morgan, ""Watchmen"") and his elderly grandfather August (Christopher Lee, ""Horror Express"").  Reasonably rented at $3,800 per month, the large apartment seems too good to be true.  It most definitely is!  A train runs beneath the building and cell phone reception is poor but, worse of all, someone is hiding in secret passages, watching Juliet through peep holes.  Then the spying turns to touching, molesting and, finally, to killing.

  My collection of Hammer films is extremely vast.  Hammer is most famous for their low-budget gothic horror films which had their heyday during the late fifties to early seventies.  Legendary horror actor Christopher Lee starred in numerous Hammer films; he is best known for his portrayal as the most handsome sensual vampire of all time, Count Dracula.  Unfortunately, Hammer went out of business in the mid-seventies.  Christopher Lee starred in their last gothic film, ""To the Devil a Daughter,"" which also starred Natasha Kinski.  However, like the vampire itself, Hammer has been resurrected.  Recently, they released the highly successful vampire film ,""Let Me In,"" an American remake of the Swedish classic, ""Let the Right One in.""  I was honored to review another one of their latest, ""The Resident.""

  Reminiscent of Hammer's women-in-peril classics such as ""Die! Die! My Darling,"" ""Straight on Till Morning"" and ""Fear in the Night,"" ""The Resident"" stars Hilary Swank as the super fit, super intelligent doctor who is more independent than the other females in Hammer's previous women-in-peril films.  However, loneliness and confusion make her vulnerable.  Juliet yearns for the sexy, hunky landlord Max but still pines for her equally accomplished ex-husband Jack.  Honestly, Juliet seems to spend too much time in the ER and jogging, as though training for the triathlon; her neglected, lonely husband probably sought solace in the arms of another woman.  Speaking of loneliness, Max is also lonely, having spent most of his time being abused by his overbearing grandfather Max.  Consequently, Max spies on his tenants from the secret passages built around the individual apartments.  Loneliness is a deadly emotion that can lead to insanity and murder.

  I found ""The Resident"" to be a highly stressful, nerve-racking experience.  The final showdown with the nail gun is one for the horror annals.  A pounding rock score from John Ottman, wonderful direction from Antti J. Jokinen, great acting from all the leads, and a creepy, Brooklyn setting make ""The Resident"" a great late-night horror film.  As a personal treat to myself, I watched ""The Resident"" on Friday 13th.  In regards to other voyeuristic films I've watched, I enjoyed it much better than ""Sliver,"" starring Sharon Stone and William Baldwin, but not as much as the most excellent ""Crawlspace,"" starring Klaus Kinski, father of Natasha Kinski.  In ""Crawlspace,"" a Nazi doctor spies on his female tenants while murdering their lovers; it has gruesome deaths, a high body count and a beautiful piano score from Pino Dinoggio (""Carrie,"" ""The Howling"" and ""Piranha"").

  My only complaint is not about the film itself but its mediocre presentation from Image Entertainment.  It lacks special features such as a ""Making Of Featurette,"" ""Deleted Scenes,"" ""Outtakes,"" etc.  However, it does have a trailer for the subject film plus two others:  In ""The Reef,"" survivors of a capsized boat are terrorized by sharks.  In ""Chain Letter,"" a chain-wielding psychopath murders teens who have broken an internet chain letter.  Thankfully, the film has English SDH and Spanish subtitles and a theatrical widescreen presentation of 2.35:1.  However, I do wish that Anchor Bay had released this film.  I love watching featurettes depicting how a horror film was made, especially if they have a lot of special effects.  I would've liked to know how much of the film was actually filmed in New York and how much was filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

  ""The Resident"" is a must see for all Hammer fans.  I hope to see more releases from this studio.  It is also recommended for those who enjoy women-in-peril films.  Most especially, I recommend it to fans of the legendary Christopher Lee who has starred in over a hundred films, most of them horror.  Though I wished his role had been greater, it was a very important one.  He was superb as the condescending, abusive grandfather, August.  I hope to see him in more horror films from Hammer.

4336317,1,B004EC5IWU,"Normally I don't try to reveal spoilers on my book and DVD reviews but I owe a favor to anyone who might consider renting, buying or viewing this horrible piece of movie making (and calling it movie making is an exaggeration).
Hilary Swank, an Oscar winning actress had taken quite a career tumble as she portrays an emergency room doctor seeking an apartment in NYC. She comes across a huge apartment at a bargain rate. (Warning one-If you get an amazing bargain in NYC, something bad is about to happen!)
She rents the apartment from Jeffery Dean Morgan (who I wail always remember as ""dead Denny"" in Gray's Anatomy which spoiled that entire series for me forever) is the landlord and as the viewer finds out early in the movie he is a combination stalker/pervert/peeping tom/sex addict/psycho/killer who spends more time sneaking around Hilary's apartment than she does. He also has multiple viewing areas into the apartment which allow him to view Swank at his leisure. He can watch her as she bathes, cooks, sleeps and drinks. (which is part of her problem. ER doctors need to be careful about drinking too much)
Christopher Lee is totally wasted in his role as the grandfather of Morgan who starts off as a spooky old man and ends up as a dead one.
Lee Pace is Swank's ex boyfriend who manages to rekindle his romance with her and anyone who has ever seen a suspense cum horror film knows what happens to that kind of person. No surprise here.
The last 20 minutes of this film is tediously filled with Swank taking down her landlord in a knock down drag out ridiculous physical battle and him rising again like Michael Myers in the Halloween films. I get so tired of heroines who never watch one of the films over the last 50 years where you knock the bad guy down, run away and have him pop up again in the most unlikely spots. Eventually Swank prevails, the bad guy is dead, the old man is dead, the boyfriend is dead and the movie simply ends. Unfortunately not fast enough and the viewer is left wondering what they could have down with the 90 minutes they have wasted watching this waste of good celluloid.
The one good thing I can say is thankfully I got this movie as part of the Vine program so the only thing I wasted was time. Whew! You owe me big time Ms. Swank!",1305331200,24,2279,4.480769230769231

Unfortunately, the stellar cast is wasted in what comes off as a pretty generic story. A young doctor who is trying to piece her life back together after a nasty break-up with her fiance finds what may be the perfect apartment to call home. To top it off, the owner, a man named Max seems like the perfect guy to help get over her failed relationship.

Just as the new relationship begins to gain momentum, Juliet begins to regret leaving her fiance so quickly, and realizes she still has feelings for her former boyfriend, and she ends her budding relationship with Max. As I'm not into spoilers, I'll just say that Max doesn't like the idea of Juliet renewing her old relationship, and goes off the deep end.

While the film is well made, and well acted, it simply fails to deliver. There is really no suspense and anyone who is a fan of this genre will see where the movie is going about five minutes in.

She soon finds a too good to be true apartment when she realizes it is too good to be true when she starts hearing weird things in the night and seeing things in the shadows.

By the time we learn who is in the shadows; we quickly rewind and re-watch the first half hour through another set of eye which is even less interesting the second time around and adds too many plot holes in it.

Even though ""The Resident"" runs just under 85 minutes before the ending credits, the film seemingly manages to cram in every major horror-thriller-stalker-flick clich in the book and then some. They've got it all:

--The attractive, emotionally-vulnerable urban professional!
--The new, handsome too-good-to-be-true neighbor!
--The mysterious ex-boyfriend!
--The creepy old man down the hall!
--The heavy-breathing, faceless peeping tom!
--The supportive African American best friend!
--The clanks, the thuds, the billowing curtains, the gasps!
--The constant, cranked up eerie music!
--Not one, not two, but three partially nude bathroom scenes!
--The different-perspective flashback!
--The grainy security/home movie footage!
--The seemingly immortal ""why won't he just die!"" villain!

If designed and played like an homage to B-movie horror films, even with such a talented cast, this may have been enjoyable. Yet it tries too hard to be serious, with a rather sad desire to feel original and give you chills. But it fails with its over-the-top clichs, its unresolved back-story, its unused supporting characters, its generic camera angles, and its brief (thankfully, brief) running time of less than 90 minutes. I was disappointed to find that the incredible Christopher Lee's role was little more than six lines in a sort of extended cameo. And while Hilary Swank is as charming and intense as always, I cannot help but scratch my head and wonder why she'd frequently run around semi-or-fully naked for a movie like this one.

4336331,3,B004EC5IWU,"No one could be more excited when the news that Hammer Studios was rolling back into existance and already had two feature films in the pipelines for release in 2010!  While my excitement has wained since, but still there, and for good reason.  Frist is The Resident, a stalker thriller that got a very limited theatrical release despite the fact that Oscar Winner Hillary Swank is the star.  Their second release was a remake, EEEEEKKKK, of a brilliant film called Let the Right One In, the remake being called Let Me In.  A remake and a standard stalker thriller?  Interesting choices, but where's the gothic horror I yearn for?  I guess I'll have to wait for Tim Burton's and Johnny Depp's collaboration on the feature film version Dark Shadows.

Okay, now this film has so many good things in it it's hard to knock it too hard.  The acting is all top notch.  Swank is convincing as a surgeon and as her stalker's unaware victim.  Unfortunately, her character is only defined by her job and the fact that the love of her life has cheated on her, and forced her to move out and find a place to be on her own.  Yeah, there's not much of a character written here.  Luckily, Swank is a charismatic enough presence to fool you into thinking you're watching a fully developed human being.  She's quite likeable and instantly garners the viewer's sympathy.  Then we have the stalker, played here by Jeffrey Dean Morgan(The Comedian in Watchmen).  He is good, but again is short shrifted by the screenplay.  His character's past is given to us.  A past of abuse at the hands of his grandfather, played by Christopher Lee, in a far too small and wasted role.  He just has to play charming and then switch into stalker and eventually into the motor of a conventional slasher movie cliche.  He's good, but not totally as menacing as you would need in the last moments when the film really starts to heat up.

The film is beautifully shot by Guillermo Navarro(a frequent collaborator of the brilliant Guillermo Del Toro).  It's just nice to look at, in that lived in and aunthentic way.  The production design feels mostly natural.  I mean, Swank's new place is huge and almost creepily gothic, but that's just something one has to expect in a film like this.  I would like to see the creepy apartment thriller film where the apartment complex is as ordinary as the characters, but I digress.  It's fast paced and edited well.  It's visually stimulating, but that's it.  All surface.  Not really that disturbing.  Not that surprising.

The only thing that really intrigued me with this this film is the first two acts' structure.  Without hint or preview the point of view of the film shifts from Swank's unknowing stalked to that of the stalker. Not completely Roshimon style, but the film suddenly decides to tell us, like we didn't know already, that the Jeffrey Dean Morgan character has been stalking and been in scenes featuring just Swank, like a steamy bath.  He peeps through holes.  He hides under beds.  He creeps through her apartment in the middle of the night, in through secret passageways....yeah, you've seen this all before.  I do give credit to one other moment that is played mostly off of Swank's face in the third act as she is looking at her home security footage to find Morgan molesting her.  It's a dynamic and horrifying scene well performed by Swank and truly disturbing.  The only really disturbing scene in the whole film.

Yes, it's predicatable but not insulting.  It's not original, but not too common of a genre that it's totally tired.  The acting is top notch and it's visually appealing and manipulative like all good thrillers/horror films should be.  So, give it a rent and check it out.

Finally, the blu ray itself is totally bare-bones.  Not even a trailer makes an appearance.  The film and Navarro's brilliant cinematography looks great on blu ray, but I would've liked some interviews or behind the scenes stuff, or even a featurette about the return of Hammer horror.  Oh well.  At least they got the sound and picture right.

PS: Is it just me or does anyone else out there in la-la land think Hillary Swank's sexy?  I don't hear it often and I must admit that I never really thought about it, but I really think she is.  Maybe it's all the masculine roles she has become famous for, but I'm noticing her now and think she has a truly unique beauty.",1303776000,2,4387,4.642392717815345
4336332,2,B004EC5IWU,"This is your classic ""B"" grade peeper movie with high priced actors. Hillary Swank plays an ER doctor looking for an apartment. She finds the idea place with a good looking landlord. The drawback is that Christopher Lee also lives there. The movie then shows you blurred views of Hillary naked from camera angles that make you think she is being watched. It also makes good use of shadows and noises to add to the effect that someone is in her apartment. Unfortunately this doesn't last long as the peeper/creeper is revealed way too soon, and it is not Eric Roberts. The movie short changes us on the nudity/sex scenes normally in a B grade movie and opts to give us some groping. They attempted to create a first class peeper film, but fell way short. I can't believe Hillary Swank isn't getting better movie offers.",1303603200,2,818,4.609589041095891
4336333,4,B004EC5IWU,"The first three-quarters of this film are suspenseful and somewhat innovative. ""The Resident"" attempts a sort of Rashomon-like recursion from different points of view.

First we see life from Hilary Swank's character's point of view. She's a busy ER Doctor who responds to an ad for an improbably large, inexpensive Victorian apartment unit in New York. From the start, she's a little suspicious of what lies behind the complex, creviced spaces in the old building. She's a little unsettled by the atmosphere of the place and the things that go bump in the night.

Then the film figuratively rewinds and we see the same progression of events from the stalker's point of view, from the point of view of the person who is in fact creating those unnerving little rustlings from the rafters, from behind the lathes of the apartment. We see how he originally crossed paths with the Doctor and how he launched his campaign to ""get"" her.

It isn't a radically different perspective, but we catch more subtleties of angle and expression the second time around. The stalker, who comes across as being simply so handsome, so charmingly self-effacing in the first reel - expresses a more dangerous intensity in the re-play. We catch the flash of cold appraisal and calculation that crosses his face when Hilary Swank's back is turned. We understand the level of his peeping, peering obsession better.

Although this situation is hardly novel in the suspense/thriller genre - these lead actors are so beautifully caressed by the camera, it would be a pleasure to see them in any context, acting out the flimsiest of plots. There are some beautifully sensuous nude scenes included as well.

Unfortunately, the last quarter of this film turns into utter clich, betraying much of the film's early promise.

SPOILER - SPOILER
In that last quarter, the stalker turns predictably ulta-homicidal and the film devolves into a gory, blood-sport combat between stalker and Swank - with Swank displaying her Million Dollar Baby fighter's fitness in the fray. Once, just once, I would have liked the stalker to turn out to be not quite so mad - and for him and the object of his affections to get together and live happily ever after. Now THAT would have been innovative. I almost thought this movie might break new ground in that direction. Too bad.",1302912000,9,2326,4.905852417302799
4336334,2,B004EC5IWU,"Although Hammer Films is normally associated with horror, this film might best be described as a suspense/thriller. Without giving away any plot details let me just say that the mystery angle of the film is spoiled early-on by the revealing of the protagonist. Then we are basically just watching to see when Hilary Swank's character catches on to what we already know. The great Christopher Lee is sadly only in the film all too briefly and is not given much to do. Hilary Swank and Jeffrey Dean Morgan are both good but are limited by the poor script. Hilary Swank seems to spend a lot of time undressing and bathing. This is probably one of the most interesting things about the film. It seemed to go on for much longer than the running time of 91 minutes. It would have been much better suited to an episode of an hour-long t.v. series than as a feature-length film. I felt more than a little disappointed and let-down overall. As far as Hammer Films goes I much more enjoyed Let Me In and Wake Wood.",1302134400,2,1004,4.491803278688525
4336335,5,B004EC5IWU,"Hilary Swank (11:14, INSOMNIA) is the RESIDENT of the title, plagued by a man who grows increasingly creepy and dangerous. This film fits right into the same sub-genre as FATAL ATTRACTION, THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE, SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, ALONE WITH HER, etc., in that someone who appears ""normal"" slowly reveals their darker, homicidal side. Ms. Swank is no worse in her role as unwitting target than any of her predecessors. She adds a certain dignity to the character. Christopher Lee makes the best of his tiny role. THE RESIDENT has thrills, suspense, and just a bit of mystery. I loved it...",1302048000,,600,4.834951456310679
4336336,5,B004EC5IWU,"I loved this movie, though if your living alone, it may make you think about what kind of landlord you may have and if you get a really good price on rent, than you may just want to be aware of that.  It started off in the typical way, a young professional woman looking for an apartment, the landlord seems innocent, you may even think it's the landlords father who is the culprit, but in that case as the movie moves through you start to see just how the landlord lured and planned certain things and yes he is strange, obssessed, and creepy for a normal looking guy, but than it all unfolds, he is jealous of the boyfriend and now all hell breaks loose.  Resident is a great movie and very entertaining.",1301702400,4,706,4.3007518796992485
4336337,3,B004EC5IWU,"How can you protect yourself from what you don't see.  Juliet (Swank) is looking for a new place to live and gets a call about a loft in the city.  The seemingly perfect place and landlord are just what she is looking for.  Soon after she moves in she suspects she is not alone, and notices strange things happening to her.  This is another movie that is hard to talk about without giving anything away.  This is not really a horror movie so much as a creepy stalker movie, along the lines of ""One Hour Photo"".  The things the stalker does to her is enough to make you cringe.  He doesn't do sadistic things in the strict sense of the word, but sitting and watching her sleep and running his hands barely over her body from an inch away is pretty creepy.  Without trying to say too much, the main aspect of the movie isn't finding out who the stalker is, but watching as she learns who it is and her reaction.  Without Hilary Swank this movie would have been a straight to video disaster.  With her it gives the movie a legitamate feel and deserved a wider realease then it got.  This was not a great movie, but it is certainly well worth watching.  I give it a B.

Would I watch again? - Yes, I think I would.",1301616000,,1210,4.208695652173913
4336338,4,B004EC5IWU,"This movie went straight to DVD in the U.S and only recently opened in the U.K. Most of the U.S. reviews have ranged from fair to terrible and while I can understand that, I don't agree with it. I think THE RESIDENT has a lot more to offer than it's given credit for. Is the film predictable? Of course, most ""women in peril"" films usually are from the basic set-up to the inevitable conclusion. Is it suspenseful? Not as much as many thrillers I can name but then I don't think that's the main point of the film. It's more about a portrait of perversion done in the style of the classic M and the (reviled at the time) British horror film PEEPING TOM than standard thrillers like THE ROOMMATE or PACIFIC HEIGHTS. In other words, it's creepy.

The basic scenario is as follows. Single female rents a too good to be true apartment and then has cause to regret it thanks to a psychotic individual who has designs on her. Nothing new here but the way it's handled in THE RESIDENT I found more far more unsettling than in most of the films in this category. THE RESIDENT is extremely well crafted from the editing and the camerawork down to the eerie and effective score. The script doesn't probe deeply into psychological issues but as voiced by Hilary Swank, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and the 88 year old Christopher Lee, it kept me engaged. Another plus (or maybe not depending on your POV) is that it has a very high ""ewww"" factor.

THE RESIDENT also reminded me of some the classic Hammer ""mini-Hitchcocks"" made during the 1960s and early 70s like DIE DIE MY DARLING and CRESCENDO both of which star Stefanie Powers who Swank bears a superficial resemblance to. Christopher Lee makes the most of his limited scenes, but it is Jeffrey Dean Morgan and his portrait of the disturbed landlord that gives THE RESIDENT its resonance. He starts off like Anthony Perkins in PSYCHO and winds up like Glenn Close in FATAL ATTRACTION. The scene where he brushes his teeth with Swank's toothbrush I found as chilling as anything else in the film. But that's only one of the many disturbing things he does. While the ending is rushed and formulaic, it's to be expected in a glorified B picture which is what THE RESIDENT is.

This is only the third film to be released by the newly revived Hammer Films. LET ME IN, the remake of the Swedish vampire film LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, garnered mostly positive reviews but tanked due to mismarketing and a backlash from fans of the original. WAKE WOOD, a film similar in nature to THE WICKER MAN, has already come out on Region 2 DVD. Although all three carry on the Hammer tradition of quality films on a limted budget, they are having trouble finding American distribution which is what killed the original company in the first place. The remake of THE WOMAN IN BLACK with Daniel Radcliffe which is scheduled for release later this year should not have that problem and will hopefully be the hit that Hammer needs to have.",1301443200,2,2947,4.546139359698682
4336339,4,B004EC5IWU,"THE RESIDENT is an okay, rather creepy thriller that is given a touch of class by having Oscar-winner Hilary Swank in the leading role.

 The plot structure is reminiscent of SINGLE WHITE FEMALE (1992), as well as other ""women in jeopardy"" movies.

 Having broken up with her cheating boy friend, Swank, a New York emergency room doctor, moves into a spiffy renovated apartment in a very old building, and soon has the feeling that she is not alone.

 She isn't, but that's all I'm going to tell you about the plot because I don't want to be a Spoiler.  Let's just say that we learn the culprit's identity fairly early in the proceedings, thus for the remainder of the film, we're hoping that Ms. Swank will find out what we know before it's too late.

 Directed by Antti Jokinen and co-starring Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Christopher Lee, the final twenty minutes of this one will wreak havoc on your fingernails.

 THE RESIDENT is from Hammer Films, released onto DVD by Image Entertainment.

4336340,3,B004EC5IWU,"THE RESIDENT is one of those very well made (directed by Antii Jokinen), well photographed (cinematographer Guillermo Navarro), well scored (music by John Ottman), well cast films that just doesn't manage to get off the ground.  The idea for the film is OK but the script written by Robert Orr and director Jokinen is so slim that the film could have been a successful short: everything you need to know is in the trailer.  A thriller it is not, but the people in the film are so attractive that much is forgivable.

Hard working ER Doctor/Surgeon Juliet Devereau (Hilary Swank - who also is executive producer here) is bruised by a broken relationship: Jack (Lee Pace, well remembered for his role in 'A Soldier's Girl') betrayed their relationship. Juliet needs a change and looks for an apartment in New York City, eventually finding an affordable gorgeous space being renovated by owner Max (Jeffrey Dean Morgan, handsome and charismatic).  Max is strange but pleasant and goes out of his way to please Juliet.  Max lives in the apartment house as does his grandfather August (Christopher Lee), and when the emotionally vulnerable Juliet is attracted to Max, Max is the one who shuts down. But the chemistry has begun and Max spies on Juliet, stalking her, making videos of her in bath, obsessing over her etc.  Juliet meanwhile reconnects with Jack, a fact that motivates Max to change the direction of his approach to Juliet.  What follows is a series of strange incidents that the audience will know about ahead of time and the ending just sort of happens - without much suspense or caring from the viewer.

Swank is up to par in her professionalism and both Morgan and Pace are interesting to watch. The film has some nice effects and the cast is attractive  and maybe that is enough for a no-brainer film.  Pleasant but non-involving. Grady Harp, March 11",1300579200,27,1864,4.796875
