The New Car (original airdate Oct. 2, 1958). Grandpa's late for a date with Flora and it's up to Pepino to deliver the bad news -- the family's 1930 jalopy is on its last wheels. Everyone wants to trade it in, but Grandpa won't hear of it -- the car is part of the family. But, after several more breakdowns, he's forced to give in. Luke and Kate head for San Fernando Harry's used car lot and make what Luke considers to be a great deal. But when Grandpa discovers his beloved jalopy is headed for the junkyard, it's up to Luke to salvage the car and save the day.

Sing For Your Supper (original airdate Nov. 13, 1958). Luke has found his passion -- singing, even when he's not in the bathtub. But he can't sing a note and he's getting on everyone's nerves. Determined to appear in an amateur radio contest, the family thinks it's a hoot, especially Grandpa. At the station, Luke is gripped with stage fright and rushes his song to get it over with. But the teenagers flip over his new singing style and he ends up winning by a landslide. Fame is not for Luke however. He's happier just singing for his family, much to Grandpa's chagrin.",1125619200,,1172,4.371559633027523
