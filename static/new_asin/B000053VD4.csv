7930235,1,B000053VD4,"I assume this video, and in fact this series, is intended for a young audience interested in learning about nature. I would strongly advise teachers and parents to look elsewhere than in any of the Steve Irwin ""Crocodile Hunter"" series.  As a retired biologist and natural historian, I tell you this man and his colleagues are a menace.  This video, ""Crocodiles of the Revolution"" catches some of the most irreponsible and cruel animal ""documentaries"" I have seen. Our male co-host is a ""showboater"" and huckster who cares far more about creating lively footage than in being humane to the animals. It is the handling of the second, male, crocodile that is simply beyond the pale.  It is done in an utterly irresponsible fashion, with well over a hundred laughing, excited people around to further render the ""croc's"" move a semi-donnybrook.  Good action scenes, but stupid, dangerous animal handling. The risk here is that young people will think this is a proper way to go about handling and moving animals. There are many other great nature series for kids.  To learn >and< be entertained, kids deserve intelligent documentaries just like adults.",1016409600,4,1149,5.026315789473684
