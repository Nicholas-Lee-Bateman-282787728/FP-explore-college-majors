8377809,5,B002QH59OM,"Years ago I was browsing Grapevine Videos catalog when they stated ""if you ever wanted to see a real flapper film from the roaring 20s, this is it"". They were not kidding. Virginia Lee Corbin is the definitive flapper. Trust me, Clara Bow finishes a distant, distant second. It is Ms. Corbin's short skirt and bare knees that give the movie it's title. She has a playful sexiness that will win your heart. She has some funny and snappy replies that I wish I could have heard instead of read. Tame by today's standards this film is the best representation of it's era I have ever seen. The basic story is the whole town is turned upside down by the arrival of Ms. Corbin, who comes to the small town to visit her sister. This is a nice print without too many breaks or fuzziness. I am still confused why this film is not better known. TCM should show this on their silent Sunday nights instead of some of the silents that they show over and over and over. I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It is worth more than they are asking.",1331510400,8,1037,4.350515463917525
