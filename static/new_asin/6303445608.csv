8530064,1,6303445608,"Everyone who is a fan of the VW Beetle knows of its Nazi sponsored origins.  This video explores this aspect of VW history further.  The most amazing thing is that it criticizes VW for not being fully willing to put its horrid origins on display and tell people of the horrible events in the Nazi controlled factory during WWII.  VW, for its part, would rather focus on the Beetle's role in putting Germany back on the map, and giving people all over the world a chance to own a car at a time when few could.  This video is NOT a history of the Beetle, it is a expose on the car's Nazi origins.  And it's subtitle (seen only on the screen) ""Heil Herbie"" is a bit tasteless and unnecessary.",1020643200,5,689,4.269230769230769
8530065,4,6303445608,"This video is for Beetle owners who are interested in more than bright colors and chrome. Its the story of the Volkswagen Beetle, from Hitler's ""Peoples Car"" to Americas Love Bug.",947030400,8,179,4.806451612903226
