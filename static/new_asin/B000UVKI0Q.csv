8215100,5,B000UVKI0Q,"This is one of the most amazing movies you will ever see if you want to understand why the Mexican revolution took place.
El Principio ""The Beginning"".  The title says it, it is the start of why Mexicans went up in arms against the abusive government and rich people.
It is a strong movie, strong language, stronge scenes.  Not a movie for a teacher pretending to teach spanish to teenages.  A movie for thinkers.  A movie for historians.  A movie for filosophers.

Very impressed with this work.  Standing ovation to the producer.

I started to preview it, and actually had to stop watching it. It was way too violent and graphic for anything I would watch, much less show my students. I do show R rated movies with parental permission when it seems appropriate, but I would suggest that this is beyond what would be acceptable in high school.",1350432000,,463,4.658536585365853
