8009567,5,B0001BH49S,I must confess I am always worried about buying used DVD's. I am very happy with both the speed in which my purchase arrived and the quality of the dvd itself.,1350345600,,159,4.161290322580645
8009568,5,B0001BH49S,"This short film is a wonderful glimpse into the career of Maxfield Parrish. A few rare looks at his home, The Oaks, before its destruction was a delight, as was seeing parts of his studio. I also found watching his son, Max Jr., talk about his father to be a brief but personal aspect to this film that I really appreciated. This film is a nice supplement to the more in-depth information you can find in the books by Parrish historians, Coy Ludwig and Alma Gilbert. For me, this DVD was well worth the money.",1345420800,,509,4.368421052631579
8009569,5,B0001BH49S,"While the footage is from older film sources, it is well edited. It shows exactly what its title suggests: the fabulous dark blue color, often found in the crystal clear skies over Vermont and New Hampshire, which was captured by Maxfield Parrish (1870-1966) in his illustrations and paintings, very popular in America in the early part of the 20th century.

Interviews with Maxfield's son and with the painter, Norman Rockwell, add a considerable amount of legitimacy to the DVD. The DVD is not inexpensive, bur since I'm Maxfield's relative, no price is too much.

Many of his works are located in the Cornish Colony Museum in Windsor, Vermont, truly worth a trip when you are out that way. His ancestral estate, ""The Oaks,"" is located just across the Connecticut River in Plainfield, New Hampshire. It is now a private residence. Mt. Ascutney in Vermont, visible from the grounds of the estate, often served as a model in many of Maxfield's works.

If you are interested in Maxfield and his works, this DVD sheds light on the prolific and innovative artist that he was. His works are, as far as I'm concerned, unsurpassed, even today (November, 2007). They portray a romantic view of life, even a fanciful one on occasion.  ---Doug Parrish",1195603200,7,1242,4.872037914691943
