2483466,3,B000E1P2C6,"A well-presented if shallow look at the history of film censorship. It left out many important details, such as the 1915 Supreme Court ""Mutual"" decision that declare movies were not protected by the First Amendment and cut be banned or cut up by local censor boards. It was the number of ruined prints return to Hollywood that was the reason Will Hays was instated at the chief censor in the first place. It also ignored the 1952 ""Miracle"" decision that gave First Amendment protection to movies and set up the downfall of the Hayes Office.

The documentary also downplayed the role of the church throughout the history of censorship. It was the influence of clergy that led to local censoring, it was a Catholic layman and a Jesuit priest who actually wrote the rules on the 1934 code, and it was the boycott power of the Catholic League of Decency (CLOD) that forced the studios to hire Breen to enforce the codes. It should have been noted that Breen became power mad and bullied studio heads when he could.

Finally, it would have been nice if credit had been given to the directors, particularly Otto Preminger, and United Artist who released hugely successful pictures the did not get the Breen Office seal. Preminger eager went head to head with CLOD and used their condemnation to help promote his movies they objected to. He also fought local censorship boards in court who tried to block his films, and he won. With courageous directors like Preminger, Billy Wilder and even Hitchcock to some extent""Psycho"" broke down several barrierswho skirted the code and made a lot of money, they encouraged other filmmakers to do the same. By the time Jack Valenti took over the MPAA in 1968, the 1934 Code was irrelevant, and the creating of the ratings system was the only way to get back some control over production.

There... now I just taught you twice as much as the documentary should have covered... and in only the time it took to read my review. Now, the old footage was fun to look at, and I loved hearing from these film legends they interviewed, but it would have been nice to actually learn something I didn't already know.",1455321600,10,2138,4.680851063829787

Then people tested the limits and did something like show a breast and the movie got banned! Movies have come a long way since then. Now we have pornography and nobody thinks a thing of it. I must admit our society has gotten way out of hand compared to the 1930's, The people back then had morals and decency. Then it got corrupt. There was a couple of films in there of Shirley Temple and she just died last year (or this year). But, she was quite the little actor and was a great dancer. There were a lot of movie stars in there that are and were famous and was interesting for me to see because my parents all watched that stuff but I do remember a lot of the cowboy movies.

Mamie Van Doren comments how her films High School Confidential, and Girls Town were condemned. Also the story of Jayne Mansfield's death, because she was covering a club date for Mamie, and how it might have been her. I have met Mamie and she is so nice to her fans.

2483555,5,B000E1P2C6,"There's a perpetual popular axiom among the layperson that the media is left leaning, or that Hollywood is also the same, and it's controlled by leftest elements.  Well, sort of.  The truth of the matter now is that Hollywood is under a different kind of tyranny, the one of social mental health.

Films, as they were first generated in history, were reflection of mankind's experiences, and then evolved to tell stories.  Stories that later on involved our psychology.  With that there came the need to be more edgy to show so called honesty or to keep people tantalized so they would come back for more.  Ergo films became more risque to the point where the conservative faction of society touted outrage at scenes that may have elements that suggested sexuality of all kinds, or excessive violence.

It was a long road for films to get to where they are today, and, one must ask, are they better for it?  This piece itself doesn't take much of a stand on whether films have improved, but does allow the subjects that are interviewed to express their personal thoughts and feelings on the topic.  Various sexual iterations are addressed, various degrees and avenues of violence are also scrutinized in a history of film making vein.  The Hays' code is looked at, people who knew the former post master talk about him, and the ramifications of the code itself are spoken about.

Then the film looks at screen sirens like Jane Mansfield and Marilyn Monroe, and looks at their roles in society and how their relationship with film, society and those interested in putting social controls on society.  Early films of young children mimicking the bawdy behavior of adults with childish innocence shocks some people today.  Me, I saw those short films on KTVU during cartoons, because they were seen as children's films; i.e. a farce or satire of adult behaviors.  Looking at them through so-called adult eyes, we get a bit of a shock at all of the possible connotations that might otherwise be extracted from those films were we anybody else but a child.  Partial nudity in edits of films for the foreign or overseas market actually for once look pretty contemporary from the 21st century.  Films about forbidden or sacred man-beast relationships in the darkest regions of Africa or elsewhere are, well, just stupid.

But those were the issues as films evolved.  Being primates we often imitate the behaviors we experience or see.  That includes behaviors we see in movies.  Therefore today censorship has a different kind of tyranny.  We are no longer protected from images that might shock or offend us, but are veered away from behaviors that that we may want to imitate.  Therefore censorship is still alive and well, but has a different kind of code, and a different emphasis.

Sex in the film was treated as a fascinating taboo that everyone wanted to know more of, but were scared to acknowledge because of the social alpha dogs with their own sense of morality fearing for their fellow man's behavior, and, in turn their own safety from behaviors they disagreed with.  Simply put, are you, your son, your wife, or your neighbor, going to be turned into sex fiends by seeing a naked person (usually a woman), or two people engaging in a passionate kiss, or, to ratchet it up even further, engaged in sexual intercourse on the movie screen?  Admittedly some may.  But, will everyone?  If not, what percentage?  And how will it affect your social circle, namely your town?

That's the thing missing from this film.  It doesn't look at the deep issues of why, just the outrage which it uses as its springboard to look into the episodes and trends in historical censorship in Hollywood.  It also addresses mostly fringe films as the exceptions and trend busters, but tends to ignore the thriving so called ""adult film"" industry around at the time.  It hits upon the popular public personalities, but seems to veer away from why the film makers challenged society in the first place with the very films they made.  One might argue that there is a student and teacher relationship going on with film makers and their audiences.  But one is given to wonder if both parties know their roles.

There is still censorship today, but the concepts tend to be more in the vein of social policies.  We have films of all kinds catering to all kinds of tastes and desires in terms of sex and violence.  But few, if any, in regards to national identity.  We have films about zombie invasions, but none regarding a nation rife with drugs, violence and corruption at its very core.  We have films that allow fringe society to engage in idiotic behaviors with the underscore by the social mental health types saying it's okay to engage in those behaviors because they don't hurt anyone (National Geographic did a piece on people immitating vampires, right down to sharpening their fangs and drinking blood), but have no films showing why those behavior are dumb ideas to begin with.  There are lots of films on how it's okay to be who you are, but no films showing the consequences of actions.

And perhaps that's the only point the film missed.  For all of the arguments over censorship, the film itself doesn't take a look at cause and effect, nor does any extrapolation on human behavior and correlation.  But, then again, that wasn't its thrust.  It's merely a simple film looking at the evolution of censorship, films and society through those who were there and witnessed it first hand.

For that alone, give it a whirl.",1375833600,3,5509,4.770855332629356

Hollywood Uncensored chronicles the history of how people have tried, with varying results, to get the motion picture industry to remove violence and $exuality from their films. The film has two co-hosts, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Peter Fonda. We also get extensive interview footage with several prominent people from the world of motion pictures including Martin Scorsese, Mamie Van Doren, Jane Russell, Eli Wallach and others. There is archival footage of Jayne Mansfield and Marilyn Monroe as well.

We first learn about how Hollywood would do just about anything they wanted to do despite the fact that former Postmaster General William Hays enacted a ""morals code"" as early as 1922. However, that code was not strictly enforced; and especially when in the late 1920s movie attendance fell sharply, the movie studios threw in anything and everything they could to get the public to come back to the cinemas. We see some footage of Barbara Stanwyck using herself to get ahead in a company; and we also see some very rare footage of Shirley Temple from a 1933 film entitled Polly Tix In Washington. Shirley isn't exactly playing the purest of little girls!

The public eventually wanted a little more ""calm"" in their movies. In fact, there was enough public support for The Catholic Church to organize a ""Legion Of Decency"" and Will Hays hired Joe Breen to personally approve all films before they could be shown in theaters.

We then see how in the 1950s and 1960s things loosened up again; but on the other hand there were even more changes that had and still have a huge impact on the motion picture industry.

Overall, Hollywood Uncensored is a good film that documents the rise and decline of the Hays Code. We see some of what came before the Hays code and after it as everyone, Hollywood producers and studios included, tried to control what Hollywood could put in their films. I highly recommend this film for people who are film aficionados; and people who enjoy how movies reflect the hearts and minds of the public will enjoy this documentary as well.",1237248000,23,2493,4.959232613908873
