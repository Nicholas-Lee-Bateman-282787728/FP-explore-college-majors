8361745,4,B002BO2RX6,"This is another DVD that I have with Barry White singing live in concert, from 1990, and it features 2 music videos with Barry White singing. It is known that Barry White passed away on July 4, 2003, and this DVD with Barry singing live in concert brings back memories of him as a great singer. I would also play his music from the albums, and Barry's music still lives on.",1419811200,,373,4.267605633802817

8361747,4,B002BO2RX6,"For fans worth seeing. The sound is very good. But the picture quality is blurry on distance.
Only close-ups are halfway scharf. Blasse color.
With age.
Since there is nothing better of Barry White are, nevertheless strong buy recommendation.",1390953600,,242,5.230769230769231
8361748,5,B002BO2RX6,words can not say enough about the master! I play this DVD every time I get. it keeps you in the grove,1371686400,3,102,3.6818181818181817
8361749,3,B002BO2RX6,"I wasn't sure if I should buy this dvd. As a first minute fan of Barry, I know all the concert footage available, so this was a gamble. It is the concert footage of a Belgium concert. Not bad, but it's all we got from the master himself. Sound is alright and image could be better. If you want a concert footage of his last years on the road, this is the one to buy.",1336867200,,366,3.8933333333333335
8361750,4,B002BO2RX6,"The video is basically just a section of Dane followed by Clay. Since they are two of my favorites to watch on video, its a cool contrast to the cleaner surfing Dane does versus Marzos lip whipping snaps (fun to watch).

This is a shorter video, maybe 30 minutes or so but every clip is quality. Soundtrack is decent but not all that inspiring, for me, definitely dropped it down from a 5 star rating. They mention other surfers but its hardly even worth mentioning guys that just have one or two waves in the video. Overall, its been a nice addition to my video library and its definitely one that gets consistent play.",1260576000,3,620,4.43859649122807
