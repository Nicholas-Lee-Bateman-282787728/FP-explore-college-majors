5985536,5,B00FERST4S,I did not know Bates had so much family. Brings peace and redemption to the scariest one night stand ever known.,1414108800,2,112,4.380952380952381
5985537,5,B00FERST4S,It's a cammpy classic! for any Psycho fan!,1405468800,4,42,4.375
5985538,5,B00FERST4S,"Yes loved it, I saw it on video in 1989. Been looking for it ever since",1405123200,,71,3.5
5985539,5,B00FERST4S,Omg! I love this movie! I can't wait to order this so I can watch it whenever I want. Yeah,1398384000,,90,3.55
5985540,1,B00FERST4S,"Don't bother to buy this movie.  The original movie was great compared to this TRASH!!!  Please don't waste your money,",1385424000,,119,4.9
5985541,1,B00FERST4S,"Evidently the series this movie started out as a pilot for was an attempt to exploit ""Psycho II"" and ""Psycho III"", which came out during that same time frame. And to add insult to injury, you will notice on the product page that they burn you a copy upon ordering, and we've all heard how some players can balk at playing homemade DVDs, how you should get an extra $59.95 cheapo player and jack it into whatever spare AUX port you might have on your TV for such discs. Not to mention that the ones you burn yourself in a computer drive don't last as long as the factory-made ones. Anyway, if you're going to watch made-for-TV ""Psycho"", better stick to ""Psycho IV"", which at least sticks to the backstory rather than just being ""based on characters from..."", yadda-yadda. The ""threefer"" containing everything but ""Hitch's Mothership"" is in my Shopping Cart, to be ordered for next month. I'm all done waiting for my VHS machine to eat my ""taped from the air"" copy of IV.",1384473600,3,969,4.542857142857143
5985542,4,B00FERST4S,"This 87 TV pilot movie is a good follow up to Psycho II which I think was a great follow up from the original. The III movie was good but
too much gory violence and sex which was not needed. The IV TV movie was horrible except for Anthony Perkins. This movie has a
good plot with Norman's cousin returning to his house and all sorts of mysterious things happen. The ending is very good. And sorry
but it's 100x's better than the newer series which is nothing like the original movie. If your a fan of the original movies then get this one.",1383091200,,539,4.1923076923076925
5985543,3,B00FERST4S,"If you're thinking about 'blind-buying' this and are not sure what it is, I suggest you don't.
First of all, this is not the current TV series 'Bates Motel'. It's a 1987 pilot of a TV show that attempted to spin off the Psycho Movies. I assume it was released because of the interest generated from the current TV series of the same name and the recent Scream Factory releases of Psycho II and III on Blu-Ray.
I used to work in a VHS video rental store and watched this once back in the day, and thought I would revisit it here.
The Bates Motel Pilot is more of a 'haunting ghost story' rather than a slasher storyline.
Bud Cort plays Alex West, a psychiatric patient who inherited the Bates Hotel from Norman Bates after he passes away in a mental institution. Add an annoying offsider by the way of Lori Petty that hangs around like a bad smell and the producers thought they'd have a good TV show.
Had the pilot been picked up, it seemed to be a 'Twilight Zone' show of sorts. I also assume it was supposed to follow the 'guest of the week' formula of storytelling as per the pilot: a guest stays at the Bates Hotel, they would face their demons and there would be some supernatural resolution by the time they checked out. Continuity isn't one of the shows strong points - the show doesn't fit into the Psycho continuity as by the time Psycho IV is released, it clearly ignores the events of this pilot as Norman Bates is alive and well in that movie.
As for the product itself, a MOD DVD-R, the video and sound is pretty good. I guess anything from the official source is better than the many bootlegs floating around out there. My only regret is the cover design that they chose for the DVD - some people will of course get confused with the current TV series and the original painted VHS cover of Bud Cort holding a hotel check-in book with 'UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT' stamped across it was pretty good.
Still, for Psycho completists like me, I'm just happy to own this one on DVD.",1383004800,23,1983,4.3621621621621625
