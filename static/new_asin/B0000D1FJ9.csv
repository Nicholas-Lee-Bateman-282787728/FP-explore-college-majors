1920519,5,B0000D1FJ9,"I am a TRUE big brother addict, and owning this season was only natural for me. I really wish BB2 was on DVD I would buy that in a second!!
I ordered the 'free shipping' that was going to take 2-6 business days and expected to see the package in the mail next week. I ordered the DVD set on a Sunday and received it 3 days later on the Wednesday.
I've been watching the first disk and so far I'm super impressed.. a little bummed that it's censored, and a little bummed that they don't have more special features or deleted scenes, but it's totally worth it for me as I love the show so much.
I'll likely buy the BB4 dvd when that comes out too.
One of the disks was loose when I opened the packaging but they were all alright, no scratches.
I recommend it for any TRUE big brother fans. :)",1074643200,4,790,4.07051282051282
1920520,5,B0000D1FJ9,"This DVD is a must have for any Big Brother fan! I missed this season, and only started watching as an addict for BB4, so to be able to watch BB3 is amazing! I loved this DVD and watched it non stop whenever I had free time for the past 3 days and finally completed it, it's amazing! The only problem I had with it was the advertisements for Survivor: Thailand and The Amazing Race on the last few episodes, but it's not that annoying, definetly wouldn't hold it against this DVD and not buy it because of it. Definetly buy it, it's worth every penny!",1073692800,4,551,4.2075471698113205
1920521,5,B0000D1FJ9,"Season 3 was one of the best of the Big Brother Series.  (I also loved Season 2 with the ""evil"" Dr. Will).  I'd forgotten alot of Season 3 - Amy & Marcellus, Chiara & Roddy, Lisa & Eric, Danielle & Jason... and good ole Gerry.
The fighting, the loving, Amy leaving then returning, Marcellus and his decision with the Golden Veto, Danielle and her comments in the Diary room - I loved all of it and was saddened when I finished watching it again.
The only ""extras"" are the audition tapes of the contestants.  Interesting but I wish there were more ""extras"" such as comments from the House Guests or Julie Chen.  Maybe the producers will add more on the next Big Brother DVD release.  (Hopefully they will release more).
My biggest beef is with the packaging.  I received the set with several DVDs loose inside their jewel box.  A friend of mine received her set with alot of scratches on the DVDs.  Instead of having each DVD attached inside, two DVDs ""share"" the same space, one an inch or two down from the other.  The ""top"" DVD on each side is supposed to hold down the other one but comes loose so they both rattle around.
Another thing - I've noticed Amazon has raised alot of their prices and this is no exception.  I bought BB3 here when it first came out and paid $49 for it but now it is selling for
$62.96.  Ouch!",1069027200,56,1322,4.333333333333333
1920522,4,B0000D1FJ9,"I purchased the set from the CBS site, being an avid Big Brother fan. Though I am very glad to have the entire season, and I can re-live all the moments of the best 'Big Brother' to date, I do have some criticisms, particularly with the last disc in the set. The disc is quite clearly Volume 9, though the spine of the case reads  'Volumes 6-8.' At least two of the episodes near the end of the season were not re-edited for the DVD, because you will still see CBS insignia reminding you to watch Survivor Amazon in one week. All that aside; the BB3 DVD is worth the money, especially if you were a fan of all the quirky houseguests. Cheese, beer and a ceramic lawn gnome named Boo.",1067644800,13,682,4.206106870229007
1920530,5,B0000D1FJ9,I love to watch Big Brother on television from CBS. Big Brother is one of my most favorite television shows of all time. I would definitely recommend watching Big Brother on DVD. Amazon.com carries some of the Big Brother past episodes on DVD. I am going to purchase as many as I can possibly get a hold of.,1347926400,,307,4.310344827586207
1920531,5,B0000D1FJ9,"Seeing as the price for this set now hovers around $50 for the cheapest copy (including shipping), I was a little frightened to spend that much money. The set is nine discs, with four episodes per disc, which is an entire cycle: Eviction/HOH, Nominations, Veto, Veto Meeting. I had forgotten that the veto competition and the Veto meeting were different episodes in season 3. One really nice thing is that as soon as you put the disc in, it goes straight to the menu. There isn't that five minute thing that most DVD's have, with FBI warnings and such. The show appears to be exactly what was broadcast, so that settled my fears. If you are a fan of Big Brother and can afford the hefty price, now that it's out of print, I'd say go for it. The packaging isn't perfect, as the other reviews mentioned, but beyond that I don't see a flaw. If this season and the clip-show version of Season 4 are all that we get, then I'll take what I can get. Even if the price is a little higher than I'd like...",1337040000,,996,4.303191489361702
1920532,5,B0000D1FJ9,"I just love BB3, it's for sure my favorite of all to date!  Also, it's just great to go back and see reality TV from this time, it had something back then that it's lacking now.",1333670400,,177,3.9166666666666665

1920534,5,B0000D1FJ9,Big Brother 3 was by far my favorite season.  I didn't care for the outcome but everything leading up to it was great.  The best competitions that BB had.,1262995200,,154,4.275862068965517
1920535,3,B0000D1FJ9,"If you like BB USA and have not sean this season this dvd set is worth a buy.

Three plastic cases hold nine disks which contain thirty two episodes. The disks can slip free in the plastic cases during transit.  The plastic cases come in a less than sturdy cardbox box.  For the most part the packaging is attractive and it does not reveal who the winner is.

The extras are cast interviews from before they went into the house.

The episodes are presented for the most part I would imagine as originally aired.  However there are a couple of obvious edits.  At the end of episode 14 host Julie invites viewers to come back for (more?) news of an exciting twist after the break.  Sadly the screen fades to black and the disk goes straight to the main menu.  This happens on about 5-7 episodes.  I think there might have been some interactive viewer option during these missing segments but as they were a part of the programme they should be included.  During the last few episodes we get a few on screen banners informing us that Survivor: Thailand starts in a few weeks.

Also, the ending credits are missing for every episode.  The last disk has a feature where some very poor end credits are on offer which do not even have any music playing.

When you put the disk in your machine the disk goes straight to the main menu (there is no FBI warning) which gives you option to select an episode to watch as the theme music plays.  There are no play all, subtitles or audio options available.

The picture quality is very good and I would have given 4 stars if it was not for the pointless edits on a few episodes as mentioned.",1211587200,3,1627,4.373333333333333
1920536,5,B0000D1FJ9,"Big Brother three is most likely the best season to date. The secret domination of the angel and the devil (Jason and Danielle) provided some of the best moments of Reality TV. I can not imagine not having this DVD set. I watched it through twice since I got it (earlier this year) and it never gets old. All-Stars was great, but this is the show in its beginnings. If anyone mildly likes Big Brother, than I am sure they will love this. This season is what got me hooked on Reality TV. Humor and alliances, romance and strategy, this season has it all. Even if you've seen it before it's worth watching over and over again. Just think: you can watch this season whenever you want for the rest of your life. You've got to buy it.",1165795200,3,729,4.2898550724637685
1920537,5,B0000D1FJ9,"This was definitely one of the best big brother seasons.  Amazon's price is very high and I bought the same thing on Overstock for half the price.

My only question is why is season 3 the only season released on DVD?  It doesn't make sense.  Does anyone know the answer to this?

Thanks.",1153267200,,287,4.339622641509434

1920549,4,B0000D1FJ9,"This was a good Big Brother season with lots of interesting characters and a lot of unexpected twists.  It ranks just below Season 2 with evil doctor Wil(which strangely has not been released).  Though it contains all 32 episodes, there are no extras aside from audition tapes.  It would have been nice to get commentary, or updates on the people.  Or they could have given uncensored bits.  Still it is worlds better than the abbreviated version of Season 4.  The packaging is not the best and there is a good chance the dvd's could come loose in transit.  Also, the Amazon price is crazy.  I got my set at Overstock for just over $20.  Hopefully they release the other seasons.",1150329600,7,679,4.591666666666667
1920550,5,B0000D1FJ9,"My favorite part about this season was Amy coming back!! The worst part of the season was Tonya being evicted over Josh. Those are my favorite and least favorite part of BB3. There were more good moments than bad in this season. Here they are

Good:

Lisa won.

Jason came in 3rd.

Josh didn't make it farther than a lot of people.

The bikini contest.

Bad:

Roddy winning HOH and putting up Amy who was eventaually evicted.

Ciharia hating Amy.

Marcellas coming in 5th.

Gerry taking Marcellas off the chopping block with the power of veto.

Those are just some of the good and bad. I really could not think of any more. But I will tell you you will probaly hate Josh or Ciharia",1148256000,,681,4.368
1920551,4,B0000D1FJ9,"I had NO idea what to expect as I had not seen any USA version of Big Brother before. It took a while to get into the rythm of the show on DVD (as the pace is a bit slower than Amazing Race or Survivor), but after the first disc (of nine) I enjoyed it immensely and fell in love with all the wonderful personalities in the house. I would have loved a ""where are they now?"" section on the DVD, as I really do wonder what happened to all of them and if some of the couples are still together. As a fan of reality TV, I highly recommend this release.",1137283200,5,547,3.892857142857143
1920552,4,B0000D1FJ9,I love Big Brother but I have some questions for anyone who can help me out. First is this the american version? And second is this uncensored and/or uncut? I hope someone out there can help to answer these questions I don't see that it says either in the synopsis or information. Please help?! Thanx,1135900800,,300,4.472727272727273
1920553,1,B0000D1FJ9,"Let me clear something up first - this isn't aimed at THIS particular version of Big Brother. Hell, I'm from the UK so I won't even have SEEN this. Not that I watch ANY of Big Brother or any of it's charmless, cheap TV knock-off counterparts.

But it doesn't really matter. Who needs to have seen this particular series - it's all the same, full of phony, desperate, loathsome idiots out to become famous for doing absolutley nothing. Without watching this, I can predict that

a) People will fight and argue for NO REASON AT ALL.

b) There will be an extrovert (probably gay) housemate. Or more than one (if recent UK versions are anything to go by).

c) Two people will fumble around under the bedclothes with each other in a tired attempt to become a household name.

Well, was I right? I bet I was, because this format of program has become so jaded, cynical and worn out that you can almost predict what's going to happen, what the newspapers are going to salivate over the next day.

Big Brother is the epitome of scum television - TV aimed at people who don't have either the patience or intelligence to watch a real program, (you know, one with a plot and actors and stuff). These people, these scum - can't watch a program without wanting to phone in and vote someone off.

Worse than people who watch (and talk about) it? The people who buy the DVD's. Yes, you too can own a version of attention craving morons sitting around in a house. These people, who's names you will forget in three weeks time, will entertain and delight you in totally forced, ""oh, is the camera on me? I got naked and they SHOWED IT???"" antics.

If this sounds like your sort of thing, may I suggest three other things you may need in your life? A nice, sturdy wooden chair, a solid hook in the ceiling above you, and a lovely big noose. As a great man once said - you might as well kill yourself, you're already dead.",1133395200,,1903,4.386363636363637
1920554,4,B0000D1FJ9,"Join Amy, Marcellus, Danielle, Gerry, Jason, Roddy, Chiara, Lori, Tanya, Eric, Lisa, and Josh on a three month adventure had right inside the confines of the Big Brother house. There are annoying houseguests, houseguests you can't help but love, and tons of fighting and scheming.

This season, the houseguests had a surprise visit from Sheryl Crow, the introduction of the Power of Veto, and the first season to have an evicted houseguest return to the house.

You might be thinking that once you've seen the season, you won't want to watch it again. Thanks to the way the show is put together, that is not so. Not only will it not matter that you know who won the game, you'll revel in listening to conversations knowing the outcome. Each time you watch an episode, you'll probably pick up on bits of conversation you never noticed before, making the season much more rich than before.

This DVD comes with sparse extra features, but what is included is great. We get to see the audition tapes of the houseguests.

I must complain that this was the first and only season to be fully released on DVD. Season 2 was the best in my opinion, and SHOULD have been released prior to this one.",1130025600,3,1187,4.611374407582939
1920555,5,B0000D1FJ9,"I am baffled as to why CBS has only released season 3 as a complete season set and none of the other seasons of BB before or after, but this definitely was a great season to watch. There were some very memorable characters, including one of most well-known houseguests to come out of the show, Marcellas.

So what is there that makes Season 3 worth watching? We saw one of the most successful and secretive alliances of BB history. One of the steamiest romances to ever happen in the BB house took place during season 3. There was also an annoying Dr. Will wannabe who thankfully didn't last too long. Which brings me to my biggest question to CBS - why Season 3? If you're going for historical value, Season 2 had arguably one of the best BB players ever. A man who was hated by the houseguests managed to stick around until the end, then gave one of the most offensive final speeches ever, but still managed to get enough votes to win the game!

Anyway, if we can't have season 2, then season 3 is probably the next best thing. If you missed it, it's definitely a season that every BB fan should see.",1128729600,5,1102,4.344660194174757
1920556,4,B0000D1FJ9,"The only reason I gave 4 stars on this is because of that annoying Marcellas being on this season.

If there was a way to delete him from my TV screen, I would be happy.

Great season, otherwise.",1126137600,,195,4.105263157894737
1920557,5,B0000D1FJ9,"Big Brother 3 is the best season of them all, with many varied houseguests and a lot of standouts (Amy, Marcellas...) and this DVD is great to relive the moments again and again since this season originally aired in 2002.

The DVD is decent. The only special feature is some footage from the producers interviewing each houseguest which disappointed me cause I was hoping they would show the ORIGINAL tapes that the houseguests sent in to CBS.

The packaging is the weakest. The box isn't very sturdy and a plastic cases holds four discs. The box would be smaller and less cheap if they used individual slit cases (like FOX uses) and put two discs in each.

Overall, a great buy.",1124755200,2,679,4.595041322314049

1920559,5,B0000D1FJ9,"I have not bought this dvd yet but I LOVE the show. In this show they get a group of people in this house filled with cameras (duh!). Then each week there is a head of household (HOH) who gets this title by winning the HOH challenge. the same person can not be HOH twice in a row. Once the person gets the HOH they get their own room and have to nominate two contestants for eviction. The nominees do have a chance to get a veto in the veto challenge which forces the HOH to put someone else up in their place. In the end there will be 2 houseguests left. The last 10 houseguests voted out of the house will vote for who deserves to win and the winner gets $500,000. This has got to be one of the greatest reality shows around!!!!",1122336000,,730,4.041379310344827
1920560,1,B0000D1FJ9,If you've already watched the 3rd installment then there's no point in buying this DVD. It does have many extra's but nothing worth raving over.

1920561,5,B0000D1FJ9,"I ordered this after painfully sitting through Australia's Big Brother season one, then half of season 2 then about three seconds of season 3!  The US Big Brother is SO much better it's like two very different types of shows.  Ours is so dreadful it's gob smacking.

I pray that the powers that be at Channel Ten open their eyes and watch this.  Their ratings might improve if rather than picking the majority of house guests as moronic 19 year olds with no vocal capacity, no personality and no IQ... they took a page out of the USA Big Brother book and picked INTERESTING guests of various back grounds and ages.  Doh - wouldn't this be obvious!?!?!?

I PLEAD - please send the USA producers to Australia pronto.  We need all the help we can get!

Oh by the way - Roddy is a honey and I enjoyed this dvd box set so much I have friends addicted to it now!!!",1103587200,6,858,4.285714285714286
1920562,1,B0000D1FJ9,"What good is a DVD set with only the first 4 episodes?  I assume the others will come out later (or not, if this one doesn't sell), but then we have to spend MORE money.

The reviews for the Big Brother 4 DVD indicate that Season 4 is only 2 discs, featuring highlights only.

Why can't CBS put out a COMPLETE SET of at least ONE season?  Also, don't they realize that the true fans want everything?  That includes ALL the episodes AND some uncensored clips as well.",1094688000,13,466,4.25
1920563,5,B0000D1FJ9,"I was thrilled when I found out that CBS was releasing this DVD set, because BB3 was the best cast ever assembled for a TV show.  I liked the mix of people, the conflicts, the twists, and overall friendship among the house guests.  I rooted for Roddy to win, followed by Jason.  I loved the comedic talents of Danielle, Roddy, and Marcellas, though I don't agree with Danielle that Roddy was ""the devil"".  This season offered memorable moments, like Amy coming back into the house after two weeks in Mexico and how her drinking drove her housemates mad, Eric talking in his sleep, witty and whiny Josh, the ""stripper mascarading as a mother"", Marcellas and his beloved gnome named ""Boo"", Jason and Danielle's well kept secret alliance, Eric and Lisa's romance, Jason getting nervous over a massage, Sheryl Crow's surprise concert, and more...Lots of great moments for any reality tv show cast, and well deserving of being released on dvd.  Since BB3 aired, I haven't liked the cast of BB4 or the current BB5 cast.  I think the show hit perfection with #3.  Other reality show casts I like are: MTV Real World Hawaii, MTV Real World New Orleans, and MTV Road Rules Australia, and Survivor: The Australian Outback.  I wish they would release those on DVD too.  But I doubt that anyone will ever assemble as great a cast on any reality show as BB3 was.",1089763200,18,1349,4.658227848101266

It is very entertaining watching it for my 2nd time and catching things I missed the first time on TV.  Watching the sneakiness, manipulations, and the friendships of all these people make it so much fun to watch. My favorite houseguests are Danielle, Marcellas, Jason , Amy and Roddy. But I find all of them Characters like on a sitcom. I did not care for Big Brother 4 as much as the first 3 shows. It was just too boring.  I like it better with a bigger range in ages.  I think it should be 3 people in their 20's, 30's, 40's and 50's. Mix it up more.  Not more people in their 20's and 30's.  Just My Opionion though. But back to Big Brother 3.

Right up with Survivor The Australian Outback, Top Shot season 3, Anderson Cooper's The Mole and the first season of The Amazing Race, this show was nothing but perfection. A cast that delivered many great people, excellent relationships reaching all kinds of areas, emotions of all levels, great competitions, blindsides, deals, humor, great pacing, stars that landmark the show, very deserving finalists and a winner to be proud of.

I really cannot praise this season anymore then I already have. I loved it from start to finish. Even people I had issues with at times all redeemed themselves both in the show and for me. I loved the intensity as the cast dwlindled and am extremely happy at the results.

If you have not seen this season you do not know what you are missing and if you manage to be able to view it, get viewing this gem of a show.

Now about the final decision. I really did love the winner, while there were times Lisa did fly low, I think possibly one reason we think that is, because she won the first HOH we expected more of her. I felt she a great job of allining herself and making her decisions. However it is slightly dissapointing for Danielle and Jason to loose their control right at then end, they played it so well. But it wouldn't have mattered, Danielle wouldn't have beaten Jason. So they are the true stars but Lisa was always a favorite of mine and as long as it was the three of them, I'm not complaining.",1360800000,,1651,4.7456445993031355
