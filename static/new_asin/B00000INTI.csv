7911169,5,B00000INTI,"My first contact with this movie was in 1987 after I had rented it on VHS when I was 20 years old. I've never forgotten the great action scenes. In 1998, through the internet, I found it for sale and I imported it to Brazil, where I live, for the amount of US $ 9.09. Despite the fact that the story is not interesting, the scenes and images become unforgettable for anyone.

The film had been released on DVD just in the year that I acquired it from the virtual company DVD Express, whose invoice I have until today. In Brazil many movies on DVD were delayed to be released - Deadly Encounter never appeared here, except through the old VHS tapes. Deadly Encounter was one of the first that I imported at that time precisely because of the quality of the action scenes.

In 1999 I started taking the helicopter private pilot course, but I did not do the practical classes because of the high cost of flight time here in Brazil. I've always found helicopters very interesting, but today at 50 the dream of flying a machine like the Hughes 500c was in the past, without possibility of realization. I liked these movies so much that my email was christened with the name of this helicopter model -hughes500c.

I was surprised by the value that the DVDs of this movie are being sold, but I understand that the lack of it in the market and the quality of the images have raised the price of the product too much. If anyone has posters, shirts or souvenirs from the Hughes 500c helicopter or the Deadly Encounter movie, please contact me. Obviously my will was to have a Hughes 500c helicopter or fly in one, but here in Brazil, according to information, there is none of this brand.

At that age I can only dream and see the Hughes 500c through the DVD Deadly Encounter. Thankfully I bought it before its production was extinguished.

I look forward to hearing back from Hughes 500c Helicopters. Can anyone tell me who the copyright to this movie is with incredible images of constant action? Because they are no longer selling on DVD would be the case if we suggest that the producer to sell in BluRay 1080p or UHD 4K, including these various extras on the actors, including the pilot Glenn Miller, who died tragically during filming. It would be very interesting to include several information about this film, including as a tribute to Glenn Miller and the other two occupants who died in the fall of the helicopter.

I have the DVD of 1998 from Pacific Digital, whose final credits brings only the inclusion of ""In Memoriam"", in relation to the 3 people who gave their lives during the realization of this excellent film. Note: THERE IS NO MOVIE OF HELICOPTERS WITH SO MUCH CONSTANT ACTION LIKE THIS. Larry Hagman and these people deserve the relaunch of this film in a complete BluRay because never again will be produced an excellent helicopter film like this. In 1998 I was very lucky to choose to import this movie through the internet, otherwise I would not have seen it directly from a legal media -DVD. Thanks to Pacific Digital for having made this film available on that occasion.

Today it would be interesting to re-produce it in high definition. I will wait and hope that this will happen. I suggest that if this movie is sold again in Bluray, other languages will be introduced on the disc, besides English, since the film also happens in Mexico - some scenes. Brazilian dubbing - Portuguese - in most films is considered of excellent quality and with voices very similar to those of real actors.",1501804800,,3509,4.578025477707007
7911170,5,B00000INTI,"A sequel to the 1973 movie ""Birds of Prey"" with David Janssen, Larry Hagman is featured as the protagonist who saves an old wartime flame from the wiles of mobsters. The plot is predictable, but let's forget that for a moment...because it's easily forgettable when you see the helicopter flight footage. It's amazing! Once again featuring the nimble Hughes 500 and the impressive Aerospatiale Alouette II (this time, two of them!), and introducing the Aerospatiale Gazelle as well, the next cat-and-mouse chase adventure takes place in sunny Mexico. But this time, the protagonist lives, with a little help from his friends he's tried to distance himself from for years, as well as their WW2-era biplanes. Again, the action will make you overlook the plot. It's that good.

Also, of sad note: shortly after the finish of filming, the Hughes 500 owned and flown by Glenn Miller (who also had a role in the film) crashed in an Arizona canyon when it struck an unmarked cable running across. He and two others were killed, only one survived.",1454457600,,1038,4.8977272727272725
7911171,3,B00000INTI,"Someone please tell me why this DVD is priced well over $100? I handled the Extras for this movie here in the Tucson area. It was a fun movie to work on with the exception of the terrible accident that happened with the downed Helecopter in the Page,Arizona area. Larry Hagman was terrific to everyone. I recommend this movie but would hope that it can be found for a reasonable price.",1353888000,3,385,4.436619718309859
7911172,5,B00000INTI,"I've been looking for this movie for a long time and the couple I have found were $100.00 plus for some odd reason. The price was great here and the picture quality was excellent for an older VHS movie. Even though it was VHS, I just transfered it to DVD so I won't have to worry when there are no more VHS players. I'm a helicopter nut and this was a real fix for me. Thanks.",1229385600,3,376,3.960526315789474
7911173,5,B00000INTI,Absolutely phenomenal helicopter flying in this movie!  I am a helicopter pilot and I take my hat off to the pilots performing the sequences in this movie.  A must for all aviation enthusiasts and other flying nuts.  Mediocre storie line - but worth getting.,1102723200,7,258,4.818181818181818

I've seen this movie many many times, since I was a little boy. My dad is a helicopter pilot and he taped this movie on new year's eve, so he could see in the other day. Awesome, because I don't see any DVDs available so far. With it's storyline shifting between the US and Mexico, Sam Hooten (Larry Hagman) pilots a Hughes 500 series helicopter. He an ex-army pilot who now flies on his own. The story is pretty simple: Sam must protect an old girlfriend (Chris Butler, played by Susan Anspach) - who married a rich gangster - from other gangsters, flying her from USA to Mexico City. The great thing about this movie is the helicopter scenes; with amazing maneuvers and a lot of dogfighting. The movie gets to it's climax when Sam and Chris find themselves trapped by the gangsters and call Sam's old army buddies for help. This movie is worth watching because of the helicopters and planes. A real good classic.",1090022400,7,920,4.514970059880239
