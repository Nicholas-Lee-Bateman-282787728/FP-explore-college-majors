831287,5,6304285116,"Great story that depicted the life of John Gotti...done excellently by John Gotti, even has some of your other typical mobster actors in the movie...LOVED it!!!",993340800,,160,5.1923076923076925
831288,5,6304285116,"Gotti was an extrordinary movie that captures my attention more every time I watch it.  Knowing mafia history, there are a lot of things that happened in the movie that did not happen in the real life saga of John Gotti.  With  that aside the movie and its actors were wonderful.  Assante and Quinn were  made for these parts, and Forsythe was not bad himself.  As far as an actor  that can play a mafia role, Assante is up there with the likes of Deniro  and Pesci.",954806400,,466,4.275862068965517
831289,4,6304285116,"I'm generally biased against HBO movies, due to uninteresting storylines, but a film like this (mostly shot in Toronto, but you'd never know) gets top marks for some great character actors, and a solid script.  I agree  that it tends to favor John Gotti, as stated by one of the earlier reviews,  but hey--the film isn't called 'Underboss', now, is it?  Armand Assante  proves himself to be one of the most underrated actors of our time, and  Anthony Quinn is mesmerizing, as always.",935193600,,483,4.759036144578313
831290,5,6304285116,"Excellent because of it's reality, this movie takes you to John Gotti's life.  He was a New York gangster who was a chief in the Gambino family.  Seeking fame, John Gotti arranged the murder of the head of the family, and  didn't hide it from the public.  Assante accurately portrays Gotti in his  2,000 dollar suits, avoiding the government, helping the needy, and  gathering a community to stand behind him.  Loved by all, John Gotti was  ratted out by Sammy Gravano, excellently portrayed by William Forsythe.  Great direction and acting.  Harmon shows the struggle of the FBI and that  of the mafia, and their similarity.  Portraying Gotti as no one ever has,  this video pleases the mind because of it's reality.  A few years ago, you  may have passed John Gotti on 79th street.  This is a movie about a real  person, and that is what makes it great.",922320000,2,855,4.630872483221476

831409,2,6304285116,"The movie comes across as a sort of apologia for John Gotti, presenting a highly sanitized depiction of the late mobster. It seems any heinous crimes committed were done by his underboss Sammy Gravano without Gotti's knowledge.

According to this movie Gotti didn't even have anything to do with the murder of his neighbor John Favara, who accidently ran over and killed Gotti's son Frank. In fact, they have Gotti pleading with Gravano to leave Favara alone because it was just an accident.

At one point in the film Saint... er uh... John Gotti is even shown pleading with his mob associates not to use ethnic slurs because we are ""one world, one people"".

It's a ridiculous movie.

The slim, soft spoken Assante is poorly cast as the Gotti, who in real life was chubby, inarticulate and foul mouthed. Assante doesn't really convey much in the way of personality in the movie. The actors who played Angelo Ruggeiro and DB (both were later on the Sopranos) would have been better choices to play Gotti.

William Forsyth as Gravano does the only decent acting here. Anthony Quinn's depiction of Neil Dellacroce as a wise and kind grandfather type is almost as ridiculous as Assante's depiction of Gotti as a soft spoken saintly man stunned and surprised by Gravano's crimes.

It's worth watching - once - only because the subject matter is so interesting but it's not a good movie.",1464912000,,1381,4.781512605042017

Acting is boring, dialog is horrible. Interesting though how
many of the actors went on to wonderful careers and other
Mob related films/ TV series.

just a typical thug killing mobster. The same characters you've seen in other great mob movies are here so the cast is very good as well as the

831663,5,6304285116,Anthony Dennison and Tom Sizemore have both played John Gotti in movies and miniseries but no one captured Gotti better than Armand Assanti. HBO has a reputation for making excellent movies and they certainly hit the nail right on the head by casting Assanti as John Gotti. In less that two minutes into the film you are left believing that Assanti is Gotti. This five star hit is a definite must for every movie lovers gangster section,1421712000,,436,4.675324675324675

831743,5,6304285116,"I am a big fan novels and movies of the Mafia and other well known gangsters of the 20th Century in America and Canada. I don't look for totally accurate details,but like them for mainly entertainment. Sure,the Underworld was secret to some degree,evil beyond imagination,filled with interesting characters,but above all,it was real and had a major impact on particularly the seamy side of life. I am also a fan of the Old West,from after the Civil War till the turn of the century. Generally ,the characters from that period were Irish who ,to a large extent, were shut out from society and to survive ,or simply to take what society refused them,turned to crime. However,they were small time crooks and desperados compared to the Italians who replaced them at the beginning of the 20th Century in North America. While in the Old West these outlaws were individualists and highly unorganized;the Italians came from a society of criminals that had many years of highly disciplined,brutal and family historyin the old world . In other words they were secret and organized.
  This movie is well put together,has good storylines,action,and actors portraying real characters. It is history told in much the same way as life in the South is told in ""Gone With the Wind"",or movies about the the James Brothers,Wyatt Earp ,Al Capone and The Untouchables,and other movies about the Mafia,,The Godfathers,etc.
 I think there is something different about this movie though. What we are now witnessing is a big change taking place in the makeup and practices of the underworld and criminal activity. We are now seeing the eclipse of the Dons and Mafia Families. Immigrants of the past have had their day and are no longer shut out of society ,thus having  to resort to crime,but now are assimilated into society.
 Is this to be the end of crime,either organized as in the 20th Century or disorganized as in the last half of the 19th Century? Not at all,It is festering from the segments of society that are shut out and by the latest immigrants coming ,not from Ireland ,Italy etc.,but from Mexico,South America, Muslim Countries and South East Asia.
 The criminal world will continue but will be radically different,of that,it is certain as day follows night.
The thought that will remain from this movie is this;
 ""Five to ten years from now ,America will yearn for the days of Organized Crime""
 This was stated clearly in this movie made in 1996. That is nearly 20 years ago,Gotti passed away on June 10 ,2002,still in prison,and the Crime scene is certainly changing.",1413849600,2,2560,4.909722222222222

832016,5,6304285116,"Based on TV shows I have seen like Mobsters and others this movie matches up pretty well with real events.

It's interesting how certain events happened at particular times to allow this story to unfold the way it did.

The FBI had bugged the talkative and aptly nicknamed Angelo 'Quack Quack' Ruggiero's house.  Those surveillance tapes contained statements about how John 'Jonny Boy' Gotti's crew was selling drugs and how much they hated Gambino family boss Paul 'Big Paul' Castellano.  Gotti's friend and mentor Aniello 'Mr. Neil' Dellacroce tried to delay turning the tapes over to Big Paul since he knew this would be a death sentence for Johnny Boy.  But then Dellacroce died.  At that point Gotti had to take action against Big Paul or get whacked himself.  But Johnny Boy probably wouldn't have done this while Mr. Neil was still alive.

Salvatore 'Sammy the Bull' Gravano  is portrayed as a very greedy and untrustworthy person who would kill anyone for money.  The movie captures the atmosphere of mistrust and high stress and fear that is part of the mafia life.  All of the murders committed by The Bull added to Gotti's paranoia and deep sorrow as he had to face the horrible reality of what he had become a part of.  Pictures of people in the mafia sometimes convey the extreme negative energy reflected in their faces.

There was a strange event in Gotti's life where his young son was struck and killed by a car that was driven by his next door neighbor.  The neighbor wasn't able to move out of town fast enough.  This was an accident however and it doesn't seem like this guy should have been subjected to Gotti's murderous wrath.

The movie at times portrays Gotti as a beloved public figure and media darling where people want his autograph, shoot off fireworks when he is found innocent in court, etc..  I'm not sure how accurate this portrayal really is though.  People should be careful about who they want for their heroes as Colombia found out when they idolized Pablo Escobar.

The casting is good for this movie.  Some of the actors actually look like the real people including Gotti, Dellacroce, Sammy The Bull, and Quack Quack.

A possible sequel or related movie would be about Anthony 'Gaspipe' Casso.  Gaspipe was given the assignment to whack Gotti after the Castellano hit.  Gaspipe went off the deep end after Gotti's boys tried to whack him in return.  Gaspipe Casso became so violent that the mafia guys started turning to the FBI for their own safety.

It was I guess excessive violence and greed that took a major toll on La Cosa Nostra.  Gotti's love of the public spotlight and media attention didn't help either.  John Gotti was probably one of the worst things that ever happened to the mafia.

The entire 20th century in America was in some ways a struggle to get control over criminal elements and corruption.

832071,3,6304285116,"First of all, let me begin by saying that I do realize that this movie is based on a true story before I say what I am about to say.

When it comes to mafia/ gangster movies, it's OK but not really great like Casino, Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco, Bugsy, or the ultimate benchmark, The Godfather. I'll probably only watch this one a few times and then it will sit there occupying space on my shelf.

I have noticed that there is great overlap between Gotti's character and several characters in the Godfather movie... Joey Zaza (the flash mobster), Frank Pantangeli (the rat), and a few others... I think these characters are somewhat typical as they either really happened or seem expected in any gangster movie.

WARNING: The DVD box is so flimsy that mine broke while trying to unwrap the plastic! I wasn't very forceful, I noticed that the box was very light and had already read the other reviews about the box (it seems others have faced the same problem) and yet it still broke almost in half!",1307836800,4,996,4.553072625698324

At one point in my cinematic enthusiast life, I tireless attempted to watch very great mob movie ever produced: The Godfather Series, Goodfellas, Casino, and so on.  This movie is in the same ballpark as all of those.  Although less known, this movie is certainly of great quality.

Armand Assante plays John Gotti, a real-life gangster in the Gambino crime family in New York City.  This film examines his rise to power and fame and the fall to imprisonment and betrayal.  The story is captivating to say the least and will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout.  Definitely one of my all-time favorites, and it was even better because I paid less than 6 bucks for it.

If it did now, Armand Assante, I promise, would've got nominations because his performance was outstanding. He played John Gotti as charismatic as possible. It starts from where Gotti already has his own crew, to the hit for Carlo Gambino's nephew that got him recognized from the big guys, Paul Castellano's reign, to his involvement with Castellano's demise, his reign, and downfall by the testimony of Sammy Gravano. Will say that I've heard the real John Gotti on FBI tapes from documentaries and he wasn't this kind as portrayed, but everything else was accurate as possible. Except for stories of his childhood, if you watch this movie you won't ever have to watch a biography on him again because it's all here. Please buy it!",1294617600,3,844,4.7482993197278915

Gotti is a good earner and is very close to Neil Dellacroce, the number two man in the family. When Carlo Gambino dies however, his decision to make Paul Castellano the head of the family doesn't sit well with Gotti and others. They all put up with it for several years but eventually, Gotti gets fed up with Castellano and has him killed, making himself head of the family in the process. Gotti was the subject of several Federal investigations but always managed to be found not guilty, earning the sobriquet The Teflon Don. Determined to get a conviction, the FBI finally manage to get him on tape not only admitting to crimes, but speculating on how he might have to do something about his right-hand man, Dammy ""The Bull"" Gravano. When presented with the information, Gravano makes a deal with the prosecutors and testifies against his one-time friend who is sentenced to life in prison without parole. ""Gotti: The Rise and Fall of a Real Life Mafia Don"" is a exceptional movie from the start to the very end.

832113,2,6304285116,"Gotti (1996) (TV), is informative to the extent that it is able to
tell a string to facts about the unfolding of the Gotti story in
the 1980's and 90's.

Not being an scholar, taken at face value, a lot of what this HBO
production tells, is apparently accurate and factual.

For example, indeed, on Sep. 29, 1986, TIME magazine featured Gotti
on the front page.

Also, the testimony of Sammy the Bull is public, and as such, would
not require much imagination to weave into the script of this
movie the the script writer.

Also, a fair amount of detail seems to match what is seen in another
movie, Boss of Bosses starring Chazz Palminteri.

If there are weak points in the work, it would be the excess
swearing on camera, as well as the juvenile, introverted dialog
that is often shown on screen, as if Gotti was unable to see things
from any other point of view or angle, than his own. This is an
absurd notion, cheapening the fact that this was the leader of the
Gamino family, a major organization, and not of a high school
project or small fry association.

On the other hand, the legal implications of the underlying
operations runs by Gotti, are well demonstrated, in their
seriousness, definitiveness, and far-reaching potential, in
particular, of the RICO statutes in catching, convicting and imprisoning
alleged organized criminals.

At the end of the day, perhaps what did Gotti in, was his mass
media prominence, exposure and macro and micro influence in society
which threatened its integrity, risking creating millions of
negative copy-cat, non-compliant behavior of normal citizens, something
that could not be tolerated by the elite or by the majority at large.

On the other band, the recession of 2008 in the USA, economic
failures and  misconduct of Wall St. organizations and the
victims of the war in the Middle East, ( since the turn of the
decade),  is  as serious, if not more, than  organized crime,
yet ... gets a free pass simply because the integrity of society is
not at risk, nor does running the printing presses with fiat
currency, and indebting future generations (who have no voice
today) result in  any protests today.

In sum,  the movie's script is somewhat shaky, by making the
success of Gotti seem too easy, too juvenile, too simple, taken for
granted ... as if anyone who is trigger-happy is only a step away from
making a million dollars when that is anything  but the case. A
street killer with  a pistol does not a millionaire make.",1225411200,,2476,4.72093023255814

832119,4,6304285116,"This HBO flick is highly recommended for overall quotable value, good laughs, some good acting, and some good laughs.

Was this film written by a Gotti family member?  I don't know where to begin.  Suffice to say that the film is not nearly the sum of its parts.  There are some good scenes, some good acting by Assante as Gotti (why hasn't Assante been in other mob flicks or even on The Sopranos?).  Anthony Quinn, who needs subtitles, is not bad as Neil Dellacroce, who dies of that mysterious movie illness where the character gets old and coughs a lot before checking out.  And of course, we have any number of Wiseguy Acting Guild members, such as Sopranos actors Frank Vincent, Vincent Pastore, Tony Sirico, and Dominic Chianese.  William Forsythe looks nothing like Sammy 'The Bull' Gravano, and they make him the number one vilain in another of Forsythe's 'evil' roles.

Gotti is portrayed as a gangster, yes, but also as some kind of pre-capitalist who spews wisdom about the 'parameters' of La Cosa Nostra, about 'the rules', and importantly, about members of his administration who are 'talking subversive'.  He is not pleased with Gravano due to his underboss' greed and to the unacceptable amount of legit money being made.  What kind of gangsters are making this much legit money?  Gotti rants about libertarian values, rails against the hypocrisy of the government and about white collar crime, and even goes so far as to correct one of his underlings' racial epithets (always loved that one) before he himself launches a few.

As a realistic portrayal of Gotti, it's horrible, there's too much fiction, too many factual errors, utter nonsense being uttered by the characters, etc, etc.  But there's just a tremendous amount of quotable material, some great scenes, the requisite mob hits (apparently Paul Castellano was shot 50 times in slow motion) and a fantastic Assante hamming it up.  In 1998 a TV movie called Witness To The Mob appeared---an adaptation of Gravano's book 'Underboss'.  It's the perfect companion to this movie.  While Gravano is pure evil in this movie, in Witness, Gravano moralizes and Gotti is the man at fault.  And of course, some of the very same actors appear in both movies, only to die differently (Frank Vincent is shot in the head in this film before being blown up in a car bomb in Witness, his acting range fully explored).

Just can't recommend this one enough.  The writers must have been under contract from the mob or perhaps under threat from the mob, but the absurdity is part of the charm.",1144108800,3,2549,4.831797235023042

I don't understand why the makers didn't stick to the facts. It's not like the facts are boring. There a only two possible reasons for this: bad research and/or the romanticizing of Gotti. Gotti is made out to be the good guy. I know a lot about Cosa Nostra, I've read many books on the subject and I've seen video/audio tapes of John Gotti.

Thanks!",1123632000,,184,3.972972972972973
832195,4,6304285116,"Based on the rise and fall of mob boss John Gotti, the movie highlights the series of events that took Gotti through the ranks to the top of the Gambino crime family to include the hit on Paul Castellano, his aquittal in several federal indictments, the flamboyant style that captured the attention of the media, and the eventual testimony of ""Sammy the Bull"" Gravano that brought it all down.

Armand Assanti plays a convincing role and is backed up by a familiar mob type cast (i.e. Goodfellas, Sopranos).  Origionally an HBO made for TV movie, its not as commercially popular as Goodfellas or Casino are, but it's in depth look at the actual make up and lifestyle of probably the most notorious crime family make this one unique.",1116374400,2,732,4.7109375
832196,4,6304285116,"As we all know by the other reviews, this movie isn't 100% accurate. Other than that, it was a great movie! You can find it for $5 now, even! It's well worth the watch, plus this is a movie all mafia-fans should have in their collection! I would recommend buying this one!",1108857600,,272,4.25
832197,3,6304285116,"This movie focuses a LOT more on just the actual man John Gotti rather than all the affect he has. Armand Assante is very convincing and did an excellent job acting. However, unlike The Godfather, this is a REAL story. That makes it all the more fun to watch. It's definitely worth watching if you're a gangster movie addict like me

It's definitely no Godfather, but if you're looking for something new...give it a shot",1103846400,,420,4.6
832198,4,6304285116,"Whoever said that they DANG NEAR think that that is how Gotti was then they r wrong. You don't become the most respected and powerful boss of the Gambino crime family in this day and age by nickle and dime hustling.  Im sure he did 99% of what happened in the movie.  This is a great movie about how Gotti became who he was, and how he created the largest coppa regime in the US.",1096243200,,379,4.04
832199,3,6304285116,"It's a notable rise and fall of New York crime boss John Gotti a.k.a The Dapper Don.  The Dapper Don's rise through the ranks of the Gambino crime family, was first through the support of his mentor, and then through a bold ass assassination of Paul,The Gambino's current boss.

Gotti is the man...New Yorkers all love him!  He's changing the rules of the family, as well as making the news and the cover of magazines.  ""Man of the Year!""

Gotti's world comes crashing around him as his arrogance over beating the government on a rico charge, as well as his thirst for the limelight.

The Dapper ""Don"" is caught on tape revealing Sammy as a notorious killer.  I told ya'll men talk 2 much!  Loose lips Sammy gets up on the stand an co-signs with the man against Gotti!  Wouldn't you know it...mob underboss, reputed murderer steps to the stand and corroborates.

The Don is doing LIFE.....Fed joint in Chi~town

It was okay, not explosive...",1094688000,,941,4.642424242424243

I wish, though, that story of John Gotti could be shown through another film, with a different director, better acting, and (of course) a better portrayal of John Gotti and the Gambino crime family.  What I did like about this movie was the ending, the way they showed Sammy testifying against John and Franky.  I also liked the speech at the ending by Gotti.  Overall, don't expect another Goodfellas, but at least give it a try.",1093046400,,600,4.418181818181818
832281,3,6304285116,"Armand Assante is effective, William Forsyth doesn't quite match the part physically but still entertains, Anthony Quinn is almost dead on as Neil Dellacroce, and Frank Vincent once again shines. The pace is crisp, the directing edgy and the production from a technical standpoint is done very well. If you're looking for an engaging mafia movie, you'll enjoy ""Gotti"" immensely.
But if you want a biopic of John Gotti, look elsewhere. This movie would best be described as ""a movie inspired by the events of"" or ""based loosely on"" the life of John Gotti.
Factual errors are too numerous to count. The murder of neighbor John Favara is pure fiction; so is Sammy Gravano's execution of his brother-in-law, the meeting between Gotti and Gravano, and the circumstances leading up to Angelo Ruggiero's death (Gotti never visited him in the hospital, much less fed him a cannoli by hand). Still, the characterizations were mostly on the mark. I was, though, profoundly disappointed with the choice for Bruce Cutler, and thought the Castellano actor was a bit too gruff for someone known as the businessman gangster.
If you can manage to put aside the details of the Gotti story and watch this movie for escapism, it's worth the time.",1088467200,2,1227,4.932367149758454
832282,5,6304285116,"I am a big fan of mafia movies and have seen at least 20 or more Mafia movies and this is my favorite over the classic.  The lead actor does a great job playing Gotti and the other actors aren't too shabby either.  The story is mostly true and is great drama.  This isn't an action movie though, so don't expect gun fights and ect, but if your looking for a really interestting and compelling Mafia story I highly recommend you see this movie.",1080172800,3,443,4.25

I was very surprised! Well acted and very entertaining! If you like The Sopranos, 4 cast members are in this movie. Ok, this is Hollywood. They have to make the story better than reality and they sure did. If you are a fan of Mob movies you will love this one! ya Gotti trust me!",1076630400,3,453,4.101123595505618
832284,2,6304285116,"I give the movie 2 stars because  I think Armande Aassante did a decent job portraying Gotti (although he wasn't ruthless enough, I'm sure he just did what he was told) the guy who played Sammy G was good too but his height was totally off (the real Sammy was shorter than Gotti).  All that aside, the movie was complete fiction.  Although this movie painted a favourable picture of Gotti, I think Gotti himself would have disliked it because it was so off.  Major and minor facts in this movie are completely off.  A few examples..  This movie shows Gotti meeting Sammy when Carlo Gambino was boss, and Gotti went to Carlo's apartment where he met Sammy and was ordered to do the hit in retaliation for Carlo's nephew's kidnapping.  In reality, Sammy wasn't even associated with the Gambino family until after Carlo died..  before that, he was in the columbo family and he switched to the gambino family because of an internal dispute..  He was made under Paul Castellano, as was Gotti.  Aside from that, it would be highly irregular for an unmade man to meet the Boss at all, let alone at his house.. Unmade men are required to communicate with the boss through the made guy that vouches for them. Also, Sammy had only met Carlo once, and that was just briefly at a party.  Another major error was Gotti's relationship with Angie after Angie got caught on tape and brought major heat on his whole crew for the drug charges..  After that happened and Gotti gained power he wanted to whack Angie out, but people clsoe to Gotti strongly advised him against it.  Gotti NEVER went to see Angie in the hospital when he had cancer, despite the fact that he'd known him since they were kids.  Gotti took  away all Angie's power, and Angie died alone and with no dignitiy.  Gotti wouldn't have even gone to the funeral if other people in the family didn't drag him there to keep up appearances.  I think the real Gotti would have been angry with the way they showed his relationship with Angie, he told everyone of his discontent with Angie after the tapes.  There are many many major and minor fact and timeline glitches that make this movie frusterating to watch if you are familiar with the real events/timelines.  I see NO reason at all for getting these details wrong, it could have been ever more of an interesting movie if they would have stuck to the facts and put in different aspects of the story.  They could have shown more of the courtroom drama that  led to his ""Teflon Don"" reputation.  Some of the aspects of the trial Giacalone brought against him were really classic, and completely out there ... I could go on and on..  This movie is one case where hollywood has no justification for having their facts totally off.",1065484800,15,2727,4.565843621399177

Nevertheless it's got a good storyline...and the fact that it's based on a true story definitely helps.  If anything, Armand Assante carries this movie through, the other actors have done better in other movies, but I cant say I've seen Armand assante in a better role than this, he definitely made this whole movie watchable.  Truth is that the more you see the movie the better your opinion of it will be.  It's one of those that grows on you.",1060473600,4,629,4.539823008849558

832289,3,6304285116,"Chronologically, this film does a fine job of portraying events in the life of John Gotti.  As a biography, however, it is awful.  Gotti, by any objective measure an immoral thug who brought about his own demise, is portrayed in the film as a great guy around whom bad things are done by others.  Gotti, not Gravano, was responsible for the murder of the neighbor who accidentally killed his son.  To suggest, as the film does, that he was ignorant of the jury-tampering on his behalf that occurred during one of his trials is equally absurd.  In short, respect Gotti or not, the real man is nothing like what is portrayed in the HBO film.",995587200,,639,4.521739130434782
