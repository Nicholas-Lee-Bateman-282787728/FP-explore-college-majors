8201878,4,B000ROAMD4,"Jeff Speakman is a Kenpo Karate expert and not to bad of an actor its to bad that he doesn't get more action roles than he has of course sometimes the surprising actors are often ignored by Hollywood. It has a good cast with Robin Curtis (From Wrath of Kahn), and of course Robert Carradine (whom I enjoy) . I think its a good sci-fi if a bit cheesy at times but sometimes that happens with Sci-fi films. It does however have a good twist at the end, you'll have to buy it for yourself to see.",1412208000,,493,4.092783505154639
8201879,4,B000ROAMD4,"I bought this DVD for Scorpio One with Jeff Speakman, he is a Kenpo Master. Perfect Weapon this isn't, but still a good vehicle for Speakman to show his fighting ability. This was a fun movie....",1377993600,,195,4.444444444444445
