1048828,5,6305559295,"My kids really love Blue's Clues, but often had trouble with the fact that sometimes it was Joe, and sometimes it was Steve. We bought this video because it includes those transition episodes. They just love it! It has really helped them enjoy the show, and deal with teh changing of peoplein their lives here, especially therapists. The episodes themselves and the clue games are also particularly nice ones.",1141171200,,409,4.942028985507246
1048829,5,6305559295,"This a cute fun video and one of my favorite blues clues videos. I'm a home daycare provider. Over the yrs I have collected over 100 kids videos. Blue's Big Pajama Party seems to entertain my daycare kids ages 14 months to 5 yrs greatly. I also enjoy singing along to the tunes.

I do agree with the one reviewer who was bother by the a dream catcher part of the video. I think they should have at least say something on the box about this. Some people really don't want their children to know about this new age teaching. But saying that I still would have bought this video for the other parts of the video.

I like that this video tries to help children understand that we all have bad dreams and that we can change are dreams if we think really hard.",1126742400,,754,4.1931034482758625
1048830,4,6305559295,"My three and a half year old loves Blue's Clues, and as a result, I've bought almost all of the videos available on Amazon.  This is one of my personal favorites because of the Pyjamanauts sequence and its simple way of explaining night and day.  I don't really ""get"" the segment about changing your dreams, and find that part less satisfactory.",1084406400,,345,4.639344262295082
1048831,5,6305559295,"I was nervous when it was anounced that Steve was leaving but, true to form, the folks at Nick Jr. conjured up a wonderful transition from Steve to Joe. Make sure to watch the 100th episode celebration in the extra featues. My kids (2 and 4) love it. Even though my 4 year old had been watching Steve for two years, she now loves Joe.",1073952000,10,334,4.153846153846154
1048832,5,6305559295,"I thought that this video was wonderful. The segment with the Pajamanauts was just great, though frighteningly unrealistic (Blue and Steve were floating around in space, without space-suits and were having a personal conversation with the sun. In real life they would've either fried or died of lack of oxygen. But I do understand that this is a childrens show so things like that are easily excused. Kids will come to understand that later in life.)
This whole episode was just really great. I recommend it for everyone who's ever been a fan of Blue's Clues.
Blue's Clues rocks. It's a great show for all ages. Well, every episode that was Pre-Joe is great. Joe tries too hard.
That is all.",1059177600,,691,4.7190082644628095
1048833,3,6305559295,"I'm the father of a toddler who absolutely loves Blue's Clues, and in general these tapes are of such uniform high quality that there's nothing to complain about. They're both educational and entertaining, and an adult can tolerate them without pain -- unlike a certain infamous purple dinosaur. So I only plan to comment on those tapes I've seen that present a problem in some way. These will get 3 stars from me, which is the lowest score I could ever bring myself to assign to anything in this series. I have nothing but good things to say about any Blue's Clues tape we own that I don't review, but since that's just saying the same thing as everyone else there's no point in adding to it.
The first episode is highly satisfactory. Over the course of the pajama party we learn about nocturnal animals and take a look at the solar system to find out why night happens on the way to figuring out what Blue wants to do at the party. The second episode is the one with the problem. In general it's very good. It's about dreams, with a special focus on dealing with nightmares. (My kids aren't really prone to nightmares, so I have no way of gaguing how effective it is.)
But then we get to the ""Letter"" segment, where we see two girls making ""dream catchers."" A dream catcher is a traditional Native American object that's supposed to ensnare bad dreams before they reach the sleeper. I'm told it's found mainly among the Ojibway (Chippewa). I don't know if other peoples use it as well, but it has in any event become a staple of New Age spirituality. The older woman guiding the girls tells them that ""spirits and dreams are all around us."" As the project is completed, we see they're not making the dream catcher in the usual spiderweb pattern, but with the pentacle symbol used by modern Wicca and neopagan practitioners, and it's then hung over the bed in the same place a Roman Catholic might hang a cross. If you're a Christian believer, you may find this section in direct opposition to some of the teachings of your faith, and you may need to provide guidance to your children if you allow them to watch it. It appears to be not-so-subtle proselytism for either Native American, Wiccan, or neopagan faiths, and I can only speculate as to why the producers of Blue's Clues decided to include it. I've never seen a pro-Christian equivalent in this show, which is otherwise areligious.",1038182400,12,2391,4.562790697674418
1048834,4,6305559295,"This DVD is not out in stores yet, but I have seen all the episodes in here and are going to focus on one...The Big Book About Us is a good episode for your kids to learn about favorites, learn some of Joe's favorite things, and learn a little bit about bookmaking.  Then we come to the 100th Day episode.  This episode mostly takes place on a stage built in the back of Joe's living room.  It contains a very bouncy song entitled ""100 Days"" and creates the feeling for your kids that they are at a very big gala party, complete with montages of snippets of episodes (some of which, to my knowledge, haven't been released yet- maybe they all will be by the time this DVD is released)  The only problem here is that if you're hoping for a usual Blue's Clues episode, you aren't getting it.  There is no game of Blue's Clues, none of the songs from the new show are played except for ""We Sat On Down"" during a montage, and there is even a misleading part where Mr. Salt asks Blue what her favorite part has been about the first 100 episodes, and she places a pawprint on the screen.  Is it time for a game of Blue's Clues? No, just a montage of clues that have been found already. This episode is a good way for your child to remember all the fun he's had, but if he doesn't understand the concept of 100 days, skip it.",1034294400,15,1317,4.165354330708661
1048835,4,6305559295,"Of all the Blue's Clues videos released (and I've seen most of them a number of times!), this is one of the best overall... BUT, if your child is hoping for the slipper song and/or story aired in the TV version, he or she will be disappointed. They're omitted for some reason. I also was hoping that this would be a quieter tape, nice for viewing after bath and before bed. The first episode is a winner in that respect. We guess what Blue wants to do before bed. The second episode is also great, the goal being to help kids work out their dreams and overcome nighttime fears, but it's full of loud, uptempo music and one of the worst moments in recording distortion history (Steve's letter from his friends). My son usually ends up a little too pumped up from the second one for the first one to have the (my) desired effect.",1006732800,3,827,4.341935483870968
1048836,5,6305559295,My 2 year old son loves Blue's Clues and especially liked this video!

1049098,3,6305559295,"This DVD was painfully awkward. I watched Blue's Clues as a toddler, so maybe I just am more passionate about this than most parents lol. I bought this for my little one, who absolutely loves Blue's Clues now. Unfortunately, these episodes center around the end of Steve's career and the beginning of Joe's. Steve has obviously lost his spark and motivation for acting in these episodes, and Joe is just really awkward in his first episodes. Steve looks miserable and Joe's acting seems forced and unnatural. Even my 13 month old picks up on it, because she loses interest more easily when I put this particular DVD on. Overall this DVD is okay, but if you're looking for the best of Blue's Clues then I'd suggest ""Shapes and Colors"" and ""Blue's Jobs"" instead.",1448928000,,760,4.7218045112781954

1049242,5,6305559295,"I have recently introduced my young toddler (21 months old) to the old Blue's Clues series that my 13 year old used to love. Well, the little one loves these videos just as much as the older one did and has learned a LOT from them. Very good interactive series for small children. Since I knew my little guy would start seeing ""Joe"" instead of Steve I thought it might be a good idea to buy this DVD so he wouldn't be surprised. Turns out that was a VERY good idea. I thought a 3 episode introduction to Joe was a bit excessive and maybe not necessary, but my little one was actually scared of Joe when he first saw him! I guess at this age they may assume there is a real live-time person inside the TV, and can be shy! When Joe first came on, my toddler would actually cover his eyes and peek around shyly at Joe, it really did require the full 3 episodes for my son to accept ""Joe"" over the Steve he was used to seeing on Blue's Clues.  For a child who isn't in a shy stage, maybe this isn't necessary, but in my case it turned out to be VERY helpful -and it was wise on the part of the Blue's Clues show to be sensitive to young and shy toddlers when introducing Joe. I am sad that the series came to an end, but glad the old episodes are still relevant and appropriate for young toddlers, it is one of the best series out there in my opinion. So far it looks like Joe was a good replacement, and I highly recommend watching the introduction episodes if your child is accustomed to watching the older episodes with Steve.",1312416000,,1525,4.134680134680135
1049243,5,6305559295,"My son loves Steve, I mean who doesn't really, and he absolutely loves Joe, but he really loves when Steve and Joe get together.

1049436,5,6305559295,This arrived in no time to my house. When it came both of my kids were excited. I payed less than nothing for it and the DVD had never been used.

1049440,5,6305559295,"I love this dvd because it tells the story of how Joe came to live with Blue. It also explains the reason for Steve's departure in a manner that young children can understand. It actually makes it ok. My son didn't start watching Blues Clues until 2008, so Joe was already the main character, but he was finding it odd to see Steve on re-run episodes, so this helped him understand it all. Now he loves them both! So, if your child thinks it's odd to see Blues Clues episodes with Joe or Steve, this dvd should help them appreciate both characters.

This DVD has the three episodes that explains who Joe is and where Steve was going.  The second show is my son's  favorite because Steve and the viewers have to teach Joe the game of Blues Clues.  The forth episode is ""all about us"" and the viewer learns more about Joe and the rest of the gang at the house.  There is a bonus ""100th episode"" which is hosted by both Joe and Steve in tuxes!  Kind of a clip show with funny bits and songs.  My son gets a kick out of it.  This is great transition DVD.",1186012800,,649,3.8931297709923665

1049444,5,6305559295,"My son, 2 years old, loves watching Blue's Clues, but he was confused if ""Steve"" wasn't the host, since the first few BC videos he saw featured ""Steve"".  Now, after watching ""Get to Know Joe"", he no longer questions ""where's Steve?"".  He says, ""Steve's at college.""  And if he watches an older Blue's Clues, he tells us that ""Joe will come see ""Steve"" soon."".  Who knew it would even be an issue if it was ""Steve or Joe"", but it most certainly was.
