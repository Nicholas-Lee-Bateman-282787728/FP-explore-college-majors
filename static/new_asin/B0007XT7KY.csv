2249000,5,B0007XT7KY,"Wishbone is a dog. He lives with a boy named Joe, and Joe's mom.  Joe has some friends that he sees at school, and after school.  During the show, something happens that makes Wishbone think of a character or situation in a classic book.  Then that story is woven in (with Wishbone playing the part of a main character from the book) with the story of the family.

Well, you can't go wrong with this cute little dog, his family, and the classic book stories worked in.  The costumes for the dog are so cute and clever.  The tying-in of the book's story to the story going on with the family is very creative.

This is a great show for all ages.  There is something for everyone.

Everyone at our house was so sorry when the show was taken off the air.  However, we are now thrilled to be able to purchase at least some of the wonderful shows.

I highly recommend it.",1175644800,5,866,4.251533742331288
2249001,5,B0007XT7KY,"You would not think that a children's show would be fun to watch for an adult but Wishbone just makes you laugh.  It really gives a fine decription of the story but also entertains you to the end.  With the amount of garbage in children shows, it's a blessing to find a program that is of value to children and adults.",1138579200,11,318,4.19672131147541

8053628,5,B0007XT7KY,Paw Prints of Thieves is the story of Robin Hood while Hot Diggety Dawg is Journey to the center of the earth. The quality of the DVD's isn't that great on my 60-inch HD tv (a little fuzzy) but definitely not awful and very watchable. I wish they would release the other episodes on DVD as well! I love Wishbone and it was fantastic to hear the theme song once more and regress back into my childhood!,1251244800,,401,4.220779220779221

A Journey to the Center of the Earth (written by Jules Verne) is about a man named Professor Liedenbrock and his nephew Axel who go on an adventure to the center of the earth. But they have to get past huge monsters and raging waters to get there. Also, when Wishbone is digging in Wanda's yard he finds a mysterious treasure. Wishbone and Joe are trying to unlock the mystery of the object to find out what it could possibly be. So can Professor Liedenbrock get to the center of the earth in one piece and will Wishbone and Joe solve the mystery of the object?

When I purchased this episode I was wondering how the sets were going to look for a Journey to the Center of the Earth, and they did surprisingly well for a kids show. Get this episode because it's a great one to add to your Wishbone collection.

Paw Prints of Thieves

Wishbone's imagination takes off into the tale of Robin Hood in this episode. Robin Hood and his ""merry men"" have been robbing the rich to give to the poor. But the Sherriff of Nottingham is trying to arrest them in the process. Also, Joe is almost suspended from school when he donates leftover cafeteria food to a shelter. But since it's against policy he's not allowed.

This was my favorite version of Robin Hood because Wishbone's personality rolled into Robin Hood makes it really entertaining despite not having too much of the story to watch.

So to wrap things up these are two splendid DVD's (out of four made overall) so you need these two to add to your collection.",1250553600,,1528,4.439285714285714

My son absolutely loves anything Wishbone.  It's a great way to introduce kids to some classic novels.  I'm hoping he'll remember a little of the story lines when he is older and required to read some of the original books for school.",1202428800,,440,7.111111111111111
