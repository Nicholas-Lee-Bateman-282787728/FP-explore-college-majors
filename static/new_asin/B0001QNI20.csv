8016146,5,B0001QNI20,"This is a classic vhs that not only should every Tigers fan own, but, every baseball fan should own. Just tremendous to see the old stadium again in its' glory. And to see and hear Ernie Harwell again and again is awesome. Talk about a national treasure. I am glad I got to see Tiger Stadium a couple of times before they demolished it. Not to mention, seeing Ernie Harwell up in the booth back in '98. What a shame, they should have renovated Tiger Satdium over a nine year period like they did Fenway. Oh well, what's done is done. Unfortunately! Across Europe, ruins and ancient buildings are treasured for centuries. But here in the states, these morons put up shopping malls or worse. If the pyramids were here in the states, they would have been knocked down for a damn Walmart decades ago. A damn shame.",1316649600,2,810,4.47972972972973
