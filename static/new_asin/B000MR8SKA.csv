2741946,1,B000MR8SKA,"Well like I said I am a Christian and I have to agree with most of the reviews on this one. It was very much the two pastors with a mission to show the various evils of sexuality. Not even the evils of porn but more of sexuality in general. This is where it really got me upset the idea that porn and sexuality were, while they never came out and said it explicitly, somehow one and the same and as a result bad for you. What a joke. The video if you pay attention is highly edited and not in the normal way things should be edited but more of the Micheal Moore way of editing. Edit it so it shows what your world vision is on this topic and that is the reality when in fact it is not the reality. Typical of evangelical thinking which imho is what is destroying my faith and making it hard for everyday Christian to interact with those not of the faith. Sexuality is not a sin or bad, in fact if you read the Bible for yourselves you find that God put very little limits on sex.  You won't here that on this video or at the local church for that matter, everything is filthy and off limits, whether its porn or not. If its sexual in any way you should be ashamed; so cover up that ankle. :) Okay, a little drastic on that last sentence but you get the idea. Stay away from this one its outright garbage.",1351468800,6,1304,4.0347490347490345
2741947,1,B000MR8SKA,"NO PORN.  NOTHING LIKE THE COVER.  SEEMS LIKE ONE BIG FREAKING COMMERCIAL.
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BORING ASS VIDEO TO ANYONE.",1337385600,5,126,4.681818181818182
2741948,1,B000MR8SKA,A negative 100 would be too high a rating for this nonsense.  Religious zealotry hiding behind imagery and verbiage.  It's disgusting that christian sociopaths would put forth something like this.,1326844800,9,196,5.5
2741949,5,B000MR8SKA,I joined Amazon Prime and this came up in the documentary free-to-watch section and I thought I'd hate it but it turned out it was pretty funny.  It is about two Pastors and their crusade to help people with their addiction to porn.  The Pastors are likable and are pretty funny so it makes it easy to watch.,1321488000,3,308,4.293103448275862
2741950,5,B000MR8SKA,"All the people who reviewed this with low stars have a complete one track mind. This film discusses a real issue that no one wants to talk about. This might be the best way to bring the issue of porn addiction to the public, and once the public feels comfortable discussing this issue then perhaps, they can delve into more intricate problems and go over in more detal about the problem of porn addiction.

The presentation might ot be to everyone's liking, but the content speaks to all of us at a level and we need to be open minded when confronted with this topic.",1320105600,3,567,4.4
2741951,1,B000MR8SKA,"This fundamentally flawed ""documentary,"" which fails to even acknowledge the important distinction between use and abuse, had the potential of at least being the goofy video its cover promises, but instead only delivers a one-sided preachy self-promotion.",1313020800,29,255,5.918918918918919
2741952,1,B000MR8SKA,"2 ordained ministers preach at you after you, the sinner, were foolish enough to think that the hot woman in the bikini was indicative of the contents.

In other words, preachers are lying to you to get you to watch their preach a thon.

There is absolutely nothing inside that resembles the cover.

Utter dreck.",1299888000,158,312,4.636363636363637
2741953,5,B000MR8SKA,"So I am viewing all the Amazon prime shows on here hoping to watch something with some nudity and filth.  Instead I come across this show and I am forever changed.  This movies has hit home and felt like it was a movie about me and my issue.  I won't lie, at the begining I was hoping to catch a glipse at some hot girl but within 10 minutes of the movie I had a huge change in my heart.
I thank this film and everyone who may have played a part in making it.  Know that I will never go back to my old ways again.
Thank you!!!!",1299110400,12,527,3.8073394495412844
2741954,4,B000MR8SKA,"Can't believe there has not been a review for this, but here goes....this is one fun, fairly insightful, off-the-wall look into these two pastor's lives during the call-and-startup of a Christian effort to reach out to people, both Christian and not, to stop indulging in pornography and get clean for God.  This pair is perfectly suited for each other with Craig blazing his guns for the daily adventure of this undertaking and the more skeptical, dour Mike helping balance the ministry out a bit....pretty entertaining to watch as well as inspiring to see these young men take a ""taboo"" church subject so seriously and publicly.

A critique or two that I have are pretty substantial, IMHO: (1) Near the end of the documentary a short clip of two women on a platform has one very busty woman with a see-through top on? (Since other nude/erotic clips were blurred out and for the spirit of the message who had a editorial brain-freeze on that one!  That cast some doubt on the credibility of the whole message by these guys, sorry to say). (2) In the Special Features section Mike is describing how someone can easily access adult porn in a hotel room and upon coming across how one can purchase Unlimited Viewing for all day he says something like, ""Gosh, someone's gotta be totally desperate!"" in a disgusted, judgmental tone.  As much as I admire and respect him for starting up the ministry, the ugliness of that pride is as disgusting as what he thinks of a man watching porn for hours and hours!  I've been around Christians who far too easily point the finger at the ""juicy"" sexual sins in others while very conveniently overlooking their own obvious pride or jealousy or hatred!!  Sorry, but that was a seriously ""bad"" side of Mike and worthwhile to view in this documentary....after all, Mike is human and God loves us all, right?  The ""doc"" would have been even more fascinating to go into a variety of responses/reactions from leaders of various Christian/Catholic churches...the lack thereof causes me to give this dvd 4 stars.

[** As an aside I called in to a radio station one time when the question was asked if this whole ""Porn 'N Pancakes"" thing was a good idea or not....how could it not be?  If perhaps the guys' hearts were not in the right place, i.e. pride.  I told the talk show host that THIS IS WHAT THE CHURCH SHOULD BE DOING!
**As another aside I read in an interview with the director of this documentary and another project, ""The Pussycat Preacher"", [...], that the guys here didn't appreciate the director's work making a documentary with an ex-Stripper now trying to ""win souls"" for Jesus Christ!?  Now, c'mon, what's that about?  In the Special Features section of ""Missionary Position"" the guys had a huge blow-up penis w/ testicles that read ""Wally the Weiner /  [...]/ The #1 Christian Porn Site "".  I thought this was crossing the line in terms of their ministry....were they at the same time disagreeing with Heather's attempts and ministry strategies to reach out to strippers?  Whoaaa, I hope the guys did a serious backstep later to correct their own judgmental tone and hypocrisy.  Here's a thought: Why not support each other's ministries?  Were the guys acting out of pride? ]

Anyway, Thank You Brian and Mike for your overall efforts.  I do believe you are sincere and operating out of your understanding of God's Love.  May the Spirit guide you into more Truth and Grace.",1250121600,10,3418,4.741554054054054
8171295,5,B000MR8SKA,"It's a great story about fighting against the odds - and it's true!  It's a good movie for Christians and anyone else who has struggled with porn addiction.  Honestly, I feel that this is much less a how-to-quit-porn video - though they definitely let you know which website to go to for help - as much as it is a story about pursuing your calling.  I loved it.  The story of the two pastors was absolutely heartwarming.  A good and very human image of what being a Christian is like.",1415577600,,484,4.333333333333333
8171296,1,B000MR8SKA,It wasn't what I expected. I usually do good with selections in this category. Not this time. I'll research the category better.,1393200000,,128,4.863636363636363
8171297,1,B000MR8SKA,"Just not what I was expecting, I was expecting adult humor/ light erotica. Not at all what this is about. I only mabe it into it a couple of minutes.",1367193600,,149,4.0
8171298,1,B000MR8SKA,It's nothing but some sick attempt to slander Catholics. If you respect and love people you will avoid this awful waste of time.,1364169600,,128,4.608695652173913
8171299,2,B000MR8SKA,"Didn't like the fact these ""film makers"" used porno in a presumably good intentioned, but poorly veiled/executed manner. I find it difficult to believe they needed to go to Amsterdam or other locations to delve into ""porn"" to understand it.  And overall (although I turned it off mid way) it seemed to reek of a convenient excuse to take in what they claimed was wrong in the first place.  I don't need to be a heroin addict to know it's bad, so if their intent is to make films about things like this, basing their opinions on their experiences, it seems to be more opportunistic than anything else.",1362441600,,600,4.546296296296297
8171300,5,B000MR8SKA,A great documentary and such a sad topic.  These guys bring to light their struggles as well as their triumphs against the pornography industry.  I recommend it to everyone.,1361836800,,173,4.931034482758621
8171301,3,B000MR8SKA,"Even though its a low budget film, it was pretty good. Sums it about right on christianity. I honestly wasn't to facinated after watching the film as it was nothing like the cover. And to include I'm not too big on documentaries unless it science or anti-religion.",1361664000,,264,4.638297872340425
8171302,3,B000MR8SKA,I didn't really like it so I stop less then half way through . So I would skip this one and save your time for something else . But at least the title is funny .,1361145600,4,161,3.5
8171303,3,B000MR8SKA,This is a documentary about two pastors who use a unique way to get the word out that porn is bad.  It is interesting though.,1356912000,4,125,4.0
8171304,5,B000MR8SKA,"Wasn't expecting that, but it was definitely what I needed to see. This is the second time I have heard of the site. First time was when I went through a book called Every Young Man's Battle. And anyone who says different is just upset that they were tricked into watching it.",1356307200,2,276,4.326923076923077
