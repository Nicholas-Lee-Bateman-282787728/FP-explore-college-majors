8500919,1,B006MIYNFW,"All the episodes are very good: Dark Autumn, The Electric Vendetta and Who Killed Cock Robin.  Unfortunately, all three of these episodes are included in Set 3.  Usually Amazon lists the episode names in the description - however, none are listed in this case.  Very disappointing.",1408838400,2,281,5.065217391304348

8500921,5,B006MIYNFW,Love the characters and the stories. I haven't seen any episodes without John Nettles in them though. Can't imagine the show without him and his TV family.,1386374400,,155,4.777777777777778
