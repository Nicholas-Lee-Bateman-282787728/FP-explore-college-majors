For instance, the film made out Jonestown to be a beautiful place, where nothing was going wrong, Jim Jones was a good guy, everyone was happy, and then the government came in and murdered the entire town. This despite the fact that people who left Jonestown testify to the contrary.

And then, at the end of the film, when covering a cult murder of two people, there was some rambling interview with a lawyer that seemed more like a brag list of the serial killers he's worked with. It was really weird.

And the movie ended stating that our government is a bigger threat than Al Queda. Huh?

The whole thing was nonsense. The positive reviewers must be friends with the people who made it.",1353456000,,941,4.616766467065868
8508299,4,B0071EKPJ4,"I think for such a short documentary it gave a lot of insight so the viewer could make a decision on whats fact, fiction or just misleading. I think the writer did a great job in exposing the cases shown. She put her point of view into it which I see nothing wrong with that as a lot of documentaries do so. Bottom line look at it and decide for your self.",1346544000,,356,3.9583333333333335
8508300,5,B0071EKPJ4,"First of all Sandra Fredine, the most successful people in the world have critics & that's no secret.  Many like myself choose to address their critics face-to-face, front and center, questions asked.  Anyone linked to certain material ""do"" have restrictions when revealing content or sources for security reasons.

The documentary however, starts off strong & catches your eye when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. appears.  It does tell the other side of the story much different than the mainstream media.

The racism, cover-ups, abuse of power and brutality shown in this film is still on-going today.  The documentary shows historical content.  And yes, if we don't know our past, how can anybody prepare for the future?  Everyone needs to understand what is going on behind closed doors; taxpayers, law-abiding citizens and so forth.  Any and everybody should watch this documentary.  It makes its points and at the end could use more action but you can tell there is a part 2 or more to come.  Many people don't know about the material provided.  So, it is a must-see by people of all races, genders, orientation and status.",1342137600,,1125,4.957219251336898
8508301,1,B0071EKPJ4,"Although this so-called documentary has its points - systemic racism exists and is denied by many whites; experimentation on the vulnerable is a part of our history; the corruption of police departments... - the wholesale mission seemingly trying to be sold here is that perpetrators are initially victims of some sort is...well...irresponsible hogwash.

Sources of information are often called simply 'sources' - who the hell is that?  Your great uncle on your mother's side once removed?  Bobby Brown of Dog the Bounty Hunter fame yammers on about his so-called credentials.

The failure to examine a mindless society brought up on praising a mythical being without question is obviously lacking, as is misogyny and any other contributing factor.

This piece-of-work, and yes, I say that in a dismissive tone, contains nothing new, nothing groundbreaking, no new sources, and I firmly believe the prior reviewers had to be close friends or totally devoid of any history on any of these subjects.",1341878400,,997,5.245283018867925

8508304,5,B0071EKPJ4,"This documentary was so very intriguing, interesting, and informative. It was well-constructed and well-organized, as well. It showed me a multiplicity of what I call ""missing information"" that I was not aware of or that hasn't been exposed regularly or publicly. I must say that it was quite enlightening and beyond phenomenal. Unfortunately, this has not been knowledge that has been exposed or that is shared in our schools for the young people to identify the awareness of what true America has been and is still about. And it should be for all to see, hear, learn, and know. And Miss Brummell has done so with this documentary. Kim Brummell is undoubtedly a great, brilliant, and astounding screenwriter!",1330819200,,709,5.016949152542373
