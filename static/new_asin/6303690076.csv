7852681,5,6303690076,"the makers of the film were definitely capitalizing on the success of home alone. HOWEVER, this is actually a good suspense/thriller, with the exception that the hero is a 10 yr old kid. a lot less comedic than home alone, but also a lot smarter. it is fun to watch in the same way that home alone is- one genius kid taking down 5 professionals. hope they release the dvd so i can have a better copy of the movie.",1308096000,,413,4.175
7852682,5,6303690076,"I saw this movie on Cinemax over 10 years ago. It was really, really good. I came across it by accident while browsing for other movies on Amazon. I had completely forgotten this movie, until I saw it on the listings. I ordered it immediately, and watched it the day it was delivered. Ah, the nostalgia.",1239580800,,303,4.428571428571429
7852683,5,6303690076,"Playing Dangerous is a satisfying suspense thriller.  The plot is a cross between The Desperate Hours and Home Alone.  A family is taken hostage in their own house by terrorists.  The eleven-year old boy is a genius, so he fools the bad guys, escapes, and wages guerilla warfare - taking on one terrorist at a time to try to rescue his parents and sister, with whatever his bright mind can make use of:  toys, electronics, household chemicals, etc.

It's far more serious and intense than home alone, with killing violence and adult situations.  But that makes it all the more satisfying as the young hero makes progress, reminding me of the new movie United 93, though it's not that serious and has a happy ending.",1146268800,4,715,4.68
