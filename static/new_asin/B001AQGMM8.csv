8278596,1,B001AQGMM8,"A group of five extremely annoying female inmates plot their big prison break. This consists of them walking out of what looks like a rental cabin, while someone off camera waves a spot-light around. Next, they're on the run, accompanied by stock ""action music"". Thank the Lord God Almighty above, this was written by Ed Wood jr.! Otherwise, I might have attempted to take this film seriously! The dialogue clinks and clunks along like a tin-can robot wearing anvil shoes. Of course, there is the obligatory nudity and hideous 70s sensuality. The best part comes when the convicts stumble upon a commune of performance art-type hippies. Don't let their organic diets and nekkidness fool you. These folks are into violence, man! Soon, the groovy tables are turned, and the gals have some new, freaky threads, man! Meanwhile, a trio of plum idjit hillbillies is in pursuit. Then, there's the sexual assault on the male motorist. Oh, and the beat-down administered to the world's smallest biker gang! Plus, who could forget the apocalyptic, ""abuse the disabled"" home invasion sequence? In the hands of Roger Corman, FUGITIVE GIRLS could have been a classic. Sorry, Rene Bond or no Rene Bond, this movie is beyond redemption...",1409961600,,1223,5.029556650246305

And to up the ante, ED himself plays TWO roles, and is probably the best actor in the whole crazy flick! And as any fan of RENE BOND will tell you, the girl had that mysterious ""certain something."" If she had only been in the right places at the right times instead of on the path she took, Rene could have been a superstar. She has that girl-next door look, smile and sense of humour, besides being ""cute as a button."" But she didn't, and you'll see ample view of her ""talents"" while shaking your head at the acting and inane plot of this ""nudie cutie!"" SOMETHING WEIRD VIDEO'S version is the one to track down, as it was mastered from the 35mm negative. Their products have ALWAYS been of the highest quality. Following the film feature there are four inserts for the major sex scenes that would've changed it from a ""hard R"" into a ""soft X."" Great for a party, of many or just one.....",1365292800,,1058,4.348484848484849
