Highly recommended....easy to follow and fun to do!",1440374400,15,107,6.2
6078226,5,B00GID0UF8,"The Leslie Sansone DVD's I had were old and I wanted to update my collection.  These DVD's are up to date and include new moves that my others didn't have.  Be aware that the 4 mile power walk dvd is very advanced.  I Had gotten out of walking and just recently began using the old dvd's again and I could not finish the 4 mile power walk.  Very intense!  I'll probably use it once I've been walking for a while longer.  Overall a really great set with three dvd's, a meal plan, stretch band, 30 day walk plan and a few of Leslie's favorite recipes. Really good price for everything you get.",1429401600,47,591,4.232142857142857

6078231,5,B00GID0UF8,I am very pleased with this set but then I haven't had one from Leslie that I didn't like.  I need to switch things up and this helps accomplish that.  I have just started the 30 Day but like what I have seen so far,1462406400,4,215,3.7555555555555555
6078232,5,B00GID0UF8,It is an amazing workout and keeps you on point with all the guess work taken out of what to do today on your workout schedule,1462060800,3,126,3.8846153846153846

6078234,4,B00GID0UF8,The system is great!!,1458345600,,21,4.5
6078235,5,B00GID0UF8,"When I first decided to make a change, I found a 15 minute walk by Leslie Sansone and thought, ""That couldn't be too hard."" Boy, was I wrong! Five minutes into it, I thought I was going to die, literally. While I also use Jessica Smith DVDs and youtube.com videos, I always love Leslie for her upbeat personality and the way she explains what we're doing and why.

If you don't have this set, you want to get it NOW. You get a complete 30-day plan of exercise so you don't have to think about it. You already know what you're going to do that day and just pop in the DVD and do it. Everything is mixed up well and gives you a lot of variety, even though you're primarily walking.

I am not allowed, right now, to do any high-impact moves (jumping, running) as per my doctor, but you can still walk, do calf raises or do tap-outs instead of jumping jacks.

If you're new to stretchy bands, I'd get a lighter one than the one provided. It is very strong and I have difficulty using it, even when I'm holding the ends. However, that's no reason not to get the complete kit.

I will also say that I, particularly, have trouble doing all the upper body movements, so I skip some of them. It is definitely a kit that you can grow into. What I mean by that is that if you're a new walker, you'll have plenty of ways to boost it as you get healthier. If you've been walking for years, there are still a lot of variations that you can try.

I love the interval training and her group of walkers in this one. They're all so upbeat that you can't help but get excited with them!",1458345600,21,1567,4.158415841584159

6078239,5,B00GID0UF8,I've been doing the videos religiously and its a lot of fun and low to medium impact. I strongly encourage esp. if wanting to start to get back into a fitness routine.,1455667200,3,167,4.25
6078240,5,B00GID0UF8,I really like this kit! For the first time in a long time I have done these everyday! I am addicted to these walking programs because I can do them. At 65 my body isn't like it was in my 50's so I look forward doing these programs at home. I can do a mile or I want to do the whole 58 min and feel great afterwards. These are great and especially the 30 day and 30 min workout. I started with this one and got stronger and lost some weight.  Sometimes I have done it twice in one day because it makes me feel so great!! Love it,1454803200,12,527,3.790909090909091
6078241,5,B00GID0UF8,Nice variety of 'walks' to choose from. It's great the the resistance band was included. So far the schedule has been very do-able!,1454544000,2,131,4.739130434782608

8623533,5,B00GID0UF8,Great aerobic walking program!!!! So far I have dropped 10 lbs doing the 30 day program.  The exercises are easy but very intense you do burn a lot of calories.  Glad I made the decision to change my lifestyle and choose Leslie Sansone program.,1486425600,9,244,4.5227272727272725
8623534,5,B00GID0UF8,"I have been using Leslie's YouTube videos for months. You can get a good workout from her. I wanted the kit so I had an organized workout routine.
I'm enjoying my workouts and I can do as much or as little as I want. I do more as it makes me feel good. Don't think it's going to be real easy because it's a walking program. There is interval training, floor work, band work and free weights. Something for everyone but not so hard that you give up.",1484697600,6,448,4.1022727272727275
