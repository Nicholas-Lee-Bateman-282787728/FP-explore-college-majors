3127886,5,B0014A4ELQ,"Although the blurb on the DVD's back cover indicates that this movie is ""Science Fiction"", it is not, except perhaps in the broadest sense, since it is fiction about science, instead.  Events in the movie appear at first to move slowly, but not if you pay close attention to the little details.  The ending throws a curve ball that is quite satisfying.  This film won numerous awards at independent film conclaves.  It deserved them all, although its appeal is mostly cerebral.  Don't expect any special effects, it is not that sort of movie.  It is, however, a profound movie about a rarely addressed aspect of human affairs.  It might be called existential.  It has greatness in it.  It also requires some engagement in the story by the viewer.  Unlike the in-your-face fantasy that currently pervades Hollywood (""Transformers"", the ""Terminator"", movies and such) this movie requires a bit of thought.  It is well worth that effort.",1257897600,5,934,4.961290322580645
3127887,3,B0014A4ELQ,"The title places it into a category of legitimate expectation of provocative scientific and mathematical extrapolations, up there with Pi and Primer, but it ultimately devolves to a festival of pathos. This does not even qualify as science fiction, because the external reference frame solidly locates the subject in a medical pathology. (For example, Donnie Darko 'sees things', but the external reference frame has him die of mysterious, inexplicable causes.) If you want artsy B&W, tight focus, odd angles, nonlinear narrative, subtly saturated palette, moody set and lighting, the subtitles and symphony of foreign language, this is for you. The director is in a deeply respectful love affair with his camera, and the product is slick - it's just mislabeled.",1256515200,,762,5.358333333333333
3127888,5,B0014A4ELQ,"This movie has the most awesome cinematography, filmed mostly in black and white, and a haunting lead character who carries his role so well that you'll find yourself in the scenes with him.  The feel of the movie reminded me a lot of ""Donny Darko.""

Nearly as significant as the movie are the ""Special Features,"" that I feel are a necessary addition to the story, yet, are not to be a part of the movie.  You'll understand, once you see it for yourself.  I watched every feature on the DVD, which I rarely do.

3127889,5,B0014A4ELQ,"One of the most visually and emotionally beautiful films I have ever seen.  I highly recommend The 4th Dimension to anyone with a creative spirit and a  deep understanding about the suffering of those with mental health difficulties. Not overly 'arty', just enough to make it a little surreal and mentally stimulating. There is no swearing, no sex scenes and no violence, what a refreshing change!  The black & white world of The 4th Dimension relies solely on the talent of the actors to convey the characters emotions with minimal dialog (don't worry, the dialog is not too minimal.)  If you want to watch something a little off-beat, a little arty but not too much, mentally challenging and visually gorgeous, then buy The 4th Dimension.  I hope the creators of this film do another black and white film that is similar to this in the near future.  I give The 4th Dimension 5 stars out of 5",1209686400,12,893,4.656050955414012

8254754,5,B0014A4ELQ,Great film. Was surprised to see Byberry!  I grew up not too far from there. I remember it well. When we were kids we always referred to it. Not in such a positive way. I enjoyed the story. Very different.,1523923200,,205,4.125

8254758,4,B0014A4ELQ,"While you might start watching with the expectation of science-fiction, horror, suspense, this atmospheric & compassionate little film isn't really any of those things. It's something better, something richer & more compelling. It's an art film of sorts, if you consider art as the deepest expression of a creator's emotions, composed in such a way that you can't turn from it, because it mesmerizes & provokes a powerful reaction from the viewer. Yet there's none of the pretension that many aspiring art films reach for & fail to grasp -- the creators here are fully in control of their material & know exactly what they want us to see & feel.

As previous reviewers have said, it's a cerebral film, without gratuitous action or sex, and certainly no special effects .... except that the lush, evocative B&W cinematography, and the subtle play of emotions across the lost face of the protagonist, are the best special effects of all. And when I say ""cerebral"" I don't mean emotionally detached, however numb the protagonist might appear at first. This is an achingly heartfelt film that will linger long after the credits roll.

The DVD itself is packed with commentaries & extra features, all of which enhance the experience of the film itself. This is proof that someone with real ideas & genuine vision can create work on a shoestring that far outshines the plastic mega-blockbusters of Hollywood. I look forward to subsequent work from these filmmakers, because they've definitely got what it takes -- highly recommended!",1397865600,3,1527,5.0078740157480315
8254759,5,B0014A4ELQ,"I took a chance on this mvid when I was feeling sick a few winters ago. You know that twilight state between consciousness and unconsciousness when you have a fever? That's how I enjoyed thisAN outstanding movie, it draws you in and makes you use your mind. I really love hidden gems like this.",1393804800,,294,4.462962962962963
8254760,3,B0014A4ELQ,It was different and somewhat slow but for something out of the ordinary...it was worth the watch and i like the black and white.,1388620800,,129,4.416666666666667
8254761,3,B0014A4ELQ,"A depressing yet somewhat engaging, largely black and white movie, about a mentally ill young man and his sad life.",1388275200,,115,4.8
8254762,4,B0014A4ELQ,"Well made and told story.  Nice story line that may someday be picked up and broaden out.  This could go many ways and the sci-fi direction would have kicked it up a notch.  The title certain was effective in getting me to purchase.

In the world of buying or streaming, this would be a streamer.",1384646400,,296,4.327272727272727
8254763,4,B0014A4ELQ,"I like movies that skillfully examine the mysterious nature of time and space so the idea of exploring the fourth dimension intrigued me.  Kudos to the film students who pulled this off on a slim budget.  I would have liked a little more science explained in it.  I did identify with the protagonist's pain and sensitivity.  Living inside your head with persistent tormenting thoughts and undeniable compulsions is a dreadful curse.  A heavy piece of work, but I would watch it again.",1365984000,,484,4.853658536585366
