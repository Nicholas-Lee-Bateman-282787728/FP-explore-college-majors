8150297,5,B000JGWD6E,"Set in Leeds, this show revolves around a program called ""Super Slimmers"" which is very similar to Weight Watchers. Each episode tells the story of another in the group of six or seven friends who all go to Super Slimmers together. Some really fantastic storylines that will make you laugh and tug at your heart. I enjoy it most for the feeling of the North of England, the acting, the accents. Some very real, very difficult issues here, but a lot of laughs. Make sure you get the right region, if you're from the US. Can't wait for the other seasons to be available in our region!",1391040000,,582,4.4485981308411215
8150298,5,B000JGWD6E,"unfortunately, only season one is available in Region one (US & Canada) format. The other three seasons, for some reason, have not been.

And yes, both dvd and streaming should be season by season.

8150299,5,B000JGWD6E,"This is a great DVD a real laugh, if you enjoyed Gavin & Stacey you'll enjoy the humour in this season of Fat Friends'
with a few familier faces from Gavin & Stacey, and very funny too. I have not seen season 2 as it is hard to get, but
I would recommend season one to anyone who wants a laugh !!",1299456000,2,296,3.7903225806451615
8150300,5,B000JGWD6E,"I purchased ""Kay Mellor's Fat Friends: season 1"" because two of the lead actors, James Corden and Ruth Jones wrote and along with Alison Steadman, starred in ""Gavin and Stacey"" a series I thoroughly enjoyed. This series offers a good mix of comedy and drama that I am sure will please most viewers. The stories have substance and are well written; the characters have depth and reveal their vulnerability as the narrative unfolds. Each episode stands alone as the slimming club members deal with their hopes, failings and emotions. I highly recommend this series and I am looking forward to series two and three. I hope series four; if and when it is released on DVD will be sold as a single season and not as part of a four season group. I think most of us are sick of dealing with this obvious stunt to increase sales at our expense.",1287014400,4,835,4.5364238410596025
