1108826,1,6305988943,"I am a huge fan of Angelina and try to see all of her movies, hence my viewing of this particular video.  However, I have to say this movie was awful! It moved so extremely slow and to me, seemed very hard to follow at times.  Except for Angelina, the acting was poor and this is obviously low budget.  If you are considering seeing this, I would recommend it only if you are a big Angelina fan, b/c despite her appearance on the cover she plays a quite minute part, appearring in only a few scenes.  Although I gave the movie 1 star, I'd give Angelina's performance 4 stars- truly great work esp. considering it's one of her 1st!!!",1056326400,4,632,4.285714285714286
1108827,1,6305988943,"Um, I so wish my mother never said ""if you can't say something good, don't say anything at all"".....that would totally negate the reviewing process, would it not?
If you've read some of my other reviews, you know I am a big fan of Angelina Jolie. I'm working on a complete collection of her films and therefore, I bought this one.
I don't exactly regret buying it - I mean, I really want to own all her films, the only problem is, this movie is terrible. I will likely never watch it again. Or if I do, it will be in twenty years or so and only for a laugh as Angelina accepts her third Academy Award....from such humble beginnings....I hope the best for her.
Back to the film - there are many problems. The main problem being, it's very boring. The next problem, which actually leads to the first problem, is that the editing is pretty much non-existant. There are useless scenes peppered throughout. And any scenes that might be useful, they run long and have extraneous minutes. There is literally no character development or growth. I doubt very much that there was anything on the editing room floor.
From poor scripts are poor movies made.
The film is based on a true story, a murder, but it is horribly told with the police being portrayed as complete idiots.
And now to the reason I made this purchase - Angelina Jolie. Unfortunately, Angelina Jolie isn't in a whole lot of this movie, which is not a surprise. She has a minor part as a girlfriend of a suspect in the murder. Her first appearance is about half way into the film - but believe me, it feels like longer. She plays it tough, but you can see that she's not exactly cut her acting chops yet.
The entire film sort of comes off as an acting school project. There's a whole bunch of emoting and HUGE sections of the story that just don't make sense. And that's not because it's a murder mystery, it's because of poor storytelling.
In most circumstances, stories based on real events have a certain interesting quality, but not this film.
If you want real-life drama, starring Angelina Jolie, pick up a copy of ""Gia"" - you will be stunned by her performance. She is outstanding in that breakthrough role.
The premise of this DVD is that this is a true story and if you can help solve the mystery, there's even a big reward in it for the the viewer if you come up with evidence, etc. Do you think with a catch like that, this movie is worth watching? I hope you answered no.
This one is for the Angelina Jolie Completist ONLY.

1108909,3,6305988943,"After his murder, we were pulled in when we met a corrections officer, who had testified against the former corrections head, and Franke had permanently assigned him to the towers, which are accessed from outside the prison walls, as there was a contract out for the corrections officer. From there, things got very weird. After Michaels murder, the corrections officer was being transferred back inside the wall, and the officer had almost exhausted his vacation when he was put in touch with our office. I know we were on to something, and some were not comfortable with us being interested.

Just this past year, I learned that a Salem softball team I had been invited onto, and I had thought something wasn't right, as I was replacing a guy who had played second base for them for years, but I learned this past year that everyone of the teams members were either corrections officers or convicted felons, who were not at that time, incarcerated.

 I still have a ton of documents we copied one Sunday afternoon at our office, in the Capitol building. I received a death threat, but hardly took it seriously, as it was on a taped answering machine.  Never the less, from what we learned, and saw, we have no doubted the man convicted was rail-roaded to get the investigation stopped. Michael Franke found big sums missing from the department budget and also felt some corrections staff was cooperating with some inmate gangs regarding methamphetamines.  There's so much the has not been discussed, and those of us close enough to learn but not so close as to be compromised, feel some people are just going to have to live their lives, eventually pass away before some of what there begins to come out. My sense is the movie was created to keep some information alive. If that's all this has done, it was worth it.",1423440000,12,1818,4.70440251572327

1108996,3,6305988943,"In 1989, Oregon Department of Corrections director Michael Francke was murdered near an office building. The case remains unsolved. This crime/courtroom thriller movie has a two-fold purpose. The first is to chronicle a brother's search for the truth and the second is to call the fairness of the American justice system into question. Either way, it's a scary tale. Shortly before Francke was killed he visited his brother Kevin in Florida. There he confided that he had accidentally discovered a drug smuggling ring that linked his colleagues with prison inmate. Later when the Salem police contact Kevin about the death, they assure him that Michael died during a routine robbery, but Kevin doesn't buy it and so heads to the northwest to investigate. It doesn't take long for him to get knee-deep into a complex conspiracy plot that leaves him wonder whom, if anyone in town he can trust. Despite the small budget, this movie has a down-to-earth plot with plenty of detailed twists.",1266192000,15,986,5.0182926829268295

1109000,3,6305988943,"WITHOUT EVIDENCE is a frustrating movie to watch, because you know how it ends, and it's not really a happy ending.  Based on the true story of Michael Francke, an Oregon Director of Corrections who was brutally murdered.  His brother, Kevin, is certain a conspiracy is involved, but the police and the district attorney have nothing to do with his theory.  A coverup is intimated, as key witnesses admit they lied.  Along the way Kevin gets involved with a young woman who killed a drug dealer--she says he is the one that killed Francke.  However, a druggie named Frank Gable is framed and convicted.  The movie even has a disclaimer that offers a reward for any information involving the murder.

The movie snail paced, and at times loses its impact by trying to be too conversational.  However, in the film are some very good performances.  Scott Plank as Kevin is sincere and riveting in his portrayal of the brother wanting justice for his slain kin; Anna Gunn is very believable as Liz, the young woman Kevin falls for; Andrew Prine does a fine job as a t.v. reporter who helps Kevin find the truth; Paul Perri gives a good performance as Unsold, the police chief who wants Kevin to disappear; and Angelina Jole in one of her first roles portrays Jody, the drug addict teen who knows the truth but is silenced.  Jolie shows her potential in a role that doesn't have a lot of screen time, but when she's on screen, you are mesmerized with her credible performance.

Some tighter direction and a shortened script may have helped make this low budget film a little better, but as it is, it's a reputable true crime drama.",1101945600,13,1625,4.627177700348432
1109001,1,6305988943,"Okay, I admit it: I have a weakness for Angelina Jolie.  I would watch her paint woodwork, do crosswords, order pizza, etc.  But this film, whatever it may have started out to be, should never have escaped the studio.  Angelina Jolie plays a screaming drug addict, during all of the 4 minutes that she's in the movie.  At one point, being driven in a car against her will, she screams that she wants out, and bangs the window of the passenger side for effect.  Trust me:  this scene was not in the script.  She was screaming to get out of this picture.",1086220800,10,552,4.352941176470588

7899374,3,6305988943,"Jolie can act and she did well but Anna Gunn was the co-star and Jolie had a small part compared to Gunn.

7899376,3,6305988943,"A typical '80's film, but I did not like the ending. Supposedly, it was based on a true story (read the laughable fine print about the reward you'd never get at the end), but there was no mention about how the case was left outstanding. The viewer is told at the beginning that the case was unsolved or questionable, but the director did not; in fact, he suggested it was closed. The movie was good, but the ending was horrible, like the director ran out of time or budget and just cut it off. To put it mildly, it was an incomplete plot line. This would be an interesting story, if someone could find a director who knew what they were doing and some better actors. This film is more of an outline of a story than an actual story. Jolie would have been better playing the reporter or investigator. Sure, she plays crazy well, but her talents were wasted here. She was the only decent actor in the film, and they put her in a small, supporting role? What a waste.",1510790400,,963,4.2967032967032965
