2683869,4,B000K7VHIC,"I enjoyed this show quite a bit when it first came out.  The banter between Jamie Lee Curtis and Richard Lewis develops nicely.  The first 6 episodes were ok, but it improved much with Ann Magnuson coming on as the quirky magazine editor.  It's an amazing amount of video on three discs for the price.",1193875200,4,301,4.4363636363636365
2683870,5,B000K7VHIC,"Had the Charles/Burrows/Charles axis been able to shepherd creator Wendy Kouts down the proper path, and resist changes called for by studio suits, this could have been the romantic comedy of the late 20th century.

Sad to say, the exact opposite of each condition occurred, and this program waffled and whimpered and eventually wasted away.

What a waste it was.  Curtis and Lewis were so fine together.  JD Souther produced the best theme song for ANY romantic comedy, and the opening credits of the first ""season,"" as Lewis and Curtis point out, were perhaps the best ever produced.

The principles are all too old to be believable in a 20-something-30-something comedy.  But it could be revived, with younger actors... if someone had the vision.

In any event, this is a worthy program to grace any DVD collection.",1191974400,2,818,4.927007299270073
2683871,4,B000K7VHIC,"This Battle of the Sexes was more about the *internal* battle of two romantic souls just a bit over-cautious about ""letting it happen again"". Yes, all the ingredients are there for Love....but it's anything but. Or so they think.
The first few shows have the proverbial growing pains of many successful sitcoms (conscious or unconscious ""borrowing"", here maybe from Mary Tyler Moore/Lou Grant/others) but right from the start Jamie Lee Curtis and Richard Lewis hit the mark, and that expected stiltedness, staginess, if you will, is not evident as it is in the early ventures of Seinfeld, for example.
It's interesting that both shows went through major changes for the better: here ABL morphed from a sentimental young-woman-from-the-country takes-on-a-big-city-publisher to a non-stereotypical setting, with self-deprecating intellectuals working for a Boss who is anything but self-deprecating. Close to the time this series abrupted ended, JS showed up, and that show went from a show about a hip comedian and his quirky New York friends to the ""show about nothing"".
Well, ABL did not become a show which dominated television, as it had a short run. The interviews and reflections in the special features suggest that a warm show involving nice people who cared about each other and the world they lived in just not might be what would soon be the norm for sitcoms.",1186704000,3,1369,5.143497757847534
2683872,4,B000K7VHIC,"I loved this show. Richard Lewis and Jaime Lee Curtis fit surprisingly well into the sitcom format.

Anyway, when ""Seinfeld"" came out a year or so after this, I watched a few episodes, didn't care much for it and, said to myself, and anyone else who would listen, ""poor Jerry Seinfeld, his show will never take off and be a hit, like Richard Lewis' show.""

At the urging of some friends, I picked up on Seinfeld in their second season and the rest is history.

Regardless of all that, I can't wait to watch these again.  It is definitely an overlooked gem.",1181865600,4,556,4.421568627450981
2683873,4,B000K7VHIC,"This show was one of the most enjoyable & entertaining shows in the late 80s-early 90s era. It had two strong, well-matched lead actors in Jaime Lee Curtis & Richard Lewis--who exuded an endearing & powerful romantic chemistry and charm together. The show also had a talented supporting cast that provided the icing on the cake for this show. The dialogue was sharp, funny, & often surprisingly poignant. I am looking forward to the rest of the series coming out. This show is a winner!!",1174780800,3,487,4.741176470588235
2683874,5,B000K7VHIC,"The problem inherent in any television show that revolves around the sexual tension between its two romantic leads is how do you keep the audience interested after the thrill of the chase is gone? Once the anticipation of the potential couple hooking up has been removed, what do you put in its place? The early `90s sitcom Anything But Love tried to answer these questions in a smart and entertaining way with two very engaging leads - neurotic comedian Richard Lewis and sexy actress Jamie Lee Curtis. This much beloved sitcom finally gets its due on DVD with the first two seasons available in one volume.

Richard Lewis gets to do his stand-up shtick and plays the neurotic guy to the hilt. Marty is jaded and cynical and this acts as a nice contrast to Hannah's peppy enthusiasm. She's just happy to be working in a job she truly loves. As she demonstrated with a film like A Fish Called Wanda, Curtis has a knack for comedy, displaying crackerjack timing with Lewis while also being adept at physical humour as well. The writing is top notch - sharp, crisp dialogue that snaps and pops with sarcastic one-liners courtesy of Lewis in contrast to Curtis' unflappable optimism. The writers hit the right beats on a consistent basis and the cast does a great job of delivering them.

Watching Curtis and Lewis in Anything But Love is like going back in time. He sports the big hair look from the 1980s (that has not aged well) while Curtis adopts a mousy look that downplays her natural sexiness that she normally exudes. Thankfully, they would tweak her look in the second season. There is also undeniable chemistry between Curtis and Lewis that is constantly evident, like in a scene from the ""Deadline"" episode where they dance to a cheesy romantic song. You can see a genuine expression fun and enjoyment in their faces. They work well together and the appeal of this show is watching their characters flirt and eventually fall in love with each other.

Disc one features an audio commentary on ""Fear of Flying"" by Jamie Lee Curtis and Richard Lewis. From the way they banter you can tell that they are still good friends and this only emphasizes the chemistry we see on-screen.

Disc two features a commentary on ""Hotel of the Damned"" by director Robert Berlinger. He says that this was his very first episode of T.V. and points out his first mistake (a visible boom microphone in the first shot).

The third disc has a retrospective featurette entitled, ""All About Anything But Love,"" with Curtis, Lewis, creator Wendy Kout and other key people back to reminisce about the show. In discussing its origins, footage from the unaired pilot is shown and it's interesting to see the original idea which was eventually rejected.

""Stories from the Set"" features most of the participants from the previous extra telling more anecdotes about working on the show, including their impressions of cast and crew members and how everyone bonded like a big family.",1172188800,10,2958,4.778864970645793
2683875,5,B000K7VHIC,"I'm dating myself here, but I was 12 years old when Anything But Love premiered on ABC in March of 1989. It was unlike anything I'd ever seen on TV before, and I loved it.

Now that I'm 30, I see the show from a grown-up's perspective, and appreciate it on so many more levels than I could when I was a kid.

Richard Lewis and Jamie Lee Curtis have terrific chemistry and impeccable comedic timing as Marty Gold and Hannah Miller, who meet on a flight to Chicago and become friends after Hannah helps Marty deal with his fear of flying, which helps lead to them working together at the magazine Chicago Monthly (changed to Chicago Weekly in the second-season premiere). The entire supporting cast is top notch, although I wish they would have kept Sandy Faison as Pamela Peyton-Finch when the show underwent all the ""Ch-Ch-Changes"" at the start of the second season, since she was such a terrific foil for Hannah, and watching her square off with new editor Catherine would have been something to see, since both Pamela and Catherine were self-involved characters, but Pamela did notice what was going on around her more than Catherine seems to do. Ann Magnuson's Catherine is a more active if more self-involved editor than Louis Giambalvo's Norman, but, while I have yet to work my way through all 28 episodes, so far her most defined relationship is with her executive assistant Jules Kramer (Richard Frank), as she constantly orders him around. The addition of Holly Fulger as Hannah's best friend ""female division,"" Robin in season 2 is brilliant; Hannah and Robin are true gal pals that remind me of me and my girlfriends. I do miss Bruce Kirby as Hannah's father Leo Miller, and wish he could have made an occasional guest appearance after the first season. Joseph Maher as Brian Alquist was also a good casting move, as he is the very portrait of a veteran magazine writer.

I have found Anything But Love to be laugh-out-loud funny, feel-good TV, and it's even better the second time around and seeing it as a grown-up. Watching Hannah and Marty deal with exes and editors, deadlines and dual writing careers spent side by side, and cheering on their growing relationship as friends on their way to being lovers and juggling all of their baggage and their deepening relationship is some of the most fun I've had watching television in years.

I'm already looking forward to the release of seasons 3 and 4 as I continue to enjoy seasons 1 and 2.

If you're looking for smart, funny, timeless comedy, and proof that (on TV anyway) best friends can successfully also be the best lovers, pick up the first two seasons of Anything But Love. You won't be disappointed!",1172016000,6,2671,4.698717948717949
2683876,5,B000K7VHIC,"Anything But Love was never a huge hit. It ran from 1989 to 1992.  The first season was only six episodes, and the final season was cancelled midway through. Why? Because network execs thought the show was not repeatable. No syndication value. Lifetime broadcast repeats briefly. So why is Anything But Love coming to DVD?  Someone at Fox must think it's a fine show.  And it is. The combination of a charming actress (Jamie Lee Curtis) and a very funny stand up comic (Richard Lewis) is perfect. Their chemistry drives this vehicle, and they are strongly supported by a wonderful group of actors.

The setup is simple. These too people are attracted to each other but won't admit it because they work together. Love will not bloom until the third season, but the first two are still great.

Lewis and Curtis do not hog the spotlight. They allow the other characters to shine. Ann Magnuson is a standout as the editor of the magazine, and Holly Fulger is very funny as Curtis' needy best friend.

The dvds also include a documentary about the series, and commentary on the pilot with Curtis & Lewis. It's obvious everyone connected with the show loved it. Many episodes were directed by David Trainer, who directed every episode of That 70's Show.",1171238400,15,1247,4.723502304147465
2683877,5,B000K7VHIC,"While I only remember drips and drabs about this show, it's one I think of often - even 17 years later.  What I do remember is how disappointed I was when it did not return to prime time.  I do remember it was touching at times through the laughter. I logged on today to see if it was available on DVD.  So happy to learn it will be coming out early next year.  Something to look forward to after the holiday hoopla is over!  I always wondered why Jamie Lee didn't try another sitcom.  It will be great to see these episodes again!",1164672000,11,531,4.106796116504855
2683878,4,B000K7VHIC,"It was a rather unlikely sitcom pairing back in 1989 - Jamie Lee Curtis, who seemed to be doing fine with her big screen career and Richard Lewis known by those who followed the stand-up circuit in the 80's as a pathologically angst-ridden comic who only half jokingly would claim that his perfomances were a form of therapy.

And yet, that was the point - although never catching on enough with audiences, in spite of a revolving door of cast changes with the surrounding players, the heart of the series was the affinity that Curtis and Lewis had for each other as Hannah Miller and Marty Gold, and doubtless why the movie actress and tortured comic joined up to do the show in the first place. In interviews over the years, the actors have always reflected kindly on the show, for although the writing wasn't as strong as others, the affection they shared for each other seemed more grounded, rang truer. Where on ""Cheers"" Sam and Diane's heat burned bright then quickly fizzled, Hannah and Marty's romance shown with light, dimly at first and brighter as it went - the coupling seemed even more compelling after the consumation. For me, Hannah and Marty had the relationship I found more intriguing - intelligent, respectful and comfortable. The show was at least as interesting after they got together, if not more so.

Sure, the courtship was set in a workplace comedy centered around a Chicago magazine, but at its core this was a story of a romance. The writers seemed to soften Lewis' stand-up persona to make him an effective romantic lead, and Curtis' rapport with him validates the writing.

Although the show's writing wasn't as strong as some comedically, it could be very insightful and touching - and certainly funnier than many others of its era. Rumor has it that the production company that sold the show to ABC axed it themselves since they didn't see a great syndication potential out of it, and since it probably last aired on Comedy Central some six years ago after a long abscence the cancellation seems the right choice.

For me, this was one of the great ""also-ran"" comedies of the 80's, and to see two seasons of it released gives me hope that other more successful B-team sitcoms (Night Court, Mad About You, Drew Carey, etc.) may finally get another look by the studios as well for further DVD releases.

So thanks in advance to Fox Studios for the anticipated February 07 release, and here's hoping the rest follow right behind.",1163548800,24,2458,4.733644859813084
2683909,5,B000K7VHIC,"This to me, by far is one of the better purchases that I've made on Amazon!!!!!!!! I was so excited to see that this was available that I couldn't order it fast enough!!! From the theme song to the last episode of the second season, the chemistry between Jamie Lee Curtis' Hannah Miller and Richard Lewis' Marty Gold is priceless. I so thoroughly enjoy every high every low, every laugh, every fight and every aaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwww moment!!! I remember Jamie Lee Curtis being so upset when ABC, cancelled the show for no apparent reason, (so was I), but now I have Volume One, and Seasons 1 & 2!!!! This means so much to a sentimental slob such as myself!!! My one disappointment was that I wasn't able to order the final episodes!!!

2683914,5,B000K7VHIC,"well what can i say, if you loved the show when it was on, you will love it now. Sure it looks dated and 80s, but it's still good if you focus on the relationships and not the computer screens (which in an office at the time were actually advanced).
The audio tracks from jamie Lee Curtis and Richard Lewis are worth it as well... except should of been done on more episodes.
It's interesting to see the change from the early episodes to a rewrite of the intro and story a bit, didnt' recall the early version of the show. They had a certain something together the main two actors and it was what made the show work.
Now, where are the remaining seasons ? This came out in 2006, it's 2014, and they still are not released. Guessing the sales weren't as great as they wanted on this set. Well if in doubt get a copy it's fun to watch.",1406419200,4,833,4.148148148148148

Still, I watched these tapes many times over the years.  I am thrilled to have good copies on DVD at last.  I've yet to watch every episode and the bonus materials.  I have watched about half of them.  I am disappointed in one episode as it appears on the DVD.  It's the one titled ""Breast of Friends"".  Marty has to appear on one of those 'Report' shows where panelists discuss issues of the day.  He tapes crib sheets to his chair because he freezes up in front of an audience.  He tells Hannah that he was in his high school production of ""Oklahoma"" and taped crib sheets to the set.  When he freezes 'on air' during the tv show, he starts singing ""Surrey with the Fringe on Top"" from Oklahoma.  This moment was edited out on the DVD.  The only reason I can think of is that they would have to pay royalties (the song was written by Rogers & Hammerstein).  The trouble is, the rest of the episode has great jokes relating to this moment.  Most of these jokes were also edited out.  A couple of related jokes remain but make no sense.  Too bad.
