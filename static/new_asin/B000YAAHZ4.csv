8231485,4,B000YAAHZ4,"I love doing this video with my children then ages 3, 3, 5,  and 8.  It helps them relax.  It's a little expensive but I value the insight that I have gained from using this video.  Also, it's better than paying for a creative movement class, especially in winter when there's inclement weather.",1440979200,,295,4.509433962264151
8231486,5,B000YAAHZ4,My three-and-a-half year-old daughter is wild about this video (and has been for the nearly year-and-a-half we have owned it).  I love it because it feels a whole lot better than plopping her down in front of a movie or cartoon while I try to get dinner on the table.  She is engaged and moving throughout the whole program.  And now my twenty-month-old son is starting to get interested in it as well!,1197590400,10,402,4.47945205479452
