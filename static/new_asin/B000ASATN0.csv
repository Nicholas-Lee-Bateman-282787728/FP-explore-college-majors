Problems arise when our killers happen to be at a scene of a copy cat killer and must toss the pair of scissors they are carrying. Now ""The Scissors Man"" must find out who the copy cat killer is because...

The problem with this film is that I figured out the clever twist shorty after the copy cat killing. This made the film a bit lame for me. After that killing, the movie becomes mostly a slow moving crime drama.

8079666,4,B000ASATN0,"Random acts of weirdness turn out to be clues to an unsurprising, yet reasonable reveal. The Japanese are my favorite at plowing through absurdity with a straight face. The director employs a few visual flourishes to remind us that this isn't a real crime thriller. The cops provide comic relief while the bad guys are almost frozen in their steadfast psychological drama. As Kumiko and Abe Hiroshi are present for credibility. I love As Kumiko and the film is mostly hers. She's pretty low key, doesn't swing her arms much when she walks, but she's still engaging, becoming more so as the film progresses and you get onboard with her and her hilarious attempts at suicide. The moral of the story needs a bucketload of salt but who cares? It's not laugh out loud funny but it's a good dark comedy of inner-child pain and murder. Not a lot, but a little, blood. The goriest thing has to be the nicotine stew As cooks up for herself.
