5643740,5,B00BLN4V2I,Same as season 7 Good quality!!!!!,1404864000,,34,4.833333333333333
5643741,5,B00BLN4V2I,The shows are in black and white but that doesn't take away from the great stories.  This is a series that can be watched in any sequence for each story is a individual plot and not a play on what happened before.  A great family western.,1399248000,3,238,4.1521739130434785
5643742,5,B00BLN4V2I,"Good story's, Clint and Eric and the boys, horses, and all kinds of actors from the sixties I recognize but have to look up on IMDB to
figure out where I've seen them. This show just keeps on rock'n... (and rolling...)",1397520000,3,218,4.341463414634147

5643745,5,B00BLN4V2I,Always interesting.  Like the stories.  Like the characters.  Nice to watch them again.  Fun to watch and remember from childhood.,1380499200,,130,5.35
5643746,4,B00BLN4V2I,"What can you say, if you buy the sixth season -- and there's no need to ""rate"" vol. 1 AND vol. 2, for Pete's sake, Amazon, train your ratings computers -- you must like Rawhide. It's still head and shoulders above the ""reality"" stuff being peddled over the air.",1380412800,3,261,4.346938775510204
5643747,5,B00BLN4V2I,I've watched this show in reruns ever since I was a little kid.  It is great too finally see them uncut and the way that they were originally aired.,1379721600,,148,4.103448275862069

5643749,5,B00BLN4V2I,"This was always my favorite t.v. western. I can't wait to complete the whole set. The only thing that depresses me, is they never did this show in color.",1377648000,2,153,4.310344827586207
5643750,5,B00BLN4V2I,"raised up with rawhide,liked all the westerns back then but they don't make them like that anymore. hope they come out with the rest of the seasons",1377216000,,147,4.481481481481482
5643751,1,B00BLN4V2I,"CBS should have stopped the publication of this series with number 6. Season 7 is boring with ""plots"" which border on the childish and lack any artistic value. Most episodes consist of bland cowboy and Indian plots, the type we saw as kids 25 years ago. I enjoyed the first 6 seasons.",1374537600,2,284,4.480769230769231
5643752,5,B00BLN4V2I,Good entertainment. Good picture quality. Season 6 showing searching for new stories with Mushy and Hey Soos having their episodes. Still gives variety.,1374451200,3,152,5.6521739130434785
5643753,5,B00BLN4V2I,Love Eric Fleming and Rawhide am looking forward to season eight of Bonanza because there are two episodes with Eric Fleming,1372377600,5,124,4.9523809523809526
5643754,5,B00BLN4V2I,"""Lonesome Dove"" remains the lone standout TV western mini-series. However, that consisted of merely three episodes. For me the greatest TV western of all time is ""Rawhide.""  Running to 217 episodes from mid-1958 to late 1965, the vast majority of the shows were solid starring a strong leading cast headed by Eric Fleming as trail boss and Clint Eastwood as ramrod. Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines, Rocky Shahan, James Murdock and Robert Cabal provided able support. There were missteps by the suits at CBS and among the producers during the shakedown episodes and the legion of fans quickly let them know that the cattle drive and not the towns was the focus. I was one of those original fans who preferred the trail dust drifting over the wide open spaces for story action settings with the occasional brief stop for supplies at trail towns. Episodes in this mostly solid first half of season six provide that with a just a few of those annoying studio sound stage-attempting-to-duplicate-the-great-outdoor scenes. Still I recommend the series to everyone who loves a great western.",1372204800,11,1080,5.033519553072626
