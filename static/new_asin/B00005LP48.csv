7944283,5,B00005LP48,"NOTE: Frequent nudity and adult situations. NOT for impressionable children.

Often touted as a Japanese contribution comparable to ""South Park"". I personally would not agree with this claim as the Ping Pong Club series offers no ""Guest Star Parody Cameos"", nor does it address references involving current events, nor does it include the tongue in cheek pseudo-moral lessons. These boys learn no lessons from the mistakes of themselves or others. Still, these kids are not just your standard middle school ""Class Clowns"" or weirdos either. They take their sick perversions to the extreme.

Unquestionably outrageous - Some antics and schemes may surprise or shock the viewer by the utter nerve & audacity. This is the kind of stuff which would likely have landed any ""real"" kid into perminent residency in ""Juvie Hall"" or some ""Military Academy"" boarding school. Yet Maeno and his cohorts are not only totally oblivious to any potential repercussions, they really could care less so long as they are enjoying themselves, which they consider proportional to however uncomfortable they can make their victums or audience.",1358208000,,1120,5.286516853932584

7944286,5,B00005LP48,"When I saw this DVD at a local electronics store, I was shocked!  Why?  It's because this anime is very perverted.  No, it's not hentai (adult anime) and it's not anything like those type of anime.

Think of it as mixing ""South Park"" with the perverted jokes that you hear in the locker room.  Juvenile humor at it's best with plenty of fart jokes, mooning and an extra load of perverted humor.  That's what ""The Ping Pong Club"" is about.  So, if you don't like this type of humor...stay away!

For those familiar with Japanese television shows, think of it as a live version of ""Giragameshu"".

I first heard about this series a few years ago through my friends and a female friend from Japan collected the manga and I just remembered how interesting the character designs were for the anime.  I also remembered how interesting this anime after watching the episode, so once I saw this DVD for sale, I asked myself this question: ""Is America ready for The Ping Pong Club""?  I guess this remains to be seen.

The story is about a group of interesting individuals who are members of a Ping Pong Club.  The stories feature the lecherous duo Maeno and Izawa who are perverted but have an ability disguising themselves.  These guys are truly off the wall.  Then the other members.  One is a guy who has a problem with body odor and a belly button with an extreme outtie, the president is your normal guy who likes the beautiful but overly tough girl of the club, then there is the short member with a big head who likes to get his thrills from animals and the playboy of the group.  Each make up the ""Ping Pong Club"".

This series really is off-the-scale perverted humor and what do you know, it's available in the US and on DVD but the weird thing is, Software Sculptors released this DVD not from episode 1 but starting at TV episode 23 through episode 34.

Yes, television episodes and most likely shown late night.

Well, don't worry...the show doesn't necessarily have a typical anime series plot.  Each episode is different.

The episodes are similar to the ""Urusei Yatsura"" and ""Crayon Shin Chan"" series.  Each half hour episode contains a total of two 15-minute episodes.

So, what kind of humor will you find in these episodes?

One episode has Maeno and Izawa helping an elderly ventriloquist after they busted his doll.  So, Maeno is forced to disguise himself as a doll and together with the ventriloquist performs at a local school of young kids.  Unfortunately, Maeno's perverted mind kicks in.

Another episode features the group trying to find their missing membership dues.  Someone in the club took the money but what this member is using the stolen money for is shocking.

Again, this anime is not hentai.  There is quite a bit of nudity and fart jokes, so you know where this anime is going.

As for the DVD, it features a trailer, title free OP credits and Software Sculptors trailers.

A very entertaining, perverted, juvenile anime series!  I love it!",1218585600,,2969,4.63531669865643

It was a little shocking at first because with its incredibly filthy and risque humor, but after I got use to it, it was incredibly funny.  I must see for anyone who ever liked humor that is daring.",995760000,3,246,4.212765957446808
