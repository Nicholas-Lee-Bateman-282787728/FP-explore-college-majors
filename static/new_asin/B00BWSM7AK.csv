5679590,5,B00BWSM7AK,The image quality is excellent on this collection. Wish all of the titles had been film noir but that's just me. I bought this from Round 'n Round and got it faster than I thought possible. I don't know how they did it but I'll be happy to order from them again.,1365033600,6,262,4.0576923076923075
5679591,5,B00BWSM7AK,"Sony and Turner Classic Movies have released five of Glenn Ford crime drama movies in this box set. The films included: THE LADY IN QUESTION, THE UNDERCOVER MAN, FRAMED, MR. SOFT TOUCH, and CONVICTED. All five films have been restored, remastered and look fantanstic (for DVD)! Each film has its own disc (so no compression problems) with very little special features (usually promotional materials). I am writing this after finding mine on the Turner Classic Movie page. The price is somewhat cheaper (at least when I got mine) than what the third parties are asking for here on Amazon. If you are a true Glenn Ford fan (who isn't?) you need to add these classics from Columbia in your library. These may not be his greatest, but their are some really great movies in this set. I admit, I enjoyed all five! Most of these have not been released on DVD here in the states and they make their premiere here in this awesome set. My only complaint (and for the older folks, you will agree) is the way they have the discs stored. It is hard to get these discs to come loose. They are really in there and it makes you want to almost bend the disc to get them out. But play around with it and be careful not to break anything. You would think that Sony would house the discs differently for the older audience this is aimed at.
I never thought I would see the day a studio would release a Glenn Ford box set! I knew I had to have it the day it came out!! A great under appreciated actor from an era in films that is sorely missed. Enjoy!!",1364688000,23,1531,4.337979094076655
8574831,3,B00BWSM7AK,"Appears to be a great set. And one which would appeal to many of us older souls. However,I will not purchase as it does not include subtitles. Many of us boomers are experiencing diminishing vision. TMC / Sony should consider this---Thank you Amazon for including a photo of the reverse side of the box. It would be great if this practice continues as it lets us know exactly what we are purchasing .Three stars are for the box--",1472860800,2,429,4.512820512820513
8574832,4,B00BWSM7AK,All the movies were good!  But what's not to like about Glenn Ford?,1440979200,2,67,4.153846153846154

8574834,3,B00BWSM7AK,I am writing this review for the box the movies come it. It is very hard to get the movies out. The disks on the right side fell out when I opend the case. The disks in the middle took me a long time to get out. I was really afraid I would brake them. I did not like the first movie. The picture is very clear and the sound is perfect. All in all it was worth the money. I will just transfer the disks to indivual cases. I bought the cases on amazon.,1426291200,3,450,3.7473684210526317
8574835,5,B00BWSM7AK,"I have only seen ""Mr. Soft Touch"".

It will not spoil the plot and will make it more enjoyable for you to know:

Glenn Ford owns a prosperous nightclub. The mafia takes over Glenn's nightclub by force; pushing him out without paying him anything. Unbeknownst to the mob; Glenn has a secret passage into the nightclub's back room. Glenn robs the nightclub safe; taking the mob's money from other rackets too; $100,000. The rest of the film is Glenn evading the mob. Glenn must stay in town one more day until his ship is ready to sail. Can he evade the mob for 24-hours?

A female social worker (Evelyn Keys) runs a large place that houses orphans and homeless adults and also operates as a community center for the poor. She has no idea her new poor client, a seemingly gentle and dimwitted man, who needs some guidance, is really a street-smart former big-shot, who knows how to make things happen; who is armed; who is carrying $100,000, and who is pursued by ruthless mob killers.",1388534400,,983,4.573863636363637
8574836,3,B00BWSM7AK,"Three of these Glenn Ford movies have little or no reason for existence in a package called ""Undercover Crimes. One was made when Ford and Rita Hayworth were rising stars who had yet to settle into their mature personae. Another was based on a property Columbia had already filmed better in the 1930's with Walter Huston as ""The Criminal Code"". The third can't decide whether it wants to be a gangster movie or a musical. Only ""Framed"" and ""The Undercover Man"" really stand out as authentic film noir or crime drama. How about TCM breaking these two titles out and selling them as individual DVD movies, much as they did with the three titles in their ""Dark Crimes"" package (Glass Key, Phantom Lady, Blue Dahlia)?",1371686400,12,713,4.712
8574837,4,B00BWSM7AK,"Did Glen Ford ever play an unlikeable character?  Even in some of the movies in this set, you gotta love the guy and root for him to win, even when he's a criminal such as Mr. Soft Touch and Convicted.  The latter has Broderick Crawford as a sympathetic DA, and later warden at a prison where wrongfully convicted Glenn has turned bitter. You'll even see him in third-place billing in ""The Lady in Question,"" where Mr. Ford is a nave college boy named Pierre, who is putty in the hands of worldly, Rita Hayworth. My reason for not giving the set five stars was the packaging as noted by others, the high price, and the lack of subtitles and extras.  Sorry, stills and trailers aren't enough if you charge this much, and TCM certainly has the resources to have a discussion about Glenn Ford, a film profile, perhaps studio promotional shorts, or even a commentary or two.  Still a good one to get if you like Glenn Ford.",1368662400,2,919,4.4523809523809526
8574838,3,B00BWSM7AK,"Movies are good, but Disc holding design is very poor, if the spindle system works, why change it. Sony needs to address this problem. The MR SOFT TOUCH disc has a heavy scratch on it  meaning an entire chapter is unplayable,. Problably caused at manufactures packing stage. Will be reluctant to purchase future Sony boxsets.",1367798400,,325,4.909090909090909
8574839,3,B00BWSM7AK,The movies themselves are not great.  This is a good buy only if you are an ardent movie fan and want to see some of Glenn Ford's early works.,1366848000,,142,3.896551724137931
8574840,5,B00BWSM7AK,just purchased the glenn ford undercover crimes dvd set from round and round-packaging excellent and got to see some relatively unknown ford movies none of which i had seen before-dvd quality is great and it arrived in perfect condition.at my door in 4 days -well before i expected and also included a personal thank you from roundandround which was a nice touch.they absolutely will get more of my business,1365120000,7,407,4.913043478260869
