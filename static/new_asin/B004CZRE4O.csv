8424293,5,B004CZRE4O,"Edgy film that captured the spirit of Nazi Germany & the perception of Jews & Allies at the time. The film, probably in an effort to placate the Hays Code, took some liberties with the original short story -- romance element (albeit brief), making the Jewish actress more heroic, as well as the protagonist's wife. Nevertheless, I loved the noir-ish effects.",1502496000,,358,4.885245901639344

8424295,5,B004CZRE4O,"PLOT: Americanized Paul Lucas goes back to Germany and becomes a Nazi~~

PRE-World War2~ Paul Lucas and Morris Carnovsky are both Germany Immigrants settled in San Francisco and co-own a very prosperous art gallery. Lucas and his family return to Germany for one year. Morris's daughter and Lucas's son were 'nearly' engaged but the daughter aspires to be an actress~ and she goes to GERMANY to be in the theatre~ She is also JEWISH~~~ Lucas's oldest son remains in the USA with Morris to run the art gallery. The BEST prop here ARE the LETTERS that Lucas and Morris exchange about their lives. WE see Lucas becomes slowly PRO NAZI under the 'influence"" of his Nazi friend ""The Baron"". The tone and friendship of the LETTERS ..CHANGE... as Lucas becomes even more die hard in his NAZI views. When Gizelle (the Jewish daughter of Morris) is denounced and runs to Lucas for help SHE IS TURNED AWAY...AND ENDS UP DEAD. When Lucas receives a TELEGRAM from America stating how ""they know the circumstances"" of her death and they will received CODED letters in the future. Lucas has his wife leave him and he LOOSES his cushy Nazi Job as a result of the ""censored"" letters which the Nazi's CENSORS believe is in SPY CODE~~ When EACH new letter arrives THE panic IN Lucas increases~ the POSTMAN rings the bell and the butler goes and gets the CLEARLY MARKED CENSORED LETTERS~ Lucas is excellent ~ because each letter brings him closer to becoming a ""victim"" of the Nazi's who MONITOR EACH LETTER. The Baron comes and WARN him to stop the letters and give them the ""code."" Lucas denies everything. Lucas realizes he is being WATCHED and cannot leave Germany~~~Lucas is a prisoner in his 'own home' ~ and the rain falls, and the letters continue to arrive. THIS is truly a VISUAL DELIGHT~ especially the scenes where the use of sun and rain create the mood and the changes in Lucas AND his life. Lucas is excellent as the ""driven"" Pro Nazi who is soon caught in the ""Nazi web"" and the PLOT IS FIRST RATE. I give this 5 STARS for plot alone, and for the excellent direction and visual feel of the movie. I had never even heard of this hidden gem but see it is one of Paul Lucas better acting roles and we enjoy every scene. His sweaty panic face looking out the BARS of his own home to the mail box are excellent. a MUST see for the noir lover.",1424736000,2,2334,4.491764705882353
8424296,3,B004CZRE4O,As an actor working on a play that was written from the original book by Kathrine Kressman Taylor by Frank Dunlop I was curious what the movie might have to offer. Turns out that Hollywood turned a masterpiece into a pretty obvious piece of American propaganda at the time 1944. The book has 2 voices Martin and Max. The movie has 15 voices (characters).,1385856000,2,354,4.546875
8424297,5,B004CZRE4O,"If you have ever wondered how a personal relationship was affected by the Holocaust, see this movie.  It is a short story told via an exchange of letters between two friends who are also in business together.  It is based on a book by the same name.  I had read the book sometime ago after locating it among my grandfather's effects and was very pleased to find the movie.  It enriches the letter exchange in the book by expanding the characterizations of the individuals mentioned in the book.",1368835200,3,494,4.579545454545454
8424298,5,B004CZRE4O,"Loved the movie.  Showed to a book group after we read the short story.

Got the video very quickly after ordering.  It was in perfect condition.  Thanks!",1365897600,,154,4.592592592592593
8424299,5,B004CZRE4O,"Beautifully told story of the horrors brought on by a charismatic leader and a really bad government. Also good character study of the effects of greed, fear and a needy personality. A little flattery and a lot of money have deranged people more completely than want or torture. The ending had a twist, but only if you hadn't been paying close attention.",1361404800,2,354,4.725806451612903
8424300,5,B004CZRE4O,"This is another in the ""Columbia Screen Classics By Request"" DVD-R series.  It's a great suspenser about a Nazi spy ring operating in the U.S. during WW2.  Director Menzies also worked as an art director on many great films, but had a mixed record as a film director.  This is one of his better efforts.  Great transfer, restored to near pristine condition by Sony.  I fear that this series of lesser-known titles from Columbia is failing.  They've recently taken down the ""Classics By Request"" area on the Sony Pictures site and I haven't noticed any new releases in the last couple of months.  Get these now before they disappear!",1307664000,6,632,4.743119266055046
