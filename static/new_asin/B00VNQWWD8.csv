8710676,3,B00VNQWWD8,"Upon seeing the rating and reading the review I was skeptical. Yes, the entire movie is from the first person point of view, but it's not too bad. I'm not saying it's the greatest, but it's also not the worst. You can pass the time with it.",1478822400,,240,4.127659574468085
8710677,1,B00VNQWWD8,"Hated the movie, it was more a documentary than a movie",1465171200,,55,4.090909090909091

8710679,2,B00VNQWWD8,"Perhaps I'll try this again at another time, but for now I just couldn't take it.  Seems more conducive to a live stage performance than a film.",1442188800,2,144,4.333333333333333
8710680,5,B00VNQWWD8,"I'm normally not a fan of films where actors speak directly to the camera, but ""Childless"" works well, to the point where it almost seems like a touching documentary. It doesn't hurt to have an A-list cast, either.

Rather than focus entirely on the sudden passing of a teenage girl, the film focuses on the four adults closest to her, as they examine their own lives and their relationship with the young girl, too.

These people are all somewhat self-serving and self-centered, but the story is sometimes humorous, too. Well acted and directed!",1433808000,2,546,4.860215053763441
