7975354,1,B00007E9EW,"I expected to see a a video made in the year 2000 as the release date suggests, not 15 year old footage. Save your money, this is a bad video. Yes there are some shots of La Paz and the Sea of Cortez, but only about 30 minutes of a lot of fishing. The rest is restaurant and hotel commercials. This would be ok if it where up to date stuff, but it is soooo old. Completely worthless if you want to know about the area, or plan a trip. I gave it one star because there where a few pictures of the town and the beaches, but who knows what the town look like now. The sound track is also poor.",1123286400,2,590,3.8442622950819674
