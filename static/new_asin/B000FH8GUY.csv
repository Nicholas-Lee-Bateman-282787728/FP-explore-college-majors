8313634,4,B000FH8GUY,"This movie is absolutely horrible. So why am I giving it 4 stars? Easy, it's a movie so bad it's good. The plot makes no sense, the animation is terrible, and this movie has taught me that arson is okay as long as it's committed by a monkey.

You need to watch this movie because it's unintentionally hilarious, and perfect for a bad movie night.",1402444800,,346,4.323076923076923
