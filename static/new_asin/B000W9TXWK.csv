8221950,5,B000W9TXWK,"I watched this documentary on the 6th anniversary of 911 and although I expected this film to be no different from the fear-driven, agenda-pushing documentaries that seem to saturate today's market, what I found was a sense of hope, courage, and unity among the people across the United States.

By the Side of the Road is one of the rare documentaries that tackles the aftermath of 911 from a very human perspective.  Don't expect any fluffs -- but instead, expect to be touched by what the fellow Americans experienced during and after the tragic attack.  This film captures a candid and surprisingly uplifting look into the minds of people across the county (and the world) who were, in their own unique ways, affected by the tragedy.  This film makes you feel like you're sitting on a  living room sofa (literally) with your friends and family, talking about the event that changed the world forever.

Watch the film -- you won't be disappointed.  I wish there are more films like this one around.",1194220800,,1001,4.784883720930233

8221952,5,B000W9TXWK,"Remember when one of your school assignments was to ask your parents what they were doing when John F. Kennedy was assasinated?  Well, bring that up to date and see what some Americans were doing when ""9/11"" became an indelible imprint in our minds, seeing the towers fall.  You will hear the honest (and very real) expressions from people across the US; you will cry when they cry; you may agree or even disagree with their views.  But one thing is for sure: you will admit that this documentary captures the essence of being human and suffering loss.  You won't be disappointed in the poignant reflections...",1191369600,3,610,4.726415094339623
