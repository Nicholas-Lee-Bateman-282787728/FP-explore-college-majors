8396877,2,B003H8F45S,"In America we are accustomed to a severely dumbed-down popular culture, and it is depressing to think Australian audiences would fall for this dopey, trite Queensland soap opera with its lame script, pallid acting and uncertain direction. The timeworn plot is overfamiliar: menopausal bullrider emerges from suburban rehab to make comeback final ride, breaks up with dweebish girlfriend and reconciles with bad-girl estranged wife (nicely played by Jordanna Allen in a very thankless role). It's tired, it's lame, it's very talky (in quaint Australian accents) and really not worth your time unless you really must see the (one) Australian Rodeo Movie.

The bullriding sequences are entirely too brief and completely without suspense, although for a change they are edited to conceal the use of stunt doubles. Buckle bunnies will note that Queensland bullriders evidently do not routinely compete in chaps (maybe this was a wardrobe budget issue), although they have wisely adopted protective helmets.

Some enterprising director (I guess it won't be Baz Luhrmann) could make a really smashing film (comparable to THE LUSTY MEN or JUNIOR BONNER) about the Australian rodeo circuit, a blue highway which is long, lonely and seldom lucrative. I can imagine Jon Cleary's THE SUNDOWNERS (filmed by Zinnemann) remade with the Australian rodeo road replacing the sheep drovers' nomadic tracks.",1391385600,,1387,5.446511627906977
8396878,2,B003H8F45S,"I basically kept waiting for some high quality footage of bull riding and I was still waiting when the movie ended. I can't really comment on its merits as a movie, as I wasn't really listening to the dialog.",1341360000,,208,4.358974358974359
8396879,5,B003H8F45S,"A Hell of A Ride is about a bullrider Steve Kelly who accepts a rematch with a bull,`Black Friday', the same bull that ended his career several years before. Steve also deals with the return of estranged wife Dannii. He battles the prospects of a fading career and the chance to love again.

The movie features Marcus Pointon, Jordanna Allen (gifted horsewoman, Sally Kelleher, David Barry (The Line), Mark Lee (Gallipoli),Tania Kernaghan in the role of Sally Robson and Cassandra Ryan. Also has beautiful Australian scenery and landscapes.

Music in the movie is by Australian country music stars such as Travis Sinclair, Carter and Carter, Fiona Kernaghan, Tania Kernaghan, Mark Lee, Larry Cann and Jamahl Hamilton and Aaron Daniels's Band etc.

""A Hell of A Ride"" was filmed in high definition and the quality is superb. The movie features some of the best bull riding shots ever filmed and has won four international film awards. I love this movie. It was very funny in parts as well. The whole family can watch it. I bought it for my collection. It will end up a classic like 8 seconds. You will love it.",1293148800,6,1109,4.765625
