8236148,4,B000ZOL492,"This is a soft-core film from the early 70s, when they were just starting to flood the market.  It is much better than the usual run of those films.  The script is intelligent and coherent, the characters have some dimension to them, and the actors are attractive, especially Peggy Church who plays the lead.  The acting is atrocious, but serves mostly to fill in the spaces between the sex scenes, which for the most part are well photographed and edited.  I could have done without the bondage/domination scene, but I know there is a market for those.

Released by the folks at Something Weird Video, this is a direct transfer to DVD-R from a videotape, so the picture quality is strictly VHS, but acceptably clear.  Recommended to fans of this genre.",1383868800,,753,4.709923664122138

8236150,3,B000ZOL492,"this would have been a 4 or 5 start rating but they simply cut out the real sex and I hate it!!!  We are adults and we have the right to view such things.  I enjoy classics and films of the era, but lets show it in its entirety uninterrupted!!!!  Let us as adults decide what we want to view and not.  Can anyone tell me how may I can this film with all the original uncut film is?  Please email me and let me know at viny14850@yahoo.com",1336608000,,437,3.9204545454545454
