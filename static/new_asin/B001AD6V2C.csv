8276831,5,B001AD6V2C,"This dvd arrived quickly and in excellent condition. Great service all around.

Francine York carries the script fabulously and looks great doing it. After this low-budget thriller always wondered why she never did more mainstream work. The plot has been done a thousand times and will be repeated, but Francine just looks better than most leading ladies and  even in slow parts of the movie makes great eye candy. A must see for people who like old hot rod and biker films of the 60s.",1382832000,,485,4.694117647058824
8276832,4,B001AD6V2C,"Moderately interesting exploiter featuring one of my favorite swingin' '60s chicks, smokin' hot Francine York (Space Monster, Doll Squad), and bottom-of-the barrel auteur Ray Dennis Steckler (Incredibly Strange Creatures, Thrill Killers), as well as a few other hangers-on from the Steckler/Arch Hall axis in the cast and crew. The time-worn plot of York and her ex-con hubby being kidnapped by a gang of hot-rodding thugs and forced to reveal the location of a stash of bank-robbery loot buried in the desert years earlier provides the framework for a lot of tough-guy bravado, a ""chickie run"", and even a quickly aborted attempted rape. Steckler's Preacher Man spouts ridiculous hipsterisms like ""insides-ville"" for ""inside"", Edmund Tontini defines ""wooden"" as the oddly named gang leader King Tut, and Jonathon Karle's ludicrous turn as psycho-nutcase Jick (who has his name in huge white letters on the back of his jacket) really makes you appreciate Arch Hall Jr.'s nuanced performance as Charlie Tibbs in The Sadist. There's a lot more talking than peeling out going on, and several of the sports cars are traded in for Jeeps halfway through, but I was mildly amused and never bored throughout.

But what really fascinates me about this movie are the number of parallels it shares with Russ Meyer's Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!, released three years later: 1) the Southwest desert location, 2) the arrival of the gang in three sports cars (and a couple of jeeps), 3) the search for a rumored hidden bankroll, 4) kidnapping of female by leather-clad gang, 5) murder of female's significant other by gang, 6) repeated escape attempts necessitating recapture of kidnapped female due to negligence of gang members, 7) the chicken run, and 8) even one specific library music cue that is shared by both movies! Much of this could be coincidence due to the clichd nature of the story, but I couldn't help noticing the numerous similarities to FPKK as I watched Wild Ones. Is it possible that Meyer saw this movie somewhere and thought, ""What if . . . ?"" We'll probably never know, but I just thought I'd throw it out there for exploitation fans to ponder.

Sinister Cinema's DVD-R of this movie is not spectacular looking (the contrast varies from shot to shot at times, apparently due to unequal processing of the A and B rolls used to print the film) but still quite watchable, far better than your typical Alpha Video transfer. I'd give it a ""B"". There is currently no other available option, so check out the Sinister site and order a few more titles while you're at it. Greg Luce is a great guy and is helping to preserve and disseminate hundreds of public domain movies that would never be seen by film fans otherwise, especially given the supremacy of the almighty profit margin by the multinational entertainment conglomerates.",1280275200,2,2835,4.9663157894736845
8276833,3,B001AD6V2C,"Being a fan of the late great Ray Dennis Steckler, I came across this on Amazon and gave it a shot. Not bad. Good for a lazy afternoon matinee. Early 60s hotrod flick that actually has more to do with a lost bag of cash. A gang of wild ones in souped up cars (and a jeep) show up at a lonely diner in the Mojave desert, looking for a convict released from prison. The goal is to beat the whereabouts of 240,000 out of him. The acting is cool, over the top and Steckler has a substantial role in it as The Preacher Man, with his Steckler trademark glasses, fur collared jacket and boots. He also gets the final gunshot in, but I won't spoil the details. Lots of jazzy music, jive talk,a chickie run in the desert,an old school diner in the middle of nowhere, good lookin 60s babes in jeans, tons of dust, some guns, switchblades, and a lizard...all in glorious B @ W.. This is a DVDr from Sinister Cinema...not a good copy, scratches...fade outs...short gaps...however, this being an obscure forgotten film, I would say this is the best you will get. The condition really ups the drive-in cred. For the price, not a bad deal....good way to kill an hour and some change....just don't go do a chickie run in the desert after you see it. You'll want to.....",1245369600,4,1253,4.358974358974359
