You need to be an Allo Allo fan to 'get it' at this late point in the series, but this two disk set is WELL WORTH adding to the collection.

If you have never seen the series, you need to begin in the beginning to build the plot of this, the most popular syndicated comedy of all time from the BBC..... YES, this series has larger distribution than Monty Python, Faulty Towers, Black Adder, etc.",1212883200,2,565,4.212962962962963

3104284,5,B0013D8LIQ,"Is seems like there was a long pause between this series and the seventh (it is explained in the bonus material) - the time has passed in the scenario, the actors look way older (those who made it to these shootings, unlike the 2nd reincarnation of ""It is I, LeClerc"").
The series contains less episodes, but the 1st one is quite long, almost a movie. The jokes are funny, some are new, and the Leutenant Gruber impersonation of der Fuehrer is unsurpassable!
The British airmen disappeared, so did the Italian Captain, but the Madonna is fully back and so is the 'ruthless' Communist Resistance.

The series is saturated with anticipation of the war end, that way (the French) or the other (the Germans), and as usual the Resistance is quite preoccupied with money, be it ransom from Germans or cash from Rene's till, all along with some futile attemps to do the Germans a real damage.
And, of course, there is a somewhat new for these series 'pudding club' plot, which ends to everybody's satisfaction (almost).

8250272,5,B0013D8LIQ,Comedy is to the individual taste. This to me is a good comedy series and its full of  nonsense and predictable jokes but I still laugh at it.  Its about a bar retaurant in France during the occupation  during WWII and the German military in this series is like that in Hogans Heros. Not too alert or wise but often corrupt as to what goes on around them.  The owner of the bar restaurant plays both sides to survive. He gets involved with the French undeground but not by his choice. He winds up helping British fliers shot down by the Germans to escape back to England.  But they cause him lots of heart burn with their antics. The SS is completely inept. If you watched Hogans Heros and laughed you will laugh at this series.,1509148800,,728,4.323529411764706
8250273,5,B0013D8LIQ,"""Allo Allo!"" Has been around since 1982 and has just recently become available in the USA on a decent media.

Basic story is of a caf&eacute; owner Ren&eacute; Artois (Gorden Kaye); this is in France during the WWII German occupation. He must balance dealing with the local Germans, the Gestapo, the good Resistance, the commie Resistance, having affairs with his female help, dealing with his wife and mother-in-law.

In series six the fun does not stop. However you see some different people. A few of the originals are left. Fun as this is, one can tell that they are running out of ideas and in desperate effort to keep up the energy go a little over the deep end even for ""Allo Allo."" And surprise Edith (Carmen Silvera) can really dance.

One nice thing about this series is that they place the name next to the actor at the end of each episode. Most of the actors are well known out side of this series. I was shocked however to find that Gestapo Herr Otto Flick (Richard Gibson) Played British Capt. Newman in Ken Follett's ""The Key to Rebecca"" (1985) and completely changed his accent.

I think the only issue I have had is one of the DVD's with this set did not work at all on any of my DVD players, but I got another disk and it works okay. Aside from that minor issue, Allo Allo is really a funny and quite entertaining show to watch! I have grown very quickly to love this show. It takes place in a small French town in German-occupied France during the early to mid-1940s/WWll era. Great cast, lovely ladies, great story plot and really a funny show to watch.
