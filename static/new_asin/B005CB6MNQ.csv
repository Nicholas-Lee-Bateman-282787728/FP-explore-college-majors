4652439,5,B005CB6MNQ,ADORE this selection of classics - over half of which books we had from our now 33 year old son's childhood. I ordered new and used copies of the  ones we didn't already have and gave all 23 books with this DVD to our 2 and a half year old grandson for Christmas. The read along feature is superb and many of the stories are enhanced with music and sound effects. Awesome companion for the books.,1420416000,3,396,4.2105263157894735
