2077734,1,B0002CX1M0,"To a viewer from New Jersey. It's a bit strange to call the other reviewers ""psychotic"" and then to start shouting(using large letters)in your review. It's also strange to attack their rating by telling them that ""they haven't seen it yet"" when you give it a five star rating without having seen it.
The other reviewers have the facts through information posted on various science fiction sites about this set. This information states that The Night Gallery DVD set,unlike many other TV shows,will not be remastered and will come from a 15 year old copy of the series.
One viewer that thinks they have been recently remastered because he saw it on the Mystery Channel is incorrect. The print that he saw was the old print of the series. There was an attempt to convince the company to do a new remaster when new cleaned up samples of a few scenes were shown to them and compared with the old versions of the scenes. Even thought the improvement was plain to see,they did not approve a new remaster of the series. It has also been confirmed that this set will not have any extras,like documentaries and interviews with producers,writers and actors as other TV shows DVD sets have.
This is not good enough for the fans of this show and they have a right to complain about that.
After all,this show is hosted by science fiction legend Rod Serling and features the directal debut of Steven Speilberg directing Joan Crawford in one of her last performances.
I think that at least deserves a small documentary and of course Rod Serling deserves one as well. With todays technology of plasma and high definition television sets,a DVD set made from and old print(with spots and scratches)is not good enough.",1088553600,21,1699,4.723905723905724

2077736,1,B0002CX1M0,"I have been very angry about this matter for a very long time, and I feel can temper my utter disgust adequately now, so here goes...  If this superlative and unique anthology of the obscure and slightly disquieting aspects of Man's inner fears is not given the A+ treatment, then it is, simply stated -  the equivalent of Wal-Mart mass marketing a designer Van Gogh athletic apparel line; it's just STUPID.  The sad thing is, given the cultural spiral we seem to be in, that just might SELL.  Rod Serling deserves a HECK of a lot better, and so does the buying public.

2077737,1,B0002CX1M0,"Respect for Mr. Serling please Universal!  Here we go again.  After all this time waiting for a DVD release of the series ""NIGHT GALLERY.""  Here we are with another fine mess.  I agree with everyone's comments and think Universal needs to rethink what they are doing.  The staffers at Universal should do more research on this kind of Genre.  First of all, extra features are essential for a classic release like this.  What the point of being on DVD otherwise, especially since most of the fans of this series are people over 35 who remember this series from the first time it was shown.  I saw a few of these on video and was disturbed to find that some were actually episodes from the series ""The Sixth Sense"" which was a good show on its own.  That kept me from buying them on video.  But Universal pulled a fast one and tried to make those episodes look like part of the Night Gallery series.  Shame on Universal and they should know that fans don't like when their favorite classic TV shows are messed with.  CAN SOMEONE PLEASE START A PETITION TO UNIVERSAL TO RECTIFY THIS MESS?",1086998400,20,1085,4.479591836734694
2077738,1,B0002CX1M0,"Like the other reviewers who have posted here, I too am incensed by what Universal has done to legions of ""Night Gallery"" fans.  I have to wonder if anyone over the age of 30 gets involved in the decision making process when it comes to releasing vintage TV series like this; just look at what happened to the ""Kung Fu"" season 1 release.  I encourage everyone to sign a petition available on nightgallery.net",1086739200,11,408,4.575342465753424
2077739,2,B0002CX1M0,"I'm a new fan of Night Gallery and I enjoy the show immensely.  Since I have recorded most of the shows, a DVD with no extras and cut up syndicated versions does not appeal to me.  As has previously been said, it is utterly unconscionable that Universal would release something so haphazardly and expect consumers to buy it en masse.  Don't get me wrong, I love Night Gallery and would gladly stand in line to buy the set with a high quality transfer and extras, but this release, unless Universal changes their minds, isn't the one I'd stand in line for (excuse the prepositional ending).  Sadly, the irony is that if this release doesn't sell, Universal may pull the plug on future seasons (as fans, we should let them know how we feel).  I hope Universal sees the light and realizes that people want to get their money's worth.  Not only this, I hope Universal understands what a wonderful series Night Gallery is and that as such it deserves to be preserved with the highest quality transfer and all the additional content they can muster.",1086652800,22,1043,4.610810810810811
2077740,1,B0002CX1M0,"Universal Studio is on its way to release second-rate and dirty copies of the last valuable anthology ever made: ""Rod Serling's Night Gallery"" (season 1) and moreover, without any extras. It's a disgrace that Universal acts like small-time racketeers and force people of good will to purchase a cheap product. Over the years, this particular Studio has gained a bad reputation because of its blatant ignorance and lacks of professionalism towards the exploitation of its patrimony. Vintage shows deserves a better treatment and high respect. ""Rod Serling's Night Gallery"" is not an average item, it is the last link of a lost art. Think about it... Think hard!

2077741,1,B0002CX1M0,"Universal has done it again...they've screwed up another one of their releases.  ""Night Gallery"" was the last TV work of that master of the teleplay, Rod Serling, and deserves to be seen in all it's original pristine clarity.  Using 1991 masters is not acceptable, since HDTV is here and DVDs show every little scratch.  Demand that Universal show this series the respect it has earned by releasing it as it should be seen.

2077768,3,B0002CX1M0,"I love old anthology suspense/horror TV series, from ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS, through TWILIGHT ZONE and THRILLER, on up to OUTER LIMITS.  Yes, they could be clunky and awkward, and the special effects were usually laughable by our 21st century standards, but they all have two redeeming virtues: (1) they depended on the strength of the writing to catch and hold an audience; and (2) if you run into a real debacle of an episode, it'll all be over in a few minutes and you're on to the next thing.

NIGHT GALLERY was Rod Serling's second attempt at an anthology series.  The premise is clever: Serling hosts the show from a macabre museum filled with truly awful art.  Each piece tells its own horror story.  The lengths of the individual stories vary, from just a few minutes to a half-hour or even longer.  The episodes of the show had an average of two or three stories per week.  This is a short collection, so the series' first year must have been as a mid-season replacement.  As I recall (having been in grade school at the time), late 60's-early 70's TV was pretty abysmal for a kid, overloaded with sit-coms (what else?), detective and doctor shows, and I remember looking forward to NIGHT GALLERY every week.

The main question is, how well does it hold up all these years later?  Well, it's a mixed bag.  The pilot is pretty good, and I still remember being a kid, watching the segment featuring Roddy McDowell and ""The Cemetery,"" conveniently located just outside his front door.  From there, the track record gets spotty.  Too may episodes were written by Serling, who was no doubt a great talent, but by this time in his career irony seemed to be his formulaic solution to every plot. The stories aren't very horrible, but they're mostly ironic.  The other standouts in this collection are ""The Dead Man,"" which I thought was based on a Poe story, but was actually adapted from a Fritz Leiber story; ""The Little Black Bag,"" which I immediately recognized as an adaptation of C.M. Kornbluth's classic story; and ""The Doll,"" adapted from a story by Algernon Blackwood.  Serling's best story in this collection, which incidentally dispenses with the irony, is ""They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's Bar,"" which may be the best segment in the entire season.

It was good to watch some of the old segments I remember from decades ago, but the pleasure was mostly nostalgic and not dramatic.  I hope season 2 really gets up and runs with the show.",1465516800,2,2452,4.704918032786885

2077783,3,B0002CX1M0,"Primarily I was just thankful this got released. The picture and sound quality are acceptable but nothing to write home about. There was clearly no remastering done here and there are some minor errors regarding music cues that happened. This set includes the series pilot as well as all 6 episodes from season one. Unfortunately the shows offered here do not include the NBC  ""Four In One"" bumper that immediately preceded each broadcast of season one (for season one Night Gallery rotated with three other series on NBC including ""McCloud""). The show was not done justice during its original network broadcast run. It was done even crueler injustice in syndication, and this DVD set merely perpetuates the pattern. Season one was the most solid and consistent season of NG in terms of quality; although this was more easily achieved with only six episodes and for that one season, NG was uncontaminated by producer Jack Laird's comedic vignettes, that were more of an homage to Love American Style than classic horror. Further, for all intents and purposes they are no bonus features here, just a few segments from seasons 2 and three. Night Gallery included some of Serling's best work. The Pilot and They're tearing down Tim Reilly's Bar are some of the best episodes that television has produced. Thankfully, these issues were later rectified with DVD releases of seasons 2 and 3. Look to find Season One used or on sale (I paid $5 for it at Half Price Books), and pick up seasons 2 and 3 if you are looking for some nice bonus features.",1447027200,,1542,4.796992481203008

2077816,5,B0002CX1M0,"Autumn leaves swirl across the forlorn landscape.  The mansion sits, waiting for something to happen within its walls.

The nephew (translation: heir) says: ""I have spent a good deal of my life acquiring a taste for the good life, but somehow never acquiring the means.""

The butler says: ""How sad, sir.""

It's safe to say the nephew (translation: heir) and the butler aren't buddies.  Welcome to Night Gallery's opening story, ""The Cemetery.""

Night Gallery is widely considered Rod Serling's ""other"" show.  Night Gallery (1969-1973) has suffered drastically from being compared to The Twilight Zone (1959-1964).  Certainly, The Twilight Zone is a great series.  It's a landmark show in the history of American television.

I like Night Gallery better.  It's fascinating; it's morbid; it's quirky.  If The Twilight Zone was weird, then Night Gallery takes it a few steps further.

Wes Saylor, in his interesting review, ""A Less Sentimental Corner of The Twilight Zone,"" says: ""Night Gallery was just scarier.  The Twilight Zone tended to deal in sentimentality and parables--and while it's a great show, the Night Gallery decided to forget the lesson and go for the scare.""

I don't entirely agree with that statement.  Night Gallery makes me think, more than most shows ever have.  Saylor is spot on, though, on two points.  Yes, Night Gallery is morbid, and yes, The Twilight Zone can be preachy.  I believe a weakness of The Twilight Zone is that sometimes Serling does too much explaining.

On Night Gallery, Serling speaks in the beginning, just as he does on The Twilight Zone.  Unlike The Twilight Zone, however, Night Gallery does not have Serling speak at the end--and I like that better.

During its original run, Night Gallery had a major cut following.  In the days before VCR, fans made 16-millimeter tapes of the episodes.  Students at colleges like Harvard and Yale formed Night Gallery viewing clubs.

I didn't see Night Gallery during its original run.  I first discovered it on Retro TV in the Fall of 2009, when I saw Joanna Pettet running toward a mysterious house, with weird music playing in the background.  I remember thinking, ""That's the '70's.""

Critics say Night Gallery is dated.  I say, ""Yes, it is.""  It's full-scale 1970's, and as a child of the '70's, I count that as a major plus.  Critics say it's erratic.  I say, ""Yes, it is.""  That doesn't detract at all, because Night Gallery is always an adventure.

Each hour-long episode gives us two or three stories.  Night Gallery historians call them ""episode segments.""  Season One has seventeen episode segments.  These are the 5-star classics:

""The Cemetery""-- The scenery, the atmosphere, and the tension are amazing.  Roddy McDowall is great as the nephew (translation: heir), but Ossie Davis steals the show as the butler.

""Eyes""-- Joan Crawford excels as the bitter blind woman who will do anything to be able to see.  Tom Bosley does a great job as the stiff who's willing to accommodate her.

""The Little Black Bag""-- Time travel, medicine, and the motives of the heart are what this one's about.  Burgess Meredith stars as a disenfranchised doctor who finds a little black bag....

""The House""-- Joanna Pettet plays a young woman driving to a large house in the country.  She's only seen it in her dreams, but she knows exactly where to find it.  Like ""The Cemetery,"" the scenery and the atmosphere are excellent.  I didn't rewind one time--and for me, that's unheard of.

""Make Me Laugh""-- It made me laugh.  It made me shake my head.  Godfrey Cambridge stars as a down and out comedian in this 1970's tragicomedy.

These episode segments are very good: ""The Dead Man,"" ""The Doll,"" and ""They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's Bar.""  There are some other good ones, but I've identified the top eight.

Richard Ryberg Adams has written a fun review, ""Second Season Much Better.""  Adams says: ""Don't dismiss Night Gallery until you've seen its brilliant second season and the best of the third season.""  My response to that statement is: ""Au contraire ! ! !""  Season One is the only season I've finished so far, and I'm telling all my family and friends about it.  Don't dismiss Night Gallery until you've seen the entire first season.

Night Gallery has already taken its place as my second favorite show of all time.  Season One is a fun introduction to the series, and you should absolutely get it.",1423180800,8,4386,4.88843537414966

2077836,5,B0002CX1M0,"Night Gallery...where does one begin?  For those like myself (or older) who grew up in the 70's, little explanation as to who Rod Serling was should be needed.  Likewise, his creations such as Twilight Zone and Night Gallery require very little introduction. For those thrill seekers of younger generations however, a few words may indeed be in order...while Twilight Zone is still something of a household name, these days Night Gallery receives a bit less notoriety.

Perhaps the best way to think of Night Gallery is as a collection of ""short stories"".  Each episode typically contains 2 or 3 stories or mini episodes, although some are longer (or shorter) than others, with each episode introduced as a painting by Rod Serling...""a nightmare captured on canvas"".  To say that Night Gallery was something of a ""reboot"" (to use modern vernacular) of Serling's more classic and more recognized Twilight Zone is quite an inadequate analogy.  While Gallery shares many similar themes with TZ, particularly that of science fiction and the macabre, in this reviewer's opinion Gallery was rather darker with a considerably larger creep factor.  While TZ had a tendency to cover many ideas and not all of the episodes where horror related, (ala ""Mr. Bevis"" and ""Cavender is Coming""), Gallery tends to stick more with the macabre (even when they're poking fun at it). Unlike so much of modern horror that relies on shock value and hack & slash brutality, so much of which modern audiences have been rather desensitized to,  while it does have moments here and there, Night Gallery tends to be a bit more cerebral.  Instead of trying to terrify viewers with blood, guts, gore and chainsaws, Gallery is the type of viewing that tends to seep into one's subconscious to abuse the viewers imagination, similar to the way Hitchcock had a tendency to do.  It's the kind of viewing that can still give a few folks nightmares, not so much because of what they saw on the screen, but because of the seed that was planted in the back of the brain.

As a person who still remembers when this show first aired, for me personally it still maintains much of it's potency.  Is it a bit dated?  To see actors like John Astin still in his prime, the answer to that would have to be something of a ""yea...probably"".  For modern audiences who've had their imagination utterly beaten into submission by the likes of Steven King, John Carpenter and Wes Craven, Night Gallery may not have the edge that many people today seem to expect from a good creep fest.  The feel of the series over-all is more akin to that of The Shining...except without a crazed Jack Nicholson bursting thru the door with an axe.  There tends to be a somber, almost ethereal feeling to Night Gallery that's most fitting for the content. For those of us with a taste for such entertainment, Night Gallery is still one of those series that's best viewed at 1 in the morning, under the covers with the lights out and a bowl of popcorn, while you're half asleep (which isn't intended as an insult in ANY way!).

The cast of the various episodes, is a veritable ""who's who"" of 60's and 70's actors.  Joan Crawford, Roddy McDowell, John Astin, Tom Bosley, Sam Jaffe, Burgess Merideth, Diane Keaton, Larry Hagman, Agnes Moorehead, John Colicos, Ray Milland, Charles Laughton, David Carradine, Patty Duke, Cesar Romero, Lindsey Wagner ...even Vincent Price and the great Bela Lugosi  and even Orson Wells pokes his head in for a voice over...the list is rather impressive to say the least.  Likewise the production values were also quite high, particularly considering that this was an era long before the extensive use of green screen and CG.  Visually the episodes still stand up rather well when one factors in that these were shot in the early 70's. ..scenes with ""computers"" for example still had those big ol' spinning reel to reel tapes, as apposed to the average laptop one sees today.  Don't expect to see an Ipod or Smart Phone here...people used rotary phones and still dialed up the operator back then!  That said, while a bit subjective I think there is an element to Night Gallery that modern productions lack as well.  Because CG hadn't really been invented yet (beyond the likes of Godzilla and Ray Harryhausen that is) the directors and producers used a degree of imagination...the use of slow motion and unusual camera angles for example...to build suspense and enhance the visual quality of the story telling.  There was an art to television production back then that some could argue has been lost in recent decades.

The quality of this DVD set is, in my not so humble opinion, superb.  I've seen a negative comment or two regarding the preservation/restoration of these episodes, however I must say that the quality FAR exceeds that of the day when my father had to fish the UHF antenna (metal coat hanger) around on top of the old Zenith 19"".  In this case, I would simply offer people a sense of perspective...sure stereo CD's don't sound as ""awesome"" as HD 7.1 surround sound, but then they still sound a far sight better than the scratchy old 78's that my grandparents would listen to on the Victrola!  In this case, on my 27"" crt at least, the colors are crisp, vivid and sharp and the sound is excellent.  While this set does include the original pilot episode, don't expect a great deal as far as ""dvd extras"" go...it's not like Serling was doing Peter Jackson style blogs back in the early 70's and you won't find many (any) commentaries on this set.  These are however the original versions of the episodes (as I remember them at least) as apposed to the utterly hacked versions that later appeared in syndication.  For any fan of Rod Serling or Night Gallery, that alone makes this set a must have for the collection.

I'm not going to go too much into the individual episodes themselves as there's PLENTY written about that already...if you really need a spoiler or two, they're not hard to find on the internet.  I will say that like virtually every tv show ever produced, some episodes do stand out more than others.  Obviously even Twilight Zone had a few klunkers and certainly all the greats from The Honeymooners to Star Trek and onward have had at least a few episodes here and there where people will sit there, scratch their heads and ask, ""What the hell were they thinking???"".  On the other hand, episodes like ""The House"" can still leave the viewer a bit creeped out (one I still remember from the early days) and here over 40 years later, such episodes still stand up well. That said, I don't think Night Gallery had any truly ""bad"" episodes...even ""Pamela's Voice"" had a certain comedic factor that has to be appreciated.  Like Twilight Zone and every other tv show, there will always be a few favorites and a few that were just ""ok"".

Finally I will say that Night Gallery, like Twilight Zone, being a rather specific genre, along with being a tv show from the early 70's, is likely to appeal to a fairly specific audience.  If Disneyesque is your thing, even today Night Gallery may be a bit disturbing.  If you crave the mindless, redundant slash and gore of Craven, you could be a bit disappointed.  If you don't really know what ""macabre"" actually means, you may not get it.  If however you're like me and grew up on the legend of Rod Serling and still enjoy those good night frights, then this collection is certainly a must have and should bring back many pleasant...and somewhat disturbing memories :-)",1402531200,8,7497,4.73097617217525

2077842,5,B0002CX1M0,"I always thought of Night Gallery as the second generation of Twilight Zone. This show is pretty similar to Twilight Zone in that it mixes the supernatural with Sci-Fi and suspense. Rod Serling had supposedly starting planning Night Gallery as early as 1964 when TZ was cancelled. Is Night Gallery as great as TZ? No, but it's a great ""second coming"" if you will. Night Gallery opens with Rod Serling describing each story with its own unique painting, which usually has to do with  something in the episode.

Season 1 is relatively short, containing only 6 50-minute episodes. The picture quality leaves a bit to be desired, as the picture is a bit scratched in some parts and colors seem a bit weak sometimes. The audio is relatively quiet so just turn your TV volume up nice and loud for this set. The Universal logo appears before each episode and it BLARES in comparison to the show's low volume.

The only sort of ""bonus features"" are some bonus stories. I'm not sure if these were unaired or just taken from other seasons, but they they're on disc 3 after the 6th and final episode of the season. Also included on Disc 1 is the original 1 and 1/2 hour Pilot film filmed in 1969.

Overall, the episodes appear complete though the quality isn't exactly as great as it could have been. Is the set worth 20-some dollars? I'd say not. I'd say its worth more along the lines of $10-15 as you don't get very many episodes. Nevertheless, I'd DEFINITELY add this to my collection for Night Gallery being the great show it is.",1393891200,2,1523,4.547445255474453

2077855,5,B0002CX1M0,"These Night Gallery Season 1 DVDs contain amazing, often thought-provoking stories and feature superb performances by superstar actors / actresses. They have the suspense of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, but often with an added supernatural / occult twist. Also by comparison, the episodes feature high quality acting as in The Twilight Zone, but without the frequent sci-fi / outer space elements. Also, unlike Alfred Hitchcock Presents or The Twilight Zone, these Night Gallery episodes are in color instead of black and white. Although I don't mind black and white film, the color format of these DVDs is especially enjoyable because it helps the viewer appreciate the vibrant clothes, cars, and interior dcor of the period (1970 / 71). The Night Gallery stories are thrilling, sometimes scary, and often poignant, without the excessive ghoulish / horror / macabre aspects of, for instance, Tales from the Darkside, or awful special effects of Outer Limits. Although there are 20 stories in this collection of 3 DVDs, there are multiple stories per episode. Each episode is approximately 1 hour, so the total run time of all the included material is less than 9 hours (and I believe this includes the bonus material, which seems to be stories from Season 2, which are available in the Season 2 release).

Still, it's fantastic to have this. And kudos to the producers for including the excellent pilot, which starred Roddy McDowell, Ossie Davis, Joan Crawford and Richard Kiley in three separate stories.

2077865,3,B0002CX1M0,Has anyone noticed the opening and closing credit music on this first season set is not the original Gil Melle classic? The music was part of the NG mystique. This bland synthesized replacement pales and alters the intentional hypnotic tone the opening visual montage of paintings established.

2077866,5,B0002CX1M0,"There is no doubt in my mind that Rod Serling was and will always be the greatest writer television has ever known. ""Twilight Zone"" which ran from the late 50's through the mid 60's set a standard for quality tv. There were many classic episodes, in which many of them were written by Serling himself, that brought science fiction to a whole new level on tv. In the early 70's Rod Serling came out with his next contribution to quality television, ""Night Gallery"". ""Night Gallery lasted only three seasons but what a three seasons it was. Not realy so much a science fiction show like TZ was. ""Night Gallery"" was I always thought more along the lines of horror and the supernatural. Like TZ however NG is thought provoking, imaginative and inspiring. It stands out like a beacon of light among the blandness and mindnumbing crap that is known as tv today. As a writer Serling wanted to entertain but at the same time he wanted to make people think as well. He wanted to bring the viewers of the show not just to another place full of fantasy and wonder but to get the viewer to open his or her mind and explore possiblities. To challenge what they thought and believed in. Not to try and show the viewer that their beliefs were wrong but to show them that beliefs are endless, boundless and not to be afraid to expand them. To be open to other thoughts and beliefs. If you never saw ""Night Gallery"" I highly recommend getting it. You will not be disappointed. If like me you remember growing up watching this series then don't delay getting this. The box set not only includes all the original episodes from the first season, it also includes the pilot movie that got the series started. I will also add as someone else did in their review of this box set I am disappointed there are no special features included. I can't complain too much though. At least they finally got ""Night Gallery"" released on DVD.",1319932800,,1906,4.511560693641618
2077867,3,B0002CX1M0,"Although he wrote and directed numerous programs, Rod Serling (1924-1975) is best recalled as the creator of the television series THE TWILIGHT ZONE, which debuted on CBS in 1959--and which, in spite of continued critical and audience popularity, fell prey to network politics and budgeting issues and was canceled in 1964.  Serling continued to work, but it was not until 1969 that he contemplated a series once more: NIGHT GALLERY.

NIGHT GALLERY began as a ""feature-length"" NBC television special in which Serling, in a dimly-lit museum, introduced three gothic and irony laced stories that incorporated paintings in the story line.  The three stories were ""The Cemetery,"" starring Roddy McDowall and Ossie Davis; ""Eyes,"" starring Joan Crawford in one of her last roles and directed by newcomer Stephen Spielberg; and ""Escape Route"" starring Richard Kiley and Sam Jaffe.  All three stories were written by Serling.  The program was very well received, and in 1970 the concept of an anthology of such stories became part of a ""wheel series""--several continuing series that rotated through the same time slot over a period of several weeks.  In this instance, the other rotating series were MCCLOUD, SFX, and THE PSYCHIATRIST.  The latter two were canceled after the first series and both NIGHT GALLERY and MCCLOUD went on to become stand-alone series, and NIGHT GALLERY continued through 1973.  During its later run it went from an hour to a half hour, and during later syndication its various episodes were edited and reshuffled to a point at which is actually difficult to know when each episode was filmed, when it was first aired, and whether or not it was later edited to a point at which it could not be fully restored.

According to various records, the 1970 season included six episodes and a total of fourteen stories, each episode containing from two to three stories.  Although NIGHT GALLERY was thought of as ""horror,"" it would probably be more accurate to describe it as in the ""weird tales"" tradition, and many of its stories included a significant sense of humor.  Each program opened with credits in a memorable ""box tunnel"" style, and Serling himself--again appearing in a dimly-lit museum--would introduce the various stories by way of a painting.  Unlike the original pilot, the painting themselves rarely figured in the story that followed, but instead indicated the nature of the story in a symbolic sort of way.  With three exceptions (""The Dead Man,"" ""The Housekeeper,"" and ""Room With A View"") all scripts for the first season were written by Serling, and the program was notable for casting a mixture of established stars (such as Burgess Meredith, Agnes Moorehead, and Raymond Massey, to name but three) and rising notables (such as Larry Hagman and Diane Keeton, to name but two.)

The first season of NIGHT GALLERY was particularly noted for the episode ""They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's Bar,"" directed by Don Taylor and starring William Windom, Diane Baker, John Randolph, and Bert Convy--a strange story in which an alcoholic executive finds himself slipping between the past and present as he bemoans the loss of the good old days at the corner bar.  Other notables include the darkly humorous ""Pamela's Voice,"" starring John Astin and Phyllis Diller in a darkly comic take on heaven, hell, murder, and eternity; and the genuinely creepy episodes ""The House"" and ""The Doll.""  But although NIGHT GALLERY had definite high points, it was always an uneven show, some stories less effectively presented than others--possibly because no two episodes ever seemed to have the same director.  The result is often entertaining and sometimes amusing, but it is also very 1970s, very safe, and occasionally slow and slightly boring.  It was a situation that would drive Serling to distraction, and although Serling continued to act as host and to write for the series, Serling became less enthusiastic about the series in the second season and virtually disowned in the third.  NIGHT GALLERY ain't no TWILIGHT ZONE, no where near the level of quality that series achieved, and it is probably best left to hardcore Serling fans and those who recall the series fondly from its original run.

The Universal DVD release of the first season includes three DVDs.  The first DVD includes the original and seldom seen pilot and the second and third DVDs round out the season's shows, with the third DVD offering ""bonus"" shows from later seasons.  The series has not been restored, but although many have decried this, I have to say that it doesn't look or sound bad: there's no significant streaking, no noticeable artifacts, and the sound elements are quite good.  Recommended for fans.

It's dark & gothic & very atmospheric, & not to mention bizzare. My taste in TV shows/movies in those genres are rather weird but that is just me! If your'e into that, this DVD collection is 4 you. I alredy have Season's #1 & #2 in my DVD library & I'm waiting 4 Season #3 to be released-hopefully soon.

The first season includes the TV pilot, the entire first season and a few bonus shows from the 3rd Season which has not been released by Universal.  It is highly recommended because of the watchability of the show and the fact that you can watch it more than once, which makes it a great value.

2077873,5,B0002CX1M0,"I remember being a nine year old kid and watching this show with my parents: if you think that was young, my brother and sister sat there, too, at the ages of six and four, peeking through their fingers at Serling's post-Twilight Zone offering. Then Dad and Mom couldn't understand when the school would call the next morning and tell them that we were all asleep in class, having admitted to not having gotten much rest the night before. Well, without getting any further into my parents' obvious lack of child-rearing skills, yep, this would be terrifying to a young child, especially back in the early 1970s' and pre-Freddie Krueger, etc. Is it terrifying, now? No. But you have got to put this show next to the Granddaddy of All Shadows To Live In, and you know that TZ is gonna win. NG is not without its' own charm, however, and now, as an adult, I found this first season interesting in many different ways. Firstly, as just noted, it stands for a different time in American culture when there wasn't the ability to order SAW-like movies right into our own living rooms; and, of course, we can now Blu-Ray ourselves into a stupor as we hit 'previous scene' again and again, to catch every bit of blood spatter. NG not only had to clear the FCC of forty years ago, but it had to tell a story in a very short amount of time as effectively as possible. If you think about it, that's exactly what TZ did - and when Rod came into this, I think he came in with two strikes against him. Everything was going to end up looking like an imitation of TZ, and nothing was ever going to be as good. If you think about it, the new millenium bunch of us have that attitude, now, when we look down our noses at sequels to movies...And so, knowing the less shell-shocked viewing audience of the 70s', knowing that Rod and Company were doing their best not to just crank out a TZ clone, etc., I think that this show still holds up. The twist to Joan Crawford's ""Eyes"" is legenday, now, but that doesn't take away from it having been a great episode then, and a classic one, now. I love ""The Cemetery"", with Roddy McDowall as a murderous nephew - he plays his role with such obvious delight that I wonder if he really made Serling pay him for the work -, and ""They're Tearing Down Riley's Bar"" is simply brilliant. Spooky? No. But brilliant as a study on the human being's longing to hang onto anything that will keep things from changing, going too fast, leaving us - behind. A couple of the episodes are, as a previous review notes, bluntly, unwatchable - but, again, there are a few TZ eps that I see on my box collection, shrug, go ""Eh,"" and put something else in. I know that this sounds like a half-hearted endorsement for the show, but it isn't...it's a reminder that Zone was the first of its' kind, and NG is a full decade later. Rod's writing is still strong in most instances, and the acting is, like in any anthology series, hit and miss; I am glad to see these episodes cleaned up and uncut, by the way. In closing, if you want to see what was considered as edgy as Serling could get with the networks forty years ago (more than one episode was originally shown with advisory to content, I believe the Pamelyn Ferdin one, and the Richard Thomas/cannibalism one - neither on this season), pick this up. Then go back to Freddie, Saw and all the rest, and be honest: Who will you still remember 30 years from now, Jigsaw or the TZ Man that started it all????",1287792000,9,3456,4.376360808709176
2077874,2,B0002CX1M0,"I had memories of Night Gallery, being very creepy, but unfortunately, Night Gallery is just a weakened version of Twilight Zone. The writing is simply not good at all, Rod Serling must have been at his creative ends, I don't know, but the episodes are not creepy at all, have no moral lesson, just awful. One particular episode "" A matter of semantics"" is so awful, it's almost appears like it would a sketch on SNL or something. The episodes are like ideas that were never really thought out. The acting is completely ridiculous, why does everybody have an english accent-even if they're not english? it's like that overacting tone of voice typical of B-shows back in teh 60s and 70s. I was really disappointed. My advice is to remember Night Gallery-the way you Thought it used to be. Let it maintain that mysterious place of your childhood memories. Don't ruin it by buying this and realizing how bad it really blew. Maybe teh second season was different? i'm not going to risk paying almost $40 for that again.",1277337600,3,1015,4.675977653631285

2077881,5,B0002CX1M0,"After the Twilight Zone went off the air, Rod Serling hosted an even more unique psychological thriller series, called The Night Gallery. I fondly remember this show. I really looked forward to staying up late to see it, on Saturday nights back in the early 70s.

Serling hosted this show from an art gallery each week. The gallery was filled with all sorts of macabre paintings. And when Serling introduced each episode, he also referred to a painting in the gallery, which closely conveyed the character of that particular episode.

One of the most intriguing things about this series, was that each hour-long show was broken up into several vignette-like episodes. And each separate episode, had no relationship to the others, that were shown during the weekly hour of The Night Gallery. Any given episode, would last varying amounts of time within the hour time-frame of the show. It was shear genius to run these various different episodes, within the same hour. No other drama series, then or now, had been formatted that way. This factor kept the show fresh and interesting, and no doubt held the viewer's attention.

Though The Night Gallery focused primarily on the psycho/emotional distress of the characters in each episode, there are also elements of horror thrown-in. The horror factor in the show, was not too gory or overpowering. So The Night Gallery was a scary show, that parents could let their youngsters watch, without exposing them to lots of bloody violence.

2077887,5,B0002CX1M0,"Finally, after nearly four decades, you can enjoy Night Gallery in its original form, instead of that bastardized version Universal has been peddling to TV ever since.  There's no stock-footage padding or editorial butchery here, no Sixth Sense episodes masquerading as Night Gallery stories...just the episodes the way you remember seeing them on NBC.

I'm going to take a bit of exception to the majority who appear to be panning this DVD set and acknowledge that yes, there are only six episodes in the first season; yes, there are no extras; no, the shows haven't been restored.  But the inclusion of the pilot movie and a few second- and third-season episodes makes up for a lot of that, as does the aforementioned opportunity to see the episodes in the form in which they originally aired.

You never see the pilot movie on TV anymore, so it's a joy to behold here.  The format is only slightly different from what TV fans remember, with a different theme and score by Billy Goldenberg, who did not go on to do the series.  It's unfortunate, because his music works well here.  Also, the opening credits are quite literally sketchy, which is different from how they appeared on the TV series.

Also slightly changed:  the paintings are on easels, covered with red drop-cloths until Rod Serling lifts them to introduce each story.  And -- this is important -- the paintings literally figure into the stories.  Presumably this motif was not continued throughout the series (with a few exceptions) for obvious reasons:  every episode can't somehow involve a work of art.

As for the stories themselves, they are very good.  The first one, ""The Cemetery"", is a sort of a modern ghost story, with murderous Roddy McDowell being spooked by a painting which keeps changing.  The denouement is slightly cheesy in a Tales from the Crypt sort of way, and if anyone can't identify the person walking through the house at the end of the story, he's got to be blind.

Much praise has already been heaped on ""Eyes"", the second story, so I won't even go there, although I will say that the story's ""twist"" is a little hard to swallow.  No situation such as the one depicted could realistically pass for blindness.  More than that I will not say, since I'd spoil the ending for you.

The final story returns to one of Rod Serling's favorite themes:  Jews and the Holocaust.  ""Escape Route"" features an ex-Nazi looking for a place to hide from the Israeli secret police, and, unfortunately for him, he finds it.

Then we move on to the series proper, and the introductory painting, ""The Dead Man"", gets the series off to a whiz-bang start.  Based on a story by Fritz Lieber, it's a tale in which an audacious scientific experiment falls prey to base human emotion.  Some may guess what the twist ending will be, but that doesn't make it any less entertaining or scary.

Season 1, of course, also features the more familiar theme by Gil Melle, as well as some of the entire series' best episodes, including ""The Doll"" (a precursor to Chucky, and arguably scarier); ""Certain Shadows on the Wall"", a ghost story with a different kind of ghost; ""The Lone Survivor"", a new take on an old legend; ""Pamela's Voice"", a macabre/wry short story about murder and just desserts; and of course ""They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's Bar"", which was yet another one of Serling's whimsical fantasies about a man yearning to return to his past.  Robert Prince's music underscores the episodes perfectly, though this music seemed to vanish with the advent of season 2.

Overall, season 1 was the high point for the series.  Season 2 had many of its own charms, but it was also more uneven, with a greater quantity of mediocre stories and, need we mention it, the much-derided comedy blackouts.

Rounding out the DVD is a season 2 episode which has a decent assortment of spooky tales.  Leaving out the silly ""A Matter of Semantics"", two others, ""The Diary"" and ""Big Surprise"", generate some nice surprises and shivers.  The last story, ""Prof. Peabody's Last Lecture"", unfortunately falls on its face, wasting a great performance by Carl Reiner in what is essentially an extended comedy blackout.  It's a shame to see such a nice buildup leading to an ending which would look more at home on a bad episode of Lost in Space.

Finally, there are two episodes from season 3, ""The Return of the Sorcerer"" and ""Whisper"".  The latter is entirely forgettable, with Dean Stockwell breaking the fourth wall to give the audience a languid narrative performance that just doesn't work.  Nor is the tale particularly original.

""Sorcerer"", on the other hand, is a corker.  Based on a short story by Clark Ashton Smith, it tells the tale of a young man hired to translate Arabic for a practitioner of the black arts, only to be terrified when he finds out exactly what it is he's translating.  Scripter Halsted Welles added a new character, Fern, a woman who is a lot more ""complicated"" than she at first appears to be, and for once, such a brazen departure from the original story actually pays off handsomely, enriching the tale by adding new layers and texture without changing its intent.  The final scene, a black Mass, is a series high point in its staging, acting and music (by Eddie Sauter).  Even Vincent Price's slightly hammy acting works here, and with the exception of a couple of unnecessary dubs (""For power!""; ""The woman is insatiable!""), everything clicks on every level to make this story wonderfully creepy, as well as one of the best realizations of Lovecraftian horror done on either the big or small screens.

Unhappily, this was also a high point for season 3, which quickly became moribund and directionless.  Interestingly, the composer of the raucous, discordant third season theme song is mentioned nowhere...possibly at the composer's request.  (It may have been Sauter, but it doesn't specifically say so.)  At any rate, it's a shrill piece that is a disappointing departure from the more subtle theme of seasons 1 & 2.

Overall, what you have here is a nice, albeit short, introduction to the series, featuring some of the best stories it ever told.  The only thing I would really complain about is that even with the pilot and a few bonus episodes, the DVD set is not worth the roughly $50-60 asking price.  The set is more reasonably priced in the $35-40 range, so if you find it new or used at that price point, grab it, and enjoy once again the image and voice of Rod Serling leading you through his dark museum.",1230940800,2,6499,4.751336898395722

I also recommend ROD SERLING'S NIGHT GALLERY: AN AFTER-HOURS TOUR by Scott Skelton and Jim Benson offers 390 plus pages of behind-the-scenes critical analysis and facts with exclusive interviews with cast and crew.

If you are a fan of Twilight Zone, another book of equal caliber if not better is THE TWILIGHT ZONE: UNLOCKING THE DOOR TO A TELEVISION CLASSIC by Martin Grams is 800 plus pages and includes ""everything"" about the classic series. The details about Serling's writing career on radio, early television and Twilight Zone is well researched and highly detailed. Exclusive interviews with cast and crew and behind-the-scenes trivia will floor you.

2077900,5,B0002CX1M0,"In 1969, years after Rod Serling's ""The Twilight Zone"" had gone to that ""other dimension"" in the sky, the prolific writer returned to the airwaves with an NBC tele-movie entitled ""Night Gallery."" The film featured a trio of horror stories, each connected to three paintings, respectively, displayed in a creepy art gallery, and revealed by Serling himself. A stellar cast that included Oscar winner Joan Crawford, Roddy McDowall, Ossie Davis, Barry Sullivan, Sam Jaffe, George Macready, and Broadway star Richard Kiley was matched in the direction department by Boris Sagal (""The Cemetery""), Barry Shear (""Escape Route""), and an up-and-comer by the name of Stephen Spielberg (""Eyes""). Adding to the terror is a superb score by music vet Billy Goldenberg, who would go on to score Spielberg's award-winning tele-flick ""Duel.""

Because of the ratings success of the film, NBC gave the go-ahead for a full series based on the premise introduced here.

This DVD compilation features the pilot film along with all the installments of the first season and they, too, present some of the best stories ever shown in a horror anthology format. Outstanding entries include the spectacularly eerie ""The Dead Man,"" the amusing ""The Housekeeper,"" the flesh-crawling ""The Little Black Bag,"" and the poignant ""They're Tearing Down Riley's Bar."" Poetic justice is served in these three exemplary tales, also: ""Certain Shadows on the Wall,"" featuring a quartet of great character actors,"" ""Clean Kills and Other Trophies,"" and ""The Doll.""

The ""bonus"" stories, taken from the second and third seasons, pale in comparison but are still worthy of watching.

Perhaps, Universal could have added some true ""bonuses"" (director/actor commentary, production info, and the like) but the show is not remembered for that aspect of its airing.

The show is the thing and ""Night Gallery"" was one that, for the most part, delivered some thought-provoking chills during the early 70's.

While it was gratifying to finally have something on DVD, I felt that this particular group of episodes lacked a sufficient lasting impact.  More importantly, I was reminded (and still believe) that the First Season is not nearly representative of the series as a whole.

As one will learn by reading synopses of epsisodes aired throughout Night Gallery's entire run, a great array of different ideas, themes, and creative surprises would be showcased each successive season.

It has been said that the second season contains the majority of the more memorable episodes.  And I would hazard to say that seasons 2 and 3 contain more horror/psychological subject matter, for those who gravitate toward that sort of thing.

It isn't scary, creepy, or ingenious, only mildly eccentric. At its best it manages a slightly macabre edge, but mostly it comes across as a low budget mediocrity. I was disappointed, and can't for the life of me figure out why this used to terrify me back in the day.

I guess to a teenager in 1970 it was a great thrill to watch a true genius like Rod Serling.  However, after more than 35 years the magic is gone.

I hadn't seen these Night Gallery epidsodes in close to 30 years and some only once.  They had definitely left a strong impression, but I thought they couldn't be as truly memorable as  say an episode of The Twilight Zone...  could they?

I was actually surprised and quite pleased to find that these episodes of Night Gallery, as a whole, were throughly deserved of the place they held in my memory.  I watched them with my children and they thought they were good as well.  I even warned them about what I thought was the absolute worst episode of all, ""The Nature of the Enemy"", which is in this collection and we even got a great kick out of it.

@@@ SPOLIER WARNING @@@

Now, after all these years, I can finally appreciate that ""awful"" episode for what it was truly intended to be: a parody!  It certainly wasn't clear when I saw it as a kid.  I just remember me and my parents just groaning at the end of that episode and just saying how stupid it was.  Even now, the earnest acting and dead pan delivery give no presage or hint to the absolutely silly punchline visual (I still get the impression that Rod Serling snuck this one in as a lark).

I do remember more than a few bad Night Gallery's during the series' run (and there are stinkers to be sure, like the one with the gorilla and Steve Forest, Artie Johnson as the DJ hounded by hell, the one about the diner and people who don't know what they are doing in it, etc.) I only found ""The Lone Survivor"" in this group to skirt that category.  The rest are engaging and actually quite good, better than I remembered.  I am half hoping that the one's I consider ""stinkers"" from other seasons today might actually turn out to be decent episodes now that I am more mature.  I hope we get the chance to see them in future DVD releases.

This is a recommended set.  While I find the DVD layout a bit awkward and the quality of the video and audio to be a tad mediocre, the stroll and re-discovery down memory lane was well worth it.  I would have liked to seen at least still images of the portraits from the episodes in an interactive ""Night Gallery"", maybe with actual pictures of the cast and production team.  Oh well...

I am sorry that Rod Serling did not regard this series too highly.  He was probably being overly critical and disappointed with this lack of control.  While not as iconic as Twilight Zone, Night Gallery does hold a well earned spot in the history of genre.

NOTE: I watch ""Professor Peabody's Last Lecture"" from time to time -- being a big H.P. Lovecraft fan -- and find it a total hoot.  It is a loving spoof of Lovecraft's Chthulu Mythos.  It is practically indulgent and quite scholarly, if decidedly irreverent in approach.  Just seeing the names of the elder gods on the blackboard behind Carl Reiner cracks me up!

@@@SPOLIER ALERT@@@@

The crazy thing is that I remember ""They are Tearing Down O'Reily's Bar"", an episode I believe garnered Rod Serling an Emmy (or at least an Emmy nomination) as being really negative, and that the main character ended up staying in the bar seduced and surrounded by his memories and actually dying, killed as the bar was being demolished around him -- a real downer.

2077917,4,B0002CX1M0,"First, the good news.

Rod Serling's ""Night Gallery,"" which ran in three different formats on NBC from 1970-1973, has weathered the years quite well. Like Serling's earlier and more revered ""Twilight Zone,"" this anthology series was a hit and miss enterprise with some stories clinging to memory like a spider's web and others quickly forgotten, but many of ""Night Gallery""'s tales, as many as four in an hour long episode, are as memorable as the best tales from Serling's earlier triumph.

The two hour pilot, first presented as a ""World Premiere Movie"" in 1969, is included here and it set the tone for the series. While ""Twilight Zone"" emphasised science-fiction, ""Night Gallery"" had its roots more squarely in the horror genre. The show seemed to have been as strongly influenced by Hammer Studios' colorful and frequently lurid theatrical features as it was by ""Twilight Zone."" Though the pilot is now best known for providing Steven Spielberg with his first professional credit (in the supebly directed ""Eyes"" segment starring Joan Crawford), it's the Boris Sagal directed opener, ""The Cemetery, "" with Roddy McDowell and Ossie Davis, and the Barry Shear helmed closer, ""Escape Route,"" with Richard Kiley as a Nazi war criminal mesmerized by a painting of a fisherman, that still send a shiver up the spine.

The series itself debuted in the 1970-1971 season as a segment of ""Four In One,"" an umbrella title for four Universal produced series (""McCloud,"" ""San Francisco International Airport,"" and ""The Psychiatrist"" were the others). That season's six episodes, each an hour in length, are included in this three disc set, and include some forgettable stories, such as the Spielberg directed ""Make Me Laugh"" with Godfrey Cambridge as a failed comedian, but there are gems here, too:

""The Doll"" is a creepy Algernon Blackwood yarn adapted by Serling with English character actor John Williams as a British colonel at war with an evil, curse-ridden voodoo doll; ""The Little Black Bag"" is another keeper with Burgess Meredith as a disgraced doctor turned wino who stumbles upon a time traveling medical bag whose contents can conquer any disease. A delightfully perverse Chill Wills matches Meredith's superb performance; ""Certain Shadows On A Wall"" is a quaint little tale of murder with Louis Hayward, Agnes Moorehead, Rachel Roberts, and Grayson Hall; ""The Dead Man"" features famed acting coach Jeff Corey (a frequent director on the series) and ""Donna Reed Show"" alumnus Carl Betz giving masterful performances, along with sexy Louise Sorel, in a macabre tale of a doctor's dangerous experiments gone awry; and ""They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's Bar,"" an Emmy nominee for Serling's script, is memorable for once more exploring Serling's favorite theme of a man haunted by a more joyous past and for veteran character actor William Windom's heartbreaking performance.

Thankfully, season one was mercifully free of those silly ""blackout"" sketches included at producer Jack Laird's insistence, and to Serling's disappointment, during season two.

A plus and minus of this set is the inclusion of three ""bonus"" episodes, one from the second season and two from the show's third and final year when it was cut back to a half-hour. The plus is that it represents more bang for the buck. It's a minus, however, in that it hints at Universal's apparent disinterest in giving seasons two and three the same multi-disc treatment.

And now, dear reader, what is the bad news?

As other reviewers point out, the quality of the original shows is the only attraction here. Except for those bonus episodes, there are no extras which makes the disclaimer superfluous (""The views and opinions expressed in the interviews and commentaries...yada, yada, yada""). Then there's the quality of the discs themselves. Like too many DVDs from Universal, the discs, at least the ones I have, occasionally skip or freeze, a problem I also experienced with their set of ""McMillan and Wife"" discs. During ""They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's Bar,"" the picture froze and no amount of fast-forwarding would let me proceed to the ending. This could be a isolated flaw unique to my set, or it just might be Universal's idea of anti-theft protection. Maybe it's the fault of ""Deluxe Digital"" or ""Macrovision Quality Protection"" whose logos appear at the end of each episode. These little advertisements are immune to every button on the remote. Hit ""Next,"" ""Forward,"" even ""Reverse,"" and they refuse to budge. It makes for an unpleasant Orwellian experience. Equally annoying is the monotonous inclusion of Universal's current, rather amateurish looking logo, complete with its loud musical bombast, at the start of EVERY episode. If the logo had actually appeared when the shows were first broadcast, I wouldn't mind, but they didn't so I do.

Serling and ""Night Gallery"" deserve a minimum of four stars, but Universal could have done a better job with this set.

2077918,3,B0002CX1M0,"Season one of Night Gallery contains a few decent episodes ('The Black Bag', 'The Dead Man', 'Certain Shadows on The Wall'), and of course the fine pilot film for the series ('The Cemetery' being my personal favorite within the trilogy), but it is Season Two that contains many of the series classic episodes, to include 'Sins of The Fathers', 'A Question of Fear', 'Green Fingers', 'Pickman's Model', 'A Fear of Spiders', 'The Devil is Not Mocked', and of course 'The Caterpillar'.  For Universal to release season one with a few 'tack-on's' from seasons two and three is the ultimate insult to the serie's fans.

PLEASE UNIVERSAL RELEASE SEASON TWO....(season three, on the other hand, was an almost complete wash, as Serling had already distanced himself from the show except to host).

Do the right thing, Universal...give us the best this classic series had to offer.",1157414400,15,872,5.0
2077919,5,B0002CX1M0,"These DVDs are NOT edited and the picture quality is good! It is the hour-length versions of the show--NOT the half hour versions shown on TV. These DVDs couldn't possibly have been watched by anyone complaining about it.  There was bad rumors going around before this was released that unfortunately have stuck around the internet in some places.  As far as the show,  this is a great horror anthology series!  I was a little reluctant at first to buy this because I didn't remember it that well from when I was a kid, but it has really good stories like the Twilight Zone, except in a horror setting instead of a sci-fi setting.",1155254400,12,630,4.548672566371682
2077920,3,B0002CX1M0,"I sometimes think that NBC/Universal Home Video is the Anti-Warner Home Video. That is, they are a home video company that does a stellar job at giving its classic titles tragically shoddy treatment and ignoring their fans.

This is not as bad as their ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" release, which, in many cases, simply doesn't work. That's ignoring the fact that it is an edited version of the show taken from very bad prints.

Still, it is pretty darn awful. Universal has a wealth of special features for this show just sitting at their feet. There is a retrospective documentary made for TV about the show, there are a whole bunch of lectures by Serling given to Ithaca students about the show that could serve as audio commentary, and for pete's sake, would it be too much to put a gallery of the PAINTINGS on the DVD? Let alone show complete versions of the episodes...

But I digress. Universal is terrible, and I think most people who are avid TV on DVD followers know that by now from experience.

As to the series itself, suffice it to say that it is, for the most part, a delightfully spooky (and occasionally funny or even meaningful) follow-up to ""The Twilight Zone"" for Rod Serling. Although he did not have the creative control he had on ""Twilight Zone"" in ""Night Gallery"", his distinct dramatic spirit shines through in all of his scripts. His three scripts for the pilot movie add up to what is, in my opinion, quite possibly the best movie ever made specifically for Network TV.",1153699200,9,1495,4.651515151515151
2077921,5,B0002CX1M0,I don't know what people are talking about. It does have the pilot. It's a great series... maybe a little pricey.,1153440000,7,113,4.428571428571429
2077922,5,B0002CX1M0,"Oh, yes. It is nice to finally have this on DVD. My first experience with ""Night Gallery"" was when I saw a re-run of the pilot on WOR Channel 9 from New York in the late 1970s or early 1980s. I remember being horrified, particularly by the first of the three stories called ""The Cemetery,"" with Roddy McDowell and Ossie Davis. It wasn't until years later, however, when I finally saw some of the season episodes. I believe I saw them on the Sci-Fi Channel and let me tell you, the picture quality was extremely poor. The episodes looked like they had gone through the ringer.

But they are all restored in this release of the first season, which also features a handful of episodes from the second and third seasons. It would be nice if Universal released the final two seasons on DVD, but for some reason that doesn't appear like that will happen any time soon.

Anyway, if you are a fan of this series, by all means go out and buy it. If you've never seen it before but enjoy anthology-format television fright shows, take a chance.",1146441600,31,1034,4.436842105263158

2077924,4,B0002CX1M0,"I had never seen Night Gallery.  I was born after it went off the air and it isn't shown widely in syndication.  In any case, I've never seen an episode.  Having been a fan of Twilight Zone and Rod Serling, I was interested in watching it, even though I'd been warned by other reviews that it wasn't up to ZONE and, in fact, ultimately wasn't under Serling's control.  When you buy something like this, you have to put yourself in a time machine and travel back to the era when the piece was made.  They didn't have all the fancy special effects and production elements that are available today.  They also didn't have the production budget with which a sitcom of today (with one static set) would be equipped, let alone an anthology series that never uses the same set twice.  That means that the show had to rely on the talents of the writers, directors and actors involved.  What you have here is a representation of an era of acting and camera work that has passed into history.  I enjoyed the series for its rich tones, layered performances and raw honesty.  This was an era of entertainment when you didn't have to be cookie-cutter beautiful or handsome in order to work as an actor.  Straight, white teeth are not a requirement to do solid work.  This anthology showcases actors and performances that a regular person can relate to.  The writing varies from piece to piece and there are certainly moments in each story where you may feel it goes over the top.  However, if you really examine it, that's the case with a lot of visual performances.  As we continue to make advances, movies that were cutting edge ten years ago may seem to pale in comparison to something created today.  Of course, you may feel that only true works of art remain timeless.  I would argue that some pieces have to maintain an existence in the time-period in which they are created so that we can benchmark our progress and, just as importantly, look back to see what the older pieces did better.",1143417600,17,1982,4.538028169014084

2077927,4,B0002CX1M0,"I have to agree with the reviewer who admitted they enjoyed Night Gallery more than Twilight Zone (it's not an either/or situation.  Both can be loved ... it's just that the Night Gallery might have been loved a little bit more).  I also agree with the primary reason: Night Gallery was just scarier.  Twilight Zone tended to deal in sentimentality and parables - and while it's a great show, the Night Gallery decided to forget the lesson and go for the scare.  I watched this show when I was a kid, and when those paintings started flying under the credits, the tension-level was already up.  Many of these stories are just mirror-image reworkings of old Twilight Zone stories.  Many will recognize, say, Zone's 'Eye of the Beholder' in the Gallery ... only this time with a guy and much more graphic make-up. -- The picture quality of the DVDs surpasses what I saw as a kid (on a 12-inch, black and white TV).  There are no extras in season one and that's a shame because Night Gallery invites the same kind of curiosity that the Zone did.  It would be nice (maybe in season two) to see some interviews and ect.  However, the boxed set does include the pilot episode and that is good news.  But the best news of all is that this highly enjoyable show has finally made it to DVD.",1137110400,11,1281,4.459227467811159
2077928,4,B0002CX1M0,"The pilot contains the best episode of the show, in my opinion, ""The Cemetary."" The Joan Crawford episode holds up well although the premise is a little silly (you can see with one eye, after all)and Spielberg has done much better work since. The rest of the shows are spotty-- some really good, others contain too much comedy relief, others are too predictable. All in all, however, this set represents one of the high marks in TV sci-fi/horror series, and needs to be released in its entirety. Picture/sound quality were fine. No extras on disc besides chapter selection.",1136505600,,573,4.857142857142857
2077929,5,B0002CX1M0,"I'm going to really rouse the indignation of a lot of people by saying that I enjoyed Night Gallery far more than Twilight Zone.  I just ordered Season Five of of the Definitive Edition of Twilight Zone and I have the four previous seasons, so obviously I am a fan of that show as well.  I've enjoyed re-watching those episodes quite a bit and I highly recommend them.

But Night Gallery is a little darker and more sinister.  Even the beginning photo montages and music are scarier, weirder, with an authentic occult quality to them.  When I was originally watching these shows I was about eight/nine and I remember worrying that my religious mother would not allow me to watch Night Gallery if she understood how truly morbid it was.  I loved it! This is good, genuinely creepy stuff.  I love the paintings in the Gallery at the beginning, and when Rod Serling--one of the truly captivating characters in 20th century history--comes out and gives his mystical introduction.  Whether Mr. Serling was suffering from health problems or some other issue, I'm not sure.  In my view, his heavy and serious vibe only added character to the show.

I collect horror films and Night Gallery is absolutely vital to any such collection. Like Hammer House, like Vincent Price, like Dracula and Frankenstein, Rod Serling's Night Gallery is a classic of macabre which will endure for generations.  To any person reading this who was involved in the production of the show, my deepest thanks for creating something so captivating and imagination-inspiring.

I found the picture and sound quality of Season One to be absolutely superb.  Just like when I saw it on TV so many years ago. Or maybe better, because we didn't get such great television reception with that big old antennae in Evergreen, Colorado back in those days! But the question remains: when do we get the balance of the seasons???  I check almost weekly and I'm bummed every time I see no update.",1135987200,12,1948,4.793413173652695

Dialogue from this show STILL haunts me from childhood, as when a woman, leafing through oil-painting portraits stacked against a wall in an art gallery says something like,""These people are all dead, it's like looking at tombstones in a graveyard""--so unexpected, such a different viewpoint!!!

And the episode where a man is driven mad in the street by the roars of non-existent wild animals-this freaked me out so much that I became afraid to visit the zoo-I didn't want those sounds in MY head! LOL!!

So come on, embrace Night Gallery for what it is and continues to be, a campy frightfest, like the series Night Stalker or One Step Beyond! Speaking of OSB, I just bought the Volume 1 DVD and enjoyed it immensely. It shares a campy quality with the aforementioned series; in the episode ""The Affair,"" Veronica Cartwright (of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" & ""Alien"" fame) does her best runnaway-bride-buggety-eyes-acting to creep everybody out!",1120608000,9,1075,4.994413407821229

Although earlier shows such as ""Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits"" still hold up for me, Night Gallery does not.  The pilot episode is the strongest, but it goes downhill from there.  The themes that had been thoroughly worked over in Twilight Zone are rehashed with the heavy hand of a tired Rod Serling, hands tied by a paltry budget and a network that didn't really want the show to succeed.

There are a few good moments, but Serling himself was very unhappy with the results (according to Marc S. Zicree's ""Twilight Zone Companion"").  It's not hard to see why.  Even a highly praised episode like ""Tearing Down Riley's Bar"" is heavy-handed and overly theatrical.

The DVD quality is mediocre.  The picture is flat and lifeless, the audio equally one-dimensional, and there are no extras to speak of.  I may not love the show as I did back in the day, but it deserves to be presented in the best possible format, and assessed on its own merits.

Fans of the show will strongly disagree with me about the quality of the stories; but I think everyone's disappointed with the DVD.

2077938,4,B0002CX1M0,"Rod wanted Night Gallery to do well, the networks on the other hand didn't. They gave him a miniscule budget to work with, (Which explains a LOT of repeat scenes and ""Borrowed"" scenes, such as the spaceships from the movie ""SILENT RUNNING"" (with Bruce Dern) to get a point across in one of his episodes about an ugly ""Earth Boy"" who turns out to be a ""Beauty"" from another planet"")Episode title: ""THE DIFFERENT ONES""

I used to watch this show on Sunday nights, after ""Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom"", ""Disney's World of Color"" and right before ""The NBC Mystery Movie"" featuring either MCloud, Macmillan and Wife, Columbo, or Hec Ramsey""

The budget for this show was minimal and Rod was angry about that, he WANTED it to be as good as TZ, but the budget he was given by the network was next to nil. Fortunately he made do..Unfortunately, the show didn't look so good, and I think that's EXACTLY what the network wanted.

I'm sure after the Twilight Zone, he carried a bit of clout, but the networks were tired of the ""scary"" genre, but had no choice but to appease him, so they made it tough by giving him a tiny budget.

Fortunatley Rod was able to make some damn fine scary episodes for NG that have haunted me since I was 10 years old. The most memorable episodes being ""The Dead Man"" (campy over-acting, but I was 10, it scared me for a long time). ""The Doll"" this gave my sister and I and unending war against each other (When she wasn't home, I'd paint one of her scariest dolls face, just like the episode, and sit it up in her bedroom so when she turned the light on.......hehehhe) (But there were several times when I came home to that damn doll sitting on MY bed with that Mascara, just staring at me too LOL!!!)The other Scary episode was ""The Cemetary"" I watched all of these episodes on a black and white TV with rabbit ears up in the hills of Vermont, so I have NO complaints about the picture quality. To me the picture quality is pristine, compared to what I actually saw on the TV at the time.

When the series came on the Sci Fi channel, I watched eagerly, but was soon disappointed because I knew the SCI FI network was cutting out a bunch of stuff just to cram commercials in, which I thought was ridiculous in the first place, because the show was already made to fit a half-hour with commercials to begin with.

Plus most of the time the SCI FI channel was showing those crappy ""Sixth Sense"" merger episodes with Gary Collins....LAME!!

I DEFINITELY won't buy NG if or when it starts getting into the ""Sixth Sense"" merger with Gary Collins as the ""Psychic Detective""

Well, hopefully on this new DVD the show will look visually better than in old tv reruns. One can hope. The show has very solid storlines as far as plots. The monster makeup can be campy in certain segments. However the paintings seen as Serling introduces the eps are always interesting and scarey. This show has Adam West of Batman fame as a guest once and that is very good indeed. He should have been on The Twilight Zone as well.",1112745600,,553,4.485148514851486
2077940,4,B0002CX1M0,"I hate modern Television.  For every quality show like ""The Wire"" and ""The Sopranos"" (both on cable you notice) we have to suffer through ten recycled sit-coms and forty reality shows.

""Night Gallery"" continued the trend of originality from Rod Serling, who was, clearly, ahead of his time.

The show itself has been covered here pretty well by other reviewers so I'll skip that part.  As far as the discs go... are they perfect?  No.  The lack of extras as compared to the recent release of the ""Definitive Twilight Zone: Season One"" is a sore spot on this DVD release.  However, the image is pretty darn sweet looking.  And the fact I am able to have these uncut and unfettered episodes in my DVD Library is a good thing.  I no longer have to wait for the Sci-Fi Channel to have a marathon or a special holiday weekend something or other.

I encourage all parents to buy these classic shows (""Twilight Zone"", ""Night Gallery"", ""After School Specials"", ""Land of The Lost"", ""The Outer Limits"", et al) put them in their DVD Library and show them to your children when they are old enough.  In the meantime, LIMIT what they see on TV now because 98% of it is dreck.

It's a wonderful time and I know my children are seeing and enjoying something we'll never see again -- quality and creative programming made by intelligent people for intelligent people.",1106784000,20,1472,4.615384615384615
2077941,3,B0002CX1M0,"It really helps to have had affection for this show in the first place.  I remember watching it as a kid and enjoying it.  At the time, it was probably the creepiest show you could see on regular TV.  When I saw the set on DVD, I really wanted to check it out...to see if the ""thrill"" was still there.

TV has come a long way in the intervening decades.  We've seen far gorier stuff, far more titillating fare, and so forth.  But so often we think that the ""good old days"" were better.  That sometimes in horror it's what you DON'T see that scares you, that good acting and writing don't age.  And with this set, we see that there is SOME truth in this.  There is some good (not great...the shows were thrown together too quickly for that) acting, and occasionally some good writing or at least some lofty social agenda to comment on.  But I think one of the things that the modern era HAS improved on is pacing.  I don't mean the jittery jump cuts, hand held urgency, relentless, rock-music driven speed and so forth (which is sometimes good and sometimes bad...as with almost any trend in film/TV making).  What I mean is the desire to just go ahead and tell the darn story.  Most of the tales in NIGHT GALLERY really don't need to be more than 15 minutes long.  Take the story of the on-the-lam Nazi war criminal who desires to escape into a haunting painting he sees on a museum wall.  That story, which is not a bad one at all, takes FOREVER.  Sometimes the length taken to tell a story gives us a chance to see the ending coming.  Something faster paced just sweeps you away and when the ""surprise"" comes, we haven't known it was looming.

So, NIGHT GALLERY is a mixed bag.  Some fun ideas and some really great opportunities to see some performers at the EARLY parts of their careers (Larry Hagman is particularly funny...a mix of Tony Nelson and JR Ewing...with a beard!) or in the waning years (a terrific Joan Crawford.)  So that's fun.  But if you're hoping to get ""creeped out""...forget it.

And the complaints you read here about lack of extras...I agree.  There are no extras.  No little documentary.  No bio of Rod Serling...nothing.  How hard would it have been to at least talk to a few people who worked on the show to see what they thought about it?  And the picture is okay, in my opinion, but you can tell it's a sorta careless transfer.  Little flecks pop up from time to time.

It's fun, but flawed.  Probably won't mean much to anyone who didn't enjoy them originally.",1106524800,7,2492,4.4131868131868135
2077942,4,B0002CX1M0,"I tend to agree with many of the positive and negative statements made by most and have come up with a brief conclusion.

* The picture quality is very good for an early 1970's television show. Viewing on a good widescreen TV (32-52""), the quality is surprising well transferred to DVD. I was pleasantly surprised after all the negative statements made by reviewers since the show is over 30 years old. There is very little difference in audio/video quality compared to shows such as MASH, Sanford & Son and even popular late 70's television box sets.

* There are some excellent & corny episodes and is definitely not to ""Twilight Zone"" script standards. BUT, if you are a fan of Rod Serling influence, this is well worth the money. Episodes such as ""They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's Bar"" make it worth it and it is fun to see some past television stars and character actors in others.

* The menu is poor. It would have been minimal effort for them to organize this collection better.

* Adding the movie pilot was terrific. No additional bonus extra's were a big disappointment.

I am very happy I purchased this set. I was a big fan of the show when it originally aired and am grateful this is available. I hope the 2nd season comes out and that Universal gives the DVD a little MORE RESPECT.",1104883200,12,1296,4.545064377682404
2077943,5,B0002CX1M0,"Thank you Universal for releasing this wonderful DVD. The Night Gallery has haunted my memory ever since I first viewed the series as a child, and from beginning to end this DVD does not disappoint.

I am very pleased with the audio/visual quality of this release. I viewed the DVD on a 52"" wide-screen projection TV, and the image quality was crisply cinematic.

The included episodes are uneven in terms of content/quality, but I suppose that is the charm of the original series. Some of the episodes have a cheesy ""Twilight Zone"" style punch-line conclusion, such as ""Make Me Laugh,"" which I don't care for. However, even the clunkers feature fine performances from long forgotten performers such as Godfrey Cambridge (from the above example).

I particularly enjoyed the more open-ended and ambiguous episodes such as ""The House,"" which I found to be a fine representation of stylish and subtle 70's horror, ala the classic movies ""Let's Scare Jessica To Death"" and ""Burnt Offerings.""

The goal here is to create a spooky mood of dread and apprehension rather than shock the viewer with gross-out tricks.

2077944,4,B0002CX1M0,"I bought this dvd set the day it was released, and the best word to describe the set is adequate.
 I was really happy to hear that they were releasing this series on dvd(the episodes in syndication were horribly butchered in editing to fit them into half hour segments) .
 The transfers are good(not great)but the real gem is the is that the pilot movie is included with the set.
 The biggest drawback(in my opinion)is that there are no extra features(How about including the documentary ""The Art Of Darkness""that ran on the Mystery channel as an extra?)but if you're into just watching this series for the episodes,then this'll do fine.
 ***I'd like to add that this series is entertaining,but the reason that this series dosn't have the same type of quality as Rod Serling's Twilight Zone, is that Rod was NOT a producer, and had very little(if any)control over the quality of scripts/script selection(that was up to Jack Laird)
 -Rod was getting older and didn't want the hassle and grind--but he thought that since his name was on the show that he would have more of a say in the scripts(This information is from the Twilight Zone Companion book by Marc Zicree--a GREAT read!)
 WHERE""S SEASON TWO AND THREE ??It's been three years since season one was released and Still NO Seasons Two and Three--Get with it Universal!!!!!",1104278400,,1327,4.798245614035087
2077945,2,B0002CX1M0,"As an avid Twilight Zone (TZ) fan, I am young enough not to have caught the original Night Gallery (NG) show when it aired and never seemed to catch it consistantly on re-runs. So, I have been waiting patiently for this series to be released to judge the merits of this controversial show. After watching the pilot and the first season, what a stinker!

I have to approach this review from several different angles. First, there is the show itself, and Season 1 is the focus. In general, most stories are either rehashed concepts (even for that time period), poorly written, and/or badly acted. I can see why Serling immediately tried to distance himself from the show. While he wrote some of the episodes and did the teleplay on others, his lack of control over other aspects of the show are painfully clear.

The famous pilot 3-in-1 episode is pretty good, except of the last segment. The Ossie David-Roddy McDowall opener caught me off guard and is strong. The Joan Crawford episode is excellently done with a great twist. Unfortunately, the Nazi hunter segment is really terrible and overlong. Despite its noble intentions, the ending is predictable and the message very preachy.

The only other real highlight in the 3 disc set is ""They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's Bar"". And, even then, the ending is compromised and sugar coated (against Serling's wishes, of course). Most of the shows are average to below average, but historically interesting due to the connection with Serling.

In terms of the packaging/extras, it is sparse. The logic behind putting full length episodes of season 2 and 3 segments in this package confounds me. What a dumb move. The actual picture quality is fine, with some evidence of wear and tear. To me, that isn't really as important as the shows content.

This set is for die hard Serling fans who want to obtain a piece of his legacy toward the end of his career. The shows are pretty bad, but, amusing to watch TZ concepts in a 70's setting.",1104192000,5,1978,4.738372093023256
2077946,4,B0002CX1M0,"I just got through watching Disc 1, and ""Night Gallery"" has never looked better. The pilot was as good as I remembered, and so was 'The Little Black Bag'(one of my favorite ""NG"" segments).

 With the advent of the DVD medium, the tendency for reviewers to nitpick has become prevalent...but I'm just happy that the show is out at all. I remember trying to catch the pilot movie on A&E at two or three in the morning and--even worse--struggling through those chopped, grainy, syndicated shows on the Sci-Fi Channel; now, I've got the pilot and several great episodes all in one handy set. I mean, realistically, how many copies of this thing is Universal going to sell? This is not ""The Twilight Zone"", after all; it wouldn't make sense for them to shoot their wad on a ""Night Gallery"" set. Yes, some extras would have been nice, but you can't judge the entire package by the lack of bonus features.

One quibble: they could have included better shows from the second and third seasons(where are 'Cool Air', 'The Caterpillar', 'Green Fingers', and 'The Waiting Room'?). Otherwise, nicely done.",1104019200,2,1092,4.797872340425532
2077947,4,B0002CX1M0,"The DVD is adequate, the navigation confusing, no behind the scenes stuff, no printed material, adequate is a good word to descibe this DVD.

But there's a little gem in ""Eyes"" (the now famous and somewhat cliche first bat for budding director Steven Speilberg in the pilot on disc ONE) that so far  nobody has noticed or cared to mention.

If you listen carefully to the music box playing early in the ""goodbye"" scene between Claudia Menlo (Joan Crawford) and Dr. Hetherton (Barry Sullivan)after the surgery where the good doctor warns her not to remove the bandages too soon, you will hear something ASTOUNDING.  The JAWS theme plays on the music box , then dissapears. I have a great memory for music and dialogue in films and this theme WAS NOT in any of the versions of the movie I have, BETA, VHS and LD.

OK.. the pilot ""Night Gallery"" was released in 1969. Question?  When was JAWS released?  Answer..1975.. so where did the music come from?  Did Steven ""borrow"" the theme for the later film, or was it cleverly inserted into the older move as a reverse homage?  The music for Night Gallery was done by Billy Goldenberg, no mention of John Williams.

I think Speilberg pulled a ""Lucas"" and inserted the theme into the movie for this DVD Season 1 release of the Night Gallery TV series.  Good job SS!!",1101600000,4,1308,4.594827586206897
2077948,5,B0002CX1M0,"When I found out this package was coming out- it was definitely one that I wanted for the library. It's also the one I'll always have mixed feelings about. Rod Serling was an incredible talent and this series was a mixed muddle.

It should have been great. It could have been. There's no reason why it couldn't have been as shining an example to horror, as Twilight Zone was to science fiction and fantasy.

This package reveals for me what I personally always felt about this show. There's two Night Gallerys. There's the pilot- with 3 stories ' written' by him, introduced by him and delivered with great style by the directors and actors who participated in them. And this is the reason why I am giving this package the 5 star rating. The pilot deserves it.

And then there's the series. The series did not.

The Cemetary is an example of how well Serling could write. A set piece, McDowall spars with Ozzie Davis in what is really a good horror story. The direction is tight and the performances, terrific. The writing is crisp and clever.

Eyes is a one trick pony. Crawford and Sullivan are good but the real focus is the introduction of Spielberg's talent to the world.

Escape Route is the jewel (for me). It's Serling's writing at some of its best- and an example of what he did best. It's weaving the elements of the real horrors of this world (ie- Nazism), and the mystery (and perhaps the hidden justice that sometimes comes) with karma. Richard Kiely is brilliant as Joseph Strobe- the fleeing war criminal. Barry Shears direction has you sweating along with him, and the prostitutes words back to him when he speaks of forgiveness and shadows to hide in.... Serling at some of his best.

The fact that this package also includes 'They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's Bar' (from the series and written by him, despite attempts to use him primarily for presitge purposes only ), seals the deal. This story and Windom's performance are gold (and sadly, an example of how Serling seemed to be feeling towards the end of his life).

The series wasn't him. It was high and low- depending on the directorial and acting talent. It filled a schedule. You can hand pick the stories that succeeded- and that's never a good sign. You can read the bio's, the articles or the interviews with friends to find out the way he was treated.

It's ugly and unbecoming of who he was and the talent he offered.

I am personally too fond of the man's work- what he contributed and the opportunity he helped make, to put 'real ideas' out there, (and the toll that fight ultimately took 'on 'him) to buy anything else in this series.

Find his Playhouse 90 work- watch Patterns & Requiem for a Heavyweight, Twilight Zone, the origional Planet of the Apes film and the pilot we are talking about. In watching this work, you'll understand who he was and the true talent he brought to the game. Those of us who grew up on him, did.

Good doesn't go to the grave- it resonates.",1099872000,16,2958,4.549905838041432
2077949,5,B0002CX1M0,"For your viewing pleasure...Night Gallery is finally on DVD.  The first season is available on a 3-disc set.  The pilot episode (1969) which contained ""The Cemetary"" with Roddy McDowall and Ossie Davis, ""Eyes"" with Joan Crawford and Tom Bosley, and ""The Escape Route"" with Larry Hagman is still shown today as a tv-movie.
  All the six episodes of the first season (it was a short season due to debut on December 16, 1970 and it rotated with ""McCloud"") are shown unedited and uncensored.
  We submit for your approval...Rod Serling who was our host for the original ""The Twilight Zone"" tv series (1959-1965).  Afterwards, Serling had many more stories to tell so he created the masterpiece of ""Night Gallery"" (1970-1973) and again Rod Serling was our distinguished host.
  Each episode is in color and sometimes you get three or more different paintings from which three or more different stories were shown per episode.  The haunting gallery paintings were by Tom Wright. The sets were highly-expensive created with extreme detail and the drama is high-class with major motion picture and television actors and actresses:
 Roddy McDowell, Ossie Davis, Joan Crawford, Richard Kiley, Barry Sullivan. Tom Bosley, George Murdock, Garry Goodrow, Louise Sorel, Carl Betz, Larry Hagman, Suzy Parker, Jeanette Nolan, Cathleen Cordell, Diane Keaton, George Furth, Burgess Meredith, Chill Wills, Arthur Mallet, Joseph Campanella, James Sikking, Joanna Pettet, Paul Richards, Steve Franken, Agnes Moorehead, Grayson Hall, Herbert Anderson Jr, Phyllis Diller, John Astin, John Colicos, Henry Silva, William Windom, Diane Baker, Bert Convy, John Randolph, Jack Cassidy and Martin E. Brooks.
  Easter Egg: 3 bonus episodes.  You will not see them on the Episode Summary of Disc Three.  You will have to click on ""Episode Index"" and there you will find 3 bonus episodes with Patty Duke, Virginia Mayo, David Wayne, Lindsay Wagner,Felix Silla, Cesar Romero, John Carradine, Vincent Van Patten, Marc Vahanian, Eric Chase, Carl Reiner, Johnnie Collins III, Vincent Price, Bill Bixby, Dean Stockwell and Sally Field.
 All episodes are in standard format. Night Gallery was on for 3 seasons.  44 episodes in all.

John Astin directed the segment ""The House"" in Episode 3.

  I was able to watch Night Gallery as a pre-teen when the program was in syndication on a Los Angeles independent tv station and I learned my lesson well.  Some were just too scary and heart-thumping to watch, ""A Question of Fear""  (Season 2), ""Sins of the Father"" with Richard Thomas (Season 2) and ""The Girl With the Hungry Eyes"" (Season 3).

  Now we are all adults and can watch ""Night Gallery"" to our hearts content.
  You are being forewarned.

2077950,3,B0002CX1M0,"As many people know, there was quite a bit of controversy over the release of this first dvd set of ""Night Gallery.""  Longtime fans of the show were very upset about Universal's decision not to remaster the episodes.  Technically, the episodes WERE remastered for their much earlier VHS release, with the deleted syndication footage restored to bring them back to their original lengths, but there were still significant flaws in some of the episodes that any reasonable distributor would have fixed.  Most noticeable is the constant, obnoxious clicking sounds (sounds like someone tapping on a microphone) that run through the soundtrack of the episode containing ""The House"" and ""Certain Shadows on the Wall"".  The ethereal quality of ""The House"" in particular suffers for this annoying glitch, which I'll bet could have EASILY been fixed if anyone at Universal had cared enough about their product.  It really is bad enough to make some people return their set as defective.

  Other liabilities to the set are Universal's pompous, blaringly loud logo credit which comes on before every episode.  I think everyone would agree that the old, silent ""revolving Earth"" Universal logo was much cooler and more appropriate for a show on the quiet side, which ""Night Gallery"" is.  Then there's the episode listing on the box:  not only do they get some of the episode names wrong, but they're not even in the order they appear in on the discs.  No booklet, not even a listing of the dates the shows were originally broadcast.

  That said, I'd still recommend purchasing this set to anyone who was a fan of the show, or of the original ""Twilight Zone"" or even the new ""Outer Limits"".  These are, for the most part, very good stories and many are truly chilling, if not terrifying.  You get a veritable smorgasbord of sixties and seventies performers, big names from Joan Crawford to Sally Field to Vincent Price, not one but TWO episodes directed by Steven Spielberg (""Eyes"" from the pilot and ""Make Me Laugh"", both of which, curiously, feature Tom Bosley of ""Happy Days"" fame).  The first season of ""Night Gallery"" was more dreamlike and a little more subdued than the two later seasons, but Serling had more creative control in the first season, so it's no doubt truer to his original premise for the show.

  Strangely, Universal tacked on a bonus hour-length episode from the second season and two half-hour bonus episodes from the third season to the third disc.  Was this to make up for the lack of any other extras on the set?  Or does it mean they have no intention of releasing the other seasons?  Hopefully they will, because I'll be waiting with money in hand.  But please, Universal, in the future show a little more regard for the way you package and present your shows, especially one as uniquely appealing as ""Night Gallery"".",1097280000,24,2836,4.858333333333333
2077951,2,B0002CX1M0,Universal Studios have done it again.....offered a very limited number of episodes for a high price.  They did it with NORTHERN EXPOSURE and at the time said the price was high because of the cost they had to pay for the music.  Now they offer 8 complete hour long episodes and two half hour episodes and charge a price comparable to other companies offering a full season of 22 episodes.  Sure they advertise 20 different stories....but some of them only run 2 or 3 minutes long (remember Night Gallery was an hour program featureing as many as 3 or 4 different short stories per episode).  The saving grace here is the offering of Joan Crawford's classic episode of the blind lady trying to regain her sight.  But on the overall there is no justification for this pricing for 3 discs and only 8 full hour shows.,1097193600,9,813,4.541095890410959
2077952,3,B0002CX1M0,"Well, I'm a little surprised that so many people have given Night Gallery a review without actually watching the DVD set.  Well I purchased it the other day and have watched it and there is no need to fear, the DVD remastering quality is excellent.  It is so clear that you can even see the uppper lip hair on Patty Duke in one of the episodes.  I always liked Night Gallery and so I enjoyed this DVD set.  If you are a fan you will love it.  Good sound, good picture well worth the modest price.  One small quibble...there doesn't seem to be very many episodes on the three discs in spite of the fact that they advertise it as 20 stories.  No DVD extras but then most of those unfortunately are usually a waste of time anyway.  So all in all a worthwhile purchase if you like the show.",1096416000,8,786,4.193333333333333
2077953,4,B0002CX1M0,"My memories of Night Gallery are from my parents basement when I was a little kid, watching it on a 9"" Black & White TV at 1AM Sundays... and these are great memories. It was fun not knowing if the episode coming up would be one of the thought provoking ones, or one designed to scare the pants off you. One particular episode, ""The Doll"" still puts a shiver down my spine to this day when we first see the doll's face with the evil grin on it. It reminds me of that damn clown in Poltergeist that still gives me the creeps.

Does this series stand up to the test of time? Yes and no. It's still fun to watch, but the plots are usually so transparent that it's not even a challenge to figure out the endings. Of course what I found scary as a little kid doesn't work real well today (other than that damn doll's face) but that's OK as I wouldn't expect to be scared by something like this these days.

What does hold up extremely well are the performances by the actors featured each week. It's impressive the talent Rod Serling was able to get involved with this show. Granted, some of these people weren't all that well known back then, but even so it's a testament to the shows quality when you read the cast list. I didn't even try to give a full listing here, with 20 episodes in this collection would be too long. Besides, part of the fun it watching one and being surprised at who's starring in each episode.

I have no complaints about this collection other than the lack of extras included. I can't believe that Universal doesn't have access to outtakes, commentary material, or anything else that could have been used to flesh out this DVD set. But that's a mark against the collection, not the show and don't let that keep you from picking this up. I'm giving it a well deserved 4 stars, this is worth seeing at the very least, and if you like this genre at all you should be adding this to your collection.",1095379200,12,1918,4.292817679558011

2077955,5,B0002CX1M0,"Yes, i signed the petition sponsored by NightGallery. Net, who were ranting and raving about how poorly this set would look. I have just finished renting and watching the first 2 discs in this set, and you know what?---They look and sound great to me! Yes, i think there should have been some interesting extras (like audio commentary from Rod Serling himself, which exists), but my main concern has always been the quality of the transfer. This is one of the reasons i joined an online dvd rental service. You can rent BEFORE you buy. It has already saved me a couple of buying mistakes to which i have left negative reviews for. These episodes don't seem to be edited to me. They run about 50 minutes each like they should. The audio and video is really nice. Good stories and acting, too. I think Universal has finally decided to clean up their act and start releasing better quality DVD's. I say this because earlier this year i bought the 4 Film Noir titles they released (THE BIG CLOCK, CRISS CROSS, BLACK ANGEL & THIS GUN FOR HIRE) and all 4 titles look and sound great. I will probably end up buying this NIGHT GALLERY set later on. Again, i would advise anyone who is doubtful to rent these discs first. I have heard that the successful release of LOST IN SPACE on DVD was a watershed event. I sure hope the studios keep releasing all of these great classic television shows on DVD.

2077956,4,B0002CX1M0,"When NIGHT GALLERY was syndicated in half-hour segments, Universal made major alterations to the episodes.  If an episode ran over a half-hour, then they cut it to fit the shorter time slot.  If an episode was too short to fill a half-hour, they would re-edit it and include new footage.  In the case of ""The Doll,"" the opening scene on the battlefield was added to the syndicated version, and was not a part of the original broadcast version.

What you get with the box set are the original broadcast versions of the episodes.  This is how the episodes were meant to be seen.  Granted, that can lead to a perceived ""loss"" of scenes, but those scenes were not supposed to be included in the first place.",1094774400,19,703,4.5396825396825395
2077957,3,B0002CX1M0,"No question that Night Gallery is a series that divides opinion and I'd agree with those who say Twilight Zone is more consistent in quality.  Night Gallery suffers from far too many bad-to-outright-embarrassing segments that really do make you question the sanity of its creators.  I assume a lot of drugs were being taken because even at its worst, NG has a kind of hallucinogenic quality that indicates the writers and directors  were encouraged to be as experimental as they wanted to be even if the results didn't always cohere.  As much as I love TZ and acknowledge its greatness, I still prefer Night Gallery because at its very best, NG offers individual segments that are far stronger in content and more striking in presentation.  My love for stories of the macabre may also explain my preference but even the most critical viewer would have to acknowledge that Night Gallery presented some of the scariest and most hauntingly original drama ever presented on television.  The problem with the new Season One DVD set is that it contains very few of the best Night Gallery segments.  If I were making a judgment based on this set, I'd be pretty disappointed.  The Pilot is superb as are ""The Doll"", ""They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's Bar"", ""The Dead Man,"" and ""Certain Shadows on the Wall"" but the rest are  forgettable.  OK, the ""Little Black Bag"" is very strong until the final scene but the shock ending falls flat because it is rushed and explained away rather than shown or suggested (it could have been handled without showing gore) and the sudden cut to the future lab scene destroys the atmosphere.  It's a botched ending - one of many that ruined otherwise good segments.  But I digress.  Night Gallery really came into its own in the Second Season and it is here that you find so many brilliant segments (mixed in, of course, with the routine and those horrendous vignettes).  The best Second Season segments include ""The Caterpillar,""  ""A Fear of Spiders,"" ""A Question of Fear,"" ""Camera Obscura,"" ""Cool Air,"" ""Class of 99,"" ""Silent Snow, Secret Snow"", ""Green Fingers,"" ""The Messiah of Mott Street,"" ""Satisfaction Guaranteed,"" Pickman's Model,"" ""The Boy Who Predicted Earthquakes,"" ""The Devil is Not Mocked,"" ""Brenda"", ""The Dark Boy,"" ""Last Rites for a Dead Druid"", ""Deliveries in the Rear,"" ""Dead Weight,"" ""I'll Never Leave You, Ever"", ""The Sins of the Fathers"" and ""Little Girl Lost.""  Any of these segments compare favorably with anything Twilight Zone offered and I'd argue that no single season of TZ presented so many outstanding segments.  I am hoping and praying that Universal gives us a Second Season DVD set that is digitally remastered and packed with all the extras that fans are clamoring for.  The Third Season was a disappointment but there were a couple of really strong episodes including ""Something in the Woodwork,"" and ""The Other Way Out"" - the latter being perhaps the most nail-biting segment of all.  Don't dismiss Night Gallery until you've seen it's brilliant second season and the best of the third season.  Seen in its entirety, Night Gallery emerges as one of the most creative and entertaining series ever seen on television and a very worth follow-up to Twilight Zone.",1094774400,97,3217,4.9222222222222225
2077958,1,B0002CX1M0,"Having been a long time Rod Serling fan, I was quite pleased to learn that the first season of Night Gallery was finally to be released on DVD.  And, I was quite willing to forgive the lack of extras and special features that many other viewers have complained about.  (Extras would be nice, of course, but not mandatory.  That's why they call them ""extras"" and ""bonuses"". As far as I'm concerned a proper restoration of the series would be quite satisfactory.)

Last night I happened to view a couple of episodes at my buddy's house, and am quite happy that I did.  It saved me from making a very serious mistake in purchasing this poorly conceived joke myself.

One of the series most chilling episodes, ""The Doll"", is missing two of it's most frightening sequences (One example:  Fans may recall the opening scene where the doll is observing a battle that British Colonial forces are fighting with India troups circa 1906.  At the end of this sequence, the grinning doll, apparently a weapon, rises from the body of a fallen British soldier).  This effective scene was cut from the DVD release.  And, it makes me wonder what else is missing from other episodes.

In all fairness, the picture quality is pristine....which does lead one to believe that these ARE remastered...but remastered from WHAT?  Hack jobs performed by TV stations to allow time for longer commercials?  If you're not familiar with the series and don't know the sequences were cut in the first place, I guess this is acceptable, but make no mistake, the consumers are being played for suckers.

Never mind the extras.  Folks, long before DVD was invented, one basic premise of buying home video was being able to see our favorite films/shows in their original format: complete, intact, and free of hack jobs.

It looks nice on the surface.  But,if you're at all familiar with the series, this job is not only lazy, unprofessional and sloppy, it's dishonest, and should be considered illegal. I seriously doubt that the appropriate folks at Universal will ever be held accountable, but I can only do my part to spread the word in hopes that those responsible for some very poor decisions do not make a profit.",1094688000,15,2182,4.776
2077959,3,B0002CX1M0,"After watching the pilot (The Cemetary Eyes, Escape Route), I wrote a gushing review, that never made it here to Amazon for some reason. This happens to me from time to time, no idea why. Anyway, then I watched Episode One...

----

The Dead Man was a bit comical in sort of the wrong way. Passable by the narrowist of margins, not something I care to revisit. And then (heavan help me) I watched...

The Housekeeper. Now understand, I love Larry Hagman but this episode was/is with all due respect, horrendous. The powers that be (Serling and company) thought this would make a great OPENER to the series? Are they kidding? I began to lose respect, or at least hope, if just a little. I mean, if they thought this was a good series OPENER they were wrong. And if they thought it was watchable, they were wrong again. So what else in this little black box I purchased would be of similar quality?

---

Episode Two:

Room with a View... umm, after the episode I thought about visiting my word processor and being a writer, because evidently people like anything... right? Not to sound harsh, but this stuff is over with no real consequence and is just not vital in any way. Dare I say unnecessary?

The Little Black Bag... nice to see Burgess back. The subject matter is interesting but again this ep. is just not as great as people here seem to think it is. As with many I've seen, it is predictable and simply not fun to watch. And the ending was fairly aweful.

The Nature of the Enemy... I like the feel of this one. The communication with the man on the moon has a sort of errie reality to it, but again, the ending is laughable. They could have done w/o the mouse. We get it already, simply seeing the mousetrap would have made a better statement. Mice on the moon? Ugh.

Disc Two: Episode Three

By the time I got to this I was really in fear. Not so much for my purchase, hell I'll pay anything to escape the TV of today, but for my love for Serling. I don't have cable, and my memories of this show have been fed from... memory. I didn't want this to be another 'Land of the Lost' purchase (hated it).

Certain Shadows on the Wall... ahh, not we're talking. Thoughtful dialgue. Great characters. A sort of chillying ending. My hopes were being lifted!! Like the pilot, Episode Three was living up to memories...

The House... Again, sparse actors but they were made to count. Spooky house, great dream sequences, the only questionable thing was the rather predictable non-sensical-ending. Hey, but that's the 70's baby!

Episode Four:

Make Me Laugh... again the material really isn't strong. The lead casting is on par with many Zones but it's the subject matter that is lacking.

Clean Kills... Despite the predictable ending, I enjoyed the dialogue.

Episode Five:

Pamela's Voice... I suppose I see some humor here, but since this isn't a comedy...

The Doll... I love the look of the doll. The conclusion is a bit ominous, but still this series is hit and miss, and miss again.

The Lone Survivor... Like many above, though I never mentioned it, this stuff just feels like retreads of retreads. Heck, I love Serling, but did he not realize these scripts were done... in '62?

In Conclusion:

I think the colors of the transfer are bright. The sound is quite strong. The soundtrack is errie and often brillant. But if you are expecting a sort of 'Twilight Zone 2' in terms of the quality of writing and script direction, you are going to be dissappointed. The Night Gallery reminds me in many ways of the Outer Limits in comparison to the Twilight Zone; often it could go toe to toe with the master, but not for very long. After all the master is the MASTER for a reason. My somewhat less than optomistic view is fueled from the fact that Serling knows how to do these shows, there should be no need for a 'warm up' time period as with many shows, and yet right out of the gate Night Gallery seems lacking in many ways.

Btw, They're Tearing Down Riley's Bar is every bit as fantastic as the good folks here claim it is and was about the quality I was expecting with the whole set.",1094515200,5,4099,4.457831325301205

2077962,4,B0002CX1M0,"As of this writing I have watched two of the three discs in this DVD package, and I have to say that, while I love the series, I really think Universal could have invested a bit more work into remastering Night Gallery.  Okay, maybe the audience isn't big enough to merit a deluxe treatment with commentaries and extras (I rarely watch the extras anyway), but they could have invested a little time into cleaning up some of the film grain and beefing up the sound a little.  I'm sure the process is all computer controlled.  How much more time would it have taken to do a search for artifacts and smear them out?  They also could have adjusted the contrast and brightness on some of these.

BUT...this does not mean I am not enjoying this series immensely.  The great strength of Night Gallery was its writing, characters, and dialogue, not special effects and makeup like today.  Watching these episodes is a genuine pleasure, no matter what their condition, because of the depth and craftsmanship Serling imbued into these stories.  Rod Serling was a pioneer and something television hasn't seen since his death--a genuine playwright with a message.  Those who complain that some of the plotlines are familiar from Twilight Zone or his Playhouse 90 works miss the point; Serling didn't revisit the themes of dispossession and disillusionment because he lacked imagination, he revisited them because HE was disillusioned.  He empathized with such people.  And in a time where the only actors one sees on the screen are prettyboys and ex-underwear models, isn't it a pleasure to see veterans like Burgess Meredith, William Windom, Roddy McDowell, and Agnes Moorehead again?

Hopefully the packaging of the next season will match the quality of the content.",1093996800,5,1756,4.955631399317406
2077963,2,B0002CX1M0,"In all honesty, I must admit that I was excited about this release.  I remember staying up late and watching NG as a child recalling some my favorite episodes.

The first season set is really a rather paltry affair loaded with the silly 5 minute shorts (do these constitute an episode? I wonder what Universal was thinking...) I find it interesting that one of the critics here at Amazon actually found NG worthy of a full scale book.  I must admit that some of the episodes are amusing, but some are just plain dumb and predictable.  Take, for instance, ""Clean Kills and Other Trophies"" with Raymond Massey--I knew his head was going to end up on the wall and I never saw the episode!

Or ""A Matter of Semantics"" with Caesar Romero who plays a vampire--the punchine? He tells the candystriper--""Is this not a blood bank, my dear? Then I wish to make a withdrawl""  Oh my, how chilling or how pathetic--sorry, Twilight Zone this ain't. The pilot episode is good--everything else is merely an anticlimax.  Clearly, Rod's imaginative powers were on the decline here and it shows.  No wonder he died two years after the show was cancelled--a sad loss for television.  And why no commentaries whatsoever?

Certainly Universal could have put some effort into this release.  (MGM's ""Midnight Movies"" collection of the Roger Corman Poe classics were simply oustanding as a fine example how commentaries allow the viewer to appreciate the director's work in a totally new light. I would have gladly paid the $9.99 for just an audio recording of Corman's erudite comments!)

Even the much touted and Emmy-award winning ""Tim Riley's Bar"" is simply a rework of the themes already explored in TZ's ""Walking Distance"" and his 1956 film ""Patterns"".  And how many times can you remodel Universal's familiar backlot--""Main Street--over and over again? (If you took the tour as a kid, you know what I mean.)  If anything, NG is a testament how, in a short span of 20 years, American tastes and expectations towards TV drama have changed dramatically--especially where higher production values and editing are concerned.

I will probably collect the 2nd and 3rd season, because some episodes are interesting.  I prefer the BBC's ""Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected"" or ""Unnatural Causes"" once seen on local public tv here in the SF Bay Area....BBC are you listening?",1093824000,3,2349,4.908860759493671
2077964,4,B0002CX1M0,"I have always been a fan of the Twilight Zone and when I heard Rod Serling's Night Gallery was coming on DVD, I went to the video store right away and got my own copy. It is a creepy cool series. It includes 20 chilling stories plus a pilot movie that includes 3 additional stories. Steven Spielburg made his directing debut in the episode ""Eyes"". I think the only thing missing from these episodes is Rod Serling's opening/closing narrations, however they can either make or brake the story. Stars many of Hollywood's best stars like Roddy McDowal, Joan Crawford, Diane Keaton, Vitcent Price, Sally Field, Berguss Merideth, Carl Reiner and many more.

These elitist and ultra-serious people who are so offended at the lack of special features and the less than perfect DVD quality (if you want to see perfect, go watch some souless Pixar film) are crying that Rod Serling has been disrespected by this DVD set.  What kind of DVD set do you expect for forty-something dollars?  Also, this is not Serling's greatest work (""The Nature of the Enemy""?? What was he thinking?), but most of it is quality TV nonetheless, and the quality of the DVD set reflects that.  The episodes as well as the movie have been remastered.  The remastering job may not have been the greatest, but believe me it looks a heck of alot better than how the originals look.  I don't understand, instead of watching the DVD and just enjoying the episodes, do you just sit there and take note of each and every flaw and imperfection in the DVD quality?  Just relax, and save your complaints for the Twilight Zone, which is Serling's greatest work, for those episodes are the ones that deserve only the best treatment.

2077967,3,B0002CX1M0,"okay, here's the scoop. I love this show, decided to buy the DVD set after reading the first few reviews. the pilot movie looks awful. 'Eyes' looks the worst. lots of dust and scratches and these sparkly things that appear for seconds at a time. the episodes look better than the movie. I'm happy to have bought this set since I love the show and the video throughout isn't too bad.

I'm watching these discs on a 13"" Apex TV with a cheap DVD player and all the shows actually look pretty good. If I watch them on my 46"" Sony 4:3 big screen with component connections and digital filters, it really looks bad. All the flaws in the video (not just flaws in the source, but problems with the transfer) come through bright and clear. If Universal wanted to double dip, I'd say put out the pilot movie with a new transfer and new 5.1 audio. For extras, you could stick on the Steven Spielberg on TV documentary from the Duel DVD, since it spends a lot of time talking about the Eyes episode he directed. I'd buy it for sure, just to be able to watch it on my big screen.

Probably the dumbest thing about this DVD set is a disclaimer note at the beginning saying that comments on interviews and commentary are not reflective of Universal... what comments? what commentary? were there extras prepped and ready to go and then they decided not to go through with them? dumb, dumb universal, they should have at least taken that disclaimer off.",1093651200,3,1436,4.4356060606060606
2077968,4,B0002CX1M0,"Rod Serling made pulp respectable. As a writer of television and movie dramas, Serling had few peers. His well thought out plots, well developed characters and the moral lesson of his work all derived from an old fashioned sense of storytelling that had its roots in the great play writes. ""The Twilight Zone"" broke new ground using its anthology format to tackle everything from fantasy to science fiction with a little sprinkling of horror along the way. With ""Night Gallery"" Serling dipped into the well of horror with a little touch of fantasy as well. His clever framing stories involving the paintings that ""tell a story"" made ""Night Gallery just as unique as ""The Twilight Zone"". If the series became a tad inconsistent in later years, it was because Serling had no creative control over the direction of the series but was contractually obligated to host it.

The strong pilot episode and first season represent ""Night Gallery"" at its best. There are a few lemons in the mix but usually that's due to budget or execution (""The Nature of the Enemy""). The highlights include, of course, the pilot, ""The Little Black Bag"" and ""They're Tearing Down Riley's Bar"". With guest stars including Burgess Meredith, Carl Reiner, Roddy MacDowall, Ossie Davis, Joan Crawford, Richard Kiley, Sam Jaffe and others help bring these episodes to life.

The transfer varies in quality. The pilot looks the worse for wear. There's considerable analog artifacts in the form of dirt, hair and white splotches. The picture improves as we move along to the first season. While these may not be new digitally remastered prints struck from the original negative, they look good with solid colors (with the exception of the pilot which, again, has some fading most noticably in Spielberg's second segment). Since I don't know what budget they had for restoring this (every DVD has a budget to work with based on potential sales for transfer, restoration, design, packaging, etc) this for DVD, it's hard to judge this set too harshly.

The chapter breaks make it a bit difficult to navigate and get to individual stories but by going to seen access, you're able to get to the individual episodes. Most, however, don't have individual breakdowns for each episode. The lack of commentary (what about Richard Matheson for his stories or Carol Serling?)is probably related, again, to the budget for the set. A retrospective documentary or featurette might also have been a good idea as well. Perhaps we'll see both in later sets.

I'm happy to see this finally released. What's amazing is how well the best episodes of this series have aged. Watching the pilot with my kids, they noted it was creepy without resorting to gore or excessive violence. I'm hoping that the inclusion of episodes from seasons two and three are nothing more than ""tasters"" for the future boxed sets. Keep in mind, though, that Universal may or may not release this set depending upon how it sells. I'm looking forward to season two with ""Cool Air"" and ""Pickman's Model"" two adapations of Lovecraft stories that still work very, very well.

Overall, not a disappointment but there's considerable potential that was missed in this set. Hopefully Universal will remedy this situation for the next two sets (if they release them).",1093564800,16,3278,4.963570127504553
2077969,5,B0002CX1M0,"Finally, the best horror anthology show to ever appear on network television is on DVD! Rod Serling is a bloody genius and spent three seasons in the early 70s scaring me to death! Episodes like ""The Doll"" are burned into my memory and bring fear and dread whenever I think of them! This was the point I think. Serling spent the 'Black And White' part of his career making us think with ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""Requiem For A Heavyweight"". With NIGHT GALLERY, he blew out the lights and let the creeping things loose! No one else could pull off what Serling did with NIGHT GALLERY. He made quality / intelligent / frightening programs in a medium known for mediocrity, during a time of imbecilic sit-coms and cop shows. NIGHT GALLERY holds up today because it's still better than anything else that's on network TV! If Serling were alive, he'd probably have a pretty cool cable show. I'm just glad that season one of NG is here! I don't care about extras, I just love the show! Every episode is a classic. The entire collection belongs on DVD. Highly recommended...",1093478400,8,1065,4.610526315789474
2077970,5,B0002CX1M0,"Honestly, I just don't understand all the negativity towards this release. For $38, I now own the entire first season of this show including the pilot movie and extra sample episodes from later seasons. All packaged in a nice flip-out digi-box with outer sleeve. Obviously, there wasn't a ton of effort put into any extras (none) and I snickered a bit at the booklet which fits into the inside pocket (it's a generic Universal brochure!), but I truly can't understand the abundant hostility fans are showing towards this release. Maybe Universal doesn't care about this show, but at least they are releasing it in a season set at a great price. This is not STAR TREK here. This is a show that Universal probably doesn't have a lot of faith in and is testing the waters. At least they're doing it with a season set, not a couple of ""sampler"" discs like other studios have done. And they're not gouging fans like Paramount did with STAR TREK by releasing individual over-priced discs that contained only two episodes a-piece and then after releasing all of those (already an $800+ investment for the entire series), they immediately turn around and try to double-gouge with box sets. Universal is giving us a bare-bones entire season for $40. I don't see any problem with that at all. I am thrilled to have these episodes in one attractive collection and never have to suffer badly edited reruns on TV anymore. That's worth a lot MORE than $40 to me.

I haven't put in any of the discs yet. I know the story of the masters being the old ones and that no money was spent to remaster them. I signd that on-line petition months ago in the hopes of the best release possible. I know the shows COULD look better, but from all accounts from people who have actually watched some of the episodes on the DVD's, these shows look mighty fine and better than they ever did in syndication. I'm happy with that. And for $38!!!

Would I have paid $80 for a perfect set with re-masters, extras, and a synopisis of each episode. Probably, but I doubt Universal thinks there are that many similar fans out there. And if the devoted fans aren't even buying it as so many say they won't, then Universal may be right that this show isn't as beloved as some may think. The show ITSELF is what us fans grew up with. And the show itself is on this DVD set. Synopses? There are books devoted to this show that you can probably pick up for cheap. The perfect companion.

Thank you Universal! I'll be first in line for season 2.",1093478400,14,2500,4.514348785871965
2077971,5,B0002CX1M0,"NIGHT GALLERY is a must for any fan of good writing and entertaining tv.

There have been a lot of negative reviews on Amazon (for some reason) in regards to the quality of the transfer to DVD, mostly from those who judged before the set was released.

I personally have no problem with the quality of this DVD--I believe that each episode looks great.

If you are the type of person who really wants lots of extras on your DVD's, then you will be disappointed, as this DVD is not big on extras.

However, if you are the type of person who wants a memorable set of shows from the genius of Rod Serling, something can you can enjoy for years to come, please don't hesitate to purchase this set, as it is worth it!",1093392000,11,712,4.2518518518518515
2077972,3,B0002CX1M0,"I have mixed emotions over the release of this dvd package. It is nice to finally have it arrive on dvd, but I think the treatment was rather weak. I have not looked at all the episodes, but of the ones I have seen the image quality is good/acceptable, but no more. Universal really should have gone all out on this to remaster/revamp a classic show. I deducted a full star due to the lack of extras- shameful! ( I am not counting the addition of "" bonus episodes"" from the 2nd season as an extra) At the very least, they could have had SOME commentary and some tv spots, etc. Also, unless I am wrong some or all of the amusing ""comedy"" pieces that ran from approx. 1-5 minutes are not included. Maybe they were in the 2nd season only,but I don't think so. If these were excised by some Universal brainiac, that is a travesty! Night Gallery should be shown in its' entire format and not in fragments! I am deducting a full star for this dumb/stupid mistake also. Finally, the concept of including bonus episodes from the 2nd season, gives me the impression that Universal really doesn't anticipate this set doing that well, and that there will be no 2nd season release. I hope I am wrong on this point. Additionally, I hope that the aforementioned vignettes of ""comedy"" will be included in that season and have not been chopped out. Night Gallery is not bad but could have been much better if Universal had not been so cheap in their approach.  UPDATE ( As of 9/9/04)  I was contacted by another reviewer who informed me that the short comedy pieces I referred to in my original review were part of the 2nd season and not the 1st season as I had thought. After digging out my copy of "" Fantastic Television "" by Gary Geranni from 1977 that I thought lost, I verified that this was indeed true. HOWEVER, I was quite dismayed to see that apparently 3 of the stories from the 1st season WERE omitted : ""The Funeral"", ""The Academy"" and "" The Late Mr. Paddington."" Now assuming that this book is accurate, I find this new info coupled with others' complaints of missing scenes very disturbing. I think Universal did the public a disservice by releasing this set and I will think very hard before buying anything else from them. ( Note: I have every confidence in the Geranni book- it has proved over the years to be very reliable.)",1093392000,12,2326,4.444964871194379
2077973,5,B0002CX1M0,"First off, I was rather surprised at the negative reviews of this DVD set before it's release. It's never wise to make judgements until you see the DVDs. The claims by those who said that this series haven't been remastered are false. While, it's not a perfect transfer-I think they look and sound real good.

There are no extras, but who cares! I don't buy DVDs for the extras-I buy them because I want the Night Gallery TV series on DVD. There are some bonus episodes on the third disc. So, I guess there are extras on these DVDs. One person complained that there are no interviews with Rod Serling or Steven Speilberg. Rod Serling has been Dead since the mid 1970's. Extras are not the only reason to buy DVDs.

Rod Serling had quite an imagination! He is at his best with this series. While the Twilight Zone were more Sci-Fi, Night Galerry is more horror based on Paintings. The thing about Serling is that you didn't get the usual fare-you got something special. Most are based on short stories-at times he used the stories to convey something important to him-other times-just to tell a good story. And Serling was a great storyteller.

So, don't pay any attention to the negative hype. If you are a fan of Night Gallery-you won't be disapointed with this set-You get a total of 23 stories and 8 hours and 43 minutes of entertainment!

By this set today-what are you waiting for?",1093392000,9,1386,4.554216867469879
2077974,3,B0002CX1M0,"Today I purchased the Night Gallery DVD set, and found it to not be as bad as all the negative hype. Most of the episodes That I've watched (I'm halfway through disc 2 of 3) are clear and appear remastered. The only episode that is questionable is the pilot movie. Some scenes appear faded and staticy. Not to the point of ruining the enjoyment of the show, but from what I've read on here I've found myself analyzing every scene frame by frame. It overall is very good quality.

My 3 out of 5 stars is mainly because of the lack of any features whatsoever and a pretty generic collection of menu screens. They are pretty lame.

Outside of that, it is honestly worth it if you are a fan of the show. I'm 30, but used to watch the show in syndication when I was 13 and became a fan for life!!!

True, no extras, but what matters is that the show is on DVD at long last and in pristine condition belying 30 years.  What's even better is that the series is as fun and spooky as I remember it.  I was fully expecting to be disappointed by the shows themselves - how many of our childhood favorites are terrible when we see them as adults? - but these are still great juicy goofy junky horror vignettes done with a real joy and artfulness.  It is what it is, guys, it's not Hamlet.  AND I LOVE IT!!!  So, if you're a fan, don't hesitate, buy it and you'll be pleasantly surprised.

2077976,4,B0002CX1M0,"I bought this today and just finished the Pilot Epsiode. So this review is based on the actual DVD release, and not speculation or hearsay. and yes, IT DOES INCLUDE THE PILOT!

There has been a lot of controversy surrounding this release for months. Some of which I agree with, but most of which seems to be based on unrealistic and even fanatical speculation. Is this a perfect Night Gallery DVD? No. Is it worth buying? Without a doubt.

The Picture Quality: Is quite good. The color is all there and has obviously been enhanced and corrected. No more grainy, magenta tinted episodes like we've seen on TV for years. The transfer is crisp and color well saturated. There are a few dust spots and hairs from time to time, but no long scratches. Could Universal do better? Sure. But let's be realistic. Most of us watched these episodes on grainy TV sets with rabbit ear antennae 30 years ago. They look better on the DVD than I ever remember.

Sound Quality. This seems to have been much enhanced. Not quite Dolby Surround, but the musical score is clear and crisp, and lends a creepy layer of atmosphere the series never had back when we only had a crummy TV speaker. The sound is great, at least on the pilot.

Extras? Well, there are none, and here I agree with the critics. Would it have killed Universal to put the paintings on DVD? Or maybe include one interview with Serling or even Spielberg? This is barebones for sure.

Presentation: The box is a beautifully printed glossy gatefold with some cool photos of Rod Serling on N.G. set. It's quite nice and well done. There are 3 discs.

If you've been waiting to see the full episodes of N.G. for decades, like I have, then buy this set and don't listen to the carping from other reviewers and websites. Let's be realistic; boycotting the release of this DVD because it's not perfect is like going on a Hunger Strike at McDonald's because they're not a 5 star French Restaurant! Get real! Although I loved Night Gallery, it has always been considered the ugly stepchild in Serling's oeuvre. It was not as highly regarded as Twilight Zone, nor as well known because far fewer epsiodes were made for Syndication. Hopefully this disc set will change that and N.G. will get the respect it deserves. Who knows? If enough people buy the set, maybe Universal will release season two with the goodies. If you sit on your behind, boycott this release, sulk or even harrass the studio, it's likely the season two episodes will stay in the dark forever. I for one, will be enjoying this DVD set immensely. It's a long time overdue.",1093305600,505,2578,4.5813449023861175
2077977,1,B0002CX1M0,"series like Night Gallery, The Twilight Zone, Star Trek and many others have cult followings, the studios probably know that which is why they get away with releasing DVDs this way, the fans usually gobble up these releases despite all their complaints, and then the studios release a better version a few years later and watch the fans buy it up once again

I've never watch Night Gallery but I was very interested in purchasing it cause I'm a fan of Rod Serling's Twilight Zone, however I can understand the complaints being made since I see no point in buying something on DVD if its not brought up to DVD quality, I just hope the fans who claim they're gonna boycott this release actually follow up on it instead of caving in like they usually do",1093219200,4,750,4.514705882352941

I do agree that Universal should remaster the episodes and include extras and interviews, but if they don't I still want to have the set on DVD.  I'd bet that all of you who are saying you won't buy the set will fork out your $50 bucks to get it when it's released.

2077979,3,B0002CX1M0,"I am the coauthor, with Jim Benson, of the companion guide to ""Rod Serling's Night Gallery."" We've been tracking this release pretty closely and are privy to as much information as we can squeeze out of Universal Studios. We're grateful the series has been tapped for a DVD release, and the set has been struck from original, uncut prints--the same ones Columbia House used for its mail-order volumes--and not the butchered half-hour syndication version that played on the SciFi Channel for years. That said, the master for the pilot is 20 years old, and those for the series are 15 years old--acceptable, but a bit long-in-the-tooth compared to the up-to-date treatment other television series have received. Imbedded in a few of the episodes are some errors, mostly in the sound and music tracks, and it would have been preferable had Universal seen fit to correct these. We also fail to see why a series which featured the involvement of both Rod Serling and Steven Spielberg did not rate a budget that allowed special features. If Warner Brothers can load extras into DVD releases of such non-classics as ""Wonder Woman"" and ""The Dukes of Hazzard,"" then Universal is out of touch with current standards in the DVD business when they fail to properly document their own classic TV shows (such as ""Rod Serling's Night Gallery"" and ""Columbo""). However, Universal is new to the TV side of their property library and may need to get their feet wet before they finally catch up to their more forward-looking competitors.
As a caveat emptor, the first season is relatively free of errors compared to the second season. The most critical error is the crackling that runs through the soundtrack of Serling's segment ""The House"" (found in Episode #3). Any further critique will have to wait until the release.
And who knows, if sales for Season One are impressive enough, maybe the studio will do right by Season Two and give ""RSNG"" a budget that more accurately reflects its classic status.",1089676800,463,1984,4.907738095238095

I am so glad they've finally decided to put it on DVD.  Some of the cinematography is less than stellar,  their budget was MINIMAL,  but open your mind and go with the flow.  It's entertainment at it's best!  You won't believe how many actors you'll recognize.",1088985600,3,564,4.56
2077981,3,B0002CX1M0,"To be fair to Universal Studios, all of the remastering versus ""15-year-old copy"" information's originating, as best I can tell, from a NIGHT GALLERY website, [...] The authors for this site claim to have a ""mole"" within the studio who provided them with information about the DVD set and also that celebrated Mexican horror/science fiction director Guillermo del Toro (THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, HELLBOY) had volunteered his services for producing the first season set but had been rebuffed. The website's the premiere NIGHT GALLERY source on the net and no less a person than Carol Serling (Rod Serling's widow) has weighed in on the controversy on the site with personal correspondence (although, at the time I write this, she doesn't appear to have any definite knowledge about whether remastering's taken place or not, either), but, as no one authoring the reviews below has yet seen a copy of the 1st season DVD set from Universal, I'm not sure that this controversy's genuine or not.
As for the show, well, it's a very hazy memory of my young childhood. I was only 5 or 6 years of age when it left the air, but it's honestly the first thing I can recall watching as a young boy. My mother was a huge fan of Serling, and she would watch anything he was associated with--TWILIGHT ZONE, NIGHT GALLERY, even those cheesy ""Bermuda Triangle"" documentaries he narrated in the 1970's near the end of his life. I did catch a very few of the syndicated shows during the 1970's and 1980's but it never seemed popular or had wide coverage in any of the places I was then living. I understand it's now in reruns on the ""Mystery Channel,"" but I don't have access to that station in my area on standard cable, either. I do recall the syndicated version of the show was awful: apparently, the shows had been cut up or extended to fit a 30-minute format, and you often had non sequitur ""creepy"" footage cut in from other shows or footage from the original show had been repeated in loops to fill time.
However, the original shows, unaltered, made a high emotional impact on me as a youngster. I still recall the adaption of H.P. Lovecraft's ""Pickman's Model,"" the episode called ""Green Fingers"" with the little old lady who could grow just about *anything*, the one about the drunken randy sea captain and his mermaid he found, ""Logoda's Heads"" about the strange fortune telling shrunken heads owned by an African witch doctor, and the really weird one set in the Old West about the gunfighters sitting around an eerie saloon waiting for something to happen...
So, while this may not have been the best project Rod Serling was ever associated with, it did make a huge impression on me at the time and must have had something to it more than just being a typical supernatural television anthology. I'm hoping Universal actually has made some effort with this DVD set and the rumors aren't true. I still haven't decided whether I'm ordering it yet or not and may wait until it's released and see what actual purchasers have to say. I'd really like to see NIGHT GALLERY again in its entirety before I am eligible as an AARP member.",1088985600,7,3113,4.682481751824818
