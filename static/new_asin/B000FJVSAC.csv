8123801,5,B000FJVSAC,"I've used this DVD for three years now, and it can't be beat. I wish it would be made into a series. The workout is geared towards dancers, but no special dance moves are performed. It's quite user friendly for the general public. I appreciate that you can see the dancers working hard on some of the moves - no pasted on grins here.

The DVD is only 20 minutes long and it flies by. The exercises move quickly and there's no time for you to get bored repeating a motion. The instructions are clear and concise. This workout isn't highly aerobic, but you will feel stretched and strengthened.

If you are interested in taking dance classes, this video will help condition you to prepare your muscles for the class. I've tried many dance videos, but most of them are basic aerobic workouts with some dance moves worked into them - this stands apart as a useful tool in getting your body where it needs to be to get the most out of a dance class. I took ballet as an adult for three years, and this video was an excellent mid-week tool to help me stay toned.",1275350400,2,1056,4.328282828282828
