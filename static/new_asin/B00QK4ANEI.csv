6873113,5,B00QK4ANEI,"If Stanley Kubrick had ever gotten around to making a sports movie, it would look and feel a lot like Foxcatcher. Director Bennett Miller's former feature films make him an apt artist to deliver the haunting story of the Schulz brothers and their financial supporter, John E. du Pont. Miller has crafted an unforgettably ominous picture that combines the real life crime genre he chronicled in Capote with the theme of American sports he mastered in Moneyball. The steady stream of subtle foreboding that courses throughout the entirety of Foxcatcher places the film on a trophy shelf of the past decade's other masterworks.

In terms of its plot, many of the trailers for Foxcatcher have given away very little as to what the film is actually about. The incident that Miller and screenwriters E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman bring to the screen is the strange but true story of how millionaire du Pont (Steve Carell) ensnared two Gold Medal-winning wrestlers (Channing Tatum & Mark Ruffalo) in his perverted pastiche of patriotism and paranoia. On account of its historical reality, the plot, though intriguing, could be looked up on the internet and revealed to anyone with little fanfare. Miller's chillingly compelling direction ensures that Foxcatcher is first and foremost a psychological film.

A fellow critic from Screenrant has criticized Foxcatcher for ""struggling to convey insightful conclusions about its subjects."" While the film is less than lucid, there is no doubt that any room left for interpretation was a purposeful move from Miller. The film studies its three male leads with a level of focus similar to Paul Thomas Anderson's literary character study The Master. Miller's movie says little explicitly, and leaves ample room for audiences to sift through some disturbing subtext. Throughout the course of Foxcatcher, the viewer sees Mark (Tatum), David (Ruffalo), and even du Pont wrestle on the mat, but the true indications of the character's strengths and weaknesses come through cinematographer Greig Fraser's tormented close-ups. The only thing that these mesmerizing Olympians have trouble grappling with is their inner anguish.

There has been a lot of buzz over Steve Carell taking on a dramatic role in Foxcatcher, but skeptics will question whether or not the buzz is justified. Here is the justification: Carell turns in his finest film performance to date as du Pont; the unsettlingly entitled, perplexingly stolid member of America's wealthiest family who has more than his fair share of, shall we say, eccentricities. While the buzz is certainly well-deserved, it turns out that du Pont has much more in common with Carell's signature Dunder-Mifflin manager Michael Scott than one might think. Like Michael, all Du Pont seems to want is love and admiration; validation from human beings who genuinely care for him. However, as infuriating as Michael Scott could be, it is more than safe to say that du Pont proves to be a bigger nightmare of a boss. Carell's understated work in the film elicits gripping fascination from the audience; it is the kind of comedian-turned-dramatist performance that would make the late Robin Williams beam with pride.

Beyond Carell's performance, there is much more to commend in Miller's third feature. Tatum and Ruffalo also turn in career high-point performances. Tatum acts against type as an aloof and stand-offish champion, while Ruffalo portrays the picture's most headstrong character: a family man becoming progressively aware of the strings du Pont has attached to everyone he ropes into his estate. Audiences going to Foxcatcher expecting the next Chariots of Fire or Miracle will be sorely disappointed - viewers should not even approach the movie expecting to learn anything about wrestling itself. One critic from Tolucan Times complains that ""it doesn't explain a thing about Olympic wrestling."" This criticism is invalid. Although there is nothing wrong with being a sports movie, wrestling is virtually irrelevant to the Foxcatcher's real concerns. The filmmakers have turned torpid tabloid fodder into rumination about the all too thin veil of delusion separating the wealthy from the poor, the strong from the weak, and the American from the American Dream.

6873114,2,B00QK4ANEI,"A few months ago I heard the first bits about the movie Foxcatcher and - having read a few well written articles about John DuPont - knew I had to see it. I took my wife to see it this weekend. As we left the theater she declared it the most boring movie she's had to endure since Lost In Translation.

For those of you not familiar with the story of John Du Pont, he was an heir to the Du Pont fortune and at one time an aspiring Olympic athlete himself. As a young man he tried his hand at competitive swimming but simply didn't have the talent to compete at the level he aspired to. With zero chance of making the Olympic swimming team, he next tried his hand at Pentathlon, an Olympic event that combined running, swimming, horseback riding, fencing and shooting. Again...no gold.  rustrated by his inability to compete at the highest levels, Du Pont decided that he would literally make himself into the head coach for the America's wrestling team. He built a wrestling gym on his sprawling estate Foxcatcher Farm and became the financial patron to some of the America's best wrestlers. Then in 1996 Du Pont shot wrestling gold medalist and coach Dave Schultz.

I will say this for the movie Foxcatcher...it was well acted. But the writing and direction removed any sense of drama from what should have been a compelling story. All in all it was very dull and bleak. There are no emotional highs and no emotional lows, just a slow, consistent, plodding bleakness. Even the wrestling scenes seemed divorced from the usual drama of competition. There are lots of scenes that are about people watching other people. To be fair the boredom and bleakness is probably what the director was going for. So it wouldn't be out of line to think of the movie as an artistic success. If the director's goal was to make the viewer feel the discomfort that one feels when forced into the company of someone suffering from mental illness, then he was successful. The problem for me was that the emotional tone of the film was so monotonous that the drama really never built up. There was no sense of a building rift between DuPont and Dave Schultz, something evident in the print articles I had read.  In Foxcatcher everything is uncomfortable, stays uncomfortable, remains uncomfortable, then DuPont seems to shoot Schultz out of the blue.

When I looked up the run-time on the movie, I was shocked to see it was only 134 minutes. The movie seemed a lot longer than that. The movie seemed a lot longer than that. My wide hadn't been excited about the prospect of seeing s ""sports movie"" to begin with, but the plodding nature of the film was particularly unentertaining for her.",1419292800,14,2668,4.608421052631579
6873115,5,B00QK4ANEI,"Just saw the movie, ""Foxcatcher."" Here are some comments from the ladies in the group. ""I could tell he was a wrestler because he had potato chip ears.""
Womenfolk, ""That Mark Schultz guy was very good looking, but he seemed kind of crazy. So intense all the time, like an angry ape with borderline personality disorder. Was he really like that in real life?""
Me, ""No. In real life he was more intense.""
Womenfolk, ""Du Pont was messed up by his mother. She never accepted him for himself. That's what made him so crazy. A son needs unconditional love from his mother.""
Guy friend, ""Power people often have brief pauses when they speak, but prolonged pauses, like Du Pont, are usually a sign of psychiatric medications.""
In real life, it was true, that Mark Schultz was scary when you first met him, quiet, brooding, intense. However, when you got to know him, he was great, super nice, inspiring, with lots of fun stories about wrestling and life. Just being around him motivated you to become a better wrestler. He really helped me a lot in wrestling and in life. He was like an older brother to me. I will always be grateful to him. The Stanford wrestlers loved him.
In real life, Mark had beautiful girlfriends. The movie has a little bit of a covert, erotic undertone between Mark and Du Pont which is completely untrue. Hollywood likes to do that. Also, Mark has a real dad. His name is Phil.
It is true that there was a big difference between Dave and Mark. Mark was younger. On weekends he would hang around with the wrestlers at the athlete fraternity, Delta Tau Delta.
Dave was a family man. When he wasn't wrestling, he was with his wife, Nancy, and the kids. They were a beautiful family, so happy together. Dave loved them very much.
On the mat, Dave made sure that everyone in the remote vicinity of his weight class respected his dominance. Believe me, they did. When he first came to Stanford, I was one of the victims. I said, ""Hey Dave, I know you could kill me. I just want you to teach me."" He said, ""oh yeah,... sure."" Dave had the best technique of any wrestler in the world. I learned so much from him.
When Mark and Dave wrestled each other, it was like something out of a cartoon, a big, moving, dust cloud, with hands rising up and slamming down.
Off the mat, Dave was incredibly likeable. He had more friends than anyone I ever met in my life. Everyone liked him. He made everyone feel appreciated and accepted, from juveniles to geriatrics.
The actors looked, moved and sounded as much like Mark and Dave as possible. If you closed your eyes, when Mr. Ruffalo spoke, you would think it was Dave. When Channing Tatum shaved his head for the UFC fight, he looked so much like Mark that you spot check yourself for a moment, your brain asks itself, ""is that really Mark?""
A big lesson from the movie is that the sport of wrestling needs to build itself up financially. If Mark and Dave Schulz, World and Olympic champions were in some other sport, they would be millionaires from endorsements. It is so sad, that the sport of wrestling was so financially poor in the 1980's that the best option was to train at Du Pont's place.
Hopefully the leaders of the sport of wrestling can get together and work together to change some of the rules in a way that attracts more fans. Wrestling needs the money. Instead of preaching to the choir, wrestling needs to get out into the streets and attract more people to the sport. As the wrestling genius, Wade Schalles has written, the focus needs to be on attracting spectators.
All in all, the movie was fascinating, the actors were great, but it was sad. The book is better.",1419120000,8,3637,4.503782148260211
6873116,4,B00QK4ANEI,"""Foxcatcher"" (2014 release; 134 min.) brings the true story of philanthropist/wrestling mentor John du Pont (yes, THOSE du Ponts) and the wrestler brothers Mark and Dave Schultz. As the movie opens, we see Mark training on his own, and then giving a presentation to young school kids about what the Olympic gold medal, earned 3 years earlier at the 84 Olympics, means to him. We later see Mark in his very modest apartment, and then training some more, alongside his older brother Dave, in a very intense work-out. Them out of the blue, Mark gets a call from someone speaking for John du Pont, who would like to meet him in person. Mark agrees. du Pont explains that in his opinion Mark has not gotten the recognition or proper support for winning Olympic gold. ""That is a problem, a canary in a coalmine"", sighs du Pont. It's not long before he convinces Mark to move out and join du Pont and other wrestlers at the Foxcatcher compound to train for the upcoming World Championships and then the Olympics in Seoul in 88. At this point we're maybe 15 minutes into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest film from acclaimed director Bennett Miller, who previously brought us Capote (2005) and Moneyball (2011), so no matter what, you know you're going to get a top-notch quality movie. ""Foxcatcher"" may at first sight seem to be a sports movie, and of course there is some of that, but when you dig a bit deeper, it turns out that this is a riveting and devastating look at the relationships between unequals: of course there is the relationship between de Pont and Mark, who are about as different as night and day, but then there is the difficult relationship between the two brothers (even though he won gold, Mark desperately wants to get out from the long shadow of his older brother). And most fascinating (to me anyway), there is the relationship between John de Pont and his aging mother, just watch how that unfolds... As you can imagine, there are a number of acting performances that are just amazing, starting with Steve Carell. I thought that his performance as the average Joe Sixpack in Seeking a Friend for the End of the World a few years ago was amazing, but in his role as John du Pont he goes one better yet, like you truly have never seen him before. Mark Ruffalo is almost unrecognizable as Dave, and check out Vanessa Redgrave in the small role as du Pont's mother. But THE surprise in all of this for me turned out to be Channing Tatum as Mark, who is not the sharpest tool but simply wants to wrestle and win. From the get-go as we see Tatum practicing in the wrestle hall, I was floored by his performance all around, and I hope he will get some well-deserved recognition in the upcoming awards season. Last, there is a beautifully restrained, if not somber, musical score, composed by Rob Simonsen (there are several addition songs in the movie, including David Bowie's Fame).

""Foxcatcher"" finally opened this weekend on 2 screens at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay, but nowhere near packed, which surprised me, given the buzz that has been building around this movie in the last month or so. That said, given the rather bleak subject matter of the movie, I cannot see this becoming a big hit, even if just on the art-house theater circuit. I nevertheless enjoyed ""Foxcatcher"", and would strongly encourage you to check if out if you have the chance, be it in theaters, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Foxcatcher"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1419120000,9,3702,4.650381679389313
6873117,5,B00QK4ANEI,"A troubled, but extremely rich man in his late 40s who is seldom told no.  His opulent, secluded Pennsylvania farm and the top-notch wrestling facility he has constructed there.  His self-indulgent dream of achieving personal patriotic glory by financing and training an Olympic team.  And two brothersboth Olympiansdrawn into his orbit of delusion for financial gain and, for one, because his previously promising career is fading.  These ingredients ignite in Foxcatcher, a fascinating and grim true-crime drama with outsize concerns (economic inequality, mental illness, the United States of America) and the depth and grit required to sustain and explore them.

This is the best film Bennett Miller has directed so far, eclipsing the very fine duo of Capote and Moneyball.  For over two hours, he fashions an unyielding atmosphere of unease.  Tools at his disposal in this regard include overcast rural vistas, photographed so as to maximize the sense of frosted isolation, and the elegant intertwining of minimalist piano music and creeping silences.  He also slowly, but confidently shades and illuminates the trio of stranger-than-fiction characters under his microscope, bringing their various bonds (brother and brother, coach and athlete, master and servant) into ever sharper focus.  His actors do not fail him.  They may not strongly resemble one another, but Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum are convincing as siblings.  They at once care for, respect, and resent the other the way family members often do; their very physical movements indicate a shared lifetime of traumas and triumphs and a resulting bond beyond words.  The former is a charming and genuine presence as a paragon of athletic and domestic stability, the latter a volatile force of nature adrift in unproductive masculine angst and therefore ripe for manipulation.

And beneath the disguise of a prosthetic proboscis, comic star and former Daily Show cast member Steve Carell delivers a disturbing and revelatory dramatic performance as John du Pont, an heir to one of the United States' most storied and venerable fortunes.  It is destined to be an iconic piece of acting.  The character of John is complex and hard to describe.  He is menacing, yet also vulnerable.  He is shy and stunted, yet clearly desperate to exhibit entrepreneurial confidence and flair.  (A self-loathing master of the universe?)  He is an aficionadoan avid fan of freestyle wrestling, a published ornithologist, a stamp collectorbut never masters an interest or discipline, though he pays people to pretend he has.  Such contradictions and tensions are reflected in a performance which is grotesque and, in the strangest way, touching; we are tempted to understand and sympathize with this most peculiar man as he edges closer to the point of no moral return, but he is too frightening to let in for long.  The actor and the screenplay hint at potential justifications and motives for his behavior, ranging from an overbearing matriarch (played briefly and sharply by Vanessa Redgrave) to the psychological impact of unimaginable wealth as a birthright, while also preserving a certain haunting and tantalizing air of the inexplicable.",1417651200,149,3192,5.318725099601593
6873118,4,B00QK4ANEI,"weird. but interesting to watch, though seeing Steve Carrell in so unsympathetic a role is like watching James Garner or Andy Griffith or Tony Shahloub play the bad guy (each of them does so  and it is most unsettling)",1527033600,,218,4.589743589743589

The cast were ALL so out of their usual element and surprised me by carrying off their roles.

6873121,4,B00QK4ANEI,"This movie shows what happened when brothers and gold medal-winning wrestlers Dave and Mark Schultz had the misfortune to accept a sponsorship from insane philanthropist John Du Pont (Steve Carell). Mark (Channing Tatum), who was always in Dave's shadow, saw John's sponsorship as an opportunity to earn the recognition he felt he deserved, but as he and (especially) Dave discovered, Du Pont had his own chronic problems with seeking approval, mostly thanks to an equestrian-loving mother (Vanessa Redgrave) who considered wrestling to be a ""low sport."" Like Breaking Bad and the documentary Mr. Death, this movie also effectively demonstrates that recognition may be a basic human need and that there can be dire consequences when it goes unearned. Whether or not you already know the backstory of this movie, it is still bound to shock you. My favorite thing about it is that unlike most movies based on a true story, it doesn't use any background-providing title cards, excessive exposition, etc. The story organically flows out of the dialogue, performances and camerawork. Hopefully, Bennett Miller graces us with another movie soon because with this movie, Capote and Moneyball, he is three for three so far.",1519603200,,1215,5.235897435897436

Some incidents in this sad story have been rearranged to fit the demands of movie plotting (small spoiler:  the two brothers were never actually on the Pennsylvania estate at the same time), but the general story is accurate.  Left open is whether John DuPont (played brilliantly by Steve Carell) was motivated by more than love of country or competitive instinct in his treatment of the all-male wrestling team.  Vanessa Redgrave is great in a small role as John's overbearing mother, who thinks horseflesh noble but wrestling ""low.""  Not a cheerful story, but very well acted and worth seeing.",1518220800,3,835,4.9784172661870505

6873126,2,B00QK4ANEI,"Before watching this movie, I would highly recommend reading the book written by Mark Schulz by the same name-it helps better understand the dynamics between him and du Pont. Furthermore, I know the book is more descriptive as far how characters are etc-when I read the book, I envisioned du Pont as someone who looked either like the Joker or James Holmes. I watch the movie and see that Steve Carrell plays a drowsy subdued wannabe wrestling coach who has the attitude of if I cant have it, neither can you. I strongly feel as though in the end that was why Dave Schulz was killed. If my memory serves correct, Mark was trying to get him out of Foxcatcher as he knew of du Ponts schemes. du Pont knee Dave was Marks only friend so rather than allowing him to leave this wrestling facility du Pont decided that if he himself could not have Dave, then Mark shouldnt be able to either and killed Dave in cold blood in front of his wife. There is a lot of psychological breaking down in the book and of course, it is all about John du Pont an heir to the du Pont chemical company. The only reason Mark went to du Pont was he was out of a job and needed money but once he got there, he realized it was all about du Pont-who btw knows NOTHING about wrestling. du Pont is so pathetic he held these senior wrestling competitions in which he participated, paid off his opponent so it looked like he won and received a trophy for his work.

Mark Ruffalo is unrecognizable with his creeper beard and hunched over walk.  Steve Carell must have been wearing a prosthetic nose.

I got the impression that there were sexual overtones between John du Pont and his favorite wrestler, Mark Schultz.  It is unclear it those feelings were a two way street or not.

These brothers!-Anyone who has a sibling can relate.
The thing about this movie, and I really believe this is that the acting is so spot on, so purely physical, that you could watch this movie entirely without sound, and come away feeling like, ""Now THAT'S Acting!"" From Channing Tatum and his pure and utter betrayal and horrible boytoy posession by Carrell, and Rufalo's pure soul just reaching and reaching to try and catch his brother as he falls; so heartbreaking!-The physicality of the movie, and showing the toughness it takes, will reel you in from the get go. This movie is far more than just about wrestling. It's about the dedication put into a sport, and how it shapes you and molds who you are, and you may not come out okay afterwards. What John du Pont did to Mark and then Dave, is abominable, and this director Bennet shows it plain as day.

The movie's performances are excellent, Carell is amazing as the eccentric then schizophrenic millionaire.  Tatum and Ruffalo also bring strong performances.  I agree with another reviewer who mentioned how much creative license they took here, but I have a different complaint: They take license with things that just don't get fleshed out as interesting, and are not particularly germane to the story.  They also complete gloss over the psychological unraveling of Dupont, which is one of the most compelling parts of this story.  If you watch the 30 for 30, you are dying to compel the characters to run away from the farm screaming.  It is quite obvious the Dupont is crumbling but everyone seems to laugh it off until tragedy strikes.

This is a true story and I'm my opinion if I would have met this Dupont guy and the things he said and did and how he acted, went way beyond being eccentric. downright creepy.

6873264,5,B00QK4ANEI,"Bennett Miller's Foxcatcher is a masterpiece and is already one of the most underrated films of this decade. It's one of the most entertaining and psychologically rich films that I've seen in quite some time, and the screenplay by E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman is brilliant; this is one of the best-written psychological dramas that I can think of. In addition, Bennett Miller's direction is terrific and is further proof that he's quietly one of the best directors of his generation.

Steve Carell has rightly garnered a lot of praise for his performance here, and many critics have highlighted the incredible physical transformation he went through for this film (his prosthetic nose, in particular, has received a lot of attention). The physical stuff is notable, but there's so much more to his performance than that; the truly arresting aspects of his performance lie not in superficial things like his hair or his makeup, but in things like his voice and body language. In this film, Steve Carell demonstrates that in addition to being one of the finest comedic actors alive, he's simply a brilliant actor, period.

Vanessa Redgrave, Mark Ruffalo, and Sienna Miller (nice to see her again) are all terrific, but the real surprise here is Channing Tatum. He's largely been dismissed as a weak or mediocre actor in the past, but his performance here suggests that with the right director and with the right material, he's a very talented and promising young actor. Foxcatcher is a gem of a film, a movie that I hope grows more beloved with age as I think it's one of the best films from this decade so far.",1454284800,,1610,4.808664259927798

6873276,4,B00QK4ANEI,"FOXCATCHER (2014; released Jan. 16, 2015), directed by Bennett Miller, is a well-acted but somewhat disappointing fact-based movie about the murder of Dave Schultz (1959-1996; a gold-medal-winning Olympic wrestler) by John E. du Pont (1938-2010; a multi-millionaire who had sponsored the 1988 U.S. wrestling team).

Two relatively minor things I find fault with are the films confusing and tangential title (it comes from the name of the Pennsylvania horse farm that Du Pont owned) and the distractingly huge prosthetic nose that Steve Carell wore while playing the part of Du Pont. In an interview, Carell has said that Du Ponts nose was actually larger, but various side-by-side photos cast doubt on this; in any case, Du Ponts real nose does NOT look fake, whereas the fake one attached to Carells face very frequently does look fake.

Steve Carell (a great comic talent, who first gained wide notice on THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART) does surprisingly well in his totally serious role as  John E. du Pont, a friendless, troubled, paranoid, cocaine-using multi-millionaire, who was totally unaccustomed to hearing anyone say no to any of his desires or whims.

Mark Ruffaloas Dave Schultz, an intelligent, kindly family manis excellent, and Channing Tatumas Mark Schultz, also an Olympic gold medalist in wrestlingis good as Daves less out-going and much slower-witted younger brother. Vanessa Redgravewho plays Jean du Pont, the mother whom John du Pont never seems able to pleaseis also excellent.

The real-life plot involves Du Ponts strategies to lure Mark and Dave Schultz to his Foxcatcher Farm to serve as coaches for the 1988 U.S. wrestling team he was sponsoring, Du Ponts disappointment with Marks failure to do well in the 1988 Olympics, andafter Mark moved away from FoxcatcherDu Ponts surprising and shocking murder of Dave Schultz.

The chief thing that I found disappointing in this film was the complete lack of any plausible motives for the killing of Dave Schultzwhich occurred nearly EIGHT YEARS AFTER Mark Schultz had moved away. Some people have speculated on the Internet that Du Pont had a homoerotic fixation on Mark and blamed Dave for Marks leavingbut if this is the case, WHY the lengthy delay in taking vengeance? (The film, by the way, does not make this very long time interval at all clear to viewers, nor does it make the results of Du Ponts trial clear enough.)

Weighing together its strengths and faults, I would give this film only a B- grade.",1451606400,2,2485,5.046341463414634

The true story of filthy rich and obsessed John Du Pont (Carrell) and his devotion/psychosis about the sport of wrestling is mind blowing. His downward spiral and its consequences is intriguing.

6873288,4,B00QK4ANEI,"An Excellent movie to learn and witness the psychological dynamics between the Shultz brothers and John DuPont. Classic Rich Man Poor Man Drama for power and control. Also a stark reminder that each of us has the Human Condition and if left unchecked, can morph into the dark side of each of our personality types.

The Irony is, DuPont was living in prison all along...his whole life. Desperate for affirmation from his mother, DuPont suffered from neglect and abuse. Through some kinda Psy. defense system, he defended his identity by creating a Grandiose Delusional image of himself...but NOT Narcissism. The difference is that a Narcissist is in love with himself and believes he can do no wrong. DuPont in fact, never really loved himself but indeed HATED HIMSELF. That's what i see. He was a man who was unsettled by who and what he had become and in desperation to make his Mark on the world, thought he could ""buy"" respect and admiration. He was wrong.

The Movie points out the Human condition and particularly Men who suffered from the ego's drive to make something of themselves and to be respected by their fellow kind. Unfortunately, we all can't be super-star athletes or make Hugh contributions to society. Most of us are just regular people with no note-worthy talent that can exploited for profit or gain. Sadly, DuPont saw no other way to contribute to mankind but by using his money to manipulate and control others. However, DuPont was not a narcissist. He had accomplished nothing of note-worthiness and there was nothing to love because he never first loved himself.",1449273600,2,1588,4.877777777777778

But I digress.  So, according to the son, Jay Parker, his mother was hired to mind control program John to commit this crime on this day, and had been his programmer for decades.

There is so much to know about these wealthy criminal families.  (What they do with their children starting with infancy you would not believe.  But suffice it to say that they are creating adult psychopaths, to rule over the slaves.)

I supposed that many people suspected a sexual undertone. Surprisingly, none of those things were address nor answered, yet it was so compelling, I couldn't stop watching and wondering, long after it was over. Everything about it was haunting and intriguing, just like hearing about the story for the first time on news reports. My curiosity was not satisfied, but that was all right.

Steve Carell has proven to be more than just a funny man or a pretty face. His dedicated approach to character had depth and subtlety. Very compelling.

Steve Carell is amazing in it...many times I do not recognize him in this film as Steve Carell at all - his voice, posture, looks and attitude are entirely a work of art.  He is the consummate actor in this role.  He is DuPont!  Channing Tatum pretty much plays a typical dumb athlete looking for dreams of glory (stereotype) and Ruffalo plays his brother who has to be more responsible because he has a family, but they wrestle together and are World Champions from the Olympics.  Where the story is shocking is that these 2 World Champs have not made the millions and got the fame that other Olympians have benefited after becoming Champs, and are made vulnerable as a result of still trying to prove themselves.  Enter millionaire DuPont, who also has a dream to have a TEAM of Champion Wrestlers for the next Olympics.  All of this is based on DuPont's expertise, which has been bought and paid for by himself, as no other authority recognizes him.  You wonder during the whole movie if he is for real or just a crazy man getting off on telling this superior athletes to do whatever he wants them to do.

6873343,4,B00QK4ANEI,"The actors in this film absorb the viewer into their terse, tense face-offs. Some decades ago, popular British author V. C. Clinton-Baddeley wrote a mystery story entitled To Study a Long Silence. That title refers to a technique that acting students learn in order to hold an audiences attention. But it can be used to summarize how the characters in this movie approach each other. Despite the close physical contact that their wrestling jousts entail, they still essentially keep each other at a distance with the long breaches of silence between them.

The tension in the film comes from the enmity and imbalance that creeps into these caesuras. The caesuras become gaps - and then chasms.

But we never really get to know what might have caused this estrangement between the real-life millionaire du Pont and his protg Mark Schultz, whom these movie characters are roughly meant to represent.  Well, perhaps in the case of du Pont, there can be no satisfactory explanation for his ultimately shocking action - other than pure craziness.  But I was left wanting to know more about the transformation that overtook wrestling champion Mark Schultz. What caused his disaffection, which seems to come on suddenly? What changed him from viewing du Pont as his sponsor, mentor, friend  into viewing him as a stymieing foe? There is one scene that suggests the turning point, but it provides an insufficient answer.

So were left with no real reason for having watched this film other than to have experienced an engrossing but finally frustrating involvement in profoundly inarticulate lives. Rather than getting a hammerlock on the people and their personalities, were left with at best a half-Nelson grasp.",1440288000,,1706,5.075
6873344,3,B00QK4ANEI,"Fox catcher is a very strange film. We don't know what to make of the end of the film, it is so random and meaningless.

In the 1980s a rich man John Dupont ( Steve Carell dreams of having a training facility for wrestling facility that he calls Foxcatcher for creating wrestling champions. He has a meeting with an olympian Mark Schulz ( Channing Tatum) and invited both him and his brother to train at his facility. Mark agrees to this offers but his brother Dave ( Mark Ruffalo) does not who is happy where he is with his family and does not want to uproot them.
Mark on the other hand moves in to DuPonts estate and enters his strange world. Their relationship is shown as mentor and mentee but in a strange way. DuPont sort of corrupts Mark and taints him. DuPont also does not know anything about moderation and clearly abuses the relationship at times. Things start becoming weird and when he becomes upset with Mark, he goes to the point where he slaps him. Eventually the brother Dave joins the training camp but even though he tries to be a voice of reason and balanced. What happens after that is just too bizarre...
Foxcatcher is a good film that should be watched because of the performances of the three leads and to figure out for yourself the reason that it ended this way. Release date: 14th Nov, 2014",1440115200,,1318,4.446280991735537

Watching a movie=enjoying happy endings. Which is why, I guess, Netflix viewers gave this phenomenal movie an average of just two stars out of five.

Few films merit 5 stars, but this one comes close. Is this movie entertaining?  Not in the usual sense, although I got supreme pleasure from watching inspired performances from all three leads under what I suspect was the incredibly talented direction of Bennett Miller, (Capote, Moneyball) who won Best Director honours at Cannes for his work here.

Is the Bible entertaining? The question is not out of context here, for the movie really is a classic tale of temptation (with the Devil cleverly disguised as a wealthy man.  Foxcatcher also has elements of the Cain-and-Abel saga, too (with a similar tragic conclusion.)  And it begs the age-old question: Am I my brother's keeper?

OK, like other tragedies (from Romeo and Juliet to Apocolypse Now), not ""entertaining"" in the strict sense, but very insightful about the American psyche, very instructive about human nature.

6873406,5,B00QK4ANEI,"Some reviewers have claimed that Foxcatcher is at essence a movie about repressed homosexual tension. To me, this is an instance of the projection of an individuals own concerns and ideological framework onto a movie.

 In response, you may ask why any interpretation that I develop is in anyway different: surely I have my own dogmas and conceptual constructs that get in the way of an objective viewing. Such an objection would have some truth to it, but I would not be willing to concede the post-modern notion that there is no objective truth to any piece of art.

 If interpretation was merely projection, then I cannot see how any kind of discussion could take place about a piece of art: regardless of the question of whether it is good or bad, there must be some objectivity to what it is.

 Foxcatcher is a movie about power. The movie nearly explodes with tension: a tension between individuals dominating each other in a multitude of ways. It is also about narcissism: the attempt of someone to create a reality about themselves that is wildly disconnected from who they are.

 The movie presents events that occurred in the real lives of Mark (Channing Tatum) and Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo). Both brothers won Olympic gold medals in wrestling at the 1984 games held in Los Angeles. The movie opens with them practicing together. When Dave gets the better of his younger brother, Mark reacts with a cheap blow to the face, making Dave bleed. This action symbolises the relationship that follows: an emotionally vulnerable younger brother, who lashes out at his older brother in the knowledge that his older brother will not hurt him back; an older brother who knows the vulnerabilities of his younger brother, but does not react due to a understanding of his own role as the holder of power in the relationship and his self-definition as benevolent leader.

 The power dynamics intensify with the introduction of John du Pont, played by Steve Carell. Carell plays du Pont as a slightly disfigured man on the threshold of insanity. Carell could be criticized for overacting the role; however, the performance works when contrasted against the considered Ruffalo and the quietly brooding Tatum.

 Du Pont is the heir to one of the wealthiest families in the United States and lives in an enormous compound with his mother. His mother disapproves of him, and du Pont is desperate for her approval. We are made to feel that du Pont is a man without any achievements of his own and has bought his way to artificial success. His mother has a large stable of expensive horses, for which she has won various awards. Du Pont attempts to out-do his mother with his own stable of successful wrestlers, and in doing so gain her respect.

 With the promise of money, stability and a paternal role model, Mark takes up an offer to live in du Ponts commune as part of Team Foxcatcher. At one stage, Dave asks Mark what du Pont gets out of the relationship, to which Mark states that du Pont simply wants to help people and advance America. As the movie progresses we realise that du Pont wants to be the teams guru: their respected life coach who they look to for wisdom and support. Essentially he wants to help himself, by manufacturing a reality to confirm his narcissistic veneer.

 The movie escalates when Dave joins Mark as the coach of Team Foxcatcher. Dave realises upon arrival that Mark has entered an unhealthy relationship with du Pont: his once idealistic brother has been victim of du Ponts narcissistic rages, and is once more playing the role of the tormented child. However, this time Marks masters intentions do not contain an concern and true affection.

 Dave is the true threat to du Pont: he enjoys the true respect of the wrestlers, and has a sense of genuine authority. His authority has been won by achievement and wisdom rather than money. Dave also sees through du Ponts mask more clearly than the others, which is something du Pont both senses and resents.

 The final stages of the movie see du Ponts mask gradually slipping, and Mark moving back under the comforting shade of his older brother. Upon being revealed as psychologically disfigured to the people that he was desperate to lead, du Pont explodes under the tension, and by killing Dave murders the shame he felt towards his own weakness and ineptitude.

Foxcatcher is a magnificent account of power: power between siblings; true versus bought power; and ultimately the power that misplaced shame can have on the life on an individual and those around him.

6873423,2,B00QK4ANEI,This movie is about the slowest film I've endured in quite some time. The actors are absolutely serving crazy drama realness but the way the story plays out....snoozefest. I wouldn't even watch this on cable. I somewhat understand why it unfolds the way it does. You need the backstory to understand why the relationships formed the way they did and you get to see Steve Carell descend into homicidal madness. That's wonderful and all but I still hit fast forward through at least 20 minutes of it. I just didn't care about anything in the movie enough to watch the it all play out.,1434931200,,582,4.605769230769231

6873425,3,B00QK4ANEI,"I knew this was based on a true story but wasn't that familiar with the details.  I was kind of afraid to watch it because just the picture of the crazy-looking too rich man on the DVD's cover creeped me out.  And I don't know much about Olympic wrestling.  But the performances make this movie one to watch.  Tatum and Ruffalo are believable as brothers that care for each other deeply but are also very competitive with each other.  And Steve Carell's performance was just amazing.  Thought the ending was somewhat abrupt, but can't say I wasn't ready for it to be over.  Glad I watched it but it won't be a re-watch.",1434931200,,619,4.424778761061947

At the top is the incredible performance of the three lead actors, with Steve Carell pulling off the character of John DuPont. Also the portrayal of the brothers is remarkable... they look like the real guys, and apparently act like the real Schultz brothers.  Told in near-documentary style, the story grabbed me at the beginning and never let go -- this is a remarkable achievement in film making, and deserved each Oscar nomination it was given....  a huge thumbs UP ...",1434585600,,647,4.6902654867256635

I was impressed with Steve Carrel's acting, and can understand his desire to expand himself beyond The Office and light rom-cons.  Unfortunately he chose a script with no real structured plot holding things together,  Events just happen in this film, and there's no real feeling that you've experienced a beginning, middle and end.  Nor are any other the characters particularly likable, except for the unfortunate Dave Shultz.  Chris Hemsworth play's Shultz's brother Dan as dumber than a log, who's saved by being kicked out by DuPont for laziness.  This scene was the only one that had any real emotional impact for me.  Foxcatcher is a creepy movie about a very creepy person.  Carrel's acting is decent, but this just wasn't the right property for him to break out.",1434240000,,912,4.876623376623376

If you didn't know anything about this film you'd think it was a comedy with the DVD Cover and the actors but it's a dark, drama about two brothers who are olympian wrestlers who are at odds with each other. Channing Tatum's performance was top notch. He starts a wrestling team for Steve Carell's Mr. DuPont (of the DuPont family). Mark Ruffalo doesn't want any part in the team but finally gives in to both what appears to be his demands ($$$, security, being with his brother, having his family nearby) met.

Some senior staff would faun over him.  The movie shows how the rich are treated by common people.  All I knew of him was what I heard in the museum.

It was nothing like the man portrayed in the movie.  I knew his history, but not the man.

Everything in the movie settings is correct.  Most of the wrestlers depicted in the movie had input in it.  The wife of the wrestler, Mark Schultz, who was killed, was an adviser to the screenwriter.

Steve Carell who plays John and Mark Ruffalo who plays Mark Schultz are unrecognizable.

6873522,4,B00QK4ANEI,"Spoiler alert:

This is a tragic film based on a true story of Mark and David Schultz. These two famous brothers were world class wrestlers that both won Olympic gold medals for the USA Olympic team. They became involved with John DuPont who was a USA wrestling sponsor that used his family fortune to support the training and lives of the USA wrestling team and competitors.

John was a strange man and a multimillionaire sportsman want to be that crossed paths with Mark Schultz and ultimately murdered David Schultz. This film is about the tragic story that is based on this true story.

The film is very slow moving and at times boring because of its slow speed of action. The acting was good but the film seems to be more of a documentary in the way that it presents the story. It is a good story but very tragic and it results in a senseless death of an athletic hero. I rated the film at 4 stars. I am glad that I saw the film but I will probably not watch it again. The presentation was just strangely done in a slow and methodical manner and the odd personality of John DuPont gave the movie an eerie feeling.",1432080000,,1118,4.339712918660287
6873523,4,B00QK4ANEI,I know this was based on a true story & hard to believe it was true. Steven Carell was excellent. Just to watch him playing the part of Du Pont made it worth while to rent. But I have to say it was really bleak but a brilliant portrait of this very odd man. Will not give the ending away but it certainly was insane. I am not sure if I went to the movies & spent a lot of money on a ticket if I would have been that happy about watching Carell play this part.,1432080000,2,459,3.7422680412371134
6873524,5,B00QK4ANEI,"Foxcatcher is a pretty amazing movie. It shows both the drive to excel that underfunded athletes have and their willingness to accommodate odd situations in order to be able to train competitively. The acting was superb, including -- somewhat surprisingly -- Channing Tatum, who delivers what I think is the best performance of his career. The tension in the movie is a slow build, and the movie really focuses on relationships and internal struggles more than athletic performance. That said, the movie wouldn't work without giving insight into what it takes to win at the very top levels and how crazily athletes can react to even minor setbacks. I found the movie riveting in its slow build way, and without delving too much into DuPont's oddity (or mental illness), what ultimately takes place feels almost inevitable, which is a triumph of the script, the editing, the director and, of course, the performances.",1432080000,,916,5.032894736842105

6873538,3,B00QK4ANEI,"This is not a bad film; problem is it should have been bloody great one. It is based on the real life shenanigans of John E. du Pont - one of America's richest men. He is so rich he can have and do whatever he wants and he wants to have his own wrestling team, and go to the Olympics in Seoul  and win gold and him pretend to be the coach and get all the laurels like some latter day Roman Emperor a la mode of Nero oh and have a real friend.

He sets up a state of the art gym and lures two wrestling brothers, the Schultz brothers - played by Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo to come and join his team called `Foxcatcher'. Du Pont is played Steve Carell and all of them put in credit worthy performances and this must have been a very physical role. There is a lot of wrestling - the Roman - Greco sort not the sort that is basically bad choreography (but much more fun) and the need to be very emotional too.

The `however `here is that some scenes go on too long, even the so called scene setting at the beginning just goes on forever, this is 134 minutes long and there was so much that could have been cut that would have given this more immediacy - which is what is needed in a film that posits itself as a thriller - I would have called it a drama to be honest but that is a small point. This is still well worth watching but I think director Bennett Miller could have left a bit more on the editing suite floor as this story did not lend itself to `lyrical delivery' as it is often euphemistically called and there was a lot more to the story that would have risen it higher in the entertainment ranks too especially about Du Pont, but that is always the choice of the makers.",1431734400,,1684,4.051051051051051

6873551,4,B00QK4ANEI,"Dark gem. Tension in every scene. Nuanced character portrayals; flawless direction. Steve Carell gives a performance that is subtle, complex, and communicates what would seem incommunicable--a deeply flawed and disordered character wearing a mask of sanity in whose madness there is method, cunning, to whom the senseless makes sense. It is a haunting performance.
The script takes great liberty with the facts yet still manages to capture some essential truths, and to those who do not know the true story, at least imparts some of Dave Shultz's powerful legacy.
The viewer is advised to look into the real story and the personalities involved rather than to mistake the cinematic version for truth. In reality, both incredible champions had loving parents, their own dynamic had little to do ever with Dupont's willful yet seemingly senseless attack on Shultz, and Mark Schultz did not encourage, profit from,  or surrender to whatever predatoryhomo-erotic impulses might have driven some of Dupont's behavior, nor were those central to this terrible murder. As well, Mark Schultz is not in real life inarticulate, socially impaired, or beset and controlled by brother-envy.
So the movie takes a complicated, perhaps always-to-be inexplicable tragedy and tries to reduce it to something dramatic, relatable, and more bearable, succeeding in creating a dynamic story where personality triangulation plays a huge role, but does at the same time sacrifice an ugly truth--in no way did the Shultz brothers attract, unknowingly invite, through their own relationship somehow precipitate Dupont's evil.
PS Both men in real life have a father, and did not look to Dupont as one. Their own father, Phillip Schultz is a force in his own right--a wonderful actor and acting coach, wise, witty, elegant, deeply engaged with his children. Despite the devastating loss of His ""best friend"" and son, he has answered a call to service as a spiritual counselor while honoring Dave Schultz's life and legacy in so many ways.
Please see this movie. But more important, go to youtube for interviews with the people most affected by David Schultz's life and death, his brother, his wife, his children, his father, his friends, his community.",1431388800,,2223,5.261971830985916

6873556,4,B00QK4ANEI,"Foxcatcher is directed by Bennett Miller, director of Capote and Moneyball. That means, Foxcatcher is no more about mystery than Moneyball is about baseball. Foxcatcher may involve a real-life crime, but Bennett Millers film is about the shifting power dynamics between three people  an eccentric billionaire John du Pont (Steve Carell) and Olympic gold medal winning wrestler brothers Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) and Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo).

Foxcatcher starts with Mark Schultz speaking at an elementary school. He is clearly described as someone living in the shadow of his older brother Dave. Then a billionaire wrestling enthusiast John E. du Pont invites Mark to join his Team Foxcatcher, offering a fantastic training environment. In fact, du Pont has been feeling overshadowed by someone more powerful.

You will sense there is something not quite right with the team, however. There is a gloomy atmosphere hanging over the place, with du Pont who is unpredictable not in a good way. Dave later joins the team, which makes things more complicated. The way the director describes the events leading up to the crime is slow, to be sure, but is confident and effective nonetheless in creating the increasing tension between three principal characters played by three gifted actors.

Foxcatcher may not be what you think it is. Like Capote and Moneyball the film is very quiet, and even depressing sometimes, but worth watching credible portrayals of these complicated personalities.",1431302400,,1493,5.313559322033898

Foxcatcher has elements of realism but seems to go out of its way to be interesting.  Its beyond boring .  Its dreary in its glum dullness.

On its own the documentary style would not have bothered me, but when combined with the dreadful melancholy piano soundtrack  and Channing Tatum's glum potrayal of Mark Shultz, I just thought this movie was going out of its way to be dreary.

I admit to a personal dislike of slow, soft piano music.  But objectively I wonder what were they thinking.  The movie is slow and sombre enough as it is. Sure its a sad story but its supposed to be a story nonetheless.  There should be some interest .

At times the movie appears to be a mockery of arthouse cinema, with long quiet periods, empty spaces between cuts.  It all just got excessively dreary.  It makes me appreciate directors like Danny Boyle and David Fincher all the more.  They know how to keep a movie moving.  Bennett Miller apparently has a background in documentaries.  And ok i can understand the artistic intention to let the characters be realistic and without interference but this was extreme.  I resist using words like pompous or pretentious but it all amounts to it.  Funny thing is I wanted to like this movie and was looking forward to watching it.

Dupont was a very disturbed man but this was poorly depicted in the movie, other than by having him walk oddly and show him to think of himself as much more significant than he was.
I'm surprised Vanessa Redgrave took a part in this poorly done film.

6873748,4,B00QK4ANEI,"FOXCATCHER is a film that is easier to admire than to love, and I mean that in the best way possible. While the slow and deliberate pacing will put a lot of people off, its disturbing subject matter, psychological depth and outstanding performances make it fascinating, if not riveting. For those unaware of what the story is about (like I was), the film mostly revolves around Mark and David Schultz, two Olympic gold medal-winning wrestlers who become involved with eccentric millionaire (billionaire?) John Du Pont, specifically in preparation for the 1988 World Championship and Seoul Olympics. But wrestling is just the conduit for a deep character study of people who looked to overcome personal weakness by achieving greatness. It's really hard to say who gives the best performance out of the three leads because all of them do so well. Mark Ruffalo (who plays Dave Schultz) usually does well, and this is no exception. Steve Carell was barely recognizable as the eccentric Du Pont, greatly aided by prosthetics in his physical transformation, but also quite different in the way he spoke and carried himself compared with what roles he usually plays. I suppose the biggest surprise of them all is Channing Tatum (playing Mark Schultz) who manages to hold his own against these other two acting greats. Although he didn't have a whole lot of dialogue (and really, the film as a whole doesn't), the physicality he brought to the role was incredible in its own right. As for the wrestling scenes, they were shot well, if unspectacular. Basically they did what they needed to do for the narrative, i.e., serve as guideposts so that one didn't get lost in the pacing (and also because they were factual). What interested me the most, though, was the curious relationship that develops between John Du Pont and Mark Schultz. Du Pont takes Mark under his wing, provides him with living quarters, a training facility, and pays him, yet his status as the team coach (and quite a rich one at that) makes it where the relationship is rather one-sided. In real life, John Du Pont was the black sheep of his family and a very lonely man, and taking on Mark Schultz was a way for him to indulge in his interests and to have a friend. Now, as interesting as I find true crime, there usually has to be some stylistic choice or a scene or two which get to me in an emotional way, and this film has that as well. Both of these scenes are dialogue-free and are scored using Arvo Part's ""Fur Alina,"" a hauntingly minimal piano piece which I recently discovered. To me, these scenes (which I won't spoil) perfectly capture the film's melancholy tone. And in general, the score is rather tasteful. Often, the sound design will completely take a back seat and certain scenes will play out free of dialogue with a sort of humming that brings a subtle intensity and a growing sense of dread. Overall, FOXCATCHER is an excellent, dark character study that features some great performances and an ending that will shock you even if you see it coming. Highly recommended, as long you have a good attention span.",1428278400,2,3092,4.759776536312849

6873758,2,B00QK4ANEI,"How FOXCATCHER ever made it into the theaters much less receiving nominations for Oscars challenges credibility. ""Spoiler alert!""

Based on a true story (our current fascination with the downfallen may be the reason this won attention) FOXCATCHER relates the story of how the greatest Olympic Wrestling Champion brother team joins Team Foxcatcher led by multimillionaire sponsor John E. du Pont as they train for the 1988 games in Seoul - a union that leads to unlikely circumstances. Since this is history there can be noo spoilers - the real story made every newspaper in the world. Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum who sleepwalks through this role) is guided by his brother David Schultz (Mark Ruffalo) in wrestling training and medal winning until the wealthiest man in the world John du Pont (Steve Carell in a totally monochromatic somnambulistic portrayal noted only because of is cosmetically added large nose) enters and ruins it all, ending up destroying the brothers relationship and killing David only to die in prison.

What I did know, was that this movie is a dark and twisted film, and thats exactly what it is portrayed. The acting jobs done by Steve Carell, Channing Tatum, and Mark Ruffalo are out of the park. All three are known for being on the opposite end of the spectrum in terms of the movies they act in, and to turn their acting to a dark, awkward, and slow paced movie were truly incredible.
  The other beauty of this movie is the pace of the movie. It is extremely slow and awkward. During many times in the movie I thought there was going to be more action because of how violent the sport of wrestling is. At first I did not like this, but then after watching this movie and read more into these tragic events I realized that this helped bring out how bleak this topic really is.
  Overall, this is a good movie, but there is one big element left out. During the beginning of the movie we jump right into the life of Mark Schultz, without really knowing much about him. There is no sense of his, or even his brother Daves, true personality. Throughout the whole movie a viewer is left to piece together who Dave, Mark, and John du Pont really are, and sometimes what I believed was true turned out to be completely wrong.",1428019200,,1314,4.265060240963855

6873796,5,B00QK4ANEI,"Foxcatcher is a unique movie for that it focuses on a sport wrestling that has not been on screen much. It tells the rather disturbing story of two olympic gold medalist brothers and their multi billioner sponsor. The interesting thing is that this is not a regular success story in which the guy starts from being nothing and ends up with a big trophy at the end. It is somewhat the opposite... The movie starts in 1987 , 3 years after the brothers had already won the gold medal in 1984 LA Olympiads. They have medals but no one knows them, or supports them. Despite the lack of resources they try to keep training for future competitions. Elder brother (Dave) is mild tempered family men and plays a fatherly figure over his younger brother. The main character Mark Schultz is single with no responsibilities, knows he is better when Dave is watching over him but also not happy being overshadowed by him (A common problem when two siblings are both competitive in the same field but one stands out more..) There comes the third person ( John du Pont) who is the only heir to an extremely rich family, has power to buy everything but in reality weak, lonely and incapable in many ways. Her mother's strong influence during his childhood and even later in his life, his physical limitations in general together with his eccentric character had generated a very unhappy person who is constantly seeking respect from people around. Du Pont is fond of wrestling yet, he had never practiced it in real. When Du pont offers the brothers to train under his mentorship and guidance, things start getting complicated.

Ambition, fear, respect, disrespect, guidance, rebellion, agression, success and failure all mix into each other around the strange relationship of these three people and in the end a gun fires...

The greatest strength of the movie is the incredible level of acting. Not only the roles are psychologically challenging (Steve Carell becomes whole another person) , but also the require physical endurance and skills due to the requirements of the wrestling scenes. A great effort has been put and all actors were perfect. The directing and the scenario are also high level but I think the movie ends rather abruptly. Although the problematic relation of three is well demonstrated throughout the movie, still the last act of Dupont feels like it came out of no where. An additional 5 minutes leading to that final would flow better.

Yet this is a minor criticism which should not put you off from watching. It is a disturbing movie with continuously increasing tension and a hard core drama with a rather slow pace, so it may not be everyone's taste but I really loved it.",1427846400,,2686,4.7844827586206895

6873809,4,B00QK4ANEI,"A lot of people complain about the movie being slow, and I have to admit that it can be, especially if you are looking for something with a little more action or entertainment value. However, if you honestly appreciate good acting, good directing, good character development, and seeing some actors operating outside of their usual roles this is great movie to watch. Steve Carell does an EXCELLENT job with the du Pont character; besides the awkwardness, I've never seen him take on a role like this before. I was also impressed with the Tatum's and Ruffalo's wrestling skill, which, at least for the movie's purposes, looked like they must have trained pretty intensively to acquire.

The entire plot revolves around John DuPont's interactions with Mark and Dave Shultz and his attempts to get them to wrestle for him. Channing Tatum does nothing but sulk throughout the whole movie, making his character look like the biggest crybaby ever. Besides a little bit of condescension from his mother, the film doesn't really delve into the cause of DuPont's mental struggles.
  A much more interesting film could have been made by including DuPont's relationship with the local police and the siege laid on his estate after he shot Dave Shultz. The real story of his capture and subsequent trial is much more fascinating than how he was able to get the Shultz brothers to wrestle for him.

As it was, I could not have been more bored.  The wrestling wasn't interesting,  not that there was very much of it.  The pacing was glacier-like.  The sound-levels were so low that we pumped up the volume all the way to the max, and still had to strain.  It wasn't until a few minutes in that we realized we actually weren't missing any dialogue; there wasn't any dialogue.  Whole bits of time would pass with no one saying anything, or doing anything.  At one point I thought the video froze.  There was no background music until about the 20th minute of the movie.  This was not a fun movie to sit through, and was quite painful to everyone in the room. We kept looking at each other, trying to gauge other people's interest.  It was like a game of chicken.

6873888,4,B00QK4ANEI,The movie was  disturbing especially since it's based on a true story. It's a sad story about madness and privilege. What I didn't understand is why is Mark being portrayed as less than intelligent. In the movie he says he graduated college and in real life had a masters degree. Was he written that way or was it was because Channing Tatum was playing him? He seems to be the same in every movie.,1427241600,,397,4.364864864864865

6873895,4,B00QK4ANEI,"After hearing all the rave reviews for this film, I had to watch it.  It is a disturbing story often to the point that I actually became uncomfortable watching it.  Steve Carrell is unrecognizable due to the makeup but also in his demeanor and speech.  Without knowing ahead of time who the actor was, there's no way I would have known. His portrayal of the obsessed millionaire with mommy issues is mesmerizing.  Channing Tatum also delivers a surprisingly realistic portrayal of a down and out Olympic wrestler trying to make his mark as something more than the younger brother of a well known gold medalist and wrestling coach.  Mark Ruffalo as the affable well meaning older brother is on point as well.  The intimate physical contact element of the sport of wrestling gives the emotional struggles between the characters so much more weight and presence.  I was just completely blown away by every aspect of the movie and I usually dislike watching wrestling as a sport.  The movie is powerful and affecting.  It leaves you feeling a little haunted after you've watched it.  There is no feel good message to this film.  It's dark and depressing.  It's also one of the best films of the past year.",1427241600,,1201,4.748792270531401

6873935,3,B00QK4ANEI,"Foxcatcher is based on the true story of Olympic wrestlers, Dave and Mark Schultz and the eccentric John Du Pont.

The performances of Tatum, Ruffalo and Carell was good throughout however the story is a very slow moving one that has a lot of meaningless dialogue through a good portion of the movie.  It wasn't until the last 20 minutes or so that the movie really got going.  There is a lot of assumption and innuendo in the movie but it really fails to explore all the issues within the story and why the characters were the way they were.  It is unfortunate because the real true story is an interesting one but there is lot of nothing happening in a good portion of the movie.  The movie starts off in a slow depressing mood and stays that way throughout the movie without a real explanation. Carell is surprisingly good in his portrayal of the slightly off Du Pont.  A great story with good performances but not really told very well in a very boring slow moving drab kind of way.

Everything was a bit too submersed beneath the surface. We got very little sense of who the Schulz brothers really were in terms of their personalities and their relationship. We got more of a window into Jon duPont given his opulent surroundings and what he said about his lonely upbringing. The brief interaction with his mother spoke volumes.

You have to piece together what is going in as the speaking is more limited in this movie than the average movie.  I did not pre read any material on the true tale so everything was a surprise to me.

Channing Tatum proves himself to be more than a pretty face in this movie.  I was very impressed with his portrayal of Mark Schultz.

Besides that the pace was slow and they didn't develop the characters in a way that made me care about them. In addition when it eventually turned climatic at the end they cut the film short and didn't play out the emotional chaos that should have ensued. I even went online and researched the true story that this was based on after watching the film, and I think it could have been done much better. All in all it was a a waste of good acting especially since some of the actors (Channing Tatum, Steve Carell) don't normally have such complex roles as these. I would say that it really isn't worth the time to watch unless you have a long amount of time to kill and you feel like being even more bored.",1426636800,,822,4.2756410256410255

6874075,4,B00QK4ANEI,"There is not much talking but this disturbing story based on real events is told in a very compelling way.

The central characters are two brothers who won Olympic gold medals in wrestling and a multi-millionaire heir to the Du Pont empire, portrayed brilliantly by Channing Tatum, Mark Ruffalo and Steve Carell. The younger brother is fully focused on his training for the next Olympics, 1988 Seoul, and is excited to accept an offer of the eccentric philanthropist to train at his state-of-the-art facility. It is an opportunity for him to get out of the shadow of his older brother who was always in charge. The motives of John Du Pont are slowly coming into focus through his increasingly disturbing behaviour conveyed by Steve Carell in a haunting fashion.

This is not an action-packed movie but the storytelling is real, with just a glimpse into the world of wrestlers. Superb acting by Channing Tatum in a very different role than his usual. He does not have much dialog but he makes up for it in a lot of blank stares. And it took me a while to even recognize Steve Carell as he flawlessly portrayed the slimy and cold narcissist. A very comical scene when Du Pont coaches his protg to pronounce an introduction of his benefactor as ""Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist"".

6874101,4,B00QK4ANEI,"Quick story recap: Mark and Dave Shultz are brothers and gold medal wrestlers.  Mark always felt he achieved less because his older brother got more credit than him.  John Du Pont, a man of great wealth and power who wishes to coach, hires Mark to win a gold medal at the 1988 Olympics.  The movie is based on a true story and I was caught off guard by what happened.  A lot of interesting angles to dissect in this movie.

Great job by the acting team they are what makes the movie work so well.  Steve Carell deserved his Oscar nomination for his role as John Du Pont  with his varying levels of awkwardness and facades that his character portrayed in different situations.  Channing Tatem always is very real and believable in his role, he played Mark Shultz. And nice work from Mark Ruffalo who was Dave Shultz.being brother, coach, and fatherly figure throughout the film.

It's a slow drama but it keeps you wondering where it's going.  This movie had me guessing what the true motivations of John Du Pont were.  It was interesting to see the family angles play out between John and his Mother and between brothers Mark and Dave.  I loved that the layers to John's craziness come peeling off at different points in the movie and how he is motivated to do the things he does. This movie script and Carell do a nice job together in flushing that out.  Surprising ending if you don't know the true story, which I didn't.  Overall, I liked the movie because it was an interesting story and I enjoyed trying to figure out what was in John's mind and how Mark or Channing would react to the nutzo world John introduced him to-which is John's mind.  Interesting to see how Channing reacted to finding out who's shadow he was really living under.  Interesting drama.",1426204800,5,1764,4.534810126582278

He didn't even end up looking like the real DuPont. His acting in think was ok but it often seemed like he was doing a comic impression, mocking DuPont (which he deserved) but don't think was the intention. I think Tatum should have been the one to be nominated for best actor.  He was dead on as Mark Schultz. Ruffalo was great too I think, but wasn't in it much.

Why don't we have a thousands of psychotherapists and not psychologists able to work in closed institutions for people having such problems? Why we do not have a separate places to treat people who need help but we put them in prisons and then on the streets again? It is a film which shows how dear is the ability to recognize the consequences of the contact with such person just once in the life. The picture is disturbing and bothersome.

What was unexpected was the eerily dreamlike and impressionistic state of a film crafted by Bennett Miller of Capote and The Cruise fame.  The film borders on experimental in its unconventional storytelling and impending sense of doom aesthetic, yet at the same time seems hyper-realistic in how it makes the audience feel they are experiencing the surreal story of American patriotism gone awry.  @kmptop10",1426032000,,669,5.413461538461538

6874199,3,B00QK4ANEI,"This is just depressing.  A story, based on fact, of an incredibly rich crazy man with no redeeming value.  Why Steve Carell deserved an Oscar nomination is puzzling.  Mostly he acts like a vile, psychotic, mean version of the character he played on The Office, albeit with a wondrously absurd nose.  From a movie-watching aspect, there's no reason not to see for yourself.  Everyone does their job well enough, but, again, the result is just an utter downer.",1425945600,,459,4.833333333333333

I think Tatum may be discounted as a serious actor because of his background and some of the lighter films he has done, but I thought his performance was amazing.  Be warned the movie is a slow burn without much dialogue or action.  However, I did find certain scenes tense, and I enjoyed watching the interpersonal dynamics of each character play out in front of me rather than hearing a character provide exposition.",1425945600,,698,4.848739495798319

6874294,4,B00QK4ANEI,"Foxcatcher is a very unexpectedly creepy movie. I really didn't know it was based on a true story so that was surprising. First of all, Steve Carell is totally unrecognizable as John du Pont, this very rich man who basically becomes a wrestling coach just because he wants to be and has the money to do it. I believe that he does love wrestling but his motivations for becoming the primary sponsor of this team are questionable and the movie does a superb job examining why he was drawn in. There's a scene where he's congratulating his team's victory with champagne and he begins wrestling the boys and crawling all over the floor with them and it was actually VERY uncomfortable and made me feel horrible. I love when a movie can really throw a wrench in your mind and make you feel embarrassed for a character while still caring about them enough to feel sorry for them? What's interesting is that the other half of the story is focused on these two Olympic Gold medalist brothers Mark and David Schultz (played by Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo respectively) who are actually super passionate about their sport and are trying to leave an impression in the history of wrestling as two of the top talents. They seem like genuinely good people. I thought that Mark was a little weird, too. He seems pretty depressed? And I felt like his willingness to fall under Du Pont's spell and succumb into a cocaine addiction were reflective of his low self-esteem and living in the shadow of his bigger brother Dave. I have to say that Mark Ruffalo blew me away in this film. I thought he was Oscar-worthy. He's so sensitive to John du Ponts situation, while still being skeptical and truly wants to be involved in the life of  his baby brother. I felt that Mark Ruffalo perfectly played this guy and he should have won the Oscar over J.K. Simmons corny teacher in Whiplash, bottom line. Channing Tatum does an OK job, too and Steve Carell gives a very quiet, creepy interesting performance as the man who does not see a world of boundaries due to his privileges. He's psychotic. But not in that flashy ""movie"" way. It's very disturbing, actually how well he played that role.
Bennett Miller directed this and another favorite film of mine, Capote. Both films are somewhat similar.
They explore a basic true story in a very deep, meditative way. I think hes one of the finest directors working today. Foxcatcher is a careful and respectful contemplation of loneliness, regret, fraternal love, jealousy, pride and success. Its also examining limitations and respect and just being human, in general. I thought it was a great movie.",1425945600,,2623,4.702173913043478
6874295,4,B00QK4ANEI,"Sports-themed films aren't often my thing, but with this cast alone - though knowing little about the subject - I was eager to give the Oscar-nominated Foxcatcher a try.  The brothers Schultz - Dave (Mark Ruffalo) and Mark (Channing Tatum) - are Olympic gold-winning wrestling champions when Mark is ""discovered"" by millionaire John du Pont (an unrecognizable Steve Carell), who wants to move Mark to his estate and help him form a winning team for the upcoming 1988 Olympics.  Though du Pont wants both brothers, Dave is settled into life as husband and father, so this becomes Mark's chance to step out from under his older brother's shadow and prove himself.  Dazzled by the eccentric du Pont's wealth and seeming faith in him, Mark is determined to be the best, but as the trials get closer and du Pont's erratic behavior gets worse, the brothers find themselves on a dark path that leads to unexpected results.

Watch it for him if you have the patience to sit through it. Not a bad film, just not much material in the middle of the movie. An intriguing opening and shocking ending that makes it compelling.

6874299,5,B00QK4ANEI,"""Foxcatcher"" is the story of the Schultz brothers, Mark and Dave, who grew up living and breathing wrestling.  The movie opens with Mark (expertly played by Channing Tatum) addressing an assembly of gradeschool children about what it means to win a gold medal.  The viewer can tell Mark is wrapped a little too tight for comfort.  He cannot take a walk that he isn't trying some sort of wrestling move.  He cannot stand in front of a mirror that he isn't performing some sort of wrestling ritual.  To me, he was a walking, talking, timebomb.  We are then introduced to Mark's brother, Dave--happily married with two children.  For whatever reason(s), Mark feels he has stayed in the shadow of his older brother.  Their relationship (if you can call it that), revolves completely around wrestling:  how to make this move, how to take this person down, where to grab your opponent, how to get out of an opponent's hold.  Their rivaly is very real because in the first sparring incident, Dave suffers a bloody nose due to Mark's over-exhuberance.

Mark is livng in squalor (Ramen Noodles included) until he receives a telephone call from an employee of John DuPont, who offers to bring him to Pennsylvania, pay him very good money, all so DuPont can start his own Olympic wrestling camp, Foxcatcher.  Steve Carell plays John DuPont, and had I not known that going in, I would have NEVER recognized him.  His performance was nominated for an Academy Award, as it should have been.  His portrayal was mesmerizing and scary.  It seems he wants to live his life vicariously through Mark.  Yet, for all his good intentions, he turns into a cancer for Mark.  He tries to sell this image that he is the students' mentor, yet I'm sure he never wrestled a day in his life.  It was his money that could buy him whatever he wanted.

I am not going to go further into the storyline because I do not want to ruin this movie.  It is well acted by everyone, well directed, and left me in shock at the end.  From the beginning of the movie, the viewer can tell something bad is going to happen; you just don't know what it is.  I have seen a few other reviews stating this movie is boring, too long, whatever; so, if you want an ""action"" movie, I suggest ""John Wick.""  The movie is rated ""R"" for language, brief nudity, and some violence.  Highly Recommended.",1425859200,,2340,4.583132530120482

6874308,5,B00QK4ANEI,"This was one of the most viscerally disturbing movies I have ever watched. If it didn't happened it would be too strange a story to make into a film. But it did happen. And you realize that you are watching a depiction of actual madness, not something fictional, leading up to an actual murder. That this is a real story makes it incredibly uncomfortable to watch. It was jaw-dropping at times. Carell captures Du Pont perfectly, and what there is to capture is truly insane. The acting is excellent and the film is very well made.

Yet while a deeply troubling exploration of madness, the movie is also a moving story of athletic dedication. Wrestling is among the purest Olympic sports there is and the dedication it requires is extraordinary. The story of John Du Pont's insanity plays out in a circumstance where Olympic caliber athletes were not supported and had few other places to turn. There is a sense of desperation that results in these athletes getting trapped with a madman, not having a means of easy escape. It adds to the tension and sorrow as they constantly have to humor a very disturbed man and a ticking timebomb. They are caged with him.

This film is also a nice tribute to David Schultz, one of the greatest athletes the United States ever produced who would have been our Olympic wrestling coach today in all likelihood. What made this movie so powerful to me is how a story of something horrific, Du Pont's insanity, was told in the context of something truly beautiful, the pure love of sport. How the one is so intertwined with the other here is what makes it tragic and disturbing, and yet so sublime.",1425772800,,1631,4.620689655172414

This film caught me completely unprepared and unaware. I'd never heard of this film (despite the waves it made on the Cannes-Golden Globe-Oscars awards circuit, as I later came to discover), though, perhaps strangely, I had followed the story of John du Pont and the real story some years earlier. So, it was with some interest that I clicked on the trailer, the film having oddly come up admidst a flurry of recommendations for horror films I'd been sifting through. Needless to say, the trailer drew me immediately in.

Still, I have to admit, I was not expecting the film experience that followed. From the opening scenes, I was immediately drawn into the characters, and Channing's obvious prior wrestling training lent a smooth authenticity to the role (as did his character affectations, such as the stiff walking style, cauliflower ears, etc.

But, for me the standout performance was easily Carell. With the prothetics, his transformation into a deeply, profoundly disturbed du Pont absolutely made me forget he was, beneath it all, the comedian I'd seen so many times. In fact, I was in such disbelief I had to check two different websites to verify that it really was him.

For some reason, this film reminded me of the relationship between Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix in The Master (another brilliant, dynamic acting interaction, btw).

The film also suffers the same fate most ""biographical"" or ""based on a "" true story movies do, which is you have to leave so much out its often easy to leave - too - much out, and you're left with just a shell.  In this case i didn't really see much justification for what happens at the end.  I knew it was coming but the movie doesn't build a very strong foundation as to why it happens.

Overall, I found it very compelling.  The 2nd hour of the movie has a somewhat strange pace and tone, and I could see where some might think it lags a bit...but I overall got where the plot direction was going, and thought it made sense based on characters established in the first half of the film.  The ""homeward stretch"" of the plot was carried out more by the ""subtext,"" demeanor and body-language of the characters, versus being totally spelled out by the dialogue...I personally think this makes it a more realistic and engaging movie.

The performances by Tatum, Ruffalo, and Carell are all excellent in the story-telling.  Carell's character is nearly as compelling as his Michael Scott ...in a different way obviously, but in terms of creating a unique character very well done.",1425513600,2,1441,4.872950819672131

6874341,3,B00QK4ANEI,"Theres a part of me that wishes that Bennett Miller would direct a film about Mark Schultzs Twitter rampage over his direction of Foxcatcher, because I have a feeling that that film would be more entertaining than this one was.  That isn't to say it would be a better film, because entertaining has very little to do with quality, but there is something almost stagnant about Foxcatcher that makes it hard to fully invest in.  Some have called this glacial, but I was rooting for this because slow and brooding and cold and detached are qualities that Im not always turned off by, when they serve the purpose of the film, and Bennett Miller has infused these qualities into his last two films (mostly in Capote), and I was a big fan of both.

This was hard to watch, for more than one reason.

The story behind Foxcatcher is a truly intriguing one.  Since the films release, despite the critical reception and initial adoration from the films subject, Mark Schultz, Schultz turned to accusing the film of being largely fabricated and misleading.  How much of his ranting and accusations I actually believe is debatable and fluctuates from day to day, since so does his attitude towards the film itself.  But, Im not unaware that film often fabricates for dramatic effect, and so I know that this is not the whole truth but more an interpretation of the truth.

This doesnt bother me.

The story told is that of the Schultz brothers, Mark and Dave, who are wrestlers at different ends of the spectrum.  Dave is respected and lauded, a family man who loves what he does but knows that place in which it should all be put.  Mark is alone and feeling defeated, a man who stumbles along in the shadow of his more charming brother, who lives his life in a lonely stumble towards a greatness he wishes to achieve but sees as something sorely out of reach.  The pair shares a bond that keeps them within arms reach but that bond isn't enough to keep them securely close.  Then a strange presence asserts itself into their lives in the form of John du Pont, an eccentric millionaire who is struggling with his own demons (an unsupportive and disapproving mother) and sees a chance to achieve his own idea of greatness through the use of these brothers.

Initially reaching out to Mark, and offering him the chance of a lifetime (a nice paycheck and full use of his gym with the power to handpick is own training team), du Pont claims to be only interested in seeing USA take the Gold in the 1988 Olympics, but below the surface brims a madness that festers with each passing day.

Unfortunately, the madness is lost in translation, at least for me.

There are themes painted within the fabric of this story that feel achingly universal and, if manipulated in the right manner, could have really taken this to another level of storytelling, but I found a large facet of this film to be somewhat dead, which only caused the concentrated and intentional cold tone of the film to become increasingly overwhelming and distracting.

My problem was Steve Carell.

Carell took a risk.  He took a plum role, that of an eccentric and manipulative and borderline (is it really borderline?) crazy man and played him VERY low-key.  This is a character that could have easily been given a very hammy and elaborate portrayal, which would have been a disaster of sorts as well, but it is also a character that was ripe for just the right amount of pathos under the surface to bring him to screaming life and create a man who haunts our dreams.  Carell is just there.  He raises his head at an awkward angle and talks around that beak of a fake nose with the slow drawl of a mentally challenged person and peers out of his dead-eyes with the look of an actor trying desperately to prove that he can handle this.  Sadly, he couldn't handle it, and because of that this man becomes less of a haunting figure and more of a stain on a film that could have made a richer impact had the climax felt more authentic within the fabric of the story itself.  When du Pont snaps and actually shoots Dave, it feels anticlimactic despite being such a harrowing moment.  Carell fails to really portray much of anything, other than a checklist of trying to act serious.  Carell has handled serious before, but this was out of his depth.

It doesnt help that both Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo are so organic in their portrayal of the Schultz brothers that every time they share the screen with Carell, his flawed performance takes center stage.  Together they are remarkable, their weight shifting in ways that show a true commitment to their characters, a true understanding of the dance they must dance in order to portray these men with such believable accuracy.  Separate, they are just as good.  Ruffalo has such natural charm that his subtle turn comes to life with such urgency, such naturalism.  You believe him every step of the way.  He also has the very best scene in the film, that interview scene, which says so much; SO MUCH!  Tatum lumbers around with a performance that, on the outset seems very one-note, and yet there is something extremely grounded behind those eyes, unlike Carell.  You can see the ache, the heartbreak that rests behind the broken man who just wants something more.  The hotel scene, after he loses his first match, is a remarkable moment of an actor actually filling in all the gaps of a persons every single thought.

This man, this ape, this machine; such crushingly brutal honesty in his desperation to be better than he is.

Bennett Miller directs Foxcatcher with a specific tone in mind, and its clear from the first few sequences.  The fog completely suffocates the scenery and develops a character all its own by becoming this weighty presence that lingers over every scene.  The problem is that the haunting nature of the cinematography and score and lingering shots (its so tragically beautiful to watch) is interrupted by a performance that should have playing into the atmosphere and given it heft, but instead he drops it and allows Miller to do all the work, and he simply cant carry this all the way on his own.  Because of this, the film feels more stagnant and lifeless than chilling and haunting.

The reception of Foxcatcher has been somewhat divisive.  I truly expected to be a champion of this film, based solely on my reaction to the story itself and to my reaction towards Millers past work, but sadly Im not in this films corner.",1425513600,,6451,4.6376429199648195

I don't know who it helps that this movie was made, but all you have to do is watch it to know that it's a lie. The movie is a lie, it never happened. What really happened during the time when these titles were won was not witnessed by the author of this screenplay. That author had glasses on that would paint the world in a nonexistent color. His shades put hells flames all around the landscape where they did not exist.

In the theater where I watched this abomination, 6 out of 8 people got up and left before it was over.

There's one thing that is to be praised about ""Foxcatcher"", believe it or not. The wrestling was quite good. If you take it's wrestling and put it up against others in the genre, like Vision Quest, Foxcatcher looks as though it should win an Oscar. The men did a fine job learning the sport in a quantity and quality sufficient to pass as realism. Which no other wrestling movie, besides documentary's, do - that I'm aware of.

6874349,5,B00QK4ANEI,"""Foxcatcher"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Based on true events, Foxcatcher tells the dark and fascinating story of the unlikely and ultimately tragic relationship between an eccentric multi-millionaire and two champion wrestlers. When Olympic Gold Medal winning wrestler Mark Schultz is invited by wealthy heir John du Pont to move on to the du Pont estate and help form a team to train for the 1988 Seoul Olympics at his new state-of-the-art training facility, Schultz jumps at the opportunity, hoping to focus on his training and finally step out of the shadow of his revered brother, Dave. Driven by hidden needs, du Pont sees backing Schultz's bid for Gold and the chance to ""coach"" a world-class wrestling team as an opportunity to gain the elusive respect of his peers and, more importantly, his disapproving mother. Flattered by the attention and entranced by du Pont's majestic world, Mark comes to see his benefactor as a father figure and grows increasingly dependent on him for approval. Though initially supportive, du Pont's mercurial personality turns and he begins to lure Mark into an unhealthy lifestyle that threatens to undermine his training. Soon du Pont's erratic behavior and cruel psychological game-play begin to erode the athlete's already shaky self-esteem. Meanwhile du Pont becomes fixated on Dave, who exudes the confidence both he and Mark lack, knowing that these are things even his money cannot buy. Fueled by du Pont's increasing paranoia and alienation from the brothers, the trio is propelled towards a tragedy no one could have foreseen.

The cast led by Steve Carell (in a superb, transformative, Oscar-nominated performance as John du Pont), Channing Tatum (very solid in a well-crafted performance as Mark Schultz) & Mark Ruffalo (impressive in his Oscar-nominated performance as Dave Schultz) is brilliant. The directing (Oscar-nominated) by Bennett Miller (also produced) is brilliant. The story & screenplay (Oscar-nominated) by E. Max Frye & Dan Futterman is brilliant.

The music by Rob Simonsen, additional music by West Dylan Thordson is brilliant. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is brilliant. The film editing by Jay Cassidy, Stuart Levy & Conor O'Neill is brilliant. The casting by Jeanne McCarthy is brilliant. The production design by Jess Gonchor (also second unit director) is brilliant. The art direction by Brad Ricker is brilliant. The set decoration by Kathy Lucas, set dressings by Timothy Barnhill, Edgar Um Bucholtz, Eugene Doyle, Ray Pivirotto, Josh Drylie, Elaheh Ferrari, Samuel Noel, Brandon A. Plonka & Aaron Streiner & set designs by Kate Dougherty is brilliant. The costume design by Kasia Walicka-Maimone is brilliant. The make-up design & effects (Oscar-nominated) by Bill Corso are brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Peter Bucossi & fights coordinated by Jesse Jantzen is brilliant. The visual effects coordinated by Andrea Atwater, Gillian Pearson, Cary Green, Juthika Rajwade & Naz Shams, supervised by John Bair, Jake Braver, Jon Tanimoto, Dan Schrecker, David Isyomin, Chris LeDoux, Daniel Mellitz, James Pastorius & Jim Rider is brilliant. The special effects coordinated by Ray Tasillo is brilliant.

This is a brilliant, well-crafted and well-made film that is entertaining and well-done. Steve Carell is superb in his well-crafted and transformative Oscar-nominated performance as John du Pont, Channing Tatum is also very solid in his well-crafted performance as Mark Schultz & Mark Ruffalo is just as impressive in his well-crafted Oscar-nominated performance as Dave Schultz.

FOXCATCHER is the tragic story of two Olympic Champion wrestlers and their million benefactor John E. DuPont. DuPont wants to use his money to train an Olympic team for the 1988 Seoul Olympics. It all seems innocent enough until the deep psychological problems of DuPont become clear. FOXCATCHER is based on the true events that led to a heartbreaking tragedy.

What starts off as a perfect paring begins to strain when Mark's brother joins the team. There is no way to talk about this movie without talking first about the performance by Steve Carell. He is known primarily as a comic actor so he was an interesting choice to play someone as off kilter as du Pont. The fact that it was him though made the character that much creepier. The make-up is so good that it is easy for you not to think of Carell in the role and it adds to the impact of the movie. The way he plays du Pont is so unsettling. Prolonged stares and pauses really make you feel uncomfortable for almost the entire movie, and that is a good thing. I remember when the actual events happened but that did not detract from the enjoyment of the movie at all. I also have to admit that Channing Tatum did a fantastic job in this and I really think it should have been him rather then Ruffalo who should have been nominated for this movie.

He chooses Olympic level wrestling as his goal which he pursues with a cold and inhuman passion. This psychopath's victims are the Shultz brothers (Olympic gold medal winners) whom he uses as the nucleus for his wrestling club. He is a control freak without regard for others, and he only uses the Schultz brothers so as to pursue his single minded dream to lead his team to victory for his own self-aggrandizement. When the brothers have no purpose for him, or don't oblige in his fabricated self-mythmaking, he disposes of them as if they were worthless nothings. It is a painful thing to watch as Dave Schultz(Dave Ruffalo) is asked to say for the camera what du Pont's director wants him to say about du Pont's brilliance as a mentor even though Dave doesn't believe it. When Dave refuses to oblige this leads to deadly consequences.

It is not the masterpiece that it may have had the potential to be. And it goes without saying, certainly not a feel-good experience. This film is however a very aesthetically absorbing, strange journey into a twisted world. The look is very particular, and somehow attractive in spite of its gloom. Carell does a fine job of channeling his exceptionally strange character. I have to say that honestly, it was easy for me to see the actor through the makeup and mannerisms, possibly because John Du Pont is kind of like a darker, alternate version of Michael Scott (from The Office).

6874365,3,B00QK4ANEI,"Bennett Miller has done a few fascinating things with Foxcatcher. Hes made a chilling, calculated drama with knockout performances all around. Its unfortunate though, that the script leaves a lot to be desired. With minimal dialogue, Miller lets the camera do the talking, which provides for some solid characterization but little impact.

Foxcatcher tells the true story of Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), who strikes up a friendship with millionaire John du Pont (Steve Carell) who is sponsoring Team Foxcatcher for the 1988 Olympic Games. Du Pont takes a liking to Schultz, and the two form an unlikely partnership. Du Pont is driven by his disapproving mother while Schultz is driven by his personal ambition and his brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo), also an Olympic gold medalist. Du Pont and Schultzs friendship goes to extremes, and there is exponential buildup to a great finale. Its an excellent story that warrants being told, but Miller struggles along the way.

The fault lies in the script itself. The film is both exciting and drab, both harrowing and unaffecting. The problem is that Miller never delves too deep into the characters themselves, and instead wants us to conclude from what we see on screen. This is storytelling 101, and could work in the right hands, but the film has many discrepancies in its characterization, especially with the character of Du Pont. Not much happens in the film, and we are expected to connect with Schultz when he give us little to connect to. There isn't much of a personality to the film; its personality is almost nonexistent. Dark and dreary films can have character, just look at the recent Gone Girl, but with Foxcatcher there isn't much that stands out.

What does stand out, though, are the performances. Carell is indescribable. A force to be reckoned with as John du Pont. Hes one of the scariest villains of the year. The films little dialogue gives every line meaning, and Carell delivers. Physically, too, hes fascinating. Some excellent cinematography from Greig Fraser gives us beautiful shots, and du Ponts profile is astounding. The prosthetic nose added to Carell will make you forget he was ever the star of a popular sitcom for 10 years. Thats what roles like these should do, they should separate you from your prior work. A lot of actors struggle with this, but in Carells case he knocks it out of the park. Supporting roles from Tatum and Ruffalo are equally as good, especially Ruffalo. Tatum, not known for films like this, makes his case as a solid dramatic actor, but its Ruffalo who really stands out. While he isn't on screen too much, when he is hes great. Its a subtle role, requiring tight intonation and Ruffalo nails it. A family man, hes different from his ambitious brother, and the film keeps reminding us throughout.

Foxcatcher is a polarizing film. It tackles some great themes, but its a jack of all trades, master of none. The depressing mood throughout seemed to suck any character of the film right out, and were left with a weak and uneven drama. Sure its a great plot, but isn't told in the best way. Worth seeing for the performances alone, Foxcatcher wasn't what I was expecting. I wouldnt call it a let down, but don't expect to be blown away.",1423958400,10,3256,4.840215439856373

This is a deeply human and somewhat scary film that allows the viewer to make its own mind up.

6874370,4,B00QK4ANEI,"When people talk about the ""feel"" of a film they might mean various things: the lighting, the setting, the general look of things, or even the camerawork perhaps.  Foxcatcher's brooding and palpable atmosphere sticks to the skin long after the movie is over, and I think this is partly because of the way in which it operates via its setting more than its plot. The effect is truly enveloping.

John Du Pont's mansion serves as center-piece, a saturnine omniscience towering within a thick and beautiful annulus of bleak fog: something doesn't feel right with this place, and our stay doesn't feel welcome.  Du Pont's mother might be the film's silent MacGuffin, always lurking out of view, languished with disappointment in her son.  Her relationship to him is complex, and we sense a protean darkness lingering within their family history.  I loved this aspect to the movie, and it is certainly one of its most mystifying elements.  Her role feels elusive, yet also inextricable to this setting, a watcher from afar, seeing everything for what it actually is.  If anything, I see her and Ruffalo's character as the only sane people in the movie.  Her relationship with Du Pont is tenuous and dispirited at its best, and their connection never completely reveals its purpose within the film's machinery; yet it evokes a certain wistfulness, a deep sadness, two emotions that all the characters of the film seem to share.

This desperate longing is the driving force behind many of the character's actions: they are addicted to a raging competitiveness that can only be engendered by American sentiment, a consuming pursuit of glory, fame, and power.  Mark Schultz, who is played by Tatum, and Du Pont (Carrell) are despicable characters that are willing to waste away everything precious and tender in their lives in exchange for glory and respect.  It's all about winning, dominating, being the best.

Foxcatcher is probably best considered a performance piece.  This is a true drama, above anything else it might be considered, with Channing Tatum, Mark Ruffalo and Steve Carell giving some of the best performances of their lives, holy cow.  This is some of the most believable, realistic acting and dialogue I have seen in a long time.  Rarely a film like Foxcatcher will come along that doesn't have a single ounce of contrivance to any of its dialogue or sequence of events; everything feels starkly real compared to other films, so much to where it's a little disturbing.

As far as the pacing is concerned, Foxcatcher is certainly a slow burn, but that is to its favor. This is the sort of movie that wants to convince you of its world and merge you with its psychology--one seething with neurosis and progressive paranoia--as opposed to just gripping you by the throat and throwing you in.  The pacing is profoundly deliberate, a slow-rolling rhythm that might take some patience at first, but once you're in sync you begin to sense its purpose and enjoy the ride.

Although, ""enjoy"" might not be the best word here.  Foxcatcher is a difficult, yet fascinating film.  It's probably something to admire more than love; and yet there are some incredibly suspenseful moments that show up unexpectedly, one of which takes place in Du Pont's helicopter on the way to a large dinner party.  I won't spoil it for you, though.

So much could be analyzed in Foxcatcher, but it's also just worth seeing for the incredible atmosphere and performances.  Bennet Miller has made his best movie, (in my opinion), with Foxcatcher, a precise film that, I think, will be studied for quite some time.  It's a dark and tremendously moody experience that might take some patience at first, but one that manages to awe us with its dark spirituality in every scene.",1422576000,7,3752,4.900316455696203

6874372,4,B00QK4ANEI,"This weekend, I had the pleasure of watching two films with extraordinary performances from the leads, making each memorable and insanely watchable. But in each film, decisions were made effectively marring the overall experience, making each 'Very Good' instead of Extraordinary.

In the late '80s, John du Pont (Steve Carell), one of THE du Ponts, decides to build a state-of-the-art wrestling facility on the family's estate outside Philadelphia. He states that he wants America to achieve greatness at the Seoul Olympics, but he has deep, hidden reasons for wanting to do this, one of which is to gain the approval of his mother (Vanessa Redgrave) who has raised and ridden horses her entire life. John reaches out to Olympic gold medal winner Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), who has had a real struggle since winning the medal at the 1984 Los Angeles games. Quiet, insular and very impressionable, Mark jumps at the chance to coach a team at John's facility. But John decides Mark is not achieving the results he needs and coaxes Mark's brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo), a highly respected trainer, to move the whole family out to his property and to take over for his brother. Mark isn't too happy, but the brothers eventually work things out and this leaves John out of the circle, which doesn't set right with him.

Written by E. Max Frye (writer/ director of ""Amos & Andrew"") and Dan Futterman (an actor who also wrote ""Capote"") and directed by Bennett Miller (""Capote"", ""Money Ball""), ""Foxcatcher"" features incredible performances from all three leads. But Miller chooses to tell this story in an austere way which makes it almost impossible to build sympathy for John, Mark or Dave. Because we don't feel for any of the characters, watching the film becomes an experience akin to watching an actual documentary. You start  looking at the information and pull even further away from the performances.

I understand why Miller chose to tell the story in this way - a significant portion of the film involves the tale of John du Pont, a member of the richest-of-the-rich upper class, someone who has great difficulty showing emotion. Mark also has a lot of difficulty opening up to others and is a very silent guy. It wouldn't be right to see either of them walking about, hugging others, showing their emotions. But ""Foxcatcher"" still makes for a very strange experience.

Carell, in particular, spectacularly cast against type, does a fantastic job bringing John du Pont to life. You will quickly forget you are watching a man who is best known for his work as a comedian as he tilts his head back (the better for the 1% to look down on others), squints his eyes and flashes his gummy, insecure smile. As soon as we meet du Pont, we realize their is something uneasy, unnatural about him. He doesn't quite get how to relate to others, which is most likely a product of his upbringing. But he still has the innate need to make something of himself, if for no other reason than to gain the approval of his mother. He turns his attention to his one true calling and builds a wrestling facility on the grounds of the family estate not far from Gettysburg. He jumps at the chance to mention how he is doing this for the ""good of America"" and how he wants to renew our ""faith in America"", but John doesn't seem to be entirely convinced of this mission or he is using it as a subtext for something else, something a little more lurid.

I enjoyed every minute of Carell's performance, for the same reason I always thought he was so brilliant as Michael Scott on ""The Office"". Carell brought a lot of insecurity to his portrayal of Michael Scott, so every time he makes a statement, proving what a blowhard he is, there is a brief flicker of the eyes, or a slight frown, showing that the bravura is simply a costume he wears in order to be what he believes is an effective leader of his team at Dundler-Mifflin. And of course, Michael Scott is just the opposite, yet everybody still loves him. Except for maybe Toby?

As John du Pont, Carell also tries to hide the man's insecurities, but these character traits are much more front and center, making them more difficult to hide. Yes, he is one of the richest people in America, yet he still feels he needs a purpose in life. So he turns to wrestling and attempts to build a world-class team. But he is also in this for the glory, so as he builds the team, he also participates in a match, winning a trophy. He proudly shows the trophy to his mother, trying to win her approval, trying to impress her. Later, when she visits the training facility, clearly at the invitation of her son, he interrupts the wrestlers' training with Dave to become their trainer and demonstrate some moves in front of his mother.

There is an undercurrent of creepiness to du Pont. The wrestlers clearly would rather he didn't participate in their training, they seem to get a feeling from him, they seem to sense that something else might be going on. But du Pont continues to force himself upon the wrestlers, upon Mark and upon Dave, desperate for recognition, desperate for a connection.

Carell's du Pont is the type of performance that can and should be recognized for an Oscar - the role is so different from anything he has ever done and he does it extremely well, proving that he can be a force in all genres of film.

Bennett Miller, the director of the film, did a brief Q & A after the screening I attended. He talked about casting Channing Tatum first, when he first started working on the film eight years ago. He commented that at that point, he was interested in casting an unknown as Mark Schultz. I know. That statement also generated a chuckle in the audience. Tatum is now about as far from unknown as possible. But eight years ago, when the finished film was but a glimmer in Miller's eye, unknown. He's good to look at, but is he a good actor? In much of his previous work, I would say 'No', just a pretty face. But in ""Foxcatcher"", Tatum brings a lot of complexity to his portrayal of Mark Schultz. It is easily the best performance of his career so far.

As soon as Mark first appears on screen, we know something isn't completely right about him. He seems quiet, withdrawn, lonely. But part of this is due in part to the way he feels he has been treated since becoming an Olympic gold medalist; he lives in a cheap, broken down apartment eating ramen noodles. He spends time every day training with his brother. Their time together illustrates the length and depth of their bond - Dave pretty much raised Dave and they have a practiced routine when training, so a lot of words are not necessary.

Tatum brings a lot of non-verbal cues to portrayal of Mark, something which seems completely natural. But more importantly, this is consistent throughout allowing us to become a part of Mark's world, to really start to get into his world and his space, as much as possible given his extremely introverted nature.

Mark Ruffalo plays older brother David, a well-respected and much loved wrestler and trainer. Ruffalo has a less showy transformation, but he still does a remarkable job giving us a portrait of David. Because of their bond, David shows up at du Pont's training facility and can see Mark is having some problems. As soon as he starts training the wrestlers, Mark remains on his own, doing things his own way. But David is eventually able to get through to his brother and this reaffirms the bond they share, making them closer than ever. Once David reestablishes this connection, he acts as a gate keeper, keeping John away from Mark.

And John doesn't appreciate this.

As the story continues, the strange, undefined dynamic between all three men seems to change and evolve (or devolve depending on how you look at it) with every word and every interaction. This change makes ""Foxcatcher"" an engaging film, always holding your attention.

But about halfway through, you begin to realize something is missing. The austerity of the surroundings, and the detached nature of two of the three leads, makes it difficult to connect with anyone or to get completely involved in the story. Miller does this intentionally, to mirror the surroundings, but keeping the audience at arm's length is a tricky idea. On the one hand, it does help to reinforce the ideas behind two of the characters, so it works to paint a more complete picture. But on the other hand, if we are so detached from everything, we don't feel for anything and that makes watching the film a little more hollow.

There is also a lot of stuff that is barely hinted at in the film and nothing is stated explicitly. This is an interesting choice by Miller, yet it works because our imagination is left to fill in the blanks. And our imagination is usually more vivid.

""Foxcatcher"" is a very good film containing three great performances. It falls just short of being a great film because it doesn't really connect us to any of the characters or the narrative. Without that connection, it feels like we are watching a documentary. And that isn't such a great thing.",1422403200,2,9084,4.656269494697442

6874375,3,B00QK4ANEI,"Theatrical review.  I guess you could call this the ""minority report"" as this movie has garnered numerous award nominations.  I was eagerly looking forward to seeing it, but now I think it is the biggest disappointment of the year.

In the late `80's, the U. S. Wrestling team was ""coached"" and housed by one of America's richest men, John du Pont (Steve Carell) of the du Pont chemical companies.  He has little to do as he does not get involved in the operation of the parent company.  So he sees himself as a good American and agrees to fund the team with a $500K annual endowment with the proviso that he be the coach.  It isn't clear what his qualifications are.  It appears none.  But he has money so the U. S. team goes along.

His prize pupil is Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), who like his older brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo) won gold in the '84 L. A. Olympics.  John du Pont is a creep and Carell plays him to the hilt from his funky looking nose to his awkward gait.  During the course of the film, the shy and withdrawn Mark goes from a training fiend to a drunken, coke addict with little resistance from du Pont.  Eventually, John recognizes he doesn't have the skills to actually train this level of athlete and finds Mark not demanding enough to lead.  So he hires Dave.

There is a psychological barrier between Mark and his brother.  John has led Mark to believe that he's been riding Dave's coattails.  When Mark fails to qualify for the '88 Olympics, du Pont cuts him lose but retains Dave as coach.  But Dave isn't the puppy dog that Mark was.  So in a well-publicized tragedy, du Pont inexplicably shoots Dave point-blank in front of his wife (Sienna Miller) and aide (Anthony Michael Hall).  John du Pont is arrested and eventually dies in prison.

This is a stark, boring film.  It doesn't even have a definitive soundtrack to provide interest.  It does show a couple interesting scenes of wrestlers going through their paces.  Certainly the acting is first rate.  In addition to Carell's physical transformation, we see a different side of Tatum who appears bulked up with a mouthful of cotton and a hulk-like walk.  He looks like he knows what he's doing when it comes to the wrestling scenes.  It just isn't enough to want to watch this movie again.",1421712000,4,2273,4.550617283950618
6874376,4,B00QK4ANEI,"Foxcatcher was a very quiet, methodical movie. There were times in the movie theater when I could hear dialogue and sound effects from the movie next door, because this movie was so quiet. Quiet and unassuming are two of the first words that come to mind when I try to think of how to describe this movie.

I'm assuming most people sitting down to watch Foxcatcher are familiar with the real events and have an idea of how the movie is going to end. For those who don't, this movie is based on the true story of multimillionaire John du Pont (Steve Carell) and his friendship with Dave (Mark Ruffalo) and Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), world champion and Olympic wrestlers. Du Pont befriended Mark when du Pont sponsored a private wrestling team set up on his estate, Foxcatcher Farms, that Mark trained at and his older brother Dave later coached at.

If you're familiar with the true events, you know how the story will end, but the movie took its time to get there. I thought it really developed the characters well and plodded along establishing itself before ultimately completing the tragic retelling of this story. The movie was sad at times and also a bit slow-moving. I thought it was a really interesting story and I enjoyed the movie, but if you're looking for non-stop action or drama, this movie doesn't have that. It does has incredible acting performances, in my option, from Channing Tatum and Steve Carell, and the always-great Ruffalo, and the movie sucked me in for the entire 2 hours. These are the best roles I've seen Carell or Tatum in to date.",1421625600,,1567,4.653429602888087
6874377,5,B00QK4ANEI,"[NOTE: I tried very hard not to give away spoilers in this review. If you want to see this movie, see it before you learn the actual story.]

1. Most people (including myself) thought the trailer to this film was kind of vague and hard to remember; you couldn't really tell what it was about. People would say, ""'Foxcatcher'? That's that weird movie about wrestling, right? And Steve Carell sure looks strange."" But now I understand why. It's almost impossible to summarize the movie.

2. The actual plot is easy to explain - two brothers, Dave and Mark Schultz, are Olympic gold medalists in wrestling. The younger one, Mark, is trying to get out of his brother's shadow and become his own person. Mark meets this really strange millionaire, John du Pont, who invites Mark to start a wrestling team on his ranch, and train for the next Olympics. Things don't go as planned.

3. The plot is not what the movie is actually about, though. This is a subtle movie where some key points are shown through long, non-verbal scenes, or through short, almost throw-away lines of dialogue. Some people think this movie is too long, quiet, and boring. This means they have not been paying attention, and missed all the important stuff.

4. The plot of the movie is basically a true story, but they changed quite a few things to make it fit, and to make the story more complex (there is a lot of controversy over some of the points in the film). The real Mark Schultz has a cameo, as a wrestling official weighing in the movie version of himself.

5. I have only one thing to say about Steve Carell. He deserves Best Actor of the Year. And Mark Ruffalo deserves his Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actor.

6. Now let me say something about Channing Tatum. The fact that he was not nominated for an Oscar is one of the most mysterious and outrageous snubs I've ever seen. Tatum gives a performance that rivals Carell's. He inhabits his character physically and emotionally. Together, Tatum and Carell turn what could have been a weird little melodrama into a genuine piece of American tragedy.

7. There is a constant thread of awkwardness and pain through the movie. It's perfectly matched with the muted, sorrowful colors of the film, the minimalist soundtrack, and the cinematography.

8. The movie also sets up a constant, vague sense of unease. You get a feeling in the pit of your stomach that something is going to go very wrong, but you don't know what or when.

9. This movie is a quiet, peaceful, psychological car crash, where morals clash with money, ""yes"" clashes with ""no"", family will both support and destroy you, and crushed dreams are painted onto other people. It's open to more than one interpretation, and I don't guarantee that you will like this movie. But I do guarantee that if you can stick with it, it will stick with you.",1421625600,8,2840,4.630218687872763
6874378,5,B00QK4ANEI,"I can't remember when a non-horror film has made me feel so uncomfortable and tense for it's whole length. It's a quiet film. Slow. Subtle. Almost dreamlike. Much of what happens occurs without dialogue. But there is always a heavy feeling of doom floating over it's sad characters.

And what a fascinating bunch of characters. Based on real people, I found myself wondering if a novelist could come up with a trio so laden with emotional and social meaning.

John DuPont (Steve Carrell) is the mega millionaire who is vaguely 'off', and clearly fighting mental demons. He dreams of being a wrestling coach and somehow coaching the U.S. to glory, so he essentially buys now down on his luck ex-champion Mark Shultz (Channing Tatum) to come and wrestle for him. The two men have a complicated and tricky relationship. There is admiration, father and son bonding, resentment and even seemingly unspoken sexual attraction. But neither man is able to communicate about almost any of it, or deal with any of the feelings themselves.

The third member of the triumvirate is Shultz's older brother Dave (Mark Rufflao). Less of a painful introvert than his brother, Dave has been Mark's coach and only friend. They have a complex filial relationship, captured beautifully by director Bennett Miller and writers Dan Futterman and E. Max Frye in the lengthy, almost wordless opening scene where Dave leads Mark through a training session. Just as messy, if healthier, than Mark's relationship with DuPont, we see in the scene the love, admiration, jealousy and rivalry that exists between these two quiet men.

Now Dave joins Mark at DuPont's vast compound to be 'assistant coach' to DuPont's 'coach', which is deeply bizarre as it quickly becomes clear that Dave knows 10 times as much about both wresting and leadership as DuPont ever will. As we watch a frustrated DuPont quietly head into an ever darker place the tension grows as thick as in a Polanski film, and even the film's conclusion provides little in the way of release. I headed back out into the night with a knot still in my stomach. It's the rare film that can pull me into that kind of claustrophobic space of madness and loss.

A word has to be given to the tremendous work done by all three actors, along with Vanessa Redgrave as DuPont's mother -- unforgettable in a role that only gives her a few minutes of screen time. While Carrell has gotten the lion's share of the kudos (and he is terrific, reinventing himself as a purely dramatic actor) both Tatum and Ruffalo also do world class work here, creating inarticulate men who express with their eyes and bodies what they don't quite know how to express with words.

This is not a 'fun' movie, but it is one that you can feel deeply, and end up pondering the nature of madness, success, the American dream, class, and family in a way too few recent films lead you to do.",1421366400,3,2884,4.746506986027944
6874379,5,B00QK4ANEI,"FOXCATCHER is an unsettling and disturbing film based on actual events orchestrated by John E. du Pont. John E. du Pont was an ornithologist, philatelist, sports enthusiast and coach and an heir to the Du Pont family fortune. His behavior, his dogged drive especially as Steve Carell portrays him is thoroughly unsettling. Foxcatcher Farm is the name of his sprawling wrestling facility he established in the rolling green hills of Pennsylvania. Steve Carell's character wants glory for himself through glory he wishes to gain through excellence in wrestling as a sponsor for USA Wrestling for his country. He is a contradiction to that end. He brings ex-wrestling champion and Olympic Gold Medal winner Mark Shultz played by Channing Tatum into the fold as his would be champion.

Mark Shultz's brother David Leslie Schultz also an Olympic Gold Medal winner and coach is brought aboard as assistant coach. David Schultz is played by Mark Ruffalo. Mark Ruffalo's performance is spot on. His performance is not characterized by high drama, but rather by stark realism. That realism strengthens all the unreality that Steve Carell's character has created both psychically and ideologically in the world he has created. To give to much of this story away may ruin it for the viewer. Director Bennett Miller has a way of using sound or lack of sound to create a mood, an atmosphere this foreboding and utterly unsettling.

What was John E. du Pont really thinking? What motivated this man? Thought provoking stuff. The Foxcatcher Farm, there is just something very wrong about it all. This film and how you envision the man goes beyond normal feelings of uneasiness and paranoia. There is just something very wrong with it all and that is how I felt watching it.",1421280000,33,1758,4.996587030716723

6874381,3,B00QK4ANEI,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

In order for 'Foxcatcher' to work, it has to believable. How many liberties did the screenwriters take in depicting the sad seduction of brothers Mark and David Schultz, both Gold Medal winters in the 1984 Olympics, into the clutches of the troubled and deranged heir to the Du Pont family fortune and wrestling coach wannabe, John Du Pont?

The main liberties taken it would seem, were with the character of Mark Schultz. The films' scenarists would like us to believe that Schultz was sort of a mindless jock who perhaps didn't have the insight to realize he was getting involved with such a duplicitous and dangerous individual. According to the film, it was both Mark's naivety and insatiable need to be #1, that led him to be manipulated by Du Pont; but this is in part disputed by Schultz himself in his book, written after the tragic murder of his brother.

Before discussing this issue of Mark Schultz's naivety, one must acknowledge that 'Foxcatcher' gets it right in depicting him as being quite 'down and out' prior to being contacted by Du Pont. Both brothers were working as assistant coaches at Stanford but it was Mark who was fired and Dave who was kept; according to Slate Magazine, ""someone who feigned interest in managing his career,"" swindled him out of most of his money. Mark was living in a rented apartment in his father's house when Du Pont called.

According to Mark, unlike the way he was depicted in the film, he was deeply suspicious of Du Pont from the get-go. His main concern was that Du Pont had little wrestling knowledge and he ""cautiously"" arranged to meet Du Pont while he was training for the Worlds in Indiana. He saw Du Pont as a loser and didn't like the fact that his teeth were ""dark yellow and caked with food."" When Du Pont told him that he would be referred to as ""Coach,"" only in the media guide and that he would only pop in once in a while to check on how things were going, he didn't agree to talk right away but only after the trials were over.

Slate Magazine also points out that Mark didn't stay at Du Pont's estate when he first got there and actually looked at him as a ""loser""--someone who he had disdain and also pity for. So Mark's lack of skepticism early on in regards to Du Pont as depicted in the film, is not borne out by the facts. Nor was it particularly believable that none of the characters in the film (such as the other wrestlers who were training at the Foxcatcher facility) seemed to discuss what a creepy guy Du Pont was and that he might have some kind of mental illness. Indeed, while Du Pont was found competent to stand trial, he was ultimately convicted of Third Degree Murder but mentally ill.

Despite the lack of verisimilitude in regards to Mark's early encounters with Du Pont, the best part of the film chronicles Du Pont's bizarre behavior and underlying psychopathology. Donning a prosthetic nose, Steve Carrell, a comic by trade, transforms himself into a very creepy psychopath. Carrell watched a good deal of video footage to imitate Du Pont's mannerisms and those who had encounters with the real Du Pont indicate that Carrell successfully captures the essence of the demented heir.

Du Pont's obsession with guns is ably highlighted (and it was certainly true he often had the local police over for shooting practice), along with his passion for ornithology and philately. While wrapping himself in the mantle of ethical living and unbridled patriotism, Du Pont hypocritically used cocaine and insisted Mark Schultz try it too. The filmmakers argue that Du Pont's 'dementia' was rooted in his resentment toward his mother. Mark Schultz doesn't mention this in his book but the filmmakers speculate that Du Pont hated his mother's love for horses and that the mother looked at her son's obsession with wrestling as a ""low"" preoccupation. Du Pont's pettiness is correctly depicted by the film's scenarists when he rigs wrestling matches for seniors, and has his opponents intentionally throw the matches, so he can be declared the victor.

Recently Mark Schultz withdrew his support for the film's director over accusations that there was a homo-erotic component to his relationship with Du Pont. While not explicitly stated, one particular scene where Mark and Du Pont wrestle together in a suggestive way, might lead one to conclude that there was something going on between the two. But Schultz makes it clear in his book that he made it quite clear to Du Pont that he wasn't gay and had no desire to engage in any sexual encounters with him.

According to Slate Magazine, Mark's relationship with Du Pont fell apart after his brother Dave took over as coach. ""In reality, Dave never worked at Foxcatcher while Mark was there, and Mark was fired shortly after an angry confrontation with John over not much..."" 'Foxcatcher' doesn't make it clear at all, but once Dave was hired as coach, he lived there with his family for 7 years.

As to the motive as to why Du Pont shot Dave Schultz, 'Foxcatcher' fails to go into Du Pont's interest in one Valentin Jordanov, a Bulgarian wrestler, who he ultimately gave 80% of his fortune to in his will. The day he shot Dave Schultz was Jordanov's birthday and perhaps he was trying to prove to Jordanov that Dave was no longer a rival and was out of their way.

Why did the Schultz brothers fall victim to Du Pont's seduction? Perhaps it was a puerile obsession with winning. Ultimately, just as big honchos of American wrestling were paid off by Du Pont, so the Schultz brothers also found themselves tempted by his greenbacks. Despite its flaws, the tale of the 'crazy as a loon' benefactor, proves oddly fascinating.",1420675200,6,5694,4.71830985915493
6874382,5,B00QK4ANEI,"This is a really disturbing movie, mainly because Steve Carell's acting makes it so.
He embodies John du Pont, a weird man to say the least, and his presence
throughout the movie is almost unnatural (and I am not talking about the big nose).
Like all ""based on a true story,"" it is a movie that tries to revive a piece of USA
history, where a troubled billionaire with mother issues, decides to ""coach"" a team
with wrestlers, that includes the Schultz brothers, on the pretext that they must stand
up to the Soviets.

It is a slow movie, with great photography, great scenery, and awesome 80s sports clothes
(what we now call originals).  There are some scenes that are unexpected, making this movie
really good. It is a movie about the relation among men, a billionaire and
a lone wrestler, among 2 brothers, the jealousy that  close relation might bring.

Tatum is at his best, but I guess that was not enough to earn him some nomination like
Carell and Ruffalo got, although I still do not know why the latter one got it.

Still, you have to be in some kind of mood to appreciate this movie. You cannot watch it
at any time and with anyone.",1420675200,7,1143,4.44976076555024
6874383,4,B00QK4ANEI,"I think this might be a year where the performances are better than the movies they're in. Foxcatcher is a great example of this. I really can't say that watching Foxcatcher is an enjoyable experience. Disturbing is more like it. And kind of fascinating, but that's all about the actors.

I went into this one with no idea of what it was about. I mean, I had no clue at all other than my wife saying she thought it had something to do with boxing, which turned out to be wrong and only matters in that it explains that I had no expectations whatsoever. Even having no expectations, what I got was completely unexpected.

The movie was kind of like watching a scorpion or a large spider crawling over your kids, and you can't do anything about it. It gives you the shivers and makes your skin crawl watching that... thing... creeping over your kids, and you just keep hoping it keeps going and doesn't stop to bite or sting. Watching spiders and scorpions and how they move can be pretty fascinating. It's just not enjoyable when they're on you or someone you care for.

That said, the performances are amazing. I mean, seriously, they are fantastic.

You can barely recognize Carell, and it's not because of the nose and makeup. His whole bearing is changed. The way he holds his head, the way he talks, his mannerisms. There's nothing Carell-ish about him, none of that frenetic energy he so often has. And he's creepy. He's a creepy, rich, old white dude, and he acts like it. I might not have known it was him if I hadn't known it was him. That Steve Carell was in it was about the only thing I knew about the movie going into it.

Speaking of bearing, Tatum and Ruffalo were incredible. I don't know if I can even describe what they did. So they were playing Mark and David Shultz, wrestlers who both won gold at the 84 Olympics, and they had this way of moving their bodies around that more closely resembled chimpanzees than humans. It wouldn't have even surprised me if they had put their knuckles to the floor and moved with their arms instead of their legs. And it's not just about the way they walked; it's everything. Tatum even had this jutting lower jaw, and it wasn't some fancy prosthetic thing. If he was doing that himself, it must have taken incredible concentration to keep that up through filming. The overall effect, especially with Tatum, was that of cavemen. Or, at least, how we imagine cavemen.

And Ruffalo? Well, I wasn't even sure it was him some of the time during the movie. I mean, I thought it was Ruffalo, but, every once in a while, I was doubtful. I thought it was just someone that bore a striking resemblance to him. With the beard and the odd way he moved around, I was never quite sure, not until the credits rolled. That's just impressive.

To top it all off, at least as far as I can tell by doing a cursory investigation of what actually happened, the movie got it pretty spot on. The only issue I could even raise is that there is a lack of clarity about the time frame on some of the events, but that doesn't have any actual bearing on the movie or the plot; I was just surprised to find out how far apart some of the events actually were. That's a very small thing for a movie like this.

I think this is definitely a movie worth seeing as long as you're not looking for something that's going to give you that feelgood buzz when it's over. If you want to see some stellar performances, though, this is really a must see movie.",1420588800,99,3472,4.388802488335926
6874384,3,B00QK4ANEI,"Despite the extraordinary, riveting performance by Steve Carrell, this film rarely rises above TV-movie standards.  The rest of the cast is fairly dull and the direction is serviceable, at best.  (And why has so much praise has been heaped on Channing Tatum?).  Oddly, the film jumps over seven years without comment, and while this film is ""based on"" actual events, and is not an historical documentary, there is no reason for this lapse.  The wrestling sequences are well done, and the setting is perfect, but overall I would rate this film as only slightly above average.",1420416000,3,574,4.947916666666667
6874385,4,B00QK4ANEI,"This movie has been a movie of my curiosity for quite sometime now. And after a wider release in theaters, I have finally gotten the opportunity to see the movie Foxcatcher.

Mark Schultz who is a wrestler, receives a prestigious offer by a wealthy man by the name of John Du Pont to become a part of his wrestling team at John's facility Foxcatcher Farm. After Mark's brother Dave initially declines the offer to join the team, Mark soon learns that everything has price.

Mark Ruffalo, Channing Tatum, and especially Steve Carrell do so much good for this movie. Steve Carrell is absolutely stellar here as John Du Pont. Carrell is known primarily for his comedic antics, but he hands the movie its most intriguing/compelling performance. And if Channing Tatum has been criticized in the past for his acting abilities, he proves here that he IS just the man for the role of Mark Schultz. I admire the level of range Tatum utilizes in the character. Mark Schultz is a character you root for, and I myself felt a sense of empathy towards his character. Mark Ruffalo does a nice job playing Dave Schultz. It is interesting to see Dave be the coach and sort of father like figure in the movie to Mark. Though Sienna Miller was not given a lot to say in the movie, I like her performance as Dave's wife Nancy.

Upon hearing that this was in fact a true story, I did numerous bits of research and most notably the real Mark Schultz himself has recently criticized the film's accuracy; while praising Channing Tatum's performance. In my opinion, there were a few times were the movie felt like it did too much in a certain scene; which would be one area where I feel Foxcatcher does only just enough to be good. But even still, those issues did not stop me from enjoying the movie. Foxcatcher's acting is the strongest suit for the movie, and the set designs/filming locations are well suited for Foxcatcher. Foxcatcher may not have exceeded my expectations, but Foxcatcher is

Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) and his brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo) are gold medal Olympic wrestlers humbly training for the next event. Mark is clearly the less articulate of the two. John du Pont (Steve Carell with a Cyrano nose) wants to train Olympic wrestlers. Not just give them a place to train, but be their mentor, coach, and daddy. Mark agrees, but not Dave. We discover that John is a complex character as the film becomes a character study. John hates his mother's horses. ""Horses are stupid."" Mom du Pont (Vanessa Redgrave) loves horses and believes wrestling is ""low sport.""

Mark becomes disillusioned about the same time Dave buys into the dream as team USA likes du Ponts' money.

While the film may indeed be well acted, it is far from must see entertainment. The conversations between Mark and John are dry and boring. It could have been called dumb and dumber without the humor. We do see similarities in the two as creepy John lives in the shadow of his mother and meat head Mark lives in the shadow of his brother, clearly the smarter of the two wrestlers. It is a good drama, but not an action film.

8691762,4,B00QK4ANEI,"This is a great movie for the most part but the portrayal of Mark Schultz after he gets slapped and berated by John du Pont makes him look like a bit of a five year old. He says/does nothing back, but rather just sulks and walks around with a boo boo face the rest of the time. His relationship with du Pont after this point takes a bizarre turn in that it becomes as though their relationship prior to this particular scene never took place and they become like strangers to one another.",1530835200,,488,4.258064516129032

8691766,5,B00QK4ANEI,"The GREAT, Bennett Miller's gift to cinema and cinephiles-'Like swimming in a fragrant ocean,'as Joe Strummer would say. PRETTY pictures, as ONLY Millet can paint, make up every frame. He and STEVE CARELL are SO talented and their BRILLIANCE just whets the appetite for WHATEVER they each see fit to do next. TATUM never seizes to amaze-Truly; a REAL movie star. BONUS treat was the great ANTHONY MICHAEL HALL-He was SUPERB.",1528761600,,424,4.985915492957746
