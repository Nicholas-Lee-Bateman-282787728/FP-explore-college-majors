8586443,5,B004958K6I,"Thought provoking and engaging documentary not only on the plight of Palden Gyatso,
but on the greater issue of Tibet's struggle to reclaim their own nation.  As Palden
passionately recounts the torture he endured, it will undoubtedly incite a mixture of
anger, frustration and sadness in the viewer. This is an important film to see if you
are interested in learning more about Tibet.",1288137600,6,385,5.015625
