616986,3,6303257194,"BOB AND CAROL AND TED AND ALICE starts off as if a stoned hippie with an 8mm cam began to film cinema verite and did not wish to infringe on the rights of an equally stoned cast to get the scene right in the first take.  Somewhere in this turgid bloated mess of a psychodrama are some unpleasant truths about the way married couples confront personal and sexual disconnections, but this relevant set of subtexts is hidden under an annoying coating of a 60s mentality of free love, beads, primal scream therapy, and groupsex, all of which date what otherwise have been some eternal truisms.
Robert Culp is Bob, a 40 something successful businessman who is less a fully-fleshed individual than a stereotyped hippie weekend wannabe who wants the freedom to have affairs but is unwilling to give his wife Carol (Natalie Wood) the same right.  Bob is not just a man in search of himself.  He comes across as an annoying pest who likes to think of himself as a new age guru who believes that he personifies the adage of Do Your Own Thing.  Naturally, anyone who dares to show conventional middle class moral objections to his philandering is dismissed as a fuddy duddy out of touch with his own feelings.  Carol is even less of a believable person as she skates through life with her feet barely touching the moral ground of life.  Director Paul Mazursky allows the viewer to get an idea of how and why Bob and Carol think and act.  At the start of the film, they attend a group interaction session led by a therapist who exhorts his patients to engage in some questionable methods: they scream, beat pillows, gawk about the room, and stare into one another's eyes as if to connect on a visual level.
Ted (Eliot Gould) and Alice (Dyan Cannon) are more open with their vulnerabilities, and hence engage us more.  Both are disgusted at first with the open fooling around of Bob and Carol.  Ted wants more frequent sex with Alice but does not know how to handle her rejection of him. Despite his geekiness, Ted comes across as a reasonably moral man whose own limits are soon to be tested first by a wife whose burgeoning sexuality snaps to attention then later by his own crumbling wall of marital fidelity.
The second half of the film is more interesting than that of the first.  The cloying irritability that dominates the first half is replaced by several humorous, yet revealing vignettes that culminate with all four in bed and not knowing or daring what to do.  The hesitant expressions on their faces suggest that morality is not a blanket to be donned or doffed at will.  BOB AND CAROL AND TED AND ALICE is a potent, if misguided moral fairy tale that warns us that the freedom to be superficially open may in fact be nothing more than a license to hide behind that blanket of openness.",1070150400,16,2786,4.561122244488978
616987,4,6303257194,"Certainly a movie that has publicized the sexual revolution of the sixties and seventies.  Very interesting how Bob and Carol's carefree attitude about sex eventually loosens up Ted and Alice's more conservative ways.
Its interesting how Bob and Carol test their relationship with their affairs.  Amusing how Carol is quicker to be more accepting of their individual affairs than Bob. Ted and Alice at first are appalled by each of their infidelities.  However when they hear the reasons behind their actions, they lighten up their approaches.  Bob and Carol truly love each other where their affairs are merely for recreational purposes.
Those who are intrigued by psychology or the free love generation of the late sixties will be specially interested in this video.",1049673600,20,768,5.219512195121951
616988,4,6303257194,"""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice"" is an insightful film about the sexual revolution.
It deals with two couples -- one older and into ""experimentation"" (Bob & Carol), and the other younger and more square (Ted & Alice).
In a sense, the sexual experimentation of Bob and Carol epitomized the 60's ethos of (perhaps pathological) self-reflection and the idea that ""if it feels good, do it.""  (We're still feeling the reverberations of that.)
But the ending of this enjoyably funny movie also indicates that most people can only go so far.  Whether its cultural conditioning or innate, there are certain lines that most people simply cannot cross....
The movie does not pass judgment, but ultimately, there is a message there.
All the actors are good, but Elliot Gould and Dyan Cannon especially so.  (They were both nominated for supporting Oscars.)  Dyan Cannon is wonderful -- she's the best thing about the movie.",1041465600,7,907,4.908496732026144
616989,2,6303257194,"""Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice"" is widely applauded as a breakthrough film, but lets cut through the hype. First what Leonard Maltin calls ""ultrasophisticated"" is more an exposure of his own dimwittedness than a film commentary. 2 couples seek enlightenment and think they found the key: just have an affair and tell your partner about it...is that really the extent to which enlightenment was explored in the '60s?  Such is the main flaw; 2 couples are sincere about transcending middle class limitation, but group encounter sessions do not ""insight"" make.

 Robert Culp and Natalie Wood play the couple who think affair+honesty=enlightenment. As Horst observes, Culp is one hellofaguy. I wish Natalie Wood's husband would let me have her...I'd think he was a nice guy too.  What would have made this film good is if at the end they decided to go to India and seek true enlightenment.

 On the bright side we have '60s fashions and good Bacharach music...and the beautiful Natalie Wood.  The final scene ""Love Sweet Love"" is an interesting ending to an otherwise disappointing film.",1011398400,4,1085,4.9944444444444445

617235,4,6303257194,"BOB AND CAROL AND TED AND ALICE satirizes the human potential movement of the 1960's.  The title characters discover there is a good deal more to honoring their feelings than simply blurting out whatever moves them at the moment and acting on every impulse.

Bob (Robert Culp), a documentary filmmaker, joins a marathon encounter group at ""the institute"" (modeled on the famed Esalen Institute in Big Sur) to prepare for a film he wants to make on the place.  Carol (Natalie Wood), his wife, tags along.  The workshop ""guide"" urges participants to get in touch with their true feelings and to communicate them honestly.  Bob, and in particular Carol, take the message to heart.

Back in LA, they challenge their reserved best friends, married couple Alice (Dyan Cannon) and Ted (Elliott Gould) to join them in embracing their newly discovered emotional liberation where, as Carol keeps insisting, the truth, whatever it is, is ""beautiful.""

Bob and Carol are soon adrift in the Sexual Revolution, espousing an ""anything goes"" marital ethic as long as they are honest with each other about their desires.  When Carol happily tells their friends of Bob's affair, the news so disturbs Alice that she visits a psychotherapist to deal with her conflicted feelings about her closest friends' newfound freedom--as well as her deep-seated mistrust of Ted's fidelity.

Through therapy, Alice also learns to ""loosen up"" and openly express her feelings.  During the climactic (pun intended) trip to Las Vegas, in reaction to Ted's confession that he, too, has now had an affair, Alice instigates an attempt for the four of them to have an ""orgy""--swapping mates as they make love together in the same bed (which leads to the best line in the film.  Ted:  ""First we'll have an orgy and then we'll go see Tony Bennett."").

But once in bed, they stop kidding themselves.  It doesn't fly.

In the final scene, which is elegantly conveyed with no dialogue, the four emerge from their ironic encounter wiser, more self-aware, and perhaps more in touch with their real selves and their true feelings for each other. The message of ""the Institute"" has finally come through.

The Esalen Institute, which pioneered the human potential movement in the 60's and directly inspired this film, still holds a multitude of workshops each year, many of which are aimed at increasing emotional awareness and building healthy relationships.  I have been to several, and the work has transformed my life in wonderful ways.  What this film--perhaps unintentionally--illustrates is that merely knowing your feelings and spouting them (what we might call being ""unfiltered"" today) isn't enough to create solid self-esteem or positive relationships.

Esalen's workshops, and those in love, intimacy and sexuality that have been put on for decades by similarly-minded organizations such as the Human Awareness Institute, impart skills for constructive communication, loving yourself, honoring and expressing personal choices, active listening, setting boundaries, affirming personal values, asking for what you want, respecting what others want, and seeking the win-win in every situation.  These are skills one learns (or sadly, doesn't) over a lifetime.

B & C & T & A, if viewed as a cautionary tale, makes clear the dangers of attending one eye-opening workshop and naively running with it.  Responsible workshops, in the end, are dedicated to helping participants become heart-centered, rather than head or genital-centered.  Perhaps this emphasis is what the filmmakers were alluding to at the end of the film by choosing Jackie DeShannon's rendition of  ""What the World Need Now Is Love"" for the soundtrack in the wordless last scene.

The ensemble acting in the film is fascinating.  Bob and Carol, the New Age extremists, are balanced by Ted and Alice, the more conventional, down-to-earth characters that the ""average viewer"" will most easily identify with.  Alice drives the plot.  Her character undergoes the most transition, and Cannon steals the picture.  She is magnetic from her first shot, and should have won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar.  (Instead, Goldie Hawn won that year, for being her LAUGH-IN character from TV in a movie).

Elliott Gould, the acting surprise among the cast, brings a sweet, touching pathos to Ted.  He makes us feel for this guy, who as written is the most underdeveloped of the quartet.

Culp and Wood, while likeable and pretty, aren't especially interesting.  Wood, the screen veteran, slyly does get most of the laughs.

It's intriguing to note that each of the leads was married to another renowned actor.  Cannon's celebrated marriage to Cary Grant was over, but Gould was still married to Barbra Streisand at the filming.  These lesser-known actors, who give the picture dramatic punch playing the most easily swayed characters, were both wedded off-screen to Hollywood powerhouses.  Did their experiences in high-profile marriages give them special affinity for these roles?

On the other hand, the picture's two most recognized stars, Wood and Culp, in less satisfying parts, had spouses who were not as big celebrities as they were.  Wood's first marriage to Robert Wagner was over (they remarried later) but the easygoing charm of Robert Culp seems interchangeable with the easygoing charm of Robert Wagner.  Culp was married to France Nuyen, an exotic beauty who was in the same dark, petite mode as Wood.  Thus Wood and Culp seem far more relaxed, as if the set reflected their domestic scene, and the result was their tepid, if certainly adequate, performances.

Play with the idea of what B & C & T & A would have looked like if the spouses had stepped into the leads, Streisand as Carol, Grant as Bob, Wagner as Ted, Nuyen as Alice.  What sort of picture would it have been then?  My guess is the dramatic weight would have shifted to Bob and Carol.  Viewed from this angle, the movie can be interpreted as a meditation on the nature of Hollywood marriages.  BOB AND CAROL AND TED AND ALICE.  As the ads for the film teasingly proclaimed, ""Consider the possibilities.""",1410566400,,6095,5.1029263370333

The complaint that this can't happen now in an era of aids or stds is absurd. The divorce rate in America is 50% or higher, & the main reason is adultery.

617452,5,6303257194,"A few weeks ago I settled in to watch `Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice' and I have to say that I expected something far less profound and meaningful than what I was actually presented with.  I don't know why I was under the false impression that this was a comedy, and while some may try and pass this off as a black comedy it really isn't.  The dramatic and rather prolific gut punch of the film's finale (masked over by a somewhat hopeful `walk of the couples') is too much to be passed off as a comedy.

This film is too real.

`Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice' tells the story of two very different couples that come together in bizarre and unexpected ways when the Sanders' return home from a therapy retreat with some odd ideas about love and `sharing'.  Bob and Carol are liberal and have no problems exposing their feelings, or at least a superficial version of their feelings.  Their friends, Ted and Alice Henderson are uncomfortable with their friend's newfound openness.  Things come to a head when Bob has an affair and is bowled over by Carol's reaction.  She embraces it.  She not only forgives him on the spot but pries at him for details and encourages him to keep it up.  An open marriage is a happy marriage, apparently, and she seems to thrive on the idea of her husband's happiness.  The Henderson's, especially Alice, are not as understanding.  When Alice hears of Bob's betrayal she is seething.  She is dripping with loathing and is completely aghast at Alice's acceptance of Bob's indiscretions, so much so that she feels uncomfortable in her presence.

Here is where the cracks in their relationships and personas start to rear their heads.  I mentioned earlier that Bob and Carol had no problem sharing these superficial perceptions of their true feelings; the masked idea of their ideals they wanted to project for those around them to ascertain and `believe' was their newfound clarity.  The thing is, Bob and Carol are just as confused as everyone else by their new stance on life and love and this is made VERY clear by the way they answer questions and meet viewer judgment.  Just the way that Carol feels obligated to share with Alice and Ted that Bob has had an affair was a way of gaining attention for her relaxed perception of life, which she so eagerly wants those around her to accept, as if she is still uncertain that their eye opening experience in that retreat was as life affirming or life altering as she thought it was.  When Ted confronts Bob with his affair and asks him if he would be as forgiving or as understanding if Carol had had an affair, he answers without hesitation.  This isn't something he's even thinking about.  This is his new outlook on life and it is coming so easily to him.

Until it isn't easy anymore.

No, the kinks in this new outlook are exposed the second Bob comes home early from a business trip and finds his wife having an affair of her own.  His emotional collapse, his instant state of panic and anger and betrayal come crashing in on him to the point where he can't even muster the strength to pretend that he's ok with it all, until he has to.  Until he's forced to admit that fair is fair and that his new outlook on life is what is important.  You can see, right then and there, that they haven't thought this thing through, and yet they are too deep to turn back just yet.

This is where the Henderson's own experiences come into play.  I relate to these two personally, because I've been in their shoes.  When you are attached to a certain couple you start to become steeped in their lives and their foolish decisions begin to weigh heavily on you, to the point where they become your stupid decisions.  The Henderson's are not entirely prudish (at least Ted isn't), but they are nowhere near as comfortable with themselves as the Sanders are.  What is particularly unsettling about this couple, and what I reacted to the strongest, was the way that they allowed their personal feelings about the wayward direction of their friend's lives to affect their own marriage and their reactions to one another.  This is especially notable in Alice, who not only happens to be my favorite character in the film but also contains my favorite performance (Dyan Cannon is marvelous here).  I don't know what this says about my marriage, because I see so much of my wife in Alice, but maybe it says something about my feelings for her if I admit that Alice is my favorite character.  Sure, she can appear to be shrill and unsympathetic and controlling and selfish, but at the center of it I see a virtue there; an almost all knowing understanding, deeper than that of her husband and friends.

But of course, folly comes to those that bait it, and the Henderson's, especially Ted, fall into a desensitized moral state.  Allowing Bob's staunch stance on his newfound views persuade him, Ted begins to fancy the idea of meaningless affairs.  What makes this all the more impactful is the fact that Bob himself is basically convincing his unsuspecting friend of something that he himself isn't entirely convinced of but is merely parading around as a mask to hide his own confusion.  He's a poser, but a dangerous one because he doesn't have the common sense to keep his idea of ideals to himself so as not to pollute or even destroy the lives of those he holds close to him.

He doesn't know what he's doing.

All of this culminates into something rather abrupt yet expected as the couple vacation together and wind up contemplating the unthinkable (or should I say inevitable); swinging.  I'd say `wife swapping', but when you factor in that it is really Alice who, at her breaking point, becomes the advocate for the `swap' it really takes on a different connotation.  In fact, her mental collapse and subsequent disillusioned suggestion really breaks down all of the film's walls and paints a fuller, more heart wrenching story.

Paul Mazursky directs this tale with the needed restraint, allowing the passion for the subject to seep through into the many layers (crevices) of the film and not become a burden or an abrasive distraction.  This is aided by the brilliant performances by the cast, most notable the two women.  I want to start by addressing the disgraceful category fraud on the part of The Academy who placed both Elliott Gould and Dyan Cannon in the supporting categories, when there are four LEADS in this film.  I can't understand how anyone could classify them as supporting.  Alas, that is an entirely different discussion.

Dyan Cannon delivers one of the most emotionally layered and dynamic (not to mention brutally honest) performances I've seen in film, ever.  The way that she filters her character's moral superiority, clustered confusion, intimacy issues (both sexual and emotional) and obvious naivety send shivers down my spine.  Natalie Wood is also a standout, taking on a completely different character and approaching it from a fresh perspective.  She's flirtatious, but never in the obvious ways but always shaded with a personal reluctance to divulge everything she's feeling.  She wears her mask off-kilter, which only strengthens her performance.

`Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice' is not an easy film.  That isn't to say that it is devastating, because Marzursky shades the film in a way that lightens the tones and allows us to digest it without feeling completely crushed, but the aftermath left as the credits roll surely takes its toll, especially if you've ever found yourself in a situation of similarity.  This is a surprisingly astute and honest look at the way that friendships and sex can collide and the way that relationships can alter, shift and eventually break under the misguided need to `adapt'.",1379980800,3,7708,4.699925539836188

They love swinging, love and think having affairs and polygamy are good and healthy lifestyles when in reality it is the extreme opposite. Swinging and sleeping around is how you get STDs, have broken marraiges, and broken families, and most of all how you wreck your own life. I do not find swinging and polygamy ""sweet love"" or having affairs and cheating on your husband or wife ""sweet love"". Those couples at the end are all mentally insane thinking that they've got is sweet love when it is the complete and total opposite.  The song at the end is too beautiful for this ugly story. What's goin on in this movie is the total opposite of what Jackie Deshannon is singing about. I do not think that this is one of Natalie's best roles, in fact its one of her worst and utmost distasteful. I love Natalie Wood, but she could do way better than this.

617490,5,6303257194,"An interesting 1969 time capsule of clothing, hairstyles and attitudes in the acid generation which had a big influence on the next decade. Beyond its historical value it's entertaining into the bargain.  Wow, with gurus, easy riders and communes a phenomenon, this movie makes a lot of sense for the year it was made. It explores attitudes (and methods) that seem half silly, and yet half daring - a quest for utopian happiness, intimacy and freedom (sexual and otherwise) via ""the honesty of the moment"". I've respected the degree to which segments of the 60s generation re-examined things so deeply and tried to do it a new way - which on one hand reduced to hedonism and perhaps a lack of common sense as shown in this movie - on the other though were these moments of enlightenment - freedom of expression that occasionally resulted in genius. Not that you'll find ALL of that here in this movie, though the characters seem to learn a little something by the end.

B C T & A is a pretty fun ride that'll have you half curious and half shaking your head. The film's scenarios take you through some unnerving exploration of ""the moment"" between people in social and sexual situations.  It's an interesting examination of the concepet of sexual fidelity in general. It's daring - it's also quite funny.  For more late sixties fare, though not exactly in the same budget sphere or topic, I liked Peter Fonda and Jack Nicholson in ""The Trip"".",1286409600,3,1442,4.687747035573122
617491,4,6303257194,"Handel's Messiah swells and rises as a green Jaguar drives up a winding road into the mountains. It's headed for a retreat, a getaway for Bob & Carol (Robert Culp and Natalie Wood), a 30ish, well-to-do couple for L.A.; as they approach their destination, the traditional score acquires a rocking background beat, symbolizes the changes in store for the couple, their friends Ted and Alice (Elliott Gould and Dyan Cannon), American film, and I suppose America itself as the sexual revolution combined with a spiritual awakening - or perhaps unrest/disquiet might be a better phrase. Bob is a documentary filmmaker as it turns out, and he just wants to observe and film the goings-on - encounter sessions and group therapy, mostly - but quickly he and Carol get intimately involved, and back in L.A., they feel the need to share their new insights with their more conservative friends.

Ted and Alice mostly humor their slightly hipper friends, until Bob confesses to having an affair on a recent business trip - and Carol accepts it, soon wondering herself if she might like to play around. Alice simply can't deal with what she sees as Bob's betrayal, and perhaps more importantly Carol's betrayal of the quartet's shared moral outlook, and this precipitates a period of unease between the four. Alice eventually seems to become more accepting of this newfound openness and freedom from the traditional structures - for others - but her attitudes will be put on trial when the two couples decide to spend a weekend in Las Vegas.

This is one of those films that you are inevitably going to find attached to the dreaded ""d"" word - dated. Well, how could it not be in a sense? It's very deliberately about a time (1969) and place (southern California) , and about how the sexual revolution and the search for meaning and a new spirituality in a troubled time affects a group of four young, wealthy, attractive (well, at least the women) friends who consider themselves ""hip"" and ""with it"", but show, in varying degrees, the old conservative 50s morals of a previous generation, however much they try to fight it. Peer beneath the surface a little bit, though, and I think you'll find that there's a lot more than the now old-fashioned dialogue, clothing, and moral questions going on here. It's interesting that Mazursky and cowriter Larry Tucker chose to center the story around a quartet in their 30s, for example - it's quite explicit in the film that these are people who still ""feel"" very young, but have started to act like their parents, have started to become more conservative and less adventurous. And though there's plenty of sex talk, there's no nudity and the ending ""orgy"" sequence is very oddly and subtly put together - I got the feeling throughout that it is the fantasy element, the what-might-be, that is really what's important in the dynamics here, rather than any real ""cheating"" or getting away with anything. The film is, I think, more about the possibilities, and about communication, than it is about any actual changing of sexual morality. It doesn't come down for change as such, but for talk, and for thought.

It's a fairly witty and sophisticated comedy, certainly by the standards of American ""sex comedies"" (in some ways this is more like a French comedy of the time, from Rohmer or Truffaut) and though the dialogue and some of the situations do scream out 1960s, the overall themes of love and neediness and trust are certainly universal. Remarkably enough, the film was a huge box-office success, earning the equivalent of over $80 million in 2010 dollars, enough to place it in the top 10 for the year. It's hard to imagine a talky comedy on adult themes doing anywhere near so well these days, particularly one without huge stars (though Wood in particular was certainly well known). Solid performances all around, especially I think from Natalie Wood, who gets inside the idea of a woman who is really grappling with a changing vision of herself and her world, and who I have to say is about gorgeous here as any woman in any movie ever.

The DVD looks great; I think that Mazursky's talk in front of college students is more valuable and instructive than the joky and self-conscious commentary track provided by him and the surviving actors.",1285804800,3,4279,4.825613079019074

I don't know, nor does the film have any answers.  The film is certainly adult themed and not for children.

The commentary track, done in 03, is quite revealing and made me appreciate the movie more because the first time through I wasn't that amused. It's fun to watch Natalie Wood here at age 30 and Dyan Cannon at 32 as the women, befuddled by the sexual revolution then in full swing. Culp was 39 and hot off the tv series ""I Spy"" while Elliott Gould was relatively unknown. He sounds a bit like Jerry Lewis at times here.

Taken as a period piece when the sexual revolution was completely redefining the country's moral code, the film is a shrewdly observed, sharply comic character study among the Southern California bourgeoisie. It also marks the auspicious directorial debut of Paul Mazursky, a former actor who ended up making two decades' worth of insightful films focused on personal foibles and sympathetic satire (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-Unmarried-Woman/dp/B000BOH918/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An Unmarried Woman</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Down-and-Out-in-Beverly-Hills/dp/B000065V3I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Down and Out in Beverly Hills</a>).

The experience transforms Bob and Carol into a touchy-feely couple so intent on being completely honest with each other that they accept each other's acts of adultery. This level of supposed enlightenment initially appalls their best friends, Ted and Alice Henderson, who hold on tenuously to their more traditional values. However, a weekend in Vegas becomes a cathartic showdown among the two couples, and the outrageous brashness of their liberated behavior comes to a crescendo that manages to be unexpected and predictable at the same time. Mazursky ends things on a surreal note with Jackie DeShannon's classic rendition of Burt Bacharach and Hal David's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-the-World-Needs-Now-Is-Love/dp/B000002TRY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What the World Needs Now Is Love</a>.

As Carol, Natalie Wood at thirty never looked so sexy nor came across so relaxed onscreen. She brings such an alluring knowingness to the role that it becomes difficult to believe why Bob would want to cheat on her in the first place. In his first major role, Elliott Gould makes Ted an amusing, sympathetic figure who keeps dancing between disgust and envy with increasing alacrity. Dyan Cannon comes closest to stealing the picture since she carries the biggest character arc as Alice. The scene with her psychiatrist is extremely well played. It is her character who does the abrupt about-face that spurs the climax (...you should pardon the expression).

After an hour of emotional and conversational back and forth, they all jump into bed together. We don't see any sex (what a tease).

I, for one, don't think that what the world needs now is love, sweet love. I think what it needs is some common sense - something that this film is desperately lacking. Every one of the premises of the film now seems absurd. Being frank is mean. Venting your emotions rather than mastering them is childish and weak.

What is so hilarious is how straight all the roles are played.  I couldn't stop laughing when Elliot Gould, still green about matters touchy/feely painfully tries to extricate himself from beneath Robert Culp and Natalie Wood as they, during a dinner get together with friends, begin making love on the couch on top of him!

Only someone with the cash to afford all the retreats, books, lectures, therapists, and most importantly, the TIME to indulge to their heart's content the nit picking of micro-managed conversation with grandiose assumptions of their and everyone else's motives before smothering it all beneath a sanitized shroud of complete moral neutrality.

About 40 minutes in the movies various themes all coalesque around this ONE area: extramarital relations - and this is where Mazursky takes the film completely over the top.

Culp, in his quest for complete OPENNESS confesses an affair he had the previous weekend to wife Natalie Wood.  With a headful of mountain top retreat indoctrination she loves him all the more for it.  She feels compelled with her own quest for absolute transparency to share this news with the couple's friends Ted and Alice (Gould and Cannon).  Cannon is driven berserk and Bob's infidelity which taps into her own issues leading to a exasperating all night rap session with hubby Ted.

When Ted ruminates over his own lack of extramarital affairs he's not sure if he has a CLEAN slate or an empty one!!

7842659,5,6303257194,"Wow! If you're feeling nostalgic for the sixties /seventies and the vibe from back in those days, this is the movie for you. The basic premise of the movie is filmed around the time America was just on the edge of the women's lib movement  and it  is about the sexual Revolution and rebelling against the mores and norms that were so prevalent in the sexually repressed nineteen-fifties. It focuses on two couples' lives, marriages and the concept of free love during a confusing and evolving period in America's history where people faced a societal upheaval of conventional Behavior. A very provocative movie that looks at  and challenges the concept of love in conventional monogamous marital relationships verses open marriages.... and makes an argument that good marriages can exist outside of convention - and goes even further to suggest that ""swinging"" strengthens a marriage. It avers,  that like most animals, monogamy is not an innately, natural, human trait but rather that it's against all of our human tendencies.  It advocates  sex  purely for pleasure  and differentiates it from the emotional and loving  sex between a married couple. The movie shows women finding their sexual empowerment and how their roles as mothers, wives, and individuals in society we're greatly changed this revolution... it did a great job of depicting that all of these changes were not without their downsides. It is a great look into that time period and did a great job of showing the mindset of the time.",1484524800,3,1502,5.0
