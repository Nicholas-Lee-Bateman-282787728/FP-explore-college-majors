488454,4,6302610605,"Richard Bailey didn't cut the most heroic figure among Republic's serial  heroes, and his voice sounds a tad on the sissy side. But he was built like  stuntman Tom Steele which is what counts, because Steele made his character  look like quite a battler. Even so, heroine Linda Stirling saves the life  of Bailey's criminologist character about as many times as vice versa in  this exciting chapter-play, about one of a group of suspects on an island  who has developed a Frankenstein-like spark-throwing transformation machine  which can literally turn him into another person, the physical  personification of his pirate ancestor, played by Roy Barcroft. It is said  that this was one of Barcroft's favorite roles, because it was something  different from western heavies. Indeed it was, and Barcroft revels in it.",968025600,14,816,5.1603053435114505

488505,5,6302610605,"For those of us who love these old time serials(way before my time), this one offers everything one could desire: atmospheric setting, lots of action, 15 chapters, thrilling cliffhangers and a pretty good mystery to solve.  Good guy vs. bad guy, entertainment for entertainment's sake only, and besides a good mystery, there are a few catch you off guard twists.

Linda Stirling, queen of the serials(our girls love her in""Tiger Woman"") and Richard Bailey, I think he does a decent enough job as a amiable hero, head to Mystery Island where Ms. Stirling's character's father/scientist goes missing- kidnapped by one of the 4 owners of the island(which one is it?  Or is it someone else?), who's able to transform himself into an ancient pirate as his disquise.  His plan: force the scientist to create a radium machine that can be used for...world dominion?!

The stuntmen/woman do a super job- crashing over tables, diving on each other, flipping around the room.  There's never a bruised, swollen face or scraped knuckles, and even though there's a fair amount killing- there's never any blood.

The chapters last about 16 minutes or so, and always include a great fight scene, and of course, a cliffhanger.  Yes, they can be a bit repetitive-best not to watch back to back to back.  Save it for the weekends.  Our kids love watching these.  We have two daughters, and they really enjoyed this one.  Linda Stirling is no sit on the sidelines femme in distress.  She fights, shoots, rescues, flies and is resourceful.",1428624000,,1518,4.905882352941177
488506,4,6302610605,"When I rate Manhunt of Mystery Island at 4 stars, I'm considering it solely in comparison to other serials; needless to say, it wouldn't be all that fair to compare it to big-budget A-features from the major studios.  Your ability to enjoy it depends on how into motion picture serials and other Saturday matinee fare from this era you are.  Considered on that basis, this one is good but not at the level of the very best serials put out by Republic Pictures (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jungle-Girl/dp/B000051S39/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jungle Girl </a>&nbsp;would be an example of a serial which I would give five stars to).

The story is fairly standard serial fare.  Professor Forrest has designed a technological MacGuffin (the ""radiotomic transmitter"" or something like that), and now he's disappeared.  His daughter Claire (Linda Stirling) enlists Lance Reardon (Richard Bailey), a ""scientific criminologist""--think PI with a bit of technical expertise--to help find him, and they trace the professor to the aptly named Mystery Island.  The island's four owners, who must all be bachelors or widowers (other than Claire, there's not a single female part in the serial), share a mansion on the island.  But one of the four is secretly able, by means of Hollywood Science, to transform himself into the legendary pirate Captain Mephisto (Roy Barcroft).  Mephisto covets the MacGuffin and has kidnapped Professor Forrest.  While he tries to force the professor to construct his device, Mephisto and his henchman Brand (Kenne Duncan), with periodic help from a few villainous Red Shirts, try to stop Lance and Claire from rescuing her father.

Three big positives make this an above average serial.  First, Republic serials were known for their wild and wooly fight sequences, and with the legendary Yakima Canutt as co-director, Manhunt has some terrific ones.  The stunt performers who enlivened so many serials from this era got a scrap of recognition this time out, as Tom Steele (who doubled for Bailey), Fred Graham (likewise for Barcroft), Dale Van Sickel, Eddie Parker and Duke Green all got mentioned in the credits.  If you look up the IMDb entries for these men, you'll see that many of their acting roles are noted as ""uncredited,"" so it's nice that they were given a bit of the limelight this time.

Second, the beautiful Linda Stirling was simply the best serial heroine of the 1940s, and maybe of the entire sound serial era (1929-56), and she makes Claire someone audiences can easily root for.  Unlike some of Stirling's other serial characters (e.g, the title character in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tiger-Woman/dp/B004OSZSVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tiger Woman</a>), Claire doesn't pile into the fistfights very often, and once or twice it's kind of disconcerting to see her standing on the sidelines, as it were.  But that quibble aside, Claire is a great serial heroine.  She's at Lance's side, or taking a part in his plans to trap Mephisto, for most if not all of the film's 15 chapters.  She can pilot an airplane or take the helm of a motorboat, she's reasonably handy with her revolver, and she has a knack for showing up when Lance needs help.  At least 3 or 4 of the cliffhanger resolutions are of the ""Claire to the rescue"" variety.

Third, and maybe most important of all, Roy Barcroft, one of the great serial villains, gives one of his best performances here.  Barcroft has been quoted as saying that Captain Mephisto was his favorite serial role (out of nearly 20).  He clearly seems to have been enthusiastic and involved in his part, and Manhunt is the better for it.

On the downside, Manhunt has two noticeable shortcomings.  First, after 14-plus chapters of excitement, the finale in Chapter 15 is disturbingly ordinary.  I won't give away the details, but suffice it to say that you will be disappointed.

The second problem, as other reviewers have noted, can be summed up in the two words Richard Bailey.  In the early 1940s, Republic had gotten together what was--for a Poverty Row studio specializing (at that time) in serials, B-westerns and other low-budget fare--an impressive roster of leading men.  They had Allan Lane, Clayton Moore, Kane Richmond and Tom Tyler (just to mention those who worked in serials).  None of these were the likes of Errol Flynn or Burt Lancaster, but they were solid B-movie leads.  But in 1942 Moore went into the Air Force, while a year later Tyler's arthritis forced him to give up strenuous leading roles.  Lane remained with Republic well into the 1950s, but after 1944 he stopped appearing in serials (I don't know if that was his decision or the studio's).  Richmond, meanwhile, seems to have had some kind of commitment to Columbia starting around 1945.  So, by 1945, Republic was short on good leading men for their serials.  Bailey's primary qualification for the role of Lance seems to have been his strong resemblance to stuntman Tom Steele.  Unfortunately, when Steele isn't doubling him, Bailey is far from satisfactory--he doesn't project any kind of toughness or charisma onscreen, and doesn't have the kind of commitment to his part that both Stirling and Barcroft clearly have.

But these weaknesses are not enough to keep viewers from enjoying Manhunt.  The video quality is satisfactory, as is the sound.  Anyone who is a fan of 1940s serials should enjoy this and I recommend it strongly.",1417046400,5,5492,5.163841807909605

488508,5,6302610605,"This 15-chapter Republic serial from 1945 stars Linda Sterling and Roy Barcroft, with Richard Bailey (sometimes spelled Baily) in the lead roles. Clues lead a young couple to a Pacific Isle where the two find Mystery Island, hoping to rescue the girls father. He is a scientist being held prisoner by the evil Captain Mephisto, a pirate from 200 years ago. Mephisto uses a Transformer machine to travel forward in time and disguise himself as one of the four owners of Mystery Island.

During WWII many of the people involved in serials, including actors, were away from the studio, so lead actors were hard to find. Richard Bailey wasn't an ideal action hero for the serials, though stunt doubles took care of the action. Linda Sterling was magnificent, as usual. She came to Baileys rescue more often than he to hers. And Roy Barcroft was one of the kings of the bad men in serials. Although in this part the character of Mephisto was a bit weak.

For some reason a lot of extra cliffhanger scenes from other Republic serials were used in this one, possibly to save writing more scenes. Vehicles going off cliffs, etc. But they weren't used as the chapter ending, just somewhere within the chapter. It was a fun serial, though possibly lacked some zip due to Richard Bailey, but he tried. He just wasn't the heroic leading man like, say Clayton Moore.",1397001600,2,1353,4.70464135021097

488510,4,6302610605,"This serial was made in the wartime era and is put together well.  There is as best I can tell a minimum of stock footage and therefore most of the cliffhangers at the end of the episodes were made fresh at the time.  It is vigorously directed and has non-stock action.  Linda Stirling was one of the best Republic heroines and she does well here. (Love seeing those platform shoes!)  I thought the hero, Richard Bailey, was colorless, and probably picked because he was a physical match for the go-to Republic stuntman at that point (I think I saw Dale Van Sickel early on, and then Tom Steele later doing his stunting.)  This was one of those Republic plots where the chief villain, who transforms himself into Captain Mephisto (Roy Barcroft) is going to be one of the four owners of Mystery Island or else the servant, Ruga.  It all wraps up in Chaper 15 and I managed to guess wrong!  I might have given it 5 stars if they would have used someone like Kirk Alyn for the hero.  There is pretty much nothing else to pick at.  Well done, Republic!",1389052800,,1048,4.416666666666667

Special Footnote, Linda Stirling was the most popular action star of serials in the 1940s, she was spotted in an advertisement by executives of Republic Studios, who were looking for a beautiful but athletic woman to star in their upcoming serial, ""The Tiger Woman"" (1944). Despite having no experience in the kind of stunts and athletics that would be required, Stirling was able to convince not only the executives but ace stuntman Yakima Canutt of her capability. She won the role and a contract from Republic, and played hard-riding and -fighting heroines in numerous serials, Westerns, and low-budget adventure films over the next three or four years ... Stirling appeared in three other notable serials ""Zorro's Black Whip"" (1944), ""Manhunt of Mystery Island"" (1945), ""The Purple Monster Strikes"" (1945) and ""Crimson Ghost"" (1946) ... where she rapidly earned the title ""Queen of the Serials."" ... She married Republic screenwriter Sloan Nibley in 1946, then retired from films the following year, had a family and once her children were grown Stirling enrolled at UCLA, eventually earning an MA, a BFA and--at age 50--a PhD ... during 1960s, she began a whole new career as a teacher of college English and Drama.

Second Special Footnote, actor Roy Barcroft one of the most sought after badmen of the Saturday Matinee era --- His face appeared in more westerns than any cowboy villain who rode the range in the '40s and '50s --- an complete account of ""Roy Barcroft:King of the Badmen"", which is the title of Bobby J. Copeland's book on the life and times of ""Republic Pictures Number One Villain"". Barcroft appeared in B-Westerns and Serials - became one of the most recognized actors, when you heard that familiar voice --- you were in for it. Roy was one of the few bad guys that once you saw his name in the credits, you were going to get your money's worth. Barcroft was my first favorite and my second was Harry Woods, who in many ways reminded me of each other --- I remember watching Barcroft in a variety of Republic Serials --- ""Manhunt of Mystery Island"" (1945), as Captain Mephisto --- ""The Purple Monster Strikes"" (1945), as the invading Martian --- ""G-Men Never Forget"" (1948), a dual role as the honest police commissioner and the lead villain (good & bad look-alikes) --- ""Don Daredevil Rides Again"" (1951) --- ""Radar Men from the Moon"" (1952), as Retik --- My favorite B-Westerns were the casting of Wild ""Bill"" Elliott and Allan ""Rocky"" Lane vs the under handed dealings of Roy Barcroft, boss, leader of the gang or henchmen --- every frame was B-Westerns at their best --- With knock-down-drag-out fight scenes that gave you everything you ever wished for and more in an action film --- fellow actors, producers and directors all agree Roy Barcroft was as beloved as anybody else in the Motion Picture business.

488513,3,6302610605,"Why Richard Bailey?  Maybe all the good leading men hadn't come back from World War Two yet.  And why that ugly checked jacket?  After spending the wardrobe budget on Captain Mephisto's bellbottoms, they probably had to get Bailey's jacket at Goodwill.  Heck, in most of his fights his jacket doesn't even become unbuttoned and his hat doesn't fall off!

The undistinguished Bailey plays distinguished criminologist Lance Reardon, who helps Claire Forrest, played by serial queen Linda Stirling, search the island for her scientist father.  Professor Forrest is a prisoner of Captain Mephisto, an 18th century pirate who has invented a machine which turns him into one of his four descendants who inhabit an island--or maybe it's the other way around.  Anyway, Mephisto is played by one of the all-time popular baddies, Roy Barcroft.  Barcroft is much better in this role than he was as the title character in ""The Purple Monster Strikes,"" which he made in the same year (maybe the bellbottoms helped).  When he was a Martian occupying another man's body, I bought it; though the process is similar, here I don't.  I don't know why they needed the metamorphosis, it would have been a perfectly okay serial without it, but there it is, and it doesn't work for me.  Here's hoping you enjoy watching the change, because the same exact scene occurs in every chapter.

Lind Stirling (""The Crimson Ghost,"" Zorro's Black Whip"") is her usual competent self, which is a good thing because without her Reardon is dead meat.  Perhaps his most common line is, ""Thank you, Claire!"" every time she rescues him.  In a remarkable case of ""you'd-never-recognize-him,"" Kenne Duncan plays Mephisto's chief henchman Brand, quite a turnaround after playing the calm, almost otherworldly Ram Singh is ""The Spider's Web.""  Yakima Canutt, the world's most honored stuntman, retired to second-unit directing after being injured in 1943, his most famous example of which was directing the chariot race in ""Ben Hur"" (1959); he directs the second unit in this picture as well, so you know the stunt work is good.

The final cliffhanger has a bad cheat.  Claire's plane dips below the rocks and we clearly hear the plane crashing, but when the final chapter begins there is no crash, and the plane simply rises from behind the rocks.  And the ending is rather weak, as if they ran out of time and had to wrap up everything in two minutes.  This one was well beyond Republic's so-called golden era.",1136592000,5,2468,4.932203389830509
