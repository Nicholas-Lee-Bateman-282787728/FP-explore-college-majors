1264133,1,B00003CM1K,I didn't pay (dollar amount) to see people do pushups and situps. I can go to the gym and see a better emphasis on physical training. It didn't show the real stuff that makes a United States Navy SEAL. I wanted this tape because I felt it would give me some insight in there training to give me an egde. The title does not match the contents of the video in any way. People want to order this tape because they want some type of motivation in there physical or mental endeavors.  This tape does not deserve the title that it has.,1007424000,10,529,4.186274509803922
1264134,5,B00003CM1K,This tape was a powerful workout tape for me and has put me into better  shape and gave me confidence.  This is a must have for any Navy Seal  fanatic.  But if your not ready for a challenge this tape isn't for you.  This tape also carries a warning that if your a beginner consult with a  docter first.  So please take a look at this it will be worth your money,962582400,20,362,3.9444444444444446

1264245,5,B00003CM1K,"The Navy SEALs Workout provided great motivation for students in our school's physical education classes that are designed to develop the endurance, strength, and flexibility of the student athletes. Some students planning to enter the military after graduation from high school also liked to use the workout in order to phyically prepare for when they would go to bootcamp.",1240704000,,374,5.3559322033898304
1264246,3,B00003CM1K,"I'm not the most fit person in the world, but have had a care in the past for being in shape, and have recently renewed my interest.  I'd used military-themed programs and books in the past to reasonable effect, and thought this might be a good one to follow, too.

It has several different sections - warm up, pull exercises, push exercise, ab workouts, etc.  These are done in isolation from each other, with rest periods between the exercises.  This doesn't lend to the routines having a cardio benefit.  The downside for me was that I expected it to be tough and challenging, as would befit anything with the title `Navy Seal'.  The pull-ups are done in sets of three - while it might be challenging on the third or fourth set at the start, it isn't that big a deal.  The push-ups tend to be done in sets of ten.  Excuse me?  What is tough about that?  Even in my non-exercise days I could do multiple sets of ten with no problem.  For absolute beginners that might be necessary, but I wonder how many absolute beginners are going to get this?

The only workout section I found to be a challenge was the ab workout, and that was because I was introduced to a few new movements.

One thing that others have noted in reviews that I shall repeat is that a place to do pull ups and dips is necessary.  This isn't made clear from the DVD packaging itself, and a major portion of this DVD workout involves pull-ups of different kinds (wide grip, behind-the-neck, etc.) and dips.

The instructors and trainees are on their best behavior, and the trainees seem to be much better in terms of doing the exercises than in documentaries I've seen where Seal trainees are being put through their paces.  This was obviously filmed over some time that allowed the participants to get cleaned up between takes, making it a bit less realistic.

I have no doubt that Navy Seals are as tough as they come.  I have no doubt that I can do everything in this video program and not be anywhere close to their fitness level.  While I never really expected to (being past 40, etc.), I had hoped it would present more of a challenge than it did.",1165536000,9,2123,4.425257731958763
1264247,3,B00003CM1K,The title description never mentions that a pull-up and dip bar are required for this workout. I got it mostly to remind me of PT cadence.,1151020800,2,138,4.346153846153846
1264248,5,B00003CM1K,Great Dvd work out. It took a while to get caught up to there level of fitness but then it was a great work out,1142380800,2,111,3.48
1264249,4,B00003CM1K,"I think this video was great but, you have to know what it really is.  When you watch it you see the BUDS trainees getting a minor thrashing.  You should just follow what it does and build up to the reps that they go to. If your looking for somethings to introduce into your current work out, or if you need some ideas to start a work out routine, then you might like this video.  The quality isn't the greatest, but then again who really cares, you get the point, and they show you how to do each exercise propperly.",1127952000,9,517,4.15

The workout itself is intense and focuses on strength training using your own bodyweight for resistance.
Expect varations on countless pushups-situps and pull ups, neck and triceps.
Some of the reps are really high and you'll have to build up to it to really participate to the full degree.  In any case expect to wake up the next morning with something sore.",1064188800,7,610,4.691588785046729

1264252,4,B00003CM1K,"This video is great if your thinking about BUD/S, the pushup, ab and dip sections of the video are killer.  However, the pullup section of the video is a little weak, you better be doing a whole lot more pullups if you want to make it at BUD/S.

7917252,5,B00003CM1K,"I love this workout. I'm a 5'4"" 115lb female. I was weight training mostly for about a year and hit a plateau and wanted something really challenging. The first time I tried this I almost puked about 5 times, mostly during the ab workout. I have no military experience so I can't speak from a veteran's point of view. The pro's are you don't need expensive equipment, I currently use chairs to modify dips but I'd recommend a dip stand. You'll need a pull-up bar. If you live in an apartment or small house this is ideal since you're using your own body weight for resistance, which is really tough. I like that the PT instructors yell at you and prolong the reps, this was new to me. I try to do parts of the workout every day. I recommend a weighted vest with the legs workout, you don't need it but for me it helps since I have a hard time building muscle. I will say I do not do the ""neck"" exercises as I'm fearful of straining my neck and paralyzing myself, but for those of you that are/were in the military I'm guessing you know how to exercise your neck muscles safely with good form. For those of you that get discouraged doing this workout, it takes time to do what they do. Remember these are Navy SEALS, not folks of average physical strength. It's been a month and I finally am getting the strength to attempt the tricep push-ups. The atomic sit-ups are the worst and chin-ups are a huge challenge. These guys aren't messing around. I didn't clear any of this with my doctor but you probably should if you have any health concerns. Also the video says stop if you feel sick, but for me if I feel like I'm going to die that's how I know I've given it my best. Do what's safe for you though. Good luck guys!",1406160000,,1718,4.256880733944954

7917258,4,B00003CM1K,"Yes the picture quality has a lot to be desired but it is a solid program.  Also why would people give bad reviews because they are too cheap to make their own pull up bar, I went to lowes and made a heavy duty one out of cast iron pipe for around $30.  If you don't want to make one buy one that hooks in a doorway.  As far as a dip station use two chairs.  Bad reviews because you are cheap does not mean this is a bad product.",1296777600,6,429,3.7333333333333334
