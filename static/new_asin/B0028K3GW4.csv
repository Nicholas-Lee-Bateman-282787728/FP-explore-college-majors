Beginning with some nude women hatching from a cocoon, it shows no full frontal nudity; when I bought it, I was expecting it to be really sexually explicit with many full frontal scenes. However, I saw no full nudity in the film, so you may want to try something else if you're looking for that. It's also limited with its nude scenes; I was expecting more nudity for a film like this. The abandoned type locations were a pretty good place to shoot the film; some may or may not like that because the scenery may be a hit or miss with some. As for the gore, it has a good amount with some cool scenes; a scene near the end when a guy is mutilated by the female vampires is worth mentioning. However, I actually expected it to be a little gorier with constant splatter throughout; it's a very gory film, but it doesn't have nonstop blood and guts. I liked the directing, but some may get bored in between the gore and violence. Whatever story or character development they tried to attempt isn't that interesting. Despite that I really liked the film. I thought it would've been better if they just showed nudity and gore throughout, instead of adding some unnecessary dialogue. It may be of interest to some who are just looking for a simple to watch independent vampire flick with gore, or if you just want to see all these lesbian type vampire splatter flicks.

The DVD-R plays well. There's also a commentary. The quality overall is pretty good. There's no chapter stops.",1495065600,,1604,4.512027491408935
8356345,2,B0028K3GW4,"If you ever saw the classic 1974 film ""Vampyres"" by Jos Ramn Larraz you'll pretty well have covered this poor modern low budget film.

This has many of the same elements of the 70s film but Valeria Dombrovschi can't compare to a Marianne Morris or an Anulka Dziubinska.

The same elements; fangless female vampire lovers lure men to their domain and ply them with a special wine, then feed. There's even the shower scene of the two of them lamenting wether to get rid of one man they've hung onto for a while.

There's also a couple near-by doing a survey, and like the classic film there's a similar run-in between the wife and the vampire ladies.

One of the few new elements is that the vampires become encased in a skin/cocoon. I thought another might be their black eyes, as per the box cover but this has no relation to their appearence in the film.",1248220800,3,855,4.461538461538462

So, where to begin? For starters, you must know that this is a shot on video micro-budget flick. So if you're already offended then read no further. What I liked about RED SCREAM VAMPYRES (RSV) is that, despite being shot on video, it was still visually appealing. The typical pitfall of tiny budget indie films such as this is that the picture looks like poop and everything seems to be shot in someones house using ""all natural"" lighting. Yuck. However, RSV was mostly shot in an abandoned train station which gives it a boosted production value. The sets are never boring to look at which is nice. One thing that could have been better would have been some more establishing shots to show off the interesting location. But these missing is likely caused by the biggest indie burden: no time, no money. So it's completely forgivable.

To sum up the story, 2 hot vampyre lesbians spend their days coaxing men into their lair for feeding. A couple of archaeology students are trying to make their way into the train station where these vamps live; unbeknown to the students. While the students try to get in, the vamps are undergoing their own drama when one of them falls in love with one of her dinners and is hesitant to kill. That's it in a nutshell, I don't want to give away the rest of the movie but it's safe to say the plot is pretty simple and straightforward. And this is where I think the film is going to be polarizing for audiences. RSV is primarily a visual movie. If you're into hot chicks, gore and heavy metal, you'll find a lot of smiles during your viewing experience. If you don't like the fact that the movie captures a snippet in time of a larger idea, leaving it up to the viewer to be on par with or not, instead of spelling it all out for you then you'll likely not enjoy RSV. The movie opens up with naked vampire chicks being ""birthed""  from a nasty goo pile set to a rockin' soundtrack. It's an effect we've all seen before. From the classic birth scene in Xtro, to the wall scene in The Frighteners and all the way to the comical rhino birth in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Yeah, we've seen it, but it's still f-ing awesome to watch. This opening scene really sets up what the rest of the film is going to be about.

Now, there are moments where the movie falls off a little bit. Being that the plot is kind of thin, this is bound to happen. However, it's in the visual style and weird moments that I was saved every time. What happens in RSV is that you watch a couple of people talking and then... BAM! You're hit by a semi-truck of demented video-acid-trip madness. Several times I was knocked into a lapse of schizophrenia asking myself ""what just happened?"" to which I respond ""I'm not sure, but I think we just got skull f@##$@!"" It's these moments, where the film dips into an artsy/noir/goth-erotic/heavy-metal grind machine, that keeps things going.

Another pleasing piece of the pie is the use of practical special effects. I don't know about you, but I'm tired of seeing CG blood splatters in films. Unless you're making 300, you should be aware that your CG blood looks silly. RED SCREAM VAMPYRES uses nice sprays of practical effect blood. This was nice, given that more and more of small budget films these days have become reliant on goofy blood-splat compositing. There is a scene of a guy having his face clawed that is really quite impressive.

The acting. Here we're pretty much 50/50. It's not all bad, not all good. It is really quite obvious that all of the actors are giving a 100% effort. These aren't big stars, but they're aspiring and giving it their all and it's really quite obvious. For a film like RED SCREAM VAMPYRES, the acting only needs to be passable for it to still be effective; and it is. But quite honestly, who has time to critique and nitpick this kind of thing with a film such as this? What do vampyre chicks do after a night of screwing and feeding, covering their bodies in blood? They take a shower together and nibble down on the snack box to reinforce their trust for each other. Acting-schmacting.

So the final verdict: RSV feels like watching a fetish film of sorts. Obviously, it's not one, but it has that sort of dirty underground tinge to it. It's dark and gritty. Just the way I like it when accompanied by a fridge full of cold beer. Current budgetary constrains found me drinking Schlitz Malt Liquor during this one; a perfect taste for the experience. 3/5. Thanks for reading.",1247270400,8,4541,4.503640776699029
