6854307,5,B00Q599970,This is a good show and a funny show  with good songs like The Chipmunk Song and Witch Doctor. You Should get it.,1429660800,,113,3.9130434782608696
6854308,2,B00Q599970,"At this rate, all of us who care about the show will die of old age before the entire series is released.
Prepared to be haunted, Bagdasarians!",1428278400,7,143,4.333333333333333
6854309,4,B00Q599970,"Three episodes, yes, and hopefully there will be more releases. The video and sound quality are excellent, full of humor and music with the
character designs and music style I prefer. The Chipmunk song is included with nifty visuals and they also do Seville's pre-Chipmunk Witch Doctor. Limited animation but nifty colors and each episode includes a short with inventor Clyde Crashcup and his assistant Leonardo. Sad that closing credits not included; do yourself a favor and watch the bonus first, a preview of the new Chipmunks where they look more human...after that low point, watch the rest to better appreciate the high quality of the '61 show.",1426723200,5,650,5.027777777777778
6854310,1,B00Q599970,"So after all of these years of waiting on a commercial release of The Alvin Show....... they release 3 episodes! WHAT!!! The bagdasarian estate is so chintzy with this property, it's ridiculous. Why not just charge us $49 and release the entire series. I would pay it. I haven't purchased this product yet... mainy because I already have all of the episodes, uncut, and complete with all of the original and different openings, bridges and intros. Where did I get them???? I ain't sayin.
But I give this set one star because it is a great disappointment to those of us who loved this show the first time around. Maybe in five more years they will release part 2, with three more episodes.",1426291200,20,688,4.6016260162601625
6854311,5,B00Q599970,"At last!!! After so many tiresome remakes with the characters ""cutesefied"" to death here are the originals in their original form! Alvin and the chipmunks with Dave Seville, their manager, and the U.P.A. type artwork remastered and restored to its 1961 U.P.A. limited animation brillance!!

Whether Alvin teaches an Eagle to get over his fear of flying and Dave is taken away by the cops after there is no eagle nearby or Dave's frustration mounts when an ostrich tries to hatch his egg shaped car Alvin's adventures will keep one  laughing and then there is the forgotten but funny Clyde Crashcup whose wacky inventions keep one laughing! If you enjoy ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE, U.P.A.s JOLLY FROLICS and MR. MAGOO cartoons that have all been restored to mint condition I think you will enjoy this! I've only watched the 3 early tv episodes, not the bonus of the new Alvin show since I am tired of the cutsepoo remakes and realistic CGI chipmunks movies!

So after years of redesigning the characters, the U.P.A. chipmunks are back! Lets hope for more remastering of more 1961 episodes of this show!",1426291200,6,1095,4.8449197860962565
6854312,4,B00Q599970,"It's great to see the Alvin show on DVD.  Been a fan for several years.  Quality is very good.  I wish they would release all episodes of the show.  Being a big munk fan like so many others here, there are issues with episodes out of order.  Most people probably won't notice.",1426118400,2,276,4.230769230769231
6854313,1,B00Q599970,"3 episodes ?! that's all ? do they have any idea who their market is and who's actually buying these things? that's a lot of work and production for a 3 episode package. I 'm criticizing the dvd, not the wonderful show.",1426118400,11,219,4.238095238095238
6854314,1,B00Q599970,"I just looked on TVShowsondvd website and it said only 3 episodes on one disc. One of which was already released. It's going to have Episodes 1,4 and 10. They need to release box sets of which we all want. I've rated past Munks releases for the same reason. They just keep releasing repeats. I may or may not buy this. They may release another one down the road which will have 2, 10 and 8 for an example they keep releasing one duplicate episode and 2 new ones. Or 1 new one and 2 repeats. Give folks a heads up. The 2 disc set is wrong, the disc will only contain 3 episodes.",1421798400,9,577,4.0701754385964914
6854315,5,B00Q599970,always loved this cartoon. glad it coming out on bluray. its better than the 80's version.,1420761600,3,90,4.6875
8690392,4,B00Q599970,"It would be much better if we could have the whole series, but this little taste is the best I've seen so far.  It brought back fond memories from when I was a child.",1496275200,3,166,3.8823529411764706

8690394,1,B00Q599970,"I LOVED THIS SERIES AS A KID.  And still do. The powers that be, in producing this DVD, have done a great disservice to those among us who love the show and want to introduce it to our kids.  Yes, there are just 3 shows - which is ridiculous in an age where complete series are the DVD rage.  Personally, I also hated that the end credits were trimmed to just have the Bagdasarian logo - with no other credits whatsoever.  I believe the owners/producers of this DVD have done a disservice to the creators of the show.  I also note that time on this DVD is devoted to the new Alvin and the Chipmunks.  My kids enjoyed what I could show them of The Alvin Show.  But this isn't much more than a promo for the new stuff.  Caveat Emptor.",1465171200,,732,4.141843971631205

8690396,5,B00Q599970,I grew up listening to this on a record. Glad to share it with my son. Love it's simplistic humor & the art work or the back drops.,1446422400,,131,3.7142857142857144
8690397,5,B00Q599970,"Don't listen to people who are negative about this release. These 3 episodes are beautifuly restored. A lot of people say that if enough people buy this set,they might release the complete series.",1437177600,,196,4.96969696969697

8690401,2,B00Q599970,"Why no end credits? (You can see them on the dailymotion website.)  It has a nice rendition (sans lyrics) of the theme music. Like other posters, I'm annoyed with just 3 episodes on a single DVD, one of which was released earlier. (I hate double dipping.) Jules Engel's art direction looks fabulous on these gorgeous transfers, but at this late date, we deserved more...",1431907200,3,370,4.78125
