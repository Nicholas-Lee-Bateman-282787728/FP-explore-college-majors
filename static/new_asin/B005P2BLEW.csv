Deep Red it is not, but the film has its moments of effective creepiness, many of them in the developing relationship between Ubaldo Terzani and the main character.  Had the identity of the killer been more effectively delayed, it would have been a better film - and also more true to its giallo heritage. However, this is a minor point and it does not spoil the film.  The gore, when it comes, would have been the envy of Mario Bava and Dario Argento in their time. The acting was good and the production values were high, something that cannot be said for a lot of what passes for horror these days.

By the way, the one negative review for this film is, in my view, both incoherent and inappropriate. There are some other things that could be said about it, but why bother?

They have released exquisite Blu-ray editions of films by known Italian directors, such as Luchino Visconti, Federico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni, Fernando Di Leo, Romolo Guerrieri, Antonio Pietrangeli, and others. In addition, they have released horror films titles from the 60s and 70s, when Italy was exporting them to the world. Gabriele Albanesi's ""Ubaldo Terzani Horror Show"" represents an original and electrifying sample of the triumphant, new wave of Italian horror movies directors.

The films stars Giuseppe Soleri as Alessio Rinaldi, a young, idealistic filmmaker who wants to direct a horror film. During his meeting with producer Tommaso Curreri (Antonio Iuorio), he is told that the old horror stories made in the Italy in the 60s and 70s were not interesting anymore, and that he should think about television movies. As an act of good faith, Curreri suggests Alessio that he should contact famous horror writer Ubaldo Terzani (Paolo Sassanelli), whose books are bestsellers. Alessio does just that, and buys all of Terzani's available books, which appear to be disturbing, and cause him nightmares when sleeping.  He drives to Turin, where Terzani lives, and the author welcomes him. Terzani is smooth and likeable, makes himself available to Alessio, and soon they begin writing a screenplay together. His first rule in writing, as taught by Terzani, is that ""the horror...the horror is inside you.""  Soon thereafter, Alessio's nightmares return, while he is staying at the Terzani's house. Soon, too, he will learn what real horror is. Ah, you also have to add Sara (Laura Gigante), Alessio's girlfriend to the mix, and you'll have one hell of a ride.

Gabriele Albanesi is no stranger to horror movies, as he already has another film, ""The Last House in the Woods"" (2006), under his belt. As I said earlier, ""Ubaldo Terzani Horror Show"" is original and smart. It is low-budget filmmaking at its best. The Blu-ray edition includes audio commentaries by the director and Antonio Tentori, making-of documentary, ""Bracatti"" (short film by Albanesi), a booklet with information about the film and the director, and more.
