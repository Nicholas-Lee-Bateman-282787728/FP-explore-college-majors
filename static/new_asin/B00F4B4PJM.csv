It's a little difficult to grade this set in some ways because the elements vary in several ways.  There is also some misnaming on the discs to try and tie the whole set together when they are actually two different documentaries thrown into a set and given a name that is not really representative.  Is it a cash grab?  Yes.  But if you like the package, are interested in the content, and don't own these two documentaries, it may be worth it to some people.  I suggest at least waiting to see the price come down from the U.S. debut of $34.99.  I got it for less and I even imported it.  The two documentaries included are:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-of-the-Somme-The-True-Story/dp/B00SZCN1TM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battle of the Somme: The True Story</a>&nbsp;(it is about the propaganda film, not the battle itself) on 1 disc; the other is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWI-100-Year-War-1914-2014/dp/B00HWOFDUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWI: 100 Year War 1914-2014</a>&nbsp;3 disc set.  This is NOT what is printed on all the disc surfaces as they are made to look like a group set with different titles.  One disc even says Apocalypse WWI which is an excellent series but absolutely not contained in this set.  That is a reference to one episode title.  I am not so happy about the deception and I had to do a little digging just to get it all straight.  However and again, if you want the items in the set, it's still something.  Here is a little more breakdown on the content:

BOOKLET: Explains why the war broke out and how technology and tactics developed throughout the conflict.  Discusses battles and their importance in the outcome. Contains over 100 hundred images together with maps of the Western Front.  At 112 pages I don't really expect it to be a serious book on WWI so I don't think it should be judged harshly.  There are grainy and other enhanced photos from WWI that are pretty nice to look at.  A few beautiful paintings including 2 page spreads of both paintings and photos.  The paragraph on each topic is obviously very simplistic.

DISC 1 - BATTLE OF THE SOMME - ***ACTUAL TITLE IS - BATTLE OF THE SOMME: THE REAL STORY (2006) - that focuses in part on the famous film footage taken by Geoffry Malins and John Mcdowell and mixed with staged scenes and released as an immensely successful propaganda film.  The investigators identify some scenes that are real and some that were staged. They travel to the Somme battlefield and identify locations seen in the film.  They bring in a forensics lib reader to even attempt placing words to scenes where people were speaking (The film was silent of course given the period).  There is also some focus specifically on the 1st Newfoundland Regiment as they bring in two brothers (last name Coombs) who had two relatives at the battle.  The documentary flashes from the research and investigation, to the Coombs brothers who talk about their two ancestors and don period uniforms and gear.  They travel about the Somme region.  Looking at them test and wear the gear was interesting in some ways, so was the story of their ancestors.  However, I didn't feel the Coombs brothers were a strong camera presence, though they are a bit quirky.  Oddly enough, some British reviews actually found this more interesting than the other documentary.

REMAINING THREE DISCS - ***ACTUAL TITLE - WWI THE 100 YEAR WAR - This is a fairly standard documentary with generally good but monotone narration.  It covers from the issues and events leading to the war, Gallipoli, and the war in Europe.  It has lots of interesting and at times fantastic footage, but you will recognize it from other programs like WWI in color.  There is lots of colorized footage mixed in with the black and white.  As you can see below, it is not only about the Western Front.  Here is a list of content:
  DISC 1:
  The Road to War
  A Botched Murder
  Schlieffen & His Plan
  The Western Front
  The Eastern Front
  DISC 2:
  Stale mate : Slaughter in the Trenches
  Gallipoli and the Ottoman Empire
  The Slaughter Continues
  The Naval War
  The Emergence of Air Power
  DISC 3:
  Revolution : The End of Empires
  America Joins the War
  The Final Year
  Armistice: The Consequences of the Peace

I expect there will also be some negative reviews because of the mislabeling and repackaging.  I believe their is some justification.  I also considered a harsh review, but I want to give a decent package a little benefit of the doubt.  Some customers out there who don't have all this stuff may like it just the way it is.  If the price comes down, it will eventually be an economical package.",1431907200,2,4846,4.929192546583851
