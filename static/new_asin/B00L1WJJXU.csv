6461408,5,B00L1WJJXU,"I got into anime back in the 90s. Fatal Fury: TMP was one of the first animes that I'd ever seen or owned back in the old days of VHS. The story was pretty grand, the visuals were outstanding especially during the dramatic fight sequences, and the musical score was quite memorable. I still hum Mai Shiranui's theme from time to time.

DSC/TEK has re-released this film on DVD and it's a welcome sight. Visuals and sound must've been remastered because the movie looks quite crisp. I don't believe this was just a subpar, VHS to DVD transfer. Simply put: if you missed the chance to buy this on DVD in the past then this is a good time to pick it up now.",1417564800,6,654,4.274193548387097

6461411,5,B00L1WJJXU,This has been one of my favorite animes since 1998. I still own it on VHS since it was the first one I purchased. This release is incredible. It's a DVD but man does this look Blu Ray quality. And the sound is incredible too! Bottom line is if you're looking for a great anime look no further. The characters are fun and the action is hot. It's well worth the $.,1411171200,,362,4.041666666666667
6461412,5,B00L1WJJXU,"As an anime collector this is a must own, I have the original released from Viz Video back in the days on VHS and DVD, I was curious about this release and wanted to support Eastern Star and Fatal Fury, it was a blind buy but what I got out of it is an amazing version, superior to the Viz released. The new transfer looks and sound amazing, and complete wide screen, I thought I was watching Blu-ray at times, it's that good.

The dub is the same as Viz version, yes there's dual language with subtitles for those who like original Japanese voice with subtitles. This version is uncut, include with original Japanese opening and ending sequence, the extra comes with US and Japanese trailers and teasers, and some art work.

I wish they would release this on blu-ray eventually but for now it doesn't get any better than this, buy I say",1408924800,18,837,4.428571428571429

Better colors, crisper image, it's exactly what it should've been....now where's that 4k HDR version?",1502150400,6,261,4.6521739130434785

6461435,5,B00L1WJJXU,"Really fun 90's Arcade Fighter movie!
At the time of it's release, back in 1994, I thought it was actually superior story and character wise to the Street Fighter Animated movie released in the same year.  Very creative use of the characters of a fighter arcade game.  The leads Terry, Joe, Andy and Mai have a really fun dynamic.  And the fight scenes were pretty epic for the time.  I actually dusted off my old 4x3 full frame DVD a few months ago and wished, man, I wish this was on blu-ray.  And here it is!  For my money, still the best of the arcade fighter anime movies like Tekken, Art of Fighting, Toshinden, Darkstalkers and the aforementioned Street Fighter.
Buuurrrn Knuckle!!!

Just received my Blu-ray.  Had to add another star for the great video quality.  After years watching my 4x3 letterboxed 480i DVD, this Blu-ray HD transfer is a revelation.  The colors and sharpness look great.  It really looks like a brand new movie.
If there's any negative, it's in the audio department.  It sounds pretty much the same as DVD.  It's not bad.  But it won't knock your socks off.
The audio is 2.0 stereo.  So not much sound separation and no bass.",1496620800,10,1156,4.570731707317073

It is good to see the friendship of Terry, Andy, & Joe in action. Highly recommend to any fighting game or 80's anime fans.",1477785600,,266,4.096153846153846
6461438,5,B00L1WJJXU,"This movie is one of the best game adaptations ever put to film.  I must again thank Discotek Media for not only re-releasing this classic, but for remastering it in widescreen as well.  This movie along with the previous OAVs are among my favorite animes of all time.  Unfortunately I was not lucky enough to grab the old DVD releases and for years my beloved classics were unavailable due to the DVDs eventually going out-of-print.  No longer.  Now I can re-watch these and introduce the movies to people who have never seen them.",1477008000,2,532,4.67741935483871

6461442,5,B00L1WJJXU,"Amazing transfer, this movie looks so beautiful I couldn't even believe I was watching a DVD at times, they restored this movie perfectly. For me, this was the anime that got me into video games and anime and just overall japanese stuff in general. One of my favorites of all time. They don't make anime like this anymore, beautiful hand drawn pieces of art.",1468972800,,358,4.609375

6461445,4,B00L1WJJXU,"Fatal Fury The Motion Picture, based on the SNK fighting video game, is the 3rd installment which follows the same continuity as the preceding two TV specials, Fatal Fury: Legend of the Hungry Wolf and Fatal Fury 2: The New Battle. Unfortunately this movie sets up a possible sequel with a rematch of Terry Bogard and Gesse Howard which was never made on film. Discotek Media did an amazing job restoring this film with a proper widescreen format. At times, I felt like I was watching this on blu ray. They also inserted the proper Japanese opening and closing titles. You will appreciate the hand drawn fighting scenes that most modern anime lack.",1443312000,4,648,4.743362831858407

8663230,4,B00L1WJJXU,I really liked this movie. Im a fan of 90s anime and this is nostalgic as hell. It does calls to mind Street Fighter aesthetically a  bit but thats a drawback. I love the music as well; so corny its good. Voice actings mostly good; a few weak parts but nothing to cry about. Overall I'd recommend this to most if not any anime fan.,1524441600,,331,4.092307692307692

One of my first Animes I have ever seen as a child in the 90s on the sci-fi Channel. Great nostalgic experience and a staple of 90s era fighting game adaptations ...that in a lot of ways go under appreciated.",1504396800,4,341,4.328125

Its not a crisp as I was expecting, but this is definitely a buy. I hope they bring the two previous animated films to blu ray.",1502755200,2,292,4.051724137931035
8663236,5,B00L1WJJXU,"This film has been a staple of my love for anime since the mid 90s. Discotek media released this on DVD last year and that was a hell of a transfer and this is finally the definitive version of this movie.

  For a movie that is 23 years old it looks fairly new. Colors pop so much more and the lines and blacks look clean! The sound as well hits the cues so well and the 2.0 soundtrack shines here.

  Terry Bogard has been my favorite character since the age of 11 and this movie has always done the fatal fury name justice. I've owned this movie twice on vhs, twice on DVD and now on Bluray. 23 years later and I still am in awe with this treasure. Long live the Neo Geo, SNK, and the Fatal Fury name.",1502582400,12,704,3.992857142857143
