8111870,4,B000EOAFOS,"This is an excellent documentary with helpful, intelligent narration and some historical background on the exploration of the Canyon by John Wesley Powell. Also focuses on Indian tribes history in the area and present day  (1988) community in the Canyon. Wonderful views of the Canyon from many different perspectives (rafting on the Colorado, mule trips into the Canyon, hiking). Only downside is the graininess of the photography, gorgeous color but definitely NOT hi-def.",1386806400,,474,5.493150684931507
8111871,3,B000EOAFOS,"This DVD was good, it had a lot of facts in it but it is really heavy in ""evolutionary stuff"".
The Colorado River certainly did not carve out the Grand Canyon, you need to consult Walter Brown's research on the Plateau and the Creation Flood, these are more fact than any ""evolutionary stuff""",1377302400,,292,4.528301886792453
8111872,4,B000EOAFOS,"The movie was made back in the '80, no wide screen picture. The presentations are nice, with useful information and even jokes. Too bad about the picture.",1313366400,,154,4.7407407407407405
