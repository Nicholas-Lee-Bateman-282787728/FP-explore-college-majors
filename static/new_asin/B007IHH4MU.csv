5089009,5,B007IHH4MU,"Captured beautifully in this film, Marilyn Sewell's story is a hope-inducing surprise and a striking contrast to the standard fare that we get from high-profile preachers in the time of televangelists and conservative pulpit politics. Marilyn's strength is her vulnerability, and the power of her story comes from her brave acknowledgment of fear and uncertainty.

Love saves the day every which way in this story. It's well worth viewing and reflecting on.",1361059200,4,457,5.347222222222222

5089011,4,B007IHH4MU,"I enjoyed this story of a woman grappling with her calling as a minister and her loneliness. Honest and compelling, it's a very watchable film. When it ended, I wanted to know how her life was still turning out in real time!",1357257600,2,224,4.357142857142857

5089013,5,B007IHH4MU,"This is a well done documentary about a Unitarian Universalist minister and her personal journey to wholeness and love.  A wonderful mix of her ministry, and her personal search for complete peace, it is beautifully photographed, and carefully edited.  I first saw it an A&E and wanted a copy of my own - being a woman I can understnad her concerns about moving from taking care of everyone else to taking care of herself.  Several of her sermons, edited down, are on the the DVD and I really enjoyed them.  Marilyn was minister of a + 1,000 member church in Portland, OR, and has several books of poetry out.  Now she is on a journey of her own.  I feel that any mature woman would enjoy this story.",1353801600,4,700,4.4296875
5089014,5,B007IHH4MU,Reverend Dr. Marilyn Sewell's documented journey of the last two years as the Unitarian Minister in Portland OR is truly amazing and heartfelt. I would highly recommend this film,1349136000,,178,5.172413793103448
5089015,5,B007IHH4MU,"The bravery of Marilyn Sewell to expose her inner insecurities, doubts and fears so candidly with the film maker has touched my life so profoundly. I think what inspired me so deeply was not just her humility, her loving care of others, but it was her imperfections, her personal failure, her ongoing inner work, and that healing and growth is an ongoing practice for life no matter who you are.

Hearing her inspirational sermons, inter spliced with her admissions of loneliness and fear of rejection...wow! She is so adept at healing and loving her congregation members to attending to there own fears and doubts, and yet she realizes that she has passed her own needs up. Yes you can be a leader and healer and yet be unhealed yourself and yet this personal complexity, this ability to be so present in one aspect and so utterly failed in another was heart warming, because it allows someone like me to also not feel like such a spiritual failure.

So many spiritual leaders seem so astute and ""advanced"" and it makes a laymen like me feel that that mountain is so high I could never climb to it's summit, and yet I am helped by this film to remind myself I don;t have to summit, I don;t have to attain anything more then place one foot in front of the other and not worry about getting to the top, as much as just take in the scene around me and give myself love and tenderness. To be available and open and know that I am in gods arms at all time, even when I fail.",1343433600,8,1470,4.380952380952381
5089016,5,B007IHH4MU,"Raw Faith focuses on Portland, Ore.'s Unitarian minister Marilyn Sewell, a complex and fascinating woman approaching a crossroad in life. The filmmakers thoughtfully bring the viewer into her story with the perfect balance of intimacy and breathing room. Thoroughly engaging, compelling, entertaining and beautiful. An absolute must-see!",1338508800,4,337,6.191489361702128
8517497,5,B007IHH4MU,"This documentary carried me through a very dark period in my life. I watched it over and over again because it brought me so much hope. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to attend her church to hear her speak before she retired, but I've purchased a few of her books and find them healing and insightful. Her care for people is evident and her journey and path to self-realization is transparent and raw. It gives me courage and hope.",1484179200,,429,4.512820512820513

8517499,5,B007IHH4MU,"This was an amazing story. I knew Rev. Sewell in the 90's but moved to Texas in 1999. I felt a strong connection with her and found her preaching to touch my soul time and time again. Watching her story, I understand better why she was such an amazing leader for the church and how I felt connected in more ways than I knew. Beautiful story about trusting the universe to provide.",1458259200,,380,4.291666666666667

8517502,4,B007IHH4MU,"If she did end it getting married and living happily ever after ... that would look more like life. I am trying to not spoil ending by being vague and clear at the same time. I always thought the movie BIG would be bigger if he did not return to youth, that would've been the Kodak moment of a film. You can't go back.",1400025600,,318,3.984375
8517503,5,B007IHH4MU,Exactly what I needed to see...there is hope and faith for me! Loved the way Marilyn is so open and vulnerable about the love she seeks and the support she seeks to love herself enough to get her prayers met! Beautiful and touching.,1395705600,,232,4.4186046511627906
8517504,5,B007IHH4MU,"I saw this lovely documentary on tv in Australia.  I was so moved by Marilyn Sewell's story, I went on Amazon and bought a copy for myself.  I have watched it many times.  Marilyn's honesty and openness about her childhood and growing up feeling scared and unloved are really moving.  I can relate to her feelings of not being valued as a child.  It just shows how you can be such a radiant, lovely person, but deep down if you have been unloved as a child, it stays with you and comes up in romantic relationships.  I am so happy Marilyn found love with George.  A happy ending, and I am a very happy customer!  Beautifully filmed with great music too!  God bless you Marilyn.",1386720000,,677,4.352
8517505,5,B007IHH4MU,"I cried just watching the trailer, and even more after, while watching it. The story about Marilyn Sewell, a brave woman opening up, accepting and trusting life and love, after a lifetime of giving to others, is to me deeply moving and inspiring. To me its about the spiritual power of receiving what life gives you and being brave even though it scares you. It also contains a rare beautiful original song by Sheryl Crow, that seem almost impossible to get hold of in Europe where i am at.",1376870400,,490,4.51685393258427
8517506,5,B007IHH4MU,"Raw Emotion. The authenticity is refreshing. Marilyn's life demands your attention.
