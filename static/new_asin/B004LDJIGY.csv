At first I was skeptical thanks to the horrible art work... hoever i did not have anything to do that nigth so i gave it a try...and I have to say it was a plesant suprise for me. Have to say this is one of the best anime drama series I have ever seen. The plot goes like this:

Makino Tsukushi, a young woman from an average income family wins a partial scholarship to a prestigious private school. Most of the students are privileged hothouse flowers and she is, by her own admission, a weed. Problems begin when her friend slips down the stairs and falls on Domiyoji, the leader of the F4, (Flowery Four), the richest, most desirable boys in school. Makino defends her friend, which earns her a red slip, a declaration of war. Not one to cry or be defeated, Makino fights back and declares war on THEM. She even kicks Domiyoji in the face, which impresses him and makes him nostalgic for his tough older sister.

Makino is torn between her disgust for Domiyoji and romantic feelings for him. There's also Hanazawa Rui, a withdrawn violin playing member of the F4, Makino's first crush and Domiyoji's best friend. Who will she choose at the end?... watch and see..",1296172800,4,1223,4.479820627802691
