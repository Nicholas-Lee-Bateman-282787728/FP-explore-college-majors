7724760,5,B01DUTUSQI,"If you would rather watch the Saturday night movie on SyFy that whichever critically acclaimed Oscar winner is playing on HBO, then you will love this movie. It is camp at its absolute best, and I loved it. Eric Roberts is my favorite Roberts and he was terrific and a far better Lucifer than Ben Kingsley was a vampire king, and if you know that reference then this is definitely your movie. Zathera (Lorraine Ziff) is creepily evil deliciousness and I rooted for her to destroy everybody. I love good bad guys and these two were great. I liked the good guys too, especially Hawk (Matthew Ziff), who hung in there just because he was loyal and brave, so I had to root for him too. All the acting was pretty good, and there was an actual story with an interesting plot that wasn't silly, which is a rarity for these kinds of movies, and its what makes it good camp as opposed to bad. I would love to see this become a series.",1464220800,3,925,4.32183908045977

7724762,5,B01DUTUSQI,"OK, let's be honest. You know what you're getting here. I rated it a 5 because it is for it's category. Is it an Oscar winner? Ummm... well, what is these days? (Tell that to ""Straight Outta Compton"" am I right? LOL!)

It's a Sci-Fi Western, made for what qualifies as ""straight to DVD"". It's campy! It's totally cute and a fun watch. I had a couple good laughs, loved the action and felt victorious in the end, which is what I'm looking for in Sci-Fi and Western movies.

It has a plot - which is more than I can say for ""Magic Mike XXL"" (loved it anyway), and heroes you root for. It's an interesting twist on some old classic themes with great visuals. The locations, costumes and special affects are really interesting - WAY better than most movies of this type. The score was stand-out quality for this genre.

I thought the acting was decent. (Or at least good enough to make you laugh!)  I'm a sucker for Westerns and I love me some Clint Eastwood, but the acting was always bad in those so with that yardstick these actors KILLED IT! LOL!  I do have to mention I thought little miss Indian was a scene stealer.  And I'd watch it again. (In fact, I'd better... I bought it and need at least 3 viewings to make the price worth it.)

Best viewing is after a few beers (or whatever makes you slap happy), but it's a good, easy watch any time you feel like watching a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.",1464048000,,1416,4.3007518796992485
7724763,5,B01DUTUSQI,"I just finished watching SIX GUN SAVIOR, and it was WELL WORTH THE WAIT!!! You CARE about EVERY character - GOOD and EVIL! There are TWISTS and TURNS regarding who is GOOD and who is EVIL! SIX GUN SAVIOR is an OLD-FASHIONED, WESTERN MASTERPIECE where GOOD overcomes EVIL, but with a PRICE. And as with any Western, sometimes the GOOD die YOUNG. It was PURE JOY being on the set for 2 days, and making AMAZING Friends!!! You ALL have something to be SO VERY PROUD OF with this film!!! It clearly is from the HEART and SOUL!!!",1463961600,5,524,4.357142857142857

7724766,5,B01DUTUSQI,"An absolute joy from beginning to end. With it's tongue firmly in cheek this movie delivers on all counts. Sure, it's camp & silly but the actors know this and play up to the fact! Well paced, well photographed and clearly made for pure entertainment! The cast are great with an award winning  Lorraine Bencivengo Ziff truly relishing her role as the demonic  Zathera. Matthew Ziff also stands out and  is certainly a face for the future! Ably supported by the likes of Eric Roberts & Martin Kove, I'd love to see a sequel or something! Perhaps even a tv show! :)",1474416000,2,563,4.5

7724768,5,B01DUTUSQI,"Two of my favorite genres come together - SciFi and Westerns! Great story line with performances that bring you in close and make you hold on tight for the entire ride! I mean, Eric Roberts as the Devil? Who cant love that!  Standout performances by Martin Kove (from Karate Kid fame), Lorraine Ziff as Zathera... she is out to get YOU, and hunk Matthew Ziff! The reason you watch movies - enjoyable all around!",1470355200,3,411,4.554054054054054
7724769,5,B01DUTUSQI,"Eric Roberts is the man!!!!!! A great well-written story with tons of twists, turns and revelations. Six Gun Savior is an updated take on the Faustian tale of a man who makes a deal with the devil. I highly recommend this movie!",1469923200,2,228,4.4523809523809526

7724772,1,B01DUTUSQI,"Total garbage.  Ludicrous storyline, and the dialogue sounds like something written by children.",1468022400,,96,6.384615384615385
7724773,5,B01DUTUSQI,"Six Gun Savior is fun high camp at its best. Entertaining and engaging, this supernatural western delivers with great action scenes and a weird multilayered storyline involving the inhabitants of hell. Kaleo Griffith is hilarious as Lane McCrae, a man who makes a deal with the devil in exchange for the chance to wreak vengeance on the man who murdered his family. Lane becomes the devils (Eric Roberts) bounty hunter and encounters many strange characters along with the way that help or hinder his progress. I loved seeing legendary Martin Kove (Death Race!!) as the rogue outcast bounty hunter as well as Matthew Ziff (Bo the bully in Martial Arts Kid) playing a good cowboy willing to purse the right path with Lane. Dont miss this supernatural western packed full of life lessons mixed with old west shootem up scenes and even a zombie showdown!",1465084800,2,851,4.875862068965517
8756895,2,B01DUTUSQI,"I gave this so-called tv/trash/movie 15 minutes only because of Eric Roberts playing the devil. Which he did deliciously well. However it was not enough to keep my brain cells from melting over the terrible acting, ridiculous dialogue & misogynistic directing. The 2 stars were for Eric Roberts still looking good. Don't waste your time on this 'festern'...",1526083200,,357,5.172413793103448

8756899,2,B01DUTUSQI,"I was glad when this one ended. Other than Eric Roberts, the actors were all pretty bad. Eric Roberts must of needed the money to act in this movie. The plot wasn't so bad. I t is a really low budget film, and the actors and special effects show that. It is watchable, just barely.",1514332800,2,281,4.127272727272727
