8316083,4,B001KSMRAC,"This DVD sound track, background, and video quality is primitive in today's market. But that is not why you are buying this product. The goal is to learn the basic's in dance move if you are a ""wall flower"". His simple instructions, demonstrations and explanations are great, too the point, and anyone can learn the basics. At the end, I wanted more dance moves. If his other DVD's are as simple and to the point as this, he has done a great job. The only reason why I gave this a four star rating is the cost.",1359331200,,510,4.268041237113402
8316084,5,B001KSMRAC,"If you care about the visual then you won't enjoy this cd and you prob won't learn dancing, trust me I tried quiet a but of cd's and some are ok but nothing gives you the simplicity and detailed information, with simple steps that are explained good and someone who actually take his time so you can fallow his steps. this is an actual learning cd unlike most of them which have nice background, and some guys dancing in dark and just trying to look cool.

Bottom line I'm not a great reviewer, but from someone like me and you, since you are looking for a beginner cd this is the best first time cd!!",1328918400,,601,4.226086956521739
8316085,5,B001KSMRAC,This dvd is fantastic. The instructor is really personable and relaxed which makes for an easy and fun experience. This is a nuts and bolts dance class more or less to get you started and to help you get your groove. The production value is basic but the simplicity is what makes this so great. He has you follow and practice along with him and breaks it down into easy to manage steps. Totally worth the money--I look forward to buying some more of his stuff in the future.,1300233600,2,474,4.337078651685394

8316087,4,B001KSMRAC,"This DVD was great fun. When I stop to prepare lunch at midday, I like to put my headphones on and, uh... dance. Except I can't dance. So it looks more like a protracted seizure involving sharp objects and sliced vegetables. Thanks to this DVD, my inner child now has a (very) small vocabulary with which to express itself.

The production values on this DVD are modest. It's about half-an-hour long, black and white, voice-over narration instead of live audio, and it features broken English. These things left me a little skeptical, at first. However, the DVD manages to deliver everything that's required. The video is clear, with good contrast. The narrator is funny. The moves are basic. The DVD introduced about five rudimentary moves.

I only gave this DVD four stars, because it's not perfect. You will need your DVD's slow motion feature to follow some of the steps. And there are subtleties that the narrator does not call attention to. If you're as tragically un-hip as I am, you'll want to pay special attention during the footwork: which foot starts on the toe, which foot starts on the heel, what does each foot do from there, what are the hands doing to maintain balance and momentum, and so on. It's easy to lose balance when practicing the spin move, if you don't pay close attention to where the instructor is transferring his weight, and when.

The instructor is so accustomed to dancing, that he had trouble staying with the identical, repetitive motions that a beginner needs to observe. Overall, though, the DVD is fun, and it delivers. With practice, I feel confident that I could master these moves. I was crestfallen when I reached the end, and I'll probably try other DVDs from this outfit.

FYI: The video perspective is fixed, observing the instructor from the front. That's fine for this style of dance. Unlike partner dancing, this style of club dancing is not concerned with leading left or right. Even though the camera doesn't move, the instructor changes position during the demonstrations, so you do get to see the moves from the side, or whatever angle is appropriate. When watching the DVD, I simply mirrored what the instructor was doing on screen.",1253491200,3,2186,4.8213333333333335
