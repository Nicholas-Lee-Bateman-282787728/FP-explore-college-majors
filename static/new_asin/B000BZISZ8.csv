8094826,4,B000BZISZ8,"That's right.  This DVD is ""Spaced Out""; just like the other DVDs I've reviewed for this totally loopy 3-D series.  What kind of trouble has Tommy Cadle, Dinko, and the other aliens gotten into this time ?  Read on.

In ""Bride of Gumpers"", Gumpers realized he has a wife ready for marriage.  Now it's up to his friends to make him a proper groom.  ""Bay of the Triffids"" has Tommy looking after his mother's plant.  Things went quite well until Dinko turned it into an alien monster. And ""They Came from Outer Space"" features Swanky nervous about the upcoming visit of his parents.  He asks the others to help him show that he's all grown up.

This series features veteran voiceovers Charlie Adler(""Cow and Chicken"", ""Brandy and Mr. Whiskers"") and Jess Harnell(""Animaniacs"", ""Totally Spies"").  Not to mention some funny 3-D antics and stuff.

Bottom line, the title says it all: it's ""Spaced Out"".",1139702400,,896,4.790849673202614
