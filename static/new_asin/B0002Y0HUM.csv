2701128,3,B0002Y0HUM,"CATCH ME A SPY is the American name of the British/French-made espionage comedy, TO CATCH A SPY (1971). Film synopsis provided on Westlake Ent. Group's product page is adequate, so this time around I'll concentrate on peripherals.

Kirk Douglas looks much younger here than his 55 years, except for a single puffy-faced moment when he's lying on one side. The best part of the story has him running over hilly Scottish country, plus being engaged in extensive action aboard a motorized dinghy. Kirk is clearly well-conditioned for these.

In it, she's top-billed over Charles Bronson. Of the more than 40 movies this pixieish red-haired gal appeared in, ""Catch Me a Spy"" is the only one listed at imdb under an English title. She has a very thick accent here but makes herself understood. A charming actress with a great figure.

Striking cinematography is a highlight of this not-too-funny comedy. Shot on location in Bucharest, London and Scotland, the Technicolor stock used adds a brilliance to outdoor scenery and glows warmly during interior shots.

Trevor Howard is here too, but he's under-used.

Background music is distracting, an overloud at times, too-upbeat Continental strings and accordion score that sounds like bad outtakes from a cancelled sitcom. Generally though, CATCH ME A SPY is easy on the eyes and while no classic, it's a pleasant way to spend an hour-and-a-half. A must-see for Kirk fans, a curio for obscurity seekers, but for the rest of viewers, of mild interest at best.",1269734400,9,2166,5.97741935483871
2701129,1,B0002Y0HUM,This movie was quite lame.  Sorry to be so vague but the plot was poor...the producer must have been working a double-shift at the nearby seven-eleven and then working on the film at night.  Not gripping at all.,1214524800,,211,4.526315789473684

2701142,5,B0002Y0HUM,"Marlne Jobert stars as Fabienne, a zany irrepressible young French woman, newly married, whose husband has been arrested for espionage and sent back to Russia. When apathetic British authorities refuse to do anything about it, Fabienne decides to catch a spy of her own to trade for her husband. She decides upon Andrej (Kirk Douglas), who is not a spy but an international smuggler, and the two become entangled. Douglas is in fine form as the suave witty professional and Jobert is the master of funny knee-jerk reactions. Romance blossoms from this unlikely union but danger is always lurking. Veteran actor Trevor Howard features along with Tom Courtenay (A Dandy In Aspic, Billy Liar) who plays a bumbling young agent assigned to watch Fabienne. I've read some very bad reviews of this movie but I find it delightful and lots of fun.",1457740800,3,838,4.908450704225352

2701183,4,B0002Y0HUM,"I was surprised to see this my Mill Creek 50 film $9 collection.  It is really a comedy and quite cute. The transfer is not great, but 40 cents I do not care.  Kirk Douglas fans should likely stay away (I do love him in as Ulysses in Carlo Ponti's film with Rosanna Podesta (I would have married Nusica and stayed but ..) You have to think of this a bit as Micheal Cain in Austen Powers Gold Member.  He is having fun.  There is a lot of British humor and it is just making fun of the whole spy world with a French actress playing a cute central role.  Scene of sadly inept Tom Courtenay sent out of the office to spy on the young lady and Chech like polka music as she out runs him and eventully surprizes him tired and dishevled in a restaurant to bravely ask ""what's up"".  Trevor Howard is always great (Think of the film ""The Liquidator"" another surprize fun spy spoof with a handsome actor playing against type).
