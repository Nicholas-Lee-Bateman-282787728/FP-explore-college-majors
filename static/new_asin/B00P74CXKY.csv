6788680,4,B00P74CXKY,"The concert Itself is amazing, the image quality is 1080i, in some cases a little bit blurry and pixeled, but ok. The concert was filmed in HD so the quality could be a lot better. The audio brings the DTS-HD MA track that is very nice and detailed, My problem is that the bass is not so boomy and the mix is not so high. You have to turn up the volume of your speakers.
Overall a medium presentation for a big concert, Robbie is an Incredible performer you can see it in this Blu-Ray.",1421193600,2,485,4.11578947368421

8686632,2,B00P74CXKY,"The venue is spectacular with 70 thousand eating out of his hands in a huge outside theater. The Picture quality is excellent in stunning HD,the set list is good and the show has  Robby flying through the air  in the beginning but it all goes down hill from there.
I agree with others that the sound quality is lacking here. Muffled with little bass,everything sounds in the background except for the vocals but this is not the biggest let down.
If you have ever seen Robby in concert or another of his dvd shows you know the man bares his soul for his audience ,except this time. Robby seems to  just be going through the motions. Either hes tired,sick or just off this night but nothing seems real. His usual bravado is missing and his off color remarks come off as uncomfortable rather than fun. Just look how long he pushes the end audience sing along to angels until it just peters out and the show is over. Not sure why this was released or why he ever left Take That after the amazing Progress reunion tour. If you want to see Robby at his spectacular best skip this one and get the What We Did last Summer dvd concert instead. I hope he rejoins Take That again in 2017 for the anniversary tour and comes out of his slump. The man is a remarkable talent and his fans deserve more than this.",1452643200,,1297,4.329218106995885

8686637,5,B00P74CXKY,"What a fantastic live show! Everything and more than expected. As an American fan, I know this may be the only way I will ever see Williams perform live, and based on the size of the crowds, I may be OK with that, as I am not a fan of being in that big of a wave of people. Even though he's older, Williams still brings the entertainment with swagger, style and gusto.",1424476800,6,368,4.054794520547945
