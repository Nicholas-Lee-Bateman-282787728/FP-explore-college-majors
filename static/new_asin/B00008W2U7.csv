1862904,4,B00008W2U7,"It's hard to believe that I was already in college when this came out.  And that I had to sneak away from the local art theaters to watch this at a downtown Saturday kid's special.  Yes, as the dust of an atomic squabble between the US and the USSR settled and a man in a giant turtle suit climbed out of the ice, I was stuffing my mouth with popcorn - with real butter in those days.
The basic film is pretty simple minded.  Japanese scientists investigating Eskimos witness an atomic accident that releases a giant turtle.  After a short flying tour of the world, Gammera descends on Japan and Tokyo for an extended lunch.  An irritating young boy names Toshio races about telling everyone not to kill the terrapin from hell.  Which is moot, since nothing can kill him.  Does the Earth get saved?  Or is the turtle toast?  I'm not telling, but anyone who has ever watched a Japanese monster movie should have no trouble guessing.
What I missed in my adolescent popcorn days was that Gammera is about 60% biting satire about scientists, news writers, and politicians (both US and international).  It makes you wince a bit to realize that the filmmakers had no delusions about how silly we all are.  And how many double standards we have.  There were moments when I wasn't sure if I was wincing at the humor or the acting.  The latter is classic Japanese sci-fi - awful.
The transfer is nothing to sing about, unfortunately.  It looks like a copy of a copy.  Which is probably exactly what it is.  Even so films like these have a certain timelessness, like bomber jackets and BurmaShave signs.  So, if you to once had a mouthful of popcorn on the Saturday matinee, I salute you.  Some things never change.",1080950400,10,1705,4.534426229508196
1862905,3,B00008W2U7,"Well, This movie is cheesy and the fx are laughable, but it was made in 1965, and that says it all. I feel that the original Godzilla movie was, in comparison, a more professional production than this one in the fx department as well as overall structure. Anyway this is the one that started it all, and that is the way this movie should be looked at. Overall: FAIR (considering.....).",1067990400,3,385,4.514285714285714
1862906,5,B00008W2U7,"Gammera's been rudely awakened from his nap (buried under an arctic glacier) by an atomic explosion; and man, is he ever pi$$ed! He immediately begins his world-threatening rampage, causing the UN to argue incessantly (in the dull, tedious parts of the movie). Thankfully, there are lots of explosions and tons of building smashing action! Enough to get me rooting for our beloved reptile, while praying for the poor shmuck in the rubber suit! There's also a turtle-obsessed kid who befriends Gammera. He's annoying like a mosquito buzzing in your ear! Listen for the nifty theme song! Pure cheese!

1862907,4,B00008W2U7,"The first of the famed turtle's movies (later changed from Gammera to Gamera), this movie is a bit cheesy looking, but if you compare it to most monster movies of the time, it's not that bad. Appearance wise, the film is scratchy, but it was made in the 60's, afterall. So, try to remember that and hopefully it won't to ruin your experience. The movie itself has a kind of  original ""Godzilla"" feel, since japanese scenes are intermingled with American scenes, with each side speaking their native language and they seem to know what the other is saying. The giant turtle looks a little goofy; he seems to be unable to lower his head in walking scenes and it bobbles like he has little control if it.
Still, if you're a Kaiju fan, the cheesiness and all it's other faults will mean little to you. Gammera is still Gamera, and, even without the giant enemy to battle with, you root for the turtle and want to see the next installment.",1054598400,3,934,4.4941176470588236

1862930,5,B00008W2U7,"The American re-edit of Gammera, the Invincible has fallen into the public domain, and is thus very easy to find in bargain bin collections. Unfortunately, every DVD of this movie is poorly cropped to 4:3, and the picture is often over-exposed. The Shout Factory has a new DVD and BlueRay release of the first Gamera, but it only features the original Japanese cut (which is good). So, as of this writing, there is no DVD or BlueRay of the American recut in its original cinemascope format.

This 1998 VHS tape is THE BEST way to watch the American version, featuring Brian Donlevy and Albert Dekker. Not only is it in cinemascope, but its transferred from a high-quality print. Also, its recorded in SP, so no tracking problems. The tape itself seems to be designed for DVDs, because it also contains supplements after the feature. They include both the Japanese and U.S. trailers, a photo slide-show, and credits.

The packaging is icing on the cake. Its a clamshell box, with a cover sleeve that has liner notes on the inside! Some notes from Peter Fernandez, explaining some details about the dubbing process.

If you're looking for quality viewing of this particular version of Gammera, order this product, and go to your local thrift store to find a VCR (they're the machines that play VHS tapes). It's worth it all!",1364947200,4,1322,4.7894736842105265
1862931,1,B00008W2U7,"My rating for this DVD has nothing to do with the film itself or the product for that matter. My frustration lies here because I can not find any information on this release anywhere on the net. Synergy is not a company I'm familiar with, so I am crossing my fingers and hoping someone can shed some light on this release for me. Is it presented in the original black and white widescreen? Does it have the U.S. Peter Fernandez english audio soundtrack?(which would be excellent as a companion piece to the new Japanese version released by Shout.) Is this a factory pressed disc? or DVD-R? How is the transfer..remastered? restored?, has it been colorized? Are there any extras???? get the picture?  Amazon's product information doesn't tell us any of this.  ...a little help please????

****DVD UPDATE****

I decided to take a chance and order this DVD and I found that the video is recorded on a DVD-R and the quality is kind of poor, but watch-able. It's faded and washed out and appears to be in full screen. NO extras at all, not even a menu screen, the movie plays over and over after it ends. Not sure if it is the Peter Fernandez dub or the Sandy Frank one. I'm not that familiar with it, but have the MST3K version to compare it too and will add that a.s.a.p.. Considering the following this creature has, this is a pretty sad release of his original film.

1862932,3,B00008W2U7,"I was pleasantly surprised that this release of Gamera the Invincible is of the original U.S. TV airing, not the Sandy Frank dub. Even includes part of the Gamera song by Wes Farrell at the start! Like the American release of Godzilla, Gamera also had many scenes shot specifically featuring American actors and patched them into the movie. Compared to the Sandy Frank dub this is the superior version as the dubbing doesn't feel phoned in and the many American scenes make Gamera's attack feel to be on a global scale. It hasn't aged all that well since the 60s, but most dai kaiju films don't. Still, Gamera is required viewing if you're a fan of the genre and if you're not, it's still a fun film to relax to and not take seriously.",1358467200,,735,4.492537313432836

1862938,2,B00008W2U7,"Shout Factory recently purchased the rights to put out the Gamera series on DVD so I highly recommend you hold off picking up this disk until their re-issue hits the street in Spring of 2010. The re-issue is going to feature the American version of the film along with the original Japanese version which has never been released in the U.S. And to top it off the Shout Factory version is going to be packed with nifty extras.

""Gammera the Invincible"" is the Amercianized version of the Japanese film ""Giant Monster Gamera"". ""Gammera the Invincible"" features scenes shot specifically for the American release, starring American actors. The storyline is basically the same between versions.

A giant mutant turtle is awoken from it's slumber when the Russians set off a nuclear explosion. The massive monster is angry at having it's slumber disturbed, and unfortunately Japan lies directly in the path of the terrapin terror.

""Gamera"" was to be Daiei studios answer to Toho's Godzilla films. And while I love all of these Kaiju films to one degree or another, I really didn't care for ""Gammera the Invicible"". The original ""Godzilla"" film is pretty dark and sombre in tone, the giant monster creates genuine menace in the first film and it works as a great monster movie on it's own. Godzilla as a creature is rather frightening, and he's a towering reminder of the horrors of the nuclear age.

Gamera....well he's a big turtle. A big, flying and fire spitting turtle yes...but still a turtle. He lacks the visual punch of the lizard king, and to top if off, ""Gammera the Invincible"" is too talky. Scene after scene of scientists and military men putting forth theories and offering dire prophecies about nuclear horror....and the whole time you just keep waiting for Gamera to make an appearance.

Daiei gets the formula right starting with the 2nd film. Gamera become a friend to Japan (and to kids in particular). The giant monster works better in this role, as protector and hero, Gamera is fun to cheer for. As a bad guy...Gamera is a bore. It's like trying to boo Mothra....sorry it just can't be done.",1272585600,2,2108,4.82825484764543
1862939,4,B00008W2U7,"Gamera is the correct spelling not Gammera but that didn't stop them from making the movie.  The movie is just as I expected, good for the fact it is a japanese monster movie.  I loved Gamera from when I was a kid, more than Godzilla.  The American acting is quit good as times, but the Asian dubbing of he movie is extremley laughable.  The case was in ok condition, except for the fact there was a half inch gash in the case, where it looks like someone took the case and carved with a knife down into it.

1862941,5,B00008W2U7,"OK, this film was seen on MST3K.  So what?  I happen to be a fan of the Gamera and Godzilla movies which is one of the reasons I enjoyed watching Joel and the Bots.  Gamera The Invincible was made in 1965, in black and white.  While being a Japanese movie it has a lot of inserted scenes for the American, English speaking, viewers.  Some of these scenes, such as the television debate between two scientists, are funny because in some ways they reflect true life.

Gamera is a fire eating, flying giant turtle from a time before oxygen was used by life.  Of course he wakes up from a million (billion) year old sleep by the explosion of an atomic bomb.  Dropped by the evil Russians, of course.  Anti-war film, anti-atomic weapons, pro-United Nations, pro-turtles, the film can be seen as a support for or against anything.  An oldie buy goodie.  The first of eight installments.  Only eight?  How sad.  I think he was just as good as Godzilla.",1159833600,,945,4.514792899408284
1862942,3,B00008W2U7,"...make sure it's the one with the brain lusting space girls! But that one is kinda intentionally comic, this is played as straight as a movie about a flying space turtle can be. Minunderstood monster is unleashed from his artic grave when a Soviet fighter is shot down and boom, we get a mushroom cloud. The studio debate between the Gamera-believing mythologist and the skeptical science writer is priceless! ""He called me an ape!"" ""No, I called you an ignorant ape!"" Reminds me of the evening talk shows on the cable news fronts...my, how far we've come that the satire still stings. The contrarian Senator brings to mind some of our finest in Washington today, head in the sand all the way. Brian Donlevy makes a convincing general. Writers (and George Lucas) take note...this is how child characters should be scripted for minimum annoyance. And Gamera himself, well, he looks like a man in a rubber turtle costume, but it works all the way to the ending. A unique ending, I might add, saving the Earth *and* leaving the door open for sequels. All in a day's work for...Nizo Takahashi! Doesn't have the same ring as Mighty Mouse *sigh*",1145318400,,1140,4.733668341708543
1862943,3,B00008W2U7,"A flight of Soviet bombers ""accidentally"" flies over Alaska.  U.S. interceptors shoot one of the planes down, causing a low-yield nuclear explosion.  The nuclear explosion wakes a giant prehistoric turtle called Gammera by the local Inuit.  Gammera attacks a model ship, flaming it with bad breath for good measure.  Fortunately, the crew abandoned ship just in time.  What excitement!  Did I tell you that this turtle is so cool that it walks on two legs?  Clever trick for a turtle.

This movie digresses for a while as Gammera is walking or flying in parts unknown.  Various characters, including Brian Donlevy as General Terry Arnold and Albert Dekker as the Secretary of Defense, debate the existence of Gammera.  This movie is relatively early in the monster genre because, as any self-respecting scientist of today knows, giant monsters exist and they are nearly all genetically programmed to attack Japan for reasons that scientists have yet to discover.  Eventually the scientists and authorities bow to the overwhelming scientific evidence (footprints, sketches by small boys, anonymous phone calls, possibly including one from Kolchak, the Night Stalker) and recognize something must be done about this giant menace!

Gammera rescues a small boy (bless the monster's heart) before going off and frying a bunch of people in a Tokyo apartment building (this is one quirky turtle).  To prepare for toasting Tokyo Gammera destroys a geothermal plant and chows down on the flames.  I guess Gammera likes hot food.  Somewhere around this point in the movie a scientist establishes that (drum roll) Gammera is not like other creatures!

The excitement builds as Gammera lands at a totally cool model airport and then begins to stomp around an excellent model of Tokyo.  We catch a bit of a song titled ""Gammera"" that sounds suspiciously (to me) like the theme from the 1960s television series ""Batman.""  It could be coincidence, or not.

Of course there has to be a plan to deal with Gammera, since all attempts to stop him have failed.  Enter Plan Z!  Before Plan Z we see model trains and a model laboratory and more models of other stuff, and then we see the Plan Z model.  Woo hoo!  This stuff is great!  Of course, I have to leave the suspense of Plan Z to the viewer to discover.

After the success of ""Godzilla,"" other Japanese studios attempted to capitalize on the monster fad.  Modern audiences will find this attempt at giant monster horror more humorous than scary given today's sophisticated special effects.  However, the models in the movie are excellent, and the laughs this movie generates for adults is worth a watch.  Young children, on the other hand, may find this movie frightening (I know I did way back in the 60s), so just because you may not find the movie frightening, do not assume the little ones won't.

They just don't make movies like this any more.  Thank goodness for that!",1138060800,2,2911,4.917864476386037

Or when they drop an H-bomb in the artic and free a jet propelled turtle from the dinosaur era, ""a missing link to the leather back"". Huh?? Ah yes back when turtles flew. Or when they drop an H-bomb in the artic and don't bother to tell the Eskimos anything. They just turn to the Chief and say, ""Take care Chief"" and they walk away. Maybe they should tell him not to go over there? Only he stops them and gives them a rare Eskimo carving dating thousands of years old depicting a giant turtle and some wavy lines. They look at the rock and babble widly at what the wavy lines mean, only they can't figure them out finally one guys says, ""Lets ask the Chief"" who's been standing there the whole time and he doesn't know. Sometimes we look back at old movies like this and think, ""thats not bad for 1965"". Until you remember that DOCTOR ZHIVAGO came out in 1965. I mean GAMERA IS BAD!! BUT in all fairness some of the miniature and monster scenes look great especially in black and white, like the attack on the nuclear power plant is very well done. It's the first (""American"" version) of Gamera and therefore collectable.

Gamera, a giant flying turtle, really didn't star in any good movies until the mid nineties, but the late sixties-earlier seventies films were fun in a sort of goofy way. This first one, ""Gammera [sic] the Invincible,"" is perhaps the dullest and most slow moving one, but hard-core Japanese monster fans will no-doubt find pleasure in it. In addition, this DVD features the not-very-good American version, with inserted American scenes (some of these are pretty funny in their sheer technical incompetence).
This DVD, from Alpha, isn't really worth buying. The print is very scratchy and faded, and is in the pan-and-scan 1.33:1 instead of the intended 2.35:1 ratio. The only plus side is a mildly diverting gallery of publicity stills and posters.",1088726400,2,898,5.157534246575342
