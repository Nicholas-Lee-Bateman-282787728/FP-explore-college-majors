8035837,4,B00030LNVM,Great Book! If you child is interested in upping their game and you want to help them this is the book for you!,1463529600,,111,3.869565217391304
8035838,2,B00030LNVM,"I hate to bash such a nice guy but this video broke my jumpshot instead of improving it. His whole thing is having a floppy, relaxed hand and a high arch on the shot. While this is (somewhat) important, many other fundamentals are laid wayside. For the longest time he would brag on his website about how he taught Mark Madsen how to shoot, and that guy had one of the ugliest shots I have ever seen until the day he retired. The best video I have seen is the one by better basketball.",1458691200,,485,4.170212765957447
8035839,4,B00030LNVM,i got this for my son as his shooting needed some help...I saw some of Coach Nordland ideas on shooting on the web and decided to buy the DVD's...after watching it we went to work on his shooting and he is much better now...we are still working on his shot but Coaches ideas work,1358294400,,279,4.185185185185185
8035840,5,B00030LNVM,I gave this DVD to my grandson who is entering as a sophmore in High School.  He has had the DVD for over a year.  At one basketball camp this summer he made 4 consecutive 3 Point shots in his final game and made the All Star Team!,1248825600,,231,3.7916666666666665
8035841,4,B00030LNVM,"This is a good video, I saw immediate positive results in my 9yr olds shot. I bought ""Swish 2"" also, which I thought is the better of the 2 products.",1245974400,,149,4.0
8035842,3,B00030LNVM,"My 10 year old daughter and 9 year old nephew were not interested in this video enough to watch more than 5 minutes. Another video I had bought had them actually trying the things shown and excited about learning. I gave it 3 stars because you can go on-line for more information and coaching tips, etc. -- Don't misunderstand. I learned from the techique shown, but the kids didn't think it showed them anything they didn't already know. I think I could have better spent that $[...].",1168992000,,485,4.586206896551724

8035844,4,B00030LNVM,This DVD about shooting is good but it is hard to teach to players. After a certain age they tend to get set in their way of shooting no matter how successful the teaching method may be. It was a still a good DVD.,1138579200,,213,3.8636363636363638
8035845,5,B00030LNVM,"Very Simple but to the point. It sets a firm goal for the players who wan't to improve their shooting, but don't know what to do other than just simply continuously shooting the hoop.",1137974400,2,183,4.411764705882353
8035846,4,B00030LNVM,"Though simple,its quite an amazing and effective video. Just watching it helps one shoot better. The only complaint would be the price (30 dollars is kind of expensive) and that one has to print out the shooting worksheet (hassle).",1128988800,,231,4.948717948717949
