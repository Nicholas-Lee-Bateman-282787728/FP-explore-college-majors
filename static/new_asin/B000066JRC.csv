1713736,5,B000066JRC,The Shape of Life video series does an excellent job of going through the phyla of animals.  The sponge episode is a little slow but the rest of the series has great footage of the animals and provides both evolutionary context as well as current research. My high school students are really enjoying them.,1318118400,6,306,4.666666666666667
1713737,5,B000066JRC,"I use this series while teaching high-school biology to my son in home-school. The videos make the subject come alive in ways that no textbook can -- in fact, for many topics, I use the videos as primary source of information. The price may seem steep, but you're buying a very polished product with up-to-date information and current discoveries (as of around 2000).

A word of warning to those who want to teach the topic from a creationist perspective: The evidence for evolution and adaptation that the videos present is so persuasive that if you watch these videos, you may struggle to maintain that perspective.",1288051200,16,617,4.876190476190477
1713738,5,B000066JRC,"I love these DVDs. They're informative, interesting, and give you an inside look at every episode's stars, up close and personal. It's narrated, but it also has interviews from specialists and researchers around the world. In some episodes, you get to accompany them on dives or testing and you certainly get to see many species of life that ordinarily would be lumped in a group and never picked out as special for any one definitive reason.

I watch these over and over again, they're just awesome!

Good for marine life lovers, good for 'testing the subject' to see if you might like future schooling on it, good for -some- scholastic review and definitely good to have playing in the background while you work from home or do chores.

These are or should be available at your local library, too, so check one out if you're still not sure!",1217289600,7,842,4.675675675675675
1713739,1,B000066JRC,Spend your money on documentaries made by BBC (David Attenborough's). This is one awful piece of work and will teach you nothing. It is so badly made that it may actually turn the kids away from paleontology/biology/geology.,1171929600,2,224,5.081081081081081
1713740,5,B000066JRC,"This is one of the best natural science DVDs I have seen. This particular series talks about the evolution of animals. (If you want something on evolution in general, get the PBS evolution series. It is very good).

Each episode focuses on one particular phylum of the animal kingdom like sponges, cnidarians etc. The way each episode paves the way for next episode is very good. There is no break in the train of thought/narration from episode to episode.

I highly recommend this series for people who are interested in nature and evolution. Very enjoyable and informative.",1164672000,,575,4.917525773195877
1713741,5,B000066JRC,"This series is great for anyone who wants a better understanding about evolution. I would without question use this series in the classroom.
 If I am having a rough day, this is the kind of stuff I like to watch.",1111536000,6,212,4.3
1713742,5,B000066JRC,"This video is about the organisms in the animal kingdom grouped according to their common ancestry and assemblage of traits defined as: "" phylum"". 98% percent of all animals fall into eight main ones and each episode features one of these eight phyla. Scientific evidences and discussion with researchers are used together with detailed 3-D computer generated drawings and captivating images of exquisite undersea creatures to explain the structure, origin and evolution of them. In addition to the highly valuable scientific information there are also beautifull and astonishing closes of creatures such as sponges, jellyfish, crustaceans, nautilus and sea stars. This is the highest level documentary and the best quality image I have ever seen.",1033516800,11,747,5.504347826086956
1713743,5,B000066JRC,"This outstanding series (originally presented courtesy of Public Television) explores the origins, development, and relationships between major life forms here on Earth. Narrated by Peter Coyote, this set of programs smartly outlines the basic structures and functions within an animal group, to give the viewer an easy to understand, front row seat to the battle for survival.
  Had trouble with Biology in high school? This colorful and elegant show highlights the competition between species and follows the paths of innovation that allow an animal to overcome the obstacles put forth by another group - making Biology (specifically Zoology-the study of animals) fun and interesting!
  Are we the best designed organism on the planet? You may be surprized to find the answer! New information on the lives and activities of members of the Animal Kingdom are displayed to the public for the first time in this series. See newly discovered (and beautiful) species of deep-sea squid, watch animals use their specially designed weapons to capture prey, and escape from predators.
  Get to know more about the world we live in! The Shape of Life is a great way to start. Entertaining and very educational, this series is worth the price!",1020643200,9,1234,5.175879396984925
1713744,5,B000066JRC,"Whoa.  When I first saw this series on PBS I wished that I could rewind it to see some of this crazy stuff again. So now that I have the DVD I can watch that starfish insert its stomach into the mussel or the anemone catch the fish as many times as I want.
I have never seen such wild creatures. They are truly alien, yet they live on this planet. A lot of the action takes place underwater and it  inspires me to go learn scuba diving!  If you are sick and tired of the Big Animals and Crocodile Hunters seen on cable these days, then this series will be a refreshing view of ""the others"" that never get their screen time.
The best part of the series is that it weaves in and out between hard-hitting science and just pure eye-candy.
Great content and easily navigated menus.",1020643200,17,776,4.194630872483222
7962434,5,B000066JRC,Exactly as described. Perfect! Thanks!,1485475200,,38,6.8
7962435,1,B000066JRC,"The one star is not for the program, which I was so looking forward to viewing, but for the condition of the item. It came in good time, no problem with that. The problem was a crushed case (as though it had been stomped on), and badly scratched disks. I just returned the whole kit and kaboodle.",1480464000,,296,4.2105263157894735
7962436,5,B000066JRC,Excellent!,1458604800,,10,10.0
7962437,5,B000066JRC,"Loved every part of it.  And with 4 discs at almost an 2 hours each, that's a lot of good watching.",1443225600,,99,3.7142857142857144
7962438,5,B000066JRC,"Wonderful camera work!  The series takes an evolutionary perspective of life on earth so may be contrary to the beliefs of some viewers.  However, the detail in which it shows the various animals etc. is second to none and definitely worth the viewing!  I highly recommend this DVD set :-)",1437091200,,289,4.74
7962439,5,B000066JRC,"I LOVE this DVD set!!! I teach in an elementary classroom, but it is appropriate for all ages, from pre-school to adult. The DVDs go from the most basic, ancient life, to the more complicated, more modern life. They are good to show children and to review/learn before you present anything about zoology. In my classroom, I showed clips that were relevant to what I was teaching, but I wished that I had time to show them all. I will be using these in years to come.",1404000000,,466,4.367816091954023
7962440,5,B000066JRC,"It's an older series, but a very good one.  My Marine Biology class loved this one.  It's very difficult to find good videos on the invertebrate world, as most people are enamored with larger, more dramatic forms of life.  The section on the Echinoderms was absolutely fantastic, the price for me was worth that section alone.",1361404800,,326,4.785714285714286
7962441,4,B000066JRC,A good overview of the different phyla of the animal kingdom. It highlights some of the more unique/weird characteristics of the phyla.,1354665600,,135,5.181818181818182
7962442,5,B000066JRC,"I was a little skeptical of this series at first. It was produced ten years ago. I wasn't sure of the film quality. I'm glad that I took the chance. I found this to be an excellent series on the different phyla of animal life. Very explanatory description for each group concerning structure, specialization, and evolution. Great underwater cinematography.",1352764800,3,356,5.0508474576271185
7962443,5,B000066JRC,"I teach high school Zoology and these videos are an excellent visual aid for showing my students how animals have evolved to become larger and more complex over time.  The language and subject matter are interesting and challenging.  The cinematography is also well done.  If you like this series, I highly recommend  Kings of Camouflage (which blew my student's minds -they discussed how much they loved cuttlefish for the rest of the school year!)  I'm not sure why there is one bad review of the Shape of Life series in the comment section; the only reason I can think of is that they don't like evolution??",1351728000,,610,4.716981132075472
