8650818,5,B004OBNMQA,"Every now and then, TV comes up with something magical, and Rake is just must-watch TV. This series, which was produced for ABC Television in Australia, is one of the most unique comic anti-hero legal series out there.

It stars an outstanding Richard Roxburgh as Cleaver Greene, a brilliant but self-destructive barrister, a self-confessed rake that charms women in a tragic clown way and - despite his best attempts to be amoral and utterly self-absorbed - nonetheless reveals a humanity that is hard not to be enraptured with.

Each episode deals with a different and usually outlandish case that is entertaining and thought provoking enough on its own, but woven through the series is Cleaver's personal life that is complicated, real and revealing - and just leaves you wanting more.

Full of wit, charm, and feeling - with liberal does of humour and humanity (sometimes at its starkest) - this unique series wins on so many points and is utterly unforgettable. If you watch only one TV series this year, do yourself a favour and watch this!",1327017600,3,1046,4.898305084745763
