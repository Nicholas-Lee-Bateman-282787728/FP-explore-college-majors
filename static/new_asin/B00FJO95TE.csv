You cant go back and get good quality on the old shows that have been made already cause most of the people are dead. Stop complaining or they will stop making us our seasons, I am happy with the ones they release, its better than nothing, and if you think about how it showed on our TV's back then it isn't poor its better with the technology of our TV's now days.

5993572,5,B00FJO95TE,How did I miss the boat on this show? While I was familiar with the sister series Green Acres and Beverly Hillbillies this one always slipped under my radar. What convinced me to take a closer look was one glance at Linda Kaye Henning and Lori Saunders. Wow! Gunilla Hutton was no slouch either but she appeared in only about half of the episodes of her only season. Lori Saunders and Linda Kaye Henning have to be two of the most beautiful women on television and having this first season in color doesn't hurt either. When being fed up with garbage that passes for entertainment these days I always take a blast to the past with shows like these. Thank you for making season three available.,1406332800,4,693,4.507936507936508
5993573,5,B00FJO95TE,"Gunilla Hutton and Laurie Saunders take over as the elder Bradley girls.  The casting is good,  and they fit their roles almost seamlessly.  Unfortunately, Gunilla missed quit a few shows, leaving only 2 daughters about 1/2 the time.  The addition of frequent guest appearances by Eddie Albert from Green Acres helped offset this defect.

A delightful combination of gentle comedy and Hooterville zaniness make this a worthy addition to my classic TV comedy collection.  Unfortunately, the 3rd season doesn't have any introductions by Linda Kay Henning.",1406160000,6,553,5.372093023255814
5993574,5,B00FJO95TE,The 60's gave all good shows to watch not like today. So if you like family friendly this is a good show to get and have on the dvd shelf,1400025600,4,137,3.6
5993575,5,B00FJO95TE,"The irresistible opening credits to ""Petticoat Junction"" with Charley and Floyd engineering that chugging locomotive, Kate and Uncle Joe at the Shady Rest  and the girls down at the water tank, all to that fantastic Curt Massey music will remain forever in my noggin as one of the greatest of all show themes.  Season three was the first in color, adding an extra credit to this very enjoyable show. But what a cast!  I don't think Bea Benaderet has ever received the praise she really deserved for holding this show together. She was a veteran supporting player in so many other series like ""Burns and Allen"", ""The Flintstones"" and ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and she excelled in this role.  Can you imagine anyone else playing Kate?  And Edgar Buchanan that  grizzled old bear cat of a supporting player from all those old Columbia westerns and early television; what perfect casting as Uncle Joe. Frank Cady, Charles Lane, all the girls and even Higgins - was there ever a more delightful canine star?  A great show loaded with good old fashion fun and down homey spirit!",1399075200,15,1072,4.793478260869565
5993576,5,B00FJO95TE,"I was so happy to get this dvd as I have been waiting to get more of the series and had season 1 and 2. This was even better than the first two, and I can't wait to get the next season when it comes out.",1397779200,3,203,3.4347826086956523

5993580,4,B00FJO95TE,"Let's face it...60's T.V. was, well, a little tongue in cheek.  (Think The Munsters, Gillian's Island, The Flying Nun or Green Acres) That being said it brings back memories of an endearing time.  I loved Petticoat Junction when I was a child and love it even more as an adult.  This is family based entertainment at its best and I am not afraid to watch it with my grandchildren.  A true treasure!",1393113600,10,398,4.486111111111111
5993581,4,B00FJO95TE,a nice family show.... i like that the douglasses from green acreas appear  occassionally.  uncle joe gets to be irrittating sometimes.the dog is super cute and kate and the girls and of course sam drucker and the guys from the cannonball are all fun to watch.  Even beaver cleavers father ward shows up on an episode. i recommend the 3rd season especially if you have 1 and 2. i t wouldve been nice to have some extras along with this set being that it's the 50th anniversary edition.,1390867200,6,485,4.488636363636363

5993584,5,B00FJO95TE,CBS/Paramount has done a stunning job with this DVD release. They have digitally restored the first color season of PETTICOAT JUNCTION so that each episode looks and sounds better than literally ever before. Using the original 35mm camera negatives has brought out clarity in the picture so you can see fine details and the vivid 1960s colors are gloriously vibrant. I promise you've never seen Petticoat Junction like this.  Plus the episodes are all complete with no footage missing. In one or two episodes there are two very brief background music changes which make absolutely no difference - lasting just a few seconds. CBS/Paramount has also done the same brilliant job with THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES Season 4 with that sister series' first season of color episodes. Both of these releases are great bargains and well worthy of inclusion in any classic TV fan's library. You won't see at vintage 1960s color TV series on DVD looking any better than this.,1387929600,15,958,4.9875
5993585,5,B00FJO95TE,This is an excellent DVD. this is an excellent DVD. The Hooterville Gang never sounded or looked any better than on this DVD.  I enjoyed it very much.,1387497600,3,150,4.357142857142857

5993588,5,B00FJO95TE,"I have been waiting 4 years for this set. I remember the last few seasons as a kid on CBS, but season 3
is the one I watched in syndication in the mid 70s. I collect classic tv shows on dvd and this (along with the
Beverly Hillbillies season 4) are a huge addition to the 60s. These shows were extremely successful in the
60s and I thank Paramount for the releases. Hopefully they will continue. Lori Saunders in color.. wow.",1384387200,5,425,4.2592592592592595

5993590,4,B00FJO95TE,"At last this DVD set has been released.  I thought the delay was to provide some time for some of the cast to do episode introductions similar to those we got on the first two seasons but unfortunately no.  This is just the episodes and although they are in glorious colour the missing introductions by Linda Kaye and other cast members to each episode made this set a little less special.  I will continue to support the release of this outstanding show but please, please include the introductions with season 4.",1383004800,7,514,4.626373626373627

5993593,4,B00FJO95TE,"The 1st two seasons are in B and W.  This season they start with color.  The show looks great.  Seeing the Cannonball in full color is a joy.  And I love Lori Saunders as Bobbie.  The first few shows they had Oliver and Lisa on the show in small parts, to make sure people understood the cross over of this show and ""Green Acers.""  BTW Green Acers was far superior to this show.  But it would still be another year before Mike Minor came on the show as a regular.  He was always my fav on the show, what a great voice.  Though this show is alot tamer then the Bev Hillbillies and Green Acers, it is still funny, a little on the slow side, but far better then anything on today.  The one person who held the show together was Bea and when she died after season 5, the show basically died with her.  I am glad they finally put out season 3, along with season 4 of Bev Hillbillies, but why take so long?  I would like to buy all 7 seasons.  Even the last two with June Lockhart to make the set compleat.  Do not make us wait.  BTW on a side note.  One of my dream vacations would be to go to the Shady Rest.  Ride the Cannonball.",1381276800,18,1126,4.0
5993594,5,B00FJO95TE,This is the colorized season and the shows are great!  Loved the whole season.  The 2 girls are different but it doesn't distract from the show at all.  Bring us season 4!!!!,1381276800,2,174,4.375
5993595,5,B00FJO95TE,"Okay Petticoat Junction fans......... Season 3 has FINALLY ARRIVED !!!!!!!!!!!!  YEAH !!!!!!

I bought my copy this morning at Wal-Mart.  I suspect sales have been good as I took the last copy.  When I checked out the cashier made a comment about how much she had enjoyed PETTICOAT JUNCTION.  We all know it was a wonderful show!

Hopefully Amazon will allow me to mention the spring 2013 release of RETURN TO HOOTERVILLE which is a sentimental DVD celebrating the 50th anniversary of the premiere of PETTICOAT JUNCTION.  Highlights in RETURN TO HOOTERVILLE include Linda Kaye Henning's thoughtful commentary, Bea Benaderet's son, Jack Bannon, reminiscing about his mother and the program, commentary from Charles Lane, Frank Cady, Gunilla Hutton, Lori Saunders, Shirley Mitchell, and Mike Minor. It was really neat to hear Linda Kaye Henning's comments as she was shown stock footage of the Cannonball.  There is also song from the The Girls from Petticoat Junction CD which was released last spring. I also learned that a PETTICOAT JUNCTION book is to be released in January 2014.

Thank you Linda Kaye Henning, all the CBS / VIACOM executives, and all the Petticoat Junction fans who persisted to get this SEASON 3 release.

Now let's get SEASON 4 ready for release!",1381017600,28,1269,5.028708133971292
5993596,5,B00FJO95TE,"After CBS released the first two (B&W) seasons of ""Petticoat Junction"" on DVD in 2008-09, it quickly became stalled with fans clamoring for the color years. Although CBS has ticked off many by making this release largely exclusive to the world's most repugnant retailer, I was thrilled to hear Season 3 was finally being released. Your local W*lm*rt should have this available for $20 so avoid paying exorbitant prices elsewhere from third-party sellers if you can.

In many ways, this is the best season of the show. Despite the fact that two newcomers are aboard as Kate's daughters, this is the last season where the show stays true to its origins: Billie-Jo is still the boy-crazy daughter; Bobbie-Jo is the studious one and Betty-Jo is still a tomboy. Steve Elliott (Mike Minor) has yet to arrive and the elder actors have not begun to expire. Gunilla Hutton plays Billie this season and does a fine job, but contracted hepatitis and missed a bunch of episodes so doesn't make as big of a splash as Lori Saunders who makes her debut as the second Bobbie.

The biggest milestone is that this is the first season filmed in color and in 1965 TV producers made sure those hues just jumped off the screen! These prints look fantastic and the episodes themselves are all uncut (with some minor background music replaced in just a few instances--no big deal).

These episodes originally aired during the same time ""Green Acres"" had premiered so there is plenty of cross-pollination between the two shows and it's fun to see Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor show up at the Shady Rest.

I hope this sells well so that CBS will follow up with at least Season Four. After that the show began to slide with Bea Benaderet taking ill and the producers turning ""Petticoat Junction"" into ""Life with Betty-Jo and Steve"".
