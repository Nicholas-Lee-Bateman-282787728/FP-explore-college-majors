3799115,5,B001UHOVWU,It was a great film. Exactly what my brother was looking forward to watching. He watched it first on ESPN and couldn't wait to own it. Great for any wrestling fan!,1347408000,2,163,4.290322580645161
3799116,5,B001UHOVWU,"As I was there for one of the matches they were taping, as well as a 4 year HS wrestler in Brandon FL, I would say that Coach Cozart practices what he preaches. This is a video for anybody's collection. I wonderful story about perseverance and dedication.",1333324800,5,255,4.446808510638298
3799117,5,B001UHOVWU,"8 of my family members (half of whom were wrestlers) watched this yesterday (Christmas Day).  Everyone was glued to the end.  The video gets inside the most successful high school wrestling program in history, showing clips from practices, matches, training camps, and even the local youth wrestling program headed by the same head coach.  It is shot like a mainstream sports documentary, so it's gripping even to people who don't like wrestling.  This documentary helps viewers understand why good wrestlers train twice a day (almost) every day and then go without food or water for 24 hours prior to each match: Not for money or a better future, but simply to win.  More than anything else, this video conveys the internal drive that makes dedicated wrestlers push themselves further than most people consider reasonable or logical.

From a wrestler's perspective: As a former wrestler who has ""normal workouts"" at the gym, this video made me remember what it felt like to be truly hungry for victory.  It made me think about the 2 mile run I had earlier in the day and wonder how I'd gotten so soft over the years.  It drove me to get back on the mat, where I spent some time this morning and remembered, ""this is A LOT harder than running.""  I highly recommend this documentary if you're a former wrestler who wants the internal drive to get back into the condition you were once in, or if you just want to see a well-shot documentary about a group of guys who work very hard and whose success has been nothing short of historical.

Availability: This item is unavailable on Amazon at the time this review was written.  I watched it yesterday via the internet store on X-Box 360.  It may be available through other electronic databases.  If someone has it, an upload would be much appreciated.",1293321600,20,1797,4.721153846153846
3799118,5,B001UHOVWU,"Great movie for any wrestling enthusiasts.  It has inspired our 13-year old to further dedicate himself to the sport.  So few wrestling movies exist, we try to get our hands on all of them and this was definately a great documentary.",1243814400,11,233,4.658536585365853

3799160,3,B001UHOVWU,Brandon is a storied franchise. Russ Cozart is a storied coach. The wrestlers have no doubt proven they are amongst the best in the nation.

3799174,5,B001UHOVWU,"Very well done dvd. It shows the hard work wrestlers put in and that by working hard you can acheive great things for even long periods of time. It also shows though that you can not always be top dog/undefeated, There will come a day that you will lose and you will have to pick yourself back up and push on even after a defeat. I espeically liked the coaches methods/ his attitude towards his wrestlers, their accomplishments, and also how he reacted when the streak was finaly broke.",1424736000,,486,4.47191011235955

3799178,5,B001UHOVWU,"A hidden gem. An inspiring story of a dedicated coach and team of wrestlers who have achieved the pinnacle of success in their sport. The coach's patient, relaxed style is refreshing, and his devotion to a public high school sports program is admirable. I found his lessons and the advice he gave his students to be applicable in areas other than wrestling.",1419811200,2,357,4.774193548387097

3799180,5,B001UHOVWU,"If you're interested in the life of a high school wrestler, you've got to see this film.  Even if you don't like wrestling, seeing the wrestlers and their inspirational coach go through their season is great entertainment.

Sadly, wrestling is becoming less popular, even though the sport is riveting when presented properly.  I'm still shocked by the Olympic Committee's 2013 decision to remove wrestling from its list of core sports.  Although the Committee reversed itself, the initial decision was a low blow.  Please support wrestling--it's an incredible sport that can bring out the best in everyone.

Finally, if you became an Eric Grajales fan like I did, you'll be pleased to know he continued his career at the University of Michigan. Check out his 2014 match against Alton (Penn State).",1412899200,2,797,5.092307692307692

3799194,5,B001UHOVWU,There are three wrestling documentaries I truly love and the Streak is One of them.  Wrestling is truly one of the greatest and most honorable sports and I am glad to see a coach who gives so much to a program and keep a good prespective on it for the kids in the program.,1398556800,,272,4.037037037037037
3799195,5,B001UHOVWU,Loved it!  Can't believe any team could have a winning streak that long.  And to have it be a wrestling team is just the best.  Very well done.,1394755200,,143,4.035714285714286

3799198,5,B001UHOVWU,"Bought this movie for my husband who was a wrestler in highschool and college in Texas. We both enjoyed this movie very much! Now he is the highschool head wrestling coach and he had his team watch this film during his wrestling period while standardized testing was going on for lower grade levels...anyways the kids loved it too. It really displayed how serious & tough wrestling is as a sport that doesn't get much recognition in Texas (it's all about football down here) and to show his kids new to the sport what they can be up against when they hit big tournaments, regionals and even state. Point is...great wrestling film for anyone who loves and respects the sport!",1375574400,5,674,4.6722689075630255

3799237,3,B001UHOVWU,"What you should know about wrestling is the unhealthy pressure to ""cut weight"".  Not 1 or 2 lbs but 20 to 30 lbs from your normal healthy weight.  There is a price to pay later in life when you are cutting weight in elementary and high school.  Look at Zeke Jones.  A great olympic wrestler.  But he was a scrawny little runt (118 lb) olympic wrestler.  He is still an underdeveloped scrawny little runt.  He should live in Hobittville.  Wrestling promotes the worst ethics and should either have the weight standards reversed or eliminated altogether.",1360713600,,552,4.7368421052631575
3799238,4,B001UHOVWU,"I like this.  As a fan of wrestling, I see wrestling as a play for real life.  Sometime we win, other times we don't but losing is not failing, it is only a stepping stone with winning to understand how to have success.
