2542575,5,B000EXDS7A,"This Collection of Betty Grable musicals is outstanding.
Down Argentine Way (with Carmen Miranda & Don Ameche), Moon Over Miami (with Don Ameche & Robert Cummings), The Dolly Sisters (with John Payne & June Haver) are three of her best Technicolor hits of the forties. My Blue Heaven (with Dan Dailey) is not in the same league with the others, but it is not bad - it just suffers by comparison. After the huge success of Mother Wore Tights, Fox paired Grable and Dailey several times but they never quite duplicated the magic. Even so, this collection will be enjoyed by lovers of colorful, tuneful, classic movie musicals. Hopefully we will see other Grable Collections with Tin Pan Alley, Footlight Serenade, Song Of The Islands, Coney Island, Diamond Horseshoe, Sweet Rosie O'Grady, Springtime In The Rockies, Mother Wore Tights, Shocking Miss Pilgrim & Wabash Avenue.

note: Since this review was written in 2006, Sweet Rosie O'Grady has been released on dvd.",1142467200,82,964,4.987577639751553

2542578,3,B000EXDS7A,"A couple (Betty Grable & Dan Dailey) think they're having a baby and then they're not so they decide to adopt one but run afoul of an officious old woman who says no, she won't let them.  So they try to buy a baby.  In between, they sing and dance and have a grand old time...........until they dont.  This musical shifts gears so many times its a wonder the entire cast didn't get whiplash!  Comedy one minute, syrupy melodrama the next, and plenty of time to dance up a storm when things threaten to become a complete downer.  Mitzi Gaynor plays a two-timing hussy who tries to steal the volatile Dailey from his dutiful wife/partner.  They go from radio to TV in the blink of an eye and color TV at that (four years before the first official telecast in color, on sets most people couldn't afford)!!!!  Dailey plays an unmitigated ham while Grable is sweet and loving as the wife who catches the dope playing kissy-face with Gaynor.
This is a weird musical wrapped around a very weird plot.",1447545600,,993,4.483333333333333

Betty and Dan were one of movieland's greatest dancing couples--- as their ""I Love a New Yorker"" number proves.  In her first film, Mitzi Gaynor shows us that she's going to go places.

2542607,4,B000EXDS7A,"A long time ago when I was a fifth grader, I was best friends with a girl who loved musicals.  This movie was one of the ones we watched together, and I had been searching for it to watch it again for the last 15 years.  My husband purchased it and several other movies for me for Christmas, and watching it took me back in time to those young years.  The movie itself is a wonderful mix of fun musical numbers and a story that many can relate to: desiring a baby. In the time it was filmed, adoption was the option for couples who could not have their own, or had lost their own due to tragedy.  If you are looking for a reminder of why choosing life is important, this movie will help you remember.  I will enjoy watching and rewatching this movie many times over the next years.",1372464000,,781,4.145695364238411
2542608,4,B000EXDS7A,"The third of four successful teamings for Fox's musical pair Betty Grable and Dan Dailey, 1950's MY BLUE HEAVEN is notable because of its unusually heavy plot and the chance it gave Ms Grable in flexing her acting talents.

Husband-wife radio stars Kitty and Jack Moran (Grable and Dailey) are overjoyed when Kitty finds out that she is finally pregnant, but their elation is short-lived when the two are involved in a car accident and Kitty loses the baby.  After spending a weekend as houseguests of their writers, Walter and Janet Pringle (David Wayne and Jane Wyatt) and falling in love with their brood of adopted children, they resolve to adopt a child of their own - easier said than done.  The adoption system is heavily prejudiced against ""show people"" and the Moran's eventual success there only leads to more heartache.

They later resort to obtaining a baby girl via ""cloak and dagger"" means in a small town from a young lady who has unexpectedly become a single mother.  In the interim, the duo find greater fame and exposure via a new TV programme, where Jack's fidelity is tested by Kitty's extended absences to look after the baby, and Gloria Adams (Mitzi Gaynor), a chorus girl with ambition who becomes Jack's surrogate dance partner on the show.

With a plot more demanding than the standard Betty Grable tuner, MY BLUE HEAVEN is a nice change of pace for the bubbly blonde star, who turns in a solid, heartfelt performance as Kitty.  Dan Dailey, too, impresses with his strong dramatic skills.  MY BLUE HEAVEN marked the film debut of Mitzi Gaynor, who dazzles in several musical numbers (""Cosmo Cosmetics"", ""Live Hard, Work Hard, Love Hard"").  She'd later graduate within the ranks of Fox starlets to headline her own string of musical vehicles (""Golden Girl"", ""Bloodhounds of Broadway"") before reaching superstardom with 1958's ""South Pacific"".  Ironically, one of the musical numbers in MY BLUE HEAVEN features a parody of ""South Pacific"", then one of the big hits on Broadway, with Dan Dailey in a plummy basso voice singing of ""The Friendly Islands"".

The best musical numbers in MY BLUE HEAVEN are ""Halloween"", a fun number performed by Kitty and Jack for the Pringle kids; and ""I Love a New Yorker"", where the two play a maid and valet who secretly go out and dance the night away when their employers leave the house!  MY BLUE HEAVEN is one of Betty Grable's most noteworthy titles, if only for the unusually dramatic demands of its plot.",1372377600,,2466,4.817535545023697
2542609,4,B000EXDS7A,I love these old movies because moral values showed in positive images of right and wrong.  This couple shows what a family can be even after much heartbreak.,1370908800,,158,4.642857142857143
2542610,4,B000EXDS7A,"My Blue Heaven was an enjoyable way to spend an evening, especially if you love old-fashioned movie musicals. The songs and dancing were delightful. Betty Grable's legs were at their best. Even the babies were adorable. The plot was a little thin, but the title song more than made up for it. I recommend this for anyone who wants to spend some time being entertained, but not having to think too hard. It was certainly worth the rental fee.",1370476800,,441,4.594936708860759

2542622,4,B000EXDS7A,"Betty Grable and Dan Dailey star as radio/television stars who want to have a baby. They begin with discovering Kitty's pregnancy, but she loses the baby in a traffic accident and is told that she cannot have children ever after. After spending time with another couple's big family, they are given the idea to adopt, so they apply at the same agency where that couple got two children. But their status as show people does not reflect well upon them and they're turned down. Desperation makes a shady deal to adopt a young woman's daughter seem tempting, but Kitty begins to wonder if maybe she isn't supposed to have a baby after all.

The story is played out between lavish musical numbers, both between Grable and Dailey and Mitzi Gaynor and Dailey. It is dazzling entertainment, and although the film doesn't grab you emotionally, it is great escape. It is very much like a sugar coated re-make of Penny Serenade, a film which combines music and a couple's struggle to have a child.",1326067200,,987,4.705202312138728

2542625,3,B000EXDS7A,"Because the four films in this collection were released individually at the same time as the collection, the person or persons who decided what to include in Vol. 1 didn't do right by Miss Grable's memory. After all, why duplicate films that are available separately? In any event, only two of the films are worthy of being included in the first installment of the Grable collection: ""Down Argentine Way"" and Moon Over Miami,"" two of the star's earliest Technicolor extravaganzas.

Being cast in ""Down Argentine Way"" was a lucky break for Grable because its intended star, Alice Faye, begged off on account of illness. It didn't hurt to have Carmen Miranda making her American film debut.

""Moon Over Miami"" Grable's second color feature, is a breezy song-and-dance feast in which the gorgeous Technicolor is as much of a co-star as Robert Cummings and Don Ameche.

Although ""The Dolly Sisters"" was a big hit in its day, Grable shares the stage with her clone, June Haver, which I found distracting even if it was necessary for the story line. The film could have been included in Vol. 2.

""My Blue Heaven"" was produced toward the end of Grable's career at 20th Century-Fox and is just plain boring, perhaps because it lacks the sparkle of the star's earlier work.

If I was making the selections for Vol. 1 I would have chosen ""Springtime in the Rockies"" and ""Coney Island"" (an unofficial DVD of ""Coney Island"" is available if you look hard enough).

At a price of $50, this four-disc collection is not a bargain. By comparison, Vol. 1 of ""The Esther Williams Collection"" retails for the same price but contains five DVDs.

About eight years ago I scooped up a copy of all the Grable VHS videos in the Key Video collection. They will have to do until Fox gets around to releasing more of her films on DVD.

UPDATE: Since I first wrote this review I've bought ""Moon"" and ""Argentine,"" both of which have repaid me in enjoyment. If Vol. 2 is released, I assume that the films will also be released as separate DVDs. Again, I'd rather have the option of buying each film individually.

It's been more than four years since Vol. 1 was released. Whatever the reason for the delay in issuing a follow up -- poor sales or more urgent DVD releases -- the release of Vol. 2 would give Fox a chance to redeem itself for the lackluster selections in Vol. 1.",1274659200,2,2346,4.6201923076923075
2542626,3,B000EXDS7A,"This movie is has a star studded cast, but Batty Grable is just plain
blond chubby. They have color TV 8 years before Mary Martin

script, musical numbers and cast is just doomed to be
a second rate one. I enjoyed the movie anyway seeing it for the first time,

2542631,4,B000EXDS7A,"My Blue Heaven may not be the best musical I've ever seen; but it certainly is enjoyable. Despite the unpleasant subject matter of an auto accident resulting in a woman's not being able to have babies of her own anymore, the plot incredibly manages to come off as slightly fluffy, thoroughly entertaining and even amusing. The song and dance numbers are excellent. Look for a very young Mitzi Gaynor in her film debut as Gloria, a young hoofer who wants to get into big time show business really fast.

When the action starts, Kitty Moran (Betty Grable) gets the news from her doctor that she is going to have a baby; and her husband Jack (Dan Dailey) is thrilled just as she is. Kitty and Jack have been stars on the radio for years but they don't feel complete; they want a child of their own. They attend a party to celebrate the upcoming birth but after an auto accident Kitty can no longer have babies. At first they are crushed but when they learn that their close friends Walter and Janet Pringle (David Wayne and Jane Wyatt, respectively) adopted two of their own children, the Morans have reason to be hopeful again.

It isn't long before they cross paths with an adoption agency's cold, nasty and stuffy old woman head manager who cherishes her puritanical values; the older woman openly admits she does not like at all to place babies in the homes of actors. (I bet she could be sued for openly admitting that today.) The Morans are once again crushed but they so badly want a baby that they go through with a shady deal across the Hudson River in New Jersey to adopt a baby girl.

Of course, complications can arise from this scenario. Is their deal to get the baby from New Jersey legal? Can Kitty keep up her show business work with husband Jack and take care of a baby simultaneously? Yes, Kitty and Jack hire a nurse but she's so strict Kitty can hardly touch the child let alone feed it! How will their bosses at work react to all this? Will Gloria be able to nudge her way into their act to get Kitty bumped out of the show business act now that the Morans are on television instead of radio? No plot spoilers here, folks--just watch the movie and find out!

The DVD has an optional commentary with Drew Casper and there are a couple of trailers for other Betty Grable films.

Overall, My Blue Heaven is one of the better musicals from Twentieth Century Fox. It's not the best I've seen but then again I've got a personal, soft spot in my heart for those MGM musicals. I nevertheless recommend this film for fans of its stars; and people who like musicals will clearly want this for their collections.",1232064000,2,2619,4.45929018789144

2542635,5,B000EXDS7A,"This delightful set contains four of Betty Grable's colorful musicals. As more than one author has noted, Betty looked great in the Fox Technicolor Process. She had real appeal during the war years and her charms still entertain in this terrific set.  Down Argentine Way also features Don Ameche and shows off the wonderful chemistry he had with Betty. It also features a fine supporting cast and great settings and costumes. Moon Over Miami adds the always personable Bob Cummings and the vibrant Carole Landis to the mix but as always it is Grable who carries the film in several great dance numbers! The Dolly Sisters almost offers two Grables for the price of one since it co-stars June Haver who made a fine ""sister"" and astonishing look-a-like for Betty- right down to her own Million Dollar Legs! Amazing costumes add to the fun. John Payne is as reliable as ever. He was a consistently capable performer in musicals, action films, war movies, and Westerns. Finally, Dan Dailey brings his own dance skills to the warm and amusing musical My Blue Heaven. Warning- seeing these films will only lead you want more Betty!

Here we see her at her sassy, talented best from the breakthrough ingenue in ""Down Argentine Way"" to the more mature role in ""My Blue Heaven"".  And though this is the weakest of the four movies in this collection, just watch how she handles the dressing room scene where she walks in and finds Dan pashing Mitzi.  Instead of exploding, she is the epitome of cool.  She was cool in 1950 when nobody had coined the word.  The scene was well written,true, but she delivered it with great panache.  An underrated actress.  Just watch the facial expressions in every number - she's alive.  It's a pity her movie career wasn't extended and revitalised by the part of Adelaide in ""Guys and Dolls"".  I even fantasize that she should have played ""Sweet Sue"" in ""Some Like It Hot"" - Joan Shawlee even LOOKED like a beefed-up Betty.  Has this occurred to anyone else?  But to get back to the collection - great value.  A trip back to the carefree movie days when everyone looked fabulous, burst into song at the drop of a cliche, and had a happy ending.

She really grew from the sweet and talented young lady  to a sophisticated leading lady.  In all cases, when she is on teh screen, you can't take your eyes off of her.

2542651,4,B000EXDS7A,"MY BLUE HEAVEN takes a viewer back to the last days of radio and the first days of television. Betty Grable and Dan Dailey play Kitty and Jack Moran, a husband and wife song and dance team. We discover early in the story that Kitty is pregnant with their first child, but loses the baby after a car accident. Kitty learns she may never be able to have her own child and the couple accepts the possibility of being childless until they visit two friends and colleagues Walter and Janet Pringle (David Wayne and Jane Wyatt) who have adopted some of their bustling brood, Kitty and Jack decide to adopt. They have to face a number of obstacles including a snobbish adoption service director and a mother who decides to put her child up for adoption and then wants the child back. Since this is a 1950's musical, we know that the story will all work out better than anyone could expect but like all predictable Hollywood musicals, we may know how the story will end but we want to know what will happen to get to the happy ending.

Most of the musical numbers are interwoven in the radio and television numbers, so the story has a bit of a flow to it. There is a spoof of sorts on an ""operetta set in the South Pacific"" which in a buffoonish way bears a bit of a resemblance to another Twentieth Century musical. Mitzi Gaynor plays a young vamp named Gloria Adams who makes a move on Jack which Kitty takes rather well. Grable and Dailey are good partners in the film and there are some moments that make viewers feel sorry for the couple when they face setbacks.

I'm assuming that this DVD will appeal primarily to film buffs and Hollywood musical lovers.  It doesn't have too many special features: a collection of stills from the filming and trailers for DOWN ARGENTINE WAY and THE DOLLY SISTERS.  Still it's an enjoyable film and a good example of a 1950's musical.",1174003200,8,1866,4.447368421052632

2542659,5,B000EXDS7A,"I was a boy when I saw Betty Grable (on film) we had radio and we had Movies, when a Grable film was in town, it was a family outing, we knew that all Betty Grable films had one thing in common, they made your spirits sour, you never left one of her films without a warm happy feeling, and the production numbers were always a treat, glittering costumes, and songs that raced through your head for days after, and more often than not inspired you to sing songs, like Down Argentine Way, I Can't Begin to Tell You, and Im Always Chasing Rainbows, then there was Betty Grable her self, Beautiful, great smile, fine dancer (although seldom given the chance to really shine) and always the fantastic costumes, and all in Glorious Technicolor, although critics hated Technicolor because it exagerated the colors in an almost cartoonish manner, but audiences loved it, I did & still do too. which brings me to the DVD's, Down Argentine Way, and My Blue Heaven were Mastered by Delux Digital, and they did a very good job of it, the other two discs are just a little less well transferred from film, but not as bad as at least one review I read here, there is absolutely no film grain in any of these discs, the picture has depth (amazing for films this old) and the reds,yellows, blues, golds & silvers just pop out of the screen, one look at Carmen Miranda in her red skirt leaves ones jaw dropping, indeed all the colors in Down Argentine Way are just as bright and eye popping as I remember them from so long ago, are the transfers perfect then, NO they are not, dark scenes and shadows are not as detailed as they should be, some times the skin colors are off and look artificial (they looked that way on the screen, but the equipment they have today could have been used to correct it) but never on Grable herself, only flawless peaches and cream complexion and silvery blond hair, my only real complaint is the sound track on Moon over Miami, very much as if it were comming through a telephone, and the Dolly Sisters isn't much better, I know the studios did a better job with sound then you hear in any of these discs, however the other two are passable, I have these on Laser Disc as well, and the Audio is much better then the DVD's, don't understand why, but never the less these are fun films and well worth seeing over and over again, I can hardly wait for the next batch, and the one after that, hopefully Delux will do all of the future mastering, by the way the Ladies featured in the Dark Town Strutters Ball sequence, are not really black, that is dark makeup, my reviewing equipment consists of a 73711 (73"") Mitsubishi HI-DEF Monitor, Denon 5900 DVD player (with the latest factory upgrades), Denon 5803 7.1 channel receiver, and 7 Ess amt 1a floor standing speakers.",1156896000,11,2781,4.454901960784314
2542660,5,B000EXDS7A,"Thank you to Fox for releasing these fun-filled, lavish and colorful musicals. Even if you are not actually a Grable fan (I am not), you will find all these films wholly entertaining.

If you enjoy musicals and escapist fare, it's hard to to do better. Don't look for plots, just look for exceptional entertainment values. The Fox musicals may not have been the summum of art (like MGM's for instance), but at the time, they were even more popular and exemplified escapist fun more than any other films around. And they hold up wonderfully (for this 33 year old at any rate!)

DOWN ARGENTINE WAY (1940) is resplendant with Latin-flavored (reproduced) locales, flashy costumes, verve, romance and a remarkable cast. That was the film that made Grable a household name, it's the US debut of Brazilian bombshell Carmen Miranda (singing some of her biggest hits). The Nicholas Brothers do an amazing dance number and the songs are all very memorable and blend in it the festive atmosphere. Almost a paid vacation in great company :-)

MOON OVER MIAMI (1941) is perhaps one of the most entertaining of all Fox musicals. The serviceable storyline of fortune-hunters passing off as heiresses helped to produce three hits for the studio, a straight comedy in 1938, this musical in 1941 and another musical in 1946. Exteriors were actually shot on location and it adds a lot to the vacation feel of the film. Hummable songs, snappy dances, breezy fun, the personable and affable Bob Cummings and the beautiful Carole Landis all add to create a really amusing, tuneful musicomedy. Technicolor at its zenith.

THE DOLLY SISTERS (1945) Grable is paired with the lovely June Haver. The fanciful and fictional story built around the (actually brunette) sisters is a fabulous showcase for the two blondes and features some of Fox's imaginative (garish) production numbers. The best songs are those performed more simply by the girls and by John Payne. Fox always did great with this kind of nostalgic musicals and this one is a richly evocative example.

MY BLUE HEAVEN (1950) provided a change of pace role for Grable. Paired with one of her best screen partners, Dan Dailey, her character here is not the usual brassy, sassy kind - this musical is much more sentimental than any other she ever did and it works very well although it's been oddly neglected for years. Newcomer Mitzi Gaynor has some terrific moments too. Just a wonderful, warm-hearted movie.

All 4 films are so good that the set seems a must and to me, they are the best Grable ever starred in. Looking forward to seeing even more Fox musicals on DVD in the future!!!!!",1154131200,54,2623,4.84375
2542661,5,B000EXDS7A,This collection is Typical of most Hollywood musicals. The star struggling to make it to the top. These wonderful old flicks  were always lots of fun to watch.

2542662,1,B000EXDS7A,"I loved watching old Betty Grable movies with my grandmother on TV years ago. She loved them when she was young, and thought I would enjoy them, too. I was barely a toddler, and have fond memories of those viewings. So, I recently purchased the new batch of Grable DVDs hoping to re-experience those treasured memories.

BAD MOVE!

I should have waited for more GABLE instead of wasting money on GRABLE.

Betty Grable and Dan Dailey were performers of modest talents to say the least. They had a nice chemistry, and were surrounded by good production values, nice music, and what I assume originally was gorgeous Technicolor.

The DVD looks very bland and flat, and doesn't do the film's production values justice. Whether it was actually filmed in a bland way, or is just a grainy transfer with color breathing, I couldn't tell you. Fox musicals usually compensate their lack of substance with dazzling colors or terrific songs.

None of that is here. The DVD is drab looking, the songs in the film are mediocre, and the performances are downright tacky at times. I may have liked it at age 5 or 6, but MY BLUE HEAVEN is  hardly heavenly when viewing this ugly looking DVD which can't compensate for the drab screenplay, tired stars, and boring music.",1152662400,2,1252,4.720183486238532
2542663,2,B000EXDS7A,"20th Century-Fox may not have been as top-tier a studio as Paramount, MGM or WB, but they held their own, and certainly took advantage of the glories of Technicolor earlier than most.

Betty Grable, was a charming lass who had a lilting voice, could dance well (although not remarkably so), and who was one of the biggest stars of the 1940s.

Despite lavish production values, and in some cases, great scores, beautifully orchestrated, Fox musicals in general don't hold up well today, except to those who hold onto their nostalgic memories.

When I was a kid, I loved watching Grable's musicals on TV, and haven't seen most of them since then, so I had great hopes for this set. Sadly, the films are just eye and ear candy, with little substance, and Betty Grable just can't hold a candle to legends from a similar time like Garland or Doris Day, whose obvious talent oozes from even their lighter vehicles.

The best you can say about the films are the trappings, but the substance just isn't there. DOWN ARGENTINE WAY is rescued by The Nicholas Brothers and Carmen Miranda. MOON OVER MIAMI has a cute production number with Betty dancing with choreographer Hermes Pan, THE DOLLY SISTERS teams Betty with June Haver, and MY BLUE HEAVEN, a little bit more of an attempt at a more substantial scenario has affecting moments. There are great tunes in every picture, and hearing them sung with the wonderful Fox orchestra is always a pleasure.

However, the transfers on all these new releases are very grainy, and have a lot of color breathing going on. I've seen original theatrical nitrate prints of some of these at special showings at UCLA and the now-gone Vagabond Theater in L.A., and the DVD pale (literally) in comparison.

For Grable fans, I'm sure they will drool, but for those on the fence, look elsewhere for musical entertainment that stands the test of time. Fox's musicals of this era, just don't cut it (but by all means pick up THE GANG'S ALL HERE if they ever release it. It's a TERRIBLE film, but rescued by unbelievable imaginary creations from the mind of its director, Busby Berkeley, and also boasts the magnetic presence of Alice Faye, whose work has stood the test of time more than the sweet, but limited Ms. Grable.",1152230400,8,2242,4.721227621483376

Betty helped us through the darkest days of World War II...so

perhaps she can rekindle some of her magic now.  We certainly

do need it.  Anyway: FOUR wonderful films with Betty singing,

dancing and entertaining as only she can.  It has been a long

time coming...and the title Vol. I...well...I have ordered Vol. I

and I am already ready for Vol. II.  Betty's films are not like the films of today....everyone had to sidestep ""THE CODE""...NO

NAVELS....just like ""I Dream of Jeannie""!! But Betty was a

complete professional...and always come through.  I love all

the films in this collection.  ""The Dolly Sisters"" probably has

the most glitter...it also has an amazing sequence that is

politically incorrect and politically adventurous at the same time.  ""The Dark Town Strutters Ball"" has always fascinated me.

Fox uses a line of absolutely gorgeous black show girls to

model a series of black and white costumes...IN COLOR...and then adds Betty Grable and June Haver in black face.  It does look strange to us today.  I suspect it was ""on the edge"" back

in 1947.  Anyway....Betty will steal your heart away...she will sing you a song...and divert you with a figure and a pair of

legs that are still legendary.  Don't expect too much from the

plots...they are there because these are movies...today they

would probably be Variety Shows on TV...but they are lovely entertainment...and you will enjoy them.",1143158400,38,1482,5.012396694214876

8115278,3,B000EXDS7A,"This four film BG collection contains Moon over Miami,(released June/41),Down Argentine Way(released Oct/40),My Blue Heaven(released Dec/50) and The Dolly Sisters(released Nov/45).All four films are in glorious colour and generally crisp and clean,as opposed to the ""vault""series which goes under different names by different studios,and which are generally average to poor prints and are not worth the money to buy them.
First off is Moon over Miami. This is about two sisters(Grable and Carol Landis) and their Aunt( Charlotte Greenwood) who go down to Florida in search of a husband for Grable. Two male friends down there are Bob Cummings and Don Ameche. Grable falls for Ameche first,but when she finds out he's broke she reluctantly gives him up for Cummings. But Grable's sister loves Cummings,so in the end Grable goes back to Ameche and Cummings lands Landis, and all is happiness and roses. Jack Haley is also on hand to provide some much needed  laughs and inter play with Greenwood. This is a typical plot for the time and is alright fair for what it is. Typical escapism entertainment, and just what was called for during this period. 3 1/2 stars.
Secondly is Down Argentine Way. This finds Grable as a society gal who loves her horses. Ameche is from Argentina and he and his dad sail to New York to sell some. However his father has a grudge against Grable's father. So when Betty almost is set to buy one of their horses the cat comes out of the bag and Ameche refuses to sell. The two get close and when Ameche returns to Argentina,Grable follows. In the end Grable and Ameche get together as his father finally puts away the feud. This is not a film that hold up in the least. The plot is a plodding one, with almost nothing noteworthy about it. The only saving graces(only just) are Carmen Miranda's two brief appearances(and even she was filmed separately in New York-and you can tell there's a disconnect there), the Nikolas Brothers and Charlotte Greenwood. 2 1/2 stars.
My Blue Heaven stars Betty and Dan Dailey as a song and dance couple who have been stars on the radio and who eventually move their act into the growing medium of television. The plot has the couple wanting a baby. Betty loses one,they adopt one,she gets pregnant,then they adopt another. In the end it's all happiness and roses. Another terribly long and plodding plot. Grable isn't at her best in this one(she doesn't seem that interested), and Daily steals their scenes. They did four pics together and this is one of the worst they did. On hand are David Wayne and Jane Wyman who would go on to have careers in TV and a very young Mitzi Gaynor also appears. 2 1/2 stars.
Finally The Dolly Sisters,with June Haver and Grable playing the titular roles. Grable ends up falling big for John Payne,whom she later marries. However Payne goes off to war(WW1) and when it ends the two cannot get back together fast enough,due to commitments on the sister's parts,and Payne and Grable divorce. Grable ends up in a car accident ,but eventually returns to the New York stage for a benefit with her sister. In the end,while still divorced, Payne and the two sisters reunite on stage in the final number,and it looks like there might be hope for the future for the pair.
This film was the one I was least expecting to like and it turned out to be the best of all of them. I have seen very few pictures with Payne I didn't like,and this is no exception. He sings here, and always had a pleasing voice. Also on hand was one of my favourite character actors of all time S.Z.Sakall. This film is also elevated by the wonderful musical score which gets you singing along to some old classic hits like""Always Chasing Rainbows"" and""I Can't Begin to Tell You"".I liked it and it gets 4 solid stars.
All in all not some of Grable's better films. The best to me is The Dolly Sisters,followed by ""Miami"" and all the way down to ""Argentine"" and ""Heaven"".If you are a Grable compleatist, then there is no stopping your purchase. But for those who are a little more discerning,I would buy The Dolly Sisters on its own and forgo this rather costly set. By the way,some of these films not only come with explanatory inserts, but small repro lobby cards.",1507852800,,4220,4.6644295302013425
