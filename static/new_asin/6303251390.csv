612073,5,6303251390,"I would highly recommend the Ultimate DVD collection.  I found Yoga Zone while living in Hungary for a year.  A british entertainment channel would air a 20 minute Yoga Zone segment at 6am, Noon, and 6pm.  I got into the habit of doing Yoga Zone at least once a day and the benefits were noticable after only a couple of weeks.  I was more flexible and felt better all around.  The way Yoga Zone enhances your knowledge of your own breath and how your breath relates to your body will help you in any situation.  (They eventually dubbed the segments into Hungarian and I didn't enjoy them as much when I couldn't hear the instructors talking me through the session)

I also purchased another Yoga Zone 3-pack that includes 3-1 hour sessions.  I am currently doing other types of exercise that equals 1-hour to 2-hours per day and I found the 1-hour sessions difficult to fit in.  The 20-minute sessions get you going and still have a noticeable impact on flexibility and also provide the ability to progress into more difficult postures.

I am excited to have finally found the 20-minute sessions and almost anybody can find 20-minutes to clear your mind and rejuvinate your body.",1107734400,69,1180,4.684466019417476
612074,5,6303251390,I found yogazone via satellite TV 3 years ago. Sadly it was taken off air about a year later and I only had one tape of off air recordings. When that broke a few months ago I tried various other yoga videos but none compared to yogazone. When I found the ultimate DVD collection I was so happy! The DVDs are exactly like the original programme and are excellent for both beginners and more experienced people. The programmes are easy to follow and I always feel I've had a complete workout after them. The programmes are each 20 minutes in length (two programmes per disk) so it's great to fit into a busy day. This is in contrast to most yoga videos which just have one hour or so long workout. I would recommend it to anyone who is thinking about taking up yoga as well as those looking to improve the skills they have already learnt.,1105142400,42,836,4.3312101910828025
612075,4,6303251390,"While perusing the bargain videos I came across a rather well-done parody of Start Trek.  The video is called Star Wrek Zone, The Unauthorized Parody.
This film uses figures with claymation features.  Thus Captain Pickacard's crew finds themselves dropped through a wormhole where they encounter the original Enterprise and its crew.  The characters are very aptly parodied in voice, look and character.
If you are a fan of Star Trek and/or Star Trek parodies, I recommend that you try and see this short film.
The only fault with this film is its length.  It is a little short (hey! Claymation is hard!) but many parodies lose their effect when they try to go too long so I won't complain.",1085702400,2,690,4.773109243697479
612076,5,6303251390,"I began yoga about a year ago.  I bought this set about 2 months ago and still absolutely love it.  There are a wide variety of types of exercises, from stretching to fat burning, all at the beginner level.  Most of the DVDs have 2 - 20 min sessions, so you can mix and match.  Their instruction is well done; you can look at the screen to see what you should look like, but listen to understand all the fine details.  They really emphasize the breath, telling you when to exhale and inhale, which is something I find lacking in many other yoga videos.  If you are not sure you need so many yoga DVDS, I recommend starting with the YogaZone Intro to Power Yoga, the second session is great.",1074297600,91,690,4.269230769230769
612077,5,6303251390,"I love this collection.  First, Yoga Zone tapes are my favorite.  They explain the poses, what you should be focusing on, what you should be feeling, how to breathe, and how to make each pose harder/ easier depending on your level.  All these sessions are suitable for beginners, and there's a great selection: flexibility, stress relief, yoga for abs, total body conditioning, intro to power yoga, and yoga for weight loss. Each DVD has two sessions.  If you want to stretch, tone, relax, or move, there's a session in this collection for it.  Plus, the variety keeps it interesting.  If you're just starting yoga, buy/rent a Yoga Zone tape to see if you like it, and if you're going to stick with it, get this collection!",1045526400,179,723,4.698412698412699
612078,4,6303251390,"Clamation master Milko Davis creates this outstanding parody of both ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Trek: The Next Generation."" While it's a little too short, it is nontheless a comedic gem. The claymation leaves much to be desired, but the art itself is difficult anyway, so what can I say? ""Star Wrek Zone"" is plenty fun.",1032480000,2,314,4.7272727272727275

612161,5,6303251390,I did Yoga Zone exercise daily when there were regular programs on TV.  These DVDs have the same clear instruction as well a adaptations for the movement shown by a second instructor.  The set includes a great variety of sessions in beautiful surroundings.

I expected it to be more modern however, it is the excact same ( from 1990's ?) . But otherwise it does just what it says..easy to follow and unles you are a Yogi it can be as strenuous as you are willing to make it. That being said a knowledge of basic yoga prinicples would be very helpful.",1400457600,,445,3.847826086956522
612163,4,6303251390,"Yoga Zone is what I started out with many years ago and you cannot go wrong with the lovely, caring and kind instructors that are on all their DVDs.  They are done outside by the beach and always have soft music which I prefer to not having any music.  The instructors talk to you like they are your friend and not like a machine.  This set includes Evening Stress Release, Fat-Burning, Intro to Power Yoga, Stretching for  Flexibility, Total Body Conditioning and Yoga for Abs, each with two twenty minute workouts. My two criticisms of most of Yoga Zone would be #1 the workouts are too short (20 minutes, tops) and #2 they could include a greater variety of poses and harder poses.  That being said I will be buying all of Yoga Zone's DVD's because their strengths (above) are worth it.  After all you can always hold a poses longer or go deeper into the pose, whatever.
Namaste.",1396828800,,882,4.515723270440252
612164,5,6303251390,"I bought this set because I wanted to start getting more into yoga, and I love it! The six DVDs give a nice variety, some are a bit more challenging than others, but they all deliver a nice, smooth workout that I think is easy enough for a beginner to follow. I like some of the instructors more than others, and I do find one or two of them flat out annoying, but on the whole I think this is a very good set to add to your collection if you're just starting out. I like that there's a wide variety of workouts, and I also love that there are two workouts per DVD, so you've got enough material here to do a different 20 minute workout a day for twelve days. I'm young and in fairly good shape, so I never really struggled with many of the poses, but it may be more of a challenge if you struggle with flexibility or are overweight. It isn't hard on your joints, though.",1394755200,,871,4.069767441860465

612167,5,6303251390,"Alan Finger will never fail to teach you, at any level, to properly learn and enjoy yoga from the very beginning thru all the other steps you will reach.  His instruction and cueing is so excellent you very soon realize you don't have to keep looking up or across or sideways at your tv/monitor screen. He knows how to teach, and he always has. Don't be put-off by the dates of his DVDS, as they are well-produced and timeless, even down to what the participants are wearing. Alan Finger is THE reason I have stuck with yoga for 20 years, and I have the body, the balance, the poise and the fitness level to show for it. Judge every other brand and yoga instructor you use by what Alan Finger teaches you, especially regarding breathing, which is most important.",1386547200,3,762,4.482014388489208

I love how every workout is broken down into 20 minute segments with clear instructions. These are good routines for yoga enthusiast at all levels. Yoga is just one of those things that is good to incorporate into your life. At just 20 minutes a day you reap huge rewards. I would suggest this for anyone.,1343347200,2,469,4.222222222222222

612276,5,6303251390,I have used these videos in VSH format for some time until they just didn't work anymore. I was very happy to find that I could still purchase this set in DVDs because I was afraid they might not be available anymore.  I enjoy the Yoga Zone collection because I get the results I need in a short period of time. Just 20 minutes per session gives me the reason to continue using them.  I also like the fact that the instructors are very explicit about the positions and breathing techniques.,1287360000,3,490,4.373626373626373
612277,5,6303251390,"Yoga Zone series is amazing and I would recommend it to everyone. I have been following this series for almost 6 years now and it helped me lose weight and maintain it.

The instructors are knowledgeable and  take you through the workout without no nonsense approach.
People with absolutely none or limited knowledge of yoga can benefit  immensely through this series.
 I tried other yoga series and what I love most about Yoga Zone is no matter what your level you can still do it without problem.

 If you don't have lot of time like me and want something to start your day in comfort of your home this is the one.

Worth every penny. I eventually want to buy every DVD in the Yoga Zone series.",1287014400,2,696,4.433070866141732

I have been looking for a way to sneak in some more yoga on non strength training days so I would be less sore and more flexible. This fits the bill.

Workouts: There is a great variety of yoga practices - 2 on each DVD that focus on different goals. I would say they are good for the beginner or maybe intermediate.

Setting: The DVD is set on a beautiful beach in Jamaica.

Music: Appropriate for yoga.

Crew: There are 2 people in each section. One person is explaining the pose and doing a modified or simpler pose, while the other person is demonstrating a more advanced version of the pose.

Equipment Needed: You just need a mat (if you have hard floors) and a little space in front of your TV.

Instructors: The instructors talk way too much for me, but they are trying to explain the proper form, which may be good for some one with no yoga experience. There are options on the DVDs to hear the instructors plus music or the music only, which I thought was a good idea.",1265932800,7,1107,4.19811320754717

First - the instructors are all pleasant, nice looking ut not super-human, not overly perky or annoying (Denise Austen, anyone?) but just normal people that seem like you would like them in real life.  (Tidbit that I stumbled upon later:  Charles and Lisa end up getting married!)

Second - the setting is gorgeous - various areas on the beach at the Grand Lido Resort in Jamaica.  I never get tired of looking at it, plus I enjoy the random chicken or whatever that occasionally wanders past in the background.

Third - and most important - the videos are fun!  There are six of them, and all of them have two twenty-minute sessions, so that's twelve different workouts to choose from.  I can honestly say I've never in my life stuck to anything like I have with these, because they're enjoyable, they're short, and when I'm done, I feel great.  They are just challenging enough that I feel like I accomplished something good for my body, but not so strenuous that I felt like giving up at any point.

I think these would be good for any fitness level, as a supplement to other things that you do if you're VERY fit; and also good for someone who is just beginning to exercise and wants something they can stick with.",1243814400,5,1252,4.549107142857143

This set is what I think a beginner's yoga DVD should be like - not too easy, not too difficult.  The instructors are friendly.  I was thankful that while the instructors talked about the benefits of yoga, they did not go into ""deep philosophical soliloquys"". The practices are 20-min. long and are themed, which allow the viewer to do short practices (if they don't have the time or are too tired) or to do longer practices, as he/she wishes.  When I bought this, I was training for my first marathon - the 20-min. sequences were perfect stretching programs after my runs.

You can fit it into your daily routine, or if you have more time, do a whole DVD. There is plenty of variety, so you don't get bored. This is a wonderful deal!

612373,5,6303251390,"I absolutely love all of the YogaZone DVD's I have tried so far, and I have not been disappointed with the Ultimate Collection. The Fat Burning DVD is by far my favorite and the closest to an aerobic workout. The others all leave me feeling refreshed and relaxed.",1177545600,2,263,4.5
612374,3,6303251390,"I read through all the reviews before I ordered this set.

After viewing several of the DVD sessions, I am somewhat puzzled about the excellent reviews.

OK, good visuals don't equal good yoga.  But honestly for those who are beginning, it helps.  The instructors are very likable and easy going, but they look like ""the guy next door in his old t-shirt doing yoga.""  I do think they could have and should do a little more on the visual presentation.

The instruction is not bad at all, although the workouts do seem short and hurried sometimes (not same as fast-paced).

I will give them another try in the future, but for now, I am not impressed.",1176854400,5,648,4.5344827586206895
612375,5,6303251390,"This is a very practical approach to yoga and exercise for people of all levels. The exercises are broken into separate 15-minute routines that are easy to follow. In the 6-disc collection there is a great range for varying levels and needs (burning fat, relaxing, stretching, etc) and the variety keeps things interesting. We use the discs at least 3 times a week; it's convenient, takes little space to do in front of the TV and you can do a 15-minute routine when that's all you have time for or continue on when you have the time and motivation. We really enjoy this and have never taken yoga classes before which goes to show that it is very accessible to all levels.",1174780800,2,672,4.516393442622951
612376,5,6303251390,"Anything from Yoga Zone is truly THE Ultimate!  It was a great loss when it was taken from the lineup of our local cable company. The collection is spectacular for ANY level. It would still be nice to have the show for some versatility, but since the show left the air, this collection has given me back my vitality for living life! 5 Stars to Amazon as well, my 1st experience, & a very pleasant one!",1169078400,3,401,4.276315789473684
612377,5,6303251390,"I've tried to take up yoga several times using other instructional videos, and either fell over during an advanced pose and gave up in disgust, found the instructions difficult to follow and gave up in disgust, or was subjected to some fruity, ""you are one with the earth"" nature talk... and gave up in disgust. But the Yoga Zone videos are none of that. The poses are easy to do, especially since the instructors encourage you to only do as much as your body will allow, and to not strive to do it perfectly or even as well as the instructor. Even though the poses are accessible, the workout is challenging, and you walk away feeling like you've done something to strengthen and tone your body without beating it up. A lot of time is devoted to making sure you understand how to do the poses correctly and what each movement is meant to accomplish, but that doesn't slow down the pace of the instruction. The instructors are pleasant to listen to, but if you feel like you have the routine down pat, the DVD menu will allow you to turn off their talking and just listen to some soothing background music while practicing. I would recommened Yoga Zone to those who think they can't do yoga, think they won't like it, or tried it before and walked away frustrated.",1165968000,13,1264,4.5

612421,5,6303251390,"As the title of my review suggests, this set is excellent for beginners.  The Amazon description should make it more apparent that these are at a beginner to advanced beginner level.  The stretching and fat burning DVDs say ""beginner to intermediate,"" but the rest all say ""for beginners.""  If you don't consider yourself a beginner, don't bother.  If you are a beginner, buy this set now!  The poses are not particularly challenging, and the instructors' soothing voices guide you through without making you feel like an idiot for not being able to touch your toes.  I particularly like the flexibility and abs DVDs.

I like the fact that these are short workouts (2 18-minute sessions on each DVD), because it's less intimidating to me.  It's also easier to work into my busy schedule.  Also, the DVDs are enjoyable to watch, as they were shot in Jamaica.  I'm not saying you should buy the set for the background, but it's a bonus.

I do have to say that the power yoga DVD is a little too introductory.  It's valuable as an explanation/teaching tool, to give you an idea of what power yoga is, but don't expect it to be a major workout.  If you're looking to ""feel the burn,"" the fat burning yoga DVD is GREAT.

This was my first yoga DVD set, and it has served me well.  It has great variety, so you won't get bored.  Really, you can't go wrong with any Yoga Zone DVD.",1152748800,20,1373,4.497975708502024
612422,3,6303251390,"This set has its own virtues. Unfortunately they were not the qualities I was seeking, but I'm sure they are for plenty of others. Each DVD pretty much follows the same format: one 20-minute season followed by a second of the same type and intensity. A complete yoga workout in 25 minutes has its audiences: the format is ideal for anyone with limits on their time/ patience/ fitness. It works pretty well with kids.

I feel deceived that this set doesn't disclose itself as beginner-oriented, however. The flexibility DVD posed some new challenges, but in general the practices are not real ambitious.  The entire set has the teacher speaking from within the video- not dubbed in- and this can be irritating, as well.",1151625600,13,718,4.829268292682927
612423,5,6303251390,"I love these DVD's. 20 minutes is just the right amount of yoga for me, and these are so good.  The instructors don't chat too much, just a little in the beginning of each program.  The only one I don't like is the first abs program;  11 of 12 is pretty darn good.  The power yoga and fat burning are tough workouts and the rest are more relaxing, but thorough. Something for every mood. Just enough before bed to help me sleep.  Excellent value.",1142899200,14,446,4.261904761904762
612424,5,6303251390,"I really enjoy these videos.  The teachers are personable and not intimidating.  The pace is a little slower than some, but I find it very doable, even when I don't really feel like exercising.  The variety in this collection is great.  I've taken classes in yoga for a year, but found that I really needed to do something daily, not just once a week, and this set is perfect for just that.",1141776000,5,390,4.375
612425,5,6303251390,I've used all 12 20-min practices and find that the variety and level of difficulty (intermediate-modifiable to beginner and possibly challenging)is just what I'm looking for in a daily yoga routine.  The DVDs are great for a quick morning practice when I don't have much time.  I highly recommend this Yoga Zone Collection.,1140912000,11,324,5.09433962264151
612426,5,6303251390,"After reading such positive reviews of this collection, I decided to purchase them.  I suffer from fibromyalgia and have soft tissue damage in my neck.  For many years I have been going to a massage therapist and spending $30 a week to find relief from my symptoms.  My doctor recommended that I try Yoga or Tai Chi.  I opted for the Yoga.  Getting to a local yoga class was difficult given my schedule.  Being able to do it at home makes my life much easier.  In the short time I have been doing these DVD's the symptoms of my fibromyalgia have decreased.  I am more flexible and relaxed than I have ever been in my life.  I believe I am becoming addicted to Yoga!  But is it a good addiction!  I recommend this highly to anyone who wants to implement Yoga into their lifestyle.  It is simple to follow and you will notice a difference in yourself after the first session. So go for it and enjoy!",1139011200,12,897,4.3053892215568865

I have only been practicing yoga a few months and admittedly, there are some 'power yoga' tapes out there that I simply cannot do. With this collection, though, you get 12 different workouts, two on each tape. I highly recommend this collection.",1131926400,19,477,4.623529411764705

It works for you if you've never tried yoga before and it's great for the more experienced among us as well. I like the fact that you learn about the holistic benefits of each posture as you go along.

I used to tune in to the Yoga Zone programmes when they aired on Fox Health network and decided that they were so helpful to me, I should get my own set!

Each session is 20 minutes long and the benefits of such a short session are tremendous! Who could not have time for a 20 minute class right at home?

I highly recommend this package for anyone who wants to de-stress and become happier,  healthier, stronger and more flexible all at once.",1127260800,25,726,4.3161764705882355
