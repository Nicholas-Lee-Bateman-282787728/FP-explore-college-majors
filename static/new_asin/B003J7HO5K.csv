4129224,2,B003J7HO5K,"Apparently the lead actor in this movie is famous in Australia or something, but I've never heard of him before this. It seems like the other reviews are written by young girls who like him.

The storyline seems a little old at this point, the actor doesn't come off as much of a ""victim"" considering that he did sleep with the girl. Which also brings up the point of *how* exactly did he sleep with her?

Cliche scenes that have been done many times before, not scary.",1317600000,2,469,4.379310344827586

4129226,5,B003J7HO5K,"I like the fatal attraction type of films and Crush is definitely one of these but what a twist!  Starts slow but really builds towards the end.  Loved the music - rock style.

4129262,2,B003J7HO5K,"There are a number of movies with the title CRUSH.  This is not one of them that needs to be seen, unless you are female and have a ""crush"" for Chris Egan (KINGS, LETTERS TO JULIET, & DOMINION). What begins as an ordinary college story on a college campus where our ""hero"" Julian (played by CE) is an exchange student on a scholarship as an architecture major with a notable martial arts background (remember this latter point well) rapidly turns into something else.  Given the opportunity to house sit for pay in an opulent dwelling, he shortly discovers that an attractive and seductive young lady named Anna (a supposed niece of the family who owns the house) has her own set of keys to it and comes and goes as she pleases. Soon the inevitable becomes the inevitable and CE makes ""love"" to Anna (I just love that euphemism) despite the fact that he already has a most attractive girlfriend to whom he is seriously attached. She even visits him where he is house sitting.  Strange things suddenly begin to happen; and before you can say ""uh oh"" domestic bliss starts to unravel. Jealously, anger, betrayal, and craziness all rear their ugly head. At this juncture, our film takes a sharp turn with a stunning and inexplicable revelation (no ""Spoilers"" here). Julian is now faced with ""a living hell"" (to quote the DVD case) and must rely upon his own physical skills and the help of his friends to survive an unexpected ordeal. We have now run the emotional gamut from curiosity to infatuation to crush to stalking to rage to life threatening. CRUSH has become a ""horror"" movie which is really more ""horrible"" or ""horrific"" than anything else!  And, in the end, we and the film's various characters are left in a state of shared confusion as the picture fades to black.",1431820800,4,1773,4.654952076677317

4129266,3,B003J7HO5K,Quality is great. Movie content is okay...  Prompt delivery-- it was digital. Smooth transaction. Recommended dealer. I hope to continue our business relation in the future. Trustworthy.,1367712000,,186,5.888888888888889
4129267,2,B003J7HO5K,"The description of the movie sounded like it would be interesting, but after watching it, I was seriously disappointed. Most of the movie moves very slowly, but then the end is very abrupt. It would have been much better if there was more of a build up throughout the movie, and also if the ending would have gone on a little longer. The way it is presented is like they ran out of money and had to cut it where they did and left it incomplete. I may not have felt that way if they would have explained things a little better, but this film was very poorly constructed.",1362009600,,569,4.229357798165138
4129268,1,B003J7HO5K,THIS MOVIE WAS A REAL WASTE OF TIME. IT HAD A REALYY BAD ENDING AND THE LEAD ACTOR DIDN'T SEEM TO ME LIKE A TRUE HORROR VICTIM. NOW CRUSH (1994) WAS A REAL LOVE ROLLER COASTER. THIS MOVIE SUCHED HARD AND IT HAD SOME OF THE MOST ILL FITED CAST MEMBERS ON THE PLANET. MAIN POINT THIS MOVIE HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1340064000,,342,4.196969696969697

8397856,4,B003J7HO5K,"At first I expected a B Movie , but I must admit it kept me entertained . The story wasn't bad and the acting was decent. The woman who plays the niece is very easy on the eyes , which also makes the movie that much better  I recommend seeing this film at least once",1495324800,,266,3.8363636363636364
8397857,1,B003J7HO5K,"HORROR STORY misrepresented as relating to ""supernatural powers"".  Yet more obtuse Wholly Weird misrepresenting of spirits of decedents as visible personae with physical presence.  Ptui!",1469318400,,186,6.4
