2791607,4,B000O76TT0,"For what the big studios would spend on dry cleaning for a picture, Archibald Gips has delivered a slightly crass but sweet comedy that speaks some essential truths about dating and relationships.  Production values are excellent and the performances are solid. A far superior film to supposed king of recent romantic comedies, ""Sleepless in Seattle"" (a movie that was insulting to both Seattle and sleeplessness).",1185580800,3,414,5.369230769230769
2791608,4,B000O76TT0,"If you don't have any brains whatsoever, this film might not be for you.  However, if you enjoy and appreciate intelligent comedies, you'll dig ""Loveless.""  This film is unique in the sense that Dave, the lead, is a self-proclaimed womanizing a-hole.  He actually is somewhat of an anti-hero.  It's a joy to watch his transformation as Kelly, his college crush that broke his heart, attempts to transform him back into a gentleman.  The film is not an Oscar winner, but provides it's audience with countless memorable moments, and a conclusion that is both original and fulfilling.  Creator Archie Gips is a true auteur, and has created characters that are fun and relatable.  The direction had just the right touch, and worked extremely well with the tone of this film.",1182211200,3,770,4.922480620155039
2791609,5,B000O76TT0,"This is a very funny, topical movie about today's dating scene.  I guess you could say it tries to do for the current time what Swingers did for the 1990s.

Like Swingers, it features a charismatic womanizer who ends up being a bit of a softie when he meets the right woman (the beautiful Brittany Daniels).

This movie makes great use of lots of real L.A. locations, and has a very warm, glossy look to it.  The humor ranges from subtle to 'Something about Mary' style slapstick the acting is strong overall.  Also, a lot of the biggest laughs come from the the supporting actors, which is a pleasant surprise.

The movie also has  a lot of interesting insider information about the insane world of 'reality' television.

I'd definitely recommend this film for fans of romantic and dating comedies.  Think Wedding Crashers, American Wedding, etc, but with more more topical references.",1181865600,6,886,4.814569536423841
2791610,5,B000O76TT0,"I was able to view this film prior to it's release.  It is much better than your average romantic comedy and it's got it all:  romance for the gals and lots of laughs for the guys and an ending that satisfies.  This film is direct to DVD but is better than most of the stuff that's making it into theaters.  If you want to have some laughs and watch an entertaining film then, by all means, get this movie.  I've already ordered a copy for my library.",1180310400,7,451,4.137931034482759
2791611,5,B000O76TT0,"Anyone who's experienced the L.A. dating scene will recognize the people in this puckish satire of contemporary sexual morays.  Archie Gips, the writer/director of ""Loveless,"" used to produce for ""Blind Date,"" so he knows from dating humor!  Highly recommended.",1180137600,4,261,5.666666666666667

2791613,5,B000O76TT0,"I saw this movie at a preview screening and was very impressed. The script is way better than most romantic comedies with ""big name stars"" out there. The story moves along well and the laughs keep on coming. You can definitely learn a thing or two about how guys think from watching this. Personally my favorite thing was Stephen Tobolowsky (""Single White Female"") as the pretentious boss constantly trying to impress with his (made-up) vocabulary.",1179878400,4,448,4.986666666666666
2791614,5,B000O76TT0,"Archie Gips is breaking through as a huge comedy writer? Really? Ladies and gentlemen... This movie was awesome. it was an honest and intelligent view of the los angeles dating scene, as a chess game... or asteriods?

the acting was great. dash is dreamy. brittney is delightful, and the pacing was perfect.",1179792000,5,307,4.903846153846154

2791616,4,B000O76TT0,"I saw this picture before it was color corrected and before they'd laid a permanent sound track and it still had me rolling.  I'd recommend it to anyone.  Honestly, it's better than most of the romantic comedies I've seen in the last two years.  The writing, in particular, was way smarter than a lot of what's being made nowadays.  Very clever.  Very romantic.",1179619200,7,361,4.666666666666667

I Love it - it's stupid, funny, & you get to see a lot of faces before they were getting paid.
I think some of the folks actually were on those dating & reality shows, i.e. Melanie Specht.
I could be wrong - but some of these folks did end up on hit tv shows - spot the face name the show.",1511308800,,353,3.5974025974025974

What wasn't plausible was the seven years after being thrown away love affair between the lead characters.
