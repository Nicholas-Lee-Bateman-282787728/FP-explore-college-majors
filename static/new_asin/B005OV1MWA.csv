4855105,1,B005OV1MWA,"Despite compelling acting (notice the word 'acting' instead of 'dancing') from the artists, there's not much to like in this dreary pantomime masquerading as a ballet. I can see why, due to the homosexuality theme, it may be hyped in certain circles. Not in our home.",1324598400,8,267,4.826086956521739
4855106,1,B005OV1MWA,This is a DVD of the ballet??  Mermaid has a LOT missing. I bought this DVD because I like the music of Lera Auerbach and ballet.  I will probably never get the chance to see it live.  A previous reviewer liked it a lot but she got to see the real thing and I am sure it would bring back fond memories.  I thought I would get DVD of a ballet when I ordered this thing.  I got a DVD which was shot while the ballet was going on but rarely got to see all on stage because the photographer decided that we wanted continuous close-ups usually of the  faces - mainly that of the mermaid  and her pathetic expression to understand that she had a problem.  I can see this for short times but not for most of the DVD.  A part of the time time the dancers had no feet or legs!!  (and I am not talking about when the mermaid was supposed to have a tail which was cleverly done)  The photographer did not understand that dancing and the enjoyment of dancing requires filming the entire body of the dancer - not just the face.  It also requires you to show the entire stage and supporting dancers.  If you want a movie ok if you want a ballet DVD go elsewhere . Overall one star.  Dancing excellent but DVD highly annoying to watch.  I am sure this is a lovely ballet it is just horribly annoying to see legless and footless dancers and so much emphasis on closeups of faces NOT the dancing.,1322870400,31,1379,4.131578947368421
4855110,5,B005OV1MWA,"A very good production of this ballet that deserves many viewings to do it justice. As is typical of Neumeier,the drama is just as important as the ballet and the direction of the filming focusses on people's expressions when required by the choreographer. Imaginative set that easily transforms the land into water and vice versa. Brilliant dancing and acting skills shown by the dancers, particularly Yuan Yuan Tan who since buying this DVD I have able to see her dancing twice in London.",1393200000,,490,4.9156626506024095

4855112,5,B005OV1MWA,"Commissioned for the bicentennial of writer Hans Christian Anderson, the familiar tale of love and sacrifice is given a20th Century look  while retaining all its original  tragic elements.  This Little Mermaid has nothing to do with Disney!  There are no cute & sassy sidekicks here; no happy ending.  Ballerina Yuan Yuan Tan of the San Francisco Ballet may be the greatest actress in dance today. Conveying the torment of the Mermaid's attempted transformation into a human with her expressive face & body  is both harrowing and mezmerising to watch.  Her futile attempts  to win the man she loves, the sacrifices she is forced to make, the humiliations she undergoes  are piled on as human love is celebrated all around her.  An outcast both above & below the sea, this fragile creature is fated to live in isolation, cut off from everything & everyone she's ever loved.  Choreography & costumes by John Neuneier are top notch.  The music may not be to your taste, however.",1362960000,5,975,4.878048780487805
4855113,2,B005OV1MWA,"The dancing was fabulous but that is all I can recommend. I found the story very hard to follow. The music left me cold. The sets and costumes were clever.
I watched this when it was on PBS. I am very glad i did not spend the money on a DVD. I made myself watch to the end but i have no desire to see it again.",1332288000,4,310,3.6417910447761193
4855114,3,B005OV1MWA,"Although the dancing is wonderful, the storytelling of this famous fairy tale leaves much to be desired. In the first act, set onboard a ship, The Poet mourns the loss of his friend, who is getting married, not dying. The Poet falls overboard from the ship into a sea of memories. The Little Mermaid becomes the embodiment of his love for The Friend. Meanwhile, onboard another ship, The Prince hits a golf ball overboard and dives in after it. A storm ensues and The Little Mermaid rescues him. The Poet recognizes his friend in the character of The Prince. The Grandmother agrees to give The Little Mermaid legs, so she can pursue The Prince, but in the end, The Prince marries The Princess and no one lives happily ever after.

It took a full reading of the liner notes and several viewings to figure out the plot. The dancing is the only reason to watch this video. Such a shame John Neumeier chose to weight the story with Hans Christen Anderson's rumored homosexual desires, instead of focusing on the love of The Little Meraid for The Prince. The music by Lera Auerbach is full of melancholy and tends toward the angsty, not anything you would want to listen to without the dancing.",1326499200,8,1189,4.6084905660377355
4855115,5,B005OV1MWA,"Have seen twice on video and each time enjoy more.  I agree you don't get to see what might be out of the camera range but you do get to see there faces and movements up close.  I always sit in the front row with binoculars when I see live.  Bad experience with eye surgery.  But come on the costumes the dancing the acting the set the music, FABULOUS.  Video just makes me wish I had gone to see it front row and melted in my seat.",1326412800,3,432,3.9195402298850577
4855116,5,B005OV1MWA,"I quite agree with the previous positive reviews, and I am happy I watched the disc before I read the one-star review.  Watching it, I had no slightest idea or impression that it was poorly photographed.  More of that, once or twice I thought that a close-up is needed when it was not provided.  Yuan Yuan Tan, who dances the main character, is a great tragic actress - I may think she would do well in a drama theater as well, and she definitely deserves frequent close-ups.  Of course, seeing the ballet in the theater is a completely different experience but I cannot imagine the better quality of filming.

The entire piece is a feast of taste without one false movement or sound.  It is one of the peaks of the culture of our days.  A must to see.

Today we watched the 2nd disc with interviews of most of the participants, and then started to watch the ballet the 2nd time, aleady having in mind that one of the viewers called it poorely photographed.  It is a masterpiece, a work of genius in all respects, and it is photographed exceptionally professionally.

The set that we are watching now was loaned us by a friend, but we are ordering two - one for ourselves and one to gift to somebody - from Amazon.",1325980800,6,1214,4.403587443946188
4855117,4,B005OV1MWA,"I saw two productions of Little Mermaid with both Yuan Yuan Tan and Sarah Van Patten as The Little Mermaid.  In a sense, this DVD is a better way to see the production than an actual staging, because it allows the viewer to do some necessary editing.  My overall comment would be that this ballet has one hour of inspired choreography and stage design in two hours of ballet.  The DVD allows the viewer to skip the tedium and focus on the brilliance.  It also allows the viewer to see the wonderful acting talent of the dancers better than from any seat in the house.

As with any filming of a theater piece, the viewer is at the mercy of the artistic choices of the photographer, who may not choose to capture the subject of greatest interest to a person in the audience.  I think the Video Director has struck a reasonable compromise between focusing on individual dancers and the greater ensemble.  Part of the problem for him no doubt was that the lighting was often quite dark, especially in the under water scenes, even as viewed in the audience.

The real stars in this production are the dancers of the San Francisco Ballet, who are uniformly excellent.  The Video Director necessarily focuses on the principals, but all the dancers contributed.  The dancing of the Magic Shadows and the Sea Witch in the Transformation scene alone would justify this DVD.",1325980800,12,1363,4.641666666666667
4855118,5,B005OV1MWA,"The Little Mermaid, a tribute to the legendary author Hans Christian Andersen, choreographed and designed by John Neumeier, with music by Lera Auerbach, is truly a work of genius. The San Francisco Ballet brings the work incredible life, though the corps de ballet is at times somewhat sloppy. Yuan Yuan Tan and Llyod Riggins stand out in this masterpiece of theater.
Intertwined with Andersen's own life, the emotional depth and complexity is perfectly portrayed by both the little mermaid and the poet. The choreography is a work of art. There is simply no gesture that is excess, and the piece displays a different kind of mime (as compared to classical ballet), a more realistic mime. The music is genius, with the incorporation of an instrument known as theramin.

As for the quality of the DVD, the ballet is filmed in stunning high definition, and the shots are very appropriate to the ballet. Having seen it live (by the San Francisco Ballet, as well), I must say that the shots enhance the experience of The Little Mermaid. There is a second DVD, with bonus features, including a behind-the-scenes looking at The Little Mermaid, were the process behind this work is described, as well as the process behind the music.

Though I could go on about the pure aesthetic genius and emotional depth of every second of this ballet, it's better to say that it is definitely worth the purchase. This is the most perfect modern ballet I've yet to see, I recommend this to absolutely everyone.",1325289600,21,1490,4.8392156862745095
4855119,5,B005OV1MWA,"This is a great ballet version of the story of ""The Little Mermaid"". Neumeier seems to have returned to an earlier style of sticking to something resembling classical ballet infused with modernity. Unlike most recent versions of this story, here, Neumeier sticks very closely to the original story as Hans Christian Andersen intended it, including Andersens reworked, final version of the ending. Some story elements are nevertheless difficult to convey in a ballet restricted to dancing and pantomime as the only vehicles of expression. Unless you are already familiar with the story, you may miss some things, such as the fact that she will have no voice in human form, and experience the pain of walking on broken glass each time she takes a step on her new human legs. But all in all, the action takes place with great theatricality, dancing, makeup, costumes, and emotional drama. The deeply sad aspect of this story comes through very well.
An interesting addition to the action is the inclusion of Hans Christian Andersen to the story, itself. This was a very useful inclusion by Neumeier giving us an onstage generator of story and action, as well as additional dancing. It also gives us insight into the motivation of the story and how it relates to the life of Hans Christian Andersen. There is no doubt that Andersen's life was replete with the torturous pain of unrequited love and that is what this story is mostly about. Andersen expressed much grief over his unsuccessful love and desire to marry several women, most notably the Swedish soprano, Jenny Lind. He even wrote ""The Nightingale"" expressly out of his love for her. He proposed to her, but she rejected him, telling him she loved him only as a brother. Ouch! When Andersen died, he even had a letter from the love(also unrequited) of his youth, Riborg Voigt, in a pouch around his neck(romantic, isn't it?) But Neumeier points out that Andersen also expressed romantic love for some men as well, and he is completely correct. There is undeniable evidence of this in Andersen's letters and the letters of those in whom he expressed such interest. But the question remains just how extensive was Andersen's interest in men, given his longing most of his life for women? Was ""The Little Mermaid"" written out of homoerotic emotion? Neumeier comes to the conclusion that is was, and he uses the Andersen character in this ballet as a homoerotic element. Is this an honest portrayal of Andersen? Andersen, himself, never included any overt homoerotic elements in his stories. Is it fair for Neumeier to do so? Time will tell.
The musical score is written by Lera Auerbach, and it is full of beautiful melodies and rhythms, including some homages to famous popular melodies(see if you can find them!).
The dancing is very well done, as is the acting. Yuan Yuan Tan really seems to become the character(don't worry, she really isn't that pitiful in real life!).
All in all, this is a gorgeous, exciting ballet of a great fairytale, danced with amazing panache. As long as you don't mind the slight curveball thrown by Neumeier, you should enjoy this.",1324684800,12,3116,4.881132075471698
8482075,5,B005OV1MWA,"This is probably the best choreography so far of the 21st century.  The story is a little complex so it would be best to read the accompanying booklet before watching the performance.  It's based on Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tale.  There's a poet injected in the story.  This is actually Anderson, who is a spectator, a writer of the story, and an alter-ego of the mermaid.  In the prolog there's a male character,who's a very dear friend, Edvard, of Anderson who in the ballet (and in real life) had just gotten married.  So the fairy tale and especially the ballet are autobiographical.  Note:  Edvard and the Prince are different individuals, but are played by the same dancer.
 .  I found it to be a very sad and moving ballet, but in the bonus DVD that comes with it the choreographer, John Neumeier says """"It is neither a tragic nor a happy ending, it is an ending which I think expresses Anderson's own destiny.  Never happy in his personal life, his salvation was his work.  He makes his little mermaid a daughter of the air, having to work for 300 years for her salvation.  So the ballet ends as both of them enter a new world.""  This new world is beautifully shown in the last pas de deux,.as you will see.
  Yuan Yuan Tan, who plays the mermaid, is incredible!",1512000000,,1277,4.510917030567685
8482076,2,B005OV1MWA,"I guess I just did not know what to expect when I ordered this dvd. The production seemed to be more of a long pantomime with occasional dancing. I don't know if anyone remembers the HOT SHOE SHOW, but I often got the feeling that I was watching a series of skits from that series. I loved that show by the way. Anyway, I understand that in pantomime emotions must be exaggerated to replace unspoken words but I honestly thought that some of the overacting stepped across the line into farce. I did not find the story particularly hard to follow so I thought the production was good in that sense. Two hours of ballet managed to get in maybe an hour or so of actually dancing. This was not classical dance by any measure. More modern and just not to my taste. A final evaluation from me says it looked like the director had a vision for this production and the resulting performance reflected that vision. Some might think this is great in an artsy sort of way. I thought it looked lazy, forced and uninspired.",1491609600,,1010,4.406417112299465
