8115260,3,B000EX6KRK,"An Italian western representing an early entrance on this genre by Italian director, Sergio Corbucci.  Unsurprisingly, the movie approaches rather classic American western where our hero, casted by James Mitchum, comes back to his small town to get in the middle of a conflict over land and power around that town. In my view, the greatest value of this movie lies in its historical or collectable value for Italian western fans. Yet, please be warned that you will not find much of the typical Spaghetti flavor I normally seek on this genre. Clearly then, this is not worth the value for the occasional person who is just checking for non American western.

Technically, this Koch DVD indeed looks remastered as indicated on the case. Image generally is crisp clear, and presented in awesome Widescreen format. Audio comes in English, with no subtitles. Extras include the original trailer.",1413504000,,891,5.054421768707483
