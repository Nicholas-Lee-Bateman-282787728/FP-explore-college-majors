8253741,5,B00140KWOY,"As a 29 handicap, I needed to develop more consistency.  The video did a nice job explaining the elements of a golf swing - as a result, I am hitting the ball much better.",1393027200,,171,4.029411764705882
8253742,5,B00140KWOY,"First of all - this video is NOT limited to just the golf swing. This is a 2-disc set covering setup, balance, full golf swing, chip shots, pitch shots, bunker shots, putting, shot shaping, etc. Each disc covers different topics with the setup / address instructions duplicated on each.

I took up golf about 24 months ago. Then I invested lots of time and effort learning the game - including golf lessons. I found this video was better than golf lessons and the BEST and MOST COMPLETE golf video I came across. Trust me - I watched every golf video I could find.

Hint: I rented this from NetFlix but then purchased it because I reviewed them so often.",1334016000,3,654,4.487394957983193
