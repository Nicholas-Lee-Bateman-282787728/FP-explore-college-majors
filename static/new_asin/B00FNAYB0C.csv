8617139,5,B00FNAYB0C,"Joanne Cash, I Do Believe, can be described by many adjectives, excellent, professional, down to earth, it will make you laugh, cry, and generally make you feel good.  I've viewed this DVD in it's entirety twice now, and it covers so much ground, it justifies being 90 minutes long, and could've been longer in this reviewers opinion.  From reminiscing at the original Cash home in Dyess Arkansas, Her deep love of her siblings, battling her own demons, and the heartwarming Christian stories from her and her husband.  This footage will keep you mesmerized whether you're a Johnny Cash fan or not, Yes, the man in black shows up in parts, and sings with his sister!  I invite any Christian, any Johnny Cash fan, or even farther anyone with a love of small town families to purchase and view this labour of love by not only Joanne, but Chad Crow, whom I have to tip my hat too, well done sir, well done!",1382313600,,903,4.555555555555555
