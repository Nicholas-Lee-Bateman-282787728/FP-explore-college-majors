8604636,3,B00EE8AIS8,"It is based on the letter from Union Lieutenant Frank A. Haskell to his brother, days after the battle. There are very few re-enacted scenes and they are severely fragmented. Most of the scenes are photos and drawings. The film is very confusing. The movie Gettysburg starring Tom Berenger, and Martin Sheen is much more exciting and easy to follow.

This movie is good if you want to know the feelings of one of the soldiers who were there.",1390521600,,441,4.582278481012659
