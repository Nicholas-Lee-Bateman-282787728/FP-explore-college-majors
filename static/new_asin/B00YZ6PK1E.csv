8719371,5,B00YZ6PK1E,"Well it's about time!  Remember the Oscar-winning film ARGO from a few years back?  Then you know part of the story about the rescue of six American diplomats who had evaded capture during the seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran, Iran, by Islamist students and militants after the fall of the Shah, which plunged the country into disarray.  The rest of the story?  Let's just say it is long overdue.  Thankfully, OUR MAN IN TEHRAN, a terrific, low-key but effective documentary tells the story from a more rounded perspective.  While ARGO emphasized the CIA's involvement and downplayed the crucial role of the Canadians, OUR MAN IN TEHRAN gives us the Canadian involvement and shows how important it was.

Canadians, generally, are known as a nation of people who do not toot their own horn very often, but if this isn't a story worth tooting about, I don't know what is.  Ken Taylor, the head of the Canadian Embassy at the time, still youthful and somewhat self-effacing, finally steps into the spotlight in this film, along with other key players, to fill in the gaps that ARGO left out.  Proof that a film primarily of ""talking heads"" can be compelling, OUR MAN IN TEHRAN tells this story of heroism, daring and incredible courage in a simple, direct way.

This taut, evenly-paced documentary relies on the story to drive it forward.  Well-chosen archival footage and intelligent interviews help it do just that.  One interesting touch involves filming the interviewees in long shot as well as in close-up, with occasional cuts to the subject being filmed/interviewed.  This reminds the viewer how low-tech a documentary can be and still be effective, rather a metaphor for the low-key but effective Canadians!

After this nightmare was over, Canada and the U.S. had never been closer as friends and neighbours.  OUR MAN IN TEHRAN serves to remind us of that as well.  And that, like Paul Harvey used to say, is the rest of the story.",1443139200,,1945,4.848484848484849
