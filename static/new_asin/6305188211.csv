7884579,1,6305188211,"STRAIGHT UP PORN, STRAIGHT UP PORN, PORN, PORN.
I FAST-FORWARD THROUGH TO SEE IF A THERE WAS EVER A STORY AND THERE WAS NONE.  JUST PORN.
I AM NO PROOD.  BUT I CAN'T STAND FOR PORN TO BE INCLUDED IN REGULAR MOVIES AND CLASSICS.
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DRAMATIC ARTS AND LITERATURE.  THIS IS PORN!!! XXXX-RATED PORN.
*THEY DIDN'T EVEN MAKE THE HUSBAND LOOK OR WALK CRIPPLE.

(SEE THE OLDEST VERSION OF ""LADY CHATTERLY'S LOVER""...50S VERSION...IF YOU WANT ""THE STORY"" LIKE
WAS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK.)

DON'T BOTHER BUYING THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO WATCH PORN.",1473897600,,557,4.642857142857143
