In terms of technical presentation, this isn't A Football Life or America's Game but if you're a Cowboys fan or just a general fan of NFL history, you'll find a lot to be happy with including the late/great Pat Summerall hosting it as well as some contributions from other non-Cowboys like Hall of Fame coach Don Shula. An easy recommend for hardcore fans, just be mindful of the price and running time and be sure you'll really enjoy the content b/c there isn't a whole lot but if you are a fan, this is definitely a case of less is more!",1497916800,,719,4.373134328358209
