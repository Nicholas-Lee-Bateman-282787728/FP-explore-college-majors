3905818,4,B002CAOE30,There are episode guides on the website of each product that you can print off if you're missing the pamphlet guide.,1266796800,,116,4.571428571428571
3905819,5,B002CAOE30,Product good but does not come with a season 3 pamplet explaining what episodes are on which of the 4 dvds. Not a huge deal but a bit frustrating if you are searching for specific episode from season 3. This oversight is not explained in the overview either. My supplier RSDVDBargain jumped thru hoops trying to find the pamplet but so far it cant be found. But rest is great quality and enjoy it so far.,1265846400,2,404,4.328947368421052

3905822,4,B002CAOE30,"Season Three is missing the episode pamphlet (descriiption of each of the 24 shows per season) inside.  I had to send back the entire set of six to get a new episode three and it too had the pamphlet missing.  I had opened the shrinkwrap to make sure all dvd's were there, but this is a gift and how do I explain the pamphlet is missing?",1254614400,16,337,4.090909090909091

3905826,1,B002CAOE30,"Disregard the one star!!  AMAZON won't let me give zero stars.  I should have read the previous reviews as AMAZON should have before I placed the order.  PETITCOLLECTIBLES should not be allowed to advertise their products through AMAZON.  Especially with the numerous complaints lodged.  I ordered the product for Father's Day delivery; the tracking number was fake and the delivery date was a joke.  Now, of course AMAZON will not get involved until the delivery date has passed which turned into almost a month.  PETITCOLLECTIBLES did not reply to 6 different email requests for communication, tracking number, and the product.  What does it take, AMAZON, to shut them out so your customers don't attach their pitful reputation to yours?",1279584000,12,739,5.151260504201681

3905829,2,B002CAOE30,"Product was good, but seller was so SLOW shipping.  Product showed shipped but never arrived.  Contacted them and said they would ship again, took forever to receive product that time too.  Will never go with this seller again.",1278374400,,227,4.921052631578948

3905831,5,B002CAOE30,"With much of TV being a wasteland of reality shows, I tend not to watch that much but then I caught the series Two and a Half Men in reruns on tv, and wow it was actually hilarious!  With this DVD set it was great to actually watch the entire series in order.",1273708800,2,259,3.8867924528301887
3905832,3,B002CAOE30,"When I ordered, I was expecting 6 sets (one per season, like in the image) but instead it arrived in a single box, with cheap dvd holders. Almost seems pirated. I have bought many tv season box sets from amazon and this has never happened before. This one is going back. I'll upload the image of the set I received.",1268956800,9,315,4.266666666666667

8363850,5,B002CAOE30,"Superb characters, great writing, brilliant acting. The entire series is fantastic. Was sorry to see Charlie sheen go out in the 10th. He rocked!
All the characters are well created and bring great life to the series.

The theme and much of the language is adult oriented so not really for kids.

A classic, I think. A must watch.",1375401600,,330,4.576271186440678
8363851,5,B002CAOE30,I must have spent weeks sitting and watching the entire series. The show is hysterical and is one of those shows you can watch and re-watch many times over. Charlie Sheen is great I don't care what the media has to say about him.,1373846400,,229,4.2272727272727275
