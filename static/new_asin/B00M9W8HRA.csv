6565272,4,B00M9W8HRA,The episodes that are missing on this dvd are episode 18 Beauty and the Beach and episode 63 Holiday Hi Jynx. But you can get the  third dvd of the 2008 box set of Pokemon Indigo league instead. If u really want episode 63. But sadly episode 18 wasn't included in that one either.,1415836800,,280,4.185185185185185
6565273,4,B00M9W8HRA,I don't mind if a single episode is missing so much if it means we can keep getting good season type releases of pokemon thru hoenn until they stop at shinoh.,1414540800,,158,4.129032258064516
6565274,3,B00M9W8HRA,"So I'll come right out and say it: Holiday Hi-Jynx has been removed from this collection.

With that out of the way, this repackaging is more about saving space. And it may be my imagination, but the picture looks a bit brighter and cleaner. However, unlike the previous sets, there are no episode listings anywhere on or within the box/cases, so the only way to see which episode is on which disc is to play them and check the menu.

So pretty much if you want the entire Indigo League series in one package for a low cost, and do not mind losing a controversial episode, than this set is for you. Otherwise I would recommend paying a little more for the first three bulkier box sets.",1414454400,39,685,4.3858267716535435
6565275,1,B00M9W8HRA,"This score isn't on the product itaself, for that I'd give it 5 stars, but the fact that it's most likely lacking something major really hurts it. Judging by the new packaging it's missing 1 episode that the original boxsets had released, I think that missing episode may be Holidya Hi-Jynx, considering Jynx ix in her oginal Blackface Ganguro look, that's a pretty safe bet that's the episode excluded from this new release. Get the original boxsets while you can before that episode becomes lost again.",1411603200,13,504,4.872093023255814
6565276,5,B00M9W8HRA,Nice that they are finally releasing the Indigo league in one set but it would be nice if they actually tried to include Beauty and the Beach since it was dubbed and aired twice so why not try to get in released on dvd finally and not to mention other episodes that were stated to have been dubbed and not aired.,1410480000,6,312,4.131147540983607
6565277,5,B00M9W8HRA,Arrived timely and as described.,1520899200,,32,5.6
6565278,4,B00M9W8HRA,"This blu-ray contains episodes 1-52, NOT the complete Indigo League like the DVD release...sadly. I bought this because blu-ray discs don't scratch as easily and I won't have to worry about the episodes skipping in the future. Plus I was really excited to see all the original episodes upscaled in HD. Honestly, comparing the quality of this to the DVD release...there really isn't THAT much of a difference. It does look better, and it does sound better, I'm not gonna deny that. However I really wish they would've gone through whatever process they did for the blu-ray release of the movies, with these episodes. The movies look AMAZING, and these look good. If you already own the Indigo League DVD's, it's not that big of a difference. However if you're like me and want Pokemon on blu-ray, just for the sheer fact....get it lol.",1518825600,,834,4.798611111111111
6565279,3,B00M9W8HRA,Its blue ray but when I bought the DVDs the first season was about 72 episodes and this is only 52? Ash isn't even in the indigo league in the last episodes on the discs,1518393600,,169,3.857142857142857

6565282,1,B00M9W8HRA,Not the whole season!  Only 2/3 complete 52 of 78 episodes released in the US,1517270400,,77,4.133333333333334
6565283,5,B00M9W8HRA,"Read the reviews and comments before you buy!
I bought the DVD version, as the comments suggested it was the full series whereas the BluRay was not, and all is good.
All the original episodes are here (minus a few 'rarer' ones noted in some of the other reviews). It's nice to have it all in once place!",1516924800,4,303,4.241379310344827

6565285,5,B00M9W8HRA,"This blu-ray set, entitled Pokemon: Indigo League - Season 1 Champion's Edition contains episodes 1-52. I can only assume that the next Pokemon blu-ray (if and when it comes out) will contain both the last third of Indigo League and the Adventures on the Orange Islands episodes. That is probably why this first set stops at such a strange place. Even so, getting 52 episodes for roughly 50 dollars is a good deal for anime. The problem is that the title is a little deceptive, making it seem like this set contains the entire Indigo League.

If you're looking to complete your Indigo League set on DVD, you need only buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pokemon-Season-1-Indigo-League-Part-3/dp/B00MH8ESOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pokemon Season 1: Indigo League Part 3</a>&nbsp;like I did, since it picks up right where this blu-ray set leaves off. I say ""complete,"" but if you've been following the Pokemon DVD releases, you know that there are some banned episodes. This blu-ray set is missing two episodes, while the DVD of part 3 is missing another two. However, this is no surprise and I'm not going to deduct any stars. We're probably not ever getting those episodes back because of their ""offensive"" content.

While this blu-ray does not have the highest picture quality of any anime blu-ray I've ever seen, It is darn good. There is absolutely no shaking when the ""camera"" angle changes, even though there was a little of this on the DVD releases (and in several other DVDs of older anime). The sound quality is crystal clear and mixed perfectly. This season of Pokemon is over 20 years old, and naturally you can see some signs of age even in the picture quality of the blu-ray, such as the occasional jiggle or some muted background lighting. I think that overall they could have made the graphics and lighting even sharper, especially in the background. But it's better than Pokemon Indigo League has ever looked before.

Perhaps in an effort to preserve as much of the original format aired as possible, they have reinserted the little clips of the characters saying Dont go away! and And now, back to our show! that played before and after commercial breaks. They have also put the Pokerap segments back at the end of each episode, which was a nice surprise for me. There was a different part of the rap for each day of the week, and when you put them together it creates one whole rap with the original 150 Pokemon in it. Usually they just put the entire rap in a special features section on the DVDs.

The box is red and designed to look like a pokedex. All the writing is on the otherwise clear slipcover. Inside the box is a single thick blu-ray case with all 6 discs inside, NONE of which are stacked on top of each other, and a little book with the first four chapters of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pokmon-Adventures-Vol-1-2nd-Edition-Pokemon/dp/1421530546/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pokmon Adventures, Vol. 1 (2nd Edition) (Pokemon)</a>&nbsp;for a sample of a completely different adaptation of the Pokemon video games. But we all know I bought this set for the little Pikachu Sweet Potato recipe card. :^)

Overall, this is a very nice, reasonably priced set for a collector, or for someone who just wants to enjoy Pokemon in the highest resolution available. I hope they release more sets of this quality soon. Until then, we'll have to make do with the DVDs for the rest of the series.",1515801600,7,3502,5.0834782608695654
6565286,5,B00M9W8HRA,It's just as great as it was when I was a kid watching it on TV on WB. It's even better now that it's on blu-ray. Hopefully they'll release the other seasons/series on blu-ray as well so I can get that too. I was excited when they finally did it with DragonBall Z and I was excited about this too.,1515628800,,297,3.966666666666667

6565288,3,B00M9W8HRA,This is a review on the Pokemon Indigo League Blu Ray champions edition. I was pleasently surprised to see the first season of pokemon coming to blu ray so I didn't hesitate picking this up...however to be disappointed. First off the episodes are in HD but the aspect ratio is still 4x3 not your normal HD 16x9. Then as I'm watching through the series I find out that it just includes 52 episodes and stops even before Ash makes it to cinnabar island to challenge Blaine...and is missing a good 20 to 30 episodes since the final episode count to season one was 70 some episodes. Kind of a let down.,1515110400,,598,4.396396396396397
6565289,5,B00M9W8HRA,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She's watched most of it on Netflix, but they are missing the last like 20-30 episodes! Now she can finish the season! Plus my husband is a Pokemon lover and I've come to like it quite a bit as well!",1514937600,3,242,4.170212765957447
6565290,1,B00M9W8HRA,Very Misleading info on this set. Viz Media should be ashamed because they know this isn't the FULL season 1. It's half of season 1. Saying that this is Season 1 is a lie. They need to either fix this or take it off of production till they get all of the episodes for season 1 finished. I didn't think they would be stupid to make the same mistake as they did with the DVD sets. Guess they are... And that makes me wonder if they did the same mistakes on the episodes as the DVD sets had some episodes missing. Will that happen with the Blu-Ray edition as well? Do the series right this time. Stop cutting corners and put out the full season...,1514332800,,644,4.16
6565291,3,B00M9W8HRA,"I got these for Christmas and FREAKED OUT over owning Pokmon Indigo League on Blu-Ray. I loved Pokmon growing up and I've tried watching some of the newer ones and nothing beats the first seasons. The actors, the style, the characters, everything. I watched these recently on Netflix and was so bummed when I had to stop in the middle of season one, so I figured I'd get my copy for Christmas. Originally I saw the DVD complete pack and man do I wish I'd have stuck to it because the Blu-Ray one is NOT the full season. It is only half of Season One and left me right where Netflix left me. Now I have to go buy the next volume of episodes which is frustrating.

The product itself looks really good and I'm still happy to have it in such nice quality but I'd have been much happier with the DVD version of this product since it's almost all of the episodes. I just should have researched it more, oh well. :)

I gave it 3 stars since it's not complete but the quality is there. :)",1514332800,,981,4.185185185185185
6565292,2,B00M9W8HRA,"When it arrived i notices it was in a pretty large box considering it was the only item in it. There wasn't enough packing bubbles to secure it allowing it to rattle freely causing heavy damage to the packaging. This wouldnt have bothered me much but some of the disks were loose in their cases. Luckily the dvds played fine after a bit of dusting,(disk 1 skipped and froze initially) With the quality it arrived in i may has well have ordered it used.",1514246400,,452,4.392857142857143

I would wait til the second part of season 1",1513641600,,146,3.7419354838709675
6565295,5,B00M9W8HRA,So glad that they are now doing this on Blu-ray. Great episodes to watch on Ash beginning his Pok&eacute;mon journey in Kanto to try to become a Pok&eacute;mon master.,1513382400,,167,4.793103448275862
6565296,4,B00M9W8HRA,The dvds came in perfect condition and the plastic cases were also in great condition. The box holding the dvd cases looked like it was used with creases and dents on the box. The dvds also play well. Would've given 5 stars if not for the banged up box because I wanted it to be displayable too.,1513209600,,295,4.192982456140351
6565297,3,B00M9W8HRA,Yeah were missing a lot of episodes. It only shows ash getting four badges!! Still missing all the episodes leading up to ash entering the Indigo league!! And the Blu-ray says complete collection when were missing half the season!!?? Lets fix this and put out the rest of the episodes! Cause this was awesome getting on Blu-ray and I want to see the rest!! Looks fantastic!!,1513123200,,374,4.681818181818182

6565301,2,B00M9W8HRA,This blu-ray set should not share an item page with the DVD and Amazon is irresponsible for lumping the two together. The content of the Blu-ray is NOT THE SAME as the content for the DVD set. If you think you're getting all episodes of Indigo League youd best think again. This is the same content as the recent Netflix showing and nothing more. It looks only marginally better than that encode and has zero extras worth watching. My little ones were disappointed and I see now I shouldve looked more carefully at the product page since Amazon has ZERO sense.,1510704000,39,560,4.554455445544554

As the first season of Pokemon, this collection does not disappoint. My only complaint is that there are 3 episodes missing in this collection as mentioned in a couple of the other reviews, but you don't really notice it as far as the story line goes so it's not that big of a deal. My 6 year old did not even notice anything missing. He has spent countless hours enjoying this DVD collection, I'm sure you and/or your children will too.

This is truly a classic cartoon, and for many, the first anime they ever watched. I thoroughly enjoyed this set, and I'm looking forward to collecting them all. Previously, TPCi was releasing the series in volumes instead of seasons. This was a very expensive way to own all of this anime, but now, they are releasing these season sets. This is an amazing value, and if you are a Pokemon fan, it's well worth the money. So far, at the time of writing this review, they have released all of the Kanto, Orange Islands, and Johto sagas. The beginning of the Hoenn saga is slated for release this Spring. If they continue to stick to the pattern they've gone with so far, they tend to release two sets a year (one in Fall and one in Spring), then we should hopefully see the entire Pokemon anime on budget friendly collector's sets. As someone who grew up in the 1990's with this franchise, I look forward to collecting all of these sets and watching them with my kids some day.

After watching episode 1 all the way through without skipping chapters or fast forwarding it glitched and started episode 1 over instead of going to episode 2. If you try to skip chapters or fast forward it still does this. It happens for every episode so the only way to watch it is to finish an episode, go to the main menu, go to ""part B"" of the next episode to watch and rewind it to just a few seconds before the start of the episode. If you rewind it too far it glitches the same way and starts the previous episode over. This is extremely frustrating since it was a brand new disk fresh out of the plastic. And it's not just the fist disk it's the whole series. Also one episode was so pixilated and freezing up to the point that I had to just skip it.",1474588800,2,844,4.152439024390244

So each dvd is correct, but for some reason when the episodes were transferred to the DVDs they only listed 6 episodes so it gives the appearance of only 6, so far I'm happy with the collection, the 4 stars are due to the DVDs not having the correct menu, at least with the both copies I received",1471305600,,920,4.145251396648045

I compared each episode to the episode list on wiki and found that there are 4 episodes missing: Beauty and the Beach, The Legend of Dratini, Cyber Soldier Porygon, and Holiday Hi-Jynx . I wrote them in the list below so you can see where they fall in the series. There are some episodes out of order based on air date/Japanese release date. I also listed those episodes with the correct episode numbers in the list below. However, I found that when I watched these episodes in the order the DVD set presented them, they did not interfere with the story line as it all happened between cities and were filler episodes. The episode that people have seen would assume were out of place is Snow Day Out, which is due to a Japanese error. Both Snow Day Out and Holiday Jinx were postponed in Japan and wasn't shown until the next years holiday season because of what happened with the Cyber Soldier Porygon episode that delayed the season for the year before. This had nothing to do with VIZ media. The episodes titles and numbers are not listed on the DVD set so I ended up finding and adjusting a list online and printing them out and slipping them inside the DVD case as shown. Otherwise, for the price, I am very grateful to have this piece of childhood in one neat box set. I couldn't be happier.

6565408,3,B00M9W8HRA,"Pokemon Indigo League was the series my friends and I grew up watching together on Kids WB. It was exciting and fun. Now seeing that this series has been released more than once, I have to admit that this complete series box set is convenient (and saves shelf space). However, most of us have learned that another episode has been banned. According to the information I researched, Japan had made 82 episodes (US only got 80 episodes) for Pokemon Indigo League (Season 1). There were 2 episodes that never made it to the US:

Episode 35: ""The Legend of Miniryu."" This was actually the Safari Zone episode and it was banned due to the prevalent usage of handguns throughout the episode. The Safari Zone warden points a gun at Ash's head, and even shoots the gun at Team Rocket. You can find this episode online English subbed. After watching it, things made a lot more sense. I've always wondered when Ash went to the Safari Zone and caught all those Tauros.

Episode 38 ""Electric Soldier Porygon"" (or as some of us call it ""The Seizure Episode""): this episode has been banned worldwide after airing only once in Japan. One particular scene of this episode had a series of flashing lights, which caused a total of approximately 685 Japanese children, 375 girls and 310 boys to be sent to the hospital with symptoms of epilepsy. The show went on hiatus for four months. This episode was heavily edited in Japan and now comes with a caution in the beginning stating viewers to not sit too close to the TV and to watch the episode in a lit room.

Anyways, those were the only episodes (for Indigo League) that didn't make it to the US. Now 2 more episodes have been banned from the US after only being aired once (or twice). The episodes are:

""Beauty and the Beach"": I actually enjoyed this episode when I was a kid, but I guess parents felt different after seeing it with their kids. I'm sure it was banned due to complaints (or some other reason). I've read some reviews on this episode that it was banned due to James being in an inflated bikini suit (for a beauty contest) that included inflatable breast. This scene of course was edited out in the English dub. After looking at this episode again (now that I'm older), I have noticed a few scenes that weren't appropriate (of course kids don't notice it unless it's pointed out to them):

1.) After Ash, Misty, & Brock crash a boat belonging to an old man, they work for him to pay off their debt. During their meeting, the old man stares at Misty (after Ash hides behind her) and says ""You remind me of my granddaughter,"" but when he says the line, he's blushing and staring directly at Misty's breast. The old man is a pervert.

2.) During the beauty contest when Misty walks on stage in her bikini, she waves to the crowd and says under her breath ""This is totally embarrassing and degrading, but we need the money."" That can be taken the wrong way and can also be referred to prostitution (most likely the reason why this episode was banned).

This episode can still be found on Youtube and on other anime websites. It is also rumored that this episode is featured in the ""Orange Islands Box Set"" in the bonus features as a lost episode (which has been edited again).

""Holiday Hi-Jynx:"" This episode was banned (as most of you stated) due to racism. Someone had complained and wrote in their article that Jynx was  ""negative stereotype of African-Americans related to characters in The Story of Little Black Sambo."" Seriously? I'm sorry, but I just don't see it and after watching this episode, I thought it was cute esp. since it's a Christmas Special. I've never got to see this episode on TV until I bought my bulky Indigo League set a few years ago.

So, this Indigo League has another episode missing, but if you don't care about the ""Holiday Hi-Jynx"" episode then this would be the box set series you would want to get. If not, then get the 3 bulky DVD box set collection. Just keep in mind that the bulky DVD box set collection has episodes out of order.",1431734400,70,4018,4.514442916093535

6565410,5,B00M9W8HRA,"Got this for my girlfriend with a cubone plushie. I mean, for like ten dollars cheaper than the other one who really cares if it's missing an episode with a racist jinx? I wouldn't really want to watch that one anyways.",1429142400,2,219,4.365853658536586
6565411,4,B00M9W8HRA,This is a really good item to buy. My only complaint is that it is missing the episode Holiday Hi-Jynx due to the controversy.,1428019200,,126,4.291666666666667
6565412,1,B00M9W8HRA,"This would be 5 star if Holiday Hi-Jynx wasn't missing.
Also it doesn't show any information on the name of the episodes unless you pop disc in dvd or blu ray player.
Get the original 3 box set if you can cause you'll get the name of episodes on back of the case and Holiday Hi-Jynx is included.",1427500800,7,295,4.103448275862069
6565413,1,B00M9W8HRA,I wish the episodes would just play one after another without having to change it yourself and that really pisses me off. But I've wanted this set for a long time so I guess I'll just have to live with it.,1427241600,4,205,4.024390243902439

6565415,5,B00M9W8HRA,"The frist season of pokemon is easily the best one!!!! This is when pokemon all began. If your new on pokemon then this DVD set will make you want to watch more of the anime.

If you already watched the frist season then you should know about pokemania. This was a time when pokemon in the 90s was what everyone watch. Pokemon indigo league episodes would come on at 7:00 in the morning. Many kids watched pokemon before going to school. Plus with pokemon red and blue made the franchise even more successful. When pokemon yellow came out,everyone wanted it because it was like the anime. Sadly,pokemania ended around 2003 or 2004. Pokemon became useless. Still many kids still liked it.

Okay,this is the frist set of pokemon. But what is it about? A young boy named ash Ketchum traveling around the kanto region catching wild pokemon. Along with his partner pikachu and his best friends misty and brock. Ash Mets New rivals,battles New pokemon,and stops team rocket!!!!

Pokemon indigo league I believe are the frist 2 seasons of pokemon. That's 78 episodes of pokemon!!!!

If your still new to pokemon then what's its point? Gotta catch 'em all! In the wold of pokemon,trainers catch wild pokemon. They want to complete the pokedex. Plus catch all 150 original pokemon.

Pokemon is a great series. Pokemon would be a very good kids show for ages 6-15. Well,there are some people that watch pokemon and there adults. Why? Because it's there childhood. Pokemon is also adventure,fantasy,and comedy.

If you love the indigo league series then you should get red/blue/yellow. There ALOT like the anime. Yellow is the most like it.

So,if you love anime or pokemon and you want to know how it started then watch indigo league!!!!",1425686400,2,1727,4.8141891891891895

The only thing it has is at least there are special features, that's one thing it has over the 3 remastered Pokemon movie releases in America.

Additionally, only the first 52 have been remastered in HD so far, which is why this Blu-ray stops at episode 52. ",1524268800,10,383,4.148648648648648
8671001,2,B00M9W8HRA,I orded the blue ray edition only to find that instead of all 78 episodes it only contained 52. Furher more the Blueray case it self was cracked on both sides of the binding and though the pokedex box was very nice. It seems like a drastic oversight that they left out half of the series on blueray but gave all 72 episodes on DVD! I mean really WTF?! I paid extra money for quality and all I got was what I saw on netflix already.,1522800000,,431,4.023255813953488

Box design is excellent.

I hope they follow up with Blurays of Orange Islands and Johto Journeys.",1521849600,,183,4.870967741935484
