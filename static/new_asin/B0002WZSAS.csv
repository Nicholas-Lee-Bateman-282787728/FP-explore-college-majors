One of a kind. Great,great,great.

Thank you to all the people who made it",1141862400,,139,4.75
2130790,4,B0002WZSAS,"I would echo all the above in the awesome musicianship without a doubt. It was well worth seeing. My only complaint is that since I presume alot of musicians are buying this DVD why couldn't the cameraman focus on the solo being played instead of swooping everywhere, especially around the back or side of the guitar neck when they are playing? Show some respect! If you are looking to see what the players are doing look fast. But if you don't care then I totally recommend it. These guys rock.",1137110400,,495,4.511111111111111
2130791,5,B0002WZSAS,"I have seen The Players four times at 3rd.& Lindsey in Nashville. I even had Brent Mason sign a red Strat I have. Anyway, they do what they do best on this DVD. Anyone aspiring to be a studio musician or professional musician of any kind should watch, listen and learn. They play for the SONG.",1110758400,2,293,4.25
2130792,4,B0002WZSAS,"I read so much about Brent Mason on a Mason Family Website that I had to see who he is.  We were very impressed with his playing.  His bio on the DVD extras indicates that Chet Atkins discovered him.  That is such a compliment.  All I ever read was about Brent's playing.  He sings a song on this DVD called ""Lucky Man"".  He can sing!  What talent!!  I was surprised by Peter Frampton's appearance because I was expecting country music.  He had the biggest smile on his face the entire time.  I could tell he was having a blast.  I can't wait to show my daughter Jim Horn's segment.  She is in her 3rd year of flute and wants to begin playing saxophone while continuing flute.  Jim plays a song where he crosses between the instruments.  It's quite impressive.  One of the highlights is Vince Gill.  He plays well, sings well and looks fine.  I could listen to his voice all day.  If you buy this DVD, you won't be disappointed.",1104451200,2,928,4.3274853801169595
2130793,4,B0002WZSAS,"There is a reason they are the best studio musicians in the land.

Peter Frampton was excellent - he can sing and he sure can play.  Same for Travis Tritt and Vince Gill.  For me Sean Colvin could have been omitted.  I would rather have seen Bonnie Raitt or Sheryl Crow etc.  Very nice DD-5.1 soundtrack - video is good but a cleaner video transfer would rate a ""5""....",1100304000,,369,4.2898550724637685
2130794,4,B0002WZSAS,"I am familiar w/ all these fine players, and I was really looking forward to getting to hear them cut loose in a live setting.  Well, it doesn't really happen here.  Yes, everyone gets solos but for the most part they are short and fairly generic.  I collect Brent Masons work and he doesn't even break a sweat here!  I also believe they made a poor choice inviting so many guests, I mean, sometimes it almost seems like a Peter Frampton concert!  That said, the band is tight, solos are good, guest performers (Frampton,Tritt,Horn,Colvin) all acquit themselves well, and the audience obviously had a great time.  But for me, I don't need any of those marquee names, just let the session guys do what they do best - CUT LOOSE!  Bad production in my opinion, cause anybody who knows about these guys doesn't need any of those artificial sweeteners, the Nashville top scale players are more than capable of carrying the show themselves.  Hell, Brent Mason sings ""Lucky Man""(not the Greg Lake tune) as an ending song, and his voice is easily as good as any of the aforementioned ""special guests"".  The bonus features were really flimsy also, just a biography and short interview with each guy.  They deserve much better!  But I'm still giving it 4 stars cause it is light years better than anything else available commercially out there.  BTW, these guys have an album cd out as well and it is well worth searching out!",1099699200,5,1416,4.665322580645161
8033910,5,B0002WZSAS,Wonderful material!,1466640000,,19,9.0
8033911,5,B0002WZSAS,Simply bad-ass from start to finish. Some of Nashville's elite session players with guests with great playing from all. Highly recommended!,1462406400,,139,5.666666666666667
8033912,5,B0002WZSAS,This is a very good disk with some really good guest performances  the Travis tritt and peter Frampton performences were exelent the players are a great band I really liked the song lucky man this is a short 56 minute disk and is recorded in a 5.1 and 2.0 soundtrack both are fine .this is a disk I recommend if you like the band the guest or country music .,1367798400,,358,4.114285714285714
8033913,5,B0002WZSAS,"I'm a big fan of Brent Mason and this DVD is a great showcase of, not only his ability, but that of several other masterful session players. The genre is hard to categorize as they sweep from ""country tech"" to fusion, jazz, blues and the eclectic. Vince Gill is featured on a killer smoking blues number.

Don't let ""Nashville"" lead you to think this is about country music. It is a video of some of the finest musicians in the world playing a diverse variety of music.

Highly recommended.",1275696000,,490,4.49438202247191
8033914,4,B0002WZSAS,"I enjoyed this performance from a varied bunch of excellent musicians.
I would have liked to see more of Vince Gill but then, who wouldn't!",1253059200,,139,4.6
8033915,5,B0002WZSAS,Worth the price of admission just to see Brent Mason on guitar and Vince gill go at it live.,1209772800,,92,3.8947368421052633
8033916,1,B0002WZSAS,I am very disapointed because I thought that brent mason would be the star main player as I adore him immensly.instead i got a bunch of low/medium guitarists & singers. VERY DISSAPOINTED!!! a waste of money. Y.Ben El Lonay.,1173398400,,223,4.743589743589744
8033917,3,B0002WZSAS,I was hoping this would feature Brent and Paul more trading licks but it was still very good.  The tunes with Vince Gil and the ones of just the Players are the best.,1170028800,,166,4.03030303030303
8033918,5,B0002WZSAS,"Can't get out much??  Well, sit back, relax and enjoy the show.  This is great inspiration from Nashville's best, not to mention some terrific hall-of-fame performers.  Bayers, Franklin, Hobbs, Mason, Rhodes and Horn are the in-your-dreams band. And ""good, real good"" doesn't begin to describe Travis Tritt's spontaneous combustion or Vince Gill's subdued Tele supremacy.  Lord-a-mighty!!  But the biggest surprise is Peter Framton. Who? Yeah, Frampton. He's still got the chops and the tone.  Get off the couch and give the boys a standing ovation.",1168473600,,549,5.4
8033919,5,B0002WZSAS,These guys are the cream of the Nashville musicians.  Brent Mason is amazing,1162684800,,76,4.846153846153846
