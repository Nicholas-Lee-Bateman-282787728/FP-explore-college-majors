3830393,1,B001ZXRGKS,"First, I LOVE Lucy and always felt that no matter what she did, it was worth watching...even 1974's ""Mame"" which was a clambake, had its moments.  Watching Lucy on TV without live audience responses is pretty ""blah"".  These specials that Lucy did with Dean Martin & Jackie Gleason seemed like little more than Lucy's need to work, without really reading the scripts and figuring out ""What can we do to make these funny?""  The Dean Martin special is tolerable, but worth skipping; however, the special with Jackie Gleason has to be the worst TV special in the history of television.  There is no funny moments.  Just Lucy struggling with bad material and Gleason struggling to be sober.  I Love Lucy, but I can do without ""Lucy Gets Lucky"" or ""Three For Two"" in my DVD library.",1248912000,13,776,4.669117647058823
3830394,5,B001ZXRGKS,"This is a very special summer for Lucy fans.  We are getting THE LUCY SOW and HERE'S LUCY both with their 1st season on dvd.  But make sure to not bypass this excellent dvd that contains two specials Lucy did after HERE'S LUCY was off the air.  Lucy did many specials of varying quality and even if these two aren't your favorite they are presented here in remastered brilliance and it is awesome to see the master at work in different material.

LUCY GETS LUCKY costars Dean Martin and runs like a long Lucy episode.  It has some hilarious moments.  The one very noticable thing is no laugh track.  THREE FOR TWO teams Lucy with the great Jackie Gleason and interestingly at the time she chose to make this special a trio of drama vignettes and not comedy.  They are not the best vehicles for the drama side of Lucy whe know is there but the special is very enjoyable and a mustt have for any true Lucy fans collection.

Even if you love both these specials, this dvd is a must buy just for the extras.  It is overflowing with never before released material.  Lucy at one time had a radio talk show and there are 2 episodes with guest Dean Martin.  There is a lengthy interview with Gino Conforti, a frequent Lucy guest star with a long history with the comedy queen.  He offers much insight into her as a person and as a professional.  There is also rare footage and bloopers.  Lucy fans will be thrilled with all this material.

I am thrilled with this dvd and thrilled to have these specials in my collection.  I am greatly anticipating release of the others.  Highly recommend this dvd.",1248048000,7,1591,4.427586206896552
3830395,5,B001ZXRGKS,"As a huge Lucy fan, I had never seen these specials.  They are excellent and fun.  Highly recommended.",1247011200,3,102,4.611111111111111
3830396,5,B001ZXRGKS,"MPI has done a great job with this set. Even if these may not be two of your favorite Lucy shows, the bonus features are worth the price alone - two interviews with Dean, illustrated with many photos and some animation, and some outtakes with Dean from the special. Check it out.",1247011200,5,279,4.384615384615385
3830397,5,B001ZXRGKS,"This is the first Double DVD of The Lucille Ball Specials. I contacted MPI Home Video to find out if they are putting more of The Lucille Ball Specials on dvd, besides this one, and they said YES! Lucille Ball had 11 television specials between 1964 and 1980. I will briefly list them, for those who want to know, but MPI did not say which of the specials they are putting out on future dvd's, but I am hoping all of them! The specials are: 1. Mr.& Mrs.(w/Bob Hope)1964, 2. Lucy in London (w/Anthony Newley)1966, 3. Carol+2 (w/Carol Burnett) 1967, 4. Happy Anniversary and Goodbye (w/Art Carney) 1974, 5. Dean Martin's Celebrity Roast-Lucille Ball (w/dozens of stars) 1975, 6. Lucy Gets Lucky (w/Dean Martin) 1975, 7. Three for Two (w/Jackie Gleason) 1975, 8. What now Catherine Curtis? (w/Art Carney) 1976, 9. Lucy Calls the President (w/Vivian Vance and Gale Gordon) 1977, 10. Lucy Comes to Nashville (w/Barbara Mandrell) 1978 and 11. Lucy moves to NBC (w/ Bob Hope, Johnny Carson and many others) 1980.

This dvd features two of Lucy's television specials. The first being LUCY GETS LUCKY, which premiered on March 1, 1975. This special was filmed on location at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas. Lucy plays Lucy Collins, a huge fan of Dean Martin, who is determined to see Dean in person, even though his concert is completely sold out. When Lucy finds out Dean is doing a private performance at the MGM just for the employees, she naturally gets herself hired there and the trouble begins. The fun starts, when Dean has to save the hotel and Las Vegas from disaster! This special is one hour long and also guest stars her husband Gary Morton, Jackie Coogan along with many others.

The second television special of Lucy's on this dvd set is THREE FOR TWO, which premiered on December 3, 1975. This special is a comedy/drama which features Lucy and Jackie Gleason playing three different couples in 3 different crisis stories. The first story is about Herb and Sally, who go off to Rome on a vacation to reignite their love life. While in Rome, they discover things they never knew about each other, after 24 years of marriage. The second story is about Fred and Rita, who try to decide if they should tell about both their infidelities. The last story is about Mike and Pauline, who are in a Christmas family crisis, when they realize their children are growing up and no longer want them to dominate everything in their personal lives.

This special is also one hour long, and according to MPI, they will include the following BONUS FEATURES:
Let's Talk To Lucy-2 Long lost radio interviews with Dean Martin from 1964 and 1965 (Lucy and Dean have great conversations including talking about their young sons being together in the ""Dino, Desi and Billy"" band)
Bloopers
Featurette with guest actor Gino Conforti (he played Antonio in LUCY GETS LUCKY)
Rare Lucy Footage (includes Lucy's appearance when she was a guest on Art Linkletter's House Party in 1965!)

MPI also assured me that the film quality will be perfect, as they are making the dvd's from the original films, just as they did on the earlier released this year, Lucy and Desi: A Home Movie. They did a gorgeous, pristine job on this dvd, so I am very excited about this new series of The Lucille Ball Specials! These Lucille Ball Specials are so very rare, as I haven't seen any of them since they premiered on television, way back in the sixties and seventies! I can't wait for the future releases, and I hope MPI has the rights to do all of them! They were all owned by CBS, except for the last special, when Lucy literally broke her CBS contract and went to NBC. The Lucy In London was actually filmed on locaton in London, and I remember The Dave Clark 5 singing, along with all the mod stuff from 1966, so I hope the wait is short for the releases of all these great Lucille Ball Specials, so I can stop remembering and actually see them again!",1243468800,33,3917,4.615494978479196
3830398,5,B001ZXRGKS,"I am anxious to see The Lucille Ball Specials.  I have read great things about each and every one.  MPI has done a great job with releases in the past, so I expect nothing but a great quality product with this.  I encourage all comedy fans to buy this release.  You will definitely enjoy it and we want to ensure the rest of Lucy's specials get an official release!",1242950400,7,365,4.246376811594203

3830400,5,B001ZXRGKS,"It's most unusual to see three of the best comedians working together, as we see here with Lucy, Dino & Jackie.  ""Lucy Gets Lucky,"" filmed at the ""old"" MGM Grand Hotel, not only is entertaining but, most certainly, is a keepsake!",1362096000,,229,4.585365853658536
3830401,5,B001ZXRGKS,There was a real chemistry together with both of the specials! Dean Martin and Lucy have a great Chemistry in Lucy Gets Lucky. This is one of the best of the specials with Lucy. She is off to Vegas to see Dean Martin! Classic Lucy here. Three for two is very interesting look at love. Three short stories instead of one! The Chemistry between Lucy and Jackie Gleason is magical and funny. If you love Lucy and cannot get enough I would recommend this pair of specials. No Lucille Ball collection is complete without them.,1360627200,,521,4.494736842105263
3830402,5,B001ZXRGKS,Just received my copy of Lucy Gets Lucky/Three For Two yesterday.  I must say the specials are really good.  I haven't seen them since they were first aired in the 1970's.,1357344000,,171,4.483870967741935
3830403,5,B001ZXRGKS,"I have never seen ""Lucy Gets Lucky"" and ""Three for Two""  so I decided to buy them and I was surprised.  Both specials are really entertaining.  ""Lucy Gets Lucky"" is a rehash of an old Lucy show but thorughly enjoyable.  ""Three for Two"" co-starring Jackie Gleason is somewhat more a comedy-drama but its Lucy who steals the show.  I would suggest to any person interested in watching Lucy perform in these specials to order them as soon as possible.  It was a treat.",1302825600,,465,4.542168674698795
3830404,2,B001ZXRGKS,"These ""specials"" are anything but.  Despite the big names, both episodes are disappointing.  The writing isn't funny, and the actors have no chemistry.  (Hard to beat Lucille with Desi.)  No laughs.  I'm still a Lucy die-hard fan, though.",1294617600,2,238,5.157894736842105

3830406,5,B001ZXRGKS,"I think the specials are amazing. I love them. I can't wait for the rest to come out! Picture is so clear, everything is wonderful. Stories are great, and of course Lucy is amazing! Not gonna lie, I usually buy DVD's for bonus features - & this one has tons! Lucy on the radio, Lucy on TV shows, Lucy's co-stars talking about Lucy - Working with Lucy, it's wonderful. FOR SURE worth it!",1250208000,10,386,4.301369863013699
3830407,3,B001ZXRGKS,"Let me first say that I LOVE LUCY and have since I was old enough to watch tv. I grew up watching her shows, I own I LOVE LUCY the entire series as well as HERES LUCY boxed set and the first season of THE LUCY SHOW. I am glad I bought these specials but I am sorry to say they are not Lucy at her best by any means. The first special with Dean Martin was pretty good. I did enjoy it. That being said, THREE FOR TWO with Jackie Gleason was certainly another story. I am also a fan of Gleasons, I have all the sets of the HONEY MOONERS and watch them all the time, check out the color episodes now availible from MPI, they are very funny. this special is almost unwatchable,something I thought I would never say about these two major talents. I can not imagine what they where thinking didn't anyone read the script??? I understand they were going for something different. Lucille wasn't playing LUCY and I respect that, but if it was not for my admiration of the talent involved I never would have finished this program, yes it was that bad.the set does have some great extras though,and it is worth the price for the Dean Martin special alone",1249862400,10,1142,4.243119266055046
3830408,5,B001ZXRGKS,"MPI's release of ""Lucy Gets Lucky"" and ""Three For Two"" is a great treat.  Both of these specials bring back a lot of memories. Of the two specials ""Lucy Gets Lucky"" is much more enjoyable.  It kind of reminds me of an hour long Here's Lucy episode.  The bonus features on this DVD are a must for any Lucy fan.  I especially enjoyed Lucy's radio series ""Let's Talk to Lucy"" from the 1960's.  Someone at CBS should release all episodes of this talk treat radio series.  It was a real treat listening to Lucy interview Dean Martin.  I look forward to the next four Lucy specials (""Happy Anniversary & Goodbye,"" ""What Now, Catherine Curtis,"" ""Lucy Calls The President,"" and ""Lucy Moves to NBC"") that MPI plans to release in the coming months.  Too bad that the 1964 Lucille Ball Comedy Special ""Mr. and Mrs."" and 1967 special ""Lucy In London"" are owned by CBS.  I would love for these two specials to be released in a boxed set.",1249257600,,924,4.4523809523809526

8348359,4,B001ZXRGKS,"If I had the ability to give this a 3.5 stars, I would have. Not because it's all worth 3.5, but because the ""Lucy Gets Lucky"" (with Dean Martin) special is so good, it is easily 4.5 - 5 stars. This could have been just a ""Here's Lucy"" special. although I did miss the laugh track (and it might have helped a
 bit), I find it to be an excellent post Lucy
series catalog edition.
Now for the not so good news... First, let me say that I am one of Jackie Gleason's and Lucy's biggest fans. In fact, I always liked Gleason much more than I liked Dean Martin... but rose-colored glasses do not shade what happen here, next.
 ""Three For Two"" is a collection of three one-act
plays, written by Joseph Bologna and his wife, Renee Taylor, are challenging for me. Honestly, Gleason is Gleason is Gleason. He played his
Kramden-esque character just fine, in Chapters 1 & 3. Lucy and the Great One do well together, in the first one (the one exception of there being a reference to Lucy's character being 45 years old... she was at least 65 at the time of filming. Her real age or something closer to it, could easily have been rewritten into the story). The 2nd & 3rd installments are just weak. I truly loved seeing them perform together (as it happened rarely), but this was neither of their best work. I still watch it, every so often... but wish I could review ""Lucky"" separately.",1419724800,,1374,4.3843137254901965
8348360,3,B001ZXRGKS,"Little disappointed in the writing and the plot of these. I'm a big fan of Lucy and wanted to see her acting with other heavyweights of that time period, but overall was pretty disappointed.",1412121600,,190,4.617647058823529
8348361,2,B001ZXRGKS,"After 3 stellar TV series, and some really great films, you'd think Lucille Ball would have had her pick of the best writers and directors for her TV specials. Yet, these two one-hour movies are really not up to the standard we expect for her. Why weren't her original writers employed to give her better shows?

""Lucy Gets Lucky"" is definitely the better of the two, as it plays like an extended episode of her sitcom - albeit with some rather familiar stock bits. Lucy and Dean Martin had a really nice chemistry together, and although this show is not laugh-out-loud funny (and the absence of an audience is a drawback), it does give Lucy a few fun bits of slapstick and the scenario is solid.

However, ""Three for Two"" is pretty awful. Made up three vignettes, I was surprised just how dull all three were. The first one (set in Rome) is tedious and corny. The second one, a very short scene, goes nowhere. And the third one seems endless and completely missing any entertaining qualities.

I think this DVD is worth having for ""Lucy Gets Lucky,"" to see Lucy and Dean Martin having fun again on location in Vegas. But honestly, it's a bit depressing to see the mediocre material Lucy had to work with at this point in her career. She was a legend - and she deserved much more imaginative and entertaining vehicles than these.",1408838400,,1329,4.552301255230126
8348362,3,B001ZXRGKS,"We have a nice collection out now of our dear Lucille Ball Specials, this is not my favourite however in saying that I still have it.",1405641600,,133,4.153846153846154
8348363,5,B001ZXRGKS,Lucy had a lot of wonderful shows and her talent is fantastic she was definitely one of a kind I would recommend thus to anyone who loves Lucy,1402963200,,142,4.107142857142857
