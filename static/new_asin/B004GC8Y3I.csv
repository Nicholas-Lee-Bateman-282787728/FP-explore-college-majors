And, small enough time increments you can squeeze into your day wherever your Mama time allows.  I highly recommend ALL the Mama video's but this one is the one to start with!  This is my 2nd of this particular dvd because I loaned this one out & never got it back!  The dvd came in a timely manner & packaged nicely.",1471910400,,430,4.325

8428611,5,B004GC8Y3I,"I am so glad that a friend told me about this workout!  I love that its short, intense and she is very encouraging along the way.  Starting to workout again after a baby is hard enough and she tells you to just enjoy your time and compliments you for just finding the time to workout.  This is actually a workout that I will stick with.  I have also done the Mama Wants her Booty Back and its tough, but good.  Great workout and a great price!",1334188800,8,443,4.104651162790698
