I have seen this movie twice and although some parts are pretty brutal it is a good ride.  This movie is no GodFather but is another good watch.  Not disappointed by this one but it is very brutal in some parts not for kids.",1386115200,,429,4.132530120481928
929493,2,6304762534,"Poorly made film - the writing seems to have good depth, but the filmmakers did a terrible job.  The acting sucks, cinematography sucks, and editing was horrible.  I know it's an old movie, but the quality seems bad even for that era.  Film editing didn't allow smooth transitions from scene to scene, it's hard to tell who the characters were, and the storyline was poorly translated into motion film.  The narration was the only that helped me understand what was going on.",1383868800,,475,4.7560975609756095

It can't be compared to the Inaccurate and Over the Top Godfather(What Cuban in history has ever blown himself up?and typical stereotypes)But it is worth watching even if it seems like a Bad TV Movie,there are some faces which later on are seen In The Sopranos and Mob Films and Typecasted as Such. I Saw this On netflix and it is not great but it is decent and goes to show the Story of Joe Bananas and the war between the Families over control and The Bonnano Family.

929496,4,6304762534,Had seen this many years ago as a TV movie and had been looking for it on DVD for quite a while. Glad to have finally found it.,1339718400,,127,3.5714285714285716
929497,2,6304762534,"Had it been made in 1953 or 1963 ""Honor Thy Father"" might be considered a great gangster film. But instead it was made in 1973, post ""Godfather"" (1972), and as such it is more of an embarrassment than a success, even though it was a TV movie.

The film is based on the critically acclaimed bestselling 1971 book by Gay Talese (1932), about the trials and tribulations of the Bonanno crime family in the 1960s.

The film stars Joseph Bolgona and Raf Vallone, as son and father, with Brenda Vaccaro as Joe's wife and Richard Castellano (he played Clemenza in ""The Godfather"") as one of Joe's senior aides.

(FWIW - This was only Bologna's second film. His best performance, IMHO, was in ""My Favorite Year"" (1982) where he played Sid Caesar. In that film he does a sketch about a mob boss, and I couldn't help but see that mob boss in his performance in this film. BTW - Caesar's mob boss was a caricature but Salvatore Bonano was not intended to be.)

The executive producer is Charles Fries who specialized in TV movies and made more than 100 of them, most of which are forgettable. Among his better ones were ""LBJ: The Early Years"" (1987), ""The Rosemary Clooney Story"" (1982), and ""The Neon Empire"" (1989),

Some might compare the film to an early version of ""The Sopranos"", which may be true, but as a film in the gangster genre it certainly doesn't hold up well when compared to ""The Godfather"" or ""Once Upon a Time in America"" (1984), or even to such lesser films as ""Mean Streets"" (1973), ""Goodfellas"" (1990),  ""A Bronx Tale"" (1993), or ""Casino"" (1995). All these films dealt, in one way or another, with the personalities and the family life of the mob, and all were able to provide a more satisfactory film experience. Of course, these other films were big screen releases, and TV movies in the 70s were far more limited in terms of what they could show.",1329696000,,1860,4.553892215568863
929498,4,6304762534,"[VHS Edition].

Small scale drama somewhat in the Godfather movie mold (Richard Castellano, at his fightin' weight here, about one year later), but has the bonus of being based upon a true story, not a composite, of sorts.

Has a Made For TV aura about it, however; a Reviewer adroitly noted the ""episodic"" nature, as if prepared for commercial inserts, at some point.

Father is Raf Vallone, an excellent character actor; as this Reviewer is not familiar with his career, I can only reference his performance as ""Harlow""s step-father in the movie with Carroll Baker and Angela Landsbury, not a memorable film; though Vallone again plays his part with realism and nuance - a late scene where he shows his son his grammar school report card is touching - could he have made it the honest way?

Joseph Bologna (Son) and Brenda Vaccaro (Son's Wife), have some strong scenes, often quite steamy, though these moments are marred to some extent by the now cultist nature of the film - there are several spots where you might expect a Leslie Neilson cameo. Unintentionally funny. The narration by Joseph Campanella is fine but by 2011 it seems superfluous.

Worth watching.",1301788800,,1166,4.8686868686868685
929499,3,6304762534,"The 1973 TV adaptation of Gay Talese's ""Honor Thy Father"" came in the wake of Coppola's THE GODFATHER. Obviously, ""Godfather"" is fiction that draws from real events while ""Honor"" is a fairly accurate portrayal of a real crime family, the Bonannos of New York.

As it originally had commercial breaks, this movie is rather episodic. The restrictions of 70s network TV means it's also fairly bloodless and lacks the colorful language heard in most mob pictures. Although hampered by these and a small budget, the excellent cast does a fine job in recreating NY Mafia history.

The Bononnos were one of the Five Families created in the wake of the Castellammarese War. At age 26, Joe Bonanno was youngest of the five family heads. His income derived then and prior to the War from gambling, loansharking, and racketeering.  When the absentee Joe later lost his capo regime status to Gaspar DiGregorio this caused the ""Banana Split,"" aka the Bonanno War.

This movie refers at times to the above, but is primarily the story of Joe's son Salvatore.

It is 100% accurate about the Bonnano family and the conflict it had with the commission in the 60s! The movie uses all the real names (Gambino, Produce, Gallo and etc) and it is very Kool to watch a movie that was the true history of a mafia event! The film itself is a little poor but remember this movie was made in 1973. Which is very interesting since the movie has Carlo Gambino in it and he was very much alive at the time. Which !makes me wonder if Joseph Bonnano STILL was a power house even after the commission took his family in 1968! A very true and interesting movie!",1469232000,,726,4.192857142857143
