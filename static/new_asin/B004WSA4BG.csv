4489110,5,B004WSA4BG,"Jim Marrs is a 5 but David Icke is a 10.  Icke connects the dots of the totalitarian tip-toe.  The goal of the real leaders behind our perceived leaders is a one government world - one currency, one bank and the ultimate enslavement of most of the world's people.  Think it couldn't happen?  Watch this video.",1361318400,5,309,4.464285714285714
4489111,5,B004WSA4BG,"There is no way for me to review this video that would do it any justice. David Icke is an amazing orator, almost in a class of his own. for starters , this video is over 4 hours long. most of the talking heads on the tv, read from a teleprompter for a few minutes, and have no belief one way or the other on what they are saying. David Icke blows all of these pompous arses out of the water. buy this dvd, buy any of Davids dvds or books, you will not be dissapointed.",1348012800,6,469,3.8958333333333335
4489112,5,B004WSA4BG,"Excellent DVD that should be treated as educational, not entertaining. David Icke is a phenomenal speaker and anyone who is open, ready and willing to live a new way of life, outside of bondage and the current system that is not serving the greater good would greatly benefit from this DVD.

I encourage anyone who is interested in this DVD to listen to the message and see if what is said resonates with them, for it has some amazing material. It should not be about whether we like Icke or not, or agree with everything he says. The point is that here is a man courageous to go out there, not care about popularity and share a message of inspiring each to a life of freedom which is our birthright. Unfortunately we forgot this.

Super inspirational and motivational in my opinion!!!!",1319760000,19,786,4.567375886524823
4489113,1,B004WSA4BG,"If you haven't noticed, the large emergence of the conspiracy culture has created several conspiracy mini-celebrities, like David Icke. Matter of fact, Icke is the arguably the star of extraterrestrial conspiracies globally.

How this has happened over the span of his career SHOULD DEFINITELY be looked into. It is difficult not to conclude that he is a plant being used to associate real and important documented conspiracies with ""looney"" extraterrestrial concepts. He is one of many tools used to destroy credibility of anyone associated with publicizing real conspiracies.

This man definitely has friends in high places for all of the wrong reasons. Please don't be duped because not all of his content is polluted with the garbage he is intended to be associated with. If you have any more interest, Youtube search ""David Icke debunked"". You will notice a long video with a horrible ratings, but I think the ratings are bogus and are there as an intentional deterrent(it just doesn't deserve that rating). This man has friends in high places...",1315958400,10,1051,5.140350877192983
4489114,5,B004WSA4BG,"OMG! After watching it myself, I showed this DVD to my parents.  I thought that they would get upset and turn off the TV LOL but instead I watched them for the full four hours completely entranced by David Icke and his incredible message.  You can't imagine the thrill of seeing them wake up for the first time and see the world as it really is.  From here on I'm not going to get into any more arguments with people about the elites and who starts the wars and stuff like that.  All I have to do now is give them this DVD and they will see the truth.  Thanks David Icke!  Thanks Sacred Mysteries!",1306022400,27,597,4.147826086956521
4489115,5,B004WSA4BG,"This is the best David Icke video yet released.  I have been a fan of his for a while now but  watching him reduce his ideas to a mere four hours in truly illuminating.  The video is divided into two parts ""Knowledge"" and ""Revolution"" as the title suggests.  For the first two hours Icke, with all of his wit and wisdom intact, regales us with a blow by blow account of our secret rulers and what they are doing to the human race.  This part is often painful as Icke exposes many of the mainstream shills whose machinations divert us from the truth.  Normally the information presented would make one want to run for cover but instead Icke masterfully changes the subject over the next two hours.

The second part which is concerned with ""Revolution"" or how to stop these criminals is the best part of the presentation.  In this segment Icke shows us that a violent rebellion will never work and that instead we have to solve the problems in a spiritual way.  Love indeed conquers all and is the path towards the liberation of the human spirit.  This is Icke's most metaphysical presentation, it is penetrating, sometimes funny but always a compelling narrative.  Well worth the time this is one great DVD.",1306022400,39,1206,4.588785046728972

8445662,1,B004WSA4BG,"This is not a review of this product. The actual video might be interesting to the proper audience. This is to let people know that my art was used without permission on the cover of this product. I've tried to either get compensation or have it discontinued, but I have been unsuccessful in my attempts. That is my 3D rendered image in the background behind Mr. Icke. I am not saying he is aware of this and did nothing, but I contacted the publishers of this video and they failed to make any effort to remove the image from this packaging or properly compensate me for the use of my art. I find that rather upsetting. The fact that it was used without permission would seem to go agains the mindset they promote. I would hope they would have a better ethic than that.

8445667,4,B004WSA4BG,"This is a great video. The first part is especially informative to those who wish to know more about why things are the way they are, and there are some things that may not be known to those that are already aware...The second video is a must see for all peoples, not only of Amerika, but the rest of the world as well...I gave it 4 stars, only because I wish that the script of quotes that were displayed on the screen, would have been left up there long enough to read, instead of having to hear the rest of them verbalized only. Icke is the best,and probably has more knowledge than anyone on this subject. I highly recommend this dvd to everyone in the world. Awesome!",1397088000,3,672,4.299212598425197

8445670,5,B004WSA4BG,"If you are new to David Icke I recommend watching 'Freedom Road' first.  It provides a bit more information than contained in this DVD and I think he presents the information a little better without a live audience.  That is it not to imply that he isn't a compelling and accomplished presenter in front of a live audience; he is.  Ultimately, it really doesn't matter if you watch 'Radical Truth' first or instead you really can't go wrong.

What David Icke does very well is to take research from many different fields and connect the dots to provide a powerful and compelling narrative.  You don't have to believe every single detail  to accept the overall theme.  David Icke makes this clear.  Regardless of how much of the presentation you choose to believe it will challenge if not change your worldview.  Thankfully there are David Ickes in this world prepared to endure public ridicule just to get the message of freedom out.",1364515200,7,933,4.745341614906832
