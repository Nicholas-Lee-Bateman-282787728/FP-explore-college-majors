1894599,5,B00009WVLJ,"This DVD was wonderful. It's not meant to be real, it's just X-men for the next generation, those who don't remember the comics or the original cartoon. It's for kids. The stories are amusing, and the romantic subtext between certain characters makes me giggle (I look for the romance in *everything*, even the back of a cheerios box... it's sad...). The added scenes that WB didn't think were mature enough for original airing were also a nice perk. I plan to collect the entire series. See you Volume 2!",1089936000,,505,4.685393258426966
1894600,5,B00009WVLJ,"It's certainly true that X-Men: Evolution is toned down in terms of violence.  It's aimed more for PG-13, not R as the other rater seems to want.
But it's still an excellent show, and anyone who can enjoy the movies should certainly enjoy the animated series.  If you hated the movies due to inaccuracies with the comic books then you won't like this series either.  The characters in the series are nearly identical to the ones from the movies, with the exception of Nightcrawler.  In the movies, he was blue and covered with self-inflicted tattoo scarring.  In the series he's blue, fuzzy and lighthearted.  Wolverine, Cyclops, Xavier, Magneto, etc, are characters you'll be immediately familiar with from the movies.
Is this a show intended to capture the attention of X-Men comic book loyalists?  Probably not.
It's a show about a group of young people coming into mutant powers who find themselves thrust into the role of superhero.... or supervillian, depending on if they chose to join the X-Men or ally with Magneto.  The animation style is colorful and contemporary, the voice acting is excellent, there's enough action and laughs to entertain the younger crowd and enough character development and plotline to keep an older crowd entertained as well.  It's X-Men in a format friendly enough for primetime.  The character interactions are much richer than you typically find in animated superhero shows and it's just an all around great show.
Like any book (or comic book) converted to film, don't get so hung up on what got changed or ""left out"" and this will be a series you can really enjoy.
Also, check out the boxed set which has all of season 1.",1064188800,6,1660,4.8546099290780145
1894601,5,B00009WVLJ,This has to be the best X men evelution movie ever! I am a huge fan of the X men evelution program and am very thankful that you finnally made a movie. Thank you very much!!!!!,1057104000,,176,3.9166666666666665
1894602,4,B00009WVLJ,"X-Men: Evolution is my favorite cartoon on tv right now, with good reason.
Unexpected Changes contains the first three episodes of this awesome series. In the first, Strategy X, Scott's powers are accidently unleashed at a football game while tying to defend another mutant named Todd. Meanwhile, Kurt Wagner adjusts to life at the Xavier Institute, with some interesting results. In The X-Impulse, Kitty Pryde's powers develop one night, and she meets Lance, a fellow mutant who will be a very important figure in her life even after they're recruited to opposite sides. In the final episode, Rogue Recruit, a young goth named Rogue develops a dangerous power with unlimited possibilities, and Mystique makes sure she'll never join the X-Men.
While these episodes aren't as good as some of the one's in the second season, it's a strong start to a cool show. The animation is lovely, the music is catchy, and the characters are great. I highly recommend X-Men: Evolution!",1030924800,,971,5.037267080745342
1894603,5,B00009WVLJ,"I found this show acidently on the telly, the first thing that caught my eye was the animation.  It is splendid and adorable!  you don't lose any of the chaceters you love, but theres a new twist to some of them that make it really enjoyable for even us old comic-book fans!  For you Nightcrawler lovers look no futher! it doesnt get any elf-yer then this. really a great show and more then worth buying for your everday enjoyment!

1894604,5,B00009WVLJ,"Can't go wrong liking this new series from Marvel. Not exactly true to the comics, but who needs to hear the same stories again and again? This is all new good stuff and worthwhile to get hooked on. It got me back into X-Men and Marvel again. Beautiful nearly-like-anime art and animation too, buy this for the perfect audio and picture quality and just because it has Nightcrawler in it. If they didn't have NC in this series, it would flop like a dead fish. All hail to the fuzzy German elf!:) Don't miss the 2nd season coming out in Sept and the comic as well!",998956800,4,563,4.320754716981132
1894605,4,B00009WVLJ,"This video is the first 3 episodes of the new series.. It introduces most of the characters, and gives good insight into the younger years of the X-Men. I would reccomend it to all fans, over the original animated series.",987379200,7,221,4.55

7993745,5,B00009WVLJ,Again I am a major nerd - used to watch this show on KIDS WB on Saturday mornings with a big bowl of cereal and the box and jug of milk by my legs. LOL! Its toned down due to it was geared towards kids - only draw back: it wasn't all packaged together like S3 which was all one set and they STILL have not realeased S4 on DVD! I love X-Men anyways!,1386288000,,348,3.7162162162162162
7993746,5,B00009WVLJ,Purchased was made for my son's birthday who loves the early 2000 series.  Looked for this copy at stores and only could get it thru Amazon. Product is in excellent condition and arrived in time for his birthday.,1379462400,,212,4.578947368421052
7993747,5,B00009WVLJ,"I first encountered this series as a child and since then have kept a sweet place for it in my mind. I always enjoyed the re-runs and watched all of the seasons with avid passion. For anyone who doesn't know what X-Men Evolution is all about, it follows the chronicles of everybody's young favorite mutant as they travel through awkward teen years/high school/ and the discovery of their mutant powers. For anyone yearning to rediscover favorite characters I highly recommend this. Excellent animation, loved the storylines and character portraits. Once I heard that this wonderful series had not only been taken off the air, but been taken off the market, I ran to Amazon because I knew I had to find it. Reasonable pricing, arrived ahead of due date in great condition.
I enjoyed rediscovering this fun series and although perhaps aimed at a younger audience, there is a beautiful depth to many of the on-screen characters (Rogue, Nightcrawler and Scarlett Witch, to name a few). A must-have.",1332720000,,994,4.9226190476190474
7993748,4,B00009WVLJ,"Liked this revisionist take on the teen Xmen going to a regular high school and trying to fit in while living at the Xmansion.  Good stories, art, and voice acting kept the quality up and the high school atmosphere ensured a lot of jokey humor.",1287619200,,244,4.4222222222222225
7993749,5,B00009WVLJ,"This is the dvd that contains the launch episodes for X-men Evolution.  An excellent beginning to a series full of excellent storylines, fun episodes and plenty of action.  I consider this a well done work of art and would suggest it to anyone.",1273190400,,244,4.651162790697675
7993750,4,B00009WVLJ,"Good start to a fun new story with the X-Men characters.  Don't go in expecting it to stay true to past stories, and you'll probably like it.  Fun new series for any Marvel or X-Men fan.",1256256000,,186,4.138888888888889
7993751,1,B00009WVLJ,"Where's Ice-Man?

Ice-Man has been a quintessential part of the X-men since their creation.  Yet, he's no where to be found here.  Instead he's been replaced with ""Spyke,"" nephew of Storm.

There's no reason for this substitute except for ""diversity"" and this unnecessary change really lessens the quality of the story.

I'm a huge Ice-Man fan.  I was greatly disappointed by this series.",1247616000,,388,5.079365079365079
