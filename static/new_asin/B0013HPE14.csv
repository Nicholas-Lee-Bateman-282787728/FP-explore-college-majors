I found this DVD very inspiring and watch it over and over, especially the part where he urges you never to give up on your dreams.

Also, I found the bonus of this DVD to be the part all about how to build a great team.",1205712000,2,368,3.945945945945946
8354581,5,B0013HPE14,"We all experience times when we just want to give up.  Starbucks Howard Schultz talks about the importance of persistence in reaching your goals, which is something that all successful people have in common.

Very motivating!",1202083200,,225,5.222222222222222
