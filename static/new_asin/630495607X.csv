943355,5,630495607X,"i first saw ""GOOD TIMES""on abc-tv back in 1974 and it impressed me as a 10yr. oldwith its pre=Mtv styled songs,pre-Sonny and Cher show dialogue,pre-Seinfeld about nothing,and the dream sequences of Sonny as the  down on his luck sheriff,jungle man,and detective. Cher shines in her witty  remarks about doing the movie and brilliantly directed videos.for me this  will always be my ""gone with the wind"",which is #2 on my list.so  get the movie and its soundtrack and a younger Sonny AND  CHER.~RICK  SOLIMINI(4-10-00)",955324800,2,517,5.168674698795181

943465,4,630495607X,This movie is such a riot because it is so dated and corny but lots of fun.  I remember seeing it when I was younger and couldn't wait to see it again for an evening of nostalgia and music.,1398988800,,189,3.8461538461538463

943467,4,630495607X,"AS mid-60s rock films go, this may have been the best. By '66-'67 Elvis' movies, never quite ""A"" movies, were looking like ""Z"" movies; beach movies were beach movies, some were better than others. The Beatles did well with ""Help!"" but it was no ""Hard Days Night"". Most of those pictures today succeed as enjoyable camp - this one has very little ""dating"".

The movie is a bit draggy but consider that all songs are excellent - and even more important, Cher eats up each frame. Stunningly beautiful, somehow her talent for comedy and light drama did not really penetrate at the time - it was still The Guy Who Looks Like Ringo, Writes cool songs, and Has a hot wife.

The movie is really a series of sketches and actually is the perfect precursor to their wildly successful TV show of the 1970s. Cher is always one step ahead of her man, wittily keeping him off balance. She has a different wardrobe for almost every scene and looks amazing in each. This was about 7 years before that show!

The whole movie really takes place in Sonny's imagination...he agrees to make a movie for mogul George Sanders, is given one week to basically rewrite the trashy script thrown at the team. He plays Jungle Boy, Hip Detective, Gunslinger, etc., in his head....and so we wonder what will wind up on celluloid...within celluloid. Sanders appears in all the [day] dream sequences, as well. Nice touch! He seems to enjoy the occasional lunacy. Character actor Phil Arnold is terrific, as the decidedly uninspired ""suit"" who writes the ""screenplay""; Hank Worden, known as John Wayne's slow-talkin' friend, Ole Mose Harper, in ""The Searchers"", has a very funny scene with Sonny; Mickey Dolenz is in jungle gear, uncredited.

I should add that in addition to the film being a true prototype for the TV show...it just might have wrought something called MTV.

943468,5,630495607X,Accurate description of product. It arrived in excellent condition and proved to be a wonderful gift. Completely satisfied with purchase!,1363219200,,137,5.9
943469,4,630495607X,"Fans of the old ""Sonny and Cher Show"" will love this movie.  ""Good Times"" pretty much follows the formula of the TV program with comedy sketches bookending musical numbers.  The sketches here are mildly amusing but not particularly memorable.  The songs, composed and arranged by Sonny, are terrific.  They have kind of a Spectorish feel to them.  Cher wears outrageous outfits that are more Austin Powers than Bob Mackie.  I think the selling point of the movie is its positive vibes.  Sonny and Cher were married at the time and their love for each other is apparent.  We're not breaking cinematic ground here but just having good times.",1358467200,2,639,4.851851851851852
943470,5,630495607X,"I saw this movie shortly after it came out, in 1968, while I was in the U.S.Navy.  I loved it then and was later able to buy the soundtrack album.  I always liked the great music and never forgot the film.  I finally got my first big flat screen TV and out of curiosity recently looked on Amazon to see if this film was even available on DVD.  It was and it was only $5.99 so I ordered it, along with some other 'old' favorites and I was thrilled with it again.  It was so much fun to see Sonny and Cher young again (my goodness, Cher NEVER seems to have aged!), and the music videos were FABULOUS!  I've watched them over and over!  This film is on my 'favorites' list of my over 1000 DVD collection!  Great, fun film!!  And the DVD quality is excellent, as it was produced by the original production company, not some secondary production house!  5 STARS!",1316044800,3,857,4.234567901234568
943471,5,630495607X,"Watched this movie 3 times after I got it. And as a devoted Sonny & Cher fan of the 70's it was nice to see what they were working on in their early career development years.

943532,3,630495607X,"OK. So this is a movie about Sonny and Cher making a movie. And it has Sonny and Cher in it.

You can sure tell this is a 1960s movie. The clothes look as if they were all made by demented monkeys working with remaindered material. Some of the cinematic effects are bizarre. The plot, such as it is, involves a kind of unholy pact to get a movie done. I can only assume Sonny and Cher signed on the dotted line.

It's not to say that there isn't some funny scenes. The commentary on the film industry is biting. The fantasy pieces were OK. Amazingly, the music isn't that good, which is bizarre as you would think this movie would have been written to highlight Sonny and Cher's talents.

The thing is, this is so campy that it's hard not to like it.",1265414400,,750,4.194444444444445
943533,5,630495607X,"I love this movie for the sillyness. This movie is classic Sonny and Cher comedy, only with a slightly larger budget than the TV show. There is nothing too outstanding about this movie, but it is a must for any Sonny and Cher fans, or if you are just looking for a movie you can sit back, relax, and watch without having to pay too much attention to it. I believe the term for that is ""Mind fluff"".

Also see ""Chastity"" starring Cher.",1242259200,,434,4.228915662650603
943534,5,630495607X,"Absolutely ""loved"" this.  Memories of Sonny and Cher in the ""good ole days"".  Enjoy this more today than I would have years ago.  Will probably look for more like this.  Definitely ""Nostalgia!""  A must for anyone's collection.",1241740800,,226,5.0
943535,1,630495607X,"I bought this for my wife who was a big fan of the TV show, and we watched it together with our 5-yr. old, expecting an evening of '60s silliness and perhaps a few good songs. By the time we were half-way into the movie, our daughter couldn't handle the excessive, gratuitous violence, and neither my wife or I could figure out how William Friedkin (director of The French Connection, The Exorcist, and other immensely successful films) could have directed this atrocity. The script is terrible, and Sonny and Cher appear to be sleep-walking their way through it. They obviously knew something about comedic timing, as their hugely successful show demonstrated, so how could this movie have turned out so bad, with acting so flat? The story itself, the making of a film within the film, may hold the clue: Cher did not really want to make this movie, so it is thus Sonny Bono's vanity project. In the plot line, Sonny demands that if a S&C movie is made, he have total artistic control; if this is in fact true of this abominable film, then it was a gigantic mistake. Sonny Bono was a businessman in hippie clothes, as his true identity emerged as a conservative Republican congressman in the 1980s. But he was absolutely talentless as a singer, and mediocre at best as a songwriter - proof of the latter is that Cher's best work came after the break-up of the duo. The violence in the movie may be more the product of Friedkin's handiwork, as he may have reluctantly agreed to directing this mess, but it is inexplicable and pointless all the same. There is definitely a streak of  mean-spiritedness that runs through the script, and isn't helped by Sonny's somnabulent delivery and Cher's abject boredom throughout. Veteran actor George Sanders is the only one able to acquit himself in the movie somewhat, but just barely, by playing to type as a heavy.
  As is obvious from all the positive Amazon reviews of ""Good Times"", diehard Sonny and Cher buffs may like this piece of violent silliness for its nostalgic content, but for the initiate who wants to understand what all the fuss was about, stick to the television show compilations. At least they are better scripted, by far.",1232323200,,2183,4.709424083769633
943536,4,630495607X,"..since we do not have(or have not been released) live performances of the early Sonny & Cher, this movie gives you some idea what that period was about (1964-1967)..the music is interesting & some of the jokes are good, but the script is too broad of a humor unto & like the Monkees..however, it is great to see them perform & be themselves at a very young age & stage",1184371200,2,369,4.285714285714286
943537,5,630495607X,"This movie like everything else of Sonny & Cher was made before it's time.  When the film first came out it did not do good but some 40 years later so many of Sonny & Cher fans are purchasing this film even with it's not so good reviews. I loved the scenary in the beginning of the film with all of it's beauty.  Great to see Sonny & Cher play themselves.  They were so young and so in love.  You can feel their love by watching the movie.  It has it's corney scenes when Sonny is day dreaming but but it also has cute scenes of them changing into different costumes.  I loved the singing, it brought back so many memories of the dynamic duo.  My favorite part was the ending where they show how much they love each other and Sonny risks everything to make Cher happy and to stick by their principals.  In the end love is all that matters.  Sonny & Cher was America's favorite couple and there will never be any other couple that can compare or take their place. If you are a Sonny & Cher fan you have to get this DVD.  It is a treasure. So young and so in love, this is  the beginning of the Sonny & Cher craze. I agree with the previous person, the movie needed a commentary of either Cher or the late and very missed Sonny Bono.",1102204800,6,1231,4.0875
943538,5,630495607X,"My Mom took to the drive-in theater when I was 13 years old to see this movie.  I loved it of course, being a fan of Sonny & Cher since the ""Caesar & Cleo"" year before!  This film gives us a glimpse into the beginnings of Sonny & Cher/Cher, who go on to become nearly legendary in the entertainment world.  It was the first time anyone who loved S & C's music to ""see"" them, doing more than singing, where for the most part Cher just stood there, wonderful of course, but certainly not the proven superstar she has become.  Who would think 40 years could go by so fast.  The film is a delight for me to watch today.  It is simply a charming little film, done with all the production their budget would allow!  Actually, the film itself, basically ignored when released, is put together quite well.  Director William Friedkin (The Exorcist, The French Connection)  obviously put his heart and soul in the making of this little movie, starring, of all people, Sonny & Cher.  Many many ""Good Times"" were to follow......",1092787200,7,1016,4.4728260869565215
943539,4,630495607X,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this movie when I first viewed it.  I ended up being pleasantly surprised.  It's certainly watchable and a fun period piece.  Sixties fans will get a kick out of seeing scenes of Sonny and Cher going around town and the brief concert footage that is shown at the beginning of the film.
The plot concerns Sonny accepting an offer to make a film but Cher doesn't feel it's the right thing to do.  Sonny images them in a Western, a Jungle picture (watch for Micky Dolenz from the Monkees in a quick cameo!), and a detective drama.  The duo find the time to sing a couple of songs, including an accoustic version of ""I Got You Babe"".
Cher has almost as many wardrobe changes during this film as Natalie Portman does in the Star Wars films.  The director (William Friedkin) seems to have some sort of weird obsession about the scene where Cher is dressed as a (kind of creepy) clown.  It's shown TWICE in flashback form.  It also appears that character actor Paul Frees did a lot of (uncredited) voice overs for this film.  If you like Paul Frees, you'll get to hear a lot of him in this movie.
The DVD contains a fairly clean print and it is presented in widesceen format.  The color booklet contains a short plot summary and lists the chapters.  Anchor Bay released this with no extras.  A trailer, bios, and photo gallery would have been a nice plus.  Captions would have been appreciated too.  It's too bad that Sonny is gone because I think he could've recorded an interesting audio commentary track for this film.
If you or someone you know enjoys music and films from the sixties, by all means check this out.",1026172800,24,1651,4.46
943540,5,630495607X,"This is such a colorful, whimsical video that it shows the beginning of the struggles & climbs and the raw talent & determination both Sonny & Cher had early on. It has various skits meshed into a movie that highlights both singing and Cher solo too, shows personalities & love toward eachother, clothing styles outasite,segments actually shot in their first home amid the fanciful 60's, at a time when producers really tried to do things their way. Segments include Sonny as bumbling sheriff, spy & Tarzan-type, carousel scene & show S & C as independent innovates, who vow to continue to value love over any dumb movie.",995414400,8,621,4.813084112149533
943541,5,630495607X,"If you dig Sonny and Cher, then you'll dig this movie filled with groovy threads and great music. Sonny and Cher are a blast to watch as they fantasize about being big shot movie stars after being contracted to make a movie together. Sonny is crazy for the idea, while Cher finds it tedious to the point that she wants no part. Sonny tries to come up with a plot for this movie (failing at every attempt) as Cher continually puts her two cents in, which consist of tongue-in-cheek put-downs. The fact that this movie involves Sonny trying to come up with a plot for the movie they have been contracted to make is kind of ironic since this movie itself has no real plot, just a bunch of enjoyable slapstick comedy. You will laugh your way through their goofy movie spoofs and sing along with their catchy tunes. My favorite spoof has got to be the one where Sonny plays Tarzan, jungle cry and all. He even has a close call with a lion he wrestles. . . yikes! What were they thinking not using a stuntman? Incidentally, several scenes were filmed in Sonny and Cher's home due to budget restraints. This movie picks up on the chemistry between then husband and wife, which I think might have sparked the idea for ""The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour"". For some inoffensive and fun-loving humor, watch this!",974419200,6,1298,4.481012658227848
