This Lugosi documentary is one of the finest I've ever seen with some very interesting and new information for fans of the great underappreciated actor. If your a fan, this is a no brainer. It's a bit pricey, but I think it's worth it. I bid you......Velcome!",1207612800,4,356,4.492307692307692

1857576,4,B00008PX5P,"I have seen or own many of the film documentaries on Bela Lugosi and this, by far, is the best.  I also like the fact that they added some of his radio appearances on a separate disc.  Maybe this same group will have future docu-movies on other actors from the classic days of mystery and thrills.",1193961600,4,297,4.285714285714286

1857582,4,B00008PX5P,"Here's a real treat for Lugosi fans--an in-depth, fascinating, and utterly entertaining hour featuring lots of previously-unseen material.  The clips from his early silent films are beautifully restored, and left this reviewer with a strong urge to see the complete films.  There's an impressive array of interviews with former co-stars and friends, and some surprisingly clear interviews with the star himself (some of these also appear on Roan's excellent ""White Zombie"" disc).
I was also impressed by the sometimes hallucinatory editing style--often a rapid succession of film clips set to spooky music--that made the documentary every bit as entertaining as watching one of Bela's movies.
If I have one minor gripe, it's that a large amount of ""deleted scenes"" could have been editing back into the feature.  Most of them are expanded interviews and clips from particular films.  I'm sure the decision was made to cut these extra scenes for reasons of pacing or time.  But a true Lugosi fan would not only NOT mind the extra padding, he (or she) would most likely appreciate it.  It's a minor point, because of course you can access all these extra scenes from the main menu.
Order this one, you won't be disappointed.",1066435200,23,1222,5.054726368159204
1857583,5,B00008PX5P,"Gary D. Rhodes textured portrait of a film icon is quite good. Besides an in-depth look at his Hollywood rise and fall, yuo can view Bela Lugosi's oldest existing film, a brief fragment of Hungary's ""Struggle for Life(1918). You see scenes from ""Dance of the Volcano(German/1920)"" and a good, restored sequence from perhaps his earliest American film role in ""Midnight Girl(1925)"", an otherwise slow and tedious movie. A wonderfully restored interview from 1932(at his home) and several other special features(including a first-time interview with his last and fifth wife(shortly before her cancer-caused death) are real bonuses. It's a two-disc marathon, and even features previously unknown radio broadcasts(five), including a dark diatribe against facism in 1944 that belies his left-wing, pro-communist leanings. For the Lugosi fan, this cannot be missed.",1049241600,30,859,5.666666666666667

7986257,5,B00008PX5P,"Gary Don Rhodes' tireless pursuit of Lugosi facts has produced a wonderful documentary. If it's rare Lugosi you're after, also check out Amazon's ""Red Skelton - The Early Years"". It features a 1954 show with Bela, Lon Chaney, Jr. & Vampira! Exceedingly rare & cool. Mr. Rhodes' books on Bela Lugosi are also very well written and researched. Highest recommendation!",1438646400,,365,5.1
7986258,5,B00008PX5P,"Excellent documentary, with beautiful extras ( Including an interview with Hope Lininger, Lugosi's fifth wife - The only interview she ever gave!), deleted scenes and a bonus cd with Lugosi's radio performances from the 30's and 40's. Highly recommended for fans!",1437955200,,263,5.439024390243903
7986259,5,B00008PX5P,"This is one amazing documentary of the life of Bela Lugosi, the man who played the first Dracula on film in 1930, only to go on to a roller-coaster of a career. Many lost details of Lugosi's life and career are brought to light here, including film fragments and stills from his earliest film projects, and interviews with people who knew him personally. Released in 1999 and written, directed, and including comments from noted Lugosi scholar Gary Rhodes, Lugosi: Hollywood's Dracula holds up as a worthy insight into the life and career of one of classic cinema's greatest icons. Included in addition to this almost hour-long presentation is a rare filmed interview with Bela's fifth wife, Hope, and a bonus CD of 1940s radio appearances by the great Bela Lugosi! A worthy addition to anyone's Lugosi collection!",1427760000,,814,4.9489051094890515

7986262,2,B00008PX5P,"I'm not sure why this documentary has garnered such rave reviews, because it's not that good--especially for the out-of-print prices being charged.  There is a far superior documentary on Lugosi produced by A&E Biography as part of their set entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heroes-of-Horror/dp/B0000C23H4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heroes of Horror</a>.  The reason for the two stars is simply for the extras.  Firstly, the quality of the print of the 1932 interview with Lugosi by Dorothy West for Intimate Interviews is incredibly good.  Also, there is a second audio disc of radio shows by Lugosi that are quite good.

But the documentary itself suffers from poor writing, and bad interviews.  The A&E Bio has a lot more relevant interviews, especially with Bela Jr.  Just one example:  In the A&E Bio there is a considerable amount of time devoted to the fact that Lugosi had to fight pretty hard to get the film role of Dracula, something that is simply glossed over in this version.  The only thing this one seems to have over the A&E is the fact that they seem to have dredged up, literally, every known photograph of Lugosi from his early, Hungarian, days.

If you've been wanting this but don't like the price, don't worry.  Skip it and purchase the A&E Biography.",1301961600,4,1325,5.291866028708134
7986263,4,B00008PX5P,"I am a huge Bela Lugosi fan. This is a very well done and interesting documentary. Yet, I find it hard to watch becasue I love lugosi, and am hurt to see the hard road life was for him.",1277078400,,185,3.769230769230769
7986264,5,B00008PX5P,"i have waited for a documentary about horror legend bela lugosi for so long and now it's here on dvd for the first time. gary don rhodes has done a brilliant job.
 i particularly like the background music that was selected for the programme and the early photos of the man himself(most of which were previously unseen i would say). all the highlights are here: lugosi's early theatre experiences, his world war one experiences and of course, his breakthrough role that would make his name - dracula.
 the special features are plentiful: extra interviews along with those that were given by lugosi. only negative point here is the interview given by his last wife. talk about a cold fish: from the outset, it became rather obvious that she wasn't interested in making a contribution to the documentary. she didn't exactly go out of her way in expressing any love or respect for her late husband(what sort of marriage could they have had?). what with being so cold, disinterested and sometimes offensive, i'm surprised her ""interview"" made it to the dvd release at all! still, only a minor problem.
 the other seperate interviews are much more interesting and insightful. the bonus footage of lugosi in a foreign short film is intriguing if rather brief. altogether, there must be at least another hour's worth of footage. the other dvd includes very good bonus radio performances and interviews that are a treasure for any lugosi fan.
 i just hope fellow horror legend boris karloff is given the same treatment in time to come.",1235952000,5,1526,4.857692307692307
