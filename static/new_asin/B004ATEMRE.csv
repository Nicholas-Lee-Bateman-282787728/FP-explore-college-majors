I had to rip the DVDs to put it on the iPad since the format needed conversion.  Would prefer to download directly from the Internet .",1375228800,,250,4.413043478260869
8420846,5,B004ATEMRE,"I've got this collection after I originally bought the Indian to Girdwood DVD separately.  The disk for Hills South of Anchorage didn't seem to be availale as a separate disk at the time so this seemed the best way to get the other two rides from the collection I didn't already have.

The three rides in the collection are all different enough to make each unique.  Some of the video is dark and the resolution can suffer a bit due to the low sun and grey skies, but this is Alaska so that comes with the territory.  Focusing on the rides themselves takes me into Alaska and makes the workouts fly by.  You will knock off a half hour before you even realize you have started, then the next half hour is gone before you think of time again.  Of course, you will be feeling the workout by this time if you are following the stats on the dashboard.

I find the dashboard concept against scenery from a real ride much more useful than a spin instructor yelling directions to me over loud music in some sort of fitness room.  The scenery distracts and entertains me enough that I don't even realize I'm on a spin bike and I am seriously motivated to keep up with the RPM and heart rate goals displayed.  These videos by Paul are really the only ones that motivate me to ride a spin bike more than a few minutes.  Not only do they motivate me, but I look forward to the next time I ride to them similar to an actual ride outside.  Perhaps more since these video rides are in Alaska!",1351814400,,1477,4.276978417266187

I grew up in Alaska, so I was extremely excited to virtually ride around my old stomping ground. I originally downloaded the video and, though the workout was great, I didn't love the ""grainy"" video (compression issue). I really wanted to experience the visual beauty in addition to the workout. I spoke to Paul and he suggested that I give the DVD a shot instead. I did exactly that and there was a significant difference in the experience. These videos are awesome! I have never had so much fun riding in my basement at 5:00am.

Indian to Girdwood
Of the Alaska Collection, this was my favorite ride. Though the lighting was a little grey, the views of the Chugach Mountains more than made up for it. Riding on the bike path for the whole ride was a fun experience. It is amazing that almost 2 hours flys by so quickly when you are engaged in the ride. Usually I can't stand more than 45 minutes on the trainer, but this totally changes that. Great ride!

Anchorage to Eagle River
I love this ride. When I was in 6th grade at Rabbit Creek Elementary in Anchorage, our priciple took our class on this exact ride. That was my first experience on a long bike ride. Nostalgia aside, this ride was a blast! The hills are great, the scenery is awesome and the workout is engaging and fun. I highly recommend it.",1318896000,,1326,4.475206611570248
8420849,5,B004ATEMRE,"After riding these workouts a number of times now I have such a yearning to go to Alaska and see that beautiful state.  My favorite of the 3 is the Extreme Calorie Burner because of the beautiful trail you ride on the whole time and its not as intense as other rides.  Training to Endure is very fast paced and Training to Climb is one I have difficulty with.  There is one section in the workout no matter how hard I try I just can't keep up with Paul.  He rides up a hill like he is riding down it.  I don't know how he does it!!  I will keep trying though, my challenge is to at least get up this one hill as fast as Paul.",1300406400,,625,3.8818897637795278
8420850,5,B004ATEMRE,"I own this one and the colorado ride and find that the workout is done before you know it because of the immersion level. All the feedback you need with gear, tension for spin, heart rate ect. Good product.",1295395200,,206,4.3076923076923075
