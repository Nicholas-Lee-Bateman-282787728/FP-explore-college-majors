4904067,4,B005Y1C3TQ,"This season in review DVD gives more details of the 2004 Red Sox than the official MLB 2004 World Series DVD.

For the Sox fan who wants to review the turning points of the season such as the Veritek/A-Rod fight, the Nomar trade and the August hot streak, this DVD fits perfectly.

The historic comeback in the ALCS is showcased nicely. Some of the footage that shown in the World Series DVD is also used here, but it is nice to see it used in a different context.

Also, there is no mention of the alleged ""Curse"" except for a quote from Johnny Damon.

It's a great DVD and an excellent gift for a Sox fan who can no longer be called ""long suffering.""

4904068,4,B005Y1C3TQ,"This DVD is produced by NESN, and as a result it has coverage of the entire, incredible 2004 championship season of the Boston Red Sox through to the World Series sweep over the Cardinals.  Minus extras, it runs 80 minutes.  I wish there was more detail but it certainly hits all the high points of the season, and in fact begins the story with the crushing defeat in the 2003 ALCS.  It concentrates for obvious reasons on the 2004 games against the Yankees, and because of that minimizes some other great games and performances.  There are some good interview snippets with Terry Francona, Curt Schilling, Jason Varitek and all the key members of the Red Sox executive staff.  The extras are moderately interesting, and although the background music is only ok, at least it's not annoying.",1102636800,36,790,4.779411764705882
4904069,5,B005Y1C3TQ,"As a loyal Red Sox fan for years, I was elated when they finally won the World Series and was curious to see how MLB and the New England sports entities would market this success.  This DVD (which I purchased and watched yesterday) is a good example of NESN (our local/Boston-based cable broadcast network) taking the heartbreak of Game 7 against the Yankees from last season and springboarding it into the elation of beating the Yankees in Game 7 just a month+ ago and then somewhat anticlimactically beating the Cards for the World Series title.

They showed highlights from last year's season that were the catalyst for quite a few offseason moves by the front office, which are chronicled nicely.  They work us through the season--from the ups at the beginning, the great back-to-back series against NY early on, through the lagging summer months, to the trade deadline trades and signings, which most feel were the key to postseason success (sorry, Nomar).  The ""characters"" of the team were documented, as well as the on-field action.  The playoffs were covered nicely, but MLB did that, too, in their World Series Champs DVD (which is pretty good).  I don't know how they could have done a better job, considering the history of this team, the general midnset of fans, and the drama of the ALCS both this year and last.

A few concerns have been mentioned, and I'll address those:

1.  the audio quality was fine--I have no idea what everybody is complaining about.  Maybe I'm just deaf. . . .

2.  the length is just about right--the season is 162 games, which is a ridiculous amount of baseball, plus the three playoff series, totalling 14 more games, and they simply can't show us highlights of all 162.  They covered the important series throughout the season and documented very nicely the ""turning point"" against the Yankees in July (the Varitek/A-Rod confrontation that seemed to spark the Red Sox into a spectacular August/September record).  Individual successes were spotlighted:  Manny and Big Papi in the All-Star game and throughout the season, the pitching of Pedro & Schilling and Foulke, and the smooth transitions of Cabrera, Mentkievicz (sp?), and Roberts into starting and/or utility roles, all of which proved to be crucial before the season concluded.  Most people don't want to see every pitch of every game; if you do, get the complete games online (they are downloadable. . .).  The editing down of an emotional 162-game season plus playoffis into a watchable and compelling 80-ish-minute video was superb.  Red Sox fans should enjoy this DVD, as should just plain old baseball fans who want to see what the Red Sox were all about this past year.  Enjoy success!!

p.s.  Great ""extra"" on Cabrera's handshakes with various other players--laugh out loud funny.",1102550400,74,2789,4.929336188436831
4904070,5,B005Y1C3TQ,"This DVD is great.  It is already available where I live, so I have watched it already.  I'm a lifelong Sox fan from Maine, having been seriously scarred by the '86 World Series (I was 14 years old).  The 2004 season totally mended our collective psyches, and this DVD sums up that season from spring training to the rolling rally on the duck boats in Boston.  It contains many highlights from the whole season because it's a NESN video, and they televised the games.  Not to mention it has some great audio cuts from Castiglione and Trupiano's radio broadcasts, as well as some great interviews with the players and coaches.  I could watch the segment on the ALCS over and over and over.  It was sooooo wonderful to beat the Yankees, including Slappy Rodriguez, Jason (""I've never taken steroids"") Giambi, and Gary (""They're a walking disaster"") Sheffield.  Derek Jeter and Joe Torre, although I'm undoubtedly jealous of their success, are the only Yankees with any class.  Anyway, this was the SOX Year, not the Yanks, and to hang the biggest choke in history on them and the Iceman was absolutely wonderful.  To all sox fans, this is the DVD you should get, and for the price you cannot go wrong.  You know how you watched the last second Vinatieri field goal from Super Bowl XXXVI over and over on the Pats DVD?  Well this is even better than that.  Enjoy!",1102291200,31,1360,4.616666666666666
4904071,3,B005Y1C3TQ,"Hey, the video content of this DVD is great. Good presentation of notable points throughout the Sox season, and a good balance between the ALCS and Series content.

That said, the disc is nearly unwatchable because the soundtrack drowns out nearly everything spoken on the disc. Really, the worst mixing job I've ever heard. Can't hear a d*mn thing when there is game play-by-play under the music.

How can you say OVER 80 min (it is actually closer to 90 min) on the Red Sox season is not enough?  Sure we'd all love a 3 hour epic video but that would be insane and would DRAG on.  Every game of the season was not a thriller and this video covers the ENTIRE season.  Not to mention the bonus footage.

4904079,1,B005Y1C3TQ,"One of the most boring World Series. Whoop de doo, overpaid Red Sox sweep Cardinals in 4 games!

After a terrific come from behind win against the Evil Empire (Aka Yankees), the ""cursed"" Red Sox go on to the World Series to face the St. Louis Cardinals who had the best record. I was rooting for the Cardinals (not a fan of them) but didn't really care who won. The series was not exciting at all, and this DVD shows that. One of the most boring World Series. *Yawn*",1152057600,,466,4.235955056179775
4904080,4,B005Y1C3TQ,"The best part of this DVD - the DVD extras at the end.  As a baseball fan, watching the Red Sox ""break the curse"" was something that needed to be witnessed.  I would say most baseball fans were waiting for a ""Bill Buckner"" moment.  The supposed curse that came when MVP Manny Ramirez made back to back errors and the Cardinals Jeff Suppan baserunning blunder wasn't even covered.  Comparing the MLB version to this one, all I can say is MLB, except for the A-Rod glove slap and Nomar trade, MLB covered the 2004 Red Sox better.  Yeah it's the Historic Season, but who's really going to remember the games before the A-Rod fight.  Plus the editing was recycled.  Whenever the Red Sox struggled, they showed the same little boy with the painted face grimacing. They showd Yadier Molina striking out for every R. Sox pitcher doing well and the same footage of the man with the cap shaking his head both in 1986 and 2004.  There's more I'd cite, but you get the idea.  True Red Sox fans I'm sure will enjoy this, but as a baseball fan, it's a decent DVD and the Orland Cabrera handshakes, Cooking with Ortiz, Rolling Rally parade and player profiles are the better part of the DVD.  MLB covers the 2004 championship much better.",1136592000,,1224,4.497737556561086
4904081,1,B005Y1C3TQ,"This DVD does disservice to a season with so much drama. There was so much more to the season than the Yankees rivalry and the crazy hair.

What about the whole Nomar saga?  What about the horrendous defense that lost game after game before the All Star break?  What about Derek Lowe making a noticeable imrovement after the upgrades of Cabrera and Mientkiewicz on defense?  What about the debate over who would start game 1 against the Angels?

And where's the voice of the fans?

Ok, so maybe you can't include everything in an 80 minute DVD, but at least cover the  stuff you do include well.  One of the most intense moments I've ever exerienced watching sports was Dave Roberts leading off first base in game 4 of the ALCS, and all they included was the steal.  And how about including Mueller's entire at-bat afterwards?

By the end of the DVD you get the feeling they were cutting corners so they could get it out before Christmas and cash in on the historic season.

If you want a DVD that will convey the true emotional rollercoster of the 2004 season, look somewhere else.",1128988800,3,1082,4.525773195876289
4904082,5,B005Y1C3TQ,Nothing compares to the feeling of the 2004 championship season for the Red Sox. This DVD lets you relive the goosebumps and tears that went with it!,1127347200,3,149,4.555555555555555
4904083,1,B005Y1C3TQ,"The 2004 Boston Red Sox are hard to believe.  After a regular season filled with intrigue and plain good-old baseball, the team dropped the first three games in the playoffs against the vaunted Yanks, seemingly setting up their fans who had had their hearts so cruelly broken exactly one year before.  But in an historic comeback they won four games in a row and used this momentum in the World Series to carry themselves past the Cards in a decisive fashion.  If all this wasn't epic enough, on the night the Sox won the Series, a rare lunar eclipse with a distinct reddish hue overlooked North America.

So, when it came to making the highlights reel, you'd think producing a documentary filled with drama would be a no-brainer, right?  Well, despite the heroics, philosophy and mythology waiting at the ready to be tapped, Faith Rewarded is a show long on sound bites and short on the actual drama of baseball.

It begins promisingly enough, with a shot of the lunar eclipse, Keith Foulke delivering his final pitch of the series, and that dratted Aaron Boone from 2003. Then come highlights of the first few games, which are not that interesting. Then we fast forward to July and the famous fight between A-Rod and Varitek.  Of course, the game's real highlights included a Sox comeback and Mueller's walk-off HR. But we don't see any of the comeback.  And though we see Mueller hitting the dinger, we don't see him celebrating with his mates; instead, we five boring interviews. And if that wasn't bad enough, after this we get goofiness about the Red Sox' hair and very little play-by-play.  Some of the plays are sped-up (an effect also used on This Week in Baseball, to the show's detriment.  Memo to TV producers: baseball doesn't need special effects to make it interesting).

We see zero of the exciting late summer Angels series. Then against the Yanks, we see a batter swing and then cross the plate, without any explanation as to what just transpired.  And then we have a guy hit the ball, and then we immediately see a throw arriving at the plate.  For some reason, the producers felt they needed to cut out the two seconds that occur between hitting the ball and the end of the play. I had heard that the MTV-generation had a short attention span, but this is ridiculous.

In the playoffs against Anaheim, the clips of the first game are so muddled, you can't tell what's happening. We do see Ortiz hit the HR that won the series, but again the producers felt it'd be a waste of time to show him rounding third and head for the arms of his teammates.

Against the Yanks in the playoffs, the Sox made an incredible comeback in game 1 but we don't see it; for games 2 and 3, incredibly, there is no play-by-play at all! In game 4, a game that is easily one of baseball's most dramatic, we don't even know who walked in the 9th to set up Mueller's single to score the tying run. In game 6, the fact that Schilling busted a gut (and an ankle) is given short shrift. In game 7, we see Damon's grand slam; but there is no build-up to it, no context. Same with Ortiz' HR-he's not even identified. All of a sudden, it's the end of the game and the Sox win.

If that wasn't bad enough, the World Series coverage is virtually non-existent.  All we get in game 1 is Ortiz hitting a HR.  Game 2, we get no highlights at all.  Game 3, we get a few highlights of Pedro pitching, but we don't even hear how the Sox won or what the final score was.  And for game 4, we get nothing, except the Sox and their fans celebrating.  We got more coverage of the first few games of the season than we do of the entire World Series.

A story dying to be told and which began with that mythic Red Sox moon doesn't even show us the moon at the end. The overall feel of this video was that as it went on, the producers just wanted to get it over with.  Poor writing and no sense of drama made me quite disappointed with this disc.  Baseball is all about narrative, storytelling, and taking your time.  I wonder if the Sox organization made their own in-house highlight reel; I'd gladly trade Faith Rewarded for it.",1120089600,10,4101,4.414342629482071
4904084,5,B005Y1C3TQ,"As a die-hard Red Sox fan since 1979, I never thought I'd see the day when there would be a ""Word Series Championship"" video, or DVD, but yes, it really did happen.  The Red Sox really did win the World Series.

I had a tough time deciding between getting this DVD, or the other 2004 World Series one.  I didn't want to get both, because I figured there would be a lot of the same material, and highlights on both, but I chose this one, because I saw it in the store first.  A couple of my friends have the other DVD, and I've also seen that one.  That one's good too.

This DVD captures the Red Sox incredible 2004 season, from spring training to the last out of the World Series, and even shows highlights of the victory parade.  The extra features on the DVD, including interviews with some of the players, are also nice.

This DVD is a must for not only Red Sox fans like myself, but also baseball fans who appreciate the history of the game and also enjoy great sports moments.

Hopefully, there'll be a 2005 Red Sox World Series Championship DVD, but for now, this one will do just fine.

4904085,3,B005Y1C3TQ,I may have had higher expectations for a season covering DVD. I wanted more on the Yankee series. A lot more detail for coming back from 3 games down is NOT just a matter of fact. That was the epic event and the World Series was really anti-climatic.,1112832000,2,250,4.229166666666667

They did an amazing job capturing key moments of the season.  Showing the team sharing the WS victory and trophy with Johnny Peske was SO AWESOME... brought a tear to my eye.  Red Sox fans, you will not be disappointed by this DVD, it is a must for any Sox fan who wants to relive the glory of the 2004 season (even better than the Patriots 2003 season video!).",1106784000,,565,4.261682242990654
4904087,4,B005Y1C3TQ,"As a die-hard Red Sox fan who waited a lifetime for last October, I thought that NESN did a great job detailing the successes and struggles of the 2004 Red Sox season - culminating in the historic defeat of the Evil (choke!) Empire and an ""Impossible Dream"" World Series Victory.

There are some shared scenes with the MLB World Series DVD, which was somewhat disappointing, but the NESN DVD chronicles much more of the 2004 regular season than the World Series DVD, including the July 1 and July 24 battles with the Yankees. I wonder if A-Rod can still taste Veritek's glove?

I would have liked to have heard season commentary from Jerry Remy and other former Red Sox greats (as on the World Series DVD), but I guess you can't have everything. The NESN DVD does provide extended highlights of the victory parade in Boston, which is something worth keeping.

All in all, the DVD is very well done and is a great addition to any Red Sox fan's DVD library along with the World Series DVD. Highly recommended.",1106697600,2,1007,4.583333333333333
4904088,4,B005Y1C3TQ,"NESN--New England's Regional Sports Network has come up with a very good video--even if some of the material is already on other videos like the World Series one.  Of course as a Yankees fan it's tough to relive the fight on July 24th and then the biggest choke (comeback) in all of baseball.  Somehow the trade for Nomar Garciaparra was the catalyst and made Theo Epstein a boy genius.

The video was done in the same way the Yankees championship videos were done in the past with titles for each chapter.  The camerawork was a bit shaky and as I said some of the material has been seen on the official MLB World Series video.

I am someone who loves the city of Boston itself regardless of politics or sports and I'm proud to call it my second home/adopted hometown.  This no doubt is the number one moment in Boston Sports History.  Just as the Yankees are the lifeline of NYC sports, the Sox are the lifeline of Boston.  This really gave fans the inside look at one of the most incredible baseball teams of all time.

But let me say this--it took 86 years to win it all--and it will take another 86!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Baseball fans will like this as it does give that more in-depth inside look at what it took for the Red Sox to end the Curse of the Bambino--somehow I think Babe is sleeping rather peacefully--and maybe even talking to Ted Williams over whatever it is they drink in heaven",1105747200,9,1398,4.468503937007874

4904090,3,B005Y1C3TQ,"I've eaten up pretty much everything there is to read or view on the 2004 Red Sox, and saved this video and the ""Official"" MLB World Series video for last. Both of these documentaries have significant flaws which keep them from being the perfect souvenir for the season, but they probably both are worthy purchases for the Red Sox fan. Of the two, I preferred this one, so if you want but one purchase, this is it.

Let's start off with a few production quibbles. I thought the video editing and pacing of the DVD was outstanding, but the narration and sound mixing were just dreadful. The script for the narration is not grammatical, hackneyed, at times inaccurate, and delivered the kind of painfully sodden style that reminds one of a cross between the 'Sports Century' documentaries by ESPN and a holocaust movie. The music, which with the exception of the closing (and rousing)  'Dirty Water', is stock movie narration stuff that is way, way too high in the mix and isn't even modulated when a talking head appears for a video. While a lot of the footage is culled from NESN's season-long coverage, some of it is ""borrowed"" from the official World Series video, so if you watch both movies you'll have to bear with a lot of repetition -- and even seeing certain scenes being taken out of context.

Since the scope of the documentary is the entire season, I was hoping for more inspired storytelling. Yet the season speaks for itself so loudly, the excellent chronology more than makes up for the flaws in the obviously hasty post-season production. I watched virtually every game of this season as it happened, and as much as I felt they left out a lot of details, it must be said I have yet to see another ""Team Year"" sports film that covered a whole season in such good depth.

The extras on this DVD are pleasing: a montage of the rolling rally victory parade, a weird segment on cooking with David Ortiz, and a few other similarly homey tidbits on specific players in the form of profiles (the official MLB video, by contrast, has game highlights and traditional interview clips.) . I am still perplexed as to why nobody has thought to include statistics, box scores, scorecards, or a still photograph gallery on these types of DVDs.

All in all, a kind of video postcard from the 2004 season, but primarily for Sox fans.",1105056000,4,2330,4.618357487922705
4904091,4,B005Y1C3TQ,"Speaking not really as a Boston fan, but as a fan of baseball (and therefore necessarily an anti-yankee fan), I bought this DVD with the hope that it would focus more on the humiliating defeat the yanks suffered at the hands of my new heros (joining the 2001 Diamondbacks), the 2004 Red Sox.

This DVD did not disappoint.  If you who don't really consider yourself a fan of Boston, but despise the yanks and are looking for something chronicling the worst choke in baseball history, this DVD is much better than the World Series DVD.",1104710400,2,533,4.6
4904092,4,B005Y1C3TQ,"This video is an 80 minute recap of a 176 game season, so true fans can pick apart its oversights and such, but it is indeed a very entertaining portrait of the greatest bunch of idiots ever assembled.  It starts in spring training and skims over the regular season, hitting only the important points (i.e. the yankee series).  It kind of glosses over the ALDS, but gives sufficient coverage of the ALCS comeback against the spankees and culminates with some nice shots of johnny pesky after rolling over the cardinals in the world series.

Faith Rewarded is great for what it is, but it leaves the diehard fan (me) wanting more... I want to see the entire sequence of dave roberts' stolen base in game 4, with rivera throwing over 76 times with roberts extending his lead after each pickoff attempt.

mlb lurkers, if you're reading this i cordially invite you to show some compassion, remove the pin from your ass and release the box set all us diehards are pining for.  Similar to the Patriots ""3 games to glory"" dvd...but with 10 discs.  or 20.  hell, we'll buy whatever you put out.

4904093,5,B005Y1C3TQ,"No doubt about it, this is the DVD 86 years in the making and all that. Glad to see NESN produced it so you know they had their hearts in it in the first place (I won't be getting the MLB World Series DVD based on the negative reviews so this'll be it). Will make all present and future BoSox fans realize why they are fans of such a charismatic team. But there are some things I would have liked to have seen...

1) SUBTITLES, SUBTITLES, SUBTITLES!!! Especially when people like Ortiz talk or the ballplayers are so caught up in their comments (especially on the pratcice footage), I have to rewind the DVD a few times to find out exactly what is said...

2) The bonus footage of the post World Series Rolling Rally in Boston should have been at least 10 minutes longer (maybe some more crowd footage??) and what's with the cheesy background music?? ARGH!

3) Maybe an Easter Egg or two?

But like I said, those are minor quibbles. Highlights for me were the Veritek/A-Rod fight (of course); Manny catching the almost-home-run from whatever Yankee hit it for an out and the poor schmuck rounding the bases and wondering why he wasn't getting any congratulations from his fellow overpaid thugs... I mean Yankees; and the entire ALCS footage. The bonus footage of Cabreara and Ortiz was a nice touch too... anyway, if you are a BoSox fan, you have this DVD, if not, get it.",1103932800,8,1372,4.497991967871486

From that point on the Red Sox would not and could not win another world series. Oh there were times every decade or so the Sox could get to the championship series only to find new and different ways of watching a possible world series victory slip right through their hands. Enos Slaughter scoring from first base in game 7 of the series that lead St Louis to becoming champions in 1946. Being over powered by Bob Gibson and St Louis in the 1967 series. The dramatic extra inning home run by Carlton Fisk in game 6 of the series of 1975 only to see their hopes dashed once again, this time by the Cincinnati Reds in Game 7. Bucky Dent's home run over the green monster in 1978 that lead to the Yankees winning against Boston in a one game American League playoff game. And of course the infamous 1986 series when Boston was one out away in game 6 of the series from finally winning the championship only to have the baseball go through the legs of first baseman Bill Buckner that allowed the New York Mets to tie the series and go on the next night and clinch the world series title. And these were just some of the more well known disappointments the Red Sox when though during the time of the curse. But through it all no matter how frustrating it could be at times Boston fans kept the faith that one day the world series banner would fly over Fenway Park. It finally did in 2004.

""Faith Rewarded: The Historic Season of the 2004 Boston Red Sox"" is a beautifully made DVD that looks at that 2004 season and what the BoSox went through to lay the curse to rest once and for all. It starts right at the point in time where ending the curse would begin. Right after Boston's disappointing loss in the 2003 American League Championship series against the Yankees the Boston front office made it a mission during the off season to acquire the right people they would need to finally bring a pennant home to Boston. A lot of wheeling and dealing would go on to bring in the right players Boston needed to create the right blend of people to achieve their goal. The biggest of them all would have to have been the trade they organized with the Arizona Diamondbacks to bring Curt Schilling to Boston. Schilling was the man Boston wanted almost from the start because he would provide they thought the experience and winning attitude the team needed. Add him to a pitching rotation that already included Pedro Martinez and Derek Lowe would give the Red Sox a fearsome lineup of starters.

From the off season the DVD then turns to spring training 2004 down in Ft Myers Florida and the feeling that determination and desire had brought new hope to the Red Sox. The team as a whole were sure they would not repeat the disappointing season that happened a year before. The season however would start off not so easily. April saw them winning but as April turned to May the team started hitting some rough times. But the difference in the 2004 team was they were not letting the slump effect them. They carried in them a certainty that this was the year things were going to change. And change they would although at one point it looked like history was going to repeat itself. At the end of the season Boston once again finished in second in the eastern division to New York. They had the wildcard spot again and once again the American league Championship would feature Boston against the dreaded Yankees. But the situation would worsen before the faith would payoff. Boston would go one to lose the first three games against New York. It seemed they were heading to a humiliating four game loss to the Yankees. But even in this all this there was still a hope, no matter how small it was, they maybe could come back. Inspired on by the words of their first baseman Kevin Millar Boston started approaching the remaining games one at a time. The rest would become history. The Sox went on to win games 4,5,6 and then 7 to record the only time in baseball history a team came back from three games down to win a best of seven series.

Boston would then go on the play against the St Louis Cardinals in the world series where they would sweep the Cards in four games. The Curse of the Bambino was crushed once and for all. This is a well made and pretty complete look at the whole season. It doesn't go game by game coverage through the whole season. Considering  a baseball season consists of 162 games, and if your team makes it into the playoffs, however much post season games you may play makes it impossible to show the entire season. Instead ""Faith Rewarded"" looks at those key moments, both on and off the field, that would contribute to the final result of Boston bring joy and satisfaction both for them as a team and for the city of Boston. This makes in the end a nice trip down memory lane looking back on the players who were a part of this team and to the moments that lead to victory in the world series that year. If you are a Red Sox fan I highly recommend this.",1478563200,2,5326,4.365927419354839
