If you have any interest in air, water, living, television, music, video games, film, or art, then you must buy this DVD set.

There is no guarantee these will be available in the future, so to avoid heartbreak you need to get this set NOW. I know how much it hurts to pass up then
feel the heartwrench later. Just buy it and get it off your mind.

5 stars for history, 5 stars for content, 5 stars for masterful animation.

A MUST HAVE set.",1306540800,4,547,4.281553398058253
4510011,5,B004ZKKL14,"As others have stated it does not include the 10 episodes from season 2- ""Racing Season"". Therefore it is not technically the complete series.
However, I do not include these in the Original Series because it was a complete change in direction. Instead of battling VENOM around the World Matt Trakker and team tackle them on a racing circuit. Kind of a different feel completely, and in my opinion, the reason why MASK was cancelled. They should have stuck with the original idea.

What are Venom Super Humans Since they're Vehicles explode and not one injury or scratch way too unrealistic. Even GI Joe had people getting killed,There is too many jokes same as the 80s He-Man.

These vehicles turned from one form into another. The show kind of combined G.I. Joe and Transformers. The characters all wear masks that have various powers and drive vehicles that changed from one type to another, for example, Condor rides a motorcycle that turns into a mini-helicopter.

This set is actually only the first season. The second season changed the format and probably is not what most people will remember watching. All of the M.A.S.K. goodness you want is here.

Enjoyment: Highly enjoyable. It makes me want to drag out all my M.A.S.K. toys from the attic and pretend like I am litte kid again, and the living room floor is my battlefield where MASK and VENOM square-off.

Recomendation: If you loved this as a kid, you should still love it now. I always thought MASK was the perfect combination of G.I. Joe and Transformers. I could only dream/wish that MASK will one day see a revival, similar to that of G.I. Joe and Transformers in recent years.

"" M.A.S.K. Crusaders... """,1315526400,6,744,4.78125
4510095,4,B004ZKKL14,"EXPERIENCE WITH MASK:
To start, the toys were by far my favorite of all time thanks to their tiny figure size, masks and well crafted transforming vehicles and variety. Collected nearly every one, including TBob and Scott and the special figure packs too. Brilliant thanks to Kenner Toys. Also watched the show as a kid.

OVERALL OPINION:
If you're a fan of the Mask Toys as I was, there's plenty of nostalgia, but please be aware this show centers around TBob and Scott the kid just as much as Mask, and even more rare, Venom. Keeping in mind, it's a kid's show, but so was GI Joe and Transformers, both of which tend to have a bit more serious tone to the action.

EPISODE HIGHLIGHTS:
Each episode starts with the very catchy MASK theme song. ""Masked crusaders, working overtime, fighting crime-fighting crime! .... MASK!""

HEROES:
The MASK team's leader Matt Trakker, recruits his agents, each with their own vehicle, but as the series progresses, he routinely calls in only a few repeat members, so if you had a favorite, you may be disappointed not to find them too often, mostly Alex Sector, Bruce Sato, Buddy Hawks or Dusty Hayes. Brad Turner/Condor goes missing in action most of the time, along with Hondo and some others, like Julio Lopez of Firefly, etc..

VILLAINS:
Miles Mayhem in his SwitchBlade is thankfully very ruthless, constantly setting up traps with his familiar goons, oftentimes forcing Mask to save innocent bystanders from doom. Sly Rax who speaks like Jack Nicholson, rides the Piranha cycle side car, Cliff Dagger in his black 4x4 truck. Vanessa Warfield also appears in her Manta purple Jet Car. Later on, Floyd Malloy and his flying cycle Vampire appear, with the nerdy Outlaw tech-man to name another.

ACTION SERIES:
The action in the series revolves around Miles causing some trouble, which is always unique, as he plots for wealth and rulership. This is a strong point to the series. The action, when it takes place, usually revolves around the masks, and for a few minutes, the vehicles flying around or shooting at each other. Other times, their using their unique abilities to outsmart a dangerous hazard when present.

ANIMATION AND SOUND:
The animation is a bit choppy, but well drawn. Music: with the exception of the excellent Theme Song ""MASK!"", the music is fairly cheesy during the show as cheerful tunes play during tense moments. The Sound FX are good, but the lasers need more bass, they sound a bit thin.

WEAK SPOT OF THE SERIES:
MASK: Aka: The Scott and T Bob Show
Nearly every show focuses on the hijinks of Matt Trakker's son, Scott and his goofball scooter sidekick robot, T Bob. Most of Scott's time is spent baby sitting TBob, who needs to be explained what simple things are, like a Mummy for example. Had the show kept this pair to a minimum, it'd be a much more serious show, and better for it, instead of catering to toddlers. Back as a kid watching the show, I felt the same way I now recall. This pair  literally show up in the middle of the action in almost every episode, fumbling around for ""comedy's sake"", defusing the tension of Mask versus Venom. I am not exaggerating. Every show.

EXTRAS:
In the extras, there's a (1 of 2)  retrospective bonus of 20 minutes, where a handful of entertainment professionals discuss how they tend to feel about Mask, one suggesting it was like GI Joe and Transformers combined. A fair comparison, but someone in the group suggests it was better than both of them. Opinions, but I don't agree entirely.

OVERALL:
It's a decent show, but there are weak spots in the 65 episodes. Namely, Scott and T-Bob's constant goofy presence, minimal vehicle on vehicle action (compared to GI Joe and Transformers), some questionably ""tinny"" sound quality in some episodes, and a good transfer that could use deeper blacks, as they appear dark gray.

DVD PRESENTATION:
I give the series 4/5 stars no thanks to Scott and TBob always showing up to dilute the tone. The DVD transfer 3/5 stars due to questionable sound quality and picture problems such as rare 3/4 Inch tape horizontal jam tape lines, low quality blacks and some pixels here and there. The packaging is beautifully done however, though each disc (12 total) contain about six episodes each.

4510097,4,B004ZKKL14,"The 2nd and final season is NOT included with this set.  Had I known that...I would have waited as the 2nd season was only about 10 episodes long.  Other than this rather large issues, the set is decent.",1313280000,3,203,4.315789473684211
4510098,4,B004ZKKL14,"M.A.S.K. was a cartoon that I loved as a child, and I am extremely pleased to finally see the series get a proper release on DVD in the United States.  Although it isn't perfect, this 12 disc set is far superior to the imported ""bootleg"" versions of the series available over the years.  The packaging of this set is near flawless; two amaray cases (with six DVDs each) housed in a beautiful full color slip case.  The actual video and audio presentation of the series, however, is less than what I had hoped for. If you are a videophile, like I am, be aware that there are many lines, scratches, pops, and color inconsistencies present in the video transfer.  For a cartoon produced in the 80s, this is quite a common problem; however, I wish that Shout Factory had spent more time digitally remastering the series from the original print.  Like previously stated, however, it's still a far better print than any I have previously seen.  All in all, I am pleased with this release and think others will be pleased with it as well.",1313280000,33,1031,4.545945945945946

4510100,5,B004ZKKL14,"Finally, fans have a complete set of one of the best toy-related cartoons the 80's had to offer!

If you were a fan of the series you'll instantly be taken back to your childhood when you hear the MASK theme blasting from your television.  The set comes with the 12 discs in two thick, plastic DVD cases, both of which are tucked inside a very nice, full color sleeve.  The video and audio are of amazing quality for a cartoon that is this old (and if you've ever seen one of the terrible ""bootlegs"", you'll really appreciate the work that Shout put into restoring these on a proper collection).  Also, like many of Shout's previous sets, this includes the PSAs at the end of the episodes as well as the commercial bumpers.

If you liked MASK, don't wait and let this one slip away again. Buy it now before it's gone!",1312934400,9,817,4.3841059602649
4510101,4,B004ZKKL14,"Watching these old toon's really takes me back! I remember running home after school to watch these. Man! there is nothing like these shows any more. Some of the stuff they came up with as far as the cars were just the coolest! My fav was Rhino. These cartoons are a rare mix of good story telling + good artwork that is just gone today. The stuff that they come out with now is just garbage and poorly produced retreads that is just sad. My only gripe is there are no captions or subtitles on any of the shout! factory dvds, G.I. Joe & Tranformers at least. Being almost deaf I really need them to follow the stories. Even without the captions, they are worth the money just to get caught up in them one more time. It's really cool that shout! factory is bringing these old shows back, I just hope they can get ""Centurions"" some time soon!",1309824000,18,840,4.289308176100629

Fans of the original 65-episode series (Season 1) where M.A.S.K. and V.E.N.O.M. engaged in G.I. Joe-esque warfare were baffled by the show's retooled format change to a short-lived 10-episode ""racing series"" (Season 2). Due to the varying formats (hence Shout! Factory's ""Complete Series"" title), the 10 episodes that comprise the second season ""racing series"" of M.A.S.K. are not included in this set.

M.A.S.K. - The ""Complete"" Series is a 12-DVD collection which contains all 65 episodes from Season One in Full Frame (1.33:1) video, and English Stereo audio. Thanks to the folks at Shout! Factory, fans not only get the best (and biggest) season of M.A.S.K. released in an official quality DVD set, but also the following Special Features:

* ""Unmasking M.A.S.K."" - Retrospective interview with show writers on this hit animated series

* ""Saturday Morning Krusaders"" - Entertaining look back with loyal fans

* Exclusive iron-on decal (only with sets purchased online from Shout! Factory Store while supplies last)

It's not but seeing it's got the complete 65 episode first season and not the canceled 10 episode second is fine.
