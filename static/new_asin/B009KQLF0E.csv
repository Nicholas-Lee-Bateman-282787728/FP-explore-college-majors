5344973,1,B009KQLF0E,"This movie was actually slightly better than most of the movies like it on the market right now, but I'm giving it a one-star rating for the benefit of real Christians who might buy it in the hopes of being edified.  If you were really blessed by movies like ""Sheffey,"" ""The Printing,"" ""Facing the Giants,"" or ""Time Changer,"" I can tell you that you will not be edified by this film.  I'm not sure the name of Christ was mentioned even one time in this film, and certainly there was no gospel presentation.  The behavior of the so-called Christians in this movie is disappointing to say the least.  I came away feeling like this was just another disappointing, worldly picture of Christ Himself and of Christian life.  Save your money for one of the movies I listed above, if you haven't already seen them.",1365724800,5,806,4.569444444444445
5344974,5,B009KQLF0E,Great movie to watch with my teenage daughter! It showed teeenagers making good choices that are hard to make.  That is rare in movies today.,1363910400,2,141,4.64
5344975,5,B009KQLF0E,"This was a superb movie. The characters and acting were outstanding. It was refreshing to watch a movie with a solid message and no foul language, suggestive scenes, etc. I thought Ben Davies did a phenomenal portrayal of Lucas Green. His acting talent is definitely God given. What an asset to this movie!",1360713600,4,306,4.7924528301886795
5344976,1,B009KQLF0E,"I am a Christian and my wife is agnostic. Neither of us wanted to finish this movie, so we did not. If my wife had known that this was a another 'Christian movie' cut from the same cloth as 'Suing the Devil' (a movie so poor that even the legendary Malcolm McDowell couldn't save it)she would not have consented to ever place it in our DVD player. She even suggested that this type of movie should come with a warning, or at least some indication that it was a 'Christian movie.' Put it this way...a movie this  heavy-handed in its preachiness is sure to rapidly turn off almost if not all non-Christians. No one is going to be made interested in the faith from a movie this wooden and schmaltzy. We actually threw it out after about half-way. That being said, the cinematography was very good, and the scenes in natural settings looked pretty.  Michael, the main character, was played as well as possible given the frankly lame script. He was quite likable. The little stereotypical bratty over-talkative sister surprisingly brought the only humor we could find in the parts we watched. The basketball game action was convincing, although the cheerleaders and crowd were awfully generic. The Dad and Coach were made of cardboard throughout. I myself am fine with the biblical messages in the film, but the predictable, leaden approach to scripture was...well, I already said we threw the disk out. If you are a Christian and like boring, predictable flicks full of white-bread, straight from centeral casting unconvincing characters who are preaching to the choir, see this one again and again. If anything, movies like this will turn non-Christian off completely. Not a good thing.",1359763200,4,1683,4.860627177700349
5344977,4,B009KQLF0E,"New Hope is another successful Christian movie from R2 it can be a little slow at times and some of the acting is a little wooden but once again they introduce Ben Davies who is a young actor sent to go far, it is ideal for teens and family viewing alike and gives good moral pointers. But the real & New star is Samuel Davis Wow what a talented young actor who comes over so as so natural with genuine acting skills, he is one name we are going to see a lot more of in 2013, in fact he has a new movie out on DVD on the 22 January 2013 ""Abel's Field""

Not an outstanding movie that is the reason for the rating of four but one worth buying!",1358121600,2,641,3.8931297709923665
5344978,5,B009KQLF0E,I WOULD THINK IT WILL BE A HELPFUL & ENCOURAGING  VIDEO FOR CHURCH YOUTH AND THEIR LEADERS TO WATCH EVEN IF THERE IS NO SUICIDE INVOLVED.,1357257600,4,137,4.269230769230769
5344979,4,B009KQLF0E,"Minister Alex Evans (denomination unidentified, but obviously mainline, fairly conservative Protestant) and his family move from Colorado to a small southern town that is still reeling from the suicide of high school basketball star Chase Green the year before. Michael, the minister's son, takes Chase's place on the team, begins a relationship with Chase's decidedly non-Christian girlfriend, Jasmine, and is antagonized by Chase's angry, grief-stricken, star center brother, Lucas.

NEW HOPE is, of course, from R-Squared Productions, a Christian film company, so there is little or no sex, gore, violence, profanity, etc. Not rated, but would almost certainly be a ""PG"": Tame stuff, but not completely Hallmark in all respects--it does show a condom in one scene. This film is certainly open to criticism for being sappy and cornballish in many spots, but it's not-so in many others. NEW HOPE honestly, originally, and often quite humorously addresses many pertinent issues: e.g., the well-behaved but still somewhat ambivalent Michael's observation, ""It's not Christianity that's flawed: It's Christians.""

Though slow-moving, NEW HOPE's storyline is taut and focused, and there is some real tension here along with genuine elements of surprise in a number of places. Still, the transformations that take place toward the end are both predictable and unbelievable.

Some good acting and dialogue, as well as some that's quite lame. Interestingly enough, the teenagers' script is more realistic than the adults': I've seen better depictions of adolescent life, but I've also seen much worse. The interactions between Jasmine and Michael are particularly engaging and poignant. Also worthy of mention is Michael's little sister, Faith, about 10 and always being told to go get ready for bed: ""Mom, don't take this the wrong way, but have you HEARD how boring you and Dad are?!""

Unfortunately (since he's so central), NEW HOPE's most wooden character is the minister himself. It is, of course, hard to characterize a Fundamentalist preacher who, regardless of whether or not we all subscribe to his theology, is a decent fellow and neither a thundering lunatic nor a closet pervert; thus, many of Evans's lines are the usual ""We ALL have our struggles,"" blah-blah-blah. Nevertheless, he does have his realer moments: ""Hey, I'm a preacher! This 'God' stuff is all I know.""

Though many will find the patriarchal, mostly white, Middle American culture alienating, it's noteworthy that the moms in this film are far more convincing  than the dads. Chase's grieving mother, finely played by Dodie Brown, is probably the most fully-realized character here.

NEW HOPE's mood and atmosphere remind me of the ""After-School Specials"" I used to watch as a boy back in the '70s and '80s. {That may sound insulting, but it's not so-intended}. Daryl Wolgemuth's fine soundtrack really enhances this production. Yes, a lot of it's ""Christian rock,"" but it's some of the best that I've heard, and the use of subtle instrumentals is just fantastic. The general cinematography and use of scenery are also quite good.

This production will obviously resonate with many Christian audiences, and non-Christians with some tolerance for basic, unpoliticized Christian views should not find it too preachy or dogmatic. It's full of ""lessons"" about God and life, most of which are given via Pastor Evans, and there is an obvious intent to evangelize to the audience, but again, it's not too ""in-yer-face"" in these respects.",1356480000,15,3502,5.308664259927798

5344999,3,B009KQLF0E,"Senior year. Pastor's kid. Moving. Those three just don't go together. Oh, one more thing? Some of the community is still grieving a boy's suicide that happened a year ago. Newcomer Mike soon learns that fitting in will be a lot harder than he thought. Especially when Lucas, the dead boy's brother, seems to hate everything and everyone, especially Mike. And then there's the issue of how far is too far with a girl who seems so nice one second and so luring the next.

""New Hope"" is a movie that explores how people react to someone's suicide. There's a lot of anger, guilt, confusion. How can one get beyond that and, still realizing who that person was, live life how it's supposed to be lived? Does God really care about teenagers with broken hearts, sketchy pasts, and unanswered questions?

Although ""New Hope"" did not have the best movie quality, the quality of the story and its moral are well worth the time spent watching it.",1468972800,,936,4.632530120481928

5345002,3,B009KQLF0E,"To explain this film I need you to understand. I believe in God, but this fell short of the message it intended to provide.
This movie was a lot like the after school shows I saw in my youth. That's not a bad thing as I enjoyed most of them. The problem was they pushed blank religion at the viewers. I'm not against the teaching of religion but the only time I read of Jesus pushing it on someone was when he addressed the religion leaders of his day. If we want to follow his example we should just show the other people the love of God and save pushing for the religious folk who have forgotten God is love and if you don't have it for others He's not in you.
Ok this is suppose to be a review not a sermon. The preacher didn't present a reason to trust and confide in him as deeply as they did. His acting was week watered down to the point of his role was not believable. The coach gave the same speech over and over to the point if I was his team I would just want a mute button for him.
The real acting came strangely enough from the kids. The best actor in the bunch the 10 yr who had very few lines. followed by the 3 teens and then the dead teens mother.
The backdrop was wonderful. The swamp lush and easily a place to hide and find ones self. The stars well it's the night sky always inspires reflection. The fireworks were cool but I didn't catch what they were for as baseball was not yet here and basketball was just winding down. And am I the only one that saw the team had 7 players and there where like 16 cheerleaders and where were the ugly kids I saw at my high school at least let them be extras.
Why did they make Mike so  much like Chase. Falling into a dead mans place is not the way to help his friends and loved ones move on with life. They pointed out one thing after another that they were alike but nothing that made him different.
While the town may have hope, the cast and crew may have hope I have little hope for New Hope making it big.",1468281600,,1970,4.012722646310433

5345079,5,B009KQLF0E,This movie was a surprise to me! I bought it because Samuel Davis and Ben Davies were in it from Abel's Field (excellent) and Courageous (excellent) but didn't think it would be as good as it was because of the low price. I was so wrong on that! Ben Davies did a really good job of portraying the angry brother! Samuel Davis was excellent also in his role! I lent it out to a couple of people and they loved it also! Good buy!,1396224000,,426,4.083333333333333

5345085,3,B009KQLF0E,"This is an average film at best. Acting is wooden and stiff in many scenes, the music is mundane and many of the scenes are unconvincing. I think a 3 star would be generous for this film, The redeeming quality in my mind is the look into the mind and heart of a pastor's kid. Very nice component of this movie. Still I had to ask my wife to keep watching and she did, but I only did that because it is a faith based film and we are believers. Still we were disappointed by the production quality overall.

This movie carries a message for believers to trust in God when you don't like the life you have. I don't agree with the reviewer who said it had no gospel in it...it has a strong faith message that shows how young people can make hard choices for God when life is not smooth. There are a lot of great quotes and moments, and because of those I give this a 3 star.",1391558400,,870,4.058139534883721
5345086,5,B009KQLF0E,"It is difficult to find a movie of such excellent moral character in this day and age. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in watching a movie that is not simply a movie of the same type as all the rest. What I mean by that is the all too common blow it up, destruction derby as they go without any real purpose or meaning, just destruction and termination along the way. This movie has real moral fiber and offers something of high moral conduct in a world quickly losing all morals! If this sounds like it may be something of interest to you, than I would highly suggest your watch this movie. Unlike the norm that is flooding the airwaves of modern movie goers, this movie offers a different slant with a obvious true morality becoming less and less common in this modern world of everything goes regardless of who is hurt along the way. There is no way that I could give this selection a high enough ranking for such a tremendous work in today's lack of morality. Well done to one and all who put together this great movie, ""New Hope!""",1389830400,,1060,4.385786802030457

5345098,3,B009KQLF0E,"I really wanted to like this one, but the unrealistic portrayal of high school basketball was too much for me to overcome. I had to force myself to watch to the end. The acting for the most part was good by the principals, but there were some less than stellar performances by others. Ben Davies was almost enough to hold this movie together by himself--but not quite. The main problem I had was watching a basketball team with only eight players coached by a man who talked more like a cheerleader than a coach. If they had been a poor team, I'd have been comfortable with it, but watching them work their way through to the state championship was more than I could suspend my disbelief. A four-on-four practice scrimmage is not going to prepare a team to win the state championship. In real life, teams would bring up sophomores and maybe freshmen to pad their roster so they'd have enough players for a full scrimmage and a bench. To make things worse, they hosted all of the tournament games in their small home gym, including the state championship. Tournaments are held in large neutral gyms, not in crackerbox local high school gyms. I realize that they saved a lot on expenses by shooting in on location, but I think it was a big mistake. And lastly, the new kid in town, who was billed to be some kind of a hotshot, was a lame basketball player. I think I had more serious basketball skills at fifty-five years of age than his character portrayed. A pretty good Christian message was somewhat lost by ignoring some small details which anyone associated with basketball could have helped avoid.  Here is the perfect example of where a movie producer should have gotten input from others before shooting to avoid story issues. People can stomach a sermon if it's delivered via a good story. I'm afraid this one was not palatable for me.",1367712000,3,1843,4.601823708206687
