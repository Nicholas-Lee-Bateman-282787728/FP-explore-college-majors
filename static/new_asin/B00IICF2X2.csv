6264443,5,B00IICF2X2,"I have to say I am amazed! The knowledge that I was holding onto from God immediately connected to what was explained in this video. There is nothing new under the sun. Today the (Ark) is Jesus the son of David and the enemy is racing against this present time because he knows it will end. The book of Revelation speaks volumes and time will eventually end. The Salvation door will shut and many will be locked out. Repentance is needed in order to enter into the Kingdom of God, deliverance is also needed. Deliverance of the mind, soul if you have one and spirit. Great video...",1424736000,3,581,4.4392523364485985
6264444,4,B00IICF2X2,"I do like it however it would be OH SO MUCH BETTER without the loud music in the background
It makes youi strain to hear the message...whcih is why you bought it.
Good information but needs a re-edit to take out the music",1424131200,6,221,4.162790697674419

know what the bible says.",1475539200,,116,4.086956521739131
8642245,5,B00IICF2X2,"I have been interested in theories of the Watcher, Nephalim, and Fallen Angels for decades.  I believe that the ""Sons of God"" could only have been angels and not Cain's children, but the differing opinions are what make this program one worth watching over again.  I see new insight each time I watch it.",1464480000,,304,4.611111111111111
8642246,1,B00IICF2X2,Never saw this or know anything about it,1462147200,,40,4.125
8642247,5,B00IICF2X2,Excellent biblical review of who the sons of god really are.  To the point and all scriptural--no opinions.  I like the way he does all of his  videos.,1453420800,,151,4.321428571428571
8642248,5,B00IICF2X2,I think that this is very true,1448323200,,30,3.4285714285714284
8642249,5,B00IICF2X2,"Very thorough, biblical teaching. Uses only the Bible.  Adds details from scripture iften overlooked which gives even those some understanding of this subject a more thirough look.",1446076800,,180,5.666666666666667
8642250,5,B00IICF2X2,"I did rent this video and have watched it for the last few days learning a lot from the research provided.
The facts presented speak for themselves, research proves that what has been provided is reasonable.
If your views differ, then search the matter out for yourselves to show yourself approved unto GOD.",1442966400,,307,4.811320754716981

8642252,3,B00IICF2X2,"While not entirely accurate, it does induce good reasons for research. Wish it was longer so each insight that was mentioned, was explained, rather than sometimes just stated, which leaves a person hanging and with the options to continue research on their own.",1438214400,,261,5.093023255813954
8642253,1,B00IICF2X2,"This video is full of false information and presuppositions promoted by other youtube celebrities like his buddy Chris Putnum, Steve Quayle, Chuck Missler, and Tom Horn.
His Age of Deceit documentaries are his claim to fame, boasting over 4 million views in total.
Great quality, massive production with some well known guests like Chris White who makes some really good videos himself like ""Age of Aquarius, Age of Evil.""
I give it 1 star because I believe it to be heresy. As much truth about the NWO as is presented in his prior works, this is apologetics for his bogus view on the sons of God in Genesis chapter 6.
A theory that first got it's start in Alexandria, which is currently held by gnostics, occultists, jehova's witnesses, mormons, catholics, and seventh day adventists as absolute truth.
I appreciate that he only uses the bible to explain his view, but what he does with Genesis 4:26 is absolutely wrong and heretical.

I recommend watching this video before buying:
