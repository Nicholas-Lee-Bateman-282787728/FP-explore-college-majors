If you like intense stories and deep character development, this movie is well worth watching.  There are moments that I just had to hold my breath ... and the ending is terrific too... it just doesn't leave you with a confusing ending where you're left wondering what on earth is going on...",1114387200,,387,4.514285714285714
1347393,3,B00004S89R,"Meandering around in his warehouse like abode, John Goodman as ""Deepthroat"" exudes a sedentary and malevolent evil that forms the foundation for this well written, if inconsequential, movie.  Ron Eldard stars as Edward, a man with a gambling addiction, who takes his uncle's (Joe Mantegna) advice to work as a runner for Goodman.  During this time, he meets a waitress named Corinna (played well by Courteney Cox), falls in love and decides to go straight and give up his addiction.  Sorry, Ron.  It doesn't work out that way and before you know it, Eldard is using Goodman's money to gamble and even when he wins $110,000, it's not enough:  he wants more.  Cox gets pregnant, Eldard buys her engagement ring with Goodman's money, and sets up the plot for a dark, disturbing ending.
Eldard is exceptional in his role; playing against his boyish good looks, he embodies the frustration, obstinance and greed which forms the basis of most addicts.  Bokeem Woodbine as a fellow runner is smooth and also fundamentally evil; Lucy Lin as a Chinese dealer is marvelous in how she maintains her stoic stance while Eldard keeps losing and betting again.
The final scene in the ballpark is unique, and gruesome in its delivery.
The problem with the movie, in spite of its technical expertise, is its hollowness.  Eldard while riveting is not sympathetic, and Goodman is so bad, he's tedious.
THE RUNNER is a solid, if cerebral, thriller; it just doesn't move you the way I would have liked.",1082851200,,1481,4.849206349206349
1347394,5,B00004S89R,"I love this movie! It was funny at the start, then kept me on the edge of my seat in the middle, and worried about how everything was gonna turn out at the end. I wasn't sure whether I wanted the baby to be a girl which would be a happy ending, or a boy which would be more interesting. I won't spoil it for you by telling you how the ending worked out.
Ron Eldard was fantastic in this movie, as were Courteney Cox and John Goodman. Eldard in particular was very believable. He and Cox seemed to have good chemistry between them, although Cox's real life husband David Arquette plays a barman.
I would recomend this movie to anyone.",996278400,7,633,4.239669421487603
1347395,4,B00004S89R,"This movie was intense. Ron Eldard plays a man who is addicted to gambling (Edward). He loses all of his money, but his uncle, Rocco (Joe Mantegna) offers to help. He gives him the number of Deepthroat (John Goodman), the sports bookie.
Edward meets Karina (Courteney Cox). She is a Casino waitress and he is attracted to her right away. They go out and become deeply involved. Karina becomes pregnant. Edward has been lying to her this whole time. She does not know that he has a gambling problem (he hasn't told her) and when she asks him about it, he lies. Eventually though, she finds out.
Edward went behind Deepthroat's back and spent the runner money. Deepthroat tells him that if Karina has a girl, they're even (he won't kill him), but if he has a boy, he will be Deepthroat's.
The last half hour of this movie is the best...I won't tell you anything, i don't wan't to give it away, but Deepthroat challenges Edward one more time, and Karina goes into labour. If you are a fan of anyone in the cast, or just want to be entertained by a great, suspensful movie, this is a good bet for that!",994204800,,1098,4.413793103448276
1347396,4,B00004S89R,"As there have been many films on the subject of gambling,I was rather surprised by the unique script and stylish directing this film had to offer. John Goodman shows that his acting range can include EVIL. However,  even though this production is a cut above the rest, it is Courteney Cox who stands out. Cox is one of the few actresses in tinsel town that is always full of surprises. From Friends to a wide range of film work, Courteney Cox is always re-inventing herself. The Runner is just another example of her good work.",984700800,,527,4.5473684210526315
1347397,4,B00004S89R,"In my opinion, this was a nicely done film that pulled no punches.  It showed the reality of a gamblers life, and how things don't always go smoothly, even in the movies.  Ron Eldard and Courteney Cox gave great performances.  Eldard played a convincing Edward, and I appreciated the emotion.  Cox as Karina shows that she indeed has range as an actress.  Not to give the movie away, but the delivery scene was intense, and Cox was excellent.  The chemistry between the two was hot.  John Goodman's performance as Deep Throat was good, but I'm not sure I was convinced that he could play someone as ruthless as the character was suppose to be.  All in all, if you want to see how good an actor Ron Eldard is, or if you're wondering if Courteney Cox has range, check this movie out.",979862400,6,781,4.450704225352113
7921803,5,B00004S89R,"I hadn't even HEARD of this film before I saw it on Amazon. I loved the casting, except for 'Monica'.  I gambled (pun intended) and bought it. She was awesome, too!  Good suspense flick :)",1399852800,,188,4.3428571428571425
7921804,2,B00004S89R,"Bought based on reasonable number of positive reviews and defined actors BUT this is not much of a movie. Perhaps a gambling addiction ""light"" tale but hardly worth a view and full of foul language making it unsuitable for viewing with a spousal or most anyway. Date night? Not hardly. Manly man movie?  Ah, no. No car crashes, explosions, limited gun fire, limited violence, limited sex. Pass this one up, I wish I had.",1365897600,,420,4.675675675675675
7921805,3,B00004S89R,"The Runner is an semi-Good film with Joe Mantegna and John Goodman holding it up,at Least for me. And I got this as an Gift from an Giftcard and For $1 no less! at the Dollar store. Although the DVD has no special features or Subtitles which is fine,and the cover is not any of the covers here on Amazon but one of the main Character in front of an Green car which sadly for me turned out to be an Mustang,an early 70's Mustang like the one in the Original Gone in 60 Seconds but in an more pleasing Green and an droptop.(I hate Mustangs.)The movie is an little slow and obivious and alot of truth to it as Nothing is sadder than an Gambler. The action is slow in coming but the plot and the end are good. Not one of the best but not the worst is the kindest I could say.",1363824000,,771,3.9806451612903224
7921806,5,B00004S89R,"The movie ""THE Runner"" starring John Goodman in one of his best roles is a beginning to end intense thriller. This movie realistic in depicting the disease of gambling addiction is well worth the watch! John Goodman is excellent as a top bookie with a violent brilliant personality that fascinates you at every scene. All the acting was top notch. I loved the plot and the final scenes keep you on the edge of your seat. I had never heard of this movie and did not intend to watch but after viewing for a few minutes I was glad I stumbled across this great flick. I believe this movie should have had much more acclaim when it was first released and should become as well known as the movie ""ROUNDERS"" which also explores the dark side of gambling.",1357430400,,748,4.427536231884058
7921807,5,B00004S89R,really loved this one. It had alot of twists and kept your eyes locked on the movie.  I would recommend it to my family and friends.,1357171200,,132,4.076923076923077
7921808,3,B00004S89R,"The idea behind the movie was good, but the story was hard to follow. The ending was poorly thought out. The underlying plot of a bookie taking equal action on any game that was on the board makes the bookie an easy 10%.",1356134400,,220,4.1395348837209305
7921809,5,B00004S89R,YOu'll be on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. I thought it was great. All the actors were very good too.,1324080000,,115,4.043478260869565
7921810,5,B00004S89R,"I loved this film...and at first I was somewhat disappointed with the ending.  However, when I scrolled through the credits I found myself asking several questions...most notably...""what happened?""  And that is why I gave this film all 5 stars.  It is the riveting story of a disease called gambling.  The performances by John Goodman and Courtney Cox are outstanding.  I wish the character that Courtney played in this film had come into my life.  What a dream.  But, let's face it, this is Hollywood.",1298764800,,502,4.904761904761905
7921811,3,B00004S89R,"This picture gives a good job at showing us the desperation that the compulsive gambler can be surrounded by.  Casinos would not necessarily like this film, because they may see it as ""negative.""  Pretty good story line, but a little bit too predictable.

John Goodman gives a chilling performance as a mafia gambling higher-up.  He has the evil down pretty well.",1137974400,,363,4.901639344262295
7921812,5,B00004S89R,"I happened across this movie the other night at my local pawnshop, and thought I would give it a try. This movie gives you a veiw of how deadly, addictive and destructive uncontrolled gambling can be. While I'm not a big John Goodman fan, I must say he played the part of ""Deepthroat"" exceptionally well. In fact, I don't think anyone could have played it as well as he. It was custom made just for him. Ron Eldard did great in his role as a runner and gambling addict, and he and Courtney Cox looked great together. I was disappointed that Joe Matenga's character was killed off so early. Also, Bokeem Woodbine did an excellent job as well.",1123027200,5,641,4.440677966101695
