8626764,3,B00GSCFKOA,.. not enough showing. Somewhat disappointing; a step-by-step how-to would have been the right way to do this.,1465516800,,110,5.166666666666667
8626765,4,B00GSCFKOA,This is a beautifully compiled book with easy to understand technical info.,1455926400,,75,5.333333333333333

8626767,5,B00GSCFKOA,"Forget about dry lectures in a classroom, these guys nail it for presenting good information in a conversational setting. My grandfather was a mason, and in the 70's he showed me how to determine slump, clay sand content etc., that was eerily identical to the techniques these kids show in this video. combined with the proven practicals these folks have delivered, rates 5 stars for this product.",1415750400,,397,4.940298507462686
8626768,1,B00GSCFKOA,"Disappointed in the CD, many questions not addressed.

8626770,5,B00GSCFKOA,"While not as technical as many would like, (those armchair engineers amoung us), this was extremely informative as to the basics of building a rocket mass heater and some of the more, unconventional thinking? that goes along with creating one in your home.  I for one saved a bundle in costs from dodging the obvious mistakes one has a tendency to make, such as building it in my basement, or in the middle of the structure, and finding a qualified contractor to put the hole through my roof... just some examples of the mistakes that I would have made without this DVD.  Erica and Ernie are fantastic people who share their passion for this type of low cost heating through many various media, and I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is serious about digging up some clay and trying it, and I HIGHLY recommend Ernie's advice to build one outside and run it for a month first, saved another bunch of cash working the bugs out in a safer enviroment, and it made for a nice warm bench in the Fall....",1396310400,20,1010,4.483695652173913
