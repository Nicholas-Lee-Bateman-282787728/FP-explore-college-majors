8335948,2,B001QKV5BQ,"If you want to see a movie with super close-up, black and white scenes of pro surfers talking about surfing, buy this. If you want to see pro surfers doing a lot of surfing, buy something else.",1360108800,,193,4.243243243243243
8335949,5,B001QKV5BQ,"This video knocks it out of the park!! An absolute must see for anyone who appreciates the legends of surfing along with the legends soon to be. This is the best video have seen in years. Incredible interviews from past to present, insane footage on sick waves, and the most perfect sound track anyone could ask for. Don't wait any longer, but it today. Guaranteed not to disappoint!",1335052800,,383,4.647058823529412
8335950,5,B001QKV5BQ,"Having been burned too many times by video reviews claiming a surf movie to be perfect, wonderful, etc. etc., with the worlds greatest soundtrack, that will appeal to anyone with air in their lungs, I want to avoid saying that this movie is for everyone. I'll be honest in saying that this is NOT a surf movie filled with fast paced, cutting edge surfing OR a wail-on-your-double-neck-air-guitar soundtrack (If you want that, buy stranger than fiction or any of the young guns). What it IS is a deep and honest look into the minds of some of the most important figures in the game -- past, present and future, filled with striking footage of what they do best, and set to music that forces the viewer to dig deep and reflect on their own true relationship with this sport. If you can connect with the real message of this movie, it might be one of the most important, motivating surf films you'll ever watch. It reaffirms what most of us feel about surfing, yet struggle to put into words. Equal parts great music, great surfing, and great inspirational insight, this move should appeal to anyone truly passionate about surfing. Surfers include Dane, Kelly, Mick, Occy, Sunny, Rabbit, Curren, CJ, Taj, Andy, Rob, Parko, and Kolohe Andino, who gives arguably one of the strongest surfing performances in the film and speaks with incredible maturity and insight for a kid his age. Soundtrack includes music from Black Keys, Bon Iver, Sigur Ros, Raconteurs and many others, and always seems to suit the mood of the scene perfectly. If you like Chris Malloy's other efforts, you'll have no problem watching this movie 10 or 12 times.",1248825600,2,1629,4.759717314487633
8335951,4,B001QKV5BQ,"How 'core' is the newest Woodshed Productions One Track Mind? NONE of the surfers interviewed are 'labelled' - it is assumed that we already know who the many talking heads presented in this film really are. Which is fine, if you play surfer magazine's ASP tour pool and have a broad knowledge of the sport. And make no mistake - the focus in this movie is on surfing as a hard core competitive sport - most if not all the footage seems to be from the ASP/WQS tour. The surfing is at an absolutely stellar level, but viewers looking for more soul stoke might want to go elsewhere, like investigating The Present; Thomas Campbell's (Sprout)superb new surf doc. The music - My Morning Jacket, Shins, Rogue Wave - is outstanding. Some great Dane Reynolds footage, too...",1247616000,2,767,4.647058823529412
8335952,5,B001QKV5BQ,"OTM has it all: Like every woodshed flick there is a great soundtrack. exceptional surfing, and stunning footage. A little different than other woodsheds in that there is actual interview footage spliced in with  the surfing segments, however this ends up creating a great story line and provides a interesting look at some of the most influential and progressive players in the game. $25 will get you this film or a case of beer in canada. My advice is get your hands on $50, and get beer AND the movie, and enjoy.",1245715200,2,515,4.5978260869565215
