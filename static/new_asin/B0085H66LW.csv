8525599,3,B0085H66LW,"This set was found in tha local Wal*Mart discount bin so I grabbed it, mainly to see the Bloody Murder films & see the horribleness of Children of the Living Dead (Directed by Tor Ramsey).
COTLD is deemed one of the worst zombie films universally. The director alleges the screenplay writers and editors are at fault for the choppy dialogue & senseless writing. It ends out of the sudden blue with NO resolution, which was its only point that actually bothered me. other than that, it was fairly entertaining and worth a once see. I have watched it twice since I've gotten this, and it is a touch better on second view. I don't think it deserves the negative hype it recieves, but then, I'm easily entertained. Tom Savini turned in a great cameo in the begining sequence, tainted a strange blue for some odd reason. The other actors phone in forgettable performances. 2/5
 Bloody Murder/Bloody Murder 2 are also featured. Friday The 13th rip-offs, the first is certainly better then its sequel. I do have to give them props in the sequel for casting that hot chick from Scarecrow with the BIG fine booty, and thank God they got her naked in a short shower scene. The death scenes are cheesey and unremarkable, but their worth a once see if your high & bored.
 Junior, while low-budget, was alright. The actor has good karate skills, and they attempt to showcase it but it doesn't ever go very far. The story writing is at times mundane but this isn't a total waste of time.
 There are others, but they were my least favorites of the bunch & I barely remember watching them, even though I know I did, one stoned evening once upon a time.",1425859200,,1636,4.538983050847458

8525601,4,B0085H66LW,"I wanted only one but for the price couldn't resist the set. I haven't watch all yet but 3 I really love and so I will say to anyone who wants a certain movie and it's on with others as sets go for it. I loved the twist and turns in the different movies that keeps you on your toes and just a slight pause so you can gather your breathe again. They will be not every ones liking but you'll find something you like in this set for sure. I rated this a B grade plus for the selection of movies that will amuse a lot of different people, Plenty of horror and with the pace it's not to slow and still get you involved that you'll not move until all is finished. The stories are fabulous and the cast made it a number 1 on my list for great entertainment. If in doubt go and grab it and be the judge and let others know what you think.  So what are you waiting for, get a move on grab the popcorn head for the lounge place your feet up and relax to a strange and eerie night of holding hands with your love ones.  Enjoy!",1393113600,,1015,3.898550724637681
