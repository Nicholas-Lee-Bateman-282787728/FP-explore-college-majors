3761414,5,B001PUTN3O,"Alright, I will warn you about this documentary (it's great by the way, so just stay with me on this). For me, this video gave me information that I kind of wish I didn't know. They did a substantial amount of research on site of the ice caps and their discoveries are quite disturbing.

With the glacial melting and the CO2 levels reaching record highs, the outlook for the future of global climate and sea level are not looking super pleasant, especially on the coast. This is an eye opener.",1276646400,3,493,4.477777777777778
3761415,5,B001PUTN3O,"This recent documentary has many aspects to recommend it.  For one thing, the film footage is beautiful and breathtaking.  For another, the film's message is extremely urgent: the effect of today's global warming specifically on the world's ice.

In a nice personal touch, the film follows one particular athlete-photographer as he travels the world to shoot footage of ""extreme ice.""  The title makes it sound like some extreme sport, and indeed it is for him, as he performs daring feats in his noble quest to photograph the ""inside story"" of global warming processes.

For example, the documentary features close-up footage of bright blue rivers of meltwater racing over Greenland's glaciers under the summer sun.  The rivers are absolutely gorgeous.  But then we see their horrible fate, as they plunge into gaping holes in the glacial surface and tumble into seemingly bottomless caverns.  The photographer actually dangles down into one of them, trying in vain to see any bottom to it.

Of course, thousands of feet below, unseen, all that meltwater finally hits bedrock.  There it acts as a lubricant, easing the movement of the glaciers atop the rock in their inexorable slide to the sea (gravity does the rest).  The effect is like that of the millimeter of oil which lets pistons slide easily up and down in their cylinders.  Only, the glaciers just keep sliding down into the sea - they don't return to land again.

That lubrication factor, we learn, is only one of those behind the glacial melting now accelerating on Greenland (and elsewhere).  Another is the increasing warmth of the sea water itself there in and around the Arctic, now several degrees warmer than it was just a few decades ago.  This contributes even more to the thawing, the glacial glide, and the rising seas worldwide.

Greenland's situation is especially worrisome for at least three reasons: 1. Its thick glaciers contain vastly more ice mass than does the thin ice sheet over the Arctic ocean (which is melting even faster); 2. That glacial ice, if or when it all slips into the sea, would definitely raise sea levels worldwide (up to 20 feet higher than at present); and 3. Greenland, unlike the purely polar ice, stretches way down into relatively warm latitudes (60 North: equivalent to the northern tip of Scotland), where air and water temps will soon get even warmer.

All of this portends disaster for humankind, of course, starting seriously within just another decade or two.  Terrible effects are already certain, but we can still stave off the worst ones, with careful planning and concerted effort.",1269129600,15,2598,4.974537037037037
3761416,5,B001PUTN3O,"This NOVA special presents results of the Extreme Ice Project in which time lapse cameras take hourly photos of glaciers for periods of a year or longer.  These images together with results of scientific investigations of polar ice caps, glaciers, and mountain glaciers, paint a vivid picture of the increasing rate of global ice melting compared to just one decade ago.

The discoveries of the increased rates of mountain glacier declines, and the forming and draining of Greenlands surface ice melt lakes is alarming.

I know that there are many people out there that believe that global warming is a hoax or a politicized issue, but scientific work, observations, and conclusions going back five decades are showing an increasingly clear picture of what is going on with the planet, and its climate.

Ice is melting!  And, faster than it can form.

Thanks for a fantastic glimpse into this important global historical event!

5 stars!

3761417,5,B001PUTN3O,"Here it is--the visual facts.  The cameras programmed for three years to photograph every hour.  The candid input of scientists who admit that they don't know what affects the glaciers.  Global warming first-hand.  Rivers of water and lakes that empty suddenly and then watch huge, miles-long icebergs calve off the glaciers.  Beauty and horror and science and under-the-nose facts caught on cutting-edge photography. Don't miss it...",1263340800,4,434,5.515151515151516
3761418,5,B001PUTN3O,Drop the blogs.... and watch this movie. Stunning imagery. Daring feats. Forthright on implications. I'm looking for a BluRay version...,1263340800,4,136,5.85
3761419,5,B001PUTN3O,"The combination of art and science is powerful in portraying the most important phenomena of our time, the disappearance of the arctic ice, the canary in the global warming coal mine.  The art is grand.  The science validates the story.  Together they make a gripping drama that today seems far away but in reality is on a fast track to tarnish and threaten our lives.",1257120000,12,368,4.630769230769231
3761420,4,B001PUTN3O,"This is a truly frightening video.  I saw it on PBS.  It shows the actual melting of ice on both the northern and southern ends of our planet.  The people who made this film truly had courage.  There is an element of horror watching a man lower himself into a giant hole in the ice hundreds of feet deep.  The footage from Greenland was particularly disturbing,  showing how holes in the ice are now opening up inland as the ice melts and water pours from under the ice to the sea.  The staff of this show deserves a lot of credit for the courage they showed in going out and getting this footage for us.",1244505600,16,604,4.2
3761430,5,B001PUTN3O,This is a great lead into another that Balog has coming out called Chasing Ice. I have seen both and they give you a real understanding as to the controls we need to face regarding our Planet.,1375747200,,192,4.216216216216216
3761431,5,B001PUTN3O,"This is not only gorgeous to watch but informative. It's a great way to see more of our wonderful beautiful nature we are fortunate to have while it's still here. Whether you're ""pro or con""  global warming, it's worth a purchase. The ice really is a living creature.",1374278400,,267,4.5625
3761432,4,B001PUTN3O,I liked it. It makes you think about the future. How to stop it is another question. Are we to late?,1371945600,,100,3.8095238095238093
3761433,5,B001PUTN3O,I really liked this film for the beauty it portrayed.  There is also a serious message concerning global warming and the melting glaciers.  The photography is incredible and the commentary is very interesting.  I would recommend this film to anyone who loves nature.,1367539200,,266,5.1395348837209305
3761434,5,B001PUTN3O,"For my traveling mother,  She loves it.  She has watched the video and is using it to plan her next trip.",1361750400,,105,3.9523809523809526
3761435,5,B001PUTN3O,This is a dazzling portrayal of the deterioration of the great Icecaps and glaciers of the world.  Some heart-stoppin sequences of scientists decending into huge cravasses.,1360195200,,172,5.615384615384615
3761436,5,B001PUTN3O,"I will carry this around and view it with anyone who will watch. Besides being fascinating, it is a real-time documentary of what is happening to arctic regions on this planet, which will (or already do) affect us all. A real wake-up message wrapped in beauty.",1358553600,,260,4.673913043478261
3761437,4,B001PUTN3O,"There's a documentary in the theaters now called Chasing Ice. Is this video related to that movie? The playing times are about 20 mins different, but I think the researcher is the same. Does anyone know if the documentary from the theater is going to be released on DVD??",1355529600,,271,4.551020408163265
3761438,4,B001PUTN3O,Video interesting and valuable. It is visually effective and seems balanced and authentic in its scientific presentation (layman's view). As an adult I found it compelling and plan to present it to a younger audience as well; it seems nicely tailored for that.,1353456000,2,260,5.069767441860465
3761439,5,B001PUTN3O,Phenomenal film.  I have never fully understood the impact of global warming or glacial movement before seeing this film.  Photography is exquiste. Have viewed three times now...,1341014400,2,178,5.555555555555555
8334737,5,B001PUTN3O,Good movie about climate change.,1438473600,,32,5.6

8334739,5,B001PUTN3O,Again the this movie shows what is happening to our planet.,1413676800,,59,4.454545454545454
8334740,5,B001PUTN3O,"Good, very good, however Chasing Ice is more breathtaking. Don't forget that the Blu-Rays always have more data, visuals and Chasing Ice extra content is outstanding!",1410220800,,166,5.423076923076923
8334741,5,B001PUTN3O,"Along with 'Chasing Ice"" , I loved the way this presents the facts of the climate changes happening now. Since moving to Alaska a few years ago, I have been saddened and scared by how fast I see the glaciers shrinking. People who don't believe this is happening need to watch this, and come to Alaska to see for themselves.",1403308800,,323,4.4
8334742,5,B001PUTN3O,I've watched this one and the one called Chasing Ice and even though both are great. This is by far the best of the two,1395792000,,119,3.8
8334743,5,B001PUTN3O,"Enthralling landscape and appalling research findings at the same time.  Who could resist?  I must have watched it ten times already, and will do so again.  Well done, I say, well done, and thanks for educating us ostriches.",1392854400,,224,4.842105263157895
8334744,5,B001PUTN3O,"The result of the speed of this glacier breakup could lead to extreme flooding on coastlines and island nations around the world. If you live near a coastline, I highly recommend this DVD.  It appears that global warming could occur sooner than was expected. For example, Glacier National Park no longer has glaciers. Fortunately I live in Sacramento, which is about halfway between the Pacific Coast and Lake Tahoe.",1387929600,,416,5.028985507246377

8334746,5,B001PUTN3O,"The photos and videos do not lie.
I am convinced that the climate is changing. I am not sure
what the effects will be. It is great to be able to see this
on video rather than on location.",1381017600,,187,3.8205128205128207
