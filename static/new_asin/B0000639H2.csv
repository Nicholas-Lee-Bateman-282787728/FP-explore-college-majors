1688083,3,B0000639H2,"It's an OK movie, but it's kind of slow.  The acting was fairly good, but the screenwriting definitely wasn't the best. But I somewhat enjoyed it because Maria Conchita Alonso is still very good looking, even in her older age.",1461456000,,226,4.65
1688084,3,B0000639H2,Good interesting outing from Maria Conchita Alonso even though the story is lacking.  Could have been better but the lovely Miss Alonso makes it worthwhile.,1423958400,,156,5.24
1688085,5,B0000639H2,Maria Conchita Alonso stars in this  film as the  wife of  a Rich American businessman  who gets  kidnapped in Mexico. The  film  is definitely a B picture but is not  bad.,1405036800,,172,4.32258064516129
1688086,3,B0000639H2,"Blind Heat is a decent action/suspense ""B"" movie, with a few twists, but a rather predictable outcome.  Most of the actors turn in a solid performance.",1377475200,,151,4.8076923076923075
1688087,3,B0000639H2,"I really couldn't concentrate on this one, didn't seem to make it.  The only reason to watch it is to see the absolutely stunning Maria Conchia Alonso.  She is the real gem in this movie.",1338595200,,187,4.314285714285714
1688088,1,B0000639H2,"Maria Conchita Alonso was 43 years old when she starred in this movie. She's still as beautiful and feisty as she was when she co-starred with Arnold Schwarzenegger in 'The Running Man'. This is what makes this moronic piece of soft-core, which she actually produced, so disheartening. Is this what she's been reduced to in order to snag a leading role? The most recent thing I saw her in was the Sisters Duff masterpiece 'Material Girls' where she plays - what else? - a feisty Mexican housekeeper. Hey, if you wanna see Conchita naked (and who wouldn't?) then check this film out otherwise if you do see 'Blind Heat' you'll wish you hadn't.

Alonso plays the bored wife of a businessman who gets kidnapped and held for ransom. The reasons for her capture are never made clear nor do care. Blindfolded, but not handcuffed, she's thrown into a cell and forced to wait for her husband to pay up. The husband, not sure what to do, is advised to hire a ""negotiator"" to help him get his wife back. The negotiator is played by the usually exciting Jeff Fahey who instead seems really bored and confused as to what the hell he's doing here. There are some pathetic attempts at action involving Fahey and several masked extras shooting machine guns but they fail to excite. So instead director Adolfo Martinez Solares shoots a couple of steamy sex scenes between Alonso and the best looking of her captors. Naturally the scenes are exciting but they're ridiculous on many levels. First off, I understand she's  a bored housewife but why is she suddenly so eager to sleep with a man who has not only kidnapped her but is holding her prisoner as well? Second, she isn't handcuffed so why doesn't she take off her blindfold in order to get a good look not only at who she's letting touch her but at her kidnappers so she can identify them later? I doubt anyone watching these scenes will be concerned with plot logic but I'm just saying. There's no point in going on. The movie sucks, Fahey knows it and Conchita gets naked. Your call.",1269561600,3,2025,4.5911602209944755
1688089,2,B0000639H2,"This movie has an intriguing plot. But the script was very weak. What I liked the most was when Victor made the decision to save Adrianna, even though it would cost him his life.  But if you are a die-hard fan of Maria Conchita Alonso, add this to your collection, but don't forget to see her in ""Caught"".",1245628800,,305,4.258620689655173
1688090,4,B0000639H2,"I just saw this movie yesterday on cable it was great but I missed the begining, to bad you don't have it in stock. I recomend it just because it shows how someone can do anything for love.",1214870400,,189,4.0
1688091,1,B0000639H2,"This is one of those ""movies"" that never should be released. Good to see Mrs. Alonso in good shape but the story is weak and the acting......
