And, in each category, the moviemakers are trying to outdo each other, in terms of being more innovative. So it is an immense risk to make old-fashioned dramas, not necessary romantic, but about life's daily struggles. Despite all the trends, they still need to be made, as to document our times. The very engaging ""Fireflies in Garden"" does just that: it is a painful and passionate look at a given modern family, like many others in this crazy planet.

Right at the beginning of the film, we meet Michael Taylor (Ryan Reynolds, in a well-acted dramatic role), a successful writer that is on his way to his hometown to celebrate his mother Lisa's (Julia Roberts) graduation from college. Michael is kind of hard to read or understand, and you can feel that for some reason he is unwillingly going back home. Once he arrives to his hometown, tragedy strikes, and what was supposed to be a happy celebration turns into an incredibly sad occasion. Once in the house, facing the harsh reality in his life, he is sadly taken to his past and his relationship with his disturbingly strict father Charles (Willem Dafoe), a successful college professor of literature, who is being groomed to be the president of his prestigious teaching institution. Michael also has to re-examine his bonds with his sister Ryne (Shannon Lucio), and his aunt Jane (Emily Watson).

Well-directed by Dennis Lee, ""Fireflies in Garden"" is about how the past defines the present, and the struggles that we have to endure to accept it. It goes right to the heart and I'm glad that I watched it. The DVD includes a making-of documentary. (USA, 2007, color, 89 min plus additional materials)

3852693,1,B00267B3TC,"Worst movie EVER! From the highly confusing bouncing back and forth between current time and historical time, to the two disgusting animal killing episodes - 1) teasing fish to the surface with cheese then scooping them up in a net then inserting a firecracker in their mouths and skipping them across the lake and blowing them up and; 2) running outside on a summer's evening and wacking away at fireflies with badminton nets, this couldn't have been a worse movie. I never even made it through to the end. As soon as they started killing the fireflies, I ejected it. Shame on the actors and director for portraying these two scenes as if the activities were okay.

3852697,1,B00267B3TC,"This is a terrible film. The title, which sounds delightful, refers to the protagonists gleefully slaughtering the said insect population on summer nights. (Apparently, fireflies explode like fireworks when swatted with a tennis racquet.) The massacre scene is the only time in the film when the characters are happy -- maniacally so. The rest of the movie is about the miserable lives of odious people. The main character remembers unfair and borderline abusive moments from his childhood throughout the film as he plays out his adult resentment of his father in the present. The problem is that the man is a supreme jerk. He was a brat as a kid and he is a creep as an adult. There is not one character who is sympathetic. The father is abusive, the mother is a doormat, the assorted other relatives are all horrible people. This movie has a stellar cast and I hated them all. Who green-lit this bit of rubbish?

3852729,3,B00267B3TC,"This movie tried to be good.  It tried to be good so hard. And I wanted to love it.

The most I can say is that it was touching.

But beyond that, there are just too many things that just didn't make sense, that didn't match up.

Let's start with the mom.  It was never addressed that the mother was just as much at fault for the abuse as the father was for letting it happen.  Granted, they may have been going for ""realism"", and that part was sure realistic.  But then we have Jane.  Growing up, she vowed to protect him, no matter what.  YET as an adult, she acts like she's so very angry with the main character (most likely for the book issue) and even goes as far to blame them both when they are arguing at the table, when everyone can clearly see it was the father who caused it.....who ALWAYS caused it.  And Jane knows this, yet is quick to point just as much blame on Michael as she does Charlie.  But she SAW Charlie abusing him as a child.  My question: Why she is okay with this now?  Why did she stay in his life?  Why is she angry about the book?  It seems to me as though the there was one plot point and one plot point only:

Get over it.  Your childhood is over, and you need to move on.  Even at the expense of your sanity.

Everyone abandons Michael.  Notice that?  His mother dies (so unintentional abandonment).  Jane abandons him by acting like the abuse (which is still going on) no longer matters.  Charlie abandoned him from birth.  His mother abandoned him as child by allowing the abuse to happen.  And his wife abandoned him by being an alcoholic.  So is this movie about abandonment?  It sure feels like it.

Another part in the movie that I despise: His mother was ready to leave his father when she thought he was cheating on her.  But mentally, physically, and verbally abuse her son and that's okay!  This part made me hate her.

And in the end, Michael abandoned himself by burning the book.  ""It's okay, dad!  You were hugging me at a birthday party in front of a camera (which most narcs will be sweet in front of a camera) so that makes my entire childhood and adulthood of being abused by you A-OKAY!""

He burns the book.  Which I guess means he's not publishing it.  He is in no way healed after this event.  He had a good moment with his dad, by watching a good moment (a probably fake moment at that) from the past.  But their relationship is in no way healed.

Honestly, Charlie seems mentally ill.

So what was the point of this movie again?  A snapshot in time of a family event (a funeral)?  There is no real ending, because without actual closure (which did not happen), psychologically, Michael could not actually heal and be okay with it all.  And why didn't he ever ask Jane what her effing problem was?

CONFUSING!  What why did he have that bracelet on?  They kept on showing it, but it was never talked about.

ARRGGGGHHHHH!  Honestly, I wanted to love this movie, but it drove me batshit crazy instead.  Even my husband was confused by who Jane was because of the 180 of her personality as an adult. And there was no backstory as to why.  The book?  Why would she give two craps about hurting Charlie (which seemed to be a big deal to her) when she WITNESSED the abuse?  She seemed like she morphed into her enabling sister.

So, tell me again, what was the point?",1433548800,3,3319,4.286407766990291

3852737,3,B00267B3TC,"A little bit of an emotional movie, with a couple messages in the end. However I didn't find it to be all that impactful. One because a third of the movie I spent confused about who actually died (which makes it hard to relate or understand the emotions of the characters), and it doesn't get reveled or confirmed for sure until another 2/3rds into the movie. So that alone makes it not the best. Secondly the there is like four different story lines doing on throughout the movie and pretty much none of them actually go into dept enough to be resolved or even make an emotional connection with the move. The whole movie seems a bit confusing and unresolved, slightly good and get not impactful. I would give it an ""OK"" rating.",1412380800,2,728,4.481203007518797

Ryan Reynolds as Michael, Willem Dafoe as Charles, who most of the time I wanted to strangle for his love of self,and not his son,wife or anyone else in his life.  Ryan Reynolds looks amazing with the beard and the glasses and the brown eyes that actually look tortured. You buy into this family,because as I wrote first,you knew (or might now know) one like this. There is some language that I wish hadn't been added,but they haven't learned what works like the KENDRICK BROTHERS have. Julia Roberts really is pregnant in this movie. She always has that tired look in her films,and as a woman you know she has to be pregnant in real life. Indeed in this she is and it is perfect for the scene she uses with Michael. I honestly think that this movie heals men who had dads like Michael does in this movie. Where daughters can cry,sons are not usually allowed to. I would recommend this movie because it doesn't hurt for anyone no matter our walks in life,to have a look at someone elses,even if it hurts.

Ryan Reynolds has little screen ""presence"", and designated sk*nk, Carrie Moss, could've easily been cut from the film, but the rest of the cast were very good, in roles mostly too lean to satisfy.

Finally a stupid ending robs the viewer of the much anticipated justice (for the despicable abusive father).",1360800000,,574,5.010526315789473

This is definitely not a feel-good movie. This is a story of a tortured father/son relationship and the father is just plain mean. I watched this movie with a heavy heart and a box of tissues and there was no relief at the end.

3852761,5,B00267B3TC,"This is one of those sleeper high quality films except it probably won't get noticed terribly in DVD sales simply because it doesn't have explosions, isn't a rom-com and wasn't recommended by the Academy Awards. It's too bad because there's a lot of high quality acting and wonderful tone setting in this family drama.

Tale focuses upon a romance novelist reflecting on his abusive time as a child in which his father verbally and physically abused him and put him through ""torture"" when he was displeased with the boy. Now, after the death of his mother, he has to face his father's anger as well as all of the other dysfunctional family members. He's got a novel written that is about his life growing up and basically lays out all the family dirt and he's trying to decide whether to get it published or not.

There's a bittersweet taste to this film. At times you laugh, at times you feel like you just got hit in the gut and other times you feel people are going to work out their differences. It's one of those films that tries to reflect real life so sometimes there are no happy and complete resolutions but for myself I left the picture feeling satisfied with the delivery. It's nice to see a film every now and then that admits things aren't always resolved like a fairy tale. That's called fantasy, people. That said, I felt the main character worked things out just not in a Pollyanna manner.

There's an all star cast here, including several who took supporting roles: Willem Dafoe, Julia Roberts, Carrie-Ann Moss, Emily Watson, Ryan Reynolds, Hayden Panettiere and Ioan Gruffud.

The budget for this picture was $8M (which tells me a lot of big names took pay cuts to work on a project they believe in) but it only made a bit over $3M at the Box Office. We'll see if it does better in DVDs and residuals.

Written and directed by Dennis Lee. Some say his tale is autobiographical. Note that the movie was edited and seems to be missing over 20 minutes so their may be a director's cut at a later point.

If you grew up in a totally normal, functional family, you probably will not connect with this movie and think it IS a horrible movie.  If so, consider yourselves blessed then and watch a different movie.  I had dysfunction in mine, so I could identify with all the characters and their feelings (and cried a few tears in places).

I, for one think that the movie is very realistic and a little different too. The script touches your heart. Superb acting by Ryan Reynolds and Julia Roberts but the best performance in the movie was Willem Dafoe's performance. He plays the cold and mean father to the T. I saw the movie in 2008. I have to say that the '08 version was better. There are some very critical cuts made to the US version. The edited scenes make the movie more beautiful.

3852776,1,B00267B3TC,"From the opening moments the overly exaggerated abusive father/husband seemed so unreal that the viewing audience is immediately skeptical of probably everything that will follow. Scenes such as leaving a young boy to jump out of a car in an isolated rural area, in the rain, to find his own way home. Also, calling a young boy a f-up was more laughable than enlightening. Then there was the scene when dad violently grabbed two young children by the fronts of their shirts and got into their faces. Story creation is one thing but trying to be over-the-top just for effect is cheap directing.

Dialogue from the adults sounded simply juvenile stupid. Acting seemed so method school acting that I could predict the facial expression with just a piece of dialogue. I don't know what's going on with Roberts lately and Dafoe is just typecast stuck. Directing was boringly predictable - the lengthy camera shots of the distracted driver prior to the crash; the prolonged close up shots of the wedding ring.

Always wary of movies with lots of ""Special Thanks"" for free stuff, 85 in this case of which my best two were to ""X Box"" and to ""Valdadice Pinot Grigio 2004 Wine"".

Then there was the final explanation that every tragedy is preceded by any number of ""ifs"". If this then this, and not this, etc. The girl hitting a ball into the street; boy chasing the ball; a wife putting on lipstick; an angry, not watching the road, driver; and any number of preceding events are excused by the writers as equal in the death of the wife. I should point out to the script writers that not all ""ifs"" are created equal - that they do not all have the same/equal impact or responsibility.",1330646400,4,1675,4.632996632996633

Throw in some random cruelty scenes such as blowing fish up with fireworks, smashing fireflies with tennis rackets (showing kids how to do both) and a completely unrealistic sex scene.  There was a shift in one character's demeanor that was very drastic and never explained.  We kept waiting for them to explain how she went from one personality to a complete opposite personality...they never did and so that change never made sense, just was very confusing.  I'd skip this one.",1330560000,9,773,4.907692307692308
3852778,4,B00267B3TC,"FIREFLIES IN THE GARDEN  is a perplexing movie. The story seems as though someone threw the script up in the air with the fireflies in the garden (a quite beautiful moment in the film that suggest the night gardens of John Singer Sergent's `Carnation Lily, Lily Rose'), shot it full of holes and then reassembled it the next groggy morning. Pieces are simply missing: we are informed that the original version is 122 minutes while this version is only 89 minutes and it is likely that in the missing 33 minutes many of the unresolved and very confusing elements of time and place and character development and perplexing moments existed.  Writer/Director Dennis Lee obviously had a fine story to share and a brilliant cast to offer it, but so much of it is missing that we are left frustrated.

Successful Romance novelist Michael Taylor (Ryan Reynolds) has completed his latest novel, a work of serious memoir literature in which he has recounted his childhood in an attempt to free himself from the influence of his demonic father, English professor Charles Taylor (William Dafoe) who seriously abused Michael as a child and for whom he holds little emotion but disdain. Michael has returned home for the college graduation of his sister Ryne (Shannon Lucio) as well as his mother's - Lisa (Julia Roberts)  - deferred graduation. But the celebration is altered by an accident: Charles swerved to not hit his nephew Christopher (Chase Ellison), hit a pole resulting in a crash that killed Lisa and injured Charles and leaves Christopher with a dark cloud of guilt that he caused the trauma.

We gradually meet the family: Lisa's sister Jane (Emily Watson) is the mother of Christopher and his little sister and has always been the closest friend of Michael when they were children (as children, Michael is portrayed by Cayden Boyd and Jane by Hayden Panettiere ),  At Lisa's funeral Michael's `ex-wife', AA reformed Kelly (Carrie-Anne Moss) shows up to add to Michael's angst.  From here the film jumps back and forth between the childhood of Michael and Jane and the suffering and abuse Michael endured at the hands of his grotesquely diabolical father and the secrets of that failed family life are gradually exposed and the traumatic present.  In cleaning out Lisa's things Michael discovers some information that alters his view of his past, and those discoveries lead to a change in the way Michael views his father and Jane's children and most significantly the demons that have burdened him through his life.

In addition to the fine work by Reynolds, Watson, Dafoe, Roberts, and all the other cast members, there is an important cameo for Ioan Gruffudd that opens the murk of the story well.  Though this journey through the progress of a dysfunctional family has been done many times before and even frequently using the protagonist as a novelist about to open the secrets of the family's lives to the world, this story take some significant  alternative routes that make it more tender. The uses of flashbacks could have been better edited so that the audience is aware of when the character changes occur, and there are many unanswered questions about how each of these characters came to inhabit the human roles they present here.  But given the fact that the audience must stay completely alert during this film in order to follow this at times meandering story, this is a worthy film.  One wonders why the missing 33 minutes were not included in the American release (the film was made in 2007 and it seems as though it never played the theaters, going instead directly to DVD). With a cast of this caliber this should have been a popular film.  But where did those missing pages take us?  Grady Harp, February 12",1330214400,43,3728,4.848818897637795
