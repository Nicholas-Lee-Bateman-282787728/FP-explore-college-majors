8286435,5,B001CB9DPO,"I just got the 1st and 2nd collector's set, today. They are awesome. Moomin is a great cartoon to watch with your kids.

I know British dubbed 52 episodes out of 78 episodes. So, there are still 28 more episodes to go. I really want to see them all.",1233273600,4,249,4.081632653061225
