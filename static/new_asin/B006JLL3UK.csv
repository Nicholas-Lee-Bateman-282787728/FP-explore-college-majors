8499445,2,B006JLL3UK,"In an attempt to prevent Eastern European terrorists from unleashing a deadly biological agent upon the world, the US accidentally does the same. This poses serious problems for President Kempers (Harry Hamlin) who is worried about re-election and the head researcher at the CDC Dr. Galen Bronty (Nastassja Kinski).  Their efforts to save the world must be balanced with the only two teen girls on the planet who actually want to spend more time with their parents.

Judging from the breaks in the film, it is easy to tell this was made for TV. It also includes a low budget made for TV sound track and some extra drama, like a jet full of children,  because saving the world can not possibly fill all 86 minutes. Almost laughable.

This is part of a 6 pack of films ""Contagious Outbreaks"" I obtained at Walmart from the $5.00 bin.
