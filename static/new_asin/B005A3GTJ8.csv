8463186,3,B005A3GTJ8,"The film starts out in Jotunheimen, Norway 1976 where we watch the ""little freak"" be abused by his father. He eventually kills his parents and is raised by his uncle (?) but is believed dead. Twelve years later a group of young adults go hiking and camping in this area and you can predict the rest.

This is a prequel to this ""Jason of the North"" series, like ""Wrong Turn 4,"" but not as good. The people I thought would be the last to die go first. Weapons include guns, traps, arrows, and various farm implements. This was basically a ""me too"" slasher with subtitles. The storyline at IMDB is too long. soft 3 stars

Guide: F-word. No sex. Brief nudity. Trivia: According to Billboard, Kim Wilde's cover song, ""You Keep Me Hanging On"" was at the top of Norway's chart for the first 10 weeks of 1987.",1476662400,3,801,4.405405405405405
