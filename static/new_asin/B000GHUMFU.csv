8132315,5,B000GHUMFU,This is a super cool film. Directed by the late great Fernando Di Leo and starring the one and only Henry Silva and Woody Strode. The direction is awsome and the plot is well paced. Not to mention that this is a great transfer by Notturno Cinema. If you have an all region dvd player then I suggest you pick this gem up at once.,1190246400,2,328,4.061538461538461
