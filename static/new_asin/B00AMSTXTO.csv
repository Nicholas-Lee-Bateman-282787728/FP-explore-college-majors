5455335,4,B00AMSTXTO,"Ah, Rugrats. What's not to like about growing up with the lovable characters known as Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, and Lil? Growing up in the 90s I'd constantly come home after school and watch Rugrats. Obviously when the first movie came out I went to go see it in theaters. It brings back the nostalgia of my childhood and because I have nephews who are now around the same age I was when the first movie came out - it's all good humor and fun to be able to share my childhood with them.

For those of you who are new or can't remember what happens in the first movie, Tommy received a new baby brother. There's quickly trouble in paradise between all the babies once they bring Dil (Tommy's brother) home. Needless to say they all go on this whirlwind adventure and through it you learn things like friendship, caring, and something called the 'Lizard' though I won't go too far into detail.

As for Rugrats Go Wild - This is actually the 3rd movie in the lineup of Rugrats movies. It actually goes The Rugrats Movie, The Rugrats in Paris, and then Rugrats Go Wild. So if there's some mild confusion as to what's going on - the newest baby in their group is named Kimi and she's Chuckie's step sister, Kiera is Chuckie's step mom. Really I think that's all the real clearing up I'd have to do.

So if you're a kid from the 90s who wants to relive the adventures of Tommy, Chuckie, Phil and Lil - then this is for you. If you've got kids and want to share a glimpse at The Rugrats - this is for you.",1378425600,,1494,4.253521126760563
