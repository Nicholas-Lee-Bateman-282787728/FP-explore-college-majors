6351397,5,B00JAD6BQK,"One of my favorite t.v. shows. Watching them brings back fond memories. A show before its time. A depiction of ghetto life with humor, truth, and grit. Where Jesus was head, and the father and mother were a team and didn't take no mess! A family that prays together stays together. You can't even find this type of show on t.v. these days, what a shame to have come so far, but not.",1438214400,,382,4.2465753424657535

6351406,3,B00JAD6BQK,"You get 4 discs in this set, each season (3 and 4) spread out over 2 discs each.  The show itself seemed to lose its luster in Season 4, starting with (SPOILER ALERT!) the death of the patriarch.  But I've enjoyed taking that stroll down memory lane to re-visit the Evans family in these seasons.

The quality of the recordings isn't that great and seems to suffer from compression issues (which is what happens when you try to cram so much onto so few discs), and starting with Season 2 there seems to be no ""break"" in the chapters when the show would have gone to commercial, so you can skip through the opening song but then must go through the entire show before the credits roll with no chapter breaks.",1428969600,,707,4.3816793893129775

6351408,4,B00JAD6BQK,I enjoy the Good Times series because it was one of a very few colored oriented shows when I grew up. It was not only a show but in many ways it help me with my own personal issues that I had as a young girl.,1427587200,3,208,3.5434782608695654

8649320,3,B00JAD6BQK,"Very funny show, up until season 4, then it goes abruptly from comedy to heavy drama. If you want the best of this show, watch seasons 1-3 only. Those are hilarious! The whole family loves them.",1524182400,,194,4.416666666666667
