1669223,1,B00005V0XH,"If you are a true hockey fan and someone who can recite the original Slap Shot word for word here's some advice... hide all sharp objects  while you watch Slap Shot 2 because you may kill yourself.
Slap Shot 2 painfully goes out of it's way to recycle all the brilliant lines of Slap Shot 1 into a ridiculous script.  I almost put my foot through the TV on several occasions.
It is arguably the worst sports movie ever made and anyone associated with it should be ashamed of themselves.  Only rent it if you're curious how bad it could possibly be... but rent a second movie that you can watch after you throw Slap Shot 2 out the window after ten minutes.
Actually what may be fun is get a group of people together... that way you can at least take pleasure in yelling at the TV every time something stupid happens (and trust me... you have no idea what you're in for... you can't even imagine how [bad] this movie gets by the end).  Slap Shot 2 is [very bad].",1019001600,6,960,4.258241758241758
1669224,3,B00005V0XH,"First off, I doubt you need this review to tell you what exactly your getting when you purchase (or rent) this movie. Its a straight to video with Steven Baldwin get the drift.
But now with that said let me give the basic describtion of the movie. It starts with the Chiefs playing agains Albany, of course there losing and the announcer say's the Chiefs haven't won a game in over 2 years. Then after the game, Coach (Baldwin) goes up to the owner of the team and talks to him, and he announces he has sold the team to a family corporation (Gary Busey), they later find out there having a name change (Super Chiefs) and being relocated to Omaha. Even to the players dismay, they are soon bought on the fact they will get a pay raise, in fact they will double there salary. At the press conference, Busey announces the Omaha Icebreakers (Globetrotters of the hockey world), and the Super Cheifs under new coach (some girl) will be there opponents. Its reveled the Super Chiefs will play 24 scripted games, of course they will lose, and 8 regular games. Also, there will be no FIGHTING!CURSING!TRIPPING!HIGHSTICKING! OR ANY VIOLENCE! Soon after, Baldwin finds out the real games won't happen. But even after learning his new ""girlfriend"" the new coach is only in this so she can show her real coaching skills and try to land a NHL job, he still takes Buseys money over friends.
I won't tell anymore of the story, but it really gets slow in the middle of this film, and as all you Hanson fans see they are not a big part of the movie. Even though they are part of the funniest in which they are given new jerseys and get into a argument over there number, when each jersey has Hanson on the back. Of course, Baldwin soon comes to the rescue after he switches there jersey between themselves. The Hanson are in the first 20-25 mintues of the film, with a sceen here and there..then disapear for the next hour of so as they are booted off the team by the Icebreakers ""coach"", a former broadway dancer and director ...They than appear though for the last 10 mintues of the film and the last game, even though they don't play much in the last game. Its basically Baldwin and his ""NHL Prospect"" Miller.
If this film was any other film but a Slap Shot production it would get a 2, but in honor of Slap Shot 1 it will get a extra star. Pretty good start, very very very slow Middle, and predictable and not so interesting ending. Worth renting, but not worth buying!",1018828800,,2457,4.4260485651214125
1669225,1,B00005V0XH,"The first clue to avoid this, is it went right to video.  Most of the funny lines were rehashed from the first one. Even at that it was a stretch for a laugh.
The Gordie Howe Elbow line was funny,,the first and second time,,but wore old after awhile.  I should point out,,I'm old enough to have seen Gordie and the Hanson/Carlson Brothers play in the WHA.
I wish I could say more about the story line,,but it's a very weak one. I've seen student films more entertaining than this was.
If you're a big hockey fan,,I would think you would want to  avoid this movie.",1018569600,2,563,4.3428571428571425
1669226,3,B00005V0XH,"Well, this movie had TV movie level acting and storyline.  But that doesn't take away from the quality of the film.  The image is crisp and free of artifacts.  Many shots are a little dark, but purposely filmed to give the atmosphere of ""creepy"".
You can tell they set out to do something, but somewhere it just fell apart.
The special features are too limited.  What would help this film is tons of extras.  This way the price is more attractive.
Rent it and laugh.",1018310400,,466,4.435294117647059
1669227,5,B00005V0XH,"Okay, here's the scoop.  If you are into all the artistic clap-trap that gets a movie nominated for the Oscars, this one is not for you.  But if you're a Real Hockey fan, you're gonna love this movie!  Put on your foil and be prepared to laugh till you cry. Not for the squeamish or faint of heart, this is a rousing, carousing, cursing and knuckle busting Real Man's hockey movie.  It does get a little soft in the middle, but the ending pays for all.  It's great to see the Hanson brothers again, just like Gordie Howe... GORDIE! (Get that elbow in the air!) Lots of fun and excitement.  Best of all the Hansons come out on top... WAY on top. If you loved the original, then you'll love this one too.  It is a little less serious, but a lot more fun!",1017964800,,752,4.180555555555555
1669228,4,B00005V0XH,"While not up to the high standard of the original Slap Shot, SS2 is a good addition to any Hockey (or Hanson Bros.) fans collection. Seeing the Hansons back on the ice is worth the price of the DVD on its own.  At times the movie seems almost formulaic, copying some of the better scenes from the original, but accepting this as paying tribute to one of the greatest hockey movies of all time, we can let that go.
The four out of five stars rating is based on those of us who love the original Slap Shot, so if it was not your cup of tea, you will want to give this movie a pass.",1017619200,5,579,3.9913793103448274
1669229,2,B00005V0XH,"I was excited to see the release of 'Slap Shot 2' not so much to see a good movie, but more along the lines of morbid curiosity on how they might drag the original through the dirt.
Once again, the Chiefs have been sold to a man (Busey) who wants to create a hockey showcase, much as the Globetrotters are to basketball.  Unfortunately, the Chiefs are to be the team that always gets beat up on.  The captain of the team (Baldwin) is faced with the classic problem of, 'what do you love more, the money or the game?'.  Of course, the (much older) Hanson's are back but their antics don't provide enough to save the flailing movie.
The on-ice camera work was great, also entertaining were occasional references to the original 'Slap Shot'.  The DVD extras were probably more entertaining than the movie itself which included an interview with the Hanson's as well as a 'making of..'.  The storyline reminded me too much of a Disney film (except with nudity and language) but given my choice, I would rather watch this than the Ducks.
Not a great movie yet not a horrible one either.  Certainly was better than 'Caddyshack 2'.  I would not say it ruined the name of 'Slap Shot', but it gives me the desire to watch the original once again and be reminded of what a great sports film it truly was.",1017273600,5,1294,4.4576271186440675
1669230,1,B00005V0XH,"I'll keep this short and sweet.  If you are a fan of the original, don't disappoint yourself with this one.  The movie is slow, the story is lousy, and the ""hockey"" is insulting.  The are two saving graces to this miserable excuse of a sequel - The Hansons are back!!! and there is a scene with Barry Melrose(NHL 2Nite) where he gives a speech about hockey that could bring a tear to the black eye of any hockey fan.  Unless you have to hear this, or just have two hours of your life to trash, DON'T waste your time or money on this one.",1017187200,2,537,4.134615384615385
1669231,2,B00005V0XH,"I waited with excitement when it was announced that Slap Shot 2 was coming out. Being a huge hockey fan and a huge fan of the first movie i went out the first day to buy this.
 The first movie is an all time classic and the latest attempt is an all time dud. The acting was horrible and the movie was extremely cheesey. Completely predictable..
In the behind the scenes section of the DVD the director said he turned down 3-4 scripts and picked this script. Bad choice!!!!
Save your money for something better.",1017187200,3,510,4.368421052631579
1669232,1,B00005V0XH,"This is the worst sequel ever...  The hanson brothers, the reason I bought the DVD, are barely in it and to make it worse it isn't even funny... although that should be obvious when you see Stephen Baldwin is in it.  In other words, don't bother with this movie... save the [money] and buy the 25th anniversary of the original Slap Shot... much better film.",1017100800,2,357,4.476923076923077

1669267,2,B00005V0XH,"I saw when I was looking for the original this one came up too. Until 2 weeks ago I did not even know this one existed. I got it because it wasn't too expensive and it was a good thing. I think there is a very good reason why you go from 1977 to 2001 to make a sequel. This movie did not disappoint it sucks that bad. It is almost so bad it is funny. A hint that it is that bad is Gary Busey is in it. Also you can tell that Stephen Baldwin is trying hard, but he isn't the most talented Baldwin brother. If you purely love the 1st one so much don't bother with this one. Unless you are really curious and can get it super cheap and can stomach hockey players as almost Ice Capades skaters. You just want them to get their asses kicked just for that. Other than being the current version of the downtrodden Charlestown Chiefs and the Hanson brothers are back, this one doesn't have a whole lot to do with the 1st one in my opinion. The Hanson brothers are, again, the best part of the movie.",1400457600,2,991,4.01010101010101

1669269,4,B00005V0XH,"A lot of bad reviews on this movie . It stars Stephen Baldwin and the Hanson Brothers. Now that might explain why this went straight to DVD but I am glad it did . I wanted to see the Hanson Brothers again . Clearly this is NOT  Slap Shot with Paul Newman , I knew that going in . But there are enough moments and JUST enough story to enjoy watching this . Getting to see the 3 Hanson brothers again was the reason I watched this . They don't disappoint as that was a treat for me . Clearly, I would of loved a movie called THE HANSON BROTHERS GREATEST HITS but this will have to do. I enjoyed it for what it was. If you go into this expecting Slap Shot with Newman you will be disappointed. But if you like Hockey, a little story and some Hanson Brother humor this is pretty good. I am not Siskel or Ebert but I am glad I watched it . Who doesn't like Old time Hockey!",1398556800,,868,3.9318181818181817
1669270,4,B00005V0XH,"It's not as good as the first movie, but....it's a good watch and well worth adding to your collection of sports humor movies.  Anything with the Hanson brothers is worth the watch.  I had the good fortune to meet two of the three a few years ago and they are just as funny in person.  For me.....hockey humor never gets old and this movie is a good example of hockey humor with a little humanity mixed in.  A good watch at a good price.  I did make the mistake of getting it in VHS, but...that's okay.  I am using it as a gift for one of my sons who has a VHS/DVD combo.",1384819200,,571,4.008849557522124

1669284,1,B00005V0XH,"The 2002 sequel to the classic, Slap Shot, which was releaseed in 1977,  should be shown during in-school supensions at high-school's nationwide; students would want to quickly return to the classroom, though parents may deem the showing of the movie cruel and unusual punishment.

The story again centers on the fighting, rowdy Charlestown Chiefs, who are bought by a family-entertianment company, relocated to Nebraska and scheduled to play in scripted games to demonstrate how a sanitized version of the game can be fun, wholesome family entertainment.

Starring Stephen Baldwin, Gary Busey and Jessica Steen, the real-life ribs on hockey - much too violent, pro teams owned by faceless corporations, franchises in cities with little interest in the game - are lost in a bulky script attempting to survive on one-liners and bits that are put together like a puzzle with missing pieces.

This slap shot ends up on the heel of the stick, bounces on the ice a few feet and slides aimlessly to a stop well before the empty net.",1200787200,,1026,4.982456140350878

1669286,2,B00005V0XH,"This movie has a lot of funny moments.  There was a nut joke in there which was funny, but it was so random it did not belong in the movie.  It was supposed to make you laugh, but it makes you laugh because it's a dumb joke.

Otherwise, most of the humor that is in it works really well, such as the Ice Breakers getting Viagra or how the Chiefs or ""Super Chiefs"" ended up with their new jobs.

What really takes the subtstance out of this movie though is that they do not cover the breaching of contracts as if that's not important.  Rather than making something come of it, they just suddenly end the movie.  Granted, they did not want to extend the movie because there was so much humor to fill up almost two hours, and the majority of the audience for this movie won't be looking for serious matters.  But the part they leave out just makes the story incohesive.  They make is seem as if the president of Claremont is the only one who could get sued, but what about the president's assistant, the Chiefs/""Super Chiefs"", and even the ""Ice Breakers?""  They all could sue for various other things that happened.

They are trying to mix childish humor in a more adult matter, and because of that I was hoping that instead of an expected happy ending, a certain team would not win in one of the games.  Actually, they would've probably been funnier because a team would be so bad that you even wonder how they made it to the NHL in the first place.",1146268800,,1447,4.302583025830258

The Hanson Brothers are still on the roster, apparently so the team can meet the league quota for 50 year olds. I don't want to ""ruin"" the ""plot twists"", so you'll have to sit through it to find out.  Must be seen to appreciate how god-awful it is.  Gary Busey zombie-walks through his role as a right-wing media mogul who purchases the team and moves them to Nebraska.

What I want to know is who is responsible for this (expletive of your choice here) sequel, what ... they were smoking and how they will be punished for it. And I believe execution is an acceptable form of punishment in this case.
The thing that set Slap Shot apart was the endearing characters. Where are those characters in this movie? I spent a whole movie caring nothing about the characters. The only ones who had any promise were the Hanson brothers, who as great as they were to see again, were getting a little too old and weren't in most of the movie. Now, I am no big fan of Stephen Baldwin, but couldn't we have found a better movie for him?
Do not buy this movie. Rent it. It's not worth it. As far as violence goes, it's a hockey movie. Language is what you'd expect from a Slap Shot movie. And the sexuality is brief. Don't see it if you can help it.",1019174400,7,995,4.1875
