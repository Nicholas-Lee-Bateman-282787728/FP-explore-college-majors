8166351,1,B000M56AKM,"This is truly one of the worst movies ever made with Lorie Saunders(SP?), Bobbie Jo on Petticoat Junction.  It's supposed to scare you but it's obviously a low budget movie with nothing frightning about it.  The only reason I remember this movie is because I saw it on TV in college, with Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, hosting the show and interrupting it and making fun of it. Right on up there with the Ed Wood movies and Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. Campy and hilarious with Elvira's comments, but not worth a penny without that.",1315958400,,534,4.552083333333333
8166352,1,B000M56AKM,"This movie attempts to be scary. Never was scared once. Man with an axe chopping through all the furniture to get to the screaming girl, what a unique idea. I'm being sarcastic. Picture quality of VHS tape I watched looks like the 4th or 8th generation copy of an 8 mm film by a college student. Maybe I'm spoiled by HD but this is a low low budget film to say the least. This movie is so campy you can smell the roasting marshmallows. The only thing that saves it is the attractiveness of Lori Saunders, who deserves to be in a better production than this. I can't believe I sat through the whole thing, I just kept waiting for the movie to become good.",1312848000,,654,4.24
