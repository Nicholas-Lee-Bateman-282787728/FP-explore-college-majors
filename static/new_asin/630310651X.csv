The movie 'True Stories' is completely different but fun if you know anything about Texas.  It's available on DVD.

I'll check out metube and see if anyone has pirated a few scenes from this concert.",1350604800,,368,4.6
7839162,5,630310651X,"I attended all three shows used to compile this concert film and it was nothing short of amazing.  Talking Heads songs never performed live before to the best of my knowledge.  It was over the Halloween weekend and the audience was jazzed.  Big fat sound from the well accomplished band.  As good, if not better than an Talking Heads concert I ever attended and I've been to a few.  I have the VHS and have converted it to DVD, but would buy a newly remastered DVD in a second.  My friends and I have fun picking ourselves out of the crowd shots.  I heard all proceeds went to the loving restoration of the Count Basie Theater.  Several national artists followed suit.  Leave it to David Byrne to make it about the architecture.  One of my finest concert(s) memories ever.  A must for any David Byrne or Talking Heads fan.",1320969600,,822,4.449664429530201

7839164,5,630310651X,"It's hard to believe this concert has yet to be available on dvd.  Look at all the crap on the market.  Maybe one day.  Until then, I'll keep the vhs player and hope for the best.
This is a great show and should be on dvd !",1241827200,,223,3.702127659574468
7839165,5,630310651X,"I was lucky enough to be invited to this concert and the video is as good as the experience. Let's have it on DVD, folks.",1199664000,,121,3.88
7839166,5,630310651X,"The only thing that could make this amazing concert video better would be a DVD release, but who knows when that'll happen. This is one amazingly rendered vision of a live show - so close you can see the sweat fly at points and yet with enough perspective that you can also see the spectacular brilliance of the stage show.
David Byrne maintains his creative vision by designing the lights, directing the video and still manages to have a ball performing, and it's infectious. The band he put together for this tour aren't household names, but each member is tops at what they do, creating masterful, fun music. The diversions he takes within songs (""Women vs Men"" and ""Lie to Me"" in particular) are truly breathtaking and this is the only place you can find them.",1060646400,6,764,4.625
