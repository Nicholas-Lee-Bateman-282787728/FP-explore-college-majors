7669189,4,B01BTMIXN8,"One of the reasons I switched cable companies this year was so I could get the Hallmark Movies and Mystery channel.  (Yes, it was also a little bit cheaper.)  Theyve started making some movies I was anxious to see based on cozy mystery series.  Within a couple of months, Id recorded a bunch of them, and there they sat on my DVR waiting for me to watch them.  I finally got around to watching the first Aurora Teagarden mystery, A Bone to Pick, and I enjoyed it.

Aurora (Candace Cameron Bure), Roe to her friends, is a librarian in a small Georgia town who is obsessed with real life murder.  In fact, shes a member of the local Real Murders club, which is how she had kept in touch with former librarian Jane Engles (Barbara Wallace) who has always seen a lot of herself in Roe.

When Jane dies due to health problems shed kept secret from all but her closest friends, Roe is shocked to learn that she has inherited everything, including Janes house.  When Roe heads to the house, she interrupts a burglar.  Then Roe finds a skull in the window seat.  A note from Jane convinces Roe that her friend didn't commit the murder.  But who is the victim?  And is one of her new neighbors a killer?

This sets up a great mystery as Roe must not only figure out who the victim might be but then figure out who had motive to kill this person.  The twists and turns were pretty good and kept me guessing until the end.

This movie is based on a book by Charlene Harris (and if the name is familiar, thats because she wrote the Sookie Stackhouse books that were turned into the TV show True Blood).  I have never read the books this film is based on, but I do know that, while this is first movie made from the books, this is actually the second book in the series.  I don't know why they chose to do that, but Im not too surprised based on how they are constantly changing the order for the series of movies based on the Hannah Swensen series.  Fans of the books will recognize any changes they had to make as a result, but I just went on what I saw here.

I will say I was overwhelmed a bit by the number of characters near the beginning.  In addition to meeting the suspects, we also get the characters that make up Roes life.  However, by the time the movie was over, I had everyone straight.

Hallmark has a reputation for a certain feel from their movies which includes a certain amount of cheese.  That is here in full force, and it seeps into the acting a bit.  Its certainly acceptable for a made for TV movie, but there is nothing here that will win any awards.  Aside from Candace Cameron Bure, the only other name in the cast I recognized was Merilu Henner who plays Roes mother Aida.

Ive got to admit, I also had a problem with the premise of the story.  Jane is really little more than an acquaintance of Roe, yet she leaves her entire state to the main character?  Yes, its so Roe will find the skull and solve the mystery, but it still seemed a bit farfetched.  Having said that, once I let that go, I really enjoyed the film.

So no, this isn't great cinema.  But it is a diverting made for TV movie.  If that sounds appealing to you, then you will enjoy A Bone to Pick.",1462233600,10,3180,4.230897009966777
7669190,1,B01BTMIXN8,Don't even bother with this movie it was not worth seeing. If you want to watch it catch it on Lifetime don't waste your money.,1461974400,5,127,4.12
7669191,5,B01BTMIXN8,This movie was a delight to watch. I can't wait for the other Aurora Teagarden mysteries to come out on DVD.,1461888000,3,108,4.190476190476191
7669192,5,B01BTMIXN8,"A Bone To Pick is the first in the series of Aurora Teagarden movie mysteries by Hallmark.  The book is actually based on the second book in the Charlaine Harris series, while the second movie Real Murders is based on the first book.

As I had read the books first, I was a tad confused at being plunked into the middle of the story but as the movie progressed, I saw that it made more sense to start with the second book because of the action involved.  It will be interesting to see how they deal with the story line as they back up and do the first book second.  Aurora's (Candace Cameron Bure) relationship with the police detective, Arthur Smith (Peter Benson), cannot be part of the story as he is now married to his fellow police detective, Lynn Smith (Miranda Frigon.)

The story begins with Aurora or Roe to her friends giving a presentation on a True Life Murder Mystery.  She, as well as a number of the other characters, are part of a True Life Crime group.  That includes Jane Engle, an elderly retired librarian, who sees a lot of herself in Aurora.

Aurora is a part time librarian who lives in and oversees some townhouses that are owned by her mother Aida Teagarden(a well-to-do realtor played fabulously by Marilu Henner.) She is not quite sure she is complimented by the comparison to Ms. Engle.  Ms. Engle is ill and passes away, leaving her entire estate to Roe.  Within a short time and after being a victim of an attempted burglary at her newly inherited home, Roe discovers a human skull hidden away by Ms. Engle.

From there, Roe's instinct for solving real life murders takes on a life of its own and she, along with her best friend and reluctant cohort, Sally Allison (Lexa Doig) go through some funny and fairly crazy stunts to try to solve the old crime.

The movie was a lot of fun to watch.  While I knew the ending, my husband did not and he was pretty enthralled trying to figure out the whodunnit.  For me, it was great to see the two-dimensional characters of the book brought to life in such a fun way.

I absolutely loved the friendship between Aurora and Sally.  I could imagine doing some of the same type of shenanigans with my friends that these two went through.  They sparked very well off each other and I hope that Ms. Doig will be included in future sequels to this story.

All of the characters were well represented.  I loved seeing Ms. Bure and Ms. Henner again.  I've been watching both of them for years (Ms. Bure from her Full House days and Ms. Henner from my beloved Taxi.)

The plot was well done (thanks to both Ms. Harris and to those who adapted her book to the screenplay.)  My husband did not figure out the whodunnit until just before the reveal, so it ranked high for him  as a mystery.  While I started the movie with the solution of the crime in hand, I really enjoyed every moment of it.  I saved my recording from the Hallmark Movies & Mysteries Channel and have watched it a couple of times since. I also plan to pre-order the movie as soon as it is available as mysteries are my favorite movie, television, and book choice.

While the subject deals with a murder whodunnit, it is absolutely in line with Hallmark's family friendly character.  The story is clean and is something you can sit down to watch with various generations of kin and not feel uncomfortable.  That is saying a lot with most of the movies and television series that are being filmed these days.  While there is a place and a time for more serious and involved shows, there is a need for shows that a family can watch together.  I always look to Hallmark for those times.  I'm happy that they have developed their new channel and are filming so many great mystery movies, one of which is the Aurora Teagarden series.  Currently, the book series ends at number eight but I'm hoping that, if the quality of production stays the same as it is for this movie, the movies will extend beyond that.  I love a mystery!",1461801600,19,3949,4.432732316227462

7669195,2,B01BTMIXN8,"Formulaic, poorly written storylines with very little depth. Too many characters and names to remember with no arch to their stories. Reveals are unexciting and boring. Waste of time. I love Candace Cameron Bure, and she does a good job acting in this series, but the other women in this series are absolutely maddening! Marilu Henner, who plays Bures mother, is verbally abusive to her! Can you say Mommy Dearest?! And her best friend treats her like an ignorant 5-year-old. Shes condescending and rude. Im not sure why Bures character chooses to spend time with these two negative women who constantly tear her down. Then theres her jealous coworker who is always trying to get her in trouble and her ex-boyfriends wife/cop who also treats her like dirt. Girl cant catch a break! I don't see that she has any true friends or allies in this show, which is just depressing and sad. The plots are weak and this series is disappointing. For good Hallmark Murder Mysteries, watch The Garage Sale Mysteries with Lori Laughlin and the Murder, She Baked series with Allison Sweeney! Those have depth of story and character development with people who love and support them in their sleuthing!",1515196800,,1186,4.876237623762377

The main character Aurora Teagarden is in a Mystery/Murder club where her and her fellow mystery sleuths try to figure out passed murders (Much to her Mother's dismay).  She has a strong natural curiosity, which often leads her into stumbling onto a murder mystery that needs solving. I love trying to figure out who did it before it is revealed.

7669209,2,B01BTMIXN8,"Great concept, poorly executed. After watching multiple episodes on the Hallmark Channel, it is clear Candace Cameron Bure doesn't do the role justice. Aurora isn't endearing. Some of the dialogue stalls, like the actors forgot their lines or something.

I like this type of show, but the entire Aurora Teagarden series was a flop for me. There is a deluge of these shows right now (Hailey Dean Mystery, Murder, She Baked, A Fixer Upper Mystery). They're all a little too slow, predictable and even boring at times. Most of the people look, dress, and act in a similar way. For me, this kind of show has to have a really great lead. Someone who's compelling even if the story follows a clear formula.

Lori Loughlin comes closest in the Garage Sale Mystery series. Her acting has enough depth to make her seem like more than a persistently meddlesome woman in peril and that show gives a little more focus to others around her to keep it interesting.",1500768000,,950,4.682634730538922

7669268,4,B01BTMIXN8,"At one point or another, everyone has probably fantasized about being left money and property by some distant relative or acquaintance. But probably none of those people fantasized about inheriting a skull.

And ""A Bone To Pick: An Aurora Teagarden Mystery"" -- adapted from the Charlaine Harris book of the same name -- has both those things happening to the titular heroine, meaning that she's now inherited a cold-case murder. While not too different from the other Hallmark Channel TV mysteries, this charming little murder mystery is elevated by the slightly-wacky friendship between Aurora and her friend Sally, as well as the comedic moments that leaven the story (skull in a handbag!).

Aside from being the favorite town librarian, Aurora ""Roe"" Teagarden (Candace Cameron Bure) is also a stalwart member of the Real Murders club, which gathers monthly to discuss historical killings. When fellow club-member Jane (Barbara Wallace) dies unexpectedly, Roe is shocked to find that she's inherited all of Jane's property, including a rather nice suburban house... which rather awkwardly sits opposite that of her ex-boyfriend and his rather surly pregnant wife, both of whom are cops.

But Roe is even more shocked when she finds someone breaking into her house... and then finds a human skull hidden in the window seat. Jane was never able to figure out who slew the poor schmuck or why, but Roe is determined to solve the mystery that she's inherited, especially since she now suspects that someone living in her neighborhood is the killer. The question is, can Roe figure out who the killer is before she ends up the next body buried in the yard?

""A Bone To Pick"" is a lot like the other fluffy murder-mystery movies that Hallmark has been churning out, and has a lot of the tropes you associate with such stories -- the cops are annoyed by the amateur, the heroine keeps stuff from them, et cetera. But it distinguishes itself by having a comic touch that is all Charlaine Harris (including a wacky misunderstanding involving a handbag, and a confrontation with the murderer that is hilarious... in a dark, sick way).

And Roe's impulsive crime-solving is constantly held in check by her more sensible, long-suffering pal Sally, who serves as the Burton Guster to Roe's Shawn Spencer. This is one of the strengths of the movie, because the chemistry between Bure and Lexa Doig is quite good, and the banter and patter between them (and sometimes Marilu Henner) absolutely sparkles. Honestly, these characters would be fun even if they weren't trying to uncover a murderer.

The mystery itself is a solid, self-contained little whodunnit -- there's a fair sprinkling of suspects for both the murder victim (since the skull is initially unidentified) and the murderer, leading to some awkwardness when Roe guesses wrong about something (""If you are suggesting that the VERY NICE MAN who is my editor killed his own son, I'm going to have to hang up on you!""). But the story never becomes TOO hung up on the murder mystery, and it effectively gives us some glimpses of Roe's day-to-day life (obnoxious coworker, mom nagging her to get married, pregnant wife of her ex-boyfriend hates her, etc).

The weakest part of the mystery is probably the romantic subplot, which really goes nowhere and accomplishes nothing -- Father Aubrey mostly stands around looking amused/befuddled at Roe's crime-solving antics. And that's about the limit of his relevance.

""A Bone to Pick: An Aurora Teagarden Mystery"" is a solid start to this series of TV movies, and pleasant way to spend an hour and a half, if you like your mysteries cozy and slightly comedic. Fun, gruesome and thankfully devoid of Yorick jokes.",1472083200,,3703,4.980582524271845
7669269,5,B01BTMIXN8,I really enjoyed the movie.  Good clean entertainment with a mystery that keeps you involved in the movie.,1471996800,,106,4.888888888888889
7669270,5,B01BTMIXN8,"Ive watched three different Hallmark mystery series recently, and Aurora Teagarden is the one Ive enjoyed the most. And its mainly because of the main character, who is adorable, and I think fits this part perfectly. You may remember her as D.J. Tanner from Full House, or have recently seen her on Fuller House.
I also feel as if the mysteries themselves are a bit deeper than the other series, with more twists and turns.

Another reason why I enjoyed this movie so much is that shes a librarian, is part of a True Murders book club, and solves mysteries. All three of those are things that appeal to me. If I could choose a book characters life, hers would be very high on my list.

One thing that amused me greatly is the cameo of Charlaine Harriss books in a library scene during the movie. Charlaine Harris is the author of the Aurora Teagarden mysteries, and it was actually her first series, long before Sookie Stackhouse (aka True Blood) or her Midnight, Texas Trilogy.

If you enjoy reading Cozies, or like watching mysteries without blood or gore, you should definitely check this one out.",1471651200,,1100,4.630769230769231

8751457,4,B01BTMIXN8,"Writer Charlaine Harris must be feeling good, what with three of her series having been adapted to moving pictures. HBO's True Blood - based on the exploits of psychic Sookie Stackhouse - was a massive hit. I don't think Midnight, Texas on NBC has been cancelled yet. Meanwhile, Hallmark Movies & Mysteries' Aurora Teagarden cozy mysteries are popular enough that there have been seven made-for-television movie adaptations so far with, no doubt, more on the horizon.

A Bone to Pick is the inaugural film. Me, I had never read any of Ms. Harris' stuff so this was my gateway to her world. It introduces Aurora Teagarden (Candace Cameron Bure) - or ""Roe"" - a librarian at the public library in the town of Lawrenceton. Roe is also a member of the Real Murders Club, a group of enthusiasts who gather monthly to discuss infamous baffling or unsolved true crimes. Roe adores being a member of the Real Murders Club. For cripes' sake, she wrote her thesis on true crime literature.

A casual acquaintance of Roe's is Jane Engles (Barbara Wallace), a nosy - I guess the kinder word is ""observant"" - elderly spinster who has the pulse of her block. When Jane passes away, Roe is gobsmacked to learn that she'd been named the beneficiary of Jane's estate which includes Jane's two-story house.

And it's a nice house. Not so nice is the human skull that Roe roots out from inside the bench seat at the bay window. This is when Roe should've gone and turned in the skull to the police. But this is when Roe's hubris takes over. She believes that old Jane Engles has left her an honest-to-gosh mystery to solve. So screw turning the skull in to the police.

Roe and her best friend, reporter Sally Allison (Lexa Doig), start snooping around the neighborhood and soon unearth some unsettling news. People having mysteriously vanished. A rash of break-ins a year ago. Roe's ex-boyfriend cop and his very pregnant homicide detective wife moving into the house across the street.

No, this movie isn't just amateur sleuthing in suburbia. Pesky normal life also intrudes. All her life, Roe has been bedeviled by her judgmental mother, Aida (Marilu Henner), the sophisticated local real estate queen who finds it distasteful that her daughter is so gung-ho about true crime. Mother is always up in Roe's business. And there's Roe's budding romance with a hunky minister (Stephen Huszar), not to mention, persistent barbs from her library co-worker, the prim and sour Lillian (Ellie Harvie), who is said to be ""meaner than a snake with a sunburn.""

Back to the mystery. There's no end of suspects, and no end of shenanigans for Roe and her reluctant sidekick, Sally, to get into. This being Roe's first direct involvement in a real-life crime, maybe she can be forgiven for her blunders and her stepping on toes. And maybe not. For much of the movie, I was cheesed because Roe was keeping key evidence away from the police. Her ex's always angry homicide detective wife is right. What Roe was doing amounted to obstruction of justice. Luckily for Aurora Teagarden, during her lowest moment, she does end up solving the case. Ultimately, I enjoyed A Bone to Pick. This is the power of the Bure, she who can brush off my concerns and win me over with how engaging she is. And I quite relished  Miranda Frigon's salty performance as Lynn, the homicide detective wife who kept mad-dogging Roe. I liked the steady dose of humor and the whodunit elements that kept me guessing. Like one of Roe's persons of interest, I was starting to believe that Jane Engles' neighborhood may be sitting on an ancient 1ndian burial ground. Things were getting that dicey.
