216363,5,6300182800,"Whenever I say the title of this classic '82 monster flick/New York cop tale, it sounds to me like some director shouting during a rehearsal, ""Cue the winged serpent!"" and some large, paper mache special effect is unleashed to swing across the set from above. That's completely off topic though.

This movie is awesome! I have wanted to see it again for a long time. They used to show it on TV in the 80's when I was a little kid on the late, late show. Some Friday nights (or maybe it was Saturday nights), they'd show the 80's Cat People, sometimes, An American Werewolf in London, sometimes an episode of Kolchak, sometimes Alligator, and sometimes this flick. Probably some others too, but I remember those getting played a lot. I have fond memories of those late night screenings on CBS weekend nights. This one does have a bit of that Kolchak feel, though a bit less comedic, but still quirky and funny at times. It's a pretty outlandish story, but it's not done badly in any way, so it totally works! Plus, this film, about a giant, winged creature once worshiped as a god by the Aztecs and now alive again and attacking citizens of New York, came out during a time when there was quite a scare of giant, most likely prehistoric birds being sighted and sometimes attempting to carry off children and dogs. You may have heard of a well-known attack in Illinois, and more sightings in an area near where I group up, south (very south) Texas. We were scared of that thing when I was little! Plus, there was a burger joint back then called Mr. Q, and supposedly it had been seen around that place, but maybe someone was just connecting the movie with their story. Anyways, all that aside, this is a great film!

David Carradine of Kung Fu and Kill Bill fame stars as a New York detective trying to solve some ritualistic murders in the city that have disturbingly skinned victims. Suddenly, he's faced with a rash of strange attacks from above as well. Michael Moriarty is a down on his luck, wannabe musician who frequently falls back on a life of crime because he sees no other option. Agreeing to be a getaway driver after an audition falls flat, he rushes from the scene of a failed robbery one day and attempts to hide out in the top of the Chrysler building. There, he discovers the nest of the creature, Q, better known as Quetzalcoatl, and decides to get all he can from the city before revealing its location. Meanwhile, the great bird lizard is picking people off one at a time in gruesome fashion. And there's that question of whether this is tied to the ritualistic murders or not too, which seems quite clear to Carradine, if not to his superiors. Well, no one wants to believe that some moldy Mexican god is gonna drop in on Central Park West and start tearing up the city!

It's tempting to say the driving force behind ""Q"" is the fantastic acting from the likes of Moriarty and Carradine, and everyone else in the cast, but the cool creature scenes and vicious attacks deserve their credit too. This film is just a great concept done beautifully. It's a true classic you might not have ever seen. If it sounds interesting to you, definitely check it out. The blu-ray is super nice and includes a vigorous commentary by the film's director/writer/producer as well as a teaser and trailer. Not a ton of extras, but great stuff nonetheless. Look, this was released in an era from which pretty much all the horror/monster flicks are worth giving a chance, so don't miss out on this one! Especially if you're a Kolchak the Night Stalker fan. It just reminds me of that and stuff like Alligator and C.H.U.D., etc...Great stuff!",1466726400,,3640,4.562691131498471
216364,3,6300182800,"This review is for the Blu-Ray edition of 'Q: The Winged Serpent'(1982) released in 2013 by Shout! Factory.

I saw 'Q' for the first time on cable in the early 80's and watched it several times because there weren't a lot of channels to watch back then. I was curious to watch it again to see how it held up and if my memory was correct and their wasn't a lot of footage of the monster. I was correct there wasn't a lot of footage of the monster. Very little despite what the director says in the commentary.

DVD & EXTRA'S: The blu-ray quality is decent but not extraordinary. I'm always thankful to the distribution company, in this case, Shout! Factory, for making these old lower budget movies available on blu-ray so even if the pictures wasn't remastered I'm ok with it. The extra's provided are the commentary track by director Larry Cohen and a Theatrical trailer. The commentary track is very good. It gives a lot of information and many interesting facts.

PLOT/SYNOPSIS: Q starts with Detective Sheppard (David Carradine) is investigating some grizzly deaths along with Sgt. Powell (Richard Roundree of 'Shaft' fame). Apparently people are willingly being skinned alive. These acts seem to involve some sort of ancient Aztec ritual which we know is done to summon Quetzalcoatl, the winged serpent. We also get to see a window washer meet Q with the expected results.
Jimmy (Michael Moriarty) is a small time crook who is supposed to be trying to go straight. He has a girlfriend (Joan) who likes to help and date losers like Jimmy. Jimmy goes out and gets involved with a bunch of other crooks and is given the job of driver in a jewelry store heist. The heist goes bad and Jimmy goes on the run and somehow ends up at the top of the Chrysler building. Jimmy goes wandering to the top and finds an unbelievably large nest with an equally unbelievably large egg. Soon after Jimmy hears of all the strange deaths and figures out that he can make lots of money. He agrees to reveal the location of Q's nest to the city of New York if they grant him immunity for past crimes and pay him one million dollars. The city gives in and Jimmy is now a rich man. However, Detective Sheppard makes him come along for the ride when the police department go to the site of the Q's nest. Sheppard, Jimmy and the police make it to the top of the Chrysler building and Q shows up right on Q for a battle against New York's Finest.

PRODUCTION: Most interesting is the fact that it almost starred Bruce Willis and Eddie Murphy. The director wanted both of them in the movie but was overruled by the Producers. Bruce Willis would have had David Carradine's part but Bruce Willis was an unknown at the time and they needed somebody with a name. I don't remember if the commentary track said Eddie Murphy was up for Richard Roundtree's role or for the lead.
The movie was obviously shot in and around New York. For me, the most interesting parts of the movie were the shots taken inside the Chrysler building. Those are actual shots in the top of the building by the windows. The only part that wasn't shot there was at the very top where the nest was. That in itself was a very interesting story. Larry Cohen tells the story of how years later the nest caused all kinds of excitement and confusion because it was left behind in the building it was filmed in and nobody had been up in that part of the building for many years when it was discovered and believed to be real.
At first I wasn't sure if the shots were real. I thought to myself how could the top of the Chyrsler building look like that. But it is in fact real. Cohen went higher than he was supposed too. He had asked for permits many times before he got them. He went into areas he wasn't supposed to go. You see junk all over the place. There are also some dangerous ladders that they climbed in order to get those shots. At the end you see people hanging outside they windows. That is not a special effect. They actually had the actors hanging outside!
I also found the part about the smaller Statue of Liberty interesting. Cohen tells the story of how it ended up on the top of the building he shot on in the commentary. I don't ever remember hearing about it before.
Most of the shots of Q, were stop motion shots. Only some of the closeups were not stop-motion. There isn't a lot but what's there is good for the times.

SOME ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS: I find it almost unbelievable that nobody in New York City saw Q. Especially since he is flying around in the daytime. I know this was before cell phone camera's but really, nobody saw him flying around? 8 million people in New York City and nobody looks up when Q is flying around. You'd figure they's at least send for the national guard with a flying monster on the loose. Another completely unrealistic moment is when Sheppard sends Jimmy up the latter first. I mean, really, the police send up a civilian to do their dirty work? I know Sheppard was pissed at him for holding up NYC but this is just ridiculous. They didn't even give him a gun.

Overall, I'd say this is a decent darly 80's sci-fi/fantasy movie. You can't really call it 'kaiju' but it is sort of a monster movie. It's not great but it's not the worst way to spend an hour and a half either. Stop-motion animation was nearing it's end at this point. We were a decade away from Jurassic Park which would change monster animation forever.

Recommended for 80's sci-fi fantasy fans. Today's generation would find this just a tad boring.",1462492800,2,5509,4.4485148514851485

KEEP WATCHING THE SKIES, but you better wear safety goggles.  I only bought the disc because my wife's favorite NY building is featured on it.  Sad to see that the inside is rust and trash.

216369,5,6300182800,"The most life-affirming monster movie ever made  Cohen understands his characters as people, not canon fodder, and so his focus on their amusingly mundane foibles evokes a sense of actual life that renders irrelevant the b-movie special effects and implausibility of the premise. It's a wonderfully funny and deceptively complex analysis of crisis as the catalyst to a deeper engagement with community  the city pulses with selfishness, but Jimmy's eventual rebirth as a decent person is representative of our better instincts prevailing when matters of life and death jar us from quotidian abtraction. Cohen stuffs (haha) the film full of unpretentious tossed off human details that read as both specifically New York and totally universal - the cop furtively sipping a Budweiser before resuming his crisis post, the aimiable pervert cheering as the girl takes off her top, the waitress shifting from smile to irritation the second the customer isn't looking. It reminds us that we are watching human beings, however stylized, and their story is the story of all us who toil anonymously until fate intervenes to test our mettle. Showing us a 9-11-aftermath mentality a decade before 9-11, Cohen reminds us that even in our worst circumstances, yes, even in a movie (!), we can tap into our reservoir of goodwill without losing the idiosyncracies that make us uniquely prickly humans.",1446163200,4,1384,5.201793721973094

216413,4,6300182800,"The only thing the critics liked about this movie is the very thing that keeps me from loving it...........Michael Moriarty's erratic and undisciplined performance as a pathetic lowlife loser (Jimmy Quinn) who passive/aggressively murders two men then seeks to extort money from New York City.  He's loud and obnoxious and distracts from the main feature in this movie, Q the Winged Serpent.
Someone or something is murdering unsuspecting citizens.  Bodies show up missing their skin, heart, and in some cases their heads.  Are they related?  Detective Shepard (David Carradine) seems to think so, and does the research to prove it.  Unfortunately, no one wants to accept his theory, that an Aztec cult has prayed and sacrificed the god Quetzalcoatl into being.  They'd rather think that a monster just popped up out of nowhere and started eating the citizenry of New York City.  Like that made more sense!

Love all the scenes without Moriarty's cartoon antics (so over the top he's in another dimension, a not so parallel universe where acting like a whack-a-doodle won't get you institutionalized).  Otherwise, it's a fabulous monster movie just begging for a remake.",1438732800,2,1170,5.180851063829787
216414,5,6300182800,"Q is good fun for lovers of campy monster movies.  It has all the usual cliches, like the gratuitous nude scene, the one black guy who gets killed and authorities who don't want to believe what's happening even after multiple homicides.  The movie does have several interesting differences from the standard monster movie.  Instead of an isolated setting this one takes place in a major city.  The monster drops bits of the people it's feeding on onto the streets and splatters blood onto horrified pedestrians.  The monster grows during the movie, becoming a bigger threat in every sense of the word.  Lastly, without spoiling anything, the reason why the monster has appeared when and where it has is both new and interesting.  The monster looks pretty good, like a snake blended with a typical dragon, and the stop motion animation was done well.  Settings were good, especially the monster's nest, and the characters were believable.",1438041600,,937,5.0

216449,4,6300182800,"Q THE WINGED SERPENT hearkens back to the glory years of the 1950s when Big Bug monsters prowled the earth looking for slinky females to devour.  Director Larry Cohen has churned out a surprisingly entertaining horror film that is at least as much campy humor as it is horror. The monster itself is a reincarnated Atzec flying serpent God brought back to life by a modern day Aztec priest performing ritualistic murder on victims who seem eager to have their hearts removed as a token to attract Q. How this is done is not explained as the viewer is simply asked to accept that such sacrifice does its job. It would have been easy for Director Cohen to lean too far toward camp or horror. Fortunately, he had the good sense to let Michael Moriarity set the tone as small time piano playing hoodlum attract the sympathy of the audience even as Q begins his assault on sunbathers, swimmers, and construction workers. Moriarity has always been on the short end of the stick.  Life has deliberately kept dealing him jokers when everyone else gets Aces. He has a girlfriend who supports him even as he makes it clear that he is a colossal loser in the game of life.  Moriarity is far from a flat and static character.  He changes during the film's second half and not for the better. He unexpectedly discovers Q's lair and determines to profit from the knowledge, but as he negotiates with the mayor for immunity from past crimes, one million dollars, and book and movie rights, Moriarity becomes increasingly self-centered, and hence more believable. He is no angel and realistically is seen as a small minded man who suddenly perceives that the difference between men like himself and those who wield power is no more than the luck of the sociological draw.  Other reviewers have seen this transformation as no more than the peeling away of a mind that was no more than an unwieldy assortment of self-hating and self-hurting shortcomings.  Instead Moriarity pulls off a much more difficult feat as his verbal harangues permit him to unveil the shortcomings not of himself but of those symbols of law and order that have conspired to keep him down.  What emerges from a considered viewing of Q is that Director Cohen has unwittingly used the cheesy FX of a flying serpent to exhibit the equally cheesy underside of a city that elevates the supposed virtues of the mayor, the police commissioner, and the NYPD itself even as it suggests that the moral plane that Moriarity occupies is not much different from those who see nothing wrong with equating him with the very beast that chows down on unsuspecting New Yorkers.",1428105600,,2614,4.731868131868132

Well now I'm old and my dad is SUPER old and we sat and watched the new remastered DVD version of Q.  Well luckily for my dad, he doesn't remember the movie so it was a new experience for him.  For me, I was startled by how little my memories matched the film.  It does have a slightly long, draggy beginning and the effects are very dated.  But all that and the quirkiness kind of works for this film.  Like the horrible 80's New York dialogue, seeing David Carradine, Candy Clark and Michael Moriarty in such goofy roles and the claymation Quetzalcoatl.

216493,2,6300182800,"Q's exceedingly modest pleasures are mostly delivered in its first five minutes, and most of those in the first 30 seconds. The production company's name has the red glow that was de rigueur for '70s and '80s horror flicks. The next title reads, ""Samuel Z. Arkoff presents."" What could augur better for low budget horror? You couldn't make up a better name for the producer of such films, and according to the interweb, he didn't. So far so good. Next, Michael Moriarty, someone named Candy, then - jackpot! -  David ""Kung Fu"" Carradine and Richard ""Shaft"" Roundtree.

In the opening scene a sleazy window washer, spending far too long outside the office of an attractive young woman, is decapitated by an unseen monster. In the next, a young woman ascends to a rooftop banana lounge, takes off her bikini top, applies copious tanning butter, under the gaze of a another perve with a telescope on a higher rooftop - and is then carried off by the still-unseen monster. At street level in Manhattan, pedestrians find it's raining blood. Guaranteed good times ahead, no?

No.

The film starts to haemorrhage momentum. Detective Carradine investigates a flayed corpse - OK, still cool - and another that's had its heart cut out, but ends up talking to academics and forming a theory about cultists who have revived the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl. He's not only not badass, but when told off by his police superiors for proposing such a nutty theory, he just takes it. Fellow cop Roundtree does even less. Where's the cat who won't cop out? Where's the black private dick who's a sex machine for all the chicks? They had Shaft in Africa, so if you're going to cast Roundtree, why isn't this Shaft Defeats the Flying Reptile God?

So, cheap police procedural, with occasional innocents snatched by giant rubber claw, back-projected against aerial shots of Manhattan skyline. Eventually scepticism is overcome, and the lowest-tech anti-monster squad in movie history, a bunch of New York's Finest with army surplus weapons, is assembled to climb to the monster's nest in the belfry, as it were, of the Chrysler Building. Carradine makes a speech, the chance is completely missed to have him gobbled up like Sam Jackson in Deep Blue Sea, and the stop-motion terror is defeated with small arms fire. Ho hum.

But that's not the worst part. The majority of the film is taken up with a basically unrelated sub-plot in which incompetent crook and amateur lounge pianist Jimmy Quinn (Moriarty) discovers Q's nest, dodges his colleagues who think he stole the proceeds of a jewellery robbery (he lost them in a near-miss with a taxi, cementing this film's misguidedly timid fumbling of the chance to kill the characters who need it the most), and then uses the monster's location as a bargaining chip to get the police to drop charges against him. Moriarty commits to his Method performance like Harvey Keitel at his least restrained - think Fingers or Bad Lieutenant.  Quinn is cowardly, vain, manipulative, inept, and prone to beating women. I'm sure it amounts to some sort of technical accomplishment, but whatever is it doing in a monster movie?

I've filed this alongside Buckaroo Banzai in a file marked ""deservedly lost films from the '80s"", and if I ever find the critic who wrote, ""Larry Cohen again proves himself to be amongst the most creative, original, and intelligent American horror film directors in this bizarre masterwork"", I'm going to call him a liar to his face and demand my 92 minutes back.",1402185600,,3498,4.877104377104377

216496,3,6300182800,"Larry Cohen is an enigma...he's  more businessman than artist, but today that's commonplace as opposed to shocking. I find his early sf/horror films to be near-miss classics though, despite the fact that they really are scratching and clawing their way towards quality. ""Q"" is one of those movies that I always wanted to love, but this crap is just too violent for my taste. I suppose if seeing a man cut open from the chest on down spells ""good times"" to you, then you might like this, but I actually thought that the violence spoils the story in this case. Why have all this blood when we have a winged beast to watch? I was also disappointed in this crap because it wasn't scary or intense enough. Yeah, it was violent--but not scary, even in the apartment-invasion scene toward the end where the cult member holds up Moriarty at knife-point. This was simply not working. That being said, it does have good economical sense, a good cast, and a fun set-up. But why the story wasn't better worked out and developed is a mystery. This could have been good. The actual lizard in the movie looks like a lizard face, not the demonic beast on the cover!
The DVD is good, with a commentary by Bill Lustpig and L. Cohen, but it is more of a case of Lustpig complimenting Cohen for his economic practicality than for his storytelling abilities (I agree with him for the most part, but this gets silly after a while, and since he made ""Maniac"" I think you understand what I mean).

There's quite a bit going on in the story, from the mysterious Winged Serpent attacks in NYC to the detectives chasing down the other Q (Moriarty) who's being chased down by the Tough Guys, ect. It manages to escape the trappings of most 1982 films (well, some of the trappings) and present an intriguing plot about an ancient Aztec God being evoked seemingly by ritual sacrifices elsewhere in NYC. However, our theory is this: The Winged Serpent has been evoked by the other Q, known as Quinn. He's a Crazed Jazz Pianist who's trying to catch a break, but on his own terms. We know as soon as he starts up with the Q-Bop on a busted piano that he's the real deal. His blue notes are the reason for the attacks from the serpent; as he knows that Q is alive. But Quinn's a survivalist, and when his back's up against the wall he'll do what's necessary. It's wonderful that Cohen didn't make this movie as much about the Serpent as most hacks would have, for it's also about the other Q, NYC & 1982.

216522,3,6300182800,"Q: The Winged Serpent came out around the heyday of the local video rental store. It had a very limited theater run so I think it's bread and butter revenue came from being prominently displayed in either the sci-fi and/or horror aisles of your local shop. It's a B-Movie through and through with small budget special effects, low cost cinematography and some pretty weak performances (more on that later). Still Q has enough going for it to be worth a look, especially for B-movie fans.

The fact that every week for years when I went to any of my local video rental stores Q: The Winged Serpent was staring right at me each time I went looking for my next living room entertainment made me curious. Just for that reason alone the film became something of prominence in my mind. It goes to show what proper product placement can do. Considering it's box office sales only yielded a fraction of it's production budget I am guessing they must have gotten a few curious peeps like me to at least rent the film.

As far as the film itself is concerned it's pretty bad. About as bad as you would expect for a 70's B-Movie. I guess that makes it more bad since it was made in the 80's. The story of the Q monster is pretty standard. Monster eats unsuspecting victims, who scream and leave bloody messes. There is a little effort for a back story on Q's origin (Q is short for Quetzalcoatl if that helps), but it's really just a scene's worth of plot development so no real depth there. You only get to see Q maybe a few seconds during the entire movie with just a brief full body shot. Q is of course either a puppet of a claw and such or a full bodied stop motion animated model. The stop motion would make Ray Harryhausen disown the craft, but at the same time is at least a departure in movie's dynamic when you get to see for that second or two.

Acting is a mixed bag. David Carradine was the star power, but it looked like he was phoning his performance in. He was just as disappointing as much of the cast with dry and uninspiring performances. The one major, MAJOR standout in the film was Michael Moriarty. He already had a reputation as an intense method actor by that time and he is the one and only reason Q is more than just a mere footnote in the annals of the genre. Moriarty plays Quinn, who is essentially a low level criminal with aspirations of making an honest living. Quinn is flawed. He's selfish, angry and just a little guy in the grand scheme of things. From this Quinn character comes a side story that you will find imminently more interesting than Q's occasional killing spree. You start to get wrapped up in his life and you will want to root for him or yell at him depending on the choices he makes. Not many B-movies can pull that off.

Shout Factory released this Blu-Ray and they have a reputation of really giving the material its best face forward. The video quality is poor by Blu-Ray standards, but if you ever seen this movie on DVD (or God help you... VHS) you will definitely notice a major improvement in quality. Colors are sharp and details pop out, even to the dismay of the special effects being much more noticeable. Mind you there is still lots of grain and those details that pop out are not as good compared to the previous release standards. Sounds is in DTS 2 channel stereo, which is interesting since I never even knew the movie was sourced in stereo (all previous releases were in mono). As far as sound is concerned the old adage, ""garbage in garbage out"" comes to mind. It's far from perfect, but I am guessing this is a symptom of the source being bad from the get go. As far as extras are concerned you only get two cheesy trailers and a commentary by Writer/Director Larry Cohen. I haven't heard the commentary but I heard it's a bit entertaining, if not too informative.

Personally I would be hard pressed to purchase this movie. In spite of Moriarty's contributions it's still a weak film. As a rental? Personally I still call it required viewing for sci-fi fans, but only because of my past exposure to the VHS box tempting me for years. If that's enough for you then check it out.

As I've said before, I'm a sucker for a monster movie, especially a giant monster movie! ""Q: TheWinged Serpent,"" is such a giant monster movie, & a classic too!

A Mexican Aztec winged serpent god is brought to life through ritual killings by an Aztec high priest, but the death count rises as people in New York City start getting decapitated, & are swept up in thin air. No one knows why, except Michael Moriarty, a small time con man who has seen the serpents nest & extorts NYC for $1,000,000 for it's hiding place, at the top of one of NYC's tallest buildings. A nod to ""King Kong.""

Moriarty plays his part with the same offbeat manner he is famous for, & is quite enjoyable as the bumbling would be millionaire bum. David Carradine plays a good off beat role as a none traditional cop detective, who is going to outwit Moriarty in divulging the location of the serpent.

What follows is a great little cat & mouse game between Moriarty & Carradine. Great flying sequences as the winged serpent attacks & kills it victims off of skyscrapers. The stop motion effects are superior for 1982, as the winged Serpent looks great! A foreboding reptilian bird like giant, that makes its victims know how it feels to be a worm plucked out of the ground by that pesky Robin, after a rainstorm in the morning.

All this & more, make ""Q: The Winged Serpent,"" a very enjoyable monster romp, for us giant monster fans!

The cast are excellent. Carradine is cool, Richard Roundtree is believeable and best of all Michael Moriarty is nuts!

In that film he was a dignified decent man, here he is an odious small time time crook who accidently discovers the beast of the title.

Larry Cohen the director and writer makes full use of New Yorks dramatic buildings with some great ariel photography. Q itself now looks completely unrealistic as the special effects available for a low budget movie in 1982 were very limited. It really doesn't matter though.

My only criticism is the quality of transfer on the DVD. Its not bad, but its not great either. Probably its the best available but I suspect they could have done better with a digital remaster.

For a 1982 film, the gore in Q, the Winged Serpent, probably shocked quite a few people. There is also a [...] scene that is quite enticing. But aside from these two points of note, the film offered little else, including entertainment.

The acting was passable, but of course with such a dull story and script to flesh out, the OK acting goes to waste.

Save your money. This is one of the worst movies ever made. There are far better B movies. It is the type of movie I would have liked in college in 1987, if I had been drunk and looking for laughs.

216607,4,6300182800,"I think I'll keep this one short.  First of all, 'Q' features a stop-motion animated flying serpent-dragon-thing terrorizing New York plus Michael Moriarty and David Carradine in the lead roles.  That alone should be sufficient to make you want to see this as far as I'm concerned.  As is typical of the Cohen films I've seen, 'Q' is particularly interested in character, moreso than in the supernatural elements.  It's almost a character study looking at Moriarty's Quinn, a fearful, paranoid small-time criminal who discovers the location of the murderous, resurrected Quetzacoatyl and his/her (?) nest and sees in this an opportunity to ransom the city.  Moriarty's jittery, method performance is quite amusing, and provides an interesting counterpoint to his most famous role as Stone in the early seasons of 'Law & Order'.  Hopefully you will find it amusing as well, as this makes up the bulk of the film.  Carradine plays the cop leading the investigation of the serpent murders, as well as some ritual homicides that are, naturally, connected.  His role is less important and less flashy, but I still like him a lot.  His ability to keep a straight face through out the proceedings is admirable.

Admittedly, this is fairly implausible even as such things go, as it seems pretty unlikely that a giant winged serpent could successfully hideout in New York.  But seriously, so what?  This is a monster movie, take it or leave it.  The beast itself is not of particularly high quality, even for something that is primarily stop-motion animated, but I for one and absolutely in love with the style, so it works for me.  The various killing scenes are quite well done, particularly the opening one involving the murder of a window cleaner. Also, the film has got a decent bit of gore in it.  Not a ton, but some, anyway.  The final confrontation is totally priceless and the serpent swoops about and flings various people to their deaths.  The beast probably didn't have quite enough screentime up to this point, but they definitely make up for it at the end.

I have very fond memories of seeing this as a teen, and rented it for the purpose of giving it another look though older eyes. Unfortunately, to say Q hasn't aged well is being quite kind.

Quetzalcoatl, the title character, is a very large bird/serpent who's flying around New York eating people who find themselves in high places. At least, he might be Quetzalcoatl (an Aztec god). Or he might just be a big mutant. No one knows. More to the point, no one seems to be overly surprised that there is a large flying serpent picking off New Yorkers. The cops assigned to the case, Shepard (David Carradine) and Powell (Richard Roundtree), certainly take things in stride. The Commissioner (Malachy McCourt, Frank's brother) is the only one who expresses any sort of normal reaction to the events-- disbelief.

While the big bird and the cops are the meat of the story, its actual core is Jimmy Quinn (a young Michael Moriarty), a small-time crook who's run afoul of some tough characters through no real fault of his own. Jimmy's odd relationship with the monster could have turned this into a wonderful psychological thriller, and there are glimmers of that sort of thing, but the script never follows through. Q has more the feel of a quickie monster flick-- none of the storylines is explored much beyond the surface, the special effects are alarmingly (and hysterically) low-budget, and the characters, were they to stand still, could often substitute for props.

But, hey, it's got a big flying lizard. That's something. **",1132704000,,1550,4.837735849056604

You know, it's so bad it's good kind of thing. Also, Q himself only gets about 2 minutes of screen time max, and even then he's no Godzilla.

The special effects are used extremely sparingly, with the word ""special"" being a definite overstatement.  Some amusing performances somewhat redeem the proceedings, but not by much.  In the end, ""Q, The Winged Serpent"" is watchable and certainly not horribly bad, but it's hard to imagine this being anybody's favorite horror movie or even guilty pleasure.

216611,3,6300182800,"""Q: The Winged Serpent"" is a campy flick about a giant creature (Q) that takes up residence in the bowers of the Chrysler Building.  Feeding on unsuspecting New Yorkers, Q spreads hysteria over the city, particularly when bloody body parts began raining onto the streets.  David Carradine is the detective on the case, who becomes convinced that Q has something to do with a mythical god and ritual sacrifices.  Throw in Michael Moriarty as a twitchy diamond thief, and you have all the makings for a camp classic.  The movie ultimately falls a bit short of greatness though.

Larry Cohen, who is somewhat of a legendary b-movie auteur, wrote and directed this rather indescribable movie.  The dialogue and story are trashy entertainment, and the plots zips along nicely.  Unfortunately, the acting is abysmal, with only Moriarty's loony performance remotely believable.  Candy Clark, an Oscar nominee for 1973's ""American Graffiti,"" is particularly amateurish.  In addition, the special effects are sometimes laughable; wisely, Cohen decided to show little of the creature until toward the end.  Despite its shortcomings, the movie ends up being pretty enjoyable claptrap -- well worth a look for fans of camp movies.

The DVD extras consist primarily of a fun commentary featuring Larry Cohen, along with some uninteresting stills galleries.",1113609600,,1343,5.287735849056604

This is an enjoyable and  quirky little movie with a wonderfully deadpan performance from Carradine and a superbly judged one from the under-rated Moriarty adding spice to the proceedings .The humour and pace are what lifts this several notches above the routine monster movie -and truthfully the monster effects are adequate but nothing spectacular

216613,4,6300182800,"After being fired from directing I, The Jury, Larry Cohen bounced back with his independant low budget monster movie, Q.  Cohen also had a bit of revenge on his former employers coz Q did much better at the box office than I, The Jury.  Cohen's film is a wonderful homage to the giant monster films of the 50s and 60s.  Basically it's a giant lizard/bird flying around New York eating whoever it can.  There's also some wacky priest-type guy making human sacrifices to the thing.  Whether this bird magically appeared because of the sacrifices, or if it's just an ancient creature, mistaken for a god, that has happened to come out of hiding is up to you to guess.  Both scenarios are hinted at.  David Carradine and Richard Roundtree take on the bird and sacrifice cases while thief Michael Moriarty bungles a robbery and finds out where the bird lives.  Eventually these characters join forces.  This is a B movie naturally, but Cohen has always had a talent for making very good B films-B+ films if you like.  He's always able to make the most of his budget.  The bird is a fake looking stop motion creation, but it doesn't matter coz Cohen is so good with the characterization and plot that it makes no difference if we ever see the creature at all!  Can you say that about a billion dollar Roland Emmerich cgi monster crapfest?  No way, Jose!!!  Q is an extremely fun film.  You know it has to be if my wife enjoyed it.  Good performances all around as well(Cohen says in the commentary he considered no-names Bruce Willis and Eddie Murphy for the leads!!), especially David Carradine, who's actually quite good as the cop.  He has one of the funniest lines as the police fire upon the monster from the top of a skyscraper.  He looks at his partner and says with a smile, ""Big!""

216614,3,6300182800,"You really gotta hand it to Larry Cohen. He's the chap responsible for some of the more ludicrous horror and exploitation films made in the last thirty or so years, in case you were wondering. You probably heard about a little film called ""The Stuff"" where a greedy corporation markets a mysterious organic substance as the latest low fat sensation only to discover later that the tasty snack turns people into gelatinous mounds of goo. What, you never heard about it? O.k., then you at least know a thing or two about ""God Told Me To,"" a strange movie that takes as its starting point a string of grisly murders but ends up morphing into your run of the mill alien abduction/return of the Son of God picture. No way! You aren't familiar with this film either? Don't tell me you've spent most of your life working, taking care of your kids, or other such meaningless activities? You're starting to make me angry. Do you mean to tell me you never heard about any of these classic schlock films? Pathetic. I'm sending you to the corner with a copy of ""Q: The Winged Serpent.""

Released in 1982 and looking like it, Cohen's homage to 1950's cheesy monster movies boasts a high cheese quotient of its own. How else to sum up a film that throws out the line ""You ever drop a cantaloupe from forty stories?"" within the first five minutes to describe a body hitting the ground? And from the mouth of veteran schlock actor David Carradine, no less? The reason that body, which was once a window washer, fell to the ground centers on the reincarnated Aztec deity Quetzlcoatl. Quick history lesson here: good old Quetzlcoatl was a half reptile/half bird god that the ancient Aztecs made particularly gory sacrifices to a few years before Cortez arrived on the scene. The priests of this god would tie down an unfortunate victim and pluck their still beating heart from the bodies as an offering. Neat, huh? Well, anything goes in 1970's New York City, and that means some nut has been offering up fresh sacrifices. The result is the emergence of a really cheesy claymation type bird that builds a nest in the Chrysler building when it isn't out soaring around town plucking off people's heads. The cops are in a dither about the sudden appearance of a score of headless corpses, especially Shepard (Carradine) and partner Powell (Richard Roundtree). That's ""Q: The Winged Serpent"" in a nutshell.

I almost forgot: a low rent crook named Jimmy Quinn (Michael Moriarty) becomes involved after a robbery goes awry. A bunch of mafia types hired him to drive the getaway car, but then insisted he go inside to help with the stickup. Predictably, the job turns sour and Quinn runs away. Knowing he's in trouble with the cops and with the underworld types, Jimmy hides the loot in the uppermost reaches of the Chrysler building. Sure, he notices the nest and a giant egg up there, along with a picked clean human skeleton, but he's too scared to do much about it. In the meantime, Jimmy's relationship with screechy girlfriend Joan (Candy Clark) turns sour after she learns he hasn't gone legit. When his former partners come looking for him, Quinn knows the gig is up. He heads over to the cop shop to strike a deal, namely that he will tell the police the location of this monstrous bird in exchange for money and a clean slate. This explosive revelation greatly enhances Shepard's status in the department since he's been one of the few guys listening to eyewitness claims about a killer lizard bird. He even went so far as to ask a local scholar about the Aztec connection, which resulted in a less than enthusiastic response from his superiors. If the preceding summary sounds ridiculous, wait until you see the conclusion.

Forget about the hokey special effects. Forget about the effective job David Carradine does in the role of Shepard. I want you to remember one thing about ""Q: The Winged Serpent"": Michael Moriarty. First, I find Michael Moriarty to be one of the most grating hacks currently working in show business. I cannot think of a role I have seen him in where I appreciated what he did for even a second, and for the most part I formed this opinion as a result of seeing this film in the early 1980s. Cohen seems to like Moriarty considering he cast him in at least three of his films (""The Stuff,"" ""Q,"" and ""It's Alive""). The character of Jimmy Quinn is so unlikable, so offensive to every one of my five senses, that I could hardly bear to watch this film again in order to write a review. I got the feeling that Moriarty's character is supposed to be one of those down on his luck criminal types that we should all sympathize with because deep down inside he's trying to better himself. Horse hockey. His spastic movements, sweaty visage, and smarmy demeanor sent my blood pressure through the roof in the early 1980s, and it did so again in 2004. I don't remember enough of ""It's Alive"" to analyze his performance there, but he's just as grating--if not more so--in ""The Stuff.""

Extras on the disc include a trailer, a Cohen commentary, and stills. The DVD unfortunately does not contain an explanation of why some guy went around sacrificing people to bring back an ancient Aztec deity, but that's o.k. since the movie doesn't either. Horror fans will want to watch the film, and I can't say I blame them even though I don't recommend anyone willingly exposing themselves to Moriarty's histrionics. Just know going in what to expect and you might still come away entertained. Maybe.",1098316800,2,5492,4.6646026831785345
216615,4,6300182800,"No matter how preposterous or cliche a film's bare premise may sound, if Larry Cohen's name is attached to it, you can be certain that it's an interesting and entertaining piece of cinema. Cohen's scripts and films are always filled with lots of wild imagery (both literal and figurative), often complex themes, and lots of sophisticated satirical subtext. And his 1982 opus Q: THE WINGED SERPENT is no exception, despite whatever the goofy-sounding title may seem to imply. As usual, writer/director Cohen's tongue-in-cheek film sidesteps the usual horror cliches and instead delivers a fairly tight story, interesting characters, clever dialog, and a ton of subtle yet witty social metaphor. And yes, there is also a little nudity and gore.

 The titular Q is Quetzalcoatl, a flying serpentine god of the ancient Aztecs who has been summoned to modern-day Manhattan via bizarre sacrificial rituals performed by a contemporary Aztec priest. Since its arrival in The Big Apple borough, the humongous beastie has been swooping down on unsuspecting pedestrians, swimmers, and sunbathers and chowing down, but police are initially skeptical of the eye-witness reports of a giant flying reptile but are at a loss for any other explanation. Enter street thug and opportunist Jimmy Quinn (Michael Moriarty). Having inadvertently stumbled across Q's nest, Quinn's willing to give that information to the cops--for a price.

 The special FX in Q: THE WINGED SERPENT, especially the stop-motion animation of the serpent itself, are admittedly cheesy. But the FX aren't really the point as far as Cohen is concerned; they're just window dressing. Instead, with his usual satiric flair, Cohen uses the film to take some playful pokes at the modern Western lifestyle. For example, Q: THE WINGED SERPENT draws several sardonic parallels between ancient pagan religions and modern Christianity. Notes one cop after learning the details of the Aztec sacrificial ritual: ""The victim's heart is ritually removed and presented to the god. Luckily, all WE have to do today is eat the wafer and drink the wine--that?s being civilized."" And in several shots of the Chrysler Building, Cohen makes deliberate visual comparisons of the modern architecture to that of ancient Aztec temples.

 The acting in the film is pretty good overall, and Cohen manages to coax an especially outstanding performance from actor Michael Moriarty. In a role that is the opposite of the conservative types that he usually plays, Moriarty is hilarious yet believable and sympathetic as the dim-witted, hapless hood who hopes to sell his knowledge of Q's whereabouts to city authorities for a cool $1,000,000. David Carradine (of KUNG FU fame) does a pretty good turn as the city detective in charge of the Q case, and Richard Roundtree--cinema & TV's original SHAFT--is delightful as Carradine's partner. Cute Candy Clark, nominated for an Oscar for her performance in 1973's AMERICAN GRAFFITI, also does a great job in a minor role as Moriarty's live-in girlfriend.

 Blue Underground's DVD release of Q: THE WINGED SERPENT is a must-have for Cohen fans. It offers a nearly pristine digital transfer of the film in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (16x9 enhanced), with audio options that include the original mono, an excellent stereo remix, a Dolby 5.1 track, and a DTS 6.1 track. Bonus features include an informative and entertaining running commentary with Cohen and his protege Bill Lustig, as well as a teaser trailer, a photo gallery, and some DVD-ROM-only goodies.

 In short, Q: THE WINGED SERPENT may not be Cohen's best flick, but it's a pretty good one that won't disappoint fans of the writer/director or fans of B-movie horror. And Blue Underground's DVD is well worth the price of admission.",1090368000,18,3769,5.194398682042833

This movie is original, having a flying dragon that is summoned by ritual killings, that eats people like birds eat worms.  This movie is a hybrid of Godzilla and slasher flicks.

216638,4,6300182800,"Q is a fun, low budget thriller from B-movie auteur Larry Cohen.  The premise is that an ancient Mexican God Quetzalcoatl has taken the form of a giant flying serpent and is living somewhere in New York, feasting on unsuspecting residents.  Sunbathers, window washers, high-rise construction workers are all fair game for this gigantic beast.
Michael Moriarity stars as Jimmy Quinn, an out of work piano man/small time criminal.  It's so weird seeing him in a role like this, as I am used to seeing him on the TV show Law & Order as an ADA.  In this movie, his character stumbles on the secret location of the beast's nest, and he tries to use that information to get money and the respect he thinks he deserves.  While a criminal, I did feel a certain amount of sympathy for this character in the beginning, which evaporated rather slowly as the intoxication of power sets in, along with its' illusions.  In the beginning, he was just some poor schlub who couldn't catch a break, but later on his true nature appeared.  I read a quote once, I am not sure by who, that said something like 'to really see what's in a man's heart, give him some power'.
David Carradine plays a detective who's trying to solve a series of gruesome murders, and his investigation leads him into uncharted territories of the unknown.  The deeper he gets, the more he butts heads with his supervisors, who would rather see things cleared up neatly and without any superstitious mumbo jumbo.  Also look for Richard Roundtree, as Sergeant Powell, a cop wound a little too tight whose beliefs are based on what he can see and touch.
The actual creature does not get much screen time, but its' presence is noticeable throughout the movie.  I really enjoyed the storyline with Quinn, his tenuous relationship with his girlfriend (Candy Clark), and the manner in which he tries to use the vital information.  Here's a small time schnook, never had a break in his life, literally trips over something, sees nothing but the value to himself, and tries to get everything but ends up with nothing.
Here is another fine example of a filmmaker making a lot out of very little.  The horror aspects of the movie are present, and the special effects are used sparingly, but the characters drive the story.  Another example of this is the original Jaws movie.  I suppose the special effects were kept to a minimum due to budgetary limitations, but it helped, rather than hindered, the movie.  This movie also has a raw, gritty feel to it, in the sets, use of locations, dialogue, giving us an almost documentarian feel.
The movie is presented in a wide screen format, with good audio.  A number of special features include commentary by the filmmaker, biographies, trailers, and promotional materials.  All in all, not a bad way to spend 93 minutes.",1064793600,33,2810,4.713701431492843
216639,4,6300182800,"One does not usually expect to find quality acting in a movie like this, but I was quite surprised.
David Carradine plays a policeman on the trail of two cases that seem linked.  The first involves a window washer who suddenly loses his head.  Later there are more rooftop disappearances, seemingly perpetrated by a giant bird.  The second case involved a series of ritualistic murders.  They seem to be the work of a fanatic following Aztec rituals to bring back the god Quetzalcoatl.
Carradine's portrayal is excellent but he cannot hold a candle to Michael Moriarty who plays a down-on-his-luck loser.  He wants to be a jazz pianist but is still unemployed.  He is also a timid small-time crook.  He is a driver (""I don't go inside and I don't carry a piece!"").  But a job goes wrong and he finds himself on the run.
Moriarty hides in the Chrysler building and discovers that the run-down art-deco spire is the home of the giant bird.  There is even an egg in the nest.  A body hidden there gets him thinking.  The city is in fear of the bird and he knows where it is.  He is convinced he is now the most important man in the city.
Now that he thinks he has power, he holds the safety of the city for ransom.  He wants money and a ""Nixon-like"" pardon.  But his arrogant cockiness loses him his girl (she had felt sorry for him but now could see how mean he really is).
The city acquiesces to Moriarty's demands and go after the monster.  Because the bird is not in the nest when they arrive, the city is able to pull out of the deal.
In the end, Carradine manages to take care of the bird and track down the ritual killer.  Moriarty is back where he started minus one girlfriend (although Carradine tries to convince him to go back to her).
Good tight acting with Moriarty giving an amazing performance.  The stop-motion effects on the creature are a little crude at times but not really bad considering the time period and the budget.
Definitely a fun film to watch with a minimum of gore (although there is a scene where street crowds are splattered by blood from the skies).  Find it and watch it.",1058227200,2,2103,4.418181818181818
216640,4,6300182800,"By the end of the 1950s, the Big Monster genre had died out.  Instead, Hollywood switched to slasher flicks and one on one mutant creatures.  It took some creative courage for director Larry Cohen to attempt to revive it with his surprisingly effective tale of a reincarnated Aztec flying serpent.  In Q, Michael Moriarity proves his resiliency that would later come in handy in IT'S ALIVE in his role as Jimmy Quinn, a jazz-playing small-time hood who steals diamonds when not busy pounding piano keys.  By luck, he stumbles on the brood nest of a huge flying serpent that is somehow connected to a series of ritualistic killings in which a modern Aztec shaman deskins his willing victims.  This is the weak part of the film since it is not clear how the killings by the shaman relate to the killings by the serpent.  The police, led by David Carradine and Richard Roundtree, at first disbelieve, then later actively seek the creature in a climactic battle atop the Chrysler Building.
Q harkens back to the glory years when both Hollywood and Tokyo regularly released films that featured the squashing flat of cities populated by panic-stricken residents who seem unable to dodge mountains of building rubble falling on their heads.  What Director Cohen has done is to create a believable monster that JAWS-like, permits the audience to see the victims from the creature's own perspective.  Further, the creepy over the top acting of Moriarity is perfect as the hood who has suffered from a life-long lack of respect, and in his opportunity to get the credit for bagging Q, now is sure that his ship has come in.  He grins, rolls in eyes, bewails his fate, but beneath his antics, one can clearly see the hurt that has accumulated over the years.  When a detective asks him if he feels any pity for a victim who might have been saved had Quinn acted sooner to reveal Q's whereabouts, he replies, 'I have pity for the next victim and the one after that.'  Such honesty is refreshing in both movies and life itself.  This honesty, coupled with the fun and zest of the cast and crew, is what makes Q a special treat to savor when a later generation of Jasons and Freddies bore, rather than scare, audiences to death.",1041206400,2,2214,4.677835051546392

The basic plot has a rash of ritualistic murders linked to disappearances from rooftops in mid-town Manhattan (starting with the beheading of an Empire State Building window washer) leading to the discovery of a monster sized winged serpent.  Jimmy Quinn, a struggling former junkie/hood played beautifully by Michael Moriarty (Law & Order), stumbles across the creature's nest in the Chrysler Building (NOT the Empire State Building as some think).  After putting the creature to good use, Jimmy attempts to make a deal.  Police Officers David Carradine and Richard Roundtree are not amused.

In a likeable performance, David Carradine as a police detective, diligently researches the creature and then tracks it down---his efforts climax in a hilarious ""finale"" in which Carradine and his cohorts attempt to machine-gun the monster as it collides into buildings.

Q - The Winged Serpent, a movie I hadn't seen in ages, was no exception to that rule. Recently liberating this David Carradine classic from the DVD graveyard, I found myself once again impressed by its estranged storyline that depicted, among other things, Manhattan being plagued by the infamous feathered serpent God. Yes, Quetzalcoatl - the winged typo, looking very much like a crude depiction of a feathered dragon and nothing like he did in his Aztec prime, was out in force, snatching off window washer's heads and naked sunbathers as well as dredging through the nastiness of communal pools to find a tasty treat. He had been called into action after years of dormancy by human sacrifice, not smog banks as we might have haphazardly guessed, and the key to finding out where the beast is and who called it here is none other than a smalltime thief who, after stumbling across Q's nest, is looking to strike it rich.
Apparently human sacrifice and wearing around human flesh does weird things, so beware wary of people you see wearing anyone unfamiliar and, most certainly, don't sunbathe nude without plenty of photographic protection to alert you and your impressed neighbors of any winged god's presence.

7804079,2,6300182800,"For the first half-hour, Q: The Winged Serpent keeps viewers in a state of limbo wondering whether the same, better, or worse is yet to come. The featured monster, or winged serpent, is clearly supposed to be tacky and ill-contrived, a parody of both low-budget and primitive monster horror movies of the 50's and 60's. Q's (Quetzalcoatl's) first and second attack sequences are silly and awkward, as are the ones that follow, but not goofy enough to provide a good laugh. By the third attack, Q has already worn out her welcome, making viewers feel impatient and anxious to get to the next order of drama. Unfortunately, Q isn't serious enough to be a crime drama, nor is it comedic enough to be a horror pastiche, so it winds up being a conflicted mess that starts deteriorating before the second half. If you're watching Q just for the sake of being a fan of director Larry Cohen, then it's probably safe to say that you won't be disappointed. However, if you're a fan of David Carradine, Candy Clark, or Richard Roundtree (the most convincing of the three), their uneven and sometimes slack performances aren't enough to make anyone want to stick it through. Unbelievably, the worst element of this movie happens to be the leading actor, Michael Moriarty, who isn't just unconvincing, he's dull to the point of being sickening: what comes to mind is a kind of poor man's John Savage or Jon Voigt. A more creative and clever director with a wackier sense of humor might have tuned up the deadpan and tossed in Gene Wilder to get this picture percolating. Another alternative would have been to scrap Q as it was, pick up some of the salvageable pieces and make Shaft vs. Kwai Chang Caine Meets Rodan's Daughter. Ridiculous, maybe, but probably more entertaining for the ""so bad, it's good"" crowd.",1517356800,,1799,4.732484076433121
7804080,5,6300182800,"As much as I like David Carradine, I'm conviced Richard Roundtree was/is a much better actor (suave as an afternoon thunderstorm, too); and besides all that, the real draw here was/is Michael Moriarty, who should've won a Maltese Falcon award for his nuanced yet over-the-top performance as a jazz-musician junkie who Candy Clark happens to be in love with.

You pretty much get the plot from the synopsis, and I'm not going to spoil anything else, but I will say this is as much of a character-study as it is a ""monster-movie"", and I've yet to see a film that Larry Cohen was involved in that wasn't worth the time invested in entertainment pay-off value.
