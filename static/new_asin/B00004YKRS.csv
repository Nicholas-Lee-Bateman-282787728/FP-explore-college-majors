8187087,5,B00004YKRS,"I finally watched these three movies for my first time just recently and was dismayed at the picture and sound quality of the DVDs I had. I purchased this box set of the three and watched them again.  The improvements I saw and heard in this set  were amazing!  The images had better contrast and the background machine- like noise I heard before was gone, even when listening with headphones. Nice upgrade to my library.",1520812800,,421,4.586666666666667
8187088,5,B00004YKRS,"This is one of the best movies ever made. Do NOT get the later versions.  The original Hitchcock film is great.  It has Hitchcock's famous premise - the innocent man being chased by police and criminals alike.  Robert Donat and Madeline Carroll are terrific together, and the political rally scene is one for the ages.",1056153600,9,318,4.745454545454545
8187089,5,B00004YKRS,"How can anyone say that the original 39 steps movie is not the best?  If nothing else it was directed by the great man himself.  I have seen 2 re-makes of this film, both poor relations of the first in my opinion.  This film is a must see, and surely must be credited as being one of the films that started a revolution in suspence films.  Buy this version you will not be disappointed",982713600,7,385,4.162162162162162
8187090,1,B00004YKRS,"This take of the original novel is fairly decent, however there is much better version available.  In 1979 a Brittish film company produced a color version of the original story, which I think is outstanding.  Though extremely hard to find, spend the extra time to locate the '79 Brittish version of the 39 Steps.  It is much more accurate and suspenseful, compared to the Hitchcock versions.  Quite frankly, don't waste your time watching Hitchcock's movie.",978393600,3,458,5.066666666666666
