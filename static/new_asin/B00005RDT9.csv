1654476,2,B00005RDT9,"I got this video for our son who is 19 months and has not talked yet. He did not like the video and I thought it would be more then just them showing a picture of a train and the word and saying it once, and then showing a few different trains and then moving on to a new word. Our son loves the baby Einstein videos and we also got him the video called baby babble, which I found to be better, so you may want to check out that video.",1121299200,3,435,3.739130434782609
1654477,5,B00005RDT9,"My son loves these dvd's.  I was suprised to see that some thought so badly of it.  We have some of the baby einstein's and my son likes them as well, but with the baby bumblebee series he repeats everything that is said.  It has really taught him so much.  The einstein series he seemed to just laugh at and not so much learn from.  Im sure he did learn, however with the bumblebee series, he sits with his crayons and colors and watches the dvd and repeats what is being said.  Background info is my child is not considered speech delayed (tested) but a bit of a slow talker (2 1/2).  These dvd's have helped a lot.  Since some reviews have been not so good, I would suggest trying to rent these somewhere (if possible) since the price is kind of high.",1107388800,33,754,4.223776223776224
1654478,5,B00005RDT9,We tried so many things trying to help our speech delayed child. Nothing helped until we found this video/dvd!! Now our child can say the words taught on the video and KNOWS what the words mean!!,1106092800,12,195,4.444444444444445
1654479,4,B00005RDT9,"Just bought for my 18 month son...The dvd is not great but not horrible either, my son seems to loose his interest (compared to Sesame Street...Who wouldn't? Ha!), but keeps his interest with the baby einstein ones(we have all of them)they use alot of puppets were this cd uses Real life objects with  an occasional puppet reinacting the words. This dvd is clear and repetative which I like...Example: Jump (shows children,animals jumping)Eat (shows babys eatting etc.) then it goes back and recaps all the diffrent action words. He laughs when they get to the word ""tickle"". They repeat alot of the words which other tapes do not (Einstein,So smart) which in my opion is good to reinforce.

My son needs the repetition, My son also has a slight language delay so that is why I bought this tape. The einstein tapes he has been watching since he was about a month old and they did not help my sons language even with me interacting with the videos, although he enjoyed them, I used to rave about the Einstein videos to every mother,bought them for my friends kids and then I found these other dvd's. I would highly recommend taking a look at the ""Baby Babble"" cd by talking child. That is a excellent tape done by 2 speech pathologists. That video he likes and it keeps his attention.

To sum this up....I would say this ranks 2nd compairing to all other language tapes that are on the market, Baby babble being ranked #1.",1103328000,48,1421,4.608695652173913
1654480,1,B00005RDT9,"I am a teacher that has taught for twelve years both in preschool and grade school. I bought this dvd for my son who is 17 months. He was born premature and is considered speech delayed and I was thinking that this dvd might help. I was very disappointed. This dvd is nothing other than moving flash cards. The screen shows several items and repeats the item's names over and over. I understand the concept, but it failed to keep my son's attention even when I sat and watched it with him trying to redirect him toward the t.v. The second and third time viewing he wouldn't watch it at all. This dvd is going up for sale on e-bay!

Save your money and just use real objects in your house in which your child shows interest. Point to those objects, play with them, and name them. This will be a much more meaningful experience for your child. If you are looking for entertaining dvds that hold a young child's attention try the Baby Einstein series or the Sesame Street sing-along dvds.",1103155200,61,985,4.412087912087912
1654481,1,B00005RDT9,"My 20 month old son is speech delayed and I bought this DVD based on all the positive reviews I've seen.  Maybe I'm missing something, but I thought it was horrible.  First of all, it barely held my son's attention.  But the worst part was that I absolutely cannot stand the music!  I could barely make it through watching it even the first time.  Same thing with volume 2.

We bought the Baby Babble DVD about 6 weeks ago, and I think it is much better than these Bumblebee DVD's.  My son can watch Baby Babble over and over and over again.",1090627200,65,541,4.245098039215686
1654482,3,B00005RDT9,"I purchased this video for my 2 1/2 year old son who's primary communication is ASL.  Because he is still young and still learning sign language I thought these dvds would be great to add to his collection.  Boy, were we disappointed.  Maybe if you do not already know ASL the dvds are fine BUT there are MULTIPLE signs that are wrong and in no way ASL.  We turned the option off because it was confusing my son. Besides that if that is not an issue for you they are great dvds.  If you are looking to teach your child sign I HIGHLY recommended ""Signing Times"", excellent dvds!!!",1089936000,8,579,4.324074074074074
1654483,3,B00005RDT9,"Admittedly, this video is in the upper tier of the Baby Einstein knockoffs.  But there is a huge gap between the best of these imitations and the real deal (see my review of Baby Van Gogh). The videography in this one is better than most of the second-stringers, but the sound is primitive.  More importantly, it interests our son only episodically, although more so than some of the worst (see Zen Baby, for example, Zen as in z-z-z-z-z).  My own view is that the concept supposedly underlying this video gets parental fans hyper-ventilating (""I know, let's inject him with lots of Mozart and repetition of simple words and he'll be a freaking genius!"").  But our son hears plenty of Mozart and simple words the natural way.  Get this video if nobody around your house has time to actually tell your child what a ""ball"" or ""cat"" is and you never play the music of Mozart.  You can get it all in one package right here.  Relatively speaking, though, this is helium compared to the Einstein series's U235.",1076457600,4,1004,4.638418079096045

My son has watched the leap frog series twice. I believe this one has a robot with an English accent. It is a little scary and they flat out leave the room.

I thought I'd check this because they had a the first DVD as a starter. We've been watching Baby Einstein Sign Language and my son loves it. I really need to put it on more often. This disc is nice but not as playful as BE. It doesn't hold his attention. I also don't like how they separate the signs from the rest of the visuals. That's what BE does well. They have the sign (with a child doing it quite often) and the word and visual all together. I'll send this one back and try T to T.,1327795200,,746,4.047297297297297

She has been in speech therapy for 5 weeks now.  In the past three weeks, she has gone from saying all of 2 or 3 words to saying or trying to say every word on these DVDs.  She and her 15-month-old brother love them.  Keep in mind that these videos are not going to work for every child.  People who are complaining about their simplicity, the music or the poor video quality obviously are not dealing with speech delay issues.  The videos have a purpose and that purpose is not to impress parents.  They are serving their purpose well for us.  All I have to say is ""Baby Bumblebee"" and my little ones run for the TV.

Note:  I am not saying that these videos are going to ""cure"" speech delay on their own.  I think our success is coming from a combination of intense speech therapy, parent and family intervention and the DVDs working together.",1287792000,4,1020,4.361702127659575

Sure, there were a few pictures he liked and he took a glimps of the DVD presentation every now and then but for the most part, it didn't hold his attention long enough. I waisted $26 on something I thought could be educational and inspiring to my son who's considered speech delayed.

What's worst, this DVD is nothing more but a flash card presentation! Why not name it that way???

1654512,5,B00005RDT9,"I purchased the Bee Smart Vocabulary Builder 1 for my granddaughter when she was 9 months old. We watched the video together and she was so focused that it surprised me. It must have been 20 viewings before her attention started to wander but I was ready with the next one, #2. The process was repeated...we watched it many times until she started to lose interest. Then we started on volume #3...same process. I noticed that her speech and her vocabulary built with surprising speed and words that would have thought she would not learn until much later became part of her sentences. Most amazing was the early grasp of concepts. At 2 years old, she leapt from words to understanding their concepts so fast it was startling.

I think the key was that I patiently watched the videos with her and encouraged her interest for months, interacting with her and what she was learning. A wonderful tool for parents or grandparents who are actively fostering their child's early learning.

1654523,5,B00005RDT9,"My 26 month old daughter was on the verge of being diagnosed with a speech delay, and I really didn't to deal with a speech therapist and all that.  So, I was desperate, trying everything I could think of to get her talking.  I bought Baby Babble (which I think is at a lower level than where she was), discovered online books, did everything I could think of.

My daughter is a very energetic little girl, doesn't like to sit still for any amount of time EXCEPT for the television or the computer.  So, I knew that my solution would probably have to include the computer or the TV.  I discovered online books, and was reading her books in a format where she couldn't tear them up, but the computer couldn't hold her attention long enough to finish a story.  (Some two year olds have the attention span of a gnat, and my girl is one of them!)

When I was considering Baby Bumblebee, I read enough about the format to know that it's kind of like moving flashcards.  So, I went to the BB website, downloaded their flashcards and used them for a week with my girl.  And it seemed to be working.  So, I went ahead and bought VB1.  By the end of the first week, my husband and I were discussing moving her on to video 2; she's pretty much mastered video 1.

The thing I like about this that you can't get with flashcards is that it's a video.  It moves and it gives you several examples of the word.  Cat or Car can mean many different looking things, and kids can't learn that as well with flashcards.  Seriously, if I use a flashcard for Car with a VW Bug, I don't know that she'll automatically make the connection that a Honda Civic is also a car.

And I'd like to also make the statement that unless you are willing to work with your child a bit on some of the words taught in the video, it's not going to work nearly as well.  I'm still using flashcards with her to reinforce what she sees in the videos.

Also, you can't just set your child down in front of the TV and walk away.  You need to watch the video with your child and act excited over what you see, to keep the child interested in learning.  Too many parents think that they can just pop in the DVD and go do their thing, which IMO is a very lazy way of parenting.  Again, most two year olds don't have a very large attention span, so you need to be there to keep them from being distracted.  I knit while my daughter's watching this, which is a great way to supervise her without being totally unselfish at the same time.",1160697600,15,2485,4.198312236286919

And the ""Vocabulary Builder 1-3"" have 5 multilanguage that you can choose: English, French, Spanish, German, and Japanese.  That is 5-in-1 that can save you lots of money.  They also have other extra benefits features such as ""sign language"" and ""Question & answer""!

The ""Motorized Madness"" is also good, it has 10 machines such as ""airplane, bulldozer, dump truck, backhoe loader, helicopter, bucket truck, boat, motlecycle, fire truck, and bus."" It also explains each part of the machine, like the wings, propellers, engine, cab...

The baby bumble bee surely produce the best of the best infant and kids reading program vedios in the market--as good as Dr. Titzer's ""Your baby can read 1-5"" DVDs and Dr. Glenn Dorman's ""How to teach your baby to read"" book.

I love baby bumble bee's ""Opposites"", ""Motorize"", ""Actions words 1-3"" and ""vocabulary builders 1-5"" the most. Highly recommended!",1125705600,10,1207,5.005

7952044,4,B00005RDT9,My son has watched this video a few times now and he seems to enjoy it more every time. He is saying almost all of the words on the video. I think the video more than anything has encouraged him to say the words and repeat them. My son is 2 and half and a little behind in his speech because of chronic ear infections. This has helped him. I recommend you give this a try.,1470096000,,372,3.9078947368421053
