8538224,3,B0099VUYMA,"""Romance of the West"" was made in 1946 and is a slightly better than average
B-Western with the added bonus of Cinecolor.  The movie contains a generous
supply of songs, action, fist fights, shooting, romancing and the star Eddie Dean
has a fine singing voice.  The songs include the well known ""Lovesong of the
Waterfall"" (made popular by Slim Whitman), ""Indian Dawn"" and ""Ridin' the
Trail to Dreamland"".  It is interesting to note that all the songs have an
orchestral musical backing and not guitar as in most singing cowboy films, which
is a welcome variation to a well worn theme.

For a change, the Indians are portrayed as a friendly and peace loving people
who love their land.

The story is about the white man's greed for money and the fact that they want
ownership of Indian lands because it contains extensive silver deposits, so they
hire a band of outlaws to create trouble and drive the Indians out.  Eddie Dean
is the Indian Agent appointed to help the Indians but he cannot convince anyone
that the Indians are being wronged.

For those who appreciate the finer details, the cast includes Don ""Brown Jug""
Reynolds of Little Beaver fame in the Jim Bannon Red Ryder westerns, in his first
credited movie role.

""Romance of the West"" is a western with a difference and should appeal to
lovers of B-Westerns.",1365033600,,1321,4.71304347826087
