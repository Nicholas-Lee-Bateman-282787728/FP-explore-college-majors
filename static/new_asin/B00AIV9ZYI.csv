5437100,5,B00AIV9ZYI,"The flim Scroll, impacked me in many ways, we sometimes look at Bishops,Preachers, and others ministers of the cross as if they do not have challenges in life. The film Scroll, made me realize that We all are People and none of us are exempt when it come to everyday life challenges.",1378771200,4,283,4.461538461538462
5437101,4,B00AIV9ZYI,"This dvd is a group of ministers speaking of trials and experiences they have gone through. One minister spoke of going to ask more time to pay a bill and got told about it and he just cried but God had his back. Another minister spoke of how his wife kept pleading with him to go see a doctor and when he finally goes, he has cancer by the wall had he waited any longer, the cancer would have went through his own body. another Pastor, well two, speak of going through racial incidents as children. One was going to a boat for a cruise and was stopped by the police and boat captain. Another Pastor was a child celebrating WW2 ending and had a flag outside the car and a white family drove up and took theirs from him and the father didn't protest for it to come back. One Pastor spoke lovingly of his being a Muslim and how his Pentacostal secretary's faith changed him. another had a drug addiction. all of them were at the end of their ropes, but somehow, they kept on going. Another minister had a wife who had cancer who through miracle was healed and is still living. What a testament to the awesomemess of God!",1366502400,5,1118,4.253521126760563
5437102,3,B00AIV9ZYI,"I viewed this film from REDBOX and I found it inspirational and serious in tone yet, the short testimonies were about one trial they went through in their lives and no real summary or narrative or back drop information. It was good to see and I do not feel it is a ""documentary"" in its true sense. It is a collection of mini interviews and capitolaizes on the power of the names and prestige of the subjects and is not worth the asking price. More like $8 to $10 dollars max. Enjoyed it and liked it but saw the asking prices and will wait for better price.",1365206400,,557,4.214953271028038
