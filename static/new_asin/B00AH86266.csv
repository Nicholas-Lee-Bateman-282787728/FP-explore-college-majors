8551544,4,B00AH86266,"While it did have plenty of Asian Horror cliches, and too many dream sequences, I still enjoyed it. It was refreshing to see that it didn't hold back on gore and intense sequences, since it seems like other Asian Horror flicks don't do that and tend to focus more on mood and ghostly imagery. Although nothing too original, story-wise, if you're craving a somewhat recent Asian Horror movie with bloody deaths and creepy kids, Ghastly will do.",1443398400,,443,4.766233766233766
