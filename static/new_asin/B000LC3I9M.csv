8160716,1,B000LC3I9M,"I made the mistake of buying 3 of this series in one go and regretted my hasty purchasing. I saw the trailer on another DVD and thought it looked like a sweet movie for my 2 year old. Within minutes of watching the 1st movie I realised that it was not going to be suitable for my little girl. My main reason is because of the grotesque black and white spider character. He looks like a gender confused weirdo! Creepy pasty white, mask-like face with red lips and sharp teeth - enough to give me nighmares, let alone my daughter! Besides that his moral character is questionable and not a positive, uplifting type of influence one is looking for for a 2 year old. I found some of the content to be inappropriate for a 2 year old and I must say I have to question the authors integrity as a children's author.

Both my husband and I felt this is not the kind of viewing we wish for our little girl - our personal opinion and choice, perhaps others will not find the content as ill-fitting for a toddler?!",1238198400,,1002,4.273684210526316
8160717,2,B000LC3I9M,"My kids adore Miss Spider and her bugs, but this story was way too scary.  We made the mistake of turning it on in the car on a trip without previewing it and had to turn it off when both the 3 and 5 year old started crying when the frog was attacked. They found it so scary they don't even want to touch the DVD case. This video is probably fine for kids that are older or who don't get flustered by scary things.",1232928000,,414,3.8705882352941177
8160718,4,B000LC3I9M,"My girls got this DVD along with another Miss Spider DVD (the prince, the princess & the pea).  They much preferred the other DVD & lost interest in this before the DVD was finished.

Mommy thought the animation & storyline was cute though!",1219795200,,240,4.558139534883721

8160720,5,B000LC3I9M,"So who's Felix? Felix is the frog that we meet in this delightful ""Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends"" DVD release. Those that watched ""The Prince, the Princess and the Bee"" have already met Felix, but now you can have a proper introduction to him with a set of three specials from the show. This DVD combines the three specials into one full-length movie. They are ""Secret Frog,"" ""Big Green Bug"" and ""Be Good to Bugs... And Frogs.""

Squirt, Shimmer and Spinner are out playing at the Taddy Puddle, fantasizing about monsters. They discover Felix and are afraid at first, because Felix is a frog and generally, frogs eat bugs. They discover that Felix is prone to getting his tongue tied around things because he has bad aims. But he doesn't eat frogs and is happy to be their friend, because he doesn't really fit in with other frogs. The kids soon have lots of fun playing with Felix, but are disturbed when Spiderus (in one of the late, great Tony Jay's final vocal performances) starts an anti-frog squad.

""A Froggy Day in Sunny Patch"" carries the same philosophy found in other releases in the series and known and loved by fans of the series --- be kind to others and you'll probably receive kindness in return. The CGI animation sparkles as always. Felix is a nice addition to the series and the stories include both great action and tender moments. No ""Miss Spider"" fan should miss this DVD.",1172275200,5,1399,4.637096774193548
