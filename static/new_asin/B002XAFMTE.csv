4008538,5,B002XAFMTE,"Note: I saw this movie in Region 1 on TV for the first time yesterday.

This is truly a great film. I love the sister/brother storyline...so sweet. I've always enjoyed movies with sister/brother plots, but nothing like this has been done before, depicting a sister & brother relationship so sweetly. Sally's fight for her brother well-nigh breaks your heart. I'm an only child, and can only imagine what it would be like to have an older sibling (preferably a female; someone like Sally, for instance). That aspect of the movie is what really intrigued me when i saw part of it on TV years ago and it was only yesterday that I was able to see the entire movie for the first time ever (and without interruption). My only complaint is that the film isn't available in Region 1. It's a great movie. Not Rated, but contains some thematic elements.",1324944000,5,843,4.62
4008539,5,B002XAFMTE,"I look forward to this movie coming to TV every year. It is so heartwarming. It sends quite the message of how what doesnt make sense individually can come together to make a wonderful outcome. The angels are so funny too. They take full advantage of their time as humans. Funny, cute, touching, and sad all rolled in to one. A must see.",1324166400,,337,4.365079365079365
4008540,5,B002XAFMTE,"PLEASE MAKE THIS AVAILABLE FOR THE MULTITUDES OF FANS IN REGION 1. IT IS A COZY MOVIE, LOW KEY; BUT VERY HEART-WARMING & ENJOYABLE DURING THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS,",1317513600,20,161,4.785714285714286
4008541,1,B002XAFMTE,Do not buy from this seller. First of all the film is in another language and when I tried to return it the seller did not want me to return it. I did return it but as of this day I have not gotten my money back. Buyer beware!!,1303948800,3,227,3.6530612244897958

4008555,5,B002XAFMTE,"When Angels Come To Town has everything you'd want in a Christmas movie and more! The cast is wonderful, most especially Peter Falk! His fans will just eat this up -- he's just that good. The plot has a lot of sentimentality, but not enough to be maudlin. The elements of fantasy are really delightful and will entertain the entire family. Adults and children will be completely drawn in by this film, and I truly enjoy watching it any time of year.",1478649600,,449,4.487804878048781

4008560,5,B002XAFMTE,Max the Angel movies are wonderful.,1459209600,,35,5.0
4008561,5,B002XAFMTE,"It most certainly did! Peter Falk, as Mr. Max, is the kind of angel I would hope to meet if angels really exist and I'm lucky enough to meet one. Anyway, there are three angel movies starring him. I first saw them on TV and could hardly wait for them to be available on DVD so, as soon as they were, I bought them. The other two are great but this is my favorite because of the addition of the second angel (Katy Segal), Mr. Max's supervisor, who came down because she was upset with him for making a mistake that might be bad enough to cost him his wings. But was it a mistake or wasn't it - after all, angels don't make mistakes, do they?",1454198400,,640,4.047244094488189

4008565,5,B002XAFMTE,"My favorite of the CBS angel ""Max"" series. Being a native of Ossining NY where Peter Falk grew up as well and meeting him back in 1983, makes these movies very special to me. The other two are, Town without Christmas and Finding John Christmas, Get all three.",1447718400,,259,4.416666666666667
4008566,5,B002XAFMTE,I always liked this movie  but it was so hard to find on DVD  finally.,1442188800,,70,3.6
4008567,5,B002XAFMTE,Inspiring story.  Peter Falk who plays several parts in this film is outstanding and a delight to watch.  A story of the true meaning of Christmas and giving.  A timeless classic.  I will look forward to and watch it every Christmas.  It will definitely put me in the Christmas mood.,1440806400,,283,4.58

4008585,4,B002XAFMTE,The acting and story was very good . Great Christmas movie,1425254400,,58,4.363636363636363
4008586,5,B002XAFMTE,I had been hunting for it. Hoping it would be out on DVD . I like how the angels make every thing work out in the end.  I enjoy watching Peter Faulk in those kinds of roles.  It brings families together when you never expect it to.  Never give up on what you can do for each other.  Helping people  that you just meet.  I am a fan of most Hallmark movies.  I love the holiday movies. Some of them I watch because of who stars in them or the story line itself. This is a very good movie for families to watch and teach your children how good things can happen.,1424908800,,559,3.9375
4008587,5,B002XAFMTE,This movie is so good.  I had never seen it before and now I'm happy to own it.  Beautifully done with a great story and message.,1424217600,,129,3.923076923076923

4008593,5,B002XAFMTE,"When ""Angels Come to Town"" and ""Finding John Christmas"" are two of the best Christmas movies ever! Peter Falk plays a great angel and is a treat to watch. This is a whole family type of movie, and well worth getting, especially if you like a bit of humor.",1423008000,,255,4.224489795918367

4008599,4,B002XAFMTE,"I enjoyed this movie.  Love Peter Faulk's character Max and have seen him in other movies.  The story is good and shows what really matters in life rather than so much actual emphasis on the material things around the holidays.  Katy Segal is good and the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because her character was not as likable early on in the movie.  It takes a little while to get beyond the conflict between her and Max, or at least it did for me.",1421884800,,463,4.054945054945055

I wish I Knew WHY these OLD Christmas VCR's Are so Long To Put on DVD! I know Lots of My Friends Bought Copies Because It is Family Friendly! Plus Peter Falk Made All The Shows ! Will You go back & Look at some of The OTHER OLD Movies From end of Ninety's or early 2000's ! They were on VCR's bur Never Made it to DVD! Most Don't have the Old VCR's! It Brings back Good Memories! Plus Selling Them at Regular Price Surely Is Mot a ""LOSS""! Plus The BLUR RAY is on the Market Down!",1421193600,,609,3.795275590551181

4008638,5,B002XAFMTE,Peter Falk has always been one of my favorites and he does a super job here of playing several characters..most of which seem a bit over the edge but always on the mark. It was touching how close this girl was to her brother and how very much she wanted to help him. I thought that the social worker did not do her job as well as she should have in trying to reunite this family. That is the job of social workers is trying to put families back together. There were also some good back up actors that helped the movie immensely as it came together. I was excited to see it come out in DVD so quickly.,1419292800,5,600,4.050420168067227

The piracy warning played and the CBS logo played but then the screen went black and nothing more played. Do not buy this version, as it doesn't play on all machines.
