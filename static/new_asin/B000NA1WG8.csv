Although the documentary is old (1963), it is still the documentary that better reflects the social phenomena that Pedro Infante  created and still continues to create in Mxico.

Pedro Infante's film career began in 1939, and ended tragically when the plane he was piloting crashed in Yucantn in 1957. He appeared in more than 60 films, and starting in 1943, he recorded about 350 songs.

If you would like to see some of his films, I would like to share my favorites for your consideration:

- Tizoc (1957). He was awarded the Silver Bear of the 1957 Berlin International Film Festival for Best Actor and also a Golden Globe at Hollywood, for 'Best Actor in a Leading Role', awarded by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.
- No Desears la Mujer de tu Hijo(1950).
- Angelitos Negros (1948).
- Los Tres Garcia (1947).
- Nosotros Los Pobres (1948).
- Los Tres Huastecos (1948).
- Sobre las Olas (1950).
- A Toda Mquina (1951).
- Dos Tipos de Cuidado (1953).

Enjoy!",1213056000,6,1115,4.6395939086294415

Other than a few home movies that show him at rest, director Ismael Rodriguez in this film mostly celebrates him through clips of the  many films they did together, and they were surely some of the finest films ever made. There are fantastic scenes from ""Los Tres Garcia,"" ""Nosotros los Pobres,"" ""Sobre las Olas,""  ""A.T.M.: A Toda Maquina!,"" ""Pepe El Toro,"" ""Tizoc,"" and many more. Rodriguez was the most influential director in Infante's career, and there is a clip where Infante speaks of his gratitude for all he has learned from Rodriguez.

Beautifully written by Rodriguez and Ricardo Garibay, with narration by Arturo de Cordova, and music by Raul Lavista, ""Asi Era Pedro Infante"" has moments that are sheer poetry, and starts by recreating the morning of April 15th, 1957, imagining how many radios were tuned to an Infante song, as he sings ""Las Golondrinas."" There is film of the actual fatal plane crash site, and then the camera follows the funeral cortege, and then the burial, interspersed with the film clips. Flying was Infante's passion, and he wanted to die flying, and be buried with music playing; his wishes were granted, and at the height of his fame, though through all the accolades and awards, he retained his simplicity: ""Un hombre que a la cumbre de la fama, no perdio su sencillez, no perdio su humildad.""

The extras include a wonderful piece about Ismael Rodriguez directed by his son, and subtitles in several languages. This is a ""must have"" for Infante fans, and is one of the 23 films put out by Warner Brothers' 50 Aniversario Edicion de Homenaje for Infante, and will hopefully bring his films to an even wider audience because they include the choice of subtitles.",1178323200,8,1919,4.806060606060606
