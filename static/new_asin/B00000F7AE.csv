1205821,3,B00000F7AE,"This movie is pretty cool.  At the time, it was quite good due to mixing real people with the 3D modeling or whatever they were using for Stuart Little.  The story is good and the movie has some humor.  I don't think the movie was 4 stars, but it was probably better than 3 stars.  I would say between 3 and 3.5 stars.

The DVD case itself was well made, not the more flimsy clam-shell style.  The DVD had a decent amount of bonus features and extras, which was very nice to see.",1464307200,,479,4.096774193548387

The story of a cute little mouse trying to survive in the big bad world while living with his human people and trying to fit in until he finds his true love.

1205891,3,B00000F7AE,"It's an entertaining movie if you're not expecting it to be like the book. There are almost no story-lines from the book that made it into the movie. My son was disappointed in that because we had just finished the book and he was hoping to see Margalo and see Stuart substitute teach in the classroom. Also, I found it strange that for a kids movie, the cats in the ""gang"" used foul language a few times. (d***, h***) My kids didn't even hear it but I was disappointed in the choice to include it in a children's movie. That being said, they were entertained and enjoyed seeing Stuart in ""real life"". :)",1454457600,2,604,4.353982300884955

1206566,3,B00000F7AE,"Stuart Little the movie is not at all like the book. The same family members are there, along with some of the set pieces (the boat, the car), but otherwise--everything's different.  And that may be a good thing. The book felt incongruent, suffering from no real plot and a chopped-off ending. In the book, the reader is left wondering if Stuart finds the bird. In the movie, there is no bird. There's also no little girl, no doctor, no school house, and no telephone line worker.

The plot of the movie--again, something the book didn't have--is that Stuart struggles with his identity within the family. This is because in the movie Stuart is adopted. Stuart's human brother wants no part of Stuart; the family cat is laughed at from other cats because he has a mouse owner. Those are the two things that drive the plot: how does Stuart connect with the humans and how does he avoid the ulterior motives of the cat?

Overall the movie is decent enough to sit through. There are plenty of A-list cast members supporting this. It's also directed by a now-famous director. The plot is enough to ask ""what's going to happen next?"" And the movie isn't too scary or rough for the kids. It's not one of my favorite kids' movies, but it's tolerable.",1383523200,2,1243,4.59009009009009

1206647,3,B00000F7AE,"I wanted to like this movie. The kids (six, twins) were very excited about watching it. They're both into mice, for some reason. And some of it was cute. Whomever was in charge of casting did a great job. Loved the costuming, Geena Davis's hair, and the fact that it takes place in NYC/Brooklyn, which is exciting for kids living in NY who recognize certain landmarks. There are a lot of reasons to like the film - like the message that family doesn't have to be related or get along all the time to love each other and be a family. However, watching it with kids who have been through adoption or foster care is not ideal. It causes anxiety throughout as Stuart is taken away by fake parents and made to believe that his family hates him. As for the cat chase scene, why couldn't he just leave, see his picture on a poster, realize that the cat lied, and go back home? I kept reminding the kids that the Little's loved Stuart very much, but they were worried when he was given up so easily. Much of the film felt a bit like an Annie ripoff (right down to the ""reappearance"" of ""parents"" who have actually died), but at least Daddy Warbucks didn't let her leave with the criminals!

Additionally, there was NO REASON for there to be an abundance of curse words flowing from the mouth of the cat(s). I'm not a prude. I let them watch ET (in which one boy calls the other 'p3nis breath'). But from both a parental/teacher standpoint and from a creative one, I have NO IDEA why the writers of this film felt the need to thrown in words like ""damn"" and ""hell"" so many times. In a PG movie featuring talking animals, ""What the whiskers?!"" would've sufficed just fine. It was unnecessary and interrupted the flow of the film. Does the novel include these words? I read it over 20 years ago, so I don't recall. Not that it matters, because the point is, it didn't fit.

1206730,1,B00000F7AE,"Parents, do yourself and your children a favor and DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS HORRIBLE FILM and instead, spend the SAME money on buying the BOOK.

Then, READ THE BOOK to your children. It will take about an hour and thirty minutes, approximately the same running time as this film.
The result? Your child will have an invaluable touch with a piece of classic American children's literature and a precious memory of time spent with you reading the story.

If you plop them in front of the TV and watch this dreck you will have rotted their minds.

My wife and I pre-screened this film and immediately THREW IT IN THE TRASH.

(Full disclosure: we are very conservative politically and observant Catholics).

The good things: Geena Davis delivers her usual good performance in a limited role (she was hilarious in ""Earth Girls are Easy""), and pretty much all the performances were solid.

The visuals and animation, the pristine New York City settings, spot-on costumes, and characters (apart from the cats) are also very well done, the art direction is excellent.

The bad things (and there are lots so bear with me): the cats use gutter mouth and in contrast to the book this is a gigantic pity party for Stuart throughout. His pathetic loneliness undo all the positives.

In contrast to the book, Stewart is found in an orphanage, and he is abandoned by parent figures three times in the course of the movie! Once by his real parents, once by the Littles, and once by some mice posing as his real parents. Horrible!

Stuart's new brother George does not like Stuart (in the book he is sort of a cloddish benign older brother), until Stuart is a big winner, THEN he is interested in Stuart. The transition from love to hate in a single scene is jarring (nice message).

Horrible, horrible horrible rock music (and I like *punk rock*) during chase and slapstick scenes.

The whole Little family's sweetness to Stuart is cloying (but then they abandoned him, go figure).

Stuart's ""innocence and cuteness"" boarders on diabetic shock sweetness of ""Hello Kitty.""

I completely agree with a review here titled ""Have we no shame"" when they wrote: ""It's a crime and a sin what was done to E.B. White's classic children's novel. Heartless Hollywood got hold of it, ripped its guts out, threw in some snazzy effects, irrelevant slapstick, and rock music, and dared to call it ""Stuart Little."" All in the name of money. I'm not saying some six year-olds won't have fun watching it, but for the love of integrity, someone please read them the book.""

So read them the book.

E.B. White's original ""Stuart Little"" is the story of a mouse born to a normal human family who lives on the upper east side of New York. Stuart must overcome challenges as a small being in a normal sized world and his interactions with his normal family and their care for him make for lively reading. One day Margalo, an injured bird, enters Stuart's life and they become friends. One day the family cat, Snowbell, and an alley cat come up with a plan to kill Margalo. A pigeon overheard the plan and sent a note to Margalo, and so Margalo leaves. Stuart sets out to search for Margalo and the story ends with him still searching. The story appeals to children because of fine balance of a blend of fantasy and reality. Children relate to the obstacles Stuart encounters because of his size and encourages children to learn to use determination to overcome obstacles in life. It also concludes with the bittersweet ending that we must keep searching and trying, even when we do not find.

Do not buy this movie. Buy the book. Read it to them. Give your children the gift of life and literature, not Hollywood tommyrot.",1290556800,5,3683,4.678018575851393
1206731,5,B00000F7AE,Stuart Little was a great addition to my classroom.  We have read several books with the mouse as the main character.  Showing this movie was a great ending to a perfect unit.  My class loved watching it and analyzing the characters.,1289606400,,233,4.634146341463414

1206783,2,B00000F7AE,"Okay, here's what I like about Stuart Little. I did like Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie, and Nathan Lane. All three of them gave very good performances. That's it. The rest of the movie is trash. I never read E.B. White's original children's book, so I have nothing against the actual story. One of the problems I have with this film in particular is that it tries really hard to be as sweet as it can, and it turns out to look and feel MUCH too sentimental. The dialogue is corny, and the humor is dull (even for a family film). Plus, the innocence and cuteness of the main character (of the same name) is forced to the point that he is painfully irritating to look at. Now, Michael J. Fox is a brilliant actor, but his voice for the mouse does get annoying by the second half of the film. And I never liked the roles that Jonathan Lipnicki has ever played (including the one in the film Jerry Maguire), and his character named George Little is a big reminder of why I don't.

You may think that I'm too harsh, but honestly I don't completely hate this film. Davis, Laurie, and Lane are indeed good, but they can't save Stuart Little from being a pretty bad film. It tries too hard to be cute and innocent, but in the end result, it's almost annoying.

Against these difficulties, Stuart resolves to face them with as much pluck, love and courage as he can muster. In doing so, he shows his beloved new family that great things can truly come in small packages. Truly a family movie, especially made for kids.

Stuart Little (the book) is enchanting.  This movie is foul.  Let's set aside for a moment that the plot of the movie is unrelated to the book.  The movie as it stands does not measure up to what it could have been.

They use real people and animals (except for fake mouths when the animals ""talk"") and an animated mouse (Stuart, voiced by animation favorite Michael J. Fox.) who looks incredibly life-like.

The colors in this movie are terrific, especially with the house that the Little family lives in. The story has some clever stuff in it but it strictly played for laughs and reactions since credibility is about zero in many parts of this story. However, it's supposed to be outrageous.

 I don't think Geena Davis has ever played a nicer role than this. It was good to see. The husband was just as nice, played affably by Hugh Laurie.

The jokes are good for the kids and adults. I know a couple of parents who liked this movie even better than their kids, so don't believe it when someone writes that this is a film strictly for kids. That is not so. I did object to some profanity in here at the end, which seemed so out of place, but it's hard to expect Hollywood to get everything right.

After all, there's a cuddly mouse doing people things, there's cats, and about half the movie consists of chases of one sort or another.  There's also a lot of seamless and convincing animation (except for the ""talking"" mouths on the cats, which looks goofy).  Any fans of E.B. White's book Stuart Little will be wise to avoid the movie, as they have nothing in common except the existence of a mouse-sized boy. It's as if the Hollywood folks made the movie first, and then decided to put a famous name on it, without any care as to the actual words in the book. It's too bad.  The movie's plot is mostly fine for kids, who haven't learned to watch critically yet or expect self-consistency, coherence, or variation from standard hackneyed scenes and themes.

Where SL2 is cheerful, uplifting, witty, charming, and full of energy, this one is just the opposite - dark, dreary and sad. In SL2, Mr. and Ms. Little are unfailingly optimistic. Here, they often look haggard and defeated. In SL2, Snow Bell/Nathan Lane stole the show with a warm heart, a terrific voice and some of the funniest one-liners. Here, the voice is deadpan and the cat is just mean. In SL2, Michael J Fox voiced Stuart so well, I literally see Stuart as Fox - the two (the actor and the character) have became one. Here, I get the distinct feeling that an actor, Fox, is reading the script behind the mouse, Stuart. In SL2, Falcon is a bad guy you love to hate. Here, Smoky is just a dislikeable bad guy.

1206921,5,B00000F7AE,"I thought this Movie was just kid's stuff, but when I saw it at HBO-I realized how wrong my preconceived notion was. Stuart Little is a story of great human interest.  On the surface, it appears like its made for children because the cast include animals led by my favorite protagonist, the mouse Stuart Little.  For children, it is simple happy entertainment feature but I think, for adults, it is of great human interest because the animals (e.g. cats and the mouse Stuart Little really personify people's nature.  The movie serves as man's mirror of himself-its very effective for self-evaluation and change.  I think movies that have animals portraying human characteristics are the most objective means of letting people know with what they are identified with, to determine if there are some things in themselves that need to change in order for them to be useful members of  society.  This evaluation of the content of the movies is based on my analysis of the real substance of Stuart Little's story.  Overall, its a very nice movie for general patronage- very wholesome and relaxing.

GASP!!  Maybe it is just that he is so naive.  He jus thinks everybody loves him.  Or maybe it is just that he is so stupid as to think that the Little's were so glad to get rid of him they cut his picture out and he believes SnowBell.

As a real family? Oh, we will have so much fun!"". And that's nice for children, but everybody over the age of 10 will be irritated of it.  And ok, maybe that's the whole idea of Stuart Little, and that's why it's such a succes. But I think they at least could put some of the ""adult-humor"" in it, like Disney always does.

White's winning children's book, is quite mawkish at times. However, the corny note doesn't feel forced, but it is still there, which is the only reason Stuart Little loses it 3 points. The visual effects are just amazing, its remarkable to see the talking cats and mouse's without those bulging mouths and poorly edited vocabulary. The star line-up includes the talents of Michael J. Fox as Stuart, Geena Davis as Mrs. Little and a fantastic voicing talent from Nathan Lane as the Little's cat, Snowbell. There are also some exhilirating sequences, including the boat race and the scene in which Stuart is chased by a bunch of hungry ally-cats. Some scenes aren't like this, though. Some are just really unfunny and laughable, but those come along briefly and thankfully not often. All in all, Stuart Little is a step in the right direction after Rob Minkoff's 1994 animated directing success of Disney's The Lion King.

1207001,3,B00000F7AE,"Stuart Little
Score: 64/100
He's clever. He's enthusiastic. He's a can-do little guy with an attitude. And he's a mouse. From the co-director of The Lion King and the writer of The Sixth Sense comes an entertaining family film from classic American author E.B. White. It's surely a star-studded crew there, and there's not much a family of four could white other than a couple of talking mouse's and many exciting scenes. Even though Stuart Little falls flat from a few flaws, it's still a fun children's comedy, that will be worth your time, depending on your feelings towards movies like this.
In a cosy house near New York City's Central Park, Mr. and Mrs. Little (Hugh Laurie and Geena Davis) bring home a surprising addition to the family...Stuart (voiced by Michael J. Fox), and he's a er...mouse. Despite the urgings of Mrs. Keeper at the orphanage to adopt within their own species, the Littles beam with the pride of new parents. At home the little guy with a big heart (not to mention whiskers, a little pink nose and a really dapper wardrobe), searches for a sense of belonging and a place to call home in the decidedly supersized world. When Stuart is adopted by the Littles he embarks on an adventure with a variety of characters - including his nemesis, the cat Snowball (voiced by Nathan Lane) - and learns the true meaning of family, loyalty and friendship. The Littles, in the meantime, each discover there is a Stuart in all of us - the spunk, spirit and courage to be true to ourselves and follow our dreams despite the odds.
Stuart Little is a good movie, but it suffers majorly from an over-corny note. It's big smiles and drowning frowns all the time, none of the characters ever look normal. Their expressions are practically drawn in, and none of them have much originality about them apart from Stuart, of course. Still, the film provides plenty of entertaining scenes, including an exhilarating cat chase and a superb boat race. It may have a sense of bore in some parts of the film, but overall, it's a very bearable movie that will silent children and, surprisingly, adults for a rainy day. It's a film that combines live action with some groundbreaking visual effects by artists and innovators who have taken digital character creation to a bold new level with the birth of Stuart. The visual effects are the most plausible thing about the film, they are truly memorable, it's some of the most amazingly done animal-talking done since Babe.
Not as good as it could've been, Stuart Little is still watchable fun, a film where you can really expect the whole family to enjoy it.",986601600,2,2605,4.714912280701754

Bear in mind, when you watch this movie as an adult you must be able to suspend reality for a while (a talking mouse being adopted by humans?  Nothing strange about that, right)? But if you can, you're in for a treat, because it really is a very endearing film!  Stuart Little is perfect for younger children (if you don't mind a few swearing cats) with a wonderful message woven throughout:  THERE'S NOTHING QUITE LIKE BEING PART OF A FAMILY!

The plots were also done very well, even though there are many background plots, they don't confuse you like many other movies. They were also well put together, you could understand all that was going on right then.
However, as I said before, this movie isn't perfect. I think they could have done without the cuss words if this was supposed to be a kids movie, and some scenes seem like they were added in just to add time, such as the scene where Stuart gets stuck in the washer.

The picture quality is decent with bright colours. However, the sound effect is not that dynamic though (I could hardly hear any surround effects from my rear speakers). But the plot of the movie can make up for it.
Definitely a worthy title to add to your collection. In fact, I am also think about getting a rat after watching Stuart Little. Can anyone tell me if dogs and rats mix? I have a Jack Russel.",978480000,,964,4.302197802197802

The Little family walked around wearing big cheesy grins, to a point where I wanted to punch the smiles off with my fist. Stuart is WAY too cute for my liking.  The only time I was amused was when Stuart got stuck in the washing machine  (unfortunatley, Mrs. Little got him out).

1207238,5,B00000F7AE,"This has got to be the cutest and sweetest movie I've ever seen.  Michael J. Fox was the perfect voice for the Little mouse.  I could almost see Michael J. Fox as Stuart Little held his little hands in front of himself  and said, ""I'm family.""
It took George, the little boy, time to  get used to Stuart, but once he did, he was just like a brother.
The cat,  Snow Bell, was perfect.  All the little bits of dialogue between him and  Stuart are priceless.  ""Can't we be friends?"" Stuart asks.  ""Mmmm,... NO!"" Snow Bell sputters.  It was perfect.  And the part  where Stuart doesn't know what to do with a pet: ""Can I scratch your  belly?""  and the cat says, ""From the inside?""
E.B. White  must be awfully proud of this film, as E.B. White wrote the book.  I'm  afraid I do not know how old the book is, but I think it is a classic, and  the film done it proud.
Any child from three to a hundred and three  should watch this movie.",961286400,,930,4.1525423728813555
1207239,2,B00000F7AE,"There are good things about the movie, there are bad things about the movie. The four-year-old reviewer didn't like it because, and I quote, ""the cats were mean."" They were also funny, and the feline antics  in this movie were one of its high points. The kid who played George was  top-nitch, as well, even if the script he had to work with was a little  thin (movies where one cast member's feelings about another go from hate to  love in one scene drive me bats, and it happens here twice). Having never  read E. B. White's book, I've no idea whether any of this at all was  faithful to that, but if so, I need to go back and look at E. B. White with  a far more critical eye; I think he's a better writer than this, though.  Blame the adaptation.

And the mouse? The animation was good. Could  have been better, but then I saw this five days after seeing Toy Story 2,  and anyone's animation would pale in comparison to the wonders being  churned out twice yearly by Pixar. So I can't really fault them for not  spending the extra twenty million or so to come up with the world's best  animation.

Now for the humans. First off, no one will be giving  makeup Oscars to the person who worked on Geena Davis; had someone hit her  with a ruler during the making of this film, it would have sunk in at least  to the 6. She moves very slowly throughout the movie, no doubt because  she's wearing at least fifty pounds of pancake makeup. The other main human  character is Hugh Laurie; I've never been a Fry and Laurie fan, but I must  admit he's an engaging sort. Almost as good as the kid.

And then come  the cameos. There were so many stars in this movie with less than a minute  of screen time I had flashbacks to The Thin Red Line. The always-underrated  Kimmy Robertson shows up for a single line; Dabney Coleman gets about  fifteen seconds. And so on, and so on. Even Chazz Palminteri (as the voice  of the main alley cat) gets more screen time, and he never shows up bodily.  Sheesh. (Palminteri, by the way, is a riot.) Even Estelle Getty, who's a  many-times-proven comic genius, gets one line. The rest of her screen time  is great because she plays a deadpan role better than any other  seventy-odd-year-old lady in movies today, but it's still a waste of  awe-inspiring talent.

So what do we have? A cute story that could  have been scripted better; an excellent cast that could have been used  better; and a bunch of really, really good animals. You make the call. If  you take into account the fact that I got free parking out of it, I paid  $1.25, which is about right.",961286400,,2584,4.330543933054393

So while not a classic, or even a very good movie, ""Stuart  Little"" does at least deliver what it promises. There are worse ways  to spend an hour and a half.",961027200,,552,4.591836734693878

It follows his trials and  tribulations as he and they (including their cat) learn to live  together.
They storyline doesn't contain any particular surprises but the  whole thing is so well put together, it's a pleasure to watch.
In  addition, the extras on the DVD are some of the best around and put the  majority of other DVDs to shame.

I must let you  know though that this DVD uses the ""seamless branching  technology"" which a few DVD players won't play.  My newer player has  this problem but fortunately you can access the special features via your  ""goto"" and ""title"" buttons.
The movie has great  colors and the digital 5.1 can be heard in certain areas of the movie which  is cool.
The movie itself was great and would be great to show your  children.  Cat lovers may question the movie and maybe PETA as well.
As  for the extras...my when they say it's loaded...it's LOADED!  Although  the movie is 85 minutes long, they loaded this DVD with perhaps hours of  extras.  The gag reel is very funny and expect yourself to be watching this  DVD for several hours.
I have to say that Stuart Little is one of the  best DVD's that children and parents will love.  It also features an  all-star cast doing the voices of the characters.

The  computer-generated animation is flawless, and those with pet cats or  rodents will share a knowing smile or two as the watch their pets' various  personalities acted out on the screen. The DVD sound and picture is  unbelievably clear and as for the extras - it's what Disney would call a  `special edition' - This is what a DVD should be like as standard.

The computer animation is top  notch but it's more than just an eye candy film - it's a skillful retelling  of a heart-warming story.
Stuart himself is an entertaining character,  but other characters also get a look in with funny lines (Snowball, the  cat, comes out with a couple of classics).  I also enjoyed Hugh Laurie and  Geena Davis as the oh-so-nice Mr and Mrs Little; tongue in cheek  performances but not so much as to demean their characters.

I found the movie hilariously funny and very  entertaining. The computer graphics that made that little mouse come to  life was simply amazing and the attention to the sublte details was even  more impressive. The script and plot of the movie is pretty simplistic and  the movie should really only be taken for it's novelty value as it's  concept and animation are highly original. There is no 'deep and  meaningful' theme behind it and that's probably what makes it such a  success. It's nothing but pure fun!
As usual, Geena davis shines in the  movie and Jonathan Lipnicki is as adorable as the kid he played in  ""Jerry Maguire"". The voice of the little mouse is played superbly  by Micheal J.

What a delightful little film. It totally  entranced my six and seven year old kids and it was all I could do not to  keep the tears from streaming. Boy wants a younger son, parents adopt  mouse, boy gets disappointed but mouse and boy become best friends. Mouse's  parents come to get him, everyone sad, turns out to be a set up, mouse  escapes. Happy ending where even the treacherous cat ends up being a  goodie.
The CGI is amazing. The mouse (Stuart), his parents and the  talking cats are superbly well done. The little kid (Jonathon Lipnicki) is  just as good as he was in Jerry Maguire. Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie do not  really have to do much - but they do the clean living caring parents to a  tee.
There are some good laughs and some great cameos (watch out for  Stuart's 'parents) but where the DVD comes into its own is in all the  extras you get. There are music videos, out takes, deleted scenes.  storyboards. You name it, the DVD has got it.

It has the same gentle pace as Disney's BAMBI.  While four-year-olds will likely feel drawn to the adventure, older  children may lose interest, because, after all, the movie telegraphs the  story's ending early on, and it will not take a great deal of  sophistication for older children to know what will happen. These older  children may, however, wonder how Stuart has been made, and they can take  advantage of the extra DVD features that demonstrate processes. The DVD  also contains a wealth of supplementary material, from a ""read  along"" session to games and brief documentaries. Making the older  children familiar with special effects processes may inspire them to create  their own work.

1207397,5,B00000F7AE,"""Stuart Little"" is the kind of movie that our family waits to buy when it hits VHS because we know we'll watch it over and over again.  With two toddlers at home, we almost never go to the theatre:  it's  cost-prohibitive, drinks aren't served in sippy-cups, and no one at the  theatre will punch the ""pause"" button while you change a  diaper!
Knowing that Michael J. Fox provides the voice of the main  character, watch this video with his characterization of Alex P. Keaton  (""Family Ties"" television series--remember that one?) in mind.  The animators must've used the new technology in which the ""live""  actor is rigged up with a special suit which translates his movements to  the screen when the animation is done.  Watch Stuart's movements; it's  Michael J. Fox all over--except that he's a mouse!
Suspend your  disbelief and allow yourself to imagine that a human family would, in fact,  adopt a little mouse into their family.  The human characters in the movie  certainly accept this fact as possible.
Best points of the film:  the  boat race scene is wonderful, suspenseful, and had even the fortyish crowd  at our house hollering and cheering--and gasping when Stuart was in danger;  the scenes with the little red roadster were wonderful and entirely  realistic; and the cats are superb!  The movement of their mouths is just  slightly exaggerated, but still quite believable.  As a cat-owner (can one  ever really ""own"" a cat?), the funniest scene is the one in which  Snowbell sends the pack of alley cats into the drink.  I looked for a blurb  at the end of the credits saying that ""no cats were harmed in the  filming of the production,"" but I didn't find such a statement.  It  was totally realistic--and hilariously funny!
Only a concern or two:  I  don't know what constitutes a ""PG"" rating, but that is the rating  given to this film.  I did notice--and do NOT LIKE--that the word  ""damn"" is used at least once, the phrase, ""what the  hell"" occurs about twice, and I really don't think the film would've  suffered if those phrases had been left out.  Fortunately, we always watch  TV at home with the  closed-captioning on, and the words often pop up at  the bottom of the screen just a couple of moments before the dialogue is  heard; that gives Mom or Dad time to hit the ""mute"" button on the  remote for just a second, or to distract the small children who are  watching the movie.  There is no overt violence in the film, but Stuart is  threatened quite frequently by the cat(s) in the film, and sometimes my  young children are sensitive to certain phrases which allude to a movie  character being killed or being threatened with death.
Normally I'm not  a Geena Davis fan, but she was sweet in this movie, and I enjoyed her  performance.  It seems like I should know who Hugh Laurie is, but I just  can't place him, and that makes him the perfect choice to portray the  nerdy-but-well-meaning dad.  I've been unable to see the credits at the end  of the film; they are too tiny to read from a reasonable distance, and I  couldn't carry the baby to the TV fast enough to get a better look.  Maybe  Columbia Pictures could use a larger type-style in future--and give the  credits the full screen rather than making them compete with the additional  footage at the end of the film.  Many movie buffs like me stay in the  theatre until the credits have rolled to a complete stop; we want to see  who all the actors in a film were, even the minor ones.  (Wasn't that one  of the Tilly sisters who played the ""fake"" mouse-mother?  Even  her make-up and mannerisms pegged her as a Tilly for me.)
After the movie  is over, the VHS version includes a couple minutes of out-takes and  bloopers from the making of ""Stuart Little.""  They're fun to  watch, too, and give ordinary people like me a glimpse into the world of  movie-making.  It must be a fabulous job to be an actor.
Just be aware of  the handful of expletives that occur in this film before you plunk your  children down in front of the set if you want them to watch ""Stuart  Little"" unsupervised.  My kids are just the age that they pick up  every new word they hear, and it's not at all cute to have your  ""baby"" say swear words in public.  Maybe Columbia could edit out  the cuss words are re-issue ""Stuart Little"" with a ""G""  rating.",957052800,23,4316,4.549148099606815

GREAT movie -- charming story of family, friendship, jealousy, and  adventure.  AND brilliantly crafted.  Just for kids?  No way.  By the way  -- get the book, too.  The storyline in the movie is quite different from  the book, but both are wonderful.  Just different.",956707200,,413,4.4324324324324325

I don't have kids, so I don't go to kids movie's much, but this movie made me glad that there are people still making quality kids movies that are intelligent  and witty, and not just Barney spouting don't-think-just-listen platitudes.  The movie theater was full of kids and they all seemed to have a blast  with it.  As an adult, however, I found it to be very entertaining and  intelligent on an adult level.  Besides the amazing special effects, the  acting, the dialog, and the pacing were right on.  I know that kids like to  watch the movies they love over and over again, and if I had a kid, I  wouldn't mind if he wanted to watch this one a thousand times or so.",956707200,,737,4.192857142857143

But a good story of a friendly mouse that joins  an open, caring family.

1207453,1,B00000F7AE,I am so glad I watched this movie before showing it to my daughter. I and MANY parents in the adoptive community were very disappointed at the way the subject of adoption was handled in this movie. So scary for an adopted  child to feel his/her hard won love and security in a family is ominously  threatened. The effects and the acting in this movie are fabulous;  nonetheless I give the movie *negative 5 stars* for its insensitive  handling of a very delicate issue for any adopted child.

1207459,4,B00000F7AE,"Though it strays considerably from the classic book, Stuart Little is nonetheless a terrific children's movie, specifically young children between say, 3 and 7 or 8.  Slow-moving at times for adults, I admired the  filmmakers for deliberately crafting a wonderfully imagined movie that is  never TOO scary or TOO loud or TOO disturbing for the youngest viewers in  the audience. There are not enough of these movies today, the kind of  movies that draw youngsters into the theatre to experience the joy of  movie-going with an audience.  The familial message is warmly relayed, and  the movie's New York City is alternately delightfully whimsical and just  scary enough in the nighttime Central Park scenes. The special effects  simply amaze you, and the vocal antics of Nathan Lane will make you laugh  out loud, regardless of your age.",956016000,16,837,5.080882352941177

The basic plot revolves around the Little family, who adopt Stuart  (a mouse) despite warnings to ""adopt within your own  species.""
The computer-generated animation is flawless, and those  with pet cats or rodents will share a knowing smile or two as the watch  their pets' various personalities acted out on the screen.
The plot may  be silly, sappy and somewhat simplistic, but your entire family will love  to watch this film again and again as Stuart and his friends scamper into  and sometimes across your heart.  A wonderful film for everyone.",952387200,24,773,5.063492063492063
1207508,3,B00000F7AE,"The mouse is nice, the human actors mostly compassionate and beam all the time, it's a nice kiddie production - why not just relax and exit a movie theater with a big happy grin?
As my 7-year old son said -""If a few  more scenes were added the film is worth a DVD issue."" -
That's  right. We are plunged into the movie. No explanations. No motives are  outlined. Why that seemingly sane couple who already have a cute little boy  decided to adopt a rodent?
Previous footage of the son playing alone in  his room while the parents attend to their professional duties could help  but there is no such footage.
And when you are shown elaborate Western  town set, boat and many other hand-made objects that speak of hundreds  hours the dad spends with his son sharing the joy of creativity the  question is do they need someone else? And need him so bad that on the  adoption day the boy boorsts into the parental bedroon frantic with  expectation, eager to share his playroom, toys and the father's attention  with a stranger. That does not ring true.
Yes, it's a fairy tale, but  there is nothing magical about the discrepansies of the film - and it has  many. The script lacks integrity and all too often offends the common  sense. I was not surprised to see that Shayamalan person of Sixth Sense  fame as a co-writer. That explains a lot.
Being so much fascinated with  neurotics Mr. Shayamalan just could not make Stuart a joyful little cutie.  The mouse suffers from some kind of guilty conscience and trying too hard  to please everyone. Every time he fails to do so the mouse succumbs to  depresion. It's supposed to make him look more complex and alive, more  sophisticated than the other mouse of American cinema. Also much less  likable.
There are 52 weekends in a year, and we all like to take our  kids to the movies so you'll certainly see that movie too - it's a  mega-budget production of a major studio, it's very unlikely to be a 100%  flop. But something's amiss.
