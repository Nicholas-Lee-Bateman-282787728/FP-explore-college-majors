31629,2,0780621638,"Yes, I loved the scenery, but the only thing ""moving"" in this film was the bus.
Well, maybe I'm being too harsh.  I did like the interplay between Emma Thompson's character and her mother -- to a point.  The mother's character really did become annoying; if she'd asked once more, ""Are you going to Australia?"" I'd have thrown a shoe at the television screen.
The other stories were not as interesting:  There's Emma's son, who invites a rather odd and sexually aggressive female in for a hot bath (no really, just a bath!), two little old ladies whose hobby is attending funerals, and two boys who are overly concerned with the development of their primary sexual attributes.  I kept waiting for the next scene with Emma and her mother but. when it came, all they did was trudge along through the gorgeous scenery carping at each other.
If you want an excellent film about mother/daughter relationships and mortality, rent ""Terms of Endearment.""  The scenery's not as beautiful as this one, but the script's a lot better.",997574400,5,1022,4.784090909090909
31630,5,0780621638,"Director Rickman does justice to the play 'The Winter Guest' written by Sharman Macdonald.  If you loved this movie, you will enjoy reading the play, too.

31631,1,0780621638,"Booooooring nothingness!  While watching this film I felt just like when watching a tv-weekday-afternoon soap opera: I kept wanting to reach inside my set and shake the characters and scream ""Get a life!""
Ok, so this is not high-action.  No plot twists, no ""surprises""  (I had recently seen ""Howards End"" and was delighted to see how the characters all ultimately intermingled).  That's ok.  But ""The Winter Guest"" presents the mundane as art.  Almost in a perverse, mocking kind of way-- daring me to notice that the emperor is, in fact, wearing no clothes.  Like when someone takes common household items and displays them in an art gallery.
Yes, beautiful scenery: starkness of winter, the black-and-white cinematographic equivalent of ANdrew Wyeth's painting.
But the characters were a bunch of atrabilious, disgruntled, dyspeptic, meddling, scowling, harping, belligerent quidnuncs.  It's like they ALL got up on the wrong side of the bed or something, and were egging each other on, trying verbally to start a fight!  Note: THis conclusion reached from only about 50% of the dialogue; the other half I could not understand because of the way heavy Scottish accent... hmmm, maybe I missed the good half, and would have written a more favorable review had I been able to understand more of what they said.
In my defense, I do tend to appreciate the depiction of the seamy side of life more than most.  I do not need ""pretty"" or ""exciting"" to consider a film valuable.  But this film was downright vapid.  Furthermore, the characters were unlikable, their dialogue hard-to-understand and edgy, and their interactions Soap-opera-style melodramatic.",981590400,7,1650,5.161654135338346
31632,5,0780621638,"The setting for ""The Winter Guest"" (based on the stage play) is a small fishing village in Scotland where the sea is frozen as far as the  eye can see. Frances (Emma Thompson) is a professional photographer mired  in grief over the recent death of her husband. She cannot make herself  climb out of bed -- even for her son. Photographs Frances took of her  deceased husband line the walls and run up the stairs. At one point during  the film her son tells a friend their house is haunted and his dead father  has imprisoned his mother.
One cold winter day, Frances' mother Elspeth  (Phyllida Law--Emma's real mother) comes calling -- she is the 'winter  guest.' She encourages Frances to start living again. At Elspeth's urging,  she and Frances spend the day together walking and talking in the frozen  landscape -- Frances with her camera in hand and Elspeth with her  cigarettes. At the end of the walk, Frances seems a bit less grieved and  the frozen space between the mother and daughter has thawed.
Three  subplots have been worked into the main tale: two small boys playing hooky;  Frances' son meeting a new girl; and two older ladies taking the #22 bus to  an out of town funeral.
Alan Rickman dircted this masterpiece of  stunning visual beauty. The film consists of shot after shot of black and  white photographs suitable for framing. Some color is provided by the  occasional jumper (sweater) or other inanimate object, but mostly this is a  black and white film. If you're fascinated with photograpy and/or  cinematography, you will enjoy this film. The musical score is lovely and  quite appropriate for the setting (piano solos by Michael Kamen with a  female vocal during the final credits).
The photography reminds me a bit  of the footage from ""The Sweet Hereafter"" though most of it is  very original.  The story line is reminiscent of ""Truly, Madly,  Deeply"" which starred Rickman.  This is a thoughtful film. My husband  has watched it twice, so I don't think it appeals only to women.",966556800,97,2008,4.758720930232558

31675,5,0780621638,"I caught this movie on a Sunday on satellite tv and loved it. This film should have been critically acclaimed for the directors use of scenery and lighting to evoke such a first person sense of presence. This story of a thirties something widow who is reluctantly starting over again with very little motivation and her wiser, concerned Mother who is watching over the situation and is constantly causing her daughter to reflect on her life and the far-reaching consequences of her decision to run away and start over anew.
  The film also develops a worthwhile subplot involving the budding romance of her young son who is trying to find his own answers to life while dealing with the trials and tribulations of a young man facing puberty. Stark comparisons between mother and daughter, and mother and son make this movie a thought provoking enjoyable exercise in humanity and love.

31697,5,0780621638,"This movie jolted the core of my emotions, in that it was so human that it would be impossible for anyone not to feel a reaction to the story. The people were as real as if they were a next door neighbor. Emma Thomson and the role of her mother(the guest), played by her real life mother,Phyllida Law, who is an older version of Emma, were so real in their parts, that I found myself cringing at times as they interacted with one another.

The stress of Emma's grief over the recent death of her artist photographer husband of seventeen years, was the focal point around which her mother was centered. Fearing that her daughter, Frances might be suffering a relapse of a nervous breakdown, she bundled herself up in an ancient mink coat and a pair of old, scuffed boots and walked for miles to get to the ocean side home. To the rescue, she thought, but also for a much deeper reason than that..she needed to feel needed.

Her unannounced visit was met with a cold welcome, as Frances locked herself in the bathroom and refused to face her mother.

The day wore on in fits and starts as these two strong minded, very similar women, sparred back and forth with each others emotions, wringing similar feelings from the viewer, many of which were downright uncomfortable.

The film was spattered with strong language made more jolting, as it came from the mouths of children..but it only seemed to add to the discomfort being felt and added to the spicy mixture of the whole thing.

I hated it but I was very glad I watched, and if you have a penchant for this kind of roller coaster ride, I think you will feel the same. I thought of the old Hallmark Hall of Fame, hour long television show, where we sat, riveted to the screen, totally embroiled in the characters lives, unable to move for fear that something most necessary to the plot would be lost.

The whole movie was played out in one small area, during a very bad cold snap, and one could feel the icy chill as if one were actually there with them. Two neighbor ladies, on their way to a funeral, added some spice to the whole thing.

Bundle up under a warm blanket and be prepared to be mesmerized..Emma and Phyllida absolutely shine.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Winter-Guest/dp/B0009VNBM4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Winter Guest</a>",1318550400,2,2339,4.760493827160494

Some films will have Actors saying and doing things that aren't quite matched up to the talents of the Actors.  That isn't the case here.  The on-screen talent, as well as the off-screen participants are perfect in what they contribute to the finished product.

The story was one of heart-breaking happiness (like that combination?). One minute delving  into the morbid truths found in relationships only to fade into quiet, loving moments between Mother and Daughter.  In this particular story, the relationship between Mother and Daughter is the strongest plotline.  The settings are perfect for the icy cold relationship shared by these characters, until a breeze of warming air comes into play.

Do they solve the world's problems in this film?  Not a chance, but watching this film can give you a glint of hope for positive relationships and better days.

31717,3,0780621638,"I'm not really sure what attracted me to this film, but once I started watching it I couldn't stop.  Perhaps it was the dreariness of the setting, or the obnoxiousness of the dialog, but I guess the main reason I watched was to see if a plot ever realy developed.  I kept hoping that something of significance would eventually happen, but it really never did.

The characters are quirky and shallow.  You don't know much more about them than when the film began.  The older mother kept asking her adult daughter if she would be moving to Australia.  To me it was a simple yes/no question, but the daughter couldn't come out and give a yes or a no.  The two elderly women heading to a out of town funeral don't do much to carry the stroy, either.  The young man and woman have their moments, but they, too don't add much to the story.  The two young boys who skipped school have the most involved conversation, though it becomes tedious in its own right.

In the end, nothing really jumped out at me and said this was something that warranted the time I spent watching it.  If you like boring quirky movies then this should appeal to you.  If you want to see characters develop and move through some type of conflict to a resolution, then look somewhere else.",1223251200,,1258,4.421739130434783
31718,5,0780621638,"""Come in from the cold"" the tagline to 1997's The Winter Guest invites us, and viewers who accept this faint beckoning soon look on as the cast of this unique production from Scotland does just that in one singularly metaphorical fashion or another. This is a quiet movie that says little with the spoken word and yet still tells one of the most poignantly rich stories ever committed to film. The Winter Guest takes place all in one frozen winter day in a town in rural Scotland, and brings four intertwined vignettes together as it imparts its barely whispered and unforgettable tales. There is a grieving young widow's resistance to her mother's attempts to brings her out of her deep depression; there are two boys who skip school and retreat to the frozen seashore to hide out for the day in this the last winter of their already fleeting childhood; there are two elderly ladies who bravely stare back at death by traveling to funerals of people barely known to them; and there is an eccentric girl, Nita, who forces a boy she fancies---Alex, the son of the widow, Frances, played by Emma Thompson---to finally take notice of her via a playfully serious confrontation amid the ice-covered streets of the little town they share. The Winter Guest would simply never have been made in America, nor could it have been. It is a story that requires patience, sensitivity and insight into the human condition, and for the investment of all of these, returns the sort of intelligently psychological motion picture that is all but extinct in this decade.",1196812800,2,1550,4.787313432835821
31719,5,0780621638,"World famous actor Alan Rickman cowrote and directed this sleepy little gem of a film. As seen in lives of four pairings of people on a single cold winter's day in Scotland, musings and observations about life from the cradle to the grave and the necessity for connection through it all are explored. The screenplay is adapted from a play which is quite obvious in watching this character-rich drama,touched with sincerity and sagacity, sometimes beyond it's years.

The first coupling of people is an elderly mother and recently widowed daughter; the second, two spinsterly ladies; third, a teenage boy and the new girl in town; and lastly two pubescent boy chums playing hooky from school. Each coupling is given ample weight and time to ruminate on life, it's meaning, it's hopes and it's dreams,it's ending and the need for human (and even animal) companionship. The acting is absolutely superb and is a must see for fans of the live theatre who enjoy low action, heavy dialogue and thought prevoking entertainment. What is most impressive about this film is the deliberate pacing and weight given to each word and  action very much like a play. Every moment counts in this film. Nothing is a throwaway. The scenery is intentionally cold and bleak and the lack of warm colours throughout most of the film serve to heighten the angst  greatly.

WINTER GUEST is an incredibly intimate film and will probably be enjoyed and savoured most either alone or with a special someone. Settle in with this film as it is a rare piece of art!

Michael Kamen's soundtrack of piano and light orchestra is positively inspired to underscore the intensity of this dramatic masterpiece. This set this film apart from just being a play on film along with the cinematography of genius Seamus McGarvey who contrasts the vastness of the frozen sea with the closeup of the human face.....really first class!!!

The principal characters, a widow and her aged mother, areplayed beautifully and realistically by real-life daughter and mothers acctresses, Oscar-winner Emma Tompson and Phyllida Law. Their interactions seem such honestand believable portrayals of the uneasy and sometimes brittle relationships between adult women and their mothers. These arecharacters the viewer cannot help but care for and want to protect.

My favoriteother character set were two elderly villageladies whose lives have come to focus on the funerals they attend. These crusty oldsters obviously share a friendship of many decades, and their story is heartwrenching.

31736,5,0780621638,"""The Winter Guest"" is Alan Rickman's first film as a director, and what a film it is. Having directed it first in the West End, he makes the transition to film with remarkable ease.

Masterfully acted by his dear friends Emma Thompson and her real-life mum, Phyllida Law as the titular ""Guest"" (the literal guest--the metaphorical ""guest"" is the unknown/death/the next stage of growth). She's a rather unwelcome visitor to her grieving daughter's home--having just lost her husband to death she just wants to be left alone. Rickman does something which is becoming rarer and rarer amongst directors: he reveals the characters rather than trying to dazzle us with ""aren't I a genius first-time-director"" trickery designed to call attention to him, rather than to  his story.  He does this by using simple, quiet but absolutely exquisite cinematography (by Seamus McGarvey) to capture the wild beauty of the far north of Scotland in the dead of a harsh but beautiful winter, creating almost moonscapes; he allows his actors to work within long takes so that they can fully immerse themselves in their scenes; he artfully intercuts between characters' gestures so as to create a psychological connection that is subtle but significant and is seen first as the approaching Elspeth [Law] slips and grabs a metal handrail, then he cuts to Frances [Thompson] grabbing her metal bed frame as she turns sleeping--this is a Nicolas Roeg technique which serves to wordlessly communicate the connection between the two and is a great example of the uniqueness of the language of cinema, and of how a full grasp of that language deepens a film immeasurably--and very importantly, like the great German director Werner Herzog, he is unafraid of silence and allows it to take us into the center of the film. The simple and non-intrusive score is by the late, great Michael Kamen (who is sorely missed), and is mostly comprised of ""incidental"" music--songs occuring naturally as someone plays the piano or sings a traditional song. This has the effect of creating atmosphere and the sense that this is life, not a movie. That a first time director should have been able to do all of this without fear of being ""unfashionably"" non-showy is quite remarkable; from the first frame it was clear that he has it in him to become a director of note, should he choose to follow that path. That two such great British actresses trusted him fully was a great vote of confidence (Law had played this role in The West End play which preceded the film, as several of the other actors involved in the film had, as well).

Adapted by Rickman and Sharman MacDonald from her play, which Rickman was involved in from the start, the story is actually comprised of four inter-woven stories, four pairs of people, each of whom are in the midst of some sort of existential struggle (do not mistake this for pretension); the action takes place all in one day, during which all of the characters have come to some sort of internal crisis; the film is about the negotiating each of them do through these deep changes, all of which touch on death in one way or another. All good stories are about just that--the moments when someone is forced to turn, to make choices, to move through a difficulty with grace, making space for the needs of others without relinquishing one's own needs. This is big content to manage within a single day, but Rickman intercuts between these four conflicted pairs seamlessly, giving each of them his full attention. The day itself is remarkable--so cold is it that everything is covered deep in snow and the sea has actually frozen, a rare occurrence.

The main pair is mother Elspeth and daughter Frances. Frances is buried so deep in isolated mourning for her dead husband that her mother fears for both her and for her grandson. Apparently the marriage between Frances and her husband was so intense that it nearly excluded the son in the first place, which Elspeth is still distressed about. Frances, a professional photographer, photographed the stages of her husband's deterioration, and her home is filled with images of him in varying degrees of health and increasing illness.  He haunts the house, his widow, his son, the film. Elspeth feels that by photographing this protracted death, Frances has also disappeared into a form of living death, and so she tries to take Frances out of herself  by coaxing her to join her in a long walk with her camera in hand.

As irritating as Frances finds her mother's intrusion into her solitude, she also worries about her increasing weakness as she moves farther into old age. This irritation is expressed one minute when Frances covers her ears as Elspeth relates a long story, her concern revealed a few moments later when her mother's sudden silence sparks concern, and the turning off all the faucets and listening intently, calling anxiously for her mother until she begins to speak again. They bicker--both are witty, funny, acidic, and able to hit bulls-eye's every time they take aim, then share deeply loving moments, and later, as they walk together, Frances begins to see her mother as an individual, rather than the irritating fuss-budget she usually reduces her to. (An aside--this is the moment all mothers await--the dawning upon their daughters that they are not just ""Mother"" but an actual, whole person who exists in 3-d and is as complex and worthy of respect as her daughter is, and finally gets that respect from her daughter--many stories are about this subject alone so lost is the notion of respect for one's mother--and many mothers both in stories and in life wait a long time for this pivotal, life-changing moment.) It is wonderful to see that process unfold here. The issues of being needed and of needing are addressed directly, and it seems as though Elspeth has wanted to talk about the subject for some time, but has felt unable to do so because of Frances' emotional and physical distance (she and her son have been in Australia on extended holiday after her husband's death, and Elspeth has been afraid they'd not return). According to the interview on the DVD, Rickman commissioned the project when he was at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre with the great actress Lindsay Duncan, whose mother was at that time suffering from the stage of Alzheimer's when one is both amusing and exasperating, and so he asked Lindsay and Sharman to talk and then Sharman wrote the play. We see in the film that combination of love and frustration between the mother and daughter, and how each has to make room for the changes in the relationship that occur when the mother begins to need the daughter, and the daughter has to come to terms with both that and her own need--however annoying it may be, one never quite stops needing one's mother.

The second pair is Frances' son Alex (Gary Hollywood), and Nita (Arlene Cockburn), a neighborhood girl who has had an eye on him and who chooses today to take a shot at flirtation. She is a strong, self-sufficient young woman whose boyish looks have made her unsure of her femininity and subsequently rather belligerent in compensation. It is this combination of power and hidden vulnerability that draws Alex to her. From the house, Elspeth watches them through a telescope, looks into the girl's eager, open face and says, ""You be careful, Alex--it wants, that face--give her the moon, she'd want the stars as well..."" She then goes on to admit to herself that she always ""wanted"" and ""wants"" still, dispelling the myth that with age comes a sort of numbness to such normal things as desire. Alex, who is worried terribly about his mother and haunted by his father's death, is not at first very receptive to Nita's attempts at contact, but eventually succumbs to her teasing and flirting, and finally brings the girl home to the unexpectedly abandoned house. A poorly-timed confrontation with yet another photograph of his father breaks him down, and he is able to reveal the depth of his emotional turmoil, and for all Nita's previous indications of selfishness, she is able to receive and hold it, and some sort of healing begins for him.

The third pair, an elderly couple of women--Lily and Chloe (played respectively by Sheila Reid and Sandra Voe)--who seem to have outlived all their friends and neighbors, spend their time in going to funerals, making a day's outing of each one, complete with tea and cakes.  It's not possible to describe here how their experience plays out with such depth and significance, but that it does is an example of how Alan Rickman has brought even this subtle piece of the story fully to life, making these women real and powerfully empathetic. When Chloe's crisis comes, we feel the strength of Lily's support and are moved.

Our final pair is two young boys who have skipped school for the day. Sam (Douglas Murphy) and his best friend Tom (Sean Biggerstaff, later of the Harry Potter movies) are at that fragile age when boys are on the brink of manhood and struggling to understand who they are and how they fit. They are sweet and tender (a moment shared between Tom and the newly shorn Frances, when he asks to touch her short, prickly hair, is so filled with emotion it moves the hard-shelled Frances to tears), obnoxious and argumentative--all the things boys at about 12 are.  They are concerned with the problems of burgeoning sexuality, relationships with family members, their futures, and then, unexpectedly, with the lives of a couple of tiny, abandoned kittens whom they rescue and care for lovingly as they sit on the frozen shore, staring out onto the frozen sea. The above mentioned encounter between Frances and her mother and the momentariliy alone Tom is a wonderful one which reveals much about all three characters. All of the duos bump into one another at one time or another, some briefly, some with greater impact, but this one most of all.  It is impossible not to love these boys who,in that moment between boyhood and manhood, are as frozen as is the sea, and we want to hold them there, as safely as they hold their kittens, and not let them go into the uncertain future.

It is not an accident that this day of days is one on which even the salt sea has freezed up. ""Once before I've seen the sea frozen, just the once, long, long ago,"" says Chloe to her friend, Lily. ""What a day that was."" I, too, spent a day with my sister long ago on the coast of New England when the sea had frozen, and indeed, what a day that was. There's something that stuns one when this always-moving, ever-changing, rising and falling tidal body of water suddenly becomes solid and fixed in time and space. The day feels incredibly significant, even if nothing in particular is happening, because normal laws of nature seem suspended--everything is heightened and magical. I still remember every moment of that day with my sister on the beach, speaking in hushed and awed voices, and that memory deepens my own understanding of why the writer made this story occur on such a day. The sea's stasis mirrors that of the psyches of each of the characters in the story, all of whom are frozen in some moment they cannot seem to get past. That they each have made some real movement by the end of the film is very much the point--this frozen day creates quiet crises in each character which they must overcome, and the writer helps them through this process by pairing each one up. They're helped through their frozen states into some beginning of action towards their futures by one another. But the future is misty, impossible to know; it requires walking with trust into the unknown, and Rickman illustrates this beautifully at the end in a way which I will not give away here. The introspective, contemplative mood is maintained throughout the final titles, which I would recommend sitting through in order to hear the beautiful voice of Elizabeth Fraser (Cocteau Twins) singing ""Take me With You.""

""The Winter Guest"" is that rare thing--a beautiful, quiet, understated film that moves you, makes you feel both the joy and sadness that comes with being human, and most of all offers the great gifts of faith in friendship, trust, and in the power of love to transform life even when life is hard, when you're stuck in your own personal mess with no visible way out, and need another to take your arm, hold you up and see you through, and are wise enough to realize it. I cannot recommend it enough.",1125532800,117,12447,4.779637377963738
31737,5,0780621638,"Four sets of characters represent life's span. The time is Winter; weather, sea, and lives are frozen. Two mothers cope with loneliness. The older faces aging and infirmities, while her daughter wakes to widowhood, her husband having just died.  Two children, schoolboys, worry about puberty and breaking away from mothers; two crones, ride busses to funerals, helping the deceased to be ""re-membered""; two adolescents discover Eros, with its complications.  The dialogue is short and staccato. The pairs assault each other like domestic couples cooped indoors too long.  The Scottish brogue is cold and sharp as the ice and stone in the landscape.

The breathtaking beauty of the photography, set in a Scottish coastal village on the North Sea, features light on ice, rock, and snow. The frozen firth is an ice sculpture, blanketed in fog.  In a stone sewer, the boys find two living kittens discarded in a box.  The mother gropes along a rock wall and slips on cold steps; the adolescents tumble in snow and throw snowballs to attract attention.

Life and warmth are hidden under blankets and clothing. The characters bundle in coats; one wraps herself in a curtain drapery; and the rescued kittens are concealed in the boys' warm jackets.  There is trouble with the furnace, so even the house is cold, but warm water penetrates the cold.  Two characters take hot baths; feet are washed in a warm-water basin.

Miraculously, light and love penetrate each of these lives.  There are more kinds of love than the male-female love of the widow for her husband or the young girl for the redheaded youth.  The two mothers reaffirm love and need for each other as the younger decides to renovate her house, rather than flee to Australia. The most troubled schoolboy discovers he can walk into the unknown with his wee, miracle-of-life kitten in his jacket front.  Unknown to him, his faithful pal is right behind, with the other kitten near his breast. The crones take pleasure in eating sweetmeats after a funeral (Mikhail Bakhtin's observation about a carnivalesque aspect of funeral rituals).  One crone vows to take care of the other and they hobble along their ministry keeping the spirits of the departed alive.

The secret of this radiant film, the restrained action, and constricted dialogue, will be missed by most in the audience.  Only adepts will get the meaning hidden in jackets and coats, like shoots and bulbs under snow.  The winter guest is not the teenage girl visiting a boy whose mother is out, nor the chirping mother intruding on her widowed daughter.  The date February; it must be February 2nd.  The film is a Scottish ""Groundhog's Day"" movie. Without anyone knowing, or doing anything, the darkest quarter of the year slipped away and the spring quarter arrived.

The ocean has frozen as far as the eye can see, and the forbidding landscape and dreadful cold affect everyone. We meet a mother and daughter (well-played by Phyllida Law and her real-life daughter, Emma Thompson) who cannot get along, a teenage couple, two elderly ladies who spend their days attending strangers' funerals, and two boys who are taking a day off from school. On the surface, nothing much happens to these people, but actually, the simple drama of their everyday hopes and fears is absolutely riveting. It takes a while to get started, but by the end (especially the poignant song over the end credits) you'll want to hit rewind and see it again.

31741,5,0780621638,"With Alan Rickman's commitment in playing Professor Snape in the Harry Potter movies, it's doubtful he will ever return to the director's chair to deliver a memorable movie such as this.
At a Scottish coastal town facing the North Sea, the sea has frozen over so that it's like a wonderland, with an endless horizon.  The discovery of new horizons in the experience of life is key to The Winter Guest.
Four dual relationships are examined here.  The first is that between Frances and her mother.  Frances (Emma Thompson) is a recently widowed photographer who lives in a studio flat with her young son.  Her mother (Thompson's real-life mother Phyllida Law), has walked all the way from her house, minus her walking stick, to break the defensive barrier Frances has erected.  The mother keeps chatting on, fixing the bed, but Frances at first spends time avoiding her in the bathroom.
The confrontation is much on the mother trying to get Frances to live again, to become full of life.  As she tells her daughter on some photographs, ""Why not use colour?  The world's in colour.""  And why photograph buildings instead of people?  The mother is more in colour and livelier than the death that has gutted Frances of any feeling of life.  She firmly believes that ""it's the kingdom of youth we're living in"" in response to Frances's defeatist talk of embracing the years and welcoming instead of fighting them.  She wants the best for her daughter and if it takes being emotionally overbossy, so be it.  ""A happy woman does not ruin her own beauty"", as she believes Frances has done by her haircut.
Alex, Frances's son, has an unexpected encounter with Nita, a dark-haired tomboy who gains his attention.  Nita's more impulsive, daring Alex to walk on the ice, and Alex is more cautious, perhaps living under the gloomy shadow of his father's death and the aura of his mother.  Alex's grandmother espies the two from the flat and while seeing the encounter as normal, all the same speaks to herself.  ""Be careful.  It wants that face.  Give her the moon, she'll want the stars as well.""  Fortunately, Nita isn't that way at all.
The thin bespectacled Lily and fat Chloe are two elderly women who keep themselves occupied attending funerals to the point of looking through the paper and jotting them down on appointment books.  Chloe, though seemingly dotty, proves to be the more lively and stronger of the two, literally on the bus and metaphorically having the window seat.  Yet they wonder about today's ways.  ""There's nothing like watching a coffin slip down to the earth and the soil thudding down.""  They question cremations and how that squares with conservation and ecology.
Tom and Sam are two truant youngsters in their early teens and they hang out on the shore talking about things.  The red-haired Sam is shorter but is more in tune, more aware of things than his taller friend.  He has hopes for a future, whereas Tom feels hopeless, resigned to a fate of pushing carts at a food mart.  There's little to do other than go to school and be at home and obey one's parents, and what's it all for, wonders Tom?
Of the pairs, it's clear who emerges as the stronger and braver of the two.  However, one of them turns out to embrace that spirit of hope and possibility, surprising the ostensibly more assertive one.  All the pairs work wonderfully together in this slow-paced drama.
The Scottish coast town is bleak yet wonderful, a place I'd like to visit or even live in one day.  The setting appears to be in Fife County, separated from Edinburgh by the Firth of Forth.  Michael Kamen's haunting piano score, most of it in a higher octave, matches that bleak and wonderful tone, as does the closing song ""Take Me With You"" by Elizabeth Fraser.
It all comes down to that certain strong and loving someone saying, as Lily tells Chloe, ""You will not fall while I'm here.""",1062028800,5,3876,4.70919881305638

31743,5,0780621638,"When the Independent Film Channel airs a movie repeatedly, watch it. IFC is, with PBS, one of the few remaining bastions of quality programming on TV.
So, I watched this film. What struck me was the fact that the unremarkable quality of this film works in its favor. There is nothing startling about the structure of the film: It is an episodic mood piece. The acting is silently brilliant but doesn't jar one out of the alternately pleasant and unpleasant dream the movie induces. Overall, it's apparently nothing special.
Which is why I loved it. It's a familiar movie, comforting at times, with a commensurate ability to bring tears. The different episodes are well put together, well acted, have touching and applicable messages, and don't make a spasmodic mess of the movie. The cinematographer knew his stuff.
The different plotlines illustrate certain lessons. The two old women on their mishap-prone way to a funeral are perfect models of true friendship and an inability to accept the encroachments of age. When one of the ladies steadies her woozy associate, a theme of friendship through adversity and pain is evoked. This theme is even more beautifully treated in the vignettes of the boys playing hooky. The boys are avatars of youthful potential which might be misspent. The compassion in the boy's spirits, though, is every bit as moving as the compassion the filmmaker had for the boys. The main storylines in which Frances and her mother have an outing brings sharp focus on issues such as family love, mourning, and the generational communication barrier. Holding all these stories together is a deep, melancholic sense of Scotland's chill landscape and the impositions it makes on its citizens. Here the issue of expatriation and the need to escape the familiar is picked up, as well as in Frances' idea of moving to Australia.
When I said there's nothing remarkable here, I'm perhaps being unfair. After all, the most beautiful thing about this film is the fact that the deft blend of pathos and humor seems so hackneyed and oldhat, while it is actually a poignant and outstanding film. After all, what could be more beautiful than a movie in which the ingredients for derivative melodrama are whipped up into a stunning if familiar tear-jerker? By the bye, if movies such as this are the paradigm, the word ""tearjerker"" is by no means negative.",1026864000,6,2365,4.9298245614035086
31744,5,0780621638,"When you break it down, life comes in stages; not just stages of development, but stages that can last for a moment, an hour, a day-- or indefinitely.  And they come unbidden and unannounced, like an uninvited guest that drops by and burrows into your very soul to ferret out the deepest hopes, dreams, needs and desires which-- consciously or subconsciously-- are a part of everyone who draws a breath upon the planet.  In spring, that guest may bring the joy of rebirth and life; in winter, it may bring a reflection of need and confusion, a feeling of loneliness and loss, the desperation of uncertainty or even despair, all born in that seemingly endless moment of searching and seeking out that elusive and intangible something that lies ahead, just out of reach.  The winter guest you can neither refuse nor turn away that is desolation of spirit; a visitor to whom we are introduced in ""The Winter Guest,"" directed by Alan Rickman.
 It's an especially cold February in a small village on the coast of Scotland; even the ocean is frozen for as far as the eye can see.  And in the harsh wind that blows in from that frozen sea, we find Frances (Emma Thompson), a woman who has lost her husband, and visited by the winter of indecision is held fast in her confusion, unable to move on with her life.  There to help her find the warmth of spring is Elspeth (Phyllida Law), her mother, who needs Frances as much as Frances needs her, though neither can find a way to break through the chill that has engulfed their souls.  Then there is Alex (Gary Hollywood), Frances's son, still in school, but on the brink of maturity awaiting on the other side of his own winter, a taste of which he samples in the form of Nita (Arlene Cockburn), a local girl who takes a fancy to him.
 Before it's through, the winter guest will visit others, as well; those in every stage of life.  At one end of the spectrum are Lily and Chloe (Sheila Reid and Sandra Voe), elderly friends who seem to stave off the inevitable by attending funerals.  At the other end are Sam and Tom (Douglas Murphy and Sean Biggerstaff), boys on the cusp of adolescence, who during their visit will learn that being of a like age does not put them at the same stage of life.  And as the story unfolds, in each relationship a different stage of life is revealed and examined, and we see the effects of this winter guest on each.
 Written by Rickman and Sharman Macdonald (adapted from Macdonald's play), this film is a study in contrasts, a pensive portraiture of life; sparse and reflective, Rickman captures in it the human condition at it's most fragile, and therein finds beauty.  He uses the original music (written and performed by Michael Kamen) sparingly, opting instead for the sound of the wind, the cry of the gulls overhead or just a backdrop of silence to underscore the dialogue and the drama of the story, all to great effectiveness.  By so doing, he allows the drama to speak for itself, to play out thoughtfully and in such a way that the audience is drawn in and included, very reminiscent of Ingmar Bergman's style, though perhaps a bit more wistful at times.  And Rickman allows so many wonderfully telling moments in this film:  The young boy, Tom, looking out at the vast frozen ocean that seemingly extends on and on forever, as if he is looking out upon his own life, which even now is extending on ahead of him, forever; or Frances, looking out upon that same ocean, a frozen sea reaching out into the unknown, even as her own life is moving on toward an unknown destination; Sam, the same age as Tom, yet younger, watching from the shore, not yet ready and therefore unable to follow as Tom ventures out into the mists that cover the frozen waters.  And there's more:  Alex and Nita embracing their passion; Chloe, falling and grabbing hold of a railing for support, then finally reaching out to Lily; Elspeth and Tom, sitting together on a rock and sharing a moment at the shore; Frances taking Elspeth by the arm and helping her.  All moments that are profound in their simplicity, and all wonderfully presented by Rickman, with not only the eye, but the heart, of a true artist.
 Phyllida Law gives an especially engaging performance as Elspeth, as does Voe as Chloe; and Biggerstaff and Murphy are a delight to watch as Tom and Sam.  But the lovely Emma Thompson steals the show as Frances, with a superb, introspective and reserved performance that is entirely captivating.  She successfully conveys that deepest yearning that so readily identifies the winter into which Frances has entered in her soul, and her scenes with Law (her real life mother) are a subtle expression of reality, and a joy to behold.  But again, it's the prolonged moments of silence--created and staged so well by Rickman-- that are beguiling, and say so much about who Frances really is.  it's such a treat to find a film in which the director is wise enough and so willing to allow enough time for his performer to do what she does best-- as Rickman did with Thompson here-- the positive impact of which is certainly evident in the depth of Thompson's portrayal of Frances.
 The supporting cast includes Tom Watson (Minister) and Alan Rickman (Man in the Street).  Rickman found beauty in the bleak, frozen landscape of that small, Scottish village, then translated it so well into a representation of those troubling and disorienting transitional periods that can visit us at any given stage of our lives.  And, combined with his artistic eye and insight into human nature, it makes ""The Winter Guest"" a film to be embraced and cherished.  It's an experience you'll long remember.",1012435200,15,5648,4.643574297188755

Afterwards, as was our habit, we settled down over a cappuccino and a dolce, and pieced together what each of us had perceived. As I recall, we got into an intense discussion of the film as a vivid metaphor for deatheach of the couples being preoccupied with endings: the mother trying to bring the daughter back to reality after the death of her husband; the raven-haired young girl in her striking black and red silk robe; the two old ladies taking the bus to funerals; the two boys lost in the icy mists swirling around the desolate rockseach of them unwelcome guests in the winteror did we have the metaphor reversed?

Well, the next day, we went to see the same film at the Pasquino Theatre, where they showed the film in the original language. The film was as excellent as before, but our musings about the profound funerary significance of the film proved to be strangely absent from the English dialogue (except for the two old ladies taking the bus in the dead of winter to a stranger's funeral).

Nevertheless, I am happy to have seen ""The Winter Guest"" first in Italian, because only half-understanding the dialogue allowed us to appreciate the stunning cinematography and production design as well as the outstanding performances in a way that we might not have, if we had been focusing on the English dialogue.

I was also later gratified to read that the topic of death figured in Roger Ebert's review, so our academic analysis wasn't completely off the wall.

In any language, ""The Winter Guest"" is a stunning film, and I am happy that I have it in my library, so I can revisit that desolate winter landscape.",1452902400,3,1884,4.662650602409639
