8516929,3,B002S56LF8,"This movie could be used as background for a gathering of some kind, perhaps a cocktail party.  The images on screen are nice winter scenes and the music is nice Christmas music.  I expected a story plot and there is none in this film.  It's just nice winter scenes shown over music.  Not what I expected.",1262995200,,305,4.392857142857143
8516930,5,B002S56LF8,This is a very beautiful DVD filled with gorgeous images of the Berkshires of Western Massachusetts during Christmas time. Christmas songs play wonderfully in the background as the snow falls. It also has a nice feature where it's on continuous play so it replays over and over. I think this will become a tradition to have this playing in the background during the Christmas season.,1255651200,3,383,4.907692307692308
