If you can't explain this you have no business making a video about our founding document. Besides, too much time is spent on personal opinion and trying to prove that the founding Fathers weren't as great as history makes them out to be. The point isn't how ""great"" they were or weren't, they were ordinary men that did Extraordinary things! SMH!",1486080000,,508,4.719101123595506

This entre dvd series clips right along in top-quality TV documentary fashion. It will remind older viewers of their school days when the constitution and the balance of governmental powers were routinely taught. It will interest people from about ten to ninety years of age. It will start or refresh your knowledge of our form of government and it will build or restore your confidence in it ... not in this administration or that administration but in a government that has spanned the lives of all our administrations.

This disk tells a short story of the writing of our constitution, including some facts that will surprise most viewers. It tells the story of the simple man who changed our Constitution. How he acted without the aid of an attorney, to ultimately gain every person accused of a crime the right to have an attorney provided.

Sit and watch it with your kids. It will lead to meaningful discussion. Something another vampire movie might not accomplish!",1254355200,3,1132,5.01595744680851
