8652563,5,B00JNWDA3K,"I was there at the 47 near the beginning, so at times this felt like a home movie of my family. I loved being reminded of how innocent and idealistic and passionate we were, and how great that music was and is. And how special an institution the Club 47 was. It was great to hear from many of the players today as they looked back at their experiences there, and at the ups and downs of keeping the place afloat. I'm so glad this important piece of American musical history has been kept alive in the movie.",1503878400,,507,4.183673469387755

8652570,5,B00JNWDA3K,"A well-made documentary. I was impressed with the live TV B&W footage of Tom Rush early in his career and the Jim Kweskin Jug Band. My brother, Stephen Bruton, played guitar with many of the people interviewed. A Cowtown Hello to Betsy Siggins-Schmidt if she happens to see this....",1422316800,7,282,4.775510204081633
