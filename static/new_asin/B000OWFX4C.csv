6069996,3,B000OWFX4C,Interesting and spooky,1428537600,,22,6.666666666666667
6069997,4,B000OWFX4C,Very interesting. Fascinating accounts.  I would recommend this to anyone who is curious about paranormal activity.  Would of enjoyed it more if the photographic evidence had been left on screen longer.  To allow more than few seconds study.  At times it was difficult to understand dialog over the music.,1428192000,,305,5.163265306122449
6069998,5,B000OWFX4C,"I had seen this documentary on TV years ago and always wanted a copy of it. I was happy to find it here and I think its one of the best shows on the most eerie hauntings in California. If anyone's interested in ghosts, this would be a DVD to get.",1274572800,5,246,3.843137254901961
6069999,5,B000OWFX4C,"The Alcatraz ghost photos, during the San Francisco segment, comes from a ghost investigator that has traveled the California coast in search of paranormal activity in San Diego, Long Beach, San Jose and San Francisco. I highly recommend this video for people in seach of true evidence of paranormal hotspots in California!",1190332800,7,323,5.230769230769231

6070004,1,B000OWFX4C,could be more suspense filled. Not enough support history,1439337600,,57,5.444444444444445
6070005,1,B000OWFX4C,I think I will go and get all of my teeth pulled.  It would be much more entertaining than California's Most Haunted.  Poor story telling and low quality production are just the beginning.  I could not force myself to sit through the whole thing.,1439078400,,246,4.545454545454546

6070018,4,B000OWFX4C,"This was quite an enjoyable documentary on some of California's most notable Ghost Stories.  In an hour they cover stories from The Whaley House in San Diego to the ""real life"" story of a Culver City woman which inspired the Best Selling Book and movie, The Entity. Even more enjoyable in the telling of the stories was ""actual"" footage and photographs. If you find yourself up late on a stormy night and feel like hearing a couple ghost stories then this would be the film for you.",1433376000,2,482,4.540229885057471

6070021,4,B000OWFX4C,"Yea, the film is dated, but it's really interesting.  The stories I've heard about before, but the Entity one still creeps me out.  Well worth your time to watch!",1431388800,,162,4.551724137931035
6070022,4,B000OWFX4C,Worth buying for your personal collection,1431302400,,41,6.0
6070023,2,B000OWFX4C,Horrible quality! It was copied from a VHS and you can even see the tape scramble lines appear from time to time. Very low production quality. I did not finish watching it. 2 stars for the effort.,1431129600,,196,4.324324324324325
6070024,5,B000OWFX4C,"Ghosts ready for their close-up are in abundance here. Another page turner in the large collection of ghost stories this from California. Surprising how there isn't more film evidence? But, don't over think. Best to imagine telling ghost stories under the palm trees at night or at the beach near a bonfire and enjoy the fun and page turning.",1430956800,,342,4.813559322033898
6070025,1,B000OWFX4C,Not so good,1430611200,,11,3.0
6070026,3,B000OWFX4C,This film is very dated.  It is o.k.  There are a lot of shows now about the paranormal that are more interesting.,1430438400,,114,4.136363636363637
6070027,5,B000OWFX4C,very interesting movie fun to watch,1429920000,,35,5.0
6070028,3,B000OWFX4C,Informative but nothing special as haunted documentaries go.,1429660800,,60,6.625

8622022,1,B000OWFX4C,It has the quality of a movie made in the 80's. Very monotone narrator and not scary. Would not recommend,1447632000,,105,4.3

8622028,1,B000OWFX4C,Old and kinda cheesy,1446076800,,20,4.25
8622029,4,B000OWFX4C,"Kind of herky jerky and sensationalized....but, I guess when you're dealing with an entity that doesn't want to be discovered or exploited, they had to overplay the little bits that they were able to catch.",1445904000,,206,4.914285714285715
8622030,1,B000OWFX4C,Silly premise and really over dramatic. Lucky it was free on prime or I would be extremely upset,1445904000,,96,4.388888888888889
