8341579,4,B001TIGFCO,"I have watched many of the Nooma videos, and very much enjoy Rob Bell's messages.  Most of my experience with the Nooma series has been as a student in a young adult study group.  Whirlwind was my first experience leading the discussion to my church's high school Sunday school class.

The message in this video was based on the story of Job, and revolved around the question of ""Why do bad things happen to good people?"".  In this video, I thought that Rob relied to heavily on telling the Bible story, and did not spend as much time with his interpretation. I feel that where Rob Bell excels, is in forming a connection to the audience.  In other videos I have felt that he is able to make you forget you are watching a video, and believe he is talking to you. Although I felt the message he gave was powerful, I didn't feel the connection in this one.

I personally enjoy Rob Bell's speaking style, and even when his message focuses more on a bible story, I feel he is worth listening to.  After the lesson, I asked the kids in my class what they thought, and the reviews were mixed.  Most of the kids who had never seen a Nooma video before thought it was good, but the kids who have seen a few of the other videos, had other favorites.

Conclusion: I think although this is not the best Nooma, I think even the worst Nooma is better than most other small group lessons.  I would recommend this for any fans of the Nooma series.",1317859200,3,1432,4.309701492537314
