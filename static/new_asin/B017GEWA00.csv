8739046,5,B017GEWA00,"I have become a big Ramon Novarro fan, and I really enjoyed this delightful musical romance. Ramon's character actually develops beyond the youthful pleasure seeker at the beginning as the story progresses. The songs, while forgettable, are pleasant, especially when sung by Novarro himself. The sound is pretty good for an early ""talkie.""",1455926400,,339,5.415094339622642
