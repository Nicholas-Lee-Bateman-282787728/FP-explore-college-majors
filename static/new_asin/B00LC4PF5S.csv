8665093,5,B00LC4PF5S,"Five stars and more...deserves this movie. It is history at his best. The
real way live with the occupation of Eastern Europe by Soviet scoundres
was all about.
The cinematography and camera work by director Agnieszka Hollnad is

excellent. Never mind ""made for TV' This production is far ahead of
any inmmaterial and mediocre stuff coming out of Hollwywood faucets
in 2013.
This should be a movie to be shown to the ""sons and daughters of the
millionaire daddies "" that play the dangerous game of the lefty-socialists.
in today's rare and anti-American environment in the Ivy League universities.
Undoubtelly to live under Bolshevism should be the greatest lesson
than these guys and gals will need to get straighten out  and become
once and for all, adults and proud Americans.",1448150400,,779,4.984615384615385

8665095,5,B00LC4PF5S,"This is an interesting three-part series about the communist era in Czechoslovakia.  The pace may be a bit slow for American audiences but it is well worth watching.

It starts with documentary footage from the Soviet invasion of 1968 and the resulting Czech resistance in the streets.  It then goes into the main story which revolves around Jan Palach, a university who burned himself to death in public as a protest to the invasion.

But the main character is a Czech lawyer who specialized in representing dissidents.  Here she saw an opportunity to represent the student's mother on charges that a government minister had defamed the student by remarks made about the incident.  On paper Czech law allowed libel suits to be brought against anyone. But the result was a campaign of soft intimidation brought against the lawyer by Czechoslovakia's system of soft communism.  By this I mean that it was not like Stalinist Russia where people were taken away at night to be shot or sent to a labor camp in Siberia.  It operated somewhat as follows.

After she filed the lawsuit against the minister an unmarked police car from the secret police was always parked in front of her apartment.  This was intimidating but this intimidation went no further.  The judge hearing the case in Prague was reminded that undesirable outlying districts were short of judges and she could be one of the ones reassigned there.

The lawyer's husband who was a doctor suddenly found himself charged with some violation of hospital rules.  Even though the charge was trumped up, dutiful employees corroborated the charges.  While all he got was an official reprimand (the hospital head did his best to protect him) he was disgusted enough to quit the hospital.  Meanwhile the lawyer managed to get some damaging information on the minister.  But the minister's allies were able to bribe one of the lawyer's associates to steal the file and hand it over to them.  Bribes there apparently did not involve money.  It was always something special like a promotion, a desirable assignment, entrance to a university, or some similar favor.

Palach's gravesite had become a rallying point for dissidents so the cemetery managers invoked an obscure rule to secretly remove his body at night and cremate it.  Meanwhile the mother was slipped autopsy photographs showing the state of her son's body.  It should come as no surprise that the judge read the verdict the minister's allies had prepared for her and kept her valued Prague assignment.

The series ends with some documentary footage showing the street demonstrations that led to the fall of the communist government in 1989.  Palach was proclaimed a hero and the lawyer was made minister of justice.",1422835200,8,2729,4.962555066079295
8665096,5,B00LC4PF5S,"A very wonderful film about the abuses of the communist dictatorship in Czechoslovakia after the invasion and occupation of that
country by the Soviet Unin and allies of the Warsaw Pact.  It shows the struggle of decent people against opression and lie.",1418860800,2,253,5.023809523809524
8665097,5,B00LC4PF5S,"Seems to be outstanding acting and period piece costumes and vehicles and street scenes....

But after some struggle I simply could not get the English subtitles so I couldn't understand it.

Has anyone else has this problem?  That all systems on the screen are lined up to go but it just doesn't give subtitles.

Hope it is not the norm!  Is it those Czechs?",1417910400,2,359,4.546875
