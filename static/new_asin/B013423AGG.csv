8726969,2,B013423AGG,"Noel, I adore you but this is just not good...admittedly I didn't get through the whole thing but it felt very scattered and unrehearsed. He apologized to the audience multiple times for jokes that fell flat (part of the act or genuine? Not sure) and couldn't get through his own jokes without giggling. You need the grounding influence of Julian. Boosh movie please!",1501718400,,367,4.841269841269841
8726970,5,B013423AGG,"I recently discovered Noel Fielding, and I have been obsessed ever since.  He is so creative & funny I cannot seem to get enough!  His comedy is unique and refreshing.  I hope Amazon includes more of his shows on Prime in the USA.",1492732800,,230,4.3023255813953485
8726971,5,B013423AGG,"Noel Fielding is genius! His particular style of whimsy and fantastically imaginative humor is in full force here.  He brings along some of his best characters from Luxury Comedy, The Moon from The Mighty Boosh, and introduces a few new ones as well. The bits with Tom Meeton and Micheal Fielding are wonderfully outrageous! A great mix of stand-up (there's nothing standard about his stand-up) and narrative that will keep you grinning and laughing out loud!  A must see for fans of Noel Fielding and/or comedy in general!",1472342400,,523,4.931818181818182

This is an overseas DVD that needs an all region DVD player or a program on your computer that read overseas DVDs to view.

I love The Mighty Boosh.  But, I feel in order to get through this live performance you have to accept that this is not the Boosh and let it stand on its own.  Some people didn't quite like this concert because of that reason but if you keep in your head that this is Noel's night without Julian, you'll enjoy it.  Noel starts off with a stand up routine and then brings in characters to finish off the concert.  There are references to his show ""Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy"" that you probably need to watch before viewing this concert.  But, both seasons of those are only on an overseas dvd also.

Have fun and know that Antonio Banderas is Noel's understudy for this concert...lol.  You'll get it later.",1461369600,2,846,4.483660130718954

8726974,2,B013423AGG,"I absolutely adore the Mighty Boosh & quite enjoy Luxury Comedy, so it was a bit deflating to find 'An Evening with Noel Fielding' mostly tedious. The first leg of the show was so unengaging I almost clicked off, but things perked up a bit when Fielding was joined onstage by actors Michael Fielding and Tom Meeten. Longtime fans may find themselves groaning as Fielding continues his by-now-familiar habit of carefully manufacturing the least opportunity to 'spontaneously' name-drop his friendship with local UK celebrity Russell Brand. Select viewers may enjoy revisiting a few familiar characters and the handful of jokes that really land, but - alas - Fielding's latest offering feels mostly like a patchwork shadow of his former incandescence.",1449100800,2,749,5.25
