8571910,5,B00BODY4YA,Super awesome. it had a dvd concert which runs about 2 hours. a documentary dvd which is about 67 minutes. and the case has the lyrics to the songs written on it in addition to some photos of the band. It arrived a week ahead of schedule and was packaged really well. This helped keep it safe while it traveled from Japan.  I enjoyed watching this and I highly recommend it.,1474416000,,374,4.267605633802817
