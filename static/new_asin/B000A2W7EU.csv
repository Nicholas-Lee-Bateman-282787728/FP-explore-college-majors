8072957,3,B000A2W7EU,"AKA Blue Jeans and Dynamite, Three Way Split, Atraco en la jungla. Robert Vaughn is Tony, an aging jaded stuntman working in Spain, approached by old friend Luis (Simn Andreu) with a scheme to heist a $10 million gold mask from a museum. They are hindered by policemen, girlfriends, and Aztecs.
In 10 word synopsis across the web this film is referred to as an ""actioner"". It's actually a chase or caper film -- a cash poor Ocean's Eleven. Film has a nice low-budget Euro feel to it, with Andreu funny as a debt-ridden playboy, Katia Christine spunky and attractive as Tony's stunt-girl girlfriend, and Vaughn turning in a cold performance as the self serving Tony. Vaughn, a good actor, sort of laughs and eye rolls his way through this one. He smiles and jokes pretty much without letting us and the other actors in on it. He only really comes to life in a scene comparing himself to a great boxer past his prime.
I found ""Double Cross"" a lot more enjoyable than similarly budgeted films of this era. The locales were at turns dingy and beautiful, the filmed moved at a breakneck pace, the supporting roles were well cast, and Neila Moranta as Andreu's inescapable girlfriend (no other film credits) was gorgeous. The editing and sound were problematic. In my copy Robert Vaughn's voice often sounded as if he'd been sucking helium! And in one scene a deep-voiced baritone with a slight accent dubbed Vaughn. The difference was quite noticible. 3 out of 5 stars.",1258761600,,1464,4.700389105058366
