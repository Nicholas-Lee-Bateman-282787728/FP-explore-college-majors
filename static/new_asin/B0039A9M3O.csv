8392032,5,B0039A9M3O,"Just like the title says, if you like Ed Robertson get this DVD. Not only is he hot, talented, funny, interesting, intelligent, and did I mention hot, he is one heck of a nice guy. Are you a BNL fan? What are you waiting for? More Ed, more fun! He  does some singing for the peeps he's working with after he's done so there's the bonus. Did I mention he's smokin' hot?",1363910400,,368,4.111111111111111
8392033,5,B0039A9M3O,You are  going to love this! Very similar and just as funny! Love that Ed can just let it roll off his back when he has a hard time with a job (Tree Planting) or just doesn't know how! Can't wait for the other  seasons and or episodes to appear!!!!,1273795200,,248,3.94
8392034,5,B0039A9M3O,"Ed Robertson is many things: charming, funny and ... not afraid of anything! I just recently discovered this series on the Outdoor Life Network (OLN) and it has quickly become one of my favourite shows. In every episode, Ed flies his plane to a different location without knowing what job awaits him. Hilarity almost always ensues. I CANNOT wait for Season 2 and 3 to come out on DVD!
BUY THIS DVD! You will not regret it!",1273536000,,422,4.4935064935064934
8392035,5,B0039A9M3O,"First off, I live in the US, so we all know this show isn't aired here. Being a huge Barenaked Ladies fan, I decided to buy the DVD. I love this series! Ed takes on the tough challenges by doing a bunch of back-breaking jobs, which are extremely interesting and exciting. Ed also has his hilarious sense of humor throughout the episodes, so there are bright spots to all the hard work he does. Overall, extremely cool series, and if you are a fan of Barenaked Ladies, i think you fill find it interesting to see the wild side of Ed Robertson.",1270684800,3,542,4.323529411764706
