8503005,4,B006QF02JC,Shawn does a good job on this video as he does on his others.,1445040000,,61,3.4285714285714284
8503006,5,B006QF02JC,"This DVD rounded out our West Coast Swing lessons as well as our quiver of WCS moves.  We started with the 101 and worked our way through the other 4.  Advanced 2 really put the icing on the proverbial WCS cake for us.  Shawn is clearly a born teacher as he seems to always know exactly what to say, when to slow down and when to repeat a move.  A beautiful complement to his instruction is his fabulous and funny wife.  She is always brightening up the scene with her great smile and making for an easy to watch and engage lesson.

This DVD specifically added a lot of great style to my leading technique and really helped my wife with her style as well.  The moves covered are certainly the hardest to learn amongst the series but are well worth the occasional rewind.  They break them down step by step as always, but as myself and wife were both blessed with two left feet we did have a bit of a harder time getting them down.  We wouldn't have had it any other way though because if they slowed down their instruction on this DVD it certainly would not have covered as much as it did.

In closing, we did not think we could learn to dance from a DVD untill we first tried one of Shawn's slow dancing DVDs years ago and when we decided to tackle west coast swing we knew where to turn and the Trautman's did not let us down.  I can tell Shawn has also stepped up his tech level because the quality of the DVDs is high def and the music on each of them is perfect for the dance.

Absolutely fantastic, highly recommend!",1398643200,,1522,4.1924398625429555
