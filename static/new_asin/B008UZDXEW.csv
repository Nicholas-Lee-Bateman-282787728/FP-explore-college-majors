5183733,5,B008UZDXEW,"This is absolutely fantastic. I got both movies at a fairly low price. [LARGE SPOILER ALERT, AVOID THIS REVIEW IF YOU DISLIKE SPOILERS] I, however, think that it truly is horrible that Snape is killed. He was by far one of my favorite characters. The movies arrived with no scratches, played easily on my television and on my laptop, and both DVDs could easily be stored in a single case which made its portability quite a lot easier.",1451606400,,434,4.576923076923077
5183734,5,B008UZDXEW,"Gobley of Fire was probably the low point of the Potter film franchise. It was a very tween movie, and everything at that age is just awkward. Anyway, when you can get two great in a twofer, it is always a value, especially since most extras are a joke. Who needs the extra disc. As for which film is the better, I have trouble there. Is Order superior to Half Blood Prince or is it the other way around",1445558400,,403,4.113924050632911

8530706,5,B008UZDXEW,"In ""Order of the Phoenix"", Harry Potter has survived his first encounter with Lord Voldemort, but no one seems to want to believe that the Dark Lord has returned.  Harry finds himself largely isolated in the wizarding community and even at Hogwarts.  Fortunately, best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger are there to buck up Harry.  A crackdown on the actual practice of magic leads Harry to form a secret group of students for training in self-defense.  Their practice is none too soon; Lord Voldemort and his minions will engineer another encounter, with deadly consequences...

The tone of ""Order of the Phoenix"" is noticeably darker than its predecessors.  Of note, even the adults are frightened now, and Harry has a harder time discerning his allies.  On the plus side, the kids have grown into teenagers, and there is a lot of fun in that.  Also on the plus side, Harry and his friends find some new and interesting allies.  Centaurs, thestrals, and giants, anyone? The location shooting in Scotland and London gets better with every movie.  This full-screen edition doesn't have any extras, but it is highly recommended to fans of the series as good fun and excellent entertainment.

""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is the set-up to the ""Deathly Hallows"", the two-part finale of the series.  Lord Voldemort and his minions are slowly closing the ring on Harry and his friends and allies.  Even Hogwarts is no longer safe, as it becomes clear there are traitors within the walls.  Harry and Professor Dumbledore will follow a string of clues in the hunt for an ancient memory that may represent Voldemort's vulnerability.  That trail takes Harry and his allies into some very dark country; not all will survive the journey.  And who is the Half-Blood Prince?

The darkness in this movie is delightfully relieved by the happy fact that our favorite Hogwarts students are now teenagers, and in the full throes of the normal hormonal storm.  Friendships will be tested and new relationships formed.  The odd but goodhearted Luna Lovegood will be a friend in need to Harry.  Ron Weasley's younger sister Ginny comes into her own as a witch and as an ally of the trio.  Ron Weasley will discover the dangers of mixing magic and romance.  Hermione will learn to share what she holds most dear, in unexpected ways.

The special effects and the pacing of ""The Half-Blood Prince"" are excellent.  The location shooting in Scotland is almost distractingly good.  A stream of good actors continue to fill up the screen with good performances.  Very highly recommended to fans of the series.",1485648000,,2600,4.919540229885057
8530707,2,B008UZDXEW,The picture and description say it's the double feature which usually means either both movies on one disc or 2 discs in one package. I received 2 DVD packages which normally i wouldn't be bothered by but one is Wide Screen and one is full screen. Why in 2016 would anyone purposely purchase a full screen DVD?,1482019200,,310,4.456140350877193
8530708,5,B008UZDXEW,good,1481760000,,4,4.0
8530709,1,B008UZDXEW,The picture shows one case two dvds; I received two separate dvds.,1477440000,,66,4.583333333333333
