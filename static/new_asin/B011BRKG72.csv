The Reel Vault transfer is surprisingly atrocious: washed-out whites, night scenes so murky they're blacked out. The sound is garbled in spots but passable. I can't vouch for the Alpha disc, but even given Alpha's generally miserable disc quality it can't be worse than this unwatchable mess. (You Tube versions are comparatively pristine!) The film itself is mild fun, although you could not tell that from the Reel Vault transfer.",1526428800,,446,5.208333333333333
