6109358,5,B00GSTHCHQ,"Previously, a box set of seasons 1 & 2 were available.  The first box set had a few cool extras - the second box I don't believe had any.  The third season was available on ITUNES and HULU and such places (AMAZON AS WELL) as digital only downloads.  The entire series has been circulating around bootleg in crudely cut and shoddy looking VHS style visuals along with every ep having been cut for VIOLENCE and LANGUAGE??????  I don't know where these copies came from but without an official release one was forced to deal with them.  The proper release of the greatest cop show of its time and maybe ALL TIME, all 7 seasons - one would HOPE that they would restore the (PREVIOUSLY ON HILL STREET BLUES) which were absent completely on the previous releases - and maybe, just maybe - we'll finally get the HILL STREET set we've been waiting for for all these years - I'm not going to pretend that this will have interviews with Bochco, Milch, Lewis, Franz, etc - I'm sure it will be bare-bones.  That said - the price is not cheap, so maybe this really will be a lush restoration.  But I'd be quite happy with crystal clear versions of all 7 seasons with the previously-on tags as well.  PRAYING THIS IS REAL!!!!!!

SPOILER ALERT: I will discuss most (not all) of the aspects of the new box set here.  If you want to be surprised, stop reading until after you open the set.  I'm very explicit here as to what is contained in the box.

UPDATE: I now have the 2014 NEW DVD SHOUT FACTORY SET of HILL STREET BLUES: The Complete Series.  Without ""spoilers,"" allow me to say that this is THE REAL THING.  If you've been waiting for a real presentation of this great series for 20/30 years - look no more.  This is a very handsomely housed set of discs comprising all 7 seasons of the great show.  The episodes look almost remastered and new - these appear to be struck from new prints or at the very least, the person who did the transferes clearly cared.  They eps look like a million dollars and it's jarring to see the show look this good again.  The episodes are easy and consise.  Everything is outlined and marked beautifuly and it's a very intuitive set.  That said - there are 4 commentaries - I've not yet heard them nor compared them to the original DVD set of the first 2 seasons, so I don't know if they are carryovers or not.

BURNING QUESTION: Do these contain ""previously on Hill Street Blues?""  The answer is YES.  In some cases as I did a very quick browse, you also get ""and tonight, on Hill Street Blues"" - as for me at that point I just hit the NEXT button which takes you into the top of roll call screen.  These eps have NEVER looked and sounded this good (picture is original TV ratio and sound is an unusually clear 2.0).

BONUS FEATURES:
Again, while I don't want to spoil, the extras are mostly contained to one disc (except the commentaries) and are quite great.  There are a bunch of interviews with actors, writers and other creatives involved in the show (It's a real bounty of extras although I have yet to sit and watch them.  But just to wet your apetite, Dennis Franz does an interview explaining the differences between Buntz and Bennedetto.)

The gag reel is super short and probably could've been included in other material, and I was secretly hoping for commentaries on the final episodes, etc - from the likes of present-day David Milch - there are no later-season commentaries as far as I could tell - just four from the first 2/3 seasons.

At the forefront of the extras is a massive making of HSB documentary (it's in two parts - both run together for over 2 hours I think - all modern (2013) interviews from everyone involved.

To sum up, this is the holy grail and as good as it's going to get.  Every episode presented in a stellar manner and in the best audio/video it's ever been in since broadcast, completely UNCUT (a bunch of renegade bootlegs have been making the rounds that are cut for language and violence - these episodes are completely uncut with all the original music and act breaks.  The bootlegs look like crap recorded from a VCR situation - these are a studio-quality older series reference point on how to present an older show and make it look great.

Again, this is what we've always wanted.  All the ""previously ons, all the uncut eps, and perfect audio/video with a whole disc of amazing and fun and current extras.

Bravo, Shout Factory!  HILL STREET BLUES is alive and better than ever thanks to you!

If you are on the fence about buying these - don't be.  They are NOTHING for the price - all 7 seasons in pristine form with extras in a beautiful sturdy box? The wait is over, justice has been served - HILL

STREET BLUES in all its original and ragged glory.  A perfect A +.

UPDATE: OCTOBER 1, 2014: So after a break, I went ahead and watched seasons 3, 4 & 5.  The transfers are terrific. There seems to be a slight difference in transfer quality betwen the first 3 and 4 & 5, (understandable as the first 3 were slated for release while SHOUT FACTORY supervised the new transfers.) Seasons 4 & 5 seem a bit brighter but again - aged terrific for such an old show.  Great negatives.  As far as the PREVIOUSLY ON debate continues: Season 3 has SOME PREVIOUSLY ON along with a TONIGHT ON - you can also skip directly to roll call.  Season 4 has many PREVIOUSLY ON with a FEW TONIGHT ONs, and season 5 has a LOT of PREVIOUSLY ON HILL STREET BLUES (mostly all missing from seasons 1 & 2 and are a welcome return.)  Season 2 had a couple of interesting commentaries (Bruce Weitz admitted Belker growled way too much in early seasons) but once season 3 hits, no more commentaries to be found.  Still going through - taking a break then on to 6 & 7, when Bochco left and Milch & Lewis took over.  I will do a full, season by season mini-review when I'm done, but probably season 5 has some of the best of the series and many episodes that feel like they were marking time - putting Fay in the office I think was a mistake but I will get into fuller review mode once I finish the entire set - but so far, so great - good menus - no glitches - not one disc problem - no need to be careful with these discs.  And season 5 season finale was a unexpected bookend to the saeson 1 finale, which might've been Bochco's way of saying GOODBYE to the show - but I'n just guessing. Usually I put one one and end up watching 8 - that's how addicting this show can be.

UPDATE: DEC. 26 - Noticing some things in seasons 6 & 7.  Something I had noticed before is becoming a little more prevalent - wondering if some of these transfers were done before final picture ""sweetening."" Plan to take a more in-depth look but in the season 7 opener, ""SUITCASE"", there is a shot of kids walking on the street in the last few minutes that should be in the dark but looks like it's the sunny afternoon.  This occurs a few times - wondering if that scene was darkened for air and if this version had not had the change done yet.  Just some small things - at the end of the season 6 episode 2 - there is a key bit of dialogue that can barely be heard in this mix.  In ep two of season 7, Howard Hunter drives listening not to classical music as in the original airing, but - must be due to song rights - is now listening to some Kenny G power-keyboards.  Maybe a few more tiny things like that.  Also - Buntz has a crazy-high body count for two seasons.  Just getting into the extras bonus disc - great docu - Milch conspicuously absent from it.  Lots of interviews with Dennis Franz regarding the differences between Benedetto and Buntz.  What a great set.

JULY 2015: A few of you have asked if they are double-sided discs like the previous release from FOX - the answer is no - every disc is about 4-5 episodes or so and looks GREAT.",1385424000,277,7769,4.320910973084886
6109359,5,B00GSTHCHQ,"This is not yet officially confirmed but if it's true we will get the complete series for the first time on dvd.
 All 7 seasons of the show from which only seasons 1 and 2 were so far available to buy seperately.
 That's good news as hill street blues was one of the greatest police crime dramas of the 80s and i remember watching these series in the late 80s when i was still at high school.
 I hope there will be some extras in the set and i can't wait for this to be released.
 don't forget the great music theme this show had.
 that was AWESOME music",1385078400,5,554,4.045871559633028

6109411,3,B00GSTHCHQ,"Great series but a very flawed release. The series itself is top notch  and it is good to see it again. But this release is very flawed. While the video quality is very good, the audio is poor. It sounds a bit ""muddy"" and if you raise the volume sufficiently to hear the dialogue clearly, the moment you hit an action scene with gunfire, sirens, screeching tires, etc., they come through at a very elevated volume that will deafen you and make your ears ""bleed"". That sends you scrambling for your control to crank the volume back down, but then the character's dialogue is ""muddy"" again and hard to understand until you crank the volume back up a bit.
This release also seems to discriminate against the hearing impaired because it does NOT give you the option for English subtitles.
While I am glad to finally have the complete series, I am disappointed at the poor audio quality and the lack of consideration for the hearing impaired with no subtitles option available. This makes it difficult for other family members to enjoy this great series.",1519948800,,1049,4.6702702702702705

6109415,2,B00GSTHCHQ,"The Hill Street Blues show series itself is great, which is why I was glad to find a box set to purchase as a gift for a fan.  The disk packaging and box looks good.  Unfortunately, many of the disks have problems.  The playback stalls, skips or freezes in spots.  Some of the disks affected have no visible marks on the surface.  A few have visible scratches, and at least one has a small chip.  The packaging was intact and sealed, and the disks all in place in their cases, so it does not appear to be transit damage. So far about a third of the disks are affected.  Otherwise the disk playback looks okay.",1516233600,5,609,4.243478260869566

The discs have some odd (or very old) video format or the menu structure is very odd because my Windows 10 media player could not read them no matter what player sw I used. I even tried VLC, a free multi format media player that clams it can play anything, but that failed as well. Never experienced this from any other dvd. The discs just read, read, spin, whine, spin, etc until the player gives up.

6109456,5,B00GSTHCHQ,"I'd been waiting for this for a long time. I was a die hard fan of the series when it was originally broadcast weekly, and then later when it was on nightly reruns. For several years, all that could be had on DVD was the 1st 3 seasons- so I got that, and was glad to at least have that much, even though I knew that as the series matured over the years that it ran, it improved and became more sophisticated. It was also disappointing not to be able to get any episodes with Dennis Franz. So every now and then I'd check online to see if it had yet become obvious enough to those who profit from series sets like this that there was indeed demand enough to FINALLY put the ENTIRE series on disc! The video quality is not bad when you consider the era in which the series was produced. the dvds are just a bit basic, functionally speaking- you can't skip forward or backward, episode by episode- you have to go back to the menu to make any episode selection, but who cares? I'm just ecstatic that the full series has finally been released.",1504483200,,1038,4.221105527638191

6109755,3,B00GSTHCHQ,"The series itself is superb -- just as great as I remember it to have been.  It's slightly dated (hairdos, clothes, some of the language), but the script and acting more than make up for that.  It's very substantive, and the issues that this series covers regarding police conduct are the same issues that are in the news today.  If I were reviewing just the TV show, I would give a 5 star rating.

Unfortunately, the video quality of this reproduction is really, really poor, especially for the pretty steep price.  It's grainy and fuzzy -- almost like a video of a VCR  recording.  This has obviously not been digitally remastered or the like.  I realize this is an older series, but my DVD collections of shows from the 60s and 70s are of higher video quality, and the poor quality of this reproduction affects my enjoyment and satisfaction.  I rate the video quality at 1 star, thus the 3 star rating for the overall product.",1461283200,,929,4.548192771084337

The sound is out of sync at times. BUT, I LOVE these characters. I wish there were more, but 7 seasons seems to be a network's attention span.",1458691200,2,480,4.228260869565218

A COUPLE OF THE SESSION WON'T RUN ON THE DVD ONLY PLAYER BUT WILL ON THE BD BUT WITHOUT THE WORDS.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE SHOUT FACTORY WOULD EVEN MAKE THE CAPTIONING CLOSED (""THIS OPTION NOT AVAILABLE...."") AT ALL, MUCH LESS UNABLE TO BE SELECTED OR DE-SELECTED.  AND WHY IT WILL RUN ON ONE DVD, NOT ON ANOTHER, AND NOT FULLY ON BD OR A COMPUTER IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND.  THE TELEVISION SET WON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE THE CAPTIONING SO YOU CAN NOT CHANGE THE

6109908,3,B00GSTHCHQ,"I'd give it a 5-star for the content. It has really held up well over the years. Unfortunately, as others have noted, the manufacturing quality of the discs is awful -1-star at most. I had watched most of the 1st season recently so started with last episode on that disc. At the end of the episode it was stuttering and skipping. I put in the first disc of the 2nd season and, after the SHOUT splash screen, the screen went to static like no disc in the player. I hit the button for the episode list and got only a black screen. Finally I skipped forward and was able to get to the episode list. It was jumping around, but I was able to select an episode and play it - fairly clean after some initial skipping and stuttering.

These are new, just out of the shrink wrap, discs. The discs look fine, even with close examination under bright light.  They are just horrible reproduction quality. I had season 1 and 2 before this - bought as separate seasons - and they were fine. I bought the whole set because it was cheaper than buying the next 5 seasons individually.

I  thoroughly enjoyed being transported back to Thursday nights in the 80's.  I've seen the negative comments about quality but I only experienced minor issues:  In season 7, the disc froze twice for no more than 10 seconds in two different episodes.  There is a disclaimer at the beginning of 3 episodes (I believe in seasons 5 and 6) that the recording was taken from the best possible master sources. Those episodes are a little muted in color but not to the extent that it prevents you from enjoying the episode.  Overall, 5 stars!!",1431043200,2,638,4.651785714285714

Seeing after so many years it is also interesting to see many actors/actresses in bit parts or roles who later went on to successful careers in larger roles.  Really only wanted for one episode that I thought had a powerful and meaningful message.  Got it.  Overkill, to buy them all for just one?  I did not think so as it is now great late night watching, considering all the other crap (can I say that?) on TV.

6109997,5,B00GSTHCHQ,"When the classic police drama ""Hill Street Blues"" began its historic run on NBC in 1981, it very quickly became my favorite TV show. At that time, I was in the sixth year of my U.S. Air Force career. Unfortunately, I was only able to see the entire first season and part of the second before I shipped out for the first of a pair of long overseas military assignments that kept me out of the U.S. until 1989. As a consequence, when I departed the U.S. in 1982, I never was able to see another episode...

...Until late last year, that is, when I purchased ""Hill Street Blues: The Complete Series"" from Amazon.com. This magnificent package from Shout! Factory contains all 146 episodes of the iconic show that changed the tone and format of police dramas forever, with its gritty realism, use of ""handy cams,"" outstanding acting and writing, and multi-episode story arcs. Now I could watch all of the exploits of Furillo, Davenport, Hill, Renko, Hunter, Goldblume, and every other character in this wonderful show.

There's not much I can add to the praise that's already been lavished on the show itself, so I won't even make the attempt.  I will comment on the quality of the ""Hill Street Blues: The Complete Series"" package. I was extremely impressed with Shout! Factory's efforts to provide a first-class product to its customers. Each episode is shown in its original 1.37:1 aspect ratio. The video and audio quality are both top-notch. Colors are appropriately vivid throughout, and images are sharp and well-defined. Video resolution is sharper than I expected for DVDs. There's a certain filmic feel to the episodes, brought on by a light layer of film grain that's always present. Stereo 2-channel audio is clear and crisp, with a nice balance of low, mid, and high range frequencies.

The packaging in which ""Hill Street Blues: The Complete Series"" arrived deserves praise for its quality as well. The package contains 34 discs, with each season's discs (4 or 5 single-sided discs per season) mounted in its own standard-sized, multi-disc  DVD case. The DVDs are all securely mounted inside each case, so they're easy to handle and there's almost no chance of them getting damaged.

I'm still in the process of watching the entire season for the first time. So far, I've made it halfway through Season 4. I am constantly mesmerized by ""Hill Street Blues,"" which doesn't seem dated, even 30-plus years after it first was broadcast. I'm sure I am going to continue enjoying this series for years to come. Most highly recommended.",1427587200,2,2536,4.8452655889145495

6110001,3,B00GSTHCHQ,"Great show that holds up extremely well after 30 + years, in all categories:  acting, writing, direction, camerawork, etc.  Why 3 stars?  The quality of the discs is atrocious.  Defects on 50% of some of the seasons, skipping, freezing, etc.  And here's the thing:  unless you binge all 7 seasons at once, by the time you discover how many problems there are on discs throughout the set, it's way too late to return them.  Shout Media--who did a nice set of the Larry Sanders Show a few years back--did not do well on the pressing of these discs.  Be ready to see a lot of the episodes interrupted at the worst times (the last 15 minutes of the episode, usually); and no way to fast forward through the problem.  Try to avoid throwing things at the TV.  And check out every disc when you buy it; the flaws are usually visible, so you can prepare yourself.",1425859200,8,855,4.423076923076923

6110061,5,B00GSTHCHQ,"Hill Street Blues went out onto the streets and sidewalks and put them onto television screens in 1981, careful not to catch any palm trees near the tenements and garbage strewn alleyways.
Unlike Naked City, Hill Street was not filmed on the actual locations, but it managed to capture the squalor pretty accurately.  This show is the one that clearly shouted that multiple story-lines and complex continuity could be done on television successfully.
It still resonates powerfully with its iconic characters and strong story-lines, dealing with hurts and struggles that are still complexly bedeviling to this day.
It is a 1980s show of America, trying to see the humanity and inhumanity that exist side by side, one stabbing into the other.
I would be remiss if I did not mention that there is no way Steven Bochco and the other writers of Hill Street could not be aware of Ed McBain's 87th Precinct novels. I feel compelled to write this, since the series has never been mentioned in any of the interviews (which are great to have) on the complete sets, or in articles over the years.  I can even understand why the 87th Precinct is not mentioned.  But I would have a hard time believing anyone writing police procedurals for any length of time wasn't aware of Steve Carella and Meyer Meyer and Burt Kling and Artie Brown and all the others.
You can read more about the complete set and the 87th Precinct on my new RIDING SHOTGUN column here:  http://donmcgregor.com/RS_The-Flowers-Are-Red.html",1422921600,,1495,4.897233201581027
6110062,4,B00GSTHCHQ,"Great to have all the shows in one place but I have to complain about the quality of some episodes.  I started up near the beginning of the 2nd-last season and now am into the last season.  At least 3 of these episodes had printed disclaimers at the start saying something along the lines of ""we put this copy of the episode together from the best sources available"".  On these the video is grainier and the contrast is off somehow.  Worse, I get to the end of the episode where Furillo's father commits suicide and the video was pixellating and the DVD would NOT play on.  You don't get to see the final 2 - 3 minutes of the episode, which is where they put a cap on Furillo's feelings for his father.  I've seen the show enough times to not only know that this part is missing, but I also know what it means in terms of practically RUINING THE EPISODE.  I still have a baker's dozen left to watch and of course, have not watched the first five seasons and so cannot comment on their quality.  I'm disappointed that they didn't have (or wouldn't pay for) better masters for these faulty shows nor really even for all the rest of them.

No cell phones, old typewriters, no computers yet, Big tanks for police cars. The leisure suits from the 70's were still in. Yet there was a warmth, and comforting feeling about watching the program in ones living room each week. So much so that I looked forward to it weekly.
Now that I have the complete 7 years worth of episodes I am looking forward to taking my time and watching two or three episodes each week until I have seen them all.

The level of the writing, and the performances is so high, starting with Daniel J. Travanti, whose Captain Furillo is the prototype for the all of the honorable, yet flawed, morally ambiguous dramatic TV heroes that have come since.  What is a delightful surprise is the quality of the DVDs themselves.

6110313,3,B00GSTHCHQ,"Just received the box set, and did not see how to turn on closed captioning. (Both the box and the AMAMZON description say this has closed captions). Here is the reply from SHOUT Factory customer service:

Closed captioning is enabled through your television, not through your DVD player.

In addition, closed captioning is incompatible with HDMI, so if you're watching the series on a Blu-Ray player, it must be connected with a yellow component cable for the closed captioning to work, not an HDMI cable.

This is a very backward implementation, as most players now have HDMI as the only output, rendering the closed captioning useless. I have a hearing disability, but was able to get the closed captions by resurrecting an older Blu-ray player that has component outputs. The component outputs negate the ""up-conversion"" feature in most Blu-ray players. I would be wary of any products from SHOUT FACTORY until they can resolve this problem.",1414368000,5,945,5.044871794871795

6110339,5,B00GSTHCHQ,"Hill Street Blues had it all: action, drama, endearing characters who became friends and even humor that came at some of the oddest times.  The thing I remember best about the show is the writing and editing style.  Three or four stories all going on at once, with fast inter-cutting from one story to the other, and occasionally even having some of them intersect before the end.  That was revolutionary at the time, and it still has not been equaled, though others have copied the model.",1413849600,,489,4.662790697674419

My only disappointment is the lack of subtitles with the Complete Series. I previously owned series 1 and 2 on DVD and they had subtitles in English and Spanish. The complete box set does not have any subtitles which is a real shame. I like subtitles as there are often overlapping discussions and arcane remarks (often relating to contemporary events) which are hard to catch now, but subtitles helped to make clear.

6110343,5,B00GSTHCHQ,"I always knew where I would be Thursday nights at 10!  I'd take the phone off the hook because my friends knew how devoted I was to HSB and would call me to annoy me. We were all into it, though, in a big way. This show defined my tastes of what I liked to watch on TV when I was in my young 20s. I thought it was great, and still do.

Here are a few of the scenes I'm looking forward to seeing again: Phil twists a chair apart as he interrogates the guy who stole the engagement ring he was planning to give to Grace, Frank looses his steely cool and uncharacteristically throws a paperweight through his office window (then holds his hands up in front of him to signal he's back in control as the staff looks at him), the Christmas episode (""oh lord, I'm gonna die in a moose suit!""), Stan Misel tormenting JD (""Still Mr. Personality, aren't you, Misel?"" ""Still on the Hill, aren't you, Frank?""), Harry Garibaldi's death, the psychologist's encounter session with all the precinct captains (HSB was never better), Frank takes Howard's advice to let the unrepentant nun rapist face the public and let street justice prevail (""one man's opinion, without tears""), and so on.

I liked the ""theme"" episodes: everyone has a bad day. Everyone gets into a fight of some kind, showing how tough they can be. Love problems. Shows that showed that the gang members weren't so different from the cops.

There is plenty of dark humor and exciting, often low-key drama amid characters we come to know intimately. I used to Betamax record the broadcast shows and re-watch them later in the week because so much was packed into one episode.

NBC was on a roll in those years. I liked ""The A-Team"" because even though it was seriously silly it was a good counterpoint to HSB. ""Crime Story"" was another favorite of mine. In later years some non-NBC shows that I liked included ""The X-Files"" and the short-lived ""Tick"" (which might be coming back).  ""The Equalizer"" was another good one.

With all the movies based on TV shows I'd love, love, love to see updates of HSB and Crime Story.",1412294400,6,2069,4.516042780748663

But watching the re-runs of HSB now, I can see why my folks loved this show so much!  Even after 30+ years, its still a great show and other than the hair styles and clothes, not outdated at all and the acting was superb.

6110383,5,B00GSTHCHQ,"First off, let me firmly state that this series was, is, and always be in the top ten of BEST TV SHOWS EVER!!! It belongs to sit right alongside such other notable crime classics as Columbo, The Untouchables, Perry Mason, Breaking Bad,  The Sopranos, and yes, I personally consider the original Kojak to also be a powerful classic. Some may wonder why I don't include Steven Bochco's other popular crime drama NYPD Blue as a classic-don't get me wrong. I do feel that it too was a great series. In fact, I like that show so much that I ordered all of the available region 2 boxsets on Amazon's United Kingdom website over 2 years ago because I was afraid they'd never be released here in the states. And to this day I still haven't regretted my decision even though I see that now they are finally being released here and at slightly cheaper prices. Nevertheless, I have always preferred the cops on Hill Street over NYPD Blue for 1 simple but important reason-the cops on the Hill smiled and had fun at least half the time, while the cops on NYPD Blue always looked so grim and ultra serious almost all the time. Sipowicz smiled only about twice per season, and the same goes for John Kelly. And every time their commanding officer Lt. Fancy smiled he looked more like he had gas. Some of the women on that show seemed to enjoy themselves, but then again, except for Janice Licalsi, they weren't often given a whole lot to do . Anyway ,bk to Hill St. Blues, it's truly a crime (pun intended) that this fine show wasn't released years ago. Every episode had multiple plotlines going on at once, but somehow the writers always managed to keep every character's story in focus. Many storylines continued and evolved over several episodes and each character had his own distinct personality- Belker was a lovable and efficient slob, Larue was a deeply  flawed but strangely likable dreamer/loser who was always working an angle and constantly trying to get rich quick, Andy and Bobby were always bickering but ultimately one couldn't live without the other, Hunter was basically a psycho with a badge who was actually just a lonely man who silently craved female affection, Calletano was almost always hilariously exasperated and felt that his career was moving too slow while his advancing age was moving too fast, Neal Washington was the level headed individual  who was pretty much just glad he had a job while at the same time always trying to see that Larue kept his job, and lets not forget big Phil Esterhaus who served as the towering elder statesman  of the precinct, or the drop dead gorgeous Joyce Davenport who pretty much provided all the eye candy that was needed every time she walked onto the screen. And of course, in the middle of it all was Capt Furillo, the upstanding and totally uncorruptable commandant of this madcap group of bozos, who truly had the patience of Jobe and the intelligence of Einstein. There has never been a group of characters this diverse ever put together quite so successfully under one roof before, and probably never will again.

I think this is a fair call - and here is why ... never before was there a show that brought the viewer ""inside"" the workings of a station - storylines continued over multiple episodes - the camera work was often with hand-helds and the characters just won you over with their witty lines and drama.  For me ""Hill Street Blues"" changed forever how cop shows are made .... shows like ""The Bill"" - NYPDB -  ""The Wire"" (just to name a few) .. owe their structure to HSB. Watch the first episode ... you will be hooked ... I was.",1407628800,2,651,4.192

6110414,5,B00GSTHCHQ,Finally one of my all time favourite series on DVD. This Editions lack subtitles for the hearing impaired. But that is a minor flaw. I am very happy with the series and this edition.,1407283200,,182,4.382352941176471
6110415,5,B00GSTHCHQ,"To begin with, I think it significant to note that HSB was more than mid-way through its run when I debuted in the world ('85).  In fact, I'd never even run across an episode in syndication.  However, my favourite program by a long-shot (think Secretariat at the Belmont) is ""The Wire"", which I find absolutely unparalleled for writing; acting; realism; physical setting; character pathos; and any number of critically quantifiable variables that contribute to performance integrity and excellence.

So, I went looking for something comparable in the 'police/crime drama' genre without regard for production age; time and time again, critical reviews and television history blogs yielded the HSB series with uniformly attendant accolades.  Then, I went to youtube and watched a couple episodes, which was entirely superfluous because, after the first 10 minutes of the initial installment, I knew I'd want it all!

It's not blue-ray or full screen, but the picture and sound are just fine and, at this point, about 3-4 weeks after purchase, I've raced into season 4 while developing an attachment to the characters that is unrivaled in my viewing experience, but for ""The Wire"".

Early in season 2, the exceptional writing team turned the corner with protracted plot lines that extend beyond 50 minute episodes and, much like my favorite show, then began to expand the milieu to include the intersection of policework with contingent daily realities like the press and politics.  Moreover, actual filming in the dreary, threatening, and  run-down streets of Chicago's blighted areas lends a credence to stories that is equaled only by ""The Wire's"" regular use of Baltimore's slums as a stage.

Quite frankly, on all counts, this antiquated gem stands shoulder-to-shoulder, if not higher in cases, with more contemporary standouts across all genres like The Sopranos; ER; Six Feet; Downton Abbey; Madmen; West Wing; Arrested Development; Game of Thrones; Dexter; and Doc Martin.  From one discerning viewer to another:  My highest recommendation./peace, kate",1407196800,5,2057,5.337461300309598

6110425,5,B00GSTHCHQ,"I'd been wanting to watch this series again, having enjoyed it so much when it was first on, but I expected to be disappointed somewhat because of the way so many series age over the years. Not so! The plots and characters are as gripping as when I first watched it. It's basically the template for The Wire, which pushed things to another level of realism.

6110432,5,B00GSTHCHQ,"I have waited so long for this!  I loved this show passionately when it originally aired and have spent the intervening years wondering if and when I would be able to have them on DVD.  As memory of the show faded and the original release of Seasons 1 and 2 were not financially successful, I was beginning to think it never would happen, but never gave up looking.  So, I was very delighted when I saw this set and ordered it immediately.  The shipment arrived quickly and it's been great reliving the mix of humor, tragedy, love and loss the show gave to us for 7 seasons in the 80's.  The set is fairly basic and there are not a lot of extras, but doesn't that somehow seem fitting for a show about an inner city police precinct? If you never saw the show originally (face it, I'm dating myself significantly), it will seem dated.  Officers having to look for pay phones to call in will seem odd, as will the clothes and some of the things they talk about or do.  But, if you look past that, this is a great human drama full of characters with depth.  That truth never ages.",1405555200,3,1077,4.270935960591133

Hill Street Blues was not only incredibly groundbreaking in it's own time, but the people who worked on it have gone on to do amazing work in more recent years.  From Stephen Bochco came David Milch, whose work includes years on NYPD Blue, then moving on to one of my favorite series, Deadwood.  So many young actors are seen in small guest roles on Hill Street.  And I have had the pleasure of seeing Hill Street alumna in many other pieces of work, including on stage as well as television and film roles.  I don't know why it took SO long to get this series out to us, and it is regrettable that there aren't more special features, but I am happy just to be able to binge through the entire history of Hill Street Blues.",1404000000,,791,4.281879194630872
6110442,5,B00GSTHCHQ,"I loved this series in the 80s, especially since Furillo completely matched my Dad's integrity as he was also in a stressful job dealing with political idiots and opportunists and didn't stand for people doing the wrong thing but at the same time he was compassionate and respected by everyone.
The quality is quite good, the same as the original Fox release of Seasons 1 and 2 and the iTunes 1-3. There are one or two episodes in the final season that have a warning at the front that says 'mastered from the best available sources' however the quality on a 92 inch projection screen was very good, probably just ever so slightly less definition than the other episodes with the slightest ghosting on the edge of the pillar box.
On a 40-50 inch plasma or LCD I doubt you'd notice the difference. For some reason though, the same as broadcast episodes the opening titles in Season 6 look as though they used a really old version of the film stock, don't know why, perhaps there was a reason for it at the time but I remember it having a very slightly different tone in the opening music during one of the seasons when I watched it in 1986 and that must have been it - perhaps only a couple of seasons before the end they were looking to re-use some bits that no one would necessarily notice and it's probably only noticeable now because of the HD capability of modern equipment. I watched the entire series again as alluded to above on a 92 inch screen from a Marantz DV9500 DVD Player (top of the range at the time of purchase and upscaling to 720p), the projector is 1080p and I thought it was fine - only comment would be it's obviously from whatever studio masters they had access to and unlike internet downloads there are NO scenes missing, all complete.
All in all a fantastic package.
I remember LOTS of Entertainment Tonight segments and spots on HSB when it was on the air, pity they couldn't get hold of that old footage for special features but what there is are very good.
I am rapt with this, been waiting since the 90s for this and thanks to Shout Factory for doing it, brickbats to Fox for being useless curmudgeons and not remastering it for Bluray, it certainly deserves it considering its place as a paradigm shifting series in TV history. It holds up extremely well today because it pioneered everything used in current quality TV - ensemble cast, handheld camera work, gritty realism (the police cars were beaten up and dirty unlike any police show before it), going from one moment of laughter or reflection to gunshots going off and death unexpectedly. I remember how shocking that was in 1981-87 and how at the time it was 'West Wing-like' and totally the most intelligent, most exceptionally well written and produced show on TV. The scripts were required reading in classes at Universities.",1403913600,,2816,4.589285714285714

The plots as relevant today, as they were back in 1981, and the show still feels as modern as it did when it first aired. Without HILL STREET BLUES, there would be no N.Y.P.D. BLUE, CAGNEY AND LACEY, or any of the other modern US police/crime shows we all now enjoy. It really was a truly genre-defining piece of television!

Most discs contain between three and four-hours of material, so they do push the envelope in terms of picture quality. (I'd rather they had limited the number of episodes to four per disc at the most, whereas some discs contain five x 52-minute episodes!) However, unless you're watching this on a gigantic plasma, you are unlikely to notice any major problems with vision or sound. The picture is nice and stable, clean and clear for a show of this vintage. There isn't always the ""Previously on HILL STREET BLUES..."" episode recaps. Some episodes have some them, many don't. They do exist, and are often featured on broadcasted episodes and were included on the censored UK Region 2 DVD's, so why Shout Factory didn't include all of them, I don't know. It's not a deal-breaker, but it would have been nice to have all of them, especially when fans may want to have a reminder of some of the longer story arcs that occur, that they may have forgotten about. Ditto with the ""Tonight on..."" segments. Some episodes have them, some don't.

The only real complaint, for me, is the Gag Reel. It lasts just 35 seconds! That's right, a little over half-of-one-minute! It's not even particularly funny, nor do you really get to see anything of any real value. It's essentially three of the main cast flubbing their lines a little. As a bit of TV history, it's fun. As a DVD extra, it's pretty redundant. With that said, I do appreciate Shout Factory for including it. Just don't expect to find anything to laugh at.

The other reason I wanted to post this, is as a notification to non-US customers! If you don't own a multi-region DVD player, then you may not be able to play all the discs. For reasons unknown, the outside of the box states this set to be Region 1. This is not technically the case though.

Seasons 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are all Region 0. However, Seasons 2 and 7 are both Region 1-locked! As is the Bonus DVD Disc, containing most of the Extras!

The extras last around 2hrs 40 minutes in total. There's a two part, hour-long featurette on how HILL STREET BLUES came into being, with some of the main cast featuring, though sadly nothing from leads Daniel J Travanti and Betty Thomas! (Major omissions in my view!) Then theres a Q&A discussion session, taped from a few years back, which runs for about 45 minutes, which is fun. Alas, sometimes it's hard to pick-out what is being said, as the cast tend to talk over one another a fair bit. However, it is interesting hearing what they thought of the show and their characters, so many years after it had ended.

All-in-all, this is a solid set. Not quite perfect, but for the money and effort, it's still a very worthwhile purchase! If you can't get the Australian set, then this is the only other option available, and until someone comes along, and offers us a better release, this release will more than suffice!",1400803200,4,3313,4.541038525963149

While definitely a product of the 1980s, it's withstood the test of time -- still very entertaining and not leaving me scratching my head wondering what attracted me to the show in the first place.

6110515,5,B00GSTHCHQ,"It's just after one on a Thursday morning. In a turn of events that fairly can be called miraculous, with Amazon's help I have discovered that the entire ""Hill Street Blues"" series is about to be released on DVD. FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

By orders of magnitude, Hill Street is my favorite television series of all time. I remember my experience of the first season, each week doing anything necessary to be home by the new episode's beginning. More, I remember the tears I cried during a large number of that season's episodes. Never before and not since have I been so emotionally invested in a television series.

Brilliant writing. Inspired casting. Evocative performances. Hill Street depicts a gritty, broken, chaotic, but relentlessly human world.  This is a cop show whose central question is not whodunit? but wholivedit? and howwegoingtomakeit?

I purchased seasons one and two on DVD upon their release - seemingly forever ago - with the expectation that the rest of the series would follow. After all, I reasoned, they released ""Gilligan's Island"" in full, SURELY they would do the same for Hill Street! But no. For some reason Fox stopped production after the second season, leaving fans such as I to lament. Praise to all involved in Shout's acquisition of the rights to the series.

After a wait of WAY too many years - a wait during which I watched only a couple of episodes from the season one DVD collection and none of the 144 episodes I had recorded on VHS from WGN's airing of the show back in the 90's - with giddy but passionate satisfaction I have pre-ordered this series. If you follow my lead, you won't be disappointed.

EDIT (5/18/14)
We have watched the first several episodes of season one, enough exposure to this collection to add an ""Amen!"" to my previous comments.

1) The transition to DVD is superb, resulting in outstanding video quality, even when expanding the native 4x3 image to a 16x9 orientation (though I detected two or three very brief instances - perhaps a half second each - of color loss in in portions of the screen in one of the episodes; absolutely nothing to raise a fuss over, however).

2) The audio is excellent. I especially love that the Shout productions uses the entire Hill Street theme song as accompaniment for the main menu screen; so many DVD producers use edited, often mangled versions of the content's theme music for such a purpose.

3) And the heart- and mind-grabbing dialogue between characters you care about remains wondrously intact. Funny, tragic, thoughtful, irreverent, provocative, silly -- and sometimes, you get all that before the opening credits roll!

All due respect to television's modern creative community, but Hill Street Blues stands alone.

Buy this set.",1396396800,7,2752,4.935064935064935
6110516,4,B00GSTHCHQ,"Let's assume customers already have their opinions on the quality of the program; ""Hill Street Blues"" is my second-favorite show of all time, so there's where I stand. More to the point here is the presentation. First off, finally we have the complete series for the first time after 20th Century Fox gave up after two seasons. Thanks, Shout! Factory, for coming through with all the episodes. It must be said, though, for those of you wondering, that Shout! Factory has taken a bare-bones approach to this. The presentation is distinctly mediocre. Box art doesn't have much effort put into it, and the side photo on the box is a group shot that doesn't even include mainstays Michael Conrad and Mike Warren. Sorry, Robert Prosky, but you're not part of the ""classic"" lineup. By the way, my box was severely damaged on arrival (I received an early ""pre-order"" from ""Shout! Factory). Each season has its own case; merely satisfactory art there, too. The menus are ordinary, far less cool than Fox's approach. In addition, and most annoyingly, there are no subtitles whatsoever, even though there were subtitles on Fox's seasons. A quick check of a few discs reveals picture quality is good, though in cross-checking the second season, I see no improvement in Shout! Factory's picture quality, though it's not using double-sided discs as Fox did. Shout! Factory includes the extras from the first two Fox seasons (including all 38 seconds of the gag reel), but not a whole lot else that's new. There's a booklet with a nice retrospective by Pulitzer-winning critic Tom Shales (about 3 1/2 pages worth); the rest of the booklet is just an episode list and summary. It looks like Shout! Factory had its ""B"" design team doing this thing. If this seems like a lot of complaining, I suppose it is, but most of it's just nitpicking when you consider what you're getting. Overall, thanks to Shout! Factory for coming through and producing this. I was giddy as a schoolgirl when I received the box.",1395878400,13,1988,4.832844574780059

Using a Currency Convertor, the Australian price converts in US Dollars to $92.57.  (Their money being worth a bit more than ours at this point in time.)  So why so pricy?

The Greatest Show of ALL TIME. No questions, no doubts. Great character development, story lines that were real, and talent ...and loads of guest talent. Seeing James Woods, Danny Glover, and Alfre Woodard's incredible performance in season 4 that earned her an EMMY.
