  There is one thing...as a child I went with my parents to see the movie ""The Blob"" with a young Steve McQueen.  Not the best movie in the world, if you see it today.  BUT, the thing is, it all starts with a falling star.  Can you imagine how I, and my sister and brother, felt when we came out of the theater and saw a falling star not more than five minutes later!  Freaked the hell out of us then, and still makes me a little uneasy even today.  I have to admit, I think my parents were sorry they took us to the movie that night.  We, three, did not want to go to sleep that night!",1205971200,,777,3.9294871794871793

CONTENTS:

THE SATANIC RITES OF DRACULA--  Another entry in the Lee/Cushing Hammer Films vampire series. The twist here is our Victorian era vampire now stalks London's streets in the 1970s. Look for Joanna Lumley (of THE AVENGERS and ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!) as Jessica Van Helsing.

SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE DEADLY NECKLACE--  Holmes and Watson try to unravel the mystery surrounding the disappearance of Cleopatra's necklace. With the luscious Senta Berger in support.

MURDER STORY--  A hopeful author who's also a fan of novelist Lee enlists the author's help in searching newspapers for story ideas. What they find may lead to the young man's downfall.

To see one of the original Sherlock Holmes portrayers in action, check out the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BASIL-RATHBONE-SIGNATURE-COLLECTION/dp/B000NY1EDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BASIL RATHBONE SIGNATURE COLLECTION</a>, also from St. Clair.

2858333,1,B000R3PDFC,"This is not supported by Christopher Lee in any way and his signature is being used without his permission The company releasing this is a well known bootlegger.

Quality is likely to be quite poor on this, as well.",1188950400,19,215,4.512820512820513
8198737,5,B000R3PDFC,"It may be a bootleg, but it's the only known DVD that features British gem 'Murder Story.' A sadly overlooked classic in Lee's oeuvre.",1459728000,,134,4.625
8198738,4,B000R3PDFC,"I liked this set because it gathered together a couple of lesser seen and available Christopher Lee films. First, ""I, Monster"", which is ""Jekyll and Hyde"" but the producers didn't want to call it that. It can be watched in 3D (glasses are included) or 2D. It was interesting to have a chance to see it in 3D but I personally didn't see much of a difference. CL's performance is outstanding, from the strait-laced serious, scientific Dr. Marlowe to the ever more corrupt and evil Mr. Blake. Having Peter Cushing as his friend Utterson only adds to the movie.  Second is ""Secret of the Red Orchid"" from and Edgar Wallace novel _When the Gangs Come to London_. Christopher Lee is an American FBI agent helping Scotland Yard. Klaus Kinski has an early role and Eddi Arent provides comic relief as the ""Death Butler"". Yes, it is badly dubbed. It is too bad those putting this set together didn't put the German with English subtitle version on here as an alternative. If you have a region free player, I highly recommend going to amazon/de and ordering the Edgar Wallace Edition 3 set. It has this movie plus three others, all in the original German with (or without) English subtitles. It really isn't a bad movie. Third is ""Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace"", Christopher Lee's first time as the Great Detective. This was also filmed in Germany, but as far as I can find there is no original soundtrack version available. It really is too bad, as CL not only has a couple of disguises but the voices while in those disguises was bound to be different and we'll never know how he sounded. I read that he offered to redub it in English for them but the filmmakers didn't take him up on his offer. I didn't feel that Thorley Walters was too much in the Nigel Bruce mold. He had a clutzy moment, but a couple of other times helped out Holmes nicely. Fans of ""Hogan's Heroes"" will spot Leon Askin (Gen. Burkhalter) as Charles the Chauffeur. There are no extras with this set of movies, why not take the opportunity to have some commentary, photo galleries or a documentary of some kind. But in the end very happy with this set.",1457481600,,2125,4.5483028720626635
8198739,5,B000R3PDFC,"I love Christopher Lee movies!!! The best one on this collection is the Sherlock flick, although I think it is dubbed because it doesn't sound like Lee's voice. The Red Orchid is fabulous and funny, but again, it is dubbed, and was originally in German, so not only does it not sound like Lee's voice, the lips never match up. I, Monster, is an interesting film. Thankfully, fewer prostitutes than in the Hammer version, but I think that Hammer's version of Dr. Jekyll was probably altogether better. However, Lee is fascinating as the dual character.",1457049600,2,551,4.810526315789474
8198740,5,B000R3PDFC,Great collection of movies with my favorite actor Christopher Lee!!!,1455926400,,68,5.9
8198741,4,B000R3PDFC,"Hard-to-find films in a nice format.  If you love Christopher Lee, this is the package for you.  Especially noteworthy is the 3-D version of I, Monster--Lee's look at the Jekyll/Hyde story.",1453852800,,189,5.064516129032258
8198742,3,B000R3PDFC,"The reason to buy this dvd is for"" I Monster"".  Kudos should be given to Retromedia for releasing it in 3d with glasses provided to add to the enjoyment.  Although it is a weak 3d ( unlike todays 3d where things pop out of the screen and you could almost touch them ) it still makes for an entertaining experience plus it is not headache inducing. If however you do not choose to want to watch a 3d movie Retromedia has thoughtfully included a regular version as well. ""I Monster"" is yet another version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde but because of copyright reasons their names are Dr. Marlowe and Mr. Blake.  The film was originally suppose to be shot in 3d but the idea was abandoned when it was discovered that the process was too expensive for their meager budget. Also there is no love interest for Dr. Marlowe or Mr. Blake.  No fiance and no champagne Ivy to help create tension in Dr. Marlowe for the love and lust he has for  both women.  The budget probably wouldn't allow them to hire 2 more actresses and because of this Dr. Marlowe will turn into Mr. Blake sometimes without any reason whereas before the metamorphosis would occur sometimes due to repressed feelings of lust.  Lee does a good job with what he is given but unfortunately it is not enough.  Motivations are sketchy at best.  His murder of a prostitute because she insults him although the highlight of the film as far as thrills go seems pointless and petty.  The real Mr. Hyde would have insulted her right back and then slapped her across the face.  He would not wait for her to leave the pub and then chase her down London streets.  What saves this movie is the chemistry between Lee and Peter Cushing. Even when they do not have much of a script to work with they can always create magic on the screen.  Their fight at the end is another highlight with plenty of tension and suspense.  If only the rest of the movie were like this.  The other 2 movies on this disc unfortunately dub in Lees voice and therefore are hard to watch despite being somewhat entertaining.  The Secret of the Blood Orchid is an Edgar Wallace thriller that has Lee as an FBI agent sent over to London ( actually Germany where the film was shot ) to hunt down some gangsters.  The highlight in this film occurs in the first 25 minutes when Lee being stalked by a hit man suddenly turns around and guns him down with a gun in each hand Clint Eastwood style and tells his would be assassin he was too slow.  There is plenty of action but as I stated before everyone is dubbed and that hurts the overall viewing experience. The other dubbed movie is Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace and is probably the most disappointing film because of the talent involved.  It is directed by Terence Fisher and stars Lee and Thorley Walters as Holmes and Watson plus Senta Berger and Leon Askin from Hogan's Heroes as a henchman for Moriarty. The plot has Lee as Holmes trying to thwart Professor Moriarty's attempts at stealing an Egyptian necklace. The most heinous crime perpetrated however is dubbing in Lees voice with an American accent. I recommend this collection for Lee fans who want to see these movies in their proper aspect ratio and for the 3d in "" I Monster"".",1447804800,4,3217,4.459044368600683
8198743,3,B000R3PDFC,"Love Christopher Lee and had not ever seen these three films.  I am glad that I got this set, but have to say that only I, Monster is interesting and tolerable to watch. The second film is just so poor, I didn't finish it - the voice and film was out of sync and I hate that.  I guess this is all that the studio had to go on, but the movies are in bad shape. But again, if you like Christopher Lee, this set is worth having.  I don't like 3D, so I have not watched I, Monster in that form. However, for fans of 3D,  the set comes with two pairs of 3D glasses.",1447545600,,560,3.8017241379310347
8198744,4,B000R3PDFC,"Not Christopher Lee's best films, but those interested in this collection probably know this already and just want to complete their collections of his work.  ""I, Monster"" is readily available elsewhere, but the other two films are harder to find, and make this a worthwhile purchase.",1446681600,,284,5.173913043478261

8198746,3,B000R3PDFC,"I, monster and Sherlock Holmes are really great movies but I couldn't get through the last one. Christopher Lee's voice is voiced over by someone else and it totally took me away from it. Still 2 out of 3 is a good number",1444089600,,221,4.162790697674419
