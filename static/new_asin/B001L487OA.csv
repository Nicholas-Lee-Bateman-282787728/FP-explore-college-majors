8317129,3,B001L487OA,"It is not the best but it does teach couples a lot if you need some help.
It had a little to much on the introduction but is OK in explaining
with what was showed.",1371168000,,163,3.6857142857142855
8317130,5,B001L487OA,"Good Video. But why do you require more words ,since I am a man of fiew words is hard for me to do ??",1356912000,,101,3.25
8317131,3,B001L487OA,Will have to somewhat agree with the less likes. Its ok but I would look for something a bit better. The men in this video seemed to have a difficult time maintaining an erection despite all their lady friends giving it their best try. Which made me wonder if some of the love making scenes were faked. Video does depict the current physical state of the older generation of men. Much overweight. Two of the three ladies were in better shape than the men. The heavier lady was struggling to make love because of her physical size. You could tell she was a bit uncomfortable in trying to have sex. Dr Britton does a good job of narration. The subject matter is current to the over 50 group of men and women. I will have to say I enjoyed the bonus scenes a bit more as at least the younger men can maintain an erection when having sex. I will also have to agree I would have found this video a bit more exciting if the men and the heavier woman would have been in better physical shape. I am a male 60 years old. My wife is 58. My wife was not excited about looking at the overweight men. I have learned from my own experience that losing weight and getting off of the pills is the best thing to do in improving one's libido as opposed to using the odd gadgets available at least for men.,1355529600,2,1286,4.189516129032258
8317132,3,B001L487OA,I know that the body changes as we age.  I am 55 years old.  But these couples are not attractive.  And the threesome massage scene was something I found objectionable.,1345507200,,168,4.533333333333333
8317133,1,B001L487OA,"The contact was not worth the money. VERY limited subject information. Very few ideas and or suggestions.
Worthless! I was anticipating more topics to be discussed. The chit chat in the beginning of each segment was not needed. It was very similiar in each segment.",1326240000,,265,4.911111111111111
8317134,4,B001L487OA,"Good stuff. Inspiring. Definitely graphic.

Now it's time to do the over 60 DVD.  Then the over 70 DVD.

There are some of us who want to keep watching DVDs like this. We want to keep reading books like Grandpa Does Grandmas, Dr. Ruth's Sex After 50, and Seasoned Romance.

So I, for one, am grateful to the Alexander Institute for the time, energy, and courage to produce this sexy, oldies-but-hotties DVD!",1311552000,6,407,4.611111111111111
8317135,5,B001L487OA,"I'd like to comment on the DVD set, Great Sex Over 50 for Men and Great Sex Over 50 for Women.  I purchased this specially priced set for my wife and I for a Christmas gift this year.  We have had a little-to-no sexual relationship for the last 10-15 years of our 32 year marriage.  Needless to say, this had put quite a strain on our relationship.  I take the brunt of the blame because of my lack of desire, and an ED problem.  I've been on testosterone and thyroid supplement therapy for the last 5 years, with little difference in my desire.  I also have taken Cialis for the erection problems, with little to no difference.

A few months ago my doctor indicated that my testosterone and thyroid levels were well within the normal range, and that he couldn't do any more for me; yet my desire to be sexually intimate with my wife was still absent.  I am 52 years old, and my doctor had told me, as other people had, that things in the penile department after the age of 50 begin to decline and it was fairly normal to expect these problems.  I still couldn't grasp that idea, and was hesitant to initiate sex due to poor performance in the past, and the fear of poor performance currently.  While my wife and I were looking at the DVD there was an awakening in me that I can't explain other than a miracle.

We had sex later that evening and for the first time in months.  It was like I was 20 years old again.  Those DVDs had opened up a mental block for me that I had carried for many years, and I allowed myself to not be embarrassed, or disappointed by my looks, and we made love like we hadn't since 1980.  After seeing that the other couples have the same issues i.e. ... weight gain, sagging, ED, and low desire, I must've decided that it was o.k. if we did too, and it revived our sexual relations to a new high.  We have even tried some new toys that we never had experienced before and found they added additional pleasure to our otherwise normal sex routine:  same foreplay, same position, same ole same ole...

Thank you Alexander Institute for putting together a product that gave me back sexual desire, a drive to pleasure my wife, and the intimate relationship that man and wife should have together.",1297123200,14,2219,4.347087378640777
8317136,4,B001L487OA,This DVD is very graphic in every detail. Too real. It makes you want to change your act now. We don't have the problems they deal with yet! And watching hepls you become more aware of what you can do now to get ready to become older.,1282867200,6,234,4.0
