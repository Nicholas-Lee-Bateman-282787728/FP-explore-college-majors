8436935,5,B004O0UHJG,"I use this video to show my nursing students how to do trach care.  It is divided into sections and shows the parents actually doing the trach care on their baby daughter.  It is very thorough in each section and has some funny moments too.  Having parents show how to do it is wonderful; it's not stiff and didactic as many of the teaching films are, but is very down-to-earth.  It includes not just the care, but settings for the suctioning, what has to be sterile and what doesn't, how to travel with your child, and when to call 911.  I can't recommend it highly enough.  My students love it too, as it's easy to understand and complete.",1349654400,2,641,4.389830508474576
