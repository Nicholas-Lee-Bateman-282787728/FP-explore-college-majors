The film is a thorough expos of Tom Hazelmyer, an interesting fellow to say the least, but also includes ample band member interviews and peformances. The interview with Stu Spasm is hilarious!",1448409600,3,294,4.784313725490196
8725367,5,B0124KY1CG,"Really, really disappointed... in myself... for not knowing this doc existed until a few days ago. Could my head be any further up my butt? No. Have I really gotten so out of touch in my old age? Yes.

I was there for the whole ""post-hardcore"" thing that happened in the late 80s/early 90s. Nobody called it ""post-hardcore"" at the time, that's pure hindsight. I got into hardcore in 1982, and by 1987 it was obvious to me that things had gotten really weird. It was around that time that I first discovered the Melvins, thanks to the ad for their debut album in the 10th Anniversary issue of Flipside. I bought it out of curiosity, thinking it would be ""funny,"" along the lines of the Dead Milkmen or the Hickoids or whatever. I remember the first time I listened to it... it was funny, but not ""ha ha"" funny. Some of it kinda creeped me out, to be honest. But I soon developed a taste for it, and it made me aware that hardcore had given way to... other stuff. Weirder stuff.

Next thing I knew, all of a sudden this band Mudhoney was the talk of the town. Something was happening in Seattle and invading other territories, and Mudhoney was the tip of the spear. I bought their record Superfuzz Bigmuff... it didn't exactly win me over, but it was another good reminder that fresh new weird stuff was happening, so I  kept my eyes and ears open for it, whatever it was.

The next milestone, for me, was Helmet. My best friend and 'zine co-writer went to NYC in the summer of 1990 specifically to attend NMS (the New Music Seminar) and he came back with news of a bunch of new noise bands. Unsane, Cop Shoot Cop, STP, with Helmet being the crown jewel. He wouldn't/couldn't shut up about them and promised they were destined to become my favorite band. Their debut album released right around that time, and sure enough, I suddenly had a new #1 favorite. I loved Helmet more than I'd loved any other band in a very long time, I couldn't get enough of them. They were on a tiny obscure label called Amphetamine Reptile Records. That meant nothing to me, it was just a random goofy label name like any other as far as I was concerned, I wasn't aware of anyone else on that particular label's roster. However I was desperate for any other Helmet goods I could get my hands on, and so I soon bought a copy of ""Dope, Guns and F***ing Up Your Video Deck,"" an Amphetamine Reptile video compilation of a whole slew of bands in their stable, stitched together with these hilarious interstitial vignettes hosted by ""Dr. Sphincter,"" who had recently purchased the label and turned it into a corporate entity ""AmRep Industries."" *wink-wink* Thanks to this video, I discovered bunch of bands I'd never heard- the Cows, Halo of Flies, God Bullies, Helios Creed, Surgery, etc. I wasn't enamored with every song and video on that VHS tape, but it did lead me into buying records by these bands, and generally speaking I fell in love with most of them. (It was around the same time that I started discovering the new wave of bands on Touch & Go Records e.g. Laughing Hyenas, Jesus Lizard etc. and Matador bands e.g. Pavement, Unsane etc.) For the next several years, the AmRep name was good enough for me, and whenever I found something on the label I grabbed it. The flame burned bright, but it also burned brief. By the time AmRep was releasing stuff like Today Is the Day and Janitor Joe, I had more or less moved on. Such is the attention span of an underground hipster who enjoys the smell of his own poo gas.

I have only one complaint. They did a full-on sit-down interview with Helios Creed for this, but all you get to see of it is about five seconds at the very end of the movie. That sucks. I'd kill to see the whole thing. I'd kill to see another five seconds.

Over time I heard and read bits and bobs about the guy who ran the label, Tom Hazelmyer, and he always sounded like the sort of fella I'd like to have a beer with and shoot the breeze. This doc is the next best thing.

Watching The Color of Noise was a great trip down memory lane, often enlightening. Still can't believe it was unknown to me for all these years. Idiot.",1526428800,,4127,4.386928104575164

8725374,4,B0124KY1CG,"At a nearly exhaustive 120 minutes, The Color of Noise, which tells the story of Amphetamine Reptile Records and its founder, ex-U.S. Marine Tom Hazelmyer, might just be the definitive retrospective on the Minneapolis-based record label. The Color of Noise fun fact No. 1  Hazelmyer discovered iconic New York noise merchants Helmet. Yes, thats something you learn by watching The Color of Noise. The main selling point of this DVD is the music, clearly. Theres live footage of The Cows and interviews with the band as well as live footage of Hazelmyers own outfit Halo of Flies  and thats not to mention the likes of Boss Hog, the Melvins, Helmet, Hammerhead, Unsane, Supernova, Nashville Pussy, Calvin Krime, who are also featured here. A portion of The Color of Noise is also devoted to the troupe of artists Hazelmyer commissioned, including Frank Kozik, Chris Mars, Coop, Sheperd Fairey, for vinyl, CD and poster artwork, which helped to breathe life back into the concert poster-as-serious-art movement that still continues today. Yes, the next time you see a colorful and interesting album cover or tour poster  you can probably thank Hazelmyer for that. The Color of Noise fun fact No. 2  a lot of people like Hazelmyer, which becomes clear after seeing and hearing his friends and collaborators heap praise upon him. The Color of Noise is often humorous and irreverent, just as Hazelmyer and Amphetamine Reptile Records were, and after watching it, youll be quick to realize this story couldn't be told any other way.",1451260800,5,1526,5.019762845849803
8725375,5,B0124KY1CG,"Were you there? From about 1986 to 1996, if you liked music that wasn't quite hardcore punk and wasn't quite alternative, chances are, you were there. So, if you were there, you should watch this. It's for you.",1451174400,6,210,4.552631578947368
8725376,4,B0124KY1CG,"The '80s saw the rise of quite a few indie labels that served as the home to countless now-legendary and influential bands - SST, Dischord, Alternative Tentacles, Sub Pop, Touch and Go, etc. And one that seems to not get the credit it deserves is Amphetamine Reptile - a label that issued releases by the likes of Helmet, The Melvins, Jesus Lizard, and Tad, among countless others. And finally, there is now a documentary DVD that helps tell the label's story/puts it all in perspective, 'The Color of Noise.' Right off the bat, the label was different when you take a look at the gentleman who founded it/ran it - whereas the aforementioned labels were run by either members of other bands or ""music geeks,"" Tom Hazelmyer was a punk loving USMC veteranwho just so happened to also have a keen ear for the rock music of the underground. The documentary charts how the label built up its impressive roster, which included many bands that by the early to mid 90s, were the toast of the media, and to a certain degree, the mainstream. The doc is a whopping two hours in length, and the DVD is also loaded with cool extras. 'The Color of Noise' serves as an interesting snapshot of underground rock's last great uprising.",1448841600,5,1217,4.612903225806452
