7862357,5,6304094957,"I've read the reviews and, as I've never seen it (much less heard of it), I would very much like to see it.
But I don't understand why it hasn't been released on a DVD.  I don't want to purchase a VHS tape as this
format simply deteriorates over time.
PLEASE.........A DVD.

7862359,5,6304094957,"For anyone tackling this problem within their own family they should watch this film.  It shows the growing stages of alzheimers and, from personal experience, I can attest to the three levels as shown in the film by the three 'patients'.  Listen closely to what Wanda is saying as I did with my father - not ramblings, but memories!",1391817600,,333,4.627118644067797

7862364,5,6304094957,"Why in the world this video is not touted, recommended, urged, made known, I do not understand.

It is a delightful story of tragedy, love, hope - every element of life - what makes life worth living.

With the disease of Alzheimers growing exponentially, we need to see/hear this story!

Being widowed, being disappointed, relationships gone awry; new life possible - what more could you want?

Love it, love it, love it!!!

Demand this be put on dvd!

Cicely Tyson is a wonder and she is at her best in ""Road to Galveston""  Great acting by others as well!  Piper Laurie, Tess Harper ...",1285891200,4,588,4.586538461538462
