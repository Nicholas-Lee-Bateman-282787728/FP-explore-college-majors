2634647,4,B000HDR8BY,"Not withstanding the vanity of the western women,  this is a poignant, agenda-less film that documents the gap between the east and west, and the modest aspirations of Afghani women to show their visage in public.

This movie is certainly interesting in demonstrating the chasm between between eastern and western feminine mores.  Nothing like a bunch of dead family members to cement a reluctance to adopt western fashion.  Certainly the chasm is so substantial that its hard to fathom that a term such as ""love marriage"" exists on this planet, but there it is.  And the flakiness that is celebrated in the west as ""diversity"" and ""enlightenment"" is exposed in this film for its weirdness.  Afghani society is not so tolerant of behavior that is outside the lines.

If nothing else, we have a misinterpretation of gaps;  we have westerners hoping to cross decades of difference when the gap is centuries.  And yet the resilient women of Kabul, some who have never known peace know that they are right and that the battle is not  a matter how but when.  This is not a story with dramatic twists or stunning turns, but a modest story of cowed women  taking modest steps to assert themselves in a society that suddenly stopped caring what women had to say and only now minimally willing to consider their contribution.  It is a moving story of small acts of courage in the face of cultural retardation.",1168387200,8,1400,4.759336099585062
2634648,3,B000HDR8BY,"""The Beauty Academy of Kabul"" is a documentary about a group of American women hairdressers who travel to Kabul to teach hairdressing to Afghani women in the post-Taliban era. The film has many positives, mainly its interviews with the women students. Surprisingly, many seem cheerful. A few talk about the war or the Taliban. But against the backdrop of bombed out buildings and ruined villas, their laughter is obviously a defense against unbearable inner pain. The glimpses of their lives -- the houses they live in, the music they listen to, the images they watch and the structure of their families -- is priceless.

While I admire the Americans for their act of kindness, it becomes clear early on that they are almost completely insensitive to the mores of the Afghanis. The students, first of all, are survivors of a brutal regime in a male-dominated, Islamic society. Under the Taliban, many risked punishment to run beauty salons out their own homes. To hear these women being lectured by know-it-all Americans was ghastly. Almost to a person, the Americans were arrogant and insensitive. One woman figured she would single-handedly ""liberate"" the streets by driving a car -- unheard of in that country. The stares and glares she received did not seem to faze her. Another woman engaged the students in pre-class meditation -- something that must have seemed bizarre (and faintly heretical!) to these Muslim women. Most of the teachers treated their students as rookies -- unmoved that they had been working in the business for years and years. Overall, the Afghani women were serious, devout, family-oriented workaholics. The Americans -- beauty-obsessed, swinging singles and into New Age religion if any at all -- epitomized the stereotype that Americans are loud, brash, disconnected and uncaring.

This was not a feel-good story about cultures learning from one another. It was a story about one culture enduring the rudeness of another in return for advancing its own agenda. It's not clear whether the filmmakers were aware of how awful their subjects looked. It's not clear that they realized the horrific rudeness that was being recorded.  Anyway, horrors and all, ""The Beauty Academy Of Kabul"" could have been a great film had it bothered to ask a few questions, such as, Now that the Americans have left, are you glad they came? What did you think of them? Does meeting them make you more or less receptive to Western values? And so on. It was a major shortcoming that the film left these questions unexpressed. Still, the value of a glimpse into real life in an alien culture was quote worthwhile.",1160956800,34,2619,4.988558352402746

8138800,1,B000HDR8BY,I brought this dvd and it arrived cracked. And look like it was covered over with tape. Was a gift for my daughter in africa. It came day before my flight so I didn't  .  Open it till I got there. What a disappointment to not be able to watch it.,1419638400,,246,3.803921568627451
8138801,3,B000HDR8BY,as a background tasks it's not bad - has some interesting scenes and dialogues - I didn't like the fat American woman trying to convert the Afghans into her culture but I am fully for women rights.,1370995200,,197,4.351351351351352
8138802,5,B000HDR8BY,"I have not read the book, but I loved the film, and I use it in my 9th grade English/Humanities class when we study the Middle Eastern cultures.  The film follows several beauticians who come to help and the stories of several women who attend the beauty school.  My students loved watching it and learning about culture through an interesting story.  I highly recommend!",1362268800,,371,4.765625
8138803,3,B000HDR8BY,It is a short documentary on the beauty school. I was using it to supplement  Deborah Rodriquez books of Kabul..The video did give insight on the female life in Kabul...but just not quite what I expected...I would recommend the DVD for those that want to see some of the conditions that they live in in Kabul though...,1356134400,,318,4.578947368421052
8138804,4,B000HDR8BY,"This documentary is a great look at a female community transforming itself after being lifted from an oppressive government that worked to keep women under wraps (literally) and out of the spotlight. The documentary, however, does focus mostly on the Western women who come to teach the Afghani students. The Americans come off as looking misinformed, but their good intentions ultimately make the documentary interesting. It would have been nice to see more from the Afghani women's point of view. A documentary that I enjoyed more, and felt like really showed the progress made by Afghani women and also the trials they face regarding beauty and fashion choices, was Afghan Star. I saw an advance screening and watching the two female contestants compete on television in the Afghani version of American Idol was very eye-opening in terms of how far women's right have come and also how far they still have to go. The Beauty Academy of Kabul is a great look, however, at the side of Afghanistan not covered on your local news. Check it out!",1243900800,,1042,4.892655367231638
8138805,4,B000HDR8BY,"I had read the book written about the beauty school when it first came out and just got around to watching the documentary this weekend.  I am so glad I made the effort and would recommend all westerners view this if possible.

The Afghani women are incredible -- the sacrifices they make to to attend the school and better themselves are unbelievable.  Trying to go to school with children playing at your feet before going home to cook with none of luxuries of an American kitchen and a husband who doesn't view it his role to help make be tired just watching it.  The Americans that go into the school appear to have basically very good intentions and I applaud that they are willing to disrupt their lives to help others.  That being said, there was a lot of ""ugly"" American in this film.  They were largely arrogant, insensitive and disrepectful of the culture in which these women live.  The students have come through war and poverty and one of the instructors reams them out for not being more foward-thinking in their hair color. What?  Another instructor seems to be totally shocked and confused as to why these women seem to be afraid of their husbands.  I just wanted to so ""Hello -- are all you Americans stupid ?  Did you not spend some time before going there trying to understand the way these women live and the culture/laws of the country?""

My one complaint is that I wish more time had been spent on the Afghani women's stories.  They were more interesting than the Americans but got less time focused on their lives.",1242172800,,1537,4.569343065693431
8138806,4,B000HDR8BY,"This revealing and sometimes amusing documentary follows the efforts of several western women to open a beauty school in Kabul, Afghanistan, in the days following the fall of the Taliban regime. Here the feminist assumptions of the school's instructors collide with the realities of life for women in a more traditional, male-dominated Islamic culture.

The filmmakers have been invited into the homes of some of these women and we learn a great deal about their values and aspirations, as well as what is expected of them. When a young single woman reveals that she is ""in love"" with a young man, she makes the filmmaker promise not to tell her mother, who would strongly disapprove. A married woman speaks of living through the reign of Taliban terror that kept women house-bound, and another describes secretly working as a hairdresser during those years in her home - in defiance of the law. The beauty school instructors may make you cringe, but you'll admire their students.",1177372800,6,980,4.975609756097561
8138807,5,B000HDR8BY,"This short documentary works for me on several levels.

Taking it at face value, an international group of hairdressers, American, British and Afghani establish a Beauty School in Kabul, to restore an institution which had been targeted for destruction and outlawed by the Taliban regime. It is a story which can be construed as amerikan imperialism, introducing a capitalistic, secular business in the capital city of Kabul a feat which is only possible because of the security of NATO troops in the city.  However, it becomes clear from some of the cameos of the students that hairstyling and makeup were underground activities that many women were demanding even under the threat of beheadings and the more extreme punishments available under Sharia. Throughout the film there is the juxtaposition of images of beauty and sisterhood with those of armed men looking on with considerable bemusement.

On another level though, the film raises as many questions as answers. One is struck by the admission of one refugee to America of her feelings of guilt after leaving her homeland, that she did nothing to help her abandoned Afghani ""sisters"" in the series of struggles which beset her native country. What sort of society did exist in Afghanistan before the Russian invasion? We know that there was some sort of monarchy which, following a coup, became some sort of republic. Did it meet the George Bush Jr. test of a democracy? Then came the Russian invasion and the establishment of the jihadist movement, finance and armed by the US and led by one Osama bin Laden. Did the CIA know or even suspect that this would lead to the establishment of a particular type of an Islamic Republic led by the Taliban?

On a human level, it is clear from the level of interest of ordinary Afghan women that beauty and makeup are things that they are interested in but they must bow to the wishes of their husbands and families who may not approve of their use of make up or different hair styles. While not wishing to tread in or on the footsteps of feminists here, I for one, believe that it is an inalienable right of every person to have self-determination.

This little film deserves much wider attention than it has received. I heartily recommend it to everyone.",1170201600,3,2257,4.821705426356589
8138808,5,B000HDR8BY,"In 2003 six American hairdressers opened a beauty school in the bombed out ruins of post-Taliban Kabul. Director Liz Mermin follows this venture from the grand opening and selection of the first class to the graduation dinner three months later. Two of the volunteers, Sima and Shaima, had emigrated from Afghanistan to the United States more than twenty years earlier, and their cultural reconnection is emotionally powerful. ""It's been twenty years since I was here,"" observes Sima, ""but the country has regressed a hundred years."" Two other volunteers are positively obnoxious; they cannot understand why these Afghan women would not wear makeup, drive, or anger their husbands. One of them begins classes with yoga meditation as the Afghan women giggle. Another gushes that their project is not just about hair and makeup but about ""healing the country."" The real heroes that make this film worth watching, though, are the Afghan women. ""Our men have backwards mentalities,"" one of them laments. I found the symbolism of a beauty parlor run by culturally insensitive American do-gooders in a conservative Muslim country rich with paradox. Was this project one of genuine feminist liberation or self-congratulatory cultural imperialism? A little of both, I thought. In English and Afghan.",1169683200,8,1291,5.333333333333333
