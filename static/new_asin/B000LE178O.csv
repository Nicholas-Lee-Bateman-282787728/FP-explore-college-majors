8161626,5,B000LE178O,Love this show. Wish it was still on TV,1445904000,,39,3.4444444444444446
8161627,5,B000LE178O,"I love this show.  I watch reruns on TV all the time and now its nice to own my own.  I can't wait to buy the following seasons.  Great show if you have never watched it.  Some people think the story line is redundant and boring because its always about locating someone who has gone missing -- but I find it to be a great show with great characters.  A must have for any "" Without a Trace"" fans!",1325289600,,396,3.962025316455696
8161628,4,B000LE178O,"I believe the ""Box Set"" is the only way to get the first season in Widescreen.",1217289600,4,78,3.9375
8161629,1,B000LE178O,"i bought season one and season two seperately, and combined, they cost less than $40.....  with free super saver shipping.....  do not pay $120 for the set!!

i really liked both seasons and can't wait for more to be released on dvd, but this is definitely not worth the money since you get the same thing for less than 1/3 the price....<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Without-a-Trace-The-Complete-Second-Season/dp/B000LE178Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Without a Trace - The Complete Second Season</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Without-a-Trace-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0002DRE72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Without a Trace - The Complete First Season</a>",1211068800,2,739,7.987804878048781

This is very dumb.  BUY THE FIRST AND SECOND SEASONS SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER.
