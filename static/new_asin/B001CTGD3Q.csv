The DVD will take you through the whole competition from the pre-lims to the conclusion - the viewer will have enough material to work with and different type of styles to study.
Note: The editing is somewhat ruff and amateurish.
Otherwise, the interviews, locations, personality's, crews all bring urban-underground dancing front stage in this beautifully presented DVD.

Cant wait for the 2008 DVD!

Enjoy, E~",1227398400,,561,4.894736842105263

If u r an older head like me, this will be like a fam reunion- plenty of the usual suspects of the NY/NJ underground scene r here. The gems here however, are seeing the next generation strut their stuff onstage, & the love/support/kinship from house dancers the world over. (We r all fam, u see...)  If u r new to House, consider this a primer. If u r a dancer, &/or went to the event, enjoy the fam album video edition... enjoy.",1217980800,,530,4.353535353535354
8494458,5,B001CTGD3Q,"I've seen many urban / street dance DVDs over the last twenty years, mostly hip-hop and b-boying.  But this is a different experience - house dance is lesser known than its hip-hop counterpart, but an extraordinarily beautiful, complex and spiritual art form.  This 2-disc DVD, filmed in 2007, captures the spirit and movement of the underground culture in an historic look at New York City's house dance scene.  Features choreography showcases, workshops and face-to-face battles in House Dance, Vogue, Experimental and Hustle.  To keep it real, I am the producer of the HDI event, so my review might not carry that much weight to you readers, but I'm a fan of the dancers featured on this DVD and blown away by their artistry.  You should check it . . .",1216771200,,755,4.776923076923077
