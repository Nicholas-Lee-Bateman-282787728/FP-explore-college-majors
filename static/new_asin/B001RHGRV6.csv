3776231,5,B001RHGRV6,"I grew up on Hong Kong martial arts films, recently visited the Forbidden City Palace and Great Wall in Beijing, and heard this was the first Bollywood kung fu comedy, so I went to watch this movie on its opening night.  I absolutely loved it.

I'm not familiar with Bollywood, but I thought the movie might be goofy-silly from the trailer.  It was so much more than that.

The plot is well summarized by another reviewer, so I won't go into it in detail.  Basically, a comedic buffoon in India is tricked into going to China to help an oppressed village.  Along the way, he finds love, kung fu, and himself.  The plot was complex but fun.  The movie is in Hindi (spoken by the characters from India) and Mandarin (spoken by the characters from China) with good English subtitles.

In some points where the plot stretched credibility, I figured it was a Bollywood thing, and just went with the flow.  For example, the heroine's family situation, airport incident, the drunken master fight, the kung fu training sequences, were all a bit unrealistic, but great fun.

The costumes and dancing were great (who knew a womem could dance in the long chinese cheongsam dresses?).  I especially liked the scenes set in the Forbidden City Palace and the Great Wall.  I read that this was the first fight scene permitted to be filmed on the Great Wall, and having been on the beautiful, windy, and super-steep steps of the Great Wall, I loved each and every Great Wall scene.  I read that they shut down tourism for the filming, which is impressive given how packed the tourist site normally is.

I expected a lot of eye candy going in, based on the trailer, but I was caught completely by surprise by just how funny and dramatic the movie was.  My friend and I laughed so hard that we cried through many points of the movie (laughing so hard our eyes were shut and I missed some of the English subtitles).  There were some very touching points in the movie, aptly scored by a beautiful musical score.

The hero was an amazing actor.  Initially, he is a completely pathetic and cringe-worthy coward.  There was a lot of slapstick and very funny physical humour.  By the end of the movie the hero was James-Bond handsome and riveting.  I often see female characters have this physical transformation in movies (mouse to model) but have never seen this in a male character.  The hero was completely believable and his transformation was very touching.

Some of the martial arts scenes might seem over the top, but the Hong Kong film martial arts are just like that, with exploding boxes, water rising, internal strength forces battling it out through palm stances, windstorms, etc.  It was just like a really good martial arts film with Bollywood dancing and plot touches.

The movie was longer than I was used to, but I figured that was a Bollywood thing and enjoyed every minute of it.  Be warned, though, there is quite a bit of casual physical discipine between adult children and their parental figures, which was a bit of a surprise to me.

There were some corny points, which I initially thought was bad directing, but the rest of the theatre laughed extremely hard right away, so I guess it was a sly spoof device used in Bollywood movies.  For example, one of the funniest scenes for me is when the Indian/Chinese friend of the hero sees the assassin for the first time and after a stunned silence, bursts into song.  The entire audience was howling with laughter and clapping, as the comedic timing in that scene was just perfect.

I highly recommend this film to everyone.  More than 24 hours later, I'm still thinking of the film and smiling in memory of some of the scenes.  I'm definitely going to get this on blu-ray when it comes out.",1232150400,10,3738,4.623672230652504
3776232,4,B001RHGRV6,"CHANDNI CHOWK TO CHINA is the first Bollywood movie to get a nationwide release in the U.S. from a major Hollywood studio. Warner Bros. is not only distributing, but was also the producer, part of a growing move by the Hollywood majors to get involved in Asian film production. As such, it's less intended for diehard Bollywood audiences than for the international audience that greeted such past co-productions as CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON (2000) and KUNG FU HUSTLE (2004). It helps to be at least a little familiar with Bollywood and kung fu genre conventions before tackling this 154-minute combo of action, comedy, romance, melodrama, music, dance, and exotic locations. My guess is that adventurous audience members who embraced KILL BILL VOL. 1, BRIDE AND PREJUDICE and KUNG FU HUSTLE would also enjoy this.

The plot has to do with a poor Indian man named Sidhu, who works in a food shop but nurses dreams of bigger things when he is invited to a Chinese village, for reasons that are misrepresented to him, only to find out when he gets there that he's believed to be a reincarnation of an ancient Chinese warrior named Liu Sheng and is expected to vanquish the local tyrant, Hojo, who keeps the villagers enslaved. Various setbacks ensue until Sidhu resolves to undergo kung fu training and live up to the faith the villagers had in him. Also involved are two half-Indian/half-Chinese twin girls, Sakhi and Suzy, one good and one criminal, who'd been separated from their father and each other as infants. The dialogue is primarily in Hindi, with large sections in Mandarin and some English lines sprinkled throughout. Location filming includes many scenes filmed in Shanghai and at the Great Wall of China.

The international cast is led by Akshay Kumar, a top Bollywood action and comedy star who is evidently India's answer to Jackie Chan. This is the first of his films I've seen and I'm eager to see more. He has the difficult job of balancing the action, comic, romantic and dramatic needs of the script at every unpredictable plot turn and he does so brilliantly. Some of the gags are a bit over-the-top (such as when Sidhu's Indian mentor, Dada, gives him a super-powered kick and he goes flying into the sky above the city), but the alternate universe the film sets up allows for cartoonish gags, wild shifts in tone, and ready suspension of disbelief. Hong Kong kung fu star Gordon Liu (prominently featured in both volumes of KILL BILL) plays the villain, Hojo. The beautiful Indian actress, Deepika Padukone, plays the dual roles of Sakhi and Suzy and manages to make us feel empathy for both characters. Roger Yuan, an actor featured in American martial arts films and Hollywood blockbusters, is very good as the Chinese father of the twins and the kung fu teacher who takes Sidhu under his wing.

I found the whole production extremely satisfying and never felt that it was too far-fetched or contrived. If I have any quibble, it's that there weren't enough songs. There are  two major production numbers and a few songs on the soundtrack at different times and they were all so good that I wanted more. Most Bollywood films have a lot more music and dance, but this time those sequences were toned down for the international audience. The film is 154 minutes, which is short for Bollywood (but long for a kung fu movie), yet I found it to be just the right length, although I wouldn't have minded it being longer to accommodate some more music. I saw this in Manhattan, where it's playing in only two theaters. It may be hard to find, but it's highly recommended.",1232150400,2,3592,4.77938808373591

3776246,5,B001RHGRV6,"This movie is AN ENJOYABLE FUN FAMILY FILM ......The basic theme is a silly man child (Sidhu) who does everything from playing the lottery to making a shrine out of a potato to try to be something special. He's a simple chef who works for his adoptive father who has to constantly kicks his butt to the moon for being so silly and easily led into trouble( very funny sight gags). He is forever being told by his father to seek his destiny not in his life line ON his hand but in hard work WITH his hands. His best friend (Chopstick ) who is half Chinese and half Indian is a conniver of opportunity and a slacker palm reader and charm seller . He constantly tries to sell him worthless Karma charms for profit . Chopstick  is  approached by the village delegation from China to inform his friend Sidhu that he is the reincarnation of a  Chinese war lord of great destiny who needs to come save their village from an evil bowler wearing Mafia style bully HOJO. (think James Bond TOP HAT). When they tell Chopstick  what they want he edits what he tells our silly  Sidhu,  the guy is not that evil , it's not a big deal let's go to China and seek out this guy HOJO and kick butt. Maybe find your great destiny wink wink.

Next up a line where people wait for Chinese Visa and our hero is sitting on a bench with a potato (LOL yes he sees the face of Ganesh in a Potato and keeps clutching it for bravery throughout the movie ). The opportunistic infomercial model from hell miss TSM (Deepika) is in line and decides she well steal his VISA CHIP from him ( how she does this is hilarious . All things gadgetry  style from China are represented by miss tsm on infomercials that our hero has been watching in India and he has a crush on miss tsm. Deepika plays  her long lost twin , Suzie aka  Meow Meow warrior princess also. She was stolen as a baby from their Chinese fathers arms during a fight for their lives. The Dad falls over the great wall during a battle trying to save his baby Suzie (meow meow) and is presumed dead.  The mom holding Sakhi (miss tsm) believes her husband fell over the wall with her other daughter Suzie and that both died. She goes home to India to raise Sakhi.  The evil Hojo has her daughter Suzie. He raises her as Meow meow . Her husband is now an amnesiac old beggar who lives around the Great wall but can't remember that he was once a famous Master of Karate and an important Policeman who was trying to prosecute HOJO. He will play a major role in training Sidhu.

The pivotal transformation  point for Sidhu is the only possible disturbing moment for very small children. More or less I would say under age 8 sensitive children maybe 10.  Actors are forced to redo extremely emotional scenes that leave them in constant brain chemistry overload and they can not keep an over view of it.  Sidhu is made to beg for his fathers life sniveling on the ground like a coward and to finally see how sad and irresponsible he is as a man.  To drag this scene out as long as they did was not helpful to Akshay , the storyline or the audience and in my opinion is the only bad spot in the film for family viewing. Again this is the director and the editors fault for dropping the ball and not doing thier jobs effectively . I do not deduct from the movie for this. I do fast forward through it after the initial play out for the young ones.

There are  special effects present and are of the Karate variety and mostly of training. Some of the funnier fight scenes are of Sidhu's training with Sakhis father and aren't really violent per se ,more for story line progression ,very little blood if at all and cool effects that young ones will find fun , funny and entertaining . Lovers of slapstick, romance, and sobbing for ones parents will also have their moments, but the  wildly fun fight scenes ( even the potato gets in on it) let our hero's have their shining moments of steely looks and buff bodies flying through the air, all done with respect for each Nation and hero. Songs are sung and danced to, family's are reunited , vengeance is had, love is found and A RAP VIDEO ( i hate most rap but this is cute and friendly ) AT THE END OF THE MOVIE THAT'S REALLY GOOD . Pure modern flash and fun.

 Never forget that critics are writing for their individual magazines, web pages or newspaper and usually are told to pan one way or another based on their social status, and titillation provided by manipulating peoples emotions that are  needed to sell more of their product or advertising. They are often jaded and over exposed to the movie making industry with little real 'eye' left for just plain fun. They can do to a film what a tick does to a dog. Eat off of it with no return.  Read reviews from REAL people, and no it doesn't have to be me. Judge it for yourself always .",1329696000,,4806,4.285082872928177
3776247,3,B001RHGRV6,"I have to admit there were times during this movie that I wanted to turn it off and give up on it, but hung in there and watched it until the end.  Chandni Chowk to China is a Bollywood Kung Fu comedy.  If that sounds odd, then it is correct!  This film stars Akshay Kumar as a buffoonish vegetable cutter from India, who is mistaken to be the reincarnate of a fallen Chinese hero.  The movie is funny in parts, and serious in parts, and has a few brief musical numbers thrown in also.  Think Bollywood Karate Kid!  It's 150 minutes of unpredictable laughs, with good-looking main characters played by famous Bollywood stars.  Time well spent?  Not really.  Enjoyable silliness?  Absolutely.  Will we watch it again? Probably not!",1324857600,,730,4.625
3776248,1,B001RHGRV6,"This movie blew chunks.  It was utter rubbish.  Pure crap.

3776249,3,B001RHGRV6,"Did you ever see a movie that made your jaw drop?  A movie that was so stunningly bizarre that it was all you could do to keep your eyeballs in their sockets? Well that's what I was hoping to get when CHANDNI CHOWK TO CHINA arrived in my mail box yesterday. Why was I so full of anticipation of freakish delight you ask? Because this Akshay Kumar film, which also co-starred none other than Gordon Liu Chia-hui, was the first Bollywood kung fu movie and if that doesn't conjure up some wild images in your mind then I feel sorry for you because you are obviously a Bollywood virgin and thus incapable of envisioning the havoc that the star of SINGH IS KINGG could wreak upon China in general and the martial arts genre in particular. Kumar is one of India's most popular leading men and although he has a serious macho image the two films I've seen him in have both been very silly comedies in which he's played goofy characters who have been compared to  Adam Sandler seasoned with masala. In SINGH IS KINGG he was such a walking disaster that everyone in his village conspired to have him leave the country on a fool's errand. In CHANDNI CHOWK TO CHINA he's even worse off-- here he started life as an abandoned baby adopted by a man who owns the food stall where he now works chopping vegetables, when he isn't frequenting fortune tellers or buying losing lottery tickets that is.

Chandni Chowk is the name of a district in old Delhi where Sidhu lives and works with his Dada who loves him dearly despite literally drop kicking him from one side of Delhi to the other for his foolishness in trusting fortune tellers and every other kind of fakir and faker he runs across. One day while chopping potatoes Sidhu finds one that resembles Lord Ganesh (it kind of has an elephant trunk on it) and he's convinced it will  change his life. Actually his life DOES change because 2 men arrive from China convinced that Sidhu is the reincarnation of the legendary warrior Liu Sheng and they cart him back to their village (along with a fortune teller named Chopstick to act as translator) to save them from the evil Hojo, enter Gordon Liu in all his villainous glory. Whew. The catch here is that Chopstick tells Sidhu a little white lie. Instead of telling him that the villagers believe him to be the reincarnation of a warrior and that they expect him to kill Hojo, he tells Sidhu that he was an emperor and they want to honor him. Just a little lie.

Of course there are other things going on here since that's hardly enough to fill out a 2 and 1/2 hour movie. We also have the love interest (although it never really goes anywhere) in the form of Sakhi, (also known as Miss TSM) who is the  tv Spokes Model for a company that sells among other things the Dance Master G9, a clever device that when strapped to one's ankles can make you dance like a Bollywood star. Gotta get me one of those. Needless to say, our hero falls madly in love with her the instant he sees her on tv but when they meet in person things get off to a rocky start. Sakhi is bound for China too and she has her own story going on involving Hojo who, in true kung fu movie fashion, had killed her father and her infant twin sister Suzy when the family was on an outing to the Great Wall of China. There's more. There's always more.

But what's the bottom line you ask, was it all I had dreamt it would be? Nope. I was disappointed. The first 25 or 30 minutes were actually painful to watch because the humor was so over the top. Remember when I said Sidhu's Dada kicked him from one side of Delhi to the other? I wasn't kidding--he actually goes up into the air and sails over the city causing a danger to low flying aircraft.  We don't even get a musical number until he boards the plane for China and although I enjoyed the number it seemed to be cut very short. Perhaps that's because this film has the distinction of being the first Bollywood film ever picked up by an American company. That's right folks. Warner Brothers hand their dirty little hands all over this flick and I suspect that might have something to do with it's flaws. I'm certain it explains the problems with the DVD release which include the lack of a special feature that let's you access all the musical numbers directly which is something that's been included on every Bollywood flick I've ever rented before. The American version is also 18 minutes shorter than the version the rest of the world got. If they cut out song and dances numbers I'm going to get really pissed because there was a definite shortage of them. What there was was good though, including the rap song Akshay does with the end credits. Who was that black rapper anyhow?

Even though I was disappointed that it wasn't the outlandishly entertaining spectacle I had envisioned, I still wound up liking this flick. Things definitely picked up after Sidhu got to the village of  Zange where it eventually turns into a more conventional martial arts flick with Roger Yuan (who you might remember from an episode of ANGEL) showing up to serve as Sidhu's sifu and help him save the day. Did you know that learning kung fu can also up your I.Q about 30 points? It sure made Sidhu smarter, and better looking too. The action is pretty well handled although there is a lot of wire fu and CGI going on in this flick, and the showdown between Hojo and Sidhu has some laughs in it. I think the part that I liked best is that our hero manages to get throught the entire movie without actually killing anyone himself. A good Hindu boy to the very end. By the way those of you who like your women dark haired and gorgeous will not be disappointed. Deepika Padukone who made her debut in OM SHANTI OM will give you a double eyefull in the roles of Sahki and Meow Meow (yes I said Meow Meow) and of course all the back up dancing girls are Chinese.

Should you see it? Sure. If only to see Liu Chia-Hui. But I wouldn't recommend it as anyone's first Bollywood experience.

3776250,1,B001RHGRV6,"One has to wonder what the execs at Warner Brothers were thinking when they decided on this film to be the first Bollywood movie released in the U.S. by a major American studio. Perhaps their flawed logic was this: Americans like kung fu movies, so let's use kung fu to introduce them to another kind of Asian film. But if you want Americans to get acquainted with Bollywood, then show them a Bollywood movie, with all its distinct and wonderful characteristics, not a kung fu movie in Hindi with Indian actors (and a bad kung fu movie at that). The story follows dimwit Sidhu (played by Akshay Kumar), a vegetable-chopper from the Chandni Chowk neighborhood of Delhi, who goes to China to fulfill his destiny as the reincarnation of an ancient Chinese warrior. He encounters twins--one good, one evil (both played by Deepika Padukone)--and learns martial arts so he can vanquish a villain who's terrorizing a village. This ridiculous hybrid flopped at the box office for good reason. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)",1253750400,,1219,5.630434782608695
3776251,4,B001RHGRV6,"Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar, in his roles, tends to regularly shift from playing it silly to playing it serious, and most times he does this in the same movie. CHANDNI CHOWK TO CHINA is a fusion of fatuous farce, mawkish sentiment and high adventure, of Bollywood conventions and soaring Chinese martial arts. There's much to like about this movie, but also much to groan and roll your eyes at.

In China the village Zhange struggles under the oppression of the murderous smuggler lord Hojo. In desperation the villagers consult a wise man and learn that salvation lies in the shape of the legendary, centuries-dead warrior Liu Sheng, who has been reincarnated in today's world. Except that Liu Sheng has been reborn to another nationality, another country: in India.

Akshay Kumar plays Sidhu, a dimwitted vegetable chopper plying his trade at a roadside food stand in Chandni Chowk, one of the busiest market districts in Delhi, India. Discontented with his lowly lot, Sidhu (who, remember, is dimwitted) is lured away to faraway China by two Chinese elders. It's actually more Sidhu's friend Chopstick's fault. Chopstick, of possibly Indian-Chinese descent, is one of those manipulative, self-absorbed sorts, and he seizes an opportunity. The two old Chinese men are, of course, Zhange villagers, and they believe Sidhu to be their reincarnated protector Liu Sheng; they ask that Sidhu return with them to kill Hojo. Instead Chopstick (the vaguely Asian-looking Ranvir Shorey), purposely mistranslating, tells Sidhu that he will be feted as a king should he journey to China. So off goes the gullible Sidhu with Chopstick riding his coattails, from Chandni Chowk to China.

I like much of the film's tongue-in-cheek internal mythology. During its best outrageous moments CHANDNI CHOWK TO CHINA is reminiscent of Stephen Chow's very awesome&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kung-Fu-Hustle-Axe-Kickin-Edition/dp/B000QGEB12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kung Fu Hustle (Axe-Kickin' Edition)</a>. In both films, kung fu practitioners disregard the laws of gravity as they make impossible leaps and perform other outlandish stunts. Vicious contact propels bodies to improbable distances and with lethal impact (but then folks just get up and dust themselves off). Speaking of internal mythology, the film never does confirm whether Sidhu was indeed the modern day Liu Sheng. And, oh yes, I have to mention the fairly outrageous Cosmos Thumb.

Considering the source (Bollywood), the wushu is actually pretty decent, even though I don't quite buy Akshay Kumar as a kung fu fighter (although he's certainly done plenty of action movies). But the inclusion of Chinese actors like Gordon Liu and Roger Yuan - both very good as, respectively, the fiendish Hojo and the kind of insane amnesiac beggar/police inspector - make it a respectable martial arts venture. Liu (best known probably for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-36th-Chamber-of-Shaolin/dp/B000MM0LEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 36th Chamber of Shaolin</a>&nbsp;and the KILL BILL flicks) and Yuan are convincing in their acting and in their kung fu, even if Hojo's hat trick had already been done by a James Bond villain. And, for the sake of cinematic resonance, it doesn't hurt that Roger Yuan bears a striking resemblance with Takashi Shimura, the leader of the SEVEN SAMURAI. But if you've already seen films featuring Jackie Chan or Jet Li or if you've seen KUNG FU HUSTLE, then there's really no surprise in the fight scenes.

The stunning Deepika Padukone takes on dual parts. She plays the conventional love interest Sakhi, a spokesmodel of Indian-Chinese descent working for Tele-Shopping Media (Sakhi is known as Ms. TSM). But the meatier of the two roles is that of Suzy (or Meow Meow). Suzy is Sakhi's villainous twin sister and, as one of Hojo's henchmen, her kung fu is strong. It says something about Padukone's grace and physicality that I find her more believable as a martial artist than I do Akshay.

As Bollywood films are won't to do, the first half starts out in a silly vein as Sidhu's vacuous nature is again and again demonstrated, giving rise to moronic situations (one fellow airline passenger persistently asks Sidhu: ""Are you stupid?""). Akshay Kumar seems to get a kick out of starring in madcap comedies, but I find that the quality of these films tends to come and go. Having said that, there was that airplane bit where Sidhu had trouble closing the overhead luggage compartment. For minutes afterwards I was giggling (but in a manly way). But, yes, Sidhu is one of those aggravating dopes, the type who ends up believing that a potato is a god.

And, as usual with Bollywood, the second half takes on a more serious tone, and this is where Akshay Kumar's goofball character transforms himself into an action hero. Akshay, when he turns it on, has tremendous acting chops. (*SPOILER* in the rest of this paragraph.) Akshay is very good and sympathetic during the death of his character's father, the tragedy which fuels Sidhu to master kung fu and to get even with Hojo. Afterwards, though, I did think that he went to the well too much with the blubbering for his dead dada.

Yes, the humor is predominantly cheesy, but there are several genuinely funny moments scattered throughout. I've already mentioned the airplane scene but I also laughed hard and plenty when Akshay gets strapped with the Dance Master G9 device, and at that short musical interlude with the odd little Chinese inventor and during Roger Yuan and Akshay's brawl with White Bull in that little diner and then during the training sessions, with Akshay and Yuan showing very good tongue-in-cheek apprentice/master chemistry. I'm sure I missed other moments.

The DVD, by way of bonus features, also offers 8 and a half minutes of eight additional scenes, the scene most worth watching being the one with Sidhu frantically trying to evade Hojo in a restaurant kitchen. And that's it for bonus features.

Three and a half stars for CHANDNI CHOWK TO CHINA, an entertaining film somewhat undermined by the banal stuff and by all the overwrought shedding of tears. This being a Bollywood vehicle, much emphasis is placed on the importance of family; Sakhi, for example, travels to China mainly to commemorate her long dead father's passing; the amnesiac beggar's memory is fully restored when he glimpses a photo of his family. Another Bollywood trademark is the song & dance, and the musical numbers here are nicely picturized. I enjoyed the lavish ""Chandni Chowk to China"" and even ""Tere Naina,"" a brief song which lends to a surreal magical vision of Sudhi and Sakhi gently floating in the air, buoyed by an engineered umbrella. Also note that Akshay handles his own rapping during the song ""Chandni Chowk to China (CC2C)"" during the end credits. It's a bit disconcerting, though, watching these Bollywood stars in their dance numbers being backed up by Chinese dancers. ""Disconcerting"" being another good word to describe this movie overall, and I think in a good way. I mean, it's got singing and dancing, a bit of Chinese mysticism and some romancing, and everybody's kung-fu fighting. That is very neat.",1245024000,2,7255,5.241171403962102

3776253,4,B001RHGRV6,"The first ever Warner India flim and probably the first Indo-Sino collaboration promises great hope. A Stephen Chow (Mo Lei To comedy) spoof Hindi action flick.

The upside - a parody of all the major Chinese wushu films - Crouching Tiger, Kung Fu Hustle, the classic Shaw films and major Hollywood action flims like the Matrix, the Bond series (Gordon Liu's character is a parody of Odd Ball) even the cartoon Mulan too. Moulin Rogue is parodied and Curse of The Gloden Flower is parodied as a song and dance number. American Idol and the Shopping Channel all poked at.

The downside - the dubbing. I may not know Hindi but Gordon Liu and Roger Yuan struggles through their Mandarin. Gordon Liu has not made any major Mandarin flims in decades. I would suggest for the general China/Hong Kong release to redub the track or to place a Cantonese track instead.

Akshay Kumar has done a fabulous job in this movie. His acting skills are exactly what an actor needs to have. His stunt, his dialogue, his comedy everything he did in the movie was absolutely fantastic. The movie story revolved around a lot of stories but yet the effort that was put into making this movie was great. The Actor who played the Guru of Akshay's Character Sidhu was fanstastic. His hindi speaking was absolutely marvlous. The guy should be recognized for doing what he did in the movie. Deepka made this movie a completely astonishing. Her marshal art was completely awesome. I hope there is a sequel to this movie and I hope that india should recognize that the movie was not a disaster but it was a GREAT Effort!!!

The movie is extremely stupid, though. The direction could have WAY been better. SAME W/ THE PERFORMANCES This movie left terribly disappointed, but it is a good family film.
A 2/5 is the best rating I can give it.",1232323200,,261,4.574468085106383
