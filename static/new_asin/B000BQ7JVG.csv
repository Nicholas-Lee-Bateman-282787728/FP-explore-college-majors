2437533,5,B000BQ7JVG,"An amazing set! Evreything about this set is awesome! Even the commercials! I recommend this set to any cartoon lover. I'll Go over the toons with a breif opinion of them:

MENDELSSOHN'S SPRING SONG-The very detailed and eye-popping intresting artwork makes up for the lack of story here.
MONKEYDOODLE-One of the weirdest cartoons I have ever seen(Weird in a good way).Some audio is missing,particularly towards the end. Very detailed artwork.
THE HOBO HERO-Cartoon using rotoscoping techniques. Despite the epic dog rescue at the beginning,this is a rather boring short.
KOOL PENGUINS-This is probably the best commercial ever made. It's very fun animation with a good plot. So good you forget it's a commercial!
WONDER BAKERS AT THE WORLDS FAIR-Not much to say about this one,but it gets me hungry for wonder bread.
FORD ANIMATED COMMERCIALS-Ford commercials by Dr. Seuss. Not as good as Kool Penguins,but still fun commercials.
SHELL OIL/BROOKFIELD BUTTER/COCA COLA COMMERCIALS-5 commercials for the 3 products. Shell Oil commercials seem to be in a series,with 3 commercials. There are the other oil,who are a menace to the car,and Shell Oil,witch saves the car when the other oil is around. Fun animation. The Brookfield Butter commercial is ok. Not very much to it. Finnaly,The Coca-Cola Commercial is about a gypsy creating a drink with pebbles. Intresting commercial.
KORN PLASTERED IN AFRICA-VERY Wacky cartoon featuring Uncle Don in Africa. Very fun to watch especially the Cannibal chase at the end.
PM PICNIC-One of the weirdest cartoons ever. Cute little woodland critters advertising for PM Hard Whiskey?What?
TODDY COMMERCIALS-Ads for the original chocolate drink. Short but sweet. Fun to watch.
MONSTERS DO HAVE THEIR PLACE-30 second ad urging people against the recent invention of Cable TV and Pay TV.Intresting to see.
GOOFY GOAT-My favorite. Very funny cartoon which is about as funny as one of the 1950s Looney Tunes. Yeah,that funny. It's in B/W even though it originated as the first color cartoon ever made. Still,who cares if its in color?
NO FARE-I am suprised this one gets a lot of hate. I thought it was really funny. Nice artwork. Seems to be the only Goofy Gus and His Omnibus Cartoon out there. Well,now I don't have to by the complete series DVD!
EASY DOES IT- Half hour Hugh Harman Film is half of a Stokley/Van Camp advertisement,and half of a very good cartoon about a mans life which goes from terrible,to amazing,all because of Easy. Easy Does It!

Shorts With Commentaries:
Spring Song
Monkeydoodle
Ford Commercials
PM Picnic
Easy Does It

PLUS-Liner noted in the case AND on the disc.

Overall,I think you should buy this set in an instant. Despite maybe The Hobo Hero,Evreything here is amazing. Even the commentaries,which instead of annoying Film Critics,they're just guys who love cartoons,like me.",1386892800,2,2842,5.145021645021645
2437534,5,B000BQ7JVG,"Buy this set! It is from a great company named Thunderbean and Mackinac Media. Transfers are great, the commentary is joyful, and the booklet is great to have with it, too! I think the best short in this set is the Spring song by Cy Young. The transfer is so good, but splicy, and the color is popping good. Plus, that cartoon will be available in HD in an upcoming set that's Blu-ray. That set will also be from Thunderbean. Another good cartoon was Monkey Doodle, which had a very good transfer. Also, if you get this set, you couldn't resist but to replay this commericial, which advertises Wonder Bread. Not really like commercials from now. It is actually a commercial that you can sit down and watch like a show. The transfer is very great, too. So, if you want this dvd set, don't hesitate. It's great. Go and but it right now. I highly recommend it.",1384041600,4,857,4.430379746835443
2437535,4,B000BQ7JVG,"Okay for the price.  Not disappointed, not over whelmed. Would buy it again in the future, if I need this product again.",1380844800,,120,4.454545454545454
2437536,4,B000BQ7JVG,"I just recently came across the company Thunderbean. These DVDs (this is my second purchase after Cartoons for Victory, another great set) are real treasures for both animation buffs or just anyone interested in classic animation.

The actual animated shorts on this disc are exactly how they're advertised: oddities. Monkeydoodle is a prime example of this. You really need to see it just to know how weird it is.

The commercials are pretty decent, but a little on the short side (I guess that's why they have a whole DVD for that).

Overall, this is an excellent set. The only complaint I have is that I wish it were a bit longer, but I do think it's worth the price just for the odd shorts.",1373673600,,694,4.536
2437537,4,B000BQ7JVG,"This was purchased as a Christmas present for our son, and to supplements our other collections of odd cartoons. It did not fail.",1368489600,,129,4.6521739130434785
2437538,3,B000BQ7JVG,my favorite out of these toons is the penguins even though it's for cigarettes. I have Spring Song on another collection 600 giant cartoon collection,1358553600,,149,5.0
2437539,5,B000BQ7JVG,this was a trip to watch cartoon ads for cigarettes and whiskey. To see a  bit of this history was cool,1327622400,2,103,3.9047619047619047
2437540,5,B000BQ7JVG,This DVD includes some very rare cartoons.  I have gotten hours of enjoyment out of the PM Whiskey forest animal cartoon alone.,1217462400,7,127,4.7727272727272725
2437541,4,B000BQ7JVG,"MACKINAC's transfers are excellent quality-- results being solely dependent on condition of source material, which is usually also quite good, considering the age and rarity of many of these private collection cartoon shorts. Their CULTOONS! DVD includes four pages of full-color liner notes, plus extra on-disc film data.

8091046,3,B000BQ7JVG,"Good to see older cartoons and animated commercials from the 1950s.  But looks amateurish in production values.  Would not play on two dvd players nor my computer, I had to go to an old 1999 machine to get any play.",1513987200,,215,4.35
8091047,5,B000BQ7JVG,"It's amazing how much animation has been lost to history.  I don't mean that in just a physical way where filmed animation has been destroyed on purpose for various reasons.  I mean simply by people who forget they have copies of animation stored in attics, basements, storage units, etc.  Much of it was made to advertise products, stores, and brands.  This collection brings some of it back into the public consciousness.  Although the advertisements main purpose is gone, the artistry, ingenuity, and humor can still be appreciated by todays home entertainment audience.

As a kid, I remember watching Cap'n Crunch and Linus the Lionhearted cartoons.  They were very popular back in the 60s, but have disappeared since then.  Why?  Because they were essentially commercials for cereals.  Commercials starring Charlie the Tuna, Poppin' Fresh the Pillsbury Dough Boy, the Hamms Beer bear, Exxon's Tiger, et al have entertained us for years, yet many of them have disappeared from public view.  That animation has been sent into obscurity simply because the ad campaign ended that they were a part of.

I hope many more DVDs/Blu-rays are produced like this one.  There is a vast amount of it around gathering dust, when it could easily be entertaining a fairly wide audience.  Most people would be happy to view vintage spokesperson characters hawking vintage items from back in the day!  There are so many different categories for ads, that compilations categorized into chapters would make them easily digestible in small doses to a sizable market.

The quality in both the audio and video is very high for the various segments included.  I doubt any of the material here will ever be presented in a better version.  I applaud the efforts in this release, and I look forward to more similar releases if sales numbers are good.",1487462400,2,1828,4.996688741721854

8091052,5,B000BQ7JVG,"This is a splendid dvd made with the care for the medium and for animation enthusiasts alike.

The set contains some smashing set of rare shorts and adverts from 1930 plus.

Thunderbean has brought a treasure trove of remastered gold. I must say though, that this dvd I would suggest only for the hardcore animation buff, not a casual buyer or kids.

The menu's are basic and easy to follow. A single dvd box, You get special feature commentaries and one of the best parts of this set is the small booklet highlight the efforts of Thunderbean and the a description of each individual short and advert.

I never thought watching an animated advert could be so entertaining. This set has brought my love for obscure animation to the hold.

My only nit pick is, the box art is a bit lame. That is all. Don't judge this book by its cover. If you're going to have a try with Thunderbean, try this dvd. Or the Private Snafu Golden Classics or their many other amazing titles, because heart went into this release and not just for money grabbing.

Keep these toons alive, buy this set.",1402185600,,1078,4.5025641025641026
