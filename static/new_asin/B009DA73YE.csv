8540218,5,B009DA73YE,"As the third installment of the Underbelly franchise The Golden Mile provides an exclusively Sydney story. I found the series to be highly informative, and despite living in Sydney my whole life, many of the depicted events weren't well known to me. I certainly remember the police corruption headlines and Kim Hollingsworth but the rest was a blur until I watched the series.

Based on true events The Golden Mile brings together many identities and incidents from 1988 to 1999. There are some inaccuracies but for the most part what has been presented has a factual basis.

With Sydney's seedy Kings Cross as the focus location; crime, sleaze and violence is in its element.

The Golden Mile highlights the losing culture of crime, which along the way takes some guilty and innocent victims, and just a few are clever enough to survive and thrive.

It is 1988 in Sydney and King's Cross is the ""underbelly"" where drugs and sex flow freely in an environment that is protected by both crooked cops and a crew of Lebanese ""hard guys"" (all of whom seem to practice martial arts when they are not practitioners of modern chemistry) who contract out to the ""real gangsters"" that control the trade.

If you are a fan of Underbelly Series there are recurring characters from prior series.

Wikipedia provides an outstanding overview, however, what surprised me was the level of police corruption (I would likely vote that they were actually far worse then the criminals) and the Lebanese influence.

The series is turning into a marquis franchise for Australian TV.  The next (series 4) will go back to the 1920's, there are 3 Underbelly themed movies that were shown on TV in 2011 and there is even a version filming in NZ.",1309046400,,971,4.72189349112426
