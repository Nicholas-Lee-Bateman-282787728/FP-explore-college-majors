8581716,5,B00CH9C2BW,"Loved this DVD! So many moves I wasn't expecting and so well instructed. What a difference when someone explains what you should be feeling and doing for each move vs. just telling you the pose. This was a full body experience and she talks about how each move is a core move and she's totally right. I highly recommend this DVD and any of Hope's products to those who are looking for a new view point on movement, yoga and your core. You won't be disappointed. I can't wait to check out her online yoga and fitness studio.",1490486400,,523,4.346938775510204
