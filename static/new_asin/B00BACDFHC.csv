5564827,5,B00BACDFHC,"This is an awesome workout series. It is difficult, even for this very active person but well worth your time. All 5 videos are great and you will see results! I would highly recommend this to anyone who is serious about toning up!",1370476800,4,231,4.395348837209302
5564828,5,B00BACDFHC,"WOW - I just got done with the first workout in the set which is a 60 minute Fusion Mix.  I will update my review as I continue working out with the set, but I was so impressed that I had to submit a review right away!  I have tried EVERYTHING.  Tracy Anderson, Jillian Michaels, The Firm, The Bar Method, Jari Love, Zumba, TurboFire, P90X and on and on.  This workout wastes no time - you start off with a bang and it stays effective and powerful the entire way through.  6 minutes in & I thought ""I'm not gonna make it"".  But I pushed through & I feel incredible!!!  Literally every muscle feels alive.  I was very sweaty when I was finished & my muscles were still tingling.  I used 3 pound weights because I didn't have anything lighter and they worked fine although my arms were burning at the end. The best part of the workout was that it wasn't focused too much on one muscle group.  I despise workouts that focus solely on quads when there are several different muscle groups in the leg that need to be worked to create the long, lean, toned look.

I wish I could give this even more stars - can't wait for the next workout!!!

Update:  I just got done with the second workout which is a 45 minute Toning & Tabata.  This workout was great & gives you no breaks.  There is one tabata where she seemed to do the moves on the same leg both times, but I went through & did it with the other leg & will know for next time.  But that little blip doesn't phase me in my 5 star review of this set.  Using three pound weights my arms were screaming at one point, but it wasn't undoable.  So far I have found both instructors to be motivational & inspiring.  They look like they are pushing it with me.  I love how I feel when I finish these workouts!!!

Update:  Finished the third workout which is a 50 minute Barre.  Another incredible workout from this set.  This workout was less impact, but that doesn't mean I was sweating any less.  I couldn't do all of the reps with 3 pound weights & had to drop them to continue.  I definitely needed 1 pound weights for this one.  Really great workout altogether.  This is the first expensive set where I feel that I haven't wasted my money.  Bring on the next two!

Update:  Finished the fourth workout which is a 60 minute Bikini Bootcamp.  This is the first one where I haven't felt like I wasn't gonna make it through within the first 10 minutes, but it was a great workout.  40 minutes of kicks, punches and jumps.  Save your energy for the last few minutes of this.  Then 20 minutes of toning on the floor.  No equipment was needed for this workout although you can use hand weights.  I chose not to since I've been doing these workouts back to back & wanted to give my arms a slight break.  Am loving this entire set - it was a great investment and I already feel like there are changes in my body & energy level.

Update: Finished the fifth workout which is a 45 minute Fusion.  This workout was tough!!  The 3 pound weights were ok for most of it but it was really unforgiving in other spots.  Within the first few moves I could feel every muscle in my stomach.  I could not do every rep of every exercise, but kept going & it was well worth it.  I was already sore from doing Hard Body Yoga yesterday and I probably wouldn't have done it if I had known how many planks & push ups there were.

I will say it again - this entire set is incredible!!!  I have been doing these workouts for one week & already feel a difference all over, especially in the core and legs.  I will update again to let you know if the results continue.",1368662400,15,3580,4.197058823529412
5564829,5,B00BACDFHC,"Working out at home is a passion of mine, and I always love trying out new programs and workouts.  I have close to 300 workouts DVDs, and I don't say this lightly when I say that this is one of the best sets I've got in my collection!  This is a fun, creative set of workouts, and is really different from anything else I own.  I highly recommend it if you're looking for something that is advanced and that will challenge your body in new ways!

To do the five workouts, you'll need the following equipment:

* a large stability ball
* a small playground ball
* a wide resistance band
* a pair of one- or two-pound dumbbells
* paper plates or gliding disks
* a chair or ballet barre
* and a yoga mat

You don't want to use weights that are heavier than two pounds since the workouts move quickly and there is a lot of arm work.  If you're just starting out, a pair of 1-pound weights would probably be just perfect.

There are five workouts in this set taught by five different instructors, and each one is very unique.  Each workout is led by a main instructor, and there are two background exercisers, one of whom is a modifier, showing an easier version of each exercise, and one of whom does advanced moves.

The workouts are as follows:

*  Fusion Mix with Darby - 60 minutes  -- This workout requires a stability ball and light dumbbells.  I think that the best way to describe it as a blend of athletic-style calisthenics and dance moves -- and it is a non-stop sweat fest.

*  Tabata & Toning  with Francie- 45 minutes  - T&T requires a wide resistance band (the thick kind without handles), Gliding Disks or paper plates, and dumbbells.  In this workout, there are six sets of cardio intervals, where you do six tabata drills (usually three on each side and each with a ten-second recovery).  The recovery periods consist of weighted works, so your heart rate is constantly elevated.

* Barre with Sadie - 50 minutes - The Barre workout requires your light weights, a barre or chair, and a small playground-size ball.  It starts off with some nice cardio work, and then moves into work with a barre or chair.  (If you're not focusing on how much pain you're in, look out for the dog who sniffs around at the bottom of the screen during the barre section!)  I have a lot of barre workouts, and this is one of the toughest I own.  It helps to know that the background exerciser Brooke (who is also an instructor in one of the workouts) is in pain, too!

* Bikini Bootcamp with Amy - 60 minutes - There is no equipment required for this workout, although you can use 1-pound weights or weighted kickboxing gloves in the kickboxing section. The first 40 minutes is a kickboxing workout, and the last 20 minutes is floor work that concentrates on your legs.  The floor work mostly consists of side-lying leg lifts and bridge work.  While I like this workout a lot, it's the least unique one of the set.

* Fusion with Brooke - 45 minutes - This requires your dumbbells and ball.  It, like Fusion Mix, is a combo of barre, calisthenics, and pilates, and is very creative.

The workouts that require minimal equipment would be good for travel, and none of them require too much floor space.

Although each workout is unique, some common elements they share are athletic-style drills (like burpees, planks, etc.) that work the whole body and that keep your heart rate up the entire time.  I love workouts like this that combine cardio, abs, and toning.  The instructors also don't take breaks, so I have to occasionally pause so that I grab a sip of water and towel off.

I have the first Dream Body and love how hard it is, but hate all the pop-ups and how fast it moves. This new series is much better! All the annoying aspects of the first DVD are gone.  Although the five workouts in this new set are all very fast-paced, they are much more do-able and it's easier to maintain proper form.  If you like barre/pilates-type workouts with an athletic twist, you'll probably really like these. They remind me of what I love about Leah's Ballet Body, Tracey Mallet's Booty Barre, and the Pop Physique ones. If you like those other workouts, I'd say that you'd like these ones, too.

As far as results go, I've been using it ever since I ordered it from Fusion Fitness in December, and have gotten great results so far! I've been combining these with the new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tonique-Born-to-Move-with-Sylwia-DVD/dp/B00B04KZ5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tonique Born to Move with Sylwia DVD</a>&nbsp;workouts, and my legs are slimming down, my butt is lifting, my saddlebags are lessening, and my bat wings are disappearing.  I've also noticed that my cellulite is much better than it has been in the last few years.  I haven't been taking measurements or weighing myself since I try to avoid the scale, but I put on skirt the other day that I bought in December, and it was too loose on me.

As far as how to use these goes, on their Facebook page, the Fusion Fitness owner Darby Brender (who's on the cover of this set) said to do these in order, with one day in between for just cardio. I've been doing these back-to-back, however, and haven't experienced any signs of over-training since they all seem to work your muscles in different ways.  It would have been great if they had provided more guidance for how to use these workouts by including a rotation calendar.

What I also really like is how these target women's problem areas:  the triceps, abs, and inner thighs.  After doing this for a few weeks, I started getting lines across my inner thighs, and my arms and abs have looked the best that they ever have.

Also, there has been some concern on fitness forum websites about the quality of these DVDs.  If you ordered these after January 21st, you should have the pressed DVDs, and not a set that is DVD-R.  (If you check the back of your disks, the DVD-Rs will have a purple tint to them. They degrade after a few years, and can end up pixilating.)

As much as I love these five workouts, there are two negatives that stand out for me.

First, the music is really quiet and bland.  For a set that costs this much, it would have been great to have had some pumping music to get you amped up while you work out.  The music in the original workout was too loud, but this errs in the other direction and is so soft that at times you can barely hear it.

The second big negative is that there is no mirror cueing, which can make some of the moves hard to follow.  I own other workouts that don't have mirror cueing, but the instructors in the Dream Body workouts all constantly call out which side you should be on, which gets my poor brain confused since I'm puffing to keep up! ;-)

Despite those negatives, I'm still giving this product five stars since it's an excellent set!, I highly recommend it if you want a set that blends athletic-style moves in a fun and fresh way.  Just be prepared with a big towel to wipe up all the sweat that'll be dripping off of you!  :-)

I hope that this review was helpful!

UPDATE ON 2-24-13:  This set really is fantastic for weight loss! I took a three-week break from it to prevent boredom, and started to put on weight.  After one week of cycling through these five DVDs, my ab, thigh, and arm definition is back.  It's a tough set, but you'll get results!

UPDATE ON 3-7-13:  On the Fusion Fitness Facebook page, they announced that they're filming new workouts this weekend.  I'm not sure how many there will be or what the details are, but they did make it sound like they'd be as tough as -- if not tougher -- than this set.  I'll update this if/when I learn more about the new workouts.

UPDATE ON 4-14-13:  Someone I know who lives near the Fusion Fitness gyms in Kansas City let me know that the new videos are five cardio videos plus a low-impact pregnancy one.  They're supposed to be ready by the beginning of summer.

UPDATE ON 4-21-13:  They just posted on their Facebook page that the new DVDs should be out by May -- just in time for swimsuit season!

UPDATE ON 5-3-13:  There is still no word on the release date for the new set, but Darby Brender posted something on Facebook about how it will be called the Dream Body Cardio Series.  I'm hoping that the new set is not quite as expensive as this set!

Also, just to share more results, a Facebook friend who started using these workouts every other day went down a dress size in about two weeks of adding these in to her workout schedule. The intensity and exercises really are so great for weight loss and toning!

UPDATE ON 5-17-13:  I found out today that the new cardio series won't be out for another six weeks.

UPDATE ON 6-17-13:  It looks like the cardio series will be out on July 15.

UPDATE ON 8-8-13:  The new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dream-Body-Cardio-Series-5-DVD-Set/dp/B00EBRWWG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dream Body Cardio Series 5 DVD Set</a>&nbsp;came out a few weeks ago, and I think it's another great set!

UPDATE ON 11-28-15:  If you're looking for fusion-style workouts that are less intense, check out Linda Woolridge's Barlates Body Blitz workouts.  They're in a similar style as these, but are less frenetic, while still giving great results.",1361664000,44,9298,4.601823708206687
8564846,5,B00BACDFHC,"I really wish I could give this more than 5 stars. I've given others 5 stars (i'm talking to you, Insanity Max 30) and they cannot compare to this! I've only done the first 2 workouts and i'm so impressed. I'm a 46 year old who loves to workout really hard (otherwise it's just a waste of my time). I love cardio but also love barre. To me, this is a perfect mix of both. I have NEVER had to hit pause on any of my home workouts (too  many to list here: All the asylums, all the insanities, P90x 1,2,3, T25, Ballet Body, Ballet Physique, P57, the list goes on) but within the first 10 min on that first DVD, i was hitting pause!!!! I did Tabatta today and only had to hit pause once which felt like quite the accomplishment. I can't wait to complete the set. I've already ordered the cardio version of this!! I have to add this in though: This is not for beginners or (to me) intermediate exercisers. This is very advanced (IMHO)...",1433030400,4,932,4.206703910614525
8564847,4,B00BACDFHC,"I really thought that I shouldn't spend money on yet another workout DVD,but after reading nothing but great reviews,I broke down! I agree with another reviewer that this is unlike anything I own and great for Women's trouble spots. I guess the only workout that I wasn't crazy about was Bikini Bootcamp. It was an intense workout but the instructor just moved way too fast at times that I had to look away and just focus on the move because I was getting all mixed up watching them. As it is,I'm sure I missed reps on every move! I thought some of the moves were similar to my Piloxing dvd but I find that one easier to follow. That's the reason I gave this 4 out of 5 stars. I also didn't care for the Trainer on the Bikini Bootcamp. Like another reviewer said,I have been mixing this in with my Tonique dvd's and the Firm classics and hope to be more toned by Summer. I am 48 and an intermediate to advanced excerciser and find it so hard to tone my lower half.",1430611200,,964,4.244565217391305
8564848,4,B00BACDFHC,"I love intense exercise, but after years of pounding my joints, I can no longer do all the jumping up and down that I used to do. I still love to challenge my body and these Dream Cardio workouts do that perfectly.

Why I love these workouts:

* They are tough! My heart rate gets up there. As a matter of fact, it's as high as when I was jumping up and down like a maniac.

* The new exercises. I have been working out for years, doing heavy weight training, intense cardio and functional fitness. This has been getting old. Let's face it; there are only so many ways you do a bicep curl or a burpee. This series has lots of exercises that I have never seen, so it's a lot of fun.

* I never get bored. I alternate the workouts so there is never a dull moment.

* There is no down time in the workouts. While I know that form is critical, I have no patience for instructors who go on and on and on about form. Just get to the exercise already. This being said, I am meticulous about my form.

* They provide room to grow. Although I consider myself an advanced exerciser, I couldn't keep up with the workouts. I was going about half time to the pace of the workouts.

* All the instructors give a final countdown for each exercise. I am usually dying after the first rep, so it's nice to know that the end of that particular pain, I mean, exercise is coming.

*The cool down stretches are wonderful. It's funny because I feel they skimped on the warm up, but paid a lot of time and attention to the cool down stretches.

There are four things to note about the workouts:

* The pace is manic. I happen to love the pace because it feeds my energy. I wouldn't recommend these workouts for beginners since you may be moving too quickly and your form may suffer. As it was, they were almost one quarter through the next exercise and I was still getting myself set up for that exercise.

* There is no warm-up per se. I work out at 4:30 am and cannot jump into workouts like these, low impact or not. I do a 15 minute light cardio warm-up, using the warm up from a Cathe Friedrich or Amy Bento workout.

* There is no mirror cuing, which makes it a challenge to follow the moves. Most of the time I am using the opposite side than they are, so that I am doing a mirror image of them.

*These aren't for beginners, even though a modifier is showing an easier version of the moves. Even the easier version is hard! I found I could keep up better after completing a 6 month intense barre rotation. My core and my upper body were stronger from this so I was able to do the moves.

My impressions of each workout are as follows:

FUSION MIX with Darby (60 minutes)

This reminded me of a Physique 57 workout on steroids. I thought Tanya Becker was a fast talker, but Darby has her beat. This didn't bother me since I loved the workout.
A stability ball is used for much of the workout. I substituted a 2 pound med ball since I workout in my basement with low ceilings and I can't put the stability ball over my head. You also need light, e.g. 2 pound weights. You work out barefoot.
The hardest exercise in this workout is when you are doing a deep plie squat and then you put one leg off to the opposite side. Needless to say, I couldn't even attempt this without falling over.
My favorite exercise in this workout is the ballet burpee. Basically, you're doing a burpee and when you jump up, you wrap your legs around each other and point your toes.

TABATA & TONING with Francie (45 minutes)

Ack, who knew tabatas without impact could be so hard? And with teeny tiny weights. I was excited, sort of, since I was able to use my cute little pink 1 pound weights. I had bought them as part of a set, but have never really used them since I was doing heavy weight training.

BARRE with Sadie (50 minutes - even though the DVD jacket says 60 minutes)

I love the fact that the first 25 minutes are devoted to upper body. Talk about a big burn! And you are only using 2 pound weights. Well, the Dream Body crew is using those, I had to drop to no weights and I still felt the burn.

BIKINI BOOTCAMP with Amy (60 minutes)

This is my least favorite of the workouts. I just didn't click with Amy as an instructor. I felt she was more of a distraction than a help. While she did provide good form pointers, she would illustrate a move at a completely different tempo and side than her background exercisers and this was very distracting.

Also, the modifier in this workout was on the right; while in all the other workouts, the modifier was on the left. Actually, this modifier didn't do much modifying; Amy had to keep reminding her.

FUSION with Brooke (45 minutes)

Think yoga, Pilates, barre and calisthenics done with plyo moves and light weights. The first 31 minutes use just the light weights. Then you move to an 11 minute routine with the stability and abs and legs. There is a well-deserved 4 minute stretch at the end. Equipment needed: light dumbbells, mat and stability ball.

If you are looking for some fast-paced workouts that will challenge you, this may just be the series for you!",1407283200,6,5086,4.260914760914761
8564849,5,B00BACDFHC,"I am extremely active.  I go to the Y to take classes (ballet barre, strength training, body combat, zumba), walk or run a minimum of 5 times per week.  Each time I work out it is for a minimum of 1 hour and most times more like 2 hours at a time.  So I read a review about this ""Dream Body"" series in Shape magazine and I thought I would give it a try.  The first time I did this I couldn't believe how tough it was for a number of reasons:
1. There is no pausing.  Think you'll have time to grab a sip of water? You won't unless you pause it. After each set of reps for one move they move right into the next and you barely know what happened. Good luck.
2. They move so incredibly fast.  It was hard to keep up.  I mean, who counts that fast? Enough said.
3. I was totally burned out afterwards. Each dvd is 45 or 60 mins and they are INTENSE.  You might want to quit the whole time but when you make it to the end you should pat yourself on the back...if you have enough energy left.

If there is one downside it is that the instructors are a little too...hmm...verbal.  I am not a fan of counting every rep. I would rather just count down the last 3 or 5--not all 15 and not for every move. I am all for instructors being motivating because we all need a little push, right?  This is a little too much at times so I put on motivating music so I can just hear what they have to say and follow along with what they're doing.

So, if you are interested in an extremely challenging set of dvd workouts, definitely consider this one. Know that when you start you should just do as much as you can.  If you have to pause, then pause, but don't quit until the end. Do the modified versions and less reps if you have to.  Trust me that if you want to get your butt kicked, this DVD series will deliver. I think I am almost looking forward to bikini season :)",1394582400,6,1855,3.9783783783783786
8564850,5,B00BACDFHC,"I do yoga, strength training, Jillian's DVDs and run outside when the weather permits. I bought these DVDs to get me through the winter since I haven't been able to run outside with the cold, ice and snow. I have done them all twice and I have to say that they are very challenging and will have your muscles feeling like rubber bands by the end of the workout. I have felt muscles in my body that I didn't think were possible to reach with a workout.

There are some moves in each of the DVDs, especially the first one that I can't do. But I do the moderated version. My favorites are the Bikini Boot Camp and the last Fusion workout.

I would highly recommend these for anyone looking for challenging workouts that burn mega calories.",1391731200,4,736,4.364963503649635
8564851,5,B00BACDFHC,"I love these workouts, they are very challenging but fun at the same time. I find when I use these five DVDs, the time flies by and my workout is over before I know it. Each of the workouts has a slightly different emphasis on a body part and after a few weeks, I noticed that my body was getting very toned and my butt had more lift from doing them. They are difficult and I'm a sweaty mess after them all. I'd advise them to intermediate to advanced exercisers and I would start with the bikini bootcamp workout, I think it is the easiest of them all. These DVDs are a great buy and I hope Dreambody come out with plenty more of these workout DVD sets in the future.",1388188800,6,668,4.106870229007634

I have done Tap Out XT, P90X and Insanity and the Dream Body Workout is more challenging than any one of these.  It is definitely not a work out for beginners as I could not get through all the routines. It works muscles I did not know I had and after only one week, I can feel the difference.  I can't wait to get through several weeks and see the changes in my core and muscle definition.  It is well worth the price and I highly recommend this program!!!!",1385251200,9,599,3.83739837398374

Definitely not for beginners though.",1382140800,7,302,4.592592592592593

I am 10 weeks postpartum and it just isn't realistic for me trying to make it to classes right now. I am now on my 2nd week of the full set. WOW! I purchased these due to great reviews and a few clips I watched. Prior to this I had done P90X for about 3 weeks. These are MUCH more challenging and heart pumping. Prior to my pregnancy I was very active and an avid gym rat. These days I needed something to do at home that would really push me and keep me interested. I have taken every fitness class in the gym, have had personal training and at one point dropped my body fat percentage by 7%, I was in incredible shape. Never have I experienced workouts like these! Each instructor is great and motivating. Each time I want to slow down or quite they motivate you to continue. These would have been tough for me prior to my pregnancy. My first week/the 1st dvd had me doubting myself but I kept pushing and had to modify the workout and take many breaks! I couldn't hold my excitement in when I started my second week and my body was already stronger, granted I am still sweating like I have never sweat before and still taking breaks. There is a ton of room for improvement and no doubt getting a great workout. Each dvd I am dripping in sweat and can feel every muscle aching afterwards. Keep a sweat towel and water close by! I have toned up and feel lifted within the first week and know I'm losing inches. I initially lost 35# quickly after pregnancy & was at a standstill for the remainder weight until now. My husband continues to stare at me and tell me how great I am looking! ""slim & trim"" he says. I am excited to continue these, tone up & lose the rest of my baby weight.
