934479,5,6304861672,"For those who are familiar with the sinking of the Indianapolis and the subsequent court marshal of Captain Charles B. McVay, III , this is a reasonably accurate portrayal. For those who don't know, this is a good place to start. Well presented drama with a good supporting cast.

A simple summary: The Indianapolis delivered integral components of the atomic bomb to Tinian and was bound for Okinawa when she was sunk by a Japanese submarine. This incident caused the greatest loss of men in US Naval history. It also suffered the most shark attacks reported. Families of those who died considered McVay responsible . . . the Navy needed a scapegoat and McVay was convicted of ""hazarding his ship by failing to zigzag.""  Mochitsura Hashimoto (commander of the Japanese sub), testified that 'failing to zigzag' was irrelevant.  Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz remitted McVay's sentence and restored him to active duty. The rest of this story remains a part of Naval history. In October 2000, the United States Congress passed a resolution that Captain McVay's record should state that ""he is exonerated for the loss of Indianapolis."" Too late . . .

Recommended for those with an interest in WWII Naval History and for those who want to learn. Definitely a reasonably accurate presentation with attention to details . . . worth viewing!",1389830400,,1333,4.9641255605381165
934480,4,6304861672,"I'd heard the basics of the USS Indianapolis fiasco long ago, but this film gave me the details.  The Navy's CYA actions were not, sadly, an isolated incident; for it to happen to such an important and (in retrospect) historic mission was particularly galling.

That said, the film lays out the facts in a manner very sympathetic to the Captain and his crew, whose testimony alone lays out the facts.",1388620800,,400,4.7
934481,5,6304861672,What made it great was because it was based on a true story. The acting was authentic and depicted the essence WW2.,1387497600,,115,4.2727272727272725

Very informative of an event occuring toward the end of World War II, highlighting the courage of the crew, and the errors in US Navy policy soon rectified after the fact.  A view of the great tragedy in human conflict that leads to war, and in war all is fair, but after the conflict we must pay the piper for our mistakes.

In Harms Way - (companion book) - Not to be confused with the John Wayne movie ""In Harms Way"" which features the initial phase of WWII in which a heavy cruiser USS Saint Paul, which was actually commissioned after the end of he war is featured.

934483,5,6304861672,"This movie is a very good adaptation of the events surrounding the sinking of the USS Indianapolis. I was impressed with the attention to detail that the producers paid in the movie.  For example, it is known that the ship's doctor burned his hands to the point of uselessness while trying to open a door, and sure enough, this scene was excellently covered in the movie.  Stacy Keach stars as Captain Charles McVay, and he does an excellent job throughout the film.  Richard Thomas portrays the ship's doctor.  The scenes of the sinking and the subsequent struggle to survive on the sea is vividly portrayed.  I was also impressed with the attention payed to the rescue and Captain McVay's court martial.  In fact, this movie does a better job of covering the court martial phase than many of the books I've read on this subject.

934581,5,6304861672,"This movie is very special to me.  I live in New Mexico and visited the trinity site here and learned the history of the Atomic Bomb.
They tested the bomb on my birthday July 16th. Shortly afterwards the USS Indianapolis shipped the bomb materials from San Francisco
to the Tinian Islands and they arrived on July 26th, 10 days after the successful test in New Mexico. The Bombs were prepared and dropped
on Japan on August 6th, 1945, just 21 days after the test. The ship traveled 5688 miles in just 10 day. Thats an average of 568.8 miles a day
at sea to deliver the atomic materials. Amazing what that ship did. I don't understand why they sent the Indianapolis to the Philipines in the first place. In addition, why did they not send any escort ships, they knew the area had Japanese submarines were in the area. the US was considering and invasion to Japan to try and end the war and that would have cost a million American lives. So dropping the bomb was critical to end the war",1455580800,,984,4.406593406593407

On its return voyage to the Philippines, it was sunk by a Japanese submarine. There were over 1,000 crew; around 900 survived the sinking, only to perish from dehydration and sharks. After floating for some 3 days, with too few life rafts, the remaining 300 survivors were spotted by a US seaplane and rescued. Captain McVay was one of the living, only to face a court-martial inquiry over his failure to employ sub evasive techniques, maneuvers commonly employed. McVay eventually was exonerated, but carried the weight of the tragedy for some 20 yrs., committing suicide in 1968.

934676,4,6304861672,"Excellent show from TV on the sinking of the U.S.S. Indianapolis. The ship (cruiser) that delivered the atomic bomb to Tinian. Then, en route to Philippines, was sunk. Commander had used his judgement to NOT zig zag, as was ordered. Apparently, the Navy later forgot it had given discretion to commanders of fast moving ships, like the Indianapolis. The ship simply was doomed by the torpedos of the submarine that got it in it's sights. The NAVY, as hidebound and bureaucratic as any military institution can get ... didn't seem to give much of a damn about looking for the ship that was to become a flagship for some admiral. They just didn't look. And because there was such secrecy over the mission, the ship could not break radio silence. As such, when it went down, the crew (about half new), wasn't well trained nor was the ship well prepared for life boat drills and equipment checks. As the lead character in ""Jaws,"" Quint, the shark man, made the story of the U.S.S. Indianapolis famous ... 900 some men went into the water, many burned, wounded in other ways ... and on day two the sharks began hitting them. Their survival equipment wasn't sufficient to take care of all 900. Many floated all five days in cork water jackets. The cork filled and was saturated ... pulling their heads and necks back until they were staring at the sun all day ... the kapok chaffing their necks severely ... men were flailing around in agony ... and the sharks ... attracted by the vibrations and movement ... came in the hundreds, eating many men alive, or cutting them in pieces, the blood swirling, luring more and more sharks. Men began to hallucinate and drink salt water against medical advice. A few men were strong enough to lead, and take command ... preventing an entire crew from going insane with the effects of salt water. You'll see what happens to Captain McVey for his good intentions. A heart breaking story of the utter sheer stupidity of the U.S. Navy in WW II. The term chickenshit comes to the fore and hopefully, Purgatory saw a load of those naval commanders arrive after their deaths who tried to shove their own blame onto McVey. This was a situation where one asks, as they watch: what would I have done? Could I have survived five days, in the water, without taking so much as a sip? I've had survival experiences myself.
Vietnam. Falling through the ice as a teen. Searching for that hole in the ice frantically. Nearly drowning in the South China Sea, not knowing how to manage the ocean and rip currents ... Breaking an ankle seriously and having to set it, crawl off a mountain ... two motrin ... but I'd learned to pack survival gear. These were brave and good men, on the most part. A few jerks. Out of 900, they sure didn't want to die the way most of them did.
Another example of ultra secrecy keeping 99% of the players in the dark. Compartmented intelligence. It was probably necessary, but the failure of Navy brass to investigate ... had it not been for rogues ... the men of the Indianapolis would've all succumbed in another day or two. A Hoosier myself, I can appreciate the name of the ship. Spielberg did a public service when he injected this story ... Peter Benchley first ... but Spielberg made it all the more real with his movie that galvanized America in that year ... whatever year it was ...

The film stays true to the story but . . .  the acting, the drama, and the special affects were not very compelling.  Stacy Keatch did a passable protrail of the Captain.  All the rest of the characters were  more charactitures of various people on board.  The men were adrift at sea for nearly a week and had suffered from sunburn, saltwater sores, exhaustion, etc.  The make-up done to reproduce these affects was very weak, all of the actors looked like they had just got into the water and not spent 5 days a drift.  The courts martial was almost anti-climatic and should have played a more critical point in the movie.  In fact, had I made the movie, I think I'd have started with the courts martial, emphasized the importance and consequences of same, then revealed the story through flash back.  In short, not a great movie production but at least it stayed true to the facts as I understand them to be.",1405814400,,980,4.4858757062146895
934804,4,6304861672,"1.  There is a big difference between the suffering of the warmongers and their opponents torn out of their ordinary civilian lives into this nightmare spiral NOT of their own making.  The suffering that the crew endured is unimaginable and absolutely unfair and frankly, if we are about to go to war again or if the Whale Warriors are in danger of getting attacked and sunk at sea, we should have cleared the oceans of shark life.

2.  Public opinion absolutely must be ignored - the example of McVay's treatment and only posthumous clearance instructs all of us to understand that injustice in one's lifetime just IS.  Public opinion however undeserved may be intentionally designed against a person and you just have to deal with it.  I disagree with McVay's suicide given the unbelievable suffering of the crew many of whom did everything they could to surivive.  Suicide seems disrespectful.

I think the casting of character actors not necessarily likeable and pleasant was intentional.  It reminds me that they were fellow civilians until December 7, 1941.

The USS Indianapolis does not deserve to be most remembered for the plight of the crew after its sinking.  According to its wikipedia entry, the USS Indianapolis was always hunting the Japanese after Pearl Harbor and always protecting soldiers in the Pacific often engaging Japanese ships and aircraft so the enemy would have marked the USS Indianapolis and especially after their defeat upon learning that the ship delivered the uranium for Litte Boy.  A petty vindictive loser would hunt down the crew related to the atomic bombings so the highly publicized injustice against McVay and his apparent suicide may have been an adequate salve to anyone with stalker tendencies.

The USS Indianapolis and its crew deserve to be remembered for their contribution to the war effort before it was bombed by the Japanese - they were sweethearts - that's what their war record shows.  They didn't deserve to suffer.",1404518400,,2045,4.973529411764706

While it doesn't go into as much detail as the book ""In Harm's Way"" it does a good job of showing the courage of the USS Indianapolis crew and the railroading of a Great captain.

934858,4,6304861672,Outstanding depiction of the failures of the USN to track vessels on secret or sensitive missions.  The Indianapolis was five days late for port before the Navy became concerned.  Tremendous tension when sharks swam in to feed on the sailors in the water.  Good depictions of cowardice and bravery.  The Captain was court-martialed and in a move condemned by many the Court called the commander of the Japanese submarine which sunk the Indianapolis.,1393804800,3,449,5.109589041095891

The ""scapegoating"" of Capt. McVay is supported by books I've read about the incident.  ""Cover Your Backside"" was in effect for those above him and the Navy was and is extremely criticized for the way it handled the issue.  I believe the screenplay and directing of this movie could have been better.  Please remember it is a ""made for TV"" movie and didn't have the big budget that ""Hollywood"" movies have.",1390176000,2,588,4.679611650485437

7878316,2,6304861672,"The story of the U.S.S. Indianapolis is an important piece of history but unfortunately Hollywood got a hold of it. I can forgive some technical errors that don't change the basic facts of the event like the use of the wrong type of seaplane in the movie. (The movie uses a Grumman to stand in for the Catalina PBY). However, adding bits to the storyline such as the initial aborted attack by the Japanese I-58 that didn't occur is a bit much.
The movie version also consolidates the waypoints of the mission (San Francisco, Pearl Harbor, Tinian, Guam, sinking en-rote to Leyte). This is understandable in the interest of simplifying the screenplay but probably could have been told a bit better.
The director couldn't seem to decide if he wanted to shoot a drama based on a historical event OR make a movie about a historical event with some drama included. As a result the story bounces back and forth between a somewhat credible docudrama and bad Hollywood drama. The editing of the movie is also noticeably poor. Portions of the movie that needed to be accelerated were lengthened and portions that needed more detail were cut.  The overall takeaway is a bit disappointing.",1503273600,,1177,4.769607843137255
