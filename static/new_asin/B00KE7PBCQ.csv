6422925,5,B00KE7PBCQ,".ALL I ASK OF YOU,122015
Very like Patrick Wilson's wonderful acting, his nature, kind, witty, unconsciously can close the distance with the audience, is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. One of my favorite works in the first place is the phantom of the opera, is the film I know of him. He's ALL I ASK OF YOU to Amy, memorable! Since then, has been following his work: ""the legal invasion"", ""motherhood"", ""rye"", ""night"", ""violet"", ""latent"" 1, 2, ""spiritism"", and TV play ""a genius"", he created wonderful character, let a person can't forget. I wish he can be in the film industry in 2015, Broadway more brilliant achievements.",1423180800,2,636,4.790909090909091
6422926,1,B00KE7PBCQ,"I watched the first 55 minutes and didn't laugh once. Contrived and stilted, and insulting. At minute 56 I turned it off, good riddance.

You've seen the setup a thousand times, domineering wife with a rich daddy controls milquetoast husband who can't stand up for himself. Husband gets seduced by gorgeous new hire at husbands furniture store and maybe the hilarity flew from that point, I don't know.",1423094400,3,402,4.911764705882353
6422927,2,B00KE7PBCQ,"I'm a fan of both Wilson and Heigl so even after watching the 3 star trailer for this film, I couldn't help myself.  Huge mistake.  I would sell mine to you for half price if I could.  Total Ying & Yang movie - the plot is vanilla, lame and thoughtless, while the acting is so over the top, exaggerated and loud that I ended up feeling incredibly sorry for these 2 as they were clearly either very desperate or way oversold when they signed on.  I'm typically a gracious grader, particularly when watching something that generally sucks but gives me my favorite cast fix.  Consider my 2 stars generous here, but I truly hope others have a better experience than me!",1423008000,5,665,4.462809917355372

6422930,5,B00KE7PBCQ,"This scintillating black comedy about a married couple where the wife rules the house is refreshing hilarity.  Katherine Heigl is cast as Mona Champagne, a ball-breaking wife who denies her husband sex unless she has scheduled coitus on her calendar.  Patrick Wilson is simply brilliant as Heigl's milquetoast husband Don Champagne who runs a furniture store.  He hires a drop-dead gorgeous saleslady, Dusty (Jordana Brewster of ""The Fast and the Furious""), with whom he winds up in an extramarital affair until she informs him that she is pregnant.  As it turns out, Dusty works as an accomplice to two murderous meth head desperadoes, Murphy (A.J. Buckley of ""Zombie Hamlet"") and Freeman (Kevin McKidd of ""Trainspotting""), and they plan to blackmail Don.  In an earlier scene, we saw Murphy and Freeman take advantage of another man who appears to be dead.  Anyway, Don's one and only employee before he hired the sexually outgoing Dusty, Les (Jim Belushi of ""Red Heat""), decided to give her $13-thousand dollars.  Don's paranoia about the consequences of his affair prompts him to throw himself on the mercy of Mona, and she concocts a scheme whereby she is administer a Mickey Finn into Dusty's drink when the latter comes to see Don about the money.  Naturally, Don is frightened at the prospect of Dusty dying from Mona's drink.  Don is marginally relieved when Dusty revives just long enough for Mona to slug her with a hammer.  Afterward, Mona dons a gown and cuts Dusty's corpse up with a wood-working appliance.  She luxuriates in the splatter of Dusty's blood as she mutilates her lifeless body.  Later, she has Don drive her over to Dusty's trailer where she stuffs Dusty decapitated head in the freezer.  While she is shoving Dusty's body parts into the fridge, Freeman and a hooker surprise her while she is in the trailer. Mona displays no qualms about taking a samurai sword away from the witless girl and skewering her with it like a shish kebab.  The dim-witted Freeman doesn't recognize Mona for a moment and she stabs him repeatedly with a knife until he crumples into his own pool of blood.  Murphy is considerably upset when he comes home to the trailer and finds Freeman and the girl sliced and diced in their own reservoirs of blood.  Emerging triumphant from her double-murder, Mona warns their gay neighbors about their frisky little dog that encroaches on the Champagne's home.  She threatens to kill the little doggie if it ever ventures back onto their premises.  One evening while they are preparing to bed, Mona warns Don that she has two deadly knives in her bedside cabinet that she will wield to carve him up if he displeases her.  A shocked Don doesn't know what to do until he finds the poor little doggie in their own freezer, and he comes up with a plan to kill his wife that reminded me of the Michael Caine black comedy ""A Shock to the Systerm"" where he rigged up a booby trap that will electrocute his wife.  Don fixes it so that the lightning fixture in their garage will spark up when she switches it on, and the gas leaking from two propane container will ignite.  As Don is walking away from a party at their residence, the entire garage blows up.

Director Anthony Burns and scenarists Carlo Allen, Ted Elrick, and Tom Lavagnino have created a flawlessly funny film that benefits from a light touch.  Katherine Heigl is cute and clever as the overbearing wife who emasculates her husband without a qualm.  She treats their son with equal contempt and dotes on her brainy daughter.  Watching Heigl relish the prospect of cutting up a corpse is something that you don't always seen this lightweight comic pull off with her tongue-in-cheek.  Burns and company never make a error in plotting the downfall of not only Dusty but also Murphy's accomplices.  Everything is done with a wink and ""Home Sweet Hell"" lives up to its title and is a drastic change of pace for Heigl. If you are a Heigl fan, you don't want to miss ""Home Sweet Hell.""",1493424000,2,3980,4.738751814223512

6423010,3,B00KE7PBCQ,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Don Champagne (Patrick Wilson) seems to have it all. He has wonderful children, a business that is booming, an attractive wife and a gorgeous home. Then again perhaps this ideal life is too perfect. Everything runs on a schedule, all planned out with preciseness by his perfectionist wife Mona (Katherine Heigl). Even their love life is planned out to the precise day and time.

All of that changes when Don hires a hot young salesgirl named Dusty (Jordana Brewster). Soon he begins having an affair with Dusty thats filled with little more than lust fueled moments behind closed doors. When Dusty informs him that shes now pregnant, Don finds himself in over his head. As if most of us didn't see that coming far in advance.

In reality Dusty isn't pregnant at all. Instead this is a scam shes set up to make money off of Don in an attempt to get away from her abusive boyfriend and his partner, both of who set her up to do this job. What none of them counted on was dealing with Mona.

After discovering what has been going on Mona does what every perfectionist housewife does. She tells Don that he has to kill Dusty. The insecure and backboneless Don has no clue how to accomplish this so Mona has to help, giving him a drug filled bottle of champagne to have Dusty drink so that shell be unconscious when it all happens.

In what becomes a comedy of errors the whole thing doesnt quite turn out as planned and the folks who should be considered the good guys take on the role of bad as the film progresses. No doubt a dark comedy from start to finish the movie has its moments but on the whole is not likely to be one of the more memorable films youll ever witness. There are laughs at various moments but not enough to make this a stand out comedy. It makes it easy to see why this one went straight to video.

Wilson does a fine job as Don here as does Heigl in the role of Mona. But neither of them turn in what would be considered Oscar worthy performances. Perhaps thats in part to the roles that they both have. They seem more cartoonish than realistic which makes their willingness to kill someone less sinister than it should. Heigl as Mona does a great job as a cold hearted witch but still, her calmness through all of this makes you wonder just what she did prior to the events of the film.

In the end this is not a terrible movie but not a great one either. Mediocre is a word best suited for this one which is sad as it becomes just another in the long list of films Heigl has starred in that have found their way to that description. I say sad because honestly I think shes a much better actress than the movies shes been given to date. Heres hoping that things change for the better for her. As for Wilson, hes already moved on to better films.",1440547200,3,2822,4.313207547169811

6423017,5,B00KE7PBCQ,"This is a nice dark comedy, I had my doubts with Katherine Heigl being in it, I wondered if she could play a different character, as she normally plays pretty much the same one over and over again, but those fears weren't warranted at all, she's brilliant in Home Sweet Hell.  She plays a more intense version of Bree from Desperate Housewives who organises every little aspect of hers and her husband's life.  Patrick Wilson says it best in the extras, ""She doesn't just wear the pants in their household, she wears the whole outfit.""  If her kids misbehave she destroys their toys and makes them watch, she schedules intercourse with her husband six times a year and controls and belittles every aspect of his life.  You could point out if she was a guy doing this sort of thing to a wife it wouldn't be acceptable but you've seen both actors in a heap of things so you know it's all fiction. I also liked how their kids are also emulating their parents relationship with the girl (played by Zoo's Madison Wolfe) behaving similarly to her brother (Aiden Flowers).  This is a dark comedy, people do die in it.  If you didn't like Heathers, Very Bad Things, Big Nothing, Horrible Bosses, Fargo, Death at a Funeral, Lillyhammer, Keeping Mum or other movies and TV shows like those, then Home Sweet Hell probably isn't the movie for you.  However if you loved any of those, you won't go wrong with this one.

The only thing I didn't like about this film was the ambiguous ending we only hear and don't see behind the black screen with the credits on it.  Either outcomes works for the movie but why not have filmed that too?",1439078400,2,1622,4.508532423208191

6423022,5,B00KE7PBCQ,"Wasn't prepared for this twist on the happy, white, middle class, family storyline. I was leaning towards another redundant rom-com (Hollywood not N.Y. style) and should have paid attention to the knife on the DVD cover. It seems, and there's a bit of assuming in this, that 9 out 10 one star ratings come from females and/or families with little ones surprised (upset even) that this film turned out to be a bloody dark comedy. Perhaps hitting too close to home that one of there own should have such a nasty disposition.
Leaving aside personal taste I was surprised at how well written, acted and twisty this turned out. Not having any personal connection with an urban/suburban white middle class lifestyle I did not feel violated or offended.
We have a super competitive, scrapbook, goal setting obsessive-compulsive mom with an acquiescent former used car, now furniture salesman (2nd & 3rd most ridiculed professions, behind lawyers) dad with two polar opposite kids (reflecting their parents, of course).

Corny, unfunny, and lagging.  The actors are all great.  But the story is crap.  It's not ""darkly funny"" at all.  The only thing that goes ""dark"" is your brain while watching this.  The only ""funny"" part is the end, when you all get together and make fun of the movie.

There are more characters to hate than root for in this slush pile jumper.  And the story drags on till the ""So what?"" and ""Why are we watching this?"" comments get way too plentiful.

6423059,4,B00KE7PBCQ,"My friend Bryan recommended that I watch Home Sweet Hell, thinking that I would enjoy it. He was absolutely correct.
This movie is a twisted little black comedy about a man who cheats on his frigid, OCD wife with a woman he hires to work in his furniture store...a woman he believes is sincerely sweet and genuinely interested in him as a man. The affair goes sideways and his life spirals out of control when his wife becomes aware of the situation. That is as close as I can get to sharing spoilers, aside from the fact that anyone who saw the trailers for the movie is already aware that the wife informs her unfaithful spouse that the only solution is for him to kill the woman he had been having the affair with...so that part should be no surprise.
Patrick Wilson manages to succeed in coming across as the bumbling, panic prone, jackass of a husband without any difficulty, but the true star of this movie is Katherine Heigl. This was a very different role for Katherine Heigl...and she pulls it off exceedingly well. I never really felt one way or another about her as an actress, but I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by her performance here.
This was an entertaining movie, no question about that. I like this sort of movie though, this sort of dark humor is just my kind of thing...though I tend to prefer things that go a little bit more perverse and a bit darker in my comedy, this one manages to satisfy.",1431561600,,1432,4.448669201520913

But when Dusty tries to extort money from Don  or she'll tell his unstable, control freak wife, Mona (Heigl), about their affair  Don caves and informs Mona himself. With the frosty Mona's help, the tables are turned on Dusty and things go very bad very quickly. Not to mention very preposterously. The result is a muddle of tired themes, bad behaviors and gruesome set pieces....it was fun to watch...that's it!",1427328000,,557,5.043478260869565

Perfection begins to waver when Don hires a new saleswoman. This is a funny but very dark comedy. I enjoyed it but this is not a movie for everyone. From everything I have heard about Katherine Heigle in the news this seems like the perfect part for her. There really isn't a whole lot to say about this movie other than that. If you like dark comedies like Tucker and Dale or Very Bad Things you will like this. The movie isn't all that original and the cast really makes it better than it is.

6423262,2,B00KE7PBCQ,"Don't worry, I'll keep it short. HOME SWEET HELL is yet another movie that doesn't live up to its trailer. I do like films about psycho killers and maniacs, and films that have weird/awkward tones. This film has those things, but the writing lets it down massively. I can abide unlikeable and unsympathetic characters (which this movie is filled with), but there was no attempt to deepen them in any way. As such, you're given a bunch of walking, talking cliches that you don't care about one bit. As far as the plot and concept goes, it's a pretty cool one. You have Katherine Heigl playing to her strengths as a cold, manipulative [insert preferred derogatory term for females] who is wife to one of the most weak-minded, ineffectual husbands ever put to film (played by Patrick Wilson). When a workplace dalliance comes back to bite him in the rear, his wife basically forces him to get rid of the problem. To be fair, I was along for the ride until the point at which this occurs. After that, you have a ridiculous subplot involving some lowlifes that didn't really need to be part of the story. And the ending was rather crass, even for the semi-satirical material, not to mention open-ended in a way that it didn't need to be. To the film's credit, I did enjoy the performances by Patrick Wilson and Katherine Heigl. Jordana Brewster did a decent job, but was better as eye-candy than an actual character. Even Jim Belushi shows up for several scenes, although his character wasn't that well-written either. When it comes down to it, I would have liked something with a little more satirical bite and a little less overt sexism and misogyny (neither of which are treated in *wink wink* fashion). Overall, HOME SWEET HELL has a few good moments but still manages to squander a rather cool concept and the talents of its cast.",1425513600,,1830,4.651234567901234

She has their life planned and keeps a scrap book ""goal book"" which she reads religiously. If by some stupid chance you peeked at the DVD cover, you know she will do anything to keep her life on an even keel. However, there appears a boat rocker to her plans. Our happy couple has sex 6 times a year and only when it is on the calendar. Don hires major league babe Dusty (Jordana Brewster - I need to watch D.E.B.S. again.) who throws herself at him causing blackmail complications that can only have the expected final solution. ""There is ever only my way.""

Yes. this is another quirky housewife psycho killer film, most of which were a bit better, which is not to say this wasn't entertaining. The kids provided a good side story of competing siblings with the boy Andrew (Aiden Flowers) losing out to Alison (Madison Wolfe) to the dismay of dad. They needed to have one or two mores scenes with the kids to make for a good subplot and to help establish character and maybe bring out that which we may not speak, because gutting and dismemberment is an option.

Would make for an excellent rental or one to add to your nice quirky killer collection. People who like this film might want to check out ""Miss Meadows.""
