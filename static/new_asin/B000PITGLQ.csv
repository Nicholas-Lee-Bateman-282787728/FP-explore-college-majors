8191903,5,B000PITGLQ,"I enjoyed this video so much that I really wish Mr. Gentile would do another one (or many) to follow it.  I appreciate his practical teaching style and the attentention to detail explaining how to do the various exercises.  This video really starts with the basics including balance, breathing and gentle smooth movements to build your strength, especially important for those of us who are really out of shape.  Thank you for a great video.",1208563200,4,441,4.8533333333333335

8191905,5,B000PITGLQ,"This is an excellent DVD with easy to follow instructions for all ages. In particular, this DVD allows those with limited range of motion to actively particpate and improve body flexibility, balance and strengthen the body's core. This training DVD is filmed and edited very well - all movements are viewed from various angles so that you can see and understand and apply the movements to yourself. I liked this DVD so much that I purchased it for my retired parents.",1177632000,9,467,4.777777777777778
