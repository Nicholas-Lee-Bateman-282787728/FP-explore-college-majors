8060408,5,B0009GV9K0,This dvd is a pretty comprehensive  look at  this style of playing. The instructor is easy  to follow and the pace is reasonable enough so that anyone who is experienced  isn't completely bored; but beginners are able to get a grasp at the same time.,1396396800,,250,4.488888888888889
8060409,2,B0009GV9K0,"I've gotten a lot out of Fred Sokolow's other titles. He usually spends a lot of time breaking down fingering, picking technique, etc., in his beginner videos. Not so here. One gets the sense that slide isn't really his bag.

Also, the first song, ""Little Red Rooster,"" doesn't really sound like any of the well known versions, like the Howlin Wolf single. With just a touch more beginner technique, you can make it sound like the single, but instead we get a very generic I-IV-I-V-IV-I slide blues. You can find better on YouTube.",1367193600,,531,4.709677419354839
8060410,2,B0009GV9K0,"Fred Sokolow is a good player, but a poor teacher. The lessons pretty much go like this: ""Here's a song, now you play it."" No technique. No fingering. No parsing to show construction. The songs are good, however, so if you are able to learn by watching near full tempo playing without much help, you might get something out of this DVD.",1329350400,3,336,4.435483870967742
8060411,5,B0009GV9K0,"I have checked out other DVDs on learning slide guitar, and this one seems the most straightforward. Nice, calm, low-key teaching by Sokolow, with several good slide tunes taught. Nice and basic, yet lots taught here.",1216857600,3,217,5.055555555555555
