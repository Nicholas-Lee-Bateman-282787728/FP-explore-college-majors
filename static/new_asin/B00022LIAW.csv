2056547,4,B00022LIAW,"This is a really fun Roy film. Its one of his rare historically set movies and has a good script, good production values and a top supporting cast. If you aren't into the more musical and modern Roy movies you will like this one.",1247356800,3,229,4.2272727272727275

2056568,4,B00022LIAW,"A nicely packaged B-western from Goodtimes.  The picture image is average for a B-western.  The stated running time of 64 minutes includes the 4 - 5 minutes of conversation at the beginning of the DVD, and the 5 - 6 minutes of conversation after the movie ends.  Roy and Dale visit with son Roy Jr. and tell family stories.  The movie runs 53 - 54 minutes out of the original running time of 59 minutes.

The ""Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Biography"" runs about 23 minutes, and the ""Sidekicks Feature"" runs about 18 minutes.  They both consist of Roy and Dale talking about their lives, with additional comments from family members, and remembering their sidekicks.  These two extras are identical to those on another Goodtimes release, ""Heart of the Rockies"".  Therefore, I assume they are the same on all of the Rogers films in this series of  Goodtimes DVDs.

In ""Heart of the Rockies"", the guest is Eddie Dean in the two periods of conversation.  Nice to see Eddie and how good a singing voice he still had at age 80 when this was produced in 1987.

The movie itself is a nice example of Rogers' early action movies before he drifted farther into the ""Showbiz"" type of singing western.  The movie is short by 5 or 6 minutes, so may have some songs cut out.  The story moves right along.  Interesting to see Henry Brandon as the villain.  You may best remember Brandon in a later role as the Indian chief Scar, whom John Wayne pursues in the classic western, ""The Searchers"".  Jacqueline Wells has a solid role as the lady wagonmaster out to avenge the death of her father.

A funny but politically incorrect bit has Gabby Hayes arguing with Si Jenks over who has the most Indian scalps, and they check their bags and count them.

I give this four stars out of five.  Would be five but for the shortened running time and only average picture image.",1443830400,,1847,4.522658610271903

2056585,2,B00022LIAW,"The Ranger and the Lady, 1940 film

The Santa Fe Trail ran from the Missouri river through the Republic of Texas to the ancient city of Santa Fe in New Mexico. There is a toll on those who travel through Texas. Miss Jenny Tabor plans to avoid the toll. Captain Colt intervenes to question the tariff. Texas needs funds, General Larue placed a toll on freight wagons that carried manufactured goods. The General has big plans to tax wagons outside of Texas. Gabby has a collection of scalps. There is a bet over shooting! [This tells about the cultural outlook.] There is conflict over taxes on trade goods. Captain Colt executes his orders and takes Miss Jenny to meet General Larue. There is a song at night. Larue and Jenny Tabor talk about joining forces, giving her a monopoly on all trade! Colt objects to this. Larue tells Colt to stay away. The Tabor Company buys out the other traders at half-price.

There is shooting when Captain Colt guides a freight train without paying the toll. An injured man is brought to Bent's Fork for treatment. Colt learns more about Tabor. Her father was framed and shot for treason by Larue. Larue gets Colt and takes him along. Can they get help? Larue declares Colt is guilty of treason! Jane goes to the forge to make a duplicate key and meets Gabby. They go to Larue's office. Gabby fights the guard. They must warn Sam Houston about the ambush. There is a chase, Colt gets away to warn Houston in time. There is shooting and another chase. Larue learns Houston has arrived. Jenny helps to stop Larue! The good guys win. Miss Burton tells Houston what she learned. Houston will take corrective action.

The video on this version was very poor (faded), but not the audio. The ""Original Story"" was written by Bernard McConville; it uses names from history but not much else. The weapons used date from the 1870s, not the 1830s or 1840s. But this is not historically accurate. Its point is to question official records. Were you convinced? This is probably the worst movie in this series.",1410393600,,2029,4.6305555555555555

2056588,5,B00022LIAW,DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM A SINGING COWBOY GENRE FILM.  THIS FILM HAS CLASS AND A GOOD STORY WITH NO NONSENSE.  ROY ROGERS PORTRAYS A STAND UP AND RIGHTEOUS TEXAS RANGER CAPTAIN WITH GABBY HAYES AS HIS SERGEANT WHO NEVER LEAVES HIS SIDE.  THERE IS A LOVE INTEREST THAT PORTRAYS A STERN FEMALE CHARACTER WITH A SPECIAL INTEREST IN THE SITUATION WHO RESISTS ROY ROGERS CHARACTER.  VERY ENTERTAINING MOVIE THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH OVER AND OVER.,1401840000,3,453,4.69620253164557
2056589,3,B00022LIAW,"One of the best performances I have seen by Roy Rogers. This is a good good guy vs. bad guy western, complete with a saucey bad, good woman. Good shoot'em ups, chases and an exception wagon race. Worth the watch.",1400716800,,212,4.325
8020680,5,B00022LIAW,A excellent looking copy of the film from Paramount who now owns the Republic library. I'm so bummed that most of the great Republic prints have been scrapped on the service.
