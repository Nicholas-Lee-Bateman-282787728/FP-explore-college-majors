8679656,4,B00NPBHZTA,"While I will admit that reviewer William Amazzini's comments for this film are spot-on, I still have a wacky like for this stogie, inane Euro Western. The mish-mash VERA CRUZ, MAGNIFICENT SEVEN sorting out of redemptive value among swindlers, gunmen and killers almost works. I really liked Nicol in previous outings, especially Mann's THE MAN FROM LARAMIE, but his over the top rants here could grate on some. The camera work is solid if uneventful and the locations are impressive and look very good in wide-angle scope format. The audio is a little muffled, sometimes too low, then too high. I found myself adjusting volume levels just a little too often...Still, it's an action-packed ride with lots of quarreling, double crossing and back stabbing and the shootout finale delivers in spades!
This is certainly a pre-Leone curio done in the very 50s American Western style, helmed by the competent Roy Roland with a script by Borden (RED RIVER, WINCHESTER 73) Chase. Just take it for what it is, a low budget early Euro-Western made in the Hollywood style, full of stock characters and situations, with some excessive over-acting and lots of great location shooting, and a slam-bang shootout that notches up any reviewer's rating....and by the way, Aldo Sambrell makes one his early Spaghetti Western appearances here as a Mexican bandit leader and he's as great as ever from the get-go.
Certainly recommended viewing for fans of such stuff, like myself, and most likely whoever is even bothering to read a review for a film titled GUNFIGHTERS OF CASA GRANDE.",1436313600,2,1563,5.015384615384615

8679662,3,B00NPBHZTA,"Here is a perfect example of what the Euro Western would have looked like if not for the vision of Director Sergio Leone who kick started it into a new, innovative direction.  Director Roy Rowland's 'GUNFIGHTERS OF CASA GRANDE' aka 'PISTOLEROS DE CASA GRANDE '-1964 is a US/Spanish co-production with all the trimmings of a dull, 'B' oater of the fifties.  An outlaw wins a cattle ranch in a poker game which fuels his plan of consolidating his cattle with the area ranchers cattle thereby selling them to the US for rip-off prices and then sharing the spoils with his gang.  His plans go awry when a Mexican bandit and his gang decide to spoil the party and the usual gunfight ensues.  It all sounds better on paper for it takes a good deal of dull talk and dated shenanigans between the actors to finally come to the climactic shootout  (60 minutes to be exact) .  The reason the film is lacklustre is due to the cast.  Alex Nichol is cast as the lead which is wrong because Nichol cannot carry the film and since he's such a sleaze bucket, its hard to relate to him.  Nichol was great as the villain in Director Anthony Mann's classic 'THE MAN FROM LARAMIE'-1955 and would also direct some films and TV shows including 'THE SCREAMING SKULL'1958 but here he is just a loud mouth braggart.  The great Aldo Sambrell who would grace many a Spaghetti Western including his best role in Director Sergio Corbucci's 'NAVAJO JOE' aka 'UN DOLLARO A TESTA'-1966 glides through his Mexican bandito villainy in a cranky mood looking like he doesn't want to be there.  This is all the fault of Director Roy Rowland who's career was peppered with minor gems including 'THE 5000 FINGERS OF DR. T'-1953.  His stagy set ups and wooden camera movement really tests the audiences patience.  The script is by Borden Chase who gave the Western genre some true classics including Director Anthony Mann's 'WINCHESTER 73'-1950 and Director Robert Aldrich's 'VERA CRUZ'-1954 but here its just a routine outing.  Fans will spot Euro actors Antonio Mayans and the beautiful Diana Lorys who both worked with Director Jess Franco. The quality of the release is the reason for the 3 stars.  Warner Archive releases it in a nice 2.35 DVD-R with no extras.  For Euro Western completists only.",1414022400,5,2262,4.7055837563451774
