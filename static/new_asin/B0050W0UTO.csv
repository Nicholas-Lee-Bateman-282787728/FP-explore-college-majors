4518524,4,B0050W0UTO,"I was looking for another yoga DVD to mix up my routine.  This DVD is very good because each day is a different yoga technique.  Each day builds from the day before. I think this DVD is really good for variety and different yoga techniques.  Its well rounded and diverse, not boring.",1325721600,2,283,4.403846153846154
4518525,5,B0050W0UTO,"I had a recent hip injury in an accident and my Physical Therapist wanted me to do yoga.  YUK!  I was never a yoga fan!!  Well, I gave in and bought this Rodney Yee 20 minute hip opener DVD and not only do I enjoy it, but it has helped my hip tremendously.  I am now a Rodney Yee fan and can tolerate 20 minutes of yoga!!",1323820800,2,321,3.746268656716418
4518526,5,B0050W0UTO,I have many of Rodney Yee's workouts and absolutely love them. They are easy to follow and very relaxing to the mind while being a great work out for the body. His routines always manage to be different no matter how many of them you have. Great for the person who prefers to practice at home or simply for those days you can make it to class. I've been using these dvds for years and cannot recommend these Dvd's enough.,1319760000,4,421,4.275
4518527,5,B0050W0UTO,I have enjoyed Rodney Yee for years and usually use A.M. Yoga with its five different workouts.  This is a nice addition to my collection of all his DVDs.  A wonderful way to loosen up and energize for each day.,1319673600,3,211,4.25
4518528,3,B0050W0UTO,"The obvious disclaimer in reviewing yoga DVDs is the style of yoga and level of difficulty will vary so widely amongst users. Having said that, I feel this might serve well as an introduction to various styles of yoga. To mix cultural metaphors, this is a yoga smorgasbord. And if you need occasional variety in your home practice it will offer something ""different"" since each of the five practices is just that - quite different from each other.

I might have endorsed a higher rating, but frankly I am a bigger fan of Rodney Yee himself than when he has other instructors featured in some segments. I have never found any of them to have quite the same engaging style or useful tone in terms of clear focus on executing the poses well. So I like Rodney Yee discs for Rodney's yoga - not when he is Ed Sullivan introducing other people's yoga.

I have 4 of his discs and my favorite by far is ""A.M. Yoga."" Five very nice vinyassa style practices, all 20-minute each which happens to be perfect for me. I know GAIAM is naturally into marketing and trying to come up with new incarnations of Rodney Yee discs, but frankly I would love another disc EXACTLY like ""A.M. Yoga."" While sequels may not always work in Hollywood, I think it would work with ""A.M. Yoga."" There are MANY other Rodney Yee discs for people who want something else, but GAIAM should consider another discs of Rodney Yee himself filmed in a beautiful setting doing 20-minute vinyassa practices.",1317168000,215,1463,4.601532567049809
4518529,4,B0050W0UTO,"Another DVD of Rodney Yee with 5 practices for each day of the week, this time each day is a different type of yoga (sort of). The first is Iyengar (25 min.) where Rodney instructs Colleen on some basic yoga poses, a lot of good alignment tips but if you've been in a few Iyengar classes you probably don't need it. The second day is vinyasa (22 min.) and instructed by Colleen, this is my favorite, it's a nice flow with a variety of poses like marichiasana 1, prasarita with a twist,parivrtta janu sirsasana, wild thing pose (variation of side plank) which is the peak pose,
tabletop & bridge. Third practice is core (18 min.) and has typical Rodney Yee light core exercises with a lot of forward bends. Fourth is Ashtanga (25 min.) and it is mostly sun salutations with the last 10 minutes being most of the standing pose series (triangle, revolved triangle, side angle ,revolved side angle, prasarita, pursvotanasana).
Fifth day is restorative which is more meditative and it's not much of a practice, he does child pose, forward bending in easy crossed legged position and a long shavasana. I didn't understand why the first and last practices weren't filmed in an outdoor set as the rest of the practices, it was kind of a boring and depressing, the outdoor set is o.k but it's not beautiful as the other Rodney Yee DVD's, seems like it was filmed at the driest and least fertile spot of a very beautiful place. Overall , I think it would be good for beginners\low intermediates.",1315180800,54,1485,4.628787878787879
4518530,5,B0050W0UTO,Rodney Yee is such a great instructor. I love this set of 5 different yoga practices each one works on a different area of my body and helps me stay interested in my daily routine. While still challenging me to get even more out of my workout.,1461024000,,243,4.191489361702128
4518531,5,B0050W0UTO,"I had a previous copy of this DVD that quit working, and it's one of my favorites so I replaced it. It has some excellent short routines on it.

4518535,5,B0050W0UTO,Love Rodney Yee! I have his AM Yoga for the Week and needed to switch it up a little. The Daily Yoga provides some more challenging poses and is more fluid. I can feel where I have been working different muscles.,1447718400,,212,4.195121951219512

4518548,2,B0050W0UTO,I have purchased 3 Rodney Yee dvd's and REALLY wanted to love them because I believe Gaiam is a trusted yoga brand and all of the great reviews online. I think his DVD's are good for beginners however I don't find the flow or instruction to be as beneficial as other online tutorials including P90X and of course in person classes which there is probably no substitute for. If I had purchased this before practicing yoga for 7 years I probably would've loved it.,1422576000,,462,4.511904761904762

4518551,1,B0050W0UTO,"Too many commercials-too much instruction and not enough yoga.
There are about 2 minutes of yoga to 20 minutes of dvd-not much if any of a workout.
Usually I feel great and like I have accomplished a good workout after many other yoga
dvd's-this one I feel like I wasted my time.
Very much beginner-even then no workout.",1417737600,5,320,4.5344827586206895

4518559,4,B0050W0UTO,Some days you just can't or don't want to do an hour or two of yoga but you still want to do a practice. For those days there are only a few options and this is a fun one because there are 5 varieties of yoga. the first sequence of yoga is explained in so much detail that you will feel some new stretching and space and ease even if you are very experienced with yoga. its interesting to go back to the basics and try them again with emphasis. Clear poses with clear intent.,1410480000,,475,4.010526315789473
4518560,4,B0050W0UTO,"5 different practices, each with a different focus.  Follow them in order or choose the practice that fits your mood or your energy level.
I initially started out following them in order.  However, I have been practicing for about 13 years, and I prefer Vinyasa or Hatha; I have been blessed with instructors who focused on form, so I found the Iyengar session at this point in my practice, too slow. In fact, after the first few minutes of that session, I switched to another segment.  However, for someone who is beginning his/her practice, I think the Iyengar session is valuable to reinforce proper form so that the practice is enjoyable and not uncomfortable or painful.

I have several of Rodney Yee's DVDs, and I personnally like his well modulated voice and how he cues the poses.  I noticed one of the other reviewers had a comment about Colleen's voiceover and her poses being off sync; most of the time I follow the voice instruction, but a few times when I wasn't clear and wanted to confirm the pose, I checked the DVD, and she was ahead of the voice instruction.  It was not off by much; If you've been practicing, it's not too much of a problem, but if you're starting out, it might be confusing.",1410134400,2,1211,4.557603686635945

4518562,2,B0050W0UTO,"I am a huge fan of Rodney Yee, however - I think this will be the last DVD I buy of his.  I have about 6 or 7 of his DVDs, and my absolute favorite is A.M.Yoga.  I perform this almost daily and was looking for this to ""change things up.""  However, I find this DVD simply annoying.  Maybe it is because I do not appreciate the Southern Baptist ""sell"" and the constant talking - it is as if his voice was too soothing and some P.R. person said jazz it up.  Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breath out.  I feel like saying ""stop drinking the starbucks and be quiet!  Let me enjoy the moment and let me feel my breath move through my body!""
A.M Yoga has the option to allow minimal instruction.  I wish this video did.",1407974400,3,718,4.078571428571428
4518563,5,B0050W0UTO,"You can't go wrong with any Rodney Yee product. I've bought his books and his DVDs and have learned and benefitted from them all.

4518566,5,B0050W0UTO,"I have a growing collection of yoga DVDs that I practice with, many of which are Rodney Yee, and this one is one of my go-to favorites, especially when I'm pressed for time. There are 5 different practices on the DVD, which range fron 15-25 minutes each. It also features a pose training session, which demonstates form for beginners. I highly recommend this video.",1399680000,,365,4.71875
4518567,5,B0050W0UTO,I have a number of Rodney Yee's yoga work-outs and am never disappointed.  This one is nice in that you can choose how long you want your work-out to be by doing only one or adding to it and mixing it.,1397779200,,201,3.902439024390244
4518568,5,B0050W0UTO,Anything Yee puts out is good...short simple home yoga routines!  Like the 5 in 1 DVD Set....GOOD JOB Rodney Yee,1396915200,,112,4.6
4518569,4,B0050W0UTO,Favorite one on here is the strengthen your core routine.  I have the core cross train which is 30 minutes but the strengthen your core is only 18 minutes and is definitely a good core workout in that amount of time.  The other routines aren't too bad either.,1395100800,,259,4.375
4518570,5,B0050W0UTO,Great if you are new to Yoga. Good stretching and relaxing poses.  Good core segment that I will keep in my core strengthening regimen. Each workout is short enough to fit in to a busy schedule.,1392336000,,194,4.388888888888889
4518571,1,B0050W0UTO,"We already bought your dvd, stop excessively advertising.  I cannot skip the annoying ads Gaiam has on this dvd.  There is more introductory information and product pushing than actual yoga.  Love Rodney Yee, hate Gaiam.",1391990400,3,220,5.228571428571429
4518572,5,B0050W0UTO,"When I started having back pains about five years ago, I got this video to help out.  It has been a wonderful help.  I love the quick 20-25 minute sessions and the fact that you get a different workout every day.",1390521600,,212,4.146341463414634
4518573,1,B0050W0UTO,"I love Rodney's earlier dvd's that would have voice-over instruction as I did my practice. This one had too much instruction, not enough yoga. Go back to your old format, Rodney. And no offense, but I don't care to have your wife, Colleen Saidman in your videos.",1390262400,3,262,4.595744680851064
4518574,4,B0050W0UTO,"I don't know a lot about yoga, but this DVD seems to offer a few different levels of yoga practice along with a nice balanced workout.

4518575,5,B0050W0UTO,"I have admired Rodney's work for over 18 years.
I used to do yoga for abs when my son was 1 years old(he is now 19) and I was home working.
We would lay on a mat and I would go throw the video and he would play, watch and try on his own.

I have bought yoga for abs and daily yoga to reconnect with Rodneys ability to teach me peacefully and throughly.

Thank you Rodney for all that you have brought to my life and I am happy you have found such invigorating love in your life.

4518579,4,B0050W0UTO,"I have been doing rodney's 2 beginner's dvd for a year now. They were my introduction to yoga and I am hooked. I love his style.

I felt like those workout had taken me as far as they could, so I looked for a new routine. None of his dvd's seemed to be called intermediate, or second level from beginner or such. I liked the idea of this one having a variety of different routines for the week..less monotony!! I read the reviews and thought it was worth a chance since most people indicated that it was too easy.

BUT, aside from the first (and last) routine they are waaaay out of my ability!!! I can't keep up the pace or even do half of the 2nd, 3rd and fourth routines. I am hopeful that once I get the routine down, the poses will get easier, but for now i just flop around on the floor panting.
I really wish there was an intermediate routine fro folks like me. But I will keep doing this one and enjoying the challenge.",1384214400,2,927,4.144444444444445

Each workout featured on the video is only 20 minutes long which is perfect for people that don't have a lot of time. They are only 20 minutes long but they have left her feeling like she has given herself a good workout. She was sore for the next few days.

They way he is explains how to do each position is very easy to understand.  Plus with his calming voice he helps you relax and focus on bringing your body together with your mind.  It's quite a spiritual feeling every time I do one of his DVDs it always has been that's why I love Rodney Yee :D,1378857600,,449,3.795698924731183

I like some teachings to go with my yoga, some focus, some guideance - a message of what to work on. I prefer being in studio for classes where that instruction is always present. Even if the instruction is where to place your foot or a reminder to breathe and what the breath does for your body.

I started off with some beginner videos, with my favorite being Rodney Yee's Yoga for Beginners.  I've had that dvd for over a year and still use it fairly regularly.

Since I like that video so much, I decided to get another Rodney Yee video.  While this video is good, I don't like it quite as much.  I think a main difference is that some of the sequences in this video are faster/more intense.  So if you want to be moving a little more/do some faster yoga, you will like this.  I prefer slower, more relaxed stretching.  There are 5 segments on this video and there are 2 I like a good amount, but still need to warm up to the other 3.",1374192000,,768,4.1768707482993195

They are the best best best yoga instructional videos I have ever found after A LOT of searching. I started with his AM/PM yoga for beginners DVD about 8 months ago and haven't looked back. It has finally solidified my yoga practice as a part of my daily life. This DVD ""Daily Yoga"" is quite a bit more challenging, I would say start with his DVD's labeled specifically for beginners then work your way to this one if you are just starting out.

No offense to the woman who is working with him, but I just prefer his style of instruction.  The first daily program really isn't much of a workout, it's just a review of positions so I look at this DVD as having, realistically, four good workouts to it.",1362096000,,353,4.2388059701492535

4518609,5,B0050W0UTO,"This is the perfect regular yoga DVD for me.  I love Rodney Yee's yoga videos, but currently only had an hour and a half power yoga DVD - which is an awesome work out, but being a new mom, my time is divided very differently and there was no guarantee that I could devote that much time to a work out and that led to me not doing as much yoga.

This DVD has 5 great options, each with a different theme.  And they range in time from about 20 minutes to not quite a half hour, so it's much easier for me to make time for them

Highly recommend",1358812800,,542,3.9

4518613,4,B0050W0UTO,"This DVD is very well done, with a nice variety of workouts. I enjoyed doing something different every day.

However, this is NOT for beginners! I would highly recommend Yee's beginner DVD, or one that teaches you all the poses and gets you acquainted with the practice of breathing. I would consider myself a beginner, though I have done a few different DVDs and some classes. I was thankful for the background I had, but still felt I needed to know more poses and be in a little better shape to do some of the workouts on this DVD.

If you are at an intermediate level and want some great workouts to do at home every day, this would be perfect. I will definitely be using this DVD after a little more experience!",1355702400,,715,4.368421052631579
4518614,5,B0050W0UTO,"I'm a fan of Rodney Yee's yoga DVDs. I can't always make it to a yoga studio for a live class. This DVD allows me to do a shorter yoga workout at home when I'm pressed for time. It's very relaxing, and I feel more limber and agile when I do these workouts. You can choose from several yoga workout options on this DVD. They are suitable for beginners and intermediate students. I like the way Yee names all the moves for you. Transitions from one posture to the next can be a little rapid at times, but overall, I am able to follow along and get a decent yoga workout. I'm a beginner who has been doing yoga on and off for a few years.",1355184000,,635,4.0476190476190474

My only complaint, and it's not a big deal, is that the 20 minutes is not specifically observed. It's a little short on one or two, and a little long in other places. Again, not a big deal, but I do this right before I go to work, and if you truly only have 20 minutes and it runs two or three over, it can put you in a little squeeze for time.

But otherwise, Yee is a big part of my life every morning.",1355097600,,543,3.7964601769911503

4518617,5,B0050W0UTO,I am familiar with yoga but never have been very disciplined. Loved this DVD with the different workouts for every day and I can choose which one to do for the mood I'm in or my energy level. Each workout is about 20 minutes so you can mix and match a few if you want a longer workout. Definitely recommend it to someone who is a beginner!,1350345600,,339,4.074626865671642

Calm down is good if you have time which I don't very often.  Sometimes before bed I use it but not part of my morning Yoga.  Energize and Strengthen the core are good but clean it out is the best,1348358400,,361,4.070422535211268
4518619,3,B0050W0UTO,"I had been curious about this DVD for some time.  I love Rodney Yee's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-M-Yoga-for-Your-Week/dp/B000YV1L4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A.M. Yoga for Your Week</a>, another DVD which features five short yoga practices, and I was hoping that this video would be similar, but I actually found it to be quite different.  First, not all of the practices on Daily Yoga are instructed by Yee; although this is not mentioned anywhere on the DVD case, his current wife, Colleen Saidman, leads one of the routines (see below).  Second, although Yee is an Iyengar-trained instructor, he attempts to offer a taste of different yoga styles in each practice here.  This is an interesting idea, but in reality, the execution does not work particularly well.

As the title of the DVD suggests, the practices are designed to be performed on different days of the week.  Two are shown in a rather bland white room, but the remaining three are featured outdoors.  The only props needed are a yoga mat and a strap (for just one practice).  I have broken down each of the routines in greater detail below.

DAY 1:  BUILD THE FOUNDATION (Iyengar, 25.5 minutes)
This routine is performed indoors, with Yee instructing live while Saidman models the poses.  Given this, there is an almost instructional feel to the routine, which begins with a detailed description of mountain pose.  From there, Yee leads Saidman into a standing forward bend, child's pose, and down dog.  The standing series includes warrior 2 (one side only), triangle, side angle, wide legged forward bend, and warrior 1.  Yee also takes Saidman through what he calls a ""mini"" sun salutation of modified postures before coming to the floor for modified camel, reclined leg stretch, cobbler's pose, simple seated twist, lying savasana prep, and a very brief (about 1 minute) savasana.

DAY 2: ENERGIZE (Vinyasa, 21.5 minutes)
This practice is lead by Saidman, who teaches outdoors via voiceover.  As she explains in her intro, vinyasa means simply postures linked by breath.  This is NOT a fast-paced vinyasa practice; it is very much a slower flow.  Although I thought Saidman included some nice moves, particularly some enjoyable twisting postures, I found her sequencing to be rather odd and her cuing to be a bit off.  She starts seated for a seated flow which includes a simple twist and flowing seated side bend.  Coming to standing, she moves in and out of standing forward bend, takes some large sun breaths, moves back to down dog (pedaling the feet), and stretches in cat/cow.  The standing pose sequence includes warrior 2, reverse warrior, thread the needle, side angle, and several repetitions of wide-legged standing forward bend, including a twisting version.  She also adds in both modified side plank and full side plank, seated one-legged forward bends, tabletop, and bridge.  The savasana is almost non-existent (about 10 seconds!) for this routine.

DAY 3: STRENGTHEN THE CORE (Core, 17.5 minutes)
Yee leads this outdoor practice via voiceover.  Those who have tried his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Abs-Yoga/dp/B00029QOTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Abs Yoga</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Core-Cross-Train/dp/B000YV1L44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Core Cross Train</a>&nbsp;DVDs will recognize many of the moves incorporated here.  Yee begins in a reclined position for a series of knee ins and leg lowers, both single and double leg; he also uses a strap to lower around your double bent legs (""like you are jumping rope"").  He ends this series with a combined happy babies pose/lying cobbler's pose (legs in the air).  Next comes a seated series which involves a vinyasa flow between poses such as cobbler, wide-angle, staff, half-boat, and full boat.  After moving into down dog, Yee comes to standing for a few standing side bends.  Returning to the floor, he performs both single and double leg locus pose.  Yee finishes the practice with 10 breaths in constructive rest.  This was one of my favorite practices on the DVD.

DAY 4: CLEAN IT OUT (Ashtanga, 26.5 minutes)
Here Yee is again teaching outdoors via voiceover.  In his live intro, he describes this routine as ""vinyasa prep"" for the Ashtanga first series.  To that end, the first 15 minutes of this practice consists of sun salutations.  Yee starts with sun salutation A, building up slowly and eventually going to full jump-backs.  He does the same with sun salutation B, although these became VERY fast in addition to adding powerful pose and warrior 1.  Yee then moves through several variations of standing forward bend before starting the standing pose series, which includes triangle/revolved triangle, side angle/modified revolved side triangle, wide-legged standing forward bend, and pyramid.  Yee comes to the floor for hero's pose, and he again concludes the practice with 10 breaths, this time in savasana.

DAY 5: CALM DOWN (Restorative, 14.5 minutes)
Yee is back indoors for this final practice, still instructing via voiceover.  He leads a nice, gentle practice, although it is not truly ""restorative"" in that he does not use props to facilitate the postures.  Yee begins on the floor in lightning pose, then moves to child's pose.  Coming to seated, he performs a simple cross-leg seated forward bend, transitions via cobbler's/staff poses, and then comes to a reclined position for constructive rest.  Returning to a seated position, Yee performs a few minutes of seated meditation.  He does a nice job of setting up for savasana, allowing a bit more time (about 2.5 minutes) for the final rest than in the other routines on the DVD.

Overall, I found this DVD to be just okay.  The practices felt uneven, and the quality of the offerings did not seem up to what I would usually expect from Rodney Yee.  Even if you are looking for a taste of different yoga styles, I don't think that this DVD would be your best bet.",1343779200,26,6037,5.325237592397043
4518620,5,B0050W0UTO,"Guys will really enjoy Rodney's yoga video. He doesn't practice, what I call; ""Pretzel Yoga"" and makes it very easy for everyone to enjoy.
Daily yoga is awesome and if it's your first time practicing yoga, you will be amazed at how incredible you will feel by day four. It's two weeks since I began and feel so balanced and my breathing is so much better - slower and deeper in fact.",1338940800,4,383,4.333333333333333
4518621,4,B0050W0UTO,"The instructional is good, really good. But there's only one ""morning"" and one ""evening"" session. Kind of lacking and repetitive. Would have been better to have several sessions of each to showcase more of what beginners can do.",1334534400,,228,5.026315789473684

4518623,2,B0050W0UTO,"I didn't like the speed with which they moved through the poses in some of the segments, especially considering this video has been recommended for beginners. I'm not a beginner, and it was still difficult to keep up with the flow of the poses. If you're looking for a video where poses are held for any length of time, or one that's easy to follow along with, this isn't the one. I also found some of the verbal instructions confusing, and had to stop and rewind the video several times to figure out what they were talking about. Lastly, I didn't appreciate the use of English translations in full substitution for the original Sanskrit names of the yoga poses. I realize not everyone knows the Sanskrit names for the poses, but it's also true that there's no standardization of the English names, either. As a result, I never really knew which pose they were referring to, and this added to my confusion.",1332288000,5,907,4.604938271604938
4518624,5,B0050W0UTO,"Unlike many Gaiam videos that are repackaged from previous DVDs, this video is all new.  Many of the poses are traditional that you will find on most yoga DVDs, including previous Rodney Yee.  HOWEVER, I was very happy to see that some poses were ones I've never seen before (especially see Day 2: ENERGIZE), and they were 5 all new yoga segments.  Each segment is unique.  Other reviewers have listed specific info about each sement, so I will just focus on my impressions of the DVD.  I really enjoyed it.  Even though I've been doing yoga for many years, I feel that I learned some new things about form and of course experienced some new poses.  I requested the library to buy it, but I'm considering also buying my own copy because I love the DVD that much.  I recommend it to both new and experienced yoga practitioners.",1331078400,10,826,4.533783783783784
4518625,5,B0050W0UTO,"Having purchased several of Rodney's previous yoga DVD's, I was very excited to see this one.  As I am not very advanced, I find it to push me just  bit more but in a very good way.  I really enjoy the daily work and the extra instruction Rodney gives on the Day 1 workout.  It has allowed me to more consciously evaluate how I'm standing and doing the stances.  If you are a beginner, this may push you just a bit, but remember just like Rodney says, never move more than what your breath and body allows.",1329782400,5,506,4.175257731958763

Not really a beginner DVD but I love the low time commitment which has resulted in a no excuse policy.  Monday - Friday I can do it!",1328400000,6,431,3.852272727272727
4518627,4,B0050W0UTO,"I'm really enjoying this dvd. I probably won't incorporate the first workout into my routine very often, but the others are really nice. They're a great length that fit into just about any schedule. The variety is nice.",1328054400,2,219,4.7894736842105265
4518628,5,B0050W0UTO,"This is a great DVD. Monday through Friday I do one different 20 min session before work. I have moved on to some longer and more difficult workouts, but I still start the day with Rodney.",1326240000,3,188,4.25
4518629,4,B0050W0UTO,"I've been working out with Rodney Yee's DVD's for years now and tend to buy anything he releases but I particularly like these ones he's been putting out lately with the 5 workouts on one DVD. I enjoy the variety but mostly it's the fact that they're all between 20-25 minutes long. Of course I want to use a longer practice but honestly it just doesn't happen, these are perfect though, everyone can find 20 minutes in their day.

Daily Yoga contains 5 different styles of Yoga (3 of which I can see myself using regularly) and includes;

Day 1: BUILD THE FOUNDATION (Iyengar- 20 minutes)-I gave this 2 stars. Its v-e-r-y slow moving and instructional with Rodney teaching Colleen the basics of the poses and proper alignment in a sterile white studio. It would be fantastic for beginners but I don't see myself using it again.

Day 2: ENERGIZE (Vinyasa-22 minutes) -3.5 Stars. While I really enjoyed this flowing, outdoor workout with Colleen, her dubbed in voice instruction was about a second off of what she was doing, which turned out to be surprisingly frustrating as she was always 1 pose ahead of her voice. If I didn't look at the TV I was fine, but still. Very fast moving flow series with little instruction. Not recommended unless you have knowledge of the basic poses.

Day 3: STRENGTHEN THE CORE (20 minutes) -5 Stars. Loved this one and wished it was longer. Outdoors setting with Rodney. No sun salutations here, most of the exercises are done on your back using leg lifts, Boat Pose, Plank, Locust, Cobblers and Chair. Fast moving, felt this in my ""core"" for sure.

Day 4: CLEAR IT OUT (Ashtanga-25 minutes) -5 Stars.-Outdoors setting again with Rodney. Wow, once I got into this one it was amazing, definitely worked up a sweat. Basic Sun Salutations preformed 5 times (A&B) and then the standing series (Triangle, Revolved Triangle, Side Angle, Forward folds. Lots of attention given to 5 count breathe. Kicked my butt.

Day 5: CALM DOWN (Restorative-20 minutes) -2 Stars We return indoors to the white studio. This one is more a meditation then a workout and might be nice to do in the morning or at night before bed. Childs pose, Cross legged forward bends and a long Savasana. Honestly I probably won't get much use out of this one either.
