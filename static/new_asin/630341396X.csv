640462,5,630341396X,"A friend of the family gave this movie to us (her boys are now grown) and my little one loves anything 'farm.'

It is really a good video.  Not annoying, nice pace, funny, informative.  My son likes talking about 'seasons' after watching this as they do it based on a full year.  It's based on a dairy farm, but they do a clip on maple syrup and on logging.

If this movie 'dies' we will buy another one.  It's the only 'video' my son watches.",1299456000,,443,4.152941176470589
640463,5,630341396X,"My daughter fell in love with this video and watched it again and again. I thought she'd wear it out, we played it so much. Then along came my son, four years later and he was even more in love with it than my daughter had been (if that's possible).

Now I must confess that we live a few miles down the road from Elgin Spring Farm where the video was filmed/produced. It gives me endless pleasure to hear my children exclaim, ""Mommy, that's Elgin Spring Farm, just like in the video"" when we drive by. This farm is real, run by a real family, multi-generational. The fact that it is still in operation is amazing. The fact that it is still in operation just like its portrayed in the video is a testament to the hard-working family that runs it. I love that we live in a place where agriculture is still a huge part of the community fabric.

This video is a slam dunk with children, but I want to share the fact that I gave a copy to my uncle on his 80th birthday. He grew up and worked a dairy farm in Southern NH in his youth and I knew that he had fond, fond memories of those days. The farm is long gone, but I thought this video would be nostalgic for him. Not only did he like it, he plays it again and again. Probably not as often as my children, but more than one would have suspected. The gift hit a sweet chord for him.

I highly recommend this video and applaud Mac Parker for making it. It's one of our favorites.",1270684800,4,1426,4.103942652329749
640464,5,630341396X,"My son LOVED this film as a preschooler and young elementary student.  He would have watched it all day if we had let him.  He is now a teenager and still has fond memeroies of the ""farm movie.""  We highly recommend it!",1270512000,2,219,4.166666666666667
640465,5,630341396X,"I have seen this film and it gives a beautiful and thorough taste of farm life in Vermont (or anywhere) that still honors the concept of the ""family farm within a community"".

Until you can take your children and their friends to a working farm, this video is the next best thing. It teaches where our food comes from, of which many children are woefully unaware. And if farms like the Bessette's continue to disappear, not only will their lifestyle suffer but the rest of us will no longer have a choice about what food we can eat.

Agribusiness is ruining not only our lifestyle but every choice we have about what we put into our mouths. The gene pool for a variety of crops is diminishing to those few chosen by agribusinesses, not farmers--but business men--motivated by business, not a passion for good healthy food that does not ruin the environment, but a passion for the income the nutrition-devoid products from the middle aisles of the grocery store bring to their bank accounts-- finance- and patent-controlled, limited gene-pool, corn seed-based soda pop, chips, and breakfast cereals from which one almost gains higher food value from eating the box, to name a few.

The video, ""Let's Go to the Farm"" shows your child and you the value of not losing a time-honored, healthy way of life.",1268956800,,1300,4.743362831858407
640466,5,630341396X,"This beautiful film was a major part of my childhood and I'm so happy it is being released on DVD! In an age in which children's entertainment can be so fast-paced, uninformative and sometimes even violent, Let's Go To The Farm offers an alternative which can be enjoyed multiple times with renewed enthusiasm. Let's Go To The Farm presents a year of Vermont farm life through the eyes and voice of storyteller Mac Parker, and engages both children and adults into the way of life that is so integral to our food system. Mac's narration is both informative and humorous, the music compelling, and the cinematography of rural Vermont exquisite. I was moved both as a child and as an adult by the cinematic sequences showing the changing seasons and passage of time on a farm. I highly recommend this film for children of all ages!",1268956800,2,829,4.684931506849315
640467,5,630341396X,"This video is informative, fascinating and beautifully paced. It has everything to engage children's minds and attention - farm animals, farm machinery, trucks, children, excellent musical accompaniment and plenty of lively fun. It is clearly and delightfully narrated by Vermont story-teller Mac Parker. It proceeds through all four seasons on the Bessette's dairy farm, illustrating both the work and the recreation of the family. Children will want to see it over and over, and because it's so well-made, parents will be happy to oblige.",1268956800,4,540,5.440476190476191
640468,5,630341396X,"My now four year old could not watch this enough when she was a toddler.  My mom found it at a yard sale or something- you never know what will pique your kids interest.  Now, I have an 18 month old up at night sometimes with a bellyache.  I used to have to walk & pace with him to make him happy.  NOW, I just put in the video & rest next to him while he watches.  Sometimes he watches it at night three times in a row.  I don't feel guilty- and have to admit sometimes I even enjoy it.  Kind of sickening :)  My mom (grandma) loves it & watches it for fun! HA!  I think his voice is soothing to children & they love seeing real life farm stuff!
I pray the video lasts til he's over this phase- although my four year old still enjoys it!",1222300800,,738,3.8666666666666667
640469,5,630341396X,"Not too slow, not too fast, informational but not technical, this has been a favorite in our house for years and years.  My 7 year old daughter still asks to watch this, just as she did when she was a toddler.  All of our kids love it, and it is nice to have on because I actually like it too!  This is the ONLY vhs tape we hung onto when we got rid of our tapes...as a matter of fact, the sole reason we recently bought a vhs/dvd combo when our old one died was so we could still watch ""Elgin Spring Farm Movie""!",1206748800,,513,3.9134615384615383
640683,4,630341396X,"Great little film about life on a Vermont dairy farm, from cow care, to syrup harvesting, to logging, baling hay, and storing crops for winter.  Sad to see that the producer/narrator of the film has been sentenced to five years in federal prison for involvement in a Ponzi scheme.",1383609600,,280,4.714285714285714
640684,5,630341396X,"my sister in law told me about this movie that her grandkids sat and sat to watch so I got it for mine...
will she was right ....he sits and watches this over and over again.... its like being on the farm yourself.  it tells the
farm story as it is.......it brought back memories we had when we ran our dairy farm........great movie for kids to watch and
learn from (better than cartoon videos)",1378339200,,394,4.324324324324325
640685,5,630341396X,"Of course I am partial to this great film!!  I bought this dvd as a birthday gift for a young friend, who is thrilled with it.  I get such enthusiastic responses from the children I've given it to, and from their parents!  (Not to mention my own family :)  I love giving a great quality gift that brings joy to the whole family, and has lasting value for everyone.  A whole generation of kids who grew up watching Let's Go To The Farm now delight in sharing it with their own children, keeping this beautiful tradition alive.  And I'm so glad to see family farmers celebrated among the everyday heroes in our children's lives!",1368144000,,626,4.447368421052632
640686,5,630341396X,This video is cool it give kids an idea on what goes on at the farm.  And because it takes place in vermont the winter scenes are great.,1361923200,,136,3.857142857142857
640687,5,630341396X,My toddler's favorite (along with Peep and the Big Wide World). Good sweet fun and just perfect for what it is - a depiction of a working Vermont farm. Hat's off to the people behind this lovely little movie. A real antidote to much of what is out there for kids to watch.,1356912000,,272,4.150943396226415
640688,4,630341396X,Love this video.  It is about an operating farm in VT.  Kids love it and it is educational so mom and dad don't mind it either.,1355702400,,127,3.8461538461538463
640689,5,630341396X,"When my son was a toddler, he and my husband would watch this every night-sometimes more than once a day! My husband grew up working on dairy farms and, at the time, we dreamed of having our own farm.  My son is now 10, we have our farm (although not a dairy farm.) and my husband wants to get this on DVD for the day we have grandkids!  Lots of fun watching Mac interact with the family. I would recommend for anyone with young kids.",1315094400,,434,4.094117647058823

every kid and every adult will love it.

640692,3,630341396X,"As a K teacher I was really wanting a movie that talked a lot about farm animals. This moive does not do that. If you want to know about dairy farming the beginning of the movie is great for that. My students quickly lost interest after that. It does do a great job of taking you through the seasons and talks about life on a farm outside of the animals. However, if you are looking for a moive about farm animals, this isn't for you.",1303776000,,434,4.117647058823529

7846080,5,630341396X,This is an awesome video. I purchased it years ago for my children in VHS format and was delighted to find it on DVD. I share it with co-workers who have young children. IT teaches how much work farming really is.,1466899200,,213,4.219512195121951

7846085,5,630341396X,"I first bought this in VHS format over 20 years ago. My children adored it. I was so elated to find it in dvd format as it is one of the few VHS tapes I miss since we moved to DVD eons ago. The strong appeal for the child viewer is the animals. For me, I like how it focuses on the farm through the four seasons in Vermont. My only shock was learning later that Mac Parker was an actor and not really their hired hand -- welcome to reality tv :)",1403740800,,445,3.795698924731183
7846086,5,630341396X,"I have had this on VHS and now DVD through 4 kids.  Each one has enjoyed it and watched it many times.  I am not a farmer.  I am not from Vermont, but I enjoy putting this on when one of my kids wants to watch a movie.  Family friendly.  A bit corny, but excellent.",1399334400,,265,3.7454545454545456
7846087,4,630341396X,"I have seen this movie with my children many, many times. Now that I am teaching grade 2, I use it to teach the seasons. I always get wistful and want to visit Vermont, USA and the Besset family because the movie makes the viewer feel so connected to the  farming way of life and walks you through the four seasons with tractors, maple syrup and the importance of familial connection in the working of a farm. Everyone plays a central role in it's success. We've been watching it for over 10 years and my children are now 11 and 14. However, the DVD doesn't play on my DVD player. It constantly skips. It always plays on both my home computers and my school computer but I wasn't very impressed initially. It's a good thing we don't have cable and we use our computer to stream shows.
In conclusion, I can't stress enough how well this movie was made and say that I would have paid double what the asking price was. IT has been a very very special show for my children. Thank You to the makers Your movie has had quite an impact on our family
