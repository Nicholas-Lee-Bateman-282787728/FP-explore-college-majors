8227312,3,B000X7SA3O,"Million Dollar Kid, 1943 film

The film begins with the Brooklyn Bridge in the background. Muggers create crime in the neighborhood. Herbie wants to join their club (he is a cousin of Glimpy). Their chatter is humorous. Men at a pool hall spot a rich stranger and rob him in an alley. Muggs and the others rescue him. The police take them in for questioning. Courtland comes to identify them as his rescuers. [An ""A"" sticker was for gasoline rationing.] Courtland allows them to use his gym. A servant can be fired on a whim. The other servants leave in solidarity! Does his son Roy have a problem? Can the boys identify the muggers? We learn more about those muggers. Muggs and Glimpy learn more about that French soldier. Louise doesn't welcome bad news. Muggs has a plan to save Louise. It works!

A telegram from the War Department brings bad news for Courtlandt. Their doctor makes house calls. Roy and Muggs box in the gym. They form a plan to rescue Skinny from the bad guys, and bring the bad guys to the police. Muggs explains for Roy, there will be a happy ending. There is a joke in the last scene.

This story uses ""juvenile delinquency"" as the background for a comedy, as well as an imposter trying to marry into a wealthy family. Were servants readily available during wartime? However implausible this story, it provided entertainment during the 1940s. It has a message as a morality play. Do younger sons have a problem in matching their older brothers?",1471219200,,1469,4.620689655172414
