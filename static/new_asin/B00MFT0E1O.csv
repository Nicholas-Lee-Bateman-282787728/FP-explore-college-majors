8671963,5,B00MFT0E1O,"Came quickly and in wonderful condition. Great price in comparison to the other regional versions. Art book also contains slight insight into the story and a few comments from the directors. I can only comment on the quality of the 7th movie's subtitles so far, but they seem accurate, though unpleasant to look at; typical thin, pixelated and yellow with black outline as opposed to smoother and more appealing fansubs. But, at least they aren't in broken English like some other copies of this anime series.

Definitely a safe buy for anyone looking to watch this. Don't be scared by the region lock either, it plays fine on my computer using VLC.",1479081600,4,649,4.794642857142857
