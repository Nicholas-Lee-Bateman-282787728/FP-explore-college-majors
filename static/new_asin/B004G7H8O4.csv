As an anime fan myself, I've bought several complete box sets and this one was really something special. It's in a large box that is really beautiful. It also came with a poster that we'd never seen before and my daughter was thrilled. The art book is a little small, page and contentwise, but there is a bonus comic in it that was a nice surprise. All in all a great buy. Now she wants volume 2!!",1324857600,,503,4.3052631578947365
8428515,5,B004G7H8O4,"Well I actually LOVED this! It's REALLY good! Oz a young man is going to a coming of age Ceremony well......lets just say thing went to hell in a hand basket. Gill is Possessed by something and stabs Oz then even more hell breaks lose a girl calling herself Alice which also is called B rabbit attacks the people who is attacking Oz turns out she's a chain and she ends up attacking the bad guys while Oz tries to kill one of the people hidden in his/her cloak but Gil his best friend and servant tries to protect the person Oz tries to attack and ends up harming Gil instead thinking he is dead Oz crumples to the ground and the people in cloaks send him to a hellish place called Abyss. There he is reunited with Alice and makes a contract with her and they both escape Abyss this is where both of their journey begins. This is very much worth watching. The package comes with two DVD'S and a hardbound art book. But for 40 to 50 dollars you would think they would add a CD soundtrack to it at least and a few other extras. It's subbed...which I wish it was dubbed because I have
Dyslexia and I have a VERY hard time reading subs. I wish people who subbed these these shows would take that into account and dub them. But either way I enjoyed it. ^_^",1298160000,4,1251,4.1735537190082646
