380767,5,6301930037,"I loved this exercise video.  The entire group of 3.  It's too bad I lent mine out to someone years ago.  I've been looking for it everywhere.  SI needs to re release the set!  I wanted to buy it for my mom for her  birthday, but oh well!  They are so much fun.",961286400,3,261,3.811320754716981
380768,4,6301930037,I was sceptical about any fitness video staring a supermodel but this was not too bad.  This video mixes basic streching with yoga type moves that help you with balance and posture.  I like this because many yoga videos  (even beginner ones) seem a little too advanced if you've never done yoga  before.  For me this was a good transistional tape. It helped me to acheive  a better level of flexability and made me more comfortable with yoga.  Elle  is a little cheesy but if you get past that it's worth giving a try.,960681600,10,518,4.4361702127659575
380826,5,6301930037,I'm shaping up!  It works all of my muscle groups. It's fun and relaxing. Great for over 40 set who aren't into hip-hop or into getting their buns burned out.,1401840000,,158,4.266666666666667
380827,5,6301930037,"I wore out the original tapes that I used. I was THANKFUL to find them, again - in a condition that I could actually use and enjoy. Again - thanks.",1376870400,,147,3.933333333333333
380828,5,6301930037,"I only wish it was on DVD.  I have three of these tapes in case the others wear out.  It's a GREAT starter tape-great stretches, and you feel it after which is a good thing.  It's my favorite ""easy"" tape-I've used if for 23 years!  I can't say enough about it, except to BEG Sports Illustrated to re-release it on DVD!!!",1376352000,3,320,4.19672131147541
380829,5,6301930037,"This is a replacement from the broken one that I had. Other that, the tape turned out to be good. I have no problems.",1363996800,,117,3.9166666666666665
380830,5,6301930037,This is aerobic interval training and I love it. I have been doing this work out since it came out off and on through the years. It works most of my body...I only add a few different sit ups and inner thighs. I wish it was a DVD lol,1288569600,3,232,3.7551020408163267
380831,5,6301930037,"I bought this for my mother (75 y.o.) This is her 3rd or 4th tape. She keeps wearing them out so we are going to try and get this one converted to DVD for her. She will NOT use any other exercise tapes or workouts, believe me, we've tried. Mom has stayed in great shape over the years because of this tape. She ABSOLUTELY loves it. (2010)",1268524800,5,338,4.059701492537314
380832,5,6301930037,"I loved the one with Cheryl Tiegs on the cover.  Did it everyday for a long time and it made a great difference in my health, weight and figure.  But it's not available on DVD.  I never use VHS anymore.  I hope it's released on DVD.",1267056000,3,232,3.9782608695652173
380833,5,6301930037,I love this tape so much I am on my second copy.  It is still good for me after 10 years.  I am over 55 and find it both low impact enough for my aging body and yet challenging enough for my active side.  Wonderful tape.  I'm going to order an extra just in case!,1168732800,5,263,3.727272727272727
380834,4,6301930037,"Overall the video was great. Though the person operating the camera was not that good because in the beginning there are to many close ups and you have a hard time following along. About ten minutes into the video they seem to find another camera person and you can watch all the moves and follow along as well. Though they say this video is for all stages, I mainly think it is for intermediates.",1147392000,2,397,4.378378378378378
380835,5,6301930037,"I let a relative borrow this video and I haven't seen it again!
Gotta replace it because it's the most relaxing stretch I have ever experienced - for both before and after aerobics or weight training.  Very enjoyable to follow along with because the class seems to really enjoy it as well.",1037232000,3,289,4.5576923076923075
7817099,5,6301930037,My original tape broke after 20+ years.  So glad to be able to replace it.  Excellent work out regimen.,1510704000,,103,4.368421052631579
7817100,5,6301930037,"I purchased these in the 90s and it 100% works...I would give anything if they would put this out on DVD or online.  I have worn mine out through the years, and went looking to find on DVD since I know it works.",1497657600,,211,3.9069767441860463
7817101,5,6301930037,"I absolutely love this video. I did it in the 90's as a teen, and I still love it today.  I got it to ease myself back into working out again,  and I think it will be the perfect video to do that.  I only wish it was in DVD format. :(",1484352000,,234,3.4615384615384617
7817102,5,6301930037,Probably the best exercise tape I've ever seen (and I've seen and tried a lot of them!!).,1477267200,,89,4.294117647058823

Yoga and pilates moves that are so relaxing too.",1410652800,2,168,5.2592592592592595
7817108,5,6301930037,"Love this work-out tape.  Originally purchased probably when it first came out and it has always been  my favorite!  Lost in hurricane flood  and searched in past to find with no luck.  I was so happy when I found on Amazon.com.  Low impact on one side of room, high impact on other, warm up, work out, awesome cool down!  I just feel so good when I complete this workout.",1402531200,,372,4.304347826086956
