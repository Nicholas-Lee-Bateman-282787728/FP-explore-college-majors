1712495,2,B000066C7U,"I bought this DVD for my wife as she is just learning how to play the cello.  I wasn't sure what to expect from the DVD as there were no reviews on it yet.  I figured I would give it a try.
The dvd is aimed toward those who have NEVER had a lesson.  The chapters cover parts of the cello, how to hold the cello, how to hold the bow, tuning the cello, and playing the scales.
I felt the instruction was a bit too basic.  It covered what we learned in our very first cello lesson with our instructor.  I was expecting more from the dvd, like how to play vibratto, or how to play songs such as what is taught in the Suzuki training books.  The only ""song"" they play is the scales (A-B-C-D, etc).
The lady that plays the cello is obviously uncomfortable being in front of the camera, but I think I would be too!  :)  She is an incredible celloist, and some of the best ""pieces"" of the dvd are the little interludes where she plays the cello between chapters.
I felt some of the chapters could have been longer and more informative.  For example, in the ""Tuning the Cello"" chapter, she explains how to tune the cello.  She then talks about another way to tune the cello using ""reverberation"", but never shows how it works and how to tune the cello that way.
There are some added bonuses to the dvd, such as a guy explaining ""octaves"" on a piano.  They were kind of handy, but would have liked more focus on the cello.
I would recommend this dvd to those who are interested in getting a cello, or have just bought one.  For those of you who have already had a few cello lessons, this dvd will be way to basic for you.
I would really like to see another one created for the intermediate player.  Such as the student who has played for awhile, but wants to learn more about the cello and how to play more interesting songs.",1042416000,112,1815,4.181034482758621

they only showed you things that can be done they didn't reach show any teaching on here.",1440979200,,152,4.1

7962178,1,B000066C7U,"I expected the basics but it was more ""do what your teacher says"" info.  Wow!  Not worth the 20 bucks that's for sure!!! I want a refund of my money AND time!!!",1362700800,,160,3.96875
7962179,3,B000066C7U,"I think it is helpful. There are so many things to know to start cello, having someone demonstrate the basics is helpful.",1273795200,,121,4.545454545454546
7962180,1,B000066C7U,This should be called ultimate idiot series. This dvd is not even 30 minutes long and just barely teaches anything except how to hold the cello and a very simple exercise. Then its all over. There should have been more exercises and examples for the price. Its not worth more than 5 dollars for the info. it contains.,1210723200,2,317,4.482758620689655
7962181,1,B000066C7U,"Have you:

1. Seen a cello before?
2. Seen someone else play the cello?

If you answered ""yes"" to both of these, your knowledge of the cello is already too advanced to gain anything from this DVD.  There is almost nothing of substance in this ""lesson"", and the tiny amount of actual information present is repeated endlessly over a period of thirty minutes.  I'm not sure if she (Or he?  I'm actually a little confused about that) is used to teaching very small children or the mentally handicapped, but for any person of even moderate intelligence this lesson moves at a maddeningly slow pace.",1183420800,2,594,4.673076923076923
7962182,3,B000066C7U,Purchased this DVD to try to teach myself to play Cello. I is a good intro but I found that a teacher is required.,1180310400,,114,3.7916666666666665
7962183,4,B000066C7U,"I actually found this video very helpful.  I have used it as an additional aid for showing my beginning students how to hold the cello and the bow, estimate the best size of instrument etc.  Since they can examine footage of an experienced cellist as she plays, they can glean subtle details about posture, hand position, etc. that they won't easily get from a book or website.  I am a man teaching only female students (so far).  Since my hands, legs, etc., are much larger than theirs, it is not always helpful for me to simply show them how I hold the bow or how I rest the cello between my legs.  One reviewer felt that the lessons are too basic: I recommend re-examining words such as ""ultimate"" and ""beginner"" in the video's title - with a dictionary close at hand!",1141516800,12,771,4.439716312056738
7962184,1,B000066C7U,"One silly lesson on a dvd ? Why ? This was an absolute waste of money.

If lessons 2 - onward have to come from a book or

something els than don't bother with this DVD. Check the

internet out and get more than this offers.",1121817600,28,224,3.8260869565217392
7962185,1,B000066C7U,"This DVD was extremely short and simple...a little too simple. The information given was the kind that you can get searching for the word ""cello"" on the internet....seriously. I have read through many cello sites and they were more informative and INTERESTING than this DVD.

This DVD is NOT worth the 20 dollars. Might as well invest in a cello instructor.

This is the worst DVD I've ever purchased.",1103241600,36,401,4.797101449275362
