5261266,1,B0094FTKJO,Got this movie for my Kindergarten students to watch on the last day of school before Christmas Break and most of them fell asleep. The ones that were awake started begging for me to change the movie. BAD acting. SLOW movie flow. We cut it off after 30 minutes.,1356048000,2,261,4.346938775510204
5261267,5,B0094FTKJO,...to watch with their grandma (or grandpa). I give it 5 stars because it keeps children interested. Especially the ones who are waiting for their Christmas gifts and for Christmas to come. It keeps the spirit of Christmas alive in any household. And it also has a very positive and meaningful message.,1352505600,7,302,4.826923076923077
5261268,5,B0094FTKJO,This is a good family movie kids will love. It is in the style of Home Alone. The girl in the movie kidnaps Santa because she does not get what she wants for Christmas.,1352419200,3,168,3.9705882352941178

8535838,1,B0094FTKJO,"Cute plot but teaches some bad lessons. Kids sneaking out of their home after dark. A kid claiming she's been good all year but she's got a sassy attitude, she's selfish, leaves her friend locked in a closet. Mom
Sleeps while two men in house with the kid. My kid said ""all Santa had to do was say he didn't get the letter and ask her what she wanted, lol. Adult content Santa dreaming and saying ""oh mrs Claus,"". Parents dealing with some heavy relationship issues that was beyond most kids level of understanding. if I heard ""YouTube"" or ""Suzuki""
Advertising one more time...
Lastly best part is the elf.",1450137600,,606,4.5181818181818185
8535839,1,B0094FTKJO,"I've seen bad Christmas movies. This is by far one of the worse! Definitely for kids - hopefully, they don't know what a bad movie looks like, yet.",1447632000,,147,4.285714285714286

8535842,1,B0094FTKJO,"I guess I'm confused regarding who is the target audience for this movie. It's apparently for kids, but the main problem was between the husband and wife....I'm assuming they're still married, but I can't confirm this because I fell asleep about ten minutes in. I did wake up in time for the ending, and I kind of wish I didn't see it. The man who was dressed as an elf was just annoying--a flat stereotype--and I'm still baffled as to why he was offered a partnership. He seemed pretty incompetent to me.
Also--Moosie? Really? She was supposed to be Abigail's friend and co-conspirator, but she didn't seem to serve any purpose plot-wise. I also couldn't help but think how ridiculous it is that these 7-year-olds (?) had iPads and were using FaceTime...I guess I can't help but cringe whenever I see kids develop their addiction to technology at such an impressionable age.
The biggest issue I had with the movie was when Abigail, with a stoney expression, asked her mom if she was ""good"" this year. Well, if by good she means tying up Santa and interrogating him just because he didn't appease her...she honestly didn't deserve a used teddy bear in my opinion. Nevertheless, come Christmas morning, she gets a mountain of presents. For one child! I know she is a fictitious character, but I'm really hoping kids who watch this movie do not get the impression that snotty behavior is rewarded with gifts.
I suppose the one saving grace this movie has is that it's free on Netflix.",1418428800,2,1482,4.703846153846154
