8495157,5,B000XXV4XQ,The tape was great to watch and last year I went visit to the church I worked on 40 years ago. My men and I put the roof on. I feel A lot of pride that I had the opportunity to be A part of the construction of it. I also took pictures when I worked on the roof and have pictures of the church and me standing on top of the Cathedral. I always recommend going to Washington to visit the church.,1295395200,,393,3.746987951807229
