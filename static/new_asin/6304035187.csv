789270,5,6304035187,"No, this is NOT a porno movie as the title might suggest, but a rather cerebral look at what women have to deal with in their personal lives.  The cast is superb, and it is basically structured as a slumber party/bridal shower with the various friends all talking among themselves.  However, through those conversations we see the insecurities, harassments, confusion, and frustrations women deal with every day.  There is great humor and a little bit of drama throughout, which makes it an enjoyable movie of substance for me.

789394,4,6304035187,"Anyone who hears the title of the movie will think it is smutty or something that is on Cinemax overnight.  Yes there is nudity in it, but it amounts to about 2 scenes (and yes one does involve Olivia D'Abo) but that is it.  The rest of the movie is basically a slumber party before the wedding day of Kim Catrall's character where the group of childhood friends sit around and talk sex.

It definitely falls more into the chick flick camp as it is really a story about the relationships (good and bad) between the characters.  There really is not any kind of overcomplicated plot that you need to follow so it is one of those movies that can just kind of be on in the background and you can tune in and out of it.  It is a good relationship story that does not drag on too long.  Which is good because for the most part it is set inside the same house (save for a couple scenes) and could have easily ended up going way too long.  It is definitely not going to appeal to everyone, and if you clicked on it just because of the title and nothing else, probably want to skip this one.",1377648000,,1082,4.148325358851674
789395,5,6304035187,"OK, here's the deal, for me. I'm a guy and this is, for the most part, a chick flick. But I'm a big fan of, and have major crushes on, Dana Delaney, Olivia D'Abo, and especially Cynthia Stevenson. When this first came out in '95 I was thrilled that all these actresses, along with Kim Cattrall, were in the same movie. But I was surprised by how good it actually is. It takes place over the course of one night as a group of friends gather for sort of a last girl's night as a group before one (Cattrall) gets married. There is the expected girl-talk about sex, men, sex, men, sex, fantasies, sex, men...well, you get it. But each character's background, along with glimpses at what makes them tick, is shown through really well-done flashback scenes and fantasies. Great cast and really solid acting. Women should really enjoy it, and guys, Dana Delaney's spanking fantasy is both funny and hot. And as I mentioned, I have a major crush on Cynthia Stevenson. Seeing her in her underwear for several minutes doesn't hurt this movie a bit. But that stuff aside, this is a top-shelf ensemble cast with really solid performances.",1372464000,2,1126,4.606965174129353
789396,5,6304035187,"This is one of my all time favorite movies.  I can watch it anywhere anytime and any number of times.  It's a feel good movie with laughs, drama, some nudity, love, sex, friendship and great music.  Every part is so rich in scenery, acting, story, and feel-good-ed-ness that I simply love every minute.  Other faves if it helps, are Fight Club, 8mm, Ratatouille, Center Stage, LOTR, Matrix, Office Space, Newsies, Twister, Phantom of the Opera, Boogie Nights, and Super Troopers.  So I have a varying taste.  I'd love for Juliana Lavin to do more of these. I don't know if that will ever happen, but it would be awesome.  Not many movies can change my mood, but this one can.  From whatever to warm fuzzy hug time.  Pretty amazing ; )",1353628800,,734,4.541984732824427

It kind of gives you a glimpse on how women interact when just women mingle. I liked the house a lot. Although the title of the movie is a bit of a misnomer it has a decent ensemble as a cast.  Olivia D'Abo and Kim Cantrell are in it who are very attractive.  But my favorite actress and favorite part is when silly adorable Cynthia Stevenson walks around drunk in her bra and panties acting silly. And her fantasy as her in a barbie doll costume is priceless. Cynthia Stevenson is not only adorable but has a great body, and she kisses Olivia d'abo so that makes the movie worthwhile.

789440,3,6304035187,"LOL! I noticed alot of men bought this movie thinking it was probably somewhat of a ""skin flick"" which is actually pretty amusing. In hollywood ""sex sells"", so just because a movie has a title that is sexy or imply's nudity or sex doesn't necessarily mean the entire movie is about that.

Anyway, This movie is a CHIC FLICK. I own a copy of this movie and it is hilarious!

It's about a group of ladies who grow up together (kind of similar to Sex In The City that way) and reminisce about the past and compare it with where they are in the present.

Some very bizarre scenes. And the lounge music really adds the cherry on top in the sex scene.",1317081600,,645,4.227642276422764

They end up talking about various of their sexual experiences in real life and fantasy.  The fantasies seem like ones women really have and the experiences are like ones some women have and others could at least relate to. There was a great deal of humor, but also real feeling.  In the process of sharing all this, the women gain a closer bond with each other and with other women in general.",1217635200,2,488,4.4
789444,3,6304035187,"A decent movie, though it fails to keep your attention fully throughout the whole show.

But if you want to see a movie covering mostly a slumber party full of beautiful women talking about sex (plus a little nudity), this might be it. (The title is not to be taken literally, of course.)

By the way, the song that's playing during the fantasy scene with Olivia d'Abo and Lora Zane at around 45 minutes is ""Picture Of An Angel"", by Candy Says. More info here: [...]",1206144000,2,466,4.406976744186046

789527,2,6304035187,"The title of this film is very deceiving & it's pretty clear that it was designed to lure people in.  I actually saw this movie way back in the early 90s.  I forgot all about it and got excited and bought it a few years back.  I thought it was a sure-fire to be wall-to-wall skin.  After all, it features 2 names (Dana Delany and Kim Cattral) who have shown no aversion to shedding their clothes in other movies.

Well, I was way wrong.  There is MAYBE 10 seconds worth of nudity in the whole movie.  It's also supposed to be a comedy, but I didn't find it particularly humorous, either.

For what it is, it's an OK movie.  It details what is basically a slumber party for a group of grown women.  Some of the dialogue about sex is cool - kind of like finding out what goes on in a women's locker room.  There's also some exploration of how being a lesbian might make life more ""simple"" than being straight.

However, in the end, I found this to be a pretty dull film.  Most importantly, it does not deliver on what the title promises.  I would be far more forgiving if they had named this movie something else, but I do detest false-advertising.",1138492800,28,1146,4.269767441860465
789528,1,6304035187,"Now when I say boring I don't mean it isn't realistic I have no doubt that women do talk this much about sex when there alone but since they all seem so unlikable (with the exception of Olivia D'Abo who plays the lover of one of the women who reunite in this film), I didn't care about what happen to them. Matter of fact, I would be so happy if something bad happen.",1126310400,6,367,4.041095890410959
789529,4,6304035187,"You have to smile at the idea of all of those viewers, predominantly of the male persuasion, who took one look at the title of this DVD, and may be a second look at Olivia D'Abo, Dana Delaney, and Kim Cattrall on the cover, and decided to rent it only to end up being bitterly disappointed.  You have to give credit to writer-director Julianna Lavin because she reneges on all three parts of her title.  Working back to front, except for some flashbacks the characters are women in their early thirties and not girls, the nudity is more emotional than physical (and for the latter you have to look really quick and then wait for the end of the movie when there is a lot of water), and when there is nudity it tends to occur in fantasy rather than reality.  So there are going to be people totally devoid of any understand of the concept or irony who are not going to like this movie and the fact that what substantive nude scenes exist are erotic as defined from the feminine perspective will just be seen as adding insult to injury by the same.

Those who should enjoy ""Live Nude Girls"" will be woman of the same ages as the characters.  Jill (Delaney) is the gossip of the group, Jamie (Cattrall) is a B-movie actress who may or may not be getting married, Marcy (Cynthia Stevenson) is being blackmailed by her soap opera star boyfriend (Glenn Quinn), and Rachel (Laila Robins)  is basically stuck being Jill's uptight sister.  They have gathered at the house of Georgina (Lora Zane), who is bisexual and currently living with Chris (d'Abo), for what would be described as a slumber party as long as everybody involved understands sleeping will probably not be involved.  What will be involved is talking, mostly about sex, which necessarily involves talking about relationships and get to talking about fantasies as well.  There is not a specific plot against which these conversations are held.  Jamie's fianc is at his bachelor's party and she expects the worst, Marcy has reason to worry about Randy showing up, Jane has something she does not want to tell Rachel, and Georgina and Chris are having problems, but what serves as the climax for this movie is the sun coming up the next morning.

There is more humor to be found in this 1995 movie than profound insights.  I liked the gender-reversal conversation that Marcy has with Randy, especially since a man would never dare have such a grin on his face while saying the exact same things, but for the most part it is the act of self-disclosure and not what is actually disclosed that matters the most here.  Men are usually the subject of the film's barbs, which proves that boys will be boys when it comes to immediately picturing women naked and that men will as likely behave like boys as well given the opportunity at a bachelor's party.  I was going to say that the weak part of the film is how it keeps the character of Chris on the periphery, which allows Georgina to indulge in flights of fantasy, but since ultimately I find the point of ""Live Nude Girls"" to be that talking and talking about everything is important, I have to admit the point is underscored in the negative by Chris's self-exclusion from the gab fest (and certainly reinforced by what she does during the finale in the pool).  If Lavin gets her viewers to not only admit they should have their own slumber party, but actually end up having one, then she will have done well by making this film.",1124496000,44,3431,4.574225122349103
789530,1,6304035187,"Well, I didn't need to pause the movie for a bathroom or drink break.  Basically, this is a group of straight, neurotic women sharing their neurotic lives, with one bi- and one lesbian thrown in to give a touch of variety.
