1757724,1,B00006HCFC,"Have not been able to get the English subtitles to work.  I'm sure its a great movie if you had the subtitles, but since I don't understand Polish, I'm afraid I have to send this as a warning to those who want to purchase this.  There is an option to turn them off, but they do not automatically appear.",1243555200,4,303,4.11864406779661
1757725,3,B00006HCFC,"Do not purchase or rent this film if you do not understand Polish!  There are NO English language subtitles on this DVD!

Since I do not speak or understand Polish I watched the film without knowing what is going on in the story.  Other than that the film itself is quite good, thus the three stars.",1150070400,3,299,4.303571428571429
1757726,5,B00006HCFC,"After seeing ""With Fire and Sword"" and ""The Deluge,"" I surprised myself by guessing Pan Zagloba's line as he tossed away an empty wine bottle before the subtitle appeared: ""I hate empty bottles!"" Michael Wolodyjowski is the perfect soldier and Basia is a likeable and plucky heroine.

Daniel Olbrychski is good as Ayza Bey and even better as Tuhaj Bey in ""With Fire and Sword."" The story and the performances are absolutely outstanding, although the film's color leaves something to be desired.

The story ends with a premonition of how Colonel Wolodyjowski's death will be avenged, and it is unfortunate that Sienkiewicz never wrote a sequel that portrayed the Battle of Vienna (1683). Jan Skshetuski from ""With Fire and Sword"" would have been around sixty and could have taken part along with his numerous sons.",1143072000,5,813,5.014814814814815
1757727,5,B00006HCFC,Read the trilogy first because it is one of the few true masterfull trilogies then watch the trilogy on dvd,1123545600,7,107,4.4
1757728,3,B00006HCFC,"Jerzy Hoffman's late 1960s epic ""Pan Wolodyjowski"" is the saga of the 17th-century Polish Republic fending off traitorous tatars and invading Ottoman turks. It harkens back to the time when an independent Poland extended well beyond its 20th-century borders and stood as the guardian gate of Europe.
The film is enjoyable, with great battle scenes and costume drama, and a generally amusing subplot over tomboy princess Basia's attempts to woo and subdue the leading hero. Hunky Polish actor Daniel Obrychowski plays the film's chief bad guy who comes to a very bad end...who KNEW that was how impaling somebody was actually done. Anyway the film has some fascinating subtext leading me to wonder how this nationalistic, pro-Catholic film got by Poland's then-Soviet overlords: the implications of the film being something along the line that the Ukraine is really Poland and that Poland's eastern and southern borders are home to nasty barbarians who simply can't be trusted.
The VHS transfer is a little dark at times, and every once in a while some choppy element in the storyline leads me to suspect some ruthless editing, but it's still a fine, rousing watch. The saga continues in POTOP, which is next on my own stack of tapes to watch.",986342400,16,1242,5.004830917874396

7968738,3,B00006HCFC,"This movie is very interesting, but has it's flaws.  Despite the cover, don't buy it looking for great battle scenes featuring the winged hussars.  The hussars are conspicuously absent from the battle sequences.  This movie was made in Poland in the late 60's, when the cold War raged, Poland was still a socialist country and a member of the Warsaw Pact.  The movie making they exhibited at the time ran the gamut quality wise.  The two biggest weaknesses in this movie are the editing, and the end.  The end of the movie seemed highly contrived and not well though out.  The story is interesting and holds the viewer throughout the movie.  This was the first of the trilogy, I'm wondering but optimistic about the quality of the later two movies.",1477872000,,748,4.7

7968740,5,B00006HCFC,"I found it interesting and I enjoyed it, but you might want to be Polish or be a fan of Polish Lithuanian history before buying it yourself. It is not a mass market sort of production that it was well done and supported finely.",1411603200,,227,4.181818181818182

7968743,4,B00006HCFC,"Excellent movie, storyline and actors!  Only drawback was some of the English subtitles moved too quickly to read.  We bought the trilogy after viewing as it was a very good production.
We would definitely recommend this DVD.",1378339200,,225,5.054054054054054
