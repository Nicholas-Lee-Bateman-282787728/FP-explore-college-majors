8574819,4,B00BWQTUQ6,"Made in 1979,shelved for two years, and released briefly in Los Angeles and New York, Second Hand Hearts in one of the sweetest films I have seen in many years. I had never even heard of this film until a week ago when it premiered on Turner Classic Movies. After that first watch, I bought the film from the Warner Archive collection through Amazon. I just finished watching for the second time, and I can happily say I have a new favorite movie. Robert Blake and Barbara Harris are a very unlikely pairing that really make this film a charmer. Directed by Hal Ashby (Coming Home) has made a very offbeat romantic comedy very rarely seen. Barbara Harris (Nashville, Freaky Friday) is amazingly charming as Dinette Dusty, a waitress who longs to be back with her three kids. She cons Robert Blake (Baretta) ,boozy Loyal Muke into a marriage of inconvenience, and decides to head out west in search of an exit. To quote a review from the Boston Globe ""A brilliant ode to Americana"" And it is very true. Beautiful photography by Haskell Wexler, as well as great music. I really enjoyed this underrated film, and I was so happy to discover it, and happily now have in my DVD collection. Looking for a very different kind of comedy? Then this is the one to give a watch! Cheers!",1489104000,,1274,4.543478260869565

8574821,1,B00BWQTUQ6,"I bought this film with low expectations.  I wanted to see it because it was the only film I had not seen by great director, Hal Ashby.  I knew it was a problematic film, but it was worse than I expected.  Incoherent storyline, bad acting, confusing editing.  How could such talented people produce this mess?

But...at least it is available and I finally was able to see it.  The quality of the DVD was fair.  No extras, but I didn't expect any.",1392336000,4,446,4.365853658536586
8574822,5,B00BWQTUQ6,Saw this movie years ago and it is an unknown gem! A must see film about real life for the under dog. All with a sense of humor.,1380931200,4,128,3.607142857142857
8574823,1,B00BWQTUQ6,"Where do you begin with this totally inert disaster of a movie? It goes from bad to worse from first frame to last.  Alleged to be a comedy it is absolutely bereft of laughs.  The plot, as we are told in the opening crawl, concerns widowed honky-tonk waitress Dinette Dusty(Barbara Harris) getting drifter Loyal Muke(Robert Blake) drunk so he'll marry her and provide a better life for her and her young 'uns.  Two of her kids are named Iota and Human.  Laughing yet?  The structure of the film is a mess.  The narrative is incoherent.  Harris is absolutely shrill.  Blake seems like a man trying to maintain a hold of his last shred of dignity.  The best performance in the film is turned in by a hamster.  I'd hate this flick more if it weren't so pathetic.  Shockingly this tripe was directed by Hal Ashby who helmed landmark films like ""The Last Detail"" and ""Being There"".  What misbegotten spark compelled me to pursue this sad excuse for a film?  Years ago I used to go to the public library to read the movie reviews from the New York newspapers.  For better or for worse everything opened in New York.  I was struck by the reviews for this film which were outright scathing.  My thinking then and now is how could a film with this pedigree be that bad?  The apparent answer is pretty bad.  So if you are inclined to contract a contagious fungus this may be the film for you.",1371340800,2,1382,4.438247011952191
