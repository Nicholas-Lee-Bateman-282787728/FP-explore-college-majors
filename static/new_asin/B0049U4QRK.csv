8419413,4,B0049U4QRK,"This movie is witty and fun.  I even chuckled out loud during a few scenes.  It absolutely is NOT a horror movie.  It is a ghostly comedy that I found well played with purposeful overacting with purposeful bad special effects, which is a comedic style in itself and well done in this film.  The puns are often subtle and at other times are outrageous.  As one review said, you'd almost have to try to be this bad.  Well, you would.  It does take a lot of great script writing and hard work for the actors to get the timing exactly right to pull off the jokes and to have the gags fall in place just right.  In Paranormal Calamity, they really pulled it off well and there is great comedic chemistry between the characters..",1492473600,2,723,4.343283582089552

8419416,4,B0049U4QRK,"Hey all!  I wouldn't have bothered to pick a rating as I'm obviously biased to this project, but it asked for it so I rated it based on my overall experience of making it and the finished result.  Anyway, I've noticed most of the reaction to the movie through this site and the YouTube trailer comment thread has been predominately negative for various reasons so I felt compelled to post a video response to address some of those issues.  I realize that no movie is EVERYBODIES cup of tea and hope that everyone that stumbled across this page gives it a look with an open mind.  :)

8419417,1,B0049U4QRK,"Barely worth the time to even write a review.  I have struggled my way through bad movies before, but this one took the cake.  Couldn't make it all the way through, though I tried.  Not a single redeeming virtue.",1353196800,,212,4.384615384615385
8419418,1,B0049U4QRK,"Horrible actors (definitely NOT the Charlene Tilton from Dallas fame!), horrible acting, horrible story (if you can even call it that), was not at all funny, and is actually soft-core pornography. Unfortunately, I based my choice on the first review (which was the only one at the time) which is obviously a feeble attempt at sarcasm, or it was written by the producer. If you're going to post a review, at least tell the truth. It would have saved me an hour of my time (as I fast-forwarded through most of it hoping for a miracle) and $1.99 of my money.",1353110400,,555,4.5049504950495045

8419420,5,B0049U4QRK,"This movie blows Paranormal Activity away! It was great fun my entire family loved it. This is one of the best ghost movies we have seen to date. Every character in the movie was lovable and comedic, I hope they make a sequel.",1288656000,5,226,4.27906976744186
