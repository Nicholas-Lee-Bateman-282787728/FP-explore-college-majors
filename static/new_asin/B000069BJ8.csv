1731741,5,B000069BJ8,"This is a terrific film, and not just because my husband is an old 'geezer' and also a surfer. Of course, this is one of his favorite films, but for me as a non-surfer, it is a joy to watch decidedly senior citizens truly celebrating life. The old photos and films are a hoot, but just listening to these guys and gals share their passion and philosophy is entirely worth the time spent. Highly recommended.",1337212800,,407,4.44
1731742,5,B000069BJ8,"Neighbor, teacher, mentor, friend. ""Doc"" was an inspiration to all of us kids in the neighborhood.

Seeing a man in his 70's flying down his driveway, and vanishing around the corner on his skateboard used to thrill and scare us, only to find that he was taking his old long board out and surfing the jetty every birthday. I was fortunate enough to have gone with him one time. Amazing feat at 80 years young.

An incredible man with an incredible life. It was an honor to have known him the little time that we had.

R.I.P Doc.
The guys on the hill.

Video is back ordered. Hope it comes soon.",1262649600,2,594,4.324324324324325
1731743,5,B000069BJ8,"Surfing for Life is one of the best surfing videos I have ever seen.  It covers several surfers from the age of 60 to the age of 93!  It gives small biographies of each surfer, how they started, personal experiences and why they still love to surf.  The music is great surf music and the videography is absolutely beautiful.  It's very different than any other surf video in that this video features surfers with their spouses, children and even grandchildren surfing together or at least family talking about how much surfing means to their loved one.  And it's not just a guys video; many women and girls are high lighted too.  One woman shared her personal story of breaking her neck and thinking surfing was over for her, but she recovered and surfs today with her children and grandchildren.  I highly recommend this video to any surfer or those even interested in surfing.  It will help you understand the surfers you know.",1196208000,6,929,4.691358024691358
1731744,5,B000069BJ8,"An incredible film for young and old. A tribute to the fact that life doesn't end after 60. A healthy mind and attitude can carry a person well into their 90's. ""Doc"" Ball is an example, still surfing at the age of 93.

The story follows 10 seniors who are still actively surfing today, how they have learned to grow old gracefully, others kicking and fighting all the way, not only against their waning physical strength, but politically to keep the Hawaiian beaches safe from the encroachment of modern society. There is joy, laughter, and even a few tears, a film that is touching and filled with the Aloha Spirit. One I simply must own. ...Kelsana",1116028800,13,651,4.612068965517241

7965457,5,B000069BJ8,"I saw it at Capitola Theater when it was first released and bought the VHS. I have since bought 4 DVD's loaned the out and or lost them. This last one I bought was for my mom, who is 86 years old and loves this movie.",1519862400,,217,3.739130434782609
7965458,5,B000069BJ8,"I saw this at ~28 with my boyfriend at the time and was so moved, though I was still only an aspiring surfer.  It moved me so that we brought our moms who were nearing 60 to see it at the theatre on 16th St. in SF whose name escapes me now...  14 years later, I've finally learned to surf, at 43, I remember the inspiration this provided.  I'm in awe of the men who surfed nearly not their 100's, and the women seem so young compared to the women who are absolutely shredding at comps now!  Mad respect to ALL of those who came before I go to experience this.  This movie took a long time to find a direct purpose in my life, but it absolutely, unquestionably changed it for the better every day.  Thank you to the filmmakers for curating this glimpse of humanity and history.",1474588800,,776,4.174496644295302
