6303992,5,B00IXPQUR6,Watch the 2013 NFL playoff games where the Seattle Seahawks become the best football team on the planet.  Go Hawks!,1401667200,,115,4.75
6303993,5,B00IXPQUR6,"I paid iTunes $3.99 for the Super Bowl game to be downloaded onto my computer, then literally a few days later, I found out about this. -SIGH-  Well, of course, I'll buy this, so I can have all of the playoff games. I really enjoyed the Super Bowl Champions Blu-ray, but I was let down that it didn't include the entire game. Here's the answer to that complaint.

As a longtime Hawks fan, I was, of course, super excited that the Seahawks made it to the top of the NFL, finally. Watching the highlights on the other Blu-ray, it sank in a lot more for me that there were a lot of close calls, especially during the NFC Championship game against the 49ers. That very nearly ended the season; the Hawks were really darned lucky Sherman was on the spot at the very end. If he would have been tired and blown that one play, the Seahawks would have fallen short once again. I am hopeful that, despite the loss of some of the 2013 players, the team will have another outstanding year and make it back to the Super Bowl once more.",1400284800,5,1022,4.290155440414508
6303994,5,B00IXPQUR6,"February 4th is a few months behind us now... but I clearly remember these games as an avid 12th! Go Seahawks! I won't bother talking about the games contained herein since only a person living in a hole or a cave didn't see them... or a non-NFL fan who won't care anyway... The NFL prohibits us from recording games, and the bandwidth for a subscription to the reruns is horrible... but we get this gem as a provision! $35 buckaroos is a bit gouging, but it is what it is...",1400025600,2,475,4.288888888888889
6303995,5,B00IXPQUR6,"There wasn't this much destruction in World War II. What a beatdown for the ages. Total slaughter. The Seahawks rolled into Met-Life like Conan, and forced the Broncos fans to hear the lamentations of their women.",1397606400,21,213,4.944444444444445

6304023,5,B00IXPQUR6,Great original broadcasts of Playoffs and Super Bowl.,1448323200,,53,5.75
6304024,5,B00IXPQUR6,"It is as advertised.  Two playoff games, and the Super Bowl presented in their entirety, with only momentary fade-outs where commercial breaks had been taken, with no extra frills.  There is no pre-game hype, and very little else.  The only thing shown post-game after the Super Bowl game was an on field interview with Russell Wilson before the trophy ceremony.  The video and audio is the actual telecast, with the network announcers that were working that particular game.  I found both to be very satisfactory, and had I not known better, could have mistaken the recording for being a live telecast.  It was just what I was looking for, as I had wanted a recording of the complete Super Bowl game, not just the highlights that were provided in the dvd of the Seahawks championship season.  The two other games, versus New Orleans and San Francisco were just as much fun to watch, as both games had gone down to the wire before the final whistle.",1445817600,,949,4.680722891566265

6304049,5,B00IXPQUR6,"After the loss of the 2015 superbowl, this dvd has been a real morale booster. It is great to be able to watch a whole game in an hour, with NO commercials. It still had all the things I want: digital field markers for the downs, play announcers, replay of key plays, and as I said before, but best of all so worth repeating, NO commercials. The continual  play makes it a little intense, but since it's a dvd, you can stop it whenever YOU want to.",1426636800,,448,4.149425287356322

6304084,5,B00IXPQUR6,Awesome!,1421539200,,8,8.0
6304085,5,B00IXPQUR6,"Enjoyed watching all three games. Some of the angles in the replays weren't quite what I would have preferred, but a disclaimer was provided (in VERY SMALL PRINT) explaining that this might be such. It would have been nice to have seen all the pre/post Superbowl 'nuptials' --perhaps they would be on a another DVD of just the Superbowl itself?

I thought Troy Aikman was quite fair to both teams in his color commentaries of the NFC Championship game and the Superbowl. I also thought Mr Aikman was complimentary to Seahawks QB Russell Wilson in particular. Having been a former QB himself, Mr Aikman knows that there is more to being an NFL QB than being a ""game manager""!",1421107200,,674,4.663865546218488

6304089,5,B00IXPQUR6,"Seahawks first time to the Superbowl for the win (last time we were there the Pittsburg refs stole the win) and the complete domination of Denver was a masterpiece of the complete team from the guys behind the headphones to the guys on the field. Never has a team as good as the Broncos ever been so dominated in a Superbowl. GO HAWKS! Make sure to check out my blu-ray review of this, specially all you guys in Frisco.",1420588800,,419,4.3164556962025316

The set contains: Disc 1: Divisional round - Seahawks vs Saints, Disc 2: NFC Championship - Seahawks vs 49ers, Disc 3: Superbowl 48 - Seahawks vs Broncos. The video quality is not nearly as good as I expected, nor is the audio so I'm taking 1 star for that. Other than that, these are the games I wanted on disc to look back on for years to come as there are no guarantees a dominant run like that will ever happen again. Go Hawks!",1419811200,,584,4.36697247706422

6304111,4,B00IXPQUR6,"Great for all Seahawk Fans, the only negative is ""Troy Aikman"" who needs to listen to the petitions to remove him.  He needs to learn either from Michael Irvin to be ""open"" about his bias or from others who do NOT show any bias in the commentary.  I am from DFW Texas, but not a fan of the Cowboys, became a Seahawk fan while stationed in Seattle. It is great to rewatch the playoffs and the super bowl.  I subtract 1 star for both Aikman, and to me ""the Road"" means the whole season.  They need to reword it.",1418860800,,509,4.111111111111111
6304112,4,B00IXPQUR6,"Can't go wrong watching all the playoff games leading up to Super Bowl 48 if you are a Seahawks fan.

They did a great job of editing the three games included, there are very few instances where they jump in to the commentators conversation without any of the previous comments so you don't understand what they are talking about.

I wish they included the halftime show or some of the extras in the special features of the DVD.  It is a significant part of the experience of the event.",1418083200,,486,4.438202247191011

6304124,5,B00IXPQUR6,"My brother had requested a DVD of the Seahawks Superbowl which is exactly what this turned out to be. The title was misleading and at first I kept bypassing this one assuming it was more of a documentary style film of how they got to the Super Bowl. I'm glad I finally read the info! This is a 3 DVD set that has the broadcast coverage of the Superbowl game against the Denver Broncos as well as the final 2 Seahawks playoff games of that season, minus the commercials and half time stuff.",1417651200,,489,4.268817204301075

6304128,5,B00IXPQUR6,"This is a 2-Disc Blu Ray set.  Contains all 3 Championship games including the Super Bowl game.  Disc 1 contains the NFC Divisional Playoff Game against the New Orleans Saints, and the NFC Championship Game against the San Francisco 49ers.  Disc 2 is the Super Bowl XLVIII Game against the Denver Broncos.  The Super Bowl Game on this disc does not include the Post Game Celebration.  To watch the Super Bowl Post Game Celebration, you need to buy the other disc called ""Super Bowl XLVIII Champions"".  Since there are no commercials and some commentator extras may be edited out from the original broadcast, the games are slightly shortened and fast tracked.  The video looked fine, but the volume is slightly lower than usual.  So you might need to turn it up a bit.  For any Seahawks fans who missed watching any of these games or forgot moments within these games, this disc set is vital to re-live the memories of this extraordinary season of the Seattle Seahawks.",1416009600,3,968,4.748502994011976

But I am going to give it just 4 stars because of the editing of the games.  I feel that they could have done much better at cutting out the commercials.  The announcers get cut off and so forth.

It would have been nice to have had some of the post game interviews, but I also understand that it might have something to do with rights agreements with the networks.  And I get that.  But they cut out the whole Richard Sherman rant at the end of the 49rs game.  But then again, that might have been done at the request of Richard Sherman and the Seahawks.  But if you ask me, that's all part of the history of the season.  Being a Richard Sherman fan, I still would have liked to have had that for posterity.",1414454400,,800,4.103225806451613

6304195,5,B00IXPQUR6,"This is nothing more and nothing less than the complete footage (minus commercials) of the three playoff games, culminating in the Superbowl.  Not highlights, but the whole thing.  No bonus materials, no players or coaches miked-up on the field or sideline, just the regular TV broadcast with that commentary.  Given that the previously released Superbowl highlights DVD was frankly rather lame (albeit with great sideline chatter), this one represents a welcome keepsake for us Twelves.

Other than the games (edited for commercials), there's quite literally nothing else here though.  I would have personally hoped for a separate audio track with the local announcer - Steve Rabel if I remember correctly (hooooly catfish!) - but other than that minor quibble, the rest is as expected having watched the previous NFL Films release.

6304230,5,B00IXPQUR6,"Being a Seattle Seahawks fan since day one way back in 1976, this DVD set was truly the ultimate reward. Truly my only quibble was having to suffer through Troy Aikman's typically ""objective"" (insert sarcasm) broadcasting. Truly a reason why many NFL fans of many teams would like to see him removed to the point of petitions asking for his removal. I digress. Actually, I have to admit it is rewarding to hear him repeatedly put his his foot in his mouth. Case in point, the safety on the first play of the Super Bowl. Joe Buck points out ""the crowd was not a typical corporate crowd , it was loud"". Troy had to say the noise of the crowd (12th Man!) had nothing to do with it. Really? I suggest Troy listen to NFL's Sound FX of the Super Bowl game. Both Denver's head coach repeatedly mentioned the crowd noise was louder than they expected, and Peyton talking with the center saying he couldn't hear him.

The DVD set would have been 100% plus if it could have been Steve Raible and Warren Moon (instead of the inept Aikman) as it had been on the earlier released highlight DVD. Truly the only thing that saved me during the Super Bowl was the fact that I could stream KIRO radio online!",1406592000,16,1190,4.384615384615385

6304238,2,B00IXPQUR6,"I purchased the DVD version, and frankly there are much smaller mp4 recordings off HDTV (using up a quarter or less bytes) that look A LOT better video quality-wise. On DVD the game doesn't even look ""live."" I would suggest spending a few extra dollars for the Blu-ray version--which I ""assume"" is superior in quality. Good thing a new company is releasing this series, because the first post-Warner release--the Packers 2010 ""Road to""--remains the only one not released on Blu-ray. And the Packers have fewer buying fans than the Seahawks??? Update: I purchased the Blu-ray version--and I'm still giving it two stars. I can't understand why people are giving this five stars if they actually saw the HD broadcast; the aforementioned mp4 recordings actually look way more ""HD"" than this. It is apparent that the same poor quality source that was used for the DVD was used for the Blu-ray. I think this was done deliberately by the NFL; they didn't want the best quality video to be available for ""copying""; if that was the case, they still failed.",1404864000,,1047,4.854748603351955

6304241,3,B00IXPQUR6,"The great thing, of course, is that this package allows you to legally purchase the 2013/14 Seahawks play off run on disc.  If your a 12, I'm sure you'll agree that this was the most spectacular season ever.  And you do get all of the game play of the Divisional Playoff against the Saints, the Championship game against the 49ers and the Seahawks all out dismantling of the Denver ""Best Offense in the NFL Ever"" Broncos (numbers never lie, right?)  So, unless you still have all the games on your DVR, you probably want this regardless of what I have to say. Just know going into it, that not much time or energy was invested into making this package special for the fans.

I have been looking forward to owning these games in Blu-ray quality for months, but the presentation is highly disappointing, namely because the surround sound was stripped from the broadcasts!  The audio is presented in DTS HD Master Audio, but with only 2 channel stereo (no foreign language options either, despite the fact that the commentators refer to the Spanish language broadcast available in the live feed).  The video quality is fine.  It's presented in 1080 interlaced format.  I'm not sure why it's not progressive instead of interlaced, but with a bit rate nearly twice as high as the network feeds through my cable company, the video quality is slightly clearer than what I captured on my DVR.

Naturally, the commercials are edited out of the presentation, but the same is true of all of the pre and post game festivities!  There's no Star Spangled Banner, no coin toss, no half time show, etc.  They show Russel Wilson's post game interview, but then it fades to black.  They didn't even show the presentation of the Lombardi Trophy!

It doesn't surprise me that the musical portions were edited out due to licensing and what not, but it's senseless to not show the coin toss and the trophy presentation.  And what is available on the ""Special Features"" menu on disc 2 to accompany the Super Bowl?  Pop-up trivia facts.  That's the best they could do?

I would have liked to have seen the brilliant ""Sound FX"" episode that NFL Films put together included, some post game interviews, highlights from media day (all of the ridiculous controversy surround Marshawn Lynch not talking to the press).  Maybe a featurette about Richard Sherman, Russell Wilson, etc.  So many great stories to tell about this incredible team, but instead of making disc two a dual layer disc and packing it with extras, we get a bare bones edit of the gameplay with no surround sound.  They could have used the multiple camera angle feature to add some of the great footage NFL Films shot alongside the original network video, even better, they could have given us an alternate audio track with the local radio broadcast audio from Steve Raible and Warren Moon.  Some much potential for this to be a great package, but the lack of surround sound really blows this for me.  I saw that on the package before I took the discs home, but I was hoping that was a typo...

But at the end of the day, ""It's all about the action boss"" and all the gameplay is here.  The Seattle Seahawks are Super Bowl XLVIII Champions and nobody can take that away from us!",1402099200,74,3216,4.651327433628318
6304242,3,B00IXPQUR6,"I purchased this elsewhere today, and the DVR recording from Dish I have saved is better, you lose the transition back to the game from commercials (and the commercials) just has straight plays.  Example, The start of the super bowl it goes straight to the kickoff, no coin toss or anything.
Also the video is interlaced,  you must turn on deinterlace in your player if it supports it or it looks awful.  Not recorded in progressive, is in 1080i
Should have the half time show and all the other goodies from the broadcast.  These are just the 3 games of the playoffs, nothing more.
