3871647,1,B00283QEKW,"This is dramatization (and not one of the better.)  I feel that the one starring Mark Harmon is a better bio-drama.

3871663,1,B00283QEKW,The movie definitely didn't go by the book on what some things actually happened in certain parts of the movie. It does show you though what kind of person he was.,1456963200,,163,4.290322580645161

3871672,3,B00283QEKW,"I wasn't too impressed with this movie, maybe because it was filmed in the 70's and I never liked those years or the styles. Just wasn't a high quality film to me.",1453507200,,163,4.125

3871678,3,B00283QEKW,OK but I wouldn't watch it again,1446249600,,32,3.7142857142857144
3871679,4,B00283QEKW,"For so much gore, there is limited time to show it all. I lived no more than 2 blocks from the Chi Omega sorority (Florida State University) where he bludgeoned several women. It just made it all seem that much more of a small world. To hear his final interview on youtube, he definitely seems normal (when he wants to be). I think the actor played this out well in this movie. Both in the movie and in his final interview, he claims pornography was a major influence in his decision making leading up to the murders. Who knows? Worth watching if nothing more than to stay aware of who may walk among us at any time.",1443916800,,616,4.273504273504273
3871680,1,B00283QEKW,"Horrendous.  For the record this is not the film Amazon claims it to be.  The real film by Matthew Bright and starring Michael Reilly Burke is a solid film.  It is well written, exceptionally directed and the film follows the best actor to portray Ted Bundy of all time,  This movie however,.... yeesh.  Nothing about it was believable and that's something since it was all true!",1443139200,2,379,4.681818181818182
3871681,2,B00283QEKW,"Just saw a heavily edited for TV broadcast of the
direct-to-video biopic BUNDY: An American Icon (2008).

Perhaps whole segments were deleted, for this film seems mightily fragmented.
What was shown is definitely TV-14, as suggested by post-commecial bumpers.

Ted Bundy is depicted as a troubled little boy who never grew up, but that
can't even hint at the jump necessary to make him a sociopathic serial killer.

Most annoying beyond its spotty continuity is gosh-awful music tracks  that
are poor simulations of early '70s folk and blues rock tunes.
Worse, they intrude at inopportune moments.

So is BUNDY worth seeing? Debatable. Is it worth owning? No way!",1436745600,,663,5.101851851851852
3871682,5,B00283QEKW,this is by far my favorite ted bundy film,1415923200,,41,3.6666666666666665
3871683,5,B00283QEKW,"I bought this DVD because I was interested in seeing the actor Corin Nemec play the role of the criminal of the
psychopath ""Bundy."".  Nemec's portrayal showed his talent and that he has captured this character to a point of
superior level.",1376956800,,239,4.690476190476191
3871684,1,B00283QEKW,"Oh my...we barely made it through this movie.  The movie was horribly acted and missing alot of parts.  It flip flopped back and forth in time and showed alot of scenes where Bundy was drinking....drinking near a campfire, drinking while walking down a hall, drinking while driving a beetle, drinking while sitting in a parked beetle.  The movie didn't explain that he was living with a woman while the murders were done..nor did it mention the ski lodge or the 12 year old girl he kidnapped.  The movie was poorly acted, badly directed, lacked alot of information and was just boring.  I watched The Deliberate Stranger a while back and that was an enjoyable Bundy movie....this one was a waste of time and I am glad I didn't pay more than $2.00 for it.",1298937600,3,754,4.597014925373134
3871685,3,B00283QEKW,"Not one of the best serial killer flicks out there but ""Bundy: A Legacy of Evil"" has its moments.  I thought Corin Nemec did an admirable job as Ted Bundy as did Jen Nikolaisen as his girlfriend Stephanie.  I loved the scene in the restaurant after they rekindle their romance.  The scene in the dorm with the two sleeping coeds is definitely the most gruesome scene in the movie, but this film missed out with a soundtrack that simply didn't fit and some hokey acting by others (the sheriff who arrests him in the desert, the warden and the officer on the stand).  Don't get me wrong, this is a must for those who enjoy serial killer flicks.  It is much better than many...but not as good as some.  3 stars.",1292112000,4,708,4.366412213740458
3871686,2,B00283QEKW,"We all know the life story of Bundy and his killing sprees. The movie tells the infamous, gory details and the insanity he displayed in court. I believe the acting was over the top because it showed that Bundy acted strangely when talking to women, when in reality he acted normal and charming.

Perhaps, the most important detail that was left out is that his victims didn't know the truth about him, but during his trial and when it became obvious how evil he was, women were falling head over heels for him. I can't forget the court scene when all women there colored their hair brown and parted it in the middle because they thought Bundy liked it. The fact that some women will fall for bad guys and be fascinated by them is as dark a mystery as the evil Bundy possessed!

8355591,1,B00283QEKW,Most of the movie was random music playing. When they talked you could barely hear them. Not even sure what was going on the story line was all over the place.,1467676800,,159,4.161290322580645
