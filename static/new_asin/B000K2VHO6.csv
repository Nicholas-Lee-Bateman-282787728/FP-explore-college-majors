8154101,5,B000K2VHO6,"If you are interested in learning how to make West African meals like Jellof Rice, Palm Butter and other dishes then this is the video for you.  I fell in love with Liberian food when I started hanging out with a friend of mine named Gbiankador (pronounced Bianka-Dor) who is from Liberia.  Bianka's mom would make cassava leaf and would always have to make xtra because of me lol.  The video is a bit low budget but the quality of the video is clear as well as the audio quality.  There is also a link that you can click to print out the ingredients and recipes.  Everything is done step by step and at a reasonable pace.  The camera gets up into the pots and pans so you will know how things are suppose to look as you are cooking.  The ingredients are easily found at your local supermarket with the exception of cassava leaf, palm oil and a certain kind of bean which is used.  I am glad that I purchased this video and you will be too!",1171238400,8,940,4.212290502793296
