8236563,5,B000J3D52S,"Sick and tired of watching the History Channel's barely accurate accounts of WWII in Europe?  Then this DVD is for you!  Here's some amazing movies made during the war by the U.S. Army and Army Air Forces, showing the situation on the ground as it developed in 1943 as the Allies pushed up Italy towards Rome.  No slouch the directors of these films, who were some of Hollywood's best!  William Wyler, who is known for his film ""The Memphis Belle"" and ""The Fighting Lady"", delivers with ""Thunderbolt!"" an absolutely riveting full color film about the campaign to knock out Nazi supply lines.  John Huston, the dean of American art house directors -- the Soderberg of his day I guess --  created one of the most moving and important films about the war, ""The Battle of San Pietro"", which is every bit as impressive today as when it came out.  Also on this DVD are other films about the overall Italian campaign and the Anzio landings.  All in all, it's a real treat!",1161475200,,965,4.569767441860465
