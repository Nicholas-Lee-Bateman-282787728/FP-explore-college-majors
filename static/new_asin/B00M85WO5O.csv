8670645,5,B00M85WO5O,This Is A Wonderfull Doctor Who Blu-ray. The Steelbook Is Beautiful & The Special Features Played Just Fine On My Pioneer Blu-ray Writer. I Am A Very Happy Customer.,1522886400,,165,4.724137931034483
8670646,5,B00M85WO5O,"Before Doctor Who was a load of PC nonsense, it was one of the greatest shows on television. Series 1-4 is what I refer to as the ""Golden Era"" of Doctor Who. Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant are both incredible as the Doctor and were both clearly born for the role. Russell T Davies is an amazing head writer and couldn't have done a better job with his wonderful story arcs and climaxes. Six outta five stars!",1521676800,,417,4.428571428571429
8670647,3,B00M85WO5O,"I cannot see a discussion board on the product page so I am going to ask my question here: what is the difference between Doctor Who ""Series"" and Doctor Who ""Season"" Blu-ray titles? This product is Doctor Who - Series 2 [Blu-ray]. There is Doctor Who - Season 2 [Blu-ray] that appears to contain the same episodes but  cheaper.",1518220800,,327,4.5423728813559325
8670648,5,B00M85WO5O,So glad I found these on Blu-ray.,1515196800,,33,3.857142857142857
8670649,3,B00M85WO5O,"I love Doctor Who, but as someone who is hearing impaired ... the subtitles worked sometimes and sometimes not.  A little disappointing.",1515024000,,136,5.181818181818182
8670650,5,B00M85WO5O,"I love this Blu-ray edition of series-02 in the steelbook package. I assume most people reading this are already familiar with Doctor Who, so I'll just say that this was David Tennant's first season as the 10th Doctor, and is for the most part great fun to watch. Though upconverted from standard definition source video, the picture appears very sharp and clear - even when compared to ""The Next Doctor"" special which was also upconverted. The audio seems to be uncompressed and is also an improvement over the original DVD release.

Also, I purchased this from Amazon.co.uk for the equivalent of US $32.17 - a lot less that the $78.99 price on Amazon.com.

Those things said, I want to address the playabilty issues mentioned in a couple of other reviews. The disc's are NOT region coded and the episodes will play on most (if not all) North American region-A/1 Blu-ray players. There have been complaints that the special features wouldn't play on those players. Well, you can play the special features provided your Blu-ray player can also play the European PAL system DVD format. The special features are in that format: PAL 576x720, 25-fps, so your player must either convert on-the-fly (if your TV isn't PAL compatible), OR play PAL format AND your TV must be compatible with that resolution and frame rate. (Sadly, many aren't.)  My player, a LG BD610, plays PAL and NTSC system videos just fine on whatever North American TV I use. Finding which players will handle the formats involved could be tricky because the manufacturers and retailers don't advertise such things. I lucked into the player I have. I hope this is helpful.",1505433600,5,1637,4.881294964028777
8670651,5,B00M85WO5O,"Wonderful writing, acting, and directing. Takes you through a wonderful emotional journey as you fall in love with The Doctor all over again and ends it with an incredible finale that leaves you eagerly awaiting the next installment.",1496016000,,233,5.157894736842105
8670652,4,B00M85WO5O,"As stated in another review, the special features are not viewable on a region 1 US blu-ray player. The episode content is not region locked and is playable. The show itself plays perfectly and is an improvement over the DVDs. I can't wait to get seasons 3 and 4 to complete my collection. And I do plan to upgrade to a region free player in the future (also available on Amazon) to watch all of the behind the scenes goodies.",1494115200,2,426,4.3375
