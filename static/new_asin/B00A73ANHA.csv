5391791,5,B00A73ANHA,My favorite cowboys are back again! Can't wait to saddle up and ride with the Cartwright boys but it ends when four becomes three .,1360281600,2,131,4.28
5391792,5,B00A73ANHA,"On Tuesday, January 16, 1973, the 430th and final new Bonanza, The Hunter, guest starring Tom Skeritt, was broadcast on NBC. Over the decades I have known people who will only watch through the Adam era, or who will stick through Candy's original run, but won't watch the Jaimie years of the 1970's, but I believe the entire series is great. I've bought these first five seasons, and have been thrilled with the extras on the four seasons I have received, and the fact that CBS has released full seasons on the same day. I have watched the ""lost episodes"" on cable (from the latter part of the show's run, and been impressed with their quality) and baffled to why NBC didn't release them together with the earlier episodes into rerun syndication 40 years ago? Unlike Gunsmoke, which was split into 3 packages for half hour, hour black and white, and hour color, all Bonanza's are an hour in color, and could have been syndicated together. I'm looking forward to the whole show on disc. Keep up the digital remastering, too, please, CBS.",1358294400,20,1036,4.666666666666667
5391793,5,B00A73ANHA,"I purchased the first 4 seasons of the digitally remastered Bonanza episodes and can't begin to say how pleased I am with the quality and the extra's, from the still photos to the video documentaries. I can't wait to get season 5 especially since this was the season that Adam had an on going love interest, although I'm glad the writers did not marry him off. They did not make a very good couple in my opinion.",1358121600,5,412,4.363636363636363
5391794,5,B00A73ANHA,I used to sneak peeks through the bannisters when my folks watched Bonanza.  It was on way too late for a school night. Fun to watch the forbidden fruit now that I am a grandma.  They have been remastered and the extras are interesting.,1357948800,14,236,4.340909090909091
5391795,5,B00A73ANHA,"No question why ""Bonanza"" was #2 in the annual ratings this season, along with the largest average audience (36.9 million) in the history of the series--it was the most consistently entertaining of the six years Pernell Roberts was with the show.  One episode (""The Pure Truth"" 03-08-64) was not only the highest rated of all 14 seasons, it also ranked as one of the top rated television episodes (over 40 million viewers)of all time.

5391796,3,B00A73ANHA,The Bonanza writers tried to be comedians in Season 5. Oftentimes it is somewhat corny than funny. All the colors are bright and images are clear. Excellent work in renewing the films.,1516406400,,184,4.78125

5391806,4,B00A73ANHA,BONANZA was a great show. After Adam left it seemed to slowly morph into little house on the prairie. Also comedy episodes were becoming way too numerous. When I want comedy I watch my Abbot and Costello shows.,1488585600,,210,4.552631578947368

5391816,5,B00A73ANHA,"I am not the only one to pretend that in season 5,BONANZA reached it's peak. Some many good episodes like JOURNEY REMEMBERED about HOSS's SWEEDISH mother;the funny HOSS and the LEPRECHAUNS and i could go on and on. You even have a ghost town episode. Like season 3 of the VIRGINIAN,this season of BONANZA is AMERICAN television at it's very bestYou need this in your dvd library. The show will never get better after this,although season 6,the last season with PERNELL ROBERTS is also worth watching. Several episodes in the second half of the season featured GUY WILLIAMS(ZORRO) as BEN's nephew WILL and ADAM almost marries(no kidding).",1470355200,2,637,4.962616822429907

5391863,5,B00A73ANHA,"This one keeps you hooked to a fine series with a fine cast.
Final shows for Pernell Roberts and he did some of his finest acting because of it.  Michael Landon's getting stronger and he is coming into his own with writing and directing.  Dan Blocker's role is expanding and Lorne Greene is ever the best father figure.
All ages will enjoy this...now how about seasons seven and eight!",1390694400,,385,4.565217391304348

I jumped out of order because this season contains my favorite episode of all, ""Hoss and the Leprechans"".  This episode in ""Volume 1"" contains an informative commentary track.  The restoration of the episodes is magnificent and despite so many episodes that were ""public domain"" that have been available in the past, it's still not ""Bonanza"" without one of the most well known TV themes in history, and you can only get that on the official CBS Home Video releases.",1386979200,,572,4.757575757575758

This package of DVD's contain the original soundtrack, perfect picture, audio, etc.  I am very happy with this and will be buying the other seasons as well to add to my collection.

5391878,5,B00A73ANHA,"I own seasons 2 - 5 and season 5 may be my favorite for several reasons. It seems all have really grown into their parts., especially Adam and Hoss. They seem to be showcased especially in season 5. The color and background are great. There are a couple of shows I don't care for though, the lepracauns and Joes double seem like fhey don' t fit with what overall is a great season.

My younger brother and I would crawl out on our bellies to sneak a few more peeks before deciding we better obey our parents. To be able to see these Dvds with the original NBC peacock introduction is a wonderful trip down memory lane! The shows themselves are great, you become so involved with the characters. Hoss is my all time favorite television character.  Can't wait to purchase more.",1367193600,3,622,4.553571428571429

The color and quality is great on all of them and all of the extras and special features really add to the sets. I just wish they would release them faster. Please keep them coming.

5391896,5,B00A73ANHA,"I must admit, Paramount has done a loving restoration of this series.  Finally, the 5th season set delivers at a price that doesn't break the bank.

In 1991, NBC did a tribute to the late Michael Landon's 30+year career with the network. That was the last time I saw pristine prints of the Adam-era Bonanza episodes (albeit clips) grace my television screen.  For decades, all we've seen are blurry, faded 16mm syndication prints that have aired as part of the ""classic 360"" syndication series sold to most TV and cable outlets throughout the country.  This collection takes you back to the 1963-64 television season and treats to you Bonanza, the way it looked when it originally aired on NBC.  Crisp picture, no edits & restored color. I was surprised to see they even included the NBC ""living color"" peacock bumper in front of each episode, plus the vignettes done by Lorne Greene, Dan Blocker, Pernell Roberts & Michael Landon for Chevrolet, the original sponsor.

Best of all, Amazon delivers the complete season for a $40.00 pre-order price.  That's $10 less than the selling price for seasons 1-4.  This is my first purchase of Bonanza on DVD. If Paramount & Amazon keep the rest of the series at this price, it won't be my last.",1362182400,4,1236,4.742990654205608
5391897,5,B00A73ANHA,"at last my favorite season of my favorite western is available. no other series could boast the heart-tugging, dramatic and humorous episodes that bonanza could. there are four stand-out episodes for me in this season: calamity over the comstock with one of my favorite actresses, stefanie powers; twilight town with an amazing plot and ending; no less a man that showcases the
wisdom of sheriff roy coffee; and walter and the outlaws that showcases the wisdom of a dog! and the greatest episode ever for all seasons is hoss and the leprechauns. it contains everything any tv show ever should. if you love a great western you must order this season of bonanza.",1361836800,14,660,4.849557522123894
5391898,5,B00A73ANHA,"Don't be bushwhacked by pretenders - the OFFICIAL season releases are well worth the wait. Breathtaking audio/visuals are as clear as the waters of Lake Tahoe. Insightful commentary by Andy Klyde adds a thoughtful perspective to the ""extras."" Season 5 includes so many classics, and the uncut OFFICIAL versions are truly like seeing them for the first time.

I HIGHLY recommend this set of DVDs whether or not you have the first four.  And if you don't have the first four, I recommend those too. :-)
The DVDs were delivered on the date promised in Excellent condition.
