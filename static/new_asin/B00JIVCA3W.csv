8651177,5,B00JIVCA3W,"This is a scholarly yet practical and engaging conversation about the most important fundamentals of a life with sticks in your hands. (I don't mean chopsticks) Whether you are a professional or an amateur with high standards this is the starting place of attaining reliable and enduring musicality, precision and sensitivity.
Warm and casual yet filled with the benefits of learning from a master who has several lifetimes of experience at the highest level of music performance. This is no one trick pony.  When you think of the range of musical expression Mr. Lang had to bring to the stage year in and year out with the greatest composers and most demanding conductors and colleagues; well it gives pause.
If this is your first encounter with Morris Lang, it will mark I hope the beginning of a journey leading to mastery of your relationship to the drum stick/mallet and music making.",1404777600,8,889,4.887417218543046
