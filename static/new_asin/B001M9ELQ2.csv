3694785,4,B001M9ELQ2,"Universal brings to DVD four of Clint Eastwood's post spaghetti western films,and they show a star on the cusp of super-stardom. Two directed by Eastwood himself(The Eiger Sanction and Play Misty For Me) and two by his good friend director Don Siegal(Coogan's Bluff and The Beguiled).
Let's take each film from what I consider the best and end with my least favourite.
Play Misty For Me,1971,concerns the story of a Carmel,California DJ(Eastwood).He starts getting regular on air phone calls from a listener requesting the song Misty. Clint has been trying to woo back an ex girlfriend,so far unsuccessfully,when said Misty requester finds his local watering hole and gets him at just the right time. He beds her but she keeps coming back again and again,many times unannounced and taking too many liberties unnerving Clint. He tries to straighten her out first politely then forcefully ,but she will not stop trying to contact him. Clint does finally succeed in getting his ex back but his indescretion is haunting him day and night. Things turn very violent and nasty as she terribly maims Clint's housekeeper,kidnaps his ex and kills a policeman. Clint barely excapes with his life.
Misty still packs quite a punch and will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. Jessica Walter really plays the part of his stalker beautifully.
Coogan's Bluff,1968,concerns an Arizona policeman(Clint) who comes to New York to take into custody a felon who is wanted back in his jurisdiction. Upon arrival he is told his ""charge"" is in Bellevue and won't be out for some time. It's a ""don't call us,we'll call you"" thing which Clint chafes at. He goes to the hospital to get him on the pretense he has permission from the NYPD.At the airport he is jumped by the felon's co-horts and he escapes. It's a mad hunt all over New York and Clint comes in contact with some very strange and grubby people. A wild motorcycle chase in a park ends in the final take down of his prisoner and his return to Arizona.
It was a tie whether to list this one next or The Eiger,but I think this JUST edges it out. It's a pretty straightforward story but an interesting one and the pace nevers weakens too much. The 60s really creep into the story line however. Watch for that crazy discoteque Eastwood is forced to go into.
The Eiger Sanction,1975,concerns a top secret organization of the US Government that wants Eastwood to return to their fold to do another job for them,after one of their agents was taken out in Europe. After much persuasion and more than a little coersion,Eastwood finally agrees. It seems the man they want is going to be climbing the Eiger Mountain in Switzerland but they are not sure who it will be. Eastwood must find out before HE is killed. Eastwood trains with an old buddy in the States but is hounded by an ex military buddy,now working for the other side. Before he leaves to climb,he is forced to eliminate him as he finds out it was he who supplied the other side with the info on who to kill in Europe in the first place. The climb is upon him and the only info he has is that it is someone with a limp. All but Eastwood die and in a strange twist in the end he finds the man he was to kill was close to him all the time.
This film hasn't lost much of its' appeal either. It has an interesting story line but at times it tends to get bogged down in itself,but usually  not for long. Jack Cassidy does a great turn as a homosexual who comes to his untimely end and George Kennedy,his old friend..
Finally The Beguiled,1971. Eastwood is a corporal in the union army who is wounded near a seminary for girls run by a head mistress played by Geraldine Page. He is almost captured a couple of times but is saved by Page. However Eastwood is not the saint(Quaker,to be specific)he is pretending to be. His presence disrupts the seminary and it brings to the fore suppressed feelings amongst a 17 and 22 year old and the head mistress herself. Eastwood is like the fox in the proverbial hen house and when the 22 year old catches him with the 17 year old,a tussle ensues and Eastwood goes careening down a spiral staircase. His leg is broken and the head mistress decides to amputate just above the knee. When Eastwood learns of what she has done he is in a vengeful mood. Before he can do any harm he is poisoned and carried dead outside the gates of the seminary.
This is one of the oddest if not THE oddest film Eastwood ever did. And it is probably the only one that portrays Eastwood in the role of a bad person;a manipulating cad to the girls and women in the film and a lecher to us. In the scene where he gets his leg amputated,while they don't actually show the process,you hear every little scrapping pass of the hack saw. It makes one cringe and it is something they should have left out. From the reception this film got it is likely Eastwood learned that the public wanted their man on the up and up and portrayed in a more positive light. This is an Eastwood film that has always been the lowest on my list of his films.
Despite what YOU may think of each film,I must tell you Universal has done a tremendous job in their releasing of these films. Each film has been digitally remastered to perfection here and they are in the best shape they have ever been in. An absolute joy to watch.
There are three discs included here. The first one has Play Misty For Me,the second The Eiger Sanction,and the third contains The Beguiled and Coogan's Bluff. The first two discs contain the special features which include a featurette looking  back at Play Misty For Me,one on Eastwood's directing and acting at the same time,photo galleries and others.
All in all this is a set worth I recommend to all Eastwood fans out there. This is an Eastwood on the verge of superstardom and on a personal basis,it was Play Misty For Me that really put him on my radar screen way back when and I have been a fan ever since. Remastered beautifully this release is bound to please his fans and maybe even make new ones.",1236124800,7,6014,4.496343692870201
3694786,4,B001M9ELQ2,"""Clint Eastwood: American Icon Collection""  is a box set containing four Eastwood feature films.  In his directorial debut, ""Play Misty For Me,"" Eastwood stars as a radio DJ who becomes the victim of psychotic obsession when he tries to end a torrid affair with a fan (Jessica Walter) in a forerunner of ""Fatal Attraction.""  ""The Eiger Sanction"" is an action thriller about a professional assassin who is forced out of retirement to avenge a friend's murder in the Swiss Alps.  ""Coogan's Bluff"" finds Eastwood as a soft-spoken, no-nonsense Arizona lawman whose unusual methods of capturing an escaped murderer cause havoc with a tough New York City police lieutenant (Lee J. Cobb).  ""The Beguiled"" is a psychological thriller that combines love, betrayal, and hidden passions.  Eastwood is a wounded Civil War soldier who finds shelter in an all-girls academy.
 In ""The Beguiled,"" Eastwood's John McBurney is more of a sexual character than Eastwood typically portrays.  Geraldine Page plays the wary headmistress and Elizabeth Hartman is the teacher who falls in love with him.  Director Don Siegel shifts the tone of the film to one of horror about midway through, incorporating a good deal of violence.
 The three-disc set includes many bonus extras, including a  featurette on the making of ""Play Misty For Me,"" a photo montage, production notes, and a featurette in which Eastwood and director Don Siegel discuss their five-film collaboration.",1235692800,30,1448,5.225108225108225

3694811,4,B001M9ELQ2,"I normally love Clint Eastwood, that remains true in 3 of these movies. Play Misty For Me was a departure from his normal tried and true character types, very refreshing and chilling as well. Excellent performances by all, Clint was very believable in a character I couldn't help but be empathetic for. I had seen The Beguiled a very long time ago when I was still quite young and never forgot it. I don't think The Beguiled is one of his better known movies, which is a shame. It, too, is a departure from his normal role types, however, he is not the hero in this movie. That makes it a departure for him. His character is actually quite loathsome, but it's Clint, so you can't quite hate him, either. If you've never seen The Beguiled, I do highly recommend you do so. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with it. In The Eiger Sanction, Clint is an anti hero hero, you start rooting for him when you shouldn't be and in the end, rooting for him definitely feels worth it. Clint had taken on some really interesting roles in his storied career, and these three are by all means a must watch in my opinion. The one disappointment is Coogan's Bluff. I almost didn't watch the whole thing and I am convinced I would have done myself a favor if I had stopped watching it all the way through. I'm not sure why they included Coogan's Bluff on this collection, but for me, it was a real let down and doesn't belong on here. Clint rarely disappoints, but he managed it with Coogan's Bluff. I just was not impressed at all by it. The good news is, the other three movies more than make up for it. Still worth the purchase.",1445385600,,1618,4.360927152317881
3694812,5,B001M9ELQ2,"Play Misty for Me is terrorizing, the original Fatal Attraction. I loved it. All the others are very good also. ' The Eiger Sanction', has many raw scenes of mountain climbing but to me ends strangely. In Coogan's Bluff he plays a western deputy sheriff who comes to NYC to pick up prisoner to bring back to Arizona. It was good non Dirty Harry but typical Eastwood role. I found 'The Beguiled' to be very different then the other films. He is a wounded Yankee soldier found and taking in by girls and woman school mistress of all girls school. He is a little unscrupulous and takes advantage of 2 of the girls, one only 17 and even makes it with the head mistress as they protect him from capture. Needless to say this leads to complications for Clint as he is double dealing them. It doesn't end good for him, to say the least. Rare bad ending for Clint. But I enjoyed it none the less.
 Good packaging, storing of discs and very good remastering make for a very highly recommended collection.",1445040000,,995,4.437158469945355

All these movies deserve a second look and if you are a baby boomer like myself this will be that second look if you order. If you like the Eastwood style you will love these. It is really a nice reflection of how good Clint was in the early days. His charisma and doggedly straight forward style mark these movies with an impressive aura of good versus evil.

I have to smile at some of the dialog but 1971, i guess they said junk like i had to find out where I'm at, 'see how you are?'  the best line of all is when the weirdo chick shows up after her no strings declaration with  sacks of groceries and david explains 'there's a thing called a telephone, i pick it up i ask you what your doing and you..'  weirdo states 'say i'll be right over'... please forgive me for misquotes but you get the idea, i guess she didn't seem desperate to him when she said be right over... but hey clint didn't write it for cripes sake.
i  love the beguiled also, another off the road from clint's tough guy movies and i may not be that bright but a little confusing for me i never read it, and have decided to even though it's out of print.
the eiger santion is the first movie i actually saw in the theater with my man in it, my mother had a thing for him (she denies it now because of the silly speech, how dumb of her i mean) i was soooo scared of the red background with the albino evil man, my mother had to assure me several times he had contacts in, i fell asleep then but not because it was bad it was the days of 2 movies in a indoor theater, ashland oregon the varsity had a balcony then and double features, anyway, it's good and you'll be able to tell where indian jones raiders got it's idea in the beginning.  i also agree that fatal attraction really had to have seen play misty  for me.,
haven't seen coogan's bluff because i just got his 35 years with warner..  anyway, if mr.eastwood ever reads these, we could live together, i promise i am very creative (have at least 10 outlines of novels in my closet) and i will never want a reality show to film me!!!!  actually your son seems nice too, i was born in 1964.",1354320000,,2066,4.0814814814814815

3694887,4,B001M9ELQ2,"You can't beat getting a value priced set movies starring one of cinema's most beloved stars.  Here you get four of Mr. Eastwood's earlier films, all in anamorphic widescreen presentations, and a bevy of extra features.

In Play Misty For Me, a smooth talking radio DJ woos and seduces an avid fan.  When he shoots her down once is steady girlfriend enters the picture, his conquest turns homicidal and he learns that some hearts should never be broken.  Though the film is heavily dated, it does serve as an early template for the shocker classic Fatal Attraction.  Also I do believe that this was Eastwood's first job in the director's seat.

The Beguiled has Mr. Eastwood playing a wounded Civil War soldier who is taken in by a school of young girls and their sexually repressed head mistress.  Once again, he turns on the charm and seduces several of the ladies until the tables are turned on him and he pays the ultimate price for his cowardice.  This and Misty were two reasons I bought this collection and are the two strongest films in this set, in my opinion.

In Coogan's Bluff, Mr. Eastwood plays a lawman very similar to his iconic Dirty Harry persona.  His ways of apprehending his targets violate every rule in the book and angers the city cop whom he is paired with.  An ok movie but a little to Dirty Harry for me.  One is enough.

And finally we have The Eiger Sanctum which is, by far, the worse.  He plays some ex-spy lured out of retirement to avenge the death of a former comrad. I can't give a full review here since I couldn't get through this one's first twenty minutes let alone the entire run time. I just wasn't interested in it and soon grew bored.

The colors aren't bleeding everywhere and the dirt is finally cleaned up. Play Misty For Me looks just as good! I am shocked these titles look this good at this super low price for these four classics. Could be because Play and Eiger have their own discs, where Coogan's Bluff and Beguiled share a disc. Even with two movies crammed on one disc, never seen The Beguiled look this good!
The video quality alone is worth the price and not the lack of special features. Would one day like to hear some Eastwood commentary on Play Misty for Me, but that is a small thing compared to this great package!
Now Universal needs to go back and remaster the three western pack (they look good, but could be better).

I don't want to spoil it for those of you who haven't seen it but it was like seeing the film for the first time.

3694898,3,B001M9ELQ2,"""The Beguiled"" weaves the somber tale of a Civil War yank who gets injured and is taken in by an all-girl's school south of the line. What starts as a brooding drama soon turns into a tense thriller around the final 40 or so minutes. This is why ""The Beguiled"" is arguably my favorite film in this pack. Though a bit slow and a bit sappy occasionally, the tense atmosphere, rich in sensuality and chilling moments, is palpable. Acting is serviceable, and as you can imagine, Eastwood shines as the mentally and even physically-decaying John McBurney. All around a solid thriller, rife with a sense of fear and even a bit of romance. 7/10.

In ""Play Misty for Me"", Eastwood plays an LA disc jockey who is terrorized by an obsessed fan when he falls for another woman. I can't say much about this one; it's decent. There's a few creepy moments here and there but it never quite gets to that height of terror one hopes for. Eastwood's first-time directing is pretty solid, and he'll just continue to perfect it from there. His acting is decent, but it's really Jessica Walter who shines here as the unhinged Evelyn, who can be a sweet little thing one moment, and a shrieking monster the next with little effort. But overall it just has a sort of ""prototype"" feel, a sort of cinematic blueprint for tighter and slightly better future films like ""Fatal Attraction"" or ""Misery"". Worth a watch or two still anyway. 6/10.

""Coogan's Bluff"" is about an Arizona cop who heads to New York to take a criminal into his own custody. But everything spirals out of control when Coogan decides to rip through all the red tape, allowing the criminal to escape into the psychedelic world of 1968 New York; Coogan does what he can to get his man back. This is an odd movie; it tries hard to be a cop thriller but instead focuses heavily on the hippie culture so prevalent at the time. That mixed with with a random action scene here and there,  prolonged, cheesy dialogue, and lots of ""searching"" scenes make for something of an uneven film. Watchable, but only just. 5/10.

""The Eiger Sanction"" is the weakest film in this set, a tale of Eastwood as an assassin who heads to Switzerland to find one of three potential killers of his friend, a fellow assassin. Everything that was wrong with ""Coogan's Bluff"" is doubled in this. Mainly, this flick suffers from mood changes, feeling like James Bond movie one minute, then a lame comedy, then a romance film, and lastly a mountain-climbing thriller. The dialogue is horrendous, filled with lame and sometimes even tasteless ""jokes"" (we get not one but two jokes about RAPE), and Eastwood's directing this time around is pretty stale. If you want a solid mountain-climbing thriller, go elsewhere; this won't feature such events until its FINAL 25 MINUTES. Silly protagonists, sillier antagonists, bad dialogue and a lack of action scenes bury this Eastwood entry deep in the snow. 4/10.",1288742400,2,2915,4.709803921568628

I don't regard this as a collection of Eastwood's better movies, but all are quite good entertainment. Plus, as packaged, the movies cost only a little over four dollars each and to get high quality movies at this price is indeed a bargain.

I reviewed each of the movies separately, so I see little need to go back over the reviews here since you can get my thoughts by going to any of the titles. My favorite was ""Play Misty for Me. ""My least favorite was ""The Beguiled."" ""Coogan's Bluff would rank second and ""The Eiger Sanction"" third. I gave Misty five stars and the other three four.

3694905,5,B001M9ELQ2,"I stumbled across this collection at Wal-Mart and snatched it up. I figured for $12.00, it was a low-risk purchase.

Turns out, it was a great deal. Each of these movies has been remastered and looks/sounds great.  ""Misty"" was the first film Eastwood directed, but even back then the man clearly had talent.  ""Misty"" is, in fact, a very good suspense film, with plenty of clever touches and intelligent subtext to match. (Note at the beginning of the film, Eastwood's character is outside his former girlfriend's house looking through the window.  Here HE is the stalker.) The only flaw in the film is a rather amateurish soundtrack.  Eastwood had a limited budget, and the composer he hired had never scored a film before. Also, there's an extended romantic scene between Eastwood and Donna Mills that frankly seems to belong in a different film.

The ""Beguiled"" is definitely one of director Don Siegel's most ambitious, artful films, and it's entertaining seeing Eastwood play a character who's a lot more complictated than, say, Dirty Harry.

""Coogen's Bluff,"" was also helmed by Siegel.  The story is fairly entertaining, but the real fun is seeing an Eastwood character making his way through a New York City setting. As far as I know, this is the only film where that takes place.

As for the ""Eiger Sanction,"" the less said the better.  The script is incredibly stupid, which goes to show Eastwood is a good director only as long as he has a decent script.  It's hard to believe how he gave a pass to some of the lines the characters in this film utter.

Along with the movies is a good documentary about ""Misty"" with interviews by the participlants thirty years later, and a second documentary about the films Siegel and Eastwood made together.",1258156800,8,1753,4.806666666666667
