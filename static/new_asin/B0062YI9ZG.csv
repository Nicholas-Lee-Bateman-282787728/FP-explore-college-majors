8491550,5,B0062YI9ZG,C'est un magnifique ballet s'inspirant musicalement des trois grands ballets de Tchakovsky. La chorgraphie est particulirement belle et trs vocatrice de l'ambigut de la vie motive de Tchakovsky. Le dcor quoique dpouill est terriblement efficace et utilis  son maximum. Les danseurs sont dignes des plus grandes compagnies de ballet. Bravo!!!,1359849600,,341,5.82
8491551,3,B0062YI9ZG,"Magifique, with music taken from Tchaikovsky's ballets, and choreography by Thierry Malandain, is an emotionally complex ballet executed by fine dancers, but it's not something I would prefer to watch.
It tells the vague story of two boys growing up, set to the innocence and silliness of a children's fairytale. The ballet is very-well filmed, probably the best filmed dance-film I've ever seen.
Personally, I found the use of Tchaikovsky's grand music to be in vulgar taste at times, where the music is outright parodied. I would've much rather watched any of Tchaikovsky's ballets in their original form.
There are some interesting choreographic inventions, though they don't seem to allow the plot to continue. The costumes are minimal, though elegant; a pattern of lines accentuating the upper body.
There is an accompanying documentary, which further explains the vague-ness of the ballet. I'd recommend this to a lover of abstract dance, though not necessarily to a lover of ballet.",1333497600,6,989,5.265822784810126
8491552,5,B0062YI9ZG,"First of all, this ballet is not related to any classical story ballet in any significant way. It is basically an ultra modern abstract ballet with a clear reference to the ballets of Tchaikovsky, so, you might call it ""semi-abstract"", as so many abstract ballets actually are. The dancers all wear rather simple leotards and the only other items on the stage are a movable collection of mirrors and portable ballet barres. There are no set interpretations to any part of this ballet, as the choreographer explains in the provided documentary, but we might interpret the mirrors and barres as a focus in some of these scenes on the actual mode of dance, namely, ballet, and not on what is being expressed by the dance. This is also reinforced by a feeling of reaching and striving in these scenes, which reflects a philosophical idea in ballet. For example, a ballet barre is stood up vertically so it becomes a ballet ""pole"" and a dancer climbs up the pole, as if reaching for greater heights. In other scenes, there are clear references to famous moments in Tchaikovsky's ballets. Throughout the entire ballet, there is a comic feeling. It is never long before comic aspects become clear, such as singing along with the music while dancing in one scene. All of these dancers are classically trained, so it should be no surprise that the basic mode of dance here is classical ballet technique, although there is no dancing on pointe, just normal ballet slippers for both the men and women. The camera work is absolutely superb, always showing exactly what we would want, using various angles and elevations. In fact, the camera work is so good, that while watching this, I assumed it was a studio performance, but at the end of the ballet, I was very surprised to see that it was performed on a stage in front of an audience. The choreography is very interesting and lively and it is even at times very classical. There are various groupings, from solos to pas de deux, and larger groupings. As long as you enjoy modern, abstract ballet, you should appreciate this.",1328400000,10,2066,4.741666666666666
