In the early 2000'0 my Dad and Granddad visited Denali National Park!  My Grandad passed away in January 2013!  When my Dad got back from taking my Grandad to Alaska my Dad showed me A slide show of his trip!  Since than I have been wanting to visit Alaska!  The places that I would like to fist in Alaska are Denali National Park, the state capital of Alaska Juno, Nome where the famous sled dog race the Iditarad took place, and Homer!
