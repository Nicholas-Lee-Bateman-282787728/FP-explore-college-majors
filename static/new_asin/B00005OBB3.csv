7948561,3,B00005OBB3,"This is the second in the Ultimate Wrestling Series released by Madacy and showcasing WCCW/USWA/GWF.  Most of this is from 1989-90.
Steve Austin vs. Chris Adams
Adams trained Austin.  Austin stole Adams wife in real life.  Feud ensued.  Pretty good trainer vs. pupil match.  Austin had star written all over him.
Booker T. vs. Action Jackson
Booker T. made his name in Texas before becoming a multiple time Tag Champion for WCW.  Here he gets to showcase his athleticism and some bad habits (stalling chinlock).
Samoan Swat Team vs. Terminator and Masked Avenger
The Samoans are Samu and Fatu (Rikishi when he was just fat as opposed to PHAT).  Terminator and Masked Avenger are probably some jobbers in masks or veterans looking for extra pay.  Match isn't good, but establishes the Samoans as dangerous.
Music Video for the Missing Link.  That's one big forehead.  He looks like The Leader from the Incredible Hulk Comics.
Dazzling Denise vs. Sweet Georgia Brown
Jacqueline before she became anybody.  She also wrestles better here that anytime since.
The Patriot vs. The Cuban Assassin
The Patriot had a cup of coffee in the WWF in 1997 as a rival to evil-Canadian Bret Hart.  Or good Canadian if you're from Canada, eh.  He also tagged in WCW for a while.  I think Cuban Assassin is Fidel Siera, but I'm not sure.  Patriot is jacked here.
Jerry Lawler vs. Terry Funk
This is probably the second best match in the series.  The other also involved Jerry Lawler.  There is actually more wrestling here than the JYD match on the first DVD.  This is almost like an ECW match with Lawler and Funk brawling all over the building before it became popular.  It's really a toss-up between this match and the one with JYD.  This was pretty good even by today's standards.
In the End: Second best DVD in the series.  Get Vol. 1 first.  Then this.
