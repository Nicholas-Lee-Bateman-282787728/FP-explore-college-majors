For example I had my settings,in cinema mode,as picture +13 brightness +9 color -2 tint -2 and sharpness 0 temp - warm. After using Avia II my settings are picture +13 brightness +10 color -3 tint -3 sharpness 0 temp - warm. The sharpness settings had no effect in the old or new version on my set. I am using a Panasonic TH-42PZ77U with a Panasonic DMP-BD10A Blu-ray player. It does speak more on HD technology than the original Avia. If you are new to HD and other setups this disc is the way to go. I had no trouble with any calibration directions.  As for as them showing name brand cables and TV's, maybe these guys help promote the video and does not mean it should be the one to buy.

2998293,3,B000X4NJNS,"First, I must mention how flimsy the DVD case is. On the first day of use, it broke in three areas, just from normal use.

Avia II has an easier menu system than the previous version. It has a clean list of menu options. Clicking on them takes you to sub-menus that appear similarly. It's easy to find what you want.

The instructional videos are new and satisfying, but they do have some issues. Inaccurate information, lacking information, as well as some advertising for rip-off Monster Cables.

I don't remember most of the inaccuracies, but one that did stick in my mind is: HDMI has ""significantly better"" image quality than RGB. I know from personal experience that there is no ""practical"" difference between those two.

The instruction video for setting the White Level is missing information that they mentioned in the previous version of Avia. They didn't mention the purpose of the different shades of white in the whitest step. Someone could easily set the White Level too high and produce incorrect picture.

I'd buy this if I didn't already have the patterns, but be wary of the information on the videos. The problem is: how is someone new to TV calibration supposed make correct decisions with such incompetent videos.",1199404800,9,1234,4.857142857142857

2998297,1,B000X4NJNS,"A complete waste of money.  Instead of purchasing the cheapest one, I picked one with the color strips.

1) The hue test indicates it should be adjusted more to the red even when already a bit too red.
2) The sharpness is best adjusted by sight during programming than with the test patterns on any pattern I've used.
3) After setting color saturation, lowering it enough to better satisfy the red push test proved to be a decent maximum setting, although it should really be a bit lower than that.
4) This test & the THX test both indicate a higher brightness than should be used.  The recommended setting causes a foggy look.

The color strips were great because I could use the blue one with the free THX tests.

In summary, your eyes alone are probably the best choice.  The second best choice would be the free THX test.  The THX test indicates the glasses for the test are available online.",1234569600,,896,4.493827160493828

There are sound tones to make sure your speakers are connected correctly and to set the levels. In addition for audio setting, I would recommend buying a SPL( Sound Pressure Level) meter which measures the loudness of sound in decibels (dBs). Radio Shack makes a very good SPL meter fro $50.
The SPL is more precise than auto-setup because you can very easily adjust teh sound level of every speaker to be exactly equal at the postion listening position or at 1 meter from each speaker.

The video setup is excellent and easy to use for calibrating just about any TV. You do not need any special tools. You need the TV remote and access to the TV setup menu.

I could tell the difference between my original settings and the calibrated settings. Calibrating my surround was just as easy.  Navigating through the disc is a bit difficult.  Some of the HDTV calibration test you need to repeat a couple of times.  I could FF through some of the test but other test I could not FF.

I decided to buy the new one to get the color filters.  After making the corrections, I didn't notice a large change until I switched back and forth.

Not only were we able to perform audio and video calibrations, but we also learned about connecting our surround system properly as well as all our components.  We liked the fact we could go directly to a chapter for viewing as well as select a test pattern or tone with or without the example.  This made it easy to go back and check a particular calibration we had already done.

I see other reviewers did have the filters included, (which sound suspiciously chintzy anyway) so it must be a manufacturer's assembly ""quality control"" problem.

2998307,4,B000X4NJNS,"My sharp aquos looked good as soon as i got it out of the box. About a month later, i decided to take the plunge and purchase this calibration dvd.  After viewing the test patterns and using the color filters, i noticed a significant difference in how much better the color is.  i didn't notice so much of a difference in the other settings as far as sharpness and contrast go.  Even after setting the brightness with the dvd, i ended up bumping it up just a bit for daytime viewing.

I didn't get much out of the audio adjustments on my surround sound system.  i got more out of the adjustments from simply using my receiver manual and remote.

In the end, after seeing other folks LCD tvs, i can tell mine has been adjusted properly with the test patterns.  This was something i didn't notice until i saw someone elses tv and it was obvious the saturation needed to be adjusted.

2998312,1,B000X4NJNS,"UPDATED: In addition to the flaws listed below, the DVD case literally just fell to pieces in my hands. I opened the case to put the DVD in and the hinge on the back of the case split in two, making the case absolutely useless. Prior to the case falling apart, I noticed that the DVD doesn't seem to want to stay securely fastened once inserted in the case. This has all occurred within 48 hours of my receiving this item. All in all, I've decided to return this product as it's not worth the money.

Here's my original review:

I have to say I am disappointed in the quality of the DVD, it's case, and the materials on the disc. I rented the first Avia DVD years ago and it was useful, even without the color filters. The menus in this version are definitely better, in that they are more user friendly and easily accessible. Honestly though, if you own or have access to the original Avia DVD, don't bother purchasing this one.

The tests seem the same as in the first version. The audio tests are exactly the same (the background video used in this version's audio tests is different, though). The video tests seem the same, but the explanations aren't as detailed; you have to listen to one of two actors explaining briefly what the test does, if you don't already know. As another reviewer pointed out, the information for the tests isn't as thorough as it was on the first Avia DVD. The info seems streamlined and edited down.

There is a ""bonus"" materials section, but the features are really weak: some raw footage of a NASA launch (which doesn't use any surround sound, but it looks nice), three Dolby Digital ads -- thankfully in surround sound, and a list of credits.

The legendary Avia color filters are single thin strips of plastic, sandwiched between pieces of tissue paper, all of which is hidden inside the folded 2 page chapter guide located in the front of the case. Avia didn't bother to spend the money to put the filters in a plastic holder or even a cheap cardboard frame, so that all 3 filters(red, green, and blue)  could be handled more easily and would be less likely to be lost or damaged. That is not really on par with paying $40 for this kind of product, in my opinion.

Similar to the experience of another reviewer, my DVD case is damaged and not because of shipping. The clear plastic cover slip is coming unglued from both the front and back panels of the case. This was with normal handling of the case and was present as I carefully unwrapped the protective plastic wrapping from the DVD. What's the point of protecting something that's falling apart? Again, I expect a little bit more from a DVD that I paid $40 for.

Finally, the info presented by the two actors feels rushed; it sounds like it was thrown together to simply fill time and cover all the current buzzwords and, at points, it feels a little condescending. Anyone spending money on a calibration DVD probably understands the basic concept of surround sound, which is exactly the information you're provided -- the sound surrounds you. The dialogue and instructions tend to be monotonous and very ""talking point""-esque, in that they don't sound natural. It's not the way I would try to explain some of the concepts and techniques to a non-technical friend.

Overall, as I said, I'm disappointed with this purchase since it doesn't seem to be an improvement over the original at all.",1199923200,24,3384,4.580165289256199
2998313,2,B000X4NJNS,"The biggest flaw in this DVD is that its instructions do not necessarily match the setup options available on your TV. Terms like color and white level and sharpness and red push are used but not fully explained, so if your TV uses slightly different terms, like tint, you may be left having to guess how to produce the desired changes. Real pros will go right to the service menu, but the rest of us are left fumbling.

I realize that nobody is expecting Oscar-winning thespians in a setup DVD, but these two guys couldn't deliver a line in a UPS truck. Still, the guy with his shirt un-tucked clearly looks the couch potato part and  I get warm feelings of trust when I hear him speak, based on the many hours he obviously spends in front of a wide screen.

On the plus side, even their somewhat hurried cue-card presentations of color and TV technology are nonetheless good enough that you can probably skip the test patterns and follow advice such as turning down the sharpness (which most people adjust way too high) and get a decent picture using your own eyeballs.

But that brings into question the price. I don't feel ripped off, but neither would I quickly recommend spending this amount of money when you can find much of the same info (absent the useful test patterns) online for free.",1199750400,41,1297,4.553648068669528

In the advanced menu the DVD offers a large variety of advanced test patterns which are explained in the PDF found on the DVD.

Personally, when I bought my new 42"" LCD TV, I thought everything looked pretty good.  My friend had the old Avia disc without the color filters.  I decided to buy the new one to get the color filters.  After making the corrections, I didn't notice a large change until I switched back and forth.  Everyone on my TV looked like they had a slight sunburn and I hadn't even noticed.

If you have bought or are considering buying a HDTV, spending $40 on this DVD is a must have as it will optimize your new TV.",1214179200,6,998,4.2994652406417115
3232802,5,B000X4NJNS,"We found this product easy to navigate and the content very helpful in setting up our 73"" DLP display.  Not only were we able to perform audio and video calibrations, but we also learned about connecting our surround system properly as well as all our components.  We liked the fact we could go directly to a chapter for viewing as well as select a test pattern or tone with or without the example.  This made it easy to go back and check a particular calibration we had already done.  My husband enjoyed the advanced section where he could perform detailed calibrations, or do a bit more ""tweaking"" beyond the standard set up.  We would recommend this product to anyone who is setting up a home theater for the first time as well as someone who knows their way around a home theater system.",1213315200,3,791,4.503496503496503

We checked thoroughly in the case and literature several times, as well as the Amazon box, and it is simply missing.

The calibration is the main purpose of purchasing this product, so therefore the video is useless to us.

I see other reviewers did have the filters included, (which sound suspiciously chintzy anyway) so it must be a manufacturer's assembly ""quality control"" problem.

Shabby product, and disappointing that we cannot feel confident that an exchange would give us a complete product.

We hope a return will give us a FULL refund.",1208908800,,605,5.01
3232804,4,B000X4NJNS,"My sharp aquos looked good as soon as i got it out of the box. About a month later, i decided to take the plunge and purchase this calibration dvd.  After viewing the test patterns and using the color filters, i noticed a significant difference in how much better the color is.  i didn't notice so much of a difference in the other settings as far as sharpness and contrast go.  Even after setting the brightness with the dvd, i ended up bumping it up just a bit for daytime viewing.

I didn't get much out of the audio adjustments on my surround sound system.  i got more out of the adjustments from simply using my receiver manual and remote.

In the end, after seeing other folks LCD tvs, i can tell mine has been adjusted properly with the test patterns.  This was something i didn't notice until i saw someone elses tv and it was obvious the saturation needed to be adjusted.

All in all, it was a good investment.  Not quite sure it was worth the $35 or so i paid for it, but my tv looks even that much better now that i have used it.",1204675200,18,1040,4.185929648241206

The explaination of the test paterns was better in the original, in fact, after attempting to use this DVD, I went back to the original to make sure I had not screwed things up too much.

3232809,1,B000X4NJNS,"UPDATED: In addition to the flaws listed below, the DVD case literally just fell to pieces in my hands. I opened the case to put the DVD in and the hinge on the back of the case split in two, making the case absolutely useless. Prior to the case falling apart, I noticed that the DVD doesn't seem to want to stay securely fastened once inserted in the case. This has all occurred within 48 hours of my receiving this item. All in all, I've decided to return this product as it's not worth the money.

Here's my original review:

I have to say I am disappointed in the quality of the DVD, it's case, and the materials on the disc. I rented the first Avia DVD years ago and it was useful, even without the color filters. The menus in this version are definitely better, in that they are more user friendly and easily accessible. Honestly though, if you own or have access to the original Avia DVD, don't bother purchasing this one.

The tests seem the same as in the first version. The audio tests are exactly the same (the background video used in this version's audio tests is different, though). The video tests seem the same, but the explanations aren't as detailed; you have to listen to one of two actors explaining briefly what the test does, if you don't already know. As another reviewer pointed out, the information for the tests isn't as thorough as it was on the first Avia DVD. The info seems streamlined and edited down.

There is a ""bonus"" materials section, but the features are really weak: some raw footage of a NASA launch (which doesn't use any surround sound, but it looks nice), three Dolby Digital ads -- thankfully in surround sound, and a list of credits.

The legendary Avia color filters are single thin strips of plastic, sandwiched between pieces of tissue paper, all of which is hidden inside the folded 2 page chapter guide located in the front of the case. Avia didn't bother to spend the money to put the filters in a plastic holder or even a cheap cardboard frame, so that all 3 filters(red, green, and blue)  could be handled more easily and would be less likely to be lost or damaged. That is not really on par with paying $40 for this kind of product, in my opinion.

Similar to the experience of another reviewer, my DVD case is damaged and not because of shipping. The clear plastic cover slip is coming unglued from both the front and back panels of the case. This was with normal handling of the case and was present as I carefully unwrapped the protective plastic wrapping from the DVD. What's the point of protecting something that's falling apart? Again, I expect a little bit more from a DVD that I paid $40 for.

Finally, the info presented by the two actors feels rushed; it sounds like it was thrown together to simply fill time and cover all the current buzzwords and, at points, it feels a little condescending. Anyone spending money on a calibration DVD probably understands the basic concept of surround sound, which is exactly the information you're provided -- the sound surrounds you. The dialogue and instructions tend to be monotonous and very ""talking point""-esque, in that they don't sound natural. It's not the way I would try to explain some of the concepts and techniques to a non-technical friend.

Overall, as I said, I'm disappointed with this purchase since it doesn't seem to be an improvement over the original at all.",1199923200,24,3384,4.580165289256199
3232810,2,B000X4NJNS,"The biggest flaw in this DVD is that its instructions do not necessarily match the setup options available on your TV. Terms like color and white level and sharpness and red push are used but not fully explained, so if your TV uses slightly different terms, like tint, you may be left having to guess how to produce the desired changes. Real pros will go right to the service menu, but the rest of us are left fumbling.

I realize that nobody is expecting Oscar-winning thespians in a setup DVD, but these two guys couldn't deliver a line in a UPS truck. Still, the guy with his shirt un-tucked clearly looks the couch potato part and  I get warm feelings of trust when I hear him speak, based on the many hours he obviously spends in front of a wide screen.

On the plus side, even their somewhat hurried cue-card presentations of color and TV technology are nonetheless good enough that you can probably skip the test patterns and follow advice such as turning down the sharpness (which most people adjust way too high) and get a decent picture using your own eyeballs.

But that brings into question the price. I don't feel ripped off, but neither would I quickly recommend spending this amount of money when you can find much of the same info (absent the useful test patterns) online for free.",1199750400,41,1297,4.553648068669528

8226903,5,B000X4NJNS,"I bought this product because I knew that any HDTV/Standard TV's I bought would need to be configured. The out of box settings were overly bright and colorful. While they look good at your local store, they are terrible in your living room. Also a non configured TV will use a lot more energy. Anyways, when I decided that it was time to configure, I choose to use a tool rather than eye balling because I wanted to be precise. That's where this product comes in handy. I simply inserted it into my DVD player and the instructions were simple and easy to follow. The actual configuration was very quick and painless. After I was done, I chose to tweek the settings a little with the eyes but that's just a personal choice.

8226904,4,B000X4NJNS,"We recently purchased new a plasma & a new lcd  tv & I wanted to ""calibrate"" the picture.
I went to my DVD rack to look for my old Avia DVD, but couldn't find it.
So off to Amazon I go.
I found this Avia II DVD & decided to give it a shot.
This is MUCH better than the original version.
I watched the tutorials & performed each of the tests & was suprised to find that the results were noticeably better than what I had obtained on my own.
The only adjustment that I thought was a little off after using the disk was the tint.
According to the color strips used for the color & tint adjustment, I had to adjust the tint to +14 on the plasma & + 10 on the lcd.
I thought that this was a little high & after watching both tvs, I did notice a LOT of green.
I adjusted the tint back down to maybe half of what the disc had me adjust.
I can't belive people would pay someone big bucks to come to their homes to calibrate a tv.
Hopefully, I won't lose this one.
All in all, I would reccommend this product to anyone.
After all, you just spent several hundred $$ on a new tv, why not spend $10 a get the best picture out of it as you can.",1297900800,,1131,3.8333333333333335
