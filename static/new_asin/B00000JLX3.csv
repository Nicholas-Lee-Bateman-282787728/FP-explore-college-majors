7912522,5,B00000JLX3,The best film that I have viewed to convey the 'real' message and meaning of the Mowgli Brothers as an introduction to the cub scouts before entering into the whole world of the Jungle Book stories and their meanings as intended by Kipling.  On aspect of this DVD is that it is obviously intended for the US market with 'regions' to be selected.  Could not be played on TV players within Australia.  Required for the video to be copied onto hardrive and then transferred onto another disk allowing it to be played on our recorders.  This of course was carried out at a cost of Aus.  $50 but the whole of  the DVD can now be viewed. Excellent animation by the late Chuck Jones.,1465603200,,676,4.411290322580645
7912523,2,B00000JLX3,The following items that I have purchased was just fine I have not had a chance to read or watch the books or movie but the garage door opener works just perfect.,1397088000,,162,4.09375
7912524,5,B00000JLX3,"There are a few elements that you might not like about this cartoon: Tabaqui looks like a sickly version of the Coyote from ""Road Runner"" cartoons; the music sounds like it was borrowed from  later ""Tom & Jerry"" episodes (such as when they're chasing each other in outer space)--and'okay, this is just me'but Bagheera's ears are too short and he looks like a girl.

Beyond those trifles, however, this is a terrific cartoon, good viewing for kids and adults alike.  Roddy McDowell handles the narration, and the voice work is pretty good, while the story is presented in a gripping, emotionally moving way...in so much as it's a half-hour cartoon, that is.  The art is simple but stylish, typical of Chuck Jones cartoons, though different from what I'd consider the companion piece to this DVD, ""Rikki-Tikki-Tavi.""  It has a moody quality that fits the story, relying on the cleverness of Kipling's writing and Jones's art direction to uplift the story; this gives it a dark yet engrossing quality that is stylish and engaging.  I recommend it wholeheartedly.",1190937600,5,1059,4.954802259887006
7912525,1,B00000JLX3,"This was one of 5 movies I ordered for my grandchildren.  What a disappointment.  The movie is 30 minutes long and not really a movie.  More like ""cliff notes"" version of what the story is.  I guess I missed reading the write up of what this is, I expected a movie for the kids.  Never again",1060473600,,291,4.125
7912526,5,B00000JLX3,"This is a very good adaptation of the Kipling story.  It is told in a strong and vivid way.
My children both like the Disney ""Jungle Book,"" but that didn't prevent them from taking to this at once.  My seven year old boy has watched it nearly every day since getting it.  He even took it to school to have his class watch it.",1043193600,2,325,4.046875
