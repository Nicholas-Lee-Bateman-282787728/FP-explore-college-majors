3417315,5,B0018EGHMC,Pam Stenzel is an amazing presenter with a unique perspective on this subject.  I use this DVD in a college level class on Biblical Human Sexuality and my students respond extremely positively to her teaching.  I highly recommend it!,1340064000,4,233,4.948717948717949
3417316,5,B0018EGHMC,"Every child and adult should see this!! Believer or unbeliever, this is a must see! Amazon, get this on DVD!",1317340800,5,108,4.45
3417317,5,B0018EGHMC,"This DVD is an excellent presentation recorded live of Pam Stenzel addressing a group of teenagers at a school.  Ms. Stenzel talks about sex, boundaries, diseases, pregnancy, health issues, and is clearly in favor of abstinence while explaining consequences of sexual activity outside of marriage.

She is a very direct and effective speaker, and this video can be used at home or in a group setting.  There is a version for secular use and one for use in a church setting, although they are almost identical.  Highly recommended.",1227484800,19,530,4.988636363636363

8269696,5,B0018EGHMC,"Bought this for teaching sex ed as a health teacher.  I like Pam because she's up front about the consequences of premature sexual involvement, but she's also funny and easy to pay attention to.  She is loud, but that's just her personality, and what i think makes her such a captivating speaker. n  Others may think she's too conservative, but I think more teens need to understand that there is more at risk than just pregnancy when you have sex, and that's what Pam tries to convey.",1474502400,,485,4.551724137931035
8269697,1,B0018EGHMC,"It's utterly horrifying that this woman is being allowed to talk to teenagers about sex. Outright lies, exaggerations, fear, shame, blaming the girls, and more are the ""features"" of this ""sex education"". The fact that this not only passes for educational but is still being used by schools across the country should make us weep for the future.",1459987200,6,344,4.948275862068965
8269698,1,B0018EGHMC,"This woman is completely unrealistic! How about teaching our children honest, down-to-earth, caring, and scientific knowledge about human sexuality, morals, and interpersonal relationships? She does NONE of that! Her views are absolutely one-sided and extremely unhealthy! Abstinence is not a bad thing at all, BUT what happens when our children -despite everything- choose to not be abstinent? This woman certainly does not provide any good and solid knowledge of what to safely do IF or WHEN our children decide to have sex! And that, is dangerous! I prefer my child to know everything from human sexuality, to STDs, contraception, interpersonal relationships, plus the good choice of remaining abstinent if possible, AND to know that they can trust to talk to me honestly, no matter what my children decide to do, than for my children ending up doing things behind my back because they believe they are in trouble because they had sex and ending up getting pregnant, STDs just because I am so rigidly fixated on having my children be abstinent! This woman is dangerous and not realistic at all! No thanks to someone like that! No thanks!",1439510400,9,1140,5.069148936170213
8269699,5,B0018EGHMC,"I watched this video today and was sooooo amazed. I wish this would have been around when I was in High School.
Her presentation has such a powerful message mixed in with humor, makes it easy to watch. Even with your kids!",1425340800,,222,4.309523809523809
8269700,5,B0018EGHMC,I wish I would of had something like this when I was a teen. If you can actually get your teen to listen to someone Pam would be it.,1392336000,,132,3.586206896551724
8269701,5,B0018EGHMC,I needed information for a class I'm giving girls at church. Pam lays it on the line and right out there with the truth of God's Word in the 'faith based' version. I highly recommend this for teaching pre teens and teens before they are face with difficult decisions they will live with for the rest of their lives. Now my husband wants to show it to the boys at church too.,1391126400,,374,4.208333333333333
8269702,5,B0018EGHMC,"This DVD must be shown to every parent, and child 12 years old, and older.  Thanks to modern media and lack of family values our society continues to fall in every category.  This DVD is an awakening!  Show it in every Middle and High school.  I now have 3 copies I share in our community.",1372723200,2,289,4.2
8269703,5,B0018EGHMC,On of the best videos that I have seen in the live speaker format.  It would have been better if the kids in the class had some more races represented.,1371340800,,151,4.033333333333333
8269704,5,B0018EGHMC,"Pam has a wonderful and honest view on sexual relationships, and is very straightforward with her words. This is definitely something I'd recommend; highly.",1364256000,5,156,5.541666666666667
