8613197,4,B00F8Z1KTM,This is a 2010 dvd copy. But you can never go wrong with Billy Banks. You are always guaranteed too sweat and his workout will give you that extra kick you need so your workouts don't get boring.,1455753600,,195,4.157894736842105

Packed with creative combos and an upbeat, high energy soundtrack, it has quickly become one of my favorite Taebo routines.  As other commentators have noted, the bands are rather high in resistance and lacking in slack, but I like this! The high resistance adds to the intensity of the workout and makes it more effective in my opinion -- also I admire their stylish red color. I gather Billy purposely had these reduced in length, as several times in the video he tells participants to tighten up on their bands or that their bands are too loose. Overall, great workout and a good bargain!

Thank you Billy Blanks!!",1406246400,3,676,4.769230769230769

8613200,2,B00F8Z1KTM,"For a beginner (trying to get back into a routine after a long time of nothing) this work out was too difficult. It's a great work out routine and the concept is awesome HOWEVER the bands that come in the box are way too short (I'm only 5'3""). I got so pissed off halfway through the workout that I quit. It was so infuriating watching everyone on the video using long bands with slack. How is that suppose to motivate me at home when everyone on the video has it much easier and they're the ones already fit? The only thing I can think of is maybe the bands stretch over time....but I probably won't find that out because it is too difficult to do much with them being too short. Major fail in the final concept, they should be replacing the bands sold in each kit with longer ones.",1391731200,3,783,4.226666666666667
8613201,5,B00F8Z1KTM,This is a great upper body workout!  I did not like the bands so I used the bands that I workout with the pt 24/7 workout and it was awesome!!  The only thing that I wish is that he would have kept those bands/gloves instead of the new ones.  I actually don't even use those bands from his workout...I use bands from balls and bands .com along with tae bo gloves and that is awesome!  I highly recommend if you have those bands or want to invest....it ups your workout a lot.  I love Taebo!,1387843200,2,490,4.11578947368421
8613202,3,B00F8Z1KTM,"The videos were good but the bands were a little too short especially compared to the folks using it on the video. It would be great if you sold the bands separate because over time, they break, and I do not like having to buy the whole set again just for the bands.",1383350400,3,266,4.037735849056604
