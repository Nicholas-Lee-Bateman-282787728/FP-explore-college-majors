I was pleasantly surprised, finished the workout with a nice sweat.  The pace is good and the instructor was energetic and kept me engaged.",1522108800,,273,4.551020408163265
8735735,5,B01675U1B4,I was recently confined to a wheelchair due to surgery.  This tape was very helpful in keeping me active and strong so as to avoid low oxygen counts.  I found the instructor engaging and motivating.,1506124800,,198,4.628571428571429
8735736,5,B01675U1B4,I bought this for a client in a wheelchair. She loves it.,1498003200,,57,3.8333333333333335
8735737,5,B01675U1B4,I was surprised by how great this workout is.  It got my heart rate up unlike a lot of chair aerobic workouts.  I hope he will make more.,1489104000,,137,3.857142857142857
8735738,5,B01675U1B4,"I got this DVD to try after reading other reviews. This is by far the best workout I've ever tried. It was harder than anything I had tried before, but I was able to do it, which surprised me with my muscle challenges. I love how AMAZING I feel afterwards! I felt like the instructor was very encouraging, motivating and talks you through it well. All the exercises really target the muscles I use with my wheelchair. During workouts I feel my tight muscles get looser, and I feel relief from various health challenges. I'm still at the intro workout level. I love the aerobic workout, weight workout and stretching. I have gotten stronger since starting this workout. I love that everyone shown is in wheelchair, with varying muscle abilities like me, real people! I can't say enough how much I love this DVD and that's it's made a big impact on my efforts to get healthier.",1487894400,2,875,4.579617834394904
8735739,5,B01675U1B4,Finally a challenge. I have MS. The DVD provides a great aerobic workout with a phenomenal coach. Inspiring DVD. I recommend for all.,1464739200,2,133,4.826086956521739
8735740,5,B01675U1B4,"I treated myself to a new exercise DVD this week. Those 'Sit and be Fit' don;t really work for me. The slow ones are too slow, and I end up needing to skip sections when they put too much strain on my core (my abdominal muscles are compromised from badly healed surgeries). BUT This new DVD is da bomb. I don;t need to skip ANYTHING!, and the more advanced workouts get my heart going great. The addition of weights is helping build my strength, too. I think this is a great video for people with many conditions, the instructor is careful to show adaptations of movements for people with differing spinal injuries, and his workout team have a variety of physical capabilities which always feels welcoming and inclusive.  I still get a great workout using the recumbent bike (and my good foot) but on days when my abdomen is already stressed (like after my bout of constant coughing last week) I can;t really use it without a lot of pain in my belly. This DVD means I can work out even on my 'bad belly' days.",1463702400,5,1009,4.424731182795699
8735741,5,B01675U1B4,I was shocked at how good this was. I am pretty fit and regularly handcycle but wanted something different to do. This workout video is good and a fun workout. I did not expect it to be so I am pleasantly surprised. Thank you!,1447113600,4,226,4.159090909090909
