8148901,3,B000J3FBES,"Imagine ""Strangers on a Train"" being remade as a cute, lightweight romantic comedy by a co-production team from Spain and Argentina, and you have  ""No dejar que no me quieras"" (aka, ""I Won't Let You Not Love Me"").

Javier (Pere Ponce) has been kicked out of the house by ex-wife, Maria (Viviana Saccone).  As an unofficial part of the settlement, Maria has kept a fortune in loose diamonds.

Enrique (Alberto San Juan) has just been heartlessly dumped by Elisa (Ana Risue'o), his long time girlfriend, who has started a steamy romance with Enrique's best friend.

Let's just say both men are bitter.

Javier and Enrique meet in a Chinese restaurant where they are each having a lonely Christmas Eve dinner.  Over several bottles of sake, the two men commiserate on the failings of their respective mates.  The guys devise a plan to take revenge on Elisa and recover the missing diamonds that Maria is hiding somewhere in the house.  They plan to accomplish these goals by each seducing the other's ex.  Things do not proceed exactly as planned.

This movie is in Spanish.  The Venevision DVD has scene selection.  There is no subtitle option from the main screen and, although the remote lets you select English subtitles, there are none.  (I tried it on two DVD players and a laptop.) It's too bad Venevision hasn't included the subtitles, it would certainly help the movie find a wider audience abroad.

Between the wonderful cast and the many visual gags, even the lack of subtitles probably won't prevent non-Spanish speakers from understanding what is going on here.  As a fan of romantic comedy, I find this one falls into the category of ""pleasant"" - not a chore to sit through, but not worth going out of my way to see.",1244332800,,1727,4.74496644295302
