8415595,3,B003FOCIGW,"INSIDE THE KILLER'S MIND examines the psychology of Serial killers. This 50-minute documentary looks at possible reasons why persons become killers. Dr. Dorothy Lewis, a Professor of Psychiatry at Yale and New York Universities, puts forth the explanation that according to her studies, there is a history of brain injury, mental disease, and child abuse in killers. To test her theories she examines two very interesting cases of Serial killers and will perform both psychiatric examinations and neurological evaluations of these killers.

I highly recommend this DVD to anybody having a huge interest in Criminology, True crime, Serial killers, and Criminal psychology. For people who doesn't know who she is, Dr. Lewis an American psychiatrist specializing in the study of serial killers and people with Dissociative Identity Disorders (DID), formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder. Dr. Lewis has worked with death row inmates as well as other prison inmates convicted for crimes of passion and violence, and was the director of the DID clinic at Bellevue Hospital. She is a very respected and credible researcher, and In this documentary Dr. Lewis examines two cases: Arthur Shawcross and Terrance Wainwright. From 1988 to 1990, Shawcross killed 11 women in upstate New York, earning the nickname ""The Genessee River Killer."" Wainwright is a more obscure killer, but his case is also fascinating and deserves to be known. The show is hosted by Bill Kurtis, and as always he's doing a great job. Overall I think this documentary is very solid.

Here are the reasons for the 3 stars rating: First of all this documentary is way too short. 50 minutes to cover such a complex subject is not long enough, I often felt that the entire thing was rushed and that there wasn't enough information given to us. Secondly this documentary only offers the theories and opinion of Dr. Lewis. I think it would have been great to have the opinions and theories of many researchers, criminologists and/or professors of Psychology-Psychiatry, not just one. Nothing against Dr. Lewis, she is a credible researcher, but most documentaries that I have seen offers the opinions of many people, not just one expert.

This documentary is very interesting and I believe that anybody having a serious passion for Criminology should add this DVD to their library. However if you want something a lot better then I recommend MOST EVIL, the wonderful documentary series featuring the work of forensic psychiatrist Michael Stone, by far the best series ever made about Serial killers and their psychology. :)",1351036800,,2590,5.161904761904762
