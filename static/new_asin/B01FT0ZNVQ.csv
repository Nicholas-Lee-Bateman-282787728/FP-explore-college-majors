7751766,2,B01FT0ZNVQ,"Hi, a slow and somewhat boring presentation of French Intelligence. Kassovitz spends 6 years undercover in Syria. He comes home and falls apart. The boring parts are probably more true to life than what goes for spy movies now a days. I wanted to like this but too slow.",1484006400,4,270,4.530612244897959
7751767,5,B01FT0ZNVQ,"Outstanding script and performances, a convincing portrayal of French spycraft.",1483747200,7,79,7.0
7751768,5,B01FT0ZNVQ,Great French Detective series.  It has you guessing until the end.  The main character is always one step ahead of everyone else.  The actors are superb and so is the writing.  I can't wait to watch Season 2.,1483315200,11,208,4.394736842105263
7751769,5,B01FT0ZNVQ,were the hell is the season season 2 !!,1481241600,,39,3.4444444444444446
7751770,4,B01FT0ZNVQ,"The Bureau: Season One is a French TV political thriller that revolves around the lives of agents of the DGSE, Frances principal external security service, much like Americas CIA. Dispatched to key locations around the world and living under false identities for years at a time, they seek out and identify potential sources of information. These fabricated identities, called legends, must be highly elaborate and totally undetectable. Creating them takes months of work. Maintaining them takes discipline.

The show focuses on the Bureau of Legends within the Directorate General for External Security. French intelligence officer Guillaume Debailly (Mathieu Kassovitz), codename Malotru, returns to Paris after six years undercover in Damascus. At home, he has to face the challenge of reconnecting with his daughter, his ex-wife, and his colleagues. His return to normal life proves difficult, especially when hes told that Nadia, his love interest in Damascus, is now in Paris.

 The Bureau premiered on French television in 2015. In style, it resembles the feature film The Spy Who Came in From the Cold. Those who identify spy movies with James Bond may be disappointed that there are no fancy spy gadgets, spectacular chases, or dazzling credits sequences. The show takes the viewer behind the scenes of the spy business, which requires patience, keeping a low profile, and giving up a good portion of ones private life.

Episodes are in French, with English subtitles. There are no bonus features on the 3-disc unrated widescreen DVD set.",1481068800,6,1547,5.302040816326531
7751771,5,B01FT0ZNVQ,"A superb series, gripping and yet subtle. A pity, though, that the subtitles are in English - it's awfully handy to have French subtitles too, if you're learning or practising your French. Could I request to DVD manufacturers as a general practice that they include the original native-language subs in foreign films as well as adding English subtitles?",1479427200,6,353,5.103448275862069
7751772,5,B01FT0ZNVQ,"Don't even think of watching this until you can see it start to finish.  It's everything The Night Manager wasn't and more but then British spy dramas now seem painfully dated.  But 'The Bureau' was apparently made with the cooperation of the French intelligence service, and a review in Variety observed that the series  ""offers a new way of looking at the intelligence services and the geo-political questions associated to the Arab world, which the French see differently from the Americans or the British.""

So it's much more pertinent to the current world situation, and with characters who are multi-faceted and brilliantly acted.  Altogether riveting.",1466035200,44,658,5.228571428571429

7751775,5,B01FT0ZNVQ,"This is the first of three seasons of this show.  Gripping story, superbly done.",1509321600,,80,4.714285714285714

7751778,5,B01FT0ZNVQ,This is a great look at the way spies might operate. It is extra fun to have it be a French production.,1507507200,,103,3.727272727272727
7751779,5,B01FT0ZNVQ,"What's not to like about this. The story is extremely well constructed and acted and by the end of series the only question is how quickly and from where you buy season 2. Stylish, smart television for grown ups!",1506297600,,212,4.461538461538462
7751780,5,B01FT0ZNVQ,This was a treat.  Really sophisticated and brimming with tension and intrigue. Bravo.,1506124800,2,86,5.615384615384615

7751782,5,B01FT0ZNVQ,"One of the best drama series ever. Well worth the price considering the price of other videos that offer so little.

I have seen all three seasons. It tugs at the mind, heart , soul and the body.",1505606400,,195,4.131578947368421
7751783,5,B01FT0ZNVQ,One of the best TV series I've seen. Keeps you throughly engaged and on the edge of your seat the whole time. Very similar pacing and character developemt to another fantastic TV series (Danish) called The Killing.,1504915200,,214,4.8108108108108105
7751784,5,B01FT0ZNVQ,"Intelligent, well-acted",1504656000,,23,11.0
7751785,5,B01FT0ZNVQ,"If you've never really liked spy movies please don't let that stop you from giving this a try. The Bureau is a superb, one of a kind, international spy thriller. I've never been a fan of James Bond, et al but this is nothing like that. This is the real deal. I also love all the spy technology they use in the show. Loads of character depth and complex storylines. One of the few shows that lets the viewer decide what certain events or character choices means. In other words they don't spoon feed their audience. ps: There are much better descriptions for this show than I could ever write so please keep perusing the comment section and be sure to check out season 2 and 3 that are just as good as the first season!",1504483200,5,718,4.286764705882353
7751786,4,B01FT0ZNVQ,"""Bureau"" is the French word for ""office"".  Those expecting a faithful remake of the hit British and American sitcoms of _The Office_ may initially be confused, as this French version takes the premise of those shows in a completely new direction.  But stick with it;  once you tune into the Gallic sense of humor, it's every bit as funny as its Anglo-Saxon versions.",1504310400,,366,4.777777777777778
7751787,5,B01FT0ZNVQ,"If Peaky Blinders and Boardwalk Empire are my favorite crime series, THIS is ESPIONAGE in excelsis. Gripping, gritty, plausible and intelligent, NOT to mention ROMANTIC,: the characters wrestle with their own morality a la Graham Greene, the authenticity is worthy of John Le Carre.",1504224000,,282,5.431818181818182

7751791,5,B01FT0ZNVQ,This is the best spy story ever.  Not 007.  Realistic.  Also purchased series 2 and hoping for a series 3 to be released soon,1500249600,2,125,4.125
7751792,5,B01FT0ZNVQ,Best series ever!!!!!!!!!,1498262400,,25,7.666666666666667
7751793,5,B01FT0ZNVQ,This is the most realistic spy tv-show ever. It keeps surprising you and the writing is just brilliant. It's sadly underappreciated in the U.S. (too many people are used to unrealistic james bond-style spy shows).,1497571200,6,213,5.114285714285714
7751794,2,B01FT0ZNVQ,switched it off,1497398400,,15,4.333333333333333
7751795,4,B01FT0ZNVQ,"I like this series quite a bit. I have to say though, I'm a bit surprised they have the gall to include the Atlanta Olympic  bombing and talk about Richard Jewell the way they do. He might not have been perfect but the FBI and the media destroyed an innocent man's life. He deserved every penny of what he later won in lawsuits. Really? They are still making out like everything they did to him was his own fault? They really screwed up on that one and they should admit it, not say well, ""we never really accused him. We were just doing our job. "" He was doing his job and look how he was treated. Shameful how they don't admit that in this episode.",1497052800,7,650,4.158730158730159
7751796,2,B01FT0ZNVQ,This just didn't make any sense to me.  The lead actor is unremarkable and too many references that make sense only to the French.,1496793600,,130,4.416666666666667
7751797,4,B01FT0ZNVQ,Great acting with loads of suspense. Caution! please pay attention to this program. No getting up and going to the bathroom and returning with and bowl of popcorn and expect to be able to follow through. Now have to buy season two..,1491177600,5,232,4.5476190476190474

8761472,1,B01FT0ZNVQ,"thus might be great if you speak French  The English sub titles are sparse,do not keep up with the action and make the whole experience incomprehensible  Ive seen other foreign shows where the subtitles were well done and made the viewing a pleasure  this was bad",1519084800,,263,4.673913043478261

8761477,5,B01FT0ZNVQ,"Yes, the serial has the subtitles, and yes, it's low-budget, but it maintains a relatively fast pace. Through the twists and turns of the plot, the series kept me interested. I'm generally not a fan of the French movies of the past, where somebody is riding the train and stares out the window for five minutes straight. None of that here. Looking forward to Season 2!",1511568000,,368,4.590909090909091
