8561903,4,B00B2ZE90E,"The Monk (French: Le moine) is an ironic example of ""What To Do"" and ""What Not To Do"" to seduce a nymphet. Counterintuitively, the piety of a monk is extremely attractive to a nymphet. For example, in Mickey Royal's The Pimp Game, he relates, extremely counterintuitively, that for one to be a pimp he must give up desires of the flesh i.e. materialism, lust, etc. (More on this fascinating point in an upcoming post and soon to be book.)

The monk (Vincent Cassel) is very religious. He initially rejects the advances of a nymphet who sneaks into the monastery to seduce him; however, after she drugs him and takes his virginity, his inhibitions are released and he aggressively pursues the nymphet in the screenshot below. Unsurprisingly, she rejects his advances, and unfortunately he makes the ULTIMATE sacrifice to ""be with her"".

The take aways from this film is that neediness is unattractive. (Royal even advises that one should not approach the opposite sex, but be ""open"" (i.e. have no desires of the flesh) and let nymphets come to you.) And, believe it or not, piety (i.e. having the self-control/self-discipline to avoid the immoral aspects of life) is attractive. Lastly, having a monk-like beard isn't a bad idea.
