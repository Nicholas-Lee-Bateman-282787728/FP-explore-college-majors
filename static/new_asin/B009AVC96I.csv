5311343,3,B009AVC96I,I really love Billy Blanks Jr's other DVD's. This one is pretty good as well but it is lacking. I wish there was more dancing. There are only two dance routines. The rest are basic cardio moves. I was able to keep up with everything so it is not hard if you are not a beginner. I do find Billy and his wife to be very engaging and motivating. They make me want to keep going.,1359417600,15,375,3.9473684210526314
5311344,2,B009AVC96I,"I'm a big fan of Billy Blank's Taebo workouts, and was intrigued when I learned that his son has his own line of dance workout dvds. Unfortunately I found this dvd to be lacking in intensity. My friend and I didn't even break a sweat. Of course, that could be because we are used to the higher intensity workouts of Billy Blanks Sr, and Jillian Michaels. The dance moves seemed awkward to me as well. So, skip this one if you're looking for an intense workout. If you're just starting a workout routine however, this might be okay.",1357171200,12,531,4.428571428571429
5311345,4,B009AVC96I,"Thankfully I did this one after the Step Up Dance Workout video because I was feeling bad about myself.  As far as dance videos go I was completely able to keep up with this one. The moves while not complicated definitely get you moving and smiling. I am extremely uncoordinated and have difficulty picking up dance routines but could keep up with Bill Blanks Jr and the gang. So, if you can pick up basic moves you may feel that you need something more complicated than this. As for me, I could keep up but the moves weren't very fluid. However, this is probably the first dance workout DVD, I have been able to do. Most are usually way to complicated but the movements are slow and Billy's smile and laugh is contagious.",1354665600,34,722,4.428571428571429

I like the simple combos, the quick changes to something else and Billy Blanks smile is just contagious. Music is fun, too. Overall, I'd say it's more of a beginner tape as the breathing hard and sweating heavy just didn't happen for me.",1423958400,,335,4.333333333333333
5311358,5,B009AVC96I,"Really fun, high energy.  I have never really enjoyed dance DVD's because of poor cueing.  These folks do a great job, fun, pretty good workout actually, and so enjoyable.  I do the Bob Harper and Gilad DVDs when I want a more intense days exercising indoors.  But there are days you want to exercise but maybe NOT as intensely as a 40 minute step tape with 10 minutes of warm-up and you want both great exercise and PURE fun.  These tapes will give you that, I believe.  I'm an exercise enthusiast, exercise indoors or outdoors every day and this is my most fun indoor exercise DVD.",1419897600,,583,4.452830188679245

5311365,5,B009AVC96I,I loved this workout video. My favorite part is when his wife takes over and does some fast cardio. She was so funny! I found myself smiling through a very vigorous workout. Aftrr i was done i felt really good. Like i accomplished a lot. I woild definitely recommend this video,1412121600,,277,4.450980392156863
5311366,2,B009AVC96I,"Resolution was horrible, so bad it was difficult to see positioning. He also goes wayyyyy too fast to be able to see the moves appropriately and doesn't explain anything. I would have to watch this 4-5 times to be able to get the moves and positioning down before I would actually benefit from this workout.

5311370,4,B009AVC96I,"This was a fun workout.  They go through the moves slow enough that a beginner can copy/learn.  They also have modifications on some moves. Out of 30 minutes, I had 19 minutes of vigorous exercise.  It would have been more if I did all the advanced moves.  My only issue is the special names given to simple steps.  I don't remember the name he gave, but the move was really a grapevine with a turn.  I WILL be doing this exercise again in the future.",1410393600,,451,4.247058823529412

5311377,5,B009AVC96I,"I was looking for something fun to do at home on nights that I can't make it to the gym, and I thought this was a good find! It's not the most intense workout I've ever done, but it did get me sweating and my heart rate was up. It starts out a little on the easy side, but then Billy's wife steps in for a little cardio session that's more intense. That's followed by a second, faster-paced dance routine. I thought all of the dance moves were fun and easy to follow. And BB and his wife are both really motivational and uplifting! They really do make it fun. As cheesy as it sounds, I was smiling and laughing during the workout. I will be doing this again, for sure!! Some reviews complained that this wasn't a hard enough workout, but different people need different levels. So if you're looking for something super hardcore, then no, this prob isn't for you. But anyone looking for a beginner or intermediate level workout will enjoy this. He does give plenty of low impact alternatives for people who might have an injury, or anyone who just isn't ready for high-impact movements.",1409097600,,1085,4.457286432160804

5311383,1,B009AVC96I,"This was the worst workout video that I have ever done. The music doesn't match the workout so you will easily bore (think dance workout to classical music)....the moves are simple enough for most to complete and still do an additional workout that day....I understand wanting your spouse to participate in your workout but sweet baby Jesus why, that lady was more distracting and annoying than the workout...if you were thinking let me try this its Billy Blanks son, just pass on this he is nothing like his father when it comes to a workout",1408233600,9,542,4.71578947368421

In my space/ apartment- I could follow Billy and when it seemed physically hard for me, my age I modified the steps or I made up my own following along with these routines.  Billy shows supplemental easy steps!  The cool down is always important and this one works.  I will come back to this video often and try his others videos.  Don't be scared off by the term Boot Camp, it's not that difficult.  If you want Boot Camp I'm sure you'll find them.  The is definitely a good starter, if you want to get back into any routine.

His idea of making dancing a workout wasn't new, but it was fresh and looked like fun.  I didn't think much more about it until I gained a few pounds over the holidays.  I finally decided I needed to do something and saw one of his commercials on TV.  So I bought his ""...Boot Camp"" DVD.

There is a bit that's a swing routine that seems quite slow, but I thought I love swing maybe I can try this out.  Then later in the tape they are doing these really fast jumping jack type things, with no low impact option.  The lower option is still a jumping jack.  That track was also not really dancing, more like standard gym exercises.  So I'm confused who this dvd is supposed to be for.  Whoever it's for, it's not me.",1396224000,,508,4.185567010309279

No. Did I get my heart rate up and add some variety to my workouts? Yes. It's starts slow but once his wife hits the cardio part it gets higher intensity.

Dance moves are boring and all over the place. Music is boring. I do Zumba (in person and dvds) so I can follow instructions. But these moves made no sense, didn't follow the rythym, and I just didn't like it. Plus it just seems like a lot of jumping around...
 I barely started sweating with this work out. With about ten minutes left I started doing squats and burpees. Yes burpees on my own! So clearly did not keep my interest and didn't make me feel like I was doing any ""work""

5311421,4,B009AVC96I,"I found this workout fun and pretty easy to follow.  Since it only takes about 30 minutes plus a little time for the cool down, it fits with my busy schedule.",1393113600,,158,4.096774193548387
5311422,5,B009AVC96I,I liked that I could dance and not feel like I was working out.  I was able to modify the workout to my fitness level.,1392768000,,118,3.72

5311424,5,B009AVC96I,"Love it.  Fun 30 minutes of cardio with plenty of variety.  Some Dance videos try to incorporate too many moves, this one is just right and one I can enjoy many times over.",1392336000,,172,4.181818181818182
5311425,4,B009AVC96I,"A good workout and interesting to learn the dancing footwork.  I don't have the moves of Billy Blanks, but it is fun to do the workout.  Well designed also with a warm up and cool down section before and after the 30 minutes of cardio.  It is fun and a real workout.",1392336000,,266,4.076923076923077
5311426,3,B009AVC96I,"I have two of Billy's dance DVDs, and this one is good but the other two are better (Cardio Dance and Hip-Hop dance).  I read some reviews that said this wasn't intense enough.  It starts out relatively slow but it does get to moderate intensity.  This is not on the same level as Insanity or P90x.  It is a standard dance DVD, but I can't say I recall any steps in here being ones you're going to take to your local dance club and wow anyone.  But, if you are a PRIME member, you have nothing to lose because you can stream it for free (as of this review's publication date).",1392249600,2,576,4.153153153153153
5311427,2,B009AVC96I,"This is not a dance party, it is a cardio party.  I was looking forward to dancing but the whole middle section of the DVD is cardio with no dance.  Also the dance steps he does introduce are old fashioned for such a young looking couple.  Good workout but I will not do it again.  I would rather do Hip Hop Abs.",1392163200,,312,3.9838709677419355

5311429,3,B009AVC96I,"It starts out with modern fun dancing, then it gets in to some weird bollywood, and then it gets into praise dancing. All the music is awful too.
But you will get a work out, and it's sweet to see Bily Jr. and his wife working together happily.",1391904000,,244,4.104166666666667

5311431,5,B009AVC96I,"I am new to exercising, but like to dance, so I found this fun.  I like the way Billy gave alternate moves for people like me who are out of shape.  Hey, we have to start somewhere.  No, I couldn't keep up with him, but it was fun enough that in time I hope I will.",1391817600,,265,3.6964285714285716

5311435,4,B009AVC96I,"I bought this thinking it would feature more dance routines with maybe some boot camp intervals in between them.  What I got was a 37 minute old school high impact aerobics workout.  Break down is 3 minute warm-2up, 29 minutes non-stop cardio and five minute cool down.  I would definitely put intensity at Intermediate.  This will appeal to fans of 80's style hi-lo aerobics without the bad music and clothes Billy cues well and has the biggest smile I think I have ever seen on someone jumping up and down so much.  To give something to compare this to I would put intensity and style around that of Turbo Jam.

I will update once I do the workout with heart rate monitor.",1391299200,4,674,4.483606557377049

5311439,5,B009AVC96I,"I chose this topic because used to workout to Billy Blanks Sr's  CDs.  I liked it because it was easy to follow, fun and Billy is simply a motivator.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get a moderate workout in, who likes a little choreography that is not to difficult to follow and can, without exhausting themselves, do cardio for 30 minutes or more.",1391040000,,364,4.402985074626866
5311440,3,B009AVC96I,Very few dance moves in this workout. Starts out with a few dance steps but then turns into a traditional aerobic workout. Definitely not a dance party. It is ok for a regular workout.,1390953600,,184,4.4411764705882355
5311441,1,B009AVC96I,Stream kept getting interrupted and buffering. It was really not conducive to a workout. I thought it was nice to have the option to work out from home.,1390780800,,152,4.464285714285714

5311446,5,B009AVC96I,"I just started an exercise plan again this year and trying to stick to it and have it fit into my busy life.
Problem is I get bored easily. This was a great workout to add into the mix. Billy and his wife are fun and energetic and there is a short burst of hi intensity cardio, but everything else is really low key. Fun doing these dance moves and low stress. You can break a sweat if you really add the bounces in. Definitely not for hard core Billy Blanks, Sr. workout people. This is not Tae-bo. But I liked it because I did not feel like dying afterwards and yet still feel like I worked out and I'm energized!",1389916800,,615,4.090909090909091

5311448,5,B009AVC96I,"I enjoy this workout video since it does get my heart rate up which other videos don't tend to do. It has 2 dances that it teaches you and in the middle is a cardio portion. For me, it gives just the right amount of warm up, gets me working really hard, then dropping the intensity a bit for the last dance. Plus, it's only 30 minutes, which easily fits into my day.",1389657600,,366,4.027397260273973
5311449,5,B009AVC96I,I like this instructional workout. No too long on the instructions. And it was pretty easy to follow with modifications if needed. Each step leads to the next and builds to a routine dance work out. It really was a lot of fun!,1389398400,,226,4.27906976744186
5311450,4,B009AVC96I,"I really enjoyed the enthusiasm and fun that Billy Blanks Jr puts into exercise.  It seems that the negative reviewers are expecting Billy Blanks Jr to be like his father, but he is not.  He has his own fun, unique style.  If you enjoy dance type exercise, this will be a routine you can have fun with.  It is not as intense as his father's taebo, but I think it is a lot more fun.  I loved the ""allelujah"" routine at the end!  I feel like I got a good work out, and had fun doing it.",1389052800,,484,3.9381443298969074

5311452,3,B009AVC96I,"I would know, I'm a beginner. I walk, job, or spin most days of the week, but I've never done a dance video, and this was too much for me. I don't know how anyone could call it such. Even Billy Banks had sweat covering most of his front. Maybe it's not Insanity, but it's not beginner level either.

I would rename this ""bouncy-running video"" if I could, because that's what 90% of it was. I'm not really sure how this appeals to the people who need this intensity level. They had a few modifications in the beginning for if you had bad knees, but then they gave up. They never should have tried. If you have bad knees, there's no way you could do this.

I'm going to hope that somewhere out there is a dance exercise video that isn't about jumping jacks...",1388102400,,757,4.25
5311453,3,B009AVC96I,They make exercise interesting and fun but this is not for a beginner. It is very fast paced and do not give instructions in slow motion. I would love to see one that is truly for beginners.,1387238400,,190,4.162162162162162

I've done a LOT of aerobics videos over the years, but had to take some time off due to health issues and am just getting started with a more strenuous workout routine, so you might say that I'm an experienced beginner.  The routines were simple and repetitive, but I liked the flow and it was easy to follow and not get lost.  I had no problem following through the whole video.  Also, I found the moves easy to modify for a lower-impact routine, so points for that.  The instructors felt ""real"", not too peppy or annoying, but I still felt motivated.  Not the most exciting background music ever, but once I know the routines well enough, I'll probably dub in some of my own.  I'm happy I found this, and will probably be doing it a lot now.",1385337600,,884,4.353658536585366

I do wish it was longer, however; I'm an intermediate/advanced exerciser and would have enjoyed a workout of this caliber that was 45-60 minutes long. It is part dance moves and part cardio.
