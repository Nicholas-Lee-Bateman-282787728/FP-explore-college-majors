The US President is addressing an audience at a plaza in Spain. There are shots, the President is hit! There is confusion among the crowd. Then a bomb explodes! The Chief Secret Service agent say a flash from a window as it happened. A Spanish bodyguard is arrested; what does he know? There is a chase through crowded streets, the man gets away. [Scenes are repeated to pad out the story. What did you see?] Was this recorded on a video phone? The photographer joins the chase after that bodyguard. That young girl is rescued. [This adds drama to the story.]

We learn about the use of a double. There is a rogue agent involved! Terrorists are seeking revenge for an earlier attack. The President is tired of hiding. There is a car chase on the streets and sidewalks of this city. Then a crash! Wheres my brother? Where is POTUS? That ambulance has an accident and overturns. Ive got you. Thomas Barnes calls for help. The police arrive to secure the scene. President Ashton has survived! The assassins were eliminated. You wonder who was behind this.

This could have been a better movie with a better script. Those numerous repetitive scenes only pad out the story. Watch The Parallax View for the best example of a story about intrigue and suspense based on historical events. The US Secret Service began Presidential Protection after McKinley was shot, since then no President was ever lost to an assassins pistol.",1458604800,,1445,4.726190476190476
