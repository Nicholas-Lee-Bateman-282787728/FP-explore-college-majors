8701688,5,B00TGNM1UO,"This Bluray disc presents for home video a 53-minute documentary about ""the first woman of the classical guitar"" which was produced for American Public Television (not PBS) in 2014 that aired on regional public TV stations. The BD (and DVD) add a few bonus features and was probably offered as a ""pledge premium"" when it aired on TV.

Much of Isbin's story is told in her own words - though what appears to be a lengthy single interview. There are also comments from modern classical composers ( John Corigliano, Tan Dun, Joan Tower) as well musician/composers from the folk (Mark O'Connor), jazz (Stangley Clarke) and rock fields (Steve Vai).  The story of her career (from childhood till the current day) is told chronologically and includes excerpts from performances. More time is spent on the years before 2000 but there are some recent events included.

Near the beginning there is a brief comment from the late pop singer Lesley Gore (who is only identified by name) as well as from singer/songwriter Janis Ian. I wondered why these two women were here. About 40 minutes into the documentary  Isbin talks about her ""coming out"" as an openly gay woman and, suddenly the reasons for the inclusion of Gore and Ian made some sort of sense. Personally, I felt the need to discuss Isbin's sexual orientation were unnecessary. This certainly did not have any basis for her talent. (And, honestly, how much classical guitar music do you think Lesley Gore listened to?).

As I noted, only excerpts of Isbin compositions are included in the core program. The bonus features include five complete performances that were shown as excerpts as well as three additional interviews (film composer Howard Shore, conductor Leonard Slatkin and one more.) The performances total about 22 minutes and the interviews total eight minutes).

For those interested in knowing more about this talented woman who, not only created the Guitar Study Program at Julliard, but still heads it, this is a well photographed and compiled film. Another fine release from VAI Video.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
