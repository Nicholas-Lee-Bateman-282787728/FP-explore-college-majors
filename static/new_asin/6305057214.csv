957704,5,6305057214,"I have owned this recording (first in VHS which we wore out, now in DVD) for many years. It is the only one of its kind that we all can do without giving up in frustration. I own many others, but have learned that when the routine starts out with the instructor in Lotus position, you might as well give up. And even though Susan Winter Ward is pictured in the Lotus position, there's none of that on the actual video. Her instructions are clear and motivating, her participants are real people who despite their age put my 29-year-old daughter to shame, and the routine is easily adapted to your individual level but still very effective. Never once do you feel like you might as well give up because you'll never get there. This is truly the very best for 'the rest of us'. If you are the typical office dweller and are trying to increase your flexibility and learn to deal with the stresses of daily life, buy this video no matter what your age!!",1167782400,4,949,4.3977272727272725
957705,5,6305057214,"This is one of the best yoga videos I've ever used.  I originally bought this for my 85 year old mother (I'm 45) and liked it so well I got one for myself.  It's a nice, slow, relaxing session that targets virtually every part of the body with nice easy stretching.  I would also recommend Kripalu Yoga Dynamic by Stephen Cope.  Young at Heart is a much shorter session which is nice when there's not a lot of time.  The Kripalu tape is a much longer - about 90 minutes.",1054080000,15,470,4.177777777777778
957706,5,6305057214,"I'm new at this and I find this video ""do-able"".  I am not flexibility at all but I hope to improve in time.  This video gets you breathing and moving, and I find myself looking forward to this 45 minute  workout.  It doesn't ask you to do anything crazy.  You'll feel better.",949017600,29,276,4.230769230769231

957772,5,6305057214,"I love it. Starting Yoga in your mid-sixties can be daunting. It made me realize just how out of shape I have become. The poses were mostly doable for me from the start, with modifications. Ms. Ward tells you often to only do what you can comfortably do: ""Find your edge"" Paraphrasing here - If you can only touch your knees/shins/...., then that is the pose for you today.  What she doesn't tell you are what other types of modifications you can make. I use blocks and a rolled up towel for certain poses. There is an abundance of information on the internet to help you learn the poses and modifications. This video is a great start for those of us who are new to Yoga.",1426809600,,671,4.325396825396825

957774,2,6305057214,"There is absolutely nothing basic about this tape.  The instructor is clearly a professional and the people in the class must have years of practice (they've had all their ligaments removed.) I think this would be appropriate for someone wanting to learn how to TEACH yoga.  Additionally there are no suggestions on how to make the exercises easier to do if you are a beginner.  The teacher is an absolute pro and I love watching her, but  a beginner attempting to do these routines would be the equivalent of going from chopsticks to Chopin' etudes with viruallly no instructions.  This was a gift and I was flattered that someone actually thought I could do anything with this tape :)",1425513600,,686,4.73109243697479

Ms. Ward offers no alternative poses nor does she demonstrate the use of any aids such as blocks, blankets or bands. There are 4 people in the ""class"" and all four of them are able to do the poses just as Ms. Ward does them.  Really?? You couldn't have one of the people showing alternative poses?",1398211200,4,404,4.113924050632911
957777,4,6305057214,This CD is just right for a beginner yoga class with 50yrs. on up people. I attended a class using this particular one and now can use it on my own when class not in session.,1397347200,,174,3.861111111111111
957778,5,6305057214,"I have ordered 3 videos and 4 DVDS of Susan Winter Ward's Yoga lessons.  It is marvelous.  Our small group of 3 to 5 have done this for almost three years and feel so much better for using it!  The stretching, breathing, and relaxation parts are excellent for our ages (between 60 & 85).  One never tires of Susan Winter Ward's voice and loves the continuous reminder to breathe deeply.  Since we are trying to keep our bodies limber and flexible, we don't take each step automatically.  We practice to strengthen ourselves every time.  We do the lesson three times a week.  I have given the videos and extra DVDs as gifts because I feel so strongly that she has prepared the best yoga tape for seniors.",1388448000,,703,4.480314960629921

957800,5,6305057214,"Very appropriate yoga workout for us seniors.  The instructor is pleasant and the actual routine she puts you through is very doable for us older types.  I've tried some others in the past and found myself just watching most of it as I couldn't get into the positions, etc., that the instructor was showing.  I actually feel good after this routine!

957805,3,6305057214,"I felt this tape was a little difficult for a senior.

957806,5,6305057214,Over the last few years I have found myself loosing my physical flexibility - and also not sleeping as well as I did when I was younger. The exercises in this video are helping to solve both problems. Most people are capable of performing the exercises in the video- some are pretty easy - some you have to work into over time as your body begins to respond to the stretching of your muscles. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their health - there is nothing more healing and restorative than a wonderful night's sleep. Perform the exercises in the evening before retiring - you will be so relaxed I can almost guarantee you will sleep well that night!,1352332800,3,671,4.463414634146342
957807,5,6305057214,"I am 72 years old and have been using this CD for 9 months. I am amazed at how effective it has been. As an older person, I was having balance and stiffness issues. This program has literaly taken years off my life. I do it once a week because my work schedule doesn't give me more time. I am not into the meditaition etc part, I just use it for the strechting and it works. I bought a back-up cd just in case something happens with the original. I put this program om my ""things I must do list"" along with my regular walk/weight program.",1347580800,4,538,4.084905660377358

957840,5,6305057214,"As a formerly very active and strong adult, I found that with retirement and a move from a 3 story to a single level house,  came a decrease in physical activity and flexibility.  I have had surgery on one knee and other yoga videos and classes I've tried seemed to stress this joint way too much (no balancing on one leg on this DVD).  This video is great for newbies.  I do find the instructor's voice a bit too 'new agey' which is irritating and I wish that the camera would focus more on the instructor with each new pose instead of one of the 4 students.  Overall, I found the poses simple to do and there has been no stress on my knee.  I like that you are not expected to hold any given pose for too long.  This program has been easy to figure into my day's activities.  Once my flexibility improves I plan to move on to slightly more challenging videos. I'm 65 and of normal weight.  Hoping that yoga will slow my shrinking height!",1294704000,13,939,4.230337078651686

957842,5,6305057214,"Since I am both a beginner and a senior, I feel that this video is excellent for either or both.  This 50 minute DVD covers many movements in slow and easy motions.

I thoroughly enjoy doing this and will use it every day.",1282435200,11,343,4.5
957843,5,6305057214,susan is great.  this is geared for the older non flexable person who is starrting out in yoga.  n after a couple of weeks YOU WILL SEE A DIFFERANCE.  # 2 and # 3 are a little more advanced but well worth it.  you feel better and it will help the aches and pains that us older people get.  even handi capped people can use this series.  it helps strengthen the muscles and most of all gives better balance,1271376000,11,405,4.063291139240507
