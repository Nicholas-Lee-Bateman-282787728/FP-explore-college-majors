Truly a work of art. I love how the story ties in at the end, just plain refreshing.",1284940800,,246,4.613636363636363
8402743,4,B003R0G4MI,"A film loosely based on Shakespeare's 'Othello' but don't worry there isn't any confusing Shakespearean talk.  This film has a real feeling to it, the actors play their roles well, and in the end you are truly moved by the storyline.",1283212800,2,233,4.682926829268292
8402744,5,B003R0G4MI,"I have loved, since college, going to see independent films with low budgets where you have young film makers with tons of energy just trying to tell a story and keeping it real and down to earth.  Desdemona is exactly what you think it's goiing to be...a tragic love story.  The story moves along with pauses only where absolutly needed to allow the viewer to reflect and understand.  There are surprises, compelling drama, and characters grounded in reality.  The title character is facinating to watch and I wish she had more screen time to develope her character's tragic story.

Someone needs to get behind this team and help them make some more movies. It was so refreshing to watch a movie without tons of effects.  You follow the story, your moved by the situations, and you are reminded that film is an art.  I loved it.",1280966400,,829,4.636986301369863
