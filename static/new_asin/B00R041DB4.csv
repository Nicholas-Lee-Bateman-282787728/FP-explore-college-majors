6894860,4,B00R041DB4,"Thank you Bender/Helper/Impact for sending us this movie to review!

When I was growing up, I used to watch a show called The Hitchhiker which featured a hitchhiker (gasp!) who opened and closed each show, but did not star in the random thriller story in between.  The shows often revolved upon mankind's depravity and sometimes had supernatural plots.  Since I have not seen the original WWJD movie, The Hitchhiker television show is the closest comparison I can make.

WWJD: The Journey Continues has the same drifter from the original movie, but the main story is completely different this time around.  The movie begins with the drifter catching a ride to a random location.  Meanwhile a young man promises his mother in her final moments that he would take care of his brother.  His adopted brother's prison sentence is nearly finished. Later that night, a church in the midst of being renovated in a rough neighborhood gets robbed.  The pastor, fearing for the lives of himself and his wife, abandons the church and  suggests they hire a pastor with no family to worry about.  Cue in the young man who happens to be a pastor and his parolee brother.  As luck would have it, the pastor's brother is  a carpenter when he's not breaking the law.

The pastor's brother is not saved and it shows with his quick temper and wanting to pick fights with some trouble-making brothers who vandalize the church. The young pastor has a tight deadline to get the church up and running and financially stable.  Everything is on track until there is a robbery in the church and the pastor's brother pays the ultimate price.  Fortunately, he accepted Christ in his last moments of life.

The pastor grows bitter and the townspeople take notice.  How can he bring people to the Lord when his faith is shattered?  The drifter comes to town and doesn't get a warm welcome and finds himself chased off by the pastor and the trouble making boys.  He keeps coming back and asking people ""What would Jesus do?""  Some townspeople get the message while others take a little more time.

Besides the main message of trusting God, there are many instances of forgiveness. The movie also takes some time to discourage premarital sex.  While WWJD: The Journey Continues is not rated, I would recommend it for teens and older because of the violence and mature themes.  The story is predictable at times but decent.  If you like heartwarming Christian movies, WWJD: The Journey Continues has you covered.",1428364800,13,2478,4.790094339622642
6894861,5,B00R041DB4,"A wonderful heartfelt movie! We truly enjoyed watching it!

6894903,4,B00R041DB4,"Love the story line, but this first movie within this series is a bit lacking on some of the actors.  But each movie gets better and better.  I really wish the larger studios would pick up on the ""thirst"" within this country for good, quality, Christian based movies.  But of course Jesus doesn't ""sell"", sex and senseless violence does.  If you like these types of movies, and can live with novice actors, then by all means buy the whole series.  But if quality is your main concern I'd probably skip this first one and buy the next two.  Of course John Schneider does a wonderful job.  And if you like John in this series I'd suggest you check out ""Joshua"" if it's still available.  Another wonderful movie.  The video quality is good, but not great as compared to the movies of recent release.  Again, it has a very good storyline.",1515456000,,834,4.5

6895116,1,B00R041DB4,"I thought the first movie was bad, but this one was beyond disappointing. It feels like a churned-out retread of the the first WWJD and WWJD 2: The Woodcarver, but with nowhere near the same amount of care and effort.  Pastor losing his faith after a family member tragically dies (1st movie)? Check.  Troubled teen(s) helping to rebuild a church (2nd movie)? Check.  John Schneider as the needlessly-mysterious ""drifter"" with near-psychic clairvoyance of the characters' ""struggles""? (1st movie). Huge check (which is probably what they had to give him to come back for this.)

The writing and acting were a mess. It felt like they shot the first draft, and the acting and character motivations fell so flat.  As someone who loves and has been tremendously impacted by Charles Sheldon's original novel, this movie felt like a slap in the face to the author's intent and legacy, completely missing the point of the original book: serving the community OUTSIDE the four walls of the church as Jesus would.
Please, ignore the other ratings of this film. Skip this movie and go read the book.",1444003200,,1089,4.896739130434782

The message is good, but the screen play did not seem to give the cast a lot to work with. Felt like the role for both pastors was pitifully shallow and weak. Yeah nobody is perfect, but these guys played pastors who had no business in ministry. All in all a good theme wrapped in an ok package.",1437955200,2,449,4.232558139534884

The only thing about the third one is that it repeats the problems a pastor has with his doubt even using some of the same dialog. However the story is completely different and very inspiring.
