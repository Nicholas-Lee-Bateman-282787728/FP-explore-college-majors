Soon they discover that the killer is a clown! It's a coll Indie film. Get it if you like Indie films or are just in the moodd for a funny scary movie.",1074470400,3,319,3.8484848484848486
8168358,1,B00006G8GY,lets get one thing straight right away here.  this is definitely not a suspense or a scary film.  apparently its not intended to be either.  pretty much one big rap video.  just all about music for the most part.  only check out if your a huge rap fan.  otherwise you won't know what your getting into.  ...,1050192000,6,307,4.280701754385965
8168359,5,B00006G8GY,"Raging Nation Films has come out with movie #3, and each one just gets better and better! This is a movie full of laughs and suspense that will make you sit up on the edge of your seat until the very end. Don't watch this flick thinking it's going to be ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Casablanca"", classics to be sure, but rather dry and stuffy films full of people filling their stereotyped gender and race roles. ""Urban Massacre"" is one of the best of a new genre, a genre of movies about and in the middle of the hip-hop culture. Grab on to this new wave while you still can, because soon this film will be a ""classic"" in its own right!",1041379200,,627,4.190082644628099
8168360,5,B00006G8GY,"Hey yall. Just kick back, press play and light up. This joint will have you rolling on the floor in minutes. Too much to single out any one particular scene but the cop dude is the funniest guy since Jim Carey and had us screaming. Other pluses was the music and sex scene. Out.",1041379200,2,278,4.166666666666667
8168361,5,B00006G8GY,I thought that the movie was well paced and well acted by the rappers. The music was really really good and the little dog was very funny also. I can't wait to see the sequel.,1040256000,,175,4.0285714285714285
8168362,5,B00006G8GY,"Straight up, this flick was funny as all hell. This flick is as funny as any Scary Movie flick and as scary as any of the Friday The 13 or Halloween installments. On a whole other tip the rappers in this flick are straight spittn' fire. No matter if your an MC from the east coast, west coast or north pole or south pole you's got a respect these cats. Cita from BET 's Cits's world is also funny and La La from MTV is fine as hell.
And the fat dude from Juice and Phat Beach is amazingly funny and helps out cats like Ill One, Capone and Guru get through the flick! 5 thumbz up!",1036022400,,579,3.9572649572649574
