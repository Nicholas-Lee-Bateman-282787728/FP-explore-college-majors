3823967,5,B001W63DX2,"Just after enjoying two Iron Maiden Concerts in Costa Rica, I saw this movie last Wednesday 22nd in San Jos and definitely it was the best way to close a successful world wide tour, an amazing present for all Iron Maiden's Fans. By far, the best rock documentary I had ever seen. This is a must have DVD for anyone who appreciate REAL bands, REAL musicians. In his first documentary ""The History Of Iron Maiden - Pt. 1: The Early Days""...the beginning and the process of conforming the best metal band of all times and now in Flight 666... other sides of the band and the evidence of Iron Maiden's positive and permanent influence. SCREAM FOR MAIDEN...COSTA RICA!!!",1240531200,7,665,4.6440677966101696
3823968,5,B001W63DX2,"I saw this movie on Tuesday in Chula Vista with my wife.  This was our Anniversary present to each other.  This movie was awesome.  We saw three shows on Maiden's S.B.I.T. Tour, and this movie was like reliving those shows all over again.  My wife & I were headbanging to and singing along with the all the songs in the movie.  Not just us, but everyone in the theater was doing the same.  A great time was had by all!!  The last time we had that much fun at the movies was the Opening Night for Star Wars Episode III.  When the movie was over, we pre-ordered it there at the theater.  Hell, we wanted the DVD right then and there!!  6/09/09 just can't come fast enough for us.  UP THE IRONS!!!! \M/ \M/",1240531200,5,703,4.1716417910447765
3823969,5,B001W63DX2,"I saw this movie in Chicago, and it was the best rock documentary I have ever seen.  It shows sides of maiden that you would not see otherwise.  It brings you up close with them, and shows the type of people that they really are, which is a bunch of guys that really appreciate their fans.  I will be buying this.  This is a must have for anyone who appreciates bands, and what they bring to the world.",1240444800,2,402,4.115384615384615

3823996,5,B001W63DX2,"Literally, my favorite moment is when the airport has to announce Flight 666.  LOL.  That 757 is a true Chariot of the Gods.  And its origin is interesting.  To see Eddie on the tail wing and waving from the front of the fuselage is hilarious.  Stewardesses in Iron Maiden shirts--oh, hell yes.

The concert footage is incredible.  Iron Maiden always sounds as good as their albums!  That's a feat.  Every clip is awesome, musically impressive, and beautiful.  Metal at its best.

And not only is this an awesome following of Metal Legends, it is a class in session: DON'T EAT IN INDIA.  LOL.  ""Buckets for both ends"" on each side of the stage, my friends.  Priceless pain revealed.

If you love Iron Maiden, watch this and you will love them more.  Great stuff.  A glimpse into the rarely-glamorous lives of a hard-working, jovial bunch who suffer a bit to make metal across the globe.  These guys and their crew are a group of characters you'd love( and maybe soon hate) to live with, but they are always fun to watch.

Flight 666: WATCH IT, BUY IT, BOW TO IT.  Or Eddie WILL find you.",1410825600,,1087,4.505154639175258

3824000,5,B001W63DX2,"A fantastic and interesting production of their finest work.  As all of the British greats (clapton, zeppelin, stones, who) get older, iron maiden is looking awesome in comparison.",1404345600,,180,5.428571428571429
3824001,5,B001W63DX2,"this documentary has EVERYTHING !!!
Rather than a concert in one or two places, this has them traveling and rocking in 13 cities worldwide.
Energy, power, passion...one of the best tock concerts out there !!!",1397001600,,208,4.9714285714285715

3824003,5,B001W63DX2,"Bought it after 1 of the DVDs on my original version was damaged. Great documentary of a great band, & it should be interesting to even the casual fan who might find HOW Maiden tours to be unique. Not every band has their singer piloting the 757 they use on tour, & that plane, is a big part of the story. Also, it provides a window into the band's support team, their road crew, & it's fans.",1387843200,,392,4.103896103896104
3824004,5,B001W63DX2,This video  deserved a five star rating because the performances of the band were classic.  The guitarists get better with age.  The solos were terrific.  I also enjoyed watching the reactions of the fans who were  from all over the world.  Iron Maiden is world class.  I would recommend this video to any one interested in seeing Iron Maiden live.  It has a documentary of the tour included with the concert footage.,1380672000,,417,4.694444444444445
3824005,5,B001W63DX2,"Great, great, great.  I think that about sums it up.  This is essentially a World Slavery Tour concert done with today's band and crew.  Plus, you get to see them fly from show to show and tag along on their days off.  And the second disc is just the concert and no documentary.  You can see the show either way.  You can't go wrong buying this, unless you just don't like classic Iron Maiden.  In this case, WTF is wrong with you?",1379894400,,431,4.182926829268292
3824006,5,B001W63DX2,During the interview sections that were on the documentary version of this film what was the blues tune that ADRIAN SMITH was playing in his dressing room as a warmup practice session?,1370822400,,184,4.78125
3824007,5,B001W63DX2,Great movie and concert DVDs. Great to see Maiden behind the scenes. They really still have it after all the years.,1367107200,,115,4.523809523809524

3824009,5,B001W63DX2,got this for my brother as a gift i hope that he enjoyed it as much as he seemed glad to be getting it,1365292800,,102,3.2916666666666665
3824010,2,B001W63DX2,"Just finished the ""film"" portion of this set. You really don't get much ""access"" to the band as they would have you believe. Essentially you see the band and crew get on Ed Force One to whatever city they play next. Then you see the band get in the van that takes them from the airport, eat some pizza. Then they arrive at the hotel at which point the band and crew leave both fans and documentary crew behind til show time. After show time, they go back on Ed Force One and guess what? They do the same thing again. About the only variant from this routine is on their day off. Then we get a minute of golf, soccer, and visiting the pyramids in Mexico, and interviews from the band members scattered throughout. About the only thing worth mentioning about this documentary is the passion the fans have for this band, especially in Latin America. I personally would have been more interested in hearing just from them.",1362873600,,918,4.437869822485207
3824011,4,B001W63DX2,"This isn't a concert DVD as I thought. It's concert footage of full length songs in different cities. Well done, not cheesy, just don't be disappointed.
Bruce Dickinson taxiing and flying ""Ed Force One,"" their Boeing 757 is really cool, as he pilots the band city to city on the tour.",1360108800,,284,4.588235294117647
3824012,5,B001W63DX2,"Having been able to see maiden for the first time in this tour I gotta say that I was given more than what I originally expected. Set list is great, performances are flawless and the vibe is simply unique and breathtaking.

This show, plus the documentary is a must have for Maiden and heavy metal fans.",1359417600,,303,4.410714285714286
3824013,5,B001W63DX2,"My husband is a big Iron Maiden fan and he has been wanting this dvd so when I saw it I bought it!
Very prompt delivery!!!",1356825600,,122,3.730769230769231
3824014,5,B001W63DX2,This is a hard to find movie! I bought this for my brother who absolutely loves Iron Maiden.  The movie shipped lightning fast and had it within a couple days!!,1356480000,,160,4.333333333333333
3824015,5,B001W63DX2,Absolutely love it!!! Great and funny movie and awesome concert footaged- hard to believe they are still going strong after 20 years,1355356800,,132,5.045454545454546
3824016,5,B001W63DX2,The Flight 666 shows the band's continuous energetic and enthusiastic worldwide performance even at an elder age. The setlist during their live shows contain much of their old materials that are reminiscent of the metal of the 1980s. It is impressive to see that this 80s bands continues to produce incredible shows and music resonating to the modern generation of metal lovers. An excellent and memorable item to own and definitely has a value several decades from now.,1354492800,,470,5.038461538461538
3824017,5,B001W63DX2,This dvd is their best ever. every song is a highlight in and of itself. the documentary by sam dunne is just as good as the show performances.,1354233600,,143,4.142857142857143
3824018,5,B001W63DX2,"This video is heavy on the concert footage and that's a great thing. Iron Maiden is by far the most energetic band I've ever seen live, and their music makes their shows  even better. So far I have this and Rock in Rio. They're both great, but the band seems to have more energy on this one. I can't wrap my mind around the speed and technicality of Steve Harris' playing; it's incredible. It's like him and the rest of the band are 20 years old and have been playing for a hundred years.",1352073600,,488,4.191489361702128
3824019,2,B001W63DX2,"My first impression of this DVD was severe disappointment, because of the ridiculous over-editing, and the bad choices:  too many shots of a musician's back, way too many crowd shots, etc.

It took a year for me to give a second viewing, and now I would bump my review up to 3 stars.

What's good about this video:

* The music

* The energy of the shows

* Showing each song from a different town.

This is a good video to work out to, because the sweaty energy is contagious, and of course, jeez, it's Maiden.",1341014400,3,511,4.260416666666667
3824020,2,B001W63DX2,"mine did not work on tv but it work on my laptop..:(good my husband still like it,im kinda scared since its my first time to order dvd here but glad it work in pc..",1340755200,,164,3.8529411764705883
3824021,5,B001W63DX2,"IRON MAIDEN is more than a band...it's a legend!!! They got so many metal gems...they never sold their sound or image for money or more fame...Their lyrics are anthems in the metal world...Also, the MAIDEN menbers are nice persons, charismatic persons, ellegant persons...They are trully metal LORDS!!! If you like their sound, this is a nice trip through some of the MAIDEN menbers lives travelling the world...TRULLY, UP THE IRONS!!!!!!",1338940800,,438,5.271428571428571
3824022,5,B001W63DX2,"Been a Maiden fan since the beginning and this documentary is a nice addition to my library. I noticed though that the DVD covers the early part of the tour...are we gonna be seeing a part II?? Overall, lots of info and music in one package.",1331510400,,241,4.260869565217392
3824023,5,B001W63DX2,Without a doubt this is the best concert dvd I've ever seen!!! To see the effort these guys put into they're show is inspiring!!To see Bruce Dickinson fly the Maiden Jet (Ed Force One) is the coolest thing!!,1312761600,,207,4.473684210526316
3824024,5,B001W63DX2,"We have this DVD on Blu ray and on regular dvd, the reason why, is, my husband is Military and likes to bring his Maiden DVDs with him when he deploys, his laptop does not play blu rays, so we have to have one of each..he loves this DVD and watches it along with many others when he is home, I can ONLY imagine what he is putting his ship through with this DVD.. That be told, this is a Great DVD for Maiden Fans...",1311552000,,415,3.8941176470588235
3824025,3,B001W63DX2,"I don't even remember what I paid for this but it probably wasn't worth it.  I mean, it's a blu-ray and they can't get decent sound on it?  I should have rented this one first and not bought it.  I don't imagine I will be watching it much.  Sure I like to watch the concert footage and reminisce about Maiden concerts of days past (yikes, many days past at this point, how long has it been since eighth grade, twenty five years?) but I also want great video and great sound.  The video is decent, but the sound is horrible.  Really bad, to the point where on a number of the songs, I can't barely understand what Bruce is saying.  So all in all, disappointing.",1297987200,,660,4.232
3824026,3,B001W63DX2,"Given teh great opportunity given the camera crew, this DVD dissapoints. It's indeed a little bit ""shallow"", in the sense that the guys really don't open themselves. But, this was not intended to be ""SOME KIND OF MONSTER"", so, in general, it achieves its goal: to give a brief glimpse of Iron Maiden on tour.

Well, at least Samallwood admits that Janick Gers ""never plays the same thing twice"" and ""the guys sometimes look at him and aks what are you doing?"".

It achieves its goal. But this goal simply do not interest me much.",1297987200,3,529,4.557894736842106
3824027,5,B001W63DX2,I enjoyed this one very much. Great source of inspiration to see 50+ guys going at it with the same intensity after all these years.,1297123200,,132,4.32
3824028,5,B001W63DX2,"While I cannot say I am a true Maiden fan any longer, I really liked this DVD.  Seeing Bruce flying the band to each new location, watching Steve Harris autographing pictures on the plane, then seeing the band playing golf or sight seeing, is what makes this band so different.  After 30 (god has it been that long) years, they still are only interested in giving their best to their fans.  You will not see a bunch of overweight drunken junkies in this film, but a band who somehow has stayed clean throughout their career (same cannot be stated about their original Lead Singer).  Well worth the buy even if you are (like me) a larger fan of Maiden's work with Dianno than with Dickinson.",1296864000,,690,4.496
3824029,5,B001W63DX2,"First, I got the DVD. The material is excelent. I am a really hard fan of Maiden, so I got the Blue Ray.
I was astonished. In a few movies I have seem so  dramatic diferences  between DVD and Bluy Ray as this concert.
I enjoyed every penny I put in that.",1289433600,,254,3.8653846153846154
3824030,5,B001W63DX2,"Both DVDs have an excellent image quality and with the film I can see everything that happened during the tour. In some places happened events that could cancel the concert on this country.
I was excited and still feel if I am at the concert.",1288310400,,242,4.4
3824031,4,B001W63DX2,Watching The Documentary was absolutely great...not a lot of Bands Release A DVD or Documentary Showing Almost All of their privacy backstage and on their free time while they are touring...and watching this from a super band like Maiden Its simply Great and a great purchase not only being a Maiden Fan but Also being a Metal Fan! highly Reccomended,1286409600,,350,4.85
3824032,5,B001W63DX2,"Loved it from start to finish. Its great to hear from the guys themselves. Watching Bruce fly the plane was great then the Live set DVD, unbelievable!",1282348800,,150,4.592592592592593
3824033,5,B001W63DX2,"Flight 666 is an amazing rock documentary centering around Iron Maiden who've not only survived 34 but are still extremely relevant. This movie globally captures Iron Maiden on tour & is alluring enough to even non I.M. fans. Undoubtedly already cast in stone as one of the all time greatest bands, Flight 666 is at the pinnacle of arena rock. And for those who've never seen or heard I.M. live, the bonus disc is a plus.",1279670400,,421,4.552631578947368

Hail Maiden!",1278288000,,117,4.523809523809524
3824035,5,B001W63DX2,"The film itself is motivating and lifting, watching these six guys flying around in an airplane doing what they love.

The concert footage includes three of my four all-time favorite Iron Maiden songs, all of which are rarely performed anymore (Aces High, Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Moonchild -- the song not included is The Evil That Men Do, but they almost always play that).  Additionally there are some other songs that you don't get to see live too often, like Powerslave, The Clairvoyant, Can I Play With Madness, Wasted Years, Heaven Can Wait, and Revelations.  They also play some of the more common songs like 2 Minutes to Midnight, The Trooper, Hallowed Be Thy Name, The Number of the Beast, Fear of the Dark and Run to the Hills.

Overall the track selection in my opinion couldn't be much better and I strongly believe that this is possibly their best live performance recorded to date -- it's definitely on the same par as as Live After Death -- I would have to say a little better.  They sound really good!",1275696000,,1025,4.6098901098901095
3824036,5,B001W63DX2,"I recommend this movie even to people who don't like heavy metal. This is a film about six guys doing what they love, living outside the stereotypical debauched rockstar existence, and making millions of people quite happy with their rather gentle (for heavy metal) music.

Whether you like heavy metal, or even rock music, it's part of life. It's how teenagers learn about the world, among other things, since their parents are busy working and our cultural centers like churches and traditions are on the wane. If you had to pick a heavy metal band to respect, Iron Maiden is it, and this documentary tells us with gradual anecdotes why this is true.

Flying around the world in their own plane, piloted by their vocalist, the band attempt a mega-tour of 36 dates around the world, delighting audiences in Latin America, North America, Asia and Europe. Dunn and McFayden start their portrait of this band by showing us the typical rock star stuff: the thronging crowds, the complexity of setting up the stage, the giant amplifiers and security.

Having introduced us to the ostensible, they go deeper, into the personalities of the band and what they are as people. The answer is that they're fairly mild-mannered musicians who are thoroughly enjoying making music, touring the world, playing golf and scuba diving, and in some cases, bringing their families along. They don't seem to care at all about upholding the rock star image that negative propaganda like ""Dethklok"" hopes to make us see everywhere heavy metal is mentioned.

The point of this movie is that success isn't just about being money or being popular. It's about putting together songs people like with an image people find inspiring, and the origin of this mentality is in well-adjusted very normal people who simply love what they do and want to keep doing it. Whether the subject is lawyers, technical divers or rock stars, this subject brings calm to the mind as we all like hearing about success stories that involve the soul as well as the credit card.

In addition to this insight into the character of one of heavy metal's longest-running and most wide-selling bands, ""Flight 666"" offers us expertly-edited live shots of the band that include most of a dozen of their most emblematic and enduring songs. It's not quite a concert video, but there's a concert video hidden within it, in addition to scenes of the band recording, playing for personal enjoyment, and talking about music.

Not only would I let my kids see this, but I'd encourage them to see it -- this is a wholesome portrait of people who got to the top of the world by doing what they loved, doing it well, and not getting sidetracked into the politics of image.

3824037,5,B001W63DX2,"Iron Maiden is what all rock and roll should be - stratosphere searing vocals, heart palpitating percussion work that can wake the dead,  a bass guitar firing sonic bullets into your soul and three dragon fire breathing electric guitars that dance seamlessly together before one rises up to immolate you.

To this combustible brew you add thoughtfully crafted lyrics, musical honesty, the amazing respect & admiration the band mates have for each other, an unwavering desire to please their faithful fan base and you get three decades of unforgettable music and concert performances that make other ""big name"" bands look feeble and geriatric.

There are 2 DVDs in this set. The Film DVD takes you behind the scenes to get a sense of the band members between shows, the logistical challenges of the tour and touches the pulse of the, at times, rabid yet always faithful fan base.  The music only DVD takes you through some of the best music Maiden has created throughout their long and highly prolific history.  Both DVDs are outstanding.

You can go golfing with the amiable and life loving drummer Nikko McBrain, peak over the shoulders of lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson as he pilots the 757 (dubbed Ed Force One) that carried the entire crew and concert gear from city to city,  and meet word painter and bassist extraordinaire Steve Harris' wonderful children who accompany him on the tour.

The triple axmen - Dave Murray, Janick Gers and Adrian Smith share their thoughts about what Iron Maiden is truly about (The Music) and their respect and appreciation for what their co-leading guitarist brothers create and contribute to their layered and synergistic signature sound.

Or jump into the concert roller coaster (along with Costa Rican, Australian, Canadian, Argentinean, Japanese, Chilean, American fanatics) and experience again many of the best songs every created by Iron Maiden including: 2 Minutes to Midnight,  Aces High, Run to the Hills,  The Number of the Beast and Power Slave.  All 16 songs kick copious booty!

I could go on but it is simply much more effective and enjoyable if you buy this set.  You won't be disappointed.",1262736000,,2144,4.985955056179775

3824039,5,B001W63DX2,"I remember seeing Iron Maiden and Judas Priest (talk about a great 'double bill'!) at The Palladium in NYC, back when Paul DiAnno was the vocalist (yes, i'm a 'fossil' of 48, LOL!).  Seeing the artwork on that first album (does anyone remember LP's?) and seeing them live pretty much convinced me that I would probably be an Iron Maiden fan for life!  They were that good, and that original as the British invasion of metal spanned the globe (Saxon, Def Leppard, Judas Priest, Maiden, etc.).  To see them come this far, and be so widely loved and acclaimed worldwide is great.  This DVD captures the essence and passion of their worldwide fan base, and shows how much of a 'renaissance man' Bruce truly is, given his many talents and varied interests.  Of course, seeing a documentary (rockumentary) of Bruce pilot a Boeing 757 carrying his bandmates, crew, and equipment is awesome.  There are many comical and lighthearted moments in this DVD as we observe Bruce and company handle the logistics of a major world tour.  The other DVD consists of full songs (one song each) culled from each city of their world tour.  The performances are passionate and tight, and the video and audio quality second to none.  These guys are probably old enough to be grandparents, yet they still command the stage as if they were in their 20's!  Get this double-DVD set.

The quality of the documentary is amazing and I like it because it does print the personality of each member of the band and their manager!

Just one more thing: in the booklet which reads Dickinson's notes on the tour, said he enjoyed the Chilean pisco. I'm glad IRON MAIDEN came to Peru in 2009 and I hope that Dickinson might have taken a PISCO SOUR and check THAT ONLY ORIGINAL PISCO IS FROM PERU!!!!!!!!",1258156800,,531,4.353535353535354

This is a good-natured documentary of the Somewhere Back in Time tour.  There's no tension or drama a la Metallica's ""Some Kind of Monster"" or Wilco's ""I am Trying to Break Your Heart.""  These guys seem to really enjoy their music, their lives, and each other.  There is NOTHING old or tired about them, and that makes watching them for an hour and forty minutes pure fun.

Writer/director Sam Dunn tells us at the beginning of the film that Maiden is his favorite band.  He and Scot McFadyn have paid the band an immense tribute with this film.  It is well-executed and enjoyable from start to finish.  Excellent.",1256688000,,856,4.72972972972973

At a time when most bands from their era have either become caricatures of themselves or nostalgia acts, Maiden continue to evolve and push the envelope of their music; they re-invigorate songs that they have been playing for over two decades and still keep them fresh and exciting. Iron Maiden are simply amazing in terms of songwriting and stagecraft. There are bands half their age who cannot rival their output. This is not just another token filler live album between studio albums: this is a document of these Metal veterans at the top of, and re-inventing their game as they play it. A must buy for fans and a good place to start if you are still not one. Up the Irons.",1255564800,,819,4.503355704697986

3824045,5,B001W63DX2,"Flight 666 The Film follows the band during their Somewhere Back In Time tour in the 23 concerts the band were plaing. Being a huge fan of Iron Maiden, when Flight 666 came out this June along with soundtrack of the film(the live songs on disc 2)I had to buy it. This film was said to be showing the band's life on tour and everyone who knows the band know that they are private to a certain point about their lives. Here they are showing the fans what it's like to be in the band or working for the band. And I haven't been disappointed, I've been surprised on how complete it was as it goes into details and there are interesting stories from the countries they played during the tour. You have to understand first that Iron Maiden is not your average band. No other band has a lead singer who also pilots the band's own private plane during a tour across five continents. They are also respected everywhere they go and they have influenced many bands of today.

You have to admire them for staying down to earth people even with their success and for the fact that they have many great songs and albums. They are entertaining onstage and fans will find out just like I did that they are as much offstage. Capturing the intensity of band on tour is not an easy task but Sam Dunn's team (for those who don't know him, he made the Metal - A Headbanger's Journey and Global Metal documentaries which I would recommend watching if you are a fan of rock n' roll music or heavy metal or whatever YOU want to call it) just did that, I'm glad they were the ones who did this documentary as someone else might have screwed up. Oh and this is not about Dunn it's about the band.

The purpose of the Somewhere Back In Time tour was to offer their increasingly younger fan base those classics song they might not have seen the band perform before. This means for the band going back to the classics, for this tour they performed songs like ""Rime Of The Ancient Mariner""(Bruce Dickinson said it was his favorite song to perform during the tour) and ""Can I Play With Madness"". They always played their old stuff but this goes further into the songs they didn't play, of course the tour still featured songs they always play like ""Number Of The Beast"" and ""Fear of The Dark"". The stage set was even reminiscent of the one used during the Powerslave tour mixed with a little of Somewhere In Time, it looks very good. The live footage shown in this film will likely blow you away, the band sounds amazing.

It also shows people talking about Iron Maiden and their stories are interesting to hear. For instance the Priest who has many tattoos of the band and claims to be their biggest fan. Or someone saying just how much an Iron Maiden concert means to them, for how long they've been waiting etc. It may sound boring here but it certainly isn't. You see the road crew, how they build the stage, the fans nearly making a riot at a hotel where the band stays. It seems everyone was having fun during this tour, everyone smiles and tells jokes, fools around or something, you see that the band enjoy each others company and they still like selling out their concerts all over the world.

Iron Maiden has always been exciting to watch and this DVD is another reason why. You also get another disc of the 17 live songs used on the Flight 666 soundtrack; the songs have been picked from different cities so each song is different from another and makes a show altogether. The film shows a good part of this disc already but if you only want to watch the live part it's nice to have. I have it and I've watched it already a good dozen times and each time I find it as good as before. Live After Death is the best Maiden concert DVD but Flight 666 is a great look at the band and is just as good. If you're a fan this a must never before has Maiden been shown this way, it's hard to believe just how good it is. It's hard to describe but if you are a fan of the band you just have to see this. There two versions the special edition has a better booklet, I own the standard edition as it was what was available to me.",1255305600,,4096,4.2881136950904395
3824046,4,B001W63DX2,"It was interesting to see all that goes into making a marathon 45-day tour.  I'd also bet Bruce is just about the only lead singer who can also pilot a jumbo jet.

I rented the DVD.  It's worth one viewing, but it's not something I'd want to buy and keep.  And I'm saying this as someone who's been a huge Maiden fan for the last 23 years and also a fan of Dickinson's solo work.

I was disappointed by the relatively limited concert performance, though you can find that on other DVDs.

It was great to see these ""old"" guys introducing their music to a new generation.  Many of those in the crowds were teens & college age and they're chanting for a band where the youngest member (Dickinson) is 51-years-old and is playing songs that were written before many of these fans were born.

This was their Back In Time tour so they only played their old 1980s work, which I guess would attract a younger fan base since people like me would prefer to hear newer songs in addition to stuff I first heard in the mid-1980s.",1253059200,,1015,4.333333333333333

Maybe I was under the wrong impression, but I could have sworn that the movie part was going to be a heck of a lot longer. They really just scratched the surface of what was happening. That aside, there are a lot of great little nuggets of human moments around the band in the film. It is well done. The backstage pantomimes of the crew were particularly funny during Run To The Hills and 2 Minutes. I'm not sure if it's a criticism or not, but I guess I just wanted more of it. The film of the concert clips were great 1st because it's maiden and secondly because it's been shot and edited by someone other than the band and the quick cuts and jumping around of previous concerts has been toned down quite a bit. The concert is a real celebration of Maiden. The sound and the performances are all first rate, especially Bruce who is just on fire right now.

3824051,5,B001W63DX2,"Having had the privilege of seeing Maiden on this tour and also watching the movie on the one day it was released nationwide, I have to say it was just as good seeing it the second time.  The heart of the movie is really after the stop in LA, when the band descends into South America.  Nothing new about metal bands playing in Mexico, but the footage of the shows in Costa Rica, Columbia and beyond was phenomenal.  You just get a huge appreciation for what we in the U.S. take for granted (like, great metal bands coming to an arena near you).  To watch what kids in some countries have to go through to see a band in ""the a** of the world"", as one guy in Costa Rica put it, is simply unbelievable.  The scene of the fans in Columbia, camping out for a week, being abused by the police and stripped of their food, really put things in perspective.

And here's the kicker: these kids are just so thankful that ANYONE would play in their respective countries, Maiden doesn't even have to work hard to put on a good show!  But they do, and then some.  These guys are absolute professionals, and while they are clearly enjoying the fruits of their labors from the past 2+ decades of performing, they really do seem to care about putting on a show that's worthy of the hard-earned dollars their fans paid to see them.  I never tire of hearing them perform their ""hits"" and I will always see them when they come to town.

  My only complaint is  They did alot of songs I never heard before, and they didn't even do ""Breaking the Law"" which was one of their best tunes, I kept thinking well maybe their saving that one for the encore, but they never did it)  But it was still a great show that I would recommend to any metal fan.",1249862400,2,534,4.227722772277228

The documentary disc was entertaining, informative, and very well produced; the band's senses of humor were allowed to breathe throughout, and it is refreshingly apparent these guys don't seem to take themselves too too seriously.

My only criticism is the sound quality of some of the tunes on the concert disc #2. I have a decent surround system, and in Dolby surround, what sounded like piped-in, tinny artificial crowd noise was pretty prevalent throughout some of the earlier songs. Let's face it, crowd noise does push the meter at the beginning / end of songs and at the very beginning of the show itself, but what producer or sound engineer thought it was a good idea to have this apparently added post production? Crowd shots show an enraptured audience for sure, but not one where legions of fans are contributing to the white noise din. The NFL has done this for years with their marquis big whoop events, but a concert should be about the music, no? We all know crowds get loud, I just prefer not to have the tweeters in the back of my room give me a non-band related headache due to an overzealous hand at the mixing board.",1249516800,,1196,4.615023474178404

The concert DVD is top notch and the sound quality is better than anything that they have put since the reunion.

This DVD documents the band's return to the music of the mid 80's and their most popular era with a remake of the POWERSLAVE TOUR (w/music from Seventh Son). The documentary was nice, nothing too insightful, but the 2nd disc is the true gem here. The concert and band's live performance reveal why Maiden is the best metal band around.

This is a back stage pass, so to speak, of a monumental tour.  I won't reprint the details of the tour but suffice it to say it is incredible.
  What is truly amazing to me are the reactions of the fans in places like India and especially South America.  One young man truly captures the power of music to an oppressed and very poor population.  It must be an incredible feeling for the band to be a part of this.  In other parts of the world, Iron Maiden is experiencing a ""new awakening"".  More and more and younger and younger fans are just now starting to discover this terrific band.  There is a great quote from Nicko McBrain were he says the band keeps getting older, but the kids in the front row keep getting younger!
  The interviews with the band are not as much as what I was hoping for, but they are good enough; and it is easy to see how even the road crew loves this group.  The sheer power of this band is immense, and it fills me with a warm fuzzy feeling to see that they are still playing just as loud as they used to do back in the late 70's and early 80's.
This DVD is well worth delving into.  If you are a fan of Iron Maiden, then you are not reading this review anyway.  If you are simply interested or a newcomer to Maiden, then, by all means, ""Up the Irons"" and buy.

3824068,4,B001W63DX2,"Don't get me wrong here, I love the documentary, however, Sam Dunn did not achieve what he did with ""Headbangers Journey.""  I met Sam in the parking lot of Izod Center for the first US show on this tour and from talking to him, I was excited about the effort, but to me, he missed the mark.  First off, too much time wasted on concert footage, all of which is supplied on the concert DVD.  Second, the band interviews were weak and minimal, though the sharing of opinions of one another was interesting and seeing Adrian and his wife play tennis was mildly entertaining (we've already seen Dave and Nicko play golf on Rock in Rio, so that was a dupe).  There was nothing new learned about the band on this DVD.  I feel that the documentaries in Death on the Road, Matter of Life Limited CD and even the short Day in the Life and Meet the Band from Rock in Rio was more informative.  Third, they show Dio, Kerry King, Scott Ian, Vinnie Appice, and who do they talk to?  A short blurb from Lars Ulrich and Tom Morello.  Fourth, were are the fan interviews?  One or two short clips from overseas (again, Death on the Road was better, as was Headbangers Journey).

To me, the most interesting aspect of the film as seeing the plane with Bruce at the controls and even that footage was minimal, which is the second reason to purchase this DVD.  The main reason is the concert footage.  In my opinion, this is the best Maiden concert video, just behind Rock and Rio and way above the Death on the Road concert.

3824071,4,B001W63DX2,"Flight 666 is a two DVD set that documents the beginning of Iron Maiden's 2008 Somewhere Back In Time World Tour.  The project was a unique 23 city tour, spanning several continents, starting in Mumbai, India and ending in Toronto, Canada, with the band and road crew travelling between cities on a private 757 jet, known as `Ed Force One'.  One disc (The Film) contains a 112 minute documentary of the endeavor, covering the genesis of the project, and the logistical issues involved, along with interviews, conversations and behind the scenes looks at the band.  There is some live footage, but no complete songs are featured.  The second disc (The Concert) contains sixteen live performances, with each song from a different city on the tour.  While you may have seen Maiden live before, you probably have not seen them quite like this.

One of the vanguards of heavy metal, Iron Maiden made their recording debut nearly thirty years ago. Following the release of their album Powerslave in 1985, and near the peak of their popularity, the band embarked on the World Slavery Tour.  From this tour came the live recording `Live After Death' on both vinyl and CD, and finally in 2008, a two disc DVD release of the historic Long Beach Arena performance with bonus materials.  The Somewhere Back in Time tour, is an attempt to revisit those times, part of which includes adopting the Egyptian motif for the stage dcor, similar to that used for the World Slavery tour.  The set list includes concert staples, as well as songs from post-Powerslave albums, up to Fear of the Dark.

Flight 666 is for both the casual and hardcore Maiden fan.  Judging by the audiences that turned out for their performances on this tour, the number of devoted fans appears to be quite massive worldwide.  Given the current state of music, with metal receiving little airplay or publicity, it is encouraging to see that Maiden is drawing in new young fans, many who were not even born at the time of the original World Slavery Tour.  With the popularity of other genres of music, and vocal based phenomena like American Idol, it is nice to know that a rock band that actually plays real music, has such a huge, well-deserved, international following.  The documentary provides an interesting look at the tour and those that made it happen, and updates regarding how the members of band are doing.

The second disc featuring the live performances, is what most will want to see.  Tightly edited, each number is preceded by the song title, location, and date of the performance.  The video quality is first class, with many views of the massive stage, the band and the audience.  Again similar to Rock in Rio, there is not much time in between cuts.  Vocalist Bruce Dickinson is still favoring the funky pants with reflective strips, and dons costumes or employs props for specific songs, such as a red cavalry coat and British flag for The Trooper.  Also making reappearance during Powerslave, is the bird's head mask, which was part of the World Slavery tour.  Bruce looks to be very fit, and full of energy, roaming over the stage, and not holding back in hitting the high notes.

A barefoot Niko McBrain delivers his usual high energy performance on drums.  Steve Harris, the heartbeat of the band, while still aggressive, seems to be a bit more in the background than usual, an impression which may be due to the editing.  Much of the material featured is from the period when the band was a quintet with Dave Murray and Adrian Smith on guitar, and perhaps looking to replicate the Murray/Smith solos from the original recordings, the majority of the lead guitar parts are divided up along those original lines.  This kind of leaves guitarist Janick Gers, as the odd man out, with few opportunities to play lead (Fear of the Dark and Moonchild probably being his most prominent efforts).  On Rock in Rio, which featured mostly material from Gers' time with the band, this was certainly not the case, as Janick did a lot of lead work.  Still the chemistry within the band seems to be fine, with good spirits all around.  Dave Murray as always is an amazing soloist, and Adrian Smith squeezes some remarkable licks from his instrument, as the solos in particular do indeed have the character of the classic original versions.  The overall quality of the band's musicianship is close to perfection.

Noteworthy are the selections from Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (Moonchild, The Clairvoyant, Can I Play with Madness), and Somewhere In Time (Heaven Can Wait, Wasted Years), which haven't been featured live recently.  The band stretches out on the epic Rime of the Ancient Mariner, but even more boldness would have been truly fabulous.  Adding a few obscure songs like Stranger In a Strange Land, Die With Your Boots On, Caught Somewhere in Time, To Tame a Land, or Alexander the Great would have taken things even further.  Still, this is a very solid selection of 80's Maiden material.  If that is your favorite time period for the band, this set and Live After Death, would be the ones to look at, depending on whether the actual, or retro version is to your liking.  Maiden usually gives their fans a lot.  The packaging is like a book, with booklet type liner notes, with plenty of background information and photos.

Remarkably, this was just the first leg of the Somewhere Back in Time tour for 2008.  The band hit the road again in May 2008 playing in the USA and Canada, then finishing up in Europe in August.  Maiden were back out again in the spring of 2009, hitting the middle east, India, New Zealand, Central and South America, finishing in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  Icons in the world of heavy metal, Iron Maiden continue to do what other bands can only dream of doing.  Bigger, bolder, better, it's hard to top Maiden.  Hopefully, after the band recharges their batteries they will get back into the studio for another metal masterwork.  For now, the fans can all enjoy Flight 666.  You get quite a lot, for a very reasonable price.",1245542400,3,6027,4.753846153846154
3824072,5,B001W63DX2,"I have to say this band really knows how to put out quality DVDs for us fans.  'The Early Years' and 'Live After Death/The Early Years Pt. 2' are one of the best DVDs by a rock band ever released - even Kiss(another huge favorite of mine).  Both DVDs have a ton of concert and documentary footage on 2 discs each as well as pictures, easter eggs, rare footage, etc.  It's virtually impossible for any Maiden fan to be dissapointed.  Although I would have to say getting through all the english accents is a challenge to my American ears.  Thank God for closed-caption.

Now comes Flight 666.  It is very high quality just like their previous DVDs.  The thing that struck me the most after watching it was how much fun they have on tour and how much they love what they are doing and thats a fun thing to watch.  Nicko McBrain is funny and good natured(as I'm sure Maiden fans already know) and is never seen in a bad mood or even a little tired anywhere on this documentary.  The crew seem to enjoy what they do and flash hand signals and sign language to each other from across the stage in accordance to the lyrics of whatever song Bruce is singing while on stage.  Its fun to see the band ham it up while on the plane going to a show('so much for sleeping' manager Rod Smallwood says), seeing the extreme hysteria of fans in every country(think BEATLEMANIA x10 is the best way I can describe it.  Even the band is a little freaked at times and laughing over it).  One fan is shown in tears and crossing his chest and looking to the sky thanking God that he is at a Maiden show and holding one of Nicko's drumsticks(it's a fairly long moment so we the viewer can realise his reaction) or signing hundreds and hundreds of photos while on the plane(and pushing each picture off the seat tray and seeing hundreds of the pictures in one big messy pile on the floor and Steve's son George collecting them or talking to Steve Harris' 4 kids or seeing what the band do on their days off(Nicko & Dave play golf, Adrian comically gets smacked in the forehead and gets his hat knocked off by a pro-tennis players fast serve causing the camera man to say 'thats in the movie!', etc).  The concert segments are really good.  Again, the band look like they are having the best time of their lives - not an easy thing to do I would think after nearly 30 years.  I was surprised they didn't do 'Flight of Icarus' or 'Where Eagles Dare', 2 standout songs from the era of songs they are performing.

The packaging is great.  Its the size of regular DVD case except that it is more like a hardback book with pages of a diary Bruce did for a rock magazine as well as pictures.  The very back of the book-like package has the 2 DVDs one halfway over the other to save room but very safe from scratching.

Great band.  Great DVD.  If you like their past DVDs then this one is a no brainer.  They are really good to their fans when it comes to home videos/dvds.  BUY IT.",1245456000,21,2950,4.292947558770344
3824073,5,B001W63DX2,"OMG I actually got TEARS during some parts of this, b/c it's so amazing to sit there at 35 years old thinking, ""Man, here I am watching the same great band and listening to the same great songs, some of them from when I was like TWELVE(!) and still being touched by them in the same way"".  All these years later and I still get chills when the recitation portion of ""Rime Of The Ancient Mariner"" concludes, and Steve's bouncy bass line kicks in.  I'm getting chills just writing about it, actually.  Maiden have been at the top of my list since I bought Live After Death after seeing it on Friday Night Concerts on MTV so very long ago, and there they remain.  The concert performances presented here take you right back to that place again, replicating many exciting facets of the historic World Slavery Tour, mixing thm in with all of the other eras for a bombastic amalgamation of Maiden glory.  Truly something special.  The film is presented in the style of Sam Dunn's other masterpiece, ""Metal: A Headbanger's Journey"", and is every bit as captivating and exciting to watch.  I can't say enough about this entire package.  Maiden have not let me down even once in 25 years (yes, even through the ""dark times"" of the X-Factor and Virtual X), and this package is further testament to their commitment to quality.",1245024000,,1316,4.594017094017094

Maiden has not only proven themselves to be one of the most popular and enduring Metal acts of all time, but have also displayed how over the years they have built an organization that pulled off a logistics nightmare the many of the Fortune 500 could not have.

3824077,5,B001W63DX2,"Iron Maiden has seen so many changes since Steve Harris first started the band, that its nice to see the current line up perform the tracks I remember from childhood. Watching this takes me back to a time when I was 14-years old, listening to Powerslave on a Sony Walkman.
What impresses me about Maiden, is that they can set aside the egos and bs and record albums and tour the world. I used to like Van Halen but they can't get it together like this. Also, this is the first time a rock/metal band has had their very own jet to travel in. Sure, some bands have used private planes in the past but nothing on this grand of a scale.
This is a great addition to your Iron Maiden DVD library.
You get the documentary of just what it take to create a plane to carry tons of music equipment and props and still have room for the band and the entire crew. It takes a lot of people working together to keep a band like Maiden up and running.
What really impressed me about watching this was the fan reaction was the same regardless of the country. You see screaming Japanese fans, fans in Alaska, LA, and Brazil, and the focus is on the energy that Maiden creates night and night at every gig. Not many bands can captured an audience like that over and over again. Some bands may get it right for one show and then have a few bad shows later on, but not Iron Maiden because of their focus and desire to make sure the fans have a good time at all costs.
The first DVD contains the film and the second contains 16-songs from the first Iron Maiden album to Fear of the Dark. The 2nd DVD shows you concert highlights from all the countries on the tour minus the flight times and jet lag. The jet lag had to be severe and its amazing to see the band members put out that much energy every night.
If you an Iron Maiden fan or into Metal, then watch Flight 666 and see a band in top form. You won't be disappointed with this.",1244592000,,1912,4.15633423180593

Yes I know they are excited and jumping around, but when I got to a concert I go to see the performers, not other people.

Edit to my review below.
Also notable, the audio on this dvd is lacking depth that was on the Rio dvd. I compared the audio between the two. The Rio DVD audio was significantly better with much more bottom end in the dvd. To be fair I was using the DTS tracks from both dvds.",1244505600,8,706,4.00709219858156

This is also a very good show and I felt the cutting of the concert was better than the recent batch of ADD edited shows...but that was my first impression and biased due to excitement over seeing a new show....I may change my mind with more comparison.

3824084,5,B001W63DX2,"I am in no way associated with Iron Maiden, DVD retailers, or any of the like. I am a lifelong Iron Maiden fan going back to 1982, and I wanted to share my take on the new DVD release.

= ""Flight 666: The Film,"" came out today, June 9th, and it is worth every penny of its purchase price. For anyone who saw Iron Maiden on The Somewhere Back in Time Tour, or has seen Maiden at any time in the past, I don't have to tell you how good of a show they put on, we all know, already. I wanted to just add my two cents about this DVD release, for anyone who was thinking about buying it, because not only is it an official Maiden release, it is also one hell of a bargain for what you get.
= Whether you get the ""standard"" issue, or the ""deluxe"" issue (only difference is the packaging, and you get an expanded booklet in the deluxe version) you get two discs. Disc 1 is ""Flight 666 The Movie,"" and Disc 2 is the concert footage from the film in its entirety, city to city.
= All footage from both discs is shot in high def, so everything looks great, I can't imagine what this looks like on the BLU-RAY format, must be mindblowing. The sound mix is excellent, and each disc caters to various sound systems no matter how simple or how high end they are. Sound formats include Dolby Digital 2.0, Dolby Digital 5.1, NTSC-PCM, and DTS. Personally I always like DTS, so I was pretty excited.
= As far as being a good bargain..... It is. I purchased this at Best Buy. They only had the ""deluxe"" edition which was listed at $16.99, but it's on sale for $11.99 !!!! It's less expensive than most audio cd's.
= As far as the content is concerned, well that is left up to the viewer. I thought the movie itself was pretty entertaining, a good mix of live footage, and documentary footage. The live concert disc is excellent because they go song to song, city to city, and you get to check out different Maiden fans, and venues from all over the world.
= As usual Iron Maiden delivers the goods with a class and integrity that most bands have never had, or lost a long time ago (ie. see Lars Ulrich in movie footage). Overall this is a quality DVD release, at a very fair price. It seems like Iron Maiden is always a step ahead of the game.",1244505600,31,2224,4.1720930232558135
3824085,5,B001W63DX2,"I had the distinct pleasure of seeing Maiden at the LA Forum in February '08, their first US stop on this tour and also the setting for the Number of the Beast live footage. I also saw them on the summer '08 US tour, in Phoenix. Although my copy of Flight 666 is in the mail right now, I, too, saw it on VH1 Classic over the weekend, and can say that it captures the intensity and sound of the live performances (as much as can be, that is), and all the backstage and tour footage and interviews add to the experience. If you're interested in an amazing band of professional, mature musicians, and how they've stuck to their guns for over 30 years, 14 studio albums, and numerous tours, buy this.

It's no wonder that they can still blow away bands less than half their age: they're obviously clear on what's most important, which is writing music about which they are passionate, and delivering it to fans as best they can; there's no puking, bloated old rock star behavior here. I thought it was funny to see Lars Ulrich, who is younger than these guys, chattering backstage at the LA show, looking like a tired old drunk...add to that Kerry King of Slayer, also at that show, who looks like he swallowed the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man...and contrast them both with Dave Murray and Nicko McBrain playing golf, or Adrian Smith fishing, while on tour -- and still bringing the house down every night. All of these points come through clearly in the documentary, through footage of the band on and off stage, and interviews with them and their road crew.

The performances are outstanding.  Bruce in fine voice, the playing excellent, the sound really not stadium affected, the band is VERY tight, the crowd shots and involvement just amazing.  A way to attend a Maiden concert without having to mingle.  I have most of their concert videos and this one is WAY better than the others.  I will play it over and over (my favorite Maiden stuff really well done and filmed.)

I thought the documentary stuff was pretty much standard rockumentary stuff.  (the part where members say only nice things about members of the family, the part about how hard the crew works, the drummer who is a good hearted goof,etc...) Suspect Maiden is another one of those bands where the members have grown into adults and don't want their family to be part of the circus that comes with fame.

3824095,3,B001W63DX2,"Well, I am a huge Iron Maiden fan (my #1 band) and have all their CD's & DVD's. I've seen Maiden every time they've been to Pittsburgh since the mid 90's: 1996 with Blaze/club show, the 2000 Dickinson return- he rightfully so went off on an ""elderly"" bottle thrower!, 2003 promoting the DVD music videos set, and last at 2005 Ozzfest (Bruce was knocking the time slot/sound issues/reality TV stars and this was before ""eggfest"").
Now onto the film- I saw this at a limited showing ""Maiden day"" screening at a full theater (was surprised) in Pittsburgh PA on a Tuesday night. Sound & picture quality were amazing.
To those that were hoping that this might be slowed down in the concert editing, so that you can actually watch an instrument being played- I'm sad to inform that once again edits are fast paced.
It is a fun movie with a lot of 2008 live concert footage of their classic 80's songs. They go into some detail about the plane piloted by singer Bruce Dickinson (interviewed) and basically the film follows its journey around the world for 2 months.
Most footage and time is spent in South America- this is where Maiden is the most popular nowadays. There are a few funny outrageous fan moments and the chaos in South America from a Maiden show is intense.
There are many quick scenes with Nicko- he plays the joker part well the entire flick, a few brief interviews with
Steve, Adrain and Janick. Hardly anything of Dave Murray and nothing serious at all with Nicko. There are brief cameos/comments by Kerry, Lars and a few other ""rock stars"". The problem I had was that this was being billed as the 1st time Maiden was letting us into their lives and there was nothing new in this department. I didn't learn or see anything new about where they live, their houses (mansions ?), everday life away from the band, marriages, wives (no mention at all), kids (very brief shot of Steves kids only), hobbies, side bands/projects, plus so much more would have been interesting. Does Bruce still fence ? is his side band still going ? Any wives/kids go on tour besides Steve's ? Did Steve ever re-marry ? Does anybody keep in touch with past members (Blaze, Paul, Clive)regularly ? Is Eddie just a giant robot now ? - there was a brief shot of a guy remote controlling him. Whats the situation with famous cover artist Derek Riggs nowadays- last I heard he was suing the band.
Whats the deal with all the Maiden merchandizing out there now ? - how do members feel ?
Is there really going to be only 1 more studio album ? - long rumored !
Something thats been bothering me is that I've noticed multiple times now
in print/interviews and in person (see above/concerts) that Bruce clearly has some issues with older fans and American/United States fans.
At the end of the movie in Canada he bashes US fans for not accepting
Maiden as early as Canadians fans did. I'm 32 and got into Maiden in their ""uncool"" (at least in US) early 90's days. It would have been great to see some serious questions & answers to topics like these.
I already knew that they play some golf between shows - it was on the Rock In Rio 2000 DVD. The songs are great- but are edited and we will get them in full on the extended DVD/CD/Blu-ray sets that are coming. This will be a cool intro for non/new fans to watch - but leaves longtime fans still in the dark on many areas. Basically to us long time fans this will be a movie to show non-fan friends for a few laughs. Then watch/listen the full concert set which I'm sure will be great. Its way better than the whiney/depressing/bore fest that was Metallica's some kind of monster.
Basically a concert video with some Pantera style funny moments thrown in, I was expecting more from Maiden since they already have tons of concert videos. Also was expecting more since the filmmakers previous ""Metal: headbangers journey"" documentary was very in-depth & excellent.
PS: I realize that many of you will respond claiming I'm not a real fan or whatever and answer with basically made-up or internet rumour/unofficial fan site responses, please don't waste your time- I too can sumarize up some answers for my questions, but it would have been nice to have more official answers directly from the band.",1240704000,21,4222,4.571240105540897
