4071393,4,B0035QHXLK,"For years, I have been curious about ""Scruples"". It has been advertised as one of Lindsay Wagner's best tv movies and as legendary Gene Tierney's last video performance. For 1980, this movie was considered scandelous. However, in the new ages of violent music videos, terrorists, and a non innocence society, this is tame. Lindsay Wagner, as usual, is a gifted actress. Barry Bostwick and Marie-France Piser are great as the secondary story line as two people, who are in love, but don't know how to commit to each other. Guest appearences include Connie Stevens, Robert Reed, Gavin MacLeod, and Kim Cattrall. This is a factory of stars, who guest starred on ""Love Boat"" and ""Charlie's Angels"". After reading the facts on the stars, I noticed under Lindsay Wagner's biography that she was in an auto accident, which gave her a scar above her upper lip. It is evident here. However, she is nevertheless beautiful. Marie-France Fimer is a striking sexy but Carole Lombard type beauty, who gives an excellent performance. She is sexy and wise cracking like Lombard. Unfortunately, I read she died recently this year in a pool accident. God bless her soul. Barry Bostwick is also good in a not conviencing hustler role. He makes the audience like him in the long run. As for the most surprising role, it goes to legendary Gene Tierney, who played in ""Laura"", ""Leave Her To Heaven"" and ""The Raxor's Edge"". Gene Tierney was known to be one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood. In this movie, it is a sad reminder that time takes it toll. Gene is overweight and looks more like 70 by today's standard than 59 or 60, when she made this. The eyes are still as beautiful, when she first made movies and in my opinion, more beautiful than Elizabeth Taylor's. However, she gives a great brief short performance as a latent lesbian, who is overwhelmed with Kim Cattrall's beauty. This appearence was shortly made after Gene Tierney's bestseller autobiography. One, guesses, she did this to help promote the book. Anyway, Gene's performance makes you believe she was lusty after Kim Cattrall. Buy this DVD. It is one to have in your collection. This makes me want to buy more Lindsay Wagner t.v. or movie performances. Enjoy.",1304726400,16,2216,4.818897637795276
4071394,1,B0035QHXLK,"I either read the book long ago or saw the video, but I remembered liking it. At some point, years later I bought the DVD and I finally got around to watching it. It started out OK, and the lead character, Billie, was a nice girl with good morals, etc., but didn't move along as I remembered it.  Billie changes. For instance, after her very rich, and much older but beloved husband dies, she hires a helicopter where she throws his ashes in the sea.  When she gets back, innocent Billy (up to now) initiates sex with the pilot. Already I'm confused. The story was exasperating, and I kept fast forwarding it to see if it got any better. It didn't. With a couple of exceptions, most of the players were trashy.  The story had no humor, and no character. To make it worse it highlighted murder, rape, wealthy and/or neurotic Hollywood characters, many of them crooks.

I saw several actors I'd seen in other TV shows. (Much better ones)  MTM (Mary's dad, Murrey from MTM, Lindsay Wagner from Paper Chase (the film), Kim Cattrail (Paper Chase,(the TV version), Sex and the City)and others. There are 3 DVD's to this set. The lead actress, Billy, starts off OK, intelligent, innocent,smart and beautiful, but then she goes Hollywood.  Don't waste your time watching this horror.  About 3/4 past, and a bit after Billy's 2nd marriage to some director I stopped watching it and threw it away.",1295827200,,1387,4.636734693877551
4071395,5,B0035QHXLK,I have been waiting for Scruples to come out on DVD.  I missed out on the VHS version and have not been able to see this movie for a while.  Well the wait was worth it.  I really like this movie and would recommend it to anyone.,1287100800,,228,3.8085106382978724

4071397,1,B0035QHXLK,"I love this miniseries and was quite excited about its release on DVD. Unfortunately, I have to report that the quality of the DVD is abysmal. I am on second copy having sent the first one back because of all the skipping, etc. The second one is even worse. You would think that there would be some kind of quality control. Now I have to waste time sending the second set back. So unless you have a lot of patience and nothing better to do - buy the DVD.",1282435200,7,454,4.112359550561798

4071400,4,B0035QHXLK,"Since people seem to be reviewing other formats of this series, I wanted to make sure people knew I was reviewing the recently released mini-series 'on-demand' by Warner Bros.  I was leery at first of buying DVD-R because, as a rule, they are easy to scratch and generally more fragile than glass pressed, mass produced DVD's.  Sadly, my fears were realized when my copy of 'Scruples' arrived and disc one started stalling and skipping half way through.  Indeed, it seemed to be scratched (even though it was a NEW copy).  So, I am sending it back and getting another one.  My other fear was quality, but this was quickly dispelled.  Read on.

I have to say that other than the technical difficulty, the quality of this DVD is excellent. Video is crisp and sharp and sound is good (for a mono 1980 miniseries).  The series itself stands the test of time and is as good as always.  Of course, we're talking Judith Krantz, so it is as sappy and cheesy as you can expect it to be.  The discs themselves are professionally produced, with great artwork and printing both on disc and keepcase.

Something else I would like to point out. That Warner Bros. is releasing titles 'on demand' on DVD-R seems to be the answer for a dwindling economy, which would otherwise see many of these titles never released.  I applaud Warner Bros. for taking this route.  I wish SONY would take the hint and use this method to release TV series that they release one season of and then never release the rest due to less than multi-million dollar sales.  With this 'on demand' system, everyone wins (especially the customer).  Thanks Warner Bros.!",1273795200,44,1624,4.649122807017544
4071401,1,B0035QHXLK,"If you would like to see more cheese than at a Wisconsin cheese factory tour, this is your miniseries.
Let's face it I had to laugh at the instantaneous way the characters fall in love every time they look at each other.
And where are the minorities? Well, wait 90 minutes for the waiter to serve the white people drinks at the party!

And then there's a car chase that has to be the worst that has ever been filmed! Don't waste your time, you might fall asleep.

I guess I just don't like this type of cheesy soap.",1269820800,3,515,4.191919191919192

Then DVDs made their appearance  and now I have it. Why do I keep watching it? Because it is a lesson in growing up with style, how to become a lady with real class, with all that this may imply, which is a deep knowledge of people and how to treat men and women with the respect they deserve, but also how to behave correctly in any situation , especially those that may not be so pleasant. All the movie stars play exeptionally  well.  and as for exterior scenes, I love watching those ones set in very elegant surroundings, with smart people as well as those shot  just outside L.A.,in the countryside, sunny and wild. These are a real pick-me-up when watched during a dark and cold winter night.",1467590400,7,855,4.325

4071430,3,B0035QHXLK,"This is another one of those guilty pleasure books for me read when I was a kid. In fact I loved it because the transformation of Wilhelmina into Billie is so much fun to read. But reading it I'd have never, ever seen Lindsay Wagner in the role. Nothing against the actress, in fact I just love her in many other things, and particularly as Jamie Sommers, but she's just not right as Billie. As with Stephanie Powers and Mistral's Daughter she was a bit too old and more than a bit miscast in this role, particularly early on.

That being said I loved the casting of Bostwick as Spider Elliot and  Marie-France Pisier as Valentine, though she did not quite match the physical appearance of the character. She resembles the fiery redheaded Valentine about as much as Wagner resembles Billie, which is to say not quite. Bostwick could not have been more perfect IMHO, but several cast members, Kim Cattrall as well, you have to really work at suspending belief if you have actually read Krantz's book before seeing this.

I love Krantz's work for what it is. I enjoy a good trash novel once in a while but Krantz's miniseries they are definitely hit and miss in terms of casting sometimes. You have these characters who are really young being played by people twice their ages.  Hair colors change on a whim. It can be a bit confusing if you have actually read these novels a lot as many people did before the mini series thing started.

I enjoyed watching this one, but it left me feeling a bit flat. Scruples was such a great read and this miniseries just doesn't quite live up to it really. Then again it's better than Scruples II, the book, which blessedly was never made into a film and which I admittedly loathe.",1462147200,2,1716,4.504823151125402

Wonderful 'soap', from the book that scandalized Hollywood, Judith Krantz.  The movie is engrossing and filled with wonderful interiors.  Not to be missed are the furnishings, still 'in situ' at the old Hilda Boldt Weber/Conrad Hilton estate, which were designed in the 1930's by TH Robsjohn~Gibbings.  Also the wonderful decor of the store on fabled Rodeo Drive, Scruples (the old Giorgio Beverly Hills store).  I grew up in that area and know the streets and many of the houses well.

It will not play because my dvd player is also a recorder, it states that in small print on the dvd case.  It did not state that when I ordered it, otherwise I would NOT have ordered it since I can't play it on mine.  Very unhappy, have written (via e-mail) to the sender and have not heard back to date, its been a couple of weeks and no response.

4071551,4,B0035QHXLK,"I'm writing this review in response to Lotte's review of the dvd, ""Scruples.""  I was appalled when I read the review, thinking that Lotte had mis-judged the series.  I do not own ""Scruples"" on dvd yet.  But I do have the original VHS copy, and I also have a personal copy of my own which I had watched so many times until the product became worn.  Lotte, I really do believe you've over-looked something fundamental when viewing the dvd. ""Scruples"" has always been a superb piece of '80's drama, and having Lindsay Wagner at the helm of the production vehicle was a superb choice.  I have always regarded her as the quinessential queen of the '80's mini-series.  And I only wish the television moguls would re-consider bringing back the mini-series before reality t.v. completely takes over the spectrum.

Lotte, please give the dvd another once-over.  I'm sure there are some things you've missed.  Or maybe you were viewing on a bad day. ""Scruples"" is an excellent choice of material and a pertinent display of dramatic caliber that should still be apart of your movie collection.
