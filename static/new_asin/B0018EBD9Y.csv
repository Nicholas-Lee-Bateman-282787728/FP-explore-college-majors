8269666,5,B0018EBD9Y,Another very informative training video from Julie Goodnight. She is an excellent instructor and the camera shots are very well done. The instruction is straight and to the point. I purchased most of the entire equine training series offered by the Julie Goodnight group and often re-watch a video when I am having a problem with one of my horses!,1421712000,,347,4.8
8269667,5,B0018EBD9Y,"I really like how Julie covers everything important in all of her DVD's. She's a great teacher and I have learned a lot from watching her DVD's. When I watch her show on TV, Sometimes I notice where other riders are not sitting or riding correctly. It's nice to know the right way things are supposed to be. I would recommend her DVD's to anyone who is starting out or wants to improve their riding skills.",1411171200,,406,4.355263157894737
8269668,5,B0018EBD9Y,"I always thought I knew how to ride horses.  Ha!  that was because I just rode those old trail horses that were trained to just do their job and ignore the stupid riders.  Now that I have my own horses I needed help with proper riding skills.  Julie explains in such a clear, easy to understand manner.  Very good!",1362355200,2,314,4.254237288135593
8269669,5,B0018EBD9Y,"Julie has a very easy to understand and logical way of explaining basic beginning riding skills needed to learn how to become a good rider. She goes through every principal, step by step, including excersizes that you can practice at home with a buddy. I plan on buying the rest of the series as time goes by and I become a more accomplished rider. If you are a beginner and don't know where to start, this video is for you.",1356998400,3,424,4.3125
