238835,5,6300215202,I have never seen this Christmas classic before receiving...but this is my girlfriends FAVORITE holiday classic EVER. She told me she was never able to find it. Thanks amazon.com!,1319155200,,179,5.206896551724138
238836,5,6300215202,I ordered this so my Grandchildren could see that a little girl was concerned enough about the existance of Santa,1301961600,,113,4.7
238837,5,6300215202,"Had to buy this cartoon a second/third time. Had to chalk the first one up as a loss, due to used vhs having a bad picture (and won't mention the seller). Hopefully my second used tape, from another seller, will play in perfect condition. But, just in case the vhs is bad again, I ordered this in new dvd slimcase. Now, this should be testimony enough for this great little classic.",1295222400,,382,4.394366197183099
238838,3,6300215202,This is one classic Christmas that I grew up with and try every year to watch.  It is the true story of one little girl's belief in Santa and her letter sent to the popular newspaper of her day. I can say that every Chritmas since her letter is published in one or two New York newspapers with the editor's reply.  I admit I am not a fan of the cover of the DVD box because the cartoon inside was done by same crew who did PEANUTS shows.  I recommend it for the young and young at heart.,1295049600,,487,3.9489795918367347
238839,5,6300215202,"When I finally found this movie I really didn't mind that was only in VHS, I love the fact that is a true storie, is amazing how this newspaper editor took the time to answer the little girl's letter about the existence of Santa Claus, it makes you believe again,.. great movie.",1268524800,,278,4.365384615384615
238840,5,6300215202,"I have always been a fan of that bit of holiday history and discovered that a tv movie had been made about it.  It was very hard to find,  Thank you Amazon!! It was a wonderful shopping experience and now I have it and thoroughly enjoy it.",1256342400,,239,4.0638297872340425
238841,4,6300215202,VHS tape exactly as advertised & in perfect condition.  I wish it were available on DVD.  This is a great story.  I would love to see someone remake this with current animation.,1199059200,,177,4.46875
238842,3,6300215202,well this cartoon has similarities to peanuts an frost an santa clauses its probably the first to show different ethnics chinese guy an afro american girl etc ...its a fine holiday toon ...,1190160000,,189,4.757575757575758
238843,5,6300215202,"This is a video that could melt all but the coldest of Grinch hearts.  It must have been written by a lawyer for never have I ever heard a better case for the existance of Santa Claus expounded on any medium.  Yes I have heard of and seen Miracle on 34th Street and yes it is a pretty movie but no comparision to this.

What makes this movie way too cool is that core theme hails from a real life Virginia who posed this question many years ago.  The very best of the wisdom of her age shines through in this little animation.  I am a grown cranky old man and this movie brings me to tears everytime I see it because of its total child like innocence.

The animation's message is one of tolerance and love.  This is Christmas seen through the eyes of a child.  While not a heavy religious movie its core message rings out the true meaning of Christmas without all the high tone overbearing religious Gobble-D-Gook common in other such fare.  This animation only sticks its toe in the religious malstrom for a breif minute and it does not advocate any, ""faith"".  This is just a fun animation suggesting in the holiday season we get in touch with the kinder angel's of our natures which is not at all a bad message in todays world.",1101513600,20,1229,4.304347826086956
238896,5,6300215202,HARD TO FIND BUT GOT IT FAST AND HAPPY WITH IT.  LOOKING FOR A DVD OR THE SAME MOVIE.  THIS IS A CHRISTMAS CLASSIC.,1386288000,,115,3.75
238897,5,6300215202,"Great copy of a childhood classic!  Thoroughly enjoyed seeing this old friend from my childhood again.  I was also surprised and delighted to discover it contains two bonus programs:  ""Christmas Through the Ages"" and the animated version of ""The Littlest Angel"".  Christmas through the Ages was clearly made in the 50's or 60's and is not remastered by the manufacturer but is still an excellent program and the Littlest Angel is a charming addition that made me smile all over again.",1385942400,,484,4.938271604938271
238898,5,6300215202,"Love this Christmas Classic, and can't find it anywhere!  So glad we found it here!  It is a wonderful Christmas Message for small childrem and a Christmas tradition in our house.  We lost our copy, and were devastated, and couldn't find the original anywhere.  Wish they still showed it on tv.  Great Story!",1383264000,,308,4.735849056603773
238899,5,6300215202,"This cartoon from the mid-70's will have you remembering the good 'ol times and the innocence of youth.  They don't make them like this anymore.  How can you go wrong with Mr. Howell-well, Jim Backus narrating a sweet Christmas spirited tale?  A ""lost"" favorite that's on par with A Charlie Brown Christmas and The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, this overlooked gem is worth adding to your collection.",1367020800,,398,4.91044776119403
238900,5,6300215202,"I used to watch this when it aired but it hasn't been shown in quite a while. I was hoping to find it on DVD but it doesn't seem to have been released that way just yet. Still, it's on video so I can still enjoy it.",1358294400,,215,3.595744680851064
238901,4,6300215202,I have been searching for this cartoon for years... I loved it.. It was very close to the actual story,1357689600,,102,4.15

I LOVE THIS VIDEO BECAUSE; IT SHOWS THE WORLD AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN, EVERYONE GETTING ALONG!  The most awesome thing about this Video is not even about Santa Claus, it shows the world as it would be without the evils of racism and hate.  You have a multi-racial classroom with kids all getting along as real friends.  You have a peek into what our past would have been like if we could all just get along.  The story weaves many beautiful messages about how love manifests itself in many unique cultures all building onto the Santa Claus message.  This is not merely a video about Santa Claus or tolerance this lovely little Christmas story shows us what our world would look like if Peace on Earth Good Will to all were practiced by everyone, everywhere, all the time.  Even the Jewish candy shoppe owner offered a wise yet kind word.

Now that this is available on DVD get your copy before it they are all gone.  For some reason, ""Yes Virginia There Is A Santa Claus"" did not develop the near cult following other Christmas animated shows developed.  For me it is not Christmas unless I see, ""Yes Virginia There Is A Santa Claus"" at least once during the Holidays.  You see I am over 50 years old and despite my autism and many disabilities, I still believe in Santa Claus because; I pray my heart never grows old, hard and cynical.",1354579200,5,2558,4.382663847780127
238903,5,6300215202,I find this program to be full of ideas we could all use to become better people. It never hurts to be reminded of how we should treat one another.,1326931200,,147,3.933333333333333
238904,5,6300215202,"This hard to find copy of a classic childrens TV special provides just the right approach to a wonderful story for children.  I have seen a recent version and it is not nearly as welcoming and friendly as the original.  It makes the editor more frightening and off-putting to kids.  This version is a wonderful product.  While product came with a damaged case, the seller was most prompt in rectifying the situation by supplying a replacement product.  Excellent response and service",1326672000,,483,4.91358024691358
238905,5,6300215202,"Looking at Yes Virginia, There is a Santa Claus was just like seeing an old friend. For so many years I wish that I could see this movie again and for the first time in over 40 years I can say thank you old friend and I will see you again and again.",1322179200,2,249,3.7169811320754715

I was a bit nervous when I bought it that it would not be the right one but be reassured, it is!!  It is still so much fun to watch and my children like it more than the newer version.",1437350400,,277,3.7586206896551726

7805708,5,6300215202,This is EXACTLY the DVD I've been looking for!! It's the one created by the people that did A Charlie Brown Christmas!! The second two added shorts were snooze-fest material...Christmas Thru the Ages and The Littlest Angel. I'm SO glad Yes Virginia was first!!,1386633600,,260,4.931818181818182
